# Other Views: Liberties, Gallo Wine
## 
### Oregon Barometer 
During the past year, the United Farm
Workers Union and its supporters have
disseminated considerable information about
the continuing dispute between it and the
Teamsters Union, as to which union should
have jurisdiction over Gallo farm workers.
E. & J. Gallo Winery is crying foul. They
are caught in the middle of a jurisdictional
dispute between the two unions and have
unfairly been subjected to vilification. The
nationwide boycott on non-UFW lettuce,
grapes and Gallo wines was called for reasons
on which there is no moral justification.
The basis of the controversy is the right of
Chicano farm workers to chbose their own
representation. After a long battle, which
included boycotts at Safeway stores, Cesar
Chavez won the right to represent the farm
workers in many areas of California.
Gallo has, however, always favored free
and impartial elections. In July of 1973, it
was determined that a majority of all Gallo
farm workers had requested the Teamsters be
their collective bargaining agent. The
Teamsters were chosen the same way the
UFW had been in 1967, by presenting a
verified signature card.
The union contract signed with Gallo in
1973 made them the highest paid farm
workers in the continental United States.
Gallo farm workers are paid a minimum of
$2.89 an hour. An employment plan gives
them paid life insurance, paid health
insurance, paid pension plan, paid vacations,
paid holidays and paid unemployment
benefits. No wonder Gallo is embittered at
UFW claims that its contract gave the
workers almost nothing.
Gallo, also, repudiates the claim that it
uses child labor. The winemakers say no one
onder 18 is hired. It does, hoever, provide
jobs for local college and high school
students during the peak of the. harvest
season all of which receive full union scale
pay.

The UFW is on the downhill slide. Its
membership has dropped from about 55,000
about two yeras ago to somewhere below
10,000. In an attempt to regain control of
these workers, Gallo says the UFW is out to
get them.
The irony of UFW claims is that it
pretends to be speaking on behalf of all farm
workers. There are in fact 2.3 million such
workers employed in the United States so
UFW membership hardly makes a dent in this
body.
Gallo farm workers changed unions by
choice in 1973. To boycott their goods could
only hurt the workers, whose main interests
are to continue work and provide themselves
with a reasonable salary with decent working
conditions. Gallo is certainly not the boogie •
man the UFW makes it out to be.
Gallo farm workers choose the Teamsters
over the UFW by choice. The UFW should
redirect its energies and worry about
providing for its own workers.

With very little fanfare, Congress passed a
series of amendments to the Freedom of
Information Act earlier this week which
should make it easier for citizens to find out
what the government is doing. The
amendments would expedite procedures for
obtaining government documents and
supposedly restrict the number of items
which can be classified as secret and kept
from the public.
But although the new amendments would
be an improvement over the original bill,
many of the loopholes which. allowed the
government to deny information requests
still remain.
The original Freedom of Information Act
was passed in 1967 and supposedly gave
citizens journalists in particular access to
previously unavailable government records. It

didn't take long, though, for journalists to
discover that the law which was supposed to
make getting information easier actually tied
up documents in snarls of red tape as
bureaucrats found loopholes to delay release
of information or deny it to the public
altogether. Requests for information often
took weeks or months to process.
While the new amendments would set a
30-day limit on administrative procedures
and give access cases precedence on appeals
courts dockets, there is still some question
whether the newly amended law would open
up government as much as its supporters
claim.
The amendments would give federal
courts the power to examine documents
labeled "secret" to determine if they were
correctly classified by the government. But
general exemption classifications to the law
would continue, and agencies could still
refuse to hand over internal agency
memoranda and similar documents.
Furthermore, many types of information
could still be classified as secret for
"national security purposes."
The procedures and the possibility of
litigation are also somewhat undesirable for
people who need their information within a
short period of time. Some studies of use of
the 1967 act by journalists indicate that
many don't formally request information
because by the time they might finally get it,
the news value would be gone.
The new amendments are a substantial
improvement over the original bill. It is
obvious, however, that revisions still do not
go as far as they could toward letting citizens
find out what the government is really doing
in their names.

With very little fanfare, Congress passed a
series of amendments to the Freedom of
Information Act earlier this week which
should make it easier for citizens to find out
what the government is doing. The
amendments would expedite procedures for
obtaining government documents and
supposedly restrict the number of items
which can be classified as secret and kept
from the public.
But although the new amendments would
be an improvement over the original bill,
many of the loopholes which. allowed the
government to deny information requests
still remain.
The original Freedom of Information Act
was passed in 1967 and supposedly gave
citizens journalists in particular access to
previously unavailable government records. It

didn't take long, though, for journalists to
discover that the law which was supposed to
make getting information easier actually tied
up documents in snarls of red tape as
bureaucrats found loopholes to delay release
of information or deny it to the public
altogether. Requests for information often
took weeks or months to process.
While the new amendments would set a
30-day limit on administrative procedures
and give access cases precedence on appeals
courts dockets, there is still some question
whether the newly amended law would open
up government as much as its supporters
claim.
The amendments would give federal
courts the power to examine documents
labeled "secret" to determine if they were
correctly classified by the government. But
general exemption classifications to the law
would continue, and agencies could still
refuse to hand over internal agency
memoranda and similar documents.
Furthermore, many types of information
could still be classified as secret for
"national security purposes."
The procedures and the possibility of
litigation are also somewhat undesirable for
people who need their information within a
short period of time. Some studies of use of
the 1967 act by journalists indicate that
many don't formally request information
because by the time they might finally get it,
the news value would be gone.
The new amendments are a substantial
improvement over the original bill. It is
obvious, however, that revisions still do not
go as far as they could toward letting citizens
find out what the government is really doing
in their names.

During the past year, the United Farm
Workers Union and its supporters have
disseminated considerable information about
the continuing dispute between it and the
Teamsters Union, as to which union should
have jurisdiction over Gallo farm workers.
E. & J. Gallo Winery is crying foul. They
are caught in the middle of a jurisdictional
dispute between the two unions and have
unfairly been subjected to vilification. The
nationwide boycott on non-UFW lettuce,
grapes and Gallo wines was called for reasons
on which there is no moral justification.
The basis of the controversy is the right of
Chicano farm workers to chbose their own
representation. After a long battle, which
included boycotts at Safeway stores, Cesar
Chavez won the right to represent the farm
workers in many areas of California.
Gallo has, however, always favored free
and impartial elections. In July of 1973, it
was determined that a majority of all Gallo
farm workers had requested the Teamsters be
their collective bargaining agent. The
Teamsters were chosen the same way the
UFW had been in 1967, by presenting a
verified signature card.
The union contract signed with Gallo in
1973 made them the highest paid farm
workers in the continental United States.
Gallo farm workers are paid a minimum of
$2.89 an hour. An employment plan gives
them paid life insurance, paid health
insurance, paid pension plan, paid vacations,
paid holidays and paid unemployment
benefits. No wonder Gallo is embittered at
UFW claims that its contract gave the
workers almost nothing.
Gallo, also, repudiates the claim that it
uses child labor. The winemakers say no one
onder 18 is hired. It does, hoever, provide
jobs for local college and high school
students during the peak of the. harvest
season all of which receive full union scale
pay.

The UFW is on the downhill slide. Its
membership has dropped from about 55,000
about two yeras ago to somewhere below
10,000. In an attempt to regain control of
these workers, Gallo says the UFW is out to
get them.
The irony of UFW claims is that it
pretends to be speaking on behalf of all farm
workers. There are in fact 2.3 million such
workers employed in the United States so
UFW membership hardly makes a dent in this
body.

obvious, however, that revisions still do not
go as far as they could toward letting citizens
find out what the government is really doing
in their names.

During the past year, the United Farm
Workers Union and its supporters have
disseminated considerable information about
the continuing dispute between it and the
Teamsters Union, as to which union should
have jurisdiction over Gallo farm workers.
E. & J. Gallo Winery is crying foul. They
are caught in the middle of a jurisdictional
dispute between the two unions and have
unfairly been subjected to vilification. The
nationwide boycott on non-UFW lettuce,
grapes and Gallo wines was called for reasons
on which there is no moral justification.
The basis of the controversy is the right of
Chicano farm workers to chbose their own
representation. After a long battle, which
included boycotts at Safeway stores, Cesar
Chavez won the right to represent the farm
workers in many areas of California.
Gallo has, however, always favored free
and impartial elections. In July of 1973, it
was determined that a majority of all Gallo
farm workers had requested the Teamsters be
their collective bargaining agent. The
Teamsters were chosen the same way the
UFW had been in 1967, by presenting a
verified signature card.
The union contract signed with Gallo in
1973 made them the highest paid farm
workers in the continental United States.
Gallo farm workers are paid a minimum of
$2.89 an hour. An employment plan gives
them paid life insurance, paid health
insurance, paid pension plan, paid vacations,
paid holidays and paid unemployment
benefits. No wonder Gallo is embittered at
UFW claims that its contract gave the
workers almost nothing.
Gallo, also, repudiates the claim that it
uses child labor. The winemakers say no one
onder 18 is hired. It does, hoever, provide
jobs for local college and high school
students during the peak of the. harvest
season all of which receive full union scale
pay.

The UFW is on the downhill slide. Its
membership has dropped from about 55,000
about two yeras ago to somewhere below
10,000. In an attempt to regain control of
these workers, Gallo says the UFW is out to
get them.
The irony of UFW claims is that it
pretends to be speaking on behalf of all farm
workers. There are in fact 2.3 million such
workers employed in the United States so
UFW membership hardly makes a dent in this
body.
Gallo farm workers changed unions by
choice in 1973. To boycott their goods could
only hurt the workers, whose main interests
are to continue work and provide themselves
with a reasonable salary with decent working
conditions. Gallo is certainly not the boogie •
man the UFW makes it out to be.
Gallo farm workers choose the Teamsters
over the UFW by choice. The UFW should
redirect its energies and worry about
providing for its own workers.

With very little fanfare, Congress passed a
series of amendments to the Freedom of
Information Act earlier this week which
should make it easier for citizens to find out
what the government is doing. The
amendments would expedite procedures for
obtaining government documents and
supposedly restrict the number of items
which can be classified as secret and kept
from the public.
But although the new amendments would
be an improvement over the original bill,
many of the loopholes which. allowed the
government to deny information requests
still remain.
The original Freedom of Information Act
was passed in 1967 and supposedly gave
citizens journalists in particular access to
previously unavailable government records. It

didn't take long, though, for journalists to
discover that the law which was supposed to
make getting information easier actually tied
up documents in snarls of red tape as
bureaucrats found loopholes to delay release
of information or deny it to the public
altogether. Requests for information often
took weeks or months to process.
While the new amendments would set a
30-day limit on administrative procedures
and give access cases precedence on appeals
courts dockets, there is still some question
whether the newly amended law would open
up government as much as its supporters
claim.
The amendments would give federal
courts the power to examine documents
labeled "secret" to determine if they were
correctly classified by the government. But
general exemption classifications to the law
would continue, and agencies could still
refuse to hand over internal agency
memoranda and similar documents.
Furthermore, many types of information
could still be classified as secret for
"national security purposes."
The procedures and the possibility of
litigation are also somewhat undesirable for
people who need their information within a
short period of time. Some studies of use of
the 1967 act by journalists indicate that
many don't formally request information
because by the time they might finally get it,
the news value would be gone.
The new amendments are a substantial
improvement over the original bill. It is
obvious, however, that revisions still do not
go as far as they could toward letting citizens
find out what the government is really doing
in their names.
