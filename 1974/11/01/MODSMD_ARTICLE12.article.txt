# Right To Know Vs. Responsibility
## 
### Karen Lachenauer 
Now that Jim Wascher has
neatly and "rationally" picked off
the arguments against explicit
reporting (Daily, Oct. 28), it's
time for a rational rebuttal.
Wascher had easy tinder to
quell concern for the family,
emotional appeals after all. But
sentiment aside, there are reasons,
good reasons, for not printing all
of the facts all of the time.
Wascher spoke of the public's
"right to learn ~. precisely what
happened." The word "precisely"
needs to be defined, but even
lacking a Consensus, it's not clear
how a university community is
better alerted to a member's
assassination by being told she
was sexually molested, much less
how.
Last year, we learned a physics
student had been stabbed outside
the Undergraduate Library;
knowing that the fatal blade had
entered between the fourth and
fifth rib on the left side (if it had)
would not have enhanced our
terror.
Fact Frightening
It was the fact of David
Levine's death that frightened us;
it is the fact of Arlis Perry's death
that frightens us still, and grieves
her parents, far more than the
circumstances. The implication, in
one sentence or one headline, that
someone out there in the dark was
prepared to kill, is enough to
make us wary.
It is fatuous of the Daily or its
advocates to take • credit, as
Wascher asserted, for making
people "a little bit more cautious
each night" by telling "as much of
the truth as we know."
If anything, the Daily's
advertisements of the crime's
specifics to some, a glorification
has caused us to have to be a bit
more cautious.
Media Inspired Violence
No one has proved
incontrovertibly that media
violence inspires more violence,
but the evidence is strong enough
for Stanford to build an entire
institute around its further
investigation the Institute for
Communications Research, part
of the Communications
Department with which the Daily

staff has no small liaison.
Now that those who delight in
vivid descriptions have studied
the murderer's methods, what
ingenious variations on the theme
might they concoct? A few
friends and I have come up with
some, which in the interests of
good journalism we should
perhaps ennumerate. But we fear
putting ideas into anyone's head.
Wascher's main thrust,
condensed in the title "Explicit
Facts Crush Falsehoods," is
indisputable when facts and
falsehoods confront. But separate
the best intentioned reader from a
police statement, and he can three
minutes later relate the story in
more living color than the
offender might have dreamed.
Newspaper facts may diminish
"incendiary rumors," but they
don't guarantee their demise.
'Right To Know'
We are indebted to journalists
for our "right to know." But on a

philosophical level, that right's
very existence can be debated.
The constitution and the press
invented, elevated and
perpetuated what is really a
privilege; Thomas Jefferson
notwithstanding, it is alienable.
While on the one hand, this
argues for taking all the liberties
possible to reinforce freedom of
the press, on the other, it reminds
us that we can't operate from the
premise of god-given carte
blanche.
What all this comes down to is
that newspapers must monitor
themselves, first locating whom
they are responding to in their
"responsibility." The fine line
Wascher cited between discretion
and covering up is difficult to
pinpoint because it's actually a
shade of grey. If we insist on
blacks and whites, steadfastly
refusing to temper statements,.we
may lose the spirit of the quest,

inadvertently hurting those we
mean to champion.
it must be asked, to whom or
what do the lurid details speak
the noble in us or some other
animal, thrill seeker. Criminal?
Ahd in journalists themselves, a
small creature called lust for
preeminence?
The Daily may be playing a
one-upmanship game without
realizing it. Blood and guts, as
KGO-TV news' 58 percent rating
has amply shown, sells editions.
The Perry story had everything:
blood, guts and sex. Sad to think,
but it smacked of sensationalism.
One charge seemed most
unfair, but on closer inspection,
most true. "A certain number of
our readers are afraid of the
truth," wrote Wascher. Yes, in a
culture for violence where realism
is a catalyst, we are afraid of too
much of it.

truth," wrote Wascher. Yes, in a
culture for violence where realism
is a catalyst, we are afraid of too
much of it.
(Karen Lachenauer is a graduate
student in communication.)
Now that Jim Wascher has
neatly and "rationally" picked off
the arguments against explicit
reporting (Daily, Oct. 28), it's
time for a rational rebuttal.
Wascher had easy tinder to
quell concern for the family,
emotional appeals after all. But
sentiment aside, there are reasons,
good reasons, for not printing all
of the facts all of the time.
Wascher spoke of the public's
"right to learn ~. precisely what
happened." The word "precisely"
needs to be defined, but even
lacking a Consensus, it's not clear
how a university community is
better alerted to a member's
assassination by being told she
was sexually molested, much less
how.
Last year, we learned a physics
student had been stabbed outside
the Undergraduate Library;
knowing that the fatal blade had
entered between the fourth and
fifth rib on the left side (if it had)
would not have enhanced our
terror.
Fact Frightening
It was the fact of David
Levine's death that frightened us;
it is the fact of Arlis Perry's death
that frightens us still, and grieves
her parents, far more than the
circumstances. The implication, in
one sentence or one headline, that
someone out there in the dark was
prepared to kill, is enough to
make us wary.
It is fatuous of the Daily or its
advocates to take • credit, as
Wascher asserted, for making
people "a little bit more cautious
each night" by telling "as much of
the truth as we know."
If anything, the Daily's
advertisements of the crime's
specifics to some, a glorification
has caused us to have to be a bit
more cautious.
Media Inspired Violence
No one has proved
incontrovertibly that media
violence inspires more violence,
but the evidence is strong enough
for Stanford to build an entire
institute around its further
investigation the Institute for
Communications Research, part
of the Communications
Department with which the Daily

staff has no small liaison.
Now that those who delight in
vivid descriptions have studied
the murderer's methods, what
ingenious variations on the theme
might they concoct? A few
friends and I have come up with
some, which in the interests of
good journalism we should
perhaps ennumerate. But we fear
putting ideas into anyone's head.
Wascher's main thrust,
condensed in the title "Explicit
Facts Crush Falsehoods," is
indisputable when facts and
falsehoods confront. But separate
the best intentioned reader from a
police statement, and he can three
minutes later relate the story in
more living color than the
offender might have dreamed.
Newspaper facts may diminish
"incendiary rumors," but they
don't guarantee their demise.
'Right To Know'
We are indebted to journalists
for our "right to know." But on a

philosophical level, that right's
very existence can be debated.
The constitution and the press
invented, elevated and
perpetuated what is really a
privilege; Thomas Jefferson
notwithstanding, it is alienable.
While on the one hand, this
argues for taking all the liberties
possible to reinforce freedom of
the press, on the other, it reminds
us that we can't operate from the
premise of god-given carte
blanche.
What all this comes down to is
that newspapers must monitor
themselves, first locating whom
they are responding to in their
"responsibility." The fine line
Wascher cited between discretion
and covering up is difficult to
pinpoint because it's actually a
shade of grey. If we insist on
blacks and whites, steadfastly
refusing to temper statements,.we
may lose the spirit of the quest,

inadvertently hurting those we
mean to champion.
it must be asked, to whom or
what do the lurid details speak
the noble in us or some other
animal, thrill seeker. Criminal?
Ahd in journalists themselves, a
small creature called lust for
preeminence?
The Daily may be playing a
one-upmanship game without
realizing it. Blood and guts, as
KGO-TV news' 58 percent rating
has amply shown, sells editions.
The Perry story had everything:
blood, guts and sex. Sad to think,
but it smacked of sensationalism.
One charge seemed most
unfair, but on closer inspection,
most true. "A certain number of

but it smacked of sensationalism.
One charge seemed most
unfair, but on closer inspection,
most true. "A certain number of
our readers are afraid of the
truth," wrote Wascher. Yes, in a
culture for violence where realism
is a catalyst, we are afraid of too
much of it.

Now that Jim Wascher has
neatly and "rationally" picked off
the arguments against explicit
reporting (Daily, Oct. 28), it's
time for a rational rebuttal.
Wascher had easy tinder to
quell concern for the family,
emotional appeals after all. But
sentiment aside, there are reasons,
good reasons, for not printing all
of the facts all of the time.
Wascher spoke of the public's
"right to learn ~. precisely what
happened." The word "precisely"
needs to be defined, but even
lacking a Consensus, it's not clear
how a university community is
better alerted to a member's
assassination by being told she
was sexually molested, much less
how.
Last year, we learned a physics
student had been stabbed outside
the Undergraduate Library;
knowing that the fatal blade had
entered between the fourth and
fifth rib on the left side (if it had)
would not have enhanced our
terror.
Fact Frightening
It was the fact of David
Levine's death that frightened us;
it is the fact of Arlis Perry's death
that frightens us still, and grieves
her parents, far more than the
circumstances. The implication, in
one sentence or one headline, that
someone out there in the dark was
prepared to kill, is enough to
make us wary.
It is fatuous of the Daily or its
advocates to take • credit, as
Wascher asserted, for making
people "a little bit more cautious
each night" by telling "as much of
the truth as we know."
If anything, the Daily's
advertisements of the crime's
specifics to some, a glorification
has caused us to have to be a bit
more cautious.
Media Inspired Violence
No one has proved
incontrovertibly that media
violence inspires more violence,
but the evidence is strong enough
for Stanford to build an entire
institute around its further
investigation the Institute for
Communications Research, part
of the Communications
Department with which the Daily

staff has no small liaison.
Now that those who delight in
vivid descriptions have studied
the murderer's methods, what
ingenious variations on the theme
might they concoct? A few
friends and I have come up with
some, which in the interests of
good journalism we should
perhaps ennumerate. But we fear
putting ideas into anyone's head.
Wascher's main thrust,
condensed in the title "Explicit
Facts Crush Falsehoods," is
indisputable when facts and
falsehoods confront. But separate
the best intentioned reader from a
police statement, and he can three
minutes later relate the story in
more living color than the
offender might have dreamed.
Newspaper facts may diminish
"incendiary rumors," but they
don't guarantee their demise.
'Right To Know'
We are indebted to journalists
for our "right to know." But on a

philosophical level, that right's
very existence can be debated.
The constitution and the press
invented, elevated and
perpetuated what is really a
privilege; Thomas Jefferson
notwithstanding, it is alienable.
While on the one hand, this
argues for taking all the liberties
possible to reinforce freedom of
the press, on the other, it reminds
us that we can't operate from the
premise of god-given carte
blanche.
What all this comes down to is
that newspapers must monitor
themselves, first locating whom
they are responding to in their
"responsibility." The fine line
Wascher cited between discretion
and covering up is difficult to
pinpoint because it's actually a
shade of grey. If we insist on
blacks and whites, steadfastly
refusing to temper statements,.we
may lose the spirit of the quest,

inadvertently hurting those we
mean to champion.
it must be asked, to whom or
what do the lurid details speak
the noble in us or some other
animal, thrill seeker. Criminal?
Ahd in journalists themselves, a
small creature called lust for
preeminence?
The Daily may be playing a
one-upmanship game without
realizing it. Blood and guts, as
KGO-TV news' 58 percent rating
has amply shown, sells editions.
