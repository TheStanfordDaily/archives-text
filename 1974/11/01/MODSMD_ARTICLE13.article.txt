# For More Like Thai

### Earl Martin 
My wife and I are much
heartened by the campaign of the
Stanford student body with
respect to inviting Nguyen Huu
Thai, Saigon political prisoner, to
be guest lecturer at Stanford for
one year.
Stanford's action is a
significant moral boost to those in
this country struggling for
democratic freedoms and release
from the oppression of Saigon's
pervasive prison system.
In our work here in South
Vietnam, my wife and I
frequently come in contact with
numerous persons who, like Thai,
have been imprisoned merely for
espousing the goals of nearly all
Vietnamese people: peace, justice,
and independence.
Within the past two weeks here
in just one province of South
Vietnam, we have learned of a
woman who was imprisoned
because her husband returned to
territory controlled by the

Provisional Revolutionary
Government, another woman
arrested and beaten severely
because she bought plastic
material at a local market and was
without evidence accused of
supplying the PRG, and numerous
students who were arrested after
an anti-Thieu demonstration.
We witnessed a student being
shot in the leg by charging police
trying to disperse a political rally.
Perhaps it is not needful to say
that all the actions of these
"guilty" parties are undisputedly
permitted under the terms of the
Paris Peace Agreement on
Vietnam.
You probably realize that your
struggle vis a vis Thai and Saigon's
many thousands of political
prisoners has just begun. We urge
you to follow through by seeking
the support of sympathetic U.S.
Congressmen, and by bringing
effective persuasion to bear on the
State Department and the

American Embassy in Saigon.
No one here in South Vietnam
has any doubts that if the U.S.
government were to make
continued aid to the Saigon
regime contingent on the release
of Saigon's political prisoners,
those men and women (and
children) behind bars would
immediately breathe free air
again.
As a Stanford alumnus, as a
fellow human being, I urge you to
follow through the noble course
you have begun.
