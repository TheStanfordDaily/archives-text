Advisers Helpful
Editor:
I am gratified that the
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Studies is concerned with the
revision and improvement of the
undergraduate advising program,
but I wonder how accurate his
conceptions of it are.
Certainly they bear no relation
to my own experience, which is
that not only my own adviser, but
all the advisers in my dorm, have
been more than eager to help me,
with choosing courses, with
choosing majors, with coping with
bureaucracy.
It would not have been "truth
in packaging" for the Admissions
Office to tell me I "wouldn't get
much help here in the way of
advising." And while Stanford's
literature did not give me the
impression I could "easily develop
one-to-one relationships" with
professors here, I did in fact find
something like that the case. My
first quarter here, I took two
lecture courses of 250 and 530
students each, the latter taught
( by two professors.
( Before half the term had gone
by, all of my teachers knew me by
| name, and each seemed not only
' willing but happy to talk to me
both after class and in their
offices (even at times outside
their office hours).
This experience is certainly
i atypical in that these professors
; didn't know everyone's name in
; those lecture classes, but it was
i clear to me that a willingness to
i respond to student initiative was
: there.
This has been a constant in all
my courses; while not all my
| quarters have been as
! "spectacular" as that one in
; achieving faculty-student
' interaction, this has invariably
' been due to my own choice not to
take an initiative in a given class.
In sum, my own experience is
exactly what the student
comments in Approaching
Stanford led me to expect: that a
moderate effort at interacting
■ with faculty is usually met with
an openness that seems almost
disproportionate.

Prop. 11 'Frivolous'
Editor:
Upon reading your editorial *
(Daily Oct. 29), I was very
surprised by the endorsement of
Prop. 11. Amidst all the screaming
of the women's liberation
movement comes a proposition
which makes a mockery of what
they're fighting for. i
Was this indulgence in trivia
the best proposition they could
produce? If this is so, then, may I
suggest that it's all over. The cause
is won congratulations! At this
point it would make a farce out of
the movement to indulge in such
trite banality. Whereas if they feel
it is not over they should refrain
from propositions which ridicule
an otherwise good cause.
When the Governor is a woman
then the wording of the law can
be changed accordingly. Until
then, women should fight for
their rights if they feel they are
being deprived, but not by
producing frivolous propositions.

Response On Doda
Editor:
I would like to respond to the
article by Terri Borchers (Daily,
Oct. 25) concerning my Carol *
Doda story (Oct. 23). >'
My purpose in writing feature
stories is to entertain and
enlighten. I often write about
celebrated people and what they
are doing. I do this because many
people are interested in the i
different life-styles of others.
It is a sad comment on society
that a woman makes a living by
exposing her breasts. But Carol
Doda does precisely that. And she
does it within 30 minutes of
Stanford. .
My story described what Carol
Doda does and told what she has
to say. As disgusting and
exploitative as it may be, her
breasts did "sway from side to
side across the piano top," and
that was what people were
"sitting and ogling" about. f
Attacking the story as sexist
and disgusting will not remove the
absurdity of Carol Doda's
performance from society. But
writing about it will at least make
people more aware of the sexist
activities which still pervade. 4
I am disappointed that Terri
Borchers did not understand my
intentions as a feature writer. I
would have thought she could
abandon her seriousness for a
moment and interpret some subtle
humor.
But then I remembered. Terri
Borchers is just a girl.

Prop. 11 'Frivolous'
Editor:
Upon reading your editorial *
(Daily Oct. 29), I was very
surprised by the endorsement of
Prop. 11. Amidst all the screaming
of the women's liberation
movement comes a proposition
which makes a mockery of what
they're fighting for. i
Was this indulgence in trivia
the best proposition they could
produce? If this is so, then, may I
suggest that it's all over. The cause
is won congratulations! At this
point it would make a farce out of
the movement to indulge in such
trite banality. Whereas if they feel
it is not over they should refrain
from propositions which ridicule
an otherwise good cause.
When the Governor is a woman
then the wording of the law can
be changed accordingly. Until
then, women should fight for
their rights if they feel they are
being deprived, but not by
producing frivolous propositions.

Response On Doda
Editor:
I would like to respond to the
article by Terri Borchers (Daily,
Oct. 25) concerning my Carol *
Doda story (Oct. 23). >'
My purpose in writing feature
stories is to entertain and
enlighten. I often write about
celebrated people and what they
are doing. I do this because many
people are interested in the i
different life-styles of others.
It is a sad comment on society
that a woman makes a living by
exposing her breasts. But Carol
Doda does precisely that. And she
does it within 30 minutes of
Stanford. .
My story described what Carol
Doda does and told what she has
to say. As disgusting and
exploitative as it may be, her
breasts did "sway from side to
side across the piano top," and
that was what people were
"sitting and ogling" about. f
Attacking the story as sexist
and disgusting will not remove the
absurdity of Carol Doda's
performance from society. But
writing about it will at least make
people more aware of the sexist
activities which still pervade. 4
I am disappointed that Terri
Borchers did not understand my
intentions as a feature writer. I
would have thought she could
abandon her seriousness for a
moment and interpret some subtle
humor.
But then I remembered. Terri
Borchers is just a girl.

Advisers Helpful
Editor:
I am gratified that the
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Studies is concerned with the

conceptions of it are.
Certainly they bear no relation
to my own experience, which is
that not only my own adviser, but
all the advisers in my dorm, have
been more than eager to help me,
with choosing courses, with
choosing majors, with coping with
bureaucracy.
It would not have been "truth
in packaging" for the Admissions
Office to tell me I "wouldn't get
much help here in the way of
advising." And while Stanford's
literature did not give me the
impression I could "easily develop
one-to-one relationships" with
professors here, I did in fact find
something like that the case. My

Editor:
Upon reading your editorial *
(Daily Oct. 29), I was very
surprised by the endorsement of
Prop. 11. Amidst all the screaming
of the women's liberation
movement comes a proposition
which makes a mockery of what
they're fighting for. i
Was this indulgence in trivia
the best proposition they could
produce? If this is so, then, may I
suggest that it's all over. The cause
is won congratulations! At this
point it would make a farce out of
the movement to indulge in such
trite banality. Whereas if they feel
it is not over they should refrain
from propositions which ridicule
an otherwise good cause.
When the Governor is a woman
then the wording of the law can
be changed accordingly. Until
then, women should fight for
their rights if they feel they are
being deprived, but not by
producing frivolous propositions.

Response On Doda
Editor:
I would like to respond to the
article by Terri Borchers (Daily,
Oct. 25) concerning my Carol *
Doda story (Oct. 23). >'
My purpose in writing feature
stories is to entertain and
enlighten. I often write about
celebrated people and what they
are doing. I do this because many
people are interested in the i
different life-styles of others.
It is a sad comment on society
that a woman makes a living by
exposing her breasts. But Carol
Doda does precisely that. And she
does it within 30 minutes of
Stanford. .
My story described what Carol
Doda does and told what she has
to say. As disgusting and
exploitative as it may be, her
breasts did "sway from side to
side across the piano top," and
that was what people were
"sitting and ogling" about. f
Attacking the story as sexist
and disgusting will not remove the
absurdity of Carol Doda's
performance from society. But
writing about it will at least make
people more aware of the sexist
activities which still pervade. 4
I am disappointed that Terri
Borchers did not understand my
intentions as a feature writer. I
would have thought she could
abandon her seriousness for a
moment and interpret some subtle
humor.
But then I remembered. Terri
Borchers is just a girl.
