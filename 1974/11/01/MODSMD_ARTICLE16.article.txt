# A 						Demonstration, 1974 Style? Well... It Just Isn't Quite What It Used To Be

### TERRY ANZUR 
What? Protest in 1974?
Marine recruiting officers came to the
Career Planning and Placement Center on
Wednesday to conduct interviews. A new
organization called the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC) announced plans for "mass
picketing and a rally."
No one knew what to expect.

Many students, en route from morning
classes to lunch, paused as they passed by the
Placement Center. Because picket signs and
protest charts are not the normal sights and
sounds of White Plaza at noon, it wasn't
surprising that they stopped.
It was surprising that many of them stayed.
By the time the speeches started at 12:30,
150 people were listening. The organizers of
the rally were surprised. "The response was
better than we expected," said ARC member
Seth Foldy.
"People are finally being able to come

together for organized activities after being
scattered by McGovern's defeat in 1972,"
Foldy continued. He described the ARC as
"an umbrella organization for radical
individuals on campus," and noted that many
of its 20 hard-core and 70 part-time members
were "involved in anti-war demonstrations
several years ago."
Even so, many of the 80 demonstrators
who marched outside the placement center at
noon seemed impressed with the novelty of an
on-campus protest.
Somebody started a chant; "One, two,
three, four; Kick Marines out the door." It
was just catching on when somebody who
might have remembered an earlier anti-war
version of the chant shouted, "Come on, you
guys, we've got to get some serious slogans."
About half of the marchers carried signs;
the other half carried textbooks. The
Placement Center was locked and the Marines
had gone out to lunch, but the marchers kept

marching, laughing and talking together.
"Be serious," somebody said. "We've got
to keep poker faces."
The audience heard ARC member Helen
Chauncey say, "Stanford is responsible for
things you don't see in Courses and Degrees,
including "projects directly applicable to
off-shore bombing in Vietnam."
Demonstrators stepped aside, allowing the
Marines to enter the building. Students
clapped their hands to protest songs that
touched on multi-national corporations,
women's lib, and the deficiences of Stanford.
According to Foldy, the ARC plans to take
action for the removal of union lettuce from
campus food services, and to protest
"substantial contracts between Hoover
Institute and the CIA."
But the general mood of 1974-style protest
was summed up by Marine First Lt. Robert
Grice. "Protest is aggravating," he said, "but it
does liven up the day."
