# Campaign Winds To Finish-And It's As Boring As Ever
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
In the home stretch, California's state
election campaign shows few signs of altering
its -pattern of the last several months or of
particularly inspiring the voters.
Democratic gubernatorial nominee
Edmund G. Brown Jr., installed as the
frontrunner immediately after the June
primary, appears to be holding a comfortable
lead over Republican rival Houston Flournoy.
And, riding on Brown's coattails, Democrats

appear to be leading in virtually all other
statewide races.
According to the polls, only incumbent
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger among the
Republicans is leading his Democratic
opponent, attorney William Norris. For the
other GOP candidates, their struggles range
from the merely uphill controller candidate
William Bagley, trailing Democrat Kenneth
Cory by a few percentage points to the
nearly hopeless U.S. Senate nominee H.L.
Richardson, making little progress against
incumbent Alan Cranston.
Democrats could be forgiven if they felt a
certain sense of deja vu. In 1958, with another
Edmund G. Brown heading the ticket, the
Democrats swept every office save one,
defeated an incumbent governor running for
the senate and an incumbent senator running
for governor.
Four years later, they matched their
previous sweep as Brown defeated Richard M.
Nixon in the main event.
Comparison Ends
But there the comparison with-1974 ends.
For one thing, 1958 Democrats were reversing
an historical trend by electing only their
second governor since 1894. And for another,
in both 1958 and 1962, the Democratic and
Republican gubernatorial candidates differed
on basic ideological grounds.
This year, though, the Democrats are
flexing their muscles as the majority party in
the state. And perhaps more important,
neither Brown nor Flournoy have articulated
issues that provide a clear ideological cutting
edge. The fact is that the two major party
nominees haven't held such similar views since
Earl Warren won both nominations nearly 30
years ago.
Both candidates, to varying degrees, have
differed significantly with the programs of

departing Gov. Ronald Reagan. Both have
come out for election reform, increased social
welfare programs and increased activity in the
area of pollution control.
Both are reasonably young (Brown is 3
Flournoy4s), both currently hold state offit 1
(Brown is secretary of state, Flournoy
controller) and both represent the liberal
wings of their parties. \
Intangibles \
As a result of their similarities, the race has \
revolved more around intangibles, things like
image and the ever-elusive "charisma." And
it's on that count that Brown holds his lead.
Variously characterized as "cool," "aloof,"
"arrogant," and "slick," Brown nonetheless
moved to establish himself early as a forthright,
although sometimes self-righteous, crusader.
Flournoy, on the other hand, has tried to
turn his low-key style into an asset, complete
with using his family in homey media spots to
convey his "family man" message (Brown is a
bachelor). Even Flournoy's most pungent spot
is fairly low-key: "My name is Houston
Flournoy. Houston Flournoy. I repeat my
name because Jerry Brown seems to be
running, against Ronald Reagan and Richard
Nixon."
But neither candidate has really been able
to stir the electorate. As the Los Angeles
Times noted this week in declining to endorse
either candidate, the two are close enough so
that "moderate, progressive" Californians
won't really lose if either is elected. And that
lack of conflict may have proven, well, dull.
Along those lines, perhaps television host
Johnny Carson delivered the appropriate
closing line of the campaign this week. "I
asked Tommy Newsom what he *tn ~
about Flournoy," he said. "Tommy said "
would help fight cavities, he was for it."

Both are reasonably young (Brown is 3
Flournoy4s), both currently hold state offit 1
(Brown is secretary of state, Flournoy
controller) and both represent the liberal
wings of their parties. \
Intangibles \
As a result of their similarities, the race has \
revolved more around intangibles, things like
image and the ever-elusive "charisma." And
it's on that count that Brown holds his lead.
Variously characterized as "cool," "aloof,"
"arrogant," and "slick," Brown nonetheless
moved to establish himself early as a forthright,
although sometimes self-righteous, crusader.
Flournoy, on the other hand, has tried to
turn his low-key style into an asset, complete
with using his family in homey media spots to
convey his "family man" message (Brown is a
bachelor). Even Flournoy's most pungent spot
is fairly low-key: "My name is Houston
Flournoy. Houston Flournoy. I repeat my
name because Jerry Brown seems to be
running, against Ronald Reagan and Richard
Nixon."
But neither candidate has really been able
to stir the electorate. As the Los Angeles
Times noted this week in declining to endorse
either candidate, the two are close enough so
that "moderate, progressive" Californians
won't really lose if either is elected. And that
lack of conflict may have proven, well, dull.
Along those lines, perhaps television host
Johnny Carson delivered the appropriate
closing line of the campaign this week. "I
asked Tommy Newsom what he *tn ~
about Flournoy," he said. "Tommy said "
would help fight cavities, he was for it."
In the home stretch, California's state
election campaign shows few signs of altering
its -pattern of the last several months or of
particularly inspiring the voters.
Democratic gubernatorial nominee
Edmund G. Brown Jr., installed as the
frontrunner immediately after the June
primary, appears to be holding a comfortable
lead over Republican rival Houston Flournoy.
And, riding on Brown's coattails, Democrats

appear to be leading in virtually all other
statewide races.
According to the polls, only incumbent
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger among the
Republicans is leading his Democratic
opponent, attorney William Norris. For the
other GOP candidates, their struggles range
from the merely uphill controller candidate
William Bagley, trailing Democrat Kenneth
Cory by a few percentage points to the
nearly hopeless U.S. Senate nominee H.L.
Richardson, making little progress against
incumbent Alan Cranston.
Democrats could be forgiven if they felt a
certain sense of deja vu. In 1958, with another
Edmund G. Brown heading the ticket, the
Democrats swept every office save one,
defeated an incumbent governor running for
the senate and an incumbent senator running
for governor.
Four years later, they matched their
previous sweep as Brown defeated Richard M.
Nixon in the main event.
Comparison Ends
But there the comparison with-1974 ends.
For one thing, 1958 Democrats were reversing
an historical trend by electing only their
second governor since 1894. And for another,
in both 1958 and 1962, the Democratic and
Republican gubernatorial candidates differed
on basic ideological grounds.
This year, though, the Democrats are
flexing their muscles as the majority party in
the state. And perhaps more important,
neither Brown nor Flournoy have articulated
issues that provide a clear ideological cutting
edge. The fact is that the two major party
nominees haven't held such similar views since
Earl Warren won both nominations nearly 30
years ago.
Both candidates, to varying degrees, have
differed significantly with the programs of

departing Gov. Ronald Reagan. Both have
come out for election reform, increased social
welfare programs and increased activity in the
area of pollution control.
Both are reasonably young (Brown is 3
Flournoy4s), both currently hold state offit 1
(Brown is secretary of state, Flournoy
controller) and both represent the liberal
wings of their parties. \
