# ASSU Presidents Have A Decent Batting Average
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The current ASSU Council of
Presidents won election last spring on
the strength of 13 general goals the
slate proposed during its campaign.
Some of those proposals have been
modified, but six months later
substantive work has begun on almost '
all of them.
ASSU President Mike Herman says
he is proud of the COP's
accomplishments to date.
"Right now, I'm very pleased with
the way things are going," Herman
noted. "We thought, during the
campaign, that we could accomplish
everything in the booklet; I feel we
can still fulfill everything in that
booklet."
"That booklet" was a 40-page
collection of specific campaign
proposals by the Herman slate. It
included statements on The Bulletin,
the Stanford Student Store, ASSU
Lecture Notes, ASSU Course Review,
Special Events, an Intellectual Union,
a gubernatorial candidates' debate,
University committees, undergraduate
education, a residential college, . a
graduate student union, women's
affairs and land use.
Services
Herman said he was most pleased
with the COP's work in the student
services including the lecture notes,
The Bulletin , a residential study
program and the Stanford Student
Store.
"We have emphasized student
services," he added, "but I think we

have made tremendous progress in the
non-services parts of the booklet,
including Special Events and
committees."
On several planks of their platform,
the Herman ticket merely made
position statements rather than
specific suggestions for change; others
called for only minor action.
Progress in the major fields of
concern by the COP has varied -
—The Bulletin. The third edition of
this listing of campus events will be
distributed today. Carter said its
biggest problem stems from students
not submitting material.
'Reading It'
"We want people to realize that
students are reading it... . We want

people who haven't put things in to
put them in," Carter said.
—The Stanford Student Store.
Carter and ASSU Vice President Len
Mackey have been negotiating with the
Bookstore for space to start up a
record co-op. Herman says a "major
announcement" on the status of the
co-op will be forthcoming "within the
next two weeks."
—Lecture notes. The . ASSU is
taking a half-page ad in today's Daily
to announce openings for notetakers.
with a listing of classes qualifying for
the service, Herman said. Graduate
student notetakers will receive $6 per
50-minute class, undergraduates onlyn
$5.25.
"We-expect fewer applications from
graduates," Herman explained. "So we
want to encourage them to apply."
—Special Events. "Special Events I
think we can be quite proud of,
actually," Herman commented. Of six
concerts held since the present COP
took office, all but" one sold out. The
non-sellout, a Seals & CrOfts concert
held two weeks before the start of
autumn quarter, sold 8500 tickets and
made a profit.
Fee Assessment Junked
The Herman slate proposed a $1
per quarter fee assessment for Special
Events and recommended that surveys
be sent out each quarter to sample
student interest in concerts. The
surveys have been sent, but the fee
assessment proposal has been dumped.
"We were fearful that Special
Events was getting a very bad name on

campus because of concerts such as
Hot Tuna," Herman remarked. "We
thought the fee assessment might be
necessary to insure that the program
had enough cash."
—lntellectual Union. This proposal,
which would set up a club to
coordinate speakers' and visitors'
activities with special benefits to
members, has been put on the back
burner, according to Herman.
"I think our basic pressure right
now should be to strengthen existing
programs rather than start new ones
[for speakers, visitors, and
guests-in-residence]," Herman said. "I
don't think the idea of an Intellectual
Union has gone by the wayside at all.
There are other priorities now."

—Gubernatorial candidates debate.
This proposal urged the ASSU to
invite candidates in gubernatorial
primaries to debate on campus. This
program had to be abandoned,
Herman claimed.
Refusal
"Both of the two leading
candidates were, by the time we took
office, so far ahead of the rest of the
field that they refused to participate,"
Herman said.
—University committees. Herman,
Carter, Mackey and ASSU Vice
President Quinn Mayer set as "top
priority" the appointment of a
University committee staff assistant to
act as a liaison between elected ASSU
officials and appointed committee
members.
Sophomore Jan Havens got the
position, and will make her first report
on the status of University committees
to the ASSU Senate on Monday.
—Residential college. During the
campaign, the Herman ticket pledged
themselves to "negotiating with the
dean of undergraduate studies and the
dean of student affairs" on a
residential college. The initial proposal
was offered before those
administrators had been contacted,
and Herman caught a lot of flak.
Herman and the proposal's
co-author, anthropology graduate
student Tom Glenn, rewrote the plan
and presented it again.
TTie proposal is more
toned-down in language than the
original campaign proposal, referring

to a "residential study program"
rather than 3 "residential college"
Financial problems have plagued the
proposal, and negotiations with
administrators have put the price tag
at about $lO,OOO, Herman says. One
possible source of revenue is the
provost's office.
"We have spoken at great length to
the provost, and he has assured us
that, after we have [spoken to]
faculty members who would be
involved, he will talk to us about
funding," Herman remarked.
Herman hopes plans for the
residential study program will be
completed by Feb. 1, 1975 in time
for inclusion in the 1975 Spring Draw
booklet.
