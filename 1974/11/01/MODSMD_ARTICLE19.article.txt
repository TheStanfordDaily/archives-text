# Local Issues Determine Race In 21st District
## 
### MARK FUNK 
With both candidates stressing
extensive backgrounds in local
and regional government, the 21st
District Assembly race between
Victor Calvo and Clarence A.
Jackson Jr. has been shaped by
community oriented issues.
In the new district which
includes the Stanford campus,
Democrats hold a 54.4 percent to
38.8 percent registration
advantage over Republicans.
Democratic party leaders are
optimistic Calvo will win.
With no incumbent, Calvo, a
Santa Clara County supervisor,
and his Republican opponent
Jackson, a Lockheed employee,
were expected to wage a
wide-open campaign. Thus far,
however, few. differences in policy
have arisen between the two.
Both candidates urge a return
to "grassroots government."

Jackson has promised that if
elected, he will improve the
"pipeline" between government
and the people.
"We must have a mechanism
for receiving input from citizens,"
Jackson said. "To improve our
governmental processes, it is
necessary for citizens to
participate at all levels of policy
making." He emphasized that this
was especially true among young
voters.
Confidence In Government
Calvo called for a return of
trust in government. "My whole
candidacy is based on being able
to conduct an open office," he
said.
"The return of trust and
confidence in government should
be the. legislature's first order of
business," he continued. "To
insure this, it is essential that we
enact proper conflict of interest

and campaign controls."
Mass transit is a prominent
issue in both camp's platforms.
Tying the issue to the
environment, Calvo said, "An
efficient multi-modal public
transportation system for our
urban areas is a priority need." He
added that it was essential to
maintain "a vigilant attitude"
toward urban environment.
Jackson, too, favors mass
transit in Santa Clara County and
specifically urged that the
Dumbarton Bridge be redesigned.

"The old bridge is unsafe," he
explained. "The new bridge
should be constructed to support
a mass transit system."
However, he too went on to
say that "a very delicate balance
should be maintained in order to
protect and not offend natural
beauty, yet allow for urban
growth."
Difference Over Inflation
The greatest policy difference
is over inflation. Jackson
advocated a reduction in
government spending in an effort
to fight it. "We must also have
some form of tax relief," he said.
Calvo, noting that uncontrolled
inflation is forcing people who are
"least able" to adjust in society
out of "educational, housing and
job opportunities," advocated
that the state assembly formulate
"necessary remedial legislation" in
an effort of cope with the
problem.
Calvo, a Stanford graduate, has
been a member of the board of
supervisors since 1968. Prior to
his election to that post he served
nine years in the Mountain View
city gbvernment, culminating in a
stint as mayor.
Qualified Candidates
During Calvo's tenure as
supervisor, he represented the area
on a number of committees,
including the Bay Conservation

and Development Commission,
the Association of Bay Area
Governments and the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control.
Calvo also heads up the Santa
Clara County Transit District.
Jackson, a prominent black
leader from East Palo Alto, was
instrumental in the formation of
that unincorporated area's
municipal council and served on it
since 1968. He also served as
mayor for one year.
In addition to his work on the
East Palo Alto Municipal Council,
Jackson serves on the San Mateo
County Redevelopment
Commission, the San Mateo
County Delinquency Prevention
Commission and the San Mateo
County Juvenile Justice
Commission.

to fight it. "We must also have
some form of tax relief," he said.
Calvo, noting that uncontrolled
inflation is forcing people who are

out of "educational, housing and
job opportunities," advocated
that the state assembly formulate
"necessary remedial legislation" in
an effort of cope with the
problem.

Victor Calvo


Clarence Jackson
With both candidates stressing
extensive backgrounds in local
and regional government, the 21st
District Assembly race between
Victor Calvo and Clarence A.
Jackson Jr. has been shaped by
community oriented issues.
In the new district which
includes the Stanford campus,
Democrats hold a 54.4 percent to
38.8 percent registration
advantage over Republicans.
Democratic party leaders are
optimistic Calvo will win.
With no incumbent, Calvo, a
Santa Clara County supervisor,
and his Republican opponent
Jackson, a Lockheed employee,
were expected to wage a
wide-open campaign. Thus far,
however, few. differences in policy
have arisen between the two.
Both candidates urge a return
to "grassroots government."

Jackson has promised that if
elected, he will improve the
"pipeline" between government
and the people.
"We must have a mechanism
for receiving input from citizens,"
Jackson said. "To improve our
governmental processes, it is
necessary for citizens to
participate at all levels of policy
making." He emphasized that this
was especially true among young
voters.
Confidence In Government
Calvo called for a return of
trust in government. "My whole
candidacy is based on being able
to conduct an open office," he
said.
"The return of trust and
confidence in government should
be the. legislature's first order of
business," he continued. "To
insure this, it is essential that we
enact proper conflict of interest

and campaign controls."
Mass transit is a prominent
issue in both camp's platforms.
Tying the issue to the
environment, Calvo said, "An
efficient multi-modal public
transportation system for our
urban areas is a priority need." He
added that it was essential to
maintain "a vigilant attitude"
toward urban environment.
Jackson, too, favors mass
transit in Santa Clara County and
specifically urged that the
Dumbarton Bridge be redesigned.

"The old bridge is unsafe," he
explained. "The new bridge
should be constructed to support
a mass transit system."
However, he too went on to
say that "a very delicate balance
should be maintained in order to
protect and not offend natural
beauty, yet allow for urban
growth."
Difference Over Inflation
The greatest policy difference
is over inflation. Jackson
advocated a reduction in
government spending in an effort
to fight it. "We must also have
some form of tax relief," he said.
Calvo, noting that uncontrolled
inflation is forcing people who are
"least able" to adjust in society
