## DeBakey Asks Medical Funding 
### ED MATHENY 
Renowned surgeon Dr. Michael
Deßakey called for increased
governmental funding for medical
research vital to a healthy, productive
society in a speech to 300 people at
Cubberley Auditorium last night.
"It is no coincidence," Deßakey
said, "that the healthiest people are
the most imaginative, and that the
healthiest nations are usually the
strongest and the most influential."
Unhealthy societies, he noted, tend to
be weak, economically unstable,
morally feeble and intellectually and
culturally oppressed.
"Our major social problems today
crime, poverty, overpopulation, civil

disorder, alcoholism and drug
addiction are all intimately related
to physical, mental and emotional
health," Deßakey said. The solution to
such problems, he concluded, is a
social responsibility.
Low Priority
In this country, however, medical
research is assigned a low priority in
government funding, he said. "We
spend less than $7 per person in
federal tax money for all medical
research," in contrast with $4OO spent
on defense, $4O spent on highways
and $3O on space exploration.
"From my standpoint, and from
the standpoint of the patient, these
priorities are a lie," Deßakey said.

Such priorities must be reassigned "if
we are to become a healthier people."
Deßakey, considered a pioneer in
cardiovascular surgery, is president of
Baylor College of Medicine.
While still a medical student, he
devised a pump which years later
became an essential component of the
heart-lung machine which made
open-heart surgery possible. Since
then, he has developed over 50 surgical
instruments.
Too Little Money
According to Deßakey, the United
States spends $BO billion annually on
health care, and only a small fraction
of this amount goes to medical
research. "In any of the science-based
industries," he argued, "to remain a
viable industry you must spend
something on the order of 10 to 20
percent of your expenditures on
research. If you extend this to health
care, we should be spending perhaps
five to six times what we're spending
today."
"In light of the benefits of research
in reducing the cost of health care and
making it more efficient, it seems to
me that priority deserves a higher
assignment," Deßakey said.
Deßakey also discussed
arteriolosclerosis as a subject of
medical research. "We don't know its
cause," Deßakey said, "but
statistically it has been shown that
there are certain factors, which we call
risk factors, that increase the risk of
developing it." One of these is
cholesterol; others are high blood
pressure and smoking.
Heredity is also a factor, Deßakey
added, but it is not as important as
one might think. "Arteriolosclerosis is
so common that you'll find it in every
family," he said.

OPEN HEART—Celebrated surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey stressed to a
Cubberley Auditorium crowd last night that the federal government must spend
considerably more for the medical research it presently assigns a low priority.
