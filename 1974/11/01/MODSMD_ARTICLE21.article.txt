# Skylab Boosts Energy Hopes

### 
Spectacular photographs of the
sun taken by Skylab astronauts
have provided a better
understanding of thermonuclear
fusion and could speed
development of a limitless new
energy source for earth, scientists
noted yesterday.
At a conference on Skylab
results in Huntsville, Ala., a team
of experts reported, "By lifting a
battery of telescopes above the
earth's obscuring atmosphere and
providing the filters and sensors
required to peer directly at the
explosive surface of the sun,
Skylab has given the first real
insight into its activity that
governs the function of the solar
system."
They said the photographs and
other data gathered by the three
Skylab astronaut teams last year
and early this year have increased
science's knowledge of the sun by

a hundred-fold.
According to Stanford
scientist-engineer Dr. Owen K.
Garriott, who spent two months
in Skylab II during the summer of
1973, increased knowledge of the
sun is not the only
accomplishment of the Skylab
mission.
"Many of the roles in which
man has participated in research
aboard Skylab will again be
important in future space
activities such as the Space
Shuttle," he said. "Hopefully, the
results presented here may spur
the imaginations of those planning
control experiments / for the
Shuttle and result in a more
optimum meld of personal and
automatic control."
In a recent issue of Science
magazine, Garriott offers some
personal impressions of the
zero-gravity experience that are
usually unreported in official

versions.
"In the first few days," he
writes, "most persons do not feel
completely comfortable, in much
the same way that people are
bothered (more or less) on the
first few days at sea.
"Of the nine Skylab crewmen,
two did reach the point of
vomiting on the first or second
day in orbit, but at no time were
they unable to carry out any
essential activities."
One of the strangest
phenomena of weightlessness, that
of getting used to living without
any "up" or "down," seemed not
to bother the Skylab astronauts.
Customarily they slept in what,
on earth, would be a vertical
position, sometimes with their
heads at the bottom.
"There appear to be no
psychological problems associated
with the lack of clearly
established 'vertical' or
'horizontal' orientation," said
Garriott.
"In fact, one automatically
adjusts his impression of 'up' to
conform to his own body
orientation quite readily. I found '
sleep a very pleasant experience,
achieved easily and fully restful.
"Manual coordination
functions posed no problems at all
for the crewmen with one notable
exception. Reaching or handling
objects was entirely normal, as
long as visual contact was
maintained."
Garriott reports that there have
not been any sustained health
problems encountered by crew
members as a result of the
mission.
"Upon . . .return to earth, all nine
crewmen were in good condition
and able to walk unaided," he
said. "However, the sense of
balance of each crewman was
clearly not functioning normally.
"Some of us noticed
tenderness in the knee and ankle
joints and some muscle soreness
for a few weeks, but this
condition then gradually
disappeared. After a few months,
there appeared to be no residual
symptoms of any kind."
