## How Blue Can You Get? Robben Ford On Way To Stardom 
### Dan Forte 
Anticipating the wave of articles on the upcoming George Harrison
tour describing the former-Beatle's "new discovery" on guitar, the
following is designed to introduce the unenlightened to a truly great
artist, Robben Ford.
Early in 1971, I went to Keystone Korner to catch blues harpist
Charlie Musselwhite and his band.
Since then I've seen Charlie perform more times than I can
remember, but that night still stands out as one of his best, largely
thanks to the fine band he had during that period.
Two fifths of the band consisted of a pair of brothers from Ukiah,
California; Pat and Robben Ford, at that time 22 and 19 respectively.
A Little Vocals
Besides supplying Charlie with some fine blues licks, Robben sang
occasionally, and later in the set switched to alto sax for some unique
unison-duets with Charlie's harp.
, Between sets, Robben sat at the piano amusing himself, obviously
no stranger to the keyboard. While his guitar playing during the first
set was reminiscent of 8.8. King and Mike Bloomfield, the little jazzy
tidbits he threw out while tuning up were more along the lines of a
Kenny Burrell or a Wes Montgomery.
Joining the band for a number at the beginning of the next set was
the Ford's youngest brother, Mark, who proved to be a 17-year-old
harpist on a par with Charlie himself.
New Band
Obviously, the inevitable happened the gifted brothers formed
their own band, The Charles Ford Band, named for their father, a
retired Country & Western musician.
Fortunately, at that time the corner of University and High in Palo
Alto (now a vacant lot) housed the Bay Area's hippest club, In Your
Ear, and the Fords became a favorite attraction there.
To this day, I have not heard a blues band that could match them.
Besides playing stone Chicago blues with more life and intensity
than it had felt in perhaps 15 years, the band was progressive enough
to tluow in an occasional Coltrane or George Benson tune, without
losing their overall continuity.
Moved Master
On the same bill with Muddy Waters at Keystone Korner, the
master himself was so moved that he got up and sang with the group,
and later referred to Mark as another little Walter (!).
But, not willing to compromise their music to the extent necessary
for "success," the group dis-banded on New Year's Eve, less than a
year after its formation.
An Arhoolie LP was cut after the split, but, while a fine blues
recording in most respects, it only begins to hint at the band's

capabilities and uniqueness.
In an interview I did with Robben shortly before the break, he
named Jimmy Witherspoon as one of the first blues singers he'd ever
heard.
Makeshift Band
That spring, 1972, Spoon came to gig at the aforementioned In
Your Ear, and Robben was asked by the club owner to get some
people together to'serve as a backup band.
For the following two and a half years Spoon and Robben's band
were the most energetic, as well as sophisticated, blues act on the
scene.
Robben continued to incorporate more and more "jazzities" into
his playing. His own compositions, which served as warmups for the
"main man," had a free quality almost like those of Robben's idol,
John Coltrane. Audiences were soon turning out to hear these upfront
tunes as much as to hear Witherspoon.
When he occasionally did a solo concert, like the Bay Area Jazz
Festival's "Guitar Explosion" of 1973, Robben received high praise
for his "rock-blues" and "rock-jazz."
Little Rock
Actually, rock played a miniscule role in Robben's music, but most
critics simply weren't prepared for jazz and blues that was so
downright exciting. Jazz and blues were, after all, old folks music, so
how could it sound "youthful."
In a Guitar Player interview, just after leaving Spoon, Robben told
me he couldn't relate to rock music because of its hostility and
ugliness. "I like music that makes people happy, not music that makes
people want to boogie or makes people feel bad. And rock music
makes me feel bad; it irritates me physically."
Be that as it may, Robben nevertheless stepped into the rock field
about a month latdr. Jazz virtuoso Joe Pass recommended Robben to
reedman Tom Scott who was forming a band to back folk singer Joni
Mitchell.
Now . . . Harrison
This one thing-led-to-another career has now brought Robben, not
quite 23, to the upcoming George Harrison tour.
If the past is any indication, Robben should be able to earn a lot of
attention from press and public alike.
Career-wise this could result in any number of things. But,
hopefully it will mean that Robben will be able to create more of his
fine, original music, and be heard by that many more people who
would otherwise be left un-hip.
Robben's discography is now limited to the Charles Ford Band
album (Arhoolie 4005); and three Musselwhite LP's, Louisiana Fog
(Cherry Red 5102), and Takin'My Time (1056) and an upcoming LP,
both on Arhoolie. One record was cut during the Witherspoon period,
but the chances of it being released aren't very good.
