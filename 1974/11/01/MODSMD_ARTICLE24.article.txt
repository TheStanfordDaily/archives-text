Thin Lizzy
Vagabonds of the Western World
London XPS 636
"According to the Ancient
Legends of the Mythological
Cycle, they tell us of a Celtic
Otherworld to the West. A place
where happiness reigns. There is
no age or death, and a hundred
years are as one day."
So reads the beginning of
"Legend of the Vagabond," the
conceptualization of the title cut,
Vagabonds of the Western World.
Thin Lizzy has attempted through
Vagabond to portray the region of
the terrestial in which all things
are possible.
Musically cosmic
interpretations of other regions, be
they in the realm of visible
manifestations, or the mind, must
in the opinion of this reviewer,
relate some semblance of an
ethereal quality.

It is in this area that Vagabond
is seen to be lacking. Thin Lizzy
has bitten off more than it can
chew in trying to create an aural
statement of a terrestial nature
with extraterrestial qualities.
Indeed, the creativity necessary
for such an endeavor is not to be
found in this recording. The music
produced by this three man
guitar, percussion ensemble by
and large sounds like early Grand
Funk, without the funk.
However, the album is not
without merit. Cuts that come
across musically (with no
reference made to lyrical content)
are, "The Hero and the Madman"

and "The Rocker," both on side
one. "Hero,"invokes a unique
mood, while "Rocker" does
simply what the title implies.
Produced at Air London and
Decca Four at Tollington Park by
Philip Lynott, the group's bassist
and principal writer, Vagabonds
of the Western World as a total
effort comes off rather blandly.
The music lacks inspiration and
suffers from a chronic lack of
creativity. It appears that these
particular "Vagabonds" may be
destined to remain in relative
obscurity.

Raspberries
Starting Over
Capitol ST-11329
Since they emerged a couple of
years ago with a hit single, "Go
All the Way," the Raspberries
have never had a distinctive style

of their own. Their music on
Starting Over is a well-played
pastiche of many familiar rock
songs; sometimes the Raspberries
"original" numbers seem
uncomfortably close to older
world by the Who, while others
bear an uncanny resemblance to
songs by several other groups.
Veteran rock fans will have an
easy time picking out many
obvious models for
the Raspberries songs. For
starters, "All Through the Night"
has a guitar riff that is very Chuck
Berry, "Cruisin' Music" sounds
like it came almost straight off a
Beach Boys record and the

opening of "I Don't Know What I
Want" is nearly identical tothatof
the Who's "Won't Get Fooled
Again."
For all that, the music is
capably played. The neat vocal
harmonies are as tight as any
group's, and each of the four
Raspberries shows he is a capable
lead singer. Despity the lack of
instrumental breaks, the music is
seldom really boring; it is just that
the songs the Raspberries have so
proficiently imitated sound much
fresher in their original version^.
The album's two best
compositions, "Overnight
Sensation" and the title track,
show more than a little musical
similarity to the Who's "Next
album. Like the rest of the songs,
they are well executed; so well
that at times they almost sound
like the real thing.

Jackson Browne , , r , ~
Late For The Sky
Asylum 7E -1017
Many rock musicians are
reverting to the pre-Beatles practice
of playing 10 unrelated songs,
putting them together on a slab of
vinyl and calling the end result an
album. Jackson Browne, however,
is an artist in addition to being a
musician, and his albums have
themes which relate to the music.

Late For The Sky, his latest
effort, is perhaps tpe clearest
proof of Browne's creative talent.
The album cover (often an
afterthought of the artist or a task
that is delegated to someone else),
magnifies the significance of the
work. I will not describe it except
to say that Rene Magritte might
be a bit confused at some of the
places his paintings end up.
The music is outstanding,
featuring great lyrics and an
exciting variety of melodies. The
album begins with the title song, a
complex ballad, that requires a
few listenings to understand, but
eventually makes a lot of sense.
It has an entertaining guitar
solo in the middle by David
Lindley. "Fountain of Sorrow"
follows in a similar vein with even
better lyrics. "Farther On" is
disappointing, but the final song
on the top side, "The Late Show"
is superb. While explaining the
entire album concept, the song
deals with typical facades that
people tend to engage in. Both the
chorus and lead vocal are
memorable.
The second side is even better.
"The Road and The Sky" is a
great boogie-type number along
the same lines as Browne's own
"Redneck Friend," while even the
most callous cynics will be moved
by Jackson's penetrating vocal on
"For a Dancer," a mournful song
about death and dying. Yet, the
last two songs are the best ones on
the album. "Walking Slow" is a
happy song, guaranteed to pick
you up, and it is followed by the
classic "Before the Deluge."
Reminiscent of "For
Everyman," "Deluge" is a song
about a revolution and the ideals
of the revolutionaries. The song
ends with the confusion of the
few survivors "... after the
deluge."
The album is brilliant, the
music is good, the vocals are
better and the lyrics are as good as
any I've ever heard. Jackson
Browne has a knack of writing
effective which his style
ably adapts into song. The album
is a masterpiece, and I suggest you
buy it before it is sold out.
