The Southern Ute
Performing Arts Group,
At-U-Mai, will appear on
campus today at 7 p.m. in the
Ballroom of the Women's
Clubhouse in the Old Union
Complex.
The play, written by the
group with help from tribal
members, is called Wai-Ku-Pani
or Two Ways. The play
dramatizes the loss and
regaining of spiritual power in
modern Indian life.
The scripts include
traditional beliefs and stories,
both serious and humorous.
