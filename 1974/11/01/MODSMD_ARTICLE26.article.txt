## Festival Offers Strange Films 
### George Powell 
"There will be fist fights in the
lobby after this one," said a
couple of ticket holders at the San
Francisco Film Festival after the
screening of France, Incorporated.
In the best tradition of film
festivals, it met with a mixed
hisses and boos
wrapped around a core of strong
applause, which in part prompted
the facetious fist fight remark.
However, the San Francisco
Film Festival has always had its
share of controversy and this year
no exception. Film
afficianados complained that the
opening night choice, The Odessa
File, was too pedestrian and
commercial for the sophisticated
festival audience.
At the same, time, The Second
Doming of Suzanne and Lancelot
of the Lake were decried for being
too pretentious, vague and boring
for even the most avid
cinemaphiles. Even so, this year's
festival was more successful
financially than the last, with
attendance figures up 25 percent
%id 15 of the 27 paid events a
sellout, according to figures
announced this week.
Steppenwolf, the film
adaptation of the famous Herman
Hesse novel was probably the
biggest hit, with an extra Saturday
jpidnight showing added due to
heavy ticket demand.
France, Incorporated, though,
is probably closer to the ideal
festival film, a strange, taxing
combination of sex, violence and
moralizing wrapped up in an
enigmatic, world-turned-upside
aown plot that is either
meaningful, stupid or both
depending upon the viewers
beliefs about drugs, Vietnam,
communism or pornography.
The film also marks the debut
of director Alain Corneau, which
fives the critics nothing for
comparison. In fact, there is no
real easy place to grasp this
arresting and disturbing movie.
The plot ostensibly deals with
the hard drug trade, and how it
grew to be controlled by strange
Emotionless beings from the
United States, and then how hard
drugs were regulated by the state
to control its citizens' lives.
American culture and values
are seen as worthless and alien
that they correspond to
ipmething from another galaxy.
Megal drugs in private hands
might be better than legalize drugs
in the hands of the state,

according to the film, but any pat
answers are avoided or
obfuscated.
The violence, however, is
unmuddled and extremely
gratuitous, with the most
disgusting wrist-slashing scene this
side of The Devil in Miss Jones.
There's lots of naked women and
some rather casual fellatio, which
adds to the emotionless way the
movie looks at people and their
relationships. Through the control
of drugs, director Corneau seems
to be saying, people are made into
automatons. Illicit drugs,
however, add a certain verve or
thrill to life, making each day
more exciting and liveable.
With these explanations being
offered in the way of a flash back
from the year 2222 by one of the
old-time private dealers who has
been kept alive just as a curiosity,
the whole movie becomes
curiouser and curiouser.
It's a tribute to the director's
vision that he managed to
maintain this Alice In Wonderland
atmosphere without resorting to
out-of-the-ordinary props or
locales. On the other hand,
Corneau's fascination/revulsion
with violence cheapens and
confuses the tone of his movie,
since its use does much to shock
and little to enlighten.
Is violence a natural result of,
prelude to or part and parcel of
the drug scene? And does sex
need violence to bring the thrill

back? France, Incorporated hints
around at all these things in an
irritating, hit and miss manner.
Nothing has been said either
about the strange character of the
independent drug dealer, who
survives to 2222. His story is justs
convoluted and confusing, but

that's what makes a festival film.
Keep 'em just confused enough
to be entertained, and entertained
enough to be confused. In that
respect, France Incorporated
succeeds. However, don't look
for soon at your neighborhood
theater.
