# Drama Department Kicks Off Season With 'Chalk'
## 
### 
The Stanford Drama
Department's first production of
the year opens its two week run in
the Little Theater at 8 p.m. on
Tuesday.
The Caucasian Chalk Circle,
Bertolt Brecht's drama of
revolutionary justice, is the first
offering of the department.

The play is directed by Chris
Hampton, who directed the
department's production of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead last season.
As in most of Brecht's theatre
pieces, the plot of Chalk Circle is
simple and episodic. A storyteller
narrates the tale of Grusha
Vashnadze, a kitchen maid who
rescues an abandoned baby. The
governor's wife had left the child
behind in her panic-stricken flight
from the troops who had deposed
her husband.
Later the lad is taken from
Grusha, after she has fed,
sheltered and protected him
through great hardship and peril.
The wife of the governor, whose
political allies have come back to
power, reclaims her son.
In the meantime we have been
introduced to Asdak, a lecherous
eccentric. Through a series of
bizarre circumstances occasioned
by the war, he has become judge.
It is he who sits in judgment over
the case of the two mothers and
who presides over the play's
climactic trial scene.
Hampton sees the play as
Brecht's answer in dramatic

parable to the old revolutionary
question: "Who shall possess a
child or a land or a society
those who hold it by ancient law,
or those who would put it to
creative uses?" Brecht's answer,
according to Hampton, confounds
both capitalist and Marxist alike.
What man needs is not systems of
justice, but impulsive, creative
"humanness."
"We prefer clowns to systems,"
says Hampton.
Cathy Owens plays the role of
Grusha, Andy Mendelson plays
the role of Storyteller, David
Miller plays Azdak and Dan
Birnbaum plays Grusha's
sweetheart, Simon.
Sets and costumes have been
designed to capture the
spontaneity of improvisation
which a vagabond troupe might
employ in dramatizing a simple
tale.
Designer Lesley Skannal's
costumes combine the theatrically
ragged clothes of the lower classes
with "poor man's brocade," the
vagabond players' patchwork
rendition of what the well-dressed
noble might wear.

power, reclaims her son.
In the meantime we have been
introduced to Asdak, a lecherous
eccentric. Through a series of
bizarre circumstances occasioned
by the war, he has become judge.
It is he who sits in judgment over
the case of the two mothers and
who presides over the play's
climactic trial scene.
Hampton sees the play as
Brecht's answer in dramatic

parable to the old revolutionary
question: "Who shall possess a
child or a land or a society
those who hold it by ancient law,
or those who would put it to
creative uses?" Brecht's answer,
according to Hampton, confounds
both capitalist and Marxist alike.
What man needs is not systems of
justice, but impulsive, creative
"humanness."
"We prefer clowns to systems,"
says Hampton.
Cathy Owens plays the role of
Grusha, Andy Mendelson plays
the role of Storyteller, David
Miller plays Azdak and Dan
Birnbaum plays Grusha's
sweetheart, Simon.
Sets and costumes have been
designed to capture the
spontaneity of improvisation
which a vagabond troupe might
employ in dramatizing a simple
tale.
Designer Lesley Skannal's
costumes combine the theatrically
ragged clothes of the lower classes
with "poor man's brocade," the
vagabond players' patchwork
rendition of what the well-dressed
noble might wear.
The Stanford Drama
Department's first production of
the year opens its two week run in
the Little Theater at 8 p.m. on
Tuesday.
The Caucasian Chalk Circle,
Bertolt Brecht's drama of
revolutionary justice, is the first
offering of the department.

The play is directed by Chris
Hampton, who directed the
department's production of
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead last season.
As in most of Brecht's theatre
pieces, the plot of Chalk Circle is
simple and episodic. A storyteller
narrates the tale of Grusha
Vashnadze, a kitchen maid who
rescues an abandoned baby. The
governor's wife had left the child
behind in her panic-stricken flight
from the troops who had deposed
her husband.
Later the lad is taken from
Grusha, after she has fed,
sheltered and protected him
through great hardship and peril.
The wife of the governor, whose
political allies have come back to
power, reclaims her son.
