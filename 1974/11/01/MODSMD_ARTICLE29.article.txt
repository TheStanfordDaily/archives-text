## Card Poloists Need Two Weekend Wins 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The Stanford water polo team,
esperately needing a pair of wins
< rer tough opponents this
t visits the University
of Pacific today at 3:30 p.m.
On Saturday morning,
perennially rugged San Jose State
invades Stanford seeking revenge
for a 5-3 loss at the hands of the
Cardinals earlier in the season.
Stanford still has a slim chance
of being selected for the NCAA
Championships, but anything less
than two victories will most
certainly snuff out any chance of
a berth at all.
The formidable Spartans
should prove to be especially
stubborn, for they, too, are in
need of a victory to insure their
invitation to the NCAA
tournament scheduled for the end
of November.

A Look Ahead
Although the Card's immediate
prospects for an NCAA slot are
dim indeed, one can see nothing
but improvement next year. First
of all, only seniors Dean Anderson
and Stan Johnson will be lost due
to graduation.
Secondly, the Cards can look
forward to the return of redshirt
Risk- a vital cog in the
Stanford attack last year, being
named to the All-American squad
as a junior.
And finally, a bumper crop of
freshmen all but guarantees a
strong water polo program at
Stanford for years to come.
Johannsen Stars
One of those freshmen is
talented Rick Johannsen, a starter

who has already contributed a
great deal to the Card cause. "He's
played real well," says coach Art
Lambert, "and has a great future
ahead of him."
Despite the misfortune of
playing in relative obscurity for a
mediocre San Marcos (Calif.) high
school team, Johannsen was
recruited by several out-of-state
schools, as well as powerhouse
UC - Irvine. He chose Stanford,
however, primarily "because of its
academic reputation and
challenge." He also feels that "the
students here are more
serious-minded and goal-oriented
than at a place like USC."
Johannsen, who scored once in
the UCLA loss and tallied three
first-half goals against Cal-Poly
Pomona last weekend, is also a
top sprinter during the swim
season, and believes that his speed
was a primary factor in his making
the starting water polo team.
Rick also feels that his arrival
at Stanford was timed just right.
"I got here just as a whole new
program was beginning, and with
four years to play, I know I'll be
able to get in on the whole thing."
He notes that the addition of the
respected Lambert as coach
"should attract a lot of good
players," thereby making the
program even stronger.
An NCAA Championship at
Stanford this year? With two wins
this weekend, and a few more
down the stretch, it's possible. An
NCAA Championship within the
near future? Don't bet against it,
at least as long as talented
freshmen like Rick Johannsen
continue to flock to The Farm.

Johannsen, a freshman, is one prime reason why the water polo team
is expected to be tough for years to come.
