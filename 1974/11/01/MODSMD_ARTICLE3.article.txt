# Ford Campaigns For Richardson
## Cranston Favored To Hold Seat 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Campaigning in Southern California
on behalf of Republican candidates,
President Gerald Ford yesterday asked
state voters to "send a leader to the
U.S. Senate by electing Bill
Richardson," a GOP state senator.
But it's unlikely that the
presidential endorsement will slow the
momentum of a probable landslide
victory for Democratic, incumbent
Alan Cranston on Nov. 5.
Polls predict Cranston will retain
his seat with a 2-1 margin, and some
observers speculate the lopsided result
will mark 60-year-old Cranston as
presidential nomination material.
While campaigning against Earl
Brian for the Republican nomination
last spring, Richardson said "if the
election were held right now, I'd bet
on Cranston, but by the time the
election rolls around it'll be a whole
different story."
Same Old Story
Now, less than four days before the
election, Richardson's campaign
workers concede that he has less than
one chance in 10 of beating Cranston.
Although virtually assured of

defeat, Richardson feels his campaign
has at least made voters more aware of
"the conservative Republican point of
view on the problems of the
economy."
A leading member of the John
Birch Society until 1965 and a state
senator since 1966, Richardson has
advanced a 10-point plan for curing
the nation's economic ills. It includes
offshore oil drilling to achieve energy
independence, a moratorium on new
government social programs, limits on
government taxing power and a ban
on wage and price controls.
Like. Republican hopefuls across
the country, Richardson has labelled
his opponent as a proponent of
extravagant inflationary government
spending.
Trimming
Cranston denies that charge with a
claim that his votes against military aid
to dictators and against other
expenditures are part of a fight that
could trim over $lOO biliion from the
federal budget.
Cranston was a leader in pushing a
campaign reform bill which limits
campaign contributions by individuals,
but he is no tightwad when it comes to
his own campaign.
Listed by Commbn Cause as the
biggest collector of campaign funds of
any candidate for re-election to a
federal office this year, Cranston has
said he'll "spend almost all of it on
this campaign, on staff, travel and
media."
Despite his massive lead in the
polls, Cranston said during a television
debate last week that massive
campaign spending is necessary
"because I always run scared."
Running
Cranston hasn't given up running
since his days on the Stanford track
team while he was a student here. But
Richardson claims his opponent also
has been running from confrontations
on campaign issues in face-to face
debate.
Richardson's campaign manager
said the Republican accepted offers of
free debate time from 28 television
and radio stations, while Cranston
accepted none. The candidates
discussed the issues face-to face for the
first time last week in a televised
debate.
Cranston, a native of Palo Alto, has
made frequent local campaign
appearances. Richardson has not
compaigned heavily here. His
campaign manager called Richardson's


H. L. Richardson
marijuana laws, and said that he shall
continue to oppose decriminalization
until it is "maintained that it isn't
detrimental to health."
Legal Marijuana
Norris supports repeal of present
laws banning possession of marijuana.
He pointed out that "25 percent of all
adult felonies are involved with
marijuana."
"Elimination of these present laws
would save the state approximately
$75 million every year," Norris
explained.
Norris has also stated that he would

free from "trivial activities" by
decriminalizing victimless crimes, like
non-commercial sex between
consenting adults and non-commercial
gambling between friends.
Younger supports these laws in
their present form.
Norris favors treatingdrunkenness
through detoxification programs
rather than as a criminal matter, and
removing all but serious traffic
violations from the criminal courts.
Younger, a staunch defender of the
status quo, continues to support
criminal punishment for these crimes.

Campaigning in Southern California
on behalf of Republican candidates,
President Gerald Ford yesterday asked
state voters to "send a leader to the
U.S. Senate by electing Bill
Richardson," a GOP state senator.
But it's unlikely that the
presidential endorsement will slow the
momentum of a probable landslide
victory for Democratic, incumbent
Alan Cranston on Nov. 5.
Polls predict Cranston will retain
his seat with a 2-1 margin, and some
observers speculate the lopsided result
will mark 60-year-old Cranston as
presidential nomination material.
While campaigning against Earl
Brian for the Republican nomination
last spring, Richardson said "if the
election were held right now, I'd bet
on Cranston, but by the time the
election rolls around it'll be a whole
different story."
Same Old Story
Now, less than four days before the
election, Richardson's campaign
workers concede that he has less than
one chance in 10 of beating Cranston.
Although virtually assured of

defeat, Richardson feels his campaign
has at least made voters more aware of
"the conservative Republican point of
view on the problems of the
economy."
A leading member of the John
Birch Society until 1965 and a state
senator since 1966, Richardson has
advanced a 10-point plan for curing
the nation's economic ills. It includes
offshore oil drilling to achieve energy
independence, a moratorium on new
government social programs, limits on
government taxing power and a ban
on wage and price controls.
Like. Republican hopefuls across
the country, Richardson has labelled
his opponent as a proponent of
extravagant inflationary government
spending.
Trimming
Cranston denies that charge with a
claim that his votes against military aid
to dictators and against other
expenditures are part of a fight that
could trim over $lOO biliion from the
federal budget.
Cranston was a leader in pushing a
campaign reform bill which limits
campaign contributions by individuals,
but he is no tightwad when it comes to
his own campaign.
Listed by Commbn Cause as the
biggest collector of campaign funds of
any candidate for re-election to a
federal office this year, Cranston has
said he'll "spend almost all of it on
this campaign, on staff, travel and
media."
Despite his massive lead in the
polls, Cranston said during a television
debate last week that massive
campaign spending is necessary
"because I always run scared."
Running
Cranston hasn't given up running
since his days on the Stanford track
team while he was a student here. But
Richardson claims his opponent also
has been running from confrontations
on campaign issues in face-to face
debate.
Richardson's campaign manager
said the Republican accepted offers of
free debate time from 28 television
and radio stations, while Cranston
accepted none. The candidates
discussed the issues face-to face for the
first time last week in a televised
debate.
Cranston, a native of Palo Alto, has
made frequent local campaign
appearances. Richardson has not
compaigned heavily here. His
campaign manager called Richardson's


H. L. Richardson
marijuana laws, and said that he shall
continue to oppose decriminalization
until it is "maintained that it isn't
detrimental to health."
Legal Marijuana
Norris supports repeal of present
laws banning possession of marijuana.
He pointed out that "25 percent of all
adult felonies are involved with
marijuana."
"Elimination of these present laws
would save the state approximately
$75 million every year," Norris
explained.
Norris has also stated that he would

free from "trivial activities" by
decriminalizing victimless crimes, like
non-commercial sex between
consenting adults and non-commercial
gambling between friends.
Younger supports these laws in
their present form.
Norris favors treatingdrunkenness
through detoxification programs
rather than as a criminal matter, and
removing all but serious traffic
violations from the criminal courts.
Younger, a staunch defender of the
status quo, continues to support
criminal punishment for these crimes.
