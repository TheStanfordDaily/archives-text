# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Our fearful forecaster fears
for his job unless things get
better this weekend. After all,
he was an awful 2-2 last week,
True, his season mark stands at
an admirable 21-4-2, but like
football coaches, predictors
face firing after every loss.
OK. The Oregon State
Pumpkins, who've been
squashed six of seven times,
invade Stanford Stadium
tomorrow. OSU is actually a
much better team than its
record indicates, and we
wouldn't be surprised if it won
the rest of its games.
Stanford needs its best game
of â–  the year to win against a
deceptive foe. We think they'll
get it.
The other interesting battle
this week is UCLA versus
Washington. This is the

Associated Press' "upset
special" game, it's not ours,
The Huskies may have
trampled Oregon 66-0 last
week, but don't usually win
close games,
USC-California looks less
interesting, now that Cat has
been creamed by UCLA. The
Bears should get an early lead,
but are too banged up to
survive an entire game with the
Trojans.
Up north, Oregon and
Washington State play for the
cellar. Jim Sweeney's boys may
not be too good, but they're
tough and proud enough to
stay out of last place,
Predictions
Stanford 17, Oregon St. 10
USC 38, California 14
UCLA 27, Washington 20
Washington St. 16, Oregon 7
