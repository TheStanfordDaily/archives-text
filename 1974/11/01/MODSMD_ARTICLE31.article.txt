# Stanford Can't Sleep Through OSU Game
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
It's been a dull week on
campus.
Students have been caught
between the three depressants of
midterms, early sunsets and the
start of the rainy season.
And tomorrow's football game,
that between Stanford and
Oregon State, hasn't excited
anyone to feverish forgetfulness
of the above trio of barbiturates.
After all, isn't everyone too
busy planning for that post-USC
game party?
So everyone is forgetting OSU.
Fewer than 40,000 people are
expected to be at Stanford
Stadium at 1:30 tomorrow, even
with good weather. With bad
weather, the cavern will echo with
emptiness.
But our football team can't
forget. If it does, the USC game
will mean nothing but pride.
OSU Tough
And Oregon State is not the
kind of team that can be
forgotten. True, the Beavers'
record is a meager 1-6, but the
team came within three yards of
beating Cal, and even held mighty
USC for a half, before losing
31-10.
"Oregon State is a lot like
ourselves," coach Jack
Christiansen says. The Beavers
play a similar defense and run
many of the same offensive plays
as the Cards.
The difference with OSU's
offense is that coach Dee Andros
has put in multiple offensive sets
(over 20 thus far this year)
designed to confuse the defense.
Twice last Saturday OSU
completely confused USC's
defensive backs. Once, a 43-yard
touchdown bomb from Alvin
White to Lee Overton left USC's
coaches screaming. Another time,
a touchdown pass was all but
complete when SC defensive back
Marvin Cobb, badly beaten on the
play, streaked over and just batted
it away.
Strange Plays
OSU has also had success with
an assortment of reverses and
flea-flicker plays, though cynics
think the reason coach Dee
Andros abandoned his old
straight-ahead running attack in
1973 was to bring more fans to
the game and save his job.
Offensively, the Beavers have
two super players. Center Greg
Krpalek (Cur PAH-lik) is a big
(6-5, 250), tough blocker who has
shrugged off injuries this season.
The battle between Krpalek and
Card nose guard Drew Palin
should be a fierce one.
The other star is tight end Dave
Brown, a junior college transfer

who can both block and catch
passes (he's the league's sixth
leading receiver.) OSU publicity
man Dave Otto calls Brown
"probably the best athlete on our
team."
But mostly, the offense is built
around quarterback White. When
Andros switched to a passing
attack, he picked the 220-pound
White, who runs well, to lead it.
White's problem is accuracy.
His percentage is 0n1y.430-second
worst among the Pac-B's starters.
White is also tied for the "lead" in
interceptions, having thrown 10.
Last year, 23 of his passes were
picked off.
Defensive Woes
Defensively, OSU plays a lot
like Stanford, but not quite as
well, allowing 377.1 yards per
game to the Cards' 349.6 average.
OSU has the league's worst
rushing defense, but is second in
pass defense, so the Stanford
Cards may have to use more

running plays than usual
tomorrow.
The Beavers, who have drawn
only anemie crowds averaging
25,000 so far this year, need some
wins to save their Great
Pumpkin's job. Andros is on the
line, working only on a one-year
"extension" of his contract.
Andros's task is complicated
by the fact that the Beavers' top
two running backs, Elvin Momon
and Charlie Smith, won't plky.
Punter Bob McKenzie is also out,
and White, who averages only 35
yards, will have to kick. 11
Everyone would like to see
Andros, a great guy, win a few
games and save his job. You won't
see Jack Christiansen running up
the score tomorrow if he gets a
big lead.
Don't feel too sorry for the
Pumpkin, however. He'll have
some weird things planned for
Halloween weekend and might
just bewilder Stanford out of the
Rose Bowl race.
