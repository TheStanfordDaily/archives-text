It took the Stanford soccer
team half a season to get back en
forme, but it did exactly that
Wednesday afternoon in the cold
and the dark, edging
regionally ranked Santa Clara, 2-1.
The Cards lost to Santa Clara
in the Menlo Invitational
Tournament earlier this year, 3-0,
but dominated, play in the
rematch. Stanford played 90
minutes of rough, aggressive
soccer and looked a lot like the
same team that tied USF and beat
Westmont at the beginning of the
season.
Head coach Fred Priddle
indicated that he was relieved to
be back on the winning track
again.
For a couple of minutes at the

beginning of the game it looked as
though Santa Clara was going to
take control of the game, but the
momentum shifted suddenly to
the Cardinals and they did not
lose it.
The action see-sawed for 44
minutes of the first period, then
Stanford's Mike Kellogg took the
ball down the right side of the
field and crossed it.
Although the pass was
deflected by a Santa Clara
fullback, it was deflected right to
the feet of Robby Robb, who
shot from the right side of the
penalty area into the opposite
corner of the goal.
Santa Clara, 10th ranked in the
West, scored early in the second
period on a head-in off of a corner
kick. The ball passed untouched
across the front of the Stanford
goal, and was punched into the
left side of the net.
Spectators remembered a
couple of bad endings from earlier
in the season, but the Card
booters did not appear too shaken
by the score.
With 11 minutes remaining in
the game, the darkness becoming
increasingly apparent and the
temperature gradually falling,
Stanford's Phil Wright boomed in
a free kick from outside the left
corner of the Santa Clara penalty
area.
Santa Clara tried desperately to
put the ball into the net, and,
thwarted by the Cardinal defense,
tried momentarily to put Marty
Glickfeld into the net. (For the
latter, a Santa Clara player was
ejected.) They were successful at
neither.
Stanford took 20 shots on
goal, Santa Clara took 12. Bruce
Mosbacher had nine saves and
only one heart palpitation.
Stanford plays Stanislaus State
at Turlock tomorrow. Their next
home appearance will be in the
Pac-8 Tournament (Stanford
Invitational) Nov. 15 16.

home appearance will be in the
Pac-8 Tournament (Stanford
Invitational) Nov. 15 16.
It took the Stanford soccer
team half a season to get back en
forme, but it did exactly that
Wednesday afternoon in the cold
and the dark, edging
regionally ranked Santa Clara, 2-1.
The Cards lost to Santa Clara
in the Menlo Invitational
Tournament earlier this year, 3-0,
but dominated, play in the
rematch. Stanford played 90
minutes of rough, aggressive
soccer and looked a lot like the
same team that tied USF and beat
Westmont at the beginning of the
season.
Head coach Fred Priddle
indicated that he was relieved to
be back on the winning track
again.
For a couple of minutes at the

beginning of the game it looked as
though Santa Clara was going to
take control of the game, but the
momentum shifted suddenly to
the Cardinals and they did not
lose it.
The action see-sawed for 44
minutes of the first period, then
Stanford's Mike Kellogg took the
ball down the right side of the
field and crossed it.
Although the pass was
deflected by a Santa Clara
fullback, it was deflected right to
the feet of Robby Robb, who
shot from the right side of the
penalty area into the opposite
corner of the goal.
Santa Clara, 10th ranked in the
West, scored early in the second
period on a head-in off of a corner
kick. The ball passed untouched
across the front of the Stanford
goal, and was punched into the
left side of the net.
Spectators remembered a
couple of bad endings from earlier
in the season, but the Card
booters did not appear too shaken
by the score.
With 11 minutes remaining in
the game, the darkness becoming
increasingly apparent and the
temperature gradually falling,
Stanford's Phil Wright boomed in
a free kick from outside the left
corner of the Santa Clara penalty
area.
Santa Clara tried desperately to
put the ball into the net, and,
thwarted by the Cardinal defense,
tried momentarily to put Marty
Glickfeld into the net. (For the
latter, a Santa Clara player was
ejected.) They were successful at
neither.
Stanford took 20 shots on
goal, Santa Clara took 12. Bruce
Mosbacher had nine saves and
only one heart palpitation.
Stanford plays Stanislaus State
at Turlock tomorrow. Their next
home appearance will be in the
Pac-8 Tournament (Stanford
Invitational) Nov. 15 16.
