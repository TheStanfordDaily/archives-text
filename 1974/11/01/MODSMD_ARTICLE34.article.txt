# Women's Scholarships: Arduous Road Ahead
##

Second of Two Parts
Everybody but the most traditional old
fogey advocates equal status for women as
called for by Title IX. But just how to
accomplish equality in athletic scholarships
and funding of new sports programs remains a
baffling chicken-and-egg controversy.
Most Athletic Department fund-raisers and
Buck Club contributors say they'd like to see
some evidence of talent before they commit
money to the women's cause, especially
because that money may come out of the
men's budget. Talent must come before
money, they say.
But women activists claim you can't make
talent without good programs on the higb
school and university levels. Money must
precede talent, they argue.
As both factions await the rapidly
approaching date in December when President
Ford is expected to sign the final Title IX
regulations into law, the debate has
intensified.
Financial Aid
The University this year awarded full or
some financial aid to 124 athletes, drawing
the support money from $530,000 raised
from 4782 alumni donors in the Buck Club.
To prohibit sex discrimination under the
rules of Title IX, some of that aid will have to

be channeled to women, though no one
knows how much or by when the aid must be
appropriated.
HEW attorney Gwen Gregory, who
traveled around the country answering
questions about Title IX, suggests that the
number of scholarships be "proportionately
comparable" to the number given the larger
male group, with relative needs and interest
considered in the allocation.
But Alumni Relations Director Jack Laird
says it's not that easy. With money so tight,
"we had to scratch and claw to raise the half
million we did," he says.
Because of rampant inflation, it costs more
each year to give the same number of
scholarships. Next year, the Buck Club hopes
to raise $579,000.
Damage To Men?
A major concern in the Athletic
Department, then, is whether enough money
can be raised to support women's scholarship
aid without damaging the men's program,
where football and basketball bring in most of
the department's income.
"We'll just have to find new money," Laird
says. But he adds that many Buck Club
members may not be so receptive to
contributing extra money for aid to women,
or even to allowing the money they've already
promised to go to women.

"You've got to think there aren't too many
who would suddenly switch to women," he
notes, though he hopes that alumni, who run
the gamut from "male chauvinist pig to
women's libber," will agree to help the
women.
John Arrillaga, a Buck Club member, says
he "wouldn't give one penny to the women
I'd quit giving completely."
Most Would Cooperate
But most Buck Club members contacted
say they would likely cooperate if the men's
program were not harmed, and if they knew
that talented women would be recipients. "I'd
like to see what the women propose to do,
what their program is like," says San
Francisco banker Scott Lawson.
Lawson adds that fund-raisers might
suggest that female athletic contributors
specify that their donations go to women.
And Buck Club Chairman Edwin Tanner of
Atherton says he thinks "there are gals yho
can give who have not. Women generally, not
only alumni."
Vicki Hays, member of the Organization of
Stanford Women Athletes (OSWA), agrees.
"With an increased interest on campus, I think
you'll find an increased interest among
alumni, especially if the [women's program]
is presented in a very positive fashion."
However, Hays says she doubts sufficient
money can be raised through the Buck Club.
She says the OSWA has been working on a
proposal which, if approved by the Provost's
office, would allow University fund-raisers to
give high priority to soliciting financial
support for women athletes.
'Doe Club'
Alumni Director Laird suggests a "Doe
Club" a women's auxiliary of the Buck
Club which would work with or out of Laird's
office as another alternative.
One of its primary goals would be to secure
endowed scholarships, where the interest
earned on a large sum of money in a bank will
support a scholarship each year. Some 23
endowed scholarships presently exist for men.
Another way to help fund women's
scholarships without harming the men's
program may entail changing the criterion for
offering financial aid.
Many athletes are presently offered full
tuition no matter how little they need it;
otherwise they would likely choose a less
expensive state school over Stanford.
But eliminating grants for room and board
fees which are essentially the same at all
schools to those who don't need them
might save money. However, Athletic Director
Joe Ruetz notes that unless all schools woqld
agree to eliminate unnecessary room and
board grants, Stanford would seem less
appealing than those schools which continued
to offer them.
OSWA member Hays says she hopes to
secure money for 12 women's scholarships by

next fall. Women's Physical Education
Chairwoman Pamela Strathairn is not so
optimistic. "It takes time to get a scholarship
base for women. I hope it will be next year
that they'll start givingthem, but I see the real
possibility as two years hence."
Buck Club Chairman Tannef says his goal is
to underwrite one woman athlete next fall as
a positive step, and adds he will try to begin
discussion of the idea at the Buck Club
meeting next weekend.
Just what kind of woman athlete will get
scholarship aid is another problem. Ruetz says
that "if there's no talent, why give a
scholarship?"
Noting the University's obligation to look
for talented female athletes, Ruetz says he
still can't see "that we have to give
scholarships to women if there are talented
men but not talented women."
OSWA member Margie Shuer vehemently
disagrees. "They want to see talent first, and
then they'll go ahead [and giveischolarships].
But women have never been trained in high
school" the way men have, so how could they
demonstrate exceptional talent?
Take Less Talented
Educational consultant Dr. Rodger Rickard
adds, "If Stanford can't get the most talented
[women] athletes for scholarships, they'll
have to take the less talented. After all,
Stanford didn't build up a football
powerhouse overnight."
Shuer contends that the same argument
applies to the initiation of new women's
sports here on the intercollegiate level.
But Laird notes that most contributors to
the University "want their mpney to go to
quality [talent], not just to a competitor. It's
not a question of 'here's the money who
wants to go out for a sport?' "
In order to comply with Title IX, the

University will also have to iron out the
discrepancy in the different methods in which
it recruits men and women athletes, Strathairn
says.
Present AIAW (women's conference
comparable to the NCAA) rules prohibit any
school from actively recruiting a female
athlete. The student, not the school, must
initiate the process.
Choice Needed
The NCAA allows active recruitment.
Strathairn says she thinks the University will
have to choose whether to adopt the NCAA or
AIAW rules in order to make its policy
consistent.
If the University chooses to allow active
recruitment of women, it will violate present
AIAW rules. If it decides to prohibit any
recruitment, an unlikely option, the quality of
its athletic teams will suffer unless all other
colleges agree to that policy.
Truly, Joe Ruetz and Pam Strathairn are
on the hot seat. Both hope the final Title IX
regulations don't put the University in an
inescapable bind.
Anyway, says Strathairn, "if one can make
changes without using the stick of federal law,
but rather by persuasion of the rational
person," then their efforts will attain more
feasible results of more lasting value.

currently offered athletic scholarships, as opposed to 132 men.


FROM BOTH SIDES-Vicki Hays, star of this
year's women's swim team, would certainly
receive an athletic scholarship if such grants
were offered to women. Hays is a leading
advocate of increased funding for women's
athletics.
