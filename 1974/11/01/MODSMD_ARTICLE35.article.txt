## Run Results 
### PETE BHATIA 
The Stanford Running Club and Theta
Delta Chi won top honors in the IM Cross
Country meet last Friday at the Stanford Golf
Course.
Ray White, Bruce Rubin and John
Ferguson finished three, four, five in the grad
division for the running club with times of
10:25, 10:27 and 10:42 respectively over the
two-mile course.
In the undergrad division, the Theta Delts
used the even pace of Jay Souder, Terry "The
Cheese" Alkana and Paul Nancarrow to gain
the victory. The three finished ninth, 10th
and 13th respectively in the undergrad field.

In IM football, the Zetes continued their
undefeated ways with a relatively easy 32-7
romp over the previously unbeaten Melatrons.
The game was considerably closer than the
score, however, in a game that waif to say the
least, spirited.
In other football games this week, Sigma
Chi edged Burbank 20-19, the Phi Delts beat
Burbank '74, 34-7, SAE bombed Branner
58-0, Kappa Sig eased by Biz II B 19-0, Biz II
remained undefeated with a 49-12 romp over
the Wildmen and, in a battle of the inane
names, Munchem Crunchem chewed Milos
Mashers 18-12.
