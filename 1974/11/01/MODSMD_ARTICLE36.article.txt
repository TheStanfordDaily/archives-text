Doctors: Nixon Remains In Danger
LONG BEACH, Calif. Former President Richard M.
Nixon's internal bleeding apparently has stopped but "there
are dangers lurking in the background" and more bipod
transfusions have started, Nixon's team of doctors said
yesterday.
The doctor's did not name the dangers.
Nixon probably will remain on the critical list for 24 to
72 more hours, the doctors added.
They said that they are still working to replace the blood
Nixon lost in internal hemorrhaging that followed his
phlebitis surgery.
Nixon could have died from the bleeding that sent him
into shock for three hours Tuesday "if proper measures had
not been taken," said Dr. John C. Lungren,'echoing a
statement made Wednesday by Nixon's former press
secretary, Ron Ziegler.
Lungren, Nixon's longtime doctor, and two surgeons
who operated on Nixon, did not specify when Nixon
apparently stopped bleeding.
Hearsts Withdraw Reward Offer
SAN FRANCISCO The parents of fugitive newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst said yesterday they have withdrawn
their offer of a $50,000 reward for her return out of fear it
might endanger her safety.
"We love Patricia and have complete faith in her," said a
statement issued by San Francisco Examiner Editor
Randolph A. Hearst and his wife Catherine. "We want more
than anything else for her to return to our home or to any
kind of life-style of her own choosing."
The Hearsts posted the $50,000 reward on May 8 for
their 20-year-old daughter, who was abducted Feb. 4 by the
terrorist Symbionese Liberation Army.
She subsequently announced she had joined her captors ■
and now is sought by authorities on charges including
kidnaping and armed robbery.
"We are prepared to do all in our power to help her,
protect her and defend her," the Hearsts said in the
statement printed on the front page of the Examiner. The
statement said, "We have reached the conclusion, however,,
that the reward offer may be misinterpreted by her and
may, therefore, be a deterrent to her voluntary return."
Magruder: Mitchell Okayed Break-In
WASHINGTON Jeb Stuart Magruder testified
yesterday that John N. Mitchell gave his unenthusiastic
approval for the Watergate burglary, but asked a week later
why so much money was required by the man who was
planning it. /
Testifying at the Watergate cover-up trial for the third
day, Magruder said he got a telephone call from the former
attorney general in the first week of April 1972 asking why
G. Gordon Liddy needed "this much money."
Magruder said that he went to Mitchell's office and
reviewed for him the $250,000 proposal that he said

Mitchell approved on March 30. Magruder explained that
what Liddy was asking "was in effect front money" to
purchase equipment and hire men.
"Mr. Mitchell understood," Magruder said, and later
authorized Hugh Sloan, the treasurer of Richard M. Nixon's
re-election committee, to give Liddy what he asked.
Magruder had testified earlier that the approval for the
Liddy plan was given at a meeting in Key Biscayne, Fla., on
March 30.
There has been previous testimony in other forums that
Liddy originally asked for $82,000.
Mitchell is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice,
along with H.R. Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman, Robert C.
Mardian and Kenneth W. Parkinson.
Magruder is serving a 10-month to four-year prison
sentence on his plea of guilty to obstructing justice in the
case.
Protesters Hurt In Saigon Crackdown
SAIGON Scores of persons were, reported injured
yesterday in a strong show of force by police to halt a
two-month-old wave of antigovernment demonstrations.
Police moved shortly after midnight on rallying points
for various groups planning a massive march in downtown
Saigon. Clashes broke out as police arrested or sealed off
the demonstrators.
The clampdown marked an escalation in police tactics
against the growing opposition movement which began in
early September with charges of corruption aimed at the
government of President Nguyen Van Thieu. Previously
police had been relatively restrained.
Farm Product Prices Rise
WASHINGTON Prices of raw farm products jumped
four percent from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, more than offsetting
a decline one month earlier, the Agriculture Department
said yesterday.
The Crop Reporting Board said higher prices for wheat,
corn, hogs, soybeans and cotton were mostly responsible
for the increase.
Lower prices were reported for cattle, calves and
potatoes.
The four percent increase followed a two percent decline
from Aug. 15 to Sept. 15 which had been the first drop
since mid-June.
The mid-month index rose six percent in July and three
percent in August.
Over the past year the price index has fluctuated widely,
but as of Oct. 15 it averaged five-tenths of a percent above a
year earlier.

Magruder: Mitchell Okayed Break-In
WASHINGTON Jeb Stuart Magruder testified
yesterday that John N. Mitchell gave his unenthusiastic
approval for the Watergate burglary, but asked a week later
why so much money was required by the man who was
planning it. /
Testifying at the Watergate cover-up trial for the third
day, Magruder said he got a telephone call from the former
attorney general in the first week of April 1972 asking why
G. Gordon Liddy needed "this much money."
Magruder said that he went to Mitchell's office and
reviewed for him the $250,000 proposal that he said

Mitchell approved on March 30. Magruder explained that
what Liddy was asking "was in effect front money" to
purchase equipment and hire men.
"Mr. Mitchell understood," Magruder said, and later
authorized Hugh Sloan, the treasurer of Richard M. Nixon's
re-election committee, to give Liddy what he asked.
Magruder had testified earlier that the approval for the
Liddy plan was given at a meeting in Key Biscayne, Fla., on
March 30.
There has been previous testimony in other forums that
Liddy originally asked for $82,000.
Mitchell is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice,
along with H.R. Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman, Robert C.
Mardian and Kenneth W. Parkinson.
Magruder is serving a 10-month to four-year prison
sentence on his plea of guilty to obstructing justice in the
case.

from Aug. 15 to Sept. 15 which had been the first drop
since mid-June.
The mid-month index rose six percent in July and three
percent in August.
Over the past year the price index has fluctuated widely,
but as of Oct. 15 it averaged five-tenths of a percent above a
year earlier.

reviewed for him the $250,000 proposal that he said

Mitchell approved on March 30. Magruder explained that
what Liddy was asking "was in effect front money" to
purchase equipment and hire men.
"Mr. Mitchell understood," Magruder said, and later
authorized Hugh Sloan, the treasurer of Richard M. Nixon's
re-election committee, to give Liddy what he asked.
Magruder had testified earlier that the approval for the
Liddy plan was given at a meeting in Key Biscayne, Fla., on
March 30.
There has been previous testimony in other forums that
Liddy originally asked for $82,000.
Mitchell is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice,
along with H.R. Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman, Robert C.
Mardian and Kenneth W. Parkinson.
Magruder is serving a 10-month to four-year prison
sentence on his plea of guilty to obstructing justice in the
case.

four percent from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, more than offsetting

potatoes.

from Aug. 15 to Sept. 15 which had been the first drop
since mid-June.
The mid-month index rose six percent in July and three
percent in August.

year earlier.

Nixon's internal bleeding apparently has stopped but "there
are dangers lurking in the background" and more bipod
transfusions have started, Nixon's team of doctors said
yesterday.
The doctor's did not name the dangers.
Nixon probably will remain on the critical list for 24 to
72 more hours, the doctors added.

Nixon lost in internal hemorrhaging that followed his
phlebitis surgery.

into shock for three hours Tuesday "if proper measures had
not been taken," said Dr. John C. Lungren,'echoing a
statement made Wednesday by Nixon's former press
secretary, Ron Ziegler.
Lungren, Nixon's longtime doctor, and two surgeons
who operated on Nixon, did not specify when Nixon
apparently stopped bleeding.
Hearsts Withdraw Reward Offer
SAN FRANCISCO The parents of fugitive newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst said yesterday they have withdrawn
their offer of a $50,000 reward for her return out of fear it
might endanger her safety.
"We love Patricia and have complete faith in her," said a
statement issued by San Francisco Examiner Editor
Randolph A. Hearst and his wife Catherine. "We want more
than anything else for her to return to our home or to any
kind of life-style of her own choosing."
The Hearsts posted the $50,000 reward on May 8 for
their 20-year-old daughter, who was abducted Feb. 4 by the
terrorist Symbionese Liberation Army.
She subsequently announced she had joined her captors ■
and now is sought by authorities on charges including
kidnaping and armed robbery.
"We are prepared to do all in our power to help her,
protect her and defend her," the Hearsts said in the
statement printed on the front page of the Examiner. The
statement said, "We have reached the conclusion, however,,
that the reward offer may be misinterpreted by her and
may, therefore, be a deterrent to her voluntary return."
