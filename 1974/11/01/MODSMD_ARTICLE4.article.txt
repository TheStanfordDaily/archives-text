# New BSU Leaders Plan 'To Develop Aptitudes'

Mae Jemison, the new president of
the Black Students Union (BSU), said
at a press conference last night the
BSU is attempting "to create an
atmosphere conducive to black
students' interest... so that they can
develop all of their aptitudes."
The other new BSU officers are
Warner Session, vice president;
Orlando Mayes, financial manager;
Leon Orr, activities director; and
Derek Toliver, president in charge of
black media.
Jemison said all of the projects the
BSU is planning are equally important.
Some of the activities she outlined are:
—a Black Liberation Month in
February during which the BSU will
sponsor guest speakers and programs
with "cultural aspects designed to run
the gamut" of black activities;
—a proposed "Black Media" class
for spring quarter;
—a proposed study of the Athletic
Department's attitude toward black
athletes;
—a conference at Stanford with
black student unions from nearby

colleges to exchange ideas and
information;
—an attempt to secure input in the
admission process. Jemison said only
72 blacks were among the 1500
entering freshman "the largest
freshman class ever admitted to
Stanford . . . and the smallest
proportion of black students;"
—review of the black theme house
in Lagunita which Jemison said "isn't
what the black students asked for. It
doesn't provide the cultural aspects we
want... it's not responsive to black
students' needs."
Toliver, in his capacity as black
media coordinator, hopes to instigate
publication of a black periodical, and
publish a newsletter to solicit
occupational and financial help from
black alumni. Warner Session would be
the acting director of a proposed black
alumni association.
Financially, the BSU is operating
on a minimal budget, according to
activities director Orr. But he said the
BSU is planning fund-raising activities
in order to establish a larger base for
future activities.
