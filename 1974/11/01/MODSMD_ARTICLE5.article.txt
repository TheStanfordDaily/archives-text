# Two Schools Join Fight Against Physicist Union
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Two major universities have
submitted "friends of the court" briefs
to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) on behalf of Stanford's effort
to prevent the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists (SURP) fyom
gaining bargaining power for physics
research associates and teaching
assistants.
At Stanford's request, Cornell
University and MIT entered the briefs
at the NLRB's Washington
headquarters, where the SURP case is
now pending, according to James
Siena, legal counsel to President
Lyman.
"We thought that the same reasons
that concern us in this case should
concern them," Siena said. "Those
that chose to intervene on our behalf
obviously see the case in the same
terms as we do."
SURP Vice President Mike
O'Connor said the Cornell and MIT

briefs represented a major obstacle to
SURP's case.
"If the contentions of these
universities are upheld," he said, "it
would mean that the graduate students
at all private non-profit universities in
the nation would lose, for the
foreseeable future, the right to be
represented by a union on
employment-related matters."
Siena contended that "as we see it,
graduate students are not employees in
the sense that the law provides.
Putting them under the umbrella of
the NLRB, we think, would adversely
affect their status with the University
and ultimately the quality of the
education they are getting."
The NLRB has the authority to
recognize unions as legal bargaining
agents for groups of employees.
SURP's lawyer for the case, David
Salniker of San Francisco, has
requested that the NLRB not consider
the Cornell and MIT briefs because
they are "totally immaterial" to the
SURP case.
"None of the parties here
contended that all university
employers were the same and none of
the record pertains to research
associates at other universities,"
Salniker wrote in a letter to NLRB
Executive Secretary John Truesdale.
' 'Stanford physics research
assistants are performing the exact
type of work done by private and
government research institutions.
During the rest of their working
careers, the research assistants here
will perform exactly the same tasks
and functions that they are currently
undertaking," Salniker added.
He also charged that the University
until recently "classified, paid,
described and directed student

research assistants as 'employees,' "
not the case at the two other
universities. He advised that the NLRB
"ban further briefing on this matter."
Siena denied the research assistants
were classified as employees.
"To state that they have ever been
treated as employees is erroneous," he
replied. "Classification is a rather*
complicated procedure, but in all
important particulars the research
assistants have always been treated as
students. They have not had the same
rights, prerogatives and privileges as
regular employees."
The SURP case went to the NLRB's
national office in July after a
preliminary hearing in Palo Alto.
According to SURP spokesman
O'Connor, the hearing is to be decided
by the national office rather than the
regional unit "because of its
precedent-setting nature."

Siena contended that "as we see it,
graduate students are not employees in
the sense that the law provides.
Putting them under the umbrella of
the NLRB, we think, would adversely
affect their status with the University
and ultimately the quality of the
education they are getting."
The NLRB has the authority to
recognize unions as legal bargaining
agents for groups of employees.
SURP's lawyer for the case, David
Salniker of San Francisco, has
requested that the NLRB not consider
the Cornell and MIT briefs because
they are "totally immaterial" to the
SURP case.
"None of the parties here
contended that all university
employers were the same and none of
the record pertains to research
associates at other universities,"
Salniker wrote in a letter to NLRB
Executive Secretary John Truesdale.
' 'Stanford physics research
assistants are performing the exact
type of work done by private and
government research institutions.
During the rest of their working
careers, the research assistants here
will perform exactly the same tasks
and functions that they are currently
undertaking," Salniker added.
He also charged that the University
until recently "classified, paid,
described and directed student

research assistants as 'employees,' "
not the case at the two other
universities. He advised that the NLRB
"ban further briefing on this matter."
Siena denied the research assistants
were classified as employees.
"To state that they have ever been
treated as employees is erroneous," he
replied. "Classification is a rather*
complicated procedure, but in all
important particulars the research
assistants have always been treated as
students. They have not had the same
rights, prerogatives and privileges as
regular employees."
The SURP case went to the NLRB's
national office in July after a
preliminary hearing in Palo Alto.
According to SURP spokesman
O'Connor, the hearing is to be decided
by the national office rather than the
regional unit "because of its
precedent-setting nature."

Two major universities have
submitted "friends of the court" briefs
to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) on behalf of Stanford's effort
to prevent the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists (SURP) fyom
gaining bargaining power for physics
research associates and teaching
assistants.
At Stanford's request, Cornell
University and MIT entered the briefs
at the NLRB's Washington
headquarters, where the SURP case is
now pending, according to James
Siena, legal counsel to President
Lyman.
"We thought that the same reasons
that concern us in this case should
concern them," Siena said. "Those
that chose to intervene on our behalf
obviously see the case in the same
terms as we do."
SURP Vice President Mike
O'Connor said the Cornell and MIT

briefs represented a major obstacle to
SURP's case.
"If the contentions of these
universities are upheld," he said, "it
would mean that the graduate students
at all private non-profit universities in
the nation would lose, for the
foreseeable future, the right to be
represented by a union on
employment-related matters."
Siena contended that "as we see it,
graduate students are not employees in
the sense that the law provides.
Putting them under the umbrella of
the NLRB, we think, would adversely
affect their status with the University
and ultimately the quality of the
education they are getting."
