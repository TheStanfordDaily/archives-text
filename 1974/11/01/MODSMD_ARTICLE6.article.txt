# Scandal Rumors Mark Younger-Norris Race
## 
### THOMAS CREMA 
Despite recent information
concerning incumbent Republican
Evelle J. Younger's possible
involvement in a $3O million oil stock
scandal, Democratic contender William
Norris remains the underdog in the
race for state attorney general.
Younger, former Los Angeles
district attorney, made a statement two
years ago claiming that he had not
personally contacted more than two
men to suggest to them that they
invest in Geo-Tek Oil Enterprises,
whose promoter is presently on trial
for fraud.
The Sacramento Bee said yesterday
that four persons have contradicted his
claim. All four claim that Younger
contacted them personally in the
mid-1960s regarding their possible
investment in Geo-Tek.
Three of them are Los Angeles-area
attorneys and the fourth is a County
Municipal Court judge in Los Angeles.
Norris, Stanford's chief attorney in an

advisory board, hearing on the
dismissal of former English Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin, has referred to
Geo-Tek as Younger's "Watergate—one
of the major security frauds in the
history of California.".
'lnnuendo'
A Younger aide told the Daily these
are simply "innuendo charges" and
"the case is in the hands of federal
authorities."
Norris, a former president of the
Los Angeles Police Commission, said
Younger has "a track record of
favoring his cronies and giving them
special treatment under the law."
He criticized the attorney general
for not convening a grand jury to
investigate Richard Nixon's role in the
1971 Ellsberg break-in, and for not
forcing former Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke
to leave office immediately after he
was found guilty of perjury, instead of
allowing him to remain in office until
he was sentenced.
Law Enforcement
Younger, former municipal and
superior court judge, has gained
support from such groups as the
California Correctional Officers
Association; San Diego County
Sheriffs Association; and nearly 400
district attorneys, county sheriffs, and
police chiefs throughout California, his
aide said.
Norris, a former member of the
California State College Board of
Trustees and chairman of Robert F.
Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign
in California, has the expressed
support of the United Auto Workers
and the California Federation of
Teachers.
Younger, a brigadier general in the
U.S. Air Force Reserves and former
FBI agent, boasts of the leadership
role he took in the successful drive to
restore the death penalty. The
conservative attorney general stated
"that the absence of the death penalty
was costing lives."
Norris, on the other hand, is a
strong opponent of the death penalty,
calling it "inhumane and unsuccessful
in deterring crime."
'Era Of Superviolence'
Younger once worked for the
Office of Strategic Services, the
precursor to the CIA.
As a strong defender of "law and
order," Younger predicted the United
States is on the verge of "an era of
superviolence" by radical terrorist
groups, commencing most likely
during the nation's 200th birthday.
He proposed the establishment of a
terrorist strategy task force as a major
step in controlling such terrorism.
Younger endorses the present
