# Save Cyprus!
## 
### C. Mitsonas 
We, the undersigned, former
students and professors of
American universities, appeal to
you to exercise all your influence
on the American government to
take positive and effective steps
for the restoration of the
independence and territorial
integrity of Cyprus. Having
personal knowledge of the
American people and their beliefs,
we are certain they share our
views that:
—The abolishment of the
independence and territorial
integrity of Cyprus, member of
the U.N., and its tragic
consequences, is the most serious
crisis of the international system
since World War 11. Analogous
events of the 1935-39 period led
to the collapse of the
international system, to the
paralysis of the League of Nations
and finally to the outbreak of the
Second World War.
—The Cypriot crisis confirms
that the U.N., which was founded
on the burning desire of humanity
to secure peace, justice and
harmonious cooperation among
all the peoples, is ridiculed
whenever its decisions do not
serve the interests of the big
powers.
—Greece's withdrawal from
NATO does not simply mean the
loss of a member. It is a result of
the crisis of the basic principles of
the alliance, which is being used
by its strongest member as a
means to promote its own poorly
conceived natinal interests. In the
name of such interests, the
American foreign policy
supported the tyrranical Greek
dictatorship, with the well-known
consequences, while completely
ignoring the national interests of
the Greek people.
—Dr. Henry Kissinger's policy
of detente appears to be an
agreement between the big powers
to portion out the world

■ according to their interests. It
' seeks to bring us back to the
Metternich era, when the freedom
of small nations was sacrificed in
order to maintain the balance of
power.
—The Turkish invasion in
Cyprus is premeditated aggression
against an independent state,
using American economic and
military means. This renders the
American government equally
responsible for the resultant
international crisis and whatever
consequences may follow.
—lt is impossible for people to
remain in slavery, uprooted from
their homes, hungry and
desperate, all in the name of peace
and prosperity of the big powers.
Their struggle for independence
and freedom and for their basic
human rights will threaten world
peace even further.
—The American policy on the
Cypriot crisis does not represent
the founding principles of the
American Democracy and does
not express the views of the
majority of the American people.
As concerned citizens of the
world society, as former students
and professors of American
universities, we appeal to our
American colleagues, the
American academic community,
the American leadership, and all
the American people within the
framework of the true American
interests, of the consolidation of
world peace, of respect for the
principles of the United Nations
and of respect for basic human
rights to struggle with us to
restore the independence and
territorial integrity of Cyprus, to
avert the conquering plahs of the
Turks, to abolish all oppressive
dictatorships and to consolidate
democracy and freedom
throughout the world.

We, the undersigned, former
students and professors of
American universities, appeal to
you to exercise all your influence
on the American government to
take positive and effective steps
for the restoration of the
independence and territorial
integrity of Cyprus. Having
personal knowledge of the
American people and their beliefs,
we are certain they share our
views that:
—The abolishment of the
independence and territorial
integrity of Cyprus, member of
the U.N., and its tragic
consequences, is the most serious
crisis of the international system
since World War 11. Analogous
events of the 1935-39 period led
to the collapse of the
international system, to the
paralysis of the League of Nations
and finally to the outbreak of the
Second World War.
—The Cypriot crisis confirms
that the U.N., which was founded
on the burning desire of humanity
to secure peace, justice and
harmonious cooperation among
all the peoples, is ridiculed
whenever its decisions do not
serve the interests of the big
powers.
—Greece's withdrawal from
NATO does not simply mean the
loss of a member. It is a result of
the crisis of the basic principles of
the alliance, which is being used
by its strongest member as a
means to promote its own poorly
conceived natinal interests. In the
name of such interests, the
American foreign policy
supported the tyrranical Greek
dictatorship, with the well-known
consequences, while completely
ignoring the national interests of
the Greek people.
—Dr. Henry Kissinger's policy
of detente appears to be an
agreement between the big powers
to portion out the world

■ according to their interests. It
' seeks to bring us back to the
Metternich era, when the freedom
of small nations was sacrificed in
order to maintain the balance of
power.
—The Turkish invasion in
Cyprus is premeditated aggression
against an independent state,
using American economic and
military means. This renders the
American government equally
responsible for the resultant
international crisis and whatever
consequences may follow.
—lt is impossible for people to
remain in slavery, uprooted from
their homes, hungry and
desperate, all in the name of peace
and prosperity of the big powers.
Their struggle for independence
and freedom and for their basic
human rights will threaten world
peace even further.
—The American policy on the
Cypriot crisis does not represent
the founding principles of the
American Democracy and does
not express the views of the
majority of the American people.
As concerned citizens of the
world society, as former students
and professors of American
universities, we appeal to our
American colleagues, the
American academic community,
the American leadership, and all
the American people within the
framework of the true American
interests, of the consolidation of
world peace, of respect for the
principles of the United Nations
and of respect for basic human
rights to struggle with us to
restore the independence and
territorial integrity of Cyprus, to
