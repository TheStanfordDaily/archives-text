Becoming a physician is a tremendous
satisfaction.
Let us give you the job satisfaction
that should go with it.
Whether you're still in medical school with the
rigors of three to five years of graduate medical edu
cation still to be faced, or are already a practicing
physician, it's our opinion that the Air Force can
offer both professional and personal satisfaction
hard to duplicate in civilian life.
An overstatement? Not if you consider the
specifics.
Take the problem of graduate medical educa
tion. It's a period of your life the Air Force can make
considerably easier with comfortable salary and liv
ing conditions.
Creature comforts aside, the Air Force offers
professional advantages. Besides receiving training
in your own specialty, you'd be in contact with
physicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll
function in an environment which is intellectually
stimulating and professionally challenging.
Not all physicians pursue post residency fellow
ships. But if you are interested, the Air Force con
ducts them both in-house and atcivilian institutions.
The physician already in practice can look for
ward to other things. If you want training in the
practice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it
in the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on
group medicine and preventive medicine, and the
growing specialty of "family physician. Whatever
your interest, there are few specialties which are not
being practiced in today's Air Force.
The physician starting his practice in civilian
life has to take into account the cost of setting up an
office. The physician commencing his practice in
the Air Force does not. He finds his office established
for him. Supplies and equipment readily available.
He has many options available to him when treating
patients. For example, he can consult with Air Force
specialists, he also has referral to other Air Force
facilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not
least, are the satisfactions that come with having
the opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missed
appointment rate that is practically nil.
Whether you are already a physician, or soon to
become one, you might find it extremely interesting
to find out what the Air Force has to offer. We think
it could be a real eye-opener. If you' 11 mail in the cou
pon, we'd be happy to send you detailed information.
