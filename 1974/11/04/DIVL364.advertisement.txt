As a British company we'd like to explain our
810QX automatic turntable in plain English.
How the 810 QX reproduces
recorded music accurately.
The BSR 810QX has a sophisticated
synchronous motor, spinning a heavy
7-lb. platter for
voltage supply or
record load) and all-but-nonexistent
wow and flutter. Anti-skating force
optimum pressure with
sits perfectly centered
in groove for precise stereo
disc is integrated into the platter
design and a variable speed control is
provided should you want to vary
from, and later Feturn to, the normal
speeds. The tone arm will track as
low as 0.25 grams to make use of
finest light-weight, high-compliance
cartridges for maximum fidelity and
dynamic range.
How the 810 QX
protects records and
cartridge stylus assembly.
I manual cue and
pause control, for gentle contact
with record surface. Platter rubber
mat protects records
during play and cushions |
discs during automatic
drop. Automatic
uses umbrella-type
without outboard balance arm.
Stub spindle rotates with record to
prevent distortion of center hole..
Stylus setdown adjustment prevents
stylus damage if dropped outside of
pressure
wear. Stylus brush whisks dust off
wear meter records accumulated
stylus use in hours. Knowing when
protects your records.
How the 810 QX
provides convenient operation
in any desired mode.
After touching a single feather
weight button, the 810QX can
either: play a stack of
records, shutting off ify
after the last one,
play a single record . Qr
and shut off, or play
a single record, and
repeat it indefinitely until you stop it.
Manual operation
' vj JPrT uses a single button
t&m * to start the motor,
and the cue control to lower the
stylus.
How the 810 QX operates
emitting no sound
that can intrude on the music.
The 810QX uses a unique sequential
cam drive mechanism. It is a rigid
precision assembly that replaces the
plumber's nightmare of rotating
eccentric plates and interlocking gears
that other changers use. Unlike other
changers, there are no light metal
stampings that can go out of aligment
and make a lot of noise, from being
carried, bumped, or just from use.
