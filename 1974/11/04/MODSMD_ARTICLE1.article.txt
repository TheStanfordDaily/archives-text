# Flournoy, Brown Swap Accusations
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
In the state election race where the
stakes are highest, the rhetoric is
loudest.
That would be the campaign for
governor, where Republican nominee
. Houston Flournoy and Democratic
'nominee Edmund G. Brown Jr.
continue to swap charges and
innuendoes into the final hours of
their battle.
The stakes are indeed high: the
winner not only becomes chief
executive of the nation's largest state,
'but is instantly transformed "into a
national figure with no small clout
either as candidate or power-broker
when it comes to choosing a
presidential candidate in two years.
But right now, neither Brown nor
Flournoy can afford to look beyond
The last Mervin
Field-California Poll, taken between
Oct. 28 and 30, shows Brown with a
reasonably comfortable eight percent
lead. But that was still three percent
less than his lead a month earlier
and, as George McGovern found out
♦ two years ago, seemingly large leads
can slip away quickly in California.
Nonetheless, the campaign has
assumed the classic frontrunner-under
dog form: Flournoy has stepped pp
the stridency of his attacks on Brown
| and the frequency of his media
while Brown has tried to
keep his language temperate and has
even cut back on his commercials, to
the point where $BO,OOO originally
budgeted for a last-minute television
blitz has gone instead to support other
Democratic candidates.
4 Disasters
The tone of the campaign's last days
was captured in the last regionally
televised debates between the two
contenders. For example, on Saturday
night, Flournoy declared on KNBC-TV
in Los Angeles that Brown's election
be "disastrous" for California;
Brown said he thought Flournoy was
an intelligent man who would not be a
disaster for the state.
At another debate, Flournoy ran
down a series of earlier Brown
campaign charges, after each one
declaring, "That's a lie, Jerry, as you
*know." Flournoy has also likened
Brown to Richard Nixon, J. Edgar
Hoover and Barry Goldwater.
Brown, for his part, has charged
Flournoy with laxity in executing
some of the functions of his current
job as state controller, including
with big oil companies, banks,
and the Medi-Cal program all of
which Flournoy denies. And Brown
has also spent as much time running
against Nixon, Ford and Watergate as
he has against Flournoy.
Ideological Differences
* All those charges have largely taken
the place of fundamental ideological
differences between the candidates.
For while they have taken opposing
positions on many issues, observers say
that their fundamental philosophies
and approach to the governorship
radically different: both sound
like moderate liberals on social issues,
prudent conservatives on fiscal issues,
and both criticize to varying degrees
the eight-year conservative reign of
outgoing Republican Gov. Ronald
Reagan.
On some of the issues:
Neither candidate favors
decriminalization of marijuana.
However, Brown does favor easing
what he considers excessive penalties
for personal possession and use.
Brown favors the right of public
employees to strike; Flournoy doesn't.
—Flournoy favors construction of
the controversial New Mel ones dam;
Brown doesn't.
Brown vows he'll never live in the
$1.3 million governor's mansion for
which ground was broken last month;
Flournoy says he will.
Both candidates are critical of
President Ford's proposed five percent
income tax surcharge, saying that
middle-income families should be
excluded from it.
But in the absence of clear-cut
philosophical differences, it's been a
field day for name-calling on both
sides, and the allegations have come
from supporters as well as the
candidates themselves.
For example, Reagan, who has been
campaigning loyally for the
Republican ticket despite his
differences with Flournoy, charged
last month that Brown sounds "very
dictatorial to me," adding some of his
statements "sound like Sieg Heil." (He
later denied, however, that he was
calling Brown a Nazi.)
Meanwhile, a Brown backer accused
of improprieties as a member of the
Southern Coastal Regional
Commission accused the Republicans
of trying to discredit Brown through
him. (Brown promptly dissociated

himself from the official and called for
his resignation.)
But the brunt of the battle has
clearly been carried by the contenders
themselves. Both have had the money
needed to present themselves in the
most favorable light: each has spent
about $1.2 million. Both have received
national media attention Brown
appeared on the cover of Time
magazine and both have stumped
the state extensively.
