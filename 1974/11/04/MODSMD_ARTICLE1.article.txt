# Flournoy, Brown Swap Accusations
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
In the state election race where the
stakes are highest, the rhetoric is
loudest.
That would be the campaign for
governor, where Republican nominee
. Houston Flournoy and Democratic
'nominee Edmund G. Brown Jr.
continue to swap charges and
innuendoes into the final hours of
their battle.
The stakes are indeed high: the
winner not only becomes chief
executive of the nation's largest state,
'but is instantly transformed "into a
national figure with no small clout
either as candidate or power-broker
when it comes to choosing a
presidential candidate in two years.
But right now, neither Brown nor
Flournoy can afford to look beyond
The last Mervin
Field-California Poll, taken between
Oct. 28 and 30, shows Brown with a
reasonably comfortable eight percent
lead. But that was still three percent
less than his lead a month earlier
and, as George McGovern found out
♦ two years ago, seemingly large leads
can slip away quickly in California.
Nonetheless, the campaign has
assumed the classic frontrunner-under
dog form: Flournoy has stepped pp
the stridency of his attacks on Brown
| and the frequency of his media
while Brown has tried to
keep his language temperate and has
even cut back on his commercials, to
the point where $BO,OOO originally
budgeted for a last-minute television
blitz has gone instead to support other
Democratic candidates.
4 Disasters
The tone of the campaign's last days
was captured in the last regionally
televised debates between the two
contenders. For example, on Saturday
night, Flournoy declared on KNBC-TV
in Los Angeles that Brown's election
be "disastrous" for California;
Brown said he thought Flournoy was
an intelligent man who would not be a
disaster for the state.
At another debate, Flournoy ran
down a series of earlier Brown
campaign charges, after each one
declaring, "That's a lie, Jerry, as you
*know." Flournoy has also likened
Brown to Richard Nixon, J. Edgar
Hoover and Barry Goldwater.
Brown, for his part, has charged
Flournoy with laxity in executing
some of the functions of his current
job as state controller, including
with big oil companies, banks,
and the Medi-Cal program all of
which Flournoy denies. And Brown
has also spent as much time running
against Nixon, Ford and Watergate as
he has against Flournoy.
Ideological Differences
* All those charges have largely taken
the place of fundamental ideological
differences between the candidates.
For while they have taken opposing
positions on many issues, observers say
that their fundamental philosophies
and approach to the governorship
radically different: both sound
like moderate liberals on social issues,
prudent conservatives on fiscal issues,
