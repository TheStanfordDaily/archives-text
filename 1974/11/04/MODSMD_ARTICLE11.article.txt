# State GOP At The Crossroads
## 
### Rich Jaroslovsky 
Overlooked in the controversy
surrounding the future of the national
Republican party is the fact that the
California GOP may be at a similarly fateful
crossroads. The outcome of tomorrow's
statewide election could determine the fate
of the party's progressive wing, once the
dominant force in state politics but steadily
weakening for 20 years.
The threat to the progressives, surprisingly
enough, doesn't come from the Democrats.
Rather, it is posed by their own fellow
Republicans from the party's conservative
wing.
The key race in this intra-party struggle is
the gubernatorial battle between Republican
Houston Flournoy the first GOP
progressive to win the nomination since Earl
Warren in 1950 and Democrat Edmund G.
Brown Jr. If Flournoy wins, he will have the
chance to take control of the party apparatus
and reshape it in his own image. But if Brown
wins and the California Poll still shows him
With an eight percent lead then the
currently dominant conservatives will simply
pick up the pieces and solidify their control.
Convoluted
This convoluted situation is the result of
the Republican primary, during which the
conservative candidate and heavy favorite,
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke, was indicted and
convicted of perjury in the ITT affair.
Meanwhile, conservatives nailed down most
other nominations, lending credence to the
belief that Flournoy's nomination was more
a result of Reinecke's problems than of a
resurgence of progressivism.
That it took an indictment and conviction
to nominate a GOP moderate is just another
indication of how far the progressive
movement has fallen. But for decades from
1910 into the 1950s that movement held

sway not just over the party but over the
entire state.
The California progressive movement in
the GOP dates back to Hiram Johnson,
governor in the first decade of the century
and then five-term U.S. senator. So complete
was the Johnson-progressive domination of
the state that only one Democrat was elected
governor between 1900 and 1958.
Decline Of Progressivism
That tradition was extended by Earl
Warren, who served longer (1943-1953) than
any other governor of California. But
Warren's departure to become Chief Justice
of the United States marked the beginning of
the decline of state Republican progressivism.
Warren was succeeded by Lt. Gov.
Goodwin J. Knight, an affable
middle-of-the-roader who won election in his
own right in 1954, but who was no Warren in
either his political views or his popularity
with the electorate. In 1958, though, the
conservatives staged the coup that nearly
destroyed the Republican Party but
established them in control of the party. U.S.
Sen. William Knowland, a strong conservative
who succeeded Johnson in office, announced
his candidacy for governor in opposition to
Knight's renomination.
A hasty compromise, partially engineered
by then-Vice President Richard Nixon, gave
the unhappy Knight the nomination for
Knowland's Senate seat. But the outspoken
Knowland often known as "the senator
from Formosa" for his right-wing foreign
policy views hitched his and the party's
wagon to a controversial "right to work"
ballot initiative that would have outlawed
closed union shops. The result was a
Democratic landslide that swept both Knight
and Knowland out of public life.

Despite the debacle of 1958, the
conservative wing managed to maintain and
even increase its control over the party,
nominating Richard Nixon for governor in
1962, George Murphy for the Senate in 1964
and 1970 and Ronald Reagan for governor in
1966 and 1970. The final defeat of the
progressives came when incumbent Sen.
Thomas Kuchel was ousted in the 1968
primary by Max Rafferty, then state
superintendent of public instruction. That of
all those conservatives nominated since 1958,
only Reagan (twice) and Murphy (once)
emerged victorious, has not noticeably
weakened the conservative grip on the party.
Reinecke's legal troubles gave the
progressives, 1974 style, one more chance.
But the fact is that their ranks have already
been deciminated by setbacks such as the loss
of John Veneman in the lieutenant
governor's primary and the two surviving
candidates, Flournoy and controller nominee
William Bagley, are both trailing their
Democratic opponents, although both are at
least within range of upsets.
ThÂ«| irony here, of course, is that under
different circumstances and in another year,
the moderates might right now be in the
process of sweeping back into power, rather
than struggling to play catch-up.
But the new "post-Watergate mentality"
and its concurrent backlash against most
things Republican has proven difficult, if not
impossible, to overcome and the same
forces that combined to give the progressives
one last shot at control of the party are now
working to see that the Democrats win.
And the conservatives will be left to pick
up the pieces.
