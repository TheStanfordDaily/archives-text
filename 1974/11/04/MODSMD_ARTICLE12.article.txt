# Save The Stanislaus: Vote No On 17
## 
### Kim Nyegaard 
Environmentalists, especially
from the "pollution-free" cities of
Los Angeles and San Francisco,
have been trying to educate the
"environmentally ignorant"
Central Valley farmers and
citizens of California into
supporting Prop. 17.
I have been very intrigued by
many of the supporters and their
"expert" knowledge on the
Stanislaus geographical area.
These people possibly have visited
the concerned area once or twice
during their summer vacation and
now consider themselves
protectors of their beautiful
California Wildlife.
I have lived 12 of my 18 years
of life in the San Joaquin Valley
through which the Stanislaus
River flows. During these years I
have observed yearly flooding of
our prime agricultural land and a
continuing deterioration of the
Stanislaus River both in water
quality and shoreline beauty.
But these are not the only
reasons why Prop. 17 must be
defeated and the New Melones
Dam must be completed. There
are five major arguments, that
indicate the importance of the
New Melones Dam.
Low Water Quality
First of all, the water quality of
the Stanislaus River is so low that
streamside vegetation along the
lower river has declined 80
percent in the last 15 years. The
Department of Fish and Game
estimates that 50 percent of what
remains will be gone by 1980.
Shocking? Now for more realities:
salmon spawning has declined an
average of 6000 per year over the
last 11 years. Floods mercilessly
kill fish and other wildlife in the
winter months, and summer is just
as bad.
Something must be done to
establish an equilibrium. If this
water balance is established not
only will it improve the natural
wildlife but also uphold the work
of hard-working farmers in this
agricultural heartland of
California. Every spring when
flooding occurs it causes the
destruction of over a $1 million
worth of damage in property,
wildlife, lifestock and crops.

The second major reason for
defeating Pro. 17 is that the
Stanislaus is not a "wild" river in
its natural state. The reason the
"whitewaters" of the Stanislaus
exist is because of releases from
upstream mountain dams.
Thirdly, recreational facilities
provided by the new lake could
serve and benefit many more
people than the present
Whitewater area. Presently
combining both public and private
shoreline, rafting accounts for
26,000 "recreation days." The
New Melones Dam with its 20
square miles of water would have
the capacity to serve four million
visitors annually.
There are federal government

plans to establish 12
park-campgrounds along a 59-mile
stretch of the river. Nine new
parks will be purchased to provide
canoeing trips with trails not
accessible by motor vehicles.
Another important reason to
support the dam project is that
the water is needed to correct
problems caused by pumping
more ground water each year than
is replaced. Also another energy
saver is the non-polluting
production of 430 million
kilowatt hours of annual
electricity. This would not require
fossil fuel, thereby saving 700,000
barrels of crude oil.
Government Support
Finally, the New Melones Dam

has the approval of the federal
and state governments. This is
important because it would be a
waste 1 of time and taxpayers'
money to leave the New Melones
Dam half completed. By Dec. 31,
$B5 million will have been spent
on this project. Additionally the
state and the four counties
directly affected have spent $6
million on road and bridge work
to accommodate the project.
In conclusion, many people and
environmentalists including many
San Joaquin-Stanislaus Basin
Sierra Club members and officers,
urge you to study the facts of
Prop. 17.

our prime agricultural land and a
continuing deterioration of the
Stanislaus River both in water
quality and shoreline beauty.
But these are not the only
reasons why Prop. 17 must be
defeated and the New Melones
Dam must be completed. There
are five major arguments, that
indicate the importance of the
New Melones Dam.
Low Water Quality
First of all, the water quality of
the Stanislaus River is so low that
streamside vegetation along the
lower river has declined 80
percent in the last 15 years. The
Department of Fish and Game
estimates that 50 percent of what
remains will be gone by 1980.
Shocking? Now for more realities:
salmon spawning has declined an
average of 6000 per year over the
last 11 years. Floods mercilessly
kill fish and other wildlife in the
winter months, and summer is just
as bad.
Something must be done to
establish an equilibrium. If this
water balance is established not
only will it improve the natural
wildlife but also uphold the work
of hard-working farmers in this
agricultural heartland of
California. Every spring when
flooding occurs it causes the
destruction of over a $1 million
worth of damage in property,
wildlife, lifestock and crops.

The second major reason for
defeating Pro. 17 is that the
Stanislaus is not a "wild" river in
its natural state. The reason the
"whitewaters" of the Stanislaus
exist is because of releases from
upstream mountain dams.
Thirdly, recreational facilities
provided by the new lake could
serve and benefit many more
people than the present
Whitewater area. Presently
combining both public and private
shoreline, rafting accounts for
26,000 "recreation days." The
New Melones Dam with its 20
square miles of water would have
the capacity to serve four million
visitors annually.
There are federal government

plans to establish 12
park-campgrounds along a 59-mile
stretch of the river. Nine new
parks will be purchased to provide
canoeing trips with trails not
accessible by motor vehicles.
Another important reason to
support the dam project is that
the water is needed to correct
problems caused by pumping
more ground water each year than
is replaced. Also another energy
saver is the non-polluting
production of 430 million
kilowatt hours of annual
electricity. This would not require
fossil fuel, thereby saving 700,000
barrels of crude oil.
Government Support
Finally, the New Melones Dam

has the approval of the federal
and state governments. This is
important because it would be a
waste 1 of time and taxpayers'
money to leave the New Melones
Dam half completed. By Dec. 31,
$B5 million will have been spent
on this project. Additionally the
state and the four counties
directly affected have spent $6
million on road and bridge work
to accommodate the project.
In conclusion, many people and
environmentalists including many
San Joaquin-Stanislaus Basin
Sierra Club members and officers,
urge you to study the facts of
Prop. 17.
(Kim Nyegaard is a Daily staffer.)
Environmentalists, especially
from the "pollution-free" cities of
Los Angeles and San Francisco,
have been trying to educate the
"environmentally ignorant"
Central Valley farmers and
citizens of California into
supporting Prop. 17.
I have been very intrigued by
many of the supporters and their
"expert" knowledge on the
Stanislaus geographical area.
These people possibly have visited
the concerned area once or twice
during their summer vacation and
now consider themselves
protectors of their beautiful
California Wildlife.
I have lived 12 of my 18 years
of life in the San Joaquin Valley
through which the Stanislaus
River flows. During these years I
have observed yearly flooding of
