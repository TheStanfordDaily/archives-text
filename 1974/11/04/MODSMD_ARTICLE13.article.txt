# More Cooperation Needed
## 
### Anne S. Miner 
I asked a few friends and colleagues what their
impression was of my informal CROW lecture as
reported by the Daily (Oct. 30). They all said that
it sounded either indecisive, or nutty, or both.
Since I care about the accuracy of remarks
attributed to me, I'm writing this letter.
I never spoke, for example, about anybody
"infiltrating" anything, nor did I suggest women
and/or members of ethnic minorities are necessarily
hired by "conservative" males. What I did do was
answer a question about the following issue.
If one assumes there are sex-linked differences in
cognitive style and approaches to problem-solving,
then one would conclude that eventually the full
participation of men and women in higher
education might broaden the way we solve
problems. It would shift the center, so to speak, of
approaches to problem-solving. In that model,
diversity might lead to more emphasis on
cooperative rather than competitive
problem-solving, or on "affiliative" versus
"achievement" value.
No One-Step Process
In that context , I noted that even if this does
happen it will not happen in a one-step process.
That is, the women and minorities who participate
first as leaders and policy makers will quite
naturally be those whose skills and approaches are
those that work now. Skills that fit in with the
current ways of doing things. The words "radical"
and "conservative" do not seem helpful in this
context.
Actually, the basic point of my speech was very

simple. I described two assumptions: 1) The
purpose of education for men and women is
different, because of different life missions and 2)
The "normal" student is a male.l said that these two
assumptions, in various forms, have affected most
people's behavior until very recently. I then
considered what happens if you reject those
assumptions, and try to determine an educational
institution's proper role in meeting student needs.
For example, I did not say that "educators have
failed to meet women's counseling needs." Until
very recently the two assumptions above were
shared by most everyone, including students,
parents, faculty, alumni and administrators.
Institutions met the perceived needs.
Difficult Questions
Now, however, we face the question of what
happens if you don't make those assumptions.
Some difficult questions arise, for example, about
the adequacy of an "entrepreneurial" system of
career counseling. If women have been socialized
not to hold themselves accountable for developing
their own career paths, or for seeking opportunity
aggressively, a "passive" counseling system might
well serve current women less well than it serves
men. Counseling was one of about six areas that I
discussed in this way.

problems. It would shift the center, so to speak, of
approaches to problem-solving. In that model,
diversity might lead to more emphasis on
cooperative rather than competitive
problem-solving, or on "affiliative" versus
"achievement" value.
No One-Step Process
In that context , I noted that even if this does
happen it will not happen in a one-step process.
That is, the women and minorities who participate
first as leaders and policy makers will quite
naturally be those whose skills and approaches are
those that work now. Skills that fit in with the
current ways of doing things. The words "radical"
and "conservative" do not seem helpful in this
context.
Actually, the basic point of my speech was very

simple. I described two assumptions: 1) The
purpose of education for men and women is
different, because of different life missions and 2)
The "normal" student is a male.l said that these two
assumptions, in various forms, have affected most
people's behavior until very recently. I then
considered what happens if you reject those
assumptions, and try to determine an educational
institution's proper role in meeting student needs.
For example, I did not say that "educators have
failed to meet women's counseling needs." Until
very recently the two assumptions above were
shared by most everyone, including students,
parents, faculty, alumni and administrators.
Institutions met the perceived needs.
Difficult Questions
Now, however, we face the question of what
happens if you don't make those assumptions.
Some difficult questions arise, for example, about
the adequacy of an "entrepreneurial" system of
career counseling. If women have been socialized
not to hold themselves accountable for developing
their own career paths, or for seeking opportunity
aggressively, a "passive" counseling system might
well serve current women less well than it serves
men. Counseling was one of about six areas that I
discussed in this way.

I asked a few friends and colleagues what their
impression was of my informal CROW lecture as
reported by the Daily (Oct. 30). They all said that
it sounded either indecisive, or nutty, or both.
Since I care about the accuracy of remarks
attributed to me, I'm writing this letter.
I never spoke, for example, about anybody
"infiltrating" anything, nor did I suggest women
and/or members of ethnic minorities are necessarily
hired by "conservative" males. What I did do was
answer a question about the following issue.
If one assumes there are sex-linked differences in
cognitive style and approaches to problem-solving,
then one would conclude that eventually the full
participation of men and women in higher
education might broaden the way we solve
problems. It would shift the center, so to speak, of
approaches to problem-solving. In that model,
diversity might lead to more emphasis on
cooperative rather than competitive
problem-solving, or on "affiliative" versus
"achievement" value.
