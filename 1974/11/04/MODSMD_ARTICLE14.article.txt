Male Condescension?
Editor,
Mike Berdan's response (Daily,
Oct. 29) to Terri Borchers'
criticism of the Daily's article on
Carol Doda's breasts demonstrates
typically shallow thought
concerning the issue of sexism.
"Women's liberation is a worthy
cause" writes Berdan, the latter
term reminding one of the March
of Dimes. "Causes are advanced
by calm debate and controlled
effective presentation." Who is he
kidding? Since when have any
major societal changes occurred
due to calm debate? It is only
because people become angry and
react to oppression that any
changes follow.
I detect the feeling on Berdan's
part that "women's liberation" is
a probably, short-lived phase;
women have a few gripes about
underpaid work and Playboy
magazine and these problems will
be ironed out soon and that's all
there is to it. If this were true
perhaps calm debate would be the
solution.
But it is not true. Creating a
world in which the female is not
regarded as secondary and
subordinate to the male will mean
overthrowing the most basic
balance of power in human
society it will mean a total
revolution. Such a revolution will
cause a great deal of trauma for
both women and men, trauma
that will not be resolved by cool
speeches or controlled
presentations.
I am disgusted by Berdan's
opinion that Borchers is "biting
the hand that feeds her." It seems
that his idea of liberation consists
of women coaxing a few more
crumbs of power out of the hands
of men. This is not the goal of
feminism. The goal of feminism, I
think, is for neither sex to need or
desire the power to control the
other sex.
I wish very much that Berdan,
and men like him who feel
Borchers is overreacting in
expressing honest anger in her
letter, would give serious thought
to the following question. How
would you feel if you'd been born
female into a society whose views
about your sex were reflected in
such choice lines as "Women are
good for one thing," "Women like
to be raped" and "Fuck a woman
and she's yours for life?"

Iranian Plight
Editor:
Belonging to a country
bordering Iran, I read (Daily, Oct.
30) with much concern the plight
of the Iranian people with whom
we have much in common owing
to the bonds which are reflected
in the cultural literary heritage
shared by our two nations.
Unfortunately the American
people have been kept in the dark
about the reign of terror let loose
in Iran.
The Shah Â«of Iran has been
presented here as a benevolent
"constitutional" monarch, with
an enchanting wife. Little g do
people know about the despotism
of a well-entrenched ruling group.
The foreign affairs of any
country are organically related to
its internal situation. The Shah of
Iran has special relationships with
both the United States and
U.S.S.R.
Besides the biggest supplier of
arms, the United States, has
supplied the Iranian police with
29,960 weapons, 15 aircraft, 1040
jeeps and motor vehicles, 1,602
quarter-ton trucks, and 2,000 tear
gas grenades.
The question naturally arises,
why is this Iranian despot building
up this arsenal? Who does he want
to fight? The U.S.S.R. is
obviously ruled out. Weak and
internally divided Iraq could be a
target, but the U.S.S.R. has taken
Iraq under its wing. Afghanistan is
not worth the trouble.
This leaves only his internal
opponents to take care of. One
wonders if there is another Hitler
in the making only this time
with American support and the
place South Asia.

Gratitude Expressed
Editor:
Although belatedly, I would
like to say a big thank you to all
those people of the Stanford
community, students, professors
and members of the
Administration who expressed
their concern about my fate
during my incarceration in
isolation by the Athens security
genermerie. Fortunately, the junta
is gone and I am free.
With this letter, I would like to
express my gratitude for the
active concern of all these people
and urge everybody to continue
his/her concern for all political
prisoners who unfortunately exist
in so many parts of the world.
