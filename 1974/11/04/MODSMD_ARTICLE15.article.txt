# In Defense of McCloskey
## 
### Stan Wilson 
As a former Daily Editorial Board member, I was
disappointed but not surprised that the newspaper
failed to endorse Rep. Paul N. McCloskey in the
12th Congressional district race.
I served as managing editor of the DaUy a year
ago, and during that time I participated in countless
edit board meetings. I am only too aware that that
body is inclined, on occasion, to make arbitrary
and ill-informed decisions. Last Wednesday's
editorial is based upon several factual errors; it is
obvious that the author failed to do her homework.
Apparently, the Daily is concerned that
McCloskey's political posture has become too
"conservative." Despite McCloskey's politically
precarious stands against the Vietnam war and for
the impeachment of Richard Nixon, the Daily
remains unconvinced.
No, he's too conservative, they say, ignoring his
stand on liberalized abortion laws,
decriminalization of marijuana, unconditional
amnesty and the abolition of the death penalty.
The positions of a "conservative?" The thought
would surely make Gordon Knapp turn over in his
political grave.
Irresponsible Attack
The Daily's attack on McCloskey's record on
conservation issues is irresponsible. As recently as a
week ago, McCloskey stated that the adoption of a
strong anti-strip mining bill was one of his
legislative priorities. The list of conservation groups
who back McCloskey's reelection bid is impressive.
The California League of Conservation Voters
recently endorsed McCloskey, giving him a 94
percent rating for his voting record on conservation
issues. The Executive Board of the California
Coastal Alliance also endorsed McCloskey,
explaining that "Pete has been unswerving
(emphasis added) in his integrity and balanced
judgment on the important environmental issues of
our time."
Serious Mistakes
If anyone on the Daily Editorial Board had
bothered to speak with McCloskey, as is usually the
case when political endorsements are being
considered, some of the serious mistakes could have
been avoided. The Daily editorial notes that
McCloskey originally voted against the equal rights
amendment, but it seems that no one really wanted

to know why.
The fact is that McCloskey voted against the
amendment because it came before the House after
only an hour of debate; Congress usually gives more
careful consideration to the drafting of leash laws
for dogs. McCloskey felt that a document which
has been amended only 26 times in nearly 200
years deserved a little more discussion. After
revision, McCloskey automatically supported the
Amendment the next time it came to a vote.
Inexcusable Argument
The Daily's final argument is inexcusable. The
editorial argues that McCloskey's strategy is to
placate both his "liberal supporters and
conservative financiers." Once again, the Daily
offers no evidence to support its claim. A simple
phone call to the McCloskey office would have
revealed that the Congressman's largest
contribution in this campaign $l,OOO came
from the California Teacher's Association, a group
which is primarily Democratic and about as
wealthy as a Stanford student after paying tuition.
The Daily's failure to endorse either candidate
implies that neither is capable of handling the job.
But McCloskey has had seven years of experience,
and has earned the respect of members of both
parties for his independence and integrity.
Columnist Jack Anderson calls him one of the 15
"guttiest" members of Congress. The liberal
Committee for an effective Congress endorses
McCloskey as one of those candidates with the
"will and backbone to deal with the long-neglected
problems of the economy, the environment,
housing and other social ills."
/
I disagree with McCloskey on many issues, but I
was one of the 1400 Stanford students who
re-registered last spring in order to vote for him in
the primary. The next two years will probably be
among the most critical this country has seen in
peacetime, and my concern, last spring and now
is that we elect the most qualified candidate to
Congress, regardless of whether he is Democrat or
Republican, "liberal" or "conservative."
