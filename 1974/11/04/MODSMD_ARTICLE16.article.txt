## Reagan Stigma Maligns Flournoy 
### Batts, et. al 
. Unfortunately, for both the
GOP and the state of California,
Houston Flournoy is still suffering
from a stigma that has plagued
him throughout his gubernatorial
campaign. And now, it seems that
the Daily has also jumped on
Jerry Brown's band wagon,
charging guilt by association.

It should be clear that it is
Flournoy who is running for
governor, not Ronald Reagan,
David Packard, or Richard Nixon.
Although he, too, is a Republican,
Flournoy is a moderate of proven
integrity and independence.
Several times he has split with the
regular party line on such issues as
education, civil liberties and
environmental planning.
In 1964, Flournoy, as a
California assemblyman,
supported the Rumford Open
Housing Act; Reagan did not. In
1961, during litigation of the
Serrano vs. Priest education
decision, he was one of the few
Republicans to come out in favor
of equal Financial opportunity for
every school district. In 1972,
against the advice of party
regulars, he filed a brief in the
California Supreme Court, as a
friend of the court, advocating
that "the quality of a child's
education should not be

dependent on the wealth of his
school district," and urging
implementation of the provisions
of the decision.
Differs With Reagan
Flournoy, in 1967, urged
withholding of state income tax.
Reagan adamantly opposed it for
four years, before also adopting
the same view.
In 1969, Flournoy, as chairman
of the State Lands Commission,
ordered a halt to oil drilling in the
Santa Barbara channel. When
drilling was resumed in 1973,
Flournoy insisted on stricter state
regulations as opposed to the
looser federal controls which the
big oil companies favored.
Throughout his two terms as
controller in the Reagan
administration, Flournoy has been
his own man, challenging the
governor on several issues. In
August, 1973, he publicly
questioned Reagan's use of state
funds for his Prop. 1
campaign. Reagan was then forced
to ask his own campaign
contributors to pay the disputed
bills.
Special Session
In October of the same year,
Flournoy called for a court review
and a legislative special session to
review Reagan's new welfare

levels, while Reagan claimed the
authority to set the levels without
legislative consent. The courts
rejected Reagan's position.
While he himself has been
unblemished by the Watergate
scandal, Flournoy spoke out in
support of Elliot Richardson's
resignation in protest over the
firing of Special Prosecutor
Archibald Cox in the 1973
"Saturday Night Massacre," while
Reagan supported Nixon's
actions. Again, this year,
Flournoy opposed the Nixon
pardon by President Ford, while
Reagan praised it.
Not Reagan's Choice
Flournoy was not Reagan's
choice for the Republican
nomination for governor. But, in
the wake of Watergate, with
former Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke first
indicted, then convicted of
perjury in the ITT scandal,
Reagan, Packard and other
conservatives have had no
alternative but to support
Flournoy. His base of support is
wide,encompassing the McCloskey
wing of the GOP, and crossing
party lines to include William
Armenio, former chairman of
Californians for Alioto for
Governor and Larry Lawrence,
co-chairman of Bob Moretti's

gubernatorial campaign.
Californians do have a choice as
they go to the polls next Tuesday.
But it is not a choice of Jerry
Brown versus continued
Reaganism. It is a very different
race between Jerry Brown and
Houston Flournoy.

four years, before also adopting
the same view.
In 1969, Flournoy, as chairman
of the State Lands Commission,
ordered a halt to oil drilling in the
Santa Barbara channel. When
drilling was resumed in 1973,
Flournoy insisted on stricter state
regulations as opposed to the
looser federal controls which the
big oil companies favored.
Throughout his two terms as
controller in the Reagan
administration, Flournoy has been
his own man, challenging the
governor on several issues. In
August, 1973, he publicly
questioned Reagan's use of state
funds for his Prop. 1
campaign. Reagan was then forced
to ask his own campaign
contributors to pay the disputed
bills.
Special Session
In October of the same year,
Flournoy called for a court review
and a legislative special session to
review Reagan's new welfare

levels, while Reagan claimed the
authority to set the levels without
legislative consent. The courts
rejected Reagan's position.
While he himself has been
unblemished by the Watergate
scandal, Flournoy spoke out in
support of Elliot Richardson's
resignation in protest over the
firing of Special Prosecutor
Archibald Cox in the 1973
"Saturday Night Massacre," while
Reagan supported Nixon's
actions. Again, this year,
Flournoy opposed the Nixon
pardon by President Ford, while
Reagan praised it.
Not Reagan's Choice
Flournoy was not Reagan's
choice for the Republican
nomination for governor. But, in
the wake of Watergate, with
former Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke first
indicted, then convicted of
perjury in the ITT scandal,
Reagan, Packard and other
conservatives have had no
alternative but to support
Flournoy. His base of support is
wide,encompassing the McCloskey
wing of the GOP, and crossing
party lines to include William
Armenio, former chairman of
Californians for Alioto for
Governor and Larry Lawrence,
co-chairman of Bob Moretti's

gubernatorial campaign.
Californians do have a choice as
they go to the polls next Tuesday.
But it is not a choice of Jerry
Brown versus continued
Reaganism. It is a very different
race between Jerry Brown and
Houston Flournoy.
(Kathy Batts, Luis Buhler, Ed
Anderson and Steve Herum are

. Unfortunately, for both the
GOP and the state of California,
Houston Flournoy is still suffering
from a stigma that has plagued
him throughout his gubernatorial
campaign. And now, it seems that
the Daily has also jumped on
Jerry Brown's band wagon,
charging guilt by association.

It should be clear that it is
Flournoy who is running for
governor, not Ronald Reagan,
David Packard, or Richard Nixon.
Although he, too, is a Republican,
Flournoy is a moderate of proven
integrity and independence.
Several times he has split with the
regular party line on such issues as
education, civil liberties and
environmental planning.
In 1964, Flournoy, as a
California assemblyman,
supported the Rumford Open
Housing Act; Reagan did not. In
1961, during litigation of the
Serrano vs. Priest education
decision, he was one of the few
Republicans to come out in favor
of equal Financial opportunity for
every school district. In 1972,
against the advice of party
regulars, he filed a brief in the
California Supreme Court, as a
friend of the court, advocating
that "the quality of a child's
education should not be

dependent on the wealth of his
school district," and urging
implementation of the provisions
of the decision.
Differs With Reagan
Flournoy, in 1967, urged
withholding of state income tax.
Reagan adamantly opposed it for
four years, before also adopting
the same view.
