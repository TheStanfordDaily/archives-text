# Symposia On Public Policy Scheduled
## 
### 
The Dickinson Symposia, a new
program on public policies and
issues, will begin Nov. 14,
Undergraduate Studies Dean
James L. Gibbs disclosed.
Fairleigh Dickinson Jr.,
chairman of the Becton,
Dickinson Co. of Rutherford, N.J.
donated a gift which in part made
the program possible.
The purpose of the Dickinson
Fund is to develop the link
between public policy and the
social and behavioral sciences,
thereby furthering undergraduate
education. . .
The gift will support the
program for the first two years.
The goal of the program is to
"intensify Stanford's intellectual
life by bringing this community
together for shared lectures and
discussions that combine a focus
on public policy and issues of
current concern with serious and
varied intellectual treatment,"
Gibbs said.
The first symposium will be on
the experts' roles in public policy
formation and will include eight
lectures during the autumn and
winter quarters. Each session will
be in Bishop Auditorium at 8 p.m.
on Thursdays and will be free.
