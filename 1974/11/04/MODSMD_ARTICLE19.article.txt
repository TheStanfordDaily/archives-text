"Stanford students would have done as well in
life if they had gone somewhere else," Assoc.
Sociology Prof. John Meyer said Thursday.
Delivering the fourth lecture of the Tresidder
Program Board's "Themes in Contemporary
America" series, Meyer claimed, "It matters a great
deal how much education an individual gets in
terms of years, but it doesn't matter where he gets
.. b
it.
Research studies have indicated that most high
schools and colleges in this country have
comparable levels of quality, but "prestige
differences" elevate certain schools above the
norm, Meyer said.
Faculty Quality
The reason that the quality of education differs
little among schools is that the faculty quality
varies little, he said.
"Teachers of a greater or lesser quality are
equally distributed throughout schools. The average
school has 30 percent acceptable teachers," he said.
The value of a college degree is derived from our
society's belief that "you hire college graduates,"

he said, adding that college graduates are bound to
succeed in their careers because, "the people who
hire them expect them to do well and make sure
they do well."
Authority
Individuals are given authority in our society
often on the basis of their academic credentials
alone, he explained.
In this case, the myth of education "functions in
society to define not only the nature of authority,
but which people have that authority," he noted.
The myth of education is preserved and
perpetuated by the unquestioning faith which the
society has in it, said Meyer, adding, "education is a
myth, like for example, Baptism is a myth. It is a
kind of secular regilion in one sense, in that it
explains the unexplicable."
Thus, the myth of education has some positive
value in our society, because as long as the people
believe in the educational system, they will
continue to support it and participate in it, he said,
claiming that should the society cease to believe in
the myth of education, schools would qertainly
become a thing of the past.
