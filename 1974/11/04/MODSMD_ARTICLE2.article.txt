# Gillmor Trailing In Congressional Race
## Polls Predict A Victory For McCloskey 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) seems likely to defeat
Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor
tomorrow in the 12th Congressional
District but says he's frustrated with
the intellectual quality of the
campaign. ,
McCloskey, leading by a 2-1 margin
according to most polls, contends that
Gillmor has ignored substantive issues
in the 11 debates between the
candidates.
According to McCloskey, Gillmor
has bypassed the issues to quibble
about details of campaign financing,
generalize about the need for social
reform and quote his opponent's
record out of context on subjects such
as women's rights.
Gillmor charges that McCloskey
"has been playing both ends against
the middle," bidding for liberal
support on college campuses and
wooing conservative votes in wealthy
suburbs.
Although Gillmor admits that he is
behind in the polls, he told the Daily
last week that "I still have a real
chance of winning." But McCloskey
says he is also confident of victory.
'Mistrust'
Gillmor contended that Ford's
pardon of Nixon "has created mistrust
for the Republican Party in general,"
and weakened McCloskey's contention
that Ford is an honest man.
Gillmor also insisted that
McCloskey's recent congressional
junket to London has hurt his
campaign.
"While he's in England, I'm walking
precincts, explaining my record to
people," Gillmor said. "McCloskey has
an obligation to be in the district
during the final weeks of the campaign
to discuss the issues with his
constituents."
Gillmor also complained about
McCloskey's cancellation of three
debates.
McCloskey contends that

congressional business must take
precedence over partisan campaigning,
noting that his views are well known
to 12th District voters.
Economic policies have provided a
polemical topic in most
McCloskey-Gillmor debates. Both
candidates oppose Ford's five percent
surtax on incomes, but emphasize
different points.
McCloskey says the surtax is too
insignificant to cripple inflation, and
aimed at too many low-income people
but admits that it may spur Congress
to initiate the comprehensive tax
reform which McCloskey strongly
advocates.
Tax Credits
Gillmor claims that since the surtax
will last only for one year while Ford's
tax credits for business will continue
indefinitely, the surtax "is a sneaky
way of adding to profits."
Although McCloskey has praised
Ford's anti-trust proposals as
"superb," Gillmor says they are far
too incomplete.
Gillmor insists that oil depletion
allowances should be terminated, but
McCloskey has expressed reservations

about interfering with private
enterprise.
A unique feature of the
McCloskey-Gillmor campaign was the
agreement to limit spending to
$15,000 and refuse contributions of
more than $lOO. McCloskey waived
his franking privilege for materials that
might help his campaign.
Both candidates claimed that the
agreement gave credibility to their
calls for campaign financing reform.
But Gillmor repeatedly stated that
McCloskey's support of campaign
reform was hypocritical since he was
among the leading spenders in the
nation during earlier campaigns,
especially primary races.
McCloskey countered by noting
that his GOP primary opponents have
tended to be wealthy candidates who
insisted upon spending large sums of
money. McCloskey noted that he
limited his spending at the first
opportunity.
Ignoring Issues
Gillmor has emphasized that he
spent only $94 in his last race for
mayor, allowing McCloskey to protest
that Gillmor is ignoring important

issues.
Both candidates support the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) but
Gillmor has resurrected early
statements by McCloskey poking fun
at the women's movements.
McCloskey notes that he has not
only suppported the ERA in Congress,
but has worked to for its ratification.
Although Gillmor has attacked
McCloskey for sending the ERA back
to committee at one point, McCloskey
claims he was only attempting to
ensure that the matter received more
careful consideration so that the final
report would strenghten the viability
of the proposal.
McCloskey supports unconditional
amnesty and abortion, while Gillmor
supports both only under certain
conditions.
Throughout the campaign,
McCloskey has expressed a desire to
return to his Palo Alto law practice,
indicating that may retire after one
more term.
Gillmor says that even if he loses,
he will probably run again in two more
years, regardless of whether or not
McCloskey retires from public life.

aimed at too many low-income people
but admits that it may spur Congress
to initiate the comprehensive tax
reform which McCloskey strongly
advocates.
Tax Credits
Gillmor claims that since the surtax
will last only for one year while Ford's
tax credits for business will continue
indefinitely, the surtax "is a sneaky
way of adding to profits."
Although McCloskey has praised
Ford's anti-trust proposals as
"superb," Gillmor says they are far
too incomplete.
Gillmor insists that oil depletion
allowances should be terminated, but
McCloskey has expressed reservations

about interfering with private
enterprise.
A unique feature of the
McCloskey-Gillmor campaign was the
agreement to limit spending to
$15,000 and refuse contributions of
more than $lOO. McCloskey waived
his franking privilege for materials that
might help his campaign.
Both candidates claimed that the
agreement gave credibility to their
calls for campaign financing reform.
But Gillmor repeatedly stated that
McCloskey's support of campaign
reform was hypocritical since he was
among the leading spenders in the
nation during earlier campaigns,
especially primary races.
McCloskey countered by noting
that his GOP primary opponents have
tended to be wealthy candidates who
insisted upon spending large sums of
money. McCloskey noted that he
limited his spending at the first
opportunity.
Ignoring Issues
Gillmor has emphasized that he
spent only $94 in his last race for
mayor, allowing McCloskey to protest
that Gillmor is ignoring important

issues.
Both candidates support the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) but
Gillmor has resurrected early
statements by McCloskey poking fun
at the women's movements.
McCloskey notes that he has not
only suppported the ERA in Congress,
but has worked to for its ratification.
Although Gillmor has attacked
McCloskey for sending the ERA back
to committee at one point, McCloskey
claims he was only attempting to
ensure that the matter received more
careful consideration so that the final
report would strenghten the viability
of the proposal.
McCloskey supports unconditional
amnesty and abortion, while Gillmor
supports both only under certain
conditions.
Throughout the campaign,
McCloskey has expressed a desire to
return to his Palo Alto law practice,
indicating that may retire after one
more term.
Gillmor says that even if he loses,
he will probably run again in two more
years, regardless of whether or not
McCloskey retires from public life.

PEOPLE'S CHOICE? Polls show Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (left), leading Democratic candidate Gary Gillmor by a 2-1
margin in the 12th Congressional District race. McCloskey chafes his opponent with bypassing the issues. Gillmor, on the
other hand, contends that McCloskey is "playing both ends against the middle."
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) seems likely to defeat
Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor
tomorrow in the 12th Congressional
District but says he's frustrated with
the intellectual quality of the
campaign. ,
McCloskey, leading by a 2-1 margin
according to most polls, contends that
Gillmor has ignored substantive issues
in the 11 debates between the
candidates.
According to McCloskey, Gillmor
has bypassed the issues to quibble
about details of campaign financing,
generalize about the need for social
reform and quote his opponent's
record out of context on subjects such
as women's rights.
Gillmor charges that McCloskey
"has been playing both ends against
the middle," bidding for liberal
support on college campuses and
wooing conservative votes in wealthy
suburbs.
Although Gillmor admits that he is
behind in the polls, he told the Daily
last week that "I still have a real
chance of winning." But McCloskey
says he is also confident of victory.
'Mistrust'
Gillmor contended that Ford's
pardon of Nixon "has created mistrust
for the Republican Party in general,"
and weakened McCloskey's contention
that Ford is an honest man.
Gillmor also insisted that
McCloskey's recent congressional
junket to London has hurt his
campaign.
"While he's in England, I'm walking
precincts, explaining my record to
people," Gillmor said. "McCloskey has
an obligation to be in the district
during the final weeks of the campaign
to discuss the issues with his
constituents."
Gillmor also complained about
McCloskey's cancellation of three
debates.
McCloskey contends that

congressional business must take
precedence over partisan campaigning,
noting that his views are well known
to 12th District voters.
Economic policies have provided a
polemical topic in most
McCloskey-Gillmor debates. Both
candidates oppose Ford's five percent
surtax on incomes, but emphasize
different points.

conditions.
Throughout the campaign,
McCloskey has expressed a desire to
return to his Palo Alto law practice,
indicating that may retire after one
more term.
Gillmor says that even if he loses,
he will probably run again in two more
years, regardless of whether or not
McCloskey retires from public life.

PEOPLE'S CHOICE? Polls show Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (left), leading Democratic candidate Gary Gillmor by a 2-1
margin in the 12th Congressional District race. McCloskey chafes his opponent with bypassing the issues. Gillmor, on the
other hand, contends that McCloskey is "playing both ends against the middle."
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) seems likely to defeat
Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor
tomorrow in the 12th Congressional
District but says he's frustrated with
the intellectual quality of the
campaign. ,
McCloskey, leading by a 2-1 margin
according to most polls, contends that
Gillmor has ignored substantive issues
in the 11 debates between the
candidates.
According to McCloskey, Gillmor
has bypassed the issues to quibble
about details of campaign financing,
generalize about the need for social
reform and quote his opponent's
record out of context on subjects such
as women's rights.
Gillmor charges that McCloskey
"has been playing both ends against
the middle," bidding for liberal
support on college campuses and
wooing conservative votes in wealthy
suburbs.
Although Gillmor admits that he is
behind in the polls, he told the Daily
last week that "I still have a real
chance of winning." But McCloskey
says he is also confident of victory.
'Mistrust'
Gillmor contended that Ford's
pardon of Nixon "has created mistrust
for the Republican Party in general,"
and weakened McCloskey's contention
that Ford is an honest man.
Gillmor also insisted that
McCloskey's recent congressional
junket to London has hurt his
campaign.
"While he's in England, I'm walking
precincts, explaining my record to
people," Gillmor said. "McCloskey has
an obligation to be in the district
during the final weeks of the campaign
to discuss the issues with his
constituents."
Gillmor also complained about
McCloskey's cancellation of three
debates.
McCloskey contends that

congressional business must take
precedence over partisan campaigning,
noting that his views are well known
to 12th District voters.
Economic policies have provided a
polemical topic in most
McCloskey-Gillmor debates. Both
candidates oppose Ford's five percent
surtax on incomes, but emphasize
different points.
McCloskey says the surtax is too
insignificant to cripple inflation, and
aimed at too many low-income people
but admits that it may spur Congress
to initiate the comprehensive tax
reform which McCloskey strongly
advocates.
Tax Credits
Gillmor claims that since the surtax
will last only for one year while Ford's
tax credits for business will continue
indefinitely, the surtax "is a sneaky
way of adding to profits."
Although McCloskey has praised
Ford's anti-trust proposals as
"superb," Gillmor says they are far
too incomplete.
Gillmor insists that oil depletion
allowances should be terminated, but
McCloskey has expressed reservations

about interfering with private
enterprise.
A unique feature of the
McCloskey-Gillmor campaign was the
agreement to limit spending to
$15,000 and refuse contributions of
more than $lOO. McCloskey waived
his franking privilege for materials that
might help his campaign.
Both candidates claimed that the
agreement gave credibility to their
calls for campaign financing reform.
But Gillmor repeatedly stated that
McCloskey's support of campaign
reform was hypocritical since he was
among the leading spenders in the
nation during earlier campaigns,
especially primary races.
McCloskey countered by noting
that his GOP primary opponents have
tended to be wealthy candidates who
insisted upon spending large sums of
money. McCloskey noted that he
limited his spending at the first
opportunity.
Ignoring Issues
Gillmor has emphasized that he
spent only $94 in his last race for
mayor, allowing McCloskey to protest
that Gillmor is ignoring important

issues.
Both candidates support the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) but
Gillmor has resurrected early
statements by McCloskey poking fun
at the women's movements.
McCloskey notes that he has not
only suppported the ERA in Congress,
but has worked to for its ratification.
Although Gillmor has attacked
McCloskey for sending the ERA back
to committee at one point, McCloskey
claims he was only attempting to
ensure that the matter received more
careful consideration so that the final
report would strenghten the viability
of the proposal.
McCloskey supports unconditional
amnesty and abortion, while Gillmor
supports both only under certain
conditions.

McCloskey has expressed a desire to
return to his Palo Alto law practice,
indicating that may retire after one
more term.

he will probably run again in two more
