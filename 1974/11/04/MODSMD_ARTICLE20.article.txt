The safety of buildings and
other structures in Nicaragua in
another devastating earthquake
like the 6.25 trembler that struck
that country a year ago is one of
the first studies being undertaken

at the newly established John A.
Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center.
Located in remodeled
Engineering Building 540, the
Center is named after a
distinguished alumnus and

internationally known structural
and earthquake engineer who
heads the firm, URS/John A.
Blume and Associates of San
Francisco.
The Center's directors, Civil
Engineering Profs. James M. Gere
and Haresh C. Shah, described the
aims of the Center and current
research projects like the risk
analysis study being financed by
the Nicaraguan government.
"Recent earthquakes in
Nicaragua, Peru and the U.S. have
shown once again that improved
methods of building design and
construction are needed if injury
ana loss of life are to be reduced
during major earthquakes," said
Gere.

"The Center will deal primarily
with the effects of earthquakes on
man-made structures and
facilities. It will serve as the focal
point for all earthquake
engineering research at Stanford,"

he added.
The Center will sponsor the
work of a number of graduate
students including some doctoral
candidates, according to Shah. At
present about 20 graduate
students are working in or with
the Center, plus about eight
faculty members who are
affiliated with it.
Testing and research can be
performed on lab models.
