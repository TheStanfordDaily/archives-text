## Cards' Rushing, Defense Top OSU 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Saturday cleared all the
obstacles away. Now all that is
left is the leap itself.
Stanford's win over Oregon
State, coupled with UCLA's loss
and USC's tie, clears up the Rose
Bowl race considerably.
Now, the statement "If
Stanford beats USC this Saturday,
it will go to the Rose Bowl," is as
valid a prediction as "Alan
Cranston will win".... Well,
considering Stanford, better make
it Jerry Brown.
The Cardinals hung on
Saturday for their third straight
win, 17-13. Stanford and USC
now sport twin Pac-8 records of
3-0-1. Thus the Cardinals are tied
for first place in the league for the
first time since Jack Christiansen
took over.
Mike Cordova had his worst
game of the year. He hit only
eight of 27 passes, and his only
TD throw was to OSU linebacker
Bob Nairne.
Two Reasons
So why did Stanford win?
Defense and rushing.

Stanford rushed for 222 yards,
the most since last year's
Washington State game.
Ron Inge (see accompanying
column) sparked the running
game with 127 yards on 20
carries.
Another reason for the rushing
improvement was Oregon State's
'so' defense, which is much like
the Cardinals'. As Stanford has
sadly learned in previous games,
the three down linemen in a 'so'
can be outgunned by a good game
plan well executed.
Stanford did both. It called a
variety of straight ahead, trap and
counter plays, with a couple
sweeps thrown in for good
measure, and blew OSU's linemen
into oblivion.
"We're getting off the ball and
attacking people," reserve center
Todd Anderson said, of the line,
which was also praised by its
demanding coach, Hudson Houck.
Meanwhile, the improvement of

Stanford's defense continued. Hie
most impressive stand of the day
came just as most of the 38,500
spectators thought Stanford
would choke.
Following an OSU field goal,
which made it 17-10, Cordova and
Inge blew a handoff on the first
play from scrimmage, at the
Cards' 17.
The Beavers quickly got a first
and goal at the four, but were
nailed on three straight rushes and
had to settle for a field goal on
the second play of the fourth
quarter.
Stanford got the ball back and
marched down the field, using
running plays. The drive stalled
when, at the OSU 16, Cordova
was outguessed by Oregon State's
pass defense and threw three
straight incompletions.
Stayed In Game
The sophomore quarterback
heard a lot of boos as he retreated
from the field, but Christiansen
stuck with hipi.

Chris agreed with the obvious
statement that Cordova had
suffered through an awful day,
but said, "Since we were ahead, I
kept him in there. With him in the
game, I always have the feeling
that the next pass he throws
might be the big one."
After that series, which will
hopefully prove the nadir of
Cordova's career, OSU took the
ball and drove to the Stanford 11,
only to have a clipping penalty
and Alvin White's errant passes
drive it back.
Stanford regained the ball after
a fake field goal, did little, and
punted. The Beavers drove
downfield once more, but lineman
Duncan McColl nailed White 13
yards back of the line of
scrimmage to effectively kill this
final drive.
The Card players agree that it'll
take a better performance than
this one to beat USC.
As Forrie Martin said, "We'll
have to play a much better game

much better by an order of
magnitude."
And a side order of luck
wouldn't hurt.

Cardinal Notes: Gordy Riegel
played another fine defensive
game, making nine unassisted
tackles, second to Geb Church's
10. Riegel was named defensive
player of the game. Riegel was
dissatisfied with his performance
as the unofficial leader of the
defense, as he lost his temper
several times . . .
Mike Langford missed 31-and
33-yard field goal attempts, but
hit a 44-yarder...
The Cardinals, more jubilant
than after their other two wins,
saluted defensive back Gerald
Wilson with a harmonious
rendition of "Happy
Birthday"...
A Stanford cheerleader was hit
in the face with a water balloon
and lost her hearing for two
hours.

WHAT, NO PENALTY? - Roger Stillwell (91) is used to being held,
but Saturday against Oregon State, the violations against him were
ridiculous. Supposedly, offensive linemen can't use their hands, much
less put a hand on an opponent's neck, as on this play. But Pacific
Eight officials, despite numerous screams from the Stanford bench,
did not call a single holding penalty Saturday.

THE BIG PLAY Duncan McColl (77) iced Stanford's win by downing OSU quarterback Alvin White 13
yards behind the line of scrimmage on this play. On the sidelines, Joe Baumgaertner (45) is the first to
react.
