## Inge--Finally On His Way 
### Tim Ferguson 
If by some quirk of fate Stanford ends up in
Pasadena on New Year's Day, someone could
chronicle the season under the title "The Return of
the Cardinals."
After Saturday's 17-13 nervewracker over
Oregon State, the sub-title of that book should read
"The Return of Ron Inge."
For on a day when Mike Cordova could barely
hit the air in front of him with a forward pass, Inge
and fellow traveler Scott Laidlaw rushed Stanford
into next week's Rose Bowl showdown with USC.
Laidlaw's story is a familiar one to Card fans:
; gutty, head-down blasts in service to an often
impotent running game. But Inge, well, he's been
inconspicuous after an auspicious freshman
campaign.
But now he's back. Though still in pain from an
injury which sidelined him during much of the
Pacific Eight season, he's back with 127 yards on
20 carries, a team high for the season.
High Praise
Highest praise for Inge came from the men who
opened the holes for him so well all afternoon.
"He's a hell of a runner," said guard Alex
Karakozoff, a fellow sophomore. "It's too bad he
gets hurt so much. He's a great guy to block for. I
just love him."
"He did a super job," added tackle Keith Rowen.
;"A lot of people don't realize that Thursday he
visited a neurosurgeon ... He didn't let it get him
down. He went out there and played one of the
greatest games by a Stanford running back ever. It's
a testimony to a great individual."
Inge returned the favor. "They [the linemen]
did a hell of a job. There were holes there all the
time. I didn't lose any yards [on any play]; that
: has to be attributed to the line."
Saturday's effort was "definitely my best game"
;at Stanford, Inge said. Best ever? Well, he gained
379 yards on 17 carries in his last game at St.

Mary's High School in Stockton, but that, he
acknowledged, was a "totally different" story.
Type Of Plays
Inge credited his performance to a different
strain of running attack developed for the Beavers:
more counters and traps, with fewer straight-ahead
or sweep plays.
"I was glad about the type of plays we ran," he
said, because the routes allowed him to "try and
use moves, some quick steps. I've never been a
power running back."
Stanford fans were glad Inge finally was able to
run those plays. A pre-season injury to a rib near
his shoulder followed by one to the shoulder itself
against UCLA, has had repercussions beyond the
physical pain.
"Mentally I've been having a lot of trouble
[thinking about the season]," Inge said. "I kept
telling myself, T'm better than this.' "
Though Saturday's performance may have
quelled his doubts, it did little for his pain. Twice
Inge was forced to leave the game, once with a leg
cramp and then when "the guy that tackled me fell
on my shoulder."
Obsession
That shoulder has become an obsession with
Inge, its pain so regular that "you anticipate it
like a reflex," he said. He visited the neurosurgeon
because "my natural instinct to protect my
shoulder was cutting off circulation in my arm."
Inge said he doesn't take pills at night to lessen
the pain. "I just sleep on my back and try not to
move."
He and his teammates may not get much sleep
this week anyway, in anticipation of the Trojan
hordes. Inge knows he won't be "100 percent" for
the game, but promised he'll be "well enough to
go."
And the timing of the titanic tilt could hardly be
better. "I don't think I've reached my peak," Inge
said Saturday. "But I'm on my way."
