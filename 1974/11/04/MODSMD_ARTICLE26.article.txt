## Bears, Huskies Score Upsets 
### 
Despite a five-game win streak
(now broken) and an overall
record of 5-2-1, it took a 15-15 tie
against USC Saturday in Los
Angeles to finally prove that
California has a damn good
football team. The Bears seemed
to know it all along, but few
others could swallow such a
radical notion.
The loss dropped USC's Pac-8
record to 3-0-1, tying Stanford for
first place and setting the
proverbial stage for Saturday's
game at Stanford Stadium.
Both teams had opportunities
to win the game in the last minute
of play but neither was successful.
The Trojans' Chris Limahelu
missed a 38-yard field goal with
54 seconds left, and Cal's Jim
Breech, a freshman, missed a try
from the same distance with 11
seconds left after Howard
Strickland had put the Bears in
position with runs of 22 and 15
plays.
According to coach John
McKay, it would have served the
Trojans right if they lost. "We
stunk," he said. "Cal did a fine
job and deserved to win. We
haven't played well in a long time.
This team is living in the past."
Cal's Steve Bartkowski, the
league's leading passer, faced the

league's best pass defense and
burned USC for 141 yards in the
air in the first half, including a
16-yard touchdown toss to Steve
Rivera.
Cal too£ a 15-7 lead in the
third period but Anthony Davis'
42-yard kickoff return set up SC's
second touchdown.
A crucial pass from Pat Haden
to tight end Jim O'Bradovich for a
two-point conversion tied the
score at 15-15.
A reincarnated Washington
Husky team upset UCLA in
Seattle 31-9, probably indicating
the elimination of the Bruins from
the Rose Bowl race. With the
absence of John Sciarra due to
injury, UCLA Coach Dick Vermeil
started 17-year-old freshman
Steve Bukich, son of former
Chicago Bear quarterback Rudy
Bukich, at quarterback in place of
Jeff Dankworth, who had hurt an
ankle in practice.
Washington took advantage of
numerous UCLA mistakes while
demonstrating a strong running
attack. Bukich was intercepted
five times with three leading to
Husky scores. Washington
compiled 314 yards on the ground
behind quarterback Denny
Fitzpatrick, fullback Robin Earl
and halfback Willie Hendricks.

UCLA has not won in Seattle
since 1958.
Washington State won its first
Pac-8 game of the season,
defeating Oregon 21-16 behind
junior quarterback Wally Bennett.
The Cougars rallied around
Bennett, a second-quarter
substitute, and scored all their 21'
points in the second half. Oregon
quarterback Norval Turner threw
touchdown passes of 22 and 40
yards to flanker Bob Palm.

injury, UCLA Coach Dick Vermeil
started 17-year-old freshman
Steve Bukich, son of former
Chicago Bear quarterback Rudy
Bukich, at quarterback in place of
Jeff Dankworth, who had hurt an
ankle in practice.
Washington took advantage of
numerous UCLA mistakes while
demonstrating a strong running
attack. Bukich was intercepted
five times with three leading to
Husky scores. Washington
compiled 314 yards on the ground
behind quarterback Denny
Fitzpatrick, fullback Robin Earl
and halfback Willie Hendricks.

UCLA has not won in Seattle
since 1958.
Washington State won its first
Pac-8 game of the season,
defeating Oregon 21-16 behind
junior quarterback Wally Bennett.
The Cougars rallied around
Bennett, a second-quarter
substitute, and scored all their 21'
points in the second half. Oregon
quarterback Norval Turner threw
touchdown passes of 22 and 40
yards to flanker Bob Palm.
Despite a five-game win streak
(now broken) and an overall
record of 5-2-1, it took a 15-15 tie
against USC Saturday in Los
Angeles to finally prove that
California has a damn good
football team. The Bears seemed
to know it all along, but few
others could swallow such a
radical notion.
The loss dropped USC's Pac-8
record to 3-0-1, tying Stanford for
first place and setting the
proverbial stage for Saturday's
game at Stanford Stadium.
Both teams had opportunities
to win the game in the last minute
of play but neither was successful.
The Trojans' Chris Limahelu
missed a 38-yard field goal with
54 seconds left, and Cal's Jim
Breech, a freshman, missed a try
from the same distance with 11
seconds left after Howard
Strickland had put the Bears in
position with runs of 22 and 15
plays.
According to coach John
McKay, it would have served the
Trojans right if they lost. "We
stunk," he said. "Cal did a fine
job and deserved to win. We
haven't played well in a long time.
This team is living in the past."
Cal's Steve Bartkowski, the
league's leading passer, faced the

league's best pass defense and
burned USC for 141 yards in the
air in the first half, including a
16-yard touchdown toss to Steve
Rivera.
Cal too£ a 15-7 lead in the
third period but Anthony Davis'
42-yard kickoff return set up SC's
second touchdown.
A crucial pass from Pat Haden
to tight end Jim O'Bradovich for a
two-point conversion tied the
score at 15-15.
A reincarnated Washington
Husky team upset UCLA in
Seattle 31-9, probably indicating
the elimination of the Bruins from
the Rose Bowl race. With the
absence of John Sciarra due to
injury, UCLA Coach Dick Vermeil
started 17-year-old freshman
Steve Bukich, son of former
Chicago Bear quarterback Rudy
Bukich, at quarterback in place of
Jeff Dankworth, who had hurt an
