# Sandoval Wins Race
## Runners Second In 'Division' 
### MIKE SHEPHERD 
The Stanford cross-country
team has almost won a lot of
meets this season, and it almost
won the Southern Division of the
Pacific Eight Saturday in Los
Angeles. But it was different this
time. The Cardinals showed signs
that they might be able to come
up with the depth they have
lacked all season.
Stanford finished second with
40 points to California's 37, while
UCLA and USC finished with 54
an<l 97 points respectively.
Tony Sandoval, Stanford's
number one runner, won the race
in 30:50.9, beating Cal's Brad
Duffey by 20 seconds. That was
really nothing different. Sandoval
has run extremely well
throughout the season in many
almost-victories.

The trouble has been that
while he, Jack Bellah and Mark
McConnell have run well, the rest
of the team has been unable to
back them up with enough points
to win the close races.
Best Race
This week, McConnell ran
probably his best race, finishing
third in 31:17. Bellah ran a good
last mile to finish sixth in 31:52.
And Art Brown came up with the
depth Stanford will need in two
weeks in the Pac-8 meet, running
a strong race to finish 13th in
32:25.
Along with Jeff Parietti who
finished 17th, Brown must
provide the strength the team
needs in the fourth and fifth
positions to have a chance against
the powerful teams of the
Northwest.

Obviously, nothing more can
be expected from Sandoval, who
ran the third fastest time ever on
the tough UCLA 6.2 mile course.
There are now two weeks left to
prepare for the Pac-B's.
The team must work hard to
develop the depth they have
missed all season, as only the top
three Pac-8 teams will qualify for
the nationals. The team title
should be a contest between
Washington State and Oregon
with the third spot pretty wide
open, only UCLA and USC being
out of it.
Home Advantage
Stanford does have an
advantage in that the race will be
run on the Stanford course. A
runner like Sandoval knows, for
example, that he can run hard up
the first hill, take the downslope
well and build up an early lead.
Also, there are places on the
course where runners loses sight
of each other for short times
around turns. With their
experience on the course, the
Stanford runners know the places
where they can accelerate for a
few seconds and if lucky,
take a quick lead.
These little advantages will not
be enough, however, if Brown,
Parietti and Frank Boutin cannot
run well and hold the lead that
Sandoval, McConnell and Bellah
build up.

third in 31:17. Bellah ran a good
last mile to finish sixth in 31:52.
And Art Brown came up with the
depth Stanford will need in two
weeks in the Pac-8 meet, running
a strong race to finish 13th in
32:25.
Along with Jeff Parietti who
finished 17th, Brown must
provide the strength the team
needs in the fourth and fifth
positions to have a chance against
the powerful teams of the
Northwest.

Obviously, nothing more can
be expected from Sandoval, who
ran the third fastest time ever on
the tough UCLA 6.2 mile course.
There are now two weeks left to
prepare for the Pac-B's.
The team must work hard to
develop the depth they have
missed all season, as only the top
three Pac-8 teams will qualify for
the nationals. The team title
should be a contest between
Washington State and Oregon
with the third spot pretty wide
open, only UCLA and USC being
out of it.
Home Advantage
Stanford does have an
advantage in that the race will be
run on the Stanford course. A
runner like Sandoval knows, for
example, that he can run hard up
the first hill, take the downslope
well and build up an early lead.
Also, there are places on the
course where runners loses sight
of each other for short times
around turns. With their
experience on the course, the
Stanford runners know the places
where they can accelerate for a
few seconds and if lucky,
take a quick lead.
These little advantages will not
be enough, however, if Brown,
Parietti and Frank Boutin cannot
run well and hold the lead that
Sandoval, McConnell and Bellah
build up.
The Stanford cross-country
team has almost won a lot of
meets this season, and it almost
won the Southern Division of the
Pacific Eight Saturday in Los
Angeles. But it was different this
time. The Cardinals showed signs
that they might be able to come
up with the depth they have
lacked all season.
Stanford finished second with
40 points to California's 37, while
UCLA and USC finished with 54
an<l 97 points respectively.
Tony Sandoval, Stanford's
number one runner, won the race
in 30:50.9, beating Cal's Brad
Duffey by 20 seconds. That was
really nothing different. Sandoval
has run extremely well
throughout the season in many
almost-victories.

The trouble has been that
while he, Jack Bellah and Mark
McConnell have run well, the rest
of the team has been unable to
back them up with enough points
to win the close races.
Best Race
This week, McConnell ran
probably his best race, finishing
third in 31:17. Bellah ran a good
last mile to finish sixth in 31:52.

depth Stanford will need in two
weeks in the Pac-8 meet, running
