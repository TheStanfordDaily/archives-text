# Booters Win Again Thanks To Offense

### DAN PYNE 
Everything went well in
Turlock Saturday, and the
Stanford soccer team extended its
winning streak to two games by
trouncing Stanislaus State 5-2.
A two game winning streak
may not sound particularly
impressive, but considering the
Cardinals' rather strange
performance to date, it's
refreshing.
"We played really very well,"
head coach Fred Priddle said,
emphasizing 'really' for the
benefit of people who are
beginning to wonder about that
comment. "Our passing was good
and crisp, and everyone was
pretty relaxed. We had a good
time." .
And they probably did. Five
goals is Stanford's largest
offensive production this season.
The Cardinals' first tally came
with seven minutes remaining in
the first period; Marty Glickfeld
passed to Jim Melamed, who gave
Stanford a 1-0 halftime lead.
In the second period, Robby
Robb made it 2-0 in the 56th
minute of play, assisted by Jim
Stokes. Rick Morrow scored four
minutes later, unassisted.
Stanislaus State got on the

scoreboard by making a penalty
shot, but the Cards came right
back with Morrow passing to
Mark Judson, who extended the
lead to 4-1. Judson was playing in
his first varsity game after missing
half the season with an injury.
Stanislaus scored again on an
unassisted break-away shot, and,
with four minutes left in the
game, Phil Wright put in
Stanford's fifth goal, also
unassisted.
The Cardinals had 25 shots on
goal and 15 fouls; Stanislaus had
11 shots on goal and 25 fouls.
Priddle commented that he was
glad someone else got all the fouls
and none of the shots for a
change. / v
Bruce Mosbacher had eight
saves in the goal for Stanford.
On Wednesday the Cardinals
play Cal State-Hayward, and
should (barring disaster) push
their winning streak to three
games.
The Cards are not
mathematically out of the
regional playoffs, yet, but the
situation is not encouraging. In
any case, Stanford will have a
chance to redeem itself in the
Pac-8 [Stanford Invitational]
tournament Nov. 15 and 16.

"We played really very well,"
head coach Fred Priddle said,
emphasizing 'really' for the
benefit of people who are
beginning to wonder about that
comment. "Our passing was good
and crisp, and everyone was
pretty relaxed. We had a good
time." .
And they probably did. Five
goals is Stanford's largest
offensive production this season.
The Cardinals' first tally came
with seven minutes remaining in
the first period; Marty Glickfeld
passed to Jim Melamed, who gave
Stanford a 1-0 halftime lead.
In the second period, Robby
Robb made it 2-0 in the 56th
minute of play, assisted by Jim
Stokes. Rick Morrow scored four
minutes later, unassisted.
Stanislaus State got on the

scoreboard by making a penalty
shot, but the Cards came right
back with Morrow passing to
Mark Judson, who extended the
lead to 4-1. Judson was playing in
his first varsity game after missing
half the season with an injury.
Stanislaus scored again on an
unassisted break-away shot, and,
with four minutes left in the
game, Phil Wright put in
Stanford's fifth goal, also
unassisted.
The Cardinals had 25 shots on
goal and 15 fouls; Stanislaus had
11 shots on goal and 25 fouls.
Priddle commented that he was
glad someone else got all the fouls
and none of the shots for a
change. / v
Bruce Mosbacher had eight
saves in the goal for Stanford.
On Wednesday the Cardinals
play Cal State-Hayward, and
should (barring disaster) push
their winning streak to three
games.
The Cards are not
mathematically out of the
regional playoffs, yet, but the
situation is not encouraging. In
any case, Stanford will have a
chance to redeem itself in the
Pac-8 [Stanford Invitational]
tournament Nov. 15 and 16.
