# Planned Library Faces Cost Cuts
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
That proposed multi-million dollar
addition to the Main Library, which
President Richard Lyman has
defended as the University's highest
priority before dissatisfied victims of
the housing crunch, will probably not
be as big as originally planned, if it cab
be built at all.
As the library's estimated
construction costs skyrocket by some
$250,000 a month and as interest rates
on borrowed money increase,
University fund-raisers are frantically
searching for the donations which
would allow them to begin the project
quickly.
The University has its hands on $5
million which probably will be
committed to the new library, noted
Ed Shaw, executive assistant to the
provost. An additional $4 million from

an anonymous grant which kicked off
the Campaign for Stanford will also go
to the library if the University can
raise the $l2 million in matching
funds as stipulated by the donor.
But even if the University goes
along with a suggestion to cut the size
of the proposed library by more than
one-third from 350,000 to 200,000
square feet the project will cost
between $2O and $3O million. That
estimate banks on the University's
ability to obtain within 15 months
enough pledges to allow it to take
construction bids from contractors,
Shaw adds.
Officials have considered building
the library in two phases one section
in the near future and one later if
not enough money is raised soon,
Shaw noted.
'Name Donors'
University fund-raisers are working
on several individual "name donors"
who might contribute a multi-million
dollar grant for the library.
And a faculty-student-admin
istration Academic Council Committee
on Libraries will consider suggestions
from Libraries Director David Weber
and the provost's office for cost-saving
reductions on the proposed building.
The library would be located in
what is now a parking lot bordered by
Meyer Library, Main Library,
Cubberley Education Building, and
Galvez Street.
It's difficult to make cuts on a
building crucial to the alleviation of an
increasingly visible book and seating
capacity shortage in Stanford libraries,
Weber says. Books, it seems, are having
as much trouble finding housing as
students.
Storage Space
Weber estimates that the Main
Library will be out of book storage
space by next autumn. The overflow,
which already fills much of the Meyer
basement, probably will be stored in
what is now the law school when that
facility is relocated in its new building.
But the new library would take
three or four years to build, and Weber
doubts that the law school could
accommodate more than four year's
worth of books at a time when the
libraries add more books each year
than Meyer Library presently holds.
