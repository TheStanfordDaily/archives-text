# Planned Library Faces Cost Cuts
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
That proposed multi-million dollar
addition to the Main Library, which
President Richard Lyman has
defended as the University's highest
priority before dissatisfied victims of
the housing crunch, will probably not
be as big as originally planned, if it cab
be built at all.
As the library's estimated
construction costs skyrocket by some
$250,000 a month and as interest rates
on borrowed money increase,
University fund-raisers are frantically
searching for the donations which
would allow them to begin the project
quickly.
The University has its hands on $5
million which probably will be
committed to the new library, noted
Ed Shaw, executive assistant to the
provost. An additional $4 million from

an anonymous grant which kicked off
the Campaign for Stanford will also go
to the library if the University can
raise the $l2 million in matching
funds as stipulated by the donor.
But even if the University goes
along with a suggestion to cut the size
of the proposed library by more than
one-third from 350,000 to 200,000
square feet the project will cost
between $2O and $3O million. That
estimate banks on the University's
ability to obtain within 15 months
enough pledges to allow it to take
construction bids from contractors,
Shaw adds.
Officials have considered building
the library in two phases one section
in the near future and one later if
not enough money is raised soon,
Shaw noted.
'Name Donors'
University fund-raisers are working
on several individual "name donors"
who might contribute a multi-million
dollar grant for the library.
And a faculty-student-admin
istration Academic Council Committee
on Libraries will consider suggestions
from Libraries Director David Weber
and the provost's office for cost-saving
reductions on the proposed building.
The library would be located in
what is now a parking lot bordered by
Meyer Library, Main Library,
Cubberley Education Building, and
Galvez Street.
It's difficult to make cuts on a
building crucial to the alleviation of an
increasingly visible book and seating
capacity shortage in Stanford libraries,
Weber says. Books, it seems, are having
as much trouble finding housing as
students.
Storage Space
Weber estimates that the Main
Library will be out of book storage
space by next autumn. The overflow,
which already fills much of the Meyer
basement, probably will be stored in
what is now the law school when that
facility is relocated in its new building.
But the new library would take
three or four years to build, and Weber
doubts that the law school could
accommodate more than four year's
worth of books at a time when the
libraries add more books each year
than Meyer Library presently holds.
Weber, who along with the Provost
has the final say on what cuts will be
made, suggests several ways of
reducing space needs in the proposed
library.
Save Space
For one, "we can better utilize the
present Main Library building by
having a portion of the administration
offices [acquisition and catalogue
departments} there" instead of in the
new building. He estimates that this
change could save some 33,000 square
feet of space.
A reduction in book capacity and
student seating, possibly by

elimination of one proposed
underground level of 180,000 square
feet, is another cost-saver, Weber
notes.
An elimination of the computer
space in the new building by using the
existing computer system in Encina
and other buildings instead of
acquiring a satellite for the library is
also a possibility.
Escalating Costs
The longer the University waits, the
more it might have to reduce the size
of the building. Shaw says he is
"concerned that the University will be
back in the same position we were six
months ago [before the proposed

cuts] of not being able to afford the
building" because of escalating costs.
Shaw notes that University officials
have considered borrowing money "to
close the last gap" if its fund-raising
efforts come close enough.
He says he is "certainly optimistic"
that the Board of Trustees would
approve the allocation of funds from
the University's operating budget to
help pay off the interest and principal
on bonds the University sells to raise
the money quickly.
Yearly Payments
But with cuts in the operating
budget likely, the University may not
be able to take enough money from
general funds' to make yearly
payments on about $ll million in
bonds to be used to finance new
facilities such as the library and the
chemistry building.
If less money is allocated from the
operating budget, fewer bonds can be
sold because the Univeristy would not
be able to spend as much to pay them
off.
Moreover, with rising interest rates,
an allocation from the operating
budget in a few years would pay off
less loans than the same amount would
today.
