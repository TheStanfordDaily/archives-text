# Hockey Team Finally Loses
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
One new thing too many
happened to the Stanford field
hockey team on Saturday.
For the first time ever, the
squad flew to an away game. And
for the first time in three seasons,
the Cardinal varsity came up on
the short end of the score, losing
to Humboldt State 3-2. The
Cards' season record is now 4-1.
Humboldt dominated the first
half, leading 2-1 at intermission.
Onnie Killefer scored the lone
first half goal for Stanford. In the
second period she tied the game
with another score. But with
about 15 minutes left to play,
Humboldt took the lead on a hard
shot and held on to win.
Mistakes plagued the Cards
throughout the game. At least
three potential goals were stopped
by offsides calls.
The Humboldt goalkeeper also
made numerous saves to thwart
Stanford.
Humboldt State, on the other
hand, was considerably more
successful when on the attack.
The Stanford fullbacks, Susy
Schatzman and Dee Gates, played
well, but when Humboldt
managed a shot on goal it often
went in.
The Cards have not seen the
last of their northern Califonia
foes. The coaches agreed Saturday
to play a rematch at Stanford on
Saturday morning, November 23.
