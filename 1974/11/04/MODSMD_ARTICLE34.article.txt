# Optimism Abounds At Cage Press Day
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
After an overwhelmingly frustrating 11-14 season, it shouldn't be
hard for a coach to refrain from superlatives. But veteran Stanford
basketball mentor Howie Dallmar had a tough time suppressing his
optimism Saturday morning as the Cards staged their annual preseason
press day at Maples Pavilion.
While players posed for publicity pictures and Rich Kelley's dog,
The Chop, scampered aimlessly across the court, Dallmar told
reporters that "everybody's playing with more confidence. I think we
have good depth at all positions and we're really pleased with the
performance of three newcomers."
Those new faces guards Jay Carter and Mike Bratz and forward
Mike Fitzner—all figure prominently in Dallmar's 1974-75 plans. In
fact Carter, a 6-foot-3 freshman from Dayton, Ohip, may provide the
outside shooting threat the Cards sorely lacked in 1973-74.
"It's funny," Dallmar said, "When we recruited him we knew he
was solid overall player but weren't quite sure about his shooting.
Now we don't have any doubts."
Met Burners
Carter isn't the only Cardinal who's been burning the nets in
practice. In a game-type scrimmage before the press day festivities,
7-foot center Rich Kelley connected on 10 of 10 field goal attempts

and a free throw, leading coach
Percy Carr's White team to a
75-62 victory over Bub Bowling's
Reds. Ed Schweitzer added 17
points and 13 rebounds for the
Whites, while Carter contributed
14 points.
Scott Trobbe paced the Reds
with 16 points, and Ben Bluitt
and Tim Patterson chipped in 12
apiece.
More importantly, the 15-man
squad displayed impressive
balance Saturday and in a similar
scrimmage last week. Trobbe
seems to have regained the
shooting form he mysteriously
misplaced last season, and six
guards (Carter, Bratz, Bluitt, Mark
Gilberg, Mike Simons and Rich
Wohlstadter) took turns tossing in
20-footers.
"There's a lot of competition
among the guards," said Dallmar,
who anticipates a more agressive,
fast break oriented team in
1974-75.
More Man-to-Man
"We'll probably play more
man-to-man defense," Dallmar

said, "and a number of times [Melvin] Arterberry could move to
forward."
The smaller, quicker lineup is designed to prevent a recurring
1973-74. problem. "Last year we were simply outquicked in a lot of
games," said Arterberry, a sure starter this season along with Kelley
and Schweitzer. "We were too dependent on the big guys, but I think
that situation will be changed this year."
Of course the big guys won't be ignored. Kelley, a two-time
All-Conference performer, had been sidelined until Friday with a sore
back, but his 10 for 10 performance Saturday made all three coaches
breathe considerably easier.
Dominant Force
And Schweitzer, who averaged 12.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a
game as a sophomore last season, has been a dominant force on the
boards in practice thus far. "If you cut open his head," Dallmar
conjectured, "I think you'd find a backboard in there."
A third important big man is Tim Patterson, one of the nation's
premier perimiter shooters.
Dallmar, however, is taking pains to avoid any lofty predictions,
especially since the Cards play nine of 11 games on the road after
their home opener against Louisiana State on Nov. 30.
"I'm optimistic," Dallmar admitted, "but so is every other Pac-8
coach I've talked to. Except for UCLA, every team has everybody
back."

NEEDED DEPTH—Art Brown who ran well Saturday, will be needed
in the upcoming Pac-8 meet to give the Cardinals the depth necessary
to qualify for the nationals. He could be the extra help badly needed
to suppliment the powerful top three.
