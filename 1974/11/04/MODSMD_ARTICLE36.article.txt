# Poloists Top SJS, Keep Hopes Alive

### BOB KUSTEL 
Stanford's water polo team,
finally putting it all together in a
sparkling display of teamwork and
aggressiveness, kept its NCAA
Championship berth hopes alive
with a 10-4 win over San Jose
State Saturday.
The impressive margin of
victory over a repected Spartan
team was bonus for the Cards,
who must be selected for the
November NCAA's as a wild card
team if -at all. (California and
UCLA, by virtue of their probable
1-2 finish in the Pac-8, will
automatically be selected.) A.
strong showing against the
formidable Spartans cannot help
but demonstrate to voting coaches
that the Cards are indeed worthy
of a berth.
The Cards plagued all year by
slow starts, used a solid defense
and goals by Dean Anderson and
Rick Johannsen to go ahead 2-1
by the end of the first stanza.
Johannsen, the star freshman,
and sophomore Drew McDonald
each scored three goals to pace
the Cards. Paul Clark, Tom Purcell
and John Goepp each added one
to round out the scoring.
The game, perhaps the most
brutal encounter of the year,
featured five Spartans fouling out,
and another two majoring out.
Stanford was able to convert
several of the resultant man-up
situations into goals.
Stanford's magnificant display
can be attributed, to a large

extent, to the size of the pool.
Earlier games, such as the loss to
UCLA last week, have been
played in the small pool of the
DeGuerre complex, while
Saturday's contest took place in
the huge 50-meter tank. Coach
Art Lambert's squad,
undoubtably one of the most
well-conditioned teams in the
country, relies on its stamina and
overall team speed to virtually
swim its opponents to death.
The small pool, because of its
restricting dimensions does not
allow Stanford to use its assets to
the extent that the large pool
does.
Until Saturday, Athletic
Director Joe Ruetz required that
the team play in the small pool
because the grandstand location
enables Stanford to collect some
added revenues from the gate
receipts.
The difference was obvious
Saturday, as a tired Spartan team
simply could not contain the
Cards in the big pool.
Next weekend again finds
Stanford with its back to the wall
as the Cards travel to Davis to
take on the Aggies on Friday and
entertain the hungry USC Trojans
on Saturday morning.
The Trojans, though one of the
stronger teams in the country, are
thus far winless in the Pac-8 play,
and coupled with the fact that
they are angry at being dumped
by the Cards twice this year,
should be especially tough.
