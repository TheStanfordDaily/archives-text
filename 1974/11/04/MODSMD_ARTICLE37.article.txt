Voters Expected To Elect Democrats
WASHINGTON Voters in 34 states elect senators tomorrow and the result
is expected to be a younger, more liberal and more heavily Democratic Senate..
Twenty of the seats at stake are held by Democrats. Surveys indicate 14 of
the Democratic candidates are safe bets for election and another 11 are leading.
Thus, the party that now holds 58 of the 100 seats could end up with 63, the
most since the 1966 election.
Regardless of what happens tomorrow the Senate that convenes in January
will be one of the youngest in years because six of the 18 senior members, with a
combined tenure of 148 years, are retiring.
Two other veterans Sen. Milton Young (R-N.D.) with 30 years of service,
and Sen. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.) with 18 years are facing serious challenges.
Eleven of these seats up for grabs are held by conservatives, surveys indicate
only four of those states are good bets to send conservatives back to the Senate.
Coal Industry Labor Negotiations Break Off
WASHINGTON Coal industry labor negotiations broke off temporarily
yesterday and United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller said it was doubtful
a strike could be avoided next week.
However, Miller said there was still a slim possibility of reaching an agreement
that could be ratified in time to prevent a walkout.
Both sides were expected to meet for talks today.
Miller said he was sending his 38-member bargaining council home because
the industry failed to respond to the union's wage and benefit demands.
"The onus is on the operators," he told newsmen. "The next 24 to 48 hours
are rather critical."
Miller led his bargaining team from the negotiations and said another meeting
had not been scheduled with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
AFL-CIO Tops List Of Political Spenders
WASHINGTON The AFL-CIO political arm spent $297,861 in 10 days to
help labor-approved candidates in tomorrow's elections, topping a list of
last-minute spending by special interest groups.
A check of reports on file with the government shows the giant labor group's
political spending in the most recent reporting period, from Oct. 15 to Oct. 24
inclusive, far outpaced that of other rich lobbies, including the American
Medical Association, dairy cooperatives and big individual unions such as the
United Auto Workers and Steelworkers.
Nixon Improves, Off Critical List
LONG BEACH, Calif., Former President Richard M. Nixon was taken off
the critical list yesterday for the first time in six days. He continued to show
increased strength since a brush with death brought on by post-operative
complications.
"It's his best morning since hospitalization began," Nixon's physician, Dr.
John C. Lungren, said in his daily medical bulletin.
Lungren said through hospital spokesman Norman Nager that the 61-year-old
former chief executive also began a soft food diet.
Nixon entered the hospital for treatment of phlebitis Oct. 23.
He had been fed intravenously during the critical period, until Saturday when
he was first allowed to take consomme and gelatin.
Lungren said Nixon was now in "sub-intensive care," which he described as
"a step down from critical care." The next less serious condition would be
"intermediate care" but there was no indication when Nixon might be put in
that category.
Nixon slept at intervals Saturday night, Lungren said. He described his
patient's vital signs as normal.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but patchy morning fog. Little temperature change.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in mid 60s to mid 70s.
Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.

most since the 1966 election.
Regardless of what happens tomorrow the Senate that convenes in January
will be one of the youngest in years because six of the 18 senior members, with a
combined tenure of 148 years, are retiring.
Two other veterans Sen. Milton Young (R-N.D.) with 30 years of service,
and Sen. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.) with 18 years are facing serious challenges.
Eleven of these seats up for grabs are held by conservatives, surveys indicate
only four of those states are good bets to send conservatives back to the Senate.
Coal Industry Labor Negotiations Break Off
WASHINGTON Coal industry labor negotiations broke off temporarily
yesterday and United Mine Workers President Arnold Miller said it was doubtful
a strike could be avoided next week.
However, Miller said there was still a slim possibility of reaching an agreement
that could be ratified in time to prevent a walkout.
Both sides were expected to meet for talks today.
Miller said he was sending his 38-member bargaining council home because
the industry failed to respond to the union's wage and benefit demands.
"The onus is on the operators," he told newsmen. "The next 24 to 48 hours
are rather critical."
Miller led his bargaining team from the negotiations and said another meeting
had not been scheduled with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
AFL-CIO Tops List Of Political Spenders
WASHINGTON The AFL-CIO political arm spent $297,861 in 10 days to
help labor-approved candidates in tomorrow's elections, topping a list of
last-minute spending by special interest groups.
A check of reports on file with the government shows the giant labor group's
political spending in the most recent reporting period, from Oct. 15 to Oct. 24
inclusive, far outpaced that of other rich lobbies, including the American
Medical Association, dairy cooperatives and big individual unions such as the
United Auto Workers and Steelworkers.
Nixon Improves, Off Critical List
LONG BEACH, Calif., Former President Richard M. Nixon was taken off
the critical list yesterday for the first time in six days. He continued to show
increased strength since a brush with death brought on by post-operative
complications.
"It's his best morning since hospitalization began," Nixon's physician, Dr.
John C. Lungren, said in his daily medical bulletin.
Lungren said through hospital spokesman Norman Nager that the 61-year-old
former chief executive also began a soft food diet.
Nixon entered the hospital for treatment of phlebitis Oct. 23.
He had been fed intravenously during the critical period, until Saturday when
he was first allowed to take consomme and gelatin.
Lungren said Nixon was now in "sub-intensive care," which he described as
"a step down from critical care." The next less serious condition would be
"intermediate care" but there was no indication when Nixon might be put in
that category.
Nixon slept at intervals Saturday night, Lungren said. He described his
patient's vital signs as normal.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but patchy morning fog. Little temperature change.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in mid 60s to mid 70s.
Variable wind 5 to 15 mph.
Voters Expected To Elect Democrats
WASHINGTON Voters in 34 states elect senators tomorrow and the result
is expected to be a younger, more liberal and more heavily Democratic Senate..
Twenty of the seats at stake are held by Democrats. Surveys indicate 14 of
the Democratic candidates are safe bets for election and another 11 are leading.
Thus, the party that now holds 58 of the 100 seats could end up with 63, the
most since the 1966 election.
