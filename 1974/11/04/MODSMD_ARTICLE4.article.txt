# Visitors To China Note Emphasis On Technical Self-Sufficiency

"I got the impression that the [Chinese] people were
very proud of their society; they worked hard for the
purpose of bettering it," Engineering Prof. Yufen Ron Shen
of UC-Berkeley said Friday.
Shen and Chang-Lin Tien, also an engineering professor
at Cal, presented a joint lecture in Jordan Hall on their
trips to the Peoples' Republic of China. The
professors travelled separately to China to tour research and
educational institutions.
Both speakers stressed the position of research in
contemporary Chinese science. Under government
supervision, the practical application of science takes
precedence over pure theory, they noted.
"They [government officials] turn away from basic
Science to specific problems, and because of this
philosophy, physics, mathematics and other pure sciences
have suffered quite a lot," said Shen.
Emphasis on the applied sciences is largely a result of the
cultural revolution, he stated.
Soviet Influence
Before the cultural revolution, research in China was
â€¢influenced greatly by the Soviets and was a continuation of
Soviet and European research. Since the revolution,
government policy has redirected all research toward
solving specific problems in Chinese society.
Modern research is conducted chiefly by technical
institutes. Shen and Tien both visited some of these
institutes and observed that the research level is quite high.
"fTien noted, however, that for a number of reasons, "they
[the Chinese scientific community] are always three or
-our years behind the Western nations."
China's chief difficulty is communication, because the

scientific community does not have the advantage of
directly exchanging ideas and discoveries with other
nations. Their only link to Western technology is through
foreign journals, leaving them a few years behind on new
scientific developments in the rest of the world.
Self-Reliance
Realizing the disadvantages of relying upon the
technological assistance of another country, the Chinese are
striving for technical self-reliance. One result of this, Shen
observed, is that "99 percent of all equipment is made in
China." Even university students build most/ of the
instruments that they use.
An abundance of available manpower eases China's
difficulties, however. "For this reason, they put more than
one person on each project at the same time," Shen pointed
out.
Curriculum
Shen and Tien noted that the Chinese education system
is quite different from that of the United States, although
curriculum does not differ a great deal.
After secondary school, all Chinese students have two to
three years of practical work in a commune or a factory, to
keep in touch with the people. "If they work very hard and
follow Mao's thoughts, they can be recommended by the
group to the University," Shen said.
Although students receive no formal grades, Shen found
students "extremely motivated." Non-achievement is
discouraged by making the poorer students feel a sense of
shame.
A unique element of the Chinese system is the
professor-student relationship. Tien stated that each week
students and professors engage in a weekly session of
mutual criticism in which both sides openly express
opinions of the other's performance.
