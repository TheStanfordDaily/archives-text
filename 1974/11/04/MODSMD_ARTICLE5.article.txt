# Voters To Decide On 17 State Propositions
## 
### DON COX 
California voters going to the polls
tomorrow will once again face a
battery of 17 state propositions but
less than half of them have generated
any substantial controversy.
The propositions range from
procedural measures designed to clean
up the lengthy state constitution to
more controversial moves affecting the
state education system, local
governments and the environment.
Many of them have gone unnoticed
while others have been the object of
well-organized and well-financed
campaigns.

In the latter category is Proposition
17, a move to halt construction of a
$270 million dam on the Stanislaus
River. Friends and foes of the
proposition have spent a
combined total of over $350,000 to
publicize their views, with opponents
of the proposition outspending the
other side by $30,000.
Friends of the River and other
anti-dam factions have defended their
position largely on aesthetic grounds,
arguing against "pouring 62 stories of
rock and concrete in the middle of the
most popular Whitewater recreation
river west of the Mississippi."

But they have also assembled a
comprehensive case against the dam
project on strictly economic grounds,
claiming that the dam is simply not
worth the money being spent to
construct it.
Many of the projected benefits are
badly over-estimated, or can never be
realized, they argue. A smaller dam
would provide the necessary flood
control, Irrigation, and water quality
control without inundating the river.
Anti-Proposition 17 forces have
campaigned that the river is used by
only a handful of raft enthusiasts and
that the large recreation lake created

by the dam would serve the interests
of more people.
The dam would be the most
effective form of flood control and
provide badly needed irrigation water
and improved fishing, they say. The
major contributors to the campaign
were two dozen contractors, with the
largest sums coming from firms
engaged in building the dam.
Many of the other controversial
propositions deal with facets of
education in the state.
Proposition 4
Proposition 4 would add one
student and one faculty member to
the UC Board of Regents and require
that appointments reflect economic,
cultural and social diversity.
Proposition 4 would also shorten
regent's terms from 16 to 12 years and
add two members appointed by the
governor with state Senate approval.
Proponents argue that the present
method of selection of board members
does not assure diversity and that with
these changes the board will be more
representative and more responsive to
the public.
Having a student and faculty
member on the board would be
dangerous, suggest opponents of
Proposition 4. They would have a lack
of expertise in decisions and student
and faculty interests can be adequately
represented by the board as it stands
now, opponents say.
Tuition Power
The regents' power to determine the
amount of tuition charged to UC
students would be transferred to the
legislature if Proposition 16 passes.
Those in favor of the proposition
argue that matters of public policy and
taxation should be put in the hands of
the peoples' elected representatives.
They also point out that the legislature
already controls tuition for the state
college and state university system and
for community colleges.
Unnecessary and dangerous political
influence might be injected into the
Board of Regents if the power transfer
occurs, say opponents.
Political Influence
In fact, the opposition to a number
of the propositions decry the
introduction of political influence
they claim would occur if those
propositions pass.
Opposition to Proposition 14 uses
this argument in campaigning against
the addition of the president pro
tempore of the state system to the
State University Board of Trustees.
Pro-Proposition 14 forces counter
this charge with the contention that a
more balanced representation of the
legislature would be achieved if the
measure is passed. The speaker of the
Assembly is already on the board, as
are the governor and the lieutenant
governor. A balance between the
legislative and executive branches is
also needed, they say.
'Political Appointees'
Anti-Proposition 3 groups also use
the political influence argument in
their attacks. By exempting four
members of the Postsecondary
Education Commission from the civil
service system, they are/ turned into
"political appointees," they charge.
The commission will have greater
flexibility in improving statewide
education planning and coordination

and be able to recruit the most
qualified personnel to do the job, say
the Proposition 3 advocates, including
University President Richard Lyman.
The ability to recruit the best
qualified employees is also at issue in
the tussle over Proposition 5.
Proponents argue that by prohibiting
charter cities and counties from
requiring their employees to live
within their boundaries top-grade
personnel will never be a problem.
Special Class
Opponents claim that approval of
the measure might lead to the creation
of a special class of public employees,
willing to accept the benefits of public
employment, but unwilling to share
the responsibilities borne by the
residents who employ them. By
rejecting the proposition, the choice to
establish any residence requirement
will be left to the locality to decide.
The principle of local control would
be repealed also if Proposition 15 is
allowed to pass, opponents argue. The
repeal of the state requirement that
development of low rent housing
projects be approved by a vote of the
people, would take away the right to

approve such projects, they argue.
Proponents say that local
governments would still be able to
vote on the use of local funds for such
projects and that the proposition only
changes the mandatory requirement
for the voters' approval, a costly and
expensive procedure.
Most of the other propositions have
generated little debate.
Proposition 11, changing masculine
terms in the state constitution to
neuter gender has been attacked as
being frivolous. Proposition 13,
granting San Diego County special
constitutional authorization to set up
a new judicial district, has been
attacked on the grounds that
provisions for such authorization
should be given in away so that any
county is eligible not just San Diego.
Propositions 2, 7, 8, 9 and 12 all
clean up inequities or outdated
provisions in the state constitution,
supporters note. Proposition 1 floats a
bond issue for funds to repair and
build schools to meet earthquake
standards. Proposition 10 restores the
vote to ex-felons who have completed
their sentence and probation.
