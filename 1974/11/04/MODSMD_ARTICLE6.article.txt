## editorial Vote Tomorrow 
### 
Tomorrow is election day.
The Daily urges you to exercise your right and duty by
voting for the candidates of your choice.
In the past two decades, well under 50 percent of
America's eligible voters have chosen to vote in so-called
"off-year" elections. Public opinion surveys indicate that the
trend will continue this year.
And indeed, with public distrust of politicians and the
political process at such a high level, an argument might be
made for staying home.
On the other hand, if you don't vote, you can't complain.
A list of polling places on and around the campus will be
found in tomorrow's Daily.
