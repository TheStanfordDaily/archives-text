# Student Fee Levy Sought By 'Live Oak'
## 
### DON COX 
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein
confirmed yesterday that he is
currently distributing petitions to
place a $1 fee assessment for his
publication on the Nov. 20 ASSU
election ballot.
Weinstein said he is seeking the
assessment "to allow us not to be
totally dependent on ad revenue" and
to permit expansion of the weekly
paper. " Live Oak can operate
indefinitely with the ad revenue it has
now, but we need the money so we
can turn out a better paper," he said.
Weinstein's proposal drew
immediate criticism from ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri and
ASSU President Mike Herman.
"I'm going to be moving solidly
against that fee assessment," said
Olivieri. "My feeling behind this is that
I really question the need for $11,500
of the students' money to keep Live
Oak going when right now he's doing
very, very well almost breaking
even," he said.
Herman Agrees
"I don't think it's very necessary,"
agreed Herman. "He has re serve s-of
$5OO-$6OO, he is a reasonably good
business manager and what with his
profits, he doesn't really need
$11,000," he said.
Weinstein said the money is needed
to pay for initial equipment and
start-up costs and to allow expansion
from the present 12-page paper to a
16- or 20-page paper.
"It will solve our cash flow problem
and once and for all establish Live Oak
as a financial entity. The paper will
definitely improve," since in the past a
problem was that Live Oak had too
many ads in proportion to editorial
copy, Weinstein said.
He also noted that the money will
be spent over the next year and a half
and "not in one lump sum."
Mayer Supports

ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
supports the fee assessment and helped
circulate the petitions during the last
few days.
"Live Oak is one publication that
has put forth the effort to make it
deserving of that kind of support from
the community," he said. But, he
added, "come Nov. 21, I may be
completely opposed to the fee
assessment if I am satisfied that they
don't need the money.
"I am not appraised of the financial
status of Live Oak, but, frankly, I am
willing to pay a dollar for Live Oak's
continued survival," Mayer said.
Weinstein said at the last meeting of
the ASSU Publications Board that he
was seeking funding from the Pub
Board. Weinstein also sought $l5OO
from the Pub Board last year. He has
also obtained two loans of $5OO each
