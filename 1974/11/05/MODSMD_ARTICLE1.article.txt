# Student Fee Levy Sought By 'Live Oak'
## 
### DON COX 
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein
confirmed yesterday that he is
currently distributing petitions to
place a $1 fee assessment for his
publication on the Nov. 20 ASSU
election ballot.
Weinstein said he is seeking the
assessment "to allow us not to be
totally dependent on ad revenue" and
to permit expansion of the weekly
paper. " Live Oak can operate
indefinitely with the ad revenue it has
now, but we need the money so we
can turn out a better paper," he said.
Weinstein's proposal drew
immediate criticism from ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri and
ASSU President Mike Herman.
"I'm going to be moving solidly
against that fee assessment," said
Olivieri. "My feeling behind this is that
I really question the need for $11,500
of the students' money to keep Live
Oak going when right now he's doing
very, very well almost breaking
even," he said.
Herman Agrees
"I don't think it's very necessary,"
agreed Herman. "He has re serve s-of
$5OO-$6OO, he is a reasonably good
business manager and what with his
profits, he doesn't really need
$11,000," he said.
Weinstein said the money is needed
to pay for initial equipment and
start-up costs and to allow expansion
from the present 12-page paper to a
16- or 20-page paper.
"It will solve our cash flow problem
and once and for all establish Live Oak
as a financial entity. The paper will
definitely improve," since in the past a
problem was that Live Oak had too
many ads in proportion to editorial
copy, Weinstein said.
He also noted that the money will
be spent over the next year and a half
and "not in one lump sum."
Mayer Supports

ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
supports the fee assessment and helped
circulate the petitions during the last
few days.
"Live Oak is one publication that
has put forth the effort to make it
deserving of that kind of support from
the community," he said. But, he
added, "come Nov. 21, I may be
completely opposed to the fee
assessment if I am satisfied that they
don't need the money.
"I am not appraised of the financial
status of Live Oak, but, frankly, I am
willing to pay a dollar for Live Oak's
continued survival," Mayer said.
Weinstein said at the last meeting of
the ASSU Publications Board that he
was seeking funding from the Pub
Board. Weinstein also sought $l5OO
from the Pub Board last year. He has
also obtained two loans of $5OO each
from the Dean of Student Affairs
office.
"We never really needed the second
$500," Weinstein said yesterday.
"We've always been financially
viable." He said he had not yet
decided whether to continue to try to
obtain funding from the Pub Board.
Option Open?
Olivieri said that he "guessed"
Weinstein was leaving the Pub Board
funding option open in case the fee
assessment is voted down.
Weinstein denied Olivieri's
speculation and expressed confidence
that the fee assessment would easily
pass. "We've had no difficulty
collecting signatures" on the petitions,
he said.
Herman said that the fee assessment
should only be used as a last resort for
funding. "Rather than going to the
students, he should go through the
Dean of Student Affairs office and the
Pub Board first, and [given the

financial state of the paper], I really
question even going to them," Herman
said.
"A fee assessment is costly and
takes in a lot of students who really
aren't interested in Live Oak," he
added.
Track Record
Olivieri said it might be a little early
to go for a fee assessment in any event
since the Live Oak has only published
a half dozen times and does not have
much of a track record.
Weinstein said that "it was not too
early" and that any student had the
right to go for a fee assessment if he
had the number of signatures on the
petitions required.
Olivieri noted that he was not only
opposed to the Live Oak fee
assessment but also another fee
assessment on the ballot for the
proposed record co-op.
Presently, no campus publications
are receiving funds from student fee
assessments.
