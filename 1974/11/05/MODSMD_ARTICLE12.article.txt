# Is Equality A Prelude To Tyranny?
## 
### Bill Evers 
In re-reading Plato's Republic recently I
was struck by the persistence of an
egalitarian political argument found there:
then and now, some political thinkers argue
that services like medical work, legal work
and teaching should as a political matter be
practiced to meet cases of ill health, legal
problems and lack of knowledge or training.
Plato's formula is that medical
practitioners should serve the proper aim of
their profession healing the sick.
In our time, egalitarians like Bernard
Williams and Michael Walzer say that the
proper ground of distribution of medical care
is ill health. Walzer maintains that medicine,
law, and education are fields in which it is
proper that the formula, "From each
according to his abilities, to each according
to his needs," be applied.
Internal Goal
Although at first glance the argument of
Plato, Williams, and Walzer that the "internal
goal" of activities (e.g., health care for the
sick) should be fulfilled seems reasonable,
upon closer examination it proves flawed.
Now if the right to medical treatment
position, for example, is spun out to its
logical conclusions, we would expect
situations in which the taxpayers are taxed to
near starvation in order to pay for fancy
medical equipment that keeps a few people
alive in a vegetable state.
But since this scenario would be

politically unacceptable, we instead would
have to expect governmental setting of
priorities in health care. Suddenly, the
beautiful vision of health care according to
need has been replaced by the somewhat less
glorious prospect of health care based on
political considerations. There should be
interesting problems over rights of those
needing new body organs to transplantable
organs in others.
Plato holds up as a model a doctor who
decided whether to cure a patient or allow
the patient to die on the basis of the patient's
probable usefulness to the state.
Involuntary Care
Furthermore, as Plato points out in the
Statesman , there is both voluntary and
involuntary medical care. We have in the
history of medical care in the United States a
case of the right to health leading to the right
of the government to imprison noncriminals
whom it adjudges to be mentally ill. The
political possibilities of this practice can be
seen most vividly in the Soviet Union. Yet
what else can one expect in a situation in
which the government is designating needs?
Arguments calling for reordering and
regulating activities so that the internal
goals of professions are fulfilled have these
unexpected and unpleasant consequences.
But the whole idea of allocating resources to
fulfill the internal goals of professions is an
indefensible policy.

Why should barbering services be allocated
to serve the need of long hair? As Robert
Nozick points out in his new book, Anarchy,
State and Utopia, a barber might enjoy
barbering for the conversations with
customers. Why shouldn't- he allocate his
services to interesting conversationalists? If a
barber is working to put himself through
college, why not prefer customers who tip
well or pay well? Should a gardener allocate
his services to those lawns that need him
most?
Old Claim
Williams and Walzer, it turns out, have
dressed up in fine clothes an old claim that
the government should provide for the
important needs of all of its citizens. But
they have not provided a philosophically
defensible argument for the claim.
The William-Walzer position, as Nozick
notes, focuses ahistorically on distribution. It
"ignores the question of where the things or
actions to be allocated and distributed come
from. Consequently, [it] does not consider
whether they come already tied to people
who have entitlements over them (surely the
case for service activities, which are people's
actions), people who therefore may decide for
themselves to whom they will give the thing
and on what grounds."
