On Marine Protest
Editor:
The recent article (Daily, Oct.
31) on the demonstration
protesting marine recruitment on
campus is representative of the
degree to which Daily news
coverage has deteriorated in past
years.
Since when does coverage of a
demonstration completely leave
out any mention of why the
protest took place? The
anti-imperialist analysis and
content of the rally was not even
mentioned, much less discussed.
Far from being a baseless and
narrow anti-militarist outburst
(which is what the Daily article
implied), the rally was an attempt
to focus attention upon and
protest U.S. imperialism.
The content of the rally, as
shown in the speeches, included
an examination of three
interacting components of U.S.
imperialism:
—the monopoly and oligopoloy
corporations whose drive for
raw materials, markets and profits
is the fundamental cause of U.S.
economic and political
domination of Third World
Countries.

—the military which has
been used as a last resort against
national liberation struggles, such
as that of the Vietnamese who
aim to put an end to U.S.
economic and political
domination.
—in the background, the
universities which through
various kinds of research and
development and in more subtle
ideological ways have participated
and do participate in U.S.
imperialism.
The speakers discussed specific
examples of these three
components: Standard Oil, the
Marines and Stanford. The last
speaker examined a particular
victim of American imperialism,
Puerto Rico.
By not mentioning the
speeches and their content, the
Daily abdicated its responsibility
to provide an accurate account of
events on campus and thus failed
to facilitate the exchange of ideas
within the academic community.

I notice in the flyer handed out

by the newly formed "Alliance
for Radical Change" that the
group is against monopolies,
"with their highly concentrated
economic power," and also
against competition and
competitiveness.
Now, really, one can't be both.
Either one favors a free market
which allows individuals to make
their own choices, thus fostering
competition and rewarding
competitiveness, or one favors
monopoly control of the market
wherein unions, corporations or
(most likely) government
bureaucrats control things.
I am sure that it is considered
progressive at Columbae to be
against a lot of things, but
consistent individuals will have to
choose between monopolies and
competition.

I would like to comment on
Irwin Remson's letter concerning
"Athletic Differences" between
Stanford and other Pac-8 schools.
I agree with Remson that
Stanford is to be commended for
its fine athletic programs for men,
but before Stanford receives this
pat on the back for external
appearances, an internal
examination is needed. What has
the University done for the other
40 percent of the undergraduate
student body the women
students? Remson makes the
point that at other universities the
80 men who play JV-Frosh
football "would be relegated to
the role of spectators" while at
Stanford they can compete.
I'd like to point out (using
1973-74 figures) that all but the
150 women who participate in
intercollegiate athletics and the
260 that participated in the
intramural and club sport
programs are "relegated to the
role of spectators." This must be
rectified.
Stanford presently has 12 or
13 men's intercollegiate teams
(750 men) while it only has five
for women (fencing is a club
sport). Intramural and club sport
participation is just as
discouraging with 8000 men
participating. This figure includes
men competing in multiple sports,,
so the real figure is less than 8000
and only 260 women. WRM

figures were not available.
Surely this is not all the fault
of Stanford and much is to be
blamed on our society for
discouraging females from being
active participants in athletics.
Administrators in the University
are seriously working on the
inequities in intercollegiate
athletics and intramurals but that
doesn't take away from the fact of
what has been and what presently
exists.
An athletic career once lost is
something that can never be
recovered. In this area Stanford
has not had "the interests and
welfare of [all] students as first
priority."
Stanford should be applauded
for its fine men's programs, but
the lack of equal first rate athletic
opportunity for women has been
appalling and the students and
alumni should be made aware of
this too.

ACT Misuridarstood
Editor:
In the review of ACT'S
production of Richard 111 (Daily,
Oct. 25) reviewer David Moyer
has shown a remarkable
misunderstanding of what ACT
has tried to contribute to theater.
ACT's intent is to entertain
creatively, to lead the audience
through innovative interpretations
to new levels of artistic awareness.
I think another hackneyed "mirror
to nature" production of Richard
111 would have made even
Shakespeare gag.
Furthermore, the reviewer
failed to mention, perhaps because
it would have dealt a major blow
to the foundation of his criticism,
the inspiration that William Ball
drew from the Tolkien trilogy and
Kabuki theatre.
Anyone who has imagined an
"ork" would be impressed rather
than put off by the darkly
imaginative costumes of Robert
Fletcher. And perhaps a critic less
rusted in Western culture would
be more appreciative of the
striking touches derived from
Kabuki.
One last word: I agree that one
hardly "cheers" for right (white)
in the end. It is possible, however,
that this was Ball's intent. The
mood and rhythm of the play are
dark, evoking the darker impulses

from the individuals in the
audience.
Isn't it a final tribute to the
superb talent of director Ball and
actor Duk Kim that even through
the "morass of melodrama" one
continues to sympathize, darkly,
with the enigmatic Richard?

Managerial Misfits
Editor:
It appears as though Larry
Horton's managerial misfits have
done it again.
Last spring it was decided that
the house dues in any house with
freshmen, both four class and all
freshmen, will be $lO, an increase
of $2 over the past year. Yet the
PTR's of freshmen only showed a
charge of $B, while those of
upperclassmen had the correct
amount of $lO.
This oversight has caused havoc
with the accounting procedures
between four class houses, the
ASSU and the students involved.
In a letter to house staff members,
the Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs proposes a complicated
method by which the additional
$2 can be added to freshmen
room rents on the Winter PTRs.
By their own admission this is
just a Catch 22 process to solve
the problem.
If the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs cannot implement
its policies and programs
successfully without the ever
present bureaucratic tie-ups,
perhaps its power to establish
such policies should be
reexamined.

I notice in the flyer handed out

by the newly formed "Alliance
for Radical Change" that the
group is against monopolies,
"with their highly concentrated
economic power," and also
against competition and
competitiveness.
Now, really, one can't be both.
Either one favors a free market
which allows individuals to make
their own choices, thus fostering
competition and rewarding
competitiveness, or one favors
monopoly control of the market
wherein unions, corporations or
(most likely) government
bureaucrats control things.
I am sure that it is considered
progressive at Columbae to be
against a lot of things, but
consistent individuals will have to
choose between monopolies and
competition.

I would like to comment on
Irwin Remson's letter concerning
"Athletic Differences" between
Stanford and other Pac-8 schools.
I agree with Remson that
Stanford is to be commended for
its fine athletic programs for men,
but before Stanford receives this
pat on the back for external
appearances, an internal
examination is needed. What has
the University done for the other
40 percent of the undergraduate
student body the women
students? Remson makes the
point that at other universities the
80 men who play JV-Frosh
football "would be relegated to
the role of spectators" while at
Stanford they can compete.
I'd like to point out (using
1973-74 figures) that all but the
150 women who participate in
intercollegiate athletics and the
260 that participated in the
intramural and club sport
programs are "relegated to the
role of spectators." This must be
rectified.
Stanford presently has 12 or
13 men's intercollegiate teams
(750 men) while it only has five
for women (fencing is a club
sport). Intramural and club sport
participation is just as
discouraging with 8000 men
participating. This figure includes
men competing in multiple sports,,
so the real figure is less than 8000
and only 260 women. WRM

figures were not available.
Surely this is not all the fault
of Stanford and much is to be
blamed on our society for
discouraging females from being
active participants in athletics.
Administrators in the University
are seriously working on the
inequities in intercollegiate
athletics and intramurals but that
doesn't take away from the fact of
what has been and what presently
exists.
An athletic career once lost is
something that can never be
recovered. In this area Stanford
has not had "the interests and
welfare of [all] students as first
priority."
Stanford should be applauded
for its fine men's programs, but
the lack of equal first rate athletic
opportunity for women has been
appalling and the students and
alumni should be made aware of
this too.

ACT Misuridarstood
Editor:
In the review of ACT'S
production of Richard 111 (Daily,
Oct. 25) reviewer David Moyer
has shown a remarkable
misunderstanding of what ACT
has tried to contribute to theater.
ACT's intent is to entertain
creatively, to lead the audience
through innovative interpretations
to new levels of artistic awareness.
I think another hackneyed "mirror
to nature" production of Richard
111 would have made even
Shakespeare gag.
Furthermore, the reviewer
failed to mention, perhaps because
it would have dealt a major blow
to the foundation of his criticism,
the inspiration that William Ball
drew from the Tolkien trilogy and
Kabuki theatre.
Anyone who has imagined an
"ork" would be impressed rather
than put off by the darkly
imaginative costumes of Robert
Fletcher. And perhaps a critic less
rusted in Western culture would
be more appreciative of the
striking touches derived from
Kabuki.
One last word: I agree that one
hardly "cheers" for right (white)
in the end. It is possible, however,
that this was Ball's intent. The
mood and rhythm of the play are
dark, evoking the darker impulses

from the individuals in the
audience.
Isn't it a final tribute to the
superb talent of director Ball and
actor Duk Kim that even through
the "morass of melodrama" one
continues to sympathize, darkly,
with the enigmatic Richard?

Managerial Misfits
Editor:
It appears as though Larry
Horton's managerial misfits have
done it again.
Last spring it was decided that
the house dues in any house with
freshmen, both four class and all
freshmen, will be $lO, an increase
of $2 over the past year. Yet the
PTR's of freshmen only showed a
charge of $B, while those of
upperclassmen had the correct
amount of $lO.
This oversight has caused havoc
with the accounting procedures
between four class houses, the
ASSU and the students involved.
In a letter to house staff members,
the Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs proposes a complicated
method by which the additional
$2 can be added to freshmen
room rents on the Winter PTRs.
By their own admission this is
just a Catch 22 process to solve
the problem.
If the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs cannot implement
its policies and programs
successfully without the ever
present bureaucratic tie-ups,
perhaps its power to establish
such policies should be
reexamined.

The recent article (Daily, Oct.

Since when does coverage of a
demonstration completely leave
out any mention of why the
protest took place? The
anti-imperialist analysis and
content of the rally was not even
mentioned, much less discussed.
Far from being a baseless and
narrow anti-militarist outburst
(which is what the Daily article
implied), the rally was an attempt
to focus attention upon and
protest U.S. imperialism.
The content of the rally, as
shown in the speeches, included
an examination of three
interacting components of U.S.
imperialism:
—the monopoly and oligopoloy
corporations whose drive for
raw materials, markets and profits
is the fundamental cause of U.S.
economic and political
domination of Third World

Either one favors a free market
which allows individuals to make

competition and rewarding
competitiveness, or one favors
monopoly control of the market

I would like to comment on
Irwin Remson's letter concerning
"Athletic Differences" between
Stanford and other Pac-8 schools.
I agree with Remson that
Stanford is to be commended for
its fine athletic programs for men,
but before Stanford receives this
pat on the back for external
appearances, an internal
examination is needed. What has
the University done for the other
40 percent of the undergraduate
student body the women
students? Remson makes the
point that at other universities the
80 men who play JV-Frosh
football "would be relegated to
the role of spectators" while at
Stanford they can compete.
I'd like to point out (using
1973-74 figures) that all but the
150 women who participate in
intercollegiate athletics and the
260 that participated in the
intramural and club sport
programs are "relegated to the
role of spectators." This must be
rectified.
Stanford presently has 12 or
13 men's intercollegiate teams
(750 men) while it only has five
for women (fencing is a club
sport). Intramural and club sport
participation is just as
discouraging with 8000 men
participating. This figure includes
men competing in multiple sports,,
so the real figure is less than 8000
and only 260 women. WRM

figures were not available.
Surely this is not all the fault
of Stanford and much is to be
blamed on our society for
discouraging females from being
active participants in athletics.
Administrators in the University
are seriously working on the
inequities in intercollegiate
athletics and intramurals but that
doesn't take away from the fact of
what has been and what presently
exists.
An athletic career once lost is
something that can never be
recovered. In this area Stanford
has not had "the interests and
welfare of [all] students as first
priority."
Stanford should be applauded
for its fine men's programs, but
the lack of equal first rate athletic
opportunity for women has been
appalling and the students and
alumni should be made aware of
this too.

ACT Misuridarstood
Editor:
In the review of ACT'S
production of Richard 111 (Daily,
Oct. 25) reviewer David Moyer
has shown a remarkable
misunderstanding of what ACT
has tried to contribute to theater.
ACT's intent is to entertain
creatively, to lead the audience
through innovative interpretations
to new levels of artistic awareness.
I think another hackneyed "mirror
to nature" production of Richard
111 would have made even
Shakespeare gag.
Furthermore, the reviewer
failed to mention, perhaps because
it would have dealt a major blow
to the foundation of his criticism,
the inspiration that William Ball
drew from the Tolkien trilogy and
Kabuki theatre.
Anyone who has imagined an
"ork" would be impressed rather
than put off by the darkly
imaginative costumes of Robert
Fletcher. And perhaps a critic less
rusted in Western culture would
be more appreciative of the
striking touches derived from
Kabuki.
One last word: I agree that one
hardly "cheers" for right (white)
in the end. It is possible, however,
that this was Ball's intent. The
mood and rhythm of the play are
dark, evoking the darker impulses

from the individuals in the
audience.
Isn't it a final tribute to the
superb talent of director Ball and
actor Duk Kim that even through
the "morass of melodrama" one
continues to sympathize, darkly,
with the enigmatic Richard?

Managerial Misfits
Editor:
It appears as though Larry
Horton's managerial misfits have
done it again.
Last spring it was decided that
the house dues in any house with
freshmen, both four class and all
freshmen, will be $lO, an increase
of $2 over the past year. Yet the
PTR's of freshmen only showed a
charge of $B, while those of
upperclassmen had the correct
amount of $lO.
This oversight has caused havoc
with the accounting procedures
between four class houses, the
ASSU and the students involved.
In a letter to house staff members,
the Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs proposes a complicated
method by which the additional
$2 can be added to freshmen
room rents on the Winter PTRs.
By their own admission this is
just a Catch 22 process to solve
the problem.
If the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs cannot implement
its policies and programs
successfully without the ever
present bureaucratic tie-ups,
perhaps its power to establish
such policies should be
reexamined.

On Marine Protest
Editor:
The recent article (Daily, Oct.
31) on the demonstration
protesting marine recruitment on
campus is representative of the
degree to which Daily news
coverage has deteriorated in past
years.
Since when does coverage of a
demonstration completely leave
out any mention of why the
protest took place? The
anti-imperialist analysis and
content of the rally was not even
mentioned, much less discussed.
Far from being a baseless and
narrow anti-militarist outburst
(which is what the Daily article
implied), the rally was an attempt
to focus attention upon and
protest U.S. imperialism.
The content of the rally, as
shown in the speeches, included
an examination of three
interacting components of U.S.
imperialism:
—the monopoly and oligopoloy
corporations whose drive for
raw materials, markets and profits
is the fundamental cause of U.S.
economic and political
domination of Third World
Countries.

—the military which has
been used as a last resort against
national liberation struggles, such
as that of the Vietnamese who
aim to put an end to U.S.
economic and political
domination.
—in the background, the
universities which through
various kinds of research and
development and in more subtle
ideological ways have participated
and do participate in U.S.
imperialism.
The speakers discussed specific
examples of these three
components: Standard Oil, the
Marines and Stanford. The last
speaker examined a particular
victim of American imperialism,
Puerto Rico.
By not mentioning the
speeches and their content, the
Daily abdicated its responsibility
to provide an accurate account of
events on campus and thus failed
to facilitate the exchange of ideas
within the academic community.

point that at other universities the
80 men who play JV-Frosh
football "would be relegated to
the role of spectators" while at
Stanford they can compete.
I'd like to point out (using
1973-74 figures) that all but the
150 women who participate in
intercollegiate athletics and the
260 that participated in the
intramural and club sport
programs are "relegated to the
role of spectators." This must be
rectified.
Stanford presently has 12 or
13 men's intercollegiate teams
(750 men) while it only has five
for women (fencing is a club
sport). Intramural and club sport
participation is just as
discouraging with 8000 men
participating. This figure includes
men competing in multiple sports,,
so the real figure is less than 8000
and only 260 women. WRM

figures were not available.
Surely this is not all the fault
of Stanford and much is to be
blamed on our society for
discouraging females from being
active participants in athletics.
Administrators in the University
are seriously working on the
inequities in intercollegiate
athletics and intramurals but that
doesn't take away from the fact of
what has been and what presently
exists.
An athletic career once lost is
something that can never be
recovered. In this area Stanford
has not had "the interests and
welfare of [all] students as first
priority."
Stanford should be applauded
for its fine men's programs, but
the lack of equal first rate athletic
opportunity for women has been
appalling and the students and
alumni should be made aware of
this too.

ACT Misuridarstood
Editor:
In the review of ACT'S
production of Richard 111 (Daily,
Oct. 25) reviewer David Moyer
has shown a remarkable
misunderstanding of what ACT
has tried to contribute to theater.
ACT's intent is to entertain
creatively, to lead the audience
through innovative interpretations
to new levels of artistic awareness.
I think another hackneyed "mirror
to nature" production of Richard
111 would have made even
Shakespeare gag.
Furthermore, the reviewer
failed to mention, perhaps because
it would have dealt a major blow
to the foundation of his criticism,
the inspiration that William Ball
drew from the Tolkien trilogy and
Kabuki theatre.
Anyone who has imagined an
"ork" would be impressed rather
than put off by the darkly
imaginative costumes of Robert
Fletcher. And perhaps a critic less
rusted in Western culture would
be more appreciative of the
striking touches derived from
Kabuki.
One last word: I agree that one
hardly "cheers" for right (white)
in the end. It is possible, however,
that this was Ball's intent. The
mood and rhythm of the play are
dark, evoking the darker impulses

from the individuals in the
audience.
Isn't it a final tribute to the
superb talent of director Ball and
actor Duk Kim that even through
the "morass of melodrama" one
continues to sympathize, darkly,
with the enigmatic Richard?

Managerial Misfits
Editor:
It appears as though Larry
Horton's managerial misfits have
done it again.
Last spring it was decided that
the house dues in any house with
freshmen, both four class and all
freshmen, will be $lO, an increase
of $2 over the past year. Yet the
PTR's of freshmen only showed a
charge of $B, while those of
upperclassmen had the correct
amount of $lO.
This oversight has caused havoc
with the accounting procedures
between four class houses, the
ASSU and the students involved.
In a letter to house staff members,
the Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs proposes a complicated
method by which the additional
$2 can be added to freshmen
room rents on the Winter PTRs.
By their own admission this is
just a Catch 22 process to solve
the problem.
If the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs cannot implement
its policies and programs
successfully without the ever
present bureaucratic tie-ups,
perhaps its power to establish
such policies should be
reexamined.

On Marine Protest
Editor:
The recent article (Daily, Oct.
31) on the demonstration
protesting marine recruitment on
campus is representative of the
degree to which Daily news
coverage has deteriorated in past
years.
Since when does coverage of a
demonstration completely leave
out any mention of why the
protest took place? The
anti-imperialist analysis and
content of the rally was not even
mentioned, much less discussed.
Far from being a baseless and
narrow anti-militarist outburst
(which is what the Daily article
implied), the rally was an attempt
to focus attention upon and
protest U.S. imperialism.
The content of the rally, as
shown in the speeches, included
an examination of three
interacting components of U.S.
imperialism:
—the monopoly and oligopoloy
corporations whose drive for
raw materials, markets and profits
is the fundamental cause of U.S.
economic and political
domination of Third World
Countries.

—the military which has
been used as a last resort against
national liberation struggles, such
as that of the Vietnamese who
aim to put an end to U.S.
economic and political
domination.
—in the background, the
universities which through
various kinds of research and
development and in more subtle
ideological ways have participated
and do participate in U.S.
imperialism.
The speakers discussed specific
examples of these three
components: Standard Oil, the
Marines and Stanford. The last
speaker examined a particular
victim of American imperialism,
Puerto Rico.
By not mentioning the
speeches and their content, the
Daily abdicated its responsibility
to provide an accurate account of
events on campus and thus failed
to facilitate the exchange of ideas
within the academic community.

I notice in the flyer handed out

by the newly formed "Alliance
for Radical Change" that the
group is against monopolies,
"with their highly concentrated
economic power," and also
against competition and
competitiveness.
Now, really, one can't be both.
Either one favors a free market
which allows individuals to make
their own choices, thus fostering
competition and rewarding
competitiveness, or one favors
monopoly control of the market
wherein unions, corporations or
(most likely) government
bureaucrats control things.
I am sure that it is considered
progressive at Columbae to be
against a lot of things, but
consistent individuals will have to
choose between monopolies and
competition.

I would like to comment on
Irwin Remson's letter concerning
"Athletic Differences" between
Stanford and other Pac-8 schools.
I agree with Remson that
Stanford is to be commended for
its fine athletic programs for men,
but before Stanford receives this
pat on the back for external
appearances, an internal
examination is needed. What has
the University done for the other
40 percent of the undergraduate
student body the women
students? Remson makes the
point that at other universities the
80 men who play JV-Frosh
football "would be relegated to
the role of spectators" while at
Stanford they can compete.
