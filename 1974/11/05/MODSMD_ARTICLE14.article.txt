### Mason Blacher 
The Great Housing Shortage of
1974 was solved instantly one day
when the University faced the
problem squarely and created
some 250 additional
undergraduate housing places for
far less than the millions thought
necessary. In that same year the
budget of Tresidder Union was
balanced. Indeed, both problems
were solved simultaneously.
It seemed logical: utilities,
location, parking and common
areas were plentiful. The union
had its own dining hall which the
Food Service gladly took over.
With required board the cafeteria
finally paid for itself, and Ph.D.
burgers went the way of emeritus
salad.
Completion of the large, open
residential areas upstairs remained
a challenge. Freshman seminars in
architecture designed corrugated
cardboard cubicles that could be
used for privacy in the meantime.
Stern and Wilbur students
nonetheless scrambled to sign up
for the new dorm. Even several
fraternities offered their houses in
exchange for Present Residence
Priority in Tresidder Hall.
A Few Objections
Of course, there were a few
objections. The Faculty Club
protested that a student housing
complex would "destroy the
character of the area." A "Save
the Union" committee was
formed. Even the USE president,
thinking he had finally won over
the campus, marched in White
Plaza with a placard reading "The
Union Now and Forever."
The remaining Tresidder
workers, by now all non-union
(sic) assistant deans, organized a
boycott and encouraged
Tresidder's regular customers to
eat at their alternative food
service outside; all three of them
did, and they enjoyed the striking
administrators' cooking so much
that the Food Service rehired all
the deans as hashers.
And the Big Dean, not to be
outdone, resigned his position to
become chief cook and bottle
washer. His menus were so
popular especially his chicken
with herb stuffing that one
ASSU presidential slate ran on the
platform of "pot in every
chicken." No one bothered about
a liquor license.
The Board of Trustees was
turned on to the whole idea, and
the President offered his new
recipe for sweet and sour pork.
Expanded Operations
With all this faculty-student
interaction going on, the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies proudly
christened the program "Stanford
in Stanford," seizing the
opportunity to expand his
operations into yet another
building.
Throughout the entire first
year of operation the associate
dean for residences met with
concerned alumni of Tresidder
Union, assuring ihem that he
"wanted their input" and that
"no decisions have been made."
The alums saw that he was only
throwing them a bone, so they
barked at him and chased his car
down Campus Drive.
Meyer Union

A few students, however,
insisted that the University should
provide them with some sort of
union in place of Tresidder. It was
suggested that Meyer Library be
converted to a student union since
it was already the campus social
center and frisbee court. The
Director of Libraries, whose
office walls had collapsed the
night before under the strain of
surplus books, could not be
reached for comment by either
the media or by rescue crews.
Declaring a crisis of
overcrowding in the library and a
shortage of on-campus shelf space,
the Dean appointed a committee
to allocate the available space
fairly. What emerged from their
deliberations was a computerized
program called "Directed Reading
and Writing" (or, DRAW).
Books were assigned at random
to all students regardless of
academic interests: an engineering
student might receive a volumn
of Plato, an art student a business
text, and a sociologist a book of
fairy tales.
With the University awarding
academic credit and contributing
a yearly rent for the storage of
such surplus volumes in student
rooms, the cost of housing
decreased and the students finally
got a liberal education.

With required board the cafeteria
finally paid for itself, and Ph.D.
burgers went the way of emeritus
salad.
Completion of the large, open
residential areas upstairs remained
a challenge. Freshman seminars in
architecture designed corrugated
cardboard cubicles that could be
used for privacy in the meantime.
Stern and Wilbur students
nonetheless scrambled to sign up
for the new dorm. Even several
fraternities offered their houses in
exchange for Present Residence
Priority in Tresidder Hall.
A Few Objections
Of course, there were a few
objections. The Faculty Club
protested that a student housing
complex would "destroy the
character of the area." A "Save
the Union" committee was
formed. Even the USE president,
thinking he had finally won over
the campus, marched in White
Plaza with a placard reading "The
Union Now and Forever."
The remaining Tresidder
workers, by now all non-union
(sic) assistant deans, organized a
boycott and encouraged
Tresidder's regular customers to
eat at their alternative food
service outside; all three of them
did, and they enjoyed the striking
administrators' cooking so much
that the Food Service rehired all
the deans as hashers.
And the Big Dean, not to be
outdone, resigned his position to
become chief cook and bottle
washer. His menus were so
popular especially his chicken
with herb stuffing that one
ASSU presidential slate ran on the
platform of "pot in every
chicken." No one bothered about
a liquor license.
The Board of Trustees was
turned on to the whole idea, and
the President offered his new
recipe for sweet and sour pork.
Expanded Operations
With all this faculty-student
interaction going on, the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies proudly
christened the program "Stanford
in Stanford," seizing the
opportunity to expand his
operations into yet another
building.
Throughout the entire first
year of operation the associate
dean for residences met with
concerned alumni of Tresidder
Union, assuring ihem that he
"wanted their input" and that
"no decisions have been made."
The alums saw that he was only
throwing them a bone, so they
barked at him and chased his car
down Campus Drive.
Meyer Union

A few students, however,
insisted that the University should
provide them with some sort of
union in place of Tresidder. It was
suggested that Meyer Library be
converted to a student union since
it was already the campus social
center and frisbee court. The
Director of Libraries, whose
office walls had collapsed the
night before under the strain of
surplus books, could not be
reached for comment by either
the media or by rescue crews.
Declaring a crisis of
overcrowding in the library and a
shortage of on-campus shelf space,
the Dean appointed a committee
to allocate the available space
fairly. What emerged from their
deliberations was a computerized
program called "Directed Reading
and Writing" (or, DRAW).
Books were assigned at random
to all students regardless of
academic interests: an engineering
student might receive a volumn
of Plato, an art student a business
text, and a sociologist a book of
fairy tales.
With the University awarding
academic credit and contributing
a yearly rent for the storage of
such surplus volumes in student
rooms, the cost of housing
decreased and the students finally
got a liberal education.
(Mason Blacker is a graduate
student in the School of
Education.)
The Great Housing Shortage of
1974 was solved instantly one day
when the University faced the
problem squarely and created
some 250 additional
undergraduate housing places for
far less than the millions thought
necessary. In that same year the
budget of Tresidder Union was
balanced. Indeed, both problems
were solved simultaneously.
It seemed logical: utilities,
location, parking and common
areas were plentiful. The union
had its own dining hall which the
Food Service gladly took over.
