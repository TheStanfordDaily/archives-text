# The 						Real Thing Begins Today
## Police To Issue Bicycle Traffic Tickets 
### SHERI BEBB 
Stanford Public Safety officers will
bsin issuing tickets today to bicyclists
vWating California Vehicle Code
rgulations.
The Department of Public Safety has
;een engaged in a two-week campaign to
inform and warn cyclists of the laws
regarding the operation of bicycles.
Tickets will cost from $lO to $2O
dollars, depending on the nature of the
violation.
Offenders have kept the force busy. One
officer handed out 50 warning sheets to
bicyclists in one night and had to return to
obtain more, said Marvin Herrington,
director of the department.
Officers feel the warning campaign has
paid off already. "People should know by
now," Herrington said. "Hopefully most of
the problems will have been taken care of
voluntarily."
Failure to stop for stop signs is one of
the major offenses. "Ceasing peddling 20
feet before a stop sign and coasting on
through is not sufficient," said Herrington.
"The bicycle has to come to a stop." It is
not required, according to Herrington, for
a bicyclist to put down his foot in order to
make a legal stop. Officers will "use
discretion," said Herrington, in
determining what constitutes an acceptable
stop.
Safety officers will especially watch for
the flagrant violator who rides his bike
without any hands at 10-15 miles per hour,
streaming through an intersectionwithout
even hesitating, Herrington said.
Although officers have been warning
cyclists about violations, many students are
not obeying the laws. A quick check
revealed that at the corner of Mayfield
Avenue and Campus Drive, a four-way
stop, only 15 persons out of 82 made
complete stops. Thirty-one slowed and
rolled through the intersection, and 36
made no attempt to reduce their speed.
Bicyclists will also be cited for operating

a bicycle at night without "proper lights."
According to Herrington, "proper lights"
mean "a white light visible to the front for
300 feet."
Officers will honor the type of light
which can be strapped to arms or legs,
Herrington said. The movement of the light
on the leg "attracts attention to the
bicyclists," he explained. He recommended I
one light for each leg because it can be
difficult for a motorist to see only one
light if it is facing away from him when a
bicycle is stopped at an intersection.
A red reflector visible 300 feet from the

rear is also required. *
Two other dangerous violations are
failure to yield right-of-way to approaching
traffic when entering a roadway from an
alley or path, and riding on the wrong side
of a street. Herrington reminded cyclists
that "bicycles are responsible to stop and
yield right-of-way to any oncoming
traffic."
Tickets for running a stop sign or failing
to yield right-of-way will cost a total of
$2O: $l5 for bail and a $5 penalty
assessment, said Phyllis Anderson, traffic
supervisor for the Palo Alto-Mountain

View Municipal Court. Riding on the
wrong side of the street will cost $lO bail
with no penalty assessment, she reported.
Mary Montoya, senior deputy clerk at
the court, said violators will have 11 days
to clear their tickets, either by paying the
entire fine, or by coming into the court
office and signing up for a court
appearance. No bail money is required if
the violator goes to court, and the judge
will set the amount of the fine.
Any money paid for tickets goes to
Santa Clara County, Herrington said.

Herrington said. The movement of the light
on the leg "attracts attention to the
bicyclists," he explained. He recommended I
one light for each leg because it can be
difficult for a motorist to see only one
light if it is facing away from him when a
bicycle is stopped at an intersection.
A red reflector visible 300 feet from the

rear is also required. *
Two other dangerous violations are
failure to yield right-of-way to approaching
traffic when entering a roadway from an
alley or path, and riding on the wrong side
of a street. Herrington reminded cyclists
that "bicycles are responsible to stop and
yield right-of-way to any oncoming
traffic."
Tickets for running a stop sign or failing
to yield right-of-way will cost a total of
$2O: $l5 for bail and a $5 penalty
assessment, said Phyllis Anderson, traffic
supervisor for the Palo Alto-Mountain

View Municipal Court. Riding on the
wrong side of the street will cost $lO bail
with no penalty assessment, she reported.
Mary Montoya, senior deputy clerk at
the court, said violators will have 11 days
to clear their tickets, either by paying the
entire fine, or by coming into the court
office and signing up for a court
appearance. No bail money is required if
the violator goes to court, and the judge
will set the amount of the fine.
Any money paid for tickets goes to
Santa Clara County, Herrington said.

NO MORE WARNINGS Campus bicyclists will no longer receive warnings from friendly Stanford Public Safety officers. Instead,
beginning today, bicyclists who violate California Vehicle Code regulations will receive real live tickets, ranging from $10 to $20.
Stanford Public Safety officers will
bsin issuing tickets today to bicyclists
vWating California Vehicle Code
rgulations.
The Department of Public Safety has
;een engaged in a two-week campaign to
inform and warn cyclists of the laws
regarding the operation of bicycles.
Tickets will cost from $lO to $2O
dollars, depending on the nature of the
violation.
Offenders have kept the force busy. One
officer handed out 50 warning sheets to
bicyclists in one night and had to return to
obtain more, said Marvin Herrington,
director of the department.
Officers feel the warning campaign has
paid off already. "People should know by
now," Herrington said. "Hopefully most of
the problems will have been taken care of
voluntarily."
Failure to stop for stop signs is one of
the major offenses. "Ceasing peddling 20
feet before a stop sign and coasting on
through is not sufficient," said Herrington.
"The bicycle has to come to a stop." It is
not required, according to Herrington, for
a bicyclist to put down his foot in order to
make a legal stop. Officers will "use
discretion," said Herrington, in
determining what constitutes an acceptable
stop.
Safety officers will especially watch for
the flagrant violator who rides his bike
without any hands at 10-15 miles per hour,
streaming through an intersectionwithout
even hesitating, Herrington said.
Although officers have been warning
cyclists about violations, many students are
not obeying the laws. A quick check
revealed that at the corner of Mayfield
Avenue and Campus Drive, a four-way
stop, only 15 persons out of 82 made
complete stops. Thirty-one slowed and
rolled through the intersection, and 36
made no attempt to reduce their speed.
Bicyclists will also be cited for operating

a bicycle at night without "proper lights."
According to Herrington, "proper lights"
mean "a white light visible to the front for
300 feet."
Officers will honor the type of light
which can be strapped to arms or legs,
Herrington said. The movement of the light
on the leg "attracts attention to the
bicyclists," he explained. He recommended I
one light for each leg because it can be
difficult for a motorist to see only one
light if it is facing away from him when a
