Why can't Stanford have a more efficiently organized Post Office?
When I asked, I was told that the University had turned down
recommendations of three survey teams that our Post Office be
enlarged and that the patrons would just have to suffer. —J.S.
Something is being done about the congested Post Office lobby.
The Post Office is conducting a survey to find out if the Stanford
branch needs more employees.
Stanford branch manager William DeMers recognized the problem,
citing that one of his clerks handled 450 customers one day last week.
Presently, all the Palo Alto routes are being adjusted and Palo Alto
Postmaster James Hodgen said he "would expect [Stanford] to have
another clerk" after the jostling and reorganizing is completed.
He added that the clerk may work forwarding mail most of the
time, but at least he could take over at one of the windows during the
busiest periods.
Regarding surveys which the University has turned down, Hodgens
said the University has never been approached about enlarging the
Post Office.
While you're waiting, however for the addition of one more
clerk, that is at least you can dodge some of the hassle by avoiding
the Post Office during its busiest hours, Mondays and lunchtime.

Why are there no left-handed desks in a number of classrooms? Have
any decision-making administrators ever imagined what it's like to
take a final exam in a chair that's designed to paralyze you? —W.M.E.
The University is not out to get left-handers though it may appear
that way. (If it is, there will be one less Bug bothering them.)
However, the University certainly is making it hard for a number of
students who have to take classes in the Psychology Department, in
particular.
Principal Project Planner Gene Kershner was shocked to hear that
no left-handed seats in psych's room 040 had been installed when the
building was remodeled about five years ago.
He said University policy assures lefties that at least 8-10 percent
of the seats will have special tablet-arms.
He added that the left-handed desks in the psych lecture room
were not intentiopally left out (so to speak); "it was an oversight," he
said. He said he would take note that the oversight did not happen
again.
Maxine Aiken, psychology administrative officer, stated that "we
as a department would be happy to recommend" replacing some of
the right-handed tablet-arms with left-handed ones.
She said she would look into the costs and feasibility immediately,
adding though, that the University might not consider it economically
worthwhile because of its present financial Status.

enlarged and that the patrons would just have to suffer. —J.S.
Something is being done about the congested Post Office lobby.
The Post Office is conducting a survey to find out if the Stanford
branch needs more employees.
Stanford branch manager William DeMers recognized the problem,
citing that one of his clerks handled 450 customers one day last week.
Presently, all the Palo Alto routes are being adjusted and Palo Alto
Postmaster James Hodgen said he "would expect [Stanford] to have
another clerk" after the jostling and reorganizing is completed.
He added that the clerk may work forwarding mail most of the
time, but at least he could take over at one of the windows during the
busiest periods.
Regarding surveys which the University has turned down, Hodgens
said the University has never been approached about enlarging the
Post Office.
While you're waiting, however for the addition of one more
clerk, that is at least you can dodge some of the hassle by avoiding
the Post Office during its busiest hours, Mondays and lunchtime.

Why are there no left-handed desks in a number of classrooms? Have
any decision-making administrators ever imagined what it's like to
take a final exam in a chair that's designed to paralyze you? —W.M.E.
The University is not out to get left-handers though it may appear
that way. (If it is, there will be one less Bug bothering them.)
However, the University certainly is making it hard for a number of
students who have to take classes in the Psychology Department, in
particular.
Principal Project Planner Gene Kershner was shocked to hear that
no left-handed seats in psych's room 040 had been installed when the
building was remodeled about five years ago.
He said University policy assures lefties that at least 8-10 percent
of the seats will have special tablet-arms.
He added that the left-handed desks in the psych lecture room
were not intentiopally left out (so to speak); "it was an oversight," he
said. He said he would take note that the oversight did not happen
again.
Maxine Aiken, psychology administrative officer, stated that "we
as a department would be happy to recommend" replacing some of
the right-handed tablet-arms with left-handed ones.
She said she would look into the costs and feasibility immediately,
adding though, that the University might not consider it economically
worthwhile because of its present financial Status.

Why can't Stanford have a more efficiently organized Post Office?
When I asked, I was told that the University had turned down
recommendations of three survey teams that our Post Office be
enlarged and that the patrons would just have to suffer. —J.S.
