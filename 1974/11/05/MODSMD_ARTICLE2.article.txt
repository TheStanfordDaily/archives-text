# Officals Here Outline Security Measures

University, Police and Fire Department officials yesterday unveiled
security measures they say may help prevent campus crime.
The officials were spurred to action by an increase in, crime here,
including four murders in the past two years and a kidnaping and
attempted rape last month.
At a press conference in Tresidder Union, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington and Fire Chief Frank Jurian encouraged use of the
campus-wide system of fire alarm boxes for persons in danger.
"In the past, it's been rare that anyone used the boxes for purposes
other than fire alarms," Herrington said. "But because of crime problems
we want to emphasize that they are available to anyone in need of help."
Quick Response
Activation of a fire alarm box will within minutes bring 14 fire and
police officers, three fire engines, an emergency truck and at least two
police cars to the alarm area.
The fire alarm system includes 141 street boxes and boxes on every
floor of University residences and most classroom buildings.
Yesterday's announcement was one of several campus safety measures
developed in two ad hoc meetings called last week by Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape, and attended by students and University
officials.
Precautions
One such measure is a list of security precautions to be distributed on
campus next week, and to be published in the Daily and Campus Report,
according to Snape. The list is being prepared by Andrew Doty, director of
community relations, Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of student affairs for
women and Stanford Police Lt. Walter Konar.
In addition, 118-decibel air-horns will be on sale for $3 in the Tresidder
Store within a week. The possible sale of other defense instruments is
being investigated by Anthony Sidlow, manager of Safety and Health.
Also, planning began last week for an escort service for students, faculty
and staff members which could be run by student volunteers. Bruce
Wiggins, operations manager of Plant Services, emphasized at the press
conference that mutual protection must "go hand-in-hand" with individual
caution.
