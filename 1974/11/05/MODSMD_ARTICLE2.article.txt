# Officals Here Outline Security Measures
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
University, Police and Fire Department officials yesterday unveiled
security measures they say may help prevent campus crime.
The officials were spurred to action by an increase in, crime here,
including four murders in the past two years and a kidnaping and
attempted rape last month.
At a press conference in Tresidder Union, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington and Fire Chief Frank Jurian encouraged use of the
campus-wide system of fire alarm boxes for persons in danger.
"In the past, it's been rare that anyone used the boxes for purposes
other than fire alarms," Herrington said. "But because of crime problems
we want to emphasize that they are available to anyone in need of help."
Quick Response
Activation of a fire alarm box will within minutes bring 14 fire and
police officers, three fire engines, an emergency truck and at least two
police cars to the alarm area.
The fire alarm system includes 141 street boxes and boxes on every
floor of University residences and most classroom buildings.
Yesterday's announcement was one of several campus safety measures
developed in two ad hoc meetings called last week by Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape, and attended by students and University
officials.
Precautions
One such measure is a list of security precautions to be distributed on
campus next week, and to be published in the Daily and Campus Report,
according to Snape. The list is being prepared by Andrew Doty, director of
community relations, Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of student affairs for
women and Stanford Police Lt. Walter Konar.
In addition, 118-decibel air-horns will be on sale for $3 in the Tresidder
Store within a week. The possible sale of other defense instruments is
being investigated by Anthony Sidlow, manager of Safety and Health.
Also, planning began last week for an escort service for students, faculty
and staff members which could be run by student volunteers. Bruce
Wiggins, operations manager of Plant Services, emphasized at the press
conference that mutual protection must "go hand-in-hand" with individual
caution.

SECURITY MEASURES Police Chief Marvin Herrington yesterday
unveiled new precautions officials think may deter the increasing trend
towards serious crime on campus.
Wiggins' warning was echoed by a
University employee who was
threatened at knife-point in September
in a ladies' room at Tresidder Union.
"It doesn't pay to be alone after
dark," she said. "Whenever possible,
women should be accompanied at
night."
The employee, who refused to be
identified, emphasized that persons in
danger should not hesitate to call for
help. "Screaming really helps. The fact
that I did so made the man run."
Herrington agreed: Most people are
"programmed not to make a
disturbance, but the faster you react
with noise, the faster you get help."
He suggested that women carry
pencils, pens and loud whistles for
protection.
Other Defenses
Nancy Kaible, a representative of
the Mid-Peninsula YWCA's Rape

Center, said keys gathered between the
knuckles serve as an. effective weapon.
Jurian encouraged the use of
flashlights to deter assailants.
Kaplan, Herrington and Kaible
stressed that victims should report a
rape to the police as soon as possible.
Kaplan said she would be willing to
act as an intermediary for those
victims reluctant to report a rape
directly to the police.
Kaible added that a YWCA "Hot
Line" service (493-7273), operating
around the clock, dispatches trained
women to accompany the rape victim
to the hospital and, if necessary, to the
police station for questioning.

floor of University residences and most classroom buildings.
Yesterday's announcement was one of several campus safety measures
developed in two ad hoc meetings called last week by Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape, and attended by students and University
officials.
Precautions
One such measure is a list of security precautions to be distributed on
campus next week, and to be published in the Daily and Campus Report,
according to Snape. The list is being prepared by Andrew Doty, director of
community relations, Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of student affairs for
women and Stanford Police Lt. Walter Konar.
In addition, 118-decibel air-horns will be on sale for $3 in the Tresidder
Store within a week. The possible sale of other defense instruments is
being investigated by Anthony Sidlow, manager of Safety and Health.
Also, planning began last week for an escort service for students, faculty
and staff members which could be run by student volunteers. Bruce
Wiggins, operations manager of Plant Services, emphasized at the press
conference that mutual protection must "go hand-in-hand" with individual
caution.

SECURITY MEASURES Police Chief Marvin Herrington yesterday
unveiled new precautions officials think may deter the increasing trend
towards serious crime on campus.
Wiggins' warning was echoed by a
University employee who was
threatened at knife-point in September
in a ladies' room at Tresidder Union.
"It doesn't pay to be alone after
dark," she said. "Whenever possible,
women should be accompanied at
night."
The employee, who refused to be
identified, emphasized that persons in
danger should not hesitate to call for
help. "Screaming really helps. The fact
that I did so made the man run."
Herrington agreed: Most people are
"programmed not to make a
disturbance, but the faster you react
with noise, the faster you get help."
He suggested that women carry
pencils, pens and loud whistles for
protection.
Other Defenses
Nancy Kaible, a representative of
the Mid-Peninsula YWCA's Rape

Center, said keys gathered between the
knuckles serve as an. effective weapon.
Jurian encouraged the use of
flashlights to deter assailants.
Kaplan, Herrington and Kaible
stressed that victims should report a
rape to the police as soon as possible.
Kaplan said she would be willing to
act as an intermediary for those
victims reluctant to report a rape
directly to the police.
Kaible added that a YWCA "Hot
Line" service (493-7273), operating
around the clock, dispatches trained
women to accompany the rape victim
to the hospital and, if necessary, to the
police station for questioning.
University, Police and Fire Department officials yesterday unveiled
security measures they say may help prevent campus crime.
The officials were spurred to action by an increase in, crime here,
including four murders in the past two years and a kidnaping and
attempted rape last month.
At a press conference in Tresidder Union, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington and Fire Chief Frank Jurian encouraged use of the
campus-wide system of fire alarm boxes for persons in danger.
"In the past, it's been rare that anyone used the boxes for purposes
other than fire alarms," Herrington said. "But because of crime problems
we want to emphasize that they are available to anyone in need of help."
Quick Response
Activation of a fire alarm box will within minutes bring 14 fire and
police officers, three fire engines, an emergency truck and at least two
police cars to the alarm area.
The fire alarm system includes 141 street boxes and boxes on every
floor of University residences and most classroom buildings.
