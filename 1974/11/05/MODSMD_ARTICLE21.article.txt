## Gilbert & Sullivan Fans Get On-Campus Treats 'World Of G&S' Pleases Dink Fans 
### AARON WEINER 
Hundreds of Gilbert and Sullivan
devotees enjoyed a delightful evening of
musical selections from The World of
Gilbert & Sullivan with soloists of D'Oyly
Carte fame last Friday evening in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. (For those who
may not know, it was producer Richard
D'Oyly Carte who kept the volatile Gilbert
and the sickly Sullivan working together,
and it was his Savoy Theater that was the
first in the world to be lit entirely with
electricity. Now you know where they
term "Savoyards" comes fran...)
The show focuses on many numbers
from The Gondoliers, Princess Ida and
Pirates of Penzance , although nearly all the
operettas were represented in one way or
another.
Baritone patter master John Cartier
amused the audience with his frenetic
rendition of "The Nightmare Song" from
lolanthe and "The Judge's Song" frcm
Trial by Jury. The robust bass Donald
Adams sang the "Colonel's Song" from
Patience, and stole the show with his
famous Mikado impersonation ("My object
all subline"); he has "let the punishment fit
the crime" over 2000 times.
Fortunately, there were two tenors
among the troupe; the famous Thomas
Round, a D'Oyly Carte veteran, who has
sung every major tenor lead; and Geoffrey
Shovelton, a young fellow with a fine
strong voice who could still learn a lot
more from Round.'

Round and Adams were big D'Oyly
Carte stars who broke away in 1963 to
form this renegade troupe, much to the
irritation of the original company. Now,
after a decade without them and with
failing reviews, D'Oyly Carte is trying to
woo them back.
Soprano Anna Bemardin sang "Love Is
a Plaintive Song" from Patience and joined
Thomas Round in the delightful "Kissing
Song" from the Mikado. Contralto Helen
Landis sang "The Duchess' Song" from the
Gondoliers with her strong vibrato but
seemed to be poised rather stiffly. (After
the performance, I discovered what she was
singing with a cracked rib quite a
trooper!)
Landis' only fault was her relatively
trim figure. I just can't appreciate contralto
"Little Buttercup types" unless they're
more ample.
The best parts of the evening were the
numbers that featured the entire ensemble.
There were even sane portions of dialogue
from Pirates and Pinafore. Indeed, these
larger scenes revealed the frustration of this
type of performance. Just as the audience
was beginning to get involved in the plot of
a show, the program would proceed to an
entirely different number.
Fortunately, such frustration will not
last long: the Stanford Savoyards will
present Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S.
Pinafore in its entirety with orchestra
beginning tomorrow night and continuing
for the next two weekends at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.

HARSH WORDS—"He said 'Damme'!" The very proper Sir Josephy Porter (Dan Allen,

out of place in the Royal Navy. The two are featured in Stanford Savoyard's production
of H.M.S. Pinafore, which opens tomorrow night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

Hundreds of Gilbert and Sullivan
devotees enjoyed a delightful evening of
musical selections from The World of
Gilbert & Sullivan with soloists of D'Oyly
Carte fame last Friday evening in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. (For those who
may not know, it was producer Richard
D'Oyly Carte who kept the volatile Gilbert
and the sickly Sullivan working together,
and it was his Savoy Theater that was the
first in the world to be lit entirely with
electricity. Now you know where they
term "Savoyards" comes fran...)
The show focuses on many numbers
from The Gondoliers, Princess Ida and
Pirates of Penzance , although nearly all the
operettas were represented in one way or
another.
Baritone patter master John Cartier
amused the audience with his frenetic
rendition of "The Nightmare Song" from
lolanthe and "The Judge's Song" frcm
Trial by Jury. The robust bass Donald
Adams sang the "Colonel's Song" from
Patience, and stole the show with his
famous Mikado impersonation ("My object
all subline"); he has "let the punishment fit
the crime" over 2000 times.
Fortunately, there were two tenors
among the troupe; the famous Thomas
Round, a D'Oyly Carte veteran, who has
sung every major tenor lead; and Geoffrey
Shovelton, a young fellow with a fine
strong voice who could still learn a lot
more from Round.'

Round and Adams were big D'Oyly
Carte stars who broke away in 1963 to
form this renegade troupe, much to the
irritation of the original company. Now,
after a decade without them and with
failing reviews, D'Oyly Carte is trying to
woo them back.
Soprano Anna Bemardin sang "Love Is
a Plaintive Song" from Patience and joined
Thomas Round in the delightful "Kissing
Song" from the Mikado. Contralto Helen
Landis sang "The Duchess' Song" from the
Gondoliers with her strong vibrato but
seemed to be poised rather stiffly. (After
the performance, I discovered what she was
singing with a cracked rib quite a
trooper!)
Landis' only fault was her relatively
trim figure. I just can't appreciate contralto
"Little Buttercup types" unless they're
more ample.
The best parts of the evening were the
numbers that featured the entire ensemble.
There were even sane portions of dialogue
from Pirates and Pinafore. Indeed, these
larger scenes revealed the frustration of this
type of performance. Just as the audience
was beginning to get involved in the plot of
a show, the program would proceed to an
entirely different number.
Fortunately, such frustration will not
last long: the Stanford Savoyards will
present Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S.
Pinafore in its entirety with orchestra
beginning tomorrow night and continuing
for the next two weekends at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
