## 'Rhoda': Best Of The New Shows 
### George Dobbins 
Rhoda is undoubtedly the best
new show of the current season.
Normally, we "have to hem and
haw to say something nice about a
television program, but in this
case, we really have to put our
nitpicks to the grind to be mean
and nasty.
Darn you, Rhoda , you're
making us confess that lurking
beneath our evil soul is a kind
heart. And God forbid even a
sense of humor.
Indeed this series combines
both of these qualities into a
weekly half-hour of sheer
enjoyment. Its best characteristic
is a main character whose troubles
we can identify with: "I'm not
easy to live with. I'm overly
sensitive. And this eating thing;
sometimes, I go two days straight
talking of nothing but food. I'm
boring, not to mention my
mother and I have no experience
living with a man."
That is Rhoda Morgenstern,
33-year-old single working girl
who returns to her home town of
Manhattan seeking fortune, fame
and her own successful television
series. According to the ratings,
the latter she has found.
Integral Part
Much of the reason for her
success is Valerie Harper, the
actress who for four years gave
her life on The Mary Tyler Moore
Show. As a Time cover story
recently stated, Harper plays the
part "without spilling a grain of
makeup or a scintilla of style."
And for a girl who is "not
Jewish, not from New York" and
has "a small shicksa nose," Harper
convinces us that she was Bat
Mitzvahed yesterday and could
narrate a tour of New York
Harbor on a moment's notice.
Her companions in comedy
certainly were not cast in a
moment's notice. They too are
pros. Her father (veteran actor
Harold Gould) combines just the
right degree of shyness with
assertiveness.

Her overweight sister, Brenda I
(Julie Kavner), truly resembles
Rhoda and is the most realistic
sister we've seen in a long time.
She combines affection for others
and self-concern most charmingly.
And she always sets up funny
lines for Rhoda, as in the recent
one-hour wedding episode when
she advised, "Rhoda, don't get
nervous; it's just a wedding."
"And Sarah Lee is just a
cheesecake," Rhoda answered.
Speaking of cheesecake,
Rhoda's meddling mother, Ida
(Nancy Walker), not only
resembles Rhoda but as Time
commented, her "timing could be
used to set observatory clocks."
Ida's timing has to be perfect
because her lines are so critical in
getting the laugh.
Private Ceremony?
In the wedding episode, she
urged Rhoda to have the
ceremony in her apartment rather
than at a public building. Rhoda
vehemently disagreed:
"This time, it isn't just another
day in my life. It's my wedding
day and that's it."
"So what's your decision?" Ida
asked.
Rhoda's decision was to marry
Joe Gerard (David Groh), a
demolition contractor whom she
has dated for several weeks. At
one point he told her, "Let's fact
it; marriage is an unnatural
relationship." Perhaps. But it is a
natural way to keep a series going
and for Joe to keep an acting job.
Groh is not a well-known actor,
but so far he has impressed us by
not hamming up a role that
entices one to do just that.
The series doesn't have to ham
anything up because the plots are
so kosher. They are clean, clear,
easy to follow and funny. And
i each week they move us in a
' forward direction.
We have seen Rhoda looking
i for jobs, dating people, meeting
i Joe and most recently getting
married. In weeks to come, we

will see her thinking she's
pregnant, going to the doctor and,
well, tune in to find out what
happens. But the series does hold
our interest for this reason.
R-Rated Show
And this show isn't afraid to be
risque. It doesn't hide sexual
allusions or even political and
ethical feelings that are all part of
adulthood.
Perhaps its great characteristics
can be summed up by examining
the wedding episode. As usual, the
lines were excellent. When Rhoda
said about her wedding dress,
"This is its fifth wedding and if it
hears 'you're next' one more time,
it's gonna throw up," we
chuckled. When Ida, while waiting
for Rhoda to arrive on the
wedding day, told Mary, "You've
always been like a daughter to me.
So shut up," we really laughed.
The story too was superior.
The main plot involved old
acquaintance Phyllis (Cloris
Leachman) forgetting to pick up
Rhoda and bring her to the
wedding. But we also were both
touched and amused by Rhoda
and Mary reliving moments of
Rhoda's single days. Memories
like Phyllis trying to fix Rhoda

up with a man: "He's not my type
... He's witty, he's handsome,
he's wealthy . . . he's gay."
As we have hinted, the greatest
part of this episode was the
homecoming of all the
tremendous characters that Rhoda
began with on Mary's show: Lou
Grant, Murray, Phyllis, even Ted
Baxter's girlfriend, Georgette.
We were upset that Ted didn't
arrive at the wedding. In fact, that
angered us. But this reviewer must
say about this series what Joe told
Rhoda upon hearing of her
imperfections:
"Some of these things are
really a pain; some of my things
are really a pain. But I have no
choice here 'cause I'm in love."
