# Chamber Music Tonight
## 
### 
The Office of Public Events
continues its fall quarter
presentations tonight with the
Beaux Arts Trio of New York.
The trio will play in
Dinkelspiel at 8 p.m.
Members of the trio include
Menahem Pressler, piano;
Isadore Cohen, violin; and
Bernard Greenhouse, cello.
Their program includes
Beethoven Trio in B-flat Major,
Opus 11 and works of Ives
{Trio-1904) and Brahms ( Trio
in C Major, Opus 87).
This extraordinary
triumvirate made its debut 20
years ago. More than 35,000
performances later they still
perform with a freshness and
oneness seldom matched.
A favorite of music festivals,
they have played throughout
North America, Europe, Africa
and the Middle East.
Tickets for the performance
are $2.75 for students, $4.75
for all others.
