# Savoyards Present 'Pinafore'
## 
### 
For everyone's thorough
enjoyment, the Stanford
Savoyards are staging one of
Gilbert and Sullivan's liveliest
comedies, H.M.S. Pinafore. For
many, this group needs no
introduction and, indeed, no
plugging. In the past couple of
years, they have turned on
community-wide audiences to the
magic and uproarious wit of
Gilbert and Sullivan.
Recently, a few changes in the
production staff have taken place,
but all for the better according to
producer Mason Blacher.
Lindi Bauman, the new director
of the group, is new neither to
Gilbert and Sullivan nor to
Stanford. She was active in Ram's
Head as an undergraduate here.
More recently, she has worked
with the Lamplighters of San
Francisco, directing their very fine
Mikado last fall.
Chris Lanz, the extremely
musical choral director, is a
neophyte to the Savoyards. The
music director and conductor a
veteran with the group is Dan
Robinson, a doctoral candidate in
music here.
The Savoyards are made up of
all Gilbert and Sullivan fans in and
around the Stanford community,
not just students, and the talent
goes a lot deeper than the
performing cast. The troupe is
sparing no expense with respect to
costumes and scenery.
Dinkelspiel stage has been
fantastically transformed into a
two story ship by designer Gary
Crossman and master carpenter
Bruce Chamberlain and crew. The
cast is being expertly costumed by
Marian Col well, a junior who has
taken this quarter off from her
studies to work with the San

Francisco Opera.
The story is one of love that
evolves on board the H.M.S.
Pinafore, involving a true blue,
but lowly, foremast hand and the
ship captain's daughter, played by
Gerald Moshell and Pat Hallahan,
respectively.
Captain Corcoran, played by
Tim Martin, has happily obliged
to give her hand in marriage to the
foppish Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.8.,
the Admiral of the High Seas
(played by Dan Allan), who is
obviously of more suitable social
rank.
The real fun and drama begins
when Sir Joseph comes on board
the ship with his barrage of sisters,
cousins and aunts.
The plot thickens with pure
Gilbert and Sullivan class.
Dastardly Dick Deadeye, played
by Pete Vilkin, plays informer and
Little Buttercup, the bumboat
women played by Ella Asbury,
keeps crucial secrets; all of this
bringing the excitement to a peak.
In the widely circulated
booklet, The Lively Arts at
Stanford, Tom Bacchetti is
quoted as stating: "This dedicated
and talented Stanford performing
troupe brings to the mid-Peninsula
the best Gilbert and Sullivan
production seen in many a day."
They plan to keep the trend
going, starting Nov. 6 and
repeating on Nov. 8, 9,10 and 17
at 8 pan. and on Nov. 16 at 2
p.m. Tickets are going fast at the
Tresidder box office.

Crossman and master carpenter
Bruce Chamberlain and crew. The
cast is being expertly costumed by
Marian Col well, a junior who has
taken this quarter off from her
studies to work with the San

Francisco Opera.
The story is one of love that
evolves on board the H.M.S.
Pinafore, involving a true blue,
but lowly, foremast hand and the
ship captain's daughter, played by
Gerald Moshell and Pat Hallahan,
respectively.
Captain Corcoran, played by
Tim Martin, has happily obliged
to give her hand in marriage to the
foppish Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.8.,
the Admiral of the High Seas
(played by Dan Allan), who is
obviously of more suitable social
rank.
The real fun and drama begins
when Sir Joseph comes on board
the ship with his barrage of sisters,
cousins and aunts.
The plot thickens with pure
Gilbert and Sullivan class.
Dastardly Dick Deadeye, played
by Pete Vilkin, plays informer and
Little Buttercup, the bumboat
women played by Ella Asbury,
keeps crucial secrets; all of this
bringing the excitement to a peak.
In the widely circulated
booklet, The Lively Arts at
Stanford, Tom Bacchetti is
quoted as stating: "This dedicated
and talented Stanford performing
troupe brings to the mid-Peninsula
the best Gilbert and Sullivan
production seen in many a day."
They plan to keep the trend
going, starting Nov. 6 and
repeating on Nov. 8, 9,10 and 17
at 8 pan. and on Nov. 16 at 2
p.m. Tickets are going fast at the
Tresidder box office.
For everyone's thorough
enjoyment, the Stanford
Savoyards are staging one of
Gilbert and Sullivan's liveliest
comedies, H.M.S. Pinafore. For
many, this group needs no
introduction and, indeed, no
plugging. In the past couple of
years, they have turned on
community-wide audiences to the
magic and uproarious wit of
Gilbert and Sullivan.
Recently, a few changes in the
production staff have taken place,
but all for the better according to
producer Mason Blacher.
Lindi Bauman, the new director
of the group, is new neither to
Gilbert and Sullivan nor to
Stanford. She was active in Ram's
Head as an undergraduate here.
More recently, she has worked
with the Lamplighters of San
Francisco, directing their very fine
Mikado last fall.
Chris Lanz, the extremely
musical choral director, is a
neophyte to the Savoyards. The
music director and conductor a
veteran with the group is Dan
Robinson, a doctoral candidate in
music here.
The Savoyards are made up of
all Gilbert and Sullivan fans in and
around the Stanford community,
not just students, and the talent
goes a lot deeper than the
performing cast. The troupe is
sparing no expense with respect to
costumes and scenery.
Dinkelspiel stage has been
fantastically transformed into a
two story ship by designer Gary
Crossman and master carpenter
Bruce Chamberlain and crew. The
cast is being expertly costumed by
Marian Col well, a junior who has
taken this quarter off from her
studies to work with the San

Francisco Opera.
