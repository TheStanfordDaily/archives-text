Proposal May Avert Coal Strike
WASHINGTON Coal industry and union negotiators,
faced with a growing strike threat, broke a 24-hour impasse
in bargaining last night as sources said management offered
a comprehensive contract proposal.
The package, a counter-proposal to the union's latest
economic demands, were believed to represent a better than
40 percent increase in wages and benefits over three years.
Sources said the new management offer was made
shortly after negotiators for the coal operators and the
United Mine Workers resumed talks at the urging of the
government's chief labor mediator.
Guy Farmer, the chief industry negotiator, said
management would try "to resolve all issues," indicating
the owners were prepared to meet through the night in an
effort to reach a tentative contract settlement.
A union official involved in the negotiations said he also
felt this could be "one big effort to get it settled."
However, he said, the odds of avoiding a strike next week
were slim.
Earlier, Harry Patrick, UMW secretary-treasurer, said that
even if the negotiations resume it was his judgment "that
we cannot avert a walkout of some length at this point."
But Usery disagreed with that assessment, saying a strike
next week was not inevitable.
He said there was still time to reach an agreement and get
it ratified.
Memo Reveals Additional Cover-Up
WASHINGTON Prosecution lawyers jolted the
Watergate cover-up trial yesterday with the disclosure that
they had obtained a copy of an E. Howard Hunt Jr.
memorandum they thought had been destroyed.
Prosecutor James F. Neal said a copy of the two and a
half-page memorandum was obtained over the weekend
from William O. Bittman, Hunt's former lawyer. Neal said
that for a year and one-half Bittman had denied that he
ever received the memo.

The memo introduced into evidence by Neal was headed
"Review and Statement of Problem." It speaks of the
administration keeping its commitments in behalf of the
seven defendants in the June 17,1972, Watergate break-in.
The suprise disclosure prompted lawyers for two of the
five defendants in the cover-up trial to move for a mistrial.
"I am faced with a cover-up within a cover-up," said
Jacob Stein, lawyer for Kenneth W. Parkinson, the man
Hunt said he intended to receive the memo.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica made no immediate
response to Stein's request for a mistrial. He denied a
similar request from John J. Wilson, lawyer for H.R.
Haldeman, former White House staff chief and one of the
five men charged with conspiring to block the investigation
of the Watergate break-in.
Mideast Talks Begin Without PLO
WASHINGTON Egypt won't demand an immediate
start of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian
Liberation Organization as a condition to another round of
peace talks between Cairo and Jerusalem, an Egyptian
official said yesterday.
The. official, who could not be quoted directly or
identified by name, said the question of the PLO and the
fate of the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
is part of the same package involving an Israeli-Egyptian
settlement.
But he emphasized that peace efforts in this area could
follow the pattern set after the 1973 Middle East war when
Israel negotiated an initial disengagement agreement with
Egypt first, with similar talks coming later with Syria.
That was really a single process, the official said, and can
be repeated now as long as Israel doesn't try to freeze the

element involving the PLO.
He was referring to Israeli statements that it will never
negotiate directly or indirectly with the PLO, which
Jerusalem officials call a murderous terrorist organization
devoted to the destruction of their state.
The official's statement was particularly important
following reports that the Rabat decision to recognize the
PLO as the sole spokesman for dealing with the West Bank
has created a major if not insurmountable obstacle to
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's peace efforts.
Nixon Continues To Improve
LONG BEACH Richard M. Nixon took a few halting
steps yesterday leaving his bed for the first time since
undergoing surgery last week, a hospital spokesman said.
The former president was helped by nurses, and he
continued to be attached to wires hooked to equipment
monitoring his blood pressure, pulse and heart beat,
Norman Nager told newsmen.
While Nixon was well enough to get out of bed at
Memorial Hospital Medical Center, he was still listed in
serious condition by his physician, John C. Lungren.
In a written statement, Lungren said there was concern
about a deficiency in blood platelets, needed to prevent
further internal bleeding, and a small amount of fluid in
Nixon's left lung.
But Lungren was obviously proud of his patient's
improvement, and a hospital spokesman said Nixon may be
placed under intermediate care a near-normal category
today or tomorrow, if he continues to improve.
But it is too early to speculate when Nixon may leave the
hospital, the spokesman added.
Nixon, 61, was taken off the critical list Sunday after six
days and was allowed to sit up on the side of his bed and
eat soft foods such as custard, pureed meats and vegetables.
Expo Closes A Financial Success
SPOKANE, Wash. Expo '74, the world's fair many
thought would never open, has ended its 184-day life amid
the cheers of business and government officials who say it
was one of the nation's most successful international
exhibitions. -
The success list includes:
Attendance of about 5.2 million, exceeding original
projections by 500,000.
A revitalized central core for this regional hub city,
including a 100-acre site for a downtown park where there
once was a jungle of slums and railroad ties.
A new leadership role for Spokane in environmental
planning and community involvement programs.
Nearly $4 million in new taxes for local and state
governments.
A final balance sheet almost certain to finish no worse
than the break-even point.
Construction of businesses and private homes bucking
the national trend toward recession.
Expo began as a kind of urban renewal project four years
ago. It was backed mainly by downtown businessmen who
wanted to clean up the city's image and revitalize the town.
But Spokane, with a population of 180,000, was given
little chance to pull off an international undertaking. In
fact, the fair almost floundered, but was rescued by a
professional management team, one which General Manager
Peter Spurney said "picked up where the dreamers left
off."
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but variable high clouds today.
Local night and morning fog. Slightly warmer tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today in the 60s and
tomorrow in mid 60s to low 70s. Variable wind 5 to 15
mph.

Proposal May Avert Coal Strike
WASHINGTON Coal industry and union negotiators,
faced with a growing strike threat, broke a 24-hour impasse
in bargaining last night as sources said management offered
a comprehensive contract proposal.
The package, a counter-proposal to the union's latest
economic demands, were believed to represent a better than
40 percent increase in wages and benefits over three years.
Sources said the new management offer was made
shortly after negotiators for the coal operators and the
United Mine Workers resumed talks at the urging of the
government's chief labor mediator.
Guy Farmer, the chief industry negotiator, said
management would try "to resolve all issues," indicating
the owners were prepared to meet through the night in an
effort to reach a tentative contract settlement.
A union official involved in the negotiations said he also
felt this could be "one big effort to get it settled."
However, he said, the odds of avoiding a strike next week
were slim.
Earlier, Harry Patrick, UMW secretary-treasurer, said that
even if the negotiations resume it was his judgment "that
we cannot avert a walkout of some length at this point."
But Usery disagreed with that assessment, saying a strike
next week was not inevitable.
He said there was still time to reach an agreement and get
it ratified.
Memo Reveals Additional Cover-Up
WASHINGTON Prosecution lawyers jolted the
Watergate cover-up trial yesterday with the disclosure that
they had obtained a copy of an E. Howard Hunt Jr.
memorandum they thought had been destroyed.
Prosecutor James F. Neal said a copy of the two and a
half-page memorandum was obtained over the weekend
from William O. Bittman, Hunt's former lawyer. Neal said
that for a year and one-half Bittman had denied that he
ever received the memo.

The memo introduced into evidence by Neal was headed
"Review and Statement of Problem." It speaks of the
administration keeping its commitments in behalf of the
seven defendants in the June 17,1972, Watergate break-in.
The suprise disclosure prompted lawyers for two of the
five defendants in the cover-up trial to move for a mistrial.
"I am faced with a cover-up within a cover-up," said
Jacob Stein, lawyer for Kenneth W. Parkinson, the man
Hunt said he intended to receive the memo.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica made no immediate
response to Stein's request for a mistrial. He denied a
similar request from John J. Wilson, lawyer for H.R.
Haldeman, former White House staff chief and one of the
five men charged with conspiring to block the investigation
of the Watergate break-in.
Mideast Talks Begin Without PLO
WASHINGTON Egypt won't demand an immediate
start of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian
Liberation Organization as a condition to another round of
peace talks between Cairo and Jerusalem, an Egyptian
official said yesterday.
The. official, who could not be quoted directly or
identified by name, said the question of the PLO and the
fate of the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
is part of the same package involving an Israeli-Egyptian
settlement.
But he emphasized that peace efforts in this area could
follow the pattern set after the 1973 Middle East war when
Israel negotiated an initial disengagement agreement with
Egypt first, with similar talks coming later with Syria.
That was really a single process, the official said, and can
be repeated now as long as Israel doesn't try to freeze the

element involving the PLO.
He was referring to Israeli statements that it will never
negotiate directly or indirectly with the PLO, which
Jerusalem officials call a murderous terrorist organization
devoted to the destruction of their state.
The official's statement was particularly important
following reports that the Rabat decision to recognize the
PLO as the sole spokesman for dealing with the West Bank
has created a major if not insurmountable obstacle to
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's peace efforts.
Nixon Continues To Improve
LONG BEACH Richard M. Nixon took a few halting
steps yesterday leaving his bed for the first time since
undergoing surgery last week, a hospital spokesman said.
The former president was helped by nurses, and he
continued to be attached to wires hooked to equipment
monitoring his blood pressure, pulse and heart beat,
Norman Nager told newsmen.
While Nixon was well enough to get out of bed at
Memorial Hospital Medical Center, he was still listed in
serious condition by his physician, John C. Lungren.
In a written statement, Lungren said there was concern
about a deficiency in blood platelets, needed to prevent
further internal bleeding, and a small amount of fluid in
Nixon's left lung.
But Lungren was obviously proud of his patient's
improvement, and a hospital spokesman said Nixon may be
placed under intermediate care a near-normal category
today or tomorrow, if he continues to improve.
But it is too early to speculate when Nixon may leave the
hospital, the spokesman added.
Nixon, 61, was taken off the critical list Sunday after six
days and was allowed to sit up on the side of his bed and
eat soft foods such as custard, pureed meats and vegetables.
Expo Closes A Financial Success
SPOKANE, Wash. Expo '74, the world's fair many
thought would never open, has ended its 184-day life amid
the cheers of business and government officials who say it
was one of the nation's most successful international
exhibitions. -
The success list includes:
Attendance of about 5.2 million, exceeding original
projections by 500,000.
A revitalized central core for this regional hub city,
including a 100-acre site for a downtown park where there
once was a jungle of slums and railroad ties.
A new leadership role for Spokane in environmental
planning and community involvement programs.
Nearly $4 million in new taxes for local and state
governments.
A final balance sheet almost certain to finish no worse
than the break-even point.
Construction of businesses and private homes bucking
the national trend toward recession.
Expo began as a kind of urban renewal project four years
ago. It was backed mainly by downtown businessmen who
wanted to clean up the city's image and revitalize the town.

once was a jungle of slums and railroad ties.
A new leadership role for Spokane in environmental
planning and community involvement programs.
Nearly $4 million in new taxes for local and state
governments.
A final balance sheet almost certain to finish no worse

Construction of businesses and private homes bucking

Expo began as a kind of urban renewal project four years
ago. It was backed mainly by downtown businessmen who
wanted to clean up the city's image and revitalize the town.
But Spokane, with a population of 180,000, was given
little chance to pull off an international undertaking. In
fact, the fair almost floundered, but was rescued by a
professional management team, one which General Manager
Peter Spurney said "picked up where the dreamers left
off."

Proposal May Avert Coal Strike
WASHINGTON Coal industry and union negotiators,
faced with a growing strike threat, broke a 24-hour impasse
in bargaining last night as sources said management offered
a comprehensive contract proposal.
The package, a counter-proposal to the union's latest
economic demands, were believed to represent a better than
40 percent increase in wages and benefits over three years.
Sources said the new management offer was made
shortly after negotiators for the coal operators and the
United Mine Workers resumed talks at the urging of the
government's chief labor mediator.
Guy Farmer, the chief industry negotiator, said
management would try "to resolve all issues," indicating
the owners were prepared to meet through the night in an
effort to reach a tentative contract settlement.
A union official involved in the negotiations said he also
felt this could be "one big effort to get it settled."
However, he said, the odds of avoiding a strike next week
were slim.
Earlier, Harry Patrick, UMW secretary-treasurer, said that
even if the negotiations resume it was his judgment "that
we cannot avert a walkout of some length at this point."
But Usery disagreed with that assessment, saying a strike
next week was not inevitable.
He said there was still time to reach an agreement and get
it ratified.
Memo Reveals Additional Cover-Up
WASHINGTON Prosecution lawyers jolted the
Watergate cover-up trial yesterday with the disclosure that
they had obtained a copy of an E. Howard Hunt Jr.
memorandum they thought had been destroyed.
Prosecutor James F. Neal said a copy of the two and a
half-page memorandum was obtained over the weekend
from William O. Bittman, Hunt's former lawyer. Neal said
that for a year and one-half Bittman had denied that he
ever received the memo.

The memo introduced into evidence by Neal was headed
"Review and Statement of Problem." It speaks of the
administration keeping its commitments in behalf of the
seven defendants in the June 17,1972, Watergate break-in.
The suprise disclosure prompted lawyers for two of the
five defendants in the cover-up trial to move for a mistrial.
"I am faced with a cover-up within a cover-up," said
Jacob Stein, lawyer for Kenneth W. Parkinson, the man
Hunt said he intended to receive the memo.
U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica made no immediate
response to Stein's request for a mistrial. He denied a
similar request from John J. Wilson, lawyer for H.R.
Haldeman, former White House staff chief and one of the
five men charged with conspiring to block the investigation
of the Watergate break-in.
Mideast Talks Begin Without PLO
WASHINGTON Egypt won't demand an immediate
start of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian
Liberation Organization as a condition to another round of
peace talks between Cairo and Jerusalem, an Egyptian
official said yesterday.
The. official, who could not be quoted directly or
identified by name, said the question of the PLO and the
fate of the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
is part of the same package involving an Israeli-Egyptian
settlement.
But he emphasized that peace efforts in this area could
follow the pattern set after the 1973 Middle East war when
Israel negotiated an initial disengagement agreement with
Egypt first, with similar talks coming later with Syria.
That was really a single process, the official said, and can
be repeated now as long as Israel doesn't try to freeze the

element involving the PLO.
He was referring to Israeli statements that it will never
negotiate directly or indirectly with the PLO, which
Jerusalem officials call a murderous terrorist organization
devoted to the destruction of their state.
The official's statement was particularly important
following reports that the Rabat decision to recognize the
PLO as the sole spokesman for dealing with the West Bank
has created a major if not insurmountable obstacle to
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's peace efforts.
Nixon Continues To Improve
LONG BEACH Richard M. Nixon took a few halting
steps yesterday leaving his bed for the first time since
undergoing surgery last week, a hospital spokesman said.
The former president was helped by nurses, and he
continued to be attached to wires hooked to equipment
monitoring his blood pressure, pulse and heart beat,
Norman Nager told newsmen.
While Nixon was well enough to get out of bed at
Memorial Hospital Medical Center, he was still listed in
serious condition by his physician, John C. Lungren.
In a written statement, Lungren said there was concern
about a deficiency in blood platelets, needed to prevent
further internal bleeding, and a small amount of fluid in
Nixon's left lung.
But Lungren was obviously proud of his patient's
improvement, and a hospital spokesman said Nixon may be
placed under intermediate care a near-normal category
today or tomorrow, if he continues to improve.
But it is too early to speculate when Nixon may leave the
hospital, the spokesman added.
Nixon, 61, was taken off the critical list Sunday after six
days and was allowed to sit up on the side of his bed and
eat soft foods such as custard, pureed meats and vegetables.

Expo Closes A Financial Success
SPOKANE, Wash. Expo '74, the world's fair many
thought would never open, has ended its 184-day life amid
the cheers of business and government officials who say it
was one of the nation's most successful international
exhibitions. -
The success list includes:
Attendance of about 5.2 million, exceeding original
projections by 500,000.
A revitalized central core for this regional hub city,
including a 100-acre site for a downtown park where there
once was a jungle of slums and railroad ties.
A new leadership role for Spokane in environmental
planning and community involvement programs.
Nearly $4 million in new taxes for local and state
governments.
A final balance sheet almost certain to finish no worse
than the break-even point.
Construction of businesses and private homes bucking
the national trend toward recession.
Expo began as a kind of urban renewal project four years
ago. It was backed mainly by downtown businessmen who
wanted to clean up the city's image and revitalize the town.
But Spokane, with a population of 180,000, was given
little chance to pull off an international undertaking. In
fact, the fair almost floundered, but was rescued by a
professional management team, one which General Manager
Peter Spurney said "picked up where the dreamers left
off."
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but variable high clouds today.
Local night and morning fog. Slightly warmer tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today in the 60s and
tomorrow in mid 60s to low 70s. Variable wind 5 to 15
mph.
