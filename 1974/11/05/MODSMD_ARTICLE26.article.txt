# Housing Subcommittee Approved
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The ASSU Senate last night rejected
and then approved an ASSU
Nominations Committee Report which
selected three undergraduates to serve
on a new advisory subcommittee for
residences.
According to the report, the
subcommittee "will review the housing
system, resident assistant (RA)
selection and the validity of residential
education programs."
The Senate approved the report by
a 9-5 vote. Most senators initially
objected that no graduate student had
been named to the subcommittee and
temporarily blocked passage of the
report.
However, the subcommittee's
co-chairperson, A1 Tomazczuk, said,
"This issue [housing] is the most
important issue on campus. We can't
afford to wait [in forming the
subcommittee]."
'Don't Delay'
Suzi Harmatz, chairwoman of the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS) and ex-officio member of the
subcommittee, urged that the ASSU
Senate not delay in forming the
subcommittee. "Larry Horton
[associate dean of students] will make
his decisions [on housing] with or
without student input," Harmatz
said.
The Nominations Committee chose
junior Roberta Bowman, senior
Robert Flynn and junior Thomas Ross
Perry to serve on the subcommittee.
Subcommittee members selected are
"people who have a broad sense of the
residential problem at Stanford," said
ASSU President Mike Herman. "It's
better to have three undergraduates

who are well-versed in the graduate
situation than a graduate student who
is simply an advocate of a particular
viewpoint." Herman serves on the
Nominations Committee.
Little Grad Response
Four of the 27 applicants for the
subcommittee were graduate students,
Nominations Committee member
Barbara Glenn said. Glenn agreed with
Herman that those selected, after a
long screening process, were the most
qualified.
"I am disturbed and distressed at
the lack of graduate response. My

constituency has let me down," said
Glenn, a graduate student.
Tomazczuk and Harmatz agreed to
appoint graduate students to the
subcommittee as "co-opt" members,
invited to speak at meetings without
the power to vote.
The Senate will hold a special
meeting next Monday at 7:30 p.m. at
which all students are invited to
comment on the Senate's effectiveness
and finances of the ASSU and the
Council of Presidents. The meeting
place has not yet been determined.

Subcommittee members selected are
"people who have a broad sense of the
residential problem at Stanford," said
ASSU President Mike Herman. "It's
better to have three undergraduates

who are well-versed in the graduate
situation than a graduate student who
is simply an advocate of a particular
viewpoint." Herman serves on the
Nominations Committee.
Little Grad Response
Four of the 27 applicants for the
subcommittee were graduate students,
Nominations Committee member
Barbara Glenn said. Glenn agreed with
Herman that those selected, after a
long screening process, were the most
qualified.
"I am disturbed and distressed at
the lack of graduate response. My

constituency has let me down," said
Glenn, a graduate student.
Tomazczuk and Harmatz agreed to
appoint graduate students to the
subcommittee as "co-opt" members,
invited to speak at meetings without
the power to vote.
The Senate will hold a special
meeting next Monday at 7:30 p.m. at
which all students are invited to
comment on the Senate's effectiveness
and finances of the ASSU and the
Council of Presidents. The meeting
place has not yet been determined.
The ASSU Senate last night rejected
and then approved an ASSU
Nominations Committee Report which
selected three undergraduates to serve
on a new advisory subcommittee for
residences.
According to the report, the
subcommittee "will review the housing
system, resident assistant (RA)
selection and the validity of residential
education programs."
The Senate approved the report by
a 9-5 vote. Most senators initially
objected that no graduate student had
been named to the subcommittee and
temporarily blocked passage of the
report.
However, the subcommittee's
co-chairperson, A1 Tomazczuk, said,
"This issue [housing] is the most
important issue on campus. We can't
afford to wait [in forming the
subcommittee]."
'Don't Delay'
Suzi Harmatz, chairwoman of the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS) and ex-officio member of the
subcommittee, urged that the ASSU
Senate not delay in forming the
subcommittee. "Larry Horton
[associate dean of students] will make
his decisions [on housing] with or
without student input," Harmatz
said.
The Nominations Committee chose
junior Roberta Bowman, senior
Robert Flynn and junior Thomas Ross
Perry to serve on the subcommittee.
