# State, Nation Vote Today; Democrats Expect Gains
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Candidates made their final pitches
and shook their last hands yesterday as
Californians prepared to vote today to
elect state officers and legislators,
congressmen and a United States
senator.
Polls in the state will be open from
7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and if the election
runs true to form, the first returns
should begin to trickle in shortly after
9. Democrats say they expect a
sizeable national victory in this first
post-Watergate test.
In the hottest electoral battle,
Democratic Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr. and Republican
state Controller Houston I. Flournoy
are vying to determine which of them
will succeed outgoing Republican Gov.
Ronald Reagan. According to the final
California Poll conducted last week,
Brown holds about an eight percent
lead.
Also on the ballot are chiropractor
Edmon V. Kaiser, nominee of the
American Independent Party, and
Peace and Freedom candidate
Elizabeth Keathley, a feminist author.
In the Senate race, freshman
incumbent Alan Cranston, a
Democrat, reportedly holds a wide
lead over Republican state Sen. H.L.
Richardson. The other candidates are
health worker Gayle Justice of the
Peace and Freedom Party and
contractor Jack McCoy of the
American Independent Party.
Republican Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger, the only incumbent state
officeholder seeking re-election, still
maintains a wide lead over Democratic
challenger William Norris, according to
the polls. However, Democrats are
reportedly leading in the races for all
other offices, and are predicting their
most successful year at the polls here
since 1958.
Lt. Gov. John Harmer, appointed

several weeks ago by Reagan after Ed
Reinecke's resignation, is fighting a
challenge by Democratic state Sen.
Mervyn Dymally.
GOP nominee Brian Van Camp,
former state corporations
commissioner, and Democratic
Assemblywoman March Fong are
seeking the secretary of state's office
being vacated by Brown, while
Republican Assemblyman William
Bagley and Democratic Assemblyman
Kenneth Cory are seeking Flournoy's
old controller's job.
In the campaign for treasurer,
Democratic nominee Jess Unruh, the
party's 1970 gubernatorial candidate,
and Republican John Kehoe, state
consumer affairs director, are trying to
succeed retiring Republican Ivy Baker
Priest.
Locally, incumbent U.S. Rep. Paul

N. McCloskey Jr., who was only
narrowly renominated in the June
Republican primary, appears to hold a
strong lead over Santa Clara Mayor
Gary Gillmor, the Democratic
nominee. Incumbent state Sen. Arlen
Gregorio, a Democrat, is also favored
over attorney James R. Tormey Jr.
In the race for the newly created
21st Assembly district seat, East Palo
Alto Municipal Councilman Clarence
A. Jackson Jr. has the Republican
nomination against Santa Clara
County Supervisor Victor Calvo, the
Democratic candidate.
Also on the ballot today are 17
state propositions including the
controversial one that would designate
the Stanislaus River as part of the state
wild and scenic rivers system and
yes-no elections for 10 state court
judges.
