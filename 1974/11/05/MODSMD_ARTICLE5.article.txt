# Willow Road Widening Approved In Long City Council Session
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
A proposal to widen Willow Road
to 90 feet and four lanes between San
Francisquito Creek and El Caraino
Real was approved 6-2 by the Palo
Alto City Council last night in a
marathon, five-hour session.
The plan, proposed by Councilman
Richard Rosenbaum and supported by
the University, is intended to reduce
congestion on Willow Road and
improve access to the Stanford
Shopping Center.
City assessments levied on
merchants benefiting from the

widening of the road will finance 90
percent of the project. The city will
pay for the rest.
Although the assessment would cost
the Stanford Shopping Center
merchants money, the University
assumes that increased business will
compensate for the loss, according to
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance.
Augsburger noted that another plan,
sponsored by Councilman Alan
Henderson, would have cost the
University at least $1.2 million and
caused great conflict between the city
and the University.
Henderson Plan
The Henderson plan called for a
60-foot widening of the road only
between San Francisquito Creek and
Arboretum Road. Under the
provisions of a 1968 agreement
between Stanford and Palo Alto, the
University would have carried the
major burden of paying for such an
extension of Willow Road.
The Henderson proposal received
the support of Henderson and
Councilwoman Enid Pearson, the ohly
two dissenters in the vote on
Rosenbaum's plan.
Under the Rosenbaum plan, the
University must construct at least two
lanes of Campus Drive from its present
terminus near the Medical Center to
connect with Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Construction 'Trigger'
But the plan in its original form

permitted the University to fulfill its
obligations "within a reasonable
time." The Council assumes that
construction will "be triggered by the
level of traffic on Willow Road or by
development of new facilities on
Stanford land in the vicinity of
Willow."
Councilwoman Enid Pearson
objected to the "reasonable time"
provision, claiming that the University
would probably indefinitely delay
construction of Campus Drive if
allowed to do so by the Council.
She moved that the Council refuse
to extend Willow Road until the
University completed Campus Drive.
"We have the ace," Pearson told the
Council. "Let's use it."
But Councilman John Beahrs
objected to Pearson's motion,
contending that it would "deliberately
harrass Stanford" at a time when the
University is experiencing financial
difficulties.
Pearson's amendment failed in a 6-2
vote, supported only by Pearson and
Henderson.
The issue was referred to the staff
and will be discussed again by the
Council later this year.
The Council agreed to instruct
engineers to construct the widening of
the road in such away "so as to
eliminate or minimize the loss of
trees" in the area of San Francisquito

assumes that increased business will
compensate for the loss, according to
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance.
Augsburger noted that another plan,
sponsored by Councilman Alan
Henderson, would have cost the
University at least $1.2 million and
caused great conflict between the city
and the University.
Henderson Plan
The Henderson plan called for a
60-foot widening of the road only
between San Francisquito Creek and
Arboretum Road. Under the
provisions of a 1968 agreement
between Stanford and Palo Alto, the
University would have carried the
major burden of paying for such an
extension of Willow Road.
The Henderson proposal received
the support of Henderson and
Councilwoman Enid Pearson, the ohly
two dissenters in the vote on
Rosenbaum's plan.
Under the Rosenbaum plan, the
University must construct at least two
lanes of Campus Drive from its present
terminus near the Medical Center to
connect with Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Construction 'Trigger'
But the plan in its original form

permitted the University to fulfill its
obligations "within a reasonable
time." The Council assumes that
construction will "be triggered by the
level of traffic on Willow Road or by
development of new facilities on
Stanford land in the vicinity of
Willow."
Councilwoman Enid Pearson
objected to the "reasonable time"
provision, claiming that the University
would probably indefinitely delay
construction of Campus Drive if
allowed to do so by the Council.
She moved that the Council refuse
to extend Willow Road until the
University completed Campus Drive.
"We have the ace," Pearson told the
Council. "Let's use it."
But Councilman John Beahrs
objected to Pearson's motion,
contending that it would "deliberately
harrass Stanford" at a time when the
University is experiencing financial
difficulties.
Pearson's amendment failed in a 6-2
vote, supported only by Pearson and
Henderson.
The issue was referred to the staff
and will be discussed again by the
Council later this year.
The Council agreed to instruct
engineers to construct the widening of
the road in such away "so as to
eliminate or minimize the loss of
trees" in the area of San Francisquito
Creek.
A proposal to widen Willow Road
to 90 feet and four lanes between San
Francisquito Creek and El Caraino
Real was approved 6-2 by the Palo
Alto City Council last night in a
marathon, five-hour session.
The plan, proposed by Councilman
Richard Rosenbaum and supported by
the University, is intended to reduce
congestion on Willow Road and
improve access to the Stanford
Shopping Center.
City assessments levied on
merchants benefiting from the

widening of the road will finance 90
percent of the project. The city will
pay for the rest.
Although the assessment would cost
the Stanford Shopping Center
merchants money, the University
assumes that increased business will
compensate for the loss, according to
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance.
