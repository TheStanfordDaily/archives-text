# Arena Resumes After Year Hiatus
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Stanford Arena, a conservative
publication which first appeared on
campus during the most intense period
of radical activism, resurfaced last
week after a one-year absence.
In an editorial in its first issue, the
Arena explained that its purpose is "to
provide another, differing perspective
of events on the campus and in the
nation."
Editor Bruce Smyth said last night
that the journal's goal is "purposely a
wide one," but emphasized that the
paper "does have a different point of
view from the other two major
publications on campus.
"It's going to be more
conservative," Smyth said, "but not
doctrinaire. That would be really
boring," he added.
'No Need'
But Daily Associate Editor Glenn
Garvin, who edited the Arena from
September until December 1972, said
yesterday: "I don't think there's a
need for a conservative publication on
campus anymore, and I don't think
much can be accomplished by a
newspaper that doesn't come out very
often."
Smyth said the new, four-page,
tabloid Arena will appear only twice
each quarter. "Basically, the time
involved in putting out an issue is the
reason we don't predict a greater
output," he added.
According to Smyth, there are "five
or six people whom I can count on for
definite contributions." In the past,
some Arena writers concealed their
identities by writing under
pseudonymns. Smyth said "we only
had. one pseudonymn in the first
issue," but added that each writer has

the option to use a pseudonymn.
The Arena's first issue included an
article about crime on campus in
recent years, as well as a preview of
today's state election.
Smyth said, "we're going to be a
newspaper, hitting some items that
neither the Daily nor Live Oak will
cover." Smyth added that the paper
will serve as "another forum for
campus opinion."
In its last year of publication, the
Arena carried a regular media column
which frequently contained sharp
attacks on the Daily. Smyth said, "I
don't think we'll be as critical of other
publications as past editors were.
Some of them were overly
preoccupied with the Daily."
Unknown Donors
The sources of the Arena's funding
have always presented a sticky
question for the publication's editors.
No one would reveal the identity of
these sources, and two of the last three
editors have claimed they don't even
know who the donors are.
Smyth said all he knew was that the
donors were "alumni and people
interested in Stanford." He added that
Hoover Institution Publications
Director Brien Benson, who edited the
Arena's first issues in 1968, handled all
donations. Benson could not be
reached for comment last night.
However, a Daily story last fall
revealed that former Stanford Trustee
David Packard had, at one time,
provided "substantial" financial
backing for the Arena.
Resume Donations
At the time, former Deputy Defense
Secretary Packard said he would
resume donations if there was renewed
interest in the publication. The Arena

folded because it had been unable to
locate a replacement for two-time
editor Chris Hocker. Hocker, now an
official of the San Mateo County
Republican organization, ran for
student body president in both 1971
and 1972, as did Smyth last April.
Asked last night whether Packard
was indeed giving money to the
Arena again, Smyth said, "I think he
may be, but I don't know. He is
donating money to the Stanford
Conservative Forum."
Smyth also maintained that, "while
I don't know who is donating the
money, I've gotten assurances from
Brien [Benson] that it's not coming
from any right-wing nut group."
