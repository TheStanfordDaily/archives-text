# Little Interest Shown Campus Voters
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Traditionally, voters show little interest in
"off-year" elections when no presidential
campaign is in progress. Today's elections will prove
no exception, experts say.
The Gallup Poll has reported that only 42 percent
of Americans have shown "a lot" or "some" interest
in today's voting. That indicator is generally a slight
overestimate of voter turnout.
A survey of 66 students randomly interviewed
over the last three days in White Plaza, Wilbur Hall
and Manzanita Park indicated that 46 percent of
undergraduates showed "a lot" or "some" interest
in the elections. Those who planned to vote
suggested various reasons why they would.
A male sophomore, registered out of state,
considered voting a solemn responsibility.
'Duty As Citizen'
"I think it is my duty as a citizen to vote. There
were some close races in my district," he related.
Some 77 percent of undergraduates in the Daily
survey are registered to vote, as opposed to 72

percent nationwide.
But half of those have registered at their homes,
rather than here, the Daily survey shows. The Santa
Clara County Voter Registrar's Office estimated
yesterday that just 5900 persons are registered to
vote in the 12 precincts on Stanford land.
"I haven't decided whether I'm going to vote,"
was a typical response voiced by a male sophomore.
"I read the stuff in the pamphlet, and some of it
seemed important like keeping tuition out of the
hands of the legislature. But the rest of it seemed
pretty trivial."
More Older Students
Interest in today's elections was higher among
older students. Just 30 percent of freshmen
interviewed planned to vote, while 67 percent of
seniors intended to cast ballots.
"Sure I'm going to vote," one female senior
commented. "I vote normally anyway. This year's
no different."
Few students were actively involved in political
campaigns. One undergraduate campaigner admitted

he knew little about other candidates.
"I'm voting because I feel it's a civic duty. I've
been involved with the [Alan] Cranston campaign,
but I don't know the issues in the other [races]. I
think [Arlen] Gregorio's a good man, too," he
commented without elaboration.
Congressional Campaign
The campaign between Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. and Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor was the
major reason one female sophomore decided to
vote.
"I'm voting because I want to make sure the right
people are elected. I want to vote against
McCloskey. He's changed since the primaries," she
remarked.
Undergraduate political affiliations lean to the
Democratic party or to independents. Only 18
percent of those questioned said they considered
themselves Republicans, while 46 percent stated
they were Democrats and 36 percent said they were
independent.

pretty trivial."
More Older Students
Interest in today's elections was higher among
older students. Just 30 percent of freshmen
interviewed planned to vote, while 67 percent of
seniors intended to cast ballots.
"Sure I'm going to vote," one female senior
commented. "I vote normally anyway. This year's
no different."
Few students were actively involved in political
campaigns. One undergraduate campaigner admitted

he knew little about other candidates.
"I'm voting because I feel it's a civic duty. I've
been involved with the [Alan] Cranston campaign,
but I don't know the issues in the other [races]. I
think [Arlen] Gregorio's a good man, too," he
commented without elaboration.
Congressional Campaign
The campaign between Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr. and Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor was the
major reason one female sophomore decided to
vote.
"I'm voting because I want to make sure the right
people are elected. I want to vote against
McCloskey. He's changed since the primaries," she
remarked.
Undergraduate political affiliations lean to the
Democratic party or to independents. Only 18
percent of those questioned said they considered
themselves Republicans, while 46 percent stated
they were Democrats and 36 percent said they were
independent.
Traditionally, voters show little interest in
"off-year" elections when no presidential
campaign is in progress. Today's elections will prove
no exception, experts say.
The Gallup Poll has reported that only 42 percent
of Americans have shown "a lot" or "some" interest
in today's voting. That indicator is generally a slight
overestimate of voter turnout.
A survey of 66 students randomly interviewed
over the last three days in White Plaza, Wilbur Hall
and Manzanita Park indicated that 46 percent of
undergraduates showed "a lot" or "some" interest
in the elections. Those who planned to vote
suggested various reasons why they would.
A male sophomore, registered out of state,
considered voting a solemn responsibility.
'Duty As Citizen'
"I think it is my duty as a citizen to vote. There
were some close races in my district," he related.
Some 77 percent of undergraduates in the Daily
survey are registered to vote, as opposed to 72

percent nationwide.
But half of those have registered at their homes,
rather than here, the Daily survey shows. The Santa
Clara County Voter Registrar's Office estimated
yesterday that just 5900 persons are registered to
vote in the 12 precincts on Stanford land.
"I haven't decided whether I'm going to vote,"
was a typical response voiced by a male sophomore.
"I read the stuff in the pamphlet, and some of it
seemed important like keeping tuition out of the
hands of the legislature. But the rest of it seemed
pretty trivial."
