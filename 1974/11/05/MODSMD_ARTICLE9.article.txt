# On GPA Inflation

### Bill Lubart 
In recent weeks, the Daily has
surprised and disturbed the
University community with a
series of articles on the "soaring"
grade point averages of
undergraduates.
To many, this seems to herald
a falling of standards and the
coming of an academic
apocalypse. One professor after
another has doggedly stepped
forward and assured the anxious
community that high grades are
not the standard in his classes. I
overheard one senior remark
yesterday, "I'm sure glad I'm
getting out before the backlash
hits."
To anybody who has been an
active participant in American
education during the past 10
years, the revelation could not
have been unexpected. It has been
pointed out that high grades are a
growing trend at prestigious
Eastern universities. In fact, well
over half of Harvard's graduating
class anually sallies forth cum
laude.
I personally observed the trend
over the course of six years as a
student at an eminent preparatory
school in the seventh grade, it
was necessary to grind for a "C,"
whereas by senior year, "A's"
were plentiful. The consequences
of this evolution were hardly
pernicious; college acceptances
arrived on April 15 as scheduled.
Cultural Factors
There are several cultural
forces which have contributed to
the evolving grading situation.
During the Vietnam era when our
campuses were fulminating with
dissent, professors were made to
feel they were somehow
misguided if they showed greater
dedication to pure academics than
to social and political issues.
The "Movement" was
manifestly against elitism in all its
forms egalitarianism was
extolled. In those years, it was
somehow embarrassing to speak
of "excellence" or standards.
Thus the levelling began.

As the war and the dissenters
dissipated, students withdrew into
a more egocentric reality. Given
the evils of the world, the

question * became: "How can I
assure myself a secure and
respected place in society?" The
product of this thinking has been
the compulsive pre-professional
ism which has infested
undergraduate classes in recent
years, and the crunch for grades
has never been greater.
College classes have at' times
seemed unbearable as students
bicker vociferously with the
professor over the wording or
grading of a particular
question.
Skyrocketing GPA
The skyrocketing national
grade point average has in large
part been a reaction on the part of
professors to the pressure which
students have exerted on them.
After all, they're employed to
instruct, not certify the future
professionals of America.
I contend that this
development is in many respects
quite healthy for our colleges. Not
only have students been
remarkably freer in recent years
to experiment with courses in
which they're less able, but as
they have become less paranoid,
cheating and pettiness have
dwindled in the classroom.
Those who are now concerned
about the difficulties that
graduate schools will have in
evaluating candidates are falling
into the trap; we must desist from
viewing every one of life's
experiences as a means to an end,
a rung on a ladder.
Probably Reaction
Very soon we will all feel the
predictable backlash as new
pressures are exerted on
professors, this time by their
colleagues. I recently received an
unexpected memo in the mail
informing me that in my transfer
seminar we will now have a final
exam a sudden turnabout
which, at this late date, I consider
a breech of contract.
If the faculty and students
would merely refrain from
panicking and allow the status
quo to settle a bit, we might
witness a true rebirth of the
liberal arts education in America.
