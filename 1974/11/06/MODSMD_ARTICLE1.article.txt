## 
### STEPHEN CARTER, DAVID SMITH KEVIN SMITH 
The Democratic Party scored the sweeping victories it
had been predicting in yesterday's national elections,
strengthening its grips on both the Congress and the state

houses.
The Democrats gained four "Senate seats, the usual
number for the party not in power, for a new margin of
62-38, and at least the 42 House seats needed for the

two-thirds majority they have been seeking. They also
picked up at least four governorships, improving on their

Democrat Richard Stone squeaked by Republican Jack

Dakota's Republican incumbent, Milton Young.
The Republicans picked up their only new seat in the
Senate as former Gov. Paul Laxalt won the Nevada battle
for retiring Democrat Alan Bible's seat. Laxalt defeated
Democratic Lt. Gov. Harry Reid.
In other close races, the only Democrats considered in
trouble, South Dakota's 1972 Presidential candidate George
McGovern, Indiana's Birch Bayh and Alaska's Mike Gravel,
all won re-election. In another key battle, New York's
