# Demos Score National Gains
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER, DAVID SMITH KEVIN SMITH 
The Democratic Party scored the sweeping victories it
had been predicting in yesterday's national elections,
strengthening its grips on both the Congress and the state

houses.
The Democrats gained four "Senate seats, the usual
number for the party not in power, for a new margin of
62-38, and at least the 42 House seats needed for the

two-thirds majority they have been seeking. They also
picked up at least four governorships, improving on their
current 32-18 margin.
The Democrats picked up formerly Republican Senate
seats in Colorado, Kentucky, Vermont, Florida and North
Dakota. The Republicans gained a formerly Democratic
seat in Nevada.
In Colorado, former McGovern Campaign Director Gary.
Hart defeated two-term incumbent

Peter Dominick by a decisive margin.
Democratic Gov. Wendell Ford
unseated Kentucky's incumbent
senator, Marlow Cook.
In a stunning upset in Vermont,
Democrat Patrick Leahy won the seat

vacated by Republican Sen. George Aiken's retirement, as
voter turnout slipped by some 27 percent over 1972. This
seat had been considered a sure bet for the Republicans and
Leahy will be .Vermont's first Democratic senator in 120
years.
In the Florida race for Sen. Edward Gumey's seat,
Democrat Richard Stone squeaked by Republican Jack
Eckerd. Gurney did not seek re-election because he is under
indictment for bribery and perjury.
In a close battle, William Guy held on to edge North
Dakota's Republican incumbent, Milton Young.
The Republicans picked up their only new seat in the
Senate as former Gov. Paul Laxalt won the Nevada battle
for retiring Democrat Alan Bible's seat. Laxalt defeated
Democratic Lt. Gov. Harry Reid.
In other close races, the only Democrats considered in
trouble, South Dakota's 1972 Presidential candidate George
McGovern, Indiana's Birch Bayh and Alaska's Mike Gravel,
all won re-election. In another key battle, New York's

Republican incumbent, Jacob Javits, held off an
unexpectedly strong challenge from former Atty. General
Ramsey Clark.
Former Republican National Chairman and incumbent
Sen. Robert Dole won an uphill battle against Democratic
Rep. William Roy in Kansas. Dole, who had trailed in the
polls as recently as last week, had widely been presumed a
"victim of Watergate."
In the House of Representatives, the Democratic gain of
nearly 50 seats gave the party more than two-thirds of the
total seats in the House.
Perhaps t the most striking aspect of this year's
congressional election was the defeat of five of the
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, which
conducted the impeachment investigation against former
President Richard M. Nixon.
Among those five Republicans, four were strong
supporters of Nixon's position during the committee
debates and originally- voted against impeachment on all
articles. These included Representatives Charles W.
Sandman Jr. and Joseph Maraziti of New Jersey, Rep.
David Dennis of Indiana and Rep. Wiley Mayne of lowa.
The fifth committee Republican to suffer defeat, Rep.
Harold Froehlich of Wisconsin. v oted for two articles of
impeachment. '
Republicans suffered most in na and New Jersey,
losing five seats to the Democrats ... h state.
Rep. Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.), chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, turned back his first challenge
in many years with 54 percent of the vote.
Three more women will enter the House during the next

session, all on the Democratic side of the aisle. Helen
Meyner, wife of former New Jersey Gov. Robert Meyner,
ousted Maraziti, while Marilyn Lloyd defeated veteran
incumbent LaMar Baker (R-Tenn.). The third woman,
Martha Keys, picked up a vacant seat in Kansas.
All 16 members of the Congressional Black Caucus won
re-election and an additional black state Rep. Harold E.
Ford of Tennessee, joined Congress by defeating incumbent
Dan Kuykendall.
The Democrats won nine governorships away from the
GOP but lost control of at least two others. After
yesterday's winners take office, there will be at least 36
Democratic governors, a net increase of four, and the
Democrats hoped to retain three other posts.
In Ohio, Democratic incumbent John Gilligan slightly
trailed former Gov. James Rhodes, according to late results.
Gubernatorial races in Kansas and Alaska, which now have
Democratic governors, also remained too close to call.
Brooklyn Rep. Hugh Carey in New York and former
state Rep. Michael Dukakis in Massachusetts were relatively
easy winners over Republican incumbents Malcolm Wilson
and Francis Sargent.
The only trend-reversing Republican sure to win a
governorship from the Democrats was James Edwards, who
will become South Carolina's first GOP governor since
1876.
Key Democratic winners included Connecticut's Ella
Grasso, the first woman to win a governorship never
previously held by her husband, and Tennessee's Ray
Blanton, who beat former Nixon aide Lamar Alexander.
Both captured previously Republican posts, as did
candidates in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon and Wyoming.

Perhaps t the most striking aspect of this year's
congressional election was the defeat of five of the
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, which
conducted the impeachment investigation against former
President Richard M. Nixon.
Among those five Republicans, four were strong
supporters of Nixon's position during the committee
debates and originally- voted against impeachment on all
articles. These included Representatives Charles W.
Sandman Jr. and Joseph Maraziti of New Jersey, Rep.
David Dennis of Indiana and Rep. Wiley Mayne of lowa.

Martha Keys, picked up a vacant seat in Kansas.
All 16 members of the Congressional Black Caucus won
re-election and an additional black state Rep. Harold E.
Ford of Tennessee, joined Congress by defeating incumbent
Dan Kuykendall.
The Democrats won nine governorships away from the
GOP but lost control of at least two others. After
yesterday's winners take office, there will be at least 36
Democratic governors, a net increase of four, and the
Democrats hoped to retain three other posts.
In Ohio, Democratic incumbent John Gilligan slightly
trailed former Gov. James Rhodes, according to late results.

Democratic governors, also remained too close to call.
Brooklyn Rep. Hugh Carey in New York and former

easy winners over Republican incumbents Malcolm Wilson

governorship from the Democrats was James Edwards, who
will become South Carolina's first GOP governor since
1876.
Key Democratic winners included Connecticut's Ella
Grasso, the first woman to win a governorship never
previously held by her husband, and Tennessee's Ray
Blanton, who beat former Nixon aide Lamar Alexander.

candidates in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon and Wyoming.
The Democratic Party scored the sweeping victories it
had been predicting in yesterday's national elections,
strengthening its grips on both the Congress and the state

houses.
The Democrats gained four "Senate seats, the usual
number for the party not in power, for a new margin of
62-38, and at least the 42 House seats needed for the

two-thirds majority they have been seeking. They also
picked up at least four governorships, improving on their
current 32-18 margin.

vacated by Republican Sen. George Aiken's retirement, as
voter turnout slipped by some 27 percent over 1972. This
seat had been considered a sure bet for the Republicans and
Leahy will be .Vermont's first Democratic senator in 120
years.

had been predicting in yesterday's national elections,
strengthening its grips on both the Congress and the state

houses.
The Democrats gained four "Senate seats, the usual
number for the party not in power, for a new margin of
62-38, and at least the 42 House seats needed for the

two-thirds majority they have been seeking. They also
picked up at least four governorships, improving on their
current 32-18 margin.
The Democrats picked up formerly Republican Senate
seats in Colorado, Kentucky, Vermont, Florida and North

Peter Dominick by a decisive margin.
Democratic Gov. Wendell Ford
unseated Kentucky's incumbent
senator, Marlow Cook.
In a stunning upset in Vermont,
Democrat Patrick Leahy won the seat

vacated by Republican Sen. George Aiken's retirement, as
voter turnout slipped by some 27 percent over 1972. This
seat had been considered a sure bet for the Republicans and
Leahy will be .Vermont's first Democratic senator in 120
years.
In the Florida race for Sen. Edward Gumey's seat,
Democrat Richard Stone squeaked by Republican Jack
Eckerd. Gurney did not seek re-election because he is under

unexpectedly strong challenge from former Atty. General
Ramsey Clark.
Former Republican National Chairman and incumbent
Sen. Robert Dole won an uphill battle against Democratic
Rep. William Roy in Kansas. Dole, who had trailed in the
polls as recently as last week, had widely been presumed a
"victim of Watergate."
In the House of Representatives, the Democratic gain of
nearly 50 seats gave the party more than two-thirds of the
total seats in the House.
Perhaps t the most striking aspect of this year's
congressional election was the defeat of five of the
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, which
conducted the impeachment investigation against former
President Richard M. Nixon.
Among those five Republicans, four were strong
supporters of Nixon's position during the committee
debates and originally- voted against impeachment on all
articles. These included Representatives Charles W.
Sandman Jr. and Joseph Maraziti of New Jersey, Rep.
David Dennis of Indiana and Rep. Wiley Mayne of lowa.

session, all on the Democratic side of the aisle. Helen

Martha Keys, picked up a vacant seat in Kansas.
All 16 members of the Congressional Black Caucus won
re-election and an additional black state Rep. Harold E.
Ford of Tennessee, joined Congress by defeating incumbent
Dan Kuykendall.
The Democrats won nine governorships away from the
GOP but lost control of at least two others. After
yesterday's winners take office, there will be at least 36
Democratic governors, a net increase of four, and the
Democrats hoped to retain three other posts.
In Ohio, Democratic incumbent John Gilligan slightly
trailed former Gov. James Rhodes, according to late results.
Gubernatorial races in Kansas and Alaska, which now have
Democratic governors, also remained too close to call.
Brooklyn Rep. Hugh Carey in New York and former
state Rep. Michael Dukakis in Massachusetts were relatively
easy winners over Republican incumbents Malcolm Wilson
and Francis Sargent.
The only trend-reversing Republican sure to win a
governorship from the Democrats was James Edwards, who
will become South Carolina's first GOP governor since
1876.
Key Democratic winners included Connecticut's Ella
Grasso, the first woman to win a governorship never
previously held by her husband, and Tennessee's Ray
Blanton, who beat former Nixon aide Lamar Alexander.
Both captured previously Republican posts, as did
candidates in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon and Wyoming.
