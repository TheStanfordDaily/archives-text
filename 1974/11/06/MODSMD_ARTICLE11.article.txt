## Shared Methods, Differing Temperaments Chace, Kennedy Reflect On 20th Century America 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
It is still early morning when
the first student walks into
ancient Cubberley Auditorium.
Class won't start for at least 20
minutes, but the student pulls off
his jacket and collapses in a seat
near the front of the hall.
The auditorium with its dirty
beige walls is no escape from the
bleak skies outside. The square
lights integrated with rusty
sprinkler heads on the ceiling
provide evep less light than there
is outdoors.
Another student walks into the
auditorium and then three more
and then another two. They
shuffle almost aimlessly down the
two aisles, finding their seats
accidently.
The noise increases as the room
fills with warm bodies, and
suddenly from out of the crowd
two energetic actors step onto the
stage: Assoc. English Prof. William
Chace and Assoc. History Prof.
David Kennedy.
The course has been called the
class of the century. However,
both professors agree that the
title, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century," is a
misnomer.
"We did annouce the first day
that a better name for the course
would be 'Reflections On The
American Condition In The 20th
Century,' " Kennedy says. "But
even that is a bit grand after all."
"There's an enormous amount
we can't touch," Chace admits.
"Our course centers on the
readings, most of them classic
statements of what it was like to
be an American."
10 Books
The 10 books for the course
include An American Tragedy by
Theodore Dreiser, The Education
of Henry Adams by Henry Adams
and Native Son by Richard
Wright. The theme of the course
seems to be American
self-consciousness.
The class is being offered for
the first time this quarter to

"elicit and gauge student interest in
an American Studies program,"
says Kennedy.
One goal, he says, is to set up a
program similar to the Humanities
Honors Program, perhaps within
the next two years.
Chace and Kennedy alternate
lectures Monday and Wednesday
mornings. On Thursdays, they
give what is best described by one
student as "a question-answer
lecture."
Thorough Answers
Students send in written
questions and the professors
prepare answers to them.
However, some students complain
the answers are usually so
thorough and long that the profs
only have time for two or three
questions.
"Exchange of dialogue between
students and professors is always a
problem in large lecture classes,"
says Kennedy. "We'd like to take
more questions from the floor but
an awful lot of questions may not
be interesting to the entire class."
Other students complain that
the Thursday period is usually a
"rehash" of what has already been
discussed. To spice up the
proceedings, they say, the
professors should argue back and
forth more.
"They never argue they're
too civilized," says one student.
Slightly Embarrassed
Chace and Kennedy say they
are surprised and even "slightly
embarrassed" that they don't
disagree more.
"We both just have a great
capacity for putting up with one
another," Chace says.
While agreeing they should
probably argue more, he warns
that "the art" in arguing "is what
profit you can make out of it for
the students. The danger is just
bickering."
Even though the two profs
don't argue much, they do have
differences.
"We expected that our big
difference would be

methodological, that there would
be more difference in emphasis
between the historical approach as
opposed to the literary approach
to questions," says Kennedy.
Temperamental Difference
Instead, he says, big
difference is "temperamental.
Chace is far more pessimistic than
I am ... more drawn to those
authors that take a more
pessimistic stand and less
enamored with those books that
try to find a little ray of light in
all this gloom."
Chace agrees, but speaks of
more philosophical differences
between them:
"David sees his situation more
amenable to change. He perhaps

sees himself as a good and
patriotic American. I don't mean
simplistic patriot. He is responsive
to the very best aspirations of this
country and he is judging his
behavior in terms of how well he
lives up to the expectations of his
country.
'Huckleberry Finn'
"I guess I could sum up my
position by saying I'm more of a
Huckleberry Finn. I've always
enjoyed the freedom and
liberties" represented by "the
critical dissociative example that
Huckleberry Finn provides."
What do the two profs argue
about most? Chace says it's the
3.55 grade point average that the
typical undergraduate at Stanford

receives.
"You take some of the nation's
best, and they're getting the best
grades," says Chace. "What do
you expect? Give them bad
grades? Of course they're going
to get good grades. They work
hard."
Brutal Grades
But Kennedy, who is known as
a brutal grader by many students,
says, "It won't do to say that all
their abilities are virtually equal
and the average grade point that's
clustered right at the top of the
scale accurately measures the
differences between them.
"We need to utilize the whole
grade spectrum ... to give a
visible public signal to the student
about how his work stands up in

relation to other students'. And to
give a signal to someone else
someday who reads the transcript
to get an idea of a given person's
relative ability."
Chace and Kennedy haven't
resolved this difference about
grading systems, and maybe they
won't resolve it until they start
turning in grades to the registrar's
office.
Lecture Styles
To students perhaps the most
noticeable difference between
Chace and Kennedy is their
lecture styles.
Kennedy dresses in sharp
three-piece suits: usually a bright
blue jacket, matching slacks,
white shirt and tie. But he doesn't
show off his clothes. He gives his
lectures from behind the podium,
taking cues from his "very
extensive" notes.
He is always moving his hands
now adjusting his glasses, now
tucking in his shirt, now
straightening his tie and finally
waving one hand in front of
himself to add emphasis to a
point.
Kennedy is more dogmatic in
his lectures than his counterpart,
but like Chace he is very
organized.
Generalization
"As a historian," says Kennedy,
"I deal in grosser commodities,
less concerned with trapping an
idea in language, more with
shaping big outlines and talking
about things with a certain level
of generalization."
And Chace? In his brown suede
jacket, flaired brown pants and
moccasin-like loafers, Chace
doesn't look like a lecturer.
However, standing straight on
stage, pacing to and fro with the
light shining off his high dome
forehead and gold-rimmed glasses,
he is not easily missed.
He usually reads his lectures
from a yellow pad, occasionally
pausing to dramatically quote such
notables as Aristotle. Sometimes
he stares at his feet; other times

he gazes at the auditorium
balcony.
No Soapbox
Chace says he's dramatic on
purpose. "You've got to make the
student feel the 50 minutes is
endurable," he explains. "I don't
think I should be soapboxing, or
delivering a harangue. I just try to
give a pleasing lecture."
With more than 300 students
showing up for every lecture, it's
clear that someone thinks that
Chace and Kennedy are doing
their job well.
The class period comes to a
close. From behind the podium,
Kennedy is wrapping up his
answer to a student's question.
Most of the audience is scribbling
down his remarks in their
notebooks, but a few students in
the back of the room are dozing
off, reading a newspaper or
opening mail.
When Kennedy is done, Chace,
who has been standing in the
center of the stage listening, turns
to the crowd.
"We have received one more
question," he says, staring off at
the ceiling lights. "Why do you
use such big words all the time?
It's very hard to understand you."
Part of the class starts to laugh;
part of the class hisses.
"I have been asked to respond
to this question dealing with our
alleged polysyllabism," Chace
begins.
More laughter.
'7 am at once reminded of a
quote from Winnie The Pooh. 7
am a bear of very little brain and
long words bother me.' "
Still more laughter.
"When complexity meets with
complexity in this class," he adds,
"it is our duty to choose the
concise word that can best resolve
the problem. . . In our
pedogogical dispositions, we've
always sought to denominate a
spade a spade.
"In short," he finishes, "We
change not. You must."
Applause.

the students. The danger is just
bickering."
Even though the two profs
don't argue much, they do have
differences.
"We expected that our big
difference would be

methodological, that there would
be more difference in emphasis
between the historical approach as
opposed to the literary approach
to questions," says Kennedy.
Temperamental Difference
Instead, he says, big
difference is "temperamental.
Chace is far more pessimistic than
I am ... more drawn to those
authors that take a more
pessimistic stand and less
enamored with those books that
try to find a little ray of light in
all this gloom."
Chace agrees, but speaks of
more philosophical differences
between them:
"David sees his situation more
amenable to change. He perhaps

sees himself as a good and
patriotic American. I don't mean
simplistic patriot. He is responsive
to the very best aspirations of this
country and he is judging his
behavior in terms of how well he
lives up to the expectations of his
country.
'Huckleberry Finn'
"I guess I could sum up my
position by saying I'm more of a
Huckleberry Finn. I've always
enjoyed the freedom and
liberties" represented by "the
critical dissociative example that
Huckleberry Finn provides."
What do the two profs argue
about most? Chace says it's the
3.55 grade point average that the
typical undergraduate at Stanford

receives.
"You take some of the nation's
best, and they're getting the best
grades," says Chace. "What do
you expect? Give them bad
grades? Of course they're going
to get good grades. They work
hard."
Brutal Grades
But Kennedy, who is known as
a brutal grader by many students,
says, "It won't do to say that all
their abilities are virtually equal
and the average grade point that's
clustered right at the top of the
scale accurately measures the
differences between them.
"We need to utilize the whole
grade spectrum ... to give a
visible public signal to the student
about how his work stands up in

relation to other students'. And to
give a signal to someone else
someday who reads the transcript
to get an idea of a given person's
relative ability."
Chace and Kennedy haven't
resolved this difference about
grading systems, and maybe they
won't resolve it until they start
turning in grades to the registrar's
office.
Lecture Styles
To students perhaps the most
noticeable difference between
Chace and Kennedy is their
lecture styles.
Kennedy dresses in sharp
three-piece suits: usually a bright
blue jacket, matching slacks,
white shirt and tie. But he doesn't
show off his clothes. He gives his
lectures from behind the podium,
taking cues from his "very
extensive" notes.
He is always moving his hands
now adjusting his glasses, now
tucking in his shirt, now
straightening his tie and finally
waving one hand in front of
himself to add emphasis to a
point.
Kennedy is more dogmatic in
his lectures than his counterpart,
but like Chace he is very
organized.
Generalization
"As a historian," says Kennedy,
"I deal in grosser commodities,
less concerned with trapping an
idea in language, more with
shaping big outlines and talking
about things with a certain level
of generalization."
And Chace? In his brown suede
jacket, flaired brown pants and
moccasin-like loafers, Chace
doesn't look like a lecturer.
However, standing straight on
stage, pacing to and fro with the
light shining off his high dome
forehead and gold-rimmed glasses,
he is not easily missed.
He usually reads his lectures
from a yellow pad, occasionally
pausing to dramatically quote such
notables as Aristotle. Sometimes
he stares at his feet; other times

he gazes at the auditorium
balcony.
No Soapbox
Chace says he's dramatic on
purpose. "You've got to make the
student feel the 50 minutes is
endurable," he explains. "I don't
think I should be soapboxing, or
delivering a harangue. I just try to
give a pleasing lecture."
With more than 300 students
showing up for every lecture, it's
clear that someone thinks that
Chace and Kennedy are doing
their job well.
The class period comes to a
close. From behind the podium,
Kennedy is wrapping up his
answer to a student's question.
Most of the audience is scribbling
down his remarks in their
notebooks, but a few students in
the back of the room are dozing
off, reading a newspaper or
opening mail.
When Kennedy is done, Chace,
who has been standing in the
center of the stage listening, turns
to the crowd.
"We have received one more
question," he says, staring off at
the ceiling lights. "Why do you
use such big words all the time?
It's very hard to understand you."
Part of the class starts to laugh;
part of the class hisses.
"I have been asked to respond
to this question dealing with our
alleged polysyllabism," Chace
begins.
More laughter.
'7 am at once reminded of a
quote from Winnie The Pooh. 7
am a bear of very little brain and
long words bother me.' "
Still more laughter.
"When complexity meets with
complexity in this class," he adds,
"it is our duty to choose the
concise word that can best resolve
the problem. . . In our
pedogogical dispositions, we've
always sought to denominate a
spade a spade.
"In short," he finishes, "We
change not. You must."
Applause.

DYNAMIC DUOâ€”Assoc. English Prof. William Chace (1.) and Assoc. History Prof. David Kennedy share the
task of teaching what some students consider to be the class of the century, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century." While Kennedy is considered to be one of the most demanding profs on campus, Chace
likens himself to Huckleberry Finn but such philosophical differences don't result in much in-class
disagreement.
It is still early morning when
the first student walks into
ancient Cubberley Auditorium.
Class won't start for at least 20
minutes, but the student pulls off
his jacket and collapses in a seat
near the front of the hall.
The auditorium with its dirty
beige walls is no escape from the
bleak skies outside. The square
lights integrated with rusty
sprinkler heads on the ceiling
provide evep less light than there
is outdoors.
Another student walks into the
auditorium and then three more
and then another two. They
shuffle almost aimlessly down the
two aisles, finding their seats
accidently.
The noise increases as the room
fills with warm bodies, and
suddenly from out of the crowd
two energetic actors step onto the
stage: Assoc. English Prof. William
Chace and Assoc. History Prof.
David Kennedy.
The course has been called the
class of the century. However,
both professors agree that the
title, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century," is a
misnomer.
"We did annouce the first day
that a better name for the course
would be 'Reflections On The
American Condition In The 20th
Century,' " Kennedy says. "But
even that is a bit grand after all."
"There's an enormous amount
we can't touch," Chace admits.
"Our course centers on the
readings, most of them classic
statements of what it was like to
be an American."
10 Books
The 10 books for the course
include An American Tragedy by
Theodore Dreiser, The Education
of Henry Adams by Henry Adams
and Native Son by Richard
Wright. The theme of the course
seems to be American
self-consciousness.
The class is being offered for
the first time this quarter to

"elicit and gauge student interest in
an American Studies program,"
says Kennedy.
One goal, he says, is to set up a
program similar to the Humanities
Honors Program, perhaps within
the next two years.
Chace and Kennedy alternate
lectures Monday and Wednesday
mornings. On Thursdays, they
give what is best described by one
student as "a question-answer
lecture."
Thorough Answers
Students send in written
questions and the professors
prepare answers to them.
However, some students complain
the answers are usually so
thorough and long that the profs
only have time for two or three
questions.
"Exchange of dialogue between
students and professors is always a
problem in large lecture classes,"
says Kennedy. "We'd like to take
more questions from the floor but
an awful lot of questions may not
be interesting to the entire class."
Other students complain that
the Thursday period is usually a
"rehash" of what has already been
discussed. To spice up the
proceedings, they say, the
professors should argue back and
forth more.
"They never argue they're
too civilized," says one student.
Slightly Embarrassed
Chace and Kennedy say they
are surprised and even "slightly
embarrassed" that they don't
disagree more.
"We both just have a great
capacity for putting up with one
another," Chace says.
While agreeing they should
probably argue more, he warns
that "the art" in arguing "is what
profit you can make out of it for
the students. The danger is just
bickering."
Even though the two profs
don't argue much, they do have
differences.

about things with a certain level
of generalization."
And Chace? In his brown suede
jacket, flaired brown pants and
moccasin-like loafers, Chace
doesn't look like a lecturer.
However, standing straight on
stage, pacing to and fro with the
light shining off his high dome
forehead and gold-rimmed glasses,
he is not easily missed.
He usually reads his lectures
from a yellow pad, occasionally
pausing to dramatically quote such
notables as Aristotle. Sometimes
he stares at his feet; other times

he gazes at the auditorium
balcony.
No Soapbox
Chace says he's dramatic on
purpose. "You've got to make the
student feel the 50 minutes is
endurable," he explains. "I don't
think I should be soapboxing, or
delivering a harangue. I just try to
give a pleasing lecture."
With more than 300 students
showing up for every lecture, it's
clear that someone thinks that
Chace and Kennedy are doing
their job well.
The class period comes to a
close. From behind the podium,
Kennedy is wrapping up his
answer to a student's question.
Most of the audience is scribbling
down his remarks in their
notebooks, but a few students in
the back of the room are dozing
off, reading a newspaper or
opening mail.
When Kennedy is done, Chace,
who has been standing in the
center of the stage listening, turns
to the crowd.
"We have received one more
question," he says, staring off at
the ceiling lights. "Why do you
use such big words all the time?
It's very hard to understand you."
Part of the class starts to laugh;
part of the class hisses.
"I have been asked to respond
to this question dealing with our
alleged polysyllabism," Chace
begins.
More laughter.
'7 am at once reminded of a
quote from Winnie The Pooh. 7
am a bear of very little brain and
long words bother me.' "
Still more laughter.
"When complexity meets with
complexity in this class," he adds,
"it is our duty to choose the
concise word that can best resolve
the problem. . . In our
pedogogical dispositions, we've
always sought to denominate a
spade a spade.
"In short," he finishes, "We
change not. You must."
Applause.

DYNAMIC DUOâ€”Assoc. English Prof. William Chace (1.) and Assoc. History Prof. David Kennedy share the
task of teaching what some students consider to be the class of the century, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century." While Kennedy is considered to be one of the most demanding profs on campus, Chace
likens himself to Huckleberry Finn but such philosophical differences don't result in much in-class
disagreement.
It is still early morning when
the first student walks into
ancient Cubberley Auditorium.
Class won't start for at least 20
minutes, but the student pulls off
his jacket and collapses in a seat
near the front of the hall.
The auditorium with its dirty
beige walls is no escape from the
bleak skies outside. The square
lights integrated with rusty
sprinkler heads on the ceiling
provide evep less light than there
is outdoors.
Another student walks into the
auditorium and then three more
and then another two. They
shuffle almost aimlessly down the
two aisles, finding their seats
accidently.
The noise increases as the room
fills with warm bodies, and
suddenly from out of the crowd
two energetic actors step onto the
stage: Assoc. English Prof. William
Chace and Assoc. History Prof.
David Kennedy.
The course has been called the
class of the century. However,
both professors agree that the
title, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century," is a
misnomer.
"We did annouce the first day
that a better name for the course
would be 'Reflections On The
American Condition In The 20th
Century,' " Kennedy says. "But
even that is a bit grand after all."
"There's an enormous amount
we can't touch," Chace admits.
"Our course centers on the
readings, most of them classic
statements of what it was like to
be an American."
10 Books
The 10 books for the course
include An American Tragedy by
Theodore Dreiser, The Education
of Henry Adams by Henry Adams
and Native Son by Richard
Wright. The theme of the course
seems to be American
self-consciousness.
The class is being offered for
the first time this quarter to

"elicit and gauge student interest in
an American Studies program,"
says Kennedy.
One goal, he says, is to set up a
program similar to the Humanities
Honors Program, perhaps within
the next two years.
Chace and Kennedy alternate
lectures Monday and Wednesday
mornings. On Thursdays, they
give what is best described by one
student as "a question-answer
lecture."
Thorough Answers
Students send in written
questions and the professors
prepare answers to them.
However, some students complain
the answers are usually so
thorough and long that the profs
only have time for two or three
questions.
"Exchange of dialogue between
students and professors is always a
problem in large lecture classes,"
says Kennedy. "We'd like to take
more questions from the floor but
an awful lot of questions may not
be interesting to the entire class."
Other students complain that
the Thursday period is usually a
"rehash" of what has already been
discussed. To spice up the
proceedings, they say, the
professors should argue back and
forth more.
"They never argue they're
too civilized," says one student.
Slightly Embarrassed
Chace and Kennedy say they
are surprised and even "slightly
embarrassed" that they don't
disagree more.
"We both just have a great
capacity for putting up with one
another," Chace says.
While agreeing they should
probably argue more, he warns
that "the art" in arguing "is what
profit you can make out of it for
the students. The danger is just
bickering."
Even though the two profs
don't argue much, they do have
differences.
"We expected that our big
difference would be

methodological, that there would
be more difference in emphasis
between the historical approach as
opposed to the literary approach
to questions," says Kennedy.
Temperamental Difference
Instead, he says, big
difference is "temperamental.
Chace is far more pessimistic than
I am ... more drawn to those
authors that take a more
pessimistic stand and less
enamored with those books that
try to find a little ray of light in
all this gloom."
Chace agrees, but speaks of
more philosophical differences
between them:
"David sees his situation more
amenable to change. He perhaps

sees himself as a good and
patriotic American. I don't mean
simplistic patriot. He is responsive
to the very best aspirations of this
country and he is judging his
behavior in terms of how well he
lives up to the expectations of his
country.
'Huckleberry Finn'
"I guess I could sum up my
position by saying I'm more of a
Huckleberry Finn. I've always
enjoyed the freedom and
liberties" represented by "the
critical dissociative example that
Huckleberry Finn provides."
What do the two profs argue
about most? Chace says it's the
3.55 grade point average that the
typical undergraduate at Stanford

receives.
"You take some of the nation's
best, and they're getting the best
grades," says Chace. "What do
you expect? Give them bad
grades? Of course they're going
to get good grades. They work
hard."
Brutal Grades
But Kennedy, who is known as
a brutal grader by many students,
says, "It won't do to say that all
their abilities are virtually equal
and the average grade point that's
clustered right at the top of the
scale accurately measures the
differences between them.
"We need to utilize the whole
grade spectrum ... to give a
visible public signal to the student
about how his work stands up in

relation to other students'. And to
give a signal to someone else
someday who reads the transcript
to get an idea of a given person's
relative ability."
Chace and Kennedy haven't
resolved this difference about
grading systems, and maybe they
won't resolve it until they start
turning in grades to the registrar's
office.
Lecture Styles
To students perhaps the most
noticeable difference between
Chace and Kennedy is their
lecture styles.
Kennedy dresses in sharp
three-piece suits: usually a bright
blue jacket, matching slacks,
white shirt and tie. But he doesn't
show off his clothes. He gives his
lectures from behind the podium,
taking cues from his "very
extensive" notes.
He is always moving his hands
now adjusting his glasses, now
tucking in his shirt, now
straightening his tie and finally
waving one hand in front of
himself to add emphasis to a
point.
Kennedy is more dogmatic in
his lectures than his counterpart,
but like Chace he is very
organized.
Generalization
"As a historian," says Kennedy,
"I deal in grosser commodities,
less concerned with trapping an
idea in language, more with
shaping big outlines and talking
about things with a certain level
of generalization."
And Chace? In his brown suede
jacket, flaired brown pants and
moccasin-like loafers, Chace
doesn't look like a lecturer.
However, standing straight on
stage, pacing to and fro with the
light shining off his high dome

and then another two. They
shuffle almost aimlessly down the
two aisles, finding their seats
accidently.
The noise increases as the room
fills with warm bodies, and
suddenly from out of the crowd
two energetic actors step onto the
stage: Assoc. English Prof. William
Chace and Assoc. History Prof.
David Kennedy.
The course has been called the
class of the century. However,
both professors agree that the
title, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century," is a
misnomer.
"We did annouce the first day
that a better name for the course
would be 'Reflections On The
American Condition In The 20th
Century,' " Kennedy says. "But
even that is a bit grand after all."
"There's an enormous amount
we can't touch," Chace admits.
"Our course centers on the
readings, most of them classic
statements of what it was like to
be an American."
10 Books
The 10 books for the course
include An American Tragedy by
Theodore Dreiser, The Education
of Henry Adams by Henry Adams
and Native Son by Richard
Wright. The theme of the course
seems to be American
self-consciousness.
The class is being offered for
the first time this quarter to

"elicit and gauge student interest in
an American Studies program,"
says Kennedy.
One goal, he says, is to set up a
program similar to the Humanities
Honors Program, perhaps within
the next two years.
Chace and Kennedy alternate
lectures Monday and Wednesday
mornings. On Thursdays, they
give what is best described by one
student as "a question-answer
lecture."
Thorough Answers
Students send in written
questions and the professors
prepare answers to them.
However, some students complain
the answers are usually so
thorough and long that the profs
only have time for two or three
questions.
"Exchange of dialogue between
students and professors is always a
problem in large lecture classes,"
says Kennedy. "We'd like to take
more questions from the floor but
an awful lot of questions may not
be interesting to the entire class."
Other students complain that
the Thursday period is usually a
"rehash" of what has already been
discussed. To spice up the
proceedings, they say, the
professors should argue back and
forth more.
"They never argue they're
too civilized," says one student.
Slightly Embarrassed
Chace and Kennedy say they
are surprised and even "slightly
embarrassed" that they don't
disagree more.
"We both just have a great
capacity for putting up with one
another," Chace says.
While agreeing they should
probably argue more, he warns
that "the art" in arguing "is what
profit you can make out of it for
the students. The danger is just
bickering."
Even though the two profs
don't argue much, they do have
differences.
"We expected that our big
difference would be

methodological, that there would
be more difference in emphasis
between the historical approach as
opposed to the literary approach
to questions," says Kennedy.
Temperamental Difference
Instead, he says, big
difference is "temperamental.
Chace is far more pessimistic than
I am ... more drawn to those
authors that take a more
pessimistic stand and less
enamored with those books that
try to find a little ray of light in
all this gloom."
Chace agrees, but speaks of
more philosophical differences
between them:
"David sees his situation more
amenable to change. He perhaps

sees himself as a good and
patriotic American. I don't mean
simplistic patriot. He is responsive
to the very best aspirations of this
country and he is judging his
behavior in terms of how well he
lives up to the expectations of his
country.
'Huckleberry Finn'
"I guess I could sum up my
position by saying I'm more of a
Huckleberry Finn. I've always
enjoyed the freedom and
liberties" represented by "the
critical dissociative example that
Huckleberry Finn provides."
What do the two profs argue
about most? Chace says it's the
3.55 grade point average that the
typical undergraduate at Stanford

receives.
"You take some of the nation's
best, and they're getting the best
grades," says Chace. "What do
you expect? Give them bad
grades? Of course they're going
to get good grades. They work
hard."
Brutal Grades
But Kennedy, who is known as
a brutal grader by many students,
says, "It won't do to say that all
their abilities are virtually equal
and the average grade point that's
clustered right at the top of the
scale accurately measures the
differences between them.
"We need to utilize the whole
grade spectrum ... to give a
visible public signal to the student
about how his work stands up in

relation to other students'. And to
give a signal to someone else
someday who reads the transcript
to get an idea of a given person's
relative ability."
Chace and Kennedy haven't
resolved this difference about
grading systems, and maybe they
won't resolve it until they start
turning in grades to the registrar's
office.
Lecture Styles
To students perhaps the most
noticeable difference between
Chace and Kennedy is their
lecture styles.
Kennedy dresses in sharp
three-piece suits: usually a bright
blue jacket, matching slacks,
white shirt and tie. But he doesn't
show off his clothes. He gives his
lectures from behind the podium,
taking cues from his "very
extensive" notes.
He is always moving his hands
now adjusting his glasses, now
tucking in his shirt, now
straightening his tie and finally
waving one hand in front of
himself to add emphasis to a
point.
Kennedy is more dogmatic in
his lectures than his counterpart,
but like Chace he is very
organized.
Generalization
"As a historian," says Kennedy,
"I deal in grosser commodities,
less concerned with trapping an
idea in language, more with
shaping big outlines and talking
about things with a certain level
of generalization."
And Chace? In his brown suede
jacket, flaired brown pants and
moccasin-like loafers, Chace
doesn't look like a lecturer.
However, standing straight on
stage, pacing to and fro with the
light shining off his high dome
forehead and gold-rimmed glasses,
he is not easily missed.
He usually reads his lectures
from a yellow pad, occasionally
pausing to dramatically quote such
notables as Aristotle. Sometimes
he stares at his feet; other times

he gazes at the auditorium
balcony.
No Soapbox
Chace says he's dramatic on
purpose. "You've got to make the
student feel the 50 minutes is
endurable," he explains. "I don't
think I should be soapboxing, or
delivering a harangue. I just try to
give a pleasing lecture."
With more than 300 students
showing up for every lecture, it's
clear that someone thinks that
Chace and Kennedy are doing
their job well.
The class period comes to a
close. From behind the podium,
Kennedy is wrapping up his
answer to a student's question.
Most of the audience is scribbling
down his remarks in their
notebooks, but a few students in
the back of the room are dozing
off, reading a newspaper or
opening mail.
When Kennedy is done, Chace,
who has been standing in the
center of the stage listening, turns
to the crowd.
"We have received one more
question," he says, staring off at
the ceiling lights. "Why do you
use such big words all the time?
It's very hard to understand you."
Part of the class starts to laugh;
part of the class hisses.
"I have been asked to respond
to this question dealing with our
alleged polysyllabism," Chace
begins.
More laughter.
'7 am at once reminded of a
quote from Winnie The Pooh. 7
am a bear of very little brain and
long words bother me.' "
Still more laughter.
"When complexity meets with
complexity in this class," he adds,
"it is our duty to choose the
concise word that can best resolve
the problem. . . In our
pedogogical dispositions, we've
always sought to denominate a
spade a spade.
"In short," he finishes, "We
change not. You must."
Applause.

DYNAMIC DUOâ€”Assoc. English Prof. William Chace (1.) and Assoc. History Prof. David Kennedy share the
task of teaching what some students consider to be the class of the century, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century." While Kennedy is considered to be one of the most demanding profs on campus, Chace
likens himself to Huckleberry Finn but such philosophical differences don't result in much in-class
disagreement.
It is still early morning when
the first student walks into
ancient Cubberley Auditorium.
Class won't start for at least 20
minutes, but the student pulls off
his jacket and collapses in a seat
near the front of the hall.
The auditorium with its dirty
beige walls is no escape from the
bleak skies outside. The square
lights integrated with rusty
sprinkler heads on the ceiling
provide evep less light than there
is outdoors.

try to find a little ray of light in
all this gloom."
Chace agrees, but speaks of
more philosophical differences
between them:
"David sees his situation more
amenable to change. He perhaps

sees himself as a good and
patriotic American. I don't mean
simplistic patriot. He is responsive
to the very best aspirations of this
country and he is judging his
behavior in terms of how well he
lives up to the expectations of his
country.
'Huckleberry Finn'
"I guess I could sum up my
position by saying I'm more of a
Huckleberry Finn. I've always
enjoyed the freedom and
liberties" represented by "the
critical dissociative example that
Huckleberry Finn provides."
What do the two profs argue
about most? Chace says it's the
3.55 grade point average that the
typical undergraduate at Stanford

receives.
"You take some of the nation's
best, and they're getting the best
grades," says Chace. "What do
you expect? Give them bad
grades? Of course they're going
to get good grades. They work
hard."
Brutal Grades
But Kennedy, who is known as
a brutal grader by many students,
says, "It won't do to say that all
their abilities are virtually equal
and the average grade point that's
clustered right at the top of the
scale accurately measures the
differences between them.
"We need to utilize the whole
grade spectrum ... to give a
visible public signal to the student
about how his work stands up in

relation to other students'. And to
give a signal to someone else
someday who reads the transcript
to get an idea of a given person's
relative ability."
Chace and Kennedy haven't
resolved this difference about
grading systems, and maybe they
won't resolve it until they start
turning in grades to the registrar's
office.
Lecture Styles
To students perhaps the most
noticeable difference between
Chace and Kennedy is their
lecture styles.
Kennedy dresses in sharp
three-piece suits: usually a bright
blue jacket, matching slacks,
white shirt and tie. But he doesn't
show off his clothes. He gives his
lectures from behind the podium,
taking cues from his "very
extensive" notes.
He is always moving his hands
now adjusting his glasses, now
tucking in his shirt, now
straightening his tie and finally
waving one hand in front of
himself to add emphasis to a
point.
Kennedy is more dogmatic in
his lectures than his counterpart,
but like Chace he is very
organized.
Generalization
"As a historian," says Kennedy,
"I deal in grosser commodities,
less concerned with trapping an
idea in language, more with
shaping big outlines and talking
about things with a certain level
of generalization."
And Chace? In his brown suede
jacket, flaired brown pants and
moccasin-like loafers, Chace
doesn't look like a lecturer.
However, standing straight on
stage, pacing to and fro with the
light shining off his high dome
forehead and gold-rimmed glasses,
he is not easily missed.
He usually reads his lectures
from a yellow pad, occasionally
pausing to dramatically quote such
notables as Aristotle. Sometimes
he stares at his feet; other times

he gazes at the auditorium
balcony.
No Soapbox
Chace says he's dramatic on
purpose. "You've got to make the
student feel the 50 minutes is
endurable," he explains. "I don't
think I should be soapboxing, or
delivering a harangue. I just try to
give a pleasing lecture."
With more than 300 students
showing up for every lecture, it's
clear that someone thinks that
Chace and Kennedy are doing
their job well.
The class period comes to a
close. From behind the podium,
Kennedy is wrapping up his
answer to a student's question.
Most of the audience is scribbling
down his remarks in their
notebooks, but a few students in
the back of the room are dozing
off, reading a newspaper or
opening mail.
When Kennedy is done, Chace,
who has been standing in the
center of the stage listening, turns
to the crowd.
"We have received one more
question," he says, staring off at
the ceiling lights. "Why do you
use such big words all the time?
It's very hard to understand you."
Part of the class starts to laugh;
part of the class hisses.
"I have been asked to respond
to this question dealing with our
alleged polysyllabism," Chace
begins.
More laughter.
'7 am at once reminded of a
quote from Winnie The Pooh. 7
am a bear of very little brain and
long words bother me.' "
Still more laughter.
"When complexity meets with
complexity in this class," he adds,
"it is our duty to choose the
concise word that can best resolve
the problem. . . In our
pedogogical dispositions, we've
always sought to denominate a
spade a spade.
"In short," he finishes, "We
change not. You must."
Applause.

DYNAMIC DUOâ€”Assoc. English Prof. William Chace (1.) and Assoc. History Prof. David Kennedy share the
task of teaching what some students consider to be the class of the century, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century." While Kennedy is considered to be one of the most demanding profs on campus, Chace
likens himself to Huckleberry Finn but such philosophical differences don't result in much in-class
disagreement.
It is still early morning when
the first student walks into
ancient Cubberley Auditorium.
Class won't start for at least 20
minutes, but the student pulls off
his jacket and collapses in a seat
near the front of the hall.
The auditorium with its dirty
beige walls is no escape from the
bleak skies outside. The square
lights integrated with rusty
sprinkler heads on the ceiling
provide evep less light than there
is outdoors.
Another student walks into the
auditorium and then three more
and then another two. They
shuffle almost aimlessly down the
two aisles, finding their seats
accidently.
The noise increases as the room
fills with warm bodies, and
suddenly from out of the crowd
two energetic actors step onto the
stage: Assoc. English Prof. William
Chace and Assoc. History Prof.
David Kennedy.
The course has been called the
class of the century. However,
both professors agree that the
title, "The American Condition In
The 20th Century," is a
misnomer.
"We did annouce the first day
that a better name for the course
would be 'Reflections On The
American Condition In The 20th
Century,' " Kennedy says. "But
even that is a bit grand after all."
"There's an enormous amount
we can't touch," Chace admits.
"Our course centers on the
readings, most of them classic
statements of what it was like to
be an American."
10 Books
The 10 books for the course
include An American Tragedy by
Theodore Dreiser, The Education
of Henry Adams by Henry Adams
and Native Son by Richard
Wright. The theme of the course
seems to be American
self-consciousness.
The class is being offered for
the first time this quarter to

"elicit and gauge student interest in
an American Studies program,"
says Kennedy.
One goal, he says, is to set up a
program similar to the Humanities
Honors Program, perhaps within
the next two years.
Chace and Kennedy alternate
lectures Monday and Wednesday
mornings. On Thursdays, they
give what is best described by one
student as "a question-answer
lecture."
Thorough Answers
Students send in written
questions and the professors
prepare answers to them.
However, some students complain
the answers are usually so
thorough and long that the profs
only have time for two or three
questions.
"Exchange of dialogue between
students and professors is always a
problem in large lecture classes,"
says Kennedy. "We'd like to take
more questions from the floor but
an awful lot of questions may not
be interesting to the entire class."
Other students complain that
the Thursday period is usually a
"rehash" of what has already been
discussed. To spice up the
proceedings, they say, the
professors should argue back and
forth more.
"They never argue they're
too civilized," says one student.
Slightly Embarrassed
Chace and Kennedy say they
are surprised and even "slightly
embarrassed" that they don't
disagree more.
"We both just have a great
capacity for putting up with one
another," Chace says.
While agreeing they should
probably argue more, he warns
that "the art" in arguing "is what
profit you can make out of it for
the students. The danger is just
bickering."
Even though the two profs
don't argue much, they do have
differences.
"We expected that our big
difference would be

methodological, that there would
be more difference in emphasis
between the historical approach as
opposed to the literary approach
to questions," says Kennedy.
Temperamental Difference
Instead, he says, big
difference is "temperamental.
Chace is far more pessimistic than
I am ... more drawn to those
authors that take a more
pessimistic stand and less
enamored with those books that
try to find a little ray of light in
all this gloom."
Chace agrees, but speaks of
more philosophical differences
between them:
"David sees his situation more
amenable to change. He perhaps

sees himself as a good and
patriotic American. I don't mean
simplistic patriot. He is responsive
to the very best aspirations of this
country and he is judging his
behavior in terms of how well he
lives up to the expectations of his
country.
