# SRI To Lease Extra Acres For Income
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) plans to allocate 10 acres of
its Menlo Park property for
''income producing"
development, Oren L.
Christensen, an SRI staff planner,
told the Daily last week.
Christensen explained that SRI
is not utilizing all of its 71-acre
property and decided that the
land, fronting Middlefield Road,
might serve as a convenient
income source.
Although the land is currently
zoned for professional and
administrative purposes, Ronald
Deutsch, director of SRI public
relations, said he is not certain
how the land would be used.
Deutsch emphasized, however,
that any plan would be consonant
with the desires of the Menlo Park
authorities.
Christensen said that SRI has
no immediate plans for leasing the
land, and has made no decision as
to how much to charge for the
land or for how long to arrange
the leases.
Deutsch said that the decision
to lease the land was the result of
long term financial planning
rather than a financial emergency.
