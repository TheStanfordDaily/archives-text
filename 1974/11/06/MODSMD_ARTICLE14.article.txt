# Author Says Societal Changes Must Begin At Personal Level
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Our industrial society "defined
by the market system, defined by
technology, defined by what
science can do for us led us down
a road where people were
products of a system," said
former Yale Law Prof. Charles
Reich to a group of 30 students
Monday night in Whitman House
lounge.
Reich, author of The Greening
of America, advocated that
society become more of a
community, that people push for
change in their personal lives as
well as societal change and that
individuals related to one
another on a personal level and
demand meaning in their lives.
"I basically see change as
having to come from the
individual first and then the
government," said Reich.
"It isn't possible for the system
to change while we remain the
same. That's a contradiction of
terms. Don't look to the
consumer index for how the
world is going to change. Look to
the people in this room."
'Borrowing' On Future
Reich, who resigned his Yale
Law School professorship last
year and moved to the Bay Area
to write a new book, claimed
"The system is a form of
borrowing against the future."
He explained that by making
ourselves into highly specialized
people and professionals "we are
sacrificing fullness."

"This type of borrowing
ultimately has to be paid for,"
added Reich. "Now it's being paid
for in economic chaos and
personal chaos."
Society in general can't go
much farther without becoming a
community, said Reich. He
explained that in his 14 years on
the Yale Law School faculty no
one told him anything "about
what was going on in their lives."
Opening Up
Reich emphasized the
importance of people opening up
to one another and sharing their
sorrows, dreams and hopes.
"Men are most hung-up about
disclosing their vulnerability.. . I
feel that if I can be open and
accept openness I will help the
world. But I better do something
about it and not spend another 20
years talking about it," he said.
According to Reich, it is
important to have a "personal
agenda" in your own life and in
the way society should evolve.
"You are inviting despair and a
sense of chaos and personal
emptiness if you cannot see
what's going on. Get a perspective
on your own life and society,"
Reich said.
Pushing Ahead
Reich condemned people for
accepting the status quo and not
constanting taking risks and
pushing ahead.
He said it is necessary "to deal
with a society that's coming not
been," to accept the need to go
along with chances and not deny
their existence. "If we see where
we're going we can lose the poison
of cynicism," explained Reich.
The 46-year-old author
emphasized the need to look at
the system "in a whole new way
.. . stop pushing in a direction
that is no longer fruitful."
This pushing includes finding
an economy that doesn't use as
much, that replaces what it uses
and that doesn't go to extremes of
inequality and power, said Reich.
He urged people to invent a new
system, "not another economic
system with another name."
Personal Level
Reich also advocated constant
change and pushing ahead on a
personal level.

'"The day you get your diploma

is not an answer. The day you get
your professional degree is not an
answer. The day you get your job
is not an answer. Each one is an
invitiation to further void
beyond," Reich said.
A person has a right to a
meaningful life, he said. "If you
think that way you won't settle
for stagnation... . There is no job
waiting for you out there that will
offer satisfaction."
"You have to create your own
work or else you will be doing
what someone else wants you to
do and you won't like that," he
added.
Reich said he believes that
change will come first from
people "who have been kicked
around by the system for awhile."
He said students still seem to
think some of the promises will be
kept. The professionals in his
generation are desperate for lack
of growth and meaning in their
lives, Reich added.
Reich finally quoted a lawyer
friend of his who said, "When you
get; to my age all your hopes for
love are gone, your hopes for
work are gone. All you want is
power."
