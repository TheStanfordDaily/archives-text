"No one who goes to China
these days can come home and be
the same again," said Prof.Robert
Hofstader, director of the
University's High Energy Physics
Laboratory.
Hofstader presented an
illustrated lecture of his recent
three-week trip to the Peoples'
Republic of China Monday in the
Physic Lecture Hall. Six scientists
and their wives were personally
invited by the Scientific and
Technical Association of China to
participate in the tour.
Hofstader said he had traveled
to several Iron Curtain countries,
and always experienced the same
feeling of wanting to be liberated.
But he said, after three weeks in
China he was very sad to leave.
"There's something very different
about China," he commented.
The tour took the scientists to
scientific research centers and
universities from Hong Kong to
Canton, Shangahi and several
other Chinese cities. Hofstader
said they had good contact with
the Chinese scientists, and neither
held back information from the
other.
Not As Advanced
He said that Chinese
technology is usually not as
advanced as ours, but they are
working hard and trying to do
everything themselves. They
import very few things, and try to
manufacture all their own goods.
The Chinese work on lasar fusion
is surprisingly up to date, the
Nobel Laureate in physics added.
He said at the Sing
Huo University in Peking had an
excellent library, offering 2,000
hand copied journals from all over
the world.
During their visit to Hangshow,
they were given a demonstration
with the pure Tiger Spring water,
which has a high surface tension.
They filled a bowl to the brim
with water, and proceeded to add
coins, until the water level was
several millimeters above the
bowl. Hofstader said that was a
very well known stunt in that
area.
Although he claimed that they
were always on the move, making
it difficult to take pictures,
Hofstader managed to take some
beautiful slides. He spent most of
his lecture time commenting on,
and showing his "travelogue" of
slides.
As much of China's land as
possible is used for agriculture, he
said, showing pictures of the
terraced countryside.
Students Working
Students were working in the
fields everywhere the group went,
he added, mostly because all
students are required to serve two
years in factory, agriculture or
military service before they can be

admitted to a university.
Hofstader said the weather was
lovely, and in Canton it was
actually very hot.
The group frequently resorted
to use of mosquito nets because
the Chinese still haven't whipped
their mosquito problem, he
explained. He added that they
have solved the fly problem, and
that during their entire three week
visit, his wife counted only 12
flies.
Mao Images
Pictures and statues of
Chairman Mao were ever-present
in train stations, hotels, parks
basically everywhere. At one
university, Hofstader said, there
were pictures of Marx, Engels,
Lenin, and Stalin on one wall, and
Chairman Mao above occupied the
wall opposite, to "balance them
out."

He said one of the highlights of
their trip was the Oct. 1
celebration of the 25th
anniversary of the Peoples'
Republic of China. There was no
single parade or review, but there
was some type of celebration
everywhere. He said he especially
enjoyed all the children singing
and dancing.
Hofstader said they were always
greeted with a pleasant reception
and tea at each university they
visited. They were all treated
royally by the Chinese, and as
their guests, were not allowed to
pay for anything themselves, "not
even their own laundry," he said.
Each couple was provided with
their own "Shanghai" car, named
after the city where it is made. He
said the cars were similar to 1955
Chevy s, but were very
comfortable and sturdy.

people trying to be self-sufficient,but that Chinese technology was not
as advanced as ours. Hofstader recently visited the People's Republic
