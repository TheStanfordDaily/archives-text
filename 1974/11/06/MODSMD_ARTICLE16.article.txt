# Housing Committee To Present Report
## 
### RICHARD GRAY 
The finalized recommendations
of the Student Adivsory
Committee to the Dean of
Student Affairs on the new Row
Houses will be presented to the
University Board of Trustees'
Committee on Land and Building
next week.
In an effort to learn students'
housing preferences, the student
committee distributed a survey to
127 individuals presently living in
several types of housing.
"Most of the findings were
predictable," said ASSU Vice
President Ann Carter, co-chairman
of the committee. Some of the
findings indicate that most
students prefer a divided double
room, and that a kitchenette,
piano and television are the most
desired "luxury" facilities.
"The only surprise," Carter siad
"was that the students were
overwhelmingly in favor of
preserving the open green field"
next to Florence Moore as
opposed to converting it into
another type of recreational
facility.

The committee has reported
the results of its survey to the
administration and architects.
The present plans suggest the
construction of three new Row
houses at a total cost of $3.6
million to be located on Mayfield
Avenue across from the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity House. Each
house will shelter about 50
students.
This general plan has been
approved in concept by the Board
of Trustees and "is expected to be
completed by September 1976,"
said Senior Planner Bob Nerrie,
"barring any unpredictable
difficulties."
The student committee was
formed in August on the
recommendation of the Student
Affairs Office to meet with
administration officials and
architects to offer planning
suggestions for the new Row
houses.
In an effort to learn what
qualities make Row houses so
attractive to students, many
members of the committee and
several administrations lived in
Lathrop for two days before
school started.
The committee recognizes that
many students with new ideas
have not yet had the opportunity
to be heard, Carter said.
Therefore, it has announced a
meeting open to all students with
ideas or questions about the
proposals to be held tonight at
7:15 in the Lathrop lounge.
