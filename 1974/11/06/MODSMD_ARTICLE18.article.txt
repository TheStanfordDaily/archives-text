# Advanced Degrees Affected
## Minority Applications Down 
### 
University News Service
Minority students for the most part are as
successful as nonminority students in completing
graduate and professional level work here, a newly
compiled report notes.
But applications from minority students for
advanced degrees "appear to be leveling off and
dwindling in several fields, in spite of recent
increases in minority undergraduate enrollments"
across the country, the report adds.
Nationally, "minority communities believe that
predominantly white universities are abandoning
their commitment to educate students of color."
As one graduate student put it: "Now frhat things
are quiet, they slowly phase us out."
The Stanford report was compiled by 12
students, faculty, and staff members on a steering
committee headed by Maria Baeza, assistant to the
dean of graduate studies, and Thorn Rhue, head of
the Afro-American and.African studies program.
The committee calls Stanford's commitment to
minority students at the graduate and professional
level "encouraging and substantial, but only a
beginning."
During the past four years, fewer than 15 blacks,
chicanos, and native Americans have received their
Ph.D.'s here for example. But minority students
are making "significant progress" in Ph.D.
programs, which normally take an average of seven
years to complete.
Minority students seeking master's degrees are
completing their work within the year or two this

normally involves, the report adds.
"While not without problems, Stanford has had
success in several of its efforts to respond to the
educational needs of minority communities.
"If retrenchment is part of the national scene, it ;
is imperative that Stanford resist such influences in
its programs," the report states.
Advanced degree enrollment by blacks, chicanos, >
and native Americans rose from 83 in 1968-69 to ■
465 in 1973-74, while total enrollment at this level '
declined from 5,949 to 5,689, the report cites. 1
Financial . aid for these three minority groups !
increased from $409,000 to an estimated $l.B
million in the same period.
Some schools and departments are "quite 1
enthusiastic about their progress," with medicine
seriously considering possible expansion of its
minority admission goal to 20 percent from 10
percent of the entering class, the report notes. "But 4
this enthusiasm is no longer typical of most '
departments," the report notes.
"The social conditions which prompted
Stanford's 1969 commitment have changed only
marginally. In some cases they are worse. The kind
of sentiment which supports the far-reaching De
Funis case at the University of Washington Law
School is not at all encouraging."
"The fact that so rriany Ph.D. students remain in
good standing, combined with the success of the
master's candidates, demonstrates the competence
of the minority students Stanford attracts," the
report declared.

Congressional race to incumbent Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr (R-Menlo Park). Barr's faith remains
unshaken, however. He says he wants to be a mayor like Gillmor when he grows up.
