## JV Defense Keys Win Over Cal Poly 
### 
Stanford's junior varsity
football team won its second
game in as many starts Monday,
downing a rough Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo squad 20-14 at
Stanford Stadium.
Stanford built up a 20-7 lead in
the first half, and though the
offense sputtered in the second
half, the defense was able to
maintain the victory.
The Mustangs got the first score
after one of Card quarterback
Steve Dils' passes was intercepted
and returned to the Stanford 42.
SLO used two passes to the tight
end, Steve Kuresa, to get the
score.

Stanford got ahead quickly
with three first-half touchdowns.
Running back Greg Smith keyed
the drives with key runs. For the
second straight game, Smith was
the leading rusher, gaining 95
yards on but 10 carries.
Another running back, Gary
Lynn, was also impressive, scoring
Stanford's first two touchdowns,
and winding up with 85 yards on
18 carries.
The final Stanford touchdown
came on a 15 yard TD pass from
Dils to James Lofton, who made a
great leap for the reception.
That was all the scoring, as
Stanford coach Doug Single

substituted freely in the second
half. In all, SLO intercepted five
passes, further damaging the
Cards' chances to run up a score.
The fifth interception, at the
Stanford 10, led to Cal Poly's
second touchdown, so the Card
defense can't really be blamed for
that.

Defensive standouts for the
Cardinals included end Mike
Yancey and middle guard Art
Estrada, both of whom have a
shot at seeing considerable varsity
playing time next year.
The two teams are set to play a
rematch next Monday at San Luis
Obispo.


CAPTAINS These three players will captain Stanford Saturday against USC. Ray Anderson (left) won the nod as special teams captain with
Drew Palin (center) keying the defense and Ron Inge (right) on offense. Anderson and Inge have both made explosive runs this season, 1 aim
wasn't quite as fast after he intercepted a pass earlier this year.
