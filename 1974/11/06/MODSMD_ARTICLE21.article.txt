# Chris Seeks $2000 Bill For Luck Against Trojans
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If'you see Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen with his head down
this week, don't think it's because
he fears his Cardinals will be
crunched by USC in the Biggest
Game Saturday.
Chris yesterday told Northern
California sportswriters that "two
weeks ago, I found two pennies
on the ground and we won by two
points. Last week, I found a
nickel and we won by four; pretty
close.
"But this week I'm going to
have a tough time finding a $2OOO
bill."
Chris, of course, was referring
to the infamous statement of USC
coach John McKay that he'd like
to beat Stanford by 2000 points.
McKay hasn't forgotten that
quote, made after his team was
subjected to verbal abuse on the
way to the Stanford locker room
two years ago, either.
'Any Team'
McKay said yesterday that he'd
be satisfied with a one-point win
over Stanford, but that any team
should want to beat any' other
team by 2000 points.
McKay later quipped "3000?
... 4000?"
McKay once threatened to
have his team dress at Rickey's
Hyatt House in Palo Alto to avoid
what he calls "the mile-long walk"
to the Stanford dressing room and
resultant racial taunts directed at
some of his black players.
But while USC's sports
information director, Jim Perry,
said he didn't know where USC
would suit up, informed sources
both here and in Los Angeles say
the Trojans will dress as always
at the Encina Gym locker
room.

As the shouting goes on, so
does the preparation. Stanford is
having a spirited week of practice,
which has included mock attacks
on offensive line coach Hudson
Houck, a USC alumnus.
The coaching staff named
running back Ron Inge, nose
guard Drew Palin and kick
returner Ray Anderson captains
for the week. The trio has led
exercises in an unusually lively
way.
On a more serious note three
players, Scott Laidlaw, Pat
Donovan and John Snider, have
been held out of practice due to
injury, but all should be ready in
plenty of time for the game.
Bitter
Down in Los Angeles, McKay
has been unusually bitter about
his team following a 15-15 tie
with Cal Saturday that dropped
the Trojans from sixth to 11th in
the AP rankings.
McKay said such things as "We
have practically no offense most

of the time," (wonder how
Anthony Davis feels about that)
and "We don't even have a good
team this year."
He'd also said "This team is
living in the past."
Those statements of course,
may be his way of inspiring his
players to live in the present.
Cardinal No.tes: Yes, tickets
still do remain for the game,
though most of the reserved
tickets left are in not so-choice
locations. A crowd of 80,000 is
predicted...
The game won't be televised, as
ABC is already committed to
showing USC against-both UCLA
and Notre Dame. Of course if
Stanford does beat USC, ABC will
have egg on its face...
UCLA coach Dick Vermeil
predicts that USC will win,
though he admits he's prejudiced
because a Trojan victory would
help his Rose Bowl chances.

said he didn't know where USC
would suit up, informed sources
both here and in Los Angeles say
the Trojans will dress as always
at the Encina Gym locker
room.

As the shouting goes on, so
does the preparation. Stanford is
having a spirited week of practice,
which has included mock attacks
on offensive line coach Hudson
Houck, a USC alumnus.
The coaching staff named
running back Ron Inge, nose
guard Drew Palin and kick
returner Ray Anderson captains
for the week. The trio has led
exercises in an unusually lively
way.
On a more serious note three
players, Scott Laidlaw, Pat
Donovan and John Snider, have
been held out of practice due to
injury, but all should be ready in
plenty of time for the game.
Bitter
Down in Los Angeles, McKay
has been unusually bitter about
his team following a 15-15 tie
with Cal Saturday that dropped
the Trojans from sixth to 11th in
the AP rankings.
McKay said such things as "We
have practically no offense most

of the time," (wonder how
Anthony Davis feels about that)
and "We don't even have a good
team this year."
He'd also said "This team is
living in the past."
Those statements of course,
may be his way of inspiring his
players to live in the present.
Cardinal No.tes: Yes, tickets
still do remain for the game,
though most of the reserved
tickets left are in not so-choice
locations. A crowd of 80,000 is
predicted...
The game won't be televised, as
ABC is already committed to
showing USC against-both UCLA
and Notre Dame. Of course if
Stanford does beat USC, ABC will
have egg on its face...
UCLA coach Dick Vermeil
predicts that USC will win,
though he admits he's prejudiced
because a Trojan victory would
help his Rose Bowl chances.
If'you see Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen with his head down
this week, don't think it's because
he fears his Cardinals will be
crunched by USC in the Biggest
Game Saturday.
Chris yesterday told Northern
California sportswriters that "two
weeks ago, I found two pennies
on the ground and we won by two
points. Last week, I found a
nickel and we won by four; pretty
close.
"But this week I'm going to
have a tough time finding a $2OOO
bill."
Chris, of course, was referring
to the infamous statement of USC
coach John McKay that he'd like
to beat Stanford by 2000 points.
McKay hasn't forgotten that
quote, made after his team was
subjected to verbal abuse on the
way to the Stanford locker room
two years ago, either.
'Any Team'
McKay said yesterday that he'd
be satisfied with a one-point win
over Stanford, but that any team
should want to beat any' other
team by 2000 points.
McKay later quipped "3000?
... 4000?"
McKay once threatened to
have his team dress at Rickey's
Hyatt House in Palo Alto to avoid
what he calls "the mile-long walk"
to the Stanford dressing room and
resultant racial taunts directed at
some of his black players.
But while USC's sports
information director, Jim Perry,
said he didn't know where USC
would suit up, informed sources
both here and in Los Angeles say
the Trojans will dress as always
at the Encina Gym locker
room.
