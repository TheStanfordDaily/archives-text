# Rose Bowl Math: It Don't Come Easy

### VLAE KERSHNER 
For the first time in three years, Stanford fans can seriously talk
about going to the Rose Bowl. So here is a question and-answer
synopsis of the 1975 Rose Bowl race.
How many teams can still go to the Rose Bowl?
Four. Stanford and USC are tied for the lead with 3-0-1 records,
and the winner of their game Saturday will obviously be a strong
favorite. But UCLA, at 2-1-1, retains a strong mathematical possibility
and Washington, though only 2-2, has a slim shot.
What about California?
The Bears, 2-1-I,have a good chance to become conference co- or
tri-champions,but are ineligible to go to the Rose Bowl because the
school is on NCAA probation.
If Stanford beats USC, what will happen?
If Stanford goes on to beat both Oregon and Cal, it easily goes. If it
beats one team but falls to the other, then a tie for the conference
championship with USC or UCLA is likely.
What happens if there's a tie?
The Pac-B's primary tiebreaking mechanism is that the winner of
the game between the two schools goes to the Rose Bowl. But if there
are more than two schools tied, and none have beaten all of the other
co-champsions, then the Pac-8 goes by the best non-conference
record.
This has grave implications for Stanford. Suppose the Cards beat
USC and Oregon, but lose to Cal, which meanwhile has beaten
Washington and WSU. Then it is very possible that Cal, USC and
Stanford would all be 5-1-1.
Even though Cal is ineligible, the tie would still be broken by best
non-conference record. And USC's non-league record is much better
than that of Stanford.
So Stanford has to beat both USC and Cal to have a chance?
Unless Cal loses to either Washington or Washington State, that is
correct. If the Bears did lose before the Stanford game, they'd be out
of the Rose Bowl race, and unless UCLA somehow beats USC
Stanford would go.
What if USC beats Stanford?
Forget it for us. This result would help UCLA, however as the
Bruins would go if they won all their remaining games including the
USC game.
If, this Saturday, either USC or Stanford has the choice of taking a
sure tie or risking a loss by going for a win, which should it do?
Stanford must win. Since USC does have the better non-conference
record (2-1 as opposed to 0-3-1) it would go to the Rose Bowl simply
by beating Washington and UCLA, regardless of what Stanford did.
USC probably should go for the tie, although the Trojans must
realize that then any slip-up in their last two games would pretty
much eliminate them.
What's the weirdest thing that could possibly happen?
If the right combination of results occurred,USC could tie Stanford
and either UCLA or Washington for the conference championship.
(Washington could finish 5-2, which would tie USC if the Trojans
finished 4-1-2).
So it would come down to non-conference records. But USC still
has one non-league game to play, with Notre Dame, Nov. 30. So
USC could be put in a position where it would have to beat Notre
Dame to go to the Rose Bowl.
