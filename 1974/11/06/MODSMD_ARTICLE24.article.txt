## Ali: Always Was, And Will Be, King 
### Glenn Garvin 
"I am the greatest!" he screamed, and his
elders were appalled. A 21-year-old black kid
in his first title Tight doesn't say these things.
Humility, you punk, humility that's what
you need.
The trouble in those days, and the trouble
now, is that the kid was right. He was the
greatest; he proved it by whomping up on
Sonny Liston for eight rounds or so before
someone had the good sense to stop the
fight.
In those days he was Cassius Clay, the
Louisville Lip, an arrogant young man who
apparently believed that plenty of jaw
exercise was the best way to train for a
heavyweight fight. He got in plenty before
meeting Liston for the title in 1964, and it
worked. Everyone knew Liston wasn't much
of a talker; when he was in the ring with
Clay, he didn't look like much of a fighter,
either.
The name has changed now he's
Muhammed Ali but otherwise that
trash-talking young dude is still pretty much
the same guy he was then. When he beat
George Foreman to regain his title last week
Ali didn't leave any doubt about it.
Same Old Ali
No sir, it was the old Ali. You could tell.
There he was,floating like a butterfly, stinging
like a bee, in his finest style. He led Foreman
around on a leash for seven rounds, letting
the Texan hit him just enough to prove that
he could take it. Foreman's punches were no
big deal, Ali told the crowd silently.
And then, after tiring Foreman, after
proving he could stay in the ring with him as
long as he wanted, Ali ended it, just like that
a left-right combination that put Foreman
in a position best suited for star-gazing.
Ali didn't even look tired.
The mouth was working too. In fact, Ali's
post-fight press conference was. so full of
priceless quotes that most newspapers ran
bigger stories on it than on the fight.
Ali opened up modestly. "He was
humiliated," the champ allowed. "I did it. I
told you he was nothing. Did you listen? I
knew all along Foreman didn't like to be hit.
It was so clear to me. He just didn't like to be
punched."

Then he stepped up the tempo a bit: "The
fact was, George was scared... He punched
like a sissy ... I have radar built in."
Favorite Target
And finally Ali picked on the newsmen a
little, which has always been his specialty:
"Everybody stop talking now! Attention! I
told you I was the greatest of all time. Never
again say I'm going to be defeated. Never
again make me an underdog until I'm 50
years of age. All of you suckers bow."
History does not tell us if they bQwed.
The wonderful thing about Ali is that he
really hasn't changed at all. He shot off his
mouth like this long before he was anybody,
and even longer before it was fashionable for
athletes to be loudmouths.
In 1964, when Cassius Clay was
smart-mouthing everyone before his first
fight with Liston, jocks just didn't do that
kind of thing. In those days Jim Bouton was
busy authoring a magazine article on what a
great bunch of guys the Yankees were and
why it was such an honor to play with them.
Mike Marshall was an outfielder in the minor
leagues somewhere. Joe Namath wasn't even
out of college yet.
But there was Clay, telling everyone he
knew he was going to beat the hell out of
Liston, and he didn't care who was listening.
For any young athlete to talk like this was
shocking; for a young black athlete, it was
absolutely unthinkable. Quickly the white
media marked Clay as an enemy, a juvenile
delinquent who needed to be crushed.
Transformed
The most remarkable index of just how
much the public disliked Clay was Sonny
Liston's popularity, which went off like an
ICBM. Liston was nothing but a street punk,
a guy who would have spent his life robbing
gas stations if he hadn't been lucky enough
to get into boxing. Everyone knew it.
But when somebody like Clay was around,
Sonny Liston was magically transformed into
a forthright symbol of "respectable" black
America; he was what they all should be
like.
Clay, though, was what they all shouldn't
be. When he changed his name to Ali after a

couple years the media decided it wasn't
going to play along with any crazy nigger
who wanted to call himself something
different. What right did Clay have to change
his name? Who the hell did he think he was?
And for several years you could still pick up
sports pages and read about the exploits of
Cassius Clay, even though no such person
existed.
Actually, that's not true. Between 1968
and 1970, the only place you could read
about Clay was on the front pages, which
carried the news of his fight against a Texas
draft board. While that fight was on, Ali
couldn't fight anywhere.
Incomprehensible
Some people wondered if that didn't seem
like a case of presumed guilty until proven
innocent. And others wondered just what
Ali's politics had to do with his fighting
ability. Ali always said the two weren't
related; he would have been happy to spend
some time in the ring. He couldn't find a
single state that would let him, though.
They took his heavyweight title away, too,
and that hurt. The World Boxing Association
held a transparently phony search for a new
champ, with mediocre midgets like Buster
Mathis and Jimmy Ellis pushing each other
around a ring. It was sickening.
After the Supreme Court knocked out the
draft board for Ali, he started boxing again,
and lost only one fight: when Ken Norton
broke his jaw with a freak punch. It's true
the judges said he lost a title fight to Frazier
but the fight put Frazier in the hospital for
two months. If that's winning well, Frazier
is lucky to be alive.
But even though Ali lost only once, they
seized the chance to take some shots at him.
Ali is old, they said. He's not hungry any
more. He's had it. He's washed up. His poetry
stinks.
None of it was true, and Ali proved it.
"Now you have to recognize me as the
scholar of boxing," he told newsmen after
the fight.
The scholar ? Hell, no. The king , Ali, the
king. You always were and you always will
be.
