# Washington Cage Schedule Changed
## 
### 
Washington and Washington
State home basketball games have
been moved from Saturday and
Monday nights to Thursdays and
Saturdays for the 1974-75 season.
The change was made partially
because Husky coach Marv
Harshman and Cougar coach
George Raveling complained that
they didn't have enough time to
prepare for an away game on
Friday night after a home game
on Monday night.
However, according to Stanford
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz,
television also played an
important part in the decision,
since four Thursday night games
will be televised this season as part

of a revised Pac-8
game-of-the-week schedule.
Changes in Pacific Eight
procedures are made through a
system by which a committee of
coaches makes recommendations
to an administrative committee of
the eight athletic directors. Final
approval is given by a council of
the eight athletic directors plus
faculty members.
" Three significant
recommendations were considered
by the coaches from which
changing the Washington and
Washington State basketball
schedule precipitated. The first
was to change all Pac-8 games to
Thursday and Saturday nights

instead of the regular Friday and
Saturday games.
After this motion was defeated
by the committee of coaches, it
was amended so it would change
only Washington and Washington
State home games to Thursday
and Saturday. This motion passed.
Washington and Washington
State, however, wanted their
entire conference schedule
changed to Thursday and
Saturday night games, but this
motion was also defeated.
The Washington and
Washington State decision has
caused some static in Pac-8 circles.
"Some coaches feel that
Washington and Washington State
have an advantage because they
have a day break in between

games. The Huskies and Cougars,
however, think that they are at a
disadvantage because of the day
lay-off," said Dave Price, Pacific
Eight public relations director.
