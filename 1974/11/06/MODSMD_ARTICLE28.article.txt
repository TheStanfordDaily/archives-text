# Hockey Team Tops Sac, 5-3

### CHARLIE WHEELER 
SACRAMENTO-Stanford's
field hockey team survived a wild
second-half rally by Cal
State-Sacramento to win 5-3 on
yesterday afternoon.
The Cards, bouncing back from
their first defeat of the season at
Humboldt over the weekend, put
together a strong performance in
the first half. After intermission,
however, the Hornets closed the
margin to 4-3 with 19 minutes
left. The Stanford women finally
got their second win and Kathy
Levinson's breakaway goal with
nine minutes to play capped the
Stanford resurgence.
The first half belonged to
Stanford. Levinson scored after
only two minutes, giving the
Cards momentum they held for
the rest of the period. Both the
defense and offense played well,
and right inner Onnie Killefer beat
the Hornet goalie twice for a 3-0
halftime lead.
After only five minutes of the
second half Sacramento State had
reversed the momentum. The
Hornets scored three times in 11
minutes, but Cappy Coleman also
scored to keep the Cards in the

lead.
With about half the second
period left the Cards suddenly
caught fire again. The defense
solidified and held the Hornets in
check the rest of the way.
Coach Shirley Schoof changed
the line-up considerably for the
game. Ann Walker, Lyse Strnad,
Dee Gates and Carol Ferguson all

played well at their new positions.
Co-captain Janell Edman and
fullback Susy Schatzman played
their usual good defense, as did
Jane Soyster. When the defense in
front of her collapsed, goalkeeper
Betsy Morris was beaten three
times, but she played well under
great pressure towards the end of
the game.
