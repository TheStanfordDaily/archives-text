# Brown, Cranston Lead Demos To State Sweep
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Democrats apparently scored a nearly clean sweep of
state offices yesterday, electing Secretary of State Edmund
G. Brown Jr. to be governor and resoundingly returning
incumbent Alan Cranston to the United States Senate.
Brown claimed victory late last night in his hotly
contested battle with state Controller Houston I. Flournoy,
the Republican nominee. Flournoy appeared before
supporters in Los Angeles shortly after Brown's appearance,
but refused to concede.
With 42 percent of the vote counted early this morning,
Brown had 1,344,555 votes, or 51 percent, to Flournoy's
1,201,641 votes, or 46 percent. (Minor party candidates
accounted for the remaining votes.)
Cranston, meanwhile, scored a victory of landslide
proportions over state Sen. H.L. Richardson of Loomis, the
Republican candidate. With 42 percent of the vote tallied,
Cranston had 1,593,712 votes, or 64 percent, to
Richardson's 860,944 votes, or 34 percent.
Cranston's margin of victory appeared on its way to
becoming the largest in California history. Richardson, a
former staff member of the John Birch Society, conceded
after just 10 percent of the vote had been counted.
Speaking from his home, Richardson said of Cranston: "I
wish him the best. The people of California have pretty
much chosen what they want. And that's what they're
going to get. That's the way the democratic process works."
Lengthy Climb
In contrast to Cranston's race, Brown trailed Flournoy in
early returns and didn't pull ahead in the count until some
two hours after the polls closed. He slowly built on his lead
throughout the evening, though, and by 11:30 declared
that "it's pretty obvious to me that you've got a
Democratic governor in 1975."
But Flournoy, appearing shortly before midnight,
insisted, "When this night's over, we're going to have a new
governor and I'm going to be it." He had still not conceded
by 2:30 this morning.
Meanwhile, incumbent Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger was
the only Republican victor for state office. With 35 percent
of the vote counted, Younger had 1,128,224 votes, or 53
percent, to Democrat William Norris' 987,738 votes, or 47
percent.

Otherwise, Democrats took every
office. State Sen. Mervyn M. Dymally
of Los Angeles became the first black
to hold statewide partisan office by
ousting Republican Lt. Gov. John
Harmer, appointed several weeks ago

by outgoing Gov. Ronald Reagan. With 35 percent of the
vote tallied, Dymally had 1,088,281 votes, or 51 percent,
to Harmer's 948,2b8 votes, or 45 percent.
In a see-saw race, Democratic Assemblyman Kenneth Cory
of Garden Grove led GOP Assemblyman William Bagley of
San Rafael in the race to succeed Flournoy as controller.
With 35 percent counted, Cory had 1,047,286 votes, or 50
percent, to 893,096 votes, or 44 percent, for Bagley.
Easy Wins
But Oakland Assemblywoman March K. Fong rolled up a
wide lead in the race to succeed fellow Democrat Brown as
secretary of state. With 35 percent of the vote in, Fong had
1,257,291 votes, or 59 percent, compared to 745,329
votes, or 36 percent, for Republican Brian Van Camp,
former state corporations commissioner.
Jess Unruh, former Assembly speaker and the
Democrats' 1970 gubernatorial nominee, succeeded in his
second comeback attempt (He was defeated for mayor of
Los Angeles last year.) With 35 percent counted in the race
for state treasurer, he led with 1,129,581 votes, or 54
percent, to 865,774 votes, or 42 percent, for Republican
John T. Kehoe, the state consumer affairs director.
Preliminary figures indicated that substantially less than
the predicted 65 percent of the state's 9.9 million voters
went to the polls yesterday, despite brilliant sunny weather
throughout the state.
Legislature
Completing their sweep, the Democrats apparently
maintained their control of both houses of the state
legislature. Although exact totals weren't available,
Democrats took a 22-16 state Senate majority and 48-31
Assembly edge into the race.
Republicans were making stiff challenges to two
Democratic Assembly seats. In Hayward, early returns
indicated that ailing 10-term Assemblyman Carlos Bee, the
speaker pro tern, was trailing Republican challenger Guy
Puccio. And GOP Assemblyman Robert McLennan of Los
Angeles was leading Democratic Assemblyman Joe
Gonsalves in a race caused by redistricting.

But the Democrats scored one major upset in the Senate,
where Saratoga Mayor Jerome Smith apparently beat state
Sen. Clark Bradley of San Jose, the feisty conservative who
for many years represented Stanford.
The Democratic sweep yesterday was the party's best
performance in California since 1958, when Brown's father,
Edmund G. Brown Sr., ended 16 years of Republican rule.
The younger Brown is just the third Democratic governor
here since 1894.
Besides being the first son of a former governor to
become governor himself, Brown is also the first secretary
of state ever to become governor of California. He was first
elected to that post in 1970 while the GOP was sweeping all
other state offices, and in the last four years transformed
the formerly quiescent office into a strong enforcer of
election laws.
For a variety of reasons, Younger was the only
incumbent officeholder to seek re-election this year.
Brown, Flournoy and former Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke all
created vacancies by their gubernatorial bids, while
incumbent Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest, a Republican, retired
because of ill health.
Also in yesterday's ballot were yes-no votes on 10 state
appellate and supreme court justices, all of whom were
re-elected.


Edmund G. Brown Jr.
