# Gillmor's Consolation: Drinks, Kisses, Memories
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Before election night '74 was over
for Democratic Santa Clara Mayor
Gary Gillmor, there would be alternate
rounds of drinks and consolation
kisses. And there would be talk of a
1976 rematch with incumbent
Republican Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
landslide winner in the 12th
Congressional District.
But to the 13 campaigners at
Gillmor headquarters in Sunnyvale at
8:30 p.m., it was still anybody's race.

Then from the portable
black-and-white TV on top of the
Xerox machine came the
announcement: "Incumbent Pete
McCloskey has a substantial lead."
And from an early tabulation of
absentee ballots came the discouraging
results: Gillmor trailing 860 to 2134 in
Santa Clara County, and 3176 to 8248
in San Mateo County.
Glancing at a row of tables covered
with paper table cloths and a few
scattered bowls of chips and dips, the
campaign photographer remarked,
"With- the vote spread they're
predicting, I wouldn't be very
hungry."
But the kids who had tramped the
precincts with the candidate were
already dipping in. "I hit a complex of
apartments and passed out leaflets all
by myself," said one 11-year-old
Gillmor campaigner. Asked why he
worked for Gillmor, he replied, "I
knew him in Little League. He always
pitched the first ball. My parents knew
him. And besides, McCloskey's a
bum."

One of Gillmor's young supporters

11-year-old Ricky Barr had big ideas,
"I want to be a congressional page. I
want to be a congressman. But first I
want to be mayor of Santa Clara just
like Gary Gillmor."
Although Eddie Fox, 11, would
rather start out as "the councilman of
some state," he is already a political
realist. "If we lose, I'm not going to be
mad. Mr. Gillmor tried his best, and if
we win, it's even better."

Gillmor and his wife entered the
headquarters around 9:30 p.m.,
joining their daughters Shelley, 16,
Lisa, 14, and Tisa, 9. Their
12-year-old son stayed home to rest
up for a football game.
The candidate stopped smiling when
someone mentioned the early
returns: "What? Something's gotta be
wrong."
"New votes in," yelled Louis
Rowland, 11. "Eight-thousand-some
thing to twenty-one-thou
sand-something. You're losing by a
landslide."

McCloskey was talking like a
winner. Around 11 p.m., Gillmor
made his concession speech. He was
interrupted by his press realtions
director, Wade Brummel, just in from
walking the precincts, "Gary,"
Brummel said, "you carried one."
"My God, we won a precinct," the
candidate said, raising glass. "We
haven't lost yet, but we're way behind.
Let's have a drink."
"If he doesn't run again in two
years, he's crazy,, said one campaign
veteran. And someone began talking
about the 1976 elections. Why not? It
could be anybody's race.
