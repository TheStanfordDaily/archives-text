# New Year's Spirit At McCloskey Party
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
McCloskey supporters at a Rickey's
Hyatt House celebration last night
could have been attending a New
Year's Eve party.

Few of the several hundred
well-dressed, predominantly white,
middle-aged supporters had any
doubts that the incumbent Republican
would win big. So they left the
television sets early to celebrate to the
tune of a ragtime band.
Encouraged by the impressive
victory and a good number of
cocktails, many supporters eagerly
suggested that McCloskey will soon go
on to "bigger and better things," as
one woman in an evening gown said.
"I'd like to see him run against
Senator Tunney [in 1976]," said John
Gruver, a Mountain View campaigner.
"He'd make a good Secretary of the
Interior considering the views he holds
on conservation," suggested a Berkeley
supporter, who said he has worked for
McCloskey since the congressman's
1972 New Hampshire presidential
primary bid.
Integrity
Many of the jubilant supporters
toasted the congressman's integrity
and honesty, honoring them as a
reason for his big victory.
And a good number cited
McCloskey's reputation as a liberal
maverick, alienated from the plight of
the Nixon Administration, as crucial
to his avoidance of the fate of other
Republican candidates.

"McCloskey's showing the way the
Republican party has to go. The
'Pete-type' moderate rather than the
Goldwater type" • is the only
Republican who can be elected these
days, suggested Frank Menke, an IBM
analyst from Menlo Park.
Kiss
"He's a Republican Democrat a
really popular man," said a local
school administrator, one of the few
blacks in the room. He watched
McCloskey enter to enthusiastic
cheering and a kiss from his
83-year-old mother, who struggled
through the crowd to greet him.
"People like him, and there are not
too many politicians people like," said
former Stanford student Dave Morf.
"He's one of few who's willing to lose
on a principle" if he believes in it.
Most supporters felt that McCloskey
could accomplish much in a House of
Representatives which will have an
even larger majority of Democrats
than presently.
"He'll be a much more recognized
congressman than if he were a
Democrat," noted Bill Johnson, a
Stanford senior who has served as
McCloskey's campaign manager along
with senior Kathy Cunningham.
Most people at the gala celebration
were not so philosophical. "I'm just
glad McCloskey's not like most other
Republicans," laughed a rather tipsy
supporter in a plaid sports jacket. "I
wouldn't like to be in their
headquarters tonight."
