'Verdict' Of Voters
WASHINGTON President Ford said just before midnight yesterday, "I have
accepted the verdict" of voters who gave Democrats a big election victory but
noted "those who lose often come back to win another day."
In a statement read by Press Secretary Ron Nessen, Ford declared: "I am
confident that the new Congress will work wholeheartedly with me" in helping
to keep the nation strong economically and militarily and to promote the cause
of world peace.
"There was," Ford said, "no argument about the number one issue in this
campaign: Inflation and its crippling effect on our economy and on the lives of
all Americans.
FBI Agents Testify Against Mitchell, Ehrlichman
WASHINGTON The Watergate cover-up trial heard testimony yesterday
from three FBI agents who interviewed defendants John N. Mitchell and John D.
Ehrlichman within weeks of the June 17, 1972, break-in at Democratic National
Committee headquarters.
The agents testified that both Mitchell and Ehrlichman told them in separate
interviews that all they knew of the break-in was what they had read in the
newspapers. One of the charges against each is that the statement was false.
Battle lines formed over prosecution plans to play portions of 20 more White
House tapes as the prosecutors began calling witnesses to describe how the
taping system was installed, how it operated and to identify the voices.
John J. Wilson, lawyer for H. R. Haldeman, the former White House staff
chief who was a participant in most of the recorded conversations, said he would
demand that when the government plays a portion of any tape that the entire
conversation be played.
William G. Hundley, lawyer for Mitchell, said that playing tapes which include
incriminating references to Mitchell could deny him his right to face his accusers.
Coal Workers Resume Negotiations
WASHINGTON Coal operators and the United Mine Workers resumed
negotiations last night in what UMW President Arnold Miller said was an attempt
to "prevent a prolonged shutdown of the nation's mines."
Miller said the union was offering a "comprehensive contract package" to the
mine operators who, he said, have made a strike unavoidable.
Among the 60 issues that Miller said remain unresolved are proposals on wage&
and benefits and on mine safety.
Nixon's Lung Partially Collapses
LONG BEACH A portion of Richard Nixon's right lung has collapsed, and
there is fluid in his left lung, his doctor said yesterday.
The 61-year-old president's right lung was described later by a hospital
spokesman as having "an inactive area of living tissue,", with a small portion of
the organ not functioning normally.
Neither of the lung problems were believed serious.
Nixon will also take more walks in his hospital room, his physician, John C.
Lungren said yesterday.
Lungren said he was worried about the lung problems. He referred to the right
lung problem as atelectasis, meaning part of the lung had collapsed.
Lungren said despite some improvements, Nixon remained in serious
condition and was "terribly physically weak."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with local morning fog or low clouds and
occasional high cloudiness. Lows tonight in the 50s. Highs today and tomorrow
in the 60s. Light winds.
