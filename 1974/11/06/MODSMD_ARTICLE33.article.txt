# And On Campus, Few Gave A Damn

### PATTY FELS GLENN GARVIN 
It was most unlike another November night two
years ago. That night was dark, damp and
chilly—like this one—but it was also a night of gloom,
tears and shattered dreams for many Stanford
students.
This night there were no dreams to be shattered;
and wheie there is no hope there can be no gloom.
Tuesday night at Stanford was marked by boredom,
bitterness and sluggish post-midterm apathy.
In 1972 hundreds of students clustered around
dorm televisions, comforting each other as Richard
Nixon swept to victory. Not so last night.
Few students seemed interested in election
returns. Halls were empty, rooms were silent and
many dorm televisions went unused. Some were
turned on-but--not for watching election results. At
Roble, five people disinterestedly stared at The Wild
Wild West, ignoring election coverage on other
channels.
In Faisan, freshmen busily scurried about
carrying on an elaborate practical joke which
involved wiring a room shut. They looked up with
polite disbelief when asked about the election.
Ping Pong
In Cardenal two men played ping pong. In
Alondra a pre-med earnestly studied biology in

front of a blank television screen. "They'll be down
later, maybe," he said of other dorm residents. In
Paloma a young woman hesitantly picked out "Born
Free" on the piano. The rest of the dorm was silent.
Here and there, from an isolated room, the
sounds tof newsmen chattering the latest returns
echoed through quiet halls. "The only election
[talk] I even heard was from my roommate," said
Cheryl Beighle, a sophomore in Mirlo. "She was
going over her ballot last night, trying to decide who
to vote for." Beighle was one of the few with a
radio tuned to election news.
"I worked a lot in the '72 election, walking
precincts for McGovern," said Jim McDaniel, a
senior in Mirlo. "I've never been able to generate the
grass-roots enthusiasm since then . .. get out into
the precincts, and all that."
McDaniel thought the same political lethargy
enveloping him might account for the apparent lack
of interest around the dorms: "It's the product of
poeple being burned out by politics and the last two
years ... People talked a lot more about it then.
They probably knew a little more."
Low Turnout
The apathy extended past the dormitories to the
polls. At Stanford polling places the turnout ran
between 41 and 46 percent. "That's low," said
election inspector Louise Wright disapprovingly.

"Usually we get a much higher vote from students."
"There weren't even any creative write-ins,"
added Belle Jacobstein, an election judge.
In Wilbur and Stern, with high concentrations of
freshmen, interest was higher - but it still didn't
amount to much. And many of those who watched
the election were extremely bitter even though
their candidates were winning.
When early results showed Republican John
Harmer leading Mervyn Dymally for lieutenant
governor, another looked at the ceiling and moaned
"Shit. Shit. Shit. Holy shit."
"The' commies are here," one called out when a
San Francisco vote favored fluoridated water.
In UGLY, no one seemed too concerned about
the election. They giggled, studied and snored as
usual. "There's much less action than usual
tonight," one worker observed.
"Shhhhh!" a woman whispered at a loud group
of freshmen across the room. "What initiative," a
man near her said with admiration.
In Twain, one man snorted as the latest
gubernatorial returns flashed on the screen. "I had a
friend who voted for Catfish Hunter," he said. "He
voted for Vida Blue for attorney general."
The man beside him laughed—a little. Then he
was silent. It was not a night for humor.
