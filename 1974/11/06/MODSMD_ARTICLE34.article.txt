# Gloom Envelops GOP Diehards
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"Sad, real sad," murmurs Alice
Miller as she stares at the tiny screen
of the portable television that has just
been plugged in at Palo Alto
Republican Headquarters.
"The Democrats are coming in
pretty much like we thought they
would back East. One of these days
we'll have a miracle."
For Miller and several other loyal
Republicans gathered before the
television, the Republican miracle of
1972 seems very far away. It is only 6
p.m. and news of a near-total
Democratic sweep east of the
Mississippi reaches Palo Alto before
the local polls have closed.
Undaunted, the Republicans
remaining at the Palo Alto
headquarters answer phones and look
up phone numbers, cross-referencing
precinct lists in a last-minute effort to
get Republicans to the polls.
"We've got to work like the devil to
make up for the lopsided ratio," says
Hugh March of the area's two-to-one
Democratic registration.
Veteran Volunteer
March is a member of the Santa
Clara County Republican Committee
and a veteran of many campaigns,
having first become active in the
Young Republicans in 1960 while
attending Stanford.
From the University Avenue
headquarters, volunteers are either
assigned to walk door-to-door in
heavily Republican precincts or to call
those Republicans who haven't voted
from telephone banks.
"They're not supposed to come
back here until every Republican in
the precinct has voted or it's 8 p.m.,
whichever happens first," explains
March.
Heavy Turnout
"There's a heavy turnout in Orange
County," interjects March's wife
Carol, who is listening to the radio.
"Up seven percent from the last
election."
"That's fhe best news I've had all
day," answers Mr. March.
As the minutes tick past, the
television proclaims the statistics on
various Republican debacles. Each
report is greeted with a new expression
of disgust, but all the comments are
good-natured.
"Good grief," exclaims Verdie
Alsop, clad in red, white and blue,

staring at the screen. "They're all
Democrats so far."
"It's going according to all the
predictions," concedes Mr. March. "If
we thought we were going to win, it'd
be depressing."
Wrong Lever?
"Sometimes," sighs Miller, "the
results make you think you pulled the
wrong lever."
By 6:15 p.m., the news media are
busily broadcasting projections of
Democratic vengeance some two hours
before the California polls close. The
Republicans do not criticize the
Democrats, saving their wrath for
those reporting the election results.
"I personally don't think there
should be any national profiles
developed until the last polls have
closed," argues Mr. March.
Like canvassers for George
McGovern in 1972, the Republican
workers are listening to a political
landslide in the making as polls close
across the country, leaving
Californians to watch the dust settle.

"We'll be fighting Watergate for the
next hundred years," says Miller.
At about 6:20 p.m., Meldrid
Thompson is declared the first
Republican victor of the evening,
retaining his post as governor of New
Hampshire. Everyone is pleased in the
tiny Palo Alto headquarters, but no
one really cheers.
Volunteers continue to trickle in
and out of the building. "This is
what's known as getting the generals
out in the trenches," declares Roman
Buhler, a sometime Stanford student.
By 7:30 p.m. the Republican
workers have started moving the
furniture out of their offices. The
posters, flyers and precinct lists are
being boxed up. Only Buhler and
another young worker, Ed Anderson,
continue to use the red, white and
blue phones.
'On one of the darkest days in
Republican history, a worker sums up
the last-minute efforts at 7:55 p.m.
"I think I'll go home and go to bed
and forget the whole thing."
