# McCloskey Routs Gillmor
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) scored a landslide
victory yesterday over Santa Clara
Mayor Gary Gillmor in the 12th
Congressional District.
With approximately 92 percent of
the vote counted, McCloskey had won
115,779 votes, or 69.8 percent of the
total. Gillmor garnered 50,507 votes.
McCloskey swept both heavily
Democratic Santa Clara County and
traditionally Republican San Mateo
County. He expressed surprise at the
magnitude of his victory.
McCloskey's winning margin this
year overshadowed his victory in the
1972 congressional race when he
utfeated James Stewart by receiving
61 percent of the vote.
McCloskey told the Daily last night

that he "hopes to work for meaningful
reform" in Congress during the next
two years, reaffirming his contention
that the 94th Congress has a real
chance of restoring Congress as a
powerful and progressive force in
national life.
Not Only Maverick
Addressing several hundred elated
supporters at Rickey's Hyatt House in
Palo Alto, McCloskey declared that he
hopes his victory "will put me in a
position in Washington to be not just a
maverick but to be a leader."
McCloskey later asserted however,
that he will continue to criticize the
GOP Administration when he feels
criticism is necessary. He also noted
that lie plans to vote to override
President Ford's recent veto of the
Freedom of Information Act.

Calling his race against Gillmor "a
dull campaign," McCloskey accused
his opponent of bypassing the
discussion of important economic
issues in order to concentrate on
personal attacks.
McCloskey claimed that his
numerous debates with Gillmor failed
to reach any substantive discussion of
subjects such as national health
insurance, the balanced budget and
tax reform.
'More Initiative'
But Wade Brummel, Gillmor's
campaign manager, insisted that
McCloskey "wanted to choose his own
issues." He emphasized that
McCloskey, as the incumbent, should
have taken more of an initiative in
starting any intellectual exchange.
Conceding defeat in Sunnyvale,
Gillmor said that "the Democrats
didn't support me in this area. They
think that McCloskey is a Democrat."
Gillmor attributed his defeat in part
to his agreement with McCloskey to
limit spending to $15,000. He added
he will spend more money if he runs
again for Congress.
Great For Country
McCloskey termed the national
results of the congressional races "a
great thing for the country" despite
the Democratic landslide.
McCloskey mentioned that his main
disappointment with the course of the
national campaign was the
predominant discussion of past records
and old, moot issues instead of more
substantive ones.
Noting that many "bad"
congressmen were defeated while most
"good" congressmen retained their
seats, McCloskey stated that the
youthful composition of the new
Congress may enable liberals to end
the seniority system.
Future
"I'm more excited about the future
than at any time in my seven years in
Congress," McCloskey said.
Referring to his own political
future, McCloskey said he has no time
now to think about retirement. He
declared during the campaign that he
may retire to his law practice after one
more term in Congress.
