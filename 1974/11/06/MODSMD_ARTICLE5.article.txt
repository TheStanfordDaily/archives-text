# Proposition 17 Fails
## 
### DON COX 
California voters yesterday rejected
the controversial state Proposition 17,
designed to halt the construction of
the 62-story $270 million New
Melones dam on the Stanislaus River.
By a 54 to 46 percent margin,
voters refused to go on record as
opposing the dam project, which,
when completed, will inundate a
nine-mile stretch of white w.ater
popular with rafters and
conservationists.
Though the measure attracted the
most attention and campaign money
of any of the propositions, the voters'
decision on it isn't legally binding
since the dam is a federal project.
The controversy over the dam still
may not be over because of the
election yesterday of Edmund G.
Brown Jr. as governor. In the past, the
federal government has often refrained
from construction of such projects if
they are opposed by the state's
governor. Brown has gone on record as
opposing the dam.
Though the measure received a large
favorable vote early in the evening, the
proposition lost support fast when late
returns poured in this morning.

Prop. 17 was among five of the 17
state propositions rejected by voters
yesterday.
Prop. 16, which would have
empowered the legislature in place of
the regents to determine the amount
of tuition charged students at the
University of. California, was voted
down by a 60 to 40 percent vote.
Voters refused to approve Prop. 15
and thereby repeal a requirement that
development of low rent housing
projects be approved by a vote of the
people.
Also rejected was Prop. 14, which
would have added the president pro
tempore of the state Senate to the
state University board of trustees. It
failed by 49 to 51 percent.
The other measure rejected by the
voters was for the exemption of four
members of the Postsecondary
Education Commission from the civil
service system, Prop. 3. It was rejected
by a 43 to 57 percent vote.
Charter cities and counties may no
longer require their employees to live
within their boundaries following the
voters' approval yesterday of Prop. 5,
which prohibits such requirements.
The measure was approved by a 60 to
40 percent margin.
Convicted ex-felons will be able to
regain their right to vote upon
completion of their sentences and
parole as a result of voter approval of
Prop. 10.
Voters had apparently narrowly
approved Prop. 11, which changes
terms in the masculine gender to the
neuter in the state constitution.
Despite the current economic
slump, Prop. 1, a $l5O million school
bond, received an overwhelming 60
percent approval by the voters.
With 55 percent of the voters
consenting, Prop. 4, adding one
student and one faculty member to
the University of California Board of
Regents, was adopted.
Prop. 2 received the widest margin
of approval by the voters 73
percent. The measure, eliminated
legislature approval now required for
city and county charter amendments
which have been approved by the
voters.

yesterday.
Prop. 16, which would have
empowered the legislature in place of
the regents to determine the amount
of tuition charged students at the
University of. California, was voted
down by a 60 to 40 percent vote.
Voters refused to approve Prop. 15
and thereby repeal a requirement that
development of low rent housing
projects be approved by a vote of the
people.
Also rejected was Prop. 14, which
would have added the president pro
tempore of the state Senate to the
state University board of trustees. It
failed by 49 to 51 percent.
The other measure rejected by the
voters was for the exemption of four
members of the Postsecondary
Education Commission from the civil
service system, Prop. 3. It was rejected
by a 43 to 57 percent vote.
Charter cities and counties may no
longer require their employees to live
within their boundaries following the
voters' approval yesterday of Prop. 5,
which prohibits such requirements.
The measure was approved by a 60 to
40 percent margin.
Convicted ex-felons will be able to
regain their right to vote upon
completion of their sentences and
parole as a result of voter approval of
Prop. 10.
Voters had apparently narrowly
approved Prop. 11, which changes
terms in the masculine gender to the
neuter in the state constitution.
Despite the current economic
slump, Prop. 1, a $l5O million school
bond, received an overwhelming 60
percent approval by the voters.
With 55 percent of the voters
consenting, Prop. 4, adding one
student and one faculty member to
the University of California Board of
Regents, was adopted.
Prop. 2 received the widest margin
of approval by the voters 73
percent. The measure, eliminated
legislature approval now required for
city and county charter amendments
which have been approved by the
voters.
California voters yesterday rejected
the controversial state Proposition 17,
designed to halt the construction of
the 62-story $270 million New
Melones dam on the Stanislaus River.
By a 54 to 46 percent margin,
voters refused to go on record as
opposing the dam project, which,
when completed, will inundate a
nine-mile stretch of white w.ater
popular with rafters and
conservationists.
Though the measure attracted the
most attention and campaign money
of any of the propositions, the voters'
decision on it isn't legally binding
since the dam is a federal project.
The controversy over the dam still
may not be over because of the
election yesterday of Edmund G.
Brown Jr. as governor. In the past, the
federal government has often refrained
from construction of such projects if
they are opposed by the state's
governor. Brown has gone on record as
opposing the dam.
Though the measure received a large
favorable vote early in the evening, the
proposition lost support fast when late
returns poured in this morning.

Prop. 17 was among five of the 17
