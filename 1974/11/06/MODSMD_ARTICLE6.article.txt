# Nation's Welfare Entrusted To Democrats
## 
### JIM WASCHER News Analysis 
The electorate has asked the
Democratic Party to haul the nation
out of its current predicament. Should
the Democrats fail, they could be in
very serious trouble come 1976.
The voters appear to have blamed
President Ford and the members of his
party for an economy racked by both
worsening recession and rising
unemployment. During their
campaigns, many Democrats
complained about the situation, but
few suggested any real solutions. They
must settle upon a game plan quickly
if they are to retain the mandate
which they received yesterday.
It is, therefore, quite probable that
the newly elected 94th Congress will
offer a number of innovative solutions
to problems ranging far beyond the
economy. This Congress, after all, will
be the youngest and most liberal one
in at least 10 years.
In fact, many observers predicted
prior to the election that the new
Congress will be quite similar to
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal
Congress of 1933-34 and to Lyndon B.
Johnson's Great Society Congress of
1965-66.

Neither of these Demo
crat-dominated Congresses, though,
had to contend with a President from
the opposite party. Some pundits
contend that the new Congress will be
veto-proof, severely limiting Ford's
influence over the course of national
affairs.
Not Cohesive
These observers ignore the fact that
House Democrats are far from an
ideologically cohesive block, and that
the party doesn't even have the
two-thirds majority in the Senate
required to override vetoes.
No,, the 94th Congress won't be
veto-proof, but, if it listens to the
voters, the days of legislative
subservience to the executive are
certainly at an end.
Republicans who blithely followed
Richard Nixon along the garden path
of Watergate went down to defeat
across the nation. Four of the former
President's staunchest defenders on
the House Judiciary Committee lost to
Democratic challengers.
And Indiana Congressman Earl F.
Landgrebe, who once proclaimed:
"Don't confuse me with the facts"
about Watergate, also fell.
So most Democrats and numerous

Republicans in the new Congress will
consciously assert their power, and
continue the recent process of
restoring the Constitutional balance
between the branches of the
government.
Congressional Reform
And, if Pete McCloskey is to be
believed, the members of the 94th
Congress will also be concerned with
putting their own houses in order.
McCloskey last night predicted that
the Congress will be "bipartisan for
reform right down the line"â€”including
a possible bid to scrap the seniority
system.
Regardless of Congress' success at
nation-molding, yesterday's election
seems to have produced a covey of
potential presidential candidates for
the Democrats: And, for the first time
since the 1950s many of these
contenders will be governors.
The nation's two most populous
states California and New York
will have Democratic governors again,
and both Edmund G. Brown Jr. and
Hugh L. Carey must be regarded
seriously in the Democrats' 1976
sweepstakes. Then, of course, there's a
man named George Corley Wallace,

who won an unprecedented third term
in Alabama's statehouse.
The re-election of Senators George
McGovern and Birch Bayh, and the
elevation of Arkansas Gov. Dale
Bumpers to the Senate also pushed
these three further into the national
spotlight.
McGovern Forgiven
Yesterday's returns also indicate
that the voters may have forgotten the
radicalism they perceived in the
George McGovern's 1972 presidential
campaign.
Missourians returned McGovern's
first running mate, Thomas F.
Eagleton, to the Senate for a second
term and replaced a conservative
Republican incumbent in Colorado
with McGovern campaign manager
Gary Hart. And Jerry Apodaca, a
veteran of the McGovern effort in New
Mexico., was elected as the new
governor there.
The voters again demonstrated that
money talks in politics. Almost
uniformly, the biggest spenders in the
key races around the country won
those races. Ironically, most of these
big spenders were liberal Democrats

who had pointed accusing fingers at
the heavy contributions to Nixon's
re-election bid.
The most expensive Senate
campaign in the nation was run by
California's own Alan Cranston, who
narrowly edged McGovern in the
spend-a-thon. Ohio Democrat John H.
Glenn was third. All three won.
GOP Still Alive
Is the Republican Party dying?
Hardly. Know-it-alls counted the GOP
out after the Goldwater debacle of
1964, too, and then 1966 turned out
to be the party's greatest triumph
since the days of Dwight Eisenhower.
Richard Nixon himself was
responsible for the collapse of his
dream for a new Republican majority.
But Nixon is gone now and the
Democrats must succeed on their own.
By 1976, the voters largely will have
forgotten Nixon and the Watergate
scandals which grew around him.
What the nation will watch,
however, will be the efforts of
Democrats to find a set of policies
which will salvage a foundering
America. The outcome of the 1976
elections will rest on their success or
failure.
