# Nation's Welfare Entrusted To Democrats
## 
### JIM WASCHER News Analysis 
The electorate has asked the
Democratic Party to haul the nation
out of its current predicament. Should
the Democrats fail, they could be in
very serious trouble come 1976.
The voters appear to have blamed
President Ford and the members of his
party for an economy racked by both
worsening recession and rising
unemployment. During their
campaigns, many Democrats
complained about the situation, but
few suggested any real solutions. They
must settle upon a game plan quickly
if they are to retain the mandate
which they received yesterday.
It is, therefore, quite probable that
the newly elected 94th Congress will
offer a number of innovative solutions
to problems ranging far beyond the
economy. This Congress, after all, will
be the youngest and most liberal one
in at least 10 years.
In fact, many observers predicted
prior to the election that the new
Congress will be quite similar to
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal
Congress of 1933-34 and to Lyndon B.
Johnson's Great Society Congress of
1965-66.

Neither of these Demo
crat-dominated Congresses, though,
had to contend with a President from
the opposite party. Some pundits
contend that the new Congress will be
veto-proof, severely limiting Ford's
influence over the course of national
affairs.
Not Cohesive
These observers ignore the fact that
House Democrats are far from an
ideologically cohesive block, and that
the party doesn't even have the
two-thirds majority in the Senate
required to override vetoes.
No,, the 94th Congress won't be
veto-proof, but, if it listens to the
voters, the days of legislative
subservience to the executive are
certainly at an end.
Republicans who blithely followed
Richard Nixon along the garden path
of Watergate went down to defeat
across the nation. Four of the former
President's staunchest defenders on
the House Judiciary Committee lost to
Democratic challengers.
And Indiana Congressman Earl F.
Landgrebe, who once proclaimed:
"Don't confuse me with the facts"
about Watergate, also fell.
So most Democrats and numerous

Republicans in the new Congress will
consciously assert their power, and
continue the recent process of
restoring the Constitutional balance
between the branches of the
government.
Congressional Reform
And, if Pete McCloskey is to be
believed, the members of the 94th
Congress will also be concerned with
putting their own houses in order.
McCloskey last night predicted that
the Congress will be "bipartisan for
reform right down the line"—including
a possible bid to scrap the seniority
system.
Regardless of Congress' success at
nation-molding, yesterday's election
seems to have produced a covey of
potential presidential candidates for
the Democrats: And, for the first time
since the 1950s many of these
contenders will be governors.
The nation's two most populous
states California and New York
will have Democratic governors again,
and both Edmund G. Brown Jr. and
Hugh L. Carey must be regarded
seriously in the Democrats' 1976
sweepstakes. Then, of course, there's a
man named George Corley Wallace,
