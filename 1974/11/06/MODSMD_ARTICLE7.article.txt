# Gregorio, Calvo Breeze
## 
### MARK FUNK 
Incumbent Democratic state Sen.
Arlen Gregorio was returned to
Sacramento for a second term
yesterday as voters in Santa Clara and
San Mateo Counties gave him a
decisive two-to-one electoral majority.
Also elected was Victor Calvo, a
Mountain View Democrat and
currently Santa Clara County
supervisor, in the 21st Assembly
District. He will be serving in the
California legislature for the first time.
Gregorio, who was campaigning in
the newly re-apportioned 10th
Senatorial District, easily defeated
Republican lawyer James Tormey Jr.
of San Mateo. With 95 percent of the
vote counted, Gregorio had 68 percent
of the total. Voter turnout in the two
counties was described by election
officials as "average."
Calvo outdistanced Republican
challenger Clarence Jackson Jr., an
East Palo Alto Municipal councilman
69 to 31 percent.
Gregorio Speech
A longtime advocate of campaign
spending reform, Gregorio told
supporters at his Menlo Park election

headquarters, "I'm proud that we
waged a campaign without one
contribution from business groups,
lobbyists or special interest groups. We
had modest gifts from individuals.
What made this campaign was the
hundreds of individuals who proved
that good government works in
America."
The senator went on to say that he
intends to continue sponsoring
legislation designed to streamline
California state government and would
push for passage of a proposal creating
a unicameral legislature. He listed
"reform legislation" at the top of his
list of priorities for the next four
years.
In other areas, Gregorio reiterated
his commitment to the expansion of
the state's alcoholism rehabilitation
program, the fine arts, public housing
and the development of more
recreational areas.
Education
Noting what he termed "the poor
state of our educational system,"
Gregorio said that issue would also be
one of his chief concerns in
Sacramento. Opponent Tormey based
much of his campaign on the issue of

education and was quite critical of the
senator's voting record.
Expressing pleasure at the election
victory of Edmund G. Brown Jr., the
senator said he felt the 36-year-old
former Secretary of State would make
"a fine governor. The real question is
what the state Senate will look like,"
he explained. "If we can just get a
majority of good guys, and by that I
mean Republicans and not just
Democrats, we will make great strides
during the next four years."
Early returns from San Mateo, a
nominally Republican county, saw
Gregorio build the two-to-one margin
that was to stay relatively constant
throughout the night. Tormey never
challenged seriously.
In Mountain View, Calvo too was
making victory speeches.
Easy Landslide
Also running in a newly
reapportioned district, the former
mayor of Mountain View rode the
crest of a state-wide Democratic
landslide to gain an Assembly seat in
his first attempt. Running in a district
with a 54 percent to 38 percent
Democratic registration margin, Calvo
had little trouble outpolling the GOP
candidate Jackson.
When asked to assess the effect of
the Democratic sweep and Brown's
victory on his campaign, Calvo said it
was to early to tell, although he
thought the fact that his campaign was
"conducted in an open fashion may
have been one of the important factors
contributing to my win."
The new assemblyman also said that
he would fall back on his "broad
experience in local government"
during his first term.
Push For Programs
Calvo said during his speech that he
would push for programs in public
transportation, environmental and
humanitarian programs designed to
help "consumers and those in need of
public housing."
Calvo's victory was almost identical
to Gregorio's. Taking a two-to-one
lead during counting of absentee
ballots and early returns from
southern Santa Clara, Calvo was able
to maintain that count the rest of the
night.

In other local races, William M.
Bennett, Democratic candidate for
State Board of Equalization, easily
withstood a challenge from Tally P.
Mastrangelo, winning with 65 percent.

Nannette G. Hanko was re-elected
to the Mid-peninsula Regional Park
District. She ran unopposed.

lobbyists or special interest groups. We
had modest gifts from individuals.
What made this campaign was the
hundreds of individuals who proved
that good government works in
America."
The senator went on to say that he
intends to continue sponsoring
legislation designed to streamline
California state government and would
push for passage of a proposal creating
a unicameral legislature. He listed
"reform legislation" at the top of his
list of priorities for the next four
years.
In other areas, Gregorio reiterated
his commitment to the expansion of
the state's alcoholism rehabilitation
program, the fine arts, public housing
and the development of more
recreational areas.
Education
Noting what he termed "the poor
state of our educational system,"
Gregorio said that issue would also be
one of his chief concerns in
Sacramento. Opponent Tormey based
much of his campaign on the issue of

education and was quite critical of the
senator's voting record.
Expressing pleasure at the election
victory of Edmund G. Brown Jr., the
senator said he felt the 36-year-old
former Secretary of State would make
"a fine governor. The real question is
what the state Senate will look like,"
he explained. "If we can just get a
majority of good guys, and by that I
mean Republicans and not just
Democrats, we will make great strides
during the next four years."
Early returns from San Mateo, a
nominally Republican county, saw
Gregorio build the two-to-one margin
that was to stay relatively constant
throughout the night. Tormey never
challenged seriously.
In Mountain View, Calvo too was
making victory speeches.
Easy Landslide
Also running in a newly
reapportioned district, the former
mayor of Mountain View rode the
crest of a state-wide Democratic
landslide to gain an Assembly seat in
his first attempt. Running in a district
with a 54 percent to 38 percent
Democratic registration margin, Calvo
had little trouble outpolling the GOP
candidate Jackson.
When asked to assess the effect of
the Democratic sweep and Brown's
victory on his campaign, Calvo said it
was to early to tell, although he
thought the fact that his campaign was
"conducted in an open fashion may
have been one of the important factors
contributing to my win."
The new assemblyman also said that
he would fall back on his "broad
experience in local government"
during his first term.
Push For Programs
Calvo said during his speech that he
would push for programs in public
transportation, environmental and
humanitarian programs designed to
help "consumers and those in need of
public housing."
Calvo's victory was almost identical
to Gregorio's. Taking a two-to-one
lead during counting of absentee
ballots and early returns from
southern Santa Clara, Calvo was able
to maintain that count the rest of the
night.

In other local races, William M.
Bennett, Democratic candidate for
State Board of Equalization, easily
withstood a challenge from Tally P.
Mastrangelo, winning with 65 percent.

Nannette G. Hanko was re-elected
to the Mid-peninsula Regional Park
District. She ran unopposed.

GOING TO SACRAMENTO—Arlen Gregorio (left) accepts congratulations by telephone after being re-elected to the state
Senate last night. Another Democrat, Victor Calvo, was elected to his first term in the state Assembly.
Incumbent Democratic state Sen.
Arlen Gregorio was returned to
Sacramento for a second term
yesterday as voters in Santa Clara and
San Mateo Counties gave him a
decisive two-to-one electoral majority.
Also elected was Victor Calvo, a
Mountain View Democrat and
currently Santa Clara County
supervisor, in the 21st Assembly
District. He will be serving in the
California legislature for the first time.
Gregorio, who was campaigning in
the newly re-apportioned 10th
Senatorial District, easily defeated
Republican lawyer James Tormey Jr.
of San Mateo. With 95 percent of the
vote counted, Gregorio had 68 percent
of the total. Voter turnout in the two
counties was described by election
officials as "average."
Calvo outdistanced Republican
challenger Clarence Jackson Jr., an
East Palo Alto Municipal councilman
69 to 31 percent.

spending reform, Gregorio told

"a fine governor. The real question is
what the state Senate will look like,"
he explained. "If we can just get a
majority of good guys, and by that I
mean Republicans and not just
Democrats, we will make great strides
during the next four years."
Early returns from San Mateo, a
nominally Republican county, saw
Gregorio build the two-to-one margin
that was to stay relatively constant
throughout the night. Tormey never
challenged seriously.
In Mountain View, Calvo too was
making victory speeches.
Easy Landslide
Also running in a newly
reapportioned district, the former
mayor of Mountain View rode the
crest of a state-wide Democratic
landslide to gain an Assembly seat in
his first attempt. Running in a district
with a 54 percent to 38 percent
Democratic registration margin, Calvo
had little trouble outpolling the GOP
candidate Jackson.
When asked to assess the effect of
the Democratic sweep and Brown's
victory on his campaign, Calvo said it
was to early to tell, although he
thought the fact that his campaign was
"conducted in an open fashion may
have been one of the important factors
contributing to my win."
The new assemblyman also said that
he would fall back on his "broad
experience in local government"
during his first term.
Push For Programs
Calvo said during his speech that he
would push for programs in public
transportation, environmental and
humanitarian programs designed to
help "consumers and those in need of
public housing."
Calvo's victory was almost identical
to Gregorio's. Taking a two-to-one
lead during counting of absentee
ballots and early returns from
southern Santa Clara, Calvo was able
to maintain that count the rest of the
night.

In other local races, William M.
Bennett, Democratic candidate for
State Board of Equalization, easily
withstood a challenge from Tally P.
Mastrangelo, winning with 65 percent.

Nannette G. Hanko was re-elected
to the Mid-peninsula Regional Park
District. She ran unopposed.
