# Nine Percent Tuition Increase Necessary
## Officials Detail Financial Woes 
### DON COX 
Vice Provost for Budget and Planning Ray Bacchetti told
a group of University officials yesterday that departments
will "have to sharpen their explanations about their
function and role in the University" as Stanford embarks
on a $lO million dollar budget-cutting program.
Addressing 150 administrators, faculty members and
student representatives in Bishop Auditorium, Bacchetti
said there "is always a tendency in bad times to look for a
scapegoat. We must resist this and bring our intelligence and
goodwill to bear on the problem."
Bacchetti and other University business and finance
officials addressed the meeting as part of a move to
acquaint the Stanford community with the seriousTinancial
problems it faces.
University expenditures are currently increasing at an
annual rate of about 11.4 percent, but income is increasing
at only 5.7 percent. This gap between expenses and income,
if allowed to go unchecked, would result in a $22 million
deficit in five years, Bacchetti said.
Tuition Increases
The expense and income rates will be brought back into
line with each other by cutting $lO million over the next
three years.Tuition increases of nine percent or more for the
next five years will be necessary to establish a long-range
financial equilibrium, Bacchetti said.
Faculty salaries will increase an average of 6.9 percent
annually. Financial aid will increase by 23 percent as the

University attempts to limit the impact of rising tuition
prices on the middle class.
Even if the budget is brought into equilibrium in 1980,
Vice Provost for Research William Massy said tuition will
"have to continue to grow at a rate 4 percent over that of
inflation," according to his projections.
Massy also noted that it would take "substantial
increases in tuition" in order to fund many new programs
or improvements beyond these planned.
Assured Income
The payout rate from the endowment will be reduced
from the current six percent to near 4.5 percent. Thus,
assuring continued support from this income source, he
said.
Of the $lO million to be cut from the budget over the
next three years, about 25 percent will be cut in 1975-76,
60 percent in 1976-77 and 15 percent in 1977-78, Massy
said.
"We must allow adequate time for discussion and
planning, but we must also minimize the high price of delay
and resolve the situation as quickly as we can," said
Bacchetti.
"The institution will certainly have to undergo some
changes," said Provost William Miller. "But Stanford will
remain a strong, viable institution, though it may be a little
bit different."
Miller said that most other private institutions like
Stanford "are experiencing the same problem."
