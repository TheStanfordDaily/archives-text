The actual construction costs of the
three new row houses will be between
$2.4 and $2.5 million, Senior
University Planner Robert Nerrie told
a group of students last night.
Nerrie said the $3.6 million figure is
f the total project cost which
"encompasses everything, including
administrative and legal costs,
architect fees, furnishing costs, survey
costs and other items of this sort."
Most of the figures that have been
used regarding other housing
developments and theif comparative
costs are not the project costs, but
rather those of just construction,
Nerrie emphasized.
If the total cost of the emeritus
housing project is used, Nerrie noted,
it would be quite close to the $58 per
square foot being expended for the
three houses.
Student Committee
Nerrie presented these cost factors
at a meeting set up by the Student
Advisory Committee to answer
questions about the planned
construction of the new row houses.
Co-chairpersons David Garvin and
Ann Carter, along with Nerrie,
discussed the basic idea of the plan
and tried to clear up some
misconceptions that people held abput
it.
Contrary to popular perceptions
about the Row houses, Nerrie said
Row houses are actually cheaper to
construct than any other type of
housing structure.
The proposed houses will be
all-wood structures, the least expensive
type to build, he said.
Other Materials
Nerrie explained that to construct a
large building, regulations demand
other materials, such as cement and
steel, be used. These other materials
force the cost up tremendously, he
added.
"There is a definite savings to be
effected by consolidating all of the
community facilities, such as the
dining room and lounge, within one
building and not triplicating them,"
he said.
"Yet, because of the increased costs
of this larger building, it is equally or
