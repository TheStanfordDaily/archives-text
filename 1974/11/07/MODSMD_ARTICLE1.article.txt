# Row House Construction: $2.5 Million
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The actual construction costs of the
three new row houses will be between
$2.4 and $2.5 million, Senior
University Planner Robert Nerrie told
a group of students last night.
Nerrie said the $3.6 million figure is
f the total project cost which
"encompasses everything, including
administrative and legal costs,
architect fees, furnishing costs, survey
costs and other items of this sort."
Most of the figures that have been
used regarding other housing
developments and theif comparative
costs are not the project costs, but
rather those of just construction,
Nerrie emphasized.
If the total cost of the emeritus
housing project is used, Nerrie noted,
it would be quite close to the $58 per
square foot being expended for the
three houses.
Student Committee
Nerrie presented these cost factors
at a meeting set up by the Student
Advisory Committee to answer
questions about the planned
construction of the new row houses.
Co-chairpersons David Garvin and
Ann Carter, along with Nerrie,
discussed the basic idea of the plan
and tried to clear up some
misconceptions that people held abput
it.
Contrary to popular perceptions
about the Row houses, Nerrie said
Row houses are actually cheaper to
construct than any other type of
housing structure.
The proposed houses will be
all-wood structures, the least expensive
type to build, he said.
Other Materials
Nerrie explained that to construct a
large building, regulations demand
other materials, such as cement and
steel, be used. These other materials
force the cost up tremendously, he
added.
"There is a definite savings to be
effected by consolidating all of the
community facilities, such as the
dining room and lounge, within one
building and not triplicating them,"
he said.
"Yet, because of the increased costs
of this larger building, it is equally or
very nearly equally as expensive to
build as the smaller houses. Even if the
cost is 5 percent less for the large
house, is it worth sacrificing the
benefits that individual houses offer
for such slight savings?" Nerrie
questioned.
Kitchen Costs
Neerie said a study he conducted
indicated that the initial construction
costs of three kitchens would be
greater than the costs of constructing a
large one. However, if these smaller
kitchens are house-run, they would be
cheaper to operate, he remarked.
Additionally, house-run food
services permit much more flexibility
in planning and food selection, he
commented
As the project now stands, three
new Row houses will be built by
September 1976, each house
accomodating 50 people. Current
thought places these houses between
Campus Drive and Mayfield, adjoining
the fraternity cluster.
The final site for the three houses is

scheduled to be approved in
December, with the basic architectural
plans to be submitted that month also,
Nerrie said.
Final Recommendations
The committee is scheduled to
present its final recommendations to
the University Board of Trustee's
Committee on Land and Building next
week.
Committee members stressed that
the project has not been given final
approval yet.
"In the eyes of many
administrators, this plan is of
secondary priority," Carter said.
But committee members pointed
out that construction of the individual
houses is better adapted to a
fund-raising campaign. Persuading
contributors to donate money may be
easier of they can see where their
money is going almost immediately,
they said.
"Considering the size of the houses,
they could even be dedicated to
individual contributors," one
committee member suggested.

University Planner Robert Nerrie told
a group of students last night.
Nerrie said the $3.6 million figure is
f the total project cost which
"encompasses everything, including
administrative and legal costs,
architect fees, furnishing costs, survey
costs and other items of this sort."
Most of the figures that have been
used regarding other housing
developments and theif comparative
costs are not the project costs, but
rather those of just construction,
Nerrie emphasized.
If the total cost of the emeritus
housing project is used, Nerrie noted,
it would be quite close to the $58 per
square foot being expended for the
three houses.
Student Committee
Nerrie presented these cost factors
at a meeting set up by the Student
Advisory Committee to answer
questions about the planned
construction of the new row houses.
Co-chairpersons David Garvin and
Ann Carter, along with Nerrie,
discussed the basic idea of the plan
and tried to clear up some
misconceptions that people held abput
it.
Contrary to popular perceptions
about the Row houses, Nerrie said
Row houses are actually cheaper to
construct than any other type of
housing structure.
The proposed houses will be
all-wood structures, the least expensive
type to build, he said.
Other Materials
Nerrie explained that to construct a
large building, regulations demand
other materials, such as cement and
steel, be used. These other materials
force the cost up tremendously, he
added.
"There is a definite savings to be
effected by consolidating all of the
community facilities, such as the
dining room and lounge, within one
building and not triplicating them,"
he said.
"Yet, because of the increased costs
of this larger building, it is equally or
very nearly equally as expensive to
build as the smaller houses. Even if the
cost is 5 percent less for the large
house, is it worth sacrificing the
benefits that individual houses offer
for such slight savings?" Nerrie
questioned.
Kitchen Costs
Neerie said a study he conducted
indicated that the initial construction
costs of three kitchens would be
greater than the costs of constructing a
large one. However, if these smaller
kitchens are house-run, they would be
cheaper to operate, he remarked.
Additionally, house-run food
services permit much more flexibility
in planning and food selection, he
commented
As the project now stands, three
new Row houses will be built by
September 1976, each house
accomodating 50 people. Current
thought places these houses between
Campus Drive and Mayfield, adjoining
the fraternity cluster.
The final site for the three houses is

scheduled to be approved in
December, with the basic architectural
plans to be submitted that month also,
Nerrie said.
Final Recommendations
The committee is scheduled to
present its final recommendations to
the University Board of Trustee's
Committee on Land and Building next
week.
Committee members stressed that
the project has not been given final
approval yet.
"In the eyes of many
administrators, this plan is of
secondary priority," Carter said.
But committee members pointed
out that construction of the individual
houses is better adapted to a
fund-raising campaign. Persuading
contributors to donate money may be
easier of they can see where their
money is going almost immediately,
they said.
"Considering the size of the houses,
they could even be dedicated to
individual contributors," one
committee member suggested.
The actual construction costs of the
three new row houses will be between
$2.4 and $2.5 million, Senior
University Planner Robert Nerrie told
a group of students last night.
Nerrie said the $3.6 million figure is
f the total project cost which
"encompasses everything, including
administrative and legal costs,
