# Judge's Actions Threaten Justice

What is the purpose of a criminal trial?
To the Constitution, to the law and to
reasonable men a trial exists for the sole
purpose of determining the guilt or
innocence of the accused.
But to Federal District Court Judge John
J. Sirica, a trail means something else
altogether. It exists, as he told the jury in the
current Watergate cover-up trail in
Washington, "to find the truth."
(Lest the 12 jurors misunderstand him,
Sirica spelled it out: "T-R-U-T-H, truth.")
Thus, Sirica added, he will not attempt
"to try this case on strict rules of evidence."
Sirica seems intent on bringing out in
open court former President Richard Nixon's
role in the conspiracy to obstruct justice
allegedly carried on by the Nixon White
House.
A Noble Intention
This is, in some sense, a noble intention,
and the public has an undeniable right to
know how deeply the former President was
involved. Unfortunately, President Ford has
effectively eliminated the role of the
judiciary in such a determination, via his
"full, free and absolute" pardon of Nixon.
Judge Sirica, therefore, should leave that
problem to other branches of government,
and concentrate on the matter at hand. The
matter at hand is seeing that the five
defendants former White House aides H.R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, former
Attorney General John Mitchell and former
employees of the Committee to Re-elect the
President Kenneth Parkinson and Robert
Mardian receive a fair trial.

Sirica is there to see that justice is done.
Former New York Times reporter and
current Yale Law School student Robert
Smith recently argued in the Times that a
judge "has a duty to call or examine
witnesses (emphasis in original)."
'Elicit The Truth'
He cited a U.S. Appeals Court decision
that a judge is no "mere presiding officer"
but must maintain "a view to eliciting the
truth, and to attaining justice between the
parties."
He concluded that if "he | Judge Sirica]
doesn't push for the truth, we may never
learn what it is," and attacked
"law-and-order conservatives who have had a
sudden seizure of sympathy for (these
particular) defendants."
But S>mith, like other defenders of Sirica's
conduct'; errs. One needn't be a
"law-and-order conservative" to find fault
with the judge.
Perhaps part of the analysis fit the trial of
the original Watergate burglars. There, the
government's case was so ridiculously
superficial and incredible that there was no
other way to attain "justice between the
parties."
A Powerful Case
But that is no longer true. The Special
Prosecutor's Office has built a powerful case.
That case revolves around the testimony of
Presidential Counsel John W.Dean 111,
the White House tapes and the government's
not-so-subtle attempts to divide the
defendants against one another. '

Sirica, often maligned as a "hanging
judge" before he became the darling of so
many alleged liberals, seems intent on
discrediting Dean's testimony. At one point,
Sirica suggested to the jury that the defense
had done a "pretty good job" in showing
Dean to be a liar.
By allowing the tapes to be used as
evidence without corrobative testimony
from their former custodian, Nixon, Sirica
has risked having an appeals court overturn
the verdict, should the five be found guilty.
Could Maintain Objectivity
It's possible to search for the truth and
still maintain as much objectivity as possible.
But Sirica's stunning statement (out of the
jury's hearing) that Mitchell "could have
stopped the whole thing" at the beginning
hardly indicates a lack of partisanship.
A lawyer friend tells the story of a judge
in New York City in the 1950s who was
widely criticized for an unfortunate habit:
after a piece of .testimony he considered
dubious, he would turn to the jury with a
look of narrow-eyed incredulity, as if to say,
"If you believe that, you'll believe anything."
But the appeals court rarely overturned
his court's verdicts, because a facial
expression never appears in the offical
record.
With Sirica's uncalled for comments, the
story will probably and unfortunately be
different.
