# Send A Message To Kansas City

### Maria Crummett 
The Democratic Party will be
holding a national convention this
December in Kansas City.
The original purpose of this
meeting was to write a charter for
the party and to supply some
national continuity beyond the
presidential conventions. But now
the National Democratic Interim
Convention is going to be used to
try and wipe out some of the
most significant reforms that
came out of the early 19705.
The old line Democrats (best
represented by such men as
Robert Strauss, the national
chairman, Conally protege
George Meany, head of AFL-CIO
and still pro-war, and Richard
Daley, mayor of Chicago and boss
of the biggest political machine
still running) would like to rollback
the rule changes on Affirmative
Action and Delegate Selection and
they would like to keep the Unit
Rule the same.
Affirmative £| Action is
the program designed to encourage
the participation of women,
youth and minorities in the
Democratic Party. It does not
mean quotas but rather assurances
that everyone will be given an
equal chance to participate.
Generally it involves increasing
democratic decision-making
within the party.
Delegate Selection
Delegate selection requires that
convention delegates be selected
within the calendar year of the
National Convention. This
prevents the stacking of the
convention with party hacks who
owe their allegiance to some
political boss instead of to a
candidate.
The Unit Rule is the
mechanism that gives the winner

of a primary all the delegate votes
from that state. This wipes out
minority opinions as well as
creating delegates who are no
more than rubber stamps.
In a pre-convention planning
meeting, the Black Caucus, the
Youth Caucus and the Women's
Caucus walked out in protest.
Strauss and his people were trying
to turn the convention into a
rubber stamp good only for
ratifying their rule changes.
An Open Convention
It will now be an open
convention. But it all depends on
the delegates. Right now the New
York Times sees it almost exactly

split between the "new politics"
and the old. If you are a registered
Democrat in the 12 th
Congressional District, then your
three delegates to the national
convention will be chosen Nov. 9
at a meeting open to all local
Democrats at Await High School,
in Mountain View. The meeting
will start at-9 a.m. and be over
well before 11:30 a.m.
Almost all of the delegate
candidates are old Democrats.
There are Alioto for Governor
people, AFL-CIO reps and party
functionaries. The only reform
candidates with a chance is the
slate that is coming from
Stanford. JTB • aßiliil

This is Joshua Goldstein, the
founder of Sangha and the
community candidate for Palo
Alto board of Education, Chris
Hables Gray, an anti-war activist
who lives at Columbae and has
been involved in Democratic Party
politics for four years, and Irma
Nogales, a chicana who has been
active in prison counseling and
community work in East Palo
Alto as well as more traditional
political activism.
They need your vote. . . Send a
message to Kansas City.

The Democratic Party will be
holding a national convention this
December in Kansas City.
The original purpose of this
meeting was to write a charter for
the party and to supply some
national continuity beyond the
presidential conventions. But now
the National Democratic Interim
Convention is going to be used to
try and wipe out some of the
most significant reforms that
came out of the early 19705.
The old line Democrats (best
represented by such men as
Robert Strauss, the national
chairman, Conally protege
George Meany, head of AFL-CIO
and still pro-war, and Richard
Daley, mayor of Chicago and boss
of the biggest political machine
still running) would like to rollback
the rule changes on Affirmative
Action and Delegate Selection and
they would like to keep the Unit
Rule the same.
Affirmative £| Action is
the program designed to encourage
the participation of women,
youth and minorities in the
Democratic Party. It does not
mean quotas but rather assurances
that everyone will be given an
equal chance to participate.
Generally it involves increasing
democratic decision-making
within the party.
Delegate Selection
Delegate selection requires that
convention delegates be selected
within the calendar year of the
National Convention. This
prevents the stacking of the
convention with party hacks who
owe their allegiance to some
political boss instead of to a
candidate.
The Unit Rule is the
mechanism that gives the winner

of a primary all the delegate votes
from that state. This wipes out
minority opinions as well as
creating delegates who are no
more than rubber stamps.
In a pre-convention planning
meeting, the Black Caucus, the
Youth Caucus and the Women's
Caucus walked out in protest.
Strauss and his people were trying
to turn the convention into a
rubber stamp good only for
ratifying their rule changes.
An Open Convention
It will now be an open
convention. But it all depends on
the delegates. Right now the New
York Times sees it almost exactly

split between the "new politics"
and the old. If you are a registered
Democrat in the 12 th
Congressional District, then your
three delegates to the national
convention will be chosen Nov. 9
at a meeting open to all local
Democrats at Await High School,
in Mountain View. The meeting
will start at-9 a.m. and be over
well before 11:30 a.m.
Almost all of the delegate
candidates are old Democrats.
There are Alioto for Governor
people, AFL-CIO reps and party
functionaries. The only reform
candidates with a chance is the
slate that is coming from
Stanford. JTB • aßiliil

This is Joshua Goldstein, the
founder of Sangha and the
community candidate for Palo
Alto board of Education, Chris
Hables Gray, an anti-war activist
who lives at Columbae and has
been involved in Democratic Party
politics for four years, and Irma
Nogales, a chicana who has been
active in prison counseling and
community work in East Palo
Alto as well as more traditional
political activism.
They need your vote. . . Send a
message to Kansas City.
