# Stanford At Crossroads
## 
### Mark Licker 
Stanford, now stands at a
crossroads. It must allocate
limited resources for many
activities, and a profound debate
is taking place to define the
essential roles of the University.
President Lyman is to be
credited for saying, "I confess to
some feeling of disappointment at
what seems ... a relative lack of
discussion of serious educational
issues among students at
Stanford." I share his feelings.
But surely he is aware that the
"tough-minded debate on the
basic question of purpose and
function of the contemporary
university" is rarely admitted
openly in policy formulation or
decision announcements.
It is not politic for a University
figure to explain the goals or

priorities of policy, or to assess
honesty its impact on various
programs or interests. '
It is easier to equivocate about
the reasons for a decision, and let
others try to figure out what its
real implications are. Easier, but
destructive of the kind of
ideological and philosophical
examination necessary to provide
a coherent, logical guide for
future action. No wonder student
opinion has often been mute.
Encourage Critical Thinking
The purpose of this University
should be the encouragement of
creative, critical, and rational
thinking. This includes research
and specialized training for
various fields of endeavor.
But how should graduate and
undergraduate teaching effect

each other? What new facilities
should be given priority? Must
certain departments be
emphasized at the expense of
others? Should faculty be hired
and judged by their research
ability or teaching ability?
Clearly, the answer given to
these questions will determine the
function of Stanford University,
and will reflect the attitudes of
those people with the power and
responsibility to make their
opinions felt. We students share
that responsibility, and must
assert it in full and open
discussion of what educational
philosophy should guide this
institution in coming years.
