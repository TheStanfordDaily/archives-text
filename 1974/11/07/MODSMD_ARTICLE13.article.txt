# On The Woman Athlete

### Douglas Johnson 
Glenn Kramon's article on
women's athletic scholarships in
the Nov. 1 Daily was a fine review
of the problem. There are a few
points it raised which I would like
to pursue.
There is some difficulty in
siphoning funds frorp the major
present source of men's athletic
scholarships, "the Buck Club," to
women. According to the article,
although some alumni members
would cooperate, there are others
who would resist the flow of
funds to women, and perhaps give
less or at least no more in the
future.
Why would some alumni be
unwilling to support women's
athletics? Perhaps a few are
unreconstructed chauvinists who
consider sports no place for
women. But I suspect the feelings
of most are more complex.
As Alumni Relations Director
Jack Laird notes, most
contributors "want their money
to go to quality | talent), not just
to a competitor. It's not a
question of 'here's the money
who wants to go out for a
sport?' "
Ratings Traditional
The traditional method of
measuring such excellence is by
observing the ratings. It's a fairly
safe bet that the country's best
men's football team or tenth
best is working and struggling
pretty hard, and that
contributions to that team will go
to fine talent making truly great
efforts.

Perhaps many alumni, and also
present members of the University
community feel that a high
position in the rankings for a
women's sport, such as varsity
swimming or field hockey, carries
no such guarantee.
It is difficult to deny that at
this time there is v generally less
competition in women's sports
than in men's. Yet we should
remember that Stanford's men's
teams are not usually in the very
toughest national arena. The
Pacific-Eight is certainly a tough
league but it rarely can match
the Midwestern Big Ten. And to
look at what Stanford often
considers sister schools Harvard
and Yale they certainly manage
athletic scholarships, despite their
lowly status as contestants in the
Ivy League.
Harvard More Deserving?
Are Harvard athletes or for
that matter Stanford's not as
deserving as say Michigan State's?
I doubt it. Because I think we all
implicitly recognize, and take
pride in, the presence of other
factors, and the fact that Stanford
athletes are also Stanford students
and must do well in both highly
demanding areas. They are not
free to specialize as simply "dumb
jocks." And is that not a major
source of pride when Stanford
competes against USC or Michigan
State?
Women athletes grew up
knowing that sooner or later they
were supposed to give il up, that
there was no future for them in
sports. They usually receive little
recognition for their efforts.
And yet the amazing thing is
that in swimming or in field
hockey or in tennis, those efforts
are often truely heroic.
Why Athletics
What should perhaps emerge
from the debate on the funding of
women's athletics is a
re-examination of values of why
athletics in the first place. Does it
matter at all that a women's team
is unlikely to turn in quite so
"good" times as a men's team, or
be able to beat them on the field?
Competition does have value,
and it is certainly part of the
essence of athletics. It does matter
that the contestants try to win,
and try very hard. But perhaps
competition (and the resulting
tabulations of who wins, and who
is the record holder) should be
seen as really no more than a
vehicle a vehicle to inspire high
struggle and high focus.
In this light there can be no
question that women can be, and
that many women are, as
excellent athletes as are men.
Perhaps there are not yet so many
who can meet such a standard,
but what is necessary is support
and encouragement.
It is Stanford and schools like
it that are in the position of
potential leadership.
Because just as students will
gear their high school curricula to
what is expected in college, so too
will women's athletics be strongly
encouraged at that level if
Stanford will offer scholarships
and encouragement. And that is
the way to bring more women to
the contest hopefully
ultimately to encourage the
struggle for excellence.

swimming or field hockey, carries
no such guarantee.
It is difficult to deny that at
this time there is v generally less
competition in women's sports
than in men's. Yet we should
remember that Stanford's men's
teams are not usually in the very
toughest national arena. The
Pacific-Eight is certainly a tough
league but it rarely can match
the Midwestern Big Ten. And to
look at what Stanford often
considers sister schools Harvard
and Yale they certainly manage
athletic scholarships, despite their
lowly status as contestants in the
Ivy League.
Harvard More Deserving?
Are Harvard athletes or for
that matter Stanford's not as
deserving as say Michigan State's?
I doubt it. Because I think we all
implicitly recognize, and take
pride in, the presence of other
factors, and the fact that Stanford
athletes are also Stanford students
and must do well in both highly
demanding areas. They are not
free to specialize as simply "dumb
jocks." And is that not a major
source of pride when Stanford
competes against USC or Michigan
State?
Women athletes grew up
knowing that sooner or later they
were supposed to give il up, that
there was no future for them in
sports. They usually receive little
recognition for their efforts.
And yet the amazing thing is
that in swimming or in field
hockey or in tennis, those efforts
are often truely heroic.
Why Athletics
What should perhaps emerge
from the debate on the funding of
women's athletics is a
re-examination of values of why
athletics in the first place. Does it
matter at all that a women's team
is unlikely to turn in quite so
"good" times as a men's team, or
be able to beat them on the field?
Competition does have value,
and it is certainly part of the
essence of athletics. It does matter
that the contestants try to win,
and try very hard. But perhaps
competition (and the resulting
tabulations of who wins, and who
is the record holder) should be
seen as really no more than a
vehicle a vehicle to inspire high
struggle and high focus.
In this light there can be no
question that women can be, and
that many women are, as
excellent athletes as are men.
Perhaps there are not yet so many
who can meet such a standard,
but what is necessary is support
and encouragement.
It is Stanford and schools like
it that are in the position of
potential leadership.
Because just as students will
gear their high school curricula to
what is expected in college, so too
will women's athletics be strongly
encouraged at that level if
Stanford will offer scholarships
and encouragement. And that is
the way to bring more women to
the contest hopefully
ultimately to encourage the
struggle for excellence.

Glenn Kramon's article on
women's athletic scholarships in
the Nov. 1 Daily was a fine review
of the problem. There are a few
points it raised which I would like
to pursue.
There is some difficulty in
siphoning funds frorp the major
present source of men's athletic
scholarships, "the Buck Club," to
women. According to the article,
although some alumni members
would cooperate, there are others
who would resist the flow of
funds to women, and perhaps give
less or at least no more in the
future.
Why would some alumni be
unwilling to support women's
athletics? Perhaps a few are
unreconstructed chauvinists who
consider sports no place for
women. But I suspect the feelings
of most are more complex.
As Alumni Relations Director
Jack Laird notes, most
contributors "want their money
to go to quality | talent), not just
to a competitor. It's not a
question of 'here's the money
who wants to go out for a
sport?' "
Ratings Traditional
The traditional method of
measuring such excellence is by
observing the ratings. It's a fairly
safe bet that the country's best
men's football team or tenth
best is working and struggling
pretty hard, and that
contributions to that team will go
to fine talent making truly great
efforts.

Perhaps many alumni, and also
present members of the University
community feel that a high
position in the rankings for a
women's sport, such as varsity
swimming or field hockey, carries
no such guarantee.

re-examination of values of why
athletics in the first place. Does it
matter at all that a women's team
is unlikely to turn in quite so
"good" times as a men's team, or
be able to beat them on the field?
Competition does have value,
and it is certainly part of the
essence of athletics. It does matter
that the contestants try to win,
and try very hard. But perhaps
competition (and the resulting
tabulations of who wins, and who
is the record holder) should be
seen as really no more than a
vehicle a vehicle to inspire high
struggle and high focus.
In this light there can be no
question that women can be, and
that many women are, as
excellent athletes as are men.
Perhaps there are not yet so many
who can meet such a standard,
but what is necessary is support
and encouragement.
It is Stanford and schools like
it that are in the position of
potential leadership.
Because just as students will
gear their high school curricula to
what is expected in college, so too
will women's athletics be strongly
encouraged at that level if
Stanford will offer scholarships
and encouragement. And that is
the way to bring more women to
the contest hopefully
ultimately to encourage the
struggle for excellence.
