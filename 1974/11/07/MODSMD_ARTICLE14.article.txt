## Six-Month Asian Journey Spurs Sale Of Tibetan Woodblock Prints This Week 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"All of a sudden we'd pick up
a Time magazine and find out we
didn't have a vice-president,"
explains Linda Whinnery, a San
Jose native turned Tibetan art
dealer.
Travelling through Nepal with
Hunt Kooiker, a fifth year
medical student here, Whinnery
began to have doubts about her
latest hobby the collection and
sale of woodblock prints and
other art objects.
News of the sflaky state of the
United States economic and
political scene trickled slowly into
Nepal, and Whinnery and Kooiker

began to wonder whether
investing in anything, let alone
art, was a sound idea.
Whinnery and Kooiker spent
last December and January
trekking through rural villages in
Nepal as part of a six month
journey through Asia from
Turkey to Thailand.
In Katmandu, Nepal's capital,
Whinnery wandered into a small
shop owned by a Hindu named
Shiva Jung Rai. In an effort to
learn more about Nepalese
culture, Whinnery asked Shiva,
who knew little English, to teach
her about the deities portrayed in
Tibetan woodblock prints.

"Sometimes all he could tell
me was 'This is a dragon, <md it's
good,' " says Whinnery. In
addition, she endeavored to learn
Nepalese cooking, which she says
is "much more difficult than
'moderate heat, lower to simmer
for seven minutes.'
"It's more like, 'pull this stick
half way out of the fire.' "
Whinnery thinks the essence of
successful travel in strange
cultures lies in applying "a lot of
common sense, and a lot of risk.
"You have to use your head.
You don't go walking around at
night alone in a Moslem country.
No matter how cheap dope is,
don't /try to take it across the
border because you can buy it in
the next country."
She believes the best way to
learn about travelling and foreign
culture is on the road from other
travellers. If you're friendly, you
always meet people and, "if you
aren't you meet outgoing people
who pick you up."
As it is, Lind& Whinnery and
Hunt Kooiker were strangers
before meeting each other on a
Greek island. Three days later the
two strangers had decided to travel
togther, "but at first I only
committed myself as far as
Turkey," says Whinnery.
Wasn't Whinnery apprehensive
about travelling through Asia with
a near-stranger? Sure, but she
rationalized that, "No matter
where you are in the world,
you're only a few hours away
from California." Feeling she
could always catch a plane from
the nearest capital, Whinnery
relished her adventure.
"There's nothing wrong with
flying into capitals and eating in

hotels," she explains. "But I want
to know what these people are
saying to their oxen and how
they're getting them to till that
field."
Now selling wood block prints
at Tresidder, Whinnery and
Kooiker plan eventually to return
to a developing nation, hopefully
in Asia, to teach English and
practice medicine.
Of the people of Asia,
Whinnery says, "The fact that
you're there proves how much
richer you are than they are.
You're showing them away of life
that they can't have."

GOD OF MERCY—This Tibetan deity is Halabalahlkesvara, a tantric
form of Avalokitesvara, god of mercy. This is one of 14 prints being
sold this week at Tresidder. All were produced by Tibetan refugees
living in Nepal using woodblock printing on rice paper.

DEALER—Not long ago Linda Whinnery was wandering through Nepal, a not-so-typical tourist, learning
the native tongue and studying the country's art. Now she's back in the states with a new-found trade.
