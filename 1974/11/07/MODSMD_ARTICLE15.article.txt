I live near the Stanford Police and Fire Departments and seem to hear
sirens and alarms very frequently. Are these false alerts, small fires,
drills, ambulances or what? â€”J.H.
Most likely those sirens which awaken you during those restless
hours of sleep before a midterm come from fire engines.
According to Police Chief Marvin Herrington, the police only use
their sirens for emergency calls when someone is actually in the
process of being attacked or robbed. The Fire Department, on the
other hand, sends out engines with flashing lights and howling sirens
everytime someone sets off a fire alarm.
Asst. Fire Chief Frank Stolarik said the Fire Department received
1119 calls last year for first aid, rescue and fires. Out of those, 456
were false alarms an alarmingly huge number, Stolarik lamented.
Nearly 50 percent of the false alarms Stolarik attributed to
malicious mischief. He said, however, that the alarms sounding off
because of malfunctioning equipment has decreased from last year.
Stolarik elaborated that the majority of calls report fires. However,
many of the people who call in for rescues need someone to extricate
Escondido Village residents from stuck elevators.
Stolarik mentioned that the Fire Department does hold drills daily.

How does the Post Office assign mailboxes? They ask for a person's

height on the application but they don't seem to use the information.
-S.C.
If you have to crawl along the cement to see if you have any mail
or peer into your box like a peeping Tom on his toes, then you're
probably not a freshman.
Before the construction of an additional 1680 boxes this summer,
there weren't enough boxes to really offer a choice in heights,
according to Stanford Post Office branch manager William DeMers.
People had to take what they could get although DeMers said the
Post Office did try to correlate the heights. Now there are many more
boxes to choose from.
If you're really tired of stretching or constricting to abnormal
heights because of the location of your box, DeMers said you can
change to another box. However, you'll have to hassle filing a change
of address card.
