# Willow Road Expansion Prompts New Arguments
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Palo Alto City Council members
disagree about the degree to which
extension of Willow Road should be
contingent upon the University's
construction of a Campus Drive
Junipero Serra Boulevard link.
The Council voted 6-2 Monday
night to widen Willow Road to 90 feet
an d four lanes, accepting
recommendations made by
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum.
The Rosenbaum plan stipulated
that the University must construct at
least two lanes of Campus Drive from
its present, terminus near the Medical
Center to connect with Junipero Serra.
But the Council will discuss the exact
provisions of the measure during the
next month and may change the
original plan.
The University contends that any
extension of Campus Drive would
cause considerable financial strain, but
admits that it wants Willow Road
extended.
Rosenbaum's plan would reduce
congestion on Willow Road and
increase business at the Stanford
Shopping Center, according to Robert
F. Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance.
Considerable Leeway
Although the Council will attempt
to allow the University considerable
leeway in deference to financial
troubles, the city expects Stanford to
complete Campus Drive at a fairly
early date, Rosenbaum told the Daily
yesterday.
"We expect a real commitment on
Stanford's part," Rosenbaum said.
"We recognize its problems, but the
University will have to show that it is
serious about extending Campus Drive
if we are to widen Willow Road."
Councilwoman Enid Pearson and
Councilman Alan Henderson, however,
contend that Rosenbaum's plan is too
lenient on the University. Both agree
that improvements on Willow Road
should be delayed until the University
extends Campus Drive.
Pearson Accuses University
Pearson accused the University of
stalling in its plans to extend Campus
Drive and said that it is unfair to force
Palo Alto to start the Willow Road
expansion prior to completion of the
Drive.

Henderson was milder in his
criticism of the University, but he
reaffirmed his commitment to his
original plan to refuse to extend
Willow Road from Arboretum Road to
El. Camino until Stanford completes
Campus Drive.
Henderson's proposal was rejected
by the Council on Monday, with only
Henderson and Pearson voting for it.
"The whole matter seems to be a
case of whether or not Stanford has
enough money to extend Campus
Dirve," Henderson said. "The Council
was once told that the University had
set aside $300,000 for extension of
Campus Drive, but now that costs have
increased, we are told that $300,000 is
not enough."
