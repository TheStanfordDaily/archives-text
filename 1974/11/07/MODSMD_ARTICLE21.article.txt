New Congress Girds For Clashes
WASHINGTON Their majorities increased by off-year
election victories, congressional Democrats girded yesterday
for certain clashes with President Ford over the right way
to handle America's economic ills.
But in the wake of Tuesday's triumphs, the first talk was
of compromise and cooperation.
"We will meet Congress more than halfway," Ford said
through an aide.
In late afternoon, Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield met with Ford in the Oval Office. Mansfield said
he hopes "now that the election is over, we will be able to
get together and w f ork cooperatively."
"Let me assure you that will be the case," Ford replied.
Meanwhile, a source close to the Democratic leadership
of the House, where Democratic election gains were the
biggest, said, "The name of the game is going to be
compromise."
While votes were still beipg counted, House Speaker Carl
Albert declared the results a repudiation of Ford's
economic proposals and said Democrats had a mandate for
action on such programs as national health insurance tax
reform and public service employment.
White House spokesman Ron Nessen said of the election
outcome: "No one thinks this was a referendum on the
President... It will not affect the President's decision that
he probably will run for election in 1976."
Cover-Up Lawyers Request Mistrial
WASHINGTON—Three defense attorneys in the
Watergate cover-up trial contended yesterday the
prosecution gained an unfair advantage last weekend when
it came up with a memorandum which all parties had
believed no longer existed.
Because the prosecution revealed the existence of the E.
Howard Hunt memorandum, lawyers for former Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell and ex-White House aide John D.
Ehrlichman asked U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica to
declare a mistrial.
Kenneth W. Parkinson's attorney asked the judge to
grant his client a separate trial.
Also yesterday, a Secret Service technician told the
court that portions of presidential conversations sometimes
went unrecorded while a tape was being changed.
James G. Baker said that when a reel of tape was about
to run out, he shut off the recorder, losing perhaps three
minutes of conversation while changing to a fresh reel.
UJS. To Negotiate With Palestinians?
CAlRO—Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, on the
second day of his latest Middle East peace mission,
appeared yesterday to leave open the door for eventual
contact between the United States and the Palestinian
guerrilla leadership.
"We will remain in close contact with all of the parties

and encourage progress wherever the possibility exists,"
Kissinger said after a two-hour meeting with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat.
Then the American Secretary of State flew to Riyadh,
where he met with King Faisal. Saudi Foreign Minister
Omar Sakkaf pledged that Saudi Arabia would try to hold
the line on oil prices, or work for a nominal cut, at a
meeting of oil-producing nations next month in Vienna.
Coal Talks Show Some Progress
WASHINGTON Coal industry and union negotiators
settled down to hard bargaining yesterday and reported
some progress toward reaching an agreement that would
keep short a predicted nationwide miners' strike.
After three days of break-offs and disruptions by both
sides, negotiators for the United Mine Workers (UMW) and
the Bituminous Coal Operators Association spent the day
carefully analyzing each other's proposals.
They recessed until this morning late last evening.
UMW President Arnold Miller said there could be a
tentative agreement before the current contracts runs out
Nov. 12, but not in time to prevent at least a brief work
stoppage.
Peron Declares k State Of Siege'
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina President Isabel Peron
declared a state of siege yesterday in violence-plagued
Argentina, which is suffering political killings at the rate of
more than one a day.

of her husband, Juan D. Peron, elevated her to the
presidency. She had been his vice president.
Since then, terrorists from the political left and right
have claimed 136 assassination victims. >

CLEVELAND, Ohio Two former National Guardsmen
now on trial on charges stemming from the 1970 Kent
State shootings told FBI agents they shot men advancing on
them, according to statements read in court yesterday.
In a statement read to the jury by the prosecution,
James E. Pierce said he feared he "would not get out alive."
Lawrence A. Shafer said in a similar statement that
