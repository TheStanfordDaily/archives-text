# Demos Gain State Legislature Seats
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
California Democrats Tuesday
picked up a two-thirds majority in the
80-seat state Assembly for the first
time in history, adding seven seats to
their previous total of 48.
And in the state Senate, Democrats
will hold 24 seats to the Republicans'
14. Two other seats—those of Lt. Gov.
John L. Harmer and Lt. Gov.-Elect
Mervyn M. Dymally—will be vacant
until special elections can be arranged.
The Democrats also added four
members to California's congressional
delegation, winning 28 out of 43 races.
Incumbent Republicans Robert B.
Mathias and Victor V. Veysey lost
their bids for re-election.
Another GOP incumbent Jerry L.
Pettis, defeated his Democratic
challenger, contrary to the report in
yesterday's Daily results box.
Final, unofficial returns from,
around the country indicate that the
Democrats will hold a 291-144
majority in the House of

Representatives, according to the
Associated Press. This would represent
a net gain of 43 over the 93rd
Congress.
The Democrats have not held as
large a majority in the House since
1964, when the Lyndon Johnson
landslide swept in 295 Democrats.
Gain Three Seats
Returns indicated yesterday that
the Democrats made a net gain of
three seats in the Senate, expanding
their majority to 61-39.
The Democrats could pick up an
additional seat should former North
Dakota Gov. William L. Guy, a
Democrat, defeat incumbent
Republican Milton R. Young. With all
precincts reporting last night, the
National Election Service showed
Young winning by 16 votes, while the
A.P. called the race a virtual tie. A
recount is planned.
Late hour surges swept two
Republicans former Ohio Gov.
James A. Rhodes and Kansas state
Sen. Pres. Robert F. Bennett into
governors' chairs formerly occupied by
Democrats.
Alaskan Toss-Up
The Alaska gubernatorial race
between incumbent Democrat William
A. Egan and Republican Jay S.
Hammond was still rated a toss-up last
night. Egan led, however.
If he wins re-election, the
Democrats will have posted a net gain
of five statehouses, winning nine away
from the Republicans, but losing three
to the GOP and one to #n
independent. An Egan victory,
therefore, would give the Democrats
37 governors to the Republicans' 12.
With a few notable exceptions,
Stanford alumni fared poorly in
Tuesday's election. Democrat Adam
Levin, a member of the ASSU Council
of Presidents in 1970-71, failed in his
bid to oust New Jersey Rep. Matthew
Rinaldo, a liberal Republican.
Another alumnus, former state
Assemblyman George Milias, a
Republican, was defeated in
California's 13th Congressional

District by San Jose Mayor Norman Y.
Mineta, who will be the first
Japanese-American from this state to
go to Congress.
Idaho
Idaho's Democratic Sen. Frank
Church, also an alumnus, won
re-election to a fourth term in the
Senate.
State, Sen. Arlen Gregorio, a
Democrat and Stanford graduate, won
re-election defeating fellow alumnus
James R. Tormey Jr. in the 10th
District, which includes Stanford.
Another graduate, William McPherson
also lost his bid for the state Senate.
Three other alumni, Dixon Arnett,
Victor J. Calvo and Richard Hayden,
each won election to the state
Assembly. Arnett and Hayden are
both incumbents and Republicans.
Calvo, a Democrat, will represent the
21st District, which includes the
campus.
Other alumni winning election to

the Assembly Tuesday were:
incumbent Barry Keene (D-2nd), Gary
K. Hart (D-35th), incumbent Alan
Sieroty (D-44th) and incumbent Bob
Badham (R-74th).
Hart defeated another alumnus.
Republican Tim Terry. Graduate
Sumner Offil, also a Republican, lost
in the 58th District.
Also in California, Republican
alumni Burt L. Talcott and Paul N.
McCloskey both won re-election to
Congress, as did Democrat Don
Edwards. But graduates Oscar H. Klee,
James D. Loebl and Bill Bond lost bids
for Congress. Klee and Loebl are
Democrats; Bond is a Republican.
In New York, Allard K.
Lowenstein, once Asst. Dean of
Students here, lost this third
consecutive congressional election,
being defeated by incumbent
Republican John W. Wydler.
Lowenstein served in the House from
1969 until 1971.

alumni Burt L. Talcott and Paul N.
McCloskey both won re-election to
Congress, as did Democrat Don
Edwards. But graduates Oscar H. Klee,
James D. Loebl and Bill Bond lost bids
for Congress. Klee and Loebl are
Democrats; Bond is a Republican.
In New York, Allard K.
Lowenstein, once Asst. Dean of
Students here, lost this third
consecutive congressional election,
being defeated by incumbent
Republican John W. Wydler.
Lowenstein served in the House from
1969 until 1971.
California Democrats Tuesday
picked up a two-thirds majority in the
80-seat state Assembly for the first
time in history, adding seven seats to
their previous total of 48.
And in the state Senate, Democrats
will hold 24 seats to the Republicans'
14. Two other seats—those of Lt. Gov.
John L. Harmer and Lt. Gov.-Elect
Mervyn M. Dymally—will be vacant
until special elections can be arranged.
The Democrats also added four
members to California's congressional
delegation, winning 28 out of 43 races.
Incumbent Republicans Robert B.
Mathias and Victor V. Veysey lost
their bids for re-election.
Another GOP incumbent Jerry L.
Pettis, defeated his Democratic
challenger, contrary to the report in
yesterday's Daily results box.
Final, unofficial returns from,
around the country indicate that the
Democrats will hold a 291-144
majority in the House of

Representatives, according to the
Associated Press. This would represent
a net gain of 43 over the 93rd
Congress.
The Democrats have not held as
large a majority in the House since
1964, when the Lyndon Johnson
landslide swept in 295 Democrats.
Gain Three Seats
Returns indicated yesterday that
the Democrats made a net gain of
three seats in the Senate, expanding
their majority to 61-39.
The Democrats could pick up an
additional seat should former North
Dakota Gov. William L. Guy, a
Democrat, defeat incumbent
Republican Milton R. Young. With all
precincts reporting last night, the
National Election Service showed
Young winning by 16 votes, while the
A.P. called the race a virtual tie. A
recount is planned.
Late hour surges swept two
Republicans former Ohio Gov.
James A. Rhodes and Kansas state
Sen. Pres. Robert F. Bennett into
governors' chairs formerly occupied by
Democrats.
Alaskan Toss-Up
The Alaska gubernatorial race
between incumbent Democrat William
A. Egan and Republican Jay S.
Hammond was still rated a toss-up last
night. Egan led, however.
If he wins re-election, the
Democrats will have posted a net gain
of five statehouses, winning nine away
from the Republicans, but losing three
to the GOP and one to #n
independent. An Egan victory,
therefore, would give the Democrats
37 governors to the Republicans' 12.
With a few notable exceptions,
Stanford alumni fared poorly in
Tuesday's election. Democrat Adam
Levin, a member of the ASSU Council
of Presidents in 1970-71, failed in his
bid to oust New Jersey Rep. Matthew
Rinaldo, a liberal Republican.
Another alumnus, former state
Assemblyman George Milias, a
Republican, was defeated in
California's 13th Congressional

District by San Jose Mayor Norman Y.
Mineta, who will be the first
Japanese-American from this state to
go to Congress.
Idaho
Idaho's Democratic Sen. Frank
Church, also an alumnus, won
re-election to a fourth term in the
Senate.
State, Sen. Arlen Gregorio, a
Democrat and Stanford graduate, won
re-election defeating fellow alumnus
James R. Tormey Jr. in the 10th
District, which includes Stanford.
Another graduate, William McPherson
also lost his bid for the state Senate.
Three other alumni, Dixon Arnett,
Victor J. Calvo and Richard Hayden,
each won election to the state
Assembly. Arnett and Hayden are
both incumbents and Republicans.
Calvo, a Democrat, will represent the
21st District, which includes the
campus.
Other alumni winning election to

the Assembly Tuesday were:
incumbent Barry Keene (D-2nd), Gary
K. Hart (D-35th), incumbent Alan
Sieroty (D-44th) and incumbent Bob
Badham (R-74th).
Hart defeated another alumnus.

Assembly. Arnett and Hayden are
both incumbents and Republicans.
Calvo, a Democrat, will represent the
21st District, which includes the
campus.
Other alumni winning election to

the Assembly Tuesday were:
incumbent Barry Keene (D-2nd), Gary
K. Hart (D-35th), incumbent Alan
Sieroty (D-44th) and incumbent Bob
Badham (R-74th).
Hart defeated another alumnus.
Republican Tim Terry. Graduate
Sumner Offil, also a Republican, lost
in the 58th District.
Also in California, Republican
alumni Burt L. Talcott and Paul N.
McCloskey both won re-election to
Congress, as did Democrat Don
Edwards. But graduates Oscar H. Klee,
James D. Loebl and Bill Bond lost bids
for Congress. Klee and Loebl are
Democrats; Bond is a Republican.
In New York, Allard K.
Lowenstein, once Asst. Dean of
Students here, lost this third
consecutive congressional election,
being defeated by incumbent
Republican John W. Wydler.
Lowenstein served in the House from
1969 until 1971.
California Democrats Tuesday
picked up a two-thirds majority in the
80-seat state Assembly for the first
time in history, adding seven seats to
their previous total of 48.
And in the state Senate, Democrats
will hold 24 seats to the Republicans'
14. Two other seats—those of Lt. Gov.
John L. Harmer and Lt. Gov.-Elect
Mervyn M. Dymally—will be vacant
until special elections can be arranged.
The Democrats also added four
members to California's congressional
delegation, winning 28 out of 43 races.
Incumbent Republicans Robert B.
Mathias and Victor V. Veysey lost
their bids for re-election.
Another GOP incumbent Jerry L.
Pettis, defeated his Democratic
challenger, contrary to the report in
yesterday's Daily results box.
Final, unofficial returns from,
around the country indicate that the
Democrats will hold a 291-144
majority in the House of

Representatives, according to the
Associated Press. This would represent
a net gain of 43 over the 93rd
Congress.
The Democrats have not held as
large a majority in the House since
1964, when the Lyndon Johnson
landslide swept in 295 Democrats.
Gain Three Seats
Returns indicated yesterday that
the Democrats made a net gain of
three seats in the Senate, expanding
their majority to 61-39.
The Democrats could pick up an
additional seat should former North
Dakota Gov. William L. Guy, a
Democrat, defeat incumbent
Republican Milton R. Young. With all
precincts reporting last night, the
National Election Service showed
Young winning by 16 votes, while the
A.P. called the race a virtual tie. A
recount is planned.
Late hour surges swept two
Republicans former Ohio Gov.
James A. Rhodes and Kansas state
Sen. Pres. Robert F. Bennett into
governors' chairs formerly occupied by
Democrats.
Alaskan Toss-Up
The Alaska gubernatorial race
between incumbent Democrat William
A. Egan and Republican Jay S.
Hammond was still rated a toss-up last
night. Egan led, however.
If he wins re-election, the
Democrats will have posted a net gain
of five statehouses, winning nine away
from the Republicans, but losing three
to the GOP and one to #n
independent. An Egan victory,
therefore, would give the Democrats
37 governors to the Republicans' 12.
With a few notable exceptions,
Stanford alumni fared poorly in
Tuesday's election. Democrat Adam
Levin, a member of the ASSU Council
of Presidents in 1970-71, failed in his
bid to oust New Jersey Rep. Matthew
Rinaldo, a liberal Republican.
Another alumnus, former state
Assemblyman George Milias, a
Republican, was defeated in
California's 13th Congressional

District by San Jose Mayor Norman Y.
Mineta, who will be the first
Japanese-American from this state to
go to Congress.
Idaho
Idaho's Democratic Sen. Frank
Church, also an alumnus, won
re-election to a fourth term in the
Senate.
State, Sen. Arlen Gregorio, a
Democrat and Stanford graduate, won
re-election defeating fellow alumnus
James R. Tormey Jr. in the 10th
District, which includes Stanford.
Another graduate, William McPherson
also lost his bid for the state Senate.
Three other alumni, Dixon Arnett,
Victor J. Calvo and Richard Hayden,
each won election to the state
Assembly. Arnett and Hayden are
both incumbents and Republicans.
Calvo, a Democrat, will represent the
21st District, which includes the
campus.
Other alumni winning election to
