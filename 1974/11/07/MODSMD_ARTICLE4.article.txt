# Horton Hints At Ending Frats' Draw-Exemption
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton indicated for the first
time yesterday that he is being
influenced toward the position of
eliminating the draw-exemption
privilege which is currently given only
to all-male fraternities.
Under intensive questioning by
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
President Mike Nilsson, Horton said
that "every single group [he has met
with] believes we should do our best
to retain fraternities as a housing
option, but not with vast privileges."
Currently, only fraternities are
exempt from the housing draw and are
allowed to subjectively select future
residents. Because these same
privileges are not given to women, the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS) last year called the system
discriminatory. .
Since then, Horton has been
meeting with students to investigate
possible alternatives to the current

system.
Last night's encounter between
Horton and Nilsson occurred at such a
meeting in Rinconada lounge.
Objectionable Proposals
Nilsson pointed out the
objectionable nature of all current
proposals which would allow certain
living groups to be exempt from the
draw.
"Most people think it is
objectionable that certain groups
would have privileges that others
don't," he said.
If these grounds are considered
sufficient, "we are essentially moving
into a draw system" for everyone.
Horton noted that the University
"wants to preserve fraternities"
because "having a variety of living
options is desirable." He called Greek
living "educationally sound" and said
fraternities are "good places to live."
But he said he personally did not
accept the judgment of certain groups
regarding what would happen to

fraternities if they were filled through
the draw.
End To Fraternities
Nilsson and other fraterpity
members have argued vigorously that
placing their houses in the draw would
lead to the end of fraternities here.
Horton and a member of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity
differed sharply over how well Kappa
Sigma has done since becoming a part
of the draw.
Horton said Kappa Sigma, the only
all-male fraternity in the draw, "is
stronger today" than when it joined
the draw in order to avoid folding.
But a member of SAE said that the
Kappa Sigma president had told him
that "for all intents and purposes the
fraternity is dead."
Sororities Not Feasible
Horton also indicated last night
that the chance of bringing back
sororities to solve the discrimination
issue was slim. "I don't think it's
feasible," he said, pointing out that
President Richard W. Lyman has twice
said it is not a viable option.
However, Horton also agreed that
the Board of Trustee policy forbidding
sororities would be illegal under
regulations developed under Title IX
of the Higher Education Amendments
of 1972.
Nilsson is pursuing the idea of
restoring sororities and said he has
received two "favorable" replies to
letters he sent to national sororities.
"There is an interest, on a national
level, about coming back," he noted.
Substantial Interest
Nilsson also claimed that "there is a
substantial interest among certain
groups of women here to bring back
sororities," although a recent survey in
Live Oak found that "most women are
not too much in favor unless it meant
saving frats."
Nilsson said he was uncertain
whether the survey was valid or what
type of survey would accurately
determine women's desire for
sororities. He had previously indicated
that the IFC would poll the student
body on this issue.

THAT'S A TOUHIEâ€”Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton closes his
eyes to meditate his answer to a question raised about the fraternity draw
question. Horton said last night in a meeting at Rinconada that he is leaning
toward elimination of the frats' draw-exempt status.
Sororities were voted out by the
students and the Board of Trustees in
1944, because the "divisive dual
system" created extreme social
pressures.
Possible Tension
While Horton admitted that the
divisive duality would probably not be
present if sororities were to exist now,
he noted possible tension between
single-sex living groups which would
be exempt from the draw and coed
groups which would not.
Horton also reiterated the
decision-making process, which he said
would have to be completed at the end
of this quarter or early next quarter.
"I will have to be responsible for a
public recommendation," which will
go to Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, Lyman and eventually to the
University Board of Trustees, he said.
But Horton noted that his final
decision will not be made until the
issue "is fully discussed."
