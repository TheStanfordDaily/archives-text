# Campus Counseling, Testing Sessions
## Students Aid Sickle Cell Program 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
A committee of students here, in cooperation with the
Mid-Peninsula Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, is sponsoring
an educational and testing program for the hereditary
disease this weekend and next.
Don Hearn, a graduate student in micro-biology and
chairman of the committee, said the purpose of the
program is to "convey what sickle cell is, to test students,
faculty and staff for signs and to provide general
counseling."
Tomorrow, a movie will be shown at 6:30 p.m. in
Olivo-Magnolia lounge. Hearn said the film "will help clear
up some of the misconceptions pertaining to sickle cell."
The movie will be followed by a question-answer session.
On the following two Saturdays, Nov. 9 and 16, the
Cowell Student Health Center will provide free tests from 9
a.m. to noon, Hearn said.
Sickle cell occurs when certain parts of the body get
tired or have low oxygen pressure, causing blood cells to
become sickle-shaped, Hearn explained.
The cells will then clog blood vessels and only live for 60
days, instead of the normal 120, causing anemia. Hearn

noted that the condition must be inherited from both
parents in order for it to affect a person.
Hearn said that the idea for such a program has been
around since 1971. "Stanford wanted to have a program for
testing students and the Mid-Peninsula wanted an
educational program," he stated.
"Finally, in the spring of 1974, a compromise was
reached," Hearn said. The program is currently being
funded by the University through Cowell, but is under the
auspecies of the Mid-Peninsula Foundation, which is headed
by Aaron Smith, a clinical social worker at the Stanford
Hospital.
Hearn said the committee planned to keep students
posted on the program's progress, though results of all tests
would be confidential.
He added that sickle-cell was a "prototype" of a
hereditary disease and a place to start in the general
educational program about such diseases.
Part of this education may include people speaking in
various high schools and talk about the disease and the
treatment program at Stanford, Hearn noted, adding that
there was a need for other clinical treatment facilities.
