# Maoists Attempt To Form National Party
## 
### BILL EVERS 
In recent months, former leaders of the
defunct Venceremos organization from the
Stanford area have been attending conferences
on forming a new nationwide communist
party.
Local radical organizations like the UP Press
in Redwood City have already split bitterly
over affiliation with such a party. And a recent
convention has given birth to one such new
party, the Communist Labor Party, although
observers differ as to its promise and life
expectancy.
These activities are the tip of the iceberg of
the party-building movement that is the
principal present focus of the diverse Maoist
groups that evolved out of the political activism
of the 19605.
Important Groups
The important political groups involved fall
into four sets:
—the Black Workers Congress, the August 29
Movement, the Puerto Rican Revolutionary
Workers Organizations and a group of
collectives that survived the break-up of
Venceremos, a Bay Area revolutionary
communist group once active here;
—the October League (Marxist-Leninist) and
the Guardian newspaper;
—the Communist League (CL), the Motor
City Labor League, the National Continuations
Committee and the Communist Labor Party;

—and the Revolutionary Union (RU).
All the Maoist groups engaged in
party-building have certain elements in
common. They oppose the Communist Party,
USA as too reformist and linked with the
Soviet Union.
The groups also desire a multi-racial,
centrally disciplined nationwide organization
as a necessary preliminary to the revolutionary
overthrow of capitalist rule. But it is by no
means clear that they will be able to all unite in
one new communist partv.
Interest
Interest in creating a left communist party
has mounted in recent years. In 1973, the
Guardian sponsored a symposium in New York
City on "What Road to Building a New
Communist Party?" which was attended by
1200 people.
Now such an effort is the primary immediate
goal of all significant Maoist groups in the U.S.
But even in discussing this primary goal,
differences begin to emerge. The RU, which is
the largest American Maoist group, says that
the creation of a nation-wide party is the
"central task" during a "brief period ahead."
The RU emphasizes its labor union
strike-support activities. In an interview with
the Daily one RU member in Richmond spoke
in very concrete terms about the RU's aims in
striving for a new party.
The RU's perspective is grounded directly in

experiences like the recent Farah and DASCO
paper company strikes. This concrete
orientation toward "mass movement" activities
is criticized sharply by groups such as the
August 29 Movement (whose name comes from
the date of a Chicano antiwar protest in Los
Angeles).
These groups complain that the RU neglects
spreading communist ideas. The Black Workers
Congress says, "We must continue to unleash all
fire against Rtl line," because the RU is
insufficiently oriented toward building a
"vanguard party."
Exclusive Stress
In contrast with the RU, the Communist
League almost exclusively stresses the task of
party building. People formerly active in
Stanford Venceremos say that the CL has a
sectarian tendency to read out all other Maoist
groups as heretical from the start, rather than
looking for and attempting to develop possible
bases of unity.
In addition, former Venceremos members
say that CL acts as if communist propaganda
and study groups alone, detached from
day-to-day political and economic struggles, can
win the workers to communism.
Yet the CL has been in the forefront of the
party-building movement. All the Maoist groups
that regard the larger RU as too reformist have
had to respond and react to the CL's ceaseless

efforts to set up a new communist party.
The CL was the main initiator of the
"National Continuations Committee to Call a
Congress to Establish a New Marxist-Leninist,
Multi-National Communist Party." This interim
body dominated by the CL set up a convention
that proclaimed the Communist Labor Party.
But dissatisfaction with the new party is
widespread. An RU organizer told the Daily
"You can't build a revolutionary party with a
counter-revolutionary line."
Some former Venceremos members are
worried that none of the groups now active in
party-building stress urban guerrilla warfare and
military organization along with political work.
Such a perspective was a definitive feature of
Venceremos' ideology.
The experience of antiwar organizing at
Stanford influenced persons now prominent in
the Palo Alto area collectives left over from
Venceremos and in all levels of the
Revolutionary Union.
There is, at present, no Maoist group
publicly organizing on campus, but the
Revolutionary Union did have a table at Maples
Pavilion during fall quarter registration.
(The RU was co-founded by fired Assoc
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin; but after he
and his supporters left to join Venceremos in
December 1970, the RU was no longer active
on the Peninsula.)

Yet the CL has been in the forefront of the
party-building movement. All the Maoist groups
that regard the larger RU as too reformist have
had to respond and react to the CL's ceaseless

efforts to set up a new communist party.
The CL was the main initiator of the
"National Continuations Committee to Call a
Congress to Establish a New Marxist-Leninist,
Multi-National Communist Party." This interim
body dominated by the CL set up a convention
that proclaimed the Communist Labor Party.
But dissatisfaction with the new party is
widespread. An RU organizer told the Daily
"You can't build a revolutionary party with a
counter-revolutionary line."
Some former Venceremos members are
worried that none of the groups now active in
party-building stress urban guerrilla warfare and
military organization along with political work.
Such a perspective was a definitive feature of
Venceremos' ideology.
The experience of antiwar organizing at
Stanford influenced persons now prominent in
the Palo Alto area collectives left over from
Venceremos and in all levels of the
Revolutionary Union.
There is, at present, no Maoist group
publicly organizing on campus, but the
Revolutionary Union did have a table at Maples
Pavilion during fall quarter registration.
(The RU was co-founded by fired Assoc
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin; but after he
and his supporters left to join Venceremos in
December 1970, the RU was no longer active
on the Peninsula.)
In recent months, former leaders of the
defunct Venceremos organization from the
Stanford area have been attending conferences
on forming a new nationwide communist
party.
Local radical organizations like the UP Press
in Redwood City have already split bitterly
over affiliation with such a party. And a recent
convention has given birth to one such new
party, the Communist Labor Party, although
observers differ as to its promise and life
expectancy.
These activities are the tip of the iceberg of
the party-building movement that is the
principal present focus of the diverse Maoist
groups that evolved out of the political activism
of the 19605.
Important Groups
The important political groups involved fall
into four sets:
—the Black Workers Congress, the August 29
Movement, the Puerto Rican Revolutionary
Workers Organizations and a group of
collectives that survived the break-up of
Venceremos, a Bay Area revolutionary
communist group once active here;
—the October League (Marxist-Leninist) and
the Guardian newspaper;
—the Communist League (CL), the Motor
City Labor League, the National Continuations
Committee and the Communist Labor Party;

—and the Revolutionary Union (RU).
All the Maoist groups engaged in
party-building have certain elements in
common. They oppose the Communist Party,
USA as too reformist and linked with the
Soviet Union.
The groups also desire a multi-racial,
centrally disciplined nationwide organization
as a necessary preliminary to the revolutionary
overthrow of capitalist rule. But it is by no
means clear that they will be able to all unite in
one new communist partv.
Interest
Interest in creating a left communist party
has mounted in recent years. In 1973, the
Guardian sponsored a symposium in New York
City on "What Road to Building a New
Communist Party?" which was attended by
1200 people.
Now such an effort is the primary immediate
goal of all significant Maoist groups in the U.S.
But even in discussing this primary goal,
differences begin to emerge. The RU, which is
the largest American Maoist group, says that
the creation of a nation-wide party is the
"central task" during a "brief period ahead."
The RU emphasizes its labor union
strike-support activities. In an interview with
the Daily one RU member in Richmond spoke
in very concrete terms about the RU's aims in
striving for a new party.
The RU's perspective is grounded directly in

experiences like the recent Farah and DASCO
paper company strikes. This concrete
orientation toward "mass movement" activities
is criticized sharply by groups such as the
August 29 Movement (whose name comes from
the date of a Chicano antiwar protest in Los
Angeles).
These groups complain that the RU neglects
spreading communist ideas. The Black Workers
Congress says, "We must continue to unleash all
fire against Rtl line," because the RU is
insufficiently oriented toward building a
"vanguard party."
Exclusive Stress
In contrast with the RU, the Communist
League almost exclusively stresses the task of
party building. People formerly active in
Stanford Venceremos say that the CL has a
sectarian tendency to read out all other Maoist
groups as heretical from the start, rather than
looking for and attempting to develop possible
bases of unity.
In addition, former Venceremos members
say that CL acts as if communist propaganda
and study groups alone, detached from
day-to-day political and economic struggles, can
win the workers to communism.

differences begin to emerge. The RU, which is
the largest American Maoist group, says that
the creation of a nation-wide party is the
"central task" during a "brief period ahead."
The RU emphasizes its labor union
strike-support activities. In an interview with
the Daily one RU member in Richmond spoke
in very concrete terms about the RU's aims in
striving for a new party.
The RU's perspective is grounded directly in

experiences like the recent Farah and DASCO
paper company strikes. This concrete
orientation toward "mass movement" activities
is criticized sharply by groups such as the
August 29 Movement (whose name comes from
the date of a Chicano antiwar protest in Los
Angeles).
These groups complain that the RU neglects
spreading communist ideas. The Black Workers
Congress says, "We must continue to unleash all
fire against Rtl line," because the RU is
insufficiently oriented toward building a
"vanguard party."
Exclusive Stress
In contrast with the RU, the Communist
League almost exclusively stresses the task of
party building. People formerly active in
Stanford Venceremos say that the CL has a
sectarian tendency to read out all other Maoist
groups as heretical from the start, rather than
looking for and attempting to develop possible
bases of unity.
In addition, former Venceremos members
say that CL acts as if communist propaganda
and study groups alone, detached from
day-to-day political and economic struggles, can
win the workers to communism.
Yet the CL has been in the forefront of the
party-building movement. All the Maoist groups
that regard the larger RU as too reformist have
had to respond and react to the CL's ceaseless

efforts to set up a new communist party.
The CL was the main initiator of the
"National Continuations Committee to Call a
Congress to Establish a New Marxist-Leninist,
Multi-National Communist Party." This interim
body dominated by the CL set up a convention
that proclaimed the Communist Labor Party.
But dissatisfaction with the new party is
widespread. An RU organizer told the Daily
"You can't build a revolutionary party with a
counter-revolutionary line."
Some former Venceremos members are
worried that none of the groups now active in
party-building stress urban guerrilla warfare and
military organization along with political work.
Such a perspective was a definitive feature of
Venceremos' ideology.
The experience of antiwar organizing at
Stanford influenced persons now prominent in
the Palo Alto area collectives left over from
Venceremos and in all levels of the
Revolutionary Union.
There is, at present, no Maoist group
publicly organizing on campus, but the
Revolutionary Union did have a table at Maples
Pavilion during fall quarter registration.
(The RU was co-founded by fired Assoc
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin; but after he
and his supporters left to join Venceremos in
December 1970, the RU was no longer active
on the Peninsula.)
In recent months, former leaders of the
defunct Venceremos organization from the
Stanford area have been attending conferences
on forming a new nationwide communist
party.
Local radical organizations like the UP Press
in Redwood City have already split bitterly
over affiliation with such a party. And a recent
convention has given birth to one such new
party, the Communist Labor Party, although
observers differ as to its promise and life
expectancy.
These activities are the tip of the iceberg of
the party-building movement that is the
principal present focus of the diverse Maoist
groups that evolved out of the political activism
of the 19605.
Important Groups
The important political groups involved fall
into four sets:
—the Black Workers Congress, the August 29
Movement, the Puerto Rican Revolutionary
Workers Organizations and a group of
collectives that survived the break-up of
Venceremos, a Bay Area revolutionary
communist group once active here;
—the October League (Marxist-Leninist) and
the Guardian newspaper;
—the Communist League (CL), the Motor
City Labor League, the National Continuations
Committee and the Communist Labor Party;

—and the Revolutionary Union (RU).
All the Maoist groups engaged in
party-building have certain elements in
common. They oppose the Communist Party,
USA as too reformist and linked with the
Soviet Union.
The groups also desire a multi-racial,
centrally disciplined nationwide organization
as a necessary preliminary to the revolutionary
overthrow of capitalist rule. But it is by no
means clear that they will be able to all unite in
one new communist partv.
Interest
Interest in creating a left communist party
has mounted in recent years. In 1973, the
Guardian sponsored a symposium in New York
City on "What Road to Building a New
Communist Party?" which was attended by
1200 people.
Now such an effort is the primary immediate
goal of all significant Maoist groups in the U.S.
But even in discussing this primary goal,
differences begin to emerge. The RU, which is
the largest American Maoist group, says that
the creation of a nation-wide party is the
"central task" during a "brief period ahead."
