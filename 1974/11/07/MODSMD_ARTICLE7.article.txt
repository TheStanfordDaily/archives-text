Replies On Gallo, UFW
Editor:
I am writing in regard to the
article from the Oregon
Barometer, printed in the Nov. 1
Daily. The article claims that
Gallo uses no child labor and that
in fact no one under 18 years of
age is ever hired. This is highly
improbable.
There are 800,000 children
under 16 years of age laboring in
the fields of California. Since
Gallo uses one third of all the
grapes in California, it seems that
a good number of these children
would have to labor in the fields
of Gallo.
Besides, Gallo does not directly
hire the workers. It is the labor
contractor who hires. Without any
direct knowledge of whom the
labor contractor is hiring, the
winemakers cannot make accurate
claims as to who is actually
working in the fields.
The article also states that
Gallo views itself as having been,
"caught in the middle of a
jurisdictional dispute between the
two unions and has been unfairly
subjected to vilification." It is a
fact that Gallo has a campaign to
discredit the UFW which
supplements the Teamsters with
$lOO,OOO a month.
Because of continuous efforts
of Gallo and of the Teamsters to
discredit the UFW and to deny
farmworkers their right to
collective bargaining, I feel that
we should support the boycott of
Gallo wines, which includes all
wines from Modesto.

The article from the Oregon
Barometer that the Daily
reprinted Friday is a perfect
example of how outright lies and
selective misinformation can
completely distort an issue.
It is an outright lie to call the
UFW-Teamster dispute simply a
"jurisdictional" one. The
Teamsters were invited into the
fields by the growers because the
growers knew they would have to
have some sort of a union, and
they wanted one they could make
a deal with. The Teamsters, of
course, are the most infamous
"sweetheart" union in the United
States. Their only real interest is
to get more members so they can
collect more dues.
What a contract says and what
a contract delivers are two very
different things. Taken,. for
example, the Gallo contract. First
it should be pointed out that
often up to 22 percent of a
worker's wage has to go to the
labor contractor who brings him
to work. And all those delightful
extras like insurance, pension
plan, vacations, etc. take a while
to earn. But strangely enough, the
turnover among Gallo workers is
just so high that very, very few
workers ever last long enough to
collect any of these benefits.
That wonderful wage of $2.89
per hour is something worth
thinking about as well. When one
remembers that farmworkers
don't work year round, that they
must travel a great deal, that their
work is some of the hardest
manual labor left in the U.S. and
that labor contractors take big
hunks out of their wages, it
doesn't seem so fine.
The teamsters do nothing
about insecticide poisoning, they
do nothing about the terrible
housing and sanitation facilities,
they do nothing about labor
contractor exploitation, they do
nothing about the staggering
health and educational problems
of the workers, and they do
nothing to enforce their own
contracts. The teamsters aren't a
union they're a racket.

Well, now, let's all take our
magnifying glasses in hand and
turn back to the advertisement
entitled "On the Meaning of
Liberal Arts" on page five of the
Nov. 1 Daily.
The ad, or letter, or article, or
whatever it might be called, tries
to answer questions raised by"A
'Study' of Professors," by Crowe
and O'Laughlin, which appeared
on the Daily's opinions page of
Oct. 24. However, David
Ehrenfeld, apparently the author
of the "article," doesn't answer
very many of the questions that
were raised by the Crowe and
O'Laughlin column. The "article"
is a fine example of the use of
obfuscation to well, to
obfuscate the questions at issue.
Ehrenfeld talks about "what I
want to learn" and "the special
information which I want," but
he never tells us what this "special
information" is. He tells us many
interesting things about
indoctrination, peer group
pressure and "topics which are
difficult to discuss in our
culture." He doesn't explain what
he is trying to find out about
professors here or how this
research is related to
indoctrination, etc.
He says,"l pay for this research
and it's worth every penny." He
doesn't say where the money he
pays for the research comes from,
though.
I shouldn't nitpick, but for a
researcher of 20 years' experience
(as Crowe and O'Laughlin claim
he says he is), Ehrenfeld has lousy
statistical proficency. If I am not
mistaken, the difference between
98 percent and 75 percent is
hardly a "difference of more than
a factor of 10" as he suggests.
Finally, Ehrenfeld wishes to
know of any "better way to learn
what I want to learn." I suggest
that he find an interested student
who would like to initiate a
proposal for an Undergraduate
Special class to supplement his
research. (He himself says that
"there are a great many topics
omitted from a Stanford liberal
arts education.") But I also
suggest that Ehrenfeld already
knows what he wants to learn.

Publicize Defense Measures
Editor:
The Women's Caucus of the
Department of English .and other
Stanford women have been
discussing your recent coverage of
rapes and other assaults against
women.
While we understand that your
making these events known in
some fashion does serve the
community, we are concerned
that the style of your coverage, or
perhaps any coverage at all, may
be inflammatory. We seem to be
living through a rash of such
assaults right now, and it seems at
least possible that news coverage
of one may be partly responsible
for subsequent ones.
As a countermeasure, we
would like to ask that you devote
some space to publicizing
prominently the measures that
Stanford women can take to avoid
and combat sexual assault.
Specifically, we suggest a
front-page story or a full-page
insert on the avoidance,
prevention and combat of sexual
assault on the Stanford campus.
We will be glad to contribute
information we have gathered on
the subject, or help in any way
that we can. Some of us have
already taken measures to defend
ourselves, and all of us can.

98 percent and 75 percent is
hardly a "difference of more than
a factor of 10" as he suggests.
Finally, Ehrenfeld wishes to

that he find an interested student
who would like to initiate a
proposal for an Undergraduate
Special class to supplement his

Editor:
The Women's Caucus of the
Department of English .and other
Stanford women have been
discussing your recent coverage of
rapes and other assaults against
women.
While we understand that your
making these events known in
some fashion does serve the
community, we are concerned
that the style of your coverage, or
perhaps any coverage at all, may
be inflammatory. We seem to be
living through a rash of such
assaults right now, and it seems at
least possible that news coverage
of one may be partly responsible
for subsequent ones.
As a countermeasure, we
would like to ask that you devote
some space to publicizing
prominently the measures that
Stanford women can take to avoid
and combat sexual assault.
Specifically, we suggest a
front-page story or a full-page
insert on the avoidance,
prevention and combat of sexual
assault on the Stanford campus.
We will be glad to contribute
information we have gathered on
the subject, or help in any way
that we can. Some of us have
already taken measures to defend
ourselves, and all of us can.

Replies On Gallo, UFW
Editor:
I am writing in regard to the
article from the Oregon
Barometer, printed in the Nov. 1
Daily. The article claims that
Gallo uses no child labor and that
in fact no one under 18 years of
age is ever hired. This is highly
improbable.
There are 800,000 children
under 16 years of age laboring in
the fields of California. Since
Gallo uses one third of all the
grapes in California, it seems that
a good number of these children
would have to labor in the fields
of Gallo.
Besides, Gallo does not directly
hire the workers. It is the labor
contractor who hires. Without any
direct knowledge of whom the
labor contractor is hiring, the
winemakers cannot make accurate
claims as to who is actually
working in the fields.
The article also states that
Gallo views itself as having been,
"caught in the middle of a
jurisdictional dispute between the
two unions and has been unfairly
subjected to vilification." It is a
fact that Gallo has a campaign to
discredit the UFW which
supplements the Teamsters with
$lOO,OOO a month.
Because of continuous efforts
of Gallo and of the Teamsters to
discredit the UFW and to deny
farmworkers their right to
collective bargaining, I feel that
we should support the boycott of
Gallo wines, which includes all
wines from Modesto.

The article from the Oregon
Barometer that the Daily
reprinted Friday is a perfect
example of how outright lies and
selective misinformation can
completely distort an issue.
It is an outright lie to call the
UFW-Teamster dispute simply a
"jurisdictional" one. The
Teamsters were invited into the
fields by the growers because the
growers knew they would have to
have some sort of a union, and
they wanted one they could make
a deal with. The Teamsters, of
course, are the most infamous
"sweetheart" union in the United
States. Their only real interest is
to get more members so they can
collect more dues.
What a contract says and what
a contract delivers are two very
different things. Taken,. for
example, the Gallo contract. First
it should be pointed out that
often up to 22 percent of a
worker's wage has to go to the
labor contractor who brings him
to work. And all those delightful
extras like insurance, pension
plan, vacations, etc. take a while
to earn. But strangely enough, the
turnover among Gallo workers is
just so high that very, very few
workers ever last long enough to
collect any of these benefits.
That wonderful wage of $2.89
per hour is something worth
thinking about as well. When one
remembers that farmworkers
don't work year round, that they
must travel a great deal, that their
work is some of the hardest
manual labor left in the U.S. and
that labor contractors take big
hunks out of their wages, it
doesn't seem so fine.
The teamsters do nothing
about insecticide poisoning, they
do nothing about the terrible
housing and sanitation facilities,
they do nothing about labor
contractor exploitation, they do
nothing about the staggering
health and educational problems
of the workers, and they do
nothing to enforce their own
contracts. The teamsters aren't a
union they're a racket.

collect more dues.
What a contract says and what
a contract delivers are two very
different things. Taken,. for
example, the Gallo contract. First
it should be pointed out that
often up to 22 percent of a
worker's wage has to go to the
labor contractor who brings him
to work. And all those delightful
extras like insurance, pension
plan, vacations, etc. take a while
to earn. But strangely enough, the
turnover among Gallo workers is
just so high that very, very few
workers ever last long enough to
collect any of these benefits.
That wonderful wage of $2.89
per hour is something worth
thinking about as well. When one
remembers that farmworkers
don't work year round, that they
must travel a great deal, that their
work is some of the hardest
manual labor left in the U.S. and
that labor contractors take big
hunks out of their wages, it
doesn't seem so fine.
The teamsters do nothing
about insecticide poisoning, they
do nothing about the terrible
housing and sanitation facilities,
they do nothing about labor
contractor exploitation, they do
nothing about the staggering
health and educational problems
of the workers, and they do
nothing to enforce their own
contracts. The teamsters aren't a
union they're a racket.

Well, now, let's all take our
magnifying glasses in hand and
turn back to the advertisement
entitled "On the Meaning of
Liberal Arts" on page five of the
Nov. 1 Daily.
The ad, or letter, or article, or
whatever it might be called, tries
to answer questions raised by"A
'Study' of Professors," by Crowe
and O'Laughlin, which appeared
on the Daily's opinions page of
Oct. 24. However, David
Ehrenfeld, apparently the author
of the "article," doesn't answer
very many of the questions that
were raised by the Crowe and
O'Laughlin column. The "article"
is a fine example of the use of
obfuscation to well, to
obfuscate the questions at issue.
Ehrenfeld talks about "what I
want to learn" and "the special
information which I want," but
he never tells us what this "special
information" is. He tells us many
interesting things about
indoctrination, peer group
pressure and "topics which are
difficult to discuss in our
culture." He doesn't explain what
he is trying to find out about
professors here or how this
research is related to
indoctrination, etc.
He says,"l pay for this research
and it's worth every penny." He
doesn't say where the money he
pays for the research comes from,
though.
I shouldn't nitpick, but for a
researcher of 20 years' experience
(as Crowe and O'Laughlin claim
he says he is), Ehrenfeld has lousy
statistical proficency. If I am not
mistaken, the difference between
98 percent and 75 percent is
hardly a "difference of more than
a factor of 10" as he suggests.
Finally, Ehrenfeld wishes to
know of any "better way to learn
what I want to learn." I suggest
that he find an interested student
who would like to initiate a
proposal for an Undergraduate
Special class to supplement his
research. (He himself says that
"there are a great many topics
omitted from a Stanford liberal
arts education.") But I also
suggest that Ehrenfeld already
knows what he wants to learn.

Publicize Defense Measures
Editor:
The Women's Caucus of the
Department of English .and other
Stanford women have been
discussing your recent coverage of
rapes and other assaults against
women.
While we understand that your
making these events known in
some fashion does serve the
community, we are concerned
that the style of your coverage, or
perhaps any coverage at all, may
be inflammatory. We seem to be
living through a rash of such
assaults right now, and it seems at
least possible that news coverage
of one may be partly responsible
for subsequent ones.
As a countermeasure, we
would like to ask that you devote
some space to publicizing
prominently the measures that
Stanford women can take to avoid
and combat sexual assault.
Specifically, we suggest a
front-page story or a full-page
insert on the avoidance,
prevention and combat of sexual
assault on the Stanford campus.
We will be glad to contribute
information we have gathered on
the subject, or help in any way
that we can. Some of us have

I am writing in regard to the
article from the Oregon
Barometer, printed in the Nov. 1
Daily. The article claims that
Gallo uses no child labor and that
in fact no one under 18 years of
age is ever hired. This is highly
improbable.
There are 800,000 children
under 16 years of age laboring in
the fields of California. Since
Gallo uses one third of all the
grapes in California, it seems that
a good number of these children
would have to labor in the fields
of Gallo.
Besides, Gallo does not directly
hire the workers. It is the labor
contractor who hires. Without any
direct knowledge of whom the
labor contractor is hiring, the
winemakers cannot make accurate
claims as to who is actually
working in the fields.
The article also states that
Gallo views itself as having been,
"caught in the middle of a
jurisdictional dispute between the
two unions and has been unfairly
subjected to vilification." It is a
fact that Gallo has a campaign to
discredit the UFW which
supplements the Teamsters with
$lOO,OOO a month.
Because of continuous efforts
of Gallo and of the Teamsters to
discredit the UFW and to deny
farmworkers their right to
collective bargaining, I feel that
we should support the boycott of
Gallo wines, which includes all

The article from the Oregon

It is an outright lie to call the

fields by the growers because the
growers knew they would have to
have some sort of a union, and
they wanted one they could make

the subject, or help in any way
that we can. Some of us have
already taken measures to defend
ourselves, and all of us can.

Replies On Gallo, UFW
Editor:
I am writing in regard to the
article from the Oregon
Barometer, printed in the Nov. 1
Daily. The article claims that
Gallo uses no child labor and that
in fact no one under 18 years of
age is ever hired. This is highly
improbable.
There are 800,000 children
under 16 years of age laboring in
the fields of California. Since
Gallo uses one third of all the
grapes in California, it seems that
a good number of these children
would have to labor in the fields
of Gallo.
Besides, Gallo does not directly
hire the workers. It is the labor
contractor who hires. Without any
direct knowledge of whom the
labor contractor is hiring, the
winemakers cannot make accurate
claims as to who is actually
working in the fields.
The article also states that
Gallo views itself as having been,
"caught in the middle of a
jurisdictional dispute between the
two unions and has been unfairly
subjected to vilification." It is a
fact that Gallo has a campaign to
discredit the UFW which
supplements the Teamsters with
$lOO,OOO a month.
Because of continuous efforts
of Gallo and of the Teamsters to
discredit the UFW and to deny
farmworkers their right to
collective bargaining, I feel that
we should support the boycott of
Gallo wines, which includes all
wines from Modesto.

Editor:
The article from the Oregon
Barometer that the Daily
reprinted Friday is a perfect
example of how outright lies and
selective misinformation can
completely distort an issue.
It is an outright lie to call the
UFW-Teamster dispute simply a
"jurisdictional" one. The
Teamsters were invited into the
fields by the growers because the
growers knew they would have to
have some sort of a union, and
they wanted one they could make
a deal with. The Teamsters, of
course, are the most infamous
"sweetheart" union in the United
States. Their only real interest is
to get more members so they can
collect more dues.
What a contract says and what
a contract delivers are two very
different things. Taken,. for
example, the Gallo contract. First
it should be pointed out that
often up to 22 percent of a
worker's wage has to go to the
labor contractor who brings him
to work. And all those delightful
extras like insurance, pension
plan, vacations, etc. take a while
to earn. But strangely enough, the
turnover among Gallo workers is
just so high that very, very few
workers ever last long enough to
collect any of these benefits.
That wonderful wage of $2.89
per hour is something worth
thinking about as well. When one
remembers that farmworkers
don't work year round, that they
must travel a great deal, that their
work is some of the hardest
manual labor left in the U.S. and
that labor contractors take big
hunks out of their wages, it
doesn't seem so fine.
The teamsters do nothing
about insecticide poisoning, they
do nothing about the terrible
housing and sanitation facilities,
they do nothing about labor
contractor exploitation, they do
nothing about the staggering
health and educational problems
of the workers, and they do
nothing to enforce their own
contracts. The teamsters aren't a
union they're a racket.

More On Survey
Editor:
Well, now, let's all take our
magnifying glasses in hand and
turn back to the advertisement
entitled "On the Meaning of
Liberal Arts" on page five of the
Nov. 1 Daily.
The ad, or letter, or article, or
whatever it might be called, tries
to answer questions raised by"A
'Study' of Professors," by Crowe
and O'Laughlin, which appeared
on the Daily's opinions page of
Oct. 24. However, David
Ehrenfeld, apparently the author
of the "article," doesn't answer
very many of the questions that
were raised by the Crowe and
O'Laughlin column. The "article"
is a fine example of the use of
obfuscation to well, to
obfuscate the questions at issue.
Ehrenfeld talks about "what I
want to learn" and "the special
information which I want," but
he never tells us what this "special
information" is. He tells us many
interesting things about
indoctrination, peer group
pressure and "topics which are
difficult to discuss in our
culture." He doesn't explain what
he is trying to find out about
professors here or how this
research is related to
indoctrination, etc.
He says,"l pay for this research
and it's worth every penny." He
doesn't say where the money he
pays for the research comes from,
though.
I shouldn't nitpick, but for a
researcher of 20 years' experience
(as Crowe and O'Laughlin claim
he says he is), Ehrenfeld has lousy
statistical proficency. If I am not
mistaken, the difference between
98 percent and 75 percent is
hardly a "difference of more than
a factor of 10" as he suggests.
Finally, Ehrenfeld wishes to
know of any "better way to learn
what I want to learn." I suggest
that he find an interested student
who would like to initiate a
proposal for an Undergraduate
Special class to supplement his
research. (He himself says that
"there are a great many topics
omitted from a Stanford liberal
arts education.") But I also
suggest that Ehrenfeld already
knows what he wants to learn.

Publicize Defense Measures
Editor:
The Women's Caucus of the
Department of English .and other
Stanford women have been
discussing your recent coverage of
rapes and other assaults against
women.
While we understand that your
making these events known in
some fashion does serve the
community, we are concerned
that the style of your coverage, or
perhaps any coverage at all, may
be inflammatory. We seem to be
living through a rash of such
assaults right now, and it seems at
least possible that news coverage
of one may be partly responsible
for subsequent ones.
As a countermeasure, we
would like to ask that you devote
some space to publicizing
prominently the measures that
Stanford women can take to avoid
and combat sexual assault.
Specifically, we suggest a
front-page story or a full-page
insert on the avoidance,
prevention and combat of sexual
assault on the Stanford campus.
We will be glad to contribute
information we have gathered on
the subject, or help in any way
that we can. Some of us have
already taken measures to defend
ourselves, and all of us can.
