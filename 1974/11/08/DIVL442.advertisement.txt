EXPAND YOUR
RECREATIONAL AREA
IN AN AIRPLANE
\
After a week of hard studying, you want your weekends
for recreation. Since that time is at a minimum, you
don't want to spend a lot of it in a car.
Tahoe ski areas are 4 hours by car, but only 1 hour
by plane.
Let NYSTROM AVIATION, only 10 minutes from the
Stanford campus at the Palo Alto airport (327-7643)
place you in the pilot's seat of a new Piper or Cessna.
