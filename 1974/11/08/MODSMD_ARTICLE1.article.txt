Students with innovative ideas to
improve education or the quality of
life for undergraduates may now draw
on a special $4OOO fund to help
finance their projects.
Alice Supton, director of the
Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE), said
that up to $750 will be awarded to
student-initiated projects as "seed
money."
"This is seed money, available to
undergraduates who develop
innovative, exciting projects . .. gen
erally in the academic areas, or in the
quality of undergraduate life," she
explained.
Guidelines for the projects were
deliberately left open-ended, Supton
added.
'Creative Thinking'
"It covers such a wide range of
things that I hope it stimulates people
to think creatively about
undergraduate education," she
elaborated.
"Some people have ideas but don't
know where to go with
them . .. [SCIRE] can also act as a
liaison for students and as a
clearinghouse for ideas," she noted.
Supton gave examples of possible
projects.
"I'd emphasize the academic and
curricular proposals. Perhaps
somebody could form a library of
resources for a particular course.
Maybe there needs to be a course of
social sciences methodology," she
explained.
Non-curricular suggestions would
also be considered, Supton said.
Possibilities
"Maybe somebody would like to
set up bike paths around the History
Corner. Or, there is a lack of a real
union—a student lounge center.

Perhaps a proliferation of coffee
houses" would help solve the problem,
Supton noted.
"Another new thing we're doing is
task forces to investigate
undergraduate life," Supton added.
"We're going to be oriented to
specific, implementable results."
The first proposed task force will
focus on the problems of incoming
