# SCIRE Opens Fund For Student Projects
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Students with innovative ideas to
improve education or the quality of
life for undergraduates may now draw
on a special $4OOO fund to help
finance their projects.
Alice Supton, director of the
Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE), said
that up to $750 will be awarded to
student-initiated projects as "seed
money."
"This is seed money, available to
undergraduates who develop
innovative, exciting projects . .. gen
erally in the academic areas, or in the
quality of undergraduate life," she
explained.
Guidelines for the projects were
deliberately left open-ended, Supton
added.
'Creative Thinking'
"It covers such a wide range of
things that I hope it stimulates people
to think creatively about
undergraduate education," she
elaborated.
"Some people have ideas but don't
know where to go with
them . .. [SCIRE] can also act as a
liaison for students and as a
clearinghouse for ideas," she noted.
Supton gave examples of possible
projects.
"I'd emphasize the academic and
curricular proposals. Perhaps
somebody could form a library of
resources for a particular course.
Maybe there needs to be a course of
social sciences methodology," she
explained.
Non-curricular suggestions would
also be considered, Supton said.
Possibilities
"Maybe somebody would like to
set up bike paths around the History
Corner. Or, there is a lack of a real
union—a student lounge center.

Perhaps a proliferation of coffee
houses" would help solve the problem,
Supton noted.
"Another new thing we're doing is
task forces to investigate
undergraduate life," Supton added.
"We're going to be oriented to
specific, implementable results."
The first proposed task force will
focus on the problems of incoming

transfer students. An organizational
meeting will be held next Friday at
noon in the Women's Clubhouse,
Supton remarked.
'Sensitive Areas'
"This meeting's purpose is not just
to be an anecdotal account of the
difficulties transfers encounter. This is
to make sure N the task force hits
sensitive areas," Supton noted.
She said she considers production
of an Approaching Stanford for
transfer students and specialized
transfer orientation as "sensitive
areas."
"There are certain kinds of things
transfers would benefit from
knowing," Supton declared. "The task
force could decide which questions
should be asked when organizing
orientation for transfers."
The task force could propose
special services for transfers "so they
wouldn't feel like second-class
citizens," Supton said.
It "could investigate setting aside
more housing spaces on campus for
transfers. Openings could be left in
some of the most popular classes [for
transfers to fill]," she concluded.
Forms and instructions are available
in the SCIRE office, 590A Old Union,
and are due by Dec. 2.

Guidelines for the projects were
deliberately left open-ended, Supton
added.
'Creative Thinking'
"It covers such a wide range of
things that I hope it stimulates people
to think creatively about
undergraduate education," she
elaborated.
"Some people have ideas but don't
know where to go with
them . .. [SCIRE] can also act as a
liaison for students and as a
clearinghouse for ideas," she noted.
Supton gave examples of possible
projects.
"I'd emphasize the academic and
curricular proposals. Perhaps
somebody could form a library of
resources for a particular course.
Maybe there needs to be a course of
social sciences methodology," she
explained.
Non-curricular suggestions would
also be considered, Supton said.
Possibilities
"Maybe somebody would like to
set up bike paths around the History
Corner. Or, there is a lack of a real
union—a student lounge center.

Perhaps a proliferation of coffee
houses" would help solve the problem,
Supton noted.
"Another new thing we're doing is
task forces to investigate
undergraduate life," Supton added.
"We're going to be oriented to
specific, implementable results."
The first proposed task force will
focus on the problems of incoming

transfer students. An organizational
meeting will be held next Friday at
noon in the Women's Clubhouse,
Supton remarked.
'Sensitive Areas'
"This meeting's purpose is not just
to be an anecdotal account of the
difficulties transfers encounter. This is
to make sure N the task force hits
sensitive areas," Supton noted.
She said she considers production
of an Approaching Stanford for
transfer students and specialized
transfer orientation as "sensitive
areas."
"There are certain kinds of things
transfers would benefit from
knowing," Supton declared. "The task
force could decide which questions
should be asked when organizing
orientation for transfers."
The task force could propose
special services for transfers "so they
wouldn't feel like second-class
citizens," Supton said.
It "could investigate setting aside
more housing spaces on campus for
transfers. Openings could be left in
some of the most popular classes [for
transfers to fill]," she concluded.
Forms and instructions are available
in the SCIRE office, 590A Old Union,
and are due by Dec. 2.
Students with innovative ideas to
improve education or the quality of
life for undergraduates may now draw
on a special $4OOO fund to help
finance their projects.
Alice Supton, director of the
Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE), said
that up to $750 will be awarded to
student-initiated projects as "seed
money."
"This is seed money, available to
undergraduates who develop
innovative, exciting projects . .. gen
erally in the academic areas, or in the
quality of undergraduate life," she
explained.
