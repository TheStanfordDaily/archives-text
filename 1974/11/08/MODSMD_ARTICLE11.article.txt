# Time Has Come To Recognize Cuba
## 
### Gerald Ewing 
The time has finally come for the United
States to admit that the island of Cuba, less
than 100 miles off the Florida coast, isn't the
foreboding menace that it once was.
This country severed diplomatic ties with
the regime of Fidel Castro in 1961 and
economic relations in 1962. Those policies
were attempts to isolate and economically
strangle the Communist menace lurking but a
short distance from our shores.
As with the isolations of the Soviet Union
and China, it has taken the diplomats in
Washington quite a while to realize that their
moves have failed.
True, nonrecognition has hurt Cuba, but
not as extensively as was hoped. Help from
the Soviet Union in huge quantities and trade
with economic powers such as Canada and
Japan has offset the attempt by the United
States
Because detente is the prevailing foreign
policy philosophy at this time, it would seem
inconsistent not to recognize Cuba in light of
the recognition of China and the Soviet
Union. But then again, U.S. foreign policy
always has been marked by inconsistencies.
U.S. Backed Batista
During the late 19505, when Castro was

fighting for power, the United States backed
Fulgencio Batista, one of the most corrupt
dictators in history.
Castro has accomplished far more in
helping his people than Batista ever did. His
accomplishments in national health,
education and sports activity are worth
noting. *
But the memories of the Cuban missile
crisis still hang over relations between the
two nations.
The argument that having relations with
the United States will help Cuba export
guerilla warfare, isn't sound. Since the death
* of Che Guevara in 1967, Cuba hasn't really
been involved in any revolutionary activities
in Latin America at least they haven't been
exposed.
U.S. Involved Abroad
But during the 1960s and 19705, the
United States seems to have been involved
in the Bay of Pigs invasion, the invasion of
the Dominican Republic and the involvement
of the CIA in Chile.
In mid-November, the Organization of
American States will meet to discuss the

possible lifting of the political and economic
blockade that was imposed in 1964 by a
resolution of the organization.
Let's hope the Ford Administration
delegation will take the lead in ending the
blockade. But don't be surprised if the
United States follows the lead of some other
country.
Major Stumbling Blocks
There are two major stumbling blocks that
must be overcome before any U.S.-Cuban
agreement can be reached. Those are the
millions of dollars of American investments
that Castro nationalized in the 1960s and the
future of the Guantanamo Bay military post.
If agreement can be reached on these
issues, an accord is possible.
But as Castro indicated in a recent speech,
don't expect Cuba to bend over backwards to
reach an agreement with Washington.
They've gotten along without it for many
years and it isn't a necessity.
For an agreement to be reached, both
countries are going to have to give in. And as
Castro indicated Sunday, relations won't be
warm; they will merely be formal.
