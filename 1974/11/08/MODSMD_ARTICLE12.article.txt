# What The Financial Manager Does
## 
### Frank Olivieri 
The recent article regarding the
past and present operation of the
ASSU Financial Manager's Office
in my opinion requires
clarification of and supplemental
information on that office's
history.
David Martin, last year's
financial manager, was without a
doubt the Association's best
manager. When Dave took over
he inherited an operation that was
near collapse. To cite a few
examples:
—The ASSU Travel Service had
lost $lO,OOO because someone
"forgot" to cancel a charter flight.
—The ASSU Special Events
Board registered a $30,000 deficit
for the year; due to gross
mismanagement every concert
lost.
—The ASSU Duplicating
Center had an $ll,OOO deficit on
its books.
—The ASSU banking operation
was in such poor shape that
checks for negative amounts were
being issued.
List Was Endless
The list, quite frankly, was
endless. But with a team of
M.B.A. candidates from the
Graduate School of Business
under his supervision, Martin
eliminated practically every
business problem that was
troubling the Association.
In fact, every ASSU project
turned a profit or broke even.
That few individuals remember
Dave Martin, as claimed in the
Oct. 25 Daily article, is hard to
understand the "turn-around
year" which I describe began in
September, 1973, and ended
June, 1974 only four months
ago!
The operation was transferred
to me free of financial and
managerial problems. This solid
foundation enabled me to expand
student services and, more
importantly, to devote more
attention to "Chaparral-type"
problems. That the Chaparral in
past years had been in debt, and
staffers had slept in the Storke
building, did not make these
activities legitimate.
Problems Overlooked
In fact, they were probably
over-looked because the ASSU
financial re-organization took all
of Dave's efforts, and the

Publications Board was unwilling
to take prompt action on these
and other abuses. But after
consultation with and approval
from the 1974 Publication Board
Chairman, Rich Jaroslovsky, I
took action with the express
purpose of rectifying Chaparral
and Live Oak dilemmas.
The Daily has printed my
quote many times: "I'm trying to
restructure and reorganize the
Publications Board so that we
eliminate publications that are apt
to get into the red." I recognize
that a small publication must have
at least a partial subsidy if it is to
break even.
But then the unbelievable
happens: publications with partial
or whole subsidies come back to
the Pub Board to present another
petition "Remember the $l5OO
you gave us to break-even? Well,
we sort of over-spent again, so, er,
we're going to need additional

funds to get out of the hole."
In the past, the publication
either got the funds or carried the
debt into the following year. This
is what I am attempting to correct
finances and funding.
Fortunately, the Publications
Board is also moving in this
direction.
'Simplistic View'
I can appreciate Glenn Garvin's
perception of my job as involving
approval or disapproval of ASSU
purchase orders. This is too
simplistic a view. Besides
evaluating check requests, I must
monitor and manage ASSU
projects that this year will
generate $l.l million in sales.
There are other not so little
things involved in my job such
as ascertaining that the $115,000
the student body will turn over to
ten student organizations via the
student fee assessment is spent

properly by the groups receiving
these funds. And then there's my
membership on the Publications
Board.
Many individuals and
organizations which have met me
under less than "pleasant"
circumstances believe I am
"abusing power." I would like to
assure the entire community that
my office does not function in a
vacuum. As detailed in the ASSU
Constitution and by-laws, the
business office operates under a
set of fairly defined constraints.
In the final analysis, the
Council of Presidents, ASSU
Senate and ultimately the student
body can demand an accounting
action of my actions, that of the
office staff or that of the ASSU
projects.
