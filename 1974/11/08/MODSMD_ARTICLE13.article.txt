# Must Relieve Efficiency'
## 
### Wilfred Stone 
I took Brad Cornell's advice
(Daily, Oct. 25) and glanced at
the academic calendar, where he
said I would discover "that of the
52 weeks in the year, 15 weeks
(or 29 percent of the time) are
devoted to vacation." On the
contrary, I discovered that only 8
weeks of the year were so devoted
(or'ls percent of the time). I
would have thought that Cornell,
as a graduate student in
economics, would be able to
count better.
Of course, if one eliminates the
end-quarter examination periods,
registration days and
commencement week, one can
pare something from that total.
But it is not Cornell's arithmetic
that bothers me; what bothers me
is his notion of "efficiency."
Does Cornell think that
nothing is going on at a university
unless classes are being held and
the place is swarming with
students? Cornell seems to think
that a university is a group of
buildings, instead of an
educational enterprise; and of

course one who thinks that would
want to keep those buildings
constant in use.
Cornell threatens to leave his
money to Standard Oil rather
than to Stanford in order to
punish us for our inefficiency, an
astonishing proposal in view of
how Standard Oil is ripping off the
American consumer with its
unconscionable profits.
Open Spaces
But before Cornell goes off
mad, I hope he takes time from
what must be his busy life to
consider whether perhaps open
spaces for meditation, thinking,
and even daydreaming are not as
necessary as part of one's
education as the busy work of
class attendance.
I can't prove such a point in
this space, or even present a
convincing case. I can only hope
that Cornell takes the time,
before he starts working for
Standard Oil, to ask where
business "efficiency" has taken
this country.
Among much else, it has been
efficient in polluting the

environment, depleting our
natural resources, creating
unnatural wants, exploiting the
public and encouraging inflation.
Business efficiency, in league with
its captive administration, is
leading us straight into a
depression.
I think Cornell ought to
consider the possibility that
"efficiency" is a bad word a
word standing for much that is
shallow and unthought-through in
American life. Like Gov. Ronald
Reagan, he doesn't seem to
understand that the work of a
teacher or student in a university
does not occur only in the
classroom. That is the tip of the
iceberg. The more important work
occurs in the libraries, in
dormitory rooms, in private
studies, in the summertime and
it could be even at the beach. I
think we badly need relief from
Cornell's "efficiency" and from
the slide-rule mentality that values
it.

economics, would be able to
count better.
Of course, if one eliminates the
end-quarter examination periods,
registration days and
commencement week, one can
pare something from that total.
But it is not Cornell's arithmetic
that bothers me; what bothers me
is his notion of "efficiency."
Does Cornell think that
nothing is going on at a university
unless classes are being held and
the place is swarming with
students? Cornell seems to think
that a university is a group of
buildings, instead of an
educational enterprise; and of

course one who thinks that would
want to keep those buildings
constant in use.
Cornell threatens to leave his
money to Standard Oil rather
than to Stanford in order to
punish us for our inefficiency, an
astonishing proposal in view of
how Standard Oil is ripping off the
American consumer with its
unconscionable profits.
Open Spaces
But before Cornell goes off
mad, I hope he takes time from
what must be his busy life to
consider whether perhaps open
spaces for meditation, thinking,
and even daydreaming are not as
necessary as part of one's
education as the busy work of
class attendance.
I can't prove such a point in
this space, or even present a
convincing case. I can only hope
that Cornell takes the time,
before he starts working for
Standard Oil, to ask where
business "efficiency" has taken
this country.
Among much else, it has been
efficient in polluting the

environment, depleting our
natural resources, creating
unnatural wants, exploiting the
public and encouraging inflation.
Business efficiency, in league with
its captive administration, is
leading us straight into a
depression.
I think Cornell ought to
consider the possibility that
"efficiency" is a bad word a
word standing for much that is
shallow and unthought-through in
American life. Like Gov. Ronald
Reagan, he doesn't seem to
understand that the work of a
teacher or student in a university
does not occur only in the
classroom. That is the tip of the
iceberg. The more important work
occurs in the libraries, in
dormitory rooms, in private
studies, in the summertime and
it could be even at the beach. I
think we badly need relief from
Cornell's "efficiency" and from
the slide-rule mentality that values
it.

I took Brad Cornell's advice
(Daily, Oct. 25) and glanced at
the academic calendar, where he
said I would discover "that of the
52 weeks in the year, 15 weeks
(or 29 percent of the time) are
devoted to vacation." On the
contrary, I discovered that only 8
weeks of the year were so devoted
(or'ls percent of the time). I
would have thought that Cornell,
as a graduate student in
economics, would be able to
count better.
