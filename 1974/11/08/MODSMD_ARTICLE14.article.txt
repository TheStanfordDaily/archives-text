Need For 'Horse Sense'

Re: Ellen Luckingbeal's letter
(Daily, Nov. 4), the common
origin of men and women and the
consequent interpenetration of
the sexes even when they had
become quite separate and
specialized still causes
confusion in the minds of many,
particularly those with an
undeveloped tolerance for
ambiguity.
The fact that there are (and
always have been) individual
women who can outperform most
men in characteristically male
roles does not imply the "total
revolution" in the relation of the
sexes that some breezily predict.
This is particularly clear in the
case of Ella Grasso,whose victory
is readily understandable and
welcome to most of us in these
balanced terms which she herself
espouses. And boy, can we use the
horse sense which makes her
chary of feminine lib and capable
of saying "No man has
discriminated against me!"
Should we really be surprised
that so few women were elected
(noting, for instance, the absence
of women in the Soviet and Israeli
ruling bodies)?
Some mature faculty voices
could be helpful here. One can
hardly expect perspective from
the young. Their very strength
and sense of "immortality" (Jung)
blinds them to the later need for
choice, the simple understanding
which comes when an older
woman looks in a mirror and sees
what full-time job plus home-care
have done to her face. A recent
study reveals the disillusionment
of Swedish women in this regard.
A visit to Russia, or Solzhenitsin,
is equally revealing.
The sports columnist who
recently wrote that only old
fogeys oppose Title IX was merely
being thoughtless, but
Luckingbeal's letter sounded like
a genuine cry of distress. It is
tempting to be funny and say that
"Possess a woman and she is yours
for life" is usually exactly what
happens to many of us boobs. But
it might be more helpful to
reassure the young lady that a
male often experiences quite
comparable existential scandals
from his (loving and beloved)
mama, etc., and I doubt there is
much hope for total revolution in
that area. Maybe the humor is
useful after all. . .

The headline and caption
regarding tuition which
accompanied the Oct. 10 Campus
Conference story by Don Cox
may mislead some readers to
whom "minimal" has
connotations of "very small."
It is certainly true that we have
been and continue to be
concerned about the share of the
cost of a Stanford education
which students and their parents
are expected to bear. That
concern is translated into the
maintenance of substantial
student financial aid programs and
regular assessments of whether
those programs are effective in
assuring that talent and
motivation rather than ability to
pay determine admissions and
enrollment decisions.
At the same time, the
economic forces acting on the
University keep the rates of
expenditure increase high.
Tuition, as the source of half of
the University's Operating Budget
income, is projected to grow
accordingly.
Each year's tuition rate is a
consequence of Stanford's
objective of maintaining and
enhancing academic quality
within the limits of our sources of
income. If we allow academic
quality to erode because we relax
legitimate pressure on any source
of income, we will fail in that
objective just as surely as if we
"price Stanford out of the
market."

Several weeks ago, Frank
Olivieri, ASSU Financial Manager,
stated that Live Oak was a "credit

that Live Oak's fee assessment is

Financially, nothing has

Re: Ellen Luckingbeal's letter
(Daily, Nov. 4), the common
origin of men and women and the
consequent interpenetration of
the sexes even when they had
become quite separate and
specialized still causes
confusion in the minds of many,
particularly those with an
undeveloped tolerance for
ambiguity.
The fact that there are (and
always have been) individual
women who can outperform most
men in characteristically male
roles does not imply the "total
revolution" in the relation of the
sexes that some breezily predict.
This is particularly clear in the
case of Ella Grasso,whose victory
is readily understandable and
welcome to most of us in these
balanced terms which she herself
espouses. And boy, can we use the
horse sense which makes her
chary of feminine lib and capable
of saying "No man has
discriminated against me!"
Should we really be surprised
that so few women were elected
(noting, for instance, the absence
of women in the Soviet and Israeli
ruling bodies)?
Some mature faculty voices
could be helpful here. One can
hardly expect perspective from
the young. Their very strength
and sense of "immortality" (Jung)
blinds them to the later need for
choice, the simple understanding
which comes when an older
woman looks in a mirror and sees
what full-time job plus home-care
have done to her face. A recent
study reveals the disillusionment
of Swedish women in this regard.
A visit to Russia, or Solzhenitsin,
is equally revealing.
The sports columnist who
recently wrote that only old
fogeys oppose Title IX was merely
being thoughtless, but
Luckingbeal's letter sounded like
a genuine cry of distress. It is
tempting to be funny and say that
"Possess a woman and she is yours
for life" is usually exactly what
happens to many of us boobs. But
it might be more helpful to
reassure the young lady that a
male often experiences quite
comparable existential scandals
from his (loving and beloved)
mama, etc., and I doubt there is
much hope for total revolution in
that area. Maybe the humor is
useful after all. . .

The headline and caption

It is certainly true that we have

concerned about the share of the
cost of a Stanford education
which students and their parents
are expected to bear. That
concern is translated into the
maintenance of substantial
student financial aid programs and
regular assessments of whether
those programs are effective in
assuring that talent and
motivation rather than ability to
pay determine admissions and
enrollment decisions.
At the same time, the
economic forces acting on the
University keep the rates of
expenditure increase high.
Tuition, as the source of half of
the University's Operating Budget
income, is projected to grow
accordingly.
Each year's tuition rate is a
consequence of Stanford's
objective of maintaining and
enhancing academic quality
within the limits of our sources of
income. If we allow academic
quality to erode because we relax
legitimate pressure on any source
of income, we will fail in that
objective just as surely as if we
"price Stanford out of the
