# Title IX Puts $$ Squeeze On Athletic Department
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Men in Stanford's Athletic Department and
fraternities can probably sympathize with one
another.
Athletic Department officials fear that
because of budget limitations, the men's
programs will have to suffer if the weaker
women's programs are to be improved.
Likewise, fraternity representatives have
claimed they are losing their draw-exempt
status because of a University housing
shortage which has made women more aware
of the exemptions enjoyed only by fraternity
men.
The whole ruckus has been caused at least
in part by Title IX, a federal law prohibiting
sex discrimination at institutions receiving
federal funding. To comply with the law, the
University must provide equal opportunities
for men and women.

"You can't blame the men's program for
the low level of the women's programs," says
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz.
And yet, with budget cuts likely and most
indoor athletic areas occupied throughout the
day, something in the men's program may
have to give way to free the funds and space
to accommodate women's athletic needs.
Just what cuts could be made is the subject
of a study by the faculty-student
administration Committee on Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation (CAPER);
Ruetz; and Women's Physical Education Prof.
Pamela Strathairn. The president and provost
will take their recommendations under
advisement in making a final decision.
Strathaim and Ruetz cringe at the thought
of identifying specific areas where cuts could
be made.
Strathaim mentions elimination of certain
intramural sports, a reduction in the number

of basic instructional physical education
courses, the elimination of some recreation
opportunities and the reduction of varsity
sports to club status as possible methods of
freeing space and money for the women.
But both she and Ruetz say they have not
decided which cuts, if any, have to be made.
Ruetz is particularly cautious about a
commitment because of uncertainty about
exactly what changes Title IX will require.
Final Title IX regulations will probably be
presented to President Ford for approval in
December.
Strathairn adds that both the men's and
women's athletic departments would be
reluctant to reduce existing programs unless
guaranteed that interest and participation in
the proposed women's programs would
remain strong for a long time.
Scholarship grants are another area in
which there are more outstretched hands than
there is money to fill them.
The Buck Club has its hands full each year
trying to raise enough money to pay off
increasing tuition and room and board rates
for the same number of male athletes.
Redirecting money to women's grants would
require more income if the number of athletic
scholarships for men is to remain the same.
The University could save some money by
no longer awarding room and board grants to
athletes who don't meet financial need
requirements. But such a move might reduce
Stanford's appeal to an athlete who is offered
a full ride at another school.
Vicki Hays, a member of CAPER and of
the Organization of Stanford Woman Athletes
(OSWA), says she hopes 12 women can
receive grants next autumn*
To that end, the OSWA will ask the

provost to allow University fund-raisers to
give high priority to pursuit of donations for
these grants.
But it seems doubtful that money for that
many scholarships can be raised, particularly
because the University would have to
continue some or all of those 12 grants as well
as offer new ones the following autumn.
Ruetz says some of a $200,000 surplus
from football income this year could be used
toward women's scholarships until the women
establish a solid funding base. But he adds
that such a surplus doesn't occur every year,
and thus can not be counted on to continually
support scholarships.
One way to support women's scholarships

each year would entail using the interest
earned annually on large endowments in
banks.
But it would take almost $lOO,OOO to
endow a full-ride scholarship each year, and
that amount of money is hard to come by
these days.
It looks difficult for the Athletic
Department. More people want a more sizable
portion of a budget which, given inflation and
tight money, appears to be shrinking.
But Strathairn doesn't like to regard the
task of making everybody happy as
impossible. "We don't use the word
impossible," she declares. "If we did, we'd
probably quit."
