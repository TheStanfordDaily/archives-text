# NLRB Crushed Grad Students

### DAVID SMITH 
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) decision to bid by the
Stanford Union of Research Physicists
(SURP) to gain collective bargaining power
for graduate student research and teaching
assistants has spared the University from
drastically revamping its relationship with
graduate students.
From the wording of the NLRB's
rejection, moreover, it is evident that the
SURP case will have important national
significance as well: for the near future, at
least, no students who receive research or
teaching money from the schools they are
attending will be officially recognized as
employees with the right to unionize.
The NLRB's assertion that grants to the
physics graduates are not wages, but
payments to help them get their education,
was phrased strongly enough to make it
seem applicable, in the NLRB's estimation,
to all students involved in research at all
universities.
Stanford officials, too, seemed ready to
construe the SURP bid as an unwanted
national precedent: they sought'support in

their case against the union from several
other private universities, and got concrete
aid from three—Columbia, Cornell and
MlT—who filed "friends of the court" briefs
against the SURP position.
For SURP officials, although they claim
they are not overly upset by the NLRB
action, the decision cannot leave much hope
for the kind of say that they had envisioned
in graduate student money grievances.
The Stanford Teaching and Research
Employees Union (STREU), a similar group
which had contemplated the same kind of
NLRB process that SURP went through but
decided against it because it would be too
costly, must also realize that any effort to
gain bargaining power for graduate teaching
assistants is likely to meet a similar fate to
SURP's.
SURP found its unsuccessful recognition
battle almost prohibitively expensive, a fact
which could deter other graduate student
groups from even attempting to bring their
battles before the NLRB.
Although some graduate students have
pointed out that the NLRB report referred
specifically to research assistants (who pay

no taxes on their grants) and not to teaching
assistants (who do) a similar legal fight by an
all-teaching assistant union at least at
Stanford, seems highly unlikely for the near
future.
If there is any major consolation for
SURP and the other graduate unions, it is
that their fight for recognition has forced
the University's graduate studies officials
into the realization that many graduate
students are highly upset over what they feel
are inadequate stipends.
Their protests and the SURP litigation,
which occupied about 20 days of
preliminary hearings this summer, probably
played a large part in the University's setting
up a faculty Ad Hoc Committee on
Stipends, presently considering the
discontented graduate students' demands.
SURP members will have to reconcile
themselves to negotiating stipend issues
pretty much on the University's terms, as
long as they are students. Although they
couldn't get their precedent-setting NLRB
decision, however, they have registered a
significant blow for graduate student
autonomy with their maverick action.

themselves to negotiating stipend issues
pretty much on the University's terms, as
long as they are students. Although they
couldn't get their precedent-setting NLRB
decision, however, they have registered a
significant blow for graduate student
autonomy with their maverick action.
The National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) decision to bid by the
Stanford Union of Research Physicists
(SURP) to gain collective bargaining power
for graduate student research and teaching
assistants has spared the University from
drastically revamping its relationship with
graduate students.
From the wording of the NLRB's
rejection, moreover, it is evident that the
SURP case will have important national
significance as well: for the near future, at
least, no students who receive research or
teaching money from the schools they are
attending will be officially recognized as
employees with the right to unionize.
The NLRB's assertion that grants to the
physics graduates are not wages, but
payments to help them get their education,
was phrased strongly enough to make it
seem applicable, in the NLRB's estimation,
to all students involved in research at all
universities.
Stanford officials, too, seemed ready to
construe the SURP bid as an unwanted
national precedent: they sought'support in

their case against the union from several
other private universities, and got concrete
aid from three—Columbia, Cornell and
MlT—who filed "friends of the court" briefs
against the SURP position.
For SURP officials, although they claim
they are not overly upset by the NLRB
action, the decision cannot leave much hope
for the kind of say that they had envisioned
in graduate student money grievances.
The Stanford Teaching and Research
Employees Union (STREU), a similar group
which had contemplated the same kind of
NLRB process that SURP went through but
decided against it because it would be too
costly, must also realize that any effort to
gain bargaining power for graduate teaching
assistants is likely to meet a similar fate to
SURP's.
SURP found its unsuccessful recognition
battle almost prohibitively expensive, a fact
which could deter other graduate student
groups from even attempting to bring their
battles before the NLRB.
Although some graduate students have
pointed out that the NLRB report referred
specifically to research assistants (who pay

no taxes on their grants) and not to teaching
assistants (who do) a similar legal fight by an
all-teaching assistant union at least at
Stanford, seems highly unlikely for the near
future.
If there is any major consolation for
SURP and the other graduate unions, it is
that their fight for recognition has forced
the University's graduate studies officials
into the realization that many graduate
students are highly upset over what they feel
are inadequate stipends.
Their protests and the SURP litigation,
which occupied about 20 days of
preliminary hearings this summer, probably
played a large part in the University's setting
up a faculty Ad Hoc Committee on
Stipends, presently considering the
discontented graduate students' demands.
SURP members will have to reconcile
themselves to negotiating stipend issues
pretty much on the University's terms, as
long as they are students. Although they
