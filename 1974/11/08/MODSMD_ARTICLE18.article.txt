# Traffic, Planning Snarled On Willow Rd.
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Anyone who has travelled Willow Road at
rush hour is only too well aware of the traffic
snarls that jam it from one end to the other.
In order to ameliorate this situation, the
Palo Alto City Council plans to widen Willow
Road to 90 feet and four lanes between San
Francisquito Creek and El Camino Real.
Most Council members want to make
extension of the road contingent on
Stanford's completion "within a reasonable
period of time" of at least two lanes of
Campus Drive from its present terminus near
the Medical Center to connect withJunipero
Serra Boulevard.
But Council members Alan Henderson and
Enid Pearson argue that the city should refuse
to widen Willow from Arboretum to El
Camino until the University completes
Campus Drive.
The University claims the construction

work, which will cost nearly half a million
dollars, must be carefully budgeted. The
administration strongly favors extension of
Willow Road, however, contending that it
would relieve traffic congestion and improve
business at the Stanford Shopping Center.
Henderson introduced an alternate plan
for a 60-foot four-lane Willow Road between
Arboretum and the creek, but the measure
was defeated.
Both Henderson and Pearson still oppose
the plan adopted by the Council, claiming it
will attract traffic from other areas and
increase congestion on Willow Road.
Although residents of the 6ak Creek
Apartments facing Willow generally favor the
widening, Pearson claims they will regret their
preference when an influx of out-of-town cars
start roaring past at 55 miles an hour.
Pearson and Henderson are also
disappointed that the Council's decision will

force the removal of 43 trees.
But the biggest issue in the Council
controversy is the threat of the proposed
Willow Expressway establishing itself de
facto in Palo Alto.
The expressway would connect Highway
101 with Highway 280 and is generally
opposed by citizens who resent the increased
urbanization of the Peninsula. Although Palo
Alto and Menlo Park have successfully fought
implementation of expressway plans,
Henderson pointed out last week that the
Council's latest plan for Willow Road
completes the expressway except for a link
between El Camino and Middlefield Road.
It now looks like the Council will enforce a
plan that increases the efficiency of" local
traffic flow. But the decision will also
contribute to the tangle of local freeways and
set a precedent for further traffic projects that
now pervade the Bay Area and so much of the
nation.

Willow Expressway establishing itself de
facto in Palo Alto.
The expressway would connect Highway
101 with Highway 280 and is generally
opposed by citizens who resent the increased
urbanization of the Peninsula. Although Palo
Alto and Menlo Park have successfully fought
implementation of expressway plans,
Henderson pointed out last week that the
Council's latest plan for Willow Road
completes the expressway except for a link
between El Camino and Middlefield Road.
It now looks like the Council will enforce a
plan that increases the efficiency of" local
traffic flow. But the decision will also
contribute to the tangle of local freeways and
set a precedent for further traffic projects that
now pervade the Bay Area and so much of the
nation.
Anyone who has travelled Willow Road at
rush hour is only too well aware of the traffic
snarls that jam it from one end to the other.
In order to ameliorate this situation, the
Palo Alto City Council plans to widen Willow
Road to 90 feet and four lanes between San
Francisquito Creek and El Camino Real.
Most Council members want to make
extension of the road contingent on
Stanford's completion "within a reasonable
period of time" of at least two lanes of
Campus Drive from its present terminus near
the Medical Center to connect withJunipero
Serra Boulevard.
But Council members Alan Henderson and
Enid Pearson argue that the city should refuse
to widen Willow from Arboretum to El
Camino until the University completes
Campus Drive.
The University claims the construction

work, which will cost nearly half a million
dollars, must be carefully budgeted. The
administration strongly favors extension of
Willow Road, however, contending that it
would relieve traffic congestion and improve
business at the Stanford Shopping Center.
Henderson introduced an alternate plan
for a 60-foot four-lane Willow Road between
Arboretum and the creek, but the measure
was defeated.
Both Henderson and Pearson still oppose
the plan adopted by the Council, claiming it
will attract traffic from other areas and
increase congestion on Willow Road.
Although residents of the 6ak Creek
Apartments facing Willow generally favor the
widening, Pearson claims they will regret their
preference when an influx of out-of-town cars
start roaring past at 55 miles an hour.
Pearson and Henderson are also
disappointed that the Council's decision will

force the removal of 43 trees.
But the biggest issue in the Council
controversy is the threat of the proposed
Willow Expressway establishing itself de
facto in Palo Alto.
The expressway would connect Highway
101 with Highway 280 and is generally
opposed by citizens who resent the increased
urbanization of the Peninsula. Although Palo
