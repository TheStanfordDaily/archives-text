# Democrats Score Sweep-But It Wasn't A Landslide
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
For California Democrats, it was a sweep
but not a landslide.
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr.
returned the statehouse to Democratic control
after eight years of Ronald Reagan, but
figures indicated his percentage margin of
victory was the narrowest since 1906.
Meanwhile, Democrats were winning
comfortably in all but one statewide race and
were tightening their control of the
legislature, making this year their best since
1958.
Republican candidates themselves
attributed their defeats to the economy,
Watergate, Nixon and his pardon. Houston
Flournoy, the state controller v and
gubernatorial nominee, said in his Wednesday
concession speech that despite all else, he still
would have won if not for the pardon. "If
that hadn't happened, we might* well have
kept rolling," he said.
Closer
Nonetheless, Flournoy came closer than
most pollsters had predicted. But the polls
were just about on the money in most other
races, including Sen. Alan Cranston's smashing
re-election over state Sen. H.L. Richardson by
a plurality of almost 1.5 million.
Tuesday's results created something of a
leadership vacuum within the state GOP. The
party isn't used to being out of power
Brown is just the third Democratic governor
since 1894 and only managed to capture
one state office.
In that race, incumbent Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger won re-election over attorney
William Norris. But one campaign issue may
linger to trouble Younger: his alleged
involvement in the GeoTek oil drilling
scandal. And if that issue becomes more
troublesome, as recent disclosures indicate it
may, Younger will be in no shape to assume
political control of a party struggling out from
under the stigma of Watergate.
Too Bad For Ford
The California results could scarcely
provide comfort for President Ford. Despite
his appearances in the state for Flournoy and
for GOP congressional candidates, the
congressional delegation went 28-15
Democratic.
And Ford now has almost no friends in

office in a state that is usually crucial to
presidential elections.
Brown, meanwhile, was immediately and
prematurely being touted as a national
ticket possibility in 1976. But he inherits one
of the toughest jobs in the nation at a time
when the sagging economy, rising inflation
and already high unemployment are making it
more difficult than ever before to govern the
state.
And Brown will have to do it without a
resounding mandate. "The public had the
feeling that the statehouse was not where our
problems can be solved," said pollster Mervin
Field after the votes were counted. "The
voters are not ready to embrace Brown yet.
They are hopeful, but they have their
doubts."
Brown will have to allay those doubts
before he can be considered even a
semi-serious candidate for higher office. And
chances are he'd be competing against a
bumper crop of other governors, including
Hugh Carey of New York, Reubin Askew of
Florida, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts
and Milton, Shapp of Pennsylvania, all of
whom won election or re-election Tuesday.

under the stigma of Watergate.
Too Bad For Ford
The California results could scarcely
provide comfort for President Ford. Despite
his appearances in the state for Flournoy and
for GOP congressional candidates, the
congressional delegation went 28-15
Democratic.
And Ford now has almost no friends in

office in a state that is usually crucial to
presidential elections.
Brown, meanwhile, was immediately and
prematurely being touted as a national
ticket possibility in 1976. But he inherits one
of the toughest jobs in the nation at a time
when the sagging economy, rising inflation
and already high unemployment are making it
more difficult than ever before to govern the
state.
And Brown will have to do it without a
resounding mandate. "The public had the
feeling that the statehouse was not where our
problems can be solved," said pollster Mervin
Field after the votes were counted. "The
voters are not ready to embrace Brown yet.
They are hopeful, but they have their
doubts."
Brown will have to allay those doubts
before he can be considered even a
semi-serious candidate for higher office. And
chances are he'd be competing against a
bumper crop of other governors, including
Hugh Carey of New York, Reubin Askew of
Florida, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts
and Milton, Shapp of Pennsylvania, all of
whom won election or re-election Tuesday.


Edmund Brown Jr
For California Democrats, it was a sweep
but not a landslide.
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr.
returned the statehouse to Democratic control
after eight years of Ronald Reagan, but
figures indicated his percentage margin of
victory was the narrowest since 1906.
Meanwhile, Democrats were winning
comfortably in all but one statewide race and
were tightening their control of the
legislature, making this year their best since
1958.
Republican candidates themselves
attributed their defeats to the economy,
Watergate, Nixon and his pardon. Houston
Flournoy, the state controller v and
gubernatorial nominee, said in his Wednesday
concession speech that despite all else, he still
would have won if not for the pardon. "If
that hadn't happened, we might* well have
kept rolling," he said.
Closer
Nonetheless, Flournoy came closer than
most pollsters had predicted. But the polls
were just about on the money in most other
races, including Sen. Alan Cranston's smashing
re-election over state Sen. H.L. Richardson by
a plurality of almost 1.5 million.
Tuesday's results created something of a
leadership vacuum within the state GOP. The
party isn't used to being out of power
Brown is just the third Democratic governor
since 1894 and only managed to capture
one state office.
In that race, incumbent Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger won re-election over attorney
William Norris. But one campaign issue may
linger to trouble Younger: his alleged
involvement in the GeoTek oil drilling
scandal. And if that issue becomes more
troublesome, as recent disclosures indicate it
may, Younger will be in no shape to assume
political control of a party struggling out from
under the stigma of Watergate.

provide comfort for President Ford. Despite
his appearances in the state for Flournoy and
