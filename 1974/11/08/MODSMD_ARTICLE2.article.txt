# NLRB Crushes Physicists' Bid For Bargaining Unit Approval
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
The National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB) has rejected a bid by
the Stanford Union of Research
Physicists (SURP) to achieve
bargaining power for 83 research
assistants (RAs) in the Physics
Department.
The NLRB decision was rendered
earlier this week
The board ruled that "payments
[to the RAs] are not wages and the
RAs are not 'employees' as defined in
the [National Labor Relations] Act."
"We are not really surprised by # the
decision," said SURP vice president
Mike O'Connor. "It is really
unfortunate that the situation can't be
changed, but the decision is consistent
with the tone of everything the NLRB
has done recently."
James Siena, legal adviser to
President Richard Lyman, called the
NLRB decision "a very sound one. I
prefer to think of it not as a rejection
of SURP, but as an affirmation of our
position," he said.
Thought It Was Right
"We worked for our position
because we thought it was right, and
we are glad that the NLRB saw things
the same way," he added.
In its eight-page final report on the
case, the NLRB emphasized that, since
the RAs pay no taxes on their grants,
receive course credit toward their
degrees for their work and "have the
privileges enjoyed by students," they
do not qualify as regular employees,
but are "primarily students."
The report said that the Board
"carefully considered" briefs from
Columbia, Cornell and MIT submitted
at Stanford's request and supporting
the University's position. SURP had
moved to have these briefs disallowed.
SURP's O'Connor said he was "not

too surprised" by the timing of the
decision, although it came several
months earlier than he had predicted
last week.
Fast Decision
"Since it was a rejection, it was a
relatively fast decision," he noted. "If
they were going to accept our petition,
they would have waited a much longer
time.
"The settlement doesn't represent
too much of a negative setback for our
union, though if we-had won, it would
have been a very positive gain. Now we
will have no restrictions on us; we
won't be bound by any labor laws, and
we can concentrate on all aspects of
graduate education."
"I think it was a very cowardly
decision," said Leslie Daniels,

president of the Stanford Teaching
and Research Employees Union
(STREU), another graduate student
group. "It should have been expected
because the courts represent the most
vested interests and usually rule in
favor of the most powerful group."
'Not Much Doubt'
"There wasn't really too much
doubt about the way it would turn
out, since Stanford spent so much
money making their case," she added.
She said STREU decided "not to go
the legal route" because it would cost
too much.
"We're continuing to sign up people
for our union," she noted, "and
although the decision was a very bad
one it shouldn't really slow our union
down."

O'Connor said he thought SURP's
unsuccessful legal battle was directly
responsible for the creation of a new
faculty Ad Hoc Committee on
Stipends. "We think there's a stipend
increase in the offing, and that's
something I think we can take a good
deal of credit for," he stated.
"We tried to settle this with the
University during the preliminary
NLRB hearing, but (Assoc. Dean of
Graduate Studies J. Merrill] Carlsmith
was telling us things that were
ridiculous," he said. "He was offering
us things that we already had.
"Now, although we will be
approaching the University on a more
inforfnal basis, we don't count on
losing any strength in our stipend
negotiations."
