# Mid-term Democratic Convention
## Stanford Contingent Seeks Delegate Spots 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Santa Clara County Democrats
will meet in Mountain View
tomorrow to select three delegates
to the National Democratic
Charter Conference, to be held
Dec. 6-8 in Kansas City.
Stanford undergraduates Chris
Gray and Irman Nogales, staff
member Joshua Goldstein and
Law Prof. William Gould are
among the 15 candidates for the
positions.
The national convention will
consider and adopt a permanent
charter for the Democratic party.
The question of affirmative action
for minority groups is expected to
emerge as a controversial issue.
Gray, Nogales and Goldstein
strongly favor affirmative action
and are cooperating in their
campaign effort, hoping to pack
Saturday's caucus with
supporters.
Gray said the Stanford
contingent is one of the only
groups he knows of that actually
has an organization of sorts
behind it. He predicted that this
will give the Stanford candidates
an advantage over other
contenders.
The three candidates are

supported by the Palo Alto
Tenant's Union, Stanford's
Columbae House and the
Grapevine, a counterculture
publication,
"I think that the next
presidential candidate will be
determined by the type of rules
made at the Kansas City
convention," Gray said.
He explained that if the charter
encourages minority and youth
participation in the 1976 delegate
selection process, Democrats will
be more likely to nominate' a
liberal candidate.
Gould said he also favors
affirmative action, noting that he
has represented black and chicano
plaintiffs in cases throughout the
country.
Teaching Experience
He claimed that his experience
teaching labor law and
employment discrimination law
gives him the sort of expertise
that would prove useful at the
Kansas City convention.
Gould said he has no campaign
organization behind him and is
not certain how the other
candidates stand on affirmative
action.
Both Gould and Gray noted
that they hope to see the
Democratic Party become a more
issue-oriented group and view the
Kansas City gathering as a method
of achieving that goal.
They added that the
convention should help make the
party more open and democratic.
Probably the best known

candidate seeking election as a
Santa Clara County delegate is
Thomas Skornia, a Palo Alto
attorney who ranked second last
June in a four-way race for the
Democratic nomination in the
12th Congressional District.
Skornia also favors affirmative
action, and told the Daily this
week that the December
convention should serve as a
unifying force for the Democrats.
Strength In Diversity
Although Skornia
acknowledged that the convention
would bring out some divisions in
the party, he noted that
Democrats are used to divisions
and usually find strength in their
diversity.
According to Gray, the
convention may be dominated
either by practitioners of the
"New Politics" or by more
traditional Democrats.
He cited a New York Times
survey showing that 39 percent of
the delegates are expected to be
McGovernite liberals, 2 percent
Wallaceites and 11 percent
potential supporters of
McGovern-style liberalism.
Gray said that the apparent
closeness of the left-right
dichotomy is another reason why
he considers it important for
Santa Clara County to send
liberals to Kansas City.
He noted that several of the
candidates are conservatives who
supported San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto in his bid for the
California governorship last
spring.

party more open and democratic.
Probably the best known

candidate seeking election as a
Santa Clara County delegate is
Thomas Skornia, a Palo Alto
attorney who ranked second last
June in a four-way race for the
Democratic nomination in the
12th Congressional District.
Skornia also favors affirmative
action, and told the Daily this
week that the December
convention should serve as a
unifying force for the Democrats.
Strength In Diversity
Although Skornia
acknowledged that the convention
would bring out some divisions in
the party, he noted that
Democrats are used to divisions
and usually find strength in their
diversity.
According to Gray, the
convention may be dominated
either by practitioners of the
"New Politics" or by more
traditional Democrats.
He cited a New York Times
survey showing that 39 percent of
the delegates are expected to be
McGovernite liberals, 2 percent
Wallaceites and 11 percent
potential supporters of
McGovern-style liberalism.
Gray said that the apparent
closeness of the left-right
dichotomy is another reason why
he considers it important for
Santa Clara County to send
liberals to Kansas City.
He noted that several of the
candidates are conservatives who
supported San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto in his bid for the
California governorship last
spring.

POTENTIAL DELEGATE—Law Prof. William Gould is among 15
Santa Clara County candidates seeking three delegate spots for the
National Democratic Charter Conference in Kansas City Dec. 6-8.
Stanford undergraduates Chris Gray and Irman Nogales and staff
member Joshua Goldstein are also in the running for delegate
positions, which will be determined tomorrow at a meeting in
Mountain View.
Santa Clara County Democrats
will meet in Mountain View
tomorrow to select three delegates
to the National Democratic
Charter Conference, to be held
Dec. 6-8 in Kansas City.
Stanford undergraduates Chris
Gray and Irman Nogales, staff
member Joshua Goldstein and
Law Prof. William Gould are
among the 15 candidates for the
positions.
The national convention will
consider and adopt a permanent
charter for the Democratic party.
The question of affirmative action
for minority groups is expected to
emerge as a controversial issue.
Gray, Nogales and Goldstein
strongly favor affirmative action
and are cooperating in their
campaign effort, hoping to pack
Saturday's caucus with
supporters.
Gray said the Stanford
contingent is one of the only
groups he knows of that actually
has an organization of sorts
behind it. He predicted that this
will give the Stanford candidates
an advantage over other
contenders.
The three candidates are

supported by the Palo Alto
Tenant's Union, Stanford's
Columbae House and the
Grapevine, a counterculture
publication,
"I think that the next
presidential candidate will be
determined by the type of rules
made at the Kansas City
convention," Gray said.
He explained that if the charter
encourages minority and youth
participation in the 1976 delegate
selection process, Democrats will
be more likely to nominate' a
liberal candidate.
Gould said he also favors
affirmative action, noting that he
has represented black and chicano
plaintiffs in cases throughout the
country.
Teaching Experience
He claimed that his experience
teaching labor law and
employment discrimination law
gives him the sort of expertise
that would prove useful at the
Kansas City convention.
Gould said he has no campaign
organization behind him and is
not certain how the other
candidates stand on affirmative
action.
Both Gould and Gray noted
that they hope to see the
Democratic Party become a more
issue-oriented group and view the
Kansas City gathering as a method
of achieving that goal.
They added that the
convention should help make the
party more open and democratic.
