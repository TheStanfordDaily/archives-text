# Gregory Address Finalized

### 
Comedian-turned activist Dick
Gregory will speak here this
Wednesday in the last
presentation of the quarter by the
ASSU Speakers' Bureau.
He will discuss "Social-
Problems: Social or Antisocial?"
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Church.
Gregory, who calls himself
"the world's foremost freelance
humanitarian," has gained
headlines in the past by fasting to
demonstrate opposition to the
war in Vietnam, the illicit drug
traffic in the ghettos and other
socio-political topics.
Born in a St. Louis ghetto,
Gregory was an outstanding track
and field star in high school and
later at Southern Illinois
University.
He is currently writing a social
commentary on The Bible.
