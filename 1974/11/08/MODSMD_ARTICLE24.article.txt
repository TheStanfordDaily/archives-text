## The 						World Of Cinema New Disaster Locale: Underground 
### George Powell 
pisaster has been afflicting the
movies lately, and that's what
exhibitors want more of as they
groan all the way to the bank
under the weight of box office
receipts.
Disaster these days is big box
office medicine for movies, and
the biggest stimulant for ticket
sales since Shaft began kicking
honky asses and fondling foxy
female ones.
Disaster is everywhere, in the
air, on land and sea. But where
has disaster (man-made or natural)
yet to strike? How about
underground? That's what this
week's movies deal with,
underground disaster and drama,
although in both what happens
underground depends a lot on
what's going on topside. Other

than the heavy action
underground, the movies actually
have little in common.
The Taking of Pelham One,
Two, Three, with Walter Matthau,
is to Gold, with Roger Moore,
what Sherlock Holmes is to James
Bond. Don't be confused, Gold is
not a James Bond movie, although
Moore and his well-developed bod
do quite a few Bondish things in
the movie.
Familiar Role
Matthau, on the other hand,
recreates his wise-cracking cop
with the dry wit role from The
Laughing Policeman, this time as
Lt. Garber of the New York City
Transit Police, who must
negotiate with a dastardly
foursome who have hijacked a
subway train, and figure out how

they are going to get away with it.
The chief villain is Robert
Shaw, a cool, calculating former
mercenary soldier, who works
crossword puzzles while awaiting
delivery of the $1 million ransom
they hope to get for the subway
car and its 17 passengers. The role
is Shaw's best evil portrayal since
his strong, silent KGB assassin in
From Russia With Love.
Shaw is rbetted by Martin
Balsam, a disgruntled former
transit employee who was
discharged for allegedly being
involved in a drug running
scheme. Matthau is aided by the
whole police power of New York
City to bring the hijackers to
justice, but to get anything
accomplished he has to cut
through a thick layer bf

bureaucracy held together by the
roughest language heard by public
servants since the White House
tapes.
For instance, the mayor of
New York, abed with the flu,
summarizes the situation like this,
"Shit, piss, fuck!" And a transit
employee has this to say, "I don't
give a rat's ass about the fucking
hijackers." The mayor's chief
assistant admonishes everyone to
"quit farting around," and
decisions are made somehow
despite the haze of blue language.
The now-verbal action in
Pelham is straightforward and
realistic, so the one-step-at-a-time
presentation makes the ending
very predictable, although one
moviegoer was heard to wonder
â€¢how movies like The Taking of
Pelham One, Two, Three are going
to lure more people onto public
transportation.

Gold takes a different
approach making South African
gold mining seem fascinating and
dangerous, overlaying the whole
operation with a Bondian-style
melodrama. The bad guys are
Bradford Dillman and John
Gielgud, who want to cause a
disaster in the big Sondegaard
gold mine, owned by
cigar-chomping tycoon Ray
Milland, so the baddies can make
a killing in the world gold market.
The soap-operatic
complications are caused by
Susannah York, Milland's
granddaughter, who is married to
Dillman. Roger Moore, who is a
middle-management type, is
promoted to general manger by
Dillman, but Moore strikes York's
fancy, and vice-versa, so Moore's
having an affair with the mine
director's wife.
Meanwhile, there's this big
underground pocket of water that
Dillman has the miners drilling
toward, having told them there's
gold there. Break through and the
whole mine's flooded. You get the
idea.
Moore wears a lot of shirts
open at the neck, to show his
manly chest. Dillman has a
cleanliness fetish, Milland is gruff
and lovable and York looks
bored until she goes to bed with
Moore.

But the action sequences,
many actually filmed in a South
African gold mine, are super. If
you can ignore the mindless plot
and the specter of South Africa's
racial policies (which aren't
ignored in the film, but just made
the normal way of dealing with
blacks) and are big on mine
disasters, see Gold.
