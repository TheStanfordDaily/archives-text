# Cobham Puts On Super Show
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Billy Cobham's tremendous talents are no secret;
when he played with the old Mahavishnu Orchestra,
he set standards that will go unequalled for a long
time. So it's no wonder that Cobham's fans packed
the Great American Music hall to hear him Sunday
night, even forcing latecomer Carlos Santana to
stand.
Cobham's seven-man group has so many talented
soloists that they could begin to stretch out in the
short set they played Sunday, but the set would
have been remarkable for Cobham's masterfully
powerful solo work. Besides the drummer-leader
the band can boast such established stars as
trumpeter Randy Brecker, his saxaphonist brother
Michael and guitarist John all of
whom played on Cobham's recent best-seller
Crosswinds.
One of the best features of the band, however, is
the presence of two new musicians: trombonist
Glen Ferris and a fine young bass player whose
name, unfortunately, got lost in the din that
accompanied the whole performances.
Ferris played some fast rock-influenced passages
that matched any other younger trombonist's
work. His solo on "Snoopy's Search," a Cobham
tune from his first album, showed exceptional
power in a type of tune that few trombone players
could handle.
Randy Brecker displayed the most accomplished
solo style, using his variety of electronic devices to
good advantage. Probably the only trumpeter
besides Miles Davis who successfully incorporates
the wah-wah pedal into his playing. Breckej- also
displayed a polished soul-influenced style on softer
portions of a suite from Total Eclipse , the group's

new album due within the month.
The musicians in the band are more compelling
than Cobham's compositions, usually fairly simple
tunes which form takeoff points for the soloists.
The drummer's arrangements hardly challenge the
horn section, but Cobham made up for their lack of
complexity by leading many of the pieces at a
breakneck pace. "The Pleasant Pheasant," taken at
about double time from the recorded version, but it
still came out clearly, especially Mike Brecker's
excellent, if familiar, tenor solo.
The influence of John McLaughlin's music
showed clearly on some of Cobham's tunes, which
featured Abercrombie, one of the most important
electric guitarists around. His playing borrows
freely from McLaughlin's lightning runs, but as
Abercrombie showed.when he was recording with
Gato Barbieri, he is a fine accompanist capable of
playing many styles.
The group's seventh man is Bulgarian
keyboardist Milcho Leviev, an important member
of Don Ellis' old big band. His synthesizer and
clarinet playing add much tone color to the music,
but he sparkles most on electric piano. His fine solo
near the end of the set showed his ability with the
kind of complex but highly lyrical playing Keith
Jarret used to do before he abandoned electricity.
Cobham, of course, was the man everyone came
to see, and he did his usual amazing things with his
famous lucite kit and a kettle drum thrown in for
extra power. Even his banging on a cowbell was
extraordinary. Cobham's playing evoked an
awe-struck expression on the face of Michael
Walden, his successor with Mahavishnu who was
another standee. He must realize that he has a
tough act to follow the toughest in the world.

to see, and he did his usual amazing things with his
famous lucite kit and a kettle drum thrown in for
extra power. Even his banging on a cowbell was
extraordinary. Cobham's playing evoked an
awe-struck expression on the face of Michael
Walden, his successor with Mahavishnu who was
another standee. He must realize that he has a
tough act to follow the toughest in the world.
Billy Cobham's tremendous talents are no secret;
when he played with the old Mahavishnu Orchestra,
he set standards that will go unequalled for a long
time. So it's no wonder that Cobham's fans packed
the Great American Music hall to hear him Sunday
night, even forcing latecomer Carlos Santana to
stand.
Cobham's seven-man group has so many talented
soloists that they could begin to stretch out in the
short set they played Sunday, but the set would
have been remarkable for Cobham's masterfully
powerful solo work. Besides the drummer-leader
the band can boast such established stars as
trumpeter Randy Brecker, his saxaphonist brother
Michael and guitarist John all of
whom played on Cobham's recent best-seller
Crosswinds.
One of the best features of the band, however, is
the presence of two new musicians: trombonist
Glen Ferris and a fine young bass player whose
name, unfortunately, got lost in the din that
accompanied the whole performances.
Ferris played some fast rock-influenced passages
that matched any other younger trombonist's
work. His solo on "Snoopy's Search," a Cobham
tune from his first album, showed exceptional
power in a type of tune that few trombone players
could handle.
Randy Brecker displayed the most accomplished
solo style, using his variety of electronic devices to
good advantage. Probably the only trumpeter
besides Miles Davis who successfully incorporates
the wah-wah pedal into his playing. Breckej- also
displayed a polished soul-influenced style on softer
portions of a suite from Total Eclipse , the group's

new album due within the month.
The musicians in the band are more compelling
than Cobham's compositions, usually fairly simple
tunes which form takeoff points for the soloists.
The drummer's arrangements hardly challenge the
horn section, but Cobham made up for their lack of
complexity by leading many of the pieces at a
breakneck pace. "The Pleasant Pheasant," taken at
about double time from the recorded version, but it
still came out clearly, especially Mike Brecker's
excellent, if familiar, tenor solo.
The influence of John McLaughlin's music
showed clearly on some of Cobham's tunes, which
featured Abercrombie, one of the most important
electric guitarists around. His playing borrows
freely from McLaughlin's lightning runs, but as
Abercrombie showed.when he was recording with
Gato Barbieri, he is a fine accompanist capable of
playing many styles.
The group's seventh man is Bulgarian
keyboardist Milcho Leviev, an important member
of Don Ellis' old big band. His synthesizer and
clarinet playing add much tone color to the music,
but he sparkles most on electric piano. His fine solo
near the end of the set showed his ability with the
kind of complex but highly lyrical playing Keith
Jarret used to do before he abandoned electricity.
