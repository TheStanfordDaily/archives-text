# 'Pinafore' Well Performed, Almost Assured Of Success
## 
### STEVE HALL 
As soon as the curtain opened
to reveal the striking replica of a
British sailing vessel, the Stanford
Savoyards were again on course
for another remarkable Gilbert &
Sullivan production. Their
rendition of H.M.S. Pinafore
played to a near-capacity crowd
on their opening night Wednesday
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The men's chorus of sailors did
a shipshape job with "We Sail the
Ocean Blue." The horny young
sailors welcome the chorus of
"sisters, cousins and aunts" who
are led by Cousin Hebe, played
well by Bernice Otudeko. 1
The chorus is the essence of
any show of this kind, and in fact
this chorus is the best the
Savoyards have produced. There
was a full, rich sound, and you
could understand the words most
of the time. Choral Director
Christopher Lanz deserves praise
for his efforts.
The Pinafore is the classic
Victorian dilemma of the lowly
sailor who loves "a lass above his
station." Gerald Moshell played
the part of "topman" Ralph
Backstraw with great conviction
and, though not the most
powerful tenor, made the most of
his talents. His beloved, the
Captain's daughter Josephine, was
an impressive operatic soprano
(Patricia Hollahan) whose

dialogue lines lacked conviction.
Pompous Porter
Josephine has, however, been
betrothed to Sir Joseph Porter,
K.C.8., played with the requisite
pompousness by- Daniel Allan. His
trained eyebrows and moustache
add almost as much as his wig,
and his lace handerchief took
center stage throughout.
One can see how this foppish
gent must have "polished up the
handle on the big front door." (It
so happens that Queen Victoria
did knight an Admiral Smith as
"Ruler of the Queen's Navy."
Smith, who was the manager of a
bookseller's firm, was dubbed
"Pinafore Smith" by the public
after this play became popular.
Victoria was once again "not
amused" by Mr. Gilbert.)
Captain Corcoran, who "hardly
ever said the Big, Big D—," was
played splendidly by T. Peter
Martin. The audience's morale was
boosted whenever he appeared.
His true love is the "plump and
pleasing" Little Buttercup,
fetchingly played by Savoyards
favorite Ella Asbury. As usual, the
plump contralto brings about the
startling revelation that signals the
finale.
Minor Leads Add
The minor leads added a lot of
color to the production, especially
Scott Phillips and Ben Brink as
the Boatswain and the Carpenter.
Their rendition of "A British Tar"
was very good. Phillips' solo in
"He Is An Englishman" is
excellent.
Peter Vilkin played a dastardly
Dick Deadeye, who attempts to
thwart the star-crossed lovers. His
number with the Captain ("Kind
Captain I've Important
Information") was first-rate.
Young Jim Siena was typecast as
the "Midshipmite," jumping in
fright during the escape scene and
otherwise playing his role to the

fullest.
Director Lindi Bauman's
staging was perfect. In particular,
the chorus movements were
effective and well rehearsed. The
orchestra, conducted by musical
director Daniel Robinson, showed
moments of brilliance with the
original D'Oyly Carte score. The
rough edges should be smoothed
over by this weekend's
performances.
Technical Aspects
The technical aspects,
organized by John Hughes, were
excellent. Gary Crossman's set
was enormous and well
constructed. When you consider
the fact that the entire women's
chorus had to stand on top of it
and the fact that it has to be
taken down after each
performance the impossible was
accomplished.
Costume Designer Marian
Colwell again created dresses and
uniforms perfect to the last detail:
Sir Joseph's uniform was
magnificent. Steven Austin's lights
were effective, though one might
quibble with the brightness of the
escape scene where the chorus
was supposedly carrying lanterns.
Paul Edwards did a fine job of
makeup, particularly with Dick
Deadeye.
Diehard G&S fans will be
pleased to see an old favorite well
done. And those who have never
seen Gilbert & Sullivan should see
this Pinafore. The show itself,
with its story and favorite songs,
is the one people know best. And
the exuberance of the spirited
Savoyards will convert any
disbeliever.
The show runs through this
weekend at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium; next weekend there
is a Saturday matinee on at 2 p.m.
and a Sunday evening
performance at 8.

NOT FOR TV—This scene from Gold, with Susannah York and Roger Moore, is sure to'be cut before the
movie finds its way onto television. The movie deals with a South African mine disaster. Roger Moore
attempts to prevent the deliberate flooding of a gold mine in the movie, which is shot on location in South
Africa.

ever said the Big, Big D—," was
played splendidly by T. Peter
Martin. The audience's morale was
boosted whenever he appeared.
His true love is the "plump and
pleasing" Little Buttercup,
fetchingly played by Savoyards
favorite Ella Asbury. As usual, the
plump contralto brings about the
startling revelation that signals the
finale.
Minor Leads Add
The minor leads added a lot of
color to the production, especially
Scott Phillips and Ben Brink as
the Boatswain and the Carpenter.
Their rendition of "A British Tar"
was very good. Phillips' solo in
"He Is An Englishman" is
excellent.
Peter Vilkin played a dastardly
Dick Deadeye, who attempts to
thwart the star-crossed lovers. His
number with the Captain ("Kind
Captain I've Important
Information") was first-rate.
Young Jim Siena was typecast as
the "Midshipmite," jumping in
fright during the escape scene and
otherwise playing his role to the

fullest.
Director Lindi Bauman's
staging was perfect. In particular,
the chorus movements were
effective and well rehearsed. The
orchestra, conducted by musical
director Daniel Robinson, showed
moments of brilliance with the
original D'Oyly Carte score. The
rough edges should be smoothed
over by this weekend's
performances.
Technical Aspects
The technical aspects,
organized by John Hughes, were
excellent. Gary Crossman's set
was enormous and well
constructed. When you consider
the fact that the entire women's
chorus had to stand on top of it
and the fact that it has to be
taken down after each
performance the impossible was
accomplished.
Costume Designer Marian
Colwell again created dresses and
uniforms perfect to the last detail:
Sir Joseph's uniform was
magnificent. Steven Austin's lights
were effective, though one might
quibble with the brightness of the
escape scene where the chorus
was supposedly carrying lanterns.
Paul Edwards did a fine job of
makeup, particularly with Dick
Deadeye.
Diehard G&S fans will be
pleased to see an old favorite well
done. And those who have never
seen Gilbert & Sullivan should see
this Pinafore. The show itself,
with its story and favorite songs,
is the one people know best. And
the exuberance of the spirited
Savoyards will convert any
disbeliever.
The show runs through this
weekend at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium; next weekend there
is a Saturday matinee on at 2 p.m.
and a Sunday evening
performance at 8.

NOT FOR TV—This scene from Gold, with Susannah York and Roger Moore, is sure to'be cut before the
movie finds its way onto television. The movie deals with a South African mine disaster. Roger Moore
attempts to prevent the deliberate flooding of a gold mine in the movie, which is shot on location in South
Africa.
As soon as the curtain opened
to reveal the striking replica of a
British sailing vessel, the Stanford
Savoyards were again on course
for another remarkable Gilbert &
Sullivan production. Their
rendition of H.M.S. Pinafore
played to a near-capacity crowd
on their opening night Wednesday
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The men's chorus of sailors did
a shipshape job with "We Sail the
Ocean Blue." The horny young
sailors welcome the chorus of
"sisters, cousins and aunts" who
are led by Cousin Hebe, played
well by Bernice Otudeko. 1
The chorus is the essence of
any show of this kind, and in fact
this chorus is the best the
Savoyards have produced. There
was a full, rich sound, and you
could understand the words most
of the time. Choral Director
Christopher Lanz deserves praise
for his efforts.
The Pinafore is the classic
Victorian dilemma of the lowly
sailor who loves "a lass above his
station." Gerald Moshell played
the part of "topman" Ralph
Backstraw with great conviction
and, though not the most
powerful tenor, made the most of
his talents. His beloved, the
Captain's daughter Josephine, was
an impressive operatic soprano
(Patricia Hollahan) whose

dialogue lines lacked conviction.
Pompous Porter
Josephine has, however, been
betrothed to Sir Joseph Porter,
K.C.8., played with the requisite
pompousness by- Daniel Allan. His
trained eyebrows and moustache
add almost as much as his wig,
and his lace handerchief took
center stage throughout.
One can see how this foppish
gent must have "polished up the
handle on the big front door." (It
so happens that Queen Victoria
did knight an Admiral Smith as
"Ruler of the Queen's Navy."
Smith, who was the manager of a
bookseller's firm, was dubbed
"Pinafore Smith" by the public
after this play became popular.
Victoria was once again "not
amused" by Mr. Gilbert.)

Diehard G&S fans will be
pleased to see an old favorite well
done. And those who have never
seen Gilbert & Sullivan should see
this Pinafore. The show itself,
with its story and favorite songs,
is the one people know best. And
the exuberance of the spirited
Savoyards will convert any
disbeliever.
The show runs through this
weekend at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium; next weekend there
is a Saturday matinee on at 2 p.m.
and a Sunday evening
performance at 8.

NOT FOR TV—This scene from Gold, with Susannah York and Roger Moore, is sure to'be cut before the
movie finds its way onto television. The movie deals with a South African mine disaster. Roger Moore
attempts to prevent the deliberate flooding of a gold mine in the movie, which is shot on location in South
Africa.
As soon as the curtain opened
to reveal the striking replica of a
British sailing vessel, the Stanford
Savoyards were again on course
for another remarkable Gilbert &
Sullivan production. Their
rendition of H.M.S. Pinafore
played to a near-capacity crowd
on their opening night Wednesday
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The men's chorus of sailors did
a shipshape job with "We Sail the
Ocean Blue." The horny young
sailors welcome the chorus of
"sisters, cousins and aunts" who
are led by Cousin Hebe, played
well by Bernice Otudeko. 1
The chorus is the essence of
any show of this kind, and in fact
this chorus is the best the
Savoyards have produced. There
was a full, rich sound, and you
could understand the words most
of the time. Choral Director
Christopher Lanz deserves praise
for his efforts.
The Pinafore is the classic
Victorian dilemma of the lowly
sailor who loves "a lass above his
station." Gerald Moshell played
the part of "topman" Ralph
Backstraw with great conviction
and, though not the most
powerful tenor, made the most of
his talents. His beloved, the
Captain's daughter Josephine, was
an impressive operatic soprano
(Patricia Hollahan) whose

dialogue lines lacked conviction.
Pompous Porter
Josephine has, however, been
betrothed to Sir Joseph Porter,
K.C.8., played with the requisite
pompousness by- Daniel Allan. His
trained eyebrows and moustache
add almost as much as his wig,
and his lace handerchief took
center stage throughout.
One can see how this foppish
gent must have "polished up the
handle on the big front door." (It
so happens that Queen Victoria
did knight an Admiral Smith as
"Ruler of the Queen's Navy."
Smith, who was the manager of a
bookseller's firm, was dubbed
"Pinafore Smith" by the public
after this play became popular.
Victoria was once again "not
amused" by Mr. Gilbert.)
Captain Corcoran, who "hardly
ever said the Big, Big D—," was
played splendidly by T. Peter
Martin. The audience's morale was
boosted whenever he appeared.
His true love is the "plump and
pleasing" Little Buttercup,
fetchingly played by Savoyards
favorite Ella Asbury. As usual, the
plump contralto brings about the
startling revelation that signals the
finale.
Minor Leads Add
The minor leads added a lot of
color to the production, especially
Scott Phillips and Ben Brink as
the Boatswain and the Carpenter.
Their rendition of "A British Tar"
was very good. Phillips' solo in
"He Is An Englishman" is
excellent.
Peter Vilkin played a dastardly
Dick Deadeye, who attempts to
thwart the star-crossed lovers. His
number with the Captain ("Kind
Captain I've Important
Information") was first-rate.
Young Jim Siena was typecast as
the "Midshipmite," jumping in
fright during the escape scene and
otherwise playing his role to the

fullest.
Director Lindi Bauman's
staging was perfect. In particular,
the chorus movements were
effective and well rehearsed. The
orchestra, conducted by musical
director Daniel Robinson, showed
moments of brilliance with the
original D'Oyly Carte score. The
rough edges should be smoothed
over by this weekend's
performances.
Technical Aspects
The technical aspects,
organized by John Hughes, were
excellent. Gary Crossman's set
was enormous and well
constructed. When you consider
the fact that the entire women's
chorus had to stand on top of it
and the fact that it has to be
taken down after each
performance the impossible was
accomplished.
Costume Designer Marian
Colwell again created dresses and
uniforms perfect to the last detail:
Sir Joseph's uniform was
magnificent. Steven Austin's lights
were effective, though one might
quibble with the brightness of the
escape scene where the chorus
was supposedly carrying lanterns.
Paul Edwards did a fine job of
makeup, particularly with Dick
Deadeye.

pleased to see an old favorite well
done. And those who have never
seen Gilbert & Sullivan should see
this Pinafore. The show itself,
