# How Blue Can You Get?
## An Interview With Jazz Great Stanley Turrentine 
### Dan Forte 
CTI has of late been the label
for jazz. Only recently has its
dominance been threatened by
the Berkeley-based
Fantasy-Prestige-Milestone label.
After recording several fine
albums for CTI (Sugar, Salt Song,
Don't Mess With Mr. T), Stanley
Turrentine, now 40 and at an
all-time peak in popularity,
recently left the Creed Taylor
label, and has just recorded his
first Fantasy LP, Pieces of
Dreams.
In the following interview,
Turrentine talks about his 24-year
career as a tenor saxophonist, as
well as his reasons for jumping
labels.
WHAT CAUSED THE SWITCH
FROM CTI TO FANTASY?
CTI wanted too much control.
But, first of all, they didn't pay
me; that's the main thing. And, as
far as control, Creed Taylor would
always have to put his name,
'Produced by,' and basically we
were doing it ourselves anyhow,
because he didn't do anything but
sit in the studio and say Take 1,
Take 2, and put his name on it.
And that's more money, you
know. (It is interesting to note
that another of CTl's top artists,
Freddie Hubbard, has just jumped
to Columbia.)
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE

MUSIC PUT OUT BY CTI?
Oh, well, he had a product.
The package that he did put out
was fantastic, because you notice
no one had that sound like CTI.
I've got to give credit where it's
due.
WHAT'S YOUR NEW LP LIKE?
Gene Page is the arranger, and I
have strings and french horns and
stuff. I produced this one myself;
it was fun.
I was shooting for something
across the board, that could get all
kinds of airplay. Because music is
changing, to me. It's no longer a
jazz musician restricted to one
style; he plays anything now. And
I think it's good because that way
he can get more exposure to more
people.
I think this record is really
gonna get it, because it's got a lot
of things in it, and it's commercial
enough to do it. And I don't think
I prostituted myself or anything,
because I'm still playing the same
wayj I can't do it no other way.
WHEN WAS YOUR VERY
FIRST RECORDING SESSION?
Oh, that's a long time. The first
one ever, I made a record with
Ray Charles, back in '52,
something like that.
WAS THE LOWELL FULSON
BAND, WITH RAY CHARLES'
THE FIRST BAND YOU

PLAYED WITH PROFES
SIONALLY?
To travel, yes. I was 16 then;
Ray was about 21 or 22. He
fascinated me. Matter of fact, he
was really the band; the people
really came out to see him, not
Lowell that much although
Lowell did have a certain
following. Charles had more
charisma it seemed like.
They came through Pittsburg,
looking for a tenor saxophone
player. And me, I was young, and
I said, 'Yeah, I'll get a chance to
travel.' I don't have any regrets. I
love this business.
Everybody used to come
through Pittsburg. Illinois
Jacquet, Sonny Stitt, I saw
Charlie Parker quite a few times.
He changed the whole music
around; not only saxophonists,
but any instrument piano
players, trumpet "layers,
everyone.
WHEN DID YOU START
PLAYING SAXOPHONE?
I started when I was about 12.
Before that, I used to play piano
by ear when I was about seven,
and then I played cello in high
school for a year. But, I never
would practice, because my
father's horn would be sitting
around, and when I came home
from school, I'd take the cello and
stick it in the corner, and pick up
the saxophone.
My father would come in, sit
down, and teach me. He was
playing jazz back in the 30s with
bands like the Savoy Sultans. He
got an offer to go with Duke
Ellington and he refused because
he wanted to stay with the family.
I never had any formal
training; the rest was just like I
went on the road, and I'd run into
guys and ask questions. And
fortunately during that time, you
had a chance to play jam sessions,
which they don't do anymore. I
remember sessions that would
continue for maybe three days,
continuous playing. And I'm kind
of sad that that's no longer. If we
finished a job, we'd just go to
some after hours place and jam all
night. It's like on-the-job training.
Young musicians, they don't have
a chance, because the union
stopped all the jamming.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
MUSICIAN'S UNION?
What do they do? Not a thing
but collect dues. They're sure not
getting me any work. It's just a
ripoff. Like Gene Ammons (tenor
saxophonist) just passed away,
and he was kind of behind in his
dues or something, and there's
some kind of insurance that you
have. So, they're not gonna pay
his insurance policy. And he's
been in the union that long!
WHAT MUSICIANS HAVE
INFLUENCED YOUR
PLAYING?
Coleman Hawkins, very much
so. Illinois Jacquet, Don Byas,

Lucky Thompson, Lester Young.
Of course Charlie Parker.
I usually try to concentrate on
the sound, because I love the
sound of a tenor saxophone. My
father, I think, is greatly
responsible for my tone. That's
one thing he instilled in my mind
is the sound; and I still work on it,
on trying to improve the sound.
When I was younger, like my
lesson for the day would be one
note. My father would say, 'Stand
in the corner and play a note.'
And it took me a while to
understand a statement he made.
He'd say, 'Did you hear it?' I said,
'Of course I heard it. Yeah.' But,
there's so many ways you can hit

one note. There's away you
attack the note, the way you
breath, how much air you put
into the horn, the vibrato.
My sax style has never really
changed, only the surroundings
have. The way I played 15 years
ago is basically the same way.
I try to listen to as much
music, and all styles of music, as I
possibly can. I love Roberta
Flack, Donny Hathaway, Sly. It's
no longer like you can categorize
it, because all that stuff gets
mulled together, because it's all
basically music. And it's all
oriented from the jazz roots
which to me is the foundation of
it all blues and gospel.
I used to live next door to a

sanctified church. And they used
to put me to sleep every night; I'd
go to bed by that. Then playing
with Lowell Fulson and Ray
Charles, that influenced me,
because that's what Ray Charles
was about, really church oriented.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
ELECTRONICS?
I was offered a lot of money,
man, to endorse an electric sax.
And I refused simply because it
changes the sound of the
instrument; it's no longer a tenor
sax. I personally don't want to
play it. I like that natural sound
of the horn.
But, I dig the things Eddie
Harris is doing. There's room for
everything.
