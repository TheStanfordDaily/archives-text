# Swami Dan Hicks: Original Performer
## 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO First it was "Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks," a
group which Bill Graham called."the most original group in San
Francisco" back in 1968. After that aggregation evolved itself out and
split up, it was "Lonesome Dan Hicks" (the loner with the boner),
th\en "Dancin' Dan Hicks and his Ail-Night Duji Boys."
For Halloween night at the Great American Music Hall, Hicks
billed himself as "Swaimi Dan Hicks" and was backed by most of the
old Hot Licks.
The group's physical appearance, like their music, has never been
exactly conventional, but for this occasion they really outdid
themselves.
Hicks took the stage at 10:30 dressed from head to toe in pennants
("Disneyland," "Washington, D.C.," "Forth Worth," etc.). Tied
around one. leg was a Jerry-Mahoney-type dummy, and on the other
leg were two Tijuana-style marionettes.
For the entire set he wore a black ski mask (the kind with two
holes for your eyes), and a black wig.

Looking over the group,
dressed only slightly wierder than
usual, Hicks said, "I think we've
got a real fine looking group
here. . . I don't know about this
guy. But, we can't all be white
niggers, can we?"
After 15 minutes of insult
humor (par for the course with
Hicks), the Swami said, "Well, I
guess you all came to hear some
music, didn't you? Well tough
titty; you expect me to sing
through all this crap?"
The band did finally play some
of the Hot Licks standards,
though, beginning with "Evenin'
Breeze."
Reunited for the occasion
were: Jaime "Skippy Sanchez"
Leopold on bass, Mary Ann Price
on vocals, Johnny "Guitar"
Girton on lead, Bob Scott on
drums, Swami Dan on rhythm and
vocals, and "Symphony Sid"
Paige on violin and mandolin
(recently of Sly Stone's
ensemble).
Hicks seems to bring out the
worst in audiences, giving them a
chance to gfet their hostilities out
urged on by his insults. But, he is
never outdone.
The fine music put out by the
band (sort of an amalgamation of
'3os jazz and Country Swing with
a touch of rock) didn't seem to
calm the natives much, so Hicks'
acid comebacks continue between
songs.
Some of his more outstanding
adlibs were: "The guy that just
said 'Boogie' better have some
meat on his bones;" and "If you
can't stand it, just file out. The
way I see it, you paid to come in
here, and I'm getting paid to be
here, so you figure it out."
Remember, all these lines are
coming from a man in a black ski
mask wearing pennants!

split up, it was "Lonesome Dan Hicks" (the loner with the boner),
th\en "Dancin' Dan Hicks and his Ail-Night Duji Boys."
For Halloween night at the Great American Music Hall, Hicks
billed himself as "Swaimi Dan Hicks" and was backed by most of the
old Hot Licks.
The group's physical appearance, like their music, has never been
exactly conventional, but for this occasion they really outdid
themselves.
Hicks took the stage at 10:30 dressed from head to toe in pennants
("Disneyland," "Washington, D.C.," "Forth Worth," etc.). Tied
around one. leg was a Jerry-Mahoney-type dummy, and on the other
leg were two Tijuana-style marionettes.
For the entire set he wore a black ski mask (the kind with two
holes for your eyes), and a black wig.

Looking over the group,
dressed only slightly wierder than
usual, Hicks said, "I think we've
got a real fine looking group
here. . . I don't know about this
guy. But, we can't all be white
niggers, can we?"
After 15 minutes of insult
humor (par for the course with
Hicks), the Swami said, "Well, I
guess you all came to hear some
music, didn't you? Well tough
titty; you expect me to sing
through all this crap?"
The band did finally play some
of the Hot Licks standards,
though, beginning with "Evenin'
Breeze."
Reunited for the occasion
were: Jaime "Skippy Sanchez"
Leopold on bass, Mary Ann Price
on vocals, Johnny "Guitar"
Girton on lead, Bob Scott on
drums, Swami Dan on rhythm and
vocals, and "Symphony Sid"
Paige on violin and mandolin
(recently of Sly Stone's
ensemble).
Hicks seems to bring out the
worst in audiences, giving them a
chance to gfet their hostilities out
urged on by his insults. But, he is
never outdone.
The fine music put out by the
band (sort of an amalgamation of
'3os jazz and Country Swing with
a touch of rock) didn't seem to
calm the natives much, so Hicks'
acid comebacks continue between
songs.
Some of his more outstanding
adlibs were: "The guy that just
said 'Boogie' better have some
meat on his bones;" and "If you
can't stand it, just file out. The
way I see it, you paid to come in
here, and I'm getting paid to be
here, so you figure it out."
Remember, all these lines are
coming from a man in a black ski
mask wearing pennants!
SAN FRANCISCO First it was "Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks," a
group which Bill Graham called."the most original group in San
Francisco" back in 1968. After that aggregation evolved itself out and
split up, it was "Lonesome Dan Hicks" (the loner with the boner),
th\en "Dancin' Dan Hicks and his Ail-Night Duji Boys."
