## A.D.'s Running As Smooth As His Baby Blue Cadillac 
### CHRIS BAKER 
LOS ANGELES It was a
typical smoggy summer day, the
kind Los Angeles has become
infamous for, when the touring
Pacific Eight skywriters anxiously
waited outside USC's Herritage
Hall for the arrival of Anthony
Davis. Out of the smog came a
baby blue 1973 Cadillac. "Wonder
where A.D. is?" asked an
impatient scribe.
The gas-eating hog pulled to
the curb and out stepped Davis.
"A telephone pole would get the
worst of a collision with that
thing,"jokes a reporter, referring
to a wreck 23 months ago
involving a telephone pole and a
smaller Davis vehicle.
"Got a good deal on it from a
friend," joked Davis.
If thinjgs go as predicted, Davis
won't have to get many "good
deals" on cars after he completes
his USC career. Automobile
makers will probably be waiting
on Davis' door step with
promotional offers, much as they
waited on O.J. Simpson after he
accepted the Heisman Trophy.
Not Easy
But it hasn't been an easy
ascension for Davis, who grew up
in San Fernando, a heavily
populated chicano suburb of Los
Angeles.
"I've been around gang fights
and seen people get shot. But I
think I'm a better person, I can
see both sides of the coin. I think
it motivated me to go out and
make something of myself. I think
a few of us made it too," said
Davis, referring to his cohort,
world lightweight boxing
champion Bobby Chacon.
And make it he did. As a senior
at San Fernando High School, he
earned Co-Los Angeles City
Player-Of-The-Year honors in
football, rushing for 1568 yards
and scoring 29 touchdowns. He
was also City Player-Of-The-Year
in baseball.
This summer, head coach John
McKay said that USC definitely
has a recruiting advantage when it
comes to Los Angeles area
players. "A great many blacks . . .
have been Trojan fans all their
lives, they've gone to our games
and followed us all their life. For

them to go 1000 miles away,
where they aren'tknown,would be
hard."
Davis fit into this syndrome. "I
did always follow the Trojans and
I always wanted to go to USC
because they've had the great
backs," he said.
Once One Of Crowd
As a running back for the
undefeated 1971 Trojan frosh,
Davis gained 195 yards on 51
carries. But halfway through
USC's 1972 national
championship season, Davis was
just another Trojan runner.
The 1972 Men of Troy, who
never trailed in the second half of
any game, were having their
troubles on a slick rain-soaked
carpet in Eugene, Ore., against the
Ducks. The Trojans muffed six
balls in the first half, losing three
of them.
With the score knotted a 0-0 in
the third quarter, Davis burst
around left end for a 48-yard
touchdown. On his next carry,
Davis started around left end
again and then cut across the grain
to score a 53-yard touchdown.
His incredible six touchdown
performance against Notre Dame
later that season catapulted him
into the national spotlight. In the
last six games of the 1972 season
he rushed for 926 yards and
scored 15 touchdowns, earning
the Voit Memorial Trophy as the
outstanding West Coast player.
Not A.D.'s Year
But 1973 AD was not Anthony
Davis' year. He had his second
1000-yard season, rushing for
1112 yards and 15 touchdowns.
But as McKay said "He was
running for seven yards instead of
touchdowns." The 5-foot-9
tailback was also hampered by a
weight problem. "You can't stand
5-9 and weigh 200 pounds," said
McKay. "But some pro people
told him he should put on more
weight and it hurt his quickness."
And there may be another,
more hidden, reason for 1973
disappointments.
After USC's press day this
August, Davis told the reporter
that he had been bothered by
cracked ribs for much of last
season. Davis then told the
skywriters that he just bruised

them.
Yet he was in so much pain
that he had to wear fiberglass
padding to protect his ribs. When
he finally shed the padding, Davis
had a tremendous day, running
for five touchdowns against
California.
When asked why he concealed
Davis' injury from the public,
McKay said. "We're not a pro
team and we don't have to report
injuries."
This year, relatively free of
ailments, Davis has rushed for 845
yards, improving his career total
to 3148.
With performances like these,
Davis will probably be on many
Heisman Trophy ballots, which
were mailed out earlier this week.
This summer Davis was
unconcerned with the honor.
"The Heisman comes with
performance of the team. I ran
too hard last year. This year will
be different. I'm not
overconfident," says the man
McKay once described as "the
brashest person I ever met."

1000-yard season, rushing for
1112 yards and 15 touchdowns.
But as McKay said "He was
running for seven yards instead of
touchdowns." The 5-foot-9
tailback was also hampered by a
weight problem. "You can't stand
5-9 and weigh 200 pounds," said
McKay. "But some pro people
told him he should put on more
weight and it hurt his quickness."
And there may be another,
more hidden, reason for 1973
disappointments.
After USC's press day this
August, Davis told the reporter
that he had been bothered by
cracked ribs for much of last
season. Davis then told the
skywriters that he just bruised

them.
Yet he was in so much pain
that he had to wear fiberglass
padding to protect his ribs. When
he finally shed the padding, Davis
had a tremendous day, running
for five touchdowns against
California.
When asked why he concealed
Davis' injury from the public,
McKay said. "We're not a pro
team and we don't have to report
injuries."
This year, relatively free of
ailments, Davis has rushed for 845
yards, improving his career total
to 3148.
With performances like these,
Davis will probably be on many
Heisman Trophy ballots, which
were mailed out earlier this week.
This summer Davis was
unconcerned with the honor.
"The Heisman comes with
performance of the team. I ran
too hard last year. This year will
be different. I'm not
overconfident," says the man
McKay once described as "the
brashest person I ever met."

A.D.—Anthony Davis breaks loose for a big gain in last year's
USC-Stanford game. A.D. didn't have the best season of his career in
1973, but seems well on the way to All America status this season.
LOS ANGELES It was a
typical smoggy summer day, the
kind Los Angeles has become
infamous for, when the touring
Pacific Eight skywriters anxiously
waited outside USC's Herritage
Hall for the arrival of Anthony
Davis. Out of the smog came a
baby blue 1973 Cadillac. "Wonder
where A.D. is?" asked an
impatient scribe.
The gas-eating hog pulled to
the curb and out stepped Davis.
"A telephone pole would get the
worst of a collision with that
thing,"jokes a reporter, referring
to a wreck 23 months ago
involving a telephone pole and a
smaller Davis vehicle.
"Got a good deal on it from a
friend," joked Davis.
If thinjgs go as predicted, Davis
won't have to get many "good
deals" on cars after he completes
his USC career. Automobile
makers will probably be waiting
on Davis' door step with
promotional offers, much as they
waited on O.J. Simpson after he
accepted the Heisman Trophy.
Not Easy
But it hasn't been an easy
ascension for Davis, who grew up
in San Fernando, a heavily
populated chicano suburb of Los
Angeles.
"I've been around gang fights
and seen people get shot. But I
think I'm a better person, I can
see both sides of the coin. I think
it motivated me to go out and
make something of myself. I think
a few of us made it too," said
Davis, referring to his cohort,
world lightweight boxing
champion Bobby Chacon.
And make it he did. As a senior
at San Fernando High School, he
earned Co-Los Angeles City
Player-Of-The-Year honors in
football, rushing for 1568 yards
and scoring 29 touchdowns. He
was also City Player-Of-The-Year
in baseball.
This summer, head coach John
McKay said that USC definitely
has a recruiting advantage when it
comes to Los Angeles area
players. "A great many blacks . . .
have been Trojan fans all their
lives, they've gone to our games
and followed us all their life. For

them to go 1000 miles away,
where they aren'tknown,would be
hard."
Davis fit into this syndrome. "I
did always follow the Trojans and
I always wanted to go to USC
because they've had the great
backs," he said.
Once One Of Crowd
As a running back for the
undefeated 1971 Trojan frosh,
Davis gained 195 yards on 51
carries. But halfway through
USC's 1972 national
championship season, Davis was
just another Trojan runner.
The 1972 Men of Troy, who
never trailed in the second half of
any game, were having their
troubles on a slick rain-soaked
carpet in Eugene, Ore., against the
Ducks. The Trojans muffed six
balls in the first half, losing three
of them.
With the score knotted a 0-0 in
the third quarter, Davis burst
around left end for a 48-yard
touchdown. On his next carry,
Davis started around left end
again and then cut across the grain
to score a 53-yard touchdown.
His incredible six touchdown
performance against Notre Dame
later that season catapulted him
into the national spotlight. In the
last six games of the 1972 season
he rushed for 926 yards and
scored 15 touchdowns, earning
the Voit Memorial Trophy as the
outstanding West Coast player.

Davis' year. He had his second
1000-yard season, rushing for
1112 yards and 15 touchdowns.

and scoring 29 touchdowns. He
was also City Player-Of-The-Year
in baseball.
This summer, head coach John
McKay said that USC definitely
has a recruiting advantage when it
comes to Los Angeles area
players. "A great many blacks . . .
have been Trojan fans all their
lives, they've gone to our games
and followed us all their life. For

them to go 1000 miles away,
where they aren'tknown,would be
hard."
Davis fit into this syndrome. "I
did always follow the Trojans and
I always wanted to go to USC
because they've had the great
backs," he said.
Once One Of Crowd
As a running back for the
undefeated 1971 Trojan frosh,
Davis gained 195 yards on 51
carries. But halfway through
USC's 1972 national
championship season, Davis was
just another Trojan runner.
The 1972 Men of Troy, who
never trailed in the second half of
any game, were having their
troubles on a slick rain-soaked
carpet in Eugene, Ore., against the
Ducks. The Trojans muffed six
balls in the first half, losing three
of them.
With the score knotted a 0-0 in
the third quarter, Davis burst
around left end for a 48-yard
touchdown. On his next carry,
Davis started around left end
again and then cut across the grain
to score a 53-yard touchdown.
His incredible six touchdown
performance against Notre Dame
later that season catapulted him
into the national spotlight. In the
last six games of the 1972 season
he rushed for 926 yards and
scored 15 touchdowns, earning
the Voit Memorial Trophy as the
outstanding West Coast player.
Not A.D.'s Year
But 1973 AD was not Anthony
Davis' year. He had his second
1000-yard season, rushing for
1112 yards and 15 touchdowns.
But as McKay said "He was
running for seven yards instead of
touchdowns." The 5-foot-9
tailback was also hampered by a
weight problem. "You can't stand
5-9 and weigh 200 pounds," said
McKay. "But some pro people
told him he should put on more
weight and it hurt his quickness."
And there may be another,
more hidden, reason for 1973
disappointments.
After USC's press day this
August, Davis told the reporter
that he had been bothered by
cracked ribs for much of last
season. Davis then told the
skywriters that he just bruised

them.
Yet he was in so much pain
that he had to wear fiberglass
padding to protect his ribs. When
he finally shed the padding, Davis
had a tremendous day, running
for five touchdowns against
California.
When asked why he concealed
Davis' injury from the public,
McKay said. "We're not a pro
team and we don't have to report
injuries."
This year, relatively free of
ailments, Davis has rushed for 845
yards, improving his career total
to 3148.
With performances like these,
Davis will probably be on many
Heisman Trophy ballots, which
were mailed out earlier this week.
This summer Davis was
unconcerned with the honor.
"The Heisman comes with
performance of the team. I ran
too hard last year. This year will
be different. I'm not
overconfident," says the man
McKay once described as "the
brashest person I ever met."

A.D.—Anthony Davis breaks loose for a big gain in last year's
USC-Stanford game. A.D. didn't have the best season of his career in
1973, but seems well on the way to All America status this season.
LOS ANGELES It was a
typical smoggy summer day, the
kind Los Angeles has become
infamous for, when the touring
Pacific Eight skywriters anxiously
waited outside USC's Herritage
Hall for the arrival of Anthony
Davis. Out of the smog came a
baby blue 1973 Cadillac. "Wonder
where A.D. is?" asked an
impatient scribe.
The gas-eating hog pulled to
the curb and out stepped Davis.
"A telephone pole would get the
worst of a collision with that
thing,"jokes a reporter, referring
to a wreck 23 months ago
involving a telephone pole and a
smaller Davis vehicle.
"Got a good deal on it from a
friend," joked Davis.
If thinjgs go as predicted, Davis
won't have to get many "good
deals" on cars after he completes
his USC career. Automobile
makers will probably be waiting
on Davis' door step with
promotional offers, much as they
waited on O.J. Simpson after he
accepted the Heisman Trophy.
Not Easy
But it hasn't been an easy
ascension for Davis, who grew up
in San Fernando, a heavily
populated chicano suburb of Los
Angeles.
"I've been around gang fights
and seen people get shot. But I
think I'm a better person, I can
see both sides of the coin. I think
it motivated me to go out and
make something of myself. I think
a few of us made it too," said
Davis, referring to his cohort,
world lightweight boxing
champion Bobby Chacon.
And make it he did. As a senior
at San Fernando High School, he
earned Co-Los Angeles City
Player-Of-The-Year honors in
football, rushing for 1568 yards
and scoring 29 touchdowns. He
was also City Player-Of-The-Year
in baseball.
