# Female Profs Spark Debate
## Staff Reorganization Challenged 
### BOB LOWE 
Female professors sparked a hot
debate in the Faculty Senate
yesterday, challenging a proposed
reorganization of non-professorial
academic staff structure on the
grounds that it will confine University
researchers to "dead-end jobs."
Pharmacology Prof. Dora Goldstein
touched off the heated and confused
discussion by suggesting an
amendment to a provision of the
Report of the Committee on the
Professoriate at Stanford, which deals
with research sponsorship.
Goldstein said the report would
make it tougher for female research
associates to advance. "Women aren't
advancing," she said. "They feel

trapped in a dead-end job."
The Professoriate report is
essentially a plan for the
reorganization of the faculty and
academic staff. Most of its provisions
were enacted by the Senate last year,
but sections dealing with non-faculty
staff still require Senate action.
Principal Sponsorship
Basically, provisions in the report
prohibit research associates who aren't
professors from having principal
investigatorship (sponsorship) in
research at the University.
According to the report, exceptions
are permitted when approved by the
University administration.
The main intent of Goldstein's
amendment was to enable individual
departments to decide which
non-faculty researchers may be
principal investigators.
Goldstein said the provision giving
the Univeristy administration the
decision in principal investigatorship
was a desirable "loophole." She added
that she wanted to open the loophole
wider.
Tougher
The jump to professorship (and the
right to sponsor research) is harder
under the new organizational
framework than previously, Goldstein
said. She added that researchers will
have less opportunity to make a name
for themselves and receive professorial
appointments.
"They [researchers] are being
exploited," Goldstein said. Sometimes
they do all the work on their proposals
and someone else gets the credit, she
added. Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh,
chairman of the Committee on the
Professoriate, defended the provisions
in the report.
"It is not clear to me that the step
to the adjunct professoriate will be
more difficult [than similar
advancement under the old system],"
he said.
'Growth'
"There is no entrapment,"
Pittendrigh asserted. "There is
provision in the present structure for
growth."
Pittendrigh said "abuses" exist in

the present system of appointing
research associates because hiring and
wage wage setting is up to project
sponsors.
He indicated that he fears
decentralization of decision-making in
this case because of possible lack of
uniformity among variou;
departments.
The Senate discussed Goldstein's
amendment in an atmosphere of
confusion, as senators interpreted it in
different ways. No one seemed able to
completely fathom the practical
implications of the amendment.
The Senate finally narrowly
defeated a watered-down version of
Goldstein's original amendment in a
straw vote. The debated provision and
other provisions in the Professoriate
report pertaining to the academic staff
will be considered at the next Senate
meeting.

Pittendrigh said "abuses" exist in

the present system of appointing
research associates because hiring and
wage wage setting is up to project
sponsors.

The Senate discussed Goldstein's
amendment in an atmosphere of
confusion, as senators interpreted it in
different ways. No one seemed able to
completely fathom the practical
implications of the amendment.
The Senate finally narrowly
defeated a watered-down version of
Goldstein's original amendment in a
straw vote. The debated provision and
other provisions in the Professoriate
report pertaining to the academic staff
will be considered at the next Senate
meeting.
Female professors sparked a hot
debate in the Faculty Senate
yesterday, challenging a proposed
reorganization of non-professorial
academic staff structure on the
grounds that it will confine University
researchers to "dead-end jobs."
Pharmacology Prof. Dora Goldstein
touched off the heated and confused
discussion by suggesting an
amendment to a provision of the
Report of the Committee on the
Professoriate at Stanford, which deals
with research sponsorship.
Goldstein said the report would
make it tougher for female research
associates to advance. "Women aren't
advancing," she said. "They feel

trapped in a dead-end job."
The Professoriate report is
essentially a plan for the
reorganization of the faculty and
academic staff. Most of its provisions
were enacted by the Senate last year,
but sections dealing with non-faculty
staff still require Senate action.
Principal Sponsorship
Basically, provisions in the report
prohibit research associates who aren't
professors from having principal
investigatorship (sponsorship) in
research at the University.
According to the report, exceptions
are permitted when approved by the
University administration.
The main intent of Goldstein's
amendment was to enable individual
departments to decide which
non-faculty researchers may be
principal investigators.
Goldstein said the provision giving
the Univeristy administration the
decision in principal investigatorship
was a desirable "loophole." She added
that she wanted to open the loophole
wider.
Tougher
The jump to professorship (and the
right to sponsor research) is harder
under the new organizational
framework than previously, Goldstein
said. She added that researchers will
have less opportunity to make a name
for themselves and receive professorial
appointments.
"They [researchers] are being
exploited," Goldstein said. Sometimes
they do all the work on their proposals
and someone else gets the credit, she
added. Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh,
chairman of the Committee on the
Professoriate, defended the provisions
in the report.
"It is not clear to me that the step
to the adjunct professoriate will be
more difficult [than similar
advancement under the old system],"
he said.
'Growth'
"There is no entrapment,"
Pittendrigh asserted. "There is
provision in the present structure for
growth."
Pittendrigh said "abuses" exist in

the present system of appointing
research associates because hiring and
wage wage setting is up to project
sponsors.
