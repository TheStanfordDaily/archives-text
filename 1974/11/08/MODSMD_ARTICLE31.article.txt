# Most Fans Predict Cardinal Victory
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Rose Bowl fever is growing
around the Stanford campus this
week, and most Stanfordites are
confident enough to pick their
Cards over the mighty Troy Boys
in tomorrow's key Pac-8 tilt. Even
though the Cards are nine-point
underdogs this time, you can be
sure if the fans in the stands have
their way the Cards will win in a
close one.
Perhaps the most optimistic
Card fan was Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon, who predicted,
with tongue in cheek, "SC 27,
Stanford 2027." However, he said
seriously "Stanford 28, USC 24.1
base my prediction on optimism,"
Hargadon said, and "I don't think
SC is all that invincible."
Communication Prof. William
Rivers said, "Stanford is gonna

win. You can bet all your money
on it. I pick Stanford by two
points."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who thought he was facing
another fraternity question, said,
"We're going to win by three
points. I think we should have a
much better learning curve about
losing the game in the last few
minutes than SC."
Former quarterback Don
Bunce, the leader of the last
Stanford Rose Bowl team, said
"Stanford 24-21.1 think we'll win
on a field goal in the final three
seconds."
Political Science Prof. Robert
Horn was more reflective than
predictive and said, "I haven't the
slightest idea who'll win, but I
hope Stanford does."

ASSU Council of Presidents
head Mike Herman also sees a
Cardinal victory Saturday.
Herman said, "I think Stanford
will win on a field goal. They'll
want to get back at them for last
year."
Stanford students are feeling
about the same. Dave Mantooth,
once an undergrad here and now a
grad student in education, said, "I
pick the Cards by three, 16-13.
That's based on emotion." He
made the comment while

munching hungrily on a candy
bar.
Gina Anastasi, a junior, said
"There is no doubt who is going
to win—Stanford's going to. It's
going to be a low scoring game, I
think."
Not all are quite so optimistic,
however. Mike Bogyo, a
sophomore mathematics major,
said, "USC 59, Stanford 2.1 don't
think we're going to win. USC is
just better than us. But seriously,
I pick USC 34-21."

ANOTHER ROSE BOWL?—Don Bunce led Stanford to the 1972
Rose Bowl, and he thinks the Cardinals will make a return trip to
Pasadena this New Year's Day.
