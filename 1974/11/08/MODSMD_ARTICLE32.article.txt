# Poloists Also Must Beat
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The USC Trojans invade the
Farm tomorrow to duel the
Cardinals in a game which will
decide whether or not Stanford
will indeed attain its season-long
goal of a trip to Southern
California. These Cards, though,
could care less about Anthony
Davis, Pat Haden or Charles
Phillips, for this grudge match
is played in a pool, and the two
Pac-8 rivals will be playing water
polo rather than football.
Assuming the Cardinals get by
the UC-Davis Aggies this
afternoon at Davis, a win
tomorrow would virtually assure
them of an NCAA Championship
berth and a trip to the Belmont

Plaza in Long Beach.
The tournament, held the
weekend of November 22, sends
such teams as California, UCLA
(which upset Cal, the defending
champs, last week in Los Angeles)
and UC-Irvine up against each
other in quest of the coveted
crown.
Unfortunately for the Cards,
the Trojans will be no pushovers.
Although Stanford has already
beaten them twice this year, the
Trojans have proven their ability
to win the big ones, as
exemplified by their 11-10 win
over powerhouse UC-Irvine earlier
in the campaign.
One factor in this key contest
will be the pool. The DeGuerre

complex, which esily ranks as
one of the top acqutfc facilties in
the U.S., was built wth the stands
in front of the smalpool, which
was to be used nainly for
swimming. The lrge pool, 1
according to Athletic irector Joe
Ruetz, was intended 'nainly for
recreation," and fe;ures no
seating arrangements iher than
the lawn.
A problem has arisenhis year
over which pool the should
play in. As was made app-ent last
week in the 10-4 drubbir; of San
Jose State, the Cards o/iously
perform better in the laq pool,
its spaciousness enabling tem to
utilize their main assets:?peed
and stamina.
Coach Art Lambert ould
rather play there; he confidethat
he "can't wait to get a
big pool," should the two tans
by chance meet in the NCAA l
The trouble is, however, he
spectators. "We want to
accommodate the fans, 4
they are more comfortable in te
stands, and naturally a big turnct
helps the team," says Ruetz. GaÂ»
receipts enter the picture, tot,
although Ruetz agrees that "othe
than football and basketball, ni
team makes money."
Other alternatives exist. One is
to buy portable bleachers and set
them in front of the large pool.
This would be expensive,
however, and increase the burden
on an already overworked
maintenance crew.
Another scheme would involve
knocking out the wall' between
the small swimming and diving
pools, making it into "the best
water polo facility in the
country," according to Lambert.
Ruetz has asked Lambert to
investigate the expenses involved
for the project.
Ruetz has been impressed by
Lambert's performance thus far,
and expresses his willingness to let
his squad "play anywhere it can if
it means beating the Trojans."
