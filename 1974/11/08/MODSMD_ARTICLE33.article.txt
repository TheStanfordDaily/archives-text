# Pac-8 Predictions

### 
It's the biggest game of the
season for his fearful forecaster.
His reputation is on the line as
much as Jack Christiansen's, and
his job is as tenuous as Mike
Cordova's.
So he ran the combined
USC-Stanford records for the
last 50 years into the computer,
averaged the squares of the
weights of both team's lines, and
added in the records of the two
head coaches.
it came out USC 2000 -
Stanford 1.
So we junked the whole thing
and went with our hunch, which
you can read below.
The other big game this week
is the offensive circus between
California and Washington. If
past performance is any
indication (last year, Cat won
54-49), this game should tax the
capacity of the Seattle
scoreboard.

We honestly think Cat is a
better defensive football team.
So the Bears ought to stop the
Huskies on at least a few series,
while Washington may never
stop Cal at all.
This week's third
hard-to-predict game is Oregon
State at Washington State. The
Beavers look like a better team,
but since the game is in Pullman,
and since Jim Sweeney usually
wins games like this one, we'll go
with the Cougs.
Finally, UCLA hosts Oregon.
The Ducks are the league's worst
team, while the Bruins are in
awful physical condition. We
think UCLA will come back for
at least this one win.
Predictions
Stanford 20, USC 10
California 37, Washington 33
Washington State 16, Oregon
State 15
UCLA 21, Oregon 9
