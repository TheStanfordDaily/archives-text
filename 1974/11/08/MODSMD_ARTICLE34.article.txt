# Whitewater Racing
## It's A Different Kind Of Trip 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
An old trout fisherman in faded khakis pulls a
pipe out of his mouth and asks, "what the hell you
want to go down that river fo', boy?"
A young man in a crash helmet and a bright
yellow life-vest squeezes his legs into the cockpit of
a sleek black kayak and replies importantly, "It's a
race, mister," and pointing to a foaming, roaring
rapid adds, "a Whitewater race."
The young man splashes water on his face and
paddles off into the current. "Sheeyit," the old
man says, "you're crazy."
Last weekend at the Stanislaus River Races
more than 60 boaters competed for kayaking and
canoeing honors in the cool autumn weather of the
Sierra foothills.
Several national champion and world class
paddlers met at the Stanislaus Races, along with
hordes of less Iqnown, but equally enthusiastic Bay
Area (including Stanford) paddlers.
Of the world class paddlers, Josef Sedivich
(founder of Seda Products, a large manufacturer of
kayak and canoe equiptment) took top honors in
the slalom canoe events.
Of the local paddlers, Pom Darreaux of Stanford
placed third in the wildwater kayak event.
Boast At Olympic
Whitewater canoe and kayak racing, although
popular for a long time in eastern Europe, was first
seen by most people in this country during the
televised coverage of the 1972 Olympics.
As the host of those Olympic games, the West
Germans exercised Iheir privilege of introducing a
new event into the games by adding Whitewater
racing to the list.
With poured concrete boulders, they built an
artificial slalom course that could be drained
bone-dry in 10 minutes yet was-considered by the
competitors to be the toughest ever chosen for
international competition.
During the long television coverage of those

games, the producers of ABC sports received one
request above all others more Whitewater racing.
Since then, Whitewater boating, both touring
and racing, has gained popularity in the U.S.
Two Varieties
Whitewater racing is not unlike competitive
skiing in that it combines skill and stamina with a
touch of danger. There are basically two kinds of
Whitewater racing downriver and slalom.
A downriver, wildwater race is an all-out tilt in a
thin fiberglass boat down several miles generally
8 to 10 of "nontrivial" rapids.
A slalom race is a three-dimensional puzzle of
forward, reverse, and upstream gates hung over
holes, eddies and drops on a short section of
Whitewater, less than half a mile.
Usually a downriver race amounts to an
endurance grunt with a few interesting rapids to
cope with and a fair amount of flat water paddling.
A nine-mile race like the Stanislaus run is won in a
little over one hour.
Some Purists
Even though a large number of paddlers have
been attracted to racing in recent years, a larger
number have remained purists. These are the
touring paddlers.
Since no two rivers are alike and conditions (like
the water level) vary drastically with seasons,
paddlers can almost always find what they want.
Ah yes, America, a meaner river can always be
found.
Perhaps herein lies the biggest rush of the sport.
Running a rapid for the first time is where the
excitement is the biggest.
Running a new rapid, falling with hundreds of
tons of water roaring so loud that your mingled
shriek for momma and gag of hysteria are
swallowed by the din, must be right up there with
all the cheap thrills that our prechewed, predigested
society has to offer. Sex. LSD. Fast Cars. Monday
Night Football. Godhead. Evel.

bone-dry in 10 minutes yet was-considered by the
competitors to be the toughest ever chosen for
international competition.
During the long television coverage of those

games, the producers of ABC sports received one
request above all others more Whitewater racing.
Since then, Whitewater boating, both touring
and racing, has gained popularity in the U.S.
Two Varieties
Whitewater racing is not unlike competitive
skiing in that it combines skill and stamina with a
touch of danger. There are basically two kinds of
Whitewater racing downriver and slalom.
A downriver, wildwater race is an all-out tilt in a
thin fiberglass boat down several miles generally
8 to 10 of "nontrivial" rapids.
A slalom race is a three-dimensional puzzle of
forward, reverse, and upstream gates hung over
holes, eddies and drops on a short section of
Whitewater, less than half a mile.
Usually a downriver race amounts to an
endurance grunt with a few interesting rapids to
cope with and a fair amount of flat water paddling.
A nine-mile race like the Stanislaus run is won in a
little over one hour.
Some Purists
Even though a large number of paddlers have
been attracted to racing in recent years, a larger
number have remained purists. These are the
touring paddlers.
Since no two rivers are alike and conditions (like
the water level) vary drastically with seasons,
paddlers can almost always find what they want.
Ah yes, America, a meaner river can always be
found.
Perhaps herein lies the biggest rush of the sport.
Running a rapid for the first time is where the
excitement is the biggest.
Running a new rapid, falling with hundreds of
tons of water roaring so loud that your mingled
shriek for momma and gag of hysteria are
swallowed by the din, must be right up there with
all the cheap thrills that our prechewed, predigested
society has to offer. Sex. LSD. Fast Cars. Monday
Night Football. Godhead. Evel.

FAST-GROWING SPORT—Whitewater racing has become a popular
sport in the U.S. since the 1972 Olympics. Here, two contestants try
their luck over a course with ski-like gates in the distance.
An old trout fisherman in faded khakis pulls a
pipe out of his mouth and asks, "what the hell you
want to go down that river fo', boy?"
A young man in a crash helmet and a bright
yellow life-vest squeezes his legs into the cockpit of
a sleek black kayak and replies importantly, "It's a
race, mister," and pointing to a foaming, roaring
rapid adds, "a Whitewater race."
The young man splashes water on his face and
paddles off into the current. "Sheeyit," the old
man says, "you're crazy."
Last weekend at the Stanislaus River Races
more than 60 boaters competed for kayaking and
canoeing honors in the cool autumn weather of the
Sierra foothills.
Several national champion and world class
paddlers met at the Stanislaus Races, along with
hordes of less Iqnown, but equally enthusiastic Bay
Area (including Stanford) paddlers.
Of the world class paddlers, Josef Sedivich
(founder of Seda Products, a large manufacturer of
kayak and canoe equiptment) took top honors in
the slalom canoe events.
Of the local paddlers, Pom Darreaux of Stanford
placed third in the wildwater kayak event.
Boast At Olympic
Whitewater canoe and kayak racing, although
popular for a long time in eastern Europe, was first
seen by most people in this country during the
televised coverage of the 1972 Olympics.
As the host of those Olympic games, the West
Germans exercised Iheir privilege of introducing a
new event into the games by adding Whitewater
racing to the list.
With poured concrete boulders, they built an
artificial slalom course that could be drained
bone-dry in 10 minutes yet was-considered by the
competitors to be the toughest ever chosen for
international competition.
