Defending IM football
champion Zeta Psi, under the
leadership of Bear Bryantesque
head coach E. Y. Snowden, is
again the number one seed in the
"A" football playoffs, the
intramural office announced
today. Biz II A, last year's
runner-up (then Biz I A) is again
the second seed. Both teams are
undefeated this year.
The third seed is still under
consideration. Teams with a
chance at the third berth include
Phi Delt, KA, SAE and Theta
Delt, all with 5-1 marks. Also
under consideration is JRA, with
a 4-2 mark. Both of JRA's two
losses came at the hands of Biz 11.
The playoffs for both the A
and B divisions will begin
Monday. The B seedings are yet to
be announced. The Zetes are also
the defending B champions, with
the KA's last year's second place
team.
