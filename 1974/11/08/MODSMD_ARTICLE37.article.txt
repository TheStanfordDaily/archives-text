No Big Ice Chests
The Stanford Athletic
Department has decided to ban
large ice chests from the Stadium
Saturday, because several people
were injured after tripping over
the big containers last week.
You can bring your
booze ... er, uh, milk and
cookies, into the Stadium in any
container not over roughly a foot
square.
Judo Coach Elevated
Stanford judo coach Tamo
Kitaura has been selected by the
United States Olympic Committee
to become a member of the U.S.
International Judo coaching staff.
The staff is responsible for
coaching the U.S. Judo Team in
the Pan American, World
Championship and Olympic
games.
Kitaura, 46, was selected
because of his 10 years of
tournament experience and 21
years of teaching judo, 11 of
which have been at Stanford. He
is a fifth-degree black belt, and

plans to teach here "as long as as I
am needed."
