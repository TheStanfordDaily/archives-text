# Same Sad Story For Card Booters
## 
### DAN PYNE 
The Stanford soccer team
sloshed through mud and slid over
rocks and found it possible to lose
yet another game by a penalty
kick.
The booters ruined a two-game
winning streak Wednesday
afternoon, as they were edged by
a tough Cal-State Hayward 2-1.
"We gave the ball away 24
times," head coach Fred Priddle
lamented. "And giving it away
means we passed .. . directly to
our opponents. That shows both
bad passing and poor positioning
by the receiving player. It's pretty
hard to win when you turn the
ball over to the other team 24
times."
Hayward scored first, after 10
minutes had elapsed in the first
half. But Stanford managed to tie
the game up midway through the
period when fullback Mac Taylor
came forward from his fullback
position to score, unassisted, from
about 10 yards in front of the
Hayward goal.
The field, muddy from early
afternoon rains, made play a little
difficult. "There were places on
the field where you sank up to
your ankles," Priddle said. "It was
a real quagmire out there in spots.
But they [Hayward] had to
contend with it too."
The Cardinals had a chance to
go ahead early in the second half
when they were awarded a direct
free penalty kick. Taylor took it,
but did not make it. "Their goalie
made an excellent save," Priddle

explained.
And of course, midway
through the period, Hayward was
awarded a direct free shot from a
pushing penalty 7 (what else?)
called on Marty Glickfeld. The
kick was good and that proved to
be a difference in the match.
"The ref farthest from the play
called the penalty," Priddle said,
"and then, after the upfield
referee had placed the ball for a
direct kick outside the penalty
area, the other ref ran all the way
up the field to put it in the
penalty box ..."
Stanford put on the pressure
late in the game. "We were really
hammering at their goal," Priddle
remarked. "We were bouncing
them off the posts, and off the
goalie, but couldn't put the ball
in."
The Cardinals, who were
missing Charlie Hall due to an
illness and Johnny Murao, who
was taking an exam, did not lose
anyone through injuries, but got a
little roughed up.
Taylor "lost some hide," as
Priddle put it, sliding across the
penalty area to save a goal, and a
Hayward player was thrown out
' of the game after "backing the
dickens out of Phil Wright."
Stanford took 25 shots on
" goal, most of them, according to
Priddle, by midfielders Robby
Robb, Glickfeld and Mark
Judson.
The booters play University of
Pacific tomorrow afternoon at 3
p.m.
