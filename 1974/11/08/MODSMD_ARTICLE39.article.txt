Nixon May Testify On Videotape
WASHINGTON Richard M. Nixon's lawyer
informed U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
yesterday that it will be two or three months before
the former president could testify at the Watergate
cover-up trial without endangering his health.
In an affidavit submitted to Sirica, Herbert J.
Miller Jr., Nixon's lawyer, said that opinion was
given to him Tuesday by Dr. John C. Lungren, who
has been treating Nixon for phlebitis. Sirica said
Nixon's testimony may have to be taken on
videotape in California.
Meanwhile in Long Beach, Calif., Nixon was
overcoming the pneumonia in his partially collapsed
right lung and his general condition continued to
improve, his doctor said yesterday.
The pneumonitis, apparently responsible for
partial but nonserious collapse of the lung, was
"responding well to antibiotic therapy and
resolving," Lungren said in his written daily report
on Nixon.
Inflation Hurts Budget Hopes
WASHINGTON Inflation and economic
decline are playing havoc with the administration's
budget hopes for 1975 and 1976, and some officials
say a balanced budget in 1976 probably is now
beyond reach.
Unless there are cuts in 1975 spending, the
government faces a 1975 budget deficit of at least
$l3 billion, instead of the $11.5 billion deficit
projected in May, an administration source said.
The Ford and Nixon administrations have
considered a reduced budget deficit in fiscal 1975
and a balanced budget in 1976 a major part of their
anti-inflation program.
* The last time the federal budget wasn't in deficit
was in 1969, when it showed a surplus of $3.2

billion. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon and
others have said the continuing federal deficits are a
major cause of the nation's inflation.
Inflation also has made the goal of balanced
budgets more elusive, by forcing government costs
upward. Meanwhile, the current economic
slowdown is threatening to slow down the growth
of federal tax revenues.
Progress Made In Coal Talks
WASHINGTON Coal industry and union
negotiators narrowed their differences on some
economic issues yesterday as they worked on a new
contract for 120,000 miners preparing to strike.
President Arnold Miller of the United Mine
Workers said that while they were making progress,
a strike "is a foregone conclusion."
Miller declined to speculate how long a walkout
might last, but other union officials suggested that
progress in the talks so far and the 10-day
ratification procedure could mean a strike of up to
two weeks.
During a break in the daylong negotiations,
Miller agreed with an assessment by Guy Farmer,
the industry's chief negotiator, that a tentative
contract settlement is possible this weekend.
Farmer said four or five "really tough issues"
remained and added that "we should be able to
make an agreement" by Sunday.
The union's contract expires at midnight Monday
but some miners are expected to quit work at the
end of the today's last shift.
The administration is concerned aboqt the
economic consequences of a lengthy strike on the
nation's already sagging economy and six percent
unemployment rate.
Government economists predict a month-long
walkout could force the layoffs of up to 400,000
workers in major industries, including steel and
autos.
Kissinger Turkey Trip Cancelled
Henry Kissinger's planned visit to Turkey was
called off yesterday when the Turkish government
split over a stance on Cyprus. But the Secretary of
State's Middle East diplomacy whirled on with visits
to Syria and Israel.
Turkey's caretaker premier, Bulent Ecevit, said
he was postponing Kissinger's visit today because of
a clash with his coalition partner, the orthodox
Moslem National Salvation party.
He said he was "legally unable" to negotiate with
Kissinger because the Salvationists withheld their
support from "certain goodwill gestures we were
prepared to make to facilitate a peaceful solution to
the Cyprus problem." He declined to name the
gestures.
As Ecevit spoke, 2000 students demonstrated in
Ankara with signs reading "Kissinger murderer."
A senior U.S. official said Syrian President Hafez
Assad had eased his resistance to negotiations
between Israel and Egypt during more than three
hours of talks with Kissinger in Damascus, but

apparently did not flash a clear green light for the
negotiations to begin.
Kissinger then flew from Damascus to Jerusalem
where he assured Israel "there is no change in
American policy on any of the issues" involved in
his quest for Middle East peace.
Just before Kissinger's arrival, the Israeli
government expressed concern over President Ford's
call for movement between Israel and Jordan or the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Israel
refuses to deal with the PLO.
FTC Plans Advertiser Standards
WASHINGTON - The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) proposed yesterday a set of
standards for advertisers who say their food is
healthful and nutritious.
But the commission sidestepped, at least
temporarily, the issue of whether to require some
nutritional information from all food advertisers.
Under the proposal, for example, a soup
advertised as "wholesome" or "nutritious" would
have to contain protein and at least three other
essential vitamins and minerals at levels of at least
10 percent of recommended adult requirements.
The exact content of the elements would have to be
spelled out in the ads.
However, a candy-bar maker could call his
product "good" or "great" without providing any
sort of information on its contribution or lack of
one to a balanced diet.
"People need nutritious food to live healthy
lives, and they know it. They can be easily misled
by nutritional claims with serious consequences,"
said J. Thomas Rosch, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection.
"Taken in their entirety, the rules should ensure
that food advertising is both scrupulously and
adequately informative."
Sugar Rationing Spreads
LOS ANGELES Sugar rationing spread across
sections of Southern California and the San
Francisco area yesterday as some major supermarket
chains sought to curtail panic buying.
At least five large chains imposed some type of
rationing to limit purchases to five or 10 pounds at
a time.
Rising prices and news reports about the soaring
costs caused many customers to buy as much as 80
to 100 pounds of sugar at a time. Retail post of a
five-pound bag ranged from $2.17 to $2.50, and one
store spokesman warned "it could go up tci $3 by
tonight."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today and tomorrow. A little warmer
tomorrow. Lows in the 40s. Highs today in 60s and
tomorrow 60s to low 70s. Winds becoming mostly
northwesterly 10 to 20 mph.

LOS ANGELES Sugar rationing spread across
sections of Southern California and the San
Francisco area yesterday as some major supermarket
chains sought to curtail panic buying.
At least five large chains imposed some type of
rationing to limit purchases to five or 10 pounds at
a time.
Rising prices and news reports about the soaring
costs caused many customers to buy as much as 80
to 100 pounds of sugar at a time. Retail post of a
five-pound bag ranged from $2.17 to $2.50, and one
store spokesman warned "it could go up tci $3 by
tonight."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today and tomorrow. A little warmer
tomorrow. Lows in the 40s. Highs today in 60s and
tomorrow 60s to low 70s. Winds becoming mostly
northwesterly 10 to 20 mph.
Nixon May Testify On Videotape
WASHINGTON Richard M. Nixon's lawyer
informed U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
yesterday that it will be two or three months before
the former president could testify at the Watergate
cover-up trial without endangering his health.
In an affidavit submitted to Sirica, Herbert J.
Miller Jr., Nixon's lawyer, said that opinion was
given to him Tuesday by Dr. John C. Lungren, who
has been treating Nixon for phlebitis. Sirica said
Nixon's testimony may have to be taken on
videotape in California.
Meanwhile in Long Beach, Calif., Nixon was
overcoming the pneumonia in his partially collapsed
right lung and his general condition continued to
improve, his doctor said yesterday.
The pneumonitis, apparently responsible for
partial but nonserious collapse of the lung, was
"responding well to antibiotic therapy and
resolving," Lungren said in his written daily report
on Nixon.
Inflation Hurts Budget Hopes
WASHINGTON Inflation and economic
decline are playing havoc with the administration's
budget hopes for 1975 and 1976, and some officials
say a balanced budget in 1976 probably is now
beyond reach.
Unless there are cuts in 1975 spending, the
government faces a 1975 budget deficit of at least
$l3 billion, instead of the $11.5 billion deficit
projected in May, an administration source said.
The Ford and Nixon administrations have
considered a reduced budget deficit in fiscal 1975
and a balanced budget in 1976 a major part of their
anti-inflation program.
* The last time the federal budget wasn't in deficit
was in 1969, when it showed a surplus of $3.2

billion. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon and
others have said the continuing federal deficits are a
major cause of the nation's inflation.
Inflation also has made the goal of balanced
budgets more elusive, by forcing government costs
upward. Meanwhile, the current economic
slowdown is threatening to slow down the growth
of federal tax revenues.
Progress Made In Coal Talks
WASHINGTON Coal industry and union
negotiators narrowed their differences on some
economic issues yesterday as they worked on a new
contract for 120,000 miners preparing to strike.
President Arnold Miller of the United Mine
Workers said that while they were making progress,
a strike "is a foregone conclusion."
Miller declined to speculate how long a walkout
might last, but other union officials suggested that
progress in the talks so far and the 10-day
ratification procedure could mean a strike of up to
two weeks.
During a break in the daylong negotiations,
Miller agreed with an assessment by Guy Farmer,
the industry's chief negotiator, that a tentative
contract settlement is possible this weekend.
Farmer said four or five "really tough issues"
remained and added that "we should be able to
make an agreement" by Sunday.
The union's contract expires at midnight Monday
but some miners are expected to quit work at the
end of the today's last shift.
The administration is concerned aboqt the
economic consequences of a lengthy strike on the
nation's already sagging economy and six percent
unemployment rate.
Government economists predict a month-long
walkout could force the layoffs of up to 400,000
workers in major industries, including steel and
autos.
Kissinger Turkey Trip Cancelled
Henry Kissinger's planned visit to Turkey was
called off yesterday when the Turkish government
split over a stance on Cyprus. But the Secretary of
State's Middle East diplomacy whirled on with visits
to Syria and Israel.
Turkey's caretaker premier, Bulent Ecevit, said
he was postponing Kissinger's visit today because of
a clash with his coalition partner, the orthodox
Moslem National Salvation party.
He said he was "legally unable" to negotiate with
Kissinger because the Salvationists withheld their
support from "certain goodwill gestures we were
prepared to make to facilitate a peaceful solution to
the Cyprus problem." He declined to name the
gestures.
As Ecevit spoke, 2000 students demonstrated in
Ankara with signs reading "Kissinger murderer."
A senior U.S. official said Syrian President Hafez
Assad had eased his resistance to negotiations
between Israel and Egypt during more than three
hours of talks with Kissinger in Damascus, but

apparently did not flash a clear green light for the
negotiations to begin.
Kissinger then flew from Damascus to Jerusalem
where he assured Israel "there is no change in
American policy on any of the issues" involved in
his quest for Middle East peace.
Just before Kissinger's arrival, the Israeli
government expressed concern over President Ford's
call for movement between Israel and Jordan or the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Israel
refuses to deal with the PLO.
FTC Plans Advertiser Standards
WASHINGTON - The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) proposed yesterday a set of
standards for advertisers who say their food is
healthful and nutritious.
But the commission sidestepped, at least
temporarily, the issue of whether to require some
nutritional information from all food advertisers.
Under the proposal, for example, a soup
advertised as "wholesome" or "nutritious" would
have to contain protein and at least three other
essential vitamins and minerals at levels of at least
10 percent of recommended adult requirements.
The exact content of the elements would have to be
spelled out in the ads.
However, a candy-bar maker could call his
product "good" or "great" without providing any
sort of information on its contribution or lack of
one to a balanced diet.
"People need nutritious food to live healthy
lives, and they know it. They can be easily misled
by nutritional claims with serious consequences,"
said J. Thomas Rosch, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection.
"Taken in their entirety, the rules should ensure
that food advertising is both scrupulously and
adequately informative."

nutritional information from all food advertisers.
Under the proposal, for example, a soup
advertised as "wholesome" or "nutritious" would
have to contain protein and at least three other
essential vitamins and minerals at levels of at least
10 percent of recommended adult requirements.
The exact content of the elements would have to be
spelled out in the ads.
However, a candy-bar maker could call his
product "good" or "great" without providing any
sort of information on its contribution or lack of
one to a balanced diet.
"People need nutritious food to live healthy
lives, and they know it. They can be easily misled
by nutritional claims with serious consequences,"
said J. Thomas Rosch, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection.
"Taken in their entirety, the rules should ensure
that food advertising is both scrupulously and
adequately informative."
Sugar Rationing Spreads
LOS ANGELES Sugar rationing spread across
sections of Southern California and the San
Francisco area yesterday as some major supermarket
chains sought to curtail panic buying.
At least five large chains imposed some type of
rationing to limit purchases to five or 10 pounds at
a time.
Rising prices and news reports about the soaring
costs caused many customers to buy as much as 80
to 100 pounds of sugar at a time. Retail post of a
five-pound bag ranged from $2.17 to $2.50, and one
store spokesman warned "it could go up tci $3 by
tonight."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today and tomorrow. A little warmer
tomorrow. Lows in the 40s. Highs today in 60s and
tomorrow 60s to low 70s. Winds becoming mostly
northwesterly 10 to 20 mph.
Nixon May Testify On Videotape
WASHINGTON Richard M. Nixon's lawyer
informed U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
yesterday that it will be two or three months before
the former president could testify at the Watergate
cover-up trial without endangering his health.
In an affidavit submitted to Sirica, Herbert J.
Miller Jr., Nixon's lawyer, said that opinion was
given to him Tuesday by Dr. John C. Lungren, who
has been treating Nixon for phlebitis. Sirica said
Nixon's testimony may have to be taken on
videotape in California.
Meanwhile in Long Beach, Calif., Nixon was
overcoming the pneumonia in his partially collapsed
right lung and his general condition continued to
improve, his doctor said yesterday.
The pneumonitis, apparently responsible for
partial but nonserious collapse of the lung, was
"responding well to antibiotic therapy and
resolving," Lungren said in his written daily report
on Nixon.
Inflation Hurts Budget Hopes
WASHINGTON Inflation and economic
decline are playing havoc with the administration's
budget hopes for 1975 and 1976, and some officials
say a balanced budget in 1976 probably is now
beyond reach.
Unless there are cuts in 1975 spending, the
government faces a 1975 budget deficit of at least
$l3 billion, instead of the $11.5 billion deficit
projected in May, an administration source said.
The Ford and Nixon administrations have
considered a reduced budget deficit in fiscal 1975
and a balanced budget in 1976 a major part of their
anti-inflation program.
* The last time the federal budget wasn't in deficit
was in 1969, when it showed a surplus of $3.2

billion. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon and
others have said the continuing federal deficits are a
major cause of the nation's inflation.
Inflation also has made the goal of balanced
budgets more elusive, by forcing government costs
upward. Meanwhile, the current economic
slowdown is threatening to slow down the growth
of federal tax revenues.
Progress Made In Coal Talks
WASHINGTON Coal industry and union
negotiators narrowed their differences on some
economic issues yesterday as they worked on a new
contract for 120,000 miners preparing to strike.
President Arnold Miller of the United Mine
Workers said that while they were making progress,
a strike "is a foregone conclusion."
Miller declined to speculate how long a walkout
might last, but other union officials suggested that
progress in the talks so far and the 10-day
ratification procedure could mean a strike of up to
two weeks.
During a break in the daylong negotiations,
Miller agreed with an assessment by Guy Farmer,
the industry's chief negotiator, that a tentative
contract settlement is possible this weekend.
Farmer said four or five "really tough issues"
remained and added that "we should be able to
make an agreement" by Sunday.
The union's contract expires at midnight Monday
but some miners are expected to quit work at the
end of the today's last shift.
The administration is concerned aboqt the
economic consequences of a lengthy strike on the
nation's already sagging economy and six percent
unemployment rate.
Government economists predict a month-long
walkout could force the layoffs of up to 400,000
workers in major industries, including steel and
autos.
Kissinger Turkey Trip Cancelled
Henry Kissinger's planned visit to Turkey was
called off yesterday when the Turkish government
split over a stance on Cyprus. But the Secretary of
State's Middle East diplomacy whirled on with visits
to Syria and Israel.
Turkey's caretaker premier, Bulent Ecevit, said
he was postponing Kissinger's visit today because of
a clash with his coalition partner, the orthodox
Moslem National Salvation party.
He said he was "legally unable" to negotiate with
Kissinger because the Salvationists withheld their
support from "certain goodwill gestures we were
prepared to make to facilitate a peaceful solution to
the Cyprus problem." He declined to name the
gestures.
As Ecevit spoke, 2000 students demonstrated in
Ankara with signs reading "Kissinger murderer."
A senior U.S. official said Syrian President Hafez
Assad had eased his resistance to negotiations
between Israel and Egypt during more than three
hours of talks with Kissinger in Damascus, but

apparently did not flash a clear green light for the
negotiations to begin.
Kissinger then flew from Damascus to Jerusalem
where he assured Israel "there is no change in
American policy on any of the issues" involved in
his quest for Middle East peace.
Just before Kissinger's arrival, the Israeli
government expressed concern over President Ford's
call for movement between Israel and Jordan or the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Israel
refuses to deal with the PLO.

Ankara with signs reading "Kissinger murderer."
A senior U.S. official said Syrian President Hafez
Assad had eased his resistance to negotiations
between Israel and Egypt during more than three
hours of talks with Kissinger in Damascus, but

apparently did not flash a clear green light for the
negotiations to begin.
Kissinger then flew from Damascus to Jerusalem
where he assured Israel "there is no change in
American policy on any of the issues" involved in
his quest for Middle East peace.
Just before Kissinger's arrival, the Israeli
government expressed concern over President Ford's
call for movement between Israel and Jordan or the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Israel
refuses to deal with the PLO.
FTC Plans Advertiser Standards
WASHINGTON - The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) proposed yesterday a set of
standards for advertisers who say their food is
healthful and nutritious.
But the commission sidestepped, at least
temporarily, the issue of whether to require some
nutritional information from all food advertisers.
Under the proposal, for example, a soup
advertised as "wholesome" or "nutritious" would
have to contain protein and at least three other
essential vitamins and minerals at levels of at least
10 percent of recommended adult requirements.
The exact content of the elements would have to be
spelled out in the ads.
However, a candy-bar maker could call his
product "good" or "great" without providing any
sort of information on its contribution or lack of
one to a balanced diet.
"People need nutritious food to live healthy
lives, and they know it. They can be easily misled
by nutritional claims with serious consequences,"
said J. Thomas Rosch, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection.
"Taken in their entirety, the rules should ensure
that food advertising is both scrupulously and
adequately informative."
Sugar Rationing Spreads
LOS ANGELES Sugar rationing spread across
sections of Southern California and the San
Francisco area yesterday as some major supermarket
chains sought to curtail panic buying.
At least five large chains imposed some type of
rationing to limit purchases to five or 10 pounds at
a time.
Rising prices and news reports about the soaring
costs caused many customers to buy as much as 80
to 100 pounds of sugar at a time. Retail post of a
five-pound bag ranged from $2.17 to $2.50, and one
store spokesman warned "it could go up tci $3 by
tonight."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today and tomorrow. A little warmer
tomorrow. Lows in the 40s. Highs today in 60s and
tomorrow 60s to low 70s. Winds becoming mostly
northwesterly 10 to 20 mph.
