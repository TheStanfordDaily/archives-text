# Order Against UFW 'Unconstitutional'
## Law Prof Criticizes Injunction 
### DAN PYNE 
A recent Superior Court order .enjoining the United
Farm Workers (UFW) from commencing new litigation or
continuing present litigation against the Teamsters Union
"bludgeons to death any sort of attempt the workers may
make... to protest unredressed grievances," Law Prof.
William Gould said last night.
Gould explained that the injunction essentially prevents
the farm workers from bringing suits "alleging conspiracy
between Teamsters and growers."
Gould, with Law Profs. Anthony Amsterdam and
Barbara Babcock, issued a statement earlier this week
saying that the injunction is "unconstitutional and
unparalleled in its sweeping nature.. . .
"It comes as no surprise that this order, imposed upon a
labor organization which has struggled to improve the
working conditions of farm workers, has been obtained by
the corrupt and racist International Brotherhood of
Teamsters."
The order, issued by a Riverside County judge in favor
of the Teamsters last week, also prevents the UFW from
"causing the press to publish the contents of complaint(s)."
Gould said he thought the UFW suit alleging conspiracy
between the Teamsters and the growers had some basis in
fact. "The Supreme Court of California has already found
less than an arm's length of distance between the Teamsters
and the growers," he explained.
"The Teamsters and the growers are entering into
deals .. . without regard to whether the Teamsters are
representing a majority of the people," he charged.

"From what I understand, the attorneys representing the
UFW are carrying forward despite the court order," Gould
said. He added he thought the Court's ruling would be
reversed.
Gould also said he was personally concerned with this
injunction because it has some bearing on a court gag order
placed upon him last February.
In that case, still under litigation, Gould had been
seeking a preliminary injunction against local Teamster
unions and the Pacific Intermountain Express company in
part of a $5O million suit alleging discriminatory practices
by major trucking companies and the Teamsters.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert H. Schnacke forbade
Gould "directly or indirectly, orally or in writing, to
communicate" with anyone "not a formal party to the
action."
In their statement, Gould, Amsterdam and Babcock said
"Like the gag order. .. this latest example of judicial
excess violates the First Amendment right to associate and
to protest employment conditions [through] the courts. It
removes the fundamental right to proceed through the
courts from those who need it most."
Gould said he believes "that people have a right to band
together into organizations" to protect themselves,
"particularly when they face racial discrimination" or
union-management collusion.,
Represented by Amsterdam, Gould has appealed the gag
order to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial
District, where he says the legal process could be "a lengthy
one.
