# Soviet Woman's Dilemma: Motherhood Vs. The Job
## 
### LONNIE ROSENWALD SUSAN LUTTNER 
Although sexual equality has been
part of Soviet doctrine for more than
50 years, women still face the same
dilemma of working women in any
industrial nation, History Prof.
Dorothy Atkinson said yesterday in a
speech sponsored by the Center for
Research on Women (CROW).
Soviet women, Atkinson explained,
are caught between an increasing
participation in the labor force and the
traditional demands of motherhood
and household responsibilities.
But in analyzing the "double
burden" of the Soviet woman,
Atkinson outlined the unique Russian
economic and social structure which
she said led to the duality.
More Women
Wars and internal purges in the
early years of the revolution, Atkinson
explained, decreased the male
population to five or ten million below
the female population. By the end of
World War 11, this imbalance had
increased to the point that there were
twice as many women as men of
child-bearing age.
But increased industrialization in
the 1930s required an expanding labor
force, Atkinson said. Consequently,
women's participation in the labor
force was not only an opportunity,
but a duty. Most single women were
also forced to work, since they could
find no men to support them,
Atkinson added.
Today 92 percent of the women in
the Soviet Union work, Atkinson said,
while most of the remaining eight
percent are on temporary maternity or
child care leaves.
Russian "women and men alike still
hold traditional concepts of what
constitutes the role of the female,"
Atkinson said. So women continue to
have responsibility for housework and
child care, while sharing economic
responsibility with their husbands.
Men Still Favored
This high level of employment is
not matched by equally impressive
career advancement, Atkinson
contended. Men are still favored for
top positions, she said, while women
constitute the majority of the manual
labor force.
In professional fields, women make
up 75 percent of the Soviet doctors
and more than hjalf of the teachers,
Atkinson said. But doctors receive

lower pay than factory workers, and
only 10 percent of college professors
are women.
Soviet women are also granted
scant political representation,
Atkinson maintained. While women
have the right to vote, they make up a
mere 20 percent of the Communist
party. Local party groups include a
reasonable number of women,
Atkinson said, but "feminist
representation diminishes as you go up
the political ladder, and it disappears
when you get to the top."
Because of their doctrine of sexual
equality, Soviet women do not have a
"women's movement," Atkinson said.
Legally they have the same rights and
obligations as men.
But, she concluded, "Soviet history
would indicate that women's roles
can't be restructured without a
corresponding restructuring of men's
roles."

Today 92 percent of the women in
the Soviet Union work, Atkinson said,
while most of the remaining eight
percent are on temporary maternity or
child care leaves.
Russian "women and men alike still
hold traditional concepts of what
constitutes the role of the female,"
Atkinson said. So women continue to
have responsibility for housework and
child care, while sharing economic
responsibility with their husbands.
Men Still Favored
This high level of employment is
not matched by equally impressive
career advancement, Atkinson
contended. Men are still favored for
top positions, she said, while women
constitute the majority of the manual
labor force.
In professional fields, women make
up 75 percent of the Soviet doctors
and more than hjalf of the teachers,
Atkinson said. But doctors receive

lower pay than factory workers, and
only 10 percent of college professors
are women.
Soviet women are also granted
scant political representation,
Atkinson maintained. While women
have the right to vote, they make up a
mere 20 percent of the Communist
party. Local party groups include a
reasonable number of women,
Atkinson said, but "feminist
representation diminishes as you go up
the political ladder, and it disappears
when you get to the top."
Because of their doctrine of sexual
equality, Soviet women do not have a
"women's movement," Atkinson said.
Legally they have the same rights and
obligations as men.
But, she concluded, "Soviet history
would indicate that women's roles
can't be restructured without a
corresponding restructuring of men's
roles."
Although sexual equality has been
part of Soviet doctrine for more than
50 years, women still face the same
dilemma of working women in any
industrial nation, History Prof.
Dorothy Atkinson said yesterday in a
speech sponsored by the Center for
Research on Women (CROW).
Soviet women, Atkinson explained,
are caught between an increasing
participation in the labor force and the
traditional demands of motherhood
and household responsibilities.
But in analyzing the "double
burden" of the Soviet woman,
Atkinson outlined the unique Russian
economic and social structure which
she said led to the duality.
More Women
Wars and internal purges in the
early years of the revolution, Atkinson
explained, decreased the male
population to five or ten million below
the female population. By the end of
World War 11, this imbalance had
increased to the point that there were
twice as many women as men of
child-bearing age.
But increased industrialization in
the 1930s required an expanding labor
force, Atkinson said. Consequently,
women's participation in the labor
force was not only an opportunity,
but a duty. Most single women were
also forced to work, since they could
find no men to support them,
Atkinson added.
