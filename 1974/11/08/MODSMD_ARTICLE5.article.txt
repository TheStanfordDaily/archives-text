# Council Committee Acts On Massage Parlors
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
A Palo Alto City Council committee last
night recommended the city adopt a liberalized
ordinance on massage parlors.
The committee action is intended to regulate
what the police see as a local prostitution
problem.
The Policy and Procedures Committee, after
listening to four hours of debate, voted to water
down a proposed ordinance which would have
set higher licensing fees and stringent standards
for the parlors.
Instead, it sent to the full City Council a
proposal Which would reduce licensing fees, and
eliminate a compulsory medical examination
and a requirement that the parlors keep records
of patronage.
However, provisions allowing city
investigators to enter at any time were retained.
Proposal Attacked
The proposed ordinance was attacked on
both legal and philosophical grounds by a wide
variety of speakers. The ordinance was defended
by a two California Avenue businessmen and a
pair of Christian Scientists, who operate a
reading room which is close to some massage
establishments.
The 40 people in attendance were mostly
quiet and serious, occasionally applauding the
20 speakers. Four City Council members on the
committee Richard Rosenbaum, Enid
Pearson, Roy Clay and Stanley Norton sat
attentively through most of the presentations.
Don Loudon, who owns four massage parlors

that he said gross $300,000 a year, objected
strenuously a rule . . . speaker's
presentation to five minutes. "We can't defend
our business in five minutes," he stated
emphatically, but then abided by the rule
anyway.
Libertarians Speak
Libertarians from Stanford and Santa Clara
County were also out in force. They urged the
City Council to reject the proposed ordinance
on philosophical grounds of human dignity and
personal choice and also on the ground that any
regulation would create a massage industry
cartel reaping monopoly profits.
Defense of the proposed ordinance was
presented by local business representatives and
Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher.
The police chief cited a staff report on how
the proposed ordinance was developed. The
proposed law stemmed from over a year of
investigations and complaints from the l
community, he said.
Curtail Problems
It was devised to curtail at the parlors thefts
from customers (one has been reported), drug
abuse and prostitution, and to control use of the
parlors as "sanctuaries for juvenile girls" who
run away from home and then get jobs by lying
about their age.
Richard Bowdin, a lawyer representing four
massage parlors, accused the report prepared by
the staff and police chief of falsehoods, stating
that there was "no factual basis for the
accusations."

COMMITTEE CONSIDERS-Councilpersons Enid Pearson and Richard Rosenbaum listen to
arguments on a proposed ordinance to regulate massage parlors, at a meeting of the Palo Alto City
Council's Policy and Procedures Committee.
A Palo Alto City Council committee last
night recommended the city adopt a liberalized
ordinance on massage parlors.
The committee action is intended to regulate
what the police see as a local prostitution
problem.
The Policy and Procedures Committee, after
listening to four hours of debate, voted to water
down a proposed ordinance which would have
set higher licensing fees and stringent standards
for the parlors.
Instead, it sent to the full City Council a
proposal Which would reduce licensing fees, and
eliminate a compulsory medical examination
and a requirement that the parlors keep records
of patronage.
However, provisions allowing city
investigators to enter at any time were retained.
Proposal Attacked
The proposed ordinance was attacked on
both legal and philosophical grounds by a wide
variety of speakers. The ordinance was defended
by a two California Avenue businessmen and a
pair of Christian Scientists, who operate a
reading room which is close to some massage
establishments.
The 40 people in attendance were mostly
quiet and serious, occasionally applauding the
20 speakers. Four City Council members on the
committee Richard Rosenbaum, Enid
Pearson, Roy Clay and Stanley Norton sat
attentively through most of the presentations.
Don Loudon, who owns four massage parlors

that he said gross $300,000 a year, objected
strenuously a rule . . . speaker's
presentation to five minutes. "We can't defend
our business in five minutes," he stated
emphatically, but then abided by the rule
anyway.
Libertarians Speak
Libertarians from Stanford and Santa Clara
County were also out in force. They urged the
City Council to reject the proposed ordinance
on philosophical grounds of human dignity and
personal choice and also on the ground that any
regulation would create a massage industry
cartel reaping monopoly profits.
Defense of the proposed ordinance was
presented by local business representatives and
Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher.
The police chief cited a staff report on how
the proposed ordinance was developed. The
proposed law stemmed from over a year of
investigations and complaints from the l
community, he said.
Curtail Problems
It was devised to curtail at the parlors thefts
from customers (one has been reported), drug
abuse and prostitution, and to control use of the
parlors as "sanctuaries for juvenile girls" who
run away from home and then get jobs by lying
about their age.
Richard Bowdin, a lawyer representing four
massage parlors, accused the report prepared by
the staff and police chief of falsehoods, stating
that there was "no factual basis for the
accusations."
