# Drake Calls Left's Spirit 'Optimistic'
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
There is a strong connection
between the development of the "new
left" and the radical black movements
of the last 20 years, Anthropology
Prof. St. Clair Drake said last night.
Drake said the civil rights
movement was "left of the left in
many respects" in that the
"destruction of the Southern caste
system held the center role."
Speaking in Tresidder Lounge last
night, Drake said that in the aftermath
of the black movements a new left
incorporating views of modern social
commentators like Anthropologist
Claude Levi-Strauss has evolved.
"Members of the new left are
leaning to a radical critique to the left
of the left," he said.
Drake, a long-time observer of
American leftist organizations, noted
that radical groups have lately "had
problems with people who feel they're
not moving fast enough."
At the same time, the major black
activist movements of the 60s have
lost steam. "Black vanguardism' is out
of vogue," he noted, and "Eldridge
Cleaver's 'lumpenproletariat' is very
much dead, although I think it was the
most creative element added to
Marxism since Mao."
He said several factors prevented
the black movement from fulfilling the
potential that many radicals believed it
had.
The proponents of urban guerrilla
warfare in the late 60s had hoped to
form a coalition with black militants.
The coalition failed, Drake said,
because the destruction of the
Southern caste system held no tangible
results for the blacks in northern
ghettos. Instead black nationalists
appeared.
Their main preoccupation lies
presently with prison reform, although
one place where the old left "exerts
considerable influence is the old
South," according to Drake. There, he
said, the party is involved with the
organization of sharecroppers.
"The thing that strikes me is that
optimism is the mood" among leftists
in this country, Drake said.
When asked about possible further
radical transformation in the United
States, Drake declined to make
predictions, but said that a coalition
between black and white workers free
of any racist attitudes will have to be
effected before changes can be made.
