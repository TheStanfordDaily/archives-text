# Seeds Of Crisis
## 
### Turgut Gur 
The seeds of the latest Cyprus
crisis were sown four centuries
ago, when the Turks conquered
the predominantly Greek
populated island from the
Venetians in 1571.
The Turks then turned over the
administration of Cyprus to
Britain in 1878 in return for a
British promise to defend Turkey
against Russia, and in 1919
Britain proclaimed Cyprus a
Crown Colony.
In 1954, Archibishop Makarios
and Greek Gen. George Grivas
formed the EOKA terrorist
organization which began
clamoring for enosis, i.e., union
with Greece, and terrorism started
in Cyprus against the Turkish
Cypriots and the British.
After years of terrorism, crises
and negotiations, the 1959
Zurich-London Agreements for
the establishment of an
Independent Cyprus were signed,
and in 1960 the Constitution of
Cyprus was promulgated and the
Republic of Cyprus was
proclaimed.
Article Three
At this point, I would like to
quote Article Three from the
Cyprus Constitution for later
reference:
"In the event of any breach of
the provisions of the Treaty,
Greece, the United Kingdom, and
Turkey undertake to consult
together with a view to making
representations or taking the
necessary steps to ensure
observance of these provisions.
"In so far as common or
concerted action may prove
impossible, each of the three
guaranteeing Powers reserves the
right to take action with the sole l
aim of re-establishing the state of
affairs established by the Treaty."
The 1960 Constitution also
gave the Turkish Cypriots, who
make up about 20 percent of the
island's 600,000 population,
virtual veto power over all
legislation. Also, 30 percent of the
seats in the House of
Representatives were assigned to
the Turkish Cypriot
representatives.
'Tore Up' Constitution
In 1963, to "rebalance" this
situation, President Makarios
effectively tore up the
constitution and turned Grivas
and his "national guardsmen"
loose upon the Turkish Cypriots.
The resulting civil war was
brought under control only after
4000 U.N. troops were rushed in
to separate the two sides.
Under the shaky U.N. truce,
Greece had illegally beefed up the
950-man military force she was
permitted by Treaty to keep in

Cyprus by more than 10,000
troops.
It is at this time in 1964, when
Turkey prepared to exercise
Article Three that President
Johnson sent his famous letter to
the Turkish Premier and
Turkish-American relations turned
from cordiality to bitterness and
disillusionment.
In the following years,
Makarios has brought relentless
economic pressure to bear on the
Turkish Cypriots. Only limited
quantities of gasoline and building
materials have been allowed the
Turks, and Turkish Cypriots have
been free to move outside their
own enclaves only if willing to
submit to search by Greek
Cypriot Police.
Patrols In Villages
In 1967, Grivas pressured the
Makarios Government into
permitting Greek Cypriot Police
to institute patrols in Turkish
Cypriot villages. And with that
Cyprus boiled over again. The
crisis cooled only after Greece
withdrew her 12,000 illegal troops
from the island.
Turkey's concern has always
been for her own security as well
as that of the Turkish Cypriots.
The strength of the Greek communist
element, which had 24 percent of
the votes in 1958, can not be
denied. Even now Turkey has
reasons to doubt Greece's internal
stability.
The whole Aegean coast of
Turkey is boxed in by Greek
offshore islands. A potentially
communist Cyprus just 40 miles
from Turkey would meance the
Turkish ports. So in the recent
crisis of 1974, designed and
precipitated by the Greek Junta in
Athens, Turkey had no choice but
to exercise Article Three.
However, Turkish Prime
Minister Ecevit repeatedly and
consistently reaffirmed that (1)
Turkey wants an independent
Cyprus, (2) Turkey is eager to
hold bilateral discussions with
Greek Premier Caramanlis as
quickly as possible and (3) Turkey
is ready to negotiate the Turkish
controlled zone for a federated
Turkish Cypriot State.
Almost immediately after the
Cyprus coup of July, 1974, both
the U.S. and Britain declared the
necessity for some kind of
autonomy for the long suffering
Turkish Cypriots. And the reasons
for both the U.S. and Britain
favoring some autonomous
solution are undisputably valid
pro-Turkish, but pro-justice
and pro-reality.

crisis cooled only after Greece
withdrew her 12,000 illegal troops
from the island.
Turkey's concern has always
been for her own security as well
as that of the Turkish Cypriots.
The strength of the Greek communist
element, which had 24 percent of
the votes in 1958, can not be
denied. Even now Turkey has
reasons to doubt Greece's internal
stability.
The whole Aegean coast of
Turkey is boxed in by Greek
offshore islands. A potentially
communist Cyprus just 40 miles
from Turkey would meance the
Turkish ports. So in the recent
crisis of 1974, designed and
precipitated by the Greek Junta in
Athens, Turkey had no choice but
to exercise Article Three.
However, Turkish Prime
Minister Ecevit repeatedly and
consistently reaffirmed that (1)
Turkey wants an independent
Cyprus, (2) Turkey is eager to
hold bilateral discussions with
Greek Premier Caramanlis as
quickly as possible and (3) Turkey
is ready to negotiate the Turkish
controlled zone for a federated
Turkish Cypriot State.
Almost immediately after the
Cyprus coup of July, 1974, both
the U.S. and Britain declared the
necessity for some kind of
autonomy for the long suffering
Turkish Cypriots. And the reasons
for both the U.S. and Britain
favoring some autonomous
solution are undisputably valid
pro-Turkish, but pro-justice
and pro-reality.

The seeds of the latest Cyprus
crisis were sown four centuries
ago, when the Turks conquered
the predominantly Greek
populated island from the
Venetians in 1571.
The Turks then turned over the
administration of Cyprus to
Britain in 1878 in return for a
British promise to defend Turkey
against Russia, and in 1919
Britain proclaimed Cyprus a
Crown Colony.
In 1954, Archibishop Makarios
and Greek Gen. George Grivas
formed the EOKA terrorist
organization which began
clamoring for enosis, i.e., union
with Greece, and terrorism started
in Cyprus against the Turkish
Cypriots and the British.
After years of terrorism, crises
and negotiations, the 1959
Zurich-London Agreements for
the establishment of an
Independent Cyprus were signed,
and in 1960 the Constitution of
Cyprus was promulgated and the
Republic of Cyprus was
proclaimed.
Article Three
At this point, I would like to
quote Article Three from the
Cyprus Constitution for later
reference:
"In the event of any breach of
the provisions of the Treaty,
Greece, the United Kingdom, and
Turkey undertake to consult
together with a view to making
representations or taking the
necessary steps to ensure
observance of these provisions.
"In so far as common or
concerted action may prove
impossible, each of the three
guaranteeing Powers reserves the
right to take action with the sole l
aim of re-establishing the state of
affairs established by the Treaty."
The 1960 Constitution also
gave the Turkish Cypriots, who
make up about 20 percent of the
island's 600,000 population,
virtual veto power over all
legislation. Also, 30 percent of the
seats in the House of
Representatives were assigned to
the Turkish Cypriot
representatives.
'Tore Up' Constitution
In 1963, to "rebalance" this
situation, President Makarios
effectively tore up the
constitution and turned Grivas
and his "national guardsmen"
loose upon the Turkish Cypriots.
The resulting civil war was
brought under control only after
4000 U.N. troops were rushed in
to separate the two sides.
Under the shaky U.N. truce,
Greece had illegally beefed up the
950-man military force she was
permitted by Treaty to keep in

Cyprus by more than 10,000
troops.
It is at this time in 1964, when
Turkey prepared to exercise
Article Three that President
Johnson sent his famous letter to
the Turkish Premier and
Turkish-American relations turned
from cordiality to bitterness and
disillusionment.
In the following years,
Makarios has brought relentless
economic pressure to bear on the
Turkish Cypriots. Only limited
quantities of gasoline and building
materials have been allowed the
Turks, and Turkish Cypriots have
been free to move outside their
own enclaves only if willing to
submit to search by Greek
Cypriot Police.
Patrols In Villages
In 1967, Grivas pressured the
Makarios Government into
permitting Greek Cypriot Police
to institute patrols in Turkish
Cypriot villages. And with that
Cyprus boiled over again. The
crisis cooled only after Greece
withdrew her 12,000 illegal troops
from the island.

legislation. Also, 30 percent of the
seats in the House of
Representatives were assigned to
the Turkish Cypriot
representatives.
'Tore Up' Constitution
In 1963, to "rebalance" this
situation, President Makarios
effectively tore up the
constitution and turned Grivas
and his "national guardsmen"
loose upon the Turkish Cypriots.
The resulting civil war was
brought under control only after
4000 U.N. troops were rushed in
to separate the two sides.
Under the shaky U.N. truce,
Greece had illegally beefed up the
950-man military force she was
permitted by Treaty to keep in

Cyprus by more than 10,000
troops.
It is at this time in 1964, when
Turkey prepared to exercise
Article Three that President
Johnson sent his famous letter to
the Turkish Premier and
Turkish-American relations turned
from cordiality to bitterness and
disillusionment.
In the following years,
Makarios has brought relentless
economic pressure to bear on the
Turkish Cypriots. Only limited
quantities of gasoline and building
materials have been allowed the
Turks, and Turkish Cypriots have
been free to move outside their
own enclaves only if willing to
submit to search by Greek
Cypriot Police.
Patrols In Villages
In 1967, Grivas pressured the
Makarios Government into
permitting Greek Cypriot Police
to institute patrols in Turkish
Cypriot villages. And with that
Cyprus boiled over again. The
crisis cooled only after Greece
withdrew her 12,000 illegal troops
from the island.
Turkey's concern has always
been for her own security as well
as that of the Turkish Cypriots.
The strength of the Greek communist
element, which had 24 percent of
the votes in 1958, can not be
denied. Even now Turkey has
reasons to doubt Greece's internal
stability.
The whole Aegean coast of
Turkey is boxed in by Greek
offshore islands. A potentially
communist Cyprus just 40 miles
from Turkey would meance the
Turkish ports. So in the recent
crisis of 1974, designed and
precipitated by the Greek Junta in
Athens, Turkey had no choice but
to exercise Article Three.
However, Turkish Prime
Minister Ecevit repeatedly and
consistently reaffirmed that (1)
Turkey wants an independent
Cyprus, (2) Turkey is eager to
hold bilateral discussions with
Greek Premier Caramanlis as
quickly as possible and (3) Turkey
is ready to negotiate the Turkish
controlled zone for a federated
Turkish Cypriot State.
Almost immediately after the
Cyprus coup of July, 1974, both
the U.S. and Britain declared the
necessity for some kind of
autonomy for the long suffering
Turkish Cypriots. And the reasons
for both the U.S. and Britain
favoring some autonomous
solution are undisputably valid
pro-Turkish, but pro-justice
and pro-reality.

The seeds of the latest Cyprus
crisis were sown four centuries
ago, when the Turks conquered
the predominantly Greek
populated island from the
Venetians in 1571.
The Turks then turned over the
administration of Cyprus to
Britain in 1878 in return for a
British promise to defend Turkey
against Russia, and in 1919
Britain proclaimed Cyprus a
Crown Colony.
In 1954, Archibishop Makarios
and Greek Gen. George Grivas
formed the EOKA terrorist
organization which began
clamoring for enosis, i.e., union
with Greece, and terrorism started
in Cyprus against the Turkish
Cypriots and the British.
After years of terrorism, crises
and negotiations, the 1959
Zurich-London Agreements for
the establishment of an
Independent Cyprus were signed,
and in 1960 the Constitution of
Cyprus was promulgated and the
Republic of Cyprus was
proclaimed.
Article Three
At this point, I would like to
quote Article Three from the
Cyprus Constitution for later
reference:
"In the event of any breach of
the provisions of the Treaty,
Greece, the United Kingdom, and
Turkey undertake to consult
together with a view to making
representations or taking the
necessary steps to ensure
observance of these provisions.
"In so far as common or
concerted action may prove
impossible, each of the three
guaranteeing Powers reserves the
right to take action with the sole l
aim of re-establishing the state of
affairs established by the Treaty."
The 1960 Constitution also
gave the Turkish Cypriots, who
make up about 20 percent of the
island's 600,000 population,
virtual veto power over all
legislation. Also, 30 percent of the
seats in the House of
Representatives were assigned to
the Turkish Cypriot
representatives.
