# Health Co-Op Planned By Local Organization

### SUSAN LUTTNER 
v The Mid-Peninsula Cooperative
Health Maintenance Organization is
working on final plans to set up a
consumer-run health plan, the
chairman of the Planning Committee,
Dr. Halsted Holman, has announced.
The cooperative, initiated by
I University faculty, staff and students
more than three years ago, is still
waiting to hear an official
confirmation of its tax-exempt status,
Holman said. But the decision has
already been made to continue
planning.
Unlike insurance plans like Blue
4 Cross, which help pay the costs when a
patient is sick, the cooperative will
take responsibility for maintaining
health and providing all needed
services, according to the proposal.
Holman, a professor of medicine
here, said the inspiration for the
* project "came from a lot of different
people over a long period of time."

The original planners, he explained,
worked with the realizations that
health care is getting increasingly
expensive and that medical experts
have not yet agreed on what good
health care actually entails.
Specifically, some doctors contend
that drugs, "indecisive" diagnostic
tests and hospitalization are overused,
Holman said. In addition to increasing
medical costs, these practices might
actually erode the quality of health
care, according to a report submitted
last spring by the Joint Planning
Committee.
"A certain percentage of the people
who take drugs have a reaction to the
drugs," Holman said. Similarly tests
and hospitalizations cause a certain
number of illnesses through
unnecessary exposure to drugs and
germs.
One of the objectives of the health
cooperative, he said, will be to
determine what good health care
actually is, with more emphasis on
home care.
After about three years of study,
Holman said, the planners concluded
that a pre-paid, cooperative system
would be the best framework for
providing quality health care while
keeping down costs.
Economically, the cooperative will
probably be very similar to the Kaiser
Plan, with pre-paid services available to
members. But Kaiser is hospital-based,
and the proposed cooperative will be
community-based, Holman
emphasized, adding that "this
difference can be essential."

The Kaiser plan is also organized by
doctors for the subscribers, while the
cooperative will be organized by
consumers for themselves.
Since the organization will be
owned and run by its members,
Holman said, the group will decide
exactly what balance to strike between

the type of care available and the cost.
He said that he expects a cooperative
system, in which volunteer work can
offset high medical personnel costs.
'Better And Cheaper'
A health system emphasizing
preventative education and home care,
Holman said, is "potentially better and
cheaper" than the current "fee for
services" medical system.
"Present approaches to preventative
medicine have not been really
successful," Holman said, but research
has not yet concentrated on small

family units. The cooperative might
also try to reduce the impact of
chronic illnesses on patients' lives, he
added, by providing home services and
community support.
The cooperative will initially
concentrate on membership in the
Palo Alto area, where it will provide
facilities "convenient to public and
private transportation," according to
the current proposal. For specialty
hospital care, it plans to contract with
organizations in the community
probably the Stanford Hospital.
A survey last year of University

faculty, staff and married students
indicated that 10 percent would
immediately join such a cooperative
and that 20 percent would consider it.
In the community, the cooperative
plans to serve senior citizens,
recipients of MediCal health services
and members of employee groups and
trade unions.
Under Article XIII of the Health
Maintenance Act, passed in 1973, the
federal government is encouraging
group health plans through grants and
loans to proposed Health Maintenance
Organizations.

the type of care available and the cost.
He said that he expects a cooperative
system, in which volunteer work can
offset high medical personnel costs.
'Better And Cheaper'
A health system emphasizing
preventative education and home care,
Holman said, is "potentially better and
cheaper" than the current "fee for
services" medical system.
"Present approaches to preventative
medicine have not been really
successful," Holman said, but research
has not yet concentrated on small

family units. The cooperative might
also try to reduce the impact of
chronic illnesses on patients' lives, he
added, by providing home services and
community support.
The cooperative will initially
concentrate on membership in the
Palo Alto area, where it will provide
facilities "convenient to public and
private transportation," according to
the current proposal. For specialty
hospital care, it plans to contract with
organizations in the community
probably the Stanford Hospital.
A survey last year of University

faculty, staff and married students
indicated that 10 percent would
immediately join such a cooperative
and that 20 percent would consider it.
In the community, the cooperative
plans to serve senior citizens,
recipients of MediCal health services
and members of employee groups and
trade unions.
Under Article XIII of the Health
Maintenance Act, passed in 1973, the
federal government is encouraging
group health plans through grants and
loans to proposed Health Maintenance
Organizations.
v The Mid-Peninsula Cooperative
Health Maintenance Organization is
working on final plans to set up a
consumer-run health plan, the
chairman of the Planning Committee,
Dr. Halsted Holman, has announced.
The cooperative, initiated by
I University faculty, staff and students
more than three years ago, is still
waiting to hear an official
confirmation of its tax-exempt status,
Holman said. But the decision has
already been made to continue
planning.
Unlike insurance plans like Blue
4 Cross, which help pay the costs when a
patient is sick, the cooperative will
take responsibility for maintaining
health and providing all needed
services, according to the proposal.
Holman, a professor of medicine
here, said the inspiration for the
* project "came from a lot of different
people over a long period of time."

The original planners, he explained,
worked with the realizations that
health care is getting increasingly
expensive and that medical experts
have not yet agreed on what good
health care actually entails.
Specifically, some doctors contend
that drugs, "indecisive" diagnostic
tests and hospitalization are overused,
Holman said. In addition to increasing
medical costs, these practices might
actually erode the quality of health
care, according to a report submitted
last spring by the Joint Planning
Committee.
"A certain percentage of the people
who take drugs have a reaction to the
drugs," Holman said. Similarly tests
and hospitalizations cause a certain
number of illnesses through
unnecessary exposure to drugs and
germs.
One of the objectives of the health
cooperative, he said, will be to
determine what good health care
actually is, with more emphasis on
home care.
After about three years of study,
Holman said, the planners concluded
that a pre-paid, cooperative system
