# University Deserves City's Patience
## 
### Jim Wascher 
Palo Alto City Council member Enid
Pearson has once again demanded a pound of
flesh from Stanford. Fortunately, a majority
of her colleagues on the Council decided last
week that she would not get it.
Pearson has a long, not-so-distinguished
record of supporting measures which the
University opposes and of opposing those
which Stanford supports.
Most of the time, however, the outcome
of the issue will not crucially affect
Stanford's financial picture, but the current
dispute over connecting Campus Drive with
Junipero Serra Boulevard is an exception to
the rule.
Last Monday, the Council approved a
proposal to widen Willow Road to 90 feet
and four lanes between San Francisquito
Creek and El Camino Real. The measure will
relieve traffic jams on the road, which are
caused, * in part, by people entering and
leaving the campus. Widening the road should
also improve business at the Stanford
Shopping Center.
And although the city will only have to
pay for approximately 10 percent of the
widening project, Pearson was one of two
Council members who voted against the
measure.
'Quid Pro Quo'
Instead, she supported an amendment
sponsored by Councilman Alan Henderson
which would have required Stanford
immediately to construct at least two lanes
of Campus Drive from its present terminus

near the Medical Center to connect with
Junipero Serra Boulevard. In exchange, Palo
Alto would then widen Willow Road.
The proposal' ultimately adopted by the
Council will give the University "a reasonable
period of time" to add to Campus Drive, and
will allow the widening of Willow Road to
proceed independently.
Pearson objected to the "reasonable time"
clause despite the immediate money
problems Stanford is facing. The University's
financial crisis is so severe that the
Administration has ordered every department
to cut three percent from this year's budget.
Another $lO million must be cut from the
total budget over the three following years.
Urgent Problem
Ignoring the obvious urgency of this
problem, Pearson accused Stanford of
deliberately stalling on its 1968 commitment
to build the Campus Drive-Junipero Serra
link.
What she wants to do is blackmail
Stanford into constructing the link before it
can reasonably afford it. "We have the ace,"
she told the Council last week, "let's use it."
For one reason or another, Council woman
Pearson appears to believe that Stanford
owes Palo Alto—and her—some sort of
monetary tribute for the privilege of being
located near the city.
Time and again, she insists that the
University tries to palm off its own problems
on the city without attempting to solve them
itself. This, Pearson contends, represents

bullying of helpless Palo Alto by the giant
which has grown up with it.
Stanford Benefits City
Ridiculous. Stanford has given Palo Alto
much more than it has taken. For instance,
there are the Stanford Shopping Center and
the Stanford Industrial Park—both built on
University land.
Stanford does take in a considerable
chunk of rent money from the firms which
occupy this land, but then again, the city also
receives substantial tax revenues from these
same businesses—revenues which Palo Alto
would not otherwise have received, had it not
been for Stanford.
If this is the sort of "bullying" Pearson is
talking about, then a reasonable person
would expect her to be asking for more of it,
rather than less.
Quite naturally, Stanford has created its
share of problems for the area. But to blame
the University for every little thing that goes
badly for Palo Alto seems a bit absurd.
Stanford and Palo Alto both benefit from
their association—and both have concomitant
responsibilities to bear.
For Pearson to demand that Stanford
jeopardize its financial security merely to
satisfy her own whims smacks of unfairness
and renders the essential cooperation
between the University and the city far more
difficult to achieve.
