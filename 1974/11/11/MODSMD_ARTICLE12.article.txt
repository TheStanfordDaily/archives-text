# UFW Victimized By Teamster Lies
## 
### Chris Colemon 
I am writing in regard to the
column from the Oregon
Barometer concerning the United
Farm Worker's (UFW) current
struggle to win back contracts
with E. & J. Gallo Winery. I was,
and still am, apalled by this
outrageously deceptive attack
against the UFW and it's efforts to
obtain economic justice for field
laborers.
Two basic points are dealt with
by the Barometer editorial. First,
it claims that the Teamster
contract signed in 1973 with
Gallo "made them the highest
paid farmworkers in the
continental United States" with
several other benefits too. Second,
it states that the Teamster's Union
is the union that the workers have
chosen to represent them.
In reference to ,the issue of
wages: According to the Teamster
contract, Gallo workers receive
$2.89 per hour for general labor,
as of April 1,1974.
More important however, is
the fact that although Teamster
contracts may provide for $2.89
per hour plus other benefits, the
workers never actually see those
provisions become a reality. More
than one-fifth of each worker's
pay is taken out each month to
insure a salary for the labor
contractor and to go into a
pension which workers rarely, if
ever, receive.
UFW Negotiations
The claim that the Teamster's
union properly represents the
workers is another disgraceful
mockery of justice. On March 22,
1973, the UFW began
negotiations with Gallo for the
renewal of contracts it had held
since 1967. Negotiations
continued with Gallo fighting to
eliminate hiring halls and controls
on pesticides.
Teamster organizers then began
entering Gallo fields on April 25.
They were accompanied by Gallo
supervisors and carried with them
information on workers' names,
phone numbers and how many
members of a given family worked
for Gallo. When Cesar Chavez

made public his demand for secret
ballot elections to determine
union representation, Gallo, on
May 21, telegrammed the UFW
saying "You misunderstood our
previous communications. The
Teamsters do not represent our
workers... we can continue
negotiations at any time."
However, the Teamsters, with
Gallo supervisors, continued to
enter Gallo fields pressuring
workers to sign authorization
cards. A majority of the workers
refused. On June 26, Gallo
supervisors gave letters to their
workers saying that the Teamsters
would be the bargaining agent.
The next day, the workers
called a strike. Meanwhile a group
of priests and nuns led by Sister
Joyce Higgins attempted to

present authorization cards for
UFW representation from 173 of
the 222 Galo workers who were
on payroll April 18, 1973. Galjo
refused to see or hear from Sister
Higgins despite her repeated
telephone calls and telegrams. On
July 7, the Teamsters formally
announced that they would be the
workers' bargaining agent.
After one negotiating session, a
four-year contract was signed by
Gallo with the Teamsters. The
Teamsters claim that they had
obtained 158 authorization cards
requesting Teamster
representation. None of these
cards has been made public.
Thousands Affected
The Gallo boycott affects
approximately 10,000 workers
since Gallo buys one-third of all

table grapes in the United States
to supplement its production
from it's own fields.
The above account of the 1973
Gallo negotiations seriously
questions the validity of the
Teamster's claim to represent
Gallo workers. It also reveals the
deceit and intimidation used by
both growers and Teamsters
against the workers.
It is sad enough that the
farmworkers of America are
subjected to humiliating wages
and absurd working conditions.
Now they must also face an
onslaught of grower and Teamster
lies.
The boycott will continue. It
will continue until the workers
have won. Viva la Cause!
