# Rockefeller Needs Probe
## 
### Anthony Harrigan 
At a time when Congress is concerned about
Nelson Rockefeller's loans and gifts to public
officials, including Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, it is only proper that the Senate and
House committees carefully scrutinize the role of
the Rockefeller interests in the shaping of foreign
policy.
A good place to begin such scrutiny is the
Commission on United States-Latin American
Relations, which recently issued a controversial
report.
This private commission was financed by the
Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Ford Foundation
and other like-minded groups.
The Commission's recommendations include
turning over the Panama Canal to the Panamanian
government, withdrawal of U.S. forces from the
Canal Zone, an end to U.S. military advisory groups
in Latin America.
In considering self-elected commissions of this
sort, Congress and the public have a right to ask
what special interests are involved. Now that
former Gov. Rockefeller is Vice President
Designate, this matter becomes one of real and
immediate concern.
The Senate Rules Committee, for example,
certainly should probe the extent of the
Rockefeller Brothers Fund involvement in the

Commission.
Who sets the political priorities for the
Rockefeller Brothers Fund? What is the Fund's
special interest in this commission and in a radical
change in U.S. policy toward Latin America?
Is the Commission's policy statement subscribed
to by Gov. Rockefeller? Did he have any input in
its work or the selection of commission members?
Financial Links?
j Do any commission members have any financial
links to Rockefeller enterprises? Have they been
the beneficiaries of any loans or gifts from the
Rockefellers or the Chase Manhattan Bank, of
which David Rockefeller is chairman?
There is a major issue in all this: Is the making
of American foreign policy to be public business or
does Rockefeller plan to bring his private
government with him to Washington?
Many Americans are profoundly concerned
about the danger of Rockefeller transferring a kind
of second government to the nation's capital, an
inter-locking directorate of foundations and
commissions funded by the Rockefeller interests
and their allies. Clearly, it is the duty of Congress
to probe deeply into this situation no matter how
much time it takes.
