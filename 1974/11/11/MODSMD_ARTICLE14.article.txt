Stanford 1977: It's been two
years since fraternities were
transformed on the Stanford
campus. It is true that the tight
bonds of brotherhood which once
existed between a group of guys
pledged to live together for three
years no longer exists in the frats,
but the house doors still read
Kappa Alpha or Theta Delts so, as
Stanford promised, they
obviously aren't dead.

Remember too that about 47
more people had a shot at
on-campus housing the last two
years. Now the waiting list has
only 1217 names on it.
Last week however, the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) received a request for a
White Students Theme House.
The petitioners claimed they
deserve a place on campus where
they were entitled to the same
priorities granted to minority
students.
As Wendy Wasp pointed out*
"Why should a chicano student
with a higher draw number than
me get housing in Zapata when I
end up off campus because I lived
in a frosh house with no
priorities?"
Ethnic Priority
COSS promptly declared the
ethnic priority as well as the
present residence priority system
a discriminatory practice. The
new proposal is to give all
students an equal chance to draw
into theme houses.
At a meeting in Madera, a
Junipero student asked the Dean
of Residential Education how
Junipero could possibly maintain
an Asian theme should only seven
Asians manage to draw in. The
Dean's response was that the
majority of students do not
choose to live in a theme house
and their interests must be taken
into account. At every meeting he
had attended most students
showed little interest in theme
houses.
The consensus on the issue at
various meetings according to the
Dean was that a system of only
four-class dorms with no priorities
would be ideal and the only way
to give all students an equal
chance at housing. Another
student from Otero mentioned
that this would make all housing
the epitome of uniform egalitarian
mediocrity.
More Complaints
In most four-class dorms all he
constantly heard was people
complaining about what a pit the
house was with everyone on their
own trip. Everyone seemed to be
reminiscing about how together
their all-freshman houses had
been. In fact the student felt that
freshman houses were the only
time most students really shared a
common experience and a
common feeling together.
Now the University was
gradually eliminating all
upperclassmen's chances for such
unique living experiences. But it
was too late. The frats were gone,
theme houses and row houses
were going and now a new seed
was planted. Why should
freshmen be guaranteed a year on
campus? The possibilities seemed
endless. They might even reduce
the waiting list to less than a
thousand next year.
Extended Logic
Perhaps this all sounds far
fetched, but I have sought only to
extend the logic being used by
those who will be making
decisions on housing policy issues.
For all our youthful
open-mindedness we students are
as quick as anyone to deny
alternatives to others because we
do not share an interest in those
alternatives.
Equality for women still could
be solved by adding more
alternatives rather than reducing
those we have. At least try to look
at the issues with an open mind.
There seems to be so much bias
around me that I suspect a plot is
afoot. It could be the University
feels that by pushing
egalitarianism far enough campus
housing will become so bland and
stale that students will move
elsewhere. That would end the
housing shortage crisis and save
Stanford the expense of new
dorms.
May I end with a fractured
quote: "First they came for the
frats, but they were a bunch of
sexist animals anyway so it was no
loss. Then they went for the
theme houses and who wants to
live with 'those people' after all.
But dammit, then they came for
us."
