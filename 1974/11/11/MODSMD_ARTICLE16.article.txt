# Quest For 'The Best Piece In Town'
## 'Daily' Offers No Endorsement In Pizza Taste Test 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Not all pizzas are alike.
Behind every campus-area
pizza establishment lies a
distinctive product. The Daily
recently attempted to single out
the £>est piece in town curing its
First Annual Pizza Taste Test.
Assuming the name of
Smoodla, the Daily ordered
half-pepperoni, half-sausage pizzas
from seven local eateries. By 10
p.m. it was all over.
After considering the strong

and weak points of each entry,
the 25 self-proclaimed pizza
experts participating in the
judging found each candidate
equally (dis)tasteful.
In keeping with the spirit of
the current election year, the
Daily pizza panel cannot endorse
any one candidate. But for the
benefit of pizza lovers in the
Stanford community, it offers
some observations and
suggestions.
No pizza parlor in the Stanford

area will deliver evening
study-break fare to your door on
a cardboard platter. But if you
have a telephone, a car and
$3.60-4.88 in your wallet, you
can have a large meaty pizza in
your room within half an hour.
Half of the taste testers said
they usually buy pizza at the
Round Table on University
Avenue. But after sampling pieces
of seven different pizzas, without
knowing where each came from,
only five panelists selected the
University Avenue Round Table
entry as their favorite. None of
them thought it was the worst ot
the samples. Finding it
well-seasoned and provocative, the
taste testers decided it was the
spiciest of the pizzas.
The California Avenue Round
Table entry also failed to get any
"worst pizza" votes, but only
three of the tasters thought it was
the best. Not only is University
Avenue Round Table closer to
campus it sells the same pizza
for one cent less than its
California Avenue counterpart.
Controversial Crust
The most controversial pizza
came from Jose's, a Palo Alto
restaurant which features Cuban
and Bolivian specialties. What
individual judges thought of Jose's
unique wheat-flour crust
depended largely on what side of
the knife they were on.
"It's impossible to cut,"
exclaimed chief pizza cutter Patty

Fels. Taster Valerie Kriz said the
crust was "too doughy, but it had
a good flavor." Primo Santini, one
of six judges who thought Jose's
pizza was the best of the samples,
explained simply, "I'm a crust
man."
Another crust man, Daily
Sports Editor Viae Kershner, said
Jose's crust was "incredible" and
topped with good sausage. "It's
the best damn pizza I've ever
had," Kershner added. Even
though the origins of the seven
samples were a closely guarded
secret during the test, Karen
O'Leary, a frequent patron of
Jose's, was able to pick out its
entry because "it had lots of
cheese and good meat."
Although only one judge
thought it was the worst pizza and
only three disliked the crust,
those who praise the quality of
Jose's pizza should be willing to
pay more for it. Jose's charges
$4.88 for a half-pepperoni,
half-sausage pizza, nearly $1.30
more than the least expensive
sample, which came from the
Amber Lantern.
Cheapest Pizza
The Amber Lantern is the site
of legendary fraternity
beer-drinking marathons, but
there is no truth to the rumor that
national TV talent scouts will
discover you if you hang out
there. The Lantern's $3.60 pizza
is memorable tor its "thin crust
and lots of tasty pepperoni,"

according to Daily film reviewer
George Powell.
Another taster thought the
meat on the Lantern pizza was
"incredibly lousy," but agreed
there was lots of it.
Self-proclaimed "pizza addict"
Kathy Batts thought the Lantern
pizza was all-around best becuase
of its "good crust and pepperoni."
Stanford bandsman Randy
Baker remarked, "I think the
important thing is how well the
cheese spreads over the pizza."
Using Baker's standard, panelists
singled out the pizza from
Shakey's in Palo Alto.
Tasty Meat, Cheese
"It was the best all-around
blend of cheese, crust, sauce and
meat," Associate Editor Glenn
Garvin claimed. Alex Hulanicki
said the Shakey's pizza had
"distinctive cheese swiss and
monterey jack."
In the crust department,
however, Shakey's earned poor
marks from most of the juges. Of
the pizza parlors surveyed,
Shakey's is farthest from campus.
The two pizzas that pleased the
Daily's judges least came from the
V.I.P. Delicatessen in Palo Alto
and the Village Host in Menlo
Park.
One taster branded the V.l.P.'s
product as "bland and slightly
greasy." Another said it was
"soggy and topped with poor
cheese."
Mark Van Allen, who turned in

the most grease-stained ballots,
said the Village Host's pizza was
"greasier than motor oil."
Most campus area pizza
purveyors recommend that
customers call in their orders in
advance, so that piping hot pizza
will be ready for pickup when
they arrive.
However, a man who answered

the phone at the Village Host said
his establishment doesn't put the
pizza in the oven right away if the
customer sounds like a student.
He said many younger callers
phone in an order but never show
up to claim it. One no-show is a
Village Host legend. Some guy by
the name of Smoodla ....

half-sausage pizza, nearly $1.30
more than the least expensive
sample, which came from the
Amber Lantern.
Cheapest Pizza
The Amber Lantern is the site
of legendary fraternity
beer-drinking marathons, but
there is no truth to the rumor that

is memorable tor its "thin crust

according to Daily film reviewer

there was lots of it.

singled out the pizza from

"It was the best all-around
blend of cheese, crust, sauce and
meat," Associate Editor Glenn
Garvin claimed. Alex Hulanicki
said the Shakey's pizza had
"distinctive cheese swiss and

In the crust department,
however, Shakey's earned poor
marks from most of the juges. Of
the pizza parlors surveyed,
Shakey's is farthest from campus.
The two pizzas that pleased the

One taster branded the V.l.P.'s
product as "bland and slightly

"soggy and topped with poor

Mark Van Allen, who turned in

the most grease-stained ballots,
said the Village Host's pizza was

OF MUNCHING MINIONS - This thoughtful 'Daily' staffer takes
another bite before deciding on the quality of this slice of Palo Alto's
many varieties of pizza during the First Annual Pizza Taste Test.
Not all pizzas are alike.
Behind every campus-area
pizza establishment lies a
distinctive product. The Daily
recently attempted to single out
the £>est piece in town curing its
First Annual Pizza Taste Test.
Assuming the name of
Smoodla, the Daily ordered
half-pepperoni, half-sausage pizzas
from seven local eateries. By 10
p.m. it was all over.
After considering the strong

and weak points of each entry,
the 25 self-proclaimed pizza
experts participating in the
judging found each candidate
equally (dis)tasteful.
In keeping with the spirit of
the current election year, the
Daily pizza panel cannot endorse
any one candidate. But for the
benefit of pizza lovers in the
Stanford community, it offers
some observations and
suggestions.
No pizza parlor in the Stanford

area will deliver evening
study-break fare to your door on
a cardboard platter. But if you
have a telephone, a car and
$3.60-4.88 in your wallet, you
can have a large meaty pizza in
your room within half an hour.
Half of the taste testers said
they usually buy pizza at the
Round Table on University
Avenue. But after sampling pieces
of seven different pizzas, without
knowing where each came from,
only five panelists selected the
University Avenue Round Table
entry as their favorite. None of
them thought it was the worst ot
the samples. Finding it
well-seasoned and provocative, the
taste testers decided it was the
spiciest of the pizzas.
The California Avenue Round
Table entry also failed to get any
"worst pizza" votes, but only
three of the tasters thought it was
the best. Not only is University
Avenue Round Table closer to
campus it sells the same pizza
for one cent less than its
California Avenue counterpart.
Controversial Crust
The most controversial pizza
came from Jose's, a Palo Alto
restaurant which features Cuban
and Bolivian specialties. What
individual judges thought of Jose's
unique wheat-flour crust
depended largely on what side of
the knife they were on.
"It's impossible to cut,"
exclaimed chief pizza cutter Patty

Fels. Taster Valerie Kriz said the
crust was "too doughy, but it had
a good flavor." Primo Santini, one
of six judges who thought Jose's
pizza was the best of the samples,
explained simply, "I'm a crust
man."
Another crust man, Daily
Sports Editor Viae Kershner, said
Jose's crust was "incredible" and
topped with good sausage. "It's
the best damn pizza I've ever
had," Kershner added. Even
though the origins of the seven
samples were a closely guarded
secret during the test, Karen
O'Leary, a frequent patron of
Jose's, was able to pick out its

OF MUNCHING MINIONS - This thoughtful 'Daily' staffer takes
another bite before deciding on the quality of this slice of Palo Alto's
many varieties of pizza during the First Annual Pizza Taste Test.
Not all pizzas are alike.
Behind every campus-area
pizza establishment lies a
distinctive product. The Daily
recently attempted to single out
the £>est piece in town curing its
First Annual Pizza Taste Test.
Assuming the name of
Smoodla, the Daily ordered
half-pepperoni, half-sausage pizzas
from seven local eateries. By 10
p.m. it was all over.
After considering the strong

and weak points of each entry,
the 25 self-proclaimed pizza
experts participating in the
judging found each candidate
equally (dis)tasteful.
In keeping with the spirit of
the current election year, the
Daily pizza panel cannot endorse
any one candidate. But for the
benefit of pizza lovers in the
Stanford community, it offers
some observations and
suggestions.
No pizza parlor in the Stanford

area will deliver evening
study-break fare to your door on
a cardboard platter. But if you
have a telephone, a car and
$3.60-4.88 in your wallet, you
can have a large meaty pizza in
your room within half an hour.
Half of the taste testers said
they usually buy pizza at the
Round Table on University
Avenue. But after sampling pieces
of seven different pizzas, without
knowing where each came from,
only five panelists selected the
University Avenue Round Table
entry as their favorite. None of
them thought it was the worst ot
the samples. Finding it
well-seasoned and provocative, the
taste testers decided it was the
spiciest of the pizzas.
The California Avenue Round
Table entry also failed to get any
"worst pizza" votes, but only
three of the tasters thought it was
the best. Not only is University
Avenue Round Table closer to
campus it sells the same pizza
for one cent less than its
California Avenue counterpart.
Controversial Crust
The most controversial pizza
came from Jose's, a Palo Alto
restaurant which features Cuban
and Bolivian specialties. What
individual judges thought of Jose's
unique wheat-flour crust
depended largely on what side of
the knife they were on.
"It's impossible to cut,"
exclaimed chief pizza cutter Patty

Fels. Taster Valerie Kriz said the
crust was "too doughy, but it had
a good flavor." Primo Santini, one
of six judges who thought Jose's
pizza was the best of the samples,
explained simply, "I'm a crust
man."
Another crust man, Daily
Sports Editor Viae Kershner, said
Jose's crust was "incredible" and
topped with good sausage. "It's
the best damn pizza I've ever
had," Kershner added. Even
though the origins of the seven
samples were a closely guarded
secret during the test, Karen
O'Leary, a frequent patron of
Jose's, was able to pick out its
entry because "it had lots of
cheese and good meat."
Although only one judge
thought it was the worst pizza and
only three disliked the crust,
those who praise the quality of
Jose's pizza should be willing to
pay more for it. Jose's charges
$4.88 for a half-pepperoni,
half-sausage pizza, nearly $1.30
more than the least expensive
sample, which came from the
Amber Lantern.
Cheapest Pizza
The Amber Lantern is the site
of legendary fraternity
beer-drinking marathons, but
there is no truth to the rumor that
national TV talent scouts will
discover you if you hang out
there. The Lantern's $3.60 pizza
is memorable tor its "thin crust
and lots of tasty pepperoni,"

according to Daily film reviewer
George Powell.
Another taster thought the
meat on the Lantern pizza was
"incredibly lousy," but agreed
there was lots of it.
Self-proclaimed "pizza addict"
Kathy Batts thought the Lantern
pizza was all-around best becuase
of its "good crust and pepperoni."
Stanford bandsman Randy
Baker remarked, "I think the
important thing is how well the
cheese spreads over the pizza."
Using Baker's standard, panelists
singled out the pizza from
Shakey's in Palo Alto.
Tasty Meat, Cheese
"It was the best all-around
blend of cheese, crust, sauce and
meat," Associate Editor Glenn
Garvin claimed. Alex Hulanicki
said the Shakey's pizza had
"distinctive cheese swiss and
monterey jack."
In the crust department,
however, Shakey's earned poor
marks from most of the juges. Of
the pizza parlors surveyed,
Shakey's is farthest from campus.
The two pizzas that pleased the
Daily's judges least came from the
V.I.P. Delicatessen in Palo Alto
and the Village Host in Menlo
Park.
One taster branded the V.l.P.'s
product as "bland and slightly
greasy." Another said it was
"soggy and topped with poor
cheese."
Mark Van Allen, who turned in

the most grease-stained ballots,
said the Village Host's pizza was
"greasier than motor oil."
Most campus area pizza
purveyors recommend that
customers call in their orders in
advance, so that piping hot pizza
will be ready for pickup when
they arrive.
However, a man who answered

the phone at the Village Host said
his establishment doesn't put the
pizza in the oven right away if the
customer sounds like a student.
He said many younger callers
phone in an order but never show
up to claim it. One no-show is a
Village Host legend. Some guy by
the name of Smoodla ....
