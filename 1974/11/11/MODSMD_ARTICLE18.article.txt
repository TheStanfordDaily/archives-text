# Legal Competence Must Be Checked
## Ex-ABA President Calls For Reform

Lawyers should be required to
show their continuing compet
ence, allowed to advertise more
than they now do and encouraged
to tithe their services for the
public good, Chesterfield Smith
told Stanford Law School alumni
Friday.
Smith, the immediate past
president of the American Bar
Association, said states should
require attorneys, under the

supervision of the organized bar,
to "periodically refurbish, renew
and update their legal
knowledge."
To claim that the marketplace
alone can weed out bad lawyers is
"bunk," he told an audience of
nearly 200 at Rickey's Hyatt
House. "Clients are not even
remotely able to evaluate the
ability of their own attorney."
Grievance committees of the
bar should immediately add lay

members, he declared. "The
organized bar should not oppose,
and perhaps should evert
encourage, malpractice suits
against incompetent attorneys."
Where malpractice complaints
are justified, these committees
should recommend financial
settlements by the guilty lawyer,
"or if that fails, furnish witnesses
for the injured party in a
malpractice suit," Smith said.
The legal profession should
revise "the almost blanket
prohibition against advertising,"
he added. While large law firms
may still establish their
professional reputation within the
national commercial, financial and

industrial community, "it does
not work that way for the mass of
the population anymore," he
declared.
"The mass market which can
be tapped to increase the
utilization of lawyers is the many
[people] who now simply forego
any legal remedy for their wrong"
or rely on some other profession
for help.
"If a lawyer established in the
shopping center similar to H&R
Block in taxes is permitted to
advertise that you can see him for
$5 a visit that might well be away
to get people to use lawyers who
need to now but do not."
