# ASSU Panel Proposes Student Half-Time Option
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
An ASSU task force has
recommended that, the University
establish a half-time status option for
undergraduates over age 25.
The Task Force on Half-Time
Status, in its 17-page report, claims the
University "lacks an important
element of diversity because the great
majority of undergraduates are
between the ages of 17 and 22."
The report requests that the
University analyze the financial
feasibility of such an option by Dec.
31 so that a program could begin next
fall.
The task force, which included
senior Joan Ford, Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Michael
Closson and former ASSU Vice
President Beth Garfield, concluded
that "the existence of a half-time
study option at Stanford would appeal
to a large number of people, many of
whom could not participate in a
full-time program."
In addition to providing advantages
for potential older students, the report
asserts that the half-time status option
(for a limited number of undergrads)
would benefit the University as a
whole by allowing more interaction
between different age groups, and by
allowing a different perspective in
undergraduate classes.
Ford, herself a former student at
Smith College and a returning
undergraduate after 20 years, said, "I
know quite a few people who say they
would be interested" in a half-time
option for older students.
As part of her work on the task
force, Ford handled correspondence
with several private colleges across the
country to gather evidence for the
report. Schools with part-time options
mentioned in the proposal are Brown,
Cornell, Sarah Lawrence, Smith, USC,
Vassar and Wellesley.
The number of students
participating in the part-time programs
at the different schools varied from
over 1000 at USC to a handful at
Smith. The Stanford proposal suggests
an increase of 25 to 100 half-time
enrollees over a four-year period.
Since most persons interested in the
half-time option would reside within
commuting distance, the "mere
existence" of the option would
demonstrate increased responsiveness
to the community, according to the
report.
Early administration response to
the proposal has been mixed.
Registrar Sally Mahoney called the
half-time option a "sensible
approach," as opposed to an option

which would allow older undergrads to
take only one class.
According to Mahoney, the
half-time option for undergrads is not
an entirely new idea. Some
undergraduates currently can enroll at
less than full time, including members
of the ASSU Council of Presidents,
one or two appointed ASSU officers
and the editor or managing editor of
the Daily.
Mahoney called the request for a
cost analysis "quite reasonable," but
added that some parts of the report
are "matters of speculation." She cited
such examples as the report's assertion
that the option would affect the
quality of the transfer applicant pool
and the question of special services for
older undergrads.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost
for budget and planning, deemed
much of the report "iffy and
speculative."
"Any 'special' students always cost
more," he said, adding that if such
part-time students were to enroll, they
would have to be in addition to the
current student body. This, he
explained, would expand the
undergraduate population without
expanding services to the undergrads
already present.

UNWANTED VISITORS If not for football players like these, it would have been a glorious weekend on the Farm. But lofty expectations quickly dissolved into
wilted roses Saturday afternoon, as the Cardinals were outplayed, outcoached and simply outclassed by the USC Trojans. (See page 6)
