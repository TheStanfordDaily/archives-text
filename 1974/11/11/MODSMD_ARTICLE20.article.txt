# Graduates Praise Faculty Guidance

The first three students to win
master's degrees in electrical
engineering under a special
program for minority workers
who don't have the prerequisite
college training expressed
gratitude to faculty, friends and
tutors at the University who
helped them make it.
"When I first started things got
really bad," said one of the
students, M.A. "Chuck" Chacon,
40. "I got a divorce, the world fell
apart and I wanted to give up. But
the professors were there, one
with a shoulder to cry on, the
other to pick me up it was
impossible to fall down with such
people to hold onto."
Another student who received
help, Jose Luis Sanchez, 25,
agreed. "In the beginning, when
you don't know anything, that's
when you need help," he said.
"The professors gave it."
"People have inherent abilities
to achieve goals if the
opportunities are there," said
Harry Portwood, 38, the third
student. "When problems arise
while striving for these goals,

someone has to be willing to help.
I feel my case is a good example
of this."
Known by some as the
"Gibbons Plan" after Electrical
Engineering Prof. James Gibbons,
who first organized it, the
program has allowed Sanchez,
Chacon and Portwood to achieve
M.S. degrees after six years of
part-time study here.
All three graduates continued
their regular jobs while
participating in the program.
Sanchez and Chacon were
helped after graduation by the
Chicano Society of Engineers and
Scientists, which introduced them
to executives at IBM's San Jose
plant. Both later received jobs at
IBM.
Portwood, who has worked as
a part-time technician at Ames
Research Center, said he plans to
reapply to the Graduate School of
Business someday.
Portwood, who quit school
after ninth grade in St. Louis,
later joined the Air Force. He
retired from the service last year
as an instrument technician with
the rank of technical sergeant.
He finished high school by
correspondence while in the
service and then took courses at
Foothill College and Stanford.
Portwood said he received
specific help from Gibbons and
Assoc. Electrical Engineering Prof.
Louis Padulo, present director of
the program, who helped him to
acquire a half-time fellowship
here.
Chacon has worked at several
different electronic jobs, the last
one at Stanford for Electrical
Engineering Prof. J. Richard
Pantell and a former research
associate, Dr. Harold Puthoff.
"They urged me to go for an
advanced degree in the program
and took time out to help me,"
said Chacon. "Then, when I
thought I just couldn't go on,
[Math] Prof. [Mary] Sunseri and
Prof. Gibbons put me back on my
feet." i
