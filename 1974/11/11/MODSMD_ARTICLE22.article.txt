## USC's Superb Play Overwhelms Cards 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
It's hard to look back 48 hours
and remember that all the talk
was of Stanford playing in a Rose
Bowl.
The optimistic banter seems
like a cruel hoax Cardinal players
and fans perpetrated on
themselves.
For Stanford never had a
chance.
USC outhit, outexecuted and
outcoached Stanford 34-10
Saturday, and the score could
have been worse if John McKay
had wanted to rub it in. True,
Stanford could have done some
things better, but it would have
taken one of the best games of
college football ever played to
have . beaten the seemingly
invincible Trojans.
Coach Jack Christiansen called
USC's performance "one of the
finest college games defensively
and offensively I've seen a team
play."
And linebacker Forrie Martin,
crushed by the outcome, called
USC the "best damn football
team I've ever played against. I'm
proud to have them representing
the Pacific Eight in the Rose
Bowl."
Best Team
While USC still must get by
UCLA to ensure a trip to
Pasadena, few in the huge crowd
of 83,500 at Stanford Stadium
could doubt they had seen the
best team on the West Coast.
On both offense and defense, it
was the same story. USC had
Stanford scouted perfectly. The
Trojans knew exactly what to do,
and their ability to read the
Cardinals was almost uncanny.
Wide receiver Eric Test said
that the Trojan, defensive backs
"anticipated where we were going.
It seems like every time we had an
'out' on, he [Trojan, roverback
Charles Phillips] was playing
outside. Every time we had a
'curl' on, he was playing inside. I
don't know how he did it."
Perfect first half coverage by
the USC defensive backs kept
Stanford from scoring a
touchdown. Things began looking
bleak for Stanford the moment
cornerback Danny Reece came
out of nowhere to intercept a
Mike Cordova sideline pass. Later
Reece blanketed Tony Hill on a
third-and-goal, forcing a change in
Hill's pass pattern. Cordova,
flustered, threw the ball in the
ground.
'Keep Him Contained'
By the third quarter, USC
assistant coach Dave Levy was so
confident the Trojans could
defense Stanford's aeriel game
that he yelled to his linemen, "Let
him [Cordova] throw. Let's just
keep him contained."
Christiansen removed Cordova
at the start of the fourth quarter,
exactly three quarters later than
most of the fans would have liked.
With the outcome long
decided, Guy Benjamin came in.
With second-stringers playing for
both teams, Benjamin passed to
Ted Pappas for Stanford's lone
touchdown.
Christiansen indicated that
Cordova would remain the
starting quarterback, and USC
defenders don't quarrel with the
choice.
"He's young but he's going to
get better. As far as reading
defenses, he's got a lot to learn,"
Phillips said.
And defensive tackle Gary
Jeter added that Cordova was

"pretty good," but "has to be
cooler in key situations."
No Running Game
Adding to the Cardinals'
offensive woes was the fact that
the USC down linemen refused to
allow Stanford rushers any holes
at all. Stanford's offensive line,
through little fault of theirs
except smallness, was outclassed
by the bigger Trojans, who thus
held the Cards to a meager 80
yards rushing.
With a nonexistent running
game, even Jim Plunkett couldn't
have produced the 35 points it
would have taken to defeat a
powerful offensive machine like
USC.
McKay mixed up the expected
[runs by superback Anthony
Davis] with the bizarre.
The Trojans' first two
touchdown drives were
highlighted by great play-calling.
The first drive featured bombs,
quarterback keepers, screen
passes, fullback runs, and, neatly
interspersed, Anthony Davis.
Strange Plays
The second TD drive was even
more impressive. A wingback
reverse (huh?) by Shelton Diggs
got USC to the Cardinal nine.
From there, Haden handed off to
Davis, who rolled left and flipped
to end Johnny McKay all alone in
the endzone.
This gave USC a 17-3 halftime
lead. Early in the third quarter,
any hopes of a Card comeback
were dashed.
USC ran to the left four
straight times. The four plays
gained 14, 21, 25 and 21 yards, as
Stanford defenders were blown
away by good blocks. The last
rush produced an Anthony Davis
touchdown.
After the game, McKay
mumbled something implying he
didn't want to get himself in
trouble by criticizing the right
side of Stanford's defense, and
said simply, "We thought we
could run to that side."
USC scored again in the
quarter, though it took longer this
time. After the score, two
penalties against the Cards put the
ball on the Stanford 40 for
kickoff.

The Trojans, in this spot,
recovered an onside kick,
Stanford fans booed the attempt
to pour it on, but all the kick and
subsequent field goal did were
clinch the game. McKay, showing
no desire for 2000 points, put in a
surprisingly undisciplined second
unit for the fourth quarter.
The game was over, but
Stanford never stopped trying.
Particularly impressive was a
circus catch by reserve end Jim
Jenke, who was flipped over and
temporarily knocked out by the
tackle but still held onto the
ball. Return man Ray Anderson
also bounced back after
potentially bone-breaking tackles.
Which shows that Stanford was
outclassed, but not by any means
outhustled.

Cardinal Notes: ABC comes
out the big winner by electing not
to televise the game, and having
USC on TV against UCLA and
Notre Dame later on in the
year. . . One of the few bright
spots came when Duncan McColl
tackled Anthony Davis after a
meager 14-yard kickoff return.
Davis has the best average of any
kickoff return man in college
history . . . The Pennzoil sign on
the scoreboard was changed to
"Penisoil" by some enterprising
fans.
The big crowd boosted
Stanford's average attendance this
year to just under 51,000. The
increased turnout over last season
is mainly attributed to good
weather for every
game . . . Fullback Scott Laidlaw
was knocked out of the game by a
tackle on the very first series, and
David Tenn took over as
bread-and-better man . . .
Where does Stanford go from
here. Well, according to
Christiansen, "Every team shoots
for a winning season, and in order
to get it, we'll have to win our last
two games." Test asserted, "We'll
get up for Oregon," ... History
Prof. David Kennedy, on the
sidelines while his class suffered
through a take-home midterm,
was shooed away from the drink
dispenser by an angry Stanford
player.

HUGE HOLES Plays like this one, where the entire Stanford defensive front was somehow taken out of the play, were not uncommon
Saturday. Here, it's USC wingback Shelton Diggs (26) who steps through the hole.
