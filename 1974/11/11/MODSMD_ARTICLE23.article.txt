# Bloodthirsty Stanford Students Display Even Less Sportsmanship Than McKay
## 
### GLENN GARVIN Commentary 
I've seen Stanford play home
football games 20 or so times
during the past five years.
Saturday's game with Southern
California was my last, and I can't
say I'm sorry. If that's what
Stanford football is all about,
then I don't want any.
What happened Saturday was a
disgrace; it was something the
Athletic Department, the students
and the school in general can be
wholeheartedly ashamed of. From
the moment the gates opened—4s
minutes late—till the last spectator
dejectedly trooped out six hours
later, muttering obscenities, the
whole production was strictly
bush league.
Everyone played a part. The
human cockroach John McKay
and USC's Mickey Mouse band
subtract from the calibre of any
event they attend. The Athletic
Department continued its recent
trend towards mismanagement.
But, sadly enough, most the
blame has to lie with the Stanford
crowd.
This was a crowd that wasn't
interested in football. It wanted
blood, and when it became
apparent that it wouldn't see any
on the field, the crowd looked
elsewhere. In general, Stanford's
partisans behaved exactly the way
they've always accused USC of
acting: like spoiled brats.
The Athletic Department got
things off to an ugly start by
opening the gates 45 minutes late

irritating the hell out of people
who showed up early to get good
seats and then watched latecomers
cut in front of them. When they
got inside they found entire
sections of the best seats roped
off by fraternities, with no
apparent concern on the part of
athletic security personnel who
wandered by disinterestedly.
Nor did the Athletic
Department equally enforce its
new rule against ice chests; some
people were allowed to take them
inside, others weren't. In general
it seemed things were being run
by the Keystone Kops.
Negative Crowd
The huge crowd was negative
from the very beginning. It made
no bones about it: these people
came to see someone stomp hell
out of Southern Cal and they
wouldn't stand for anything less.
This was more than a college
rivalry; it was pure and simple
hatred. The oppressive
atmosphere of utter loathing
settled over the stadium like Los
Angeles smog.
First the crowd tried venting
some of its anger on the Southern
Cal band with water balloons, a
long-standing tradition. But when
the Trojans goose-stepped out of
range, the water balloons kept
coming at the cheerleaders, the
Stanford band, the first five or six
rows of the student section.
The Stanford band, appalled
by the treatment it was taking
from its own fans, responded with
obscenities, and the crowd

escalated to oranges, ice and
anything else that would reach the
field.
Then the Axe Commission
foolishly tried to foist off an
ill-planned card stunt on the
crowd. The most elaborately
prepared card tricks are a tenuous
business with the Stanford rooting
section even on a good day; these
never stood a chance.
In The Air
The cards were in the air
before the first stunt was halfway
over; they stayed there for a good
10 minutes. People flung them
with malicious glee; Stanford was
behind 17-3, and someone had to
pay. It might as well be another
student.
People shoved each other,
screamed at anyone in their way.
They sadistically spilled beer on
those in front of them and threw
ice at random. They booed Mike
Cordova after the first series of
downs, before he had a chance to
do anything. They screamed
nonsense about Jack
Christiansen's coaching skill when
the score was 7-0.
Stanford fans have never been
overly patient. They frequently
booed Don Bunce as he
quarterbacked the team to the
Rose Bowl. "Put in Boryla!" was
the most often-repeated cheer in
those days. The next two years
Boryla did go in, earned
All-American recognition, and the
fans called for backup Dave
Ottmar whenever Boryla missed a
pass.
But Saturday set some sort of
all-time record. They booed
everybody long before Southern
Cal put the game away. Cheers at
past USC games have generally
been pretty clever; this time they
consisted mostly of mindless
obscenity.
Much of the credit for the ugly

mood must go to Jolly John
McKay. McKay is one of the
game's loudest whiners, and his
stupid, vindictive comments about
Stanford the last few years could
hardly be expected to encourage
friendly rivalry between the two
schools. This year he lied about
his previous statements, and
gutlessly made accusations about
John Ralston and others who have
since left Stanford.
Where were those charges when
Ralston was still coaching? Why
weren't they made when he was
here to defend himself? Why did
they suddenly surface three years
later?
Immortal McKay
Nor did McKay do anything to
mellow his image during the game.
With a 31-3 lead he called for an
on-side kick; with a 34-3 lead he
sent in a five-man rush on a
Stanford punt. You're a fine man,
John McKay, one of the game's
immortals.
But all that is really an aside.
As Jack Christiansen once said in
response to some of McKay's
ranting, "It doesn't pay to get
into a urinating contest with a
skink."
That's exactly what happened
Saturday. What went on inside the
stadium embodied the absolute
worst of college football.
Stanford, by adopting tactics and
behavior commonly associated
with USC, proved that all the talk
about differences in what the two
schools represent is a myth. The
student body and the fans in
general acted like a bunch of
bitter punks.
If this is what the
Stanford-USC game will continue
to produce, then better to cancel
it. On Saturday, all the lousiest
instincts of the two schools were
on display, a picture best left
unrepeated.

PRIMARY TARGETS Ridiculous looking Trojan bandsmen were
the targets of Stanford fans' water balloons and verbal tirades. The
question is: Was the abuse as bush league as what was abused?
