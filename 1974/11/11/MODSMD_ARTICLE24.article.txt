# Card Fans Show Class
## 
### TIM FERGUSON Commentary 
As John McKay hustled his way up the ramp
and out of Stanford Stadium after beating the
Cardinals 34-10 Saturday, one drunken fan with a
hateful look on his face snarled, "Hey McKay, you
know what you said about Stanford fans? Well,
you're right."
The sot probably didn't realize what he was
saying. Fortunately, for McKay and'for Stanford,
he was wrong.
On a day when USC showed its class on the
football field, Stanford went a long way toward
making amends for its rude behavior toward the
Trojans two years ago.
And doing so wasn't easy. The distaste for USC
which prompted the 1972 outburst remains as
strong as ever. As Don Bunce, who quarterbacked
Stanford to its last win over the Trojans three years
ago, said Saturday, "I used to dislike SC. Now I
hate 'em."
A few of the inexcusable acts were repeated. As
the Trojan bandsmen stood with their backs to the
Stanford student section waiting to march onto the
field, they were the targets of numerous water
balloons. Definitely an act requiring extreme
adroitness like throwing a rock at a barn.
Reminiscent of a year ago in the Coliseum when
Stanford fans threw beer cans at Tommy Trojan
and his horse.
Only Two
But only two fanatics saw fit to taunt McKay qn
his trip to the dressing room the wit mentioned
earlier and one who said "Hey Johnny, nice onside
kick!" in reference to such a play in the third
quarter with USC ahead, 31-3.
He obviously had forgotten how many times
Stanford had relaxed with a comfortable lead only

to lose in the fourth quarter, and how McKay had
replaced virtually his entire first team early in the
final period.
Aside from those two indignities, McKay had a
pretty comfortable strqll along the quarter-mile
stretch. Straddled along the entire route by
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen in an obvious
attempt to lend a psychological barrier against
abuse, McKay heard more shouts of "nice game
coach" than any other.
Two hears ago McKay was quoted as saying, "I
don't like anything about Stanford. I don't like
their players or their fans. But this time, he said his
treatment by Stanford had been "excellent."
Goux Impressed
McKay's firebrand assistant, Marv Goux, even
had praise for Stanford. "Yes, they showed class,"
said the tough little ex-linebacker. "Everyone was
very polite."
Goux wouldn't even condemn the post-game
hysterics of 1972. "Two great private universities
should have a great rivalry, and the crowd ... that's
part of it. We should get after each other's ass."
Stanford players refused to echo Charles
McCloud's "SC ain't shit" vitriol of 1972, although
all remarks weren't congratulatory.
"USC's coaches have simply got to grow up,"
Forrie Martin said in reference to the onside kick.
"They're not as good as the score indicated,"
Gordy Riegel added.
But most of the Cardinals were silent, following
Riegel's line, "Not much you can say when you
lose."
In not saying much, the 1974 Cardinals said a
lot about themselves. So did the large majority of
Stanford fans. And so, with his par excellance
coaching performance and unusually kind remarks
afterward, did John McKay.
