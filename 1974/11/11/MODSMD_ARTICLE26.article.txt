# Edge USC, 7-5
## Poloists Assure NCAA Spot 
### BOB KUSTEL 
Stanford's water polo team
moved one step closer to a
still-distant NCAA Championship
with two vital weekend wins,
beating UC-Davis Friday and USC
in overtime Saturday.
Although many imposing
obstacles stand between the Cards
and the championship, the two
victories virtually assure Stanford
of an invitation to the NCAA
tournament Nov. 22-3 in Long
Beach.
Seven other teams will be vying
for the coveted crown, with
champion California considered
the favorite. UCLA, co-champion
of the Pac-8 by virtue of its
stunning upset over Cal last week,
is also a team to be reckoned
with. Throw in a powerhouse like
UC-Irvine, and one has the best
teams in the country assembled
for the tourney.
What about Stanford? It is a
young team, yet, after strong
showings the past two weeks, the
Cards indeed seem capable of
fcompeting with more experienced
teams. "We could surprise a lot of
people," says coach Art Lambert,

the man who has revitalized the
water polo program at Stanford
since his arrival last May.
Indeed the Cardinals may. A
win over UCLA, victors over
Stanford in two squeakers this
year, is certainly feasible. Cal?
"Suppose they are capable of
beating us eight out of 10 times,"
points out Lambert, "who's to say
when or where one of those wins
will be?"
A shot at the crown was made
possible by two clutch victories
this weekend.
After disposing of a
surprisingly stubborn UC-Davis
team 5-3 on Friday, the Cards
pulled out a 7-5 overtime win over
the USC Trojans on Saturday
morning.
Sophomore Paul Clark fired in
the winning goal with 1:30 left in
the second overtime, and Rick
Johannsen provided the clincher
one minute later as the Cards
methodically broke a desperate
Trojan press.
Stan Johnson and Drew
McDonald, the Orinda pair, each
tallied twice, while John Paul
Roberts' first quarter goal

rounded out the scoring.
The game, incidentally, was
played in the large pool, and
although the 200 fans may have
been somewhat uncomfortable as
they stood around the pool, no
one was more uncomfortable than
the Trojan players in the water.
The well-conditioned Cards
simply outswam their southland
foes. It was more than
coincidental that the last three
goals of the game were scored by
Stanford.
But despite the lack of stands,
the fans seemed to enjoy the
occasion. The Athletic
Department charged until
halftime, but many early-arriving
football tailgaters watched the
second half for nothing.
USC fans present bitterly
chastised the officiating, but the
reason for the many calls against
the Trojans in the late stages of
the game was fatigue.
Stanford closes out its regular
season this week as the team
heads for Berkeley. Both teams
will no doubt be seeking an edge
in anticipation of the NCAA
Tournament.

although the 200 fans may have
been somewhat uncomfortable as
they stood around the pool, no
one was more uncomfortable than
the Trojan players in the water.
The well-conditioned Cards
simply outswam their southland
foes. It was more than
coincidental that the last three
goals of the game were scored by
Stanford.
But despite the lack of stands,
the fans seemed to enjoy the
occasion. The Athletic
Department charged until
halftime, but many early-arriving
football tailgaters watched the
second half for nothing.
USC fans present bitterly
chastised the officiating, but the
reason for the many calls against
the Trojans in the late stages of
the game was fatigue.
Stanford closes out its regular
season this week as the team
heads for Berkeley. Both teams
will no doubt be seeking an edge
in anticipation of the NCAA
Tournament.
Stanford's water polo team
moved one step closer to a
still-distant NCAA Championship
with two vital weekend wins,
beating UC-Davis Friday and USC
in overtime Saturday.
Although many imposing
obstacles stand between the Cards
and the championship, the two
victories virtually assure Stanford
of an invitation to the NCAA
tournament Nov. 22-3 in Long
Beach.
Seven other teams will be vying
for the coveted crown, with
champion California considered
the favorite. UCLA, co-champion
of the Pac-8 by virtue of its
stunning upset over Cal last week,
is also a team to be reckoned
with. Throw in a powerhouse like
UC-Irvine, and one has the best
teams in the country assembled
for the tourney.
What about Stanford? It is a
young team, yet, after strong
showings the past two weeks, the
Cards indeed seem capable of
fcompeting with more experienced
teams. "We could surprise a lot of
people," says coach Art Lambert,

the man who has revitalized the
water polo program at Stanford
since his arrival last May.
Indeed the Cardinals may. A
win over UCLA, victors over
Stanford in two squeakers this
year, is certainly feasible. Cal?
"Suppose they are capable of
beating us eight out of 10 times,"
points out Lambert, "who's to say
when or where one of those wins
will be?"
A shot at the crown was made
possible by two clutch victories
this weekend.
After disposing of a
surprisingly stubborn UC-Davis
team 5-3 on Friday, the Cards
pulled out a 7-5 overtime win over
the USC Trojans on Saturday
morning.
Sophomore Paul Clark fired in
the winning goal with 1:30 left in
the second overtime, and Rick
Johannsen provided the clincher
one minute later as the Cards
methodically broke a desperate
Trojan press.
Stan Johnson and Drew
McDonald, the Orinda pair, each
tallied twice, while John Paul
Roberts' first quarter goal

rounded out the scoring.
The game, incidentally, was
played in the large pool, and
although the 200 fans may have
been somewhat uncomfortable as
they stood around the pool, no
one was more uncomfortable than
the Trojan players in the water.
