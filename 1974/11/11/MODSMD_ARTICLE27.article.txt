# Rose Bowl Roundup
## Race Simplified On Coast, Clouded In Midwest 
### MARK FUNK 
In a week highlighted by triumph but
marred by tragic death, one race for the
Roses was cleared up while another turned
suddenly to confusion.
After a convincing 34-10 thumping of
Stanford, USC finds itself the odds-on
favorite to be the Pacific Eight
standard-bearer in the Rose Bowl Jan. 1.
Now only injury-ridden UCLA realistically
stands in the Trojans' path as they seek their
seventh Rose Bowl bid in nine years. All USC
needs is a victory and a tie in the next two
weeks against Washington (2-3), and UCLA
(3-1-1).
UCLA nursed its hopes for an extended
season by upending hapless Oregon 21-0.
Big Game
If the Bruins beat Oregon State at
Corvallis next Saturday and USC gets past
Washington, the winner of the championship
of Los Angeles will spend New Year's Day in
Pasadena.
"We're not even thinking about USC,"
Bruin head man Dick Vermeil insisted after
the rout. "There is no way we will be looking
beyond Oregon State. We're not good enough
to overlook any opponent and expect to
win."
Bruin quarterback Jeff Dankworth, pulled
from the second team when John Sciarra
broke his ankle, got high marks in his first
start, running for two touchdowns and

setting up another.
Up in Seattle, where people have been
openly discussing the Rose Bowl since last
week's rout of UCLA, California brought
Washington fans back to reality with a 52-26
win.
Steve Bartkowski hurled touchdown
passes of 56 and 43 yards as he set a school
record for single-game total offense with 309
yards. Howard Strickland scored three times,
including one 68-yard run.
In the only Pac-8 contest without any
bearing on the Rose Bowl, Oregon State
topped Washington State 17-3 in the Palouse.
The Big 10, which has been marching to
the beat of Ohio State in recent years, had a
monkey wrench thrown into its Rose Bowl
race when lightly regarded Michigan State
stunned the Buckeyes 16-13 before a
nationwide television audience.
The very fact that the Spartans won was
not even official until one hour after the
game ended.
The play that sent Buckeye supporters
into mourning was an 88-yard scoring
scamper to fullback Levi Jackson with 3:17
left, sending Michigan State partisans (not to
mention fans in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
Birmingham, Ala., and Norman, Okla.) into a
state of frenzy.
Witl 3:11 remaining however, OSU took
the ensuing kickoff and drove 70 yards to the
Michigan State one before time ran out.

Buckeye fullback Champ Henson dived into
the end zone with what looked like a winning
touchdown, but five out of six officials
maintained that the play began after time
had expired. They were supported by Big 10
commissioner Wayne Duke.
Woody Hayes, his usual good-natured self
after the game, struck one fan before leaving
the field and officially protested the outcome
of the contest. <•
In Champaign, the Illini were mourning
another, more important loss.
In the Illinois dressing room after
suffering a 14-6 defeat at the hands of
Michigan, emotion-choked Bob Blackman
said, "I never realized how unimportant a
football game could be."
Blackman was referring to the fatal
shooting of star end Greg Williams in a
fraternity house scuffle Friday night. "After
learning of the situation, every guy was just
sick at heart and early in the game we played
that way," he said.
As for Michigan, the win left the
Wolverines alone atop the Big 10 with "only"
Ohio State standing between them and a Rose
Bowl berth.
Word from the Midwest says that if the
Buckeyes are to repeat as the conference's
bowl representatives, they will have to defeat
the Wolverines convincingly during their Nov.
23 meeting in Columbus.

"We're not even thinking about USC,"
Bruin head man Dick Vermeil insisted after
the rout. "There is no way we will be looking
beyond Oregon State. We're not good enough
to overlook any opponent and expect to
win."
Bruin quarterback Jeff Dankworth, pulled
from the second team when John Sciarra
broke his ankle, got high marks in his first
start, running for two touchdowns and

setting up another.
Up in Seattle, where people have been
openly discussing the Rose Bowl since last
week's rout of UCLA, California brought
Washington fans back to reality with a 52-26
win.
Steve Bartkowski hurled touchdown
passes of 56 and 43 yards as he set a school
record for single-game total offense with 309
yards. Howard Strickland scored three times,
including one 68-yard run.
In the only Pac-8 contest without any
bearing on the Rose Bowl, Oregon State
topped Washington State 17-3 in the Palouse.
The Big 10, which has been marching to
the beat of Ohio State in recent years, had a
monkey wrench thrown into its Rose Bowl
race when lightly regarded Michigan State
stunned the Buckeyes 16-13 before a
nationwide television audience.
The very fact that the Spartans won was
not even official until one hour after the
game ended.
The play that sent Buckeye supporters
into mourning was an 88-yard scoring
scamper to fullback Levi Jackson with 3:17
left, sending Michigan State partisans (not to
mention fans in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
Birmingham, Ala., and Norman, Okla.) into a
state of frenzy.
Witl 3:11 remaining however, OSU took
the ensuing kickoff and drove 70 yards to the
Michigan State one before time ran out.

Buckeye fullback Champ Henson dived into
the end zone with what looked like a winning
touchdown, but five out of six officials
maintained that the play began after time
had expired. They were supported by Big 10
commissioner Wayne Duke.
Woody Hayes, his usual good-natured self
after the game, struck one fan before leaving
the field and officially protested the outcome
of the contest. <•
In Champaign, the Illini were mourning
another, more important loss.
In the Illinois dressing room after
suffering a 14-6 defeat at the hands of
Michigan, emotion-choked Bob Blackman
said, "I never realized how unimportant a
football game could be."
Blackman was referring to the fatal
shooting of star end Greg Williams in a
fraternity house scuffle Friday night. "After
learning of the situation, every guy was just
sick at heart and early in the game we played
that way," he said.
As for Michigan, the win left the
Wolverines alone atop the Big 10 with "only"
Ohio State standing between them and a Rose
Bowl berth.
Word from the Midwest says that if the
Buckeyes are to repeat as the conference's
bowl representatives, they will have to defeat
the Wolverines convincingly during their Nov.
23 meeting in Columbus.
In a week highlighted by triumph but
marred by tragic death, one race for the
Roses was cleared up while another turned
suddenly to confusion.
After a convincing 34-10 thumping of
Stanford, USC finds itself the odds-on
favorite to be the Pacific Eight
standard-bearer in the Rose Bowl Jan. 1.
Now only injury-ridden UCLA realistically
stands in the Trojans' path as they seek their
seventh Rose Bowl bid in nine years. All USC
needs is a victory and a tie in the next two
weeks against Washington (2-3), and UCLA
(3-1-1).
UCLA nursed its hopes for an extended
season by upending hapless Oregon 21-0.
