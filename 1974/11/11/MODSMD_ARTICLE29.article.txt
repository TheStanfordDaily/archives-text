Football
DALLAS Calvin Hill bruised his
way six yards through a tiring San
Francisco defense late in the fourth
quarter yesterday for a Dallas
touchdown to keep the Cowboys' NFL
playoff hopes alive with a 20-14
victory.
It was the fourth consecutive
victory for the Cowboys and gave them
a 5-4 record in the National
Conference East Division.
San Francisco rookie quarterback
Tom Owen ignited the 49ers to a 14-13
lead early in the fourth period with a
12-yard touchdown pass to Gene
Washington.
Owen replaced Norm Snead, who
started his first game since being traded
to the 49ers from the New York
Giants. Snead reinjured a gimpy knee
and sat out the second half.
OAKLAND Quarterback Ken
Stabler hit wide receiver Cliff Branch
with touchdown passes of 36 and 15
yards and fullback Marv Hubbard

roared for two other scores as the
Oakland Raiders crushed the Detroit
Lions 35-13.
Stabler hit Branch in the end zone
with a 15-yard toss in the second
period and arched his 36-yard scoring
pass to the AFC's leading receiver in
the third period. The catches were
Branch's seventh and eighth of the
season.
Stabler, who mixed Hubbard's
bruising running with a pinpoint
passing game, hit on 20 of 24 attempts
for 248 yards in leading the Raiders to
their eighth straight victory before be
was relieved by backup quarterback
Larry Lawrence in the last period.
