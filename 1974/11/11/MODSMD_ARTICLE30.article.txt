# Booters Beat UOP, Finally Defy Illogic
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Stanford soccer has been
pretty illogical this season, so it
would be logically illogical
(illogically logical?) to assume
that the Cardinals might beat
someone they were supposed to
beat.
Nonetheless, the Cardinals did
beat someone they were supposed
to beat Friday at Stockton.
Utilizing a stiff defense and a ball
control game, they blanked the
University of the Pacific, 1-0.
"We controlled the game,"
head coach Fred Priddle
explained, "Even though the score
was close we were pretty much on
top of things. Our passing was
sharp, and overall we just played
something more like what we are
capable of playing."
The lone score of the match
came 20 minutes into the second
period. Fullback Jim Stokes
passed up the left side to Phil
Wright, and Wright put a shot in
the Pacific net from about 15
yards out.
Stanford's offense continued
its recent trend of many shots and
few scores; the Cards took 25

shots on goal. Pacific had but 16
shots, and Card goalie Bruce
Mosbacher netted eight saves.
Priddle said that Pacific was a
little tougher than he had
anticipated. "They were a hard,
physical team," he said, adding,
"we always seem to get the hard,
physical teams." But Priddle said
that no one was injured, and "the
refereeing was quite good for a
change. We were even outfouled."
Priddle singled out Mac Taylor
and freshman Dave Cannon,
whom he said "played very well"
in his first extended appearance of
the season.
"Generally, we got things
tightened up," said Priddle,
referring to sloppy (no pun
intended) play against Hayward.
"It was a good warmup for the
Pac-8 tournament."
The booters play Menlo
College, a team they defeated
earlier this year, on Wednesday,
and are home again Friday to
meet Washington in the first game
of the Pac-8 (Stanford
Invitational) tournament. Priddle
says he expects a "scrappy game"
from Menlo.

offensive weapon for Stanford this season. Wright scored the lone goal
in the Cardinals' 1-0 triumph over UOP Friday.
