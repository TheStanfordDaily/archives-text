Coal Miners Prepare To Strike
WASHINGTON Negotiators continued efforts
yesterday to resolve the remaining knotty issues blocking a
contract settlement between the coal industry and the
United Mine Workers (UMW) union as the nation prepared
for at least a two-week strike.
The present contract expires at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow
and ratification of a new pact would require about 10 days.
A strike is assured because of the UMW tradition of "no
contract, no work."
In the coal mining country, few of the companies called
miners to work yesterday, after a flurry of activity
Saturday, apparently in an attempt to build up coal
supplies. (
The companies are not expected to call in crews today,
which is Veterans' Day holiday for the miners.
Railroads which carry coal are expected to be hit early
by a strike. The Penn Central Railroad has said it will
probably lay off 1,500 workers now and more later if the
strike goes beyond a week.
However, both sides in the contract negotiations
indicated a settlement was within reach.
An industry source said the main hurdle was the union's
insistence on the right to strike over grievances.
"Everything else is negotiable," the source said.
UJS. Signs Wheat Pact With Egypt
TEL AVIV, Israel Israels rioted against their
government's new austerity progtem yesterday, the United
States signed a big wheat deal with Egypt and three Arab
oil ministers symbolically lowered their prices.
The rioters, from a slum quarter in Tel Aviv, blocked
streets, stoned buses and cars and chanted slogans, but
police dispersed them.
At the same time, Israeli unions planned wildcat strikes
and housewives jammed supermarkets for a last-minute
buying spree.
The austerity measures were the most severe in Israeli
history and included a 43 percent devaluation of its
currency and a six-month ban on importing cars and luxury
items.
Meanwhile, in Cairo, Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz
signed a 200,000-ton wheat pact for the last three months
of 1974, supplementing an agreement for 100,000 tons
reached earlier.
He said the total value of the two accords was $56.2
million. He said the agreertient signed yesterday was for
$38.7 million, all the previous accord, worked out in June,
was for $17.5 million.
In Abu Dhabi, three of the Persian Gulf's six main
oil-producing states lowered their prices in an attempt to
slash what they called the "excessive profits" of major
foreign oil companies and pass the saving on to the
consumer.
But the other three gulf producers rebelled against the
Saudi Arabian initiative to cut oil prices 3V& percent while

increasing taxes and royalties imposed on foreign
concessionaires who deal in Middle East oil.
The split decision raised doubts about the effectiveness
of the price cuts.
Court To Review Damaging Tape
WASHINGTON - The tape that broke Richard M.
Nixon's grip on the presidency leads off the fifth week of
testimony at the Watergate coverup trial.
The prosecutors plan to begin playing a series of tapes
this week starting with a June 23, 1972, conversation
between Nixon and H. R. Haldeman, then White House
staff chief.
Nixon released a transcript of the June 23 tape last Aug.
5 and acknowledged it "may further damage my case."
Before the week ended he had resigned.
During that June 23 conversation, six days after the
Watergate break-in, Nixon approved a suggestion that the
Central Intelligence Agency be used to try to get the FBI to
limit its investigation.
"They Should call the FBI in and (Unintelligible) don't
go any further into this case, period," Nixon was quoted on
the transcript.
In his statement put out with the transcript, Nixon
acknowledged that "I was aware of the advantages this
course of action would have with respect to limiting
possible public exposure of involvement by persons
connected with the re-election committee."
Food Conference Lacks Funding
ROME Some progress is emerging after a week's talk
at the World Food Conference, but so far the money to
back it up is not flowing in.
The delegates already have sewn together the basic
threads of an international grain bank plan to serve the
world as a buffer against bad weather and natural disasters.
Most countries have announced readiness to join a food
information system, a type of alarm system proposed by
the Japanese to alert countries to changing crop and stock
conditions so they could make required adjustments.
Almost without exception, the delegations have paid at
least lip service to the conference's main objective to
increase food production in developing countries to make
them eventually self-sufficient.
However, what conference planners sought and have not
received so far are commitments in dollars to finance the
kind of programs to put agriculture on its feet in Asia,
Africa and Latin America.
Today's Weather
