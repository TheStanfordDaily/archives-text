# Police Deny Higher Rates
## Campus Crime Levels Off 
### VALERIE DOW 
Four murders in the campus area
during the last two years have
disrupted University Police crime
statistics. But despite the recent
Memorial Church murder and
abduction on Page Mill Road, police
contend that the University is not in
the midst of a crime wave.

The department's statistics show
that the crime rate has leveled off in
the last two years after a sharp
increase in all categories between 1968
and 1972. The exceptions to this trend
are murder and petty thefts.
University Police Chief Marvin
Herrington commented that "the
University, like any other community,
will have occassional violent crimes,
though we've had more than our share
lately."
Herrington agreed that the current
fear of being out after dark is justified.
"The Police Department has been
preaching safety for years," he said.
"The University is not as secluded as it
once was, but people forget their
vulnerability until a crime brings it to
their attention."
Rapes Down
Department statistics show that in
1971-72 there were five rapes or
attempted rapes reported, in 1972-73
there were four, in 1973-74 one and
one has been reported this year. Bike
thefts and grand theft (items worth
over $200) are down from last year, he
added.
Herrington emphasized that the
statistics reflect only the crimes
reported and not necessarily the
number committed. With no way of
knowing, he speculated that many
women, for various reasons, prefer not
to report rapes and that numerous
petty thefts occur which people don't
bother to report.
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the
University police explained that the
department is trying to over come this,
emphasizing the importance of
reporting all crimes.
Community Center
Herrington suggested that the sharp
rise in campus crime during the late

1960s reflected a change in the
University. At that time, he said, the
campus became a center for the
community with more occasions for
inviting in the public. Coed dorms and
abandonment of a 10 p.m. lock-up
have made outsiders more difficult to
spot and increased the opportunities
for crimes to be committed, he said.
The UC-Berkeley campus crime rate
has also peaked and started to level off
in the last two years, according to that
school's police. Better lighting and a"
escort svste™ are thei r most recent
security measures.
Santa Clara County as a whole
reported increases in all crime
categories in the 1968-73 period.
The most typical crimes the
University police contend with are less
violent and less publicized than the
October events.
Last year the department broke a
bike ring composed of children of

faculty.
This fall an off-campus ring stealing
University electronic office equipment
was broken. Police report both groups
had been selling the stolen goods to
get cash for drugs. More typically, a
group of juveniles was spotted cruising
Lagunita and Stern Hall last week
picking up wallets and purses.
The University Police Department
employs 57 people, including 20
unarmed Community Service Officers
doing patrol work and locking
buildings between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
and 20 armed, deputized patrolmen.
Four to five deputized officers are
always on patrol, with two men
working from a squad car.
Herrington said the department
aims its efforts at crime prevention,
but he stressed the importance of
student cooperation in identifying
crimes, reporting crimes and using
common sense precautions.

student cooperation in identifying
crimes, reporting crimes and using
common sense precautions.
Four murders in the campus area
during the last two years have
disrupted University Police crime
statistics. But despite the recent
Memorial Church murder and
abduction on Page Mill Road, police
contend that the University is not in
the midst of a crime wave.

The department's statistics show
that the crime rate has leveled off in
the last two years after a sharp
increase in all categories between 1968
and 1972. The exceptions to this trend
are murder and petty thefts.
University Police Chief Marvin
Herrington commented that "the
University, like any other community,
will have occassional violent crimes,
though we've had more than our share
lately."
Herrington agreed that the current
fear of being out after dark is justified.
"The Police Department has been
preaching safety for years," he said.
"The University is not as secluded as it
once was, but people forget their
vulnerability until a crime brings it to
their attention."
Rapes Down
Department statistics show that in
1971-72 there were five rapes or
attempted rapes reported, in 1972-73
there were four, in 1973-74 one and
one has been reported this year. Bike
thefts and grand theft (items worth
over $200) are down from last year, he
added.
Herrington emphasized that the
statistics reflect only the crimes
reported and not necessarily the
number committed. With no way of
knowing, he speculated that many
women, for various reasons, prefer not
to report rapes and that numerous
petty thefts occur which people don't
bother to report.
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the
University police explained that the
department is trying to over come this,
emphasizing the importance of
reporting all crimes.
Community Center
Herrington suggested that the sharp
rise in campus crime during the late

1960s reflected a change in the
University. At that time, he said, the
campus became a center for the
community with more occasions for
inviting in the public. Coed dorms and
abandonment of a 10 p.m. lock-up
have made outsiders more difficult to
spot and increased the opportunities
for crimes to be committed, he said.
The UC-Berkeley campus crime rate
has also peaked and started to level off
in the last two years, according to that
school's police. Better lighting and a"
escort svste™ are thei r most recent
security measures.
Santa Clara County as a whole
reported increases in all crime
categories in the 1968-73 period.
The most typical crimes the
University police contend with are less
violent and less publicized than the
October events.
Last year the department broke a
bike ring composed of children of

faculty.
This fall an off-campus ring stealing
University electronic office equipment
was broken. Police report both groups
had been selling the stolen goods to
get cash for drugs. More typically, a
group of juveniles was spotted cruising
Lagunita and Stern Hall last week
picking up wallets and purses.
The University Police Department
employs 57 people, including 20
unarmed Community Service Officers
doing patrol work and locking
buildings between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
and 20 armed, deputized patrolmen.
Four to five deputized officers are
always on patrol, with two men
working from a squad car.
Herrington said the department
aims its efforts at crime prevention,
but he stressed the importance of
student cooperation in identifying
crimes, reporting crimes and using
common sense precautions.
