# Handle Disc Sales

"The Bookstore is essentially going
to let us take over record selling on
campus," Friedman said.
Discount Prices
The Co-op plans to sell
records at least 20 to 25 cents less
than what the Bookstore now charges.
In addition to the regular discount
price, the co-op will have special sale
prices.
"Sale prices are going to be very
good. They will be 60 to 75 cents
below what the Bookstore
charges and we plan on selling one
out of every five records at the sale
price," Friedman added.
The co-op will provide improved
service by expanding the current
selection and being responsive to
student desires, he said, adding that
the co-6p will order records on a
weekly basis or as often as necessary
to fulfill student demand.

The current display will be
improved to make selection of albums
easier and quicker and increase the
volume of sales, Friedman said. "The
more records we sell, the lower the
prices will be because we're not out to
maximize the profits."
Student Operated
The co-op will be entirely student
operated at the beginning, he noted. A
salaried student manager would run
the service.
"The co-op is for the students, but
will be open to the general public,"
Mackey said.
Authors of the proposal do not see
any adverse effect on the Bookstore
for the co-op. The co-op will provide
added exposure for the Bookstore and
improved record service, they claimed.
"The co-op will bring more people
into the Bookstore," Carter said.
The Bookstore will receive $lOO
per month rent for the space. "We feel
this will match the contribution to
revenues currently produced by
records in the Bookstore," the
proposal states.
The Bookstore will also receive 10
percent of the annual net income of
the co-op. The co-op's remaining
income will be used for expansion
purposes.
Proposed Last Year
The co-op was originally
proposed by last year's Council of
Presidents who created an ad hoc
committee to look into the feasibility
of a co-op. Carter and Mackey worked
with the old committee to form a new
committee that developed the final
proposal.
Friedman said, "The Record Co-op
is a good way to get a real student
store started. We can use the co-op Lo
branch out into other things such as
tapes and audio equipment. We can
add products such as bookbags and
gift items as student demand for them
increases. Expansion is part of the long
term goal."
Mackey emphasized that the co-op
is "part of the ASSU's attempt to be
more of a student service organization."
Carter and Mackey agreed that this
year a trend has developed in the
ASSU Senate and the Council of
Presidents to provide more student
services.
