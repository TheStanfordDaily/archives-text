# Law Prof, Staff Member Chosen
## Demos Elect Charter Delegates 
### JOHN FREED 
Democrats from the 12th
Congressional District met Saturday in
Mountain View and elected three
delegates to a national conference to
be held next month.
About 185 Democrats chose
Stanford Law Prof. William Gould,
Stanford staff member Joshua
Goldstein and Palo Alto attorney
Thomas Skornia to attend a
Democratic charter conference.
Stanford sent a contingent of about
70 voters to the caucus, according to
Goldstein. Gould and Goldstein each
received more than the requisite half
of all votes cast on the first ballot.
Skornia and Chris Gray, a Stanford
undergraduate, each received about 70
votes in the first ballot to force a
runoff. Gray received just over 70
votes on the second ballot, while
Skornia polled more than 50 percent

to become the third delegate.
Goldstein remarked that all three
delegates favor affirmative action for
minority groups a plank which is
expected to emerge as a controversial
issue at the national convention Dec.
6-8 in Kansas City, Mo.
"Pretty much all the candidates
were in agreement on affirmative
action," Goldstein said. "There wasn't
a big fight."
Labor Absent
Goldstein criticized attempts by
AFL-CIO representatives to elect
delegates sympathetic to labor unions
at caucuses in San Francisco and in the
13th Congressional District.
"Apparently [AFL-CIO President
George] Meany's people decided not
to fight us here," Goldstein
commented. "I still don't like the
looks of these other caucuses,
though."

Gould, who was in Chicago over the
weekend and hence missed the
balloting, said he will seek out
opinions about the affirmative action
plank.
"At some point during the next
couple of weeks, I'll be issuing a
statement on the critical
issues ... especially the delegate
selection issue," Gould noted. "In the
meantime, I'd be glad to talk to any
Democratic voters ... people who
were at the caucus meeting" for their
opinions as well.
Unifying Force
Skornia, who finished second last
June to Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor in a four-way race for the
Democratic nQmination in the 12th
Congressional District, also favors
affirmative action. He said last week
that the December convention should
serve as a unifying force for the party.
Skornia acknowledged that the
convention would accent intra-party
divisions, but claimed that Democrats
are used to splits and often find
strength in their diversity.
Stanford undergraduates Gray and
Irma Nogales had hoped to pack
Saturday's caucus with supporters, but
couldn't muster enough votes to
become delegates.

One Stanford student who attended
the caucus session explained why
Skornia was chosen over Gray and
Nogales.
Issue Orientation
"There were a lot of people there
who admitted that the young
Democrats in the area should have a
delegate. They saw Joshua [Goldstein]
as that delegate, so they all voted for
Skornia on the second ballot," he said.
Gray and Gould each had noted
that they hope to see the Kansas City
gathering as a means of making the
Democratic Party more issue-oriented,
perhaps closer to the lines of European
political parties.
Before the caucus, Gray remarked
that if the charter to be decided next
month encourages minority and youth
participation in the 1976 delegate
selection process, Democrats will be
more likely to nominate a liberal
candidate.
