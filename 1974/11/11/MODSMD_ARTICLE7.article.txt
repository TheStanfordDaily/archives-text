Monopolies Rule
Editor:
While I am not a member of
ARC (Alliance for Radical
Change), I am sympathetic to
anyone who refuses to ignore the
obvious. Such people are rare at
Stanford personally, I find
much of the obvious hard to
stomach.
Naturally, then, I was happy to
see some of the issues ARC has
raised finally noted in the Daily
on Nov. 5, although it was a
shame that we had to wait for a
letter. However, it upsets me
when you publish siily letters like
Raymond R. White's (in the same
issue) instead of pointed
arguments, pro or con.
ARC is obviously focusing its
criticism on monopoly capitalism
how it controls the government,
the military, foreign policy and
the internal society in short,
how it controls us.
At the least Raymond's
comments are misdirected. Our
"free market" economy does not
reward "competitiveness", it
rewards profits. It is the building
and protecting of profits which
has led to monopoly capitalistic,
rule in this country.
Since monopoly capitalists
control the media and educational
institutions at all levels
conservative or liberal it is not
surprising that many people view
our economic system as
"competitive." Since ARC is not
responsible for this misnomer,
perhaps White or the Daily should
forward his letter to those who
are.

Start Complaining
Editor:
Well, we've had a rough time
the last few years, but we've got
to stop feeling sorry for ourselves
and retreating into our own little
shells. I'm tired of lethargy and
helplessness and cynicism it's
about time we rubbed feeling
back into our numbed psyches.
A current Newsweek article on
the food shortage states "... the
American public has been
battered numb by a seemingly
endless run of crises over the past
decade civil rights, Vietnam,
Watergate, inflation, energy and
now food."
Now before you turn this off
as another nostalgic call for 60s
activism or a Pollyanna
exhortation "to be involved," I
recognize that we can't do too
much to directly solve the big
problems. Despite what President
Ford thinks, one person wearing a

WIN button is not going to force
the oil sheiks to lower their prices.
But I think we can work on the
small problemsnot small in
importance, but small enough to
handle.
When was the last time you
complained? No, not grumbled,
but really constructively
complained to someone in
authority that he was doing
something wrong and should take
your suggestions for change. You
might say that the last time you
did that, you were thrown out of
the office. In that case, learn
diplomacy and be content with
minor victories.
Here at Stanford, you have
some of the best minds in the
country conveniently collected in
one place. You don't like
Transition burgers? Call up the
Food Research Institute and get
"Ph.D.'s" nutritive value. You
think you're getting ripped off by
your landlord? Call up the Law
School or the Legal Service and
get information on tenant's rights.
You say the laundry soap you're
using turns your clothes dull
brown? Call up the Chemistry
Department and find out Sudzee's
composition and then write to
, the manufacturer with an
Informed complaint.
Of course, you might say you
have no complaints. In that case, I
feel sorry for you.

Diversity Needed
Editor:
Why stop the Marines from
appearing on campus?
One reason is they would
represent a different group of
people on campus. And we don't
want variety on our campus!
Another reason: with the
Marines on campus, Stanford
would be a little less isolated. Who
wants to be a part of the world?
This University won't represent
the military if we have military
recruiting on campus. Stanford
has a gay union but our campus
doesn't represent homosexuals!
I don't support the Marines,
but I disagree with preventing any
group from representing
themselves on campus. You don't
have to join.
On coming to Stanford, I was
surprised to find that a small
percentage of students try to
isolate our community from
political philosophies they find
objectionable. Regardless of their
politics, shouldn't the Marines be
allowed to represent their case?
