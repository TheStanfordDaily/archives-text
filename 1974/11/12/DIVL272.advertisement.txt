DEAR AKADAMA MAMA,
RECIPES FOR A DEEP THIRST.
Dear Akadama Mama,
I was caught in your can't-hurt-me-and
sorry-if-you-scared-me mouse trap. And
you'll be pleased to know I wasn't hurt or
anymore scared than someone being
trapped in an elevator overnight. Barbara
Joy, the lady who caught me and a
mouse's best friend, has been making
me the drinks on the recipe card you sent
along. They sure are good and I like them
but getting along in a people world gives
me a deep thirst so please send me a
whole bunch more.

Dear Rov,
Sorry for the delay. But Vern, my friend and
goldfish, got his tank water all over your
return address. So the only way to send'you
more recipes was through this ad.
