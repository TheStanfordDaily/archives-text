# Bonfire Enthusiasm Ignites
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford's Big Game Bonfire has risen from the grave.
The Bonfire, long a symbol of Stanford-Cal rivalry, apparently
suffered a quiet death last year, when rains and
Thanksgiving-break apathy forced its cancellation for the second
year in a row.
But yesterday the Inter-Fraternity Council announced plans to
stage the annual event in the dry bed of Lake Lagunita on Nov.
22, the night before the game.
"It's on," IFC President Mike Nilsson said gleefully yesterday.
He said the IFC will hold an open meeting in the Delta Upsilon
house tonight at 7:30 for anyone interested in helping.
Donated Material
University Relations and the Athletic Department are donating
$2OO each to the IFC, and the group is trying to use as much
donated material as possible, said Melinda Howe, assistant
director of University Relations.
Howe said this Bonfire would probably be smaller than past
productions.
'They used as many as 23 telephone poles and 1500 [wooden
shipping] palettes one year," Howe said. "What they're thinking
of now is 10 poles and about half that many palettes."
Telephone poles are used to form the main structure of the
huge Bonfire. Nilsson said Plant Services has already donated 12
poles and he hopes to find eight more somewhere. "We can get by
with 12 with no problem," though, he said.
Nilsson said Pacific Telephone will install the poles in Lake
Lagunita Tuesday.
The IFC is also seeking donations of firewood and fuel oil,

used to ignite the Bonfire, he said.
If the fire itself will be smaller, Nilsson has every intention of
putting on a bigger show. He said former Stanford quarterback
Don Bunce has been asked to deliver the traditional pre-Bonfire
history of the Axe, the trophy going to the winner of the game.
And he said he hoped to fly former football coach John
Ralston up from Los Angeles, where he'll be for a pro football
game between the Rams and his Denver Broncos, for the rally.
Nilsson also said he's checking into the availability of several
former Cardinal football stars.
Participation
The Band will also appear, Nilsson said.
"This is the sort of thing we like the campus as a whole to
participate in," Nilsson said, calling for heavy attendance at
tonight's meeting. He said construction would be done by anyone
willing to help, but guarding the Bonfire from Cal pranksters will
be up to freshmen, as it traditionally has been.
And fraternities will provide the freshmen with traditional free
beer, he added.
Anti-Bonfire ecology groups forced a student referendum on
the event in spring 1972, but the vote heavily favored the
Bonfire. Nilsson said no one has yet expressed any opposition this
year.
"We are asking people to cut down on use of their cars or
something like that during the week of the game," Nilsson said.
"We're conscious of ecology efforts."
Meanwhile, the Alumni Association announced it was
canceling its Big Game Dance in San Francisco, scheduled for
Nov. 22.

donated material as possible, said Melinda Howe, assistant
director of University Relations.
Howe said this Bonfire would probably be smaller than past
productions.
'They used as many as 23 telephone poles and 1500 [wooden
shipping] palettes one year," Howe said. "What they're thinking
of now is 10 poles and about half that many palettes."
Telephone poles are used to form the main structure of the
huge Bonfire. Nilsson said Plant Services has already donated 12
poles and he hopes to find eight more somewhere. "We can get by
with 12 with no problem," though, he said.
Nilsson said Pacific Telephone will install the poles in Lake
Lagunita Tuesday.
The IFC is also seeking donations of firewood and fuel oil,

used to ignite the Bonfire, he said.
If the fire itself will be smaller, Nilsson has every intention of
putting on a bigger show. He said former Stanford quarterback
Don Bunce has been asked to deliver the traditional pre-Bonfire
history of the Axe, the trophy going to the winner of the game.
And he said he hoped to fly former football coach John
Ralston up from Los Angeles, where he'll be for a pro football
game between the Rams and his Denver Broncos, for the rally.
Nilsson also said he's checking into the availability of several
former Cardinal football stars.
Participation
The Band will also appear, Nilsson said.
"This is the sort of thing we like the campus as a whole to
participate in," Nilsson said, calling for heavy attendance at
tonight's meeting. He said construction would be done by anyone
willing to help, but guarding the Bonfire from Cal pranksters will
be up to freshmen, as it traditionally has been.
And fraternities will provide the freshmen with traditional free
beer, he added.
Anti-Bonfire ecology groups forced a student referendum on
the event in spring 1972, but the vote heavily favored the
Bonfire. Nilsson said no one has yet expressed any opposition this
year.
"We are asking people to cut down on use of their cars or
something like that during the week of the game," Nilsson said.
"We're conscious of ecology efforts."
Meanwhile, the Alumni Association announced it was
canceling its Big Game Dance in San Francisco, scheduled for
Nov. 22.

BIG BLAZE—The Big Game Bonfire, a traditional spirit-warmer until three years ago, may be back in
the middle of Lake Lagunita's dry bed this Nov. 22.
Stanford's Big Game Bonfire has risen from the grave.
The Bonfire, long a symbol of Stanford-Cal rivalry, apparently
suffered a quiet death last year, when rains and
Thanksgiving-break apathy forced its cancellation for the second
year in a row.
But yesterday the Inter-Fraternity Council announced plans to
stage the annual event in the dry bed of Lake Lagunita on Nov.
22, the night before the game.
"It's on," IFC President Mike Nilsson said gleefully yesterday.
He said the IFC will hold an open meeting in the Delta Upsilon
house tonight at 7:30 for anyone interested in helping.
Donated Material
University Relations and the Athletic Department are donating
$2OO each to the IFC, and the group is trying to use as much
donated material as possible, said Melinda Howe, assistant
director of University Relations.
Howe said this Bonfire would probably be smaller than past
productions.
