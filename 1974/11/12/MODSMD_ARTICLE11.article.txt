# Compassion--Weak Political Premise
## 
### Bill Evers 
In the Oct. 21 Daily, Rachelle Marshall
wrote in an opinion column that a certain
candidate's election would bring a "measure
of compassion" to government. Nixon
supporters have spoken of President Ford's
"compassion" in ending the suffering of
Nixon and his family through the pardon. I
am troubled by this terminology.
It seems to me that a careful
re-examination of such concepts as pity,
mercy and justice would lead one to the
conclusion that compassion is not a desirable
attribute of government officials (or of those
who see that justice is done in an anarchist
society).
Pity and sympathy are direct emotions.
Rousseau claimed in his Second Discourse
that pity was natural to primitive man. (Dr.
Samuel Johnson told Boswell, in contrast,
that pity is not natural to man, that children
and savages are always cruel, and that pity is
acquired and improved by the cultivation of
reason.)
But it is those who have been ideologically
close to Rousseau who have attempted to
mix pity and political theory. For example,
Chateaubriand, in his early work, the
Natchez, present a tribe of Sioux Indians that
is still governed by the natural pity of
Rousseau. They demonstrate this by displays
of tears at every occasion.
An excellent illustration of the way in
which pity has tended to crowd out justice in
the attitides of those whose views are like
Rousseau's can be seen in a poetic tale in
Victor Hugo's Legend of the Ages.
In Hugo's story, the Sultan Murad had his
eight brothers strangled, ordered his uncle to
be sawed in two, cut open twelve children to
find out which one had stolen an apple, and
engineered numerous further bloody
atrocities.
One day while walking past a cottage, the
Sultan saw a partly-butchered pig bleeding to

death, as the mid-day sun beat down harshly
on the wound and hundreds of flies sucked
the pig's blood..
Touched by pity, the Sultan shoves the
dying pig into the shade with his foot and
drives away the flies.
The pig appears before Allah and pleads
for the Sultan. After the Sultan dies, the
pig's plea wins a pardon for the Sultan,
despite the crowd of the Sultan's victims wfco
appear to accuse him before Allah's throne.
This tale in which an act of pity and
sensitivity outweighs gross injustice illustrates
the dangers of inserting pity into political
theory. If Allah were an earthly judge, he
should sentence Murad to punishment
proportionate to his crimes not be affected
by Murad's sensitivity.
Pity may or may not be an attribute of
human beings in the hypothetical pre-social
condition set up by Rousseau. But once men
are interacting in society, pity and sympathy
cannot properly be primary.
Adam Smith in his Theory of Moral
Sentiments and Herbert Spencer in his Social
Statics emphasize the importance of
sympathy. But both correctly separate
analytically justice (which in Smith's words
"hinders us from hurting our neighbor")
from beneficence and considerateness.
Spencer calls the former a primary and most
imperative principle, the latter a secondary
and less imperative one.
Pity and sympathy can inform mercy,
charity, and generosity. Other standards and
considerations can also inform them. One
might have a well-developed idea of who
deserves charity and what charitable acts
should accomplish.
In a societal situation, mercy, charity and
generosity are dependent in practice (and as
logical concepts) upon the assignment of
rights and entitlements. Mercy, for example,
can only be the relinquishment to somebody

else of something to which one is justly
entitled.
One needs a rationally-defensible theory of
justice in entitlements before one can say
that some case is an instance in which mercy
could be exercised.
As C.S. Lewis, the writer on theology and
ethics, notes: "Humanitarian theory wants
simply to abolish justice and substitute
mercy for it. This means that you start being
'kind' to people before you have considered
their rights. ... You have overshot the mark.
Mercy, detached from justice, grows
unmerciful....
"As there are plants which will flourish
only in mountain soil,so it appears that mercy
will flower only when it grows in the crannies
of the rock of justice: transplanted to the
marshlands of mere humanitarianism, it
becomes a man-eating weed, all the more
dangerous because it is still called by the
same name as the mountain variety."
The libertarian theory of justice rules out
the possibility of a government granting
mercy. It is indicative of the usurpations
achieved by government officials that a
President of the United States could have
pardoned Lt. William Calley. In all justice,
only his surviving victims and the relatives of
those in My Lai who did not survive should
be in a position to show mercy.
It seems to me that persons who favor
federal flood relief on egalitarian grounds, or
oppose the death penalty on pacifist grounds,
or favor the vindication of draft resisters on
the ground that conscription is slavery,
should argue for those positions directly.
They should not hide behind the
smokescreen of "compassion."
Pity, mercy and charity are private matters
properly separated from government and the
administration of justice.
