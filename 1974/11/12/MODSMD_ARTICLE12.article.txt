At the Oregon State game I
was told that no cooler over one
foot square would be allowed into
the stands. Upon complaining I
was instructed to discuss the
matter with Peter Kmetovic of the
Athletic Department. He told me
that this policy was being
enforced for the first time but
everyone had been told before
about the cooler problem. Since
my cooler was only 18 inches by
12 inches and that I, nor anyone I
know, had heard about the ban I
appealed to his better judgment.
He refused to change the rule
but did tell me where I could lock
up the cooler. Upon entering the
game I noticed several coolers as
large or larger than mine plus a
couple of kegs.
This letter is on behalf of all
who were denied or will be denied
entry of their coolers. It is
directed to the Athletic
Department whom I was told
made the decision.
They should provide answers
to the following questions. Who
made the decision to ban the
coolers and whyl
Will this be the policy at future
games?
I hope that the answers to
these questions will clear up this
issue and hopefully provide
guidelines for those who desire a
cool lunch or drink on a hot
afternoon.

As a resident of FaisanHouse,!
must respond to an article (Daily,
Nov. 6) by Patty Fels and Glenn
Garvin. In a tour of campus on
election night, the writers claimed

to have perceived little if any
interest or concern whatsoever in
the election. Basically, the article
carries many connotations which
the actual information fails to
substantiate.
I was personally insulted by
the inference that residents of
Faisan are more concerned with
practical jokes than politics. This
conclusion was based on a very
brief walk down the hallway by
the reporter. He claims "residents

looked up in polite surprise when
asked about the election." In fact
the only question asked was by a
house member wondering why
this stranger was strolling throifgh
the third floor.
The reporter took no notice of
the cluster of people around a
television in one room following
the election returns, or the
numerous people, including
myself, studying with the returns
on the radio. The article also takes

no notice of the fact that 100
percent of all those eligible to
vote in Faisan were registered and
did vote on Tuesday.
Most of the residents in Faisan
still respect elections as more than
a practical joke. In the future I
hope the Daily will take its
in-depth reporting a little farther
than a passing glance.

in-depth reporting a little farther
than a passing glance.

At the Oregon State game I
was told that no cooler over one
foot square would be allowed into
the stands. Upon complaining I
was instructed to discuss the
matter with Peter Kmetovic of the
Athletic Department. He told me
that this policy was being
enforced for the first time but
everyone had been told before
about the cooler problem. Since
my cooler was only 18 inches by
12 inches and that I, nor anyone I
know, had heard about the ban I
appealed to his better judgment.
He refused to change the rule
but did tell me where I could lock
up the cooler. Upon entering the
game I noticed several coolers as
large or larger than mine plus a
couple of kegs.
This letter is on behalf of all
who were denied or will be denied
entry of their coolers. It is
directed to the Athletic
Department whom I was told
made the decision.
They should provide answers
to the following questions. Who
made the decision to ban the
coolers and whyl
Will this be the policy at future
games?
I hope that the answers to
these questions will clear up this
issue and hopefully provide
guidelines for those who desire a
cool lunch or drink on a hot
afternoon.

As a resident of FaisanHouse,!
must respond to an article (Daily,
Nov. 6) by Patty Fels and Glenn
Garvin. In a tour of campus on
election night, the writers claimed

to have perceived little if any
interest or concern whatsoever in
the election. Basically, the article
carries many connotations which
the actual information fails to
substantiate.
I was personally insulted by
the inference that residents of
Faisan are more concerned with
practical jokes than politics. This
conclusion was based on a very
brief walk down the hallway by
the reporter. He claims "residents

looked up in polite surprise when
asked about the election." In fact
the only question asked was by a
house member wondering why
this stranger was strolling throifgh
the third floor.
The reporter took no notice of
the cluster of people around a
television in one room following
the election returns, or the
numerous people, including
myself, studying with the returns
on the radio. The article also takes

no notice of the fact that 100
percent of all those eligible to
vote in Faisan were registered and
did vote on Tuesday.
Most of the residents in Faisan
still respect elections as more than
a practical joke. In the future I
hope the Daily will take its
in-depth reporting a little farther
than a passing glance.
