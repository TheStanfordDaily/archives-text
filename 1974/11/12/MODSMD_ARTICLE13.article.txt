# Gallo, Teamsters Conspire
## 
### Penny Mann 
I was outraged to find that the Daily on Nov. 5,
chose to print an article from the Oregon
Barometer to give us "information" about the
Teamsters/United Farmworkers Union (UFW)
conflict over representation of workers in Gallo
fields.
To say, as the article did, that, "Gallo
farmworkers changed unions by choice in 1973" is
to make a mockery of the word "choice." Some
facts about how that "choice" happened need to
be filled in. Here are some facts gathered by the
staff members of the National Farmworker
Ministry:
Feb. 1 '73 UFW notified Gallo that contract
in effect since 1967 was due to expire April 18.
Mar. 22 '73 Negotiations began. Company N
refused to discuss renewal of contract after April
18 if agreement was not reached.
May 1 '73 Gallo sprayed pesticide for the first
time in years. (A violation of UFW contract.)
May 8 '73 Gallo offered UFW a contract with
seweeping changes, including elimination of
pesticide clauses, hiring hall, union security.
May 10 '73 Teamsters were welcomed to
Gallo fields in Fresno, Livingston and Snelling by
supervisors. Teamsters had information on workers'
names, phone numbers and how many in the family
worked for Gallo.
May 16 '73 Chavez sent a letter to Gallo

asking for a one year agreement or elections.
May 18 '73 Gallo sent a letter to Gallo
workers; "You are in the middle of a contest
between two unions..Chavez made a public
demand for elections.
July 7 '73 James Smith of the Teamsters
announced Gallo recognized Teamsters as barganing
agent. Strikebreakers were brought in.
July 9 '73 After one negotiating session, four
years contracts were signed by Gallo with
Teamsters.
July 10 '73 With most workers on strike and
unconsulted, James Smith of the Teamsters
announced a 158-1 vote to ratify contract.
To me these facts clearly illustrate collusion on
the part of Gallo and the Teamsters. How free is a
choice if workers who had favored the UFW were
on strike and not consulted? How free is an
election if strikebreakers are the primary ones being
asked to vote?
I would like to see the Daily choose editorials
which ask some basic questions such as: Why were
the Teamsters never interested in organizing
farmworkers before the UFW became an effective
collective body? How do growers benefit from
having contracts with the Teamsters rather than
UFW?
