# Preserve Frats
## 
### Dallas Clouatre 
Many critics of fraternities
have raised issues which have yet
to be adequately analyzed. The
first is the question of the role of
donations in the life of the
University and in its relations with
its alumni.
Frat critics are simply wrong in
suggesting that fraternity alumni
should be satisfied with having
had their breaks on their
donations. The alumnus who gives
money still loses, financially in
most cases, in comparison with
the alumnus who does not.
If the tax breaks were such an
incentive, it is hard to understand
those fraternities, Sigma Chi, for
instance, who insist on keeping
their old, taxable buildings.
Maybe their alumni just are not
very rich? When the campaign to
raise funds for Cluster I began,
one of the chief obstacles involved
was convincing the reluctant
alumni that Stanford would never
consider the type of actions
against fraternities it is now
contemplating (i.e., placing them
in the draw). That doesn't strike
me as marking donations as
merely a gravy train for donors.
Perhaps it is inconceivable to
some people that alumni could
retain an honest interest in their
fraternities?
Benign Policy
To say that it is "gratitude"
which should move the University
to continue its present benign
policy toward fraternities is to
miss the issue entirely, just as the
formulation "privilege vs.
non-privilege" is misleading. If
fraternity XYZ were to offer
$500,000 today to build housing
to be used first for its members,
and for other students should all
spaces not be filled, it is clear that
some students would be forced to
turn down needed housing despite
the fact that the housing pressure
would be reduced for everyone.
Ensconcing fraternity members
in housing built with preference
by alumni is not a reduction in
status for the rest of the student
body. All men do have the chance
to go through rush. In regards to
women, remember that sororities
folded essentially because they
lacked the support of women
students. The housing imbalance
was not initially a matter of
University policy in this respect,
and I wonder whether the
solution to this problem should
not be positive rather than
negative (i.e. build women's
houses).
Salego Plan
This is not meant to be an
exhaustive delineation of a
fraternity position; however, I feel
I should present some thoughts on
the most prominent compromise
proposal of the Salego Plan now
offered. Stanford's fraternities
have ceased to be purely social
organizations in the sense of being
organized around particular
functions. Fraternities are
communal groups and it is
important to those who join and
to those already present to know
that their choice is a self-initiated
step and that they are responsible
for the success or failure of the
chapter.
It is not simply a matter of
having everyone join the national,
or making the best of a housing
shortage, or of "we all must live
somewhere." Certainly there are
good theme houses and dorms
around, but then, one assumes
that most Stanford students are
basically decent people. The
interdependence found in a
working fraternity requires
conditions which let the members
know that they are present not
just to pass the time.
Randomly Placed People
To randomly placed people, a
fraternity means that those who
return will not necessarily be
those who add most to the
chapter. Under present conditions
the Salego compromise would
guarantee that 50 to 60 percent of
the membership would be new
each year. In a sense, the living
group would never mature. It is
also highly unlikely that a
fraternity in the draw would
retain the sort of orientation
towards future members which
many now have.
Or towards the past. Does the
fact that fraternity alumni give
more funds to the University than
any comparable group mean they
have more money? It doesn't
seem likely. How many alumni
does the average student living in
a dorm know, or have reason to
know?
I will not argue a theme for
fraternities because theme alone is
not an adequate response to the
call for equal access to University
housing. "Equal access" has a fine
ring to it, perhaps too fine a ring.
I seriously question whether it
applies in this case. There are a
variety of ways to inflict social
costs upon the community;
should we trade one for another?

merely a gravy train for donors.
Perhaps it is inconceivable to
some people that alumni could
retain an honest interest in their
fraternities?
Benign Policy
To say that it is "gratitude"
which should move the University
to continue its present benign
policy toward fraternities is to
miss the issue entirely, just as the
formulation "privilege vs.
non-privilege" is misleading. If
fraternity XYZ were to offer
$500,000 today to build housing
to be used first for its members,
and for other students should all
spaces not be filled, it is clear that
some students would be forced to
turn down needed housing despite
the fact that the housing pressure
would be reduced for everyone.
Ensconcing fraternity members
in housing built with preference
by alumni is not a reduction in
status for the rest of the student
body. All men do have the chance
to go through rush. In regards to
women, remember that sororities
folded essentially because they
lacked the support of women
students. The housing imbalance
was not initially a matter of
University policy in this respect,
and I wonder whether the
solution to this problem should
not be positive rather than
negative (i.e. build women's
houses).
Salego Plan
This is not meant to be an
exhaustive delineation of a
fraternity position; however, I feel
I should present some thoughts on
the most prominent compromise
proposal of the Salego Plan now
offered. Stanford's fraternities
have ceased to be purely social
organizations in the sense of being
organized around particular
functions. Fraternities are
communal groups and it is
important to those who join and
to those already present to know
that their choice is a self-initiated
step and that they are responsible
for the success or failure of the
chapter.
It is not simply a matter of
having everyone join the national,
or making the best of a housing
shortage, or of "we all must live
somewhere." Certainly there are
good theme houses and dorms
around, but then, one assumes
that most Stanford students are
basically decent people. The
interdependence found in a
working fraternity requires
conditions which let the members
know that they are present not
just to pass the time.
Randomly Placed People
To randomly placed people, a
fraternity means that those who
return will not necessarily be
those who add most to the
chapter. Under present conditions
the Salego compromise would
guarantee that 50 to 60 percent of
the membership would be new
each year. In a sense, the living
group would never mature. It is
also highly unlikely that a
fraternity in the draw would
retain the sort of orientation
towards future members which
many now have.
Or towards the past. Does the
fact that fraternity alumni give
more funds to the University than
any comparable group mean they
have more money? It doesn't
seem likely. How many alumni
does the average student living in
a dorm know, or have reason to
know?
I will not argue a theme for
fraternities because theme alone is
not an adequate response to the
call for equal access to University
housing. "Equal access" has a fine
ring to it, perhaps too fine a ring.
I seriously question whether it
applies in this case. There are a
variety of ways to inflict social
costs upon the community;
should we trade one for another?
(Dallas C louatre, an
undergraduate, is a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.)
Many critics of fraternities
have raised issues which have yet
to be adequately analyzed. The
first is the question of the role of
donations in the life of the
University and in its relations with
its alumni.
Frat critics are simply wrong in
suggesting that fraternity alumni
should be satisfied with having
had their breaks on their
donations. The alumnus who gives
money still loses, financially in
most cases, in comparison with
the alumnus who does not.
If the tax breaks were such an
incentive, it is hard to understand
those fraternities, Sigma Chi, for
instance, who insist on keeping
their old, taxable buildings.
Maybe their alumni just are not
very rich? When the campaign to
raise funds for Cluster I began,
one of the chief obstacles involved
was convincing the reluctant
alumni that Stanford would never
consider the type of actions
against fraternities it is now
contemplating (i.e., placing them
in the draw). That doesn't strike
me as marking donations as
merely a gravy train for donors.

lacked the support of women
students. The housing imbalance
was not initially a matter of
University policy in this respect,
and I wonder whether the
solution to this problem should
not be positive rather than
negative (i.e. build women's
houses).
Salego Plan
This is not meant to be an
exhaustive delineation of a
fraternity position; however, I feel
I should present some thoughts on
the most prominent compromise
proposal of the Salego Plan now
offered. Stanford's fraternities
have ceased to be purely social
organizations in the sense of being
organized around particular
functions. Fraternities are
communal groups and it is
important to those who join and
to those already present to know
that their choice is a self-initiated
step and that they are responsible
for the success or failure of the
chapter.
It is not simply a matter of
having everyone join the national,
or making the best of a housing
shortage, or of "we all must live
somewhere." Certainly there are
good theme houses and dorms
around, but then, one assumes
that most Stanford students are
basically decent people. The
interdependence found in a
working fraternity requires
conditions which let the members
know that they are present not
just to pass the time.
Randomly Placed People
To randomly placed people, a
fraternity means that those who
return will not necessarily be
those who add most to the
chapter. Under present conditions
the Salego compromise would
guarantee that 50 to 60 percent of
the membership would be new
each year. In a sense, the living
group would never mature. It is
also highly unlikely that a
fraternity in the draw would
retain the sort of orientation
towards future members which
many now have.
Or towards the past. Does the
fact that fraternity alumni give
more funds to the University than
any comparable group mean they
have more money? It doesn't
seem likely. How many alumni
does the average student living in
a dorm know, or have reason to
know?
I will not argue a theme for
fraternities because theme alone is
not an adequate response to the
call for equal access to University
housing. "Equal access" has a fine
ring to it, perhaps too fine a ring.
I seriously question whether it
applies in this case. There are a
variety of ways to inflict social
costs upon the community;
should we trade one for another?
