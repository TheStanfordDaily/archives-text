## Researchers Brave Antarctic Winter 
### JEFF HALL 
Perhaps you've considered
spending a couple of quarters
overseas, playing croquet at
Cliveden, or maybe drinking beer
at the Oktoberfest while attending
Stanford-in-Germany. Springtime
and the fine wines of France draw
many to study over in Tours, and
they say that the villa in Italy is
out of this world.
But there is one Stanford
program overseas you've probably
never considered, and never will
Siple Station, located on top of
approximately 6,000 feet of snow
way down in Antarctica.
Bill Trabucco, a Stanford
engineer, considered it and stayed
for over a year. "It's really not
too cold," he says.
During the summer, which is
our winter, the temperature
usually stays within zero to 25
degrees Fahrenheit in other
words, Siple lies in the "banana
belt" of the Antarctic.
Inevitable Frostbite
Still, "it's impossible not to get
frostbitten down there," he
admits. The coldest temperature
recorded while Trabucco lived at
Siple Station was -52 degrees. And
with the wind chill factor,
subtract another 50.
Don Wiggin, a research
assistant who recently graduated

from Stanford, flew dowh 'ast
November to help set up a 13-m'le
long antenna which will be use I
to transmit very low frequency
radio waves through what is called
the magnetosphere.
* The magnetosphere, a region
which lies 1,000 to 20,000 miles
above the earth, has a high
concentration of particles which
react with transmitted radio
signals.
A receiving station at Roberval,
Quebec records the transmitted
signals and their reactions with
the particles. Such natural
phenomena as "whistlers" and
"chorus" are often heard.
Researchers at Stanford, led by
Prof. Robert Helliwell, are
attempting to learn more about
the nature of the interactions
between the man-made signals and
the magnetosphere.
Not Crazy
If this sounds a bit obscure, the
four-man crew on the South Pole
didn't have much time to think
about it. "We certainly didn't go
crazy," insists Trabucco. "We had
too much work to do." Besides
working on the antenna an
emergency camp had to be built,
construction on the station
performed, and food and supplies
brought in from the cold.
The crew often worked 12 to

14 hour days.
One of the problems, according
to Wiggin, was that everything was
either frozen solid or at room
temperature.
"You can't just run down to
the Round Table when you get
hungry everything has to be
thawed out first."
Believe it or not, the thing he
missed most was ice cream. While
people in the states complained
about the gas shortage, there was
a milk and fresh vegetable
shortage at Siple.
Lucious Lettuce
"I just,wanted to grab a head
of fresh lettuce and take a bite,"
claims Trabucco.
Instead he found C-Rations.
"C-Rats are pretty good if
you eat the right parts," says
Wiggin. But they had other foods
as well, and overall, he rates the
food at Siple Station as better
than that found here in the
Stanford dorms.
The U.S. Navy supplied them
with good meats, and Trabucco
was happy that the apple supply
lasted two or three months into
the winter.
To help pass the time, Siple
had a stock of 72 movies and a
projector, although "33-1/3
percent of the movies were
complete duds," notes Trabucco.

The rest were quite good.
"If you get bored, Antarctica is
a nasty place to be," observes
Wiggin. His partner agrees, saying
that a person needs a "good
attitude."
No Expectations
Both say that when they
realized that no mail would be
coming, or that there were no girls
for thousands of miles, they
didn't expect any. To think about
either was only frustrating.
"What good is it to have
pin-ups when you can't do
anything with them?" asks
Trabucco.
Wiggin didn't drink as much as
he had expected to. He took along
a supply to "keep warm at night,"
but found that his six-pound
Super Eddie Bauer down sleeping
bag usually sufficed.
The winter crew lived in
prefabricated vans which are
located under a steel arch. The
whole structure is slowly being
buried by snow. There were also
tents nearby for sleeping purposes
for the summer crew.
Poor Sleep
Sleeping can be a big problem
for those who stay in a land where
the sun might not set for months.
At times the job demands that
someone change the recording
tapes every two and a half hours.
A worker must force himself to
keep on a 24 hour schedule.
Sometimes at night when he
couldn't sleep, Wiggin would ride
around on one of the
snowmobiles. But at Siple, where
five feet of snow accumulate
every year, he made sure he
stayed in sight of the station.
The conditions during the
winter were indeed harsh, as
Trabucco quickly discovered. He
went outside one day to check up
on some faulty' equipment, and
his face and fingers froze solid. "If
I had fallen, my nose would have
cracked off," he says in all
seriousness.
Slow Thaw
It took a half hour for his face
to thaw out, and over a week to
heal. A lot of skin peeled off. By
the way, both Wiggin and
Trabucco grew beards while at
Siple, which they still wear.
"I'm in love with the
Antarctic," claims Trabucco,
currently an engineer in
Stanford's Electronics Research
Lab. "It's the most beautiful place
in the world." Sights at Siple

include a flat white horizon, and a
flat blue sky. Other than that,
there is nothing.
There are no penquins, no
seals, no walruses. However, one
bird was spotted during the
summer, a gull.
Still, "It was fantastic," says
Trabucco. It was hard for him to
get used to all the "clutter" up in
this part of the world when he
returned last February.
Wiggin is thinking about going
back to Antarctica. His last stint
was for three months, and this
time he hopes to put in for a
14-month tour of duty. Trabucco
has had enough, at least for now.
And while it appears that
Wiggin and Trabucco had the
experience of a lifetime at Siple,
"it sure was nice when we got
back to New Zealand," concludes
Wiggin.


FOREIGN CAMPUS?—Well, it's not exactly Tours, Cliveden, Florence or Beutelsbach, but believe it or
not, this frozen base is the home of a Stanford overseas program. Called Siple Station, this research area in
Antarctica provides Stanford students and professors with opportunities to investigate the icy continent
and experiment with the scientific phenomena common to the area.


FIELD TRIP—In contrast to the warm, sunny field trips of other
students enjoying a European overseas jaunt, students and faculty at
Siple Station have to face winter temperatures ranging from zero to
25 degrees Fahrenheit when they explore Antarctica.
