What are the structures along Lomita Drive called
Kingscotte Gardens and Harmony House used for?
-L.N.H.
In these days of housing shortages everyone
looks at any kind of shed on campus as a possible
accommodation for the homeless. Walking along
Lomita, naturally anyone would wonder why the
names Kingscotte and Harmony aren't included in
the University residence booklet which the Housing
Office distributes around spring draw panic time.
Harmony House with its ski-jump-gables roof is
already used as a theater and workshop for the
Committee on Black Performing Arts, according to
Asst. Humanities and Science Dean Sydney
Burkhart. The committee uses three rooms for
offices and the remaining open space for practice
and rehearsal.
While Harmony is integrated in the University
building system, Kingscotte is a privately owned
house on University land.
Kingscotte property manage? David Rollins stated
that 90 percent of the residents in the 37 low-rent
apartments are related to the University, however.
In fact, the majority of them are students, he
added. Most of the remaing occupants are retired
staff and faculty.
Land Resources Manager John Breedlove said he
and Rollins soon plan to discuss future ownership
cf the house. He added he has not considered using
the house for student housing.

How difficult is it to petition to go back into the

Draw after having voluntarily gone off campus?
-A.M.L.
Students who volunteer to go off campus lose
out when it comes time to living in University
housing once again.
In order to be fair to those students who were
forced off campus, Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton said the student volunteers must sign
wait lists for various houses to get back on campus.
Unassigned students from the year before enter the
draw.
Even fraternity members who joined a frat
because they were unassigned are eligible for the
draw, Horton elaborated.
Students who sign wait lists for the fall may get
housing by winter quarter; they have more of a
chance spring quarter, however, Horton said. He
explained that eight out of 100 students leave the
housing system for some reason in the spring.
Horton went on to say that overseas campus
students returning to Stanford enter the draw on
the same basis as the California-based students.
They retain the right to declare priorities in
housing.
Horton mentioned that the confusion of the
Italian mail once delayed the processing of the
draw. Couriers finally carried messages of student
preferences to Switzerland and then relayed them
to Stanford.

already used as a theater and workshop for the
Committee on Black Performing Arts, according to
Asst. Humanities and Science Dean Sydney
Burkhart. The committee uses three rooms for
offices and the remaining open space for practice
and rehearsal.
While Harmony is integrated in the University
building system, Kingscotte is a privately owned
house on University land.
Kingscotte property manage? David Rollins stated
that 90 percent of the residents in the 37 low-rent
apartments are related to the University, however.
In fact, the majority of them are students, he
added. Most of the remaing occupants are retired
staff and faculty.
Land Resources Manager John Breedlove said he
and Rollins soon plan to discuss future ownership
cf the house. He added he has not considered using
the house for student housing.

How difficult is it to petition to go back into the

Draw after having voluntarily gone off campus?
-A.M.L.
Students who volunteer to go off campus lose
out when it comes time to living in University
housing once again.
In order to be fair to those students who were
forced off campus, Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton said the student volunteers must sign
wait lists for various houses to get back on campus.
Unassigned students from the year before enter the
draw.
Even fraternity members who joined a frat
because they were unassigned are eligible for the
draw, Horton elaborated.
Students who sign wait lists for the fall may get
housing by winter quarter; they have more of a
chance spring quarter, however, Horton said. He
explained that eight out of 100 students leave the
housing system for some reason in the spring.
Horton went on to say that overseas campus
students returning to Stanford enter the draw on
the same basis as the California-based students.
They retain the right to declare priorities in
housing.
Horton mentioned that the confusion of the
Italian mail once delayed the processing of the
draw. Couriers finally carried messages of student
preferences to Switzerland and then relayed them
to Stanford.

What are the structures along Lomita Drive called
Kingscotte Gardens and Harmony House used for?
-L.N.H.
In these days of housing shortages everyone
looks at any kind of shed on campus as a possible
accommodation for the homeless. Walking along
Lomita, naturally anyone would wonder why the
names Kingscotte and Harmony aren't included in
the University residence booklet which the Housing
Office distributes around spring draw panic time.
Harmony House with its ski-jump-gables roof is
already used as a theater and workshop for the
Committee on Black Performing Arts, according to
Asst. Humanities and Science Dean Sydney
Burkhart. The committee uses three rooms for
offices and the remaining open space for practice
and rehearsal.
