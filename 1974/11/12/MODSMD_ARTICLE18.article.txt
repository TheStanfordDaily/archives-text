Applications for admission to the Stanford Graduate
School of Business MBA program increased by more than 25
percent during the past year, a final report on the new class
shows.
Applications rose from 2032 to 2565 for the 300 places in
the entering class. The Stanford experience compares with a
15 percent increase in business school applications nationwide.
A profile of the new class shows the students are older and
more experienced than their counterparts of a year ago.
Median age is nearly 26, compared to 25 last year.
Sixty-nine percent of the new students held full-time
jobs before coming to the Business School, as contrasted with
58 percent with work experience a year ago. Only 22 percent
already holds advanced degrees, and a total of 40 percent of
the students has done some postgraduate study.
Nearly 20 percent of the class is female, up from 18 percent
last year and from 1 percent only five years ago.
