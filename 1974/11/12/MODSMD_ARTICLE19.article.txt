## Palo Alto's New Entertainment Bargain Journey Opens Music Hall Rock Series 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
For anyone who has ever
complained about the crazed
mobs and rip-off prices that
characterize Winterland, the
Stanford Music Hall on University
Avenue offers damned nice music
at old Fillmore West prices along
with a beautifully relaxed
atmosphere.
Saturday night before the
opening set by local band Fever, a
slender young man in a recycled
denim suit stood munching
popcorn in the Music Hall lobby.
"You're the man ," said an
astonished patron to the
popcorn-muncher. "I mean,
you're Neal Schon."
"Yeah," replied Journey's lead
guitarist, smiling casually,
reaching out to shake the
questioner's hand. <
The scenario says something
about the Music Hall's
homeyness and something about
Schon, an incredibly
unpretentious 20 year-old genius
who has had other guitarists
both unknown and renowned
trembling for four years.
"I can't believe how many
guitarists there are now," says
Schon while settled back listening
to Fever's lead guitar. "There are
so many good guitarists."
As Fever hits the next song,
Schon exclaims, "Car-los, man,"
putting equal emphasis on each
syllable. "He sounds just like
Carlos."
If anyone should know the
Carlos Santana style, Schon
should. After getting his start with
the old Santana band at the age of
16, Schon now finds himself in
competition with his mentor on
the concert circuit.
How does it feel to have Carlos
Santana listen from the wings
when you hit a riff?
"It's great," says Schon,
"because he can't help but get off
on it."
Unfortunately, the Stanford
Music Hall was only about half
full, but the small crowd
definitely "got off" on Journey,
the headline band which features
Schon along with Gregg Rolie,

keyboards; Aynsley Dunbar,
drums; Ross Valory, bass; and
George Tickner, rhythm guitar.
The set which Journey has
been playing in concert for the
past three months or more has
achieved new polish, with the
most notable improvement
coming from Aynsley Dunbar's
drums. Still, Dunbar has a
tendency to fall behind tempo
and lose Schon on some of his
most dramatic leads, and this cuts
down on the effectiveness of the
band's innovative time changes.
Dunbar's errors and the fact
that Ross Valory's bass is a trifle
overpowering at times are,
however, things which only a real
nit-picker could notice. Journey is
incredibly tight, largely owing to
the strong blend of the musical
styles of Schon and Gregg Rolie.
Schon's guitar is lyrical,
providing delicate melodies that
float above open chords provided
by Tickner and Rolie. However
Schon will burst from a poignant
riff into a grinding lead
punctuated by Dunbar, then come
to a dead stop, shifting back to
the sweet drifting melody.
Rolie provides the hard
rock-blues drive of the band both
through his compositions and his
vocals. His influence is strongest
in one of the bands most powerful
songs, "Mystery Mountain" and
also evident in "Play Some
Music."
Together, Schon and Rolie
strike some kind of creative
balance that acts as Journey's
gyroscope, making the small
errors of Dunbar and Valory seem
almost irrelevant. Indeed, there
doesn't seem to be much the
West's finest guitarist and perhaps
strongest band can't handle but
they still have one minor problem:
"Santana!" yells a voice from
the balcony.
"That's a dirty household
word," replies Gregg Rolie. "I'm
sorry. We don't have any congas
or timbales. What did you say you
wanted?"
"Santana."
"Throw that guy outta here,"
orders Rolie.

That the day is coming when
Journey need no longer be
associated in any way with
Santana is unquestionable.
Hopefully CBS, with whom the
band just signed a contract for a
January album debut, will extol
their virtues without linking them
to past efforts, however noble.
Well, someday when those
lucky few who caught Journey at
the Stanford Music Hall Saturday
are looking back fondly in the
way some Bay Area residents
recall having the Grateful Dead
play at their senior,prom, don't
say you weren't warned.
The Stanford Music Hall will
be offering similar mellow musical
bargains in future weeks, but the
opening won't be outclassed for
months. Catch Journey soon,
listen, because someday you'll
really pay for that privilege.

THE BEST?-Neal Schon wasn't satisfied, with his performance
Saturday night ("I kind of forgot what key I was playing in a couple
of times"), but his overall status as one of the best guitarists in rock
was more than supported by his playing.
