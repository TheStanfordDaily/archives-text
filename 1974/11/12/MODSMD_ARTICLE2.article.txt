# Coal Strike Could Cause 'Depression'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - United
Mine Workers President Arnold Miller
said yesterday coal miners will not be
"bludgeoned into accepting" an
inadequate contract because of public
pressure to end their strike, which
began at 9:01 PST last night.
Another union official said the
strike might last three weeks.
A government official warned a
lengthy walkout threatens the nation
with a depression.
Negotiations broke up at 7:45 p.m.
last night without a contract
settlement and were to resume this
morning.
"I'm disappointed with the progress
we made," Miller said as he emerged
from the bargaining session.
Some Progress
The industry's chief negotiator,
Guy Farmer, said he, too, was
disappointed but said some progress
was achieved.
Farmer, who had earlier predicted
that a contract could be settled on by
last weekend, said: "I believe
definitely we can have it by the end of
the week."
Mines began shutting down last
Friday and Saturday as miners finished
their week's work with a strike certain
to begin before the Veterans Day
holiday ended today.
'No Coal'
Miller told a news conference that
while a prolonged strike will be hard
for the nation to bear, the 120,000
UMW members "will mine no coal
until they have a contract they can
work under safely and live under with
decency."
Farmer, calling for flexibility on
both sides, said: "We should be trying
doubly hard to settle the issue so we
can minimize the length of a strike."
Secretary of Labor Peter J. Brennan
indicated last night that the
government would not invoke the
Taft-Hartley Act, sending the miners
back to work, until the union
members had an opportunity to vote
on a proposed settlement.
"If they turn down the contract
and the strike looks like it's going on
longer, then I think it's time for the
government" to act, Brennan said on
the public television program
Washington Straight Talk.
"If we get into a battle or the
government steps in before time and
tries to dictate the policy, we're
stepping into a real mess that could
even go on longer," he said.
Railroads, steelmakers and other
industries that depend on coal braced
themselves for the miners' strike.
There were warnings that a long
walkout could mean serious problems
possibly even a depression.
Most industries indicated they
would not begin to feel the effects of
the walkout for about a week. Dennis
Hayes, chief of the fuel energy office
in Illinois, which gets about 26 percent
of its energy from coal, said no
industry would be hurt if the strike
ends within 14 days.
He said small manufacturers would
feel the pinch after two weeks and
added that if the walkout lasts a
month, it could touch off a
depression.
