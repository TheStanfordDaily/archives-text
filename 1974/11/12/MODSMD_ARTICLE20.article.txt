# Short Scenes Make 'Chalk Circle' Work
## 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
"If your drama can name the
myths of existence and the'
audience can recognize them as
their own, then it has succeeded,"
a local director once said.
The Drama Department's
production of Bertolt Brecht's
The Caucasian Chalk Circle does
just that with short, apt scenes
which by themselves are more
effective statements of the human
condition than the play as a whole
with its predictable and inevitable
resolution.
The play follows two lines of
development which intersect in
the trial scene at the end. The first
line is the story of a peasant
woman (Catherine Owen) who
adopts an infant of the ruling class
that has been abandoned by its
real mother during a peasants'
revolt.
The peasant woman, beset
upon by the relentless
"Ironshirts," the ruling class
soldiers, flees from the jaws of
authority so that she may keep
the infant.
No Help
She struggles with ignorant and
cowardly family, and friends,
cold-hearted authority and the
elements to be able to do what
she feels is right raise the child,
despite society's opposition. .
The second line of
development, and perhaps the
more engaging of the two, :
portrays a short-lived reign of
humanity in the court of the city
from which the peasant woman
has fled.
The Serivenor (David Miller), a 1
rascal, surrenders himself to be j
tried for treason. Through his
energetic histrionics, he not only I
wins acquittal but also gains i
appointment to the judge's seat 1
(a touch of Brecht fantasy). j
Better Court j
The court then becomes a
center of common sense, chaos 1
and "humanness," run by the 1
drunken Serivenor who sits on the r

book of legal codes and judges
with a sense of humanity.
The peasant woman, having
been caught by the "Ironshirts"
and brought back to the city,
must stand trial in the Scrivenor's
court to determine to whom the
child belongs.
The trial scene represents the
chaotic rule of the heart, of life
and of "humannessj' in conflict
with the cold authority of law and
order, of social contracts.
Biblical Theme
The resolution of the conflict
that is, of who will get the child
reflects the biblical tale wherein
two mothers claim the same child.
The outcome is inevitable.
Because of the inevitably of a
moral resolution in the end, the
real excitement of the play comes
in the scenes before the trial. It is
in these vignettes leading up to
the trial scene that the question
"who shall have a child, a land or
a society" is worked out.
Several scenes deserve
commendation, particularly all
those with David Miller (the
Scrivenor and an "Ironshirt"), the
peasant woman's reunion with her
cowardly husband (Michael
Sperberg) and his obnoxious wife
(Laurine Towler) and an
absolutely hilarious bath-tub
build-up-and-let-down scene.
Props Used
Grotesque half-masks are used
throughout The Chalk Circle. In
some cases, like the governor's
wife, the mask and exaggerated
fingers were used by the actor as
vividly stylized expressions of
personality. In other cases,
however, the mask dominated the
portrayal.
In any event, the effect of both
the little scenes and the small
vignettes played in the
background to evoke an answer to
that question of ownership is very
powerful.
In the end, we recognize
Brecht's ideal as our own what
there is shouid go to those who
deserve it and treat it well.
