# Preston Stars In Concert; Harrison's Throat Detracts
## 
### DAN FORTE 
OAKLAND—The best, most
simple, way to review the George
Harrison and Friends concert of
last week would be to just say,
"Billy Preston stole it," and leave it
at that.
Not that George and the boys
were completely lacking in
musical presence (they were there,
all right), but it was Preston's
soul-colored rock which brought
the packed house to its feet.
The Coliseum's 6 p.m. show
began with Harrison playing a
slide guitar instrumental, which
was a pleasant surprise to those
who'd expected to sit through
three days of sitar music before
seeing the ex-Beatle.
The Indian segment didn't
come until the half-way point,
with Harrison's "inspiration,"
Ravi Shankar, conducting 14
Eastern musicians (and sometimes
Harrison's band) in his own
compositions.
Tough To Judge
I personally don't feel that I,
or any critic this far removed
from India, can judge Shankar's
music except on a "gut" level. My
sentiments were best expressed by
one spectator who was heard to
say, "I wish I had some hand
grenades."
As everyone has heard by now,
Harrison's voice wasn't at its best,
due to a cold. But, this was a
major detrimental factor on only
a couple of tunes, most
predominately "Something." Here
Harrison had to shout the once
quiet and pretty tune, giving it a
hard-rock quality.
Announcing that he isn't
usually so fortunate as far as
backup musicians, Harrison
happily took the role of "Billy
Preston's guitarist" for "Will It Go
Round in Circles."
Cut Off
But, just as Preston started to
get the crowd going, he was
ushered back to the position of

"George Harrison's organist."
Up to that point, the crowd's
main interest had not been the
music, but merely the fact that
they were watching George
Harrison in person.
After the sitar segment, the
second set began with "For You
Blue" with guitarist Robben Ford
coming to the front for the first
and last time of the show, with a
nice, compact blues solo.
Ford Not Highlighted
On all other tunes, Ford
strummed chords behind
Harrison's leads. That's like having
Buddy Rich shake a tambourine
while Ringo Starr plays a 15
minute drum solo.
Saxophonist Tom Scott, the
"jazzman" heard on the Carole
King song, was featured on his
own unimpressive instrumental
"Tom Cat."
Harrison and the band sounded
better in the second set, and
included several selections from
the new Dark Horse album. But,
once again it was Preston who was
the real show stopper. (And to
think that Harrison nearly forgot
to introduce him at the Concert

For Bangladesh where he also
stole the show.)
After a fine version of
"Nothin' From Nothin,' " Preston
had the audience literally dancing
in the aisles, with three
consecutive renditions of
"Outa-Space" connected by his
impeccable, unforgettable
gospel-soul-funky-strut-buck
dance, complete with tambourine.
By all rights, the show's encore
should have been another Preston
number, like "Space Race "
"That's the Way God Planned It"
or "Wrote A Simple Song." It was
his night, and I would venture to
say that it will be his tour.
Instead, after finishing on
"Without Your Love," one of his
best selections of the night,
Harrison returned for "My Sweet
Lord." Like "Something", this
came off sounding like
thunderous, hard rock.
I thought it appropriate that
while Harrison was leading the
crowd in a "Krishna" chant, a
really first-class fist fight broke
out on the floor.
Ultimately, though, it was Mr.
Preston who came away with top
honors.

"Billy Preston stole it," and leave it
at that.
Not that George and the boys
were completely lacking in
musical presence (they were there,
all right), but it was Preston's
soul-colored rock which brought
the packed house to its feet.
The Coliseum's 6 p.m. show
began with Harrison playing a
slide guitar instrumental, which
was a pleasant surprise to those
who'd expected to sit through
three days of sitar music before
seeing the ex-Beatle.
The Indian segment didn't
come until the half-way point,
with Harrison's "inspiration,"
Ravi Shankar, conducting 14
Eastern musicians (and sometimes
Harrison's band) in his own
compositions.
Tough To Judge
I personally don't feel that I,
or any critic this far removed
from India, can judge Shankar's
music except on a "gut" level. My
sentiments were best expressed by
one spectator who was heard to
say, "I wish I had some hand
grenades."
As everyone has heard by now,
Harrison's voice wasn't at its best,
due to a cold. But, this was a
major detrimental factor on only
a couple of tunes, most
predominately "Something." Here
Harrison had to shout the once
quiet and pretty tune, giving it a
hard-rock quality.
Announcing that he isn't
usually so fortunate as far as
backup musicians, Harrison
happily took the role of "Billy
Preston's guitarist" for "Will It Go
Round in Circles."
Cut Off
But, just as Preston started to
get the crowd going, he was
ushered back to the position of

"George Harrison's organist."
Up to that point, the crowd's
main interest had not been the
music, but merely the fact that
they were watching George
Harrison in person.
After the sitar segment, the
second set began with "For You
Blue" with guitarist Robben Ford
coming to the front for the first
and last time of the show, with a
nice, compact blues solo.
Ford Not Highlighted
On all other tunes, Ford
strummed chords behind
Harrison's leads. That's like having
Buddy Rich shake a tambourine
while Ringo Starr plays a 15
minute drum solo.
Saxophonist Tom Scott, the
"jazzman" heard on the Carole
King song, was featured on his
own unimpressive instrumental
"Tom Cat."
Harrison and the band sounded
better in the second set, and
included several selections from
the new Dark Horse album. But,
once again it was Preston who was
the real show stopper. (And to
think that Harrison nearly forgot
to introduce him at the Concert

For Bangladesh where he also
stole the show.)
After a fine version of
"Nothin' From Nothin,' " Preston
had the audience literally dancing
in the aisles, with three
consecutive renditions of
"Outa-Space" connected by his
impeccable, unforgettable
gospel-soul-funky-strut-buck
dance, complete with tambourine.
By all rights, the show's encore
should have been another Preston
number, like "Space Race "
"That's the Way God Planned It"
or "Wrote A Simple Song." It was
his night, and I would venture to
say that it will be his tour.
Instead, after finishing on
"Without Your Love," one of his
best selections of the night,
Harrison returned for "My Sweet
Lord." Like "Something", this
came off sounding like
thunderous, hard rock.
I thought it appropriate that
while Harrison was leading the
crowd in a "Krishna" chant, a
really first-class fist fight broke
out on the floor.
Ultimately, though, it was Mr.
Preston who came away with top
honors.
