Watergate Trial Probes Hush Money
WASHINGTON The Watergate cover-up trial is
scheduled to focus today on the payment of hundreds of
thousands of dollars in alleged hush money to the original
seven Watergate defendants.
Herbert W. Kalmbach, once former President Richard M.
Nixon's personal lawyer, was summoned to testify how he
paid out $220,000 in the three months following the
original break-in.
The jury also is scheduled to hear Anthony Ulasewicz,
a retired New York City policeman who delivered cash to
the defendants or their lawyers.
Yesterday, Watergate prosecutors interlaced taped
segments of three June 23, 1972 White House conversations
with the testimony of then top CIA and FBI officials. The
prosecution was attempting to show a complex scheme to
use one agency to short circuit the Watergate investigation
of the other.
Deputy CIA Director Vernon A. Walters said he was
summoned to the White House on June 23, six days after
the original break-in at Democratic National Committee
headquarters.
Walters said he was directed by defendant H. R.
Haldeman to call then-Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray
111 and advise him that CIA resources in Mexico would be
jeopardized if the FBI continued its probe into the
financing of the break-in.
Walters, then on the job for only a month, said he
carried out this assignment almost immediately, although at
the time he could find no CIA connection to Watergate. He
testified that he thought it was possible that Haldeman
knew of some CIA operation of which he was unaware.
The jury then heard the first of the three tape segments
on which Nixon is heard giving his approval to use the CIA
to persuade Gray that the FBI was about to expose
sensitive CIA operations.
During the third tape segment, Haldeman reports back
to Nixon after meeting with the CIA officials. "Well, it's,
not a problem," says the former chief of staff.
Israeli Planes Bomb Lebanese Targets
BEIRUT, Lebanon Israeli jets bombed suspected
guerrilla targets in Lebanon yesterday for the first time in
three weeks as the United Nations prepared to debate the
Palestinian question.
The Lebanese Defense Ministry said there were scores of
casualties in the 17-minute attack by 12 fighter-bombers in
the southeastern part of the country.
A Lebanese military communique said the Israeli air raid
caused widespread damage and killed two Lebanese villagers
and wounded seven. This implied the other casualties were
Palestinians.
The attack came shortly after Israeli Foreign Minister
Yigal Allon said his government was seeking out Arab
leaders in Israeli-occupied territory who don't belong to the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
Sixteen members of the PLO, the first nongovernmental
group ever invited to participate in a U.N. General
Assembly discussion, arrived in New York for the two-week
debate that starts tomorrow.
In Washington, the State Department said PLO leader
Yasir Arafat, who was in Cairo last night en route to New
York, and 10 other PLO members got U.S. visas Sunday in
Cairo. Arafat and his group were not expected to arrive
until sometime today.
Doctors May Discharge Nixon Soon
LONG BEACH, Calif. Former President Richard M.
Nixon may be well enough to leave the hospital this week,
his doctors said yesterday.

His condition has improved from serious to
intermediate, the doctors said, and he is once again taking
an anticoagulant drug to prevent further blood clots in his
phlebitis-stricken left leg. He was reported to be eating
normal foods and walking more in his room.
It was the best news about the 61-year-old former
president since doctors said he went into near-fatal shock
caused by internal bleeding after phlebitis surgery Oct. 29.
Intermediate condition "means a nurse is with him
around the clock," the doctors said.
Drs. John C. Lungren and Eldon B. Hickman said in a
written statement that Nixon would undergo blood tests
this week presumably to determine if the anticoagulant is
working properly. They also said there would be follow-up
studies on Nixon's lungs before the date of his release is
determined.
"Depending on a favorable outcome of these studies, we
are hopeful that he can be discharged ... sometime this
week," they said.
Meanwhile, there was no further word from U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica on what progress was being
made to name a panel of three doctors this week to
examine Nixon to determine whether he is able to testify at
the Watergate cover-up trial of five of his former political
associates.
Zebra Trial May Begin This Week
SAN FRANCISCO The Zebra murder trial of four
Black Muslims jailed last May is scheduled to start this week
and court sources say it could last up to four months.
The men were to appear before San Francisco Superior
Court Judge Joseph Karesh today, but the trial faces
possible postponement because of a defense attorney's
conflicting court date.
Karesh and Alameda County Superior Court Judge
Harold Hove must decide whether Clinton White, chief
counsel for three of the four defendants, will keep a
commitment in Hove's court on another murder case.
The arrests of the accused men came after an informer,
ex-convict Anthony Harris, gave authorities their names and
said they belonged to a murderous sect called the "Death
Angels."
The defendants are Manuel Moore, 29; Larry Craig
Green, 22; J.C.X. Simon, 25, and Jessie Lee Cooks, 28, a
San Quentin convict who pleaded guilty earlier to the
shooting murder of Francis Rose, which took place 10 days
after the first Zebra-labeled killing.
Solzhenitsyn To Receive Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden Russian novelist Alexander
Solzhenitsyn is finally going to get his 1970 Nobel Prize for
literature. The Nobel Foundation said yesterday special
ceremonies will be held Dec. 10.
Officials said the exiled Russian novelist notified them
he will be able to attend the award ceremonies.
His prize money, $90,000, was deposited in a Swiss bank
account in accordance with the novelist's request.
Solzhenitsyn did not come to Stockholm to pick up the
prize in 1970 because he said he feared the Soviet Union
would not permit him to return to his homeland. He since
has left Russia and now lives in Switzerland.
Several attempts to present the award at the Swedish
Embassy or at a private apartment in Moscow also failed.
Today's Weather

occasional high cloudiness. Increasing clouds tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the 40s to low 50s. Highs both days in the
60s to low 70s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to 20
