# PG&E Cuts Gas Service; University Moves To Oil
## 
### 
Pacific Gas & Electric informed
University officials yesterday
afternoon that it would begin
interruption of natural gas service at 7
a.m. today.
Jason Mavis, director of plant
services, said the University will
convert to fuel oil reserves, and
operations will not be affected today.
"We have 500,000 gallons in reserve
fuel oil, which is more than enough to
cover short range cut-offs," he said.
"But if service is interrupted for two
or three days in succession, we'll have
to start cracking down wherever
possible."
Mavis said he expects to hear this
morning whether the interruption, the
first of the year, will continue into a
second day. The University expects 21
such days during this academic year.
Converting to fuel oil will cost the
University about $4500 more per day.
Mavis said he has no idea why
PG&E is interrupting service. "All they
told us was that they don't have
enough gas to service all of their
customers."
Mavis added that the coal strike
beginning today and possible gas
shortages in the Northeast make more

interruptions possible.
Stanford is on "interruptible
service," which means PG&E can cut
off natural gas supplies at any time on
short notice.
In mild weather, Mavis explained,
the University will have to burn about
20,000 gallons of oil a day to maintain
full operations, at a cost of $4500. But
if the temperature drops below 50
degrees, up to 30,000 gallons a day
may be needed to maintain normal
levels.
"The extended weather forecast
says we're due for a significant cold
spell, somewhere around Dec. 4,"
Mavis said. "If PG&E interrupts service
then we could be back in the same
situation we were in last year."
At that time, heating was cut back
in dormitories and many campus
buildings.
Mavis encourages sacrifice to help
ease the situation. "Every degree a
secretary can stand or a student can
take will mean lower operating costs
and a lower tuition next year. These
extra expenses are reflected in the
price of Stanford eventually ... a little
bit of suffering, just a little bit, will go
a long way."

and a lower tuition next year. These

Pacific Gas & Electric informed
University officials yesterday
afternoon that it would begin
interruption of natural gas service at 7
a.m. today.
Jason Mavis, director of plant
services, said the University will
convert to fuel oil reserves, and
operations will not be affected today.
"We have 500,000 gallons in reserve
fuel oil, which is more than enough to
cover short range cut-offs," he said.
"But if service is interrupted for two
or three days in succession, we'll have
to start cracking down wherever
possible."
Mavis said he expects to hear this
morning whether the interruption, the
first of the year, will continue into a
second day. The University expects 21
such days during this academic year.
Converting to fuel oil will cost the
University about $4500 more per day.
Mavis said he has no idea why
PG&E is interrupting service. "All they
told us was that they don't have
enough gas to service all of their
customers."
Mavis added that the coal strike
beginning today and possible gas
shortages in the Northeast make more

interruptions possible.
Stanford is on "interruptible
service," which means PG&E can cut
off natural gas supplies at any time on
short notice.
In mild weather, Mavis explained,
the University will have to burn about
20,000 gallons of oil a day to maintain
full operations, at a cost of $4500. But
if the temperature drops below 50
degrees, up to 30,000 gallons a day
may be needed to maintain normal
levels.
"The extended weather forecast
says we're due for a significant cold
spell, somewhere around Dec. 4,"
Mavis said. "If PG&E interrupts service
then we could be back in the same
situation we were in last year."
At that time, heating was cut back
in dormitories and many campus
buildings.
Mavis encourages sacrifice to help
ease the situation. "Every degree a
secretary can stand or a student can
take will mean lower operating costs
and a lower tuition next year. These
extra expenses are reflected in the
price of Stanford eventually ... a little
bit of suffering, just a little bit, will go
a long way."
