# Residential College Proposal Revised
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
After facing strong criticism of his
original "Stanford-in-Stanford"
proposal, ASSU President Mike
Herman has developed a modified
version of the residential college plan.
Herman said yesterday he hopes to
launch a two-quarter pilot program
next September, which would allow
45 students to intensively study a
multi-disciplinary subject with three to
five professors.
The revised plan will allow
professors to live at home. Faculty will
be required to teach only one class at
Stanford-in-Stanford and will continue
to draw their salaries directly from
their department, Herman said.
Although the general concept of a
residential college was viewed
favorably by administrators, the
original plan was criticized as being

economically unsound.
Faculty Requirements
Co-authored by Herman and
graduate anthropology student Tom
Glenn, that plan would have forbidden
participating faculty from teaching
outside the residential college. College
professors thus would lose the
financial support of their departments,
and the new college would be forced
to pay the professors' full salaries.
The original plan also would have
required residential college faculty to
live with the students. No Stanford
residence has facilities for housing five
professors and 45 students, and
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton estimated that the cost
of such a residence would be "at least
$100,000."
Modeled after the overseas campus
idea, the program called for professors
from University departments such as
Values, Technology and Society (VTS)
and Human Biology to modify their
existing courses for the residential
college.
Reduced Cost
The original cost of "up to
$150,000 per year," according to
Glenn, has been reduced to about
$lO,OOO. After reviewing Herman's
preliminary cost analysis, Horton said
$lO,OOO "sounds like a reasonable
figure."
Both original and revised plans
forbid students in the program from
taking classes outside of the residential
college during the two quarters.
Horton and Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs have objected to
such isolation from the rest of

University academic life.
"We clearly want programs in the
residence that complement regular
academic work. We don't want
something that's totally isolated,"
Horton said at an Oct. 4 press
conference.
Close Relationship
Reacting to these criticisms,
Herman insisted that the program
actually would be "cutting down" on
student isolation by insuring a close
relationship between the 45 students.
Working on a Feb. 1 deadline for
finalizing the pilot program, he said he
hopes to choose professors and a
theme "simultaneously." He claims
that professors will be attracted both
by the selected topic and the prospect
of working with colleagues from other
departments.
Herman foresees no problem in

attracting 45 students to the untested
program. "I expect very definitely that
there will be that much interest," he
stated.
Unfeasible Now
While admitting that his original
plan "is not feasible at all" now, given
current University financial troubles,
he expressed the desire that the full
residential college program eventually
be implemented.
Horton, although disagreeing with
some aspects of that original plan, said
he hopes that "we can get a modified
version off."
Herman also expects a nine-member
policy committee to choose faculty
and focus in future years. In order to
get the pilot program "off the
ground," however, "we [Herman and
Glenn] are acting as the policy
committee now," Herman said.
