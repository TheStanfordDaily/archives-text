# Snape Proposes Student-Run, 'Responsive' Tresidder Union
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Asst. Dean of Students Dale Snape
told the ASSU Senate last night it
should consider taking control of
Tresidder Union to make it "more
responsive philosophically and
pragmatically" to student needs.
"In order to survive, Tresidder has
to have student involvement and
student purchasing," Snape said.
Snape spoke at a special ASSU
Senate meeting held in Branner Hall
lounge before "40 persons. He and
others involved with the ASSU
discussed various aspects of the
organization's functions.
The Tresidder proposal is
"speculative," said ASSU President
Mike Herman. However, Snape noted
that the University will cut expenses
"rather significantly in the next three
years. I'd like to challenge the ASSU
to provide better programs than the

University does." The University has
subsidized Tresidder in recent years.
'Service Provider'
He urged the ASSU to "look at the
widest possible concept of its job" as a
"service provider" to students.
The ASSU operates such student
services as the Sunday Flicks, ASSU
Travel Service, refrigerator rentals,
lecture notes and special events,
according to ASSU Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri.
"The long-term goal of the ASSU is
to have more services at a lower cost
to the Stanford community" than is
possible off-campus, Olivieri said.
Dan Scher, director of special events,
said this year's concerts are "the best
that appeal to Stanford students" at
prices lower than those of off-campus
concerts. Scher said that his office
"made a profit" last year. Five of the
six concerts this year have sold out, he
said.

The largest ASStJ operation the
ASSU Travel Service has priced
charter flights "low enough" so that
students will pay for them, said Travel
Service Manager Bob Beach. He said
that relatively short-distance flights to
the Northwest have been ruled out
because "our cost would not be
significantly lower than on a
commercial flight."
Sunday Flicks Manager Rocky
Barber reported that he chooses
movies on the basis of "what I think
are good movies and on what the
students want." A student survey will
continue to be taken each year to
determine student preference, he said.
Barber said he chose Academy
Award-winner Save The Tiger over
Gone With The Wind because the
latter movie had been screened "many
times."
Price Won't Rise
No admission price rise is expected
in the near future, Barber said. He
claimed that the Sunday Flicks have
"cost 50 cents for the last 10 years."
He also said the problems of
"rowdiness" have disappeared with the
new $2 charge for those without
Stanford identification.
Olivieri said that the refrigerator
rental service is available to students at
a lower price than from private
dealers. The outside vendor's price is a
"rip-off," according to Olivieri.
Winter quarter lecture notes of 14
classes will be sold under the direction
of Vic Petroff. Petroff's committee is
considering 67 applications for the
note-taking positions.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
Herman, Ann Carter and Quinn Mayer
(Len Mackey was not present)
discussed their ex-officio role with the
Senate. "My function is to report to
the Senate what we are doing in the
Council of Presidents," Carter said.
Herman said he helps the Senate by
giving "unsolicited advice. I have spent
two years on the Senate," and can give
advice to individual senators, he said.
