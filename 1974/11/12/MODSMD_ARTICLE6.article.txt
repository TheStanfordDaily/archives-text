# How To Avoid Attack
## Police Direct Advice To Women 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
First of Two Parts
Stanford is "the safest place for a woman to be walking
alone at night in the entire Peninsula," said Santa Clara
County Police Captain Frank Benaderet in the Daily on
Oct. 18, 1973.
In one year, however, the situation has taken an
unfortunate turn. Four violent attacks occurred on or near
campus within a period of two weeks, according to
Stanford Police Officer Debbie Whittemore.
Every sex crime on campus occurred as a result of the
victims' "stupidity," Whittemore said last week after
showing the movie Nobody 's Victim at a special meeting on
self-defense for women.
There are ways to avoid trouble before it starts.
Awareness
The most important aspect in avoiding attacks is
awareness "of where you are, what you are doing and
who is around you" according to Palo Alto Police Crime
Prevention Officer Christopher Durkin.
For example, when walking alone at night in a secluded,
unlighted area, you should realize that you are in a
vulnerable situation.
A good rule of thumb when walking at night is to never
walk alone. "You don't find many girls in groups of twos
and threes being attacked," said Durkin. "It's always the
solo."
Both officers agree you should walk in well-lighted and
unsecluded areas. A spokesman from Mid-Peninsula Women
Against Rape (WAR) added that you should walk away
from bushes and other places where someone could be
hiding.

Sergeant Michael Mee, project director of the Palo Alto
Police Department's rape study, said that when returning to
your car or home at night, carry your keys in your hands
for quick entry and attach a loud metal whistle to the
key chain in case you need to attract attention.
"A set of keys in your hand applied to someone's face
can hurt," said Durkin. Two or three keys are a "useful
weapon" when you straddle them between the near halves
of your fingers with one key between two fingers, make a
fist to hold them tightly, and then make a downward
motion with your fist onto the attacker's face. (The idea is
to make one long vertical slash, rather than three parallel
ones.)
'Virtual Arsenal'
"The average girl carries a virtual arsenal in her purse,"
said Durkin. A metal nail file, rat-tail comb or letter opener
concealed in your hands can also be an effective weapon.
But carrying a knife is not recommended by Durkin or
Whittemore. "If you're carrying a butcher knife," said
Durkin, "you're carrying a concealed weapon" and thus are
subject to arrest.
Whittemore explained that carrying things such as nail
files, small enough to conceal in your hands, are better than
carrying a knife. With a larger weapon, she explained,
"someone might grab it from you."
Pocket knives, on the other hand, are small enough to
conceal in your hand and are legal. But if you are suddenly
attacked, said Durkin, "you've got to open it, and you
might open the screwdriver by mistake."
Sprays Disabling
Guns, Whittemore insisted, should only be carried by
those who have had "competent instruction" in using them.
Using sprays such as mace, hair spray or dog repellent is
risky, because if the spray accidentally gets in your face in a
confrontation, you too will become "disabled," said
Whittemore. (Mace is illegal in California.)
Holding a flashlight is a good idea not only to illuminate
dark areas, but as a weapon with which tostrike a blow, or
to shine In someone's eyes. "A flashlight pointed in the
eyes," explained Durkin, "will temporarily or momentarily
blind someone."
Driving Alone
Common sense rules when driving alone day or night
begin with looking in the back seat of your car before
entering "even if you locked it," Durkin said. Anyone can
break into a car within a matter of "30 seconds."
"A woman driving alone is a target for assault,"
according to the self protection film Nobody's Victim.
When driving you should always have all doors locked and
windows closed.
To avoid being stranded alone with car trouble, be sure
that you have plenty of gas and that your car is in good
running condition. If you do happen to have car trouble,
flash your hazard lights, put a white cloth on your antenna
and wait inside your locked car until a policeman or tow
truck arrives.
If a stranger stops to help you, ask him to call the police
for you. Don't roll down the windows and don't get out of
the car.
Precautions At Home
Besides precautions against attacks when outside of the
home, there are measures to be aware of when inside the
home.
If you are home alone, "don't advertise it," Durkin
warned. Not only should you list your name in the phone
book as "M. Smith" rather than "Mary Smith," but you

shouldn't list your address. "Guys are smart enough now
when they see only an initial listed in the phone book,"
they know it's a female, said Durkin.
Don't tell strangers on the phone that you are home
alone. People occasionally assume the role of a survey-taker
or radio disc jockey to find out whether a woman is home
alone and if so, what she is doing. "Even go to the point
where you lie" about someone else being there, Durkin
said.
Reliable Locks
It is important to draw the curtains at night and to keep
the doors and windows locked at all times. "Fifty percent
of all entries are made through unlocked doors and
windows," Durkin said. On warm days, open windows may
be secured in place with special pins.
The last attempted rape in Palo Alto, according to
Durkin, occurred when a woman wearing only a negligee
was seen through the window by a man outside the house
who then crawled in through an open window.
As for the door, a keyed doorknob alone is too easy to
break through. Door chains serve as additional protection,
but only minimally. "Anyone can throw his weight through
a door and break down the chain," said Durkin. Double
cylinder, deadbolt locks are more reliable.
If a stranger knocks on your door, demand identification
before you let him in. Wide-angle portholes as opposed to
regular peepholes give you a better view of who is at your
door.
"Make sure you know your neighbor and they know
you," Durkin added. Let them know when you are home
alone so that if they see or hear anything suspicious, they
can notify the police.
Finally, keep a telephone near you. If you spend time in
the living room, but the telephone is in thtf kitchen, install a
second phone or an extension cord, and be sure the local
police number is nearby.
