## Police Direct Advice To Women

First of Two Parts
Stanford is "the safest place for a woman to be walking
alone at night in the entire Peninsula," said Santa Clara
County Police Captain Frank Benaderet in the Daily on
Oct. 18, 1973.
In one year, however, the situation has taken an
unfortunate turn. Four violent attacks occurred on or near
campus within a period of two weeks, according to
Stanford Police Officer Debbie Whittemore.
Every sex crime on campus occurred as a result of the
victims' "stupidity," Whittemore said last week after
showing the movie Nobody 's Victim at a special meeting on
self-defense for women.
There are ways to avoid trouble before it starts.
Awareness
The most important aspect in avoiding attacks is
awareness "of where you are, what you are doing and
who is around you" according to Palo Alto Police Crime
Prevention Officer Christopher Durkin.
For example, when walking alone at night in a secluded,
unlighted area, you should realize that you are in a
vulnerable situation.
A good rule of thumb when walking at night is to never
walk alone. "You don't find many girls in groups of twos
and threes being attacked," said Durkin. "It's always the
solo."
Both officers agree you should walk in well-lighted and
unsecluded areas. A spokesman from Mid-Peninsula Women
Against Rape (WAR) added that you should walk away
from bushes and other places where someone could be
hiding.

Sergeant Michael Mee, project director of the Palo Alto
Police Department's rape study, said that when returning to
your car or home at night, carry your keys in your hands
for quick entry and attach a loud metal whistle to the
key chain in case you need to attract attention.
"A set of keys in your hand applied to someone's face
can hurt," said Durkin. Two or three keys are a "useful
weapon" when you straddle them between the near halves
of your fingers with one key between two fingers, make a
fist to hold them tightly, and then make a downward
motion with your fist onto the attacker's face. (The idea is
to make one long vertical slash, rather than three parallel
ones.)
'Virtual Arsenal'
"The average girl carries a virtual arsenal in her purse,"
said Durkin. A metal nail file, rat-tail comb or letter opener
concealed in your hands can also be an effective weapon.
But carrying a knife is not recommended by Durkin or
Whittemore. "If you're carrying a butcher knife," said
Durkin, "you're carrying a concealed weapon" and thus are
subject to arrest.
Whittemore explained that carrying things such as nail
files, small enough to conceal in your hands, are better than
carrying a knife. With a larger weapon, she explained,
"someone might grab it from you."
Pocket knives, on the other hand, are small enough to
conceal in your hand and are legal. But if you are suddenly
attacked, said Durkin, "you've got to open it, and you
might open the screwdriver by mistake."
Sprays Disabling
Guns, Whittemore insisted, should only be carried by
