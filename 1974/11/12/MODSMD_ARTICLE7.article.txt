# Xenophobia?
## 
### Tom Graham 
When we Americans try to
analyze the causes and determine
the cures for inflation will our
thinking be more objective or
more xenophobic? At a first
glance it would seem like
inflation, of its current
magnitude, has been caused by
extreme increases in the cost of
natural resources, oil in particular.
Thus an obvious solution is to cut
back on oil and other natural
resources. This is exactly where
either short-sighted analysis, both
of the past and into the future, or
a significant case of xenophobia
could cloud the picture.
Analyzed in any historical
perspective, even if one starts
from World War II and thus leaves
out the entire colonial period, it is
obvious that the international
trade and finance system has
benefitted the developed
countries to such an extent as to
make the OPEC oil price increase
look like a drop in the bucket. If
one looks to the near future it
seems like the international trade
system will again shift more in
favor of the developed countries,
with a few of the OPEC nations
becoming special cases rather than
representing a change in the trend.
The future's market for raw
materials shows that prices of
many raw materials are dropping.
More significantly for the
developing countries, the amount
of s&les have dropped sharply.
Thus developing countries total
income from exported resources
has dropped drastically.
Short Sighted View
Here we see how America's
cutting back, if done with a short
sighted view of cutting costs
rather than a longer termed view
of changing the distribution of
resources, will increase the gap
between rich and poor nations. If
this happens it will give the
resource exporting countries
more, not less, reason to increase
prices.
America and many of the
developed countries have a large
enough economy so that cutting
back is both possible and
necessary to start to cut out the
extreme waste that seems to be a
by-product of development. For
most of the countries of the
world, even some OPEC nations,
this cutting back is not pssible
because the people are living at
subsistance levels or below.
It might be correct to ask at
this point: Where does this lead in
terms of American policy, and
how is this xenophobia? The
change in policy is as much an
attitude change as anything
because an attitude change will

help Americans see how lucky we
are. This in turn will help us
realize that paying more of the
actual costs for our high standard
of living is the least we can do.
Euphemisms
The xenophobia is
either non-existent or very well
disguised in the type of language
for which politicians and
academicians are known. I could
be very wrong on this point, but I
hope to at least bring the idea up
for discussion in an academic
community which is known for its
social concern.
When a political science or
economics professor stands up to
talk about (tur interdependent
world does he mean what he says
or is he just using different words
to say that foreigners now have
enough power to significantly
effect our country? The world has
been interdependent in this way
for hundreds of years though
"we" have usually affected
"them." Usually this is
sidestepped by specifically
defining the difference between
the dependent world or pre-war
and the interdependent world of
today as if the international
economic system made a sudden
change after nations achieved
their independence.
Less Foreign Aid
If the professor means that the
world is interdependent, then
should he also try to explain the
downward trend in American
foreign aid and compare this with
other developed countries' aid.
This is happening at a time when
they are experiencing the same
balance of payments problems
that we are facing. Should he
analyze more carefully just who
benefited most from America's
celebrated view that we built the
world after World War II?
If this type of analysis is
started it might show that we do
live in an interdependent world,
though interdependence now
continues to mean increasing
inequality. It would show that the
time for other nations to take up
their fair share of aid and defense
spending sounds very shaky if we
see that the most powerful nation
is becoming more and more a
second rate power in terms of
meeting its obligations in an
interdependent world, though it
still claims many of the benefits.

do what they will, and the weak
do what they must." Have the
powerful learned how to use
power more wisely since the
Peloponnesian War?

natural resources, oil in particular.
Thus an obvious solution is to cut
back on oil and other natural
resources. This is exactly where
either short-sighted analysis, both
of the past and into the future, or
a significant case of xenophobia
could cloud the picture.
Analyzed in any historical
perspective, even if one starts
from World War II and thus leaves
out the entire colonial period, it is
obvious that the international
trade and finance system has
benefitted the developed
countries to such an extent as to
make the OPEC oil price increase
look like a drop in the bucket. If
one looks to the near future it
seems like the international trade
system will again shift more in
favor of the developed countries,
with a few of the OPEC nations
becoming special cases rather than
representing a change in the trend.
The future's market for raw
materials shows that prices of
many raw materials are dropping.
More significantly for the
developing countries, the amount
of s&les have dropped sharply.
Thus developing countries total
income from exported resources
has dropped drastically.
Short Sighted View
Here we see how America's
cutting back, if done with a short
sighted view of cutting costs
rather than a longer termed view
of changing the distribution of
resources, will increase the gap
between rich and poor nations. If
this happens it will give the
resource exporting countries
more, not less, reason to increase
prices.
America and many of the
developed countries have a large
enough economy so that cutting
back is both possible and
necessary to start to cut out the
extreme waste that seems to be a
by-product of development. For
most of the countries of the
world, even some OPEC nations,
this cutting back is not pssible
because the people are living at
subsistance levels or below.
It might be correct to ask at
this point: Where does this lead in
terms of American policy, and
how is this xenophobia? The
change in policy is as much an
attitude change as anything
because an attitude change will

help Americans see how lucky we
are. This in turn will help us
realize that paying more of the
actual costs for our high standard
of living is the least we can do.
Euphemisms
The xenophobia is
either non-existent or very well
disguised in the type of language
for which politicians and
academicians are known. I could
be very wrong on this point, but I
hope to at least bring the idea up
for discussion in an academic
community which is known for its
social concern.
When a political science or
economics professor stands up to
talk about (tur interdependent
world does he mean what he says
or is he just using different words
to say that foreigners now have
enough power to significantly
effect our country? The world has
been interdependent in this way
for hundreds of years though
"we" have usually affected
"them." Usually this is
sidestepped by specifically
defining the difference between
the dependent world or pre-war
and the interdependent world of
today as if the international
economic system made a sudden
change after nations achieved
their independence.
Less Foreign Aid
If the professor means that the
world is interdependent, then
should he also try to explain the
downward trend in American
foreign aid and compare this with
other developed countries' aid.
This is happening at a time when
they are experiencing the same
balance of payments problems
that we are facing. Should he
analyze more carefully just who
benefited most from America's
celebrated view that we built the
world after World War II?
If this type of analysis is
started it might show that we do
live in an interdependent world,
though interdependence now
continues to mean increasing
inequality. It would show that the
time for other nations to take up
their fair share of aid and defense
spending sounds very shaky if we
see that the most powerful nation
is becoming more and more a
second rate power in terms of
meeting its obligations in an
interdependent world, though it
still claims many of the benefits.

When we Americans try to

perspective, even if one starts
from World War II and thus leaves
out the entire colonial period, it is
obvious that the international
trade and finance system has
benefitted the developed
countries to such an extent as to
make the OPEC oil price increase
look like a drop in the bucket. If
one looks to the near future it
seems like the international trade
system will again shift more in
favor of the developed countries,
with a few of the OPEC nations
becoming special cases rather than
representing a change in the trend.
The future's market for raw
materials shows that prices of
many raw materials are dropping.
More significantly for the
developing countries, the amount
of s&les have dropped sharply.
Thus developing countries total
income from exported resources
has dropped drastically.
Short Sighted View
Here we see how America's
cutting back, if done with a short
sighted view of cutting costs
rather than a longer termed view
of changing the distribution of
resources, will increase the gap
between rich and poor nations. If
this happens it will give the
resource exporting countries
more, not less, reason to increase
prices.
America and many of the
developed countries have a large
enough economy so that cutting
back is both possible and
necessary to start to cut out the
extreme waste that seems to be a
by-product of development. For
most of the countries of the
world, even some OPEC nations,
this cutting back is not pssible
because the people are living at
subsistance levels or below.
It might be correct to ask at
this point: Where does this lead in
terms of American policy, and
how is this xenophobia? The
change in policy is as much an
attitude change as anything
because an attitude change will

help Americans see how lucky we
are. This in turn will help us
realize that paying more of the
actual costs for our high standard
of living is the least we can do.
Euphemisms
The xenophobia is
either non-existent or very well
disguised in the type of language
for which politicians and
academicians are known. I could
be very wrong on this point, but I
hope to at least bring the idea up
for discussion in an academic
community which is known for its
social concern.
When a political science or
economics professor stands up to
talk about (tur interdependent
world does he mean what he says
or is he just using different words
to say that foreigners now have
enough power to significantly
effect our country? The world has
been interdependent in this way
for hundreds of years though
"we" have usually affected
"them." Usually this is
sidestepped by specifically
defining the difference between
the dependent world or pre-war
and the interdependent world of
today as if the international
economic system made a sudden
change after nations achieved
their independence.
Less Foreign Aid
If the professor means that the
world is interdependent, then
should he also try to explain the
downward trend in American
foreign aid and compare this with
other developed countries' aid.
This is happening at a time when
they are experiencing the same
balance of payments problems
that we are facing. Should he
analyze more carefully just who
benefited most from America's
celebrated view that we built the
world after World War II?
If this type of analysis is
started it might show that we do
live in an interdependent world,
though interdependence now
continues to mean increasing
inequality. It would show that the
time for other nations to take up
their fair share of aid and defense
spending sounds very shaky if we
see that the most powerful nation
is becoming more and more a
second rate power in terms of
meeting its obligations in an
interdependent world, though it
still claims many of the benefits.
Thucydidies said: "The strong
do what they will, and the weak
do what they must." Have the
powerful learned how to use
power more wisely since the
Peloponnesian War?
