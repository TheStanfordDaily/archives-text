What is a BIRKENSTOCK?
The distinguishing feature
of the Birkenstock sandal
is the molded footprint
contour. It was inspired by
observing the natural
function of the foot on
soft earth. A yielding
surface supports the arch
of the foot and invites the
gripping action of the toes.
The patented footprint
contour is composed of
highly elastic cork. It
becomes flexible with
body warmth and molds
itself to your feet
becoming more "your
own" with every step you
take.
