SOME PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR
PROTECTING TOURSELF AND TOUR PROPERTY
University officiais are seeking new ways to increase the security of in
dividuals and their possessions on the Stanford campus. In the meantime,
there are several practical steps that students and employees can take to
protect themselves and their property from criminal action. Please follow
them carefully for your own good.
1. Travel in pairs or in a group at night, particularly in dark or isolated
areas of the campus. Avoid placing yourself in longely streets or
buildings with no one else in sight.
2. If you must walk alone, avoid dark corners and heavy shrubbery. Stay
near the curb of streets at night; if the street is very dark, walk in the
middle of the road.
3. Obey your instincts! If you sense danger, cross the street, go into an
occupied building, move to well lighted or occupied areas.
4. If followed by someone in a car, walk in the opposite direction or into a
public area where the car cannot follow. Copy down the make of the
car, the license number, and the description of the driver and report
this information to the police department. Beward giving directions to
drivers who have their car engines running and are in a position to
pull away quickly.
5. Don't let strangers stop you on the street to talk, or to obtain a match
or cigarette, particularly at night.
6. If attacked, react instantly. Jab your attacker with a pencil or other
sharp instrument. Scream loudly and continuously, or blow a whistle.
Fire alarm boxes can be used to bring fire and policemen to the scene
in minutes.
7. Park your car in an area that will be well lighted at night. Lock all
doors, and check the backseat for someone hiding there when you
return. If someone is loitering in the area of your car, wait until he
leaves or have someone escort you to the vehicle. Have your keys in
hand when you approach your car so that you can enter without delay.
8. While driving, keep your doors locked and windows rolled up. If it is
hot, roll down the window on the driver's side. Keep your purse or
other valuables next to you or out of sight; thieves often jump out at
intersections to take belongings from the seat.
9. If someone tries to force his way into your car, blow your horn and
drive away. If at all possible, do not allow him to force you to drive to
a secluded area, where the personal risks would be far greater. Use
your horn, jump out your door, or cause a slight accident anything
to call attention to your plight in a populated area. His first instinct
will be to escape.
10. Never pick up hitchhikers.
11. If there is absolutely no choice but to give up property or submit to
someone armed with a weapon, it is best not to resist.
12. If something does happen to you, be as observant as you can. Note all
possible details about an individual or his automobile: his clothing,
watch, rings, facial characteristics, license number, color of car,
bumper stickers, car damages, and other features.
"Nobody's Victim," a film about ways to defend yourself from attackers,
will be shown continuously from 1 to 5 p.m. everyday the week of Nov. 18 in
Room 270 of Tresidder Union. Stanford police officers also are available to
discuss self-protection techniques with interested groups. Arrangements
may be made at 497-3444. The YWCA sponsors an emergency 24-hour rape
crisis line. Call 493-R/ ~if needed.
