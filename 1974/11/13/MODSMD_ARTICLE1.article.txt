# Miller Says University Deficit Will Hit $1.6 Million This Year
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Further University budget
reductions "are likely to be painful
and have noticeable impact," Acting
President William JVliller declared last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
Earlier in the day, Miller revealed
that the University anticipates a $1.6
million deficit for the 1974-75 fiscal
year. Miller also confirmed that the
University sustained a $300,000
deficit last year, more than twice what
was expected.
The deficits will be covered by a

contingency fund established during
the University's year of expansion in
the late 1950s and early 19605, Miller
explained.
The fund, which originally included
$6 million, has been reduced to
approximately $2.7 million during the
last five years. It will lose another
$300,000 as a result of the current
deficit, Miller added.
Although Miller noted that he is
"not in a position to identify
particular programs" that might be
sliced, he strongly emphasized that the

University will cut strictly academic
programs only as a "last resort."
But Miller admitted that programs
in every area have been cut to the
greatest extent possible short of
sacrificing quality during the last five
years.
Not Much Fat
"I do not believe that "there is
much 'fat' in the Stanford budget,"
Miller said. "Most of the obvious
targets for budget reduction were
discovered during the five years of
BAP [Budget Adjustment Program],

and what remains in the budget is
largely well justified."
Referring to a new three-year, $lO
million austerity program, Miller said
that "no reasonably predictable
combination of income improvement
and reduction in administrative areas
will close ... the gap."
Miller acknowledged the
University's financial problems might
hasten further deterioration of the
student-faculty ratio.
But noting that "our competition is
having trouble, too," Miller affirmed
that Stanford is still in a strong
position to attract the highest quality
faculty.
Problem Solving Ability
"We have the capacity to solve our
problems as well or better than they
[other universities]," Miller said. He
added that he doesn't expect the ratio
to increase drastically.
Miller noted that rising interest
rates and construction costs have
hindered plans to construct the
University's proposed $25 million
library. But Miller said until the
Budget Priorities Commission studies
the situation, it is impossible to
determine how plans will be affected.
Future plans for Tresidder Union
and construction of new student
housing will also receive the attention
of the committee, Miller said.

FINANCIAL CRlSlS—Acting President William Miller discussed the University's
projected $1.6 million deficit for 1974-75 on KZSU's Campus Conference last
night. Miller expressed confidence that academic quality won't be cut along with
excess costs.
"We will consider the impact of
every kind of expenditure," Miller
said. "We will look at everything very
carefully."
Miller observed that the University
had long expected a deficit for next
year, but that "the current financial
Situation is somewhat of a surprise."
He noted that the Univeristy had
expected a $300,000 deficit for last
year and had hoped to balance its

budget this year.
But last spring, when the
administration became aware of the
impact of inflation and the stock
market collapse, the University
attempted to cut costs averaging three
percent in current operating budgets.
Miller observed that the
cooperation of University departments
in the cost-cutting program prevented
the deficit from climbing as high as
$1.5 million.
Similar economies are necessary if
this year's deficit is not to exceed $1.6
million, he added.
An Opportunity?
Miller claimed that the present
financial dilemma might allow the
University to rearrange its programs so
creatively that the University might
actually emerge stronger than it would
otherwise have been.
"We can use our present pfoblem as
an opportunity, perhaps unwanted but
still real, to find the strong base on
which our successors will build in the
future.
"By the application of our own
intelligence and good sense we can
have the unusual experience of turning
adversity into virtue."
In other discussion last night, Miller
said he disagrees with the contention
of Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Clossen that faculty members
are unconcerned about the quality of
undergraduate education.
Noting that increased interest in
graduate education during the 1960s
caused some faculty members to lose
interest in undergraduate education,
Miller asserted that the situation now
has changed.
"There is renewed interest among
administrators and senior faculty in
undergraduate teaching," Miller said.
"We do have a program that balances
undergraduate education with
graduate education."

Miller claimed that the present
financial dilemma might allow the
University to rearrange its programs so
creatively that the University might
actually emerge stronger than it would
otherwise have been.
"We can use our present pfoblem as
an opportunity, perhaps unwanted but
still real, to find the strong base on
which our successors will build in the
future.
"By the application of our own
intelligence and good sense we can
have the unusual experience of turning
adversity into virtue."
In other discussion last night, Miller
said he disagrees with the contention
of Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Clossen that faculty members
are unconcerned about the quality of
undergraduate education.
Noting that increased interest in
graduate education during the 1960s
caused some faculty members to lose
interest in undergraduate education,
Miller asserted that the situation now
has changed.
"There is renewed interest among
administrators and senior faculty in
undergraduate teaching," Miller said.
"We do have a program that balances
undergraduate education with
graduate education."
Further University budget
reductions "are likely to be painful
and have noticeable impact," Acting
President William JVliller declared last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
Earlier in the day, Miller revealed
that the University anticipates a $1.6
million deficit for the 1974-75 fiscal
year. Miller also confirmed that the
University sustained a $300,000
deficit last year, more than twice what
was expected.
The deficits will be covered by a

contingency fund established during
the University's year of expansion in
the late 1950s and early 19605, Miller
explained.
The fund, which originally included
$6 million, has been reduced to
approximately $2.7 million during the
last five years. It will lose another
$300,000 as a result of the current
deficit, Miller added.
Although Miller noted that he is
"not in a position to identify
particular programs" that might be
sliced, he strongly emphasized that the

University will cut strictly academic
programs only as a "last resort."
But Miller admitted that programs
in every area have been cut to the
greatest extent possible short of
sacrificing quality during the last five
years.
Not Much Fat
"I do not believe that "there is
much 'fat' in the Stanford budget,"
Miller said. "Most of the obvious
targets for budget reduction were
discovered during the five years of
BAP [Budget Adjustment Program],

and what remains in the budget is
largely well justified."
Referring to a new three-year, $lO
million austerity program, Miller said
that "no reasonably predictable
combination of income improvement
and reduction in administrative areas
will close ... the gap."
Miller acknowledged the
University's financial problems might
hasten further deterioration of the
student-faculty ratio.
But noting that "our competition is
having trouble, too," Miller affirmed
that Stanford is still in a strong
position to attract the highest quality
faculty.
Problem Solving Ability
"We have the capacity to solve our
problems as well or better than they
[other universities]," Miller said. He
added that he doesn't expect the ratio
to increase drastically.
Miller noted that rising interest
rates and construction costs have
hindered plans to construct the
University's proposed $25 million
library. But Miller said until the
Budget Priorities Commission studies
the situation, it is impossible to
determine how plans will be affected.
Future plans for Tresidder Union
and construction of new student
housing will also receive the attention
of the committee, Miller said.

FINANCIAL CRlSlS—Acting President William Miller discussed the University's
projected $1.6 million deficit for 1974-75 on KZSU's Campus Conference last
night. Miller expressed confidence that academic quality won't be cut along with
excess costs.
"We will consider the impact of
every kind of expenditure," Miller
said. "We will look at everything very
carefully."
Miller observed that the University
had long expected a deficit for next
year, but that "the current financial
Situation is somewhat of a surprise."
He noted that the Univeristy had
expected a $300,000 deficit for last
year and had hoped to balance its

budget this year.
But last spring, when the
administration became aware of the
impact of inflation and the stock
market collapse, the University
attempted to cut costs averaging three
percent in current operating budgets.
Miller observed that the
cooperation of University departments
in the cost-cutting program prevented
the deficit from climbing as high as
$1.5 million.
Similar economies are necessary if
this year's deficit is not to exceed $1.6
million, he added.

night. Miller expressed confidence that academic quality won't be cut along with
excess costs.
"We will consider the impact of
every kind of expenditure," Miller
said. "We will look at everything very
carefully."
Miller observed that the University
had long expected a deficit for next
year, but that "the current financial
Situation is somewhat of a surprise."
He noted that the Univeristy had
expected a $300,000 deficit for last
year and had hoped to balance its

budget this year.
But last spring, when the
administration became aware of the
impact of inflation and the stock
market collapse, the University
attempted to cut costs averaging three
percent in current operating budgets.
Miller observed that the
cooperation of University departments
in the cost-cutting program prevented
the deficit from climbing as high as
$1.5 million.
Similar economies are necessary if
this year's deficit is not to exceed $1.6
million, he added.
An Opportunity?
Miller claimed that the present
financial dilemma might allow the
University to rearrange its programs so
creatively that the University might
actually emerge stronger than it would
otherwise have been.
"We can use our present pfoblem as
an opportunity, perhaps unwanted but
still real, to find the strong base on
which our successors will build in the
future.
"By the application of our own
intelligence and good sense we can
have the unusual experience of turning
adversity into virtue."
In other discussion last night, Miller
said he disagrees with the contention
of Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Michael Clossen that faculty members
are unconcerned about the quality of
undergraduate education.
Noting that increased interest in
graduate education during the 1960s
caused some faculty members to lose
interest in undergraduate education,
Miller asserted that the situation now
has changed.
"There is renewed interest among
administrators and senior faculty in
undergraduate teaching," Miller said.
"We do have a program that balances
undergraduate education with
graduate education."
Further University budget
reductions "are likely to be painful
and have noticeable impact," Acting
President William JVliller declared last
night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
Earlier in the day, Miller revealed
that the University anticipates a $1.6
million deficit for the 1974-75 fiscal
year. Miller also confirmed that the
University sustained a $300,000
deficit last year, more than twice what
was expected.
The deficits will be covered by a

contingency fund established during
the University's year of expansion in
the late 1950s and early 19605, Miller
explained.
The fund, which originally included
$6 million, has been reduced to
approximately $2.7 million during the
last five years. It will lose another
$300,000 as a result of the current
deficit, Miller added.
Although Miller noted that he is
"not in a position to identify
particular programs" that might be
sliced, he strongly emphasized that the

University will cut strictly academic
programs only as a "last resort."
But Miller admitted that programs
in every area have been cut to the
greatest extent possible short of
sacrificing quality during the last five
years.
Not Much Fat
"I do not believe that "there is
much 'fat' in the Stanford budget,"
Miller said. "Most of the obvious
targets for budget reduction were
discovered during the five years of
BAP [Budget Adjustment Program],

and what remains in the budget is
largely well justified."
Referring to a new three-year, $lO
million austerity program, Miller said
that "no reasonably predictable
combination of income improvement
and reduction in administrative areas
will close ... the gap."
Miller acknowledged the
University's financial problems might
hasten further deterioration of the
student-faculty ratio.
But noting that "our competition is
having trouble, too," Miller affirmed
that Stanford is still in a strong
position to attract the highest quality
faculty.
Problem Solving Ability
"We have the capacity to solve our
problems as well or better than they
[other universities]," Miller said. He
added that he doesn't expect the ratio
to increase drastically.
Miller noted that rising interest
rates and construction costs have
hindered plans to construct the
University's proposed $25 million
library. But Miller said until the
Budget Priorities Commission studies
the situation, it is impossible to
determine how plans will be affected.
Future plans for Tresidder Union
and construction of new student
housing will also receive the attention
of the committee, Miller said.
