# Republicans Look To The Future
## 
### William Ross 
One of the most tenacious myths of
American politics is that Republicans are
cohesive and less torn by inner quarrels than
are Democrats. As one not so perceptive
pundit once observed, "The first
commandment of the GOP is 'thou shalt not
criticize a fellow Republican.'" This
aphorism is nonsense.
Following their defeat in last week's
voting, Republicans are indulging in
post-election recriminations and
self-evaluation. Although this potentially
could prove disastrous to party unity,
creative analysis could restore GOP electoral
viability.
One significant test of the party's ability
to make constructive changes while retaining
fundamental unity is the imminent struggle
over the House Republican leadership.
Rep. Peter Peyser (R-N.Y.) is urging his
colleagues to oust conservative Minority
Leader John J. Rhodes (R-Ariz.). Peyser
claims that Rhodes' political views hurt GOP
congressional candidates and inhibit House
Republicans from responding to progressive
social issues. Many liberal and moderate
Republicans are openly supporting Rep. John
Anderson (R-Ill.) for the leadership.
Although Anderson still denies that he is
seeking the post, he too has expressed
considerable discontentment with Rhodes'
policies and on numerous occasions has
openly challenged Rhodes' positions on
pending legislation.
Lesson of History
Anyone who doubts that the House GOP
would actually dump a leader need only be
reminded of the ouster of Charles Halleck of
Indiana following the 1964 Goldwater
debacle.
The aging Halleck was deposed largely in
reaction to his flaccid leadership. Replacing
Halleck was Gerald Ford, who won a narrow
victory to become minority leader. Although
Rhodes voted against Ford, the two men
were soon closely allied in their opposition to
Great Society programs and Rhodes assumed
increasing responsibility within the party.
Upon Ford's confirmation as vice
president 11 months ago, Rhodes was
unanimously elected to succeed Ford in the

House GOP leadership.
After 22 years in Congress, Rhodes was an
acknowledged expert in House procedure and
was widely respected for his capacity for
hard work. Although Rhodes had associated
himself with the Goldwater wing of the
party, he was known for his adeptness at
compromise and his ability to placate all
elements within the party.

Obviously, however, Rhodes could not
have become House GOP leader at a worse
time. The Watergate controversy seemed to
threaten the party's survival and the
leadership was helpless to stop GOP defeats
in special elections. Although Rhodes was
personally piqued by the arrogance of
Nixon's "Palace Guard" and the snubbing of
Congress, he persistently defended Nixon's
"investigation" of the scandal.
When the Judiciary Committee's
deliberations opened, Rhodes announced
that he would carefully study the evidence of
the transcripts before making any public
statement regarding impeachment.
Throughout the summer, Rhodes was placed
in an awkward dilemma. No matter what
his decision regarding
impeachment, he was certain to antagonize
large segments of the party and endanger his
own leadership position.
Fortunately for Rhodes, the fatal Nixon
tapes were released on the very day on which
he had intended to announce his decision.
With the President's guilt no longer in
question, Rhodes was able to join the vast
majority of his colleagues in demanding
impeachment.
Lack of Leadership
Although Rhodes' bid for time during the
impeachment controversy saved him from
widening party divisions, it subjected him to
charges of having failed to take a genuine
leadership role.

Rhodes has never attempted to coerce
Republicans into voting the party line. "I
don't like to twist arms and I'm not very
good at it anyway," he is fond of telling the
press. But many Republicans insist that if the
party is to serve as an effective opposition,
the leadership must try harder to achieve

GOP unity on crucial House votes.
During the past year, Rhodes has clearly
aligned himself with conservative House
Republicans. He opposed the plan of Rep.
Morris Udall (D—Ariz.) to provide partial
public campaign financing through federal
matching grants to be paid for by tax
write-offs. He supported a measure to cut off
all federal operating subsidies for existing
mass transit systems and opposed a bill to
increase public service appropriations.
Rhodes has made some overtures towards
the party's liberal elements who have voted
differently than Rhodes on key issues. He
supported the budget reorganization bill and
appointed a diverse group of Republicans to
serve on the new House Budget Committee.
Although no one could have prevented the
loss of 43 Republican seats in the election,
the defeat convinced many House
Republicans that only a switch toward a
liberal leader could revive the party's
effectiveness in Congress. Worst of all for
Rhodes, the Republicans who retired or were
defeated in the election tended to be his
strong conservative supporters.
But despite complaints about Rhodes'
ineffectiveness and conservatism, he has
much in his favor.
Rhodes also enjoys a close relationship
with President Ford, which could prove
important in making the Administration
more responsive to a congressional opinion.
Furthermore, the atypical events of the
past year provide a poor basis on which to
test Rhodes' leadership.
Perhaps most importantly, the ouster of
Rhodes would only add to the divisiveness in
the party and create disaffection among
conservatives.
Nevertheless, the challenge to Rhodes is a
healthy sign of life among House
Republicans. It may spur the leadership into
more readily accepting the view of the
so-called "left-wing" of the Republican
Party. This could only help to revive the
party's fortunes.

Rep. Peter Peyser (R-N.Y.) is urging his
colleagues to oust conservative Minority
Leader John J. Rhodes (R-Ariz.). Peyser
claims that Rhodes' political views hurt GOP
congressional candidates and inhibit House
Republicans from responding to progressive
social issues. Many liberal and moderate
Republicans are openly supporting Rep. John
Anderson (R-Ill.) for the leadership.
Although Anderson still denies that he is
seeking the post, he too has expressed
considerable discontentment with Rhodes'
policies and on numerous occasions has
openly challenged Rhodes' positions on
pending legislation.
Lesson of History
Anyone who doubts that the House GOP
would actually dump a leader need only be
reminded of the ouster of Charles Halleck of
Indiana following the 1964 Goldwater
debacle.
The aging Halleck was deposed largely in
reaction to his flaccid leadership. Replacing
Halleck was Gerald Ford, who won a narrow
victory to become minority leader. Although
Rhodes voted against Ford, the two men
were soon closely allied in their opposition to
Great Society programs and Rhodes assumed
increasing responsibility within the party.
Upon Ford's confirmation as vice
president 11 months ago, Rhodes was
unanimously elected to succeed Ford in the

House GOP leadership.
After 22 years in Congress, Rhodes was an
acknowledged expert in House procedure and
was widely respected for his capacity for
hard work. Although Rhodes had associated
himself with the Goldwater wing of the
party, he was known for his adeptness at
compromise and his ability to placate all
elements within the party.

Obviously, however, Rhodes could not
have become House GOP leader at a worse
time. The Watergate controversy seemed to
threaten the party's survival and the
leadership was helpless to stop GOP defeats
in special elections. Although Rhodes was
personally piqued by the arrogance of
Nixon's "Palace Guard" and the snubbing of
Congress, he persistently defended Nixon's
"investigation" of the scandal.
When the Judiciary Committee's
deliberations opened, Rhodes announced
that he would carefully study the evidence of
the transcripts before making any public
statement regarding impeachment.
Throughout the summer, Rhodes was placed
in an awkward dilemma. No matter what
his decision regarding
impeachment, he was certain to antagonize
large segments of the party and endanger his
own leadership position.
Fortunately for Rhodes, the fatal Nixon
tapes were released on the very day on which
he had intended to announce his decision.
With the President's guilt no longer in
question, Rhodes was able to join the vast
majority of his colleagues in demanding
impeachment.
Lack of Leadership
Although Rhodes' bid for time during the
impeachment controversy saved him from
widening party divisions, it subjected him to
charges of having failed to take a genuine
leadership role.

Rhodes has never attempted to coerce
Republicans into voting the party line. "I
don't like to twist arms and I'm not very
good at it anyway," he is fond of telling the
press. But many Republicans insist that if the
party is to serve as an effective opposition,
the leadership must try harder to achieve

GOP unity on crucial House votes.
During the past year, Rhodes has clearly
aligned himself with conservative House
Republicans. He opposed the plan of Rep.
Morris Udall (D—Ariz.) to provide partial
public campaign financing through federal
matching grants to be paid for by tax
write-offs. He supported a measure to cut off
all federal operating subsidies for existing
mass transit systems and opposed a bill to
increase public service appropriations.
Rhodes has made some overtures towards
the party's liberal elements who have voted
differently than Rhodes on key issues. He
supported the budget reorganization bill and
appointed a diverse group of Republicans to
serve on the new House Budget Committee.
Although no one could have prevented the
loss of 43 Republican seats in the election,
the defeat convinced many House
Republicans that only a switch toward a
liberal leader could revive the party's
effectiveness in Congress. Worst of all for
Rhodes, the Republicans who retired or were
defeated in the election tended to be his
strong conservative supporters.
But despite complaints about Rhodes'
ineffectiveness and conservatism, he has
much in his favor.
Rhodes also enjoys a close relationship
with President Ford, which could prove
important in making the Administration
more responsive to a congressional opinion.
Furthermore, the atypical events of the
past year provide a poor basis on which to
test Rhodes' leadership.
Perhaps most importantly, the ouster of

serve on the new House Budget Committee.
Although no one could have prevented the
loss of 43 Republican seats in the election,
the defeat convinced many House
Republicans that only a switch toward a
liberal leader could revive the party's
effectiveness in Congress. Worst of all for
Rhodes, the Republicans who retired or were
defeated in the election tended to be his
strong conservative supporters.
But despite complaints about Rhodes'
ineffectiveness and conservatism, he has
much in his favor.
Rhodes also enjoys a close relationship
with President Ford, which could prove
important in making the Administration
more responsive to a congressional opinion.
Furthermore, the atypical events of the
past year provide a poor basis on which to
test Rhodes' leadership.
Perhaps most importantly, the ouster of
Rhodes would only add to the divisiveness in
the party and create disaffection among
conservatives.
Nevertheless, the challenge to Rhodes is a
healthy sign of life among House
Republicans. It may spur the leadership into
more readily accepting the view of the
so-called "left-wing" of the Republican
Party. This could only help to revive the
party's fortunes.

One of the most tenacious myths of
American politics is that Republicans are
cohesive and less torn by inner quarrels than
are Democrats. As one not so perceptive
pundit once observed, "The first
commandment of the GOP is 'thou shalt not
criticize a fellow Republican.'" This
aphorism is nonsense.
Following their defeat in last week's
voting, Republicans are indulging in
post-election recriminations and
self-evaluation. Although this potentially
could prove disastrous to party unity,
creative analysis could restore GOP electoral
viability.
One significant test of the party's ability
to make constructive changes while retaining
fundamental unity is the imminent struggle
over the House Republican leadership.
Rep. Peter Peyser (R-N.Y.) is urging his
colleagues to oust conservative Minority
Leader John J. Rhodes (R-Ariz.). Peyser
claims that Rhodes' political views hurt GOP
congressional candidates and inhibit House
Republicans from responding to progressive
social issues. Many liberal and moderate
Republicans are openly supporting Rep. John
Anderson (R-Ill.) for the leadership.
Although Anderson still denies that he is
seeking the post, he too has expressed
considerable discontentment with Rhodes'
policies and on numerous occasions has
openly challenged Rhodes' positions on
pending legislation.
Lesson of History
Anyone who doubts that the House GOP
would actually dump a leader need only be
reminded of the ouster of Charles Halleck of
Indiana following the 1964 Goldwater
debacle.
The aging Halleck was deposed largely in
reaction to his flaccid leadership. Replacing
Halleck was Gerald Ford, who won a narrow
victory to become minority leader. Although
Rhodes voted against Ford, the two men
were soon closely allied in their opposition to
Great Society programs and Rhodes assumed
increasing responsibility within the party.
Upon Ford's confirmation as vice
president 11 months ago, Rhodes was
unanimously elected to succeed Ford in the

House GOP leadership.
After 22 years in Congress, Rhodes was an
acknowledged expert in House procedure and
was widely respected for his capacity for
hard work. Although Rhodes had associated
himself with the Goldwater wing of the
party, he was known for his adeptness at
compromise and his ability to placate all
elements within the party.

Obviously, however, Rhodes could not
have become House GOP leader at a worse
time. The Watergate controversy seemed to
threaten the party's survival and the
leadership was helpless to stop GOP defeats
in special elections. Although Rhodes was
personally piqued by the arrogance of
Nixon's "Palace Guard" and the snubbing of
Congress, he persistently defended Nixon's
"investigation" of the scandal.
When the Judiciary Committee's
deliberations opened, Rhodes announced
that he would carefully study the evidence of
the transcripts before making any public
statement regarding impeachment.
Throughout the summer, Rhodes was placed
in an awkward dilemma. No matter what
his decision regarding
impeachment, he was certain to antagonize
large segments of the party and endanger his
own leadership position.
Fortunately for Rhodes, the fatal Nixon
tapes were released on the very day on which
he had intended to announce his decision.
With the President's guilt no longer in
question, Rhodes was able to join the vast
majority of his colleagues in demanding
impeachment.
Lack of Leadership
Although Rhodes' bid for time during the
impeachment controversy saved him from
widening party divisions, it subjected him to
charges of having failed to take a genuine
leadership role.

Rhodes has never attempted to coerce
Republicans into voting the party line. "I
don't like to twist arms and I'm not very
good at it anyway," he is fond of telling the
press. But many Republicans insist that if the
party is to serve as an effective opposition,
the leadership must try harder to achieve

GOP unity on crucial House votes.
During the past year, Rhodes has clearly
aligned himself with conservative House
Republicans. He opposed the plan of Rep.
Morris Udall (D—Ariz.) to provide partial
public campaign financing through federal
matching grants to be paid for by tax
write-offs. He supported a measure to cut off
all federal operating subsidies for existing
mass transit systems and opposed a bill to
increase public service appropriations.
Rhodes has made some overtures towards
the party's liberal elements who have voted
differently than Rhodes on key issues. He
supported the budget reorganization bill and
appointed a diverse group of Republicans to
serve on the new House Budget Committee.

loss of 43 Republican seats in the election,
