# Stanford Ignores Asian Americans
## 
### Teri Lee 
Once more, the University has
compiled data on the campus
minority groups blacks,
chicanos and native Americans.
And once more, Asian Americans
are glaringly ignored by the
University as a minority group. •
Why is this so? Perhaps the
University sees a large Asian
American middle class in the
United States and assumes that no
minority financial aid is needed.
Perhaps the University sees 60
percent of the Asian American
students in the sciences and
accepts the widespread myth that
Asian Americans have "made it"
in society and have no special
minority needs.
Or perhaps the University has
not removed its blinders and seen
that many Asian Americans still
live in ghetto areas such as
Chinatowns and require special
financial consideration to enter
Stanford, as do other minority
groups.
Fails To Ask Why?
Or perhaps the University has
never bothered to ask why there
are so few Asian Americans in the
humanities and the arts, or
acknowledge the lack of Asian
American faculty in these areas.
This way, potential role models to
Asian Americans who do not want
to pursue a science-oriented career
are missing.
Stanford has been notoriously
reluctant to respond to needs of
Asian Americans on campus.
Apparently, it will only aid those
minorities which create an outcry
so vocal that it cannot be ignored.
Why are Asian Americans such
a "silent minority"? Historically,
racist California in the late 1800s
made silent acquiescence by
Chinese a prerequisite for survival.
The internment experience for
Japanese Americans in the 1940s
caused similar "don't rock the
boat" sentiments.
These two basic experiences
have created a generation of Asian
Americans, quiet not because of
middle-class contentment, but

because of fear. Their children,
now college students, have also
been ingrained with this legacy of
silence.
Reasons Not Acknowledged
The University has failed to
acknowledge that Asian
Americans have these reasons for
their silence, and instead has
decided to ignore the needs of
its Asian American
constituency. Consider:
—Affirmative action
recruitment of minority freshmen
has never included Asian
Americans. A small group of
concerned students is currently
acting voluntarily as information
officers to Asian American high
school students during
Thanksgiving, winter and summer
breaks.
—The only Asian American
studies courses so far have come

through short-term Undergraduate
Special or SWOPSI courses. In no
other University departments are
the history or contributions of
Asian Americans taught.
—While Cowell employs black,
chicano, Native American and
women counselors or social
workers, it still lacks an Asian
American representative. Dr.
Allan Seid, an Asian American
psychologist, worked at Cowell
part time last spring, but it was
acknowledged that his
appointment was only temporary.
No Clear Policy
—There is no clear policy
concerning affirmative action
hiring of Asian American faculty,
yet Asian Americans were
included by the Unviersity in its
affirmative action report to HEW.
Why?
—The just-published Minority

Report states: "While members of
the Asian American community
participated in this report, the
University's commitment to
increase opportunities for
minority groups has not been
extended to this group." Why?
It is obvious that the
University is putting out a token
interest in dealing with the needs
of Asian American students.
Perhaps it believes that if the
problem is ignored, it will cease to
exist. This narrow-minded, obtuse
thinking has created much of the
rift between the Asian American
students and the University.
It is only through cooperation,
sensitivity and a genuine intent to
correct the inequalities that
Stanford will adequately serve all
of its minorities on campus.
