# Bonfire Is Back--Hurrah!
## 
### Jim Dewell 
Despite three years of both successful and
unsuccessful attempts by environmentalists, rain
storms (possibly Prince Lightfoot's mode of
revenge) and the Pacific Eight (scheduling last
year's big game during Thanksgiving) to cancel the
Bonfire, it will again burn this year in the midst of
Lake Lagunita.
As in the past, the construction and guarding of «
the bonfire will be the responsibility of freshmen.
All upperclassmen however, will be welcome and are
encouraged to participate in the building of this
year's bonfire.
Construction will begin Wednesday, Nov. 20,
when crews will erect a network of telephone poles
into a giant "C." That afternoon and all day
Thursday and Friday student driven trucks will
haul wooden pallets and crates, collected
throughout the Bay Area, to Lake Lagunita, where
others will use these to fill the empty shell of the
"C."
When construction is stopped on Friday, the
structure will be sprayed with oil in preparation for
the lighting ceremony that night.
Freshmen dorms will again receive the honor of
guarding the bonfire during the night from Cal's

midnight rooters, who have in the past succeeded in
lighting the fire early. (Watching the sunrise, with
cold beer in hand, while huddled around a roaring
fire in the middle of the lake is a time not soon
forgotten.)
Respecting the viewpoint of the
environmentalists, this year's committee has
decided that the bonfire will be considerably
smaller than the fire three years ago. That fire, an
engineering report showed, dumped only 4.7 tons
of contaminants into the atmosphere, about one
tenth the amount of contaminants emitted from
San Francisco Airport per day three years ago.
In an effort to help compensate for the bonfire's
air pollution, bonfire watchers are encouraged to
cut back on the use of their cars on Thursday and
Friday and refrain from their nightly fires at home
during that week.
The resurgence of enthusiasm for the bonfire
shows that while many traditions have been
muffled, they have not yet died among the students
and alumni of Stanford.
