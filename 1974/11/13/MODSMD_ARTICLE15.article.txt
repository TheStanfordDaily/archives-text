Cartoon Anti-Frats?
Editor:
I am appalled by the opinions
editors' choice of a cartoon
printed in the Nov. 8 Daily. I refer
specifically to the Gene Mater
cartoon, depicting two women
wailing past a fraternity having
pigs in front representing the
fraternity members.
Not only is this inappropriate
at the present time, but it is a
distasteful display of prejudice on
the part of the opinions editor
who chose to print the inaccurate
caricature.
I resent the stereotypical
intimation of the cartoon and
hope that others seeing this
disgusting piece of
commercialization will realize the
outdated symbolism. Although
one cannot deny that individual
members of fraternities have an
interest in the women on campus,
the interest is hardly exclusive to
fraternity residents.
One might accurately have
depicted two women walking past
any group of males in any part of
the world, eliciting the type of
response drawn in the cartoon.
The cartoon was not
specifically directed at any
particular fraternity on campus
but at fraternities in general. As
members of fraternities on this
campus can hardly be put in the
same category with the obnoxious
fraternities on other campuses, we
resent Mater's trite, generalizing
graffiti.

I feel that the cartoon was
deplorable and an example of
contempt bred of ignorance. The
cartoon depicts a house with
Greek letters on the porch and
pigs wallowing in the front yard.
Two students, one of whom
says, "Same old bunch," are
walking past. This prejudicial
caricature reinforces two
erroneous impressions students
may have concerning fraternities.
First, it either intentionally or
unintentionally conveys the
impression that all fraternity men
are slovenly. Such is certainly not
the case. Boors, unfortunate as
they may be, are to be found in
every residence on campus. Some
fraternities, which have no maid
service, are cleaner than dorms
which have daily maid service.
Secondly, it falsely conveys the
notion that fraternity men and
other students are mutually
exclusive. This cartoon portrays
fraternity men as bad and others
as far superior. Such a situation
clearly does not exist at Stanford.
It is additionally unfortunate that
this mythical dichotomy is
reinforced at a time when many
students incorrectly perceive the
housing question to be a case of
the fraternities against everyone
else.
University policy, not the
fraternities, has created the
present housing inequity. I hope
that political sarcasm published in
the Daily can in the future be
constrained within the limits of
truth.
