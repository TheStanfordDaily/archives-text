## What To Do If Attacked: Scream, Escape, Rim 
### BETTY GOODWIN Second of Two Parts 
"If someone came up and
grabbed me, my initial reaction
would be to go for the groin and
devastate him," said one student
on defending herself.
She's right..
"Whatever you do to throw an
attacker off guard is a chance for
you to run," explained Debbie
Whittemore, Stanford Police
officer and instructor in
self-defense.
Escape is the main objective of
self-defense, experts say, even
when you are driving. As soon as
someone jump!>s in the car, "bail
out the other door," Whittemore
says. Even if the car is moving,
"take off your seat belt and jump
out." Palo Alto Police Crime
Prevention Officer Christophe:
Durkin says, if an attacker has ;
knife "hit the breaks and throv

him through the dash."
Both Whittemore and Durkin
agree that the only time a woman
should be submissive to an
assailant is when he has gun.
When you are not in a car and
the assailant has a gun, "y° u ' ve
had it," says Durkin. "I'm not
going to argue with a gun, because
even if you do escape, he'll
shoot."
With A Gun
Unless you are very strong and
feel confident that you can take
on a man with a gun, it's best to
"let him (the attacker) do his
thing," explains Whittemore.
"When you consider what could
be done to you, it [rape] is not
that big a deal," she says. "It's a
very hard attitude to take, but
you've got to realize what
happens to some girls."
Most attacks are made with
knives, Durkin says, and there are
things you can do to save yourself
from injury. However,
Whittemore adds, "There are all
kinds of 'weirdos,' " and no one
can tell you exactly what to do
when the time comes.
It ail depends on the assailant.
For example, with drug
addicts, "the ones that shake," it's
best simply to comply, because
"they do anything," Whittemore
explains. But if "a guy is cool,
you can just talk to him and you
can probably get away without
getting hurt."
In any case, no matter what
the attacker is like, you want to
get away.
Simple Scream
One of the best and simplest
things you can do is scream. In

the first place, a scream is a call
for attention. Campus police
patrol with their windows open.
"We'll hear you," Whittemore
says. "There's someone out there
all the time." In addition to
campus police there are now six
to eight "community service
officers" unarmed volunteers
who patrol the campus on foot.
Whittemore adds that you
should scream something other
than "help me," which is less
discernible than a "plain loud
scream." Sergeant Michael Mee,
project director of the Palo Alto
Police Department's rape study,
adds, "I would yell 'fire,' then
people come out and take a
look."
Not only will screaming attract
attention, but "quite often it will
scare him (the assailant) away,"
Durkin says.
The first 15-30 seconds are
the most crucial in making a
successful escape, Durkin
explains. Most attacks are made
with knives, so when the attacker
is "six feet away versus one foot
away, you have your most critical
seconds time to turn and run."
Hurt Him
If the attacker has gotten hold
of you, you want to hurt him so
that for a few moments he doesn't
think about holding you, but
thinks about the pain, according
to Whittemore.
The thing to do if you are
carrying a pointed or rigid object
like a rat-tail comb, metal nail file,
letter opener, umbrella or even a
flashlight, tightly rolled magazine,
book or purse, is to grab onto it

with two hands and make a quick,
jabbing blow upward into the
stomach, below the ribs.
If you swing aimlessly, as
opposed to one hard blow, the
assailant will only hold on tighter.
"You need something to make an
instant punch or kick. You want
to shock him or immobilize him
temporarily so you can run
away," says Durkin. Other useful
objects to use as weapons are a set
of keys (see photo) or a flashlight to
make a punch with or to shine in
someone's eyes.
Open Palm
Use your hands and feet if you
are not carrying anything.
An open palm directed straight up
the nose is very painful, and you
"might break the nose or bring
tears to the eyes," says Durkin.
"You're talking about five
seconds of pain. In five seconds
you can run a long distance."
If someone has pinned your
arms, you can kick at a knee cap
or shin with your foot (if you use
your toe, you might miss), grind
your heal into a foot, swing with
your head or dislodge your arms
by quickly raising them and
twisting them around (this is
called the "windmill").
Directing pain to the groin is
disputable. Durkin believes that
the groin is a "bad place." "If you
miss," he says, "the assailant is
mad."
Whittemore disagrees. If you
have a free hand, she said, "Grab,
yank and run."
Confidence
Ron Blankenhorn, teaching
specialist here in sejf-defense and
the Martial Arts, has a different

approach to defending yourself:
"Self-defense is confidence and
nerve centers." The first half of
his Roble Gym course,
"Self-Defense for Women," deals
primarily with an investigation of
feminity.
According to Blankenhorn, it is
important "to understand the role
you've played throughout your
life that is the first thing that
must be overcome."
He teaches his students to
reject the "helpless stereotype"
and to accept yourself "for what
you are," no matter what your
size and weight.
Whittemore and Durkin agree
tha women should stay away from"
learning the martial arts unless
they are going to devote a lot of
time to keeping up with the skills.
Blankenhorn disagrees.
"I don't just teach you things
you have to memorize. These you
would forget. I teach you the
principles why the movements
work."
style of
self-defense, ju jitsu, is rarely
taught, he said. More commonly
taught courses are in aikido,
t'ai-chi, judo and karate, which
focus on competition, sport or
exercise.
"The Martial Arts and
self-defense are two different
things," he explains.
Escape Not Defeat
In his class, Blankenhorn
stresses learning the pressure
points. You learn "how to take a
250 pound man and make him
fly," he said. "You aim for certain
points of the body with certain
hand positions instead of having

random attack." The primary goal
is "to escape, not to defeat."
Blankenhorn's courses,
"Self-Defense for Women" and
"Basic Self-Defense" (for men and
women), are offered every
quarter.
Whittemore will offer group
self-defense classes lasting four to
six weeks beginning in January. If
a group is interested they can
contact the campus police.
Durkin teaches a one session

course where he answers questions
and shows the movie, Nobody's
Victim. The class is held either at
the Palo Alto Police Department
or in your home, and is offered at
any hour.
Mid-Peninsula Women Against
Rape (WAR) gives a Monday
evening class at 7:30 p.m. at 4151
Alma in Palo Alto. They also
provide a rape crisis line
(493-RAPE) for information and
help.
