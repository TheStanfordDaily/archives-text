# Prof Reconciles Images Of Abe Lincoln
## 
### R. MARK VAN ALLEN 
History Prof. Don E. Fehrenbacher
Monday night named Abraham Lincoln the
"central figure" of a major historical paradox
that confuses racism with the problem of
slavery.
Fehrenbacher, considered one of
America's leading scholars on the history of
the Civil War and Lincoln, told about 75
people at Tresidder Memorial Union that
Lincoln opposed slavery because it bound a
human being, not because it was a racist form
of bondage.
Lincoln, Fehrenbacher said, was
considered the "uncommon common man,"
a "puzzling mixture of often conflicting
qualities." Despite these disparities, all
wanted Lincoln on their side, and "Lincoln
had come to be everybody's grandfather."
Calling Lincoln a "representative genius,'
Fehrenbacher asserted that Lincoln's image

in the early 20th century was becoming "a
blend of blue and gray," and was eliciting
much sympathy from the South.
Because Lincoln had "issued the
Emancipation Proclamation with much
reluctance," he was allied with racism, but in
the North, Lincoln was still thought of as
"The Great Emancipator," Fehrenbacher
said.
The Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s
propagated the radical interpretation of
Lincoln as a racist, Fehrenbacher said.
To substantiate this interpresentation he
quoted Lincoln as saying, "I as much as any
man prefer the superior position of the white
race."
Fehrenbacher also noted that Lincoln had
never "recognized segregated America" and
had recommended voluntary immigration to
Africa for the American Negro.
Reconciling the different
interpresentations of Lincoln as rascist or

emancipatory, Fehrenbacher said, "We can't
be sure that Lincoln's speeches in the 1850s
didn't reflect political expediency" or
"verbal bowing" to certain factions.
Lincoln, he said, read the "signs of the
times" and worked towards his "paramount
objective which was to save the Union."
Fehrenbacher found Lincoln to "both
share and rise above the social doctrine of his
time" in order to save the Union. He said
Lincoln was responsive to bilateral pressure.
Fehrenbacher concluded that Lincoln had
not understood racism in America. "Lincoln
had given little thought to the accommodation
of the freed man, as shown in his
reconstruction plans," he said.
Fehrenbacher authored Prelude to
Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850s, and The
Changing Image of Lincoln in American
Historiography, as well as editing History and
American Society, a collection of essays by the
late Stanford History Prof. David M. Potter.

said.
The Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s
propagated the radical interpretation of
Lincoln as a racist, Fehrenbacher said.
To substantiate this interpresentation he
quoted Lincoln as saying, "I as much as any
man prefer the superior position of the white
race."
Fehrenbacher also noted that Lincoln had
never "recognized segregated America" and
had recommended voluntary immigration to
Africa for the American Negro.
Reconciling the different
interpresentations of Lincoln as rascist or

emancipatory, Fehrenbacher said, "We can't
be sure that Lincoln's speeches in the 1850s
didn't reflect political expediency" or
"verbal bowing" to certain factions.
Lincoln, he said, read the "signs of the
times" and worked towards his "paramount
objective which was to save the Union."
Fehrenbacher found Lincoln to "both
share and rise above the social doctrine of his
time" in order to save the Union. He said
Lincoln was responsive to bilateral pressure.
Fehrenbacher concluded that Lincoln had
not understood racism in America. "Lincoln
had given little thought to the accommodation
of the freed man, as shown in his
reconstruction plans," he said.
Fehrenbacher authored Prelude to
Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850s, and The
Changing Image of Lincoln in American
Historiography, as well as editing History and
American Society, a collection of essays by the
late Stanford History Prof. David M. Potter.

Monday night named Abraham Lincoln the
"central figure" of a major historical paradox
that confuses racism with the problem of
slavery.
Fehrenbacher, considered one of
America's leading scholars on the history of
the Civil War and Lincoln, told about 75
people at Tresidder Memorial Union that
Lincoln opposed slavery because it bound a
human being, not because it was a racist form
of bondage.
Lincoln, Fehrenbacher said, was
considered the "uncommon common man,"
a "puzzling mixture of often conflicting
qualities." Despite these disparities, all
wanted Lincoln on their side, and "Lincoln
had come to be everybody's grandfather."
Calling Lincoln a "representative genius,'
Fehrenbacher asserted that Lincoln's image

in the early 20th century was becoming "a
blend of blue and gray," and was eliciting
much sympathy from the South.
Because Lincoln had "issued the
Emancipation Proclamation with much
reluctance," he was allied with racism, but in
the North, Lincoln was still thought of as
"The Great Emancipator," Fehrenbacher
said.
