## Students Mirror State Vote 
### MARK FUNK 
Stanford students mirrored both
nation- and state-wide voting trends as
they gave Democrats (and one
maverick Republican) hefty pluralities
in last Tuesday's general election,
according to figures released this week
by the Santa Clara County registrar of
voters.
Incumbent Democratic Sen. Alan
Cranston, who was re-elected with "64
percent of the popular vote in
California, was supported by a large
part of the campus electorate as he
defeated GOP state Sen. H.L.

Richardson by about an eight to one
count, polling 86.2 percent of the
vote.
Cranston's was the most impressive
victory during an election year which
saw but two Republican candidates
win in any of Stanford's 13 precincts.
One Republican that did, Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey (R-Menlo, Park), an
early foe of the Nixon administration,
swept all 13 of the precincts as he
swamped Santa Clara mayor Gary
Gillmor. McCloskey tallied 85.2
percent of the campus vote, 15
percent higher than his district-wide

majority, to Gillmor's 13.9 percent.
Brown Smashes Floumoy
In the race for governor, which
some people felt would be closest on
campus, Democrat Edmund G. Brown,
a two percentage-point winner
state-wide, bested former GOP
controller Houston I. Flournoy by 39
percentage points here at Stanford.
Brown, whose margin of victory was
better than two to one, garnered 68.2
percent of the vote to Flournoy's
29.4.
Officials in the Santa Clara County
Registar of Voters Department
characterized student turnout as
"pretty low—probably less than 50
percent." In Stanford precincts, voter
turnout was about 55 percent. A high
turnout in the Univeristy's residential
areas was credited with raising the
figure.
The trend was pretty much as
county officials described it in the
precincts that include Stanford's
dormitory complexes and at other
institutions in the county incluidng
San Jose State and Santa Clara.
"At Stanford, part of the low
student turnout should be attributed
to people who have moved away from
undergraduate residences since 1972,"
one official said. It could be attributed
partly to apathy, too, he conceded.
Little Variance
On the precinct level, voting trends
varied little from precinct to precinct
and reflected fairly accurately the
collective will of the Stanford
electorate.
In the mild upset, the U.S. Senate
candidate from the Peace and
Freedom Party, Gayle Justice,
outpolled Richardson, a former
member of the John Birch Society, 15
votes to 13 in Precinct 2543, which
includes Roble Hall. Cranston took the
precinct with 148 votes.
In other state-wide races, Stanford
voters gave three to one pluralities to
Democrats March Fong, nominee for
secretary of state; John Dymally,
lieutenant governor; Jess Unruh,
treasurer, and John Norris, attorney
general.
The only other Republican to win
on campus was controller candidate
William Bagley, who lost the office to
Democrat Ken Cory.

Incumbent Democratic Sen. Alan
Cranston, who was re-elected with "64
percent of the popular vote in
California, was supported by a large
part of the campus electorate as he
defeated GOP state Sen. H.L.

Richardson by about an eight to one
count, polling 86.2 percent of the
vote.
Cranston's was the most impressive
victory during an election year which
saw but two Republican candidates
win in any of Stanford's 13 precincts.
One Republican that did, Rep. Paul
N. McCloskey (R-Menlo, Park), an
early foe of the Nixon administration,
swept all 13 of the precincts as he
swamped Santa Clara mayor Gary
Gillmor. McCloskey tallied 85.2
percent of the campus vote, 15
percent higher than his district-wide

majority, to Gillmor's 13.9 percent.
Brown Smashes Floumoy
In the race for governor, which
some people felt would be closest on
campus, Democrat Edmund G. Brown,
a two percentage-point winner
state-wide, bested former GOP
controller Houston I. Flournoy by 39
percentage points here at Stanford.
Brown, whose margin of victory was
better than two to one, garnered 68.2
percent of the vote to Flournoy's
29.4.
Officials in the Santa Clara County
Registar of Voters Department
characterized student turnout as
"pretty low—probably less than 50
percent." In Stanford precincts, voter
turnout was about 55 percent. A high
turnout in the Univeristy's residential
areas was credited with raising the
figure.
The trend was pretty much as
county officials described it in the
precincts that include Stanford's
dormitory complexes and at other
institutions in the county incluidng
San Jose State and Santa Clara.
"At Stanford, part of the low
student turnout should be attributed
to people who have moved away from
undergraduate residences since 1972,"
one official said. It could be attributed
partly to apathy, too, he conceded.
Little Variance
On the precinct level, voting trends
varied little from precinct to precinct
and reflected fairly accurately the
collective will of the Stanford
electorate.
In the mild upset, the U.S. Senate
candidate from the Peace and
Freedom Party, Gayle Justice,
outpolled Richardson, a former
member of the John Birch Society, 15
votes to 13 in Precinct 2543, which
includes Roble Hall. Cranston took the
precinct with 148 votes.
In other state-wide races, Stanford
voters gave three to one pluralities to
Democrats March Fong, nominee for
secretary of state; John Dymally,
lieutenant governor; Jess Unruh,
treasurer, and John Norris, attorney
general.
The only other Republican to win
on campus was controller candidate
William Bagley, who lost the office to
Democrat Ken Cory.
Stanford students mirrored both
nation- and state-wide voting trends as
they gave Democrats (and one
maverick Republican) hefty pluralities
in last Tuesday's general election,
according to figures released this week
by the Santa Clara County registrar of
voters.
