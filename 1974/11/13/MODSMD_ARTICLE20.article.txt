## No Big Surprise; Cordova To Start 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
No one held his breath before
Jack Christiansen made his
unstartling announcement at the
Northern California Football
jVriters luncheon yesterday.
"Mike Cordova will start at
quarterback— despite what you
read in the papers," Chris said.
' That despite came after
another blast at Christiansen by
columnist Glenn Dickey in
yesterday's San Francisco
Chronicle. Dickey, in writing that
Guy Benjamin should start at QB,
said Christiansen "hinted he might
start Benjamin this week against
Oregon."
- Dickey said the major reasons
Gordova was starting were that
Cordova threatened to transfer if
he didn't start and that "Benjamin
■is thought to be an
anti-Establishment character by
the Stanford coaching staff."
Neither of the above points, of
course, have been confirmed or
denied by the people who would
-know.
, Dickey's column did, however,
.contain two major inaccuracies,
has shown.
_ First, his column stated that
Cordova was only recruited as a

quarterback by Stanford.
Cordova, the only person who
would know, said earlier this year
that he was recruited "about
evenly" for quarterback and
linebacker.
Secondly, Dickey charged that
Christiansen inquired "at one
point if it would be possible to
cut off The Chronicle press
credentials," after an earlier
Dickey column criticizing Chris.
But members of Stanford's
sports information staff insisted
yesterday that Christiansen made
the comment as an obvious joke,
and that all persons present
interpreted it as such.
At any rate, Chris did hint he
would remove Cordova early in
the game Saturday if he failed to
produce against Oregon.

Cardinal Notes: Think writing
about the quarterback question is
beating a dead horse? Well, the
San Francisco Examiner yesterday
ran a story about the possible
return of the Indian as Stanford's
mascot. The move stands the
(exact) same chance of happening
as Big Chief Richard Lyman being
fired, since Lyman has said he
won't let it happen .
