# JV's Battered, But Still Win
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
"They were nothing but a
bunch of cheap shot artists," said
offensive tackle Tim Grolle after
Monday's game in San Luis
Obispo in which the Stanford
junior varsity football team
defeated Cal Poly, 31-21. The win
raised the Cards' record to 3-0.
The win took its toll on the JV
ball club, however, as Grolle and
nose guard Stu Center had cut
chins that required stitches,
punter Brad Fox suffered a cut lip
and two loose lower teeth and
linebackers Dan McCann and Ben
Hallock sustained knee injuries.
"We don't know what the
extent of injury is on McCann and
Hallock, but we will probably
have to move fullback' Tom Pyke
and someone else to the
linebacker positions of McCann
and Hallock for next week's game
against Cal," Single said.
The JV's third straight win was
actually decided one minute into
the fourth quarter as quarterback
Steve Dils bootlegged the ball one
yard for a touchdown. The play
capped a 16-minute span in which

the Cards blanked Cal Poly, 24-0,
to jump out to a 31-6 lead.
Cal Poly made a late run at the
JV's in the fourth quarter as they
ran 20 yards for one touchdown
and returned a punt 55 yards for
another. Stanford totally
dominated the statistics, as was
evident from the 408 yards
totalled by the Cards to 258 for
Cal Poly.
In its three games, Stanford
has tallied an average of 400 yards
to a little under 200 for its
opponents.
"I am particularly pleased with
the work of my assistants; Don
Frease [defensive line], Jim
Kaffen [defensive backs], Steve
White [offensive line], Doug Jena
[offensive backs], Dave Ottmar
[quarterbacks and special teams]
and Steve Hagata [receivers].
They have done a heck of a job
out there with the players," Single
said.
Fine Efforts
Single said he was happy with
all the players and thought they
worked as a unit. He noted the
play of linebacker Drew
Nosworthy, strong safety Ralph
Phillips and linebacker Mike
Yancey on defense, and running

backs Greg Smith, Tom
Oberhelman and John Finley on
offense.
Smith led the rushers with 87
yards in 10 carries while
Oberhelman chalked up 63 yards
in five carries and Finley 33 yards
in 10 carries.
According to Single, tight end
Mark Hoaglin, defensive end
Geoff Kieburtz and wide receiver
James Lofton, who caught six
passes for 114 yards, might suit
up next week for the varsity
against Cal. All played
outstanding games Monday.
Cal Game
For now, though, the JV's are
licking their wounds. They'll close
out their season at home next
Monday at 2 p.m. against a
winless Cal JV squad nicknamed
"the ramblers."
"I am not sure why they are
called 'the ramblers.' Their
record doesn't seem to say that
they are, but they always play a
good game against us," Single
said.
Cal, however, is going to have a
hard time rambling over this
Cardinal JV team, which
according to Single has been
rated "the best JV team in years."
