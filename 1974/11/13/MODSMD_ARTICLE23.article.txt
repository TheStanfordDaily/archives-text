# On Wednesday Morning
## Start Benjamin 
### Tim Ferguson 
Guy Benjamin, if he chooses to stay here as he says he will,
apparently will spend four years at Stanford playing second fiddle to
Mike Cordova.
Such would truly be a shame, for -Benjamin is Stanford's best
quarterback.
There, I've said it. I've crossed a bridge I thought I never would. I
believe that Cordova, on whose shoulders everyone based their hopes
for the Cardinals' future, ought to be replaced.
Last year such a thought was inconceivable. I followed Cordova's
exploits with the junior varsity, which were nothing short of
miraculous. He was magic. He was another ... I won't siy it.
Something has happened. Only against Washington has Cordova
not pressed himself to the point of inconsistency. Head coach Jack
Christiansen admits this, but maintains a faith that Cordova might
always "come through with the big play."
I used to believe that, too. But the facts don't bear it out. Cordova
couldn't make one yard for a first down on the Cards' last drive
against UCLA and only Benjamin could get them a touchdown at
all. Last week, Cordova was unable to come up with a big play to
reverse USC's early momentum. Again, only Benjamin could get a
touchdown (though admittedly against SC's second team).
My illusions have been shattered. Far in the back of my mind, I
still may agree with a former Stanford player knowledgeable of the
situation who says, "Cordova is potentially probably the best
quarterback."
But it's time Stanford started living in the present. The Rose Bowl
was last week, and we missed that. A winning season (for whatever
intangible benefit it is) is this week. And as the former player says,
"Each week I keep waiting for him [Cordova] to relax. And each
week it's the same."
We're wrong to keep waiting. If Benjamin is the better quarterback
right now (and game statistics indicate he is), then let's start him, right
now.
Cordova can win the job back. Benjamin can lose it. Jerry
Waldvogel can get it. Cordova is desirous of the exposure necessary to
land a pro football contract, and may leave Stanford if benched
permanently. But is that worse than keeping Benjamin and not
playing him? I'd say no.
It's time for Christiansen to quit banking on a hope, and frankly,
that's all it is. It's time to reward performance, not to nurture a
build-up.
It's tipie for Guy Benjamin.

quarterback."
But it's time Stanford started living in the present. The Rose Bowl
was last week, and we missed that. A winning season (for whatever
intangible benefit it is) is this week. And as the former player says,
"Each week I keep waiting for him [Cordova] to relax. And each
week it's the same."
We're wrong to keep waiting. If Benjamin is the better quarterback
right now (and game statistics indicate he is), then let's start him, right
now.
Cordova can win the job back. Benjamin can lose it. Jerry
Waldvogel can get it. Cordova is desirous of the exposure necessary to
land a pro football contract, and may leave Stanford if benched
permanently. But is that worse than keeping Benjamin and not
playing him? I'd say no.
It's time for Christiansen to quit banking on a hope, and frankly,
that's all it is. It's time to reward performance, not to nurture a
build-up.
It's tipie for Guy Benjamin.

STILL WAITING—Stanford quarterbacks Guy Benjamin (10) and
Jerry Waldvogel have been spending a lot of time on the sidelines this
year, and many (if not most) fans think that Benjamin should start.
Guy Benjamin, if he chooses to stay here as he says he will,
apparently will spend four years at Stanford playing second fiddle to
Mike Cordova.
Such would truly be a shame, for -Benjamin is Stanford's best
quarterback.
There, I've said it. I've crossed a bridge I thought I never would. I
believe that Cordova, on whose shoulders everyone based their hopes
for the Cardinals' future, ought to be replaced.
Last year such a thought was inconceivable. I followed Cordova's
exploits with the junior varsity, which were nothing short of
miraculous. He was magic. He was another ... I won't siy it.
Something has happened. Only against Washington has Cordova
not pressed himself to the point of inconsistency. Head coach Jack
Christiansen admits this, but maintains a faith that Cordova might
always "come through with the big play."
I used to believe that, too. But the facts don't bear it out. Cordova
couldn't make one yard for a first down on the Cards' last drive
against UCLA and only Benjamin could get them a touchdown at
all. Last week, Cordova was unable to come up with a big play to
reverse USC's early momentum. Again, only Benjamin could get a
touchdown (though admittedly against SC's second team).
My illusions have been shattered. Far in the back of my mind, I
still may agree with a former Stanford player knowledgeable of the
situation who says, "Cordova is potentially probably the best
quarterback."
