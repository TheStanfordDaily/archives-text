# Hosts SJS Tomorrow
## Hockey Team Tests Ability 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
Every team must prove its
ability at some point in the
season. For the Stanford field
hockey squads, the test comes
tomorrow against visiting San Jose
State.
The Card varsity, with a 5-1
record, takes on the 3-1 Spartans
at 3 p.m. SJS defeated Stanford
1-0 in a shortened preseason
tournament game. In the same
tourney the Card junior varsity
beat its Spartan counterpart by a
1-0 score. Tomorrow's JV match
will start at 1:30 p.m.
The Spartans have been going
through a rebuilding year. Only
five players out of 11 return from
last year's squad, but the Spartans
have been practicing for two
months. Offense is their strong
suit and they use the link system,
which has occasionally given the
Card defense trouble this season.
The Stanford varsity has had
its difficulties in the past month.
At the start of the season the
Cards improved for several games,
but then team play became
sloppy, reaching a low point in
the loss at Humboldt State. After
a strong first half in last Tuesday's
game at Sacramento State, the
team suffered a relapse for part of
the second half but came back to
win 5-3.
The Cards have had problems
with instability. Coach Shirley
Schoof has used four different
starting lineups in the six
"conference games.
The left side of the front line
has been a particular problem.

After only one game, freshman
Sukie Jackson was lost for the
season with a knee injury. Since
then Kathy Levinson Ann Walker
and Lyse Strnad have all tried
Jackson's left inner spot with
varying degrees of success. At the
moment Walker seems to have the
job. Levinson, an excellent ball
handler, plays at center forward
and Strnad at her accustomed
wing, but this could well change
by tomorrow.
At Sac State, Schoof also
shook up the defense, moving Dee
Gates, who has played fullback
for two seasons, to halfback and
inserting Carol Ferguson in the
fullback slot.
The Spartan junior varisty has
a 2-1 record. Only one member of
last year's squad returns.

The JV's haven't played a
conference opponent in nearly
three weeks, so they are a
somewhat unknown quantity
despite their 3-0 record.
The junior varsity is anchored
by junior goalie Cathleen Chase,
who has allowed no goals this
season and is probably the equal
in ability of varsity goalkeeper
Betsy Morris. Chase plays a very
relaxed goal, backing up a defense
which makes mistakes periodically
but is perhaps stronger than the
offense.
The JV front line has also been
undergoing various switches in
recent practices, with at least
three different playersâ€”Kathleen
Christensen, Cheryl Johnston and
captain Connie Butler-all taking
cracks at the center forward spot.
