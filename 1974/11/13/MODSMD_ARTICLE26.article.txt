# Women's Swim Team Finally Sinks Davis
## 
### JEFF LITTLE 
Despite winning 10 of 12
events and setting five school
records, it took a win in the final
event of the day before the
women's swim team could come
away with a 73-63 victory over
stubborn UC-Davis yesterday.
In that final event, the 400
freestyle relay, Ann Brodell, Vicki
Hayes, Kathy Heinz and Janet
Stewart combined for a school
record 3:49.2 to clinch the meet.
A relieved coach Betsy Weeks
said afterward, "... I didn't
decide until yesterday to put our
strong swimmers in the last relay.
I'm glad I did ..."
The win extended the Cards'
dual meet winning streak to 13,
over a three year period. It also
virtually assured them of first
place in the NCIAC dual meet
standings, as they need only to
beat a weak University of the
Pacific team next week to earn
their third consecutive unbeaten
season.
The meet, held yesterday at
the DeGuerre pools, was filled
with top efforts by the Card
swimmers. Ann Brodell won the
100, 200 and 400 yard freestyle
events, tying her own school
record in the 400. Vicki Hayes
was also a triple winner, nabbing
the 50 and 100 breaststroke and
the 50 butterfly.
Megan Edwards set two school
records in winning the 50
backstroke (30.6) and 100
backstroke (1:04.9). Holly
Houston, Nan Leuschel, Kathy
Kriegshauser and Holly Edwards
teamed for the team's other win,
the 200 free relay. Weeks cited
Houston and Kriegshauser for
"very strong efforts."
Davis, which beat the Cards at
the NCIAC Relays three weeks
ago, proved to be every bit as

tough as Weeks expected.
Lacking first place power,
Davis used its superior depth to
take many vital seconds and
thirds, making the meet a close
one.
After travelling to UOP next
Thursday, the team returns to
prepare for the NCIAC
Championships, scheduled for
Dec. 6 and 7 at San Jose State.
Stanford will be going for its
third straight NCIAC crown. To
get it, the Cards will need top
efforts from everyone on the
squad because, according to
Weeks, "... It will be the fifth
and sixth place points that will
make the difference."
