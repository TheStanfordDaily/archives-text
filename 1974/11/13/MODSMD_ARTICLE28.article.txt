## Sorry, No Cockroaches, Just Facts 
### Glenn Garvin 
And now, once again, it is time to turn to
the tragic saga of the World Football League;
or, how to build a football league out of
tinsel, sawdust and airplane glue and then
watch it collapse around your head.
No doubt the mailbox will be full of nasty
letters tomorrow (what other kind of letters
ever come here?) reading "Garvin, you stupid
ass, you already did that column a month ago
and if you can't think of something new, like
calling John McKay a cockroach, why don't
you just quit?"
Well, it's true, the WFL has already been
dealt with here. But there's something
compelling about it; like, say, watching a
cripple drown, or a horde of rats eat a baby.
You just can't tear your eyes away.
In case you haven't been keeping up
well, don't worry. The news is pretty much
the same, except worse, or better, depending
on how you feel about these things. One
team is officially dead. One is officially out
for the rest of the year. One is officially
owned by the league itself, which is searching
like crazy for a buyer, because it can't meet
the payroll.
That's not an uncommon problem around
the WFL. Portland, Southern California,
Birmingham, Chicago and Charlotte are all
behind in salaries, as well as Florida the
franchise owned by the league. In addition,
the Birmingham team owes its county tax
assessor $16,000 in back taxes and can't play
this week unless it pays up. And the dry
cleaners just repossessed all the uniforms of
the Charlotte franchise because it didn't pay
its cleaning bill. Honest.
Still Sanity
Amidst all this chaotic collapse, one WFL
owner proved there is still sanity in
professional sports. Tom Origer, who owns

the Chicago Fire, said he thought it was
stupid to put eight teams in the playoffs
when there were only 10 in the whole league.
So he canceled Chicago's last game and told
everyone to go home.
Good show, Tom.
The imminant death of the WFL raises a
whole passel of fascinating questions. Like
what's going to happen to guys like John
Huarte? Huarte, if you recall, was last heard
of as Notre Dame's All-American quarterback
of 1964. From there he leapt into the NFL
woodwork, and surfaced only this summer to
become a star for the Memphis Southmen.
This is a fascinating question.
Unfortunately, the answer is not quite so
neat. The John Huartes will probably go back
to washing cars, moving furniture and
whatever other work there is for guys who
are 6-foot-4, 225 pounds and severely
lacking in brainpower.
Where Do They Go?
Another fascinating question and one
with a less mundane answer is what's going
to happen to the scores of NFL veterans
currently playing out their option to jump to
WFL teams next season.
If there is no next season as it seems
there won't be just where will they go and
what will they do? Some, like Paul Warfield,
JimKiickand Larry Csonka, who jumped en
masse from Miami to Memphis, have already
signed contracts with men sufficiently rich to
guarantee payment no matter what happens
to the WFL.
Presumably they can spend next winter
eating popcorn and playing croquet.
But for others, who signed on with
financially shaky organizations that can't
even pay their players right now like Ted
Kwalick and Ken Stabler it will be

disastrous if the league folds. Their teams afe
already grooming replacements and planning
to ease them out of the picture; many Qf
them may find they have no place to retug*
to. And many for instance, Dick Witcher and
John Isenbarger have already been cut by
teams that figured they weren't worth
keeping around.
Bargain Basement
In some cases this situation will lead td
real bargain-basement ripoffs for teams that
gambled cheaply and won. Green Bay got
All-Pro linebacker Ted Hendricks for
practically nothing, since Baltimore decided
not to hold onto him while he played out his
option. If -the WFL goes under, Green Bay
will have won a first-rate addition to its
linebacking corps at no cost.
I
Even a team as inept as San Francisco
could profit. Someone in the 49er front
office, showing remarkable (and completely
out-of-character) foresight drafted UCLA
running back James McAlister in the seventh
round last year, even though he had already
signed with Southern California of the WFL.
Normally McAlister would have gone a lot
higher but most teams weren't willing to
waste a draft choice on him. If the 49ers g§t
him next year, it will be one of their bigge§t
coups in recent history.
Anything that can make the 49er front
office look good or even like it's run by
normal, intelligent human beings can't be
all bad.
So, as you can see, the WFL is good for
something after all. It may be the salvation of
a lot of management dummies next year, and
it provokes clever, witty, perceptive columns
like this one. If you just look at it the right
way, the WFL can be lots of fun.

cripple drown, or a horde of rats eat a baby.
You just can't tear your eyes away.
In case you haven't been keeping up
well, don't worry. The news is pretty much
the same, except worse, or better, depending
on how you feel about these things. One
team is officially dead. One is officially out
for the rest of the year. One is officially
owned by the league itself, which is searching
like crazy for a buyer, because it can't meet
the payroll.
That's not an uncommon problem around
the WFL. Portland, Southern California,
Birmingham, Chicago and Charlotte are all
behind in salaries, as well as Florida the
franchise owned by the league. In addition,
the Birmingham team owes its county tax
assessor $16,000 in back taxes and can't play
this week unless it pays up. And the dry
cleaners just repossessed all the uniforms of
the Charlotte franchise because it didn't pay
its cleaning bill. Honest.
Still Sanity
Amidst all this chaotic collapse, one WFL
owner proved there is still sanity in
professional sports. Tom Origer, who owns

the Chicago Fire, said he thought it was
stupid to put eight teams in the playoffs
when there were only 10 in the whole league.
So he canceled Chicago's last game and told
everyone to go home.
Good show, Tom.
The imminant death of the WFL raises a
whole passel of fascinating questions. Like
what's going to happen to guys like John
Huarte? Huarte, if you recall, was last heard
of as Notre Dame's All-American quarterback
of 1964. From there he leapt into the NFL
woodwork, and surfaced only this summer to
become a star for the Memphis Southmen.
This is a fascinating question.
Unfortunately, the answer is not quite so
neat. The John Huartes will probably go back
to washing cars, moving furniture and
whatever other work there is for guys who
are 6-foot-4, 225 pounds and severely
lacking in brainpower.
Where Do They Go?
Another fascinating question and one
with a less mundane answer is what's going
to happen to the scores of NFL veterans
currently playing out their option to jump to
WFL teams next season.
If there is no next season as it seems
there won't be just where will they go and
what will they do? Some, like Paul Warfield,
JimKiickand Larry Csonka, who jumped en
masse from Miami to Memphis, have already
signed contracts with men sufficiently rich to
guarantee payment no matter what happens
to the WFL.
Presumably they can spend next winter
eating popcorn and playing croquet.
But for others, who signed on with
financially shaky organizations that can't
even pay their players right now like Ted
Kwalick and Ken Stabler it will be

disastrous if the league folds. Their teams afe
already grooming replacements and planning
to ease them out of the picture; many Qf
them may find they have no place to retug*
to. And many for instance, Dick Witcher and
John Isenbarger have already been cut by
teams that figured they weren't worth
keeping around.
Bargain Basement
In some cases this situation will lead td
real bargain-basement ripoffs for teams that
gambled cheaply and won. Green Bay got
All-Pro linebacker Ted Hendricks for
practically nothing, since Baltimore decided
not to hold onto him while he played out his
option. If -the WFL goes under, Green Bay
will have won a first-rate addition to its
linebacking corps at no cost.
I
Even a team as inept as San Francisco
could profit. Someone in the 49er front
office, showing remarkable (and completely
out-of-character) foresight drafted UCLA
running back James McAlister in the seventh
round last year, even though he had already
signed with Southern California of the WFL.
Normally McAlister would have gone a lot
higher but most teams weren't willing to
waste a draft choice on him. If the 49ers g§t
him next year, it will be one of their bigge§t
coups in recent history.
Anything that can make the 49er front
office look good or even like it's run by
normal, intelligent human beings can't be
all bad.
So, as you can see, the WFL is good for
something after all. It may be the salvation of
a lot of management dummies next year, and
it provokes clever, witty, perceptive columns
like this one. If you just look at it the right
way, the WFL can be lots of fun.
And now, once again, it is time to turn to
the tragic saga of the World Football League;
or, how to build a football league out of
tinsel, sawdust and airplane glue and then
watch it collapse around your head.
No doubt the mailbox will be full of nasty
letters tomorrow (what other kind of letters
ever come here?) reading "Garvin, you stupid
ass, you already did that column a month ago
and if you can't think of something new, like
calling John McKay a cockroach, why don't
you just quit?"

the Birmingham team owes its county tax
assessor $16,000 in back taxes and can't play
this week unless it pays up. And the dry
cleaners just repossessed all the uniforms of
the Charlotte franchise because it didn't pay
its cleaning bill. Honest.
Still Sanity
Amidst all this chaotic collapse, one WFL
owner proved there is still sanity in
professional sports. Tom Origer, who owns

the Chicago Fire, said he thought it was
stupid to put eight teams in the playoffs
when there were only 10 in the whole league.
So he canceled Chicago's last game and told
everyone to go home.
Good show, Tom.
The imminant death of the WFL raises a
whole passel of fascinating questions. Like
what's going to happen to guys like John
Huarte? Huarte, if you recall, was last heard
of as Notre Dame's All-American quarterback
of 1964. From there he leapt into the NFL
woodwork, and surfaced only this summer to
become a star for the Memphis Southmen.
This is a fascinating question.
Unfortunately, the answer is not quite so
neat. The John Huartes will probably go back
to washing cars, moving furniture and
whatever other work there is for guys who
are 6-foot-4, 225 pounds and severely
lacking in brainpower.
Where Do They Go?
Another fascinating question and one
with a less mundane answer is what's going
to happen to the scores of NFL veterans
currently playing out their option to jump to
WFL teams next season.
If there is no next season as it seems
there won't be just where will they go and
what will they do? Some, like Paul Warfield,
JimKiickand Larry Csonka, who jumped en
masse from Miami to Memphis, have already
signed contracts with men sufficiently rich to
guarantee payment no matter what happens
to the WFL.
Presumably they can spend next winter
eating popcorn and playing croquet.
But for others, who signed on with
financially shaky organizations that can't
even pay their players right now like Ted
Kwalick and Ken Stabler it will be

disastrous if the league folds. Their teams afe
already grooming replacements and planning
to ease them out of the picture; many Qf
them may find they have no place to retug*
to. And many for instance, Dick Witcher and
John Isenbarger have already been cut by
teams that figured they weren't worth
keeping around.
Bargain Basement
In some cases this situation will lead td
real bargain-basement ripoffs for teams that
gambled cheaply and won. Green Bay got
All-Pro linebacker Ted Hendricks for
practically nothing, since Baltimore decided
not to hold onto him while he played out his
option. If -the WFL goes under, Green Bay
will have won a first-rate addition to its
linebacking corps at no cost.
I
Even a team as inept as San Francisco
could profit. Someone in the 49er front
office, showing remarkable (and completely
out-of-character) foresight drafted UCLA
running back James McAlister in the seventh
round last year, even though he had already
signed with Southern California of the WFL.
Normally McAlister would have gone a lot
higher but most teams weren't willing to
waste a draft choice on him. If the 49ers g§t
him next year, it will be one of their bigge§t
coups in recent history.
Anything that can make the 49er front
office look good or even like it's run by
normal, intelligent human beings can't be
all bad.
So, as you can see, the WFL is good for
something after all. It may be the salvation of
a lot of management dummies next year, and
it provokes clever, witty, perceptive columns
like this one. If you just look at it the right
way, the WFL can be lots of fun.
And now, once again, it is time to turn to
the tragic saga of the World Football League;
or, how to build a football league out of
tinsel, sawdust and airplane glue and then
watch it collapse around your head.
No doubt the mailbox will be full of nasty
letters tomorrow (what other kind of letters
ever come here?) reading "Garvin, you stupid
ass, you already did that column a month ago
and if you can't think of something new, like
calling John McKay a cockroach, why don't
you just quit?"
Well, it's true, the WFL has already been
dealt with here. But there's something
compelling about it; like, say, watching a
cripple drown, or a horde of rats eat a baby.
You just can't tear your eyes away.
In case you haven't been keeping up
well, don't worry. The news is pretty much
the same, except worse, or better, depending
on how you feel about these things. One
team is officially dead. One is officially out
for the rest of the year. One is officially
owned by the league itself, which is searching
like crazy for a buyer, because it can't meet
the payroll.
That's not an uncommon problem around
the WFL. Portland, Southern California,
Birmingham, Chicago and Charlotte are all
behind in salaries, as well as Florida the
franchise owned by the league. In addition,
the Birmingham team owes its county tax
assessor $16,000 in back taxes and can't play
this week unless it pays up. And the dry
