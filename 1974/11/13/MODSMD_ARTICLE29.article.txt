Coal Strike Settlement Possible
WASHINGTON The coal industry made a new
contract offer last night which it said could settle
the day-old nationwide coal strike.
A United Mine Workers officer said he was
optimistic a settlement could be reached "very
soon."
The negotiations recessed shortly after midnight
and UMW President Arnold Miller said he had not
had time to study the offer carefully and would
return today.
But Harry Patrick, UMW secretary-treasurer, said
the offer is "pretty good."
At this point I'm very, very optimistic that we
can wrap this thing up very soon," Patrick told
newsmen.
The industry made its proposal near the end of a
12-hour bargaining day on the first day of the
nationwide coal strike which already was producing
layoffs in the railroad and steel industries.
Chief industry negotiator Guy Farmer said the
new offer was not put forth "as a bargaining
gambit" but as a package that could settle this
contract dispute.
U.N. Vote Expels South Africa
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The U.N. General
Assembly voted last night to exclude South Africa
from further participation in this year's assembly
session.
Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika
this month's president of the assembly, ruled that
South Africa no longer is entitled to its seat.
Then, on a vote demanded by the United States,
assembly members voted 91-22 with 19 abstentions
to uphold his ruling. The Americans protested that
the ruling violated the U.N. Charter.
The Algerian diplomat said he based his ruling on
a Sept. 30 vote denying the South Africa delegation
General Assembly credentials.
But Bouteflike said his ruling would "leave open
the status of South Africa as a member of the
United Nations."
This was because on Oct. 30, the United States,
Britain and France vetoed a move in the Security
Council to expel the South Africans mainly because
of their white minority government's racial policies.
Kalmbach Motives Humanitarian?
WASHINGTON The Watergate trial judge
questioned Herbert W. Kalmbach yesterday about
how he could have believed that the thousands of
dollars he passed on to the Watergate break-in
defendants was solely for humanitarian purposes
and not hush money.
Hours earlier in his testimony about the money,
Kalmbach broke down in tears, and U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica called a brief recess so
Kalmbach could leave the room and regain his
composure.
When the trial resumed, Sirica asked, "Mr.
Kalmbach, is it your testimony that what you
learned from then White House counsel John W.

Dean that all these thousands of dollars were going
to be used for legal attorneys' fees and humanitarian
purposes?"
"Yes, sir," Kalmbach replied.
Kalmbach said that on June 28, 1972, eleven
days after the burglary at Democratic National
Committee headquarters, Dean summoned him to
Washington for "a very important assignment."
Dean and Kalmbach met the next day in a park a
block from the White House and Kalmbach said the
presidential counsel told him, "Herb, so far as these
Watergate defendants, we've got to help these
fellows. It's important we provide them with
attorneys' fees and family support. It's the
humanitarian thing to do."
Dean pledged Kalmbach to absolute secrecy and
was quoted as telling him "this was a CRP Nixon
re-election committee operation."
Over the next three months Kalmbach disbursed
$220,000.
Ford Drops Gibson
WASHINGTON - President Ford agreed
yesterday to abandon Andrew E. Gibson as his
choice to be federal energy administrator but
promised to appoint him "to another responsible
position in government" if FBI checks raise no
obstacles.
In a letter to Gibson, who asked that his
appointment be withdrawn because of controbersy
over his $BBO,OOO severance agreement with
Philadelphia Interstate Oil Transport Co., Ford said
he intends to announce a new nominee for the
Federal Energy Administration post "very soon."
In a rather bizarre development, Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said White House staff chief Donald
Rumsfield "has volunteered to take the blame" for
Gibson's selection, even though Nessen contended
Rumsfield knew nothing at the time about Gibson's
10-year agreement with the Philadelphia firm.
Rockefeller Faces Senate Panel
WASHINGTON - With a fresh pledge of support
from President Ford, vice president designate
Nelson A Rockefeller goes before a Senate panel
today to explain his family's role in publication of a
book critical of a campaign opponent.
In opening a nationally broadcast second series
of hearings on the nomination, the Senate Rules
Committee also' plans to ask for a full explanation
from Rockefeller on his nearly $2 million in gifts
and $507,656 in loans to frineds and associates over
the past 17 years.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., chairman of
the committee, has indicated there is no chance the
panel will take a vote on the Rockefeller
nomination before the end of the month.
Palestinian Gets Tight Security
NEW YORK Palestinian guerrilla leader Yasir
Arafat's top lieutenant arrived in New York last
night, preceding his chieftain here amidst the
tightest security net in the city's history.

An American Jewish group already had marked
Arafat for death, and one of its members was
arrested in connection with the threat.
Farouk Al-Kaddumi, second to Arafat in
command of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
arrived at Kennedy airport in early evening.
Meanwhile, Arafat left Cairo in a special plane
during the day, en route to the opening of the
United Nations Palestine debate today.
His travel plans to New York were not disclosed
because of the security precautions. But a State
Department spokesman said there was a possibility
that he might meet with U.S. officials while he is in
the United States.
Sanctions Against Cuba Continue
QUITO, Ecuador Hemispheric foreign
ministers yesterday rejected the lifting of
10-year-old economic and political sanctions against
Cuba.
The United States said no clear evidence exists
that Fidel Castro's regime has stopped exporting
revolution.
The measure failed after five fruitless days of
meetings under auspices of the Organization of
America States.
The foreign ministers came to Quito at the
request of Costa Rica, Colombia and Venezuela,
who declared that Cuba no longer presents the
threat of revolution to the Americas that it did in
1964 when the OAS first invoked the sanctions.
The final vote was 12-3 with six abstentions
two, votes short of the necessary two-thirds 14
votes needed to pass the resolution.
Supporters of an end to the sanctions
immediately issued a declaration saying that the
voting was "an absurd procedure."
Garvey Is National League MVP
NEW YORK Steve Garvey of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, who lived out a boyhood dream to become
a major league star, was named the National
League's Most Valuable Player by the Baseball
Writers Association of America yesterday.
Garvey received 270 points in balloting by a
24-man panel of the BBWAA composed of two
writers from each of the National League's 12 cities.
The writers voted for 10 players with a first-place
vote worth 14 points, second place nine, third place
eight, etc.
Garvey, the Dodgers' first baseman, won by a
comfortable margin over base-stealing king Lou
Brock of the St. Louis Cardinals, who finished
second with 233 points. Mike Marshall, the Dodgers'
relief ace who won the National League Cy Young
award last week, was third with 146 points.
Today's Wieather

Little change in temperatures. Highs both days in
the mid 60s to low 70s. North to northeast winds

elsewhere.

this month's president of the assembly, ruled that
South Africa no longer is entitled to its seat.
Then, on a vote demanded by the United States,
assembly members voted 91-22 with 19 abstentions
to uphold his ruling. The Americans protested that
the ruling violated the U.N. Charter.
The Algerian diplomat said he based his ruling on
a Sept. 30 vote denying the South Africa delegation
General Assembly credentials.
But Bouteflike said his ruling would "leave open
the status of South Africa as a member of the
United Nations."
This was because on Oct. 30, the United States,
Britain and France vetoed a move in the Security
Council to expel the South Africans mainly because
of their white minority government's racial policies.
Kalmbach Motives Humanitarian?
WASHINGTON The Watergate trial judge
questioned Herbert W. Kalmbach yesterday about
how he could have believed that the thousands of
dollars he passed on to the Watergate break-in
defendants was solely for humanitarian purposes
and not hush money.
Hours earlier in his testimony about the money,
Kalmbach broke down in tears, and U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica called a brief recess so
Kalmbach could leave the room and regain his
composure.
When the trial resumed, Sirica asked, "Mr.
Kalmbach, is it your testimony that what you
learned from then White House counsel John W.

Dean that all these thousands of dollars were going
to be used for legal attorneys' fees and humanitarian
purposes?"
"Yes, sir," Kalmbach replied.
Kalmbach said that on June 28, 1972, eleven
days after the burglary at Democratic National
Committee headquarters, Dean summoned him to
Washington for "a very important assignment."
Dean and Kalmbach met the next day in a park a
block from the White House and Kalmbach said the
presidential counsel told him, "Herb, so far as these
Watergate defendants, we've got to help these
fellows. It's important we provide them with
attorneys' fees and family support. It's the
humanitarian thing to do."
Dean pledged Kalmbach to absolute secrecy and
was quoted as telling him "this was a CRP Nixon
re-election committee operation."
Over the next three months Kalmbach disbursed
$220,000.
Ford Drops Gibson
WASHINGTON - President Ford agreed
yesterday to abandon Andrew E. Gibson as his
choice to be federal energy administrator but
promised to appoint him "to another responsible
position in government" if FBI checks raise no
obstacles.
In a letter to Gibson, who asked that his
appointment be withdrawn because of controbersy
over his $BBO,OOO severance agreement with
Philadelphia Interstate Oil Transport Co., Ford said
he intends to announce a new nominee for the
Federal Energy Administration post "very soon."
In a rather bizarre development, Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said White House staff chief Donald
Rumsfield "has volunteered to take the blame" for
Gibson's selection, even though Nessen contended
Rumsfield knew nothing at the time about Gibson's
10-year agreement with the Philadelphia firm.
Rockefeller Faces Senate Panel
WASHINGTON - With a fresh pledge of support
from President Ford, vice president designate
Nelson A Rockefeller goes before a Senate panel
today to explain his family's role in publication of a
book critical of a campaign opponent.
In opening a nationally broadcast second series
of hearings on the nomination, the Senate Rules
Committee also' plans to ask for a full explanation
from Rockefeller on his nearly $2 million in gifts
and $507,656 in loans to frineds and associates over
the past 17 years.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., chairman of
the committee, has indicated there is no chance the
panel will take a vote on the Rockefeller
nomination before the end of the month.
Palestinian Gets Tight Security
NEW YORK Palestinian guerrilla leader Yasir
Arafat's top lieutenant arrived in New York last
night, preceding his chieftain here amidst the
tightest security net in the city's history.

An American Jewish group already had marked
Arafat for death, and one of its members was
arrested in connection with the threat.
Farouk Al-Kaddumi, second to Arafat in
command of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
arrived at Kennedy airport in early evening.
Meanwhile, Arafat left Cairo in a special plane
during the day, en route to the opening of the
United Nations Palestine debate today.
His travel plans to New York were not disclosed
because of the security precautions. But a State
Department spokesman said there was a possibility
that he might meet with U.S. officials while he is in
the United States.
Sanctions Against Cuba Continue
QUITO, Ecuador Hemispheric foreign
ministers yesterday rejected the lifting of
10-year-old economic and political sanctions against
Cuba.
The United States said no clear evidence exists
that Fidel Castro's regime has stopped exporting
revolution.
The measure failed after five fruitless days of
meetings under auspices of the Organization of
America States.
The foreign ministers came to Quito at the
request of Costa Rica, Colombia and Venezuela,
who declared that Cuba no longer presents the
threat of revolution to the Americas that it did in
1964 when the OAS first invoked the sanctions.
The final vote was 12-3 with six abstentions
two, votes short of the necessary two-thirds 14
votes needed to pass the resolution.
Supporters of an end to the sanctions
immediately issued a declaration saying that the
voting was "an absurd procedure."
Garvey Is National League MVP
NEW YORK Steve Garvey of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, who lived out a boyhood dream to become
a major league star, was named the National
League's Most Valuable Player by the Baseball
Writers Association of America yesterday.
Garvey received 270 points in balloting by a
24-man panel of the BBWAA composed of two
writers from each of the National League's 12 cities.
The writers voted for 10 players with a first-place
vote worth 14 points, second place nine, third place
eight, etc.
Garvey, the Dodgers' first baseman, won by a
comfortable margin over base-stealing king Lou
Brock of the St. Louis Cardinals, who finished
second with 233 points. Mike Marshall, the Dodgers'
relief ace who won the National League Cy Young
award last week, was third with 146 points.
Today's Wieather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with variable
high clouds and patchy night and moming fog.
Little change in temperatures. Highs both days in
the mid 60s to low 70s. North to northeast winds
10 to 20 mph north bay with light variable winds
elsewhere.
Coal Strike Settlement Possible
WASHINGTON The coal industry made a new
contract offer last night which it said could settle
the day-old nationwide coal strike.
A United Mine Workers officer said he was
optimistic a settlement could be reached "very
soon."
The negotiations recessed shortly after midnight
and UMW President Arnold Miller said he had not
had time to study the offer carefully and would
return today.
But Harry Patrick, UMW secretary-treasurer, said
the offer is "pretty good."
At this point I'm very, very optimistic that we
can wrap this thing up very soon," Patrick told
newsmen.
The industry made its proposal near the end of a
12-hour bargaining day on the first day of the
nationwide coal strike which already was producing
layoffs in the railroad and steel industries.
Chief industry negotiator Guy Farmer said the
new offer was not put forth "as a bargaining
gambit" but as a package that could settle this
contract dispute.

Kalmbach could leave the room and regain his
composure.
When the trial resumed, Sirica asked, "Mr.
Kalmbach, is it your testimony that what you
learned from then White House counsel John W.

Dean that all these thousands of dollars were going
to be used for legal attorneys' fees and humanitarian
purposes?"
"Yes, sir," Kalmbach replied.
Kalmbach said that on June 28, 1972, eleven
days after the burglary at Democratic National
Committee headquarters, Dean summoned him to
Washington for "a very important assignment."
Dean and Kalmbach met the next day in a park a
block from the White House and Kalmbach said the
presidential counsel told him, "Herb, so far as these
Watergate defendants, we've got to help these
fellows. It's important we provide them with
attorneys' fees and family support. It's the
humanitarian thing to do."
Dean pledged Kalmbach to absolute secrecy and
was quoted as telling him "this was a CRP Nixon
re-election committee operation."
Over the next three months Kalmbach disbursed
$220,000.
Ford Drops Gibson
WASHINGTON - President Ford agreed
yesterday to abandon Andrew E. Gibson as his
choice to be federal energy administrator but
promised to appoint him "to another responsible
position in government" if FBI checks raise no
obstacles.
In a letter to Gibson, who asked that his
appointment be withdrawn because of controbersy
over his $BBO,OOO severance agreement with
Philadelphia Interstate Oil Transport Co., Ford said
he intends to announce a new nominee for the
Federal Energy Administration post "very soon."
In a rather bizarre development, Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said White House staff chief Donald
Rumsfield "has volunteered to take the blame" for
Gibson's selection, even though Nessen contended
Rumsfield knew nothing at the time about Gibson's
10-year agreement with the Philadelphia firm.
Rockefeller Faces Senate Panel
WASHINGTON - With a fresh pledge of support
from President Ford, vice president designate
Nelson A Rockefeller goes before a Senate panel
today to explain his family's role in publication of a
book critical of a campaign opponent.
In opening a nationally broadcast second series
of hearings on the nomination, the Senate Rules
Committee also' plans to ask for a full explanation
from Rockefeller on his nearly $2 million in gifts
and $507,656 in loans to frineds and associates over
the past 17 years.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., chairman of
the committee, has indicated there is no chance the
panel will take a vote on the Rockefeller
nomination before the end of the month.
Palestinian Gets Tight Security
NEW YORK Palestinian guerrilla leader Yasir
Arafat's top lieutenant arrived in New York last
night, preceding his chieftain here amidst the
tightest security net in the city's history.

An American Jewish group already had marked
Arafat for death, and one of its members was
arrested in connection with the threat.
Farouk Al-Kaddumi, second to Arafat in
command of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
arrived at Kennedy airport in early evening.
Meanwhile, Arafat left Cairo in a special plane
during the day, en route to the opening of the
United Nations Palestine debate today.
His travel plans to New York were not disclosed
because of the security precautions. But a State
Department spokesman said there was a possibility
that he might meet with U.S. officials while he is in
the United States.
Sanctions Against Cuba Continue
QUITO, Ecuador Hemispheric foreign
ministers yesterday rejected the lifting of
10-year-old economic and political sanctions against
Cuba.
The United States said no clear evidence exists
that Fidel Castro's regime has stopped exporting
revolution.
The measure failed after five fruitless days of
meetings under auspices of the Organization of
America States.
The foreign ministers came to Quito at the
request of Costa Rica, Colombia and Venezuela,
who declared that Cuba no longer presents the
threat of revolution to the Americas that it did in
1964 when the OAS first invoked the sanctions.
The final vote was 12-3 with six abstentions
two, votes short of the necessary two-thirds 14
votes needed to pass the resolution.
Supporters of an end to the sanctions
immediately issued a declaration saying that the
voting was "an absurd procedure."
Garvey Is National League MVP
NEW YORK Steve Garvey of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, who lived out a boyhood dream to become
a major league star, was named the National
League's Most Valuable Player by the Baseball
Writers Association of America yesterday.
Garvey received 270 points in balloting by a
24-man panel of the BBWAA composed of two
writers from each of the National League's 12 cities.
The writers voted for 10 players with a first-place
vote worth 14 points, second place nine, third place
eight, etc.
Garvey, the Dodgers' first baseman, won by a
comfortable margin over base-stealing king Lou
Brock of the St. Louis Cardinals, who finished
second with 233 points. Mike Marshall, the Dodgers'
relief ace who won the National League Cy Young
award last week, was third with 146 points.
Today's Wieather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with variable
high clouds and patchy night and moming fog.
Little change in temperatures. Highs both days in
the mid 60s to low 70s. North to northeast winds
10 to 20 mph north bay with light variable winds
elsewhere.
Coal Strike Settlement Possible
WASHINGTON The coal industry made a new
contract offer last night which it said could settle
the day-old nationwide coal strike.
A United Mine Workers officer said he was
optimistic a settlement could be reached "very
soon."
The negotiations recessed shortly after midnight
and UMW President Arnold Miller said he had not
had time to study the offer carefully and would
return today.
But Harry Patrick, UMW secretary-treasurer, said
the offer is "pretty good."
At this point I'm very, very optimistic that we
can wrap this thing up very soon," Patrick told
newsmen.
The industry made its proposal near the end of a
12-hour bargaining day on the first day of the
nationwide coal strike which already was producing
layoffs in the railroad and steel industries.
Chief industry negotiator Guy Farmer said the
new offer was not put forth "as a bargaining
gambit" but as a package that could settle this
contract dispute.
U.N. Vote Expels South Africa
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The U.N. General
Assembly voted last night to exclude South Africa
from further participation in this year's assembly
session.
Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika
this month's president of the assembly, ruled that
South Africa no longer is entitled to its seat.
Then, on a vote demanded by the United States,
assembly members voted 91-22 with 19 abstentions
to uphold his ruling. The Americans protested that
the ruling violated the U.N. Charter.
The Algerian diplomat said he based his ruling on
a Sept. 30 vote denying the South Africa delegation
General Assembly credentials.
But Bouteflike said his ruling would "leave open
the status of South Africa as a member of the
United Nations."
This was because on Oct. 30, the United States,
Britain and France vetoed a move in the Security
Council to expel the South Africans mainly because
of their white minority government's racial policies.
Kalmbach Motives Humanitarian?
WASHINGTON The Watergate trial judge
questioned Herbert W. Kalmbach yesterday about

WASHINGTON - President Ford agreed
yesterday to abandon Andrew E. Gibson as his
choice to be federal energy administrator but
promised to appoint him "to another responsible
position in government" if FBI checks raise no
obstacles.
In a letter to Gibson, who asked that his
appointment be withdrawn because of controbersy
over his $BBO,OOO severance agreement with
Philadelphia Interstate Oil Transport Co., Ford said
he intends to announce a new nominee for the
Federal Energy Administration post "very soon."
In a rather bizarre development, Press Secretary
Ron Nessen said White House staff chief Donald
Rumsfield "has volunteered to take the blame" for
Gibson's selection, even though Nessen contended
Rumsfield knew nothing at the time about Gibson's
10-year agreement with the Philadelphia firm.
Rockefeller Faces Senate Panel
WASHINGTON - With a fresh pledge of support
from President Ford, vice president designate
Nelson A Rockefeller goes before a Senate panel
today to explain his family's role in publication of a
book critical of a campaign opponent.
In opening a nationally broadcast second series
of hearings on the nomination, the Senate Rules
Committee also' plans to ask for a full explanation
from Rockefeller on his nearly $2 million in gifts
and $507,656 in loans to frineds and associates over
the past 17 years.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., chairman of
the committee, has indicated there is no chance the
panel will take a vote on the Rockefeller
nomination before the end of the month.
Palestinian Gets Tight Security
NEW YORK Palestinian guerrilla leader Yasir
Arafat's top lieutenant arrived in New York last
night, preceding his chieftain here amidst the
tightest security net in the city's history.

An American Jewish group already had marked
Arafat for death, and one of its members was
arrested in connection with the threat.
Farouk Al-Kaddumi, second to Arafat in
command of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
arrived at Kennedy airport in early evening.
Meanwhile, Arafat left Cairo in a special plane
during the day, en route to the opening of the
United Nations Palestine debate today.
His travel plans to New York were not disclosed
because of the security precautions. But a State
Department spokesman said there was a possibility
that he might meet with U.S. officials while he is in
the United States.
Sanctions Against Cuba Continue
QUITO, Ecuador Hemispheric foreign
ministers yesterday rejected the lifting of
10-year-old economic and political sanctions against
Cuba.
The United States said no clear evidence exists
that Fidel Castro's regime has stopped exporting
revolution.
The measure failed after five fruitless days of
meetings under auspices of the Organization of
America States.
The foreign ministers came to Quito at the
request of Costa Rica, Colombia and Venezuela,
who declared that Cuba no longer presents the
threat of revolution to the Americas that it did in
1964 when the OAS first invoked the sanctions.
The final vote was 12-3 with six abstentions
two, votes short of the necessary two-thirds 14
votes needed to pass the resolution.
Supporters of an end to the sanctions
immediately issued a declaration saying that the
voting was "an absurd procedure."
Garvey Is National League MVP
NEW YORK Steve Garvey of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, who lived out a boyhood dream to become
a major league star, was named the National
League's Most Valuable Player by the Baseball
Writers Association of America yesterday.
Garvey received 270 points in balloting by a
24-man panel of the BBWAA composed of two
writers from each of the National League's 12 cities.
The writers voted for 10 players with a first-place
vote worth 14 points, second place nine, third place
eight, etc.
Garvey, the Dodgers' first baseman, won by a
comfortable margin over base-stealing king Lou
Brock of the St. Louis Cardinals, who finished
second with 233 points. Mike Marshall, the Dodgers'
relief ace who won the National League Cy Young
award last week, was third with 146 points.
Today's Wieather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with variable
high clouds and patchy night and moming fog.
Little change in temperatures. Highs both days in
the mid 60s to low 70s. North to northeast winds
10 to 20 mph north bay with light variable winds
elsewhere.
Coal Strike Settlement Possible
WASHINGTON The coal industry made a new
contract offer last night which it said could settle
the day-old nationwide coal strike.
A United Mine Workers officer said he was
optimistic a settlement could be reached "very
soon."
The negotiations recessed shortly after midnight
and UMW President Arnold Miller said he had not
had time to study the offer carefully and would
return today.
But Harry Patrick, UMW secretary-treasurer, said
the offer is "pretty good."
At this point I'm very, very optimistic that we
can wrap this thing up very soon," Patrick told
newsmen.
The industry made its proposal near the end of a
12-hour bargaining day on the first day of the
nationwide coal strike which already was producing
layoffs in the railroad and steel industries.
Chief industry negotiator Guy Farmer said the
new offer was not put forth "as a bargaining
gambit" but as a package that could settle this
contract dispute.
U.N. Vote Expels South Africa
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The U.N. General
Assembly voted last night to exclude South Africa
from further participation in this year's assembly
session.
Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika
this month's president of the assembly, ruled that
South Africa no longer is entitled to its seat.
Then, on a vote demanded by the United States,
assembly members voted 91-22 with 19 abstentions
to uphold his ruling. The Americans protested that
the ruling violated the U.N. Charter.
The Algerian diplomat said he based his ruling on
a Sept. 30 vote denying the South Africa delegation
General Assembly credentials.
But Bouteflike said his ruling would "leave open
the status of South Africa as a member of the
United Nations."
This was because on Oct. 30, the United States,
Britain and France vetoed a move in the Security
Council to expel the South Africans mainly because
of their white minority government's racial policies.
Kalmbach Motives Humanitarian?
WASHINGTON The Watergate trial judge
questioned Herbert W. Kalmbach yesterday about
how he could have believed that the thousands of
dollars he passed on to the Watergate break-in
defendants was solely for humanitarian purposes
and not hush money.
Hours earlier in his testimony about the money,
Kalmbach broke down in tears, and U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica called a brief recess so
Kalmbach could leave the room and regain his
composure.
When the trial resumed, Sirica asked, "Mr.
Kalmbach, is it your testimony that what you
learned from then White House counsel John W.

Dean that all these thousands of dollars were going
to be used for legal attorneys' fees and humanitarian
purposes?"
"Yes, sir," Kalmbach replied.
Kalmbach said that on June 28, 1972, eleven
days after the burglary at Democratic National
Committee headquarters, Dean summoned him to
Washington for "a very important assignment."
Dean and Kalmbach met the next day in a park a
block from the White House and Kalmbach said the
presidential counsel told him, "Herb, so far as these
Watergate defendants, we've got to help these
fellows. It's important we provide them with
attorneys' fees and family support. It's the
humanitarian thing to do."
Dean pledged Kalmbach to absolute secrecy and
was quoted as telling him "this was a CRP Nixon
re-election committee operation."
Over the next three months Kalmbach disbursed
$220,000.
