# Student Competition High For Notetaker Positions

### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Applying to be a notetaker for the
ASSU Lecture Notes Service is
somewhat like applying to law school.
The competition is tough.
Service Director Vic Petroff said 67
students have applied and only 14
positions are available. Roughly
one-third of the applicants are
graduate students, he added.
"Some are even TAs [teaching
assistants] who got A's in the class
before," he said. "I've just had to
throw out all the people who wrote
bad applications."
The service, which plans to begin
operations winter quarter, is designed
to provide low-cost lecture notes to
students, giving them an increased
opportunity to listen to lectures and
grasp the main points, said Petroff, a
sophomore majoring in history.
Next Week
Petroff, who has chosen six
notetakers already, said he plans to
choose the rest by the end of next
week.
"Some profs want a say in who
takes notes in their classes," he said,
adding that he sent them a list of
acceptable applicants. "I'm going to be
pushing for their reply this week."

After notetakers are chosen, Petroff
said he will choose the rest of his staff,
including people to handle advertising,

distribution and copy machines.
Only Biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy has not approved the lecture
notes service for his classes.
Decision Soon
Petroff said Kennedy, who will
teach Biology 3A and 3B next quarter,
will tell him of his decision some time
today.
A mimeograph machine and an
electronic stencilmaker represent the
major costs for the service, about
$2BOO according to Petroff.
"We start out that much in the
hole," he said. "We have three years to
make it up. I don't have to worry
about that though. My job is just to
make the business operation
profitable. If it doesn't make money
this year, then I haven't done my job."
Petroff expressed confidence the
service will make money, saying, "I
think people are kind of getting ready
for it."
However, later he admitted, "It's all
great in theory, but I don't know
what's going to happen."
The average number of students in
the 16 classes to be covered by the
service must, be at least 57 for tbe
program to make money, Petroff said
earlier.
Most of the classes chosen for the
pilot program had an enrollment of
more than 200 last spring, and most
are in the natural sciences.
