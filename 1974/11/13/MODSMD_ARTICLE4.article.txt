# Local Gas Dealers Posting Prices Sell Cheaper, PIRG Study Says
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
Stanford's equivalent to Ralph
Nader's Raiders has produced its first
tangible results a consumer's guide
to local gasoline prices.

The guide, prepared by the
Stanford chapter of the Northern
California Public Interest Research
Group (NorCal PIRG), lists prices of
gas sold at various locations in the Palo
Alto-Menlo Park area.

The survey showed that prices vary
widely among stations, and that prices
tended to be lower at dealers who

posted their prices on the street.
The survey covered 56 service
stations in Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Survey coordinator Nancy Pfund and
three other PIRG staff members
checked prices at each station, and
then categorized the stations by brand,
location and whether they posted their
prices.
Lowest
The lowest price for regular was
found at the Apollo station in Palo
Alto. Gas there sold for 48.9 cents a
gallon. Many stations were selling
regular for as much as 59.9 cents a
gallon. The average price was 54.1
cents.
The 10 lowest-priced gasolines were
sold at stations where prices were
posted.
Pfund said advertising prices openly
and conspicuously creates a greater
atmosphere of competition between
dealers, especially along streets where
several stations are clustered together.
This spirit of competition, said Pfund,
encourages the lower prices.
Required Posting
The Palo Alto City Council recently
passed an ordinance requiring the
posting of gas prices. The survey
indicated that stations in Palo Alto are
complying fully with the ordinance.
But 62 percent of the stations in
Menlo Park, which has no such

ordinance, had posted their prices as
well.
The average price for regular at
stations which posted prices was 53.7
cents. Prices at stations which did not
averaged 55.7 cents. Other NorCal
PIRG studies in Santa Clara and
Stockton have shown that posted
prices are lower in those cities as well,
Pfund said.
This study was one of several
projects that the Stanford chapter of
NorCal PIRG has been working on in
recent weeks. At present it is
investigating whether automobile
dealers give customers straight answers
about the cars they sell.
PIRG is also studying truth in
lending at several banks in the Palo
Alto area. One study in the works will
try to find out if local discount stores
really offer lower prices for drugs.

The average price for regular at
stations which posted prices was 53.7
cents. Prices at stations which did not
averaged 55.7 cents. Other NorCal
PIRG studies in Santa Clara and
Stockton have shown that posted
prices are lower in those cities as well,
Pfund said.
This study was one of several
projects that the Stanford chapter of
NorCal PIRG has been working on in
recent weeks. At present it is
investigating whether automobile
dealers give customers straight answers
about the cars they sell.
PIRG is also studying truth in
lending at several banks in the Palo
Alto area. One study in the works will
try to find out if local discount stores
really offer lower prices for drugs.
Stanford's equivalent to Ralph
Nader's Raiders has produced its first
tangible results a consumer's guide
to local gasoline prices.

The guide, prepared by the
Stanford chapter of the Northern
California Public Interest Research
Group (NorCal PIRG), lists prices of
gas sold at various locations in the Palo
Alto-Menlo Park area.

The survey showed that prices vary
widely among stations, and that prices
tended to be lower at dealers who

posted their prices on the street.
The survey covered 56 service
stations in Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Survey coordinator Nancy Pfund and
three other PIRG staff members
checked prices at each station, and
then categorized the stations by brand,
location and whether they posted their
prices.
Lowest
The lowest price for regular was
found at the Apollo station in Palo
Alto. Gas there sold for 48.9 cents a
gallon. Many stations were selling
regular for as much as 59.9 cents a
gallon. The average price was 54.1
cents.
The 10 lowest-priced gasolines were
sold at stations where prices were
posted.
Pfund said advertising prices openly
and conspicuously creates a greater
atmosphere of competition between
dealers, especially along streets where
several stations are clustered together.
This spirit of competition, said Pfund,
encourages the lower prices.
Required Posting
The Palo Alto City Council recently
passed an ordinance requiring the
posting of gas prices. The survey
indicated that stations in Palo Alto are
complying fully with the ordinance.
But 62 percent of the stations in
Menlo Park, which has no such

ordinance, had posted their prices as
well.
The average price for regular at
stations which posted prices was 53.7
cents. Prices at stations which did not
averaged 55.7 cents. Other NorCal
PIRG studies in Santa Clara and
Stockton have shown that posted
prices are lower in those cities as well,
Pfund said.
