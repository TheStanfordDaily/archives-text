# IFC Says Bonfire Supplies Uncertain
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
Although it is still uncertain how much
wood and fuel will be available for the Big
Game Bonfire, the Inter-Fraternity Council has
forged ahead with its plans for the pre-game
blaze.
"We need wood, we need oil and we need
money," Bonfire Committee chairman Tom
Pedreira told over 40 dorm representatives at a
meeting last night.
Total costs for the Bonfire will run between
$6OO and $750. The IFC will underwrite any
debts incurred which are not covered by
donations, IFC President Mike Nilsson said.
Donations of $2OO each have come from
University Relations and the Athletic
Department. Pedreira is asking a $lO donation
from each residence to further help defray
costs.
Donations.
Alumni, the assistant dean of students, the
senior class and the ASSU Council of Presidents
have also been approached for donations,
committee member Tim Conway added.
Seven telephone poles rather than 12, as
previously reported, have been donated to the
Bonfire by Plant Services, Pedreira said, with
more possibly coming from Pacific Telephone.
Some wood has been donated, but Pedreira said
he didn't know how much.
He added that between 100 and 200 gallons
of fuel oil will be needed to ignite the Bonfire.
Telephone poles will form the basic
structure of the Bonfire. Next Tuesday, Plant
Services will insert the poles into the dry
lakebed of Lake Lagunita in the shape of a "C".

A trench will be dug under the poles to allow
for air to circulate up through the fire.
A fence of wooden crate pallettes will be
placed around the poles on Thursday. A
24-hour guard will be started at that time
through Friday evening to prevent any Cal
pranksters from sabotaging the event.
Trouble
Committee member Pat Walcyk warned that
since three Stanford Theta Delts had stolen the
Axe from Cal last year, before Stanford won it
honestly in the game, Cal students might want
to try something this year.
Traditionally, freshmen have been assigned
the duty of guarding the Bonfire site. However,
since juniors and sophomores have never had
the pleasure, they too will be given guard duty,
Conway said. He added that free beer will be
provided by the fraternities to all the guards.
Once opposed by various ecology groups,
this year the county fire marshall has approved
the Bonfire. The Bay Area Air Pollution
Control District voiced no objections either,
but asked that dry wood by used to prevent
excess smoke. Terra House, the ecology
theme-house, has also given the event its
approval.
"Actually, the Bonfire is not that much of a
pollutor," committee member Jim Dewell
noted.
Citing a 1971 report from Metcalf and Eddy,
a Palo Alto engineering firm, he said San
Francisco International Airport emits 49.7 tons
of pollutants into the air each day. The 1971
Bonfire was estimated to give off only 4.37
tons.

debts incurred which are not covered by
donations, IFC President Mike Nilsson said.
Donations of $2OO each have come from
University Relations and the Athletic
Department. Pedreira is asking a $lO donation
from each residence to further help defray
costs.
Donations.
Alumni, the assistant dean of students, the
senior class and the ASSU Council of Presidents
have also been approached for donations,
committee member Tim Conway added.
Seven telephone poles rather than 12, as
previously reported, have been donated to the
Bonfire by Plant Services, Pedreira said, with
more possibly coming from Pacific Telephone.
Some wood has been donated, but Pedreira said
he didn't know how much.
He added that between 100 and 200 gallons
of fuel oil will be needed to ignite the Bonfire.
Telephone poles will form the basic
structure of the Bonfire. Next Tuesday, Plant
Services will insert the poles into the dry
lakebed of Lake Lagunita in the shape of a "C".

A trench will be dug under the poles to allow
for air to circulate up through the fire.
A fence of wooden crate pallettes will be
placed around the poles on Thursday. A
24-hour guard will be started at that time
through Friday evening to prevent any Cal
pranksters from sabotaging the event.
Trouble
Committee member Pat Walcyk warned that
since three Stanford Theta Delts had stolen the
Axe from Cal last year, before Stanford won it
honestly in the game, Cal students might want
to try something this year.
Traditionally, freshmen have been assigned
the duty of guarding the Bonfire site. However,
since juniors and sophomores have never had
the pleasure, they too will be given guard duty,
Conway said. He added that free beer will be
provided by the fraternities to all the guards.
Once opposed by various ecology groups,
this year the county fire marshall has approved
the Bonfire. The Bay Area Air Pollution
Control District voiced no objections either,
but asked that dry wood by used to prevent
excess smoke. Terra House, the ecology
theme-house, has also given the event its
approval.
"Actually, the Bonfire is not that much of a
pollutor," committee member Jim Dewell
noted.
Citing a 1971 report from Metcalf and Eddy,
a Palo Alto engineering firm, he said San
Francisco International Airport emits 49.7 tons
of pollutants into the air each day. The 1971
Bonfire was estimated to give off only 4.37
tons.

THE GAME PLAN—Bonfire Committee chairman Tom Pedreira (left) and committee member
Jim Dewell (right) revealed plans last night for the traditional Big Game Bonfire. However,
supplies for the big blaze are still uncertain.
Although it is still uncertain how much
wood and fuel will be available for the Big
Game Bonfire, the Inter-Fraternity Council has
forged ahead with its plans for the pre-game
blaze.
"We need wood, we need oil and we need
money," Bonfire Committee chairman Tom
Pedreira told over 40 dorm representatives at a
meeting last night.
Total costs for the Bonfire will run between
$6OO and $750. The IFC will underwrite any
debts incurred which are not covered by
