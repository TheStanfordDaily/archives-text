### SHERI BEBB 
Stanford Public Safety Officers
have issued 25 bicycle tickets in the
past week, mainly for stop sign and
equipment violations.
Capt. William Wullschleger of the
department of public safety said that
warnings would continue for some
violators. "We did a lot
more .. . warning on minor
violations," in addition to the
ticketing, he stated.
Wullschleger feels the campaign to
inform students of bicycle regulations
has been successful.
"The bicyclists are aware of what
the problems are," said Wullschleger.
"I think we've had a good campaign
warning the bicyclists of the dangers."
Officers warned cyclists of
violations from Oct. 23 to Nov. 4,
after which they began issuing
citations.
Bicyclists seem to feel that cruising
through a stop sign doesn't merit the
$2O fine that may accompany it.
Wullschleger says they are taking the
warnings seriously. Even "the sight of
the patrol car is making people obey
stop signs," he noted.
Other violations, such as failing to
yield right-of-way to approaching
traffic when entering a roadway from
an alley or path, or riding on the
wrong side of the street, will cost the
cited bicyclist $2O and $lO
respectively, according to Phyllis
Anderson, traffic supervisor for the
Palo Alto-Mountain View Municipal
Court.
No special cars or patrol routes
have been employed to enforce bicycle
regulations. "Cars are out there on
normal patrol and they're supposed to
write them as they see them,"
explained Wullschleger.
Riding in a patrol car doesn't
prevent officers from issuing tickets to
cyclists. Officers in patrol cars
"actually stop" bicyclists who violate
vehicle code regulations, Wullschleger
said.
Violators have 11 days to clear
their tickets, either by paying the fine
or by coming into the court office and
signing up for a court appearance,
according to Mary Montoya, senior
deputy clerk at the Palo
Alto-Mountain View Municipal Court.
