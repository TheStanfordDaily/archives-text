## The 						Bonfire 
### 
It's been a bad week. People starved. Autos collided.
Politicians plotted, jack Benny got older.
In the midst of this parade of gloom, one bright spot
shined through; one clear note of happiness bounced
through all the discord and chaos. The Bonfire came back.
Most of us assumed the Bonfire had been laid to rest with
most other venerable Stanford traditions last year, when
rainy weather and Thanksgiving laziness did it in for the
second time in a row. After all, this year's senior class is the
last one that remembers the Bonfire. It seemed doubtful it
would ever be resurrected, and when football fortunes began
withering with the autumn leaves it seemed impossible.
But the Bonfire is back. And we're glad. In a world
plagued by so many torturously complex questions of
cosmic good and evil, the Bonfire is a pleasantly simple
affair, a throwback to days when things didn't seem so
pressing.
Some disagree, of course. Some think the Bonfire is a
needless extravagance, a waste of fuel, a contributor to
already shameful air pollution.
That, we submit, is a rather severe way of looking at
things. The Bonfire is a luxury, of course, and it is a polluter
of sorts. But it's also a small luxury, and one that anyone
can enjoy. It doesn't cost anything to go to the Bonfire, and
it doesn't take an elaborate knowledge of the theory of art
to understand it.
The Bonfire is one of those precious few events that can
and does bring the entire Stanford community together
for a few moments, however brief. It is a beautiful and
awe-inspiring sight, one that captivated audiences of even
the most militant radicals and acerbic conservatives during
the violent contortions of the late 60s and early 70s.
Surely we can tolerate the tiny pollution the Bonfird
creates, particularly when it eases life's burdens a bit for so
many people. Fighting pollution does not demand cutting
our marginal frills like the Bonfire; those who worry about
such things should consider how much it would help to cut
their driving by 10 percent or so a much more
fundamental and valuable approach to preserving the
environment.
The Bonfire, though well, it's like nickle candy or
teddy bears. No one can argue that life will end without it
but surely the world is a little bit nicer when it's around.

It's been a bad week. People starved. Autos collided.
Politicians plotted, jack Benny got older.
In the midst of this parade of gloom, one bright spot
shined through; one clear note of happiness bounced
through all the discord and chaos. The Bonfire came back.
Most of us assumed the Bonfire had been laid to rest with
most other venerable Stanford traditions last year, when
rainy weather and Thanksgiving laziness did it in for the
second time in a row. After all, this year's senior class is the
last one that remembers the Bonfire. It seemed doubtful it
would ever be resurrected, and when football fortunes began
withering with the autumn leaves it seemed impossible.
But the Bonfire is back. And we're glad. In a world
plagued by so many torturously complex questions of
cosmic good and evil, the Bonfire is a pleasantly simple
affair, a throwback to days when things didn't seem so
pressing.
Some disagree, of course. Some think the Bonfire is a
needless extravagance, a waste of fuel, a contributor to
already shameful air pollution.
That, we submit, is a rather severe way of looking at
things. The Bonfire is a luxury, of course, and it is a polluter
of sorts. But it's also a small luxury, and one that anyone
can enjoy. It doesn't cost anything to go to the Bonfire, and
it doesn't take an elaborate knowledge of the theory of art
to understand it.
The Bonfire is one of those precious few events that can
and does bring the entire Stanford community together
for a few moments, however brief. It is a beautiful and
awe-inspiring sight, one that captivated audiences of even
the most militant radicals and acerbic conservatives during
the violent contortions of the late 60s and early 70s.
Surely we can tolerate the tiny pollution the Bonfird
creates, particularly when it eases life's burdens a bit for so
many people. Fighting pollution does not demand cutting
our marginal frills like the Bonfire; those who worry about
such things should consider how much it would help to cut
their driving by 10 percent or so a much more
fundamental and valuable approach to preserving the
environment.
The Bonfire, though well, it's like nickle candy or
teddy bears. No one can argue that life will end without it
but surely the world is a little bit nicer when it's around.
