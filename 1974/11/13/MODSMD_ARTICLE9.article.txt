# 'Live Oak' Fee
## 
### Tim Ferguson 
Unlike many of my colleagues
at the Daily, I sincerely welcomed
the arrival of Live Oak this fall. I
rarely agree with the Daily's
editorial positions, and thought
healthy a challenge to its
monopoly of student journalism
on campus.
The first Live Oak issues
weren't much some tacky
criticisms of the Daily, some
rather inaccurate "investigative"
stories, some warmed-over sports
copy, some propagandistic news
stories written by those involved
with the topic and some
restaurant reviews suspicously
paralleling ads from the same
establishments.
But the quality improved. Live
Oak's features on campus fear
following the Memorial Church
murder and on the troubles of
transfer students were better than
anything the Daily has done on
the topics.
Lucia Shultz's movie column
and the Kaleidoscope consistently
top comparable items in the
Daily.
I was growing more impressed
with Live Oak's fight for survival
against opposition from those in
the ASSU office. Initiative and
determination might just triumph,
I thought.
Then, disillusionment. Live
Oak petitioned (successfully) for a
referendum on a fee assessment.
This is the ultimate admission
of inability to stand on one's own:
a resort to the parasitic means of
mandatory (though refundable)

assessments from many who want
no part of Live Oak, just as they
wanted no part of many of the
seven assessments which were
rammed through for this quarter.
And, let us remember what
campus entity is not a part of this
quarterly bilking. It is that bastion
of coercive, collectivist thought,
the Stanford Daily.
In the last year no non-readers
have been stuck with a bill for the
Daily. If the strength of principle
of those who won independence
for the Daily is maintained, none
shall be in the future.
Principle is painful at salary
time, but the fruits of voluntary,
contractual payments spend a lot
easier for me. The termination of
the Daily's fee assessment was a
decision with which I firmly
agree, and which I will fight to
uphold as long as I remain with
the Daily.
I must extend these same
convictions toward Live Oak, and
I am rather sickened. If editor Bill
Weinstein has a product which
cannot subsist on advertising
alone, let him sell it (I'll buy it)
don't force me to go out of my
way to avoid paying for it. Mason
Blacher brought the Quad back a
year ago without an assessment; it
can be done.
For this reason, and not
because of a dislike for Live Oak
or a desire to see it die, I must
condemn the paper's attempted
assessment and urge its defeat.

time, but the fruits of voluntary,
contractual payments spend a lot
easier for me. The termination of
the Daily's fee assessment was a
decision with which I firmly
agree, and which I will fight to
uphold as long as I remain with
the Daily.
I must extend these same
convictions toward Live Oak, and
I am rather sickened. If editor Bill
Weinstein has a product which
cannot subsist on advertising
alone, let him sell it (I'll buy it)
don't force me to go out of my
way to avoid paying for it. Mason
Blacher brought the Quad back a
year ago without an assessment; it
can be done.
For this reason, and not
because of a dislike for Live Oak
or a desire to see it die, I must
condemn the paper's attempted
assessment and urge its defeat.
(Tim Ferguson is a member of the
Daily editorial board.)
Unlike many of my colleagues
at the Daily, I sincerely welcomed
the arrival of Live Oak this fall. I
rarely agree with the Daily's
editorial positions, and thought
healthy a challenge to its
monopoly of student journalism
on campus.
The first Live Oak issues
weren't much some tacky
criticisms of the Daily, some
rather inaccurate "investigative"
stories, some warmed-over sports
copy, some propagandistic news
stories written by those involved
with the topic and some
restaurant reviews suspicously
paralleling ads from the same
establishments.
But the quality improved. Live
Oak's features on campus fear
following the Memorial Church
murder and on the troubles of
transfer students were better than
anything the Daily has done on
the topics.
Lucia Shultz's movie column
and the Kaleidoscope consistently
top comparable items in the
Daily.
I was growing more impressed
with Live Oak's fight for survival
against opposition from those in
the ASSU office. Initiative and
determination might just triumph,
I thought.
Then, disillusionment. Live
Oak petitioned (successfully) for a
referendum on a fee assessment.
This is the ultimate admission
of inability to stand on one's own:
a resort to the parasitic means of
mandatory (though refundable)

assessments from many who want
no part of Live Oak, just as they
wanted no part of many of the
seven assessments which were
rammed through for this quarter.
And, let us remember what
campus entity is not a part of this
quarterly bilking. It is that bastion
of coercive, collectivist thought,
the Stanford Daily.
In the last year no non-readers
have been stuck with a bill for the
Daily. If the strength of principle
of those who won independence
for the Daily is maintained, none
shall be in the future.
Principle is painful at salary
time, but the fruits of voluntary,
contractual payments spend a lot
easier for me. The termination of
the Daily's fee assessment was a
decision with which I firmly
agree, and which I will fight to
uphold as long as I remain with
