and can save you a bundle.
it's all FOR YOU.
In about one hour, you will have taken a
thorough film tour of the JBL factory. Seen
what makes JBL the overwhelming choice of
performers and professional musicians. You'll
see how ofherwell-known speakers are made,
too. We'll pass around actual woofers and
tweeters and such, that have been cut away to
show the insides. You'll have ample time for
your questions. A look at some exciting new
models. And free refreshments. In all, an

Those superb, expensive speakers have

3-way kin to the fabulous L-100, called

if you've been saving up for JBL, stop.
Those superb, expensive speakers have
been joined by three new, superb, and
not-so-expensive JBL's. The Decades,
above. Two 2-ways: The compact L-16
for $135. The run-away popular L-26
for $156. And, believe it or not, a genuine
3-way kin to the fabulous L-100, called
the L-36, for just $l9B. One day you'll
