The M.W. Kellogg Company.
The M.W. Kellogg Company is looking for out-of-the-ordinary
engineers who can assume positions of responsibility fast. Kellogg is
working around the clock on major energy conversion projects that are
designed to head off growing shortages of fertilizer and fuel around
the world. We're continuing to broaden our worldwide services to the
petroleum and petrochemical industries, and this growth has created
some exciting opportunities for engineers.
As one of the world's leading engineering and construction
companies, Kellogg provides fully integrated design, engineering,
procurement, construction and support services to bur clients throughout
the world. This work is complex and demanding and requires people
who can apply new ideas to existing technology in the areas of petroleum
refining, ammonia and fertilizer processing, petrochemical
manufacturing, LNG facilities and pollution control and abatement.
The people we are seeking are definitely above average. So the
people we select can expect to receive above average compensation, in
terms of salary and benefits as well as the personal reward that comes
from being a leader in one's chosen profession.
If this sounds like the kind of company and career you're looking
for, make an appointment to talk to us on campus.
