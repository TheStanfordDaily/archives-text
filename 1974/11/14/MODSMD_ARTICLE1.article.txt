# Comedian Gregory's Humor Bites America Back
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
Dick Gregory, the celebrated comedian, has
become Dick Gregory, the social crusader, who had
dedicated his life to fighting what he calls the
"bunch of sick, old, degenerage, freaky men" who
control America's political system.
"People ask me, 'How come you don't say
something nice about America,' " he says. "The
answer is, because I've got too much sense."
For Gregory, sense means flying to Rome to
protest the Federal government's stand at the World
Food Conference, as he did this weekend; running
for office against Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and
former President Richard Nixon; and spreading his
brand of political black humor, as he did in a
Memorial Church address last night.
"The money for everything I do comes right out
of my own pocket, but that's cool," Gregory says.
"That way I don't have to go through no changes;
no government or foundation's gonna tell me what
to say."
Outspoken Comments
In fact, almost every controversial social issue has
elicited Gregory's outspoken comments, and he has
a knack for getting his opinions publicized. His
recent two-and-a-half year fast protesting U.S.
policies in Vietnam earned him national attention,
and now Gregory has begun to fast again this
time, perhaps for good.
"I will never take another bite of solid food until
the superpowers can guarantee that no one on earth
will starve to death when there is enough food and
enough idle land to provide for everyone," he states.
"This world conference on food that's going on
right now is probably the most important
conference in the world in all history," he adds.
"But the powerful countries are trying to stack the
deck against the hungry folks.
"While the governments of the big powers are

filling your head with all this stuff about the
population explosion, half the arable land in the
world is not cultivated, and we use enough fertilizer
on our lawns and cemeteries to feed India for 10
years."
Unrepresentative
Gregory says he went to the Rome conference
because "most of them freaks the government sent
don't represent the mass of the American people.
Most of us are concerned about hunger, and we
want to see the government do something about it."
The comedian-activist says he will advocate that
every American forgo eating meat for a week and
donate the money they would have spent to the
world food bank.
Is there much hope that the Federal government
will take strong steps to ease hunger? "No way,"
says Gregory. "But if the communists said they
would stake their honor on solving the food crisis in
a month, the United States would solve it in two
days."
Gregory's anger is not confined to the world
food issue, however. He sees hard times ahead for
the American people. "You know things are really
getting bad when the old folks stop lying," he said.
"No one's talking about the good old days, 'cause it
looks like they're coming back.
"People ask me how we feel about a depression
coming up, but you know we never came out of the
last one. When people tell me the prime rate's up to
12 percent, I wonder how it got so low. I paid 75
percent interest back in 1959 for a Motorola TV
with the knobs busted."
One-Liners
Using a furious progression of one liners like, "If
the price of onions keeps going up, it's going to be a
status symbol just to have them on your breath," he
backs up his assertion that Americans are getting

cheated by the major food distributors.
Gregory's version of America's 1976 bicentennial
is a grim one. "If most of you knew what is going
on behind the scenes in the government, you'd
know how bad it's going to be," he says.
He blames many of the country's problems on
the interference of the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA), which he calls "the weirdest, most vicious,
most inhumane group ever unleashed on the world."
"Watergate itself just keeps pushing down to the
CIA," says Gregory. "What makes those buggers
ex-CIA agents, the fact that they got caught? In fact
one £ay you'll find this CIA thing goes right down
to Dallas the day President Kennedy was shot.
"As for people who are surprised that the CIA
went in and did those terrible things to Chile, that's
about as sensible as someone being surprised when
Frankenstein goes out and chokes somebody."
'Morally Bankrupt'
Gregory sees himself in a country that is
"morally bankrupt on one side and nature's closing
in on the other," where "the President's supposed
to be the moral leader, but that's a real joke.
"If you don't think the country's in bad shape,
just look at what would happen to Christ if he were
around right now. He'd be at the Hilton Inn in New
York City, and there's no way he'd get a room with
no credit card or traveler's checks.
"He wouldn't have much luck sleeping in Central
Park, either, 'cause if the muggers didn't kill him the
police would bust him on a vagrancy charge. You
can imagine the scene when some mean desk
sargeant asks him his mother's name.
"In the end, they'd probably give him the
electric chair, and then where would we be? We'd all
be wearing electric chairs around our necks."
For Dick Gregory, the vision is real enough to be
frightening.
