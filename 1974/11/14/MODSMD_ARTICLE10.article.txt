# Same Old Story--Man's Inhumanity
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
Newspaper columnists, at one time or
another, have probably spoken out in behalf
of every oppressed group in our society.
Whether of a racial minority, religious sect or
other so-called deviant group which has
become the victim of prejudice, journalists
have been notorious for defending rights.
And many newspapers not only support
these groups, but also cover their noteworthy
events. This is all well and good, but there is
one group that has been almost totally
ignored.
I am speaking about animals.
This is not going to be an "animals
liberation" article, which lambasts all
pet-owners and carnivores. I eat and enjoy
meat, fish and poultry and see
nothing wrong with having a pet.
But there have been a few recent atrocities
that almost anyone would find barbaric. And
since the animals can't speak or write for
themselves (though the Daily has at times
received letters to the Editor signed by"A
Dog"), I decided it was about time someone
went to bat for them.
Slaughter 'Alarming'
The most alarming act was the recent
slaughter of cattle by ranchers and dairymen
to protest inflationary costs of feed grain and
other overhead which, the farmers claimed,
pushed their costs above the market value.
About 650 cattle wefe slaughtered in
Wisconsin last month. Their bodies were then
shoved into freshly dug pits. Out of sight, out

of mind, the farmers probably figured.
Other farmers, in Texas and Kentucky,
also threatened to kill their calves, but both
groups changed their mind, at least
temporarily.
There is no defensible argument that
supports the acts of the members of the
National Farmers Organization (NFO) who
performed the Wisconsin slaughter by
shooting the animals in the head or slitting
their throats.
No One Likes It
"None of us like it," one farmer said.
"But if they don't change soon they might as
well shoot the American farmer and throw
him in the pit," he continued. His suggestion
seems more humane, because at least the
farmers would have a chance to protest.
It must be admitted that the NFO has a
legitimate gripe. It costs a farmer about 70
cents a pound to raise veal calves and they
get only 17 cents a pound for them, a
representative of NFO noted. While those
figures may exaggerate the situation, they
probably aren't too far off.
This situation came at a very noteworthy
time: right before the current World Food
Conference at Rome, where numerous
persons are predicting future mass starvation
if measures are not taken to redistribute food
and curb population growth.
The Wisconsin farmers said they offered
to turn the calves over to slaughterhouses if
the packers would agree to distribute the

meat to needy families, an offer which was
turned down. The farmers could and should
have tried harder to avoid a massive killing of
the one-week old calves.
Recent Army Act
A recent act involving the Army falls into
this same category. At two bases, in
Kentucky and Tennessee, the Army has
planned to kill 14 million birds this winter by
spraying them with a chemical that will cause
them to freeze to death.
Only a group of environmentalists
threatening to take the Army to court has
stopped the massacre so far.
Not only is any such mass killing of birds
intolerable, but the particular method is
worth noting because of its extreme
inhumanity. The Army plans to drop a
detergent-like chemical mixed with water on
the roosting areas. The chemical the
protective oil away from the birds' feathers
so that when the temperature drops below 45
degrees, they chill and eventually freeze to
death.
If these are the types of methods that are
currently used to get rid of unwanted
wildlife, it is probably only a matter of time
before they are used to get rid of unwanted
people.
