# Kent State--Another Chapter Closed
## 
### Robert Bacon 
Another chapter in the Kent
State story is closed. But the
survivors of the tragedy continue
to seek posthumous justice for the
four slain students.
Four and a half years after
Ohio National Guard gunfire
killed the four and wounded nine
others, a judge Friday acquitted
eight former Guardsmen of
federal criminal charges in the
incident.
But many questions remain,
some of them underscored by the
judge himself.
When a federal grand jury
indicted the eight enlisted men,
but no officers, last March, many
people wondered if it might be
too little, too late. They were
apparently right.
Federal Judge Frank J. Battisti
in Cleveland directed the acquittal
after the prosecution had finished
presenting its evidence to the jury.
He ruled the government had
failed to prove that the
Guardsmen specifically intended
to deprive students of their civil
rights.
Different Outcome
But he said the outcome might
have been different had the State
of Ohio prosecuted the
Guardsmen for assault or murder.
Battisti stressed that he did not
condone the Guard's conduct. He
said they used excessive force on
May 4, 1970, and that some of
them may well have acted with
gross negligence, recklessness or
intent to injure, sufficient to
establish a state crime.
The off-again, on-again federal
investigation f produced last
March's indictments under an
1866 law forbidding "willful
deprivation of rights under color
of law."
This law, enacted to protect
the newly freed blacks in the
South, has had limited usefulness.
It is a companion to the civil
rights conspiracy law under which

John Ehrlichman and others were
convicted for their part in the
Ellsberg psychiatrist burglary.
Hard To Prove
In Ehrlichman's case, the
necessary intent was proven by
White House memos. In most
other cases, including the Kent
case, it has been quite difficult for
the government to establish.
With all chance for criminal
convictions apparently gone, the
only hope for posthumous
vindication of the four dead
students lies in multimillion-dollar
civil damage suits brought by their
parents against state officials and
guardsmen.
Even here, justice has been
maddeningly slow. Four lower
courts ruled that the state's
immunity from damage suits
prevented the parents from having
their day in court. Last spring the
United States Supreme Court held
otherwise, saying that if the

parents could prove their
allegations of misconduct, the
officials would not be shielded by
the immunity doctrine.
Merits Not Decided
The Supreme Court stressed
that it was not deciding the merits
of the claims, and sent the case
back to the federal district court
for trial, now set to begin next
spring.
The parents seek to prove that
state and Guard officials, from
Gov. Rhodes down, grossly
overreacted to demonstrations on
the Kent State campus. Whether
they will prevail is questionable.
On the one hand, courts are
typically reluctant to second-guess
the judgment of high government
officials, especially in crisis
situations. A lower court, refusing
to give the parents a chance to be
heard, took note of what it called
"mob rule" at Kent before the

Guardsmen arrived.
But on the other side are the
findings of the 1970 Scranton
Commission, which sharply
criticized the Guard for opening
fire on unarmed students. The
Commission concluded that while
many of the demonstrators had
committed "plainly intolerable"
acts, the Guard's gunfire was
"unnecessary, unwarranted, and
inexcusable."
It seems quite likely that many
of the demonstrators let their zeal
overcome their judgment,
although it is clear that this was
not true of some of the dead and
injured.
Nevertheless, the fact remains
that it was the authorities, whose
duty in such situations is to
restore order, who turned just
another ugly incident into a
national tragedy.
