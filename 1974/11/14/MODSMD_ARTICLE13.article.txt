# Doctors Socially Aware?
## 
### H.R. Nickerson 
Last Halloween eve, a sacred
cow visited Cubberley
Auditorium. Although many
people were there, few noticed it,
because it was very cleverly
disguised as Dr. Michael Deßakey.
Deßakey, appearing as a guest
of the ASSU Speaker's Bureau,
was billed to speak on "Social
Responsibility in Medical
Research." This seemed a relevant
topic considering the current
popularity of medical studies and
Deßakey's eminent position in the
profession.
It soon became evident,
however, that Deßakey did not
wish to discuss social issues. Aside
from a few opening and closing
remarks, Deßakey spent his time
discussing the accomplishments of
open-heart surgery. Perhaps his
"speech" should have been
entitled "What I, among others,
have contributed to the field of
open-heart surgery."
The largely medically-oriented
audience, understandably awed
when shown films of open-heart
surgery, seemed content not to
hold Deßakey to his topic during
the question period; indeed, they
seized upon the opportunity to
ask questions that showed their
knowledge of medical
terminology and contributed to
Deßakey's antiseptic image.
What's The Purpose?
What is the purpose of inviting
prominent speakers if students do
not push them to defend their
views? Not more than two
questions were asked of Deßakey
on social issues, which he coyly
sidestepped. (These questions
involved the use of research
money for preventive medicine
and the responsibility of doctors
to population control.)
Deßakey further shunned his
social responsibility as a
professional in his interview with
Live Oak, and although I would
agree that medicine is a worthier
recipient of government funds
than military and space spending,
I cannot convince myself that
Deßakey's reasons are more
humanitarian than self-serving.
Deßakey claims that "the
healthiest nations are usually the
strongest and most influential
(Daily, Nov. 1)." How can a
supposedly intelligent, aware and
responsible audience let such a
thoughtless statement go
unchallenged, when it comes from
someone who is in a position to
widely influence the public and its
policy makers, especially when
that person represents a
profession which is presumably
concerned with humanitarian
rather than monetary or political
interests?
Would It Help?
Would making third world
nations healthier make them more
influential and relieve their
cultural, moral and intellectual
oppression?
Perhaps we should spend more
on maintaining our economy so
that we can afford to keep
healthy at the expense of the rest
of the world's health.
If we cannot look to men such
as Deßakey for social leadership,
where else are we to look for it?
Certainly not from those doctors
now in training who were present
at their hero's lecture. To
challenge Deßakey would be to
challenge their own ultimate
personal goal, something that
students seem reluctant to do.
Unique Position
But students are in a unique
position to criticize objectively
the forces of their society since
they are not yet permanently
committed to any role in that
society. Any student who does
not maintain a critical and
open-minded outlook is no longer
a student, but a professional.
Am I to trust my body in the
future to such unthinking people
that continue to treat the
symptoms of a sick society
without stopping to ponder their
causes? I question the purpose of
their research when my sister
must now undergo a
hysterectomy because of
complications that occured when
Stanford interns nagged her until
she finally agreed to induce
delivery.
How about some professional
commitments on such sensitive
issues as abortion, euthanasia and
the rather poor dietary habits of
our culture?
These questions seem more
pertinent to social responsibility
in medical research, and we need
informed opinions on them from
the medical profession. The
profession should stimulate
thinking on these problems, rather
than just respond to the wants of
society as Deßakey has
maintained.
