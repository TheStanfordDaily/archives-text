## Biz School Life: Not 'Strictly Business' 
### BARBARA LANE 
Business School. The mere mention of the
institution brings immediate stereotypes to
mind: A factory which funnels earnest,
aggressive, young men in pinstriped suits
straight into the ranks of G.M., 1.8.M. and
Honeywell; an environment that extols facts
and figures and stifles creativity; a
homogenous group, of individuals with similar
backgrounds interests and aspirations.
The Stanford Graduate School of Business
dispels many of these basic misconceptions.
In fact, a brochure entitled The MBA
Experience, written by two MBA students,
states at the outset: "We have not attempted
to quantify or categorize the character of the
school, for that would be contrary to our
experience here and would serve to obscure
the vitality and diversity that is present."
The international flavor of the GSB is one
of the primary factors contributing to its
diversity. In the MBA class of 1976, 18.8

percent of the students come from foreign
countries. The heaviest concentrations of
foreign students are from France and Japan.
One student reflects, "One out of every six
of my classmates is a foreign national and my
day to day contacts with them provide me
with a perspective that extends far beyond the
business school."
It is interesting to note that in the MBA
class of 1975, over 50 percent of the students
had liberal arts majors as undergraduates.
Twenty-six percent were engineering majors,
13-14 percent science majors, and only 8
percent business majors.
Gary Williams, director of the MBA
program, explains the small percentage of
business majors by stating, "The focus of the
MBA program is to provide a broader
perspective to someone who already has
breadth in a field."
Students without a quantitative
background "struggle" through the first two

quarters of the first year, says Williams, but
show no difference in ability over a two year
period.
A first year woman who had majored in
psychology says her background in economics
was "helpful," but describes accounting as
"overwhelming." "I feel at a disadvantage"
because of lack of experience in the area, she
confesses.
18 Percent Female
Women comprised approximately 18
percent of last year's class and represent "one
of the strongest and fastest growing sectors of
the applicant pool," according to Dick
Lazarus, director of Business School
admissions and student affairs.
He feels that at Stanford, women
encounter a positive emotional enviornment
in which they are taken seriously.
One woman remarks she felt no sex-related
disadvantages at the Business School, rather
the assurance of a higher number of job
options. As for her classes "Sometimes the
professors crack sexist jokes . . . but they
usually apologize," she remarks.
Stanford's MBA program is unusual
because it provides training for persons
interested in public management as well as the
private sector. The public management option
combines the analytical training of the MBA
program with exposure to public policy issues,
and public institutions and management
problems.
Future Public Managers
Students in public management range from
the holder of a Ph.D. in psychology who
wants to become a prison warden, to a
student with an M.A. in fine arts interested in
museum management.
The wide variety of students' previous job
experience is another ingredient in the MBA
program's diversity. Only 22 percent of this
year's class entered the program directly from
undergraduate study.
Williams explains, "There is a premium
placed on job experience, but it is no more
emphasized than in the past. . . We've had the
same bias for years." He adds that often
students coming directly from undergraduate
work are "academically tired" and need a
change of pace.
Job With G.M.?
Williams notes that job experience does
not necessarily mean a job with G.M. He cites
the Peace Corps, military service, and jobs
with local, state, and federal government as
valuable general experience. "There is some
benefit to just being out for a year,"he
acknowledges.
Lazarus stresses the "importance of
bringing different perspectives into the
classroom." Students at the Business School,
he says, gain 50 percent of their knowledge
from their peers, on a day to day basis. "It is
important to make that aspect of education as
substantial as possible." He considers
diversified job experience as the key.
Senior undergraduates are commonly hit

with the panic fear "What the hell am I going
to do next?" According to Lazarus, they
often decide it's easier to continue going to
school and apply to the MBA program "not
because it's THE alternative, rather AN
alternative.
"Those with work experience have to give
up a lot to come here," he continues. "They
are more directed and have a better sense of
purpose."
Many students in the MBA program agree.
Dave Dorman, a second year student, spent
three years in the Peace Corps helping
organize a small fishing cooperative. He feels
the program would be "a lot harder without
job experience."
Deferring Admission
The GSB also offers a program which
allows students to defer admittance. It gives
students directly out of college the
opportunity to gain job experience while
confident of assured admission to the MBA
program.
Initiated by Williams, the program admits
students on a three-year basis, allowing them
to enroll at the most beneficial time. Thus,
some applicants admitted in the fall of 1974
were given the option of enrolling in the fall
0f'74,'75 or '76.
, "This is a no strings attached admittance,"
says Lazarus, in terms of what the students do
with their time off. The program was
developed, he claims, because Stanford was
"losing good people to other schools" due to
the premium on work experience.
Applications to the MBA program have
continued to rise for the past three years.

Lazarus attributes the increase to an
increasing awareness of the value of the MBA.
Business School is now viewed as Law School
has been in the past, in regard to "opening up
options," he contends.
Useless BA
"Many College graduates find their BA
about as useful as a high school diploma" and
realize the signficance of "marketable skills,"
he adds.
The Stanford MBA Program had 2700
applications last year for 300 openings.
Williams advises prospective applicants, "If
you are wavering, go out and get experience.
If you are absolutely adamant that this is
what you want, you ought to apply."
Business School is unusual, says Lazarus, in
the respect that the longer you're out, the
better your chances are of getting in.
A second year student recalls, "The first
year they try to bury you under an avalanche
of work. There are regular homework
assignments just like high school."
Another student comments, "It's
tremendously demanding in terms of time.
You're in class twice as much as
undergraduates."
Generally, however, student comments
about the MBA program (law and business),
finds the Business School "much more
human" than the Law School. "It's always
obvious where to go for problems," he says.
Summing up his experience in the MBA
program one student observes "It's not
terribly intellectual. It's a fun place, a nice
escape from the real world."

BIZ BODIESâ€”These grad students loitering in front of the Business School learn more than facts
and figures in their classes. Because of the large number of foreign students in the MBA program,
they are exposed to different cultures.
