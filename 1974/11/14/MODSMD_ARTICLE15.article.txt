When approaching the Golden Gate Bridge
from either direction, there are signs
instructing drivers to "Turn On Headlights"
for the "Daylight Test Section." What is going
on there and what exactly is being tested?
—C.L. V.
The Golden Gate Bridge headlight
maneuver is not a test at all. It is basically a
psychological trick to keep people alert.
"People like to be cooperative and like to
take part in a test," Bob Halligan, district
information officer at the State Department
of Transportation, explained. „
However, the headlight section is
inappropriate for the Golden Gate Bridge,
Halligan continued. It is normally used on
two-lane roads between completed freeways.
There are a lot of head-on collisions on the
roads because people think they're still on a
multi-lane freeway, Halligan said.
City and County of San Francisco
administrators asked the State Department of
; Transportation to implement the headlight
test because they thought it would help cut
down the number of accidents on the bridge
and the infamous Doyle Drive, Halligan said.
Because "the cost of putting up a couple
signs was minimal" Halligan said the
transportation officials agreed.
However, only 25-30 percent of the drivers
1 have participated in the headlight turn-on
project since it began about 18 months ago,
according to Halligan.
Halligan attributed the lack of cooperation
on the Golden Gate Bridge to the fact that

"there is nothing to alert the drivers to," like
a change in the number of lanes.
The bridge is multi-lane all the test section.
Halligan added that Doyle Drive and the
bridge aren't truly hazardous; they have
merely been the site of a few "spectacular"
accidents. He cited a crash a few years ago
when a Porsche, spurting from the toll gate at
115 m.p.h., careened across the dividing line
into a Mustang loaded with nine persons.
Halligan said that even when a concrete
median barrier is eventually installed to make
the dividing line more prominent, he will leave
the signs for the test section as they are now.

erotic film, Powell said, "If they're supposed
to turn you on, then they should turn you on
at least a little bit."

Is the price of the admission at the Paris
Theater really $4.50? Is it ever any cheaper?
Is it worth it? —DM.
For you porno flick fans, tickets at Palo
Alto's one and only adult theater, the Paris
Theater, are regularly $3.50. If you can find a
discount coupon in this week's Palo Alto
Times, bring it along for a $l.OO reduction.
The other adult theaters in Santa Clara
County Pussycat II in San Jose and Town &
Country in Sunnyvale charge $4. The
Pussycat reduces student tickets to $2.50.
As to whether it's worth it, George Powell,
Daily porno film critic, says, "If you've got a
high-quality double feature, then it might be
worth it" to spend $3.50. Defining a good
erotic film, Powell said, "If they're supposed
to turn you on, then they should turn you on
at least a little bit."

When approaching the Golden Gate Bridge
from either direction, there are signs
instructing drivers to "Turn On Headlights"
for the "Daylight Test Section." What is going
on there and what exactly is being tested?
—C.L. V.
The Golden Gate Bridge headlight
maneuver is not a test at all. It is basically a
psychological trick to keep people alert.
"People like to be cooperative and like to
take part in a test," Bob Halligan, district
information officer at the State Department
of Transportation, explained. „
However, the headlight section is
inappropriate for the Golden Gate Bridge,
Halligan continued. It is normally used on
two-lane roads between completed freeways.
There are a lot of head-on collisions on the
roads because people think they're still on a
multi-lane freeway, Halligan said.
City and County of San Francisco
administrators asked the State Department of
; Transportation to implement the headlight
test because they thought it would help cut
down the number of accidents on the bridge
and the infamous Doyle Drive, Halligan said.
Because "the cost of putting up a couple
signs was minimal" Halligan said the
transportation officials agreed.
However, only 25-30 percent of the drivers
1 have participated in the headlight turn-on
project since it began about 18 months ago,
according to Halligan.
Halligan attributed the lack of cooperation
on the Golden Gate Bridge to the fact that

"there is nothing to alert the drivers to," like
a change in the number of lanes.
The bridge is multi-lane all the test section.
Halligan added that Doyle Drive and the
bridge aren't truly hazardous; they have
merely been the site of a few "spectacular"
accidents. He cited a crash a few years ago
when a Porsche, spurting from the toll gate at
115 m.p.h., careened across the dividing line
into a Mustang loaded with nine persons.
Halligan said that even when a concrete
median barrier is eventually installed to make
the dividing line more prominent, he will leave
the signs for the test section as they are now.
