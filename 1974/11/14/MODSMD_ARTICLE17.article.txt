# Poli Sci Prof Cites Problems With Japanese-U.S. Relations
## 
### LONNIE ROSE WALD 
"There are, in a long-term
sense, substantial grounds for
concern" about the future of
Japanese-American relations,
Political Science Prof. Robert
Ward, said Tuesday.
"Japan's uncertainty as to the
degree of dependence which it can
place upon us" could potentially
undermine relations between the
two countries." If this continues,
Ward cautioned, "there is
increased probability that Japan
would rearm," although this is not
imminent.
Speaking on "Our Relations
with Japan: A Long Range View,"
Ward described present
U.S.-Japanese dealings as "a
mutual relationship with serious
faults on both sides."
While "Japan's national
security is fundamentally
dependent upon the United
States," at the same time, "we
must recognize the fundamental
importance of a friendly and
cooperative relationship with
Japan."
New, Non-Western State
"It is the harbinger of the
recognition that perhaps the most
important development of our
time is the emergence of the new,
non-western state," Ward
contended.
He traced the problems in the
relationship between the two
countries to Japan's lopsided
dependency upon the U.S. which
developed after World War 11.
Recent diplomatic policies
adopted by the U.S., particularly
the initiation of diplomatic
relations with China, have caused
Japan to recognize the risk
involved in such an exclusive
dependency.

Noting the difficulty of
establishing equal relations
between countries which are
politically and militarily unequal,
he urged, "a continuing search for
new levels of relationships
between the two countries."
Interests
While Ward conceded that in
the post-war period, "one of our
interests in Japan was obviously
military," the present relationship
centers mainly around economic
resources. In this area, added
Ward, Japan "is so far advanced in
many ways over any other
developing Asian state."
Viewing the "practical
consequences of Japan's economic
miracle," on trade with the U.S.

he noted that, "Unequal
advantages that Japan had in this
relationship were temporary."
"The problems of marketing
and selling abroad are very
serious," Ward said, and Japan's
economic troubles are aggravated
by a slowing of production and an
average annual wage increase of
12 percent.
"The old virtues of discipline â€ž
and frugality are giving way to the
vices of consumerism," he said.
Nevertheless, the U.S. must
still view Japan as an important
"reservoir of talent" and
recognize that U.S.-Japanese
economic relations have
"potential and real value.''
