# Small Seminars, Giant Lectures Preferred
## Students Dislike 'Middle' Classes

Small seminars and giant lecture courses both
rate tops in teaching effectiveness as viewed by
students, a new study shows.
Kenneth Wood, doctoral candidate in sociology
here, bases this finding on student evaluations of
classes ranging from less than 10 to more than 500
in size at 16 colleges.
Results are reported in the current Journal of
Higher Education in an article coauthored with
Profs. Arnold S. Linsky and Murray A. Straus of
the University of New Hampshire.
"Class size is significantly related to teaching
effectiveness as measured by student evaluations,"
they declare. The ratings decline as class size
increases from 10 to 250, then improve as classes
grow larger.
The initial increases in size lessen the degree of
student contact with faculty and result in greater
rigidity of course organization, the scholars suggest.
"Instructors are typically aware of this problem,
but in our experience do little to deal with it

except to try to avoid courses with large
enrollments or to restrict the size of the class."
Beyond a certain point, however, continued
growth in class size results in extra effort and new
methods of instruction, as well as the emergence of
highly skilled lecturers.
Faculty teaching classes between 60 and 290
students in size received below average ratings. "It
is possible their performance might be improved if
they were to adopt the teaching methods used by
those teaching. .. 300 or more students."
"However, to do so, they will probably need the
release from other teaching duties which is usually
granted to faculty who teach such giant-size
sections. There are obvious limits ih the extent to
which this can be done," the authors said.
Their findings contrast with many earlier studies
which have shown no particular range of class size
more conducive to teaching effectiveness than
others. Many of these used classroom examination
performance to judge effectiveness or adopted
arbitrary categories of large and small class size.
