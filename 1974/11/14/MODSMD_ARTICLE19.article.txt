# Stanford Grad Compiles 'Whole Earth' Sequel
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
For readers who found
inspiration or guidance in The
Last Whole Earth Catalog,
Stanford graduate Stewart Brand
has come out with a sequel, Whole
Earth Epilog.
Although the basic format and
ideology of the book remains the
same, Brand and his associates
have shifted the emphasis slightly,
hopefully to fill the needs of their
audience. The book still provides
references for healthy living and
home crafts, and has added
sections on communities and
travel.
"There are still a lot of our
readers who are into communes,"
Brand explains, "but many other
are now interested in building
communities. . . So we've got
pages and pages on things like
sewage, my God."
Brand still sees his audience as
the younger generations, but
denies that he is serving a
counter-culture. "The center of
flow has shifted," he says, so that
people with ecological awareness
dominate the culture.
Reference Guide
The Whole Earth Catalog began
as a quarterly reference guide,
providing instructions and
suggesting further resources for
ecologically sound activities from
simple crafts to home energy
sources. The large-bound edition
published in 1971 was intended to
be the last issue, The Last Whole

Earth Catalog.
But a year ago Brand and
company started the
CoEvolution Quarterly, which
Brand says was originally intended
as a supplement to the catalog.
Now, he describes the Whole
Earth Epilog as an "access to tools
supplement" to the Quarterly,
which contains articles on
concerns such as energy, society
and food.
Brand says that he depends a
lot on his own interests to decide
what to include in the catalogs.
About 30 persons, he says, are
"involved centrally" in submitting
suggestions and reviewing the
listed resources.
After they accumulate material
on a subject, such as wood carving
or furniture building, they "bring
in an expert to sort through it,"
Brand explains. Brand himself
makes the final editing and space
decisions.
Local Resources
Brand and about 20 associates
put together the original Last
Whole Earth Catalog in Menlo
Park, at the Whole Earth Truck
Store and Catalog. This bookstore
still carries information on local
resources, which Brand says are
not appropriate for nationwide
publications.
The Epilog was compiled in
Sausalito, with some of the
original contributors.
Instead of Divine Right and his
van, the Epilog is laced with the

exploits of Tongue Fu and
Captain Mediafreak. Another
more "earthy" addition is a
capsule of a book called The
Photographic Anatomy of the
Human Body, including a
two-page spread showing a
cross-section of an 18-year-old
virgin.
The Epilog also includes new
sections on travel and black
interests.
Changing Interests
"Interest in India, the
pilgrimage to holy places and all
that, seems to be dimming,"
Brand says. "Enthusiasm is now
turning to Peru and South
America generally. People are also
trying to find their way into
China."
The Epilog is 100 pages shorter
and $1 cheaper than its $5
predecessor. The initial press run
of 350,000 copies was only
released in October, but Penguin
Books has already ordered
another run of 100,000 copies.
Brand was a member of Ken
Kesey's original Merry Pranksters,
the group which helped launch
psychadelics and organized the
1966 Trips Festival.
