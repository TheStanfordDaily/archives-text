# Thai Urges Students' Political Aid
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
The latest communication from
Nguyen Huu Thai, a South Vietnamese
journalist who has accepted the
ASSU's Guest Professorship, urges
students here to "do everything for me
in the United States, including
pressuring on Congress, publishing my
case, etc ... '
Jim Regan, chairman of the
Committee to Invite Thai to Stanford,
said "this is quite different from what
he's wanted in the past. Now he has
given us the green light to do
something of a more public and
political nature."
Thai was invited to be a guest
professor last spring after students
approved a fee assessment granting
funds to bring him to the United
States.
At the time, he was under house
arrest in Saigon following his release
from jail. Last month, the country's
armed forces granted Thai a formal
discharge. He is presently in Saigon,
working for the release of two
prisoners, one of whom has also
received an invitation to teach in the
U.S.
The Guest Professorship Board
continues to search for an alternative
guest professor. "There's a dry well on
the first leads," said board member
Kevin O'Grady, a medical school
student. "The people whom we
contacted were offered more attractive
interests elsewhere."
Developments Expected Soon
O'Grady said "presumably"
something will develop out of the
current leads within the next few
weeks. "If the people we have in mind
don't come through by winter quarter
then we'll work on a small project for
spring or start plans for work on next
fall," said O'Grady.
Although Thai writes that the
likelihood of his appearance here "is
certainly 100 percent naught," Regan
is encouraged by the fact that Thai
published Stanford's invitation in local
papers to, as Thai says, "make enough
pressure and embarrassment for the
Saigon authority to consider seriously
my exit visa request."
Regan said that both sides are
encouraged by this the South
Vietnamese with the knowledge that
Americans are working for the release
of political prisoners and the
Americans by Thai's pleas for help.
Leading Opponent Of Thieu
One of these papers, Dien Tin,
employed Thai before his arrest in
1972 and is the largest newspaper
opposing the regime of South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van
Thieu.
Regan said that Thieu probably will
not crack down further on Thai
because "Any obvious repression or
brutality will result in more
congressional cutbacks. Thieu can't
afford that. It really looks like the
Thieu government is on such shaky
ground that it could collapse in the
near future."
According to Regan, Thieu's
waning power if favorable for Thai. "It
encourages the Third Force to speak
out."

The Committee to Invite Thai to

Stanford now plans to send the latest
available information to a handful of
congressmen who have supported Thai
in the past, including Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park), Rep.
Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.), Rep Donald M.
Fraser (D-Minn.), Sen. Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.), Sen. John Tunney
(D-Calif.), and Rep. Augustus Hawkins
(D-Calif.).
The committee also plans to
contact "organizations and people
who are working on ending the war
through cutting aid," said Regan.
These include the Indochina Resource
Center in Washington D.C., the
Indochina Peace Campaign, radio
station KPFA in Berkeley, and the San
Francisco and Philadelphia National
Office of the American Friends Service
Committee.
There is a dual purpose to these
communications, said Regan. The
committee wants to "try to publicize
Thai's situation and make people in
this country aware of his experience
particularly those working with
Indochina" and it hopes to "clarify
what kind of help they [the various
organizations] can give and what kind
of strategy to use" in obtaining Thai's
exit visa.
Regan claims a "realistic target is to
try to shoot for him being here spring
quarter. I don't see him having a class
winter quarter."

There is a dual purpose to these
communications, said Regan. The
committee wants to "try to publicize
Thai's situation and make people in
this country aware of his experience
particularly those working with
Indochina" and it hopes to "clarify
what kind of help they [the various
organizations] can give and what kind
of strategy to use" in obtaining Thai's
exit visa.
Regan claims a "realistic target is to
try to shoot for him being here spring
quarter. I don't see him having a class
winter quarter."
The latest communication from
Nguyen Huu Thai, a South Vietnamese
journalist who has accepted the
ASSU's Guest Professorship, urges
students here to "do everything for me
in the United States, including
pressuring on Congress, publishing my
case, etc ... '
Jim Regan, chairman of the
Committee to Invite Thai to Stanford,
said "this is quite different from what
he's wanted in the past. Now he has
given us the green light to do
something of a more public and
political nature."
Thai was invited to be a guest
professor last spring after students
approved a fee assessment granting
funds to bring him to the United
States.
At the time, he was under house
arrest in Saigon following his release
from jail. Last month, the country's
armed forces granted Thai a formal
discharge. He is presently in Saigon,
working for the release of two
prisoners, one of whom has also
received an invitation to teach in the
U.S.
The Guest Professorship Board
continues to search for an alternative
guest professor. "There's a dry well on
the first leads," said board member
Kevin O'Grady, a medical school
student. "The people whom we
contacted were offered more attractive
interests elsewhere."
Developments Expected Soon
O'Grady said "presumably"
something will develop out of the
current leads within the next few
weeks. "If the people we have in mind
don't come through by winter quarter
then we'll work on a small project for
spring or start plans for work on next
fall," said O'Grady.
Although Thai writes that the
likelihood of his appearance here "is
certainly 100 percent naught," Regan
is encouraged by the fact that Thai
published Stanford's invitation in local
papers to, as Thai says, "make enough
pressure and embarrassment for the
Saigon authority to consider seriously
my exit visa request."
Regan said that both sides are
encouraged by this the South
Vietnamese with the knowledge that
Americans are working for the release
of political prisoners and the
Americans by Thai's pleas for help.
Leading Opponent Of Thieu
One of these papers, Dien Tin,
employed Thai before his arrest in
1972 and is the largest newspaper
opposing the regime of South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van
Thieu.
Regan said that Thieu probably will
not crack down further on Thai
because "Any obvious repression or
brutality will result in more
congressional cutbacks. Thieu can't
afford that. It really looks like the
Thieu government is on such shaky
ground that it could collapse in the
near future."
According to Regan, Thieu's
waning power if favorable for Thai. "It
encourages the Third Force to speak
out."
