# 'Janis': A Vivid, True Portrait
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
What saves Janis from
becoming a Midnight Special for
the movie screen is the magnetic
quality of its subject blues-rock
singer Janis Joplin.
Joplin died from a drug
overdose in October, 1970, at the
age of 27. But this film is more a
portrait than a eulogy.
At times, it is brutal; during
the concert sequences, the camera
zeroes in on the singer's face,
baring every pore, every pimple,
| every wrinkle, every bruise, every
1 grimace, every sweat-soaked
strand of hair.
But sandwiched in between the
15 musical numbers are brief
glfmpses of the quiet fire that
underlies Joplin's explosive
f performances. "It's all real," she
tells a British interviewer. "It's not
a veneer."
Superstar's Story
Universal is billing Janis as a
film which "traces her career from
her first rehearsals and
performances with Big Brother
and the Holding Company [in
1966] through superstardom to
her tragic death in Hollywood."
However, after viewing this
96-minute collection of concert,
interview and rehearsal footage,
viewers who are unfamiliar with
the chronology of Joplin's career
probably will not be able to tell
the difference between one Joplin
band and another when they leave
the theater.
In fact, those who don't
appreciate Joplin's gritty voice or
\ her emotion-packed style should
probably leave before the film
begins.
Lively and Loud
But put Janis on your "must
see" list if you can enjoy her
performances of hits like "Move
. Over," "Ball and Chain" and
"Piece of My Heart," played at
the highest volume your local
theater operator will permit. "The
biggest problem with the film,"
says producer F.R. "Budge"
Crawley, "is that exhibitors don't
play it loud enough."
' But there's more to Janis than
her soulful wailing. She tells one
concert audience an anecdote
about her life in the
Haight-Ashbury, and does her best
to ignore anyone who tries to tell
her how to sing during a recording
session of "Summertime" for the
Cheap Thrills album with Big
Brother and the Holding
Company. '
Fortunately, Crawley decided
to eliminate most cliche shots of

rock festival crowds and musicians
who look as plugged-in as the
amplifiers.
Unlike the makers of a recent
film biography of Jimi Hendrix,
Crawley also avoids the
temptation to pad his movie with
the "talking heads" of those who
remember Joplin. When a
cameraman approaches one Joplin
fan a clean-cut army wife living
in Germany she tells him to
film Joplin, not her.
Masterful Camerawork
Later, we see the ail-American
army bride rocking out in the
background as Joplin electrifies
the audience in a remarkable,
uncut European concert sequence.
Janis tells us more about how
Joplin related to her fans and
less about how they reacted to
her.
"If you can make a film about
what Janis meant to her fans, you
can go ahead," Joplin's parents
told Crawley when he conceived
the idea for the movie.
Crawley explained at a recent
preview showing of the film that
"Mrs. Joplin was fairly
permissive," and didn't object to
the seven uses of the word
"fuck" that earned Janis its "R"
rating.
But one scene was cut at the
request of Joplin's mother. It was
part of a sequence from a train
trip the singer made across Canada
with a group of rock musicians.
"She was a little stoned and
drinking Southern Comfort,"
Crawley said.
No Southern Comfort
Aside from deference to the
wishes of her parents, the film
avoids portraying Joplin's drinking
problem because shots of the
singer gulping booze were not too
"interesting," Crawley explained.

What is perhaps the most
revealing sequence in the film
begins with a tape of Joplin's
appearance on the Dick Cavett
show. When Ivy-Leager Cavett
claims he's a "swinger," Joplin
replies by pointing out his
wing-tip shoes. Then she
reminisces about growing up in
Port Arthur, Texas. "They
laughed me out of town, out of
class and out of the state, man,"
she tells Cavett, "and I'm going
home."
The girl who left her
hometown as a misfit returns as a
funky superstar, and TV news
cameras record her appearance at
her high school reunion. Her
bravado fades as she recalls what
her high school days were really
like. When an interviewer asks
whether she remembers her senior
prom, she replies nervously "No
. . . nobody every asked me."
Background Tease
But the high school reunion
scenes and a few still shots of baby
Janis from the family album give
only a teasing glimpse of what
drove Joplin out of Texas and
into the San Francisco of the 60s.
The closing montage of stills that
flashes to the tune of "Me and
Bobby McGee" somehow leaves
the viewer hanging.
But because the makers of
Janis let the singer tell her own
story in her own words, her
message is clear: She le'ft Port
Arthur in 1963 to seek
"sincerity" and came upon
stardom through a fateful
combination of chance and talent.
And although she attracted
thousands of fans because she had
"something that Peggy Lee is
lacking" her cries for sincerity and
understanding were never
answered.

ALWAYS TRYINGâ€”Janis Joplin wasn't always physically at her
finest, but she everything in every single concert. Janis, which is
playing in San Francisco, attempts to chronicle the superstar's final
years. The movie features more than 14 numbers sung by the 60s
queen of rock and blues.
