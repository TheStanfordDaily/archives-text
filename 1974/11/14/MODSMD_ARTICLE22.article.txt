# Last Weekend At Winterland
## Greg Allman Gives Grand Performance 
### STEPHEN WALT 
Gregg Allman's first words to
the Winterland audience last
Friday were "the Bay Area is the
finest place to play, you people
are the most critical, 'cause you've
all heard the best." He spent the
next two hours proving that he
and his 12 supporting
musicians were completely
worthy of a critical listening and
lived up to all expectations.
There is a tendency when
reviewing a solo concert by
someone usually associated with a
group to make comparisons
between the individual's effort
and his role in the group's
collective sound.
To compare Gregg Allman as a
solo performer with his role in the
Allman Brothers' Band would
simply be invalid. It's a different
trip. There are natural

duplications of material, the
distinctive vocal style is the same,
but the feeling is different and
valid in its own right.
Opening Act
The show was opened by
Cowboy, another Macon, Georgia
product that has been connected
with the Allmans for the last few
years. Their sound is a basically
country-rock similar to the Eagles
and Poco, but possessing much
more depth and variety. Their
music has frequent jazz overtones
provided mainly by the pianist
doubling on soprano saxophone,
and also by the group's sliding in
and out of the straight
country-rock idiom very
effectively.
Cowboy's other chief resource
is the stinging slide guitar work of
Tommy Talton. He has appeared
on the two most recent Allman

albums, Brothers and Sisters and
Laid Back and handled the solo
chores easily on Friday. His high
intensity and trebly solos
consistently brought cheers from
the crowd. Cowboy earned one
genuinely deserved encore and
later returned to back up Allman.
After minor delays setting up
equipment for his act, Gregg
Allman came on, greeted the
crowd and swung right into
"Don't Mess up a Good Thing"
from his solo LP. Backed by
Cowboy, Allman Brothers Chuck
Leavell (keyboards) and Lamar
Williams (bass), a five piece horn
section and two girl singers, he
had no trouble filling the hall with
solid yet not overpowering sound.
Acoustics problems with such a
large group were for the most part
solved, and good sound balance
was achieved.

The songs were familiar, tunes
from his solo album or Allman
Brothers standards, each with a
slightly different interpretation.
The crowd responded to each
selection with loud applause, and
Allman responded warmly,
thanking the audience and
commenting, "You don't know
how much this means to me."
Songs in the first set included:
"Stand Back," "These Days,"
"Queen of Hearts" and "Please
Call Home." After the first hour
he took a short break and came
back promptly, ready to give some
more.
Favorite Opener
The second set opened with
the favorite "Midnight Rider"
done in the manner of his solo
album. Chuck Leavell provided a
haunting electric piano solo, quite
in keeping with the desperate
nature of the song. The music
continued for another 45 minutes,
featuring "Multi-colored Lady"
and "All My Friends" among
others, and closed with a rousing
version of the gospel classic "Will
the Circle Be Unbroken?" Gregg
stood up, thanked the crowd and
was gone.
Immediately after, the crowd
began to stamp its feet and in the
tradition of the Dylan tour, lit
matches began to flicker
throughout the hall. The
musicians returned for two encore
numbers. The first began with an
unmetered piano and soprano sax
duet which then halted almost
in anticipation and then the
band came in on the searing
introduction to the classic "That's
Not My Cross To Bear."
With the identity of the song
established, the audience roared
its approval and the band
responded with an excellent
rendition. For his final number,
Gregg started clapping his hands,
counted in the band and gave a
twenty minute version of Bobby
Bland's "Turn on Your
Lovelight." He rose in response to

the cheers, said "Good night and
God bless you" and departed. The
applause continued, but the
emcee came out and made it clear
the music was over, after 51/2
hours.
Gregg All man as a solo
performer is distinctly aware of
both his assets and limitations. He
is primarily a singer and
songwriter, not an instrumentalist,
although his organ and guitar
work is deft and tasteful in a
supportive role. He has had the
wisdom on this tour to surround
himself with the caliber of people
that can provide the same kind of
support he has been accustomed
to with the Brothers, leaving him
free to pursue what he does best.
His vocal style is unique
"resigned and eternally aching" as
one critic put it. He does not
merely shout at the microphone
but often cups his hand around
his mouth and ear to listen, to be
sure of his sound. This kind of
effort and sensitivity to providing
a good show is what makes an
Allman concert emotionally,
musically and intellectually
satisfying, as he proved on Friday
night.

effectively.
Cowboy's other chief resource
is the stinging slide guitar work of
Tommy Talton. He has appeared
on the two most recent Allman

albums, Brothers and Sisters and
Laid Back and handled the solo
chores easily on Friday. His high
intensity and trebly solos
consistently brought cheers from
the crowd. Cowboy earned one
genuinely deserved encore and
later returned to back up Allman.
After minor delays setting up
equipment for his act, Gregg
Allman came on, greeted the
crowd and swung right into
"Don't Mess up a Good Thing"
from his solo LP. Backed by
Cowboy, Allman Brothers Chuck
Leavell (keyboards) and Lamar
Williams (bass), a five piece horn
section and two girl singers, he
had no trouble filling the hall with
solid yet not overpowering sound.
Acoustics problems with such a
large group were for the most part
solved, and good sound balance
was achieved.

The songs were familiar, tunes
from his solo album or Allman
Brothers standards, each with a
slightly different interpretation.
The crowd responded to each
selection with loud applause, and
Allman responded warmly,
thanking the audience and
commenting, "You don't know
how much this means to me."
Songs in the first set included:
"Stand Back," "These Days,"
"Queen of Hearts" and "Please
Call Home." After the first hour
he took a short break and came
back promptly, ready to give some
more.
Favorite Opener
The second set opened with
the favorite "Midnight Rider"
done in the manner of his solo
album. Chuck Leavell provided a
haunting electric piano solo, quite
in keeping with the desperate
nature of the song. The music
continued for another 45 minutes,
featuring "Multi-colored Lady"
and "All My Friends" among
others, and closed with a rousing
version of the gospel classic "Will
the Circle Be Unbroken?" Gregg
stood up, thanked the crowd and
was gone.
Immediately after, the crowd
began to stamp its feet and in the
tradition of the Dylan tour, lit
matches began to flicker
throughout the hall. The
musicians returned for two encore
numbers. The first began with an
unmetered piano and soprano sax
duet which then halted almost
in anticipation and then the
band came in on the searing
introduction to the classic "That's
Not My Cross To Bear."
With the identity of the song
established, the audience roared
its approval and the band
responded with an excellent
rendition. For his final number,
Gregg started clapping his hands,
counted in the band and gave a
twenty minute version of Bobby
Bland's "Turn on Your
Lovelight." He rose in response to

the cheers, said "Good night and
God bless you" and departed. The
applause continued, but the
emcee came out and made it clear
the music was over, after 51/2
hours.
Gregg All man as a solo
performer is distinctly aware of
both his assets and limitations. He
is primarily a singer and
songwriter, not an instrumentalist,
although his organ and guitar
work is deft and tasteful in a
supportive role. He has had the
wisdom on this tour to surround
himself with the caliber of people
that can provide the same kind of
support he has been accustomed
to with the Brothers, leaving him
free to pursue what he does best.
His vocal style is unique
"resigned and eternally aching" as
one critic put it. He does not
merely shout at the microphone
but often cups his hand around
his mouth and ear to listen, to be
sure of his sound. This kind of
effort and sensitivity to providing
a good show is what makes an
Allman concert emotionally,
musically and intellectually
satisfying, as he proved on Friday
night.
Gregg Allman's first words to
the Winterland audience last
Friday were "the Bay Area is the
finest place to play, you people
are the most critical, 'cause you've
all heard the best." He spent the
next two hours proving that he
and his 12 supporting
musicians were completely
worthy of a critical listening and
lived up to all expectations.
There is a tendency when
reviewing a solo concert by
someone usually associated with a
group to make comparisons
between the individual's effort
and his role in the group's
collective sound.
To compare Gregg Allman as a
solo performer with his role in the
Allman Brothers' Band would
simply be invalid. It's a different
trip. There are natural

duplications of material, the
distinctive vocal style is the same,
but the feeling is different and
valid in its own right.
Opening Act
The show was opened by
Cowboy, another Macon, Georgia
product that has been connected
with the Allmans for the last few
years. Their sound is a basically
country-rock similar to the Eagles
and Poco, but possessing much
more depth and variety. Their
music has frequent jazz overtones
provided mainly by the pianist
doubling on soprano saxophone,
and also by the group's sliding in
and out of the straight
country-rock idiom very
effectively.

Call Home." After the first hour
he took a short break and came
back promptly, ready to give some
more.
Favorite Opener
The second set opened with
the favorite "Midnight Rider"
done in the manner of his solo
album. Chuck Leavell provided a
haunting electric piano solo, quite
in keeping with the desperate
nature of the song. The music
continued for another 45 minutes,
featuring "Multi-colored Lady"
and "All My Friends" among
others, and closed with a rousing
version of the gospel classic "Will
the Circle Be Unbroken?" Gregg
stood up, thanked the crowd and
was gone.
Immediately after, the crowd
began to stamp its feet and in the
tradition of the Dylan tour, lit
matches began to flicker
throughout the hall. The
musicians returned for two encore
numbers. The first began with an
unmetered piano and soprano sax
duet which then halted almost
in anticipation and then the
band came in on the searing
introduction to the classic "That's
Not My Cross To Bear."
With the identity of the song
established, the audience roared
its approval and the band
responded with an excellent
rendition. For his final number,
Gregg started clapping his hands,
counted in the band and gave a
twenty minute version of Bobby
Bland's "Turn on Your
Lovelight." He rose in response to

the cheers, said "Good night and
God bless you" and departed. The
applause continued, but the
emcee came out and made it clear
the music was over, after 51/2
hours.
Gregg All man as a solo
performer is distinctly aware of
both his assets and limitations. He
is primarily a singer and
songwriter, not an instrumentalist,
although his organ and guitar
work is deft and tasteful in a
supportive role. He has had the
wisdom on this tour to surround
himself with the caliber of people
that can provide the same kind of
support he has been accustomed
to with the Brothers, leaving him
free to pursue what he does best.
His vocal style is unique
"resigned and eternally aching" as
one critic put it. He does not
merely shout at the microphone
but often cups his hand around
his mouth and ear to listen, to be
sure of his sound. This kind of
effort and sensitivity to providing
a good show is what makes an
Allman concert emotionally,
musically and intellectually
satisfying, as he proved on Friday
night.
Gregg Allman's first words to
the Winterland audience last
Friday were "the Bay Area is the
finest place to play, you people
are the most critical, 'cause you've
all heard the best." He spent the
next two hours proving that he
and his 12 supporting
musicians were completely
worthy of a critical listening and
lived up to all expectations.
There is a tendency when
reviewing a solo concert by
someone usually associated with a
group to make comparisons
between the individual's effort
and his role in the group's
collective sound.
To compare Gregg Allman as a
solo performer with his role in the
Allman Brothers' Band would
simply be invalid. It's a different
trip. There are natural

duplications of material, the
distinctive vocal style is the same,
but the feeling is different and
valid in its own right.
Opening Act
The show was opened by
Cowboy, another Macon, Georgia
product that has been connected
with the Allmans for the last few
years. Their sound is a basically
country-rock similar to the Eagles
and Poco, but possessing much
more depth and variety. Their
music has frequent jazz overtones
provided mainly by the pianist
doubling on soprano saxophone,
and also by the group's sliding in
and out of the straight
country-rock idiom very
effectively.
Cowboy's other chief resource
is the stinging slide guitar work of
Tommy Talton. He has appeared
on the two most recent Allman

albums, Brothers and Sisters and
Laid Back and handled the solo
chores easily on Friday. His high
intensity and trebly solos
consistently brought cheers from
the crowd. Cowboy earned one
genuinely deserved encore and
later returned to back up Allman.
After minor delays setting up
equipment for his act, Gregg
Allman came on, greeted the
crowd and swung right into
"Don't Mess up a Good Thing"
from his solo LP. Backed by
Cowboy, Allman Brothers Chuck
Leavell (keyboards) and Lamar
Williams (bass), a five piece horn
section and two girl singers, he
had no trouble filling the hall with
solid yet not overpowering sound.
Acoustics problems with such a
large group were for the most part
solved, and good sound balance
was achieved.

The songs were familiar, tunes
from his solo album or Allman
Brothers standards, each with a
slightly different interpretation.
The crowd responded to each
selection with loud applause, and
Allman responded warmly,
thanking the audience and
commenting, "You don't know
how much this means to me."
Songs in the first set included:
"Stand Back," "These Days,"
"Queen of Hearts" and "Please
Call Home." After the first hour
he took a short break and came
back promptly, ready to give some
