Guerrilla: 'Create New Palestine 9
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Guerrilla leader
Yasir Arafat carried his cause to the United Nations
yesterday offering the world a choice of continued
violence or of peace based on the creation of a
Palestinian state on Israeli-occupied land.
In an unprecedented appearance before the
General Assembly, the head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization urged Americans and Jews
everywhere to turn their backs on Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in
Jerusalem that Arafat based his speech on principles
that threaten Israel's existence but that the Israeli
government must not abandon the search for peace.
Arafat said the United Nations, swelled by the
addition in recent years of newly independent Third
World countries, now "more clearly reflects the will
of the international community" than it did when
Israel was created in Palestine.
He said Zionist ideology and Israeli leadership
offer only "perpetual bloodshed, endless war and
continuous servitude."
Shaking his finger at the end of an hour and
45-minute speech to the heavily guarded assembly,
Arafat said:
"I have come bearing an olive branch and a
freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive branch
fall from my hand."
A holster and what appeared to be the butt of a
pistol protruded from Arafat's right hip pocket
when he clasped his hands over his head before and
after he spoke.
One of his bodyguards told a newsman it was a
gun and said: "It's not only real, it's loaded."
More than demonstrators massed opposite
the U.N. complex, which was sealed off from the
public by police lines.
They chanted, "Murderers! Murderers!" and
waved Israeli flags and placards with inscriptions
such as "U.N. Haven for Child Murderers."
A pro-Palestinian group was also demonstrating
in New York City, but the two groups were
separated.
Coal Strike May End Nov. 25
WASHINGTON President Arnold Miller of the
striking United Mine Workers announced yesterday
that the union had reached tentative agreement with
coal operators on a "very good contract" which he
said could end the nationwide coal strike by Nov.
25.
Emerging from a day-long bargaining session,
Miller said he thought he would have no trouble
selling the proposed agreement to the 120,000
rank-and-file union members, who must vote their
approval before the mines can be reopened.

"The benefit package will allow us to go back
and eradicate some of the gross inequities that have
existed for years," Miller told newsmen.
The total cost of the contract was not disclosed,
but inducations were that it could prove to be the
heftiest major labor settlement this year.
Coal industry sorces estimated the total increase
in pay and benefits for miners would amount to 46
percent during the life of the three-year pact, while
union sources put the over-all increase at closer to
40 percent.
The contract, if approved, would provide wage
increases of nine percent the first year and three
percent in each of the next two years.
The miners would also receive, for the first time,
cost-of-living increases pegged to increases in the
government's consumer price index.
The union chief immediately summoned his
38-member bargaining council from the coal fields
to a meeting here today to consider the tentative
offer.
Judge Picks 3 To Examine Nixon
WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica appointed a panel of three doctors yesterday
to examine former President Richard M. Nixon and
determine if he is able to testify in the Watergate
cover-up trial.
Sirica signed an order authorizing and directing
the doctors "to conduct such examination as they
deem necessary and appropriate and, thereafter, to
advise the court..." by Nov. 29 of Nixon's status.
Nixon will be discharged from the hospital
today, 23 days after he was admitted for treatment
of phlebitis, a hospital spokesman confirmed last
night.
"Tomorrow is discharge day" for Nixon, said a
spokesman for Memorial Hospital Medical Center of
Long Beach where Nixon has been hospitalized
since Oct. 23.
Judge Sirica signed his order after a day in which
a former New York police detective and a
Mississippi oil man testified at the Watergate
cover-up trial about their role in the attempt to
contain the investigation of the Watergate break-in.
Fred C. La√üue of Jackson, Miss., testified that
two days after the June 17, 1972, break-in former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell suggested that Jeb
Stuart Magruder burn files containing information
from bugs at the Democratic headquarters.
Anthony T. Ulasewicz, a former New York City
police detective, described how he left thousands of
dollars in airport lockers where it was picked up my
Mrs. E. Howard Hunt, wife of one of the break-in

defendants.
Rockefeller Denies 'Cover-Up'
WASHINGTON Bristling at comparisons with
the Watergate scandal, Vice President-designate
Nelson A. Rockefeller denied yesterday that he
tried to cover up his role in publication of a book
critical of a campaign opponent.
Rockefeller blamed his poor memory for his
earlier statement that he had no connection with
the campaign book. But he apologized for his faulty
recollections and accepted full responsibility for the
incident.
As the Senate Rules Committee opened a second
round of hearings on his nomination, Rockefeller
also defended his large gifts and loans to friends and
associates as humanitarian and noncorrupting. He
said his family's immense wealth and influence
should not bar him from being vice president.
As a national radio and television audience
listened, Rockefeller asked the committee:
"Am I the kind of man who would use his wealth
improperly in public office?
"Would my family background somehow limit
and blind me, so that I would not be able to see and
serve the general good of Americans? I think the
answer is no. I would not behave improperly. And I
would not be limited or blinded," he replied.
Morton Resurrects Gas Tax Idea
WASHINGTON Interior Secretary Rogers C.B.
Morton resurrected yesterday the proposal to raise
gasoline taxes to save fuel, an idea killed earlier by
President Ford.
Morton told reporters he thought Ford's
rejection of the idea stemmed from a belief it could
not get through Congress.
But Morton, the President's top energy official,
said he had economists analyzing the idea and
planned to discuss it with key congressmen next
Monday.
Federal Energy Administrator John C. Sawhill
had openly proposed a 10-to-30 cent surtax on
gasoline to discourage consumption. Ironically, his
public advocacy of the idea was widely viewed as
one of the reasons Ford at Morton's instigation
obtained Sawhill's resignation.
Morton acknowledged that Ford had stated there
would be no added gasoline tax under his
administration.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through Friday but with variable high
cloudiness and patchy morning fog. Little
temperature change. Lows tonight in the 40s to low
50s. Highs today and Friday in mid 60s to mid 70s.

Rockefeller Denies 'Cover-Up'
WASHINGTON Bristling at comparisons with
the Watergate scandal, Vice President-designate
Nelson A. Rockefeller denied yesterday that he
tried to cover up his role in publication of a book
critical of a campaign opponent.
Rockefeller blamed his poor memory for his
earlier statement that he had no connection with
the campaign book. But he apologized for his faulty
recollections and accepted full responsibility for the
incident.
As the Senate Rules Committee opened a second
round of hearings on his nomination, Rockefeller
also defended his large gifts and loans to friends and
associates as humanitarian and noncorrupting. He
said his family's immense wealth and influence
should not bar him from being vice president.
As a national radio and television audience
listened, Rockefeller asked the committee:
"Am I the kind of man who would use his wealth
improperly in public office?
"Would my family background somehow limit
and blind me, so that I would not be able to see and
serve the general good of Americans? I think the
answer is no. I would not behave improperly. And I
would not be limited or blinded," he replied.
Morton Resurrects Gas Tax Idea
WASHINGTON Interior Secretary Rogers C.B.
Morton resurrected yesterday the proposal to raise
gasoline taxes to save fuel, an idea killed earlier by
President Ford.
Morton told reporters he thought Ford's
rejection of the idea stemmed from a belief it could
not get through Congress.
But Morton, the President's top energy official,
said he had economists analyzing the idea and
planned to discuss it with key congressmen next
Monday.
Federal Energy Administrator John C. Sawhill
had openly proposed a 10-to-30 cent surtax on
gasoline to discourage consumption. Ironically, his
public advocacy of the idea was widely viewed as
one of the reasons Ford at Morton's instigation
obtained Sawhill's resignation.
Morton acknowledged that Ford had stated there
would be no added gasoline tax under his
administration.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through Friday but with variable high

Guerrilla: 'Create New Palestine 9
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Guerrilla leader
Yasir Arafat carried his cause to the United Nations
yesterday offering the world a choice of continued
violence or of peace based on the creation of a
Palestinian state on Israeli-occupied land.
In an unprecedented appearance before the
General Assembly, the head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization urged Americans and Jews
everywhere to turn their backs on Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in
Jerusalem that Arafat based his speech on principles
that threaten Israel's existence but that the Israeli
government must not abandon the search for peace.
Arafat said the United Nations, swelled by the
addition in recent years of newly independent Third
World countries, now "more clearly reflects the will
of the international community" than it did when
Israel was created in Palestine.
He said Zionist ideology and Israeli leadership
offer only "perpetual bloodshed, endless war and
continuous servitude."
Shaking his finger at the end of an hour and
45-minute speech to the heavily guarded assembly,
Arafat said:
"I have come bearing an olive branch and a
freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive branch
fall from my hand."
A holster and what appeared to be the butt of a
pistol protruded from Arafat's right hip pocket
when he clasped his hands over his head before and
after he spoke.
One of his bodyguards told a newsman it was a
gun and said: "It's not only real, it's loaded."
More than demonstrators massed opposite
the U.N. complex, which was sealed off from the
public by police lines.
They chanted, "Murderers! Murderers!" and
waved Israeli flags and placards with inscriptions
such as "U.N. Haven for Child Murderers."
A pro-Palestinian group was also demonstrating
in New York City, but the two groups were
separated.
Coal Strike May End Nov. 25
WASHINGTON President Arnold Miller of the
striking United Mine Workers announced yesterday
that the union had reached tentative agreement with
coal operators on a "very good contract" which he
said could end the nationwide coal strike by Nov.
25.
Emerging from a day-long bargaining session,
Miller said he thought he would have no trouble
selling the proposed agreement to the 120,000
rank-and-file union members, who must vote their
approval before the mines can be reopened.

"The benefit package will allow us to go back
and eradicate some of the gross inequities that have
existed for years," Miller told newsmen.
The total cost of the contract was not disclosed,
but inducations were that it could prove to be the
heftiest major labor settlement this year.
Coal industry sorces estimated the total increase
in pay and benefits for miners would amount to 46
percent during the life of the three-year pact, while
union sources put the over-all increase at closer to
40 percent.
The contract, if approved, would provide wage
increases of nine percent the first year and three
percent in each of the next two years.
The miners would also receive, for the first time,
cost-of-living increases pegged to increases in the
government's consumer price index.
The union chief immediately summoned his
38-member bargaining council from the coal fields
to a meeting here today to consider the tentative
offer.
Judge Picks 3 To Examine Nixon
WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica appointed a panel of three doctors yesterday
to examine former President Richard M. Nixon and
determine if he is able to testify in the Watergate
cover-up trial.
Sirica signed an order authorizing and directing
the doctors "to conduct such examination as they
deem necessary and appropriate and, thereafter, to
advise the court..." by Nov. 29 of Nixon's status.
Nixon will be discharged from the hospital
today, 23 days after he was admitted for treatment
of phlebitis, a hospital spokesman confirmed last
night.
"Tomorrow is discharge day" for Nixon, said a
spokesman for Memorial Hospital Medical Center of
Long Beach where Nixon has been hospitalized
since Oct. 23.
Judge Sirica signed his order after a day in which
a former New York police detective and a
Mississippi oil man testified at the Watergate
cover-up trial about their role in the attempt to
contain the investigation of the Watergate break-in.

striking United Mine Workers announced yesterday
that the union had reached tentative agreement with
coal operators on a "very good contract" which he
said could end the nationwide coal strike by Nov.
25.
Emerging from a day-long bargaining session,
Miller said he thought he would have no trouble
selling the proposed agreement to the 120,000
rank-and-file union members, who must vote their
approval before the mines can be reopened.

"The benefit package will allow us to go back
and eradicate some of the gross inequities that have
existed for years," Miller told newsmen.
The total cost of the contract was not disclosed,
but inducations were that it could prove to be the
heftiest major labor settlement this year.
Coal industry sorces estimated the total increase
in pay and benefits for miners would amount to 46
percent during the life of the three-year pact, while
union sources put the over-all increase at closer to
40 percent.
The contract, if approved, would provide wage
increases of nine percent the first year and three
percent in each of the next two years.
The miners would also receive, for the first time,
cost-of-living increases pegged to increases in the
government's consumer price index.
The union chief immediately summoned his
38-member bargaining council from the coal fields
to a meeting here today to consider the tentative
offer.
Judge Picks 3 To Examine Nixon
WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica appointed a panel of three doctors yesterday
to examine former President Richard M. Nixon and
determine if he is able to testify in the Watergate
cover-up trial.
Sirica signed an order authorizing and directing
the doctors "to conduct such examination as they
deem necessary and appropriate and, thereafter, to
advise the court..." by Nov. 29 of Nixon's status.
Nixon will be discharged from the hospital
today, 23 days after he was admitted for treatment
of phlebitis, a hospital spokesman confirmed last
night.
"Tomorrow is discharge day" for Nixon, said a
spokesman for Memorial Hospital Medical Center of
Long Beach where Nixon has been hospitalized
since Oct. 23.
Judge Sirica signed his order after a day in which
a former New York police detective and a
Mississippi oil man testified at the Watergate
cover-up trial about their role in the attempt to
contain the investigation of the Watergate break-in.
Fred C. La√üue of Jackson, Miss., testified that
two days after the June 17, 1972, break-in former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell suggested that Jeb
Stuart Magruder burn files containing information
from bugs at the Democratic headquarters.
Anthony T. Ulasewicz, a former New York City
police detective, described how he left thousands of
dollars in airport lockers where it was picked up my
Mrs. E. Howard Hunt, wife of one of the break-in

defendants.
Rockefeller Denies 'Cover-Up'
WASHINGTON Bristling at comparisons with
the Watergate scandal, Vice President-designate
Nelson A. Rockefeller denied yesterday that he
tried to cover up his role in publication of a book
critical of a campaign opponent.
Rockefeller blamed his poor memory for his
earlier statement that he had no connection with
the campaign book. But he apologized for his faulty
recollections and accepted full responsibility for the
incident.
As the Senate Rules Committee opened a second
round of hearings on his nomination, Rockefeller
also defended his large gifts and loans to friends and
associates as humanitarian and noncorrupting. He
said his family's immense wealth and influence
should not bar him from being vice president.
As a national radio and television audience
listened, Rockefeller asked the committee:
"Am I the kind of man who would use his wealth
improperly in public office?
"Would my family background somehow limit
and blind me, so that I would not be able to see and
serve the general good of Americans? I think the
answer is no. I would not behave improperly. And I
would not be limited or blinded," he replied.
Morton Resurrects Gas Tax Idea
WASHINGTON Interior Secretary Rogers C.B.
Morton resurrected yesterday the proposal to raise
gasoline taxes to save fuel, an idea killed earlier by
President Ford.
Morton told reporters he thought Ford's
rejection of the idea stemmed from a belief it could
not get through Congress.
But Morton, the President's top energy official,
said he had economists analyzing the idea and
planned to discuss it with key congressmen next
Monday.
Federal Energy Administrator John C. Sawhill
had openly proposed a 10-to-30 cent surtax on
gasoline to discourage consumption. Ironically, his
public advocacy of the idea was widely viewed as
one of the reasons Ford at Morton's instigation
obtained Sawhill's resignation.
Morton acknowledged that Ford had stated there
would be no added gasoline tax under his
administration.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through Friday but with variable high
cloudiness and patchy morning fog. Little
temperature change. Lows tonight in the 40s to low
50s. Highs today and Friday in mid 60s to mid 70s.
Light winds.
Guerrilla: 'Create New Palestine 9
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Guerrilla leader
Yasir Arafat carried his cause to the United Nations
yesterday offering the world a choice of continued
violence or of peace based on the creation of a
Palestinian state on Israeli-occupied land.
In an unprecedented appearance before the
General Assembly, the head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization urged Americans and Jews
everywhere to turn their backs on Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in
Jerusalem that Arafat based his speech on principles
that threaten Israel's existence but that the Israeli
government must not abandon the search for peace.
Arafat said the United Nations, swelled by the
addition in recent years of newly independent Third
World countries, now "more clearly reflects the will
of the international community" than it did when
Israel was created in Palestine.
He said Zionist ideology and Israeli leadership
offer only "perpetual bloodshed, endless war and
continuous servitude."
Shaking his finger at the end of an hour and
45-minute speech to the heavily guarded assembly,
Arafat said:
"I have come bearing an olive branch and a
freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive branch
fall from my hand."
A holster and what appeared to be the butt of a
pistol protruded from Arafat's right hip pocket
when he clasped his hands over his head before and
after he spoke.
One of his bodyguards told a newsman it was a
gun and said: "It's not only real, it's loaded."
More than demonstrators massed opposite
the U.N. complex, which was sealed off from the
public by police lines.
They chanted, "Murderers! Murderers!" and
waved Israeli flags and placards with inscriptions
such as "U.N. Haven for Child Murderers."
A pro-Palestinian group was also demonstrating
in New York City, but the two groups were
separated.

had openly proposed a 10-to-30 cent surtax on
gasoline to discourage consumption. Ironically, his
public advocacy of the idea was widely viewed as
one of the reasons Ford at Morton's instigation
obtained Sawhill's resignation.
Morton acknowledged that Ford had stated there
would be no added gasoline tax under his
administration.

Guerrilla: 'Create New Palestine 9
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Guerrilla leader
Yasir Arafat carried his cause to the United Nations
yesterday offering the world a choice of continued
violence or of peace based on the creation of a
Palestinian state on Israeli-occupied land.
In an unprecedented appearance before the
General Assembly, the head of the Palestine
Liberation Organization urged Americans and Jews
everywhere to turn their backs on Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in
Jerusalem that Arafat based his speech on principles
that threaten Israel's existence but that the Israeli
government must not abandon the search for peace.
Arafat said the United Nations, swelled by the
addition in recent years of newly independent Third
World countries, now "more clearly reflects the will
of the international community" than it did when
Israel was created in Palestine.
He said Zionist ideology and Israeli leadership
offer only "perpetual bloodshed, endless war and
continuous servitude."
Shaking his finger at the end of an hour and
45-minute speech to the heavily guarded assembly,
Arafat said:
"I have come bearing an olive branch and a
freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive branch
fall from my hand."
A holster and what appeared to be the butt of a
pistol protruded from Arafat's right hip pocket
when he clasped his hands over his head before and
after he spoke.
One of his bodyguards told a newsman it was a
gun and said: "It's not only real, it's loaded."
More than demonstrators massed opposite
the U.N. complex, which was sealed off from the
public by police lines.
They chanted, "Murderers! Murderers!" and
waved Israeli flags and placards with inscriptions
such as "U.N. Haven for Child Murderers."
A pro-Palestinian group was also demonstrating
in New York City, but the two groups were
separated.
Coal Strike May End Nov. 25
WASHINGTON President Arnold Miller of the
striking United Mine Workers announced yesterday
that the union had reached tentative agreement with
coal operators on a "very good contract" which he
said could end the nationwide coal strike by Nov.
25.
Emerging from a day-long bargaining session,
Miller said he thought he would have no trouble
selling the proposed agreement to the 120,000
rank-and-file union members, who must vote their
approval before the mines can be reopened.

"The benefit package will allow us to go back
and eradicate some of the gross inequities that have
existed for years," Miller told newsmen.
The total cost of the contract was not disclosed,
but inducations were that it could prove to be the
heftiest major labor settlement this year.
Coal industry sorces estimated the total increase
in pay and benefits for miners would amount to 46
percent during the life of the three-year pact, while
union sources put the over-all increase at closer to
40 percent.
The contract, if approved, would provide wage
increases of nine percent the first year and three
percent in each of the next two years.
The miners would also receive, for the first time,
cost-of-living increases pegged to increases in the
government's consumer price index.
The union chief immediately summoned his
38-member bargaining council from the coal fields
to a meeting here today to consider the tentative
offer.
Judge Picks 3 To Examine Nixon
WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John J.
Sirica appointed a panel of three doctors yesterday
to examine former President Richard M. Nixon and
determine if he is able to testify in the Watergate
cover-up trial.
Sirica signed an order authorizing and directing
the doctors "to conduct such examination as they
deem necessary and appropriate and, thereafter, to
advise the court..." by Nov. 29 of Nixon's status.
Nixon will be discharged from the hospital
today, 23 days after he was admitted for treatment
of phlebitis, a hospital spokesman confirmed last
night.
"Tomorrow is discharge day" for Nixon, said a
spokesman for Memorial Hospital Medical Center of
Long Beach where Nixon has been hospitalized
since Oct. 23.
Judge Sirica signed his order after a day in which
a former New York police detective and a
Mississippi oil man testified at the Watergate
cover-up trial about their role in the attempt to
contain the investigation of the Watergate break-in.
Fred C. La√üue of Jackson, Miss., testified that
two days after the June 17, 1972, break-in former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell suggested that Jeb
Stuart Magruder burn files containing information
from bugs at the Democratic headquarters.
Anthony T. Ulasewicz, a former New York City
police detective, described how he left thousands of
dollars in airport lockers where it was picked up my
Mrs. E. Howard Hunt, wife of one of the break-in

defendants.
Rockefeller Denies 'Cover-Up'
WASHINGTON Bristling at comparisons with
the Watergate scandal, Vice President-designate
Nelson A. Rockefeller denied yesterday that he
tried to cover up his role in publication of a book
critical of a campaign opponent.
Rockefeller blamed his poor memory for his
earlier statement that he had no connection with
the campaign book. But he apologized for his faulty
recollections and accepted full responsibility for the
incident.
As the Senate Rules Committee opened a second
round of hearings on his nomination, Rockefeller
also defended his large gifts and loans to friends and
associates as humanitarian and noncorrupting. He
said his family's immense wealth and influence
should not bar him from being vice president.
As a national radio and television audience
listened, Rockefeller asked the committee:
"Am I the kind of man who would use his wealth
improperly in public office?
"Would my family background somehow limit
and blind me, so that I would not be able to see and
serve the general good of Americans? I think the
answer is no. I would not behave improperly. And I
would not be limited or blinded," he replied.
Morton Resurrects Gas Tax Idea
WASHINGTON Interior Secretary Rogers C.B.
Morton resurrected yesterday the proposal to raise
gasoline taxes to save fuel, an idea killed earlier by
President Ford.
Morton told reporters he thought Ford's
rejection of the idea stemmed from a belief it could
not get through Congress.
But Morton, the President's top energy official,
said he had economists analyzing the idea and
planned to discuss it with key congressmen next
Monday.
Federal Energy Administrator John C. Sawhill
had openly proposed a 10-to-30 cent surtax on
gasoline to discourage consumption. Ironically, his
public advocacy of the idea was widely viewed as
one of the reasons Ford at Morton's instigation
obtained Sawhill's resignation.
Morton acknowledged that Ford had stated there
would be no added gasoline tax under his
administration.
