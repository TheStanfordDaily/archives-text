# HEW To Support Frats On Title IX Exemptions
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON —The Ford
Administration will support efforts by
Congress to amend an
anti-sex-discrimination law which has
produced a flood of criticism from
schools across the country, according
to a government spokesman.
Peter E. Holmes, director of the
U.S. Office for Civil Rights, said
yesterday that the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)
will support an amendment exempting
college fraternities, Sororities and
ether organizations from regulations
proposed by HEW on Title IX of the
Educational Amendments Act of
1972.
Holmes said HEW has no position,
however, on similar requests to
exempt physical education classes and
major revenue-producing sports such
as college football and basketball from

the requirements.
He cautioned newsmen that this
does not mean "the flood gates are
opening" on the controversial Title IX
regulations.
Since HEW proposed rules under
the act last June, more than 9000
comments have poured into
Washington from college presidents,
fraternities, women's organizations,
private citizens, congressmen, coaches
and others.
Because of the sheer volume of
reactions and the complexity of legal
issues raised, Holmes said it was
unlikely that final regulations would
be ready until early next year to take
effect in the fall of 1975.
The final version must be approved
by both the HEW secretary and
President Ford, and rest in Congress
45 days for review, he said.
