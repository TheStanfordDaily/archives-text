# Law Prof Babcock, Five Others Write Congress
## Profs: Probe Rockefeller Loans 
### MARK LICKER 
Assoc. Law Prof. Barbara Babcock
and five other law professors have sent
a letter to members of the
congressional committees investigating
the nomination of Nelson A.
Rockefeller as vice president, asking
them to determine if Rockefeller
violated New York state law by
making loans to public officials.
The letter was written by Prof.
Norhan Dorsen of New York
University and co-signed by Babcock,
Clinton Bamberger of Catholic
University, Paul Bender of the
University of Pennsylvania and
Robert Mnookin and Frank Newman
of UC-Berkeley.
The professors sent it to Sen.
Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.),
chairman of the Senate Rules
Committee and to Rep. Peter W.
Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.), chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee.

It was also sent to three other
Judiciary Committee members: Rev.
Robert F. Drinan (D-Mass.), Elizabeth
Holtzman (D-N.Y.) and Paul Sarbanes
(D-Md.).
Text Of Statute
The letter cites Statute 200.35 of
the New York Penal Code, which
states:
"A person is guilty of giving
unlawful gratuities when he knowingly
confers, or offers or agrees to confer,
any benefit upon a public servant for
having engaged in official conduct
which he would be required or
authorized to perform, and for which
he was not entitled to any special or
additional compensation." The
misdemeanor is punishable by up to
one year in jail or a $lOOO fine.
The professors are specifically
concerned with loans Rockefeller
made after the law became effective
on Sept. 1, 1967.
• $2 Million In Gifts
On Oct. 11, 1974, Rockefeller
made public a list of about $2 million
in gifts, largely forgiven loans, which
he made between 1957 and 1974 to
part-time public officials and members
of his gubernatorial staff in New York.
Rockefeller noted that he forgave
the loans when the recipients were no
longer in public office. On Oct. 28, an
additional $507,656 in partially repaid
loans was disclosed, including one to
Robert B. Anderson, secretary of the
treasury under President Eisenhower.
Rockefeller then said he had not made
the loans to individuals while they
were in public service.
Noting that the New York statute
defines "benefit" as "any gain or
advantage," the professors wrote that
a loan made at an unusually low
interest rate, without security, or
without the expectation of repayment
"is a benefit."
Ask For Specifics
They asked the congressional
committees to determine the dates on
which loans were made, the rates of
interest and security involved and the

credit ratings of recipients.
They also suggested asking
Rockefeller if "there was any
understanding or expectation that the
loans would be forgiven at a later
time," and if, when the loans were
forgiven, there had been "an
understanding or expectation that the
donee would soon resume public
service.
"A long opinion on circumstances
under which the loans would be illegal
accompanied the letter. The professors
added, "We do not know all the facts
bearing on these loans and their
forgiveness but enough evidence has
been made public to raise substantial
legal questions in our minds."

The professors sent it to Sen.
Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.),
chairman of the Senate Rules
Committee and to Rep. Peter W.
Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.), chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee.

It was also sent to three other
Judiciary Committee members: Rev.
Robert F. Drinan (D-Mass.), Elizabeth
Holtzman (D-N.Y.) and Paul Sarbanes
(D-Md.).
Text Of Statute
The letter cites Statute 200.35 of
the New York Penal Code, which
states:
"A person is guilty of giving
unlawful gratuities when he knowingly
confers, or offers or agrees to confer,
any benefit upon a public servant for
having engaged in official conduct
which he would be required or
authorized to perform, and for which
he was not entitled to any special or
additional compensation." The
misdemeanor is punishable by up to
one year in jail or a $lOOO fine.
The professors are specifically
concerned with loans Rockefeller
made after the law became effective
on Sept. 1, 1967.
• $2 Million In Gifts
On Oct. 11, 1974, Rockefeller
made public a list of about $2 million
in gifts, largely forgiven loans, which
he made between 1957 and 1974 to
part-time public officials and members
of his gubernatorial staff in New York.
Rockefeller noted that he forgave
the loans when the recipients were no
longer in public office. On Oct. 28, an
additional $507,656 in partially repaid
loans was disclosed, including one to
Robert B. Anderson, secretary of the
treasury under President Eisenhower.
Rockefeller then said he had not made
the loans to individuals while they
were in public service.
Noting that the New York statute
defines "benefit" as "any gain or
advantage," the professors wrote that
a loan made at an unusually low
interest rate, without security, or
without the expectation of repayment
"is a benefit."
Ask For Specifics
They asked the congressional
committees to determine the dates on
which loans were made, the rates of
interest and security involved and the

credit ratings of recipients.
They also suggested asking
Rockefeller if "there was any
understanding or expectation that the
loans would be forgiven at a later
time," and if, when the loans were
forgiven, there had been "an
understanding or expectation that the
donee would soon resume public
service.
"A long opinion on circumstances
under which the loans would be illegal
accompanied the letter. The professors
added, "We do not know all the facts
bearing on these loans and their
forgiveness but enough evidence has
been made public to raise substantial
legal questions in our minds."
