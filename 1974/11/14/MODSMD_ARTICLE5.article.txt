# University Considers Methods Of Implementing File Access
## 
### DON COX 
University administrators will meet
today to consider how to cope with a
new federal law which goes into effect
next Tuesday and will apparently give
students access to confidential
information in files about them.
While Legal Advisor to the
President James V. Siena said he
"didn't want to predict what we're
going to do," he said removal of the
material from the files is a
"possibility."
Harvard officials are currently
combing students' files removing
confidential documents, a process
which involves most of the
University's 16,000 students.
Harvard's general counsel, David

Steiner, said Harvard has a "moral
obligation" to protect the confidential
information and that the university's
action violates neither the letter or the
spirit of the law, authored by Sen.
James L. Buckley (Con.-N.Y.).
Siena said "what they're doing is
entirely appropriate and that Stanford
was "going to do everything it can to
protect its documents solicited under a
pledge of confidentiality, whether the
pledge is explicit or implied."
He said Stanford has not taken
action on the issue to date because
"we were holding off, hoping to get a
clear signal from Washington" that the
legislation would be amended
favorably to the University.
Buckley has said that when
Congress returns from its election
recess next week, he will introduce an
amendment to the bill which would
provide that all records compiled prior
to Sept. 20 would remain confidential.
Siena noted that the University
actually has until Jan. 1, 1975 to
establish a policy, because there is a 45
day wait period specified in the law
between the time a request to see a file
is made and the response. Siena
expressed hope that the issue could be
cleared up by Congress before then.
"We're working with educational
associations that have been lobbying
rigorously and continuously to get this
thing at least made non-retroactive and
hopefully postponed until hearings can
take place," he said.
Confidentiality
"The consequences are something
we will have to face up to if the law is
not changed," he added. Nevertheless,
the University will protect the
confidentiality of the documents, he
said.

"If it appears to us that certain
interpretations of the law make this a
risky procedure, we will modify our
procedures," Siena said.
These modifications could include
taking the confidential material out of
the files and putting it it "cold
storage." Siena said that "a fair
reading of the law" would support the
University's position since they did
not distribute or use any of the
confidential information in admissions
files. The law applies only to active
files, he maintained.
"The reason we keep this stuff is
that we may need some day to justify
an admissions decision" in a legal suit.
"That's the real impediment" to
destroying the files, he said.
Destroy Material
The Harvard Crimson reported that
confidential material in Harvard
graduate student files would be
destroyed if the authors of
confidential material could not be
found to approve release of the
material. Material in confidential files
of undergraduates was simply being
removed and stored elsewhere.
The Crimson reported that there
was some controversy concerning the
issue, because many felt the policy did
not comply with the spirit of the law.
The two places most directly
affected by the law are the Admissions
and Placement Center offices. Siena
will meet with Acting President
William Miller, Admissions Office
officials, Graduate Division Dean
Lincoln Moses to study the problem.
The law will give students access to
letters of recommendation and other
confidential material in admissions,
financial aid, student employment,
academic and medical files.

The two places most directly
affected by the law are the Admissions
and Placement Center offices. Siena
will meet with Acting President
William Miller, Admissions Office
officials, Graduate Division Dean
Lincoln Moses to study the problem.
The law will give students access to
letters of recommendation and other
confidential material in admissions,
financial aid, student employment,
academic and medical files.
University administrators will meet
today to consider how to cope with a
new federal law which goes into effect
next Tuesday and will apparently give
students access to confidential
information in files about them.
While Legal Advisor to the
President James V. Siena said he
"didn't want to predict what we're
going to do," he said removal of the
material from the files is a
"possibility."
Harvard officials are currently
combing students' files removing
confidential documents, a process
which involves most of the
University's 16,000 students.
Harvard's general counsel, David

Steiner, said Harvard has a "moral
obligation" to protect the confidential
information and that the university's
action violates neither the letter or the
spirit of the law, authored by Sen.
James L. Buckley (Con.-N.Y.).
Siena said "what they're doing is
entirely appropriate and that Stanford
was "going to do everything it can to
protect its documents solicited under a
pledge of confidentiality, whether the
pledge is explicit or implied."
He said Stanford has not taken
action on the issue to date because
"we were holding off, hoping to get a
clear signal from Washington" that the
legislation would be amended
favorably to the University.
Buckley has said that when
Congress returns from its election
recess next week, he will introduce an
amendment to the bill which would
provide that all records compiled prior
to Sept. 20 would remain confidential.
Siena noted that the University
actually has until Jan. 1, 1975 to
establish a policy, because there is a 45
day wait period specified in the law
between the time a request to see a file
is made and the response. Siena
expressed hope that the issue could be
cleared up by Congress before then.
"We're working with educational
associations that have been lobbying
rigorously and continuously to get this
thing at least made non-retroactive and
hopefully postponed until hearings can
take place," he said.
Confidentiality
"The consequences are something
we will have to face up to if the law is
not changed," he added. Nevertheless,
the University will protect the
confidentiality of the documents, he
said.

"If it appears to us that certain
interpretations of the law make this a
risky procedure, we will modify our
procedures," Siena said.
These modifications could include
taking the confidential material out of
the files and putting it it "cold
storage." Siena said that "a fair
reading of the law" would support the
University's position since they did
not distribute or use any of the
confidential information in admissions
files. The law applies only to active
files, he maintained.
"The reason we keep this stuff is
that we may need some day to justify
an admissions decision" in a legal suit.
"That's the real impediment" to
destroying the files, he said.
Destroy Material
The Harvard Crimson reported that
confidential material in Harvard
graduate student files would be
destroyed if the authors of
confidential material could not be
found to approve release of the
material. Material in confidential files
of undergraduates was simply being
removed and stored elsewhere.
The Crimson reported that there
was some controversy concerning the
issue, because many felt the policy did
not comply with the spirit of the law.
