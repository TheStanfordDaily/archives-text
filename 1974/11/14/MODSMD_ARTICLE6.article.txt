# Dean Moses: No Ph.D. Surplus
## 
### VALERIE KRIZ 
Some academic fields have an
overabundance of Ph.D.'s, but there is
no overall surplus of doctorates,
according to a preliminary report on
graduate education and research
prepared by the Policy Committee of
the Association of Graduate Schools
(AGS).
Lincoln Moses, graduate division
dean here and AGS president,
presented a summary of the report to
an Association of American
Universities (AAU) meeting last month
in Washington, D.C.
The committee said that the
"informed free choice of individuals
should be the central guide to
decisions" concerning the pursuit of
advanced study, but that "careful
attention should be paid to forecasts
of supply and demand" for doctorates
in a chosen field.
"Students who decide that they do
wish to receive a doctorate to prepare
for research and teaching should be
aware that competition for these jobs
in academic departments will be
fierce," the report said.
According to Moses, the glut of
Ph.D.'s "tends to be in the

humanities," but is not limited to that
area. He stated in the summary that, in
fields such as engineering, interactions
"with industry and other nonacademic
employers" enable departments to
gear their programs to meet projected
problems and needs.
"Analogues of these programs are
not easily found for the humanities,"
Moses said. "Each discipline and
ultimately each department should
address the question of whether there
is a non-academic market for Ph.D.
students trained, in whatever novel
ways, in that field."
However, he added that "the
number of students admitted to
graduate school should not be fixed by
quotas based on a national manpower
plan."
Stressing the need for better
informed choices, the report urged
departments to supply prospective
students with information on current
success in job placement and future
career prospects for those who
advanced training in that field. Efforts
should also be made to improve
forecasting techniques, the report
added.
Moses projected that when the

committee's final report is completed,
the AGS will "choose one or two
problem areas in graduate education"
and set up a study of those problems.
The AGS is part of the AAU which
comprises about 50 major research
universities in the country.
