ASSU Special Events
Editor:
I was encouraged by the article
Which appeared in the Nov. 1
Daily concerning the progress
made by the ASSU Council of
Presidents in fulfilling their
campaign pledges. The analysis
proved unusually accurate and, I
trust, will convey to the
University community our
attempt to serve the student body
seriously and conscientiously.
There is one inaccuracy which
I feel should be corrected in the
spirit of giving credit where credit
is due. The article implies that the
successful showing of the ASSU
Special Events Program is
primarily the doing of the present
Council.
In fact, although the Special
Events performances have been
far more successful this year than
in recent years, the acclaim should
not be directed toward the
Council of Presidents nearly as
much as it should go to Danny
Scher, the impresario of Stanford
concerts. His shrewd planning and
brilliant producing of concerts
thus far has led to a string of
successes, including the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band,
Loggins and Messina, Seals and
Crofts, Joan Baez and Doc and
Merle Watson.
Inasmuch as the ASSU Special
Events Program has been beset, in
recent years, by financial and
programming disasters, the revival
4of the program is indeed one of
which many are appreciative. That
appreciation and all
accompanying accolades should
be directed toward Scher.

Against 'Live Oak' Fee
Editor:
Several people in the last few
days have asked my position on
Live Oak's proposed fee
assessment. I'm against it. And
here's why.
In its public statements about
the assessment thus far which
have, interestingly enough, not
appeared in Live Oak the paper
has stated that it "can operate
indefinitely with the ad revenue it
has now." On the other hand,
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri says that according to his
figures, Live Oak is just about
-r breaking even.
If the paper is doing as well as
editor Bill Weinstein says, I see no
reason whatsoever for giving it a
fee assessment. Live Oak has said
it wants the money to expand, so
according to it, the question is not
one of the paper's continued
survival. This, then, raises the
question: after only six weeks of
publication, are students willing
to give the paper $12,000,
basically, just a subsidy that
would amount to over 50 percent
of its annual budget (according to
figures it filed last year with the
Pub Board)? This money would
not go to a publication with a
proven track record and
established product; it would be a
subsidy for a largely unproven
product.
On the other hand, if Live Oak,
despite its claims to the contrary,
really needs the money, then it
has not played square with the
students. Other publications have
been frank about their financial
situations. The Daily, for
example, reported as long ago as
Dec. 6, 1973 that it might have to

go back to students for a fee
assessment this year. On Feb. 1,
1974, then-editor Jim Wascher
repeated that statement. (That
decision, which will eventually be
made by the Stanford Daily
Publishing Corporation's Board of
Directors, is still up in the air.)
Similarly, the Stanford Quad was
frank about its financial situation
when it struggled back to life last
year, and Mason Blacher, in his
apparently ill-fated attempt to
assume control of the Chaparral,.
was also quite open about the
sources of his funding.
Thus, my feeling is that if Live
Oak is telling the truth about its
situation, it doesn't need its fee
assessment. And if it isn't telling
the truth, it doesn't deserve the
assessment.

SURP Not Dead
Editor:
In response to Daily articles of
Nov. 8, we in the Stanford
Teaching and Research Employees
Union (STREU) do not consider
the "actions initiated" by our
friends in the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists (SURP) either
to be "maverick" or to be ended.
On the first point, consider
living on an average take home
pay of $262.32 a month the
same level of wages that Stanford
has paid TAs since January, 1969.
SURP's position is not
"maverick" or irrational,
considering the anger that has
been building up among graduate
students over the failure of the
administration to increase stipend
support and TA salaries to a level
adequate to even basic living
costs. Our approximately 400
members must eat and pay rent.
Thus we will continue to press
for a decent wage and fair hiring
despite the NLRB decision.
Secondly, official NLRB
recognition should not be equated
with functional recognition by the
employer. A union is recognized
when its members exert the
influence necessary to win their
demands.

ASSU Misrepresentation
Editor:
It is very unfortunate when a
student organization must resort
to misrepresentation in order to
"sell" students. I am referring to
the ad in the Daily Nov. 12 for
the ASSU Travel Service
comparing its package price for a
trip to New York via its Chicago
Charter with the ' standard" fare.
According to the ad a student
using the Charter could save $llO
on a round trip. However, the
' commercial" fare listed is for the
day coach rate. There is another
"commercial fare" the night
coach rate, which is about $BO to
$9O cheaper for a round trip. This
lowers the savings to about $2O to
$3O on the round trip via charter.
While there is still a savings here,
it is not as glamorous as the ad
would have you think (or as the
normal charter offers).
It would seem appropriate for
the ASSU to at least review its
policies in this respect (Will this
also be the policy for the
proposed record co-op?), or
perhaps to issue some sort of
correction in this particular case.

Against 'Live Oak' Fee
Editor:
Several people in the last few
days have asked my position on
Live Oak's proposed fee
assessment. I'm against it. And
here's why.
In its public statements about
the assessment thus far which
have, interestingly enough, not
appeared in Live Oak the paper
has stated that it "can operate
indefinitely with the ad revenue it
has now." On the other hand,
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri says that according to his
figures, Live Oak is just about
-r breaking even.
If the paper is doing as well as
editor Bill Weinstein says, I see no
reason whatsoever for giving it a
fee assessment. Live Oak has said
it wants the money to expand, so
according to it, the question is not
one of the paper's continued
survival. This, then, raises the
question: after only six weeks of
publication, are students willing
to give the paper $12,000,
basically, just a subsidy that
would amount to over 50 percent
of its annual budget (according to
figures it filed last year with the
Pub Board)? This money would
not go to a publication with a
proven track record and
established product; it would be a
subsidy for a largely unproven
product.
On the other hand, if Live Oak,
despite its claims to the contrary,
really needs the money, then it
has not played square with the
students. Other publications have
been frank about their financial
situations. The Daily, for
example, reported as long ago as
Dec. 6, 1973 that it might have to

go back to students for a fee
assessment this year. On Feb. 1,
1974, then-editor Jim Wascher
repeated that statement. (That
decision, which will eventually be
made by the Stanford Daily
Publishing Corporation's Board of
Directors, is still up in the air.)
Similarly, the Stanford Quad was
frank about its financial situation
when it struggled back to life last
year, and Mason Blacher, in his
apparently ill-fated attempt to
assume control of the Chaparral,.
was also quite open about the
sources of his funding.
Thus, my feeling is that if Live
Oak is telling the truth about its
situation, it doesn't need its fee
assessment. And if it isn't telling
the truth, it doesn't deserve the
assessment.

SURP Not Dead
Editor:
In response to Daily articles of
Nov. 8, we in the Stanford
Teaching and Research Employees
Union (STREU) do not consider
the "actions initiated" by our
friends in the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists (SURP) either
to be "maverick" or to be ended.
On the first point, consider
living on an average take home
pay of $262.32 a month the
same level of wages that Stanford
has paid TAs since January, 1969.
SURP's position is not
"maverick" or irrational,
considering the anger that has
been building up among graduate
students over the failure of the
administration to increase stipend
support and TA salaries to a level
adequate to even basic living
costs. Our approximately 400
members must eat and pay rent.
Thus we will continue to press
for a decent wage and fair hiring
despite the NLRB decision.
Secondly, official NLRB
recognition should not be equated
with functional recognition by the
employer. A union is recognized
when its members exert the
influence necessary to win their

ASSU Misrepresentation
Editor:
It is very unfortunate when a
student organization must resort
to misrepresentation in order to
"sell" students. I am referring to
the ad in the Daily Nov. 12 for
the ASSU Travel Service
comparing its package price for a
trip to New York via its Chicago
Charter with the ' standard" fare.
According to the ad a student
using the Charter could save $llO
on a round trip. However, the
' commercial" fare listed is for the
day coach rate. There is another
"commercial fare" the night
coach rate, which is about $BO to
$9O cheaper for a round trip. This
lowers the savings to about $2O to
$3O on the round trip via charter.
While there is still a savings here,
it is not as glamorous as the ad
would have you think (or as the
normal charter offers).
It would seem appropriate for
the ASSU to at least review its
policies in this respect (Will this
also be the policy for the
proposed record co-op?), or
perhaps to issue some sort of
correction in this particular case.

has now." On the other hand,
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri says that according to his
figures, Live Oak is just about
-r breaking even.
If the paper is doing as well as
editor Bill Weinstein says, I see no
reason whatsoever for giving it a
fee assessment. Live Oak has said
it wants the money to expand, so
according to it, the question is not
one of the paper's continued
survival. This, then, raises the
question: after only six weeks of
publication, are students willing
to give the paper $12,000,
basically, just a subsidy that
would amount to over 50 percent
of its annual budget (according to
figures it filed last year with the
Pub Board)? This money would
not go to a publication with a
proven track record and
established product; it would be a
subsidy for a largely unproven
product.
On the other hand, if Live Oak,
despite its claims to the contrary,
really needs the money, then it
has not played square with the
students. Other publications have
been frank about their financial
situations. The Daily, for
example, reported as long ago as
Dec. 6, 1973 that it might have to

go back to students for a fee
assessment this year. On Feb. 1,
1974, then-editor Jim Wascher
repeated that statement. (That
decision, which will eventually be
made by the Stanford Daily
Publishing Corporation's Board of
Directors, is still up in the air.)
Similarly, the Stanford Quad was
frank about its financial situation
when it struggled back to life last
year, and Mason Blacher, in his
apparently ill-fated attempt to
assume control of the Chaparral,.
was also quite open about the
sources of his funding.
Thus, my feeling is that if Live
Oak is telling the truth about its
situation, it doesn't need its fee
assessment. And if it isn't telling
the truth, it doesn't deserve the
assessment.

SURP Not Dead
Editor:
In response to Daily articles of
Nov. 8, we in the Stanford
Teaching and Research Employees
Union (STREU) do not consider
the "actions initiated" by our
friends in the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists (SURP) either
to be "maverick" or to be ended.
On the first point, consider
living on an average take home
pay of $262.32 a month the
same level of wages that Stanford
has paid TAs since January, 1969.
SURP's position is not
"maverick" or irrational,
considering the anger that has
been building up among graduate
students over the failure of the
administration to increase stipend
support and TA salaries to a level
adequate to even basic living
costs. Our approximately 400
members must eat and pay rent.
Thus we will continue to press
for a decent wage and fair hiring
despite the NLRB decision.
Secondly, official NLRB
recognition should not be equated
with functional recognition by the
employer. A union is recognized
when its members exert the
influence necessary to win their
demands.

ASSU Misrepresentation
Editor:
It is very unfortunate when a
student organization must resort
to misrepresentation in order to
"sell" students. I am referring to
the ad in the Daily Nov. 12 for
the ASSU Travel Service
comparing its package price for a
trip to New York via its Chicago
Charter with the ' standard" fare.
According to the ad a student
using the Charter could save $llO
on a round trip. However, the
' commercial" fare listed is for the
day coach rate. There is another
"commercial fare" the night
coach rate, which is about $BO to
$9O cheaper for a round trip. This
lowers the savings to about $2O to
$3O on the round trip via charter.
While there is still a savings here,
it is not as glamorous as the ad
would have you think (or as the
normal charter offers).
It would seem appropriate for
the ASSU to at least review its
policies in this respect (Will this
also be the policy for the
proposed record co-op?), or
perhaps to issue some sort of
correction in this particular case.

ASSU Special Events
Editor:
I was encouraged by the article
Which appeared in the Nov. 1
Daily concerning the progress
made by the ASSU Council of
Presidents in fulfilling their
campaign pledges. The analysis
proved unusually accurate and, I
trust, will convey to the
University community our
attempt to serve the student body
seriously and conscientiously.
There is one inaccuracy which
I feel should be corrected in the
spirit of giving credit where credit
is due. The article implies that the
successful showing of the ASSU
Special Events Program is
primarily the doing of the present
Council.
In fact, although the Special
Events performances have been
far more successful this year than
in recent years, the acclaim should
not be directed toward the
Council of Presidents nearly as
much as it should go to Danny
Scher, the impresario of Stanford
concerts. His shrewd planning and
brilliant producing of concerts
thus far has led to a string of
successes, including the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band,
Loggins and Messina, Seals and
Crofts, Joan Baez and Doc and
Merle Watson.
Inasmuch as the ASSU Special
Events Program has been beset, in
recent years, by financial and
programming disasters, the revival
4of the program is indeed one of
which many are appreciative. That
appreciation and all
accompanying accolades should
be directed toward Scher.
