"'AMARCORD' MAY POSSIBLY BE FEDERICO
FELLINI'S MOST MARVELOUS FILM...
extravagantly funny. It is as full of tales as
Scheherazade, some romantic, some
slapstick, some elegiacal, some bawdy,
some as mysterious as the unexpected
sight of a peacock flying through a light
snowfall. It's a film of exhilarating beauty."
■ —Vincent Canby, The New York Times
"'AMARCORD' IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
MOVIE FELLINI HAS EVER MADE and a
landmark in the history of film. It is a
sprawling, hilarious, touching, evocation
of life."
—Paul D. Zimmerman, Newsweek
