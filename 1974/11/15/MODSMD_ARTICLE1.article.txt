# Title IX Amendment: Effect On Frats Unclear
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
It is unclear how an amendment
exempting sororities and fraternities
from Title IX regulations would affect
the fraternities here, University
lawyers said yesterday.
The Associated Press reported
Wednesday that the Ford
Administration and the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)
will support efforts by Congress to
amend the controversial Title IX of
the Educational Amendments Act of
1972.
"I have no idea what effect the
amendment would have on the
Stanford fraternities," said Iris Brest,
associate staff legal counsel for the
General Secretary's Office.
Presidential Legal Adviser James
Siena echoed her words; "I don't
know what that means," he said,
referring to the proposed amendment.
Both Brest and Siena have
accompanied Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton on his visits to
dormitories and fraternities where he
discussed the present housing system
dilemma.
Horton says the existing housing
system must be changed because it
discriminates against women. No
women share in the draw-exempt
status granted to fraternity members.
Even Bernard Feiner, San Francisco
regional lawyer for HEW, could not
say what effect the amendment would
have on the Univeristy's fraternities.
He explained the amendment could
cover all of Title IX or just a particular
regulation. He said he could not tell
how the fraternities would be affected
until the amendment was formally
worded.
Horton was out of town and could
not be reached for comment.
Inter-Fraternity Council President
Mike Nilsson, Brest and Siena all
agreed that Horton would probabiy
not be influenced by any Title IX
revision.
"As Larry continually says, the
housing shortage is the question, not
Title IX," Nilsson remarked.
However, Horton has used Title IX
as an argument against reviving

sororities on campus. He has said a
proposed Title IX regulation prevents
a university from receiving federal
funds if it assists an organization
which discriminates on the basis of
sex.
Siena admitted the amendment
would destroy this argument.
"It may well be that an amendment
to the legislation will not change our
direction at all," Siena said. Horton is
presently leaning towards a proposal
which would assimilate fraternities
into the draw.
Siena said the amendment would
not necessarily apply to Stanford
because fraternities here are
incorporated into the University's
housing system.
Among the catalysts for the
amendment was a response of over
9000 letters to HEW regarding the
proposed regulations. One letter came
from President Richard Lyman, who
asked HEW not to adopt a provision
which would essentially kill the
fraternity system here.
