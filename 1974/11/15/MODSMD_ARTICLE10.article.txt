# Views On Rockefeller Hearings

Daily Kansan
There is a better than even chance that
President Gerald R. Ford will withdraw the
nomination of Nelson Rockefeller to become
vice president.
Several criticisms of Rockefeller have been
voiced.
But all of these doubts are really only one
suspicion about Rockefeller. In this
post-Watergate atmosphere, politicians are
suspicious of anyone with enough money to
influence someone else.
For years, Americans have complained
that only a millionaire could become a
president, senator or governor. Now it
appears that even the millionaires are going
to have trouble attaining political office
Political scientists know that the federal
government has had trouble attracting
capable administrators to the higher positions
of government service. One reason is that the
pay is low compared to the pay of similar
jobs in private business.
'lndependently Wealthy'
Rockefeller has been able to give his time
to public service because he is independently
wealthy. During his distinguished public
career, he was governor of New York for 14
years, assistant secretary of state, under
secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, a
member of many presidential commissions
and an adviser to three presidents.
The Rockefeller family has neither
jealously guarded its fortune nor squandered
it. The Rockefeller Foundation has
generously given millions of dollars to the
study of national and international social
problems.

Rockefeller's personal life and finance
have undergone some of the most intense
scrutiny in American political history. He has
come out of it remarkably unscathed,
considering the complexity of his affairs and
his many enemies in the right wing of the
Republican party.
The Bible says that it shall be easier for a
camel to pass through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter the gates of
heaven. Let's not make it quite so hard for a
rich man to become vice president.
Congress should confirm Nelson
Rockefeller as vice president before he
decides the job isn't worth all the trouble. If
he isn't confirmed, we may end up with
another mediocre compromise vice president
like Spiro Agnew. And they are a dime a
dozen.
Washington Daily
What this country really needs right now
is a nice reactionary vice president. One like,
say, Nelson Rockefeller.
The first time I began to think about
Rockefeller as anything more than a rich,
big-business conservative was during the
Attica Prison violence, a little over two years
ago. I remember being appalled when he
explained the necessity of the slaughter by
saying any compromise "would have
undermined the fair and impartial application
of the law."
Take, as another example, the anti-drug
law he pushed through in New York just
before he stepped down from the
governorship. In trying to enact the nation's
toughest anti-drug law, Rockefeller overdid it

by such a long shot, in fact, that drug
related crimes in New York have gone up six
percent in the last year.
The New York law makes live sentences
mandatory for the illegal sale or possession of
heroin, methadone, cocaine, amphetamines
or LSD and other hallucionogens. It also
requires minimum jail terms before lifetime
parole is possible 15 years for the sale of
one ounce of narcotics; six years for an
eighth of an ounce, and one year for any
amount at all.
15 Years For Pot
The penalty for marijuana isn't half bad
only 15 years for possession of one ounce.
But first year offenders get off on probation.
What that means is that anybody who gets
caught twice gets to take a long look at four
prison walls.
Rockefeller is often described as a
"private" public figure. In other words, he
avoids the press like crazy. He managed to
call a news conference two days after Attica
and then it was only after threats by
reporters.
Unlike the Spiro Agnew we all know and
love, Rockefeller hasn't started taking pot
shots at the press yet. At least, not until after
his confirmation.
Just what this country needs is another
"law and order" vice president. After all,
look what he did for his state.
(Both of these columns were written before
the re-opening of Rockefeller's confirmation
hearings. The Daily Kansan article was
written by Richard Paxson; the one from the
Washington Daily is by Wendy Walker.)
