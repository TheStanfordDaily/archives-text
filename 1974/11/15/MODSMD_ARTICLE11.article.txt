# Making Ford Into A Featherbrain
## 
### Milt Miller 
President Ford has a secret
plan to end inflation. The
economic program which he
outlined last month was a
subterfuge designed to lull public
enemy number one into a false
sense of security.
"Our game plan now," a top
administration economist told me
in an interview last week, "is to
create an atmosphere of total
disillusionment and loss of
confidence in the President. We
want the enemy to think its
dealing with a guy who hasn't
recovered from the days he used
to play football without a helmet.
"To acheieve this end, we've
gotten together in the White
House the biggest group of misfits
and intellectual lightweights ever
assembled in one place to advise
the President and to run the
administration. As soon as we
sense the enemy has put down its
guard, we strike."
"How exactly have you been
going about portraying Ford as a
featherbrain?" I asked.
"Oh, it hasn't been too hard,"
he said. "Take that economic
address before the Congress, for
example. Ford had a tough time
keeping a straight face during that
one especially the part where he
recommended shutting
refrigerator doors faster to help
whip inflation.
'Those WIN Buttons'
"And those WIN buttons! The
idea of the President of the
United States and Leader of the
Free World making a speech
before the world with some dumb
red button on his lapel with a
slogan that sounds like it came
from a chewing gum wrapper.
Yeah we promoted the clown
who came up with that idea."
"Have you been confining
Ford's stupidity to economics?" I
asked.
"Oh, hell no. Take the Nixon
pardon. We were sitting in the

Oval Office with the President one
day, trying to think of some new
ways to make him look bad, when
Haig said that the best way to
bring Ford down in the polls
really fast, and to insure a
slaughter of Republicans in
November, was to pardon Nixon.
The important thing was to do it
right after the resignation so it
would look like some sort of deal
had been made. It was Zeigler's
idea, of course, to have Ford say a
week before the pardon that he
wasn't considering one.
'Word Got Out'
"And we made sure that right
after the pardon word got out
that Ford was considering
pardoning the whole group of
Watergate conspirators. We were
going to have him say that he
might open up the doors of every
federal prison in the country, but
we were worried about his

credibility."
"Has the rest of the Cabinet
been informed of the decision to
do everything possible to discredit
the President?"
"We didn't need to. With a
bunch like that, Nixon holdovers
and so forth, chosen for precisely
that quality, you can sort of
count on them doing it anyway."

"Oh we've got some great
things still in store don't worry
on that account. We're going to
send up a trial balloon sometime
next week to the effect that the
President is considering asking
Congress to amend the
Constitution so as to abolish the
whole idea of holding Presidential
elections. After all, as Ford
himself said in a speech a while
back, how else can you get a
President beholden to no special
interests if he's chosen by anyone

other than the. outgoing
President?"
"Was that before or after the
pardon?" I asked
"Before, of course we made
sure of that. We're going to try to
convince the electorate that the
only way to avoid future
Watergates and to make sure we
always get presidents like Gerald
Ford is to wind down the entire
democratic process. The next
step, of course, would be the
formation of a nationwide
"Committee to Re-Appoint the
President." Why, Jerry could
even make another of his dazzling
appearances before the Congress
to broach the idea. And this time
on his lapel he can wear a red
CRAP button."

President Ford has a secret
plan to end inflation. The
economic program which he
outlined last month was a
subterfuge designed to lull public
enemy number one into a false
sense of security.
"Our game plan now," a top
administration economist told me
in an interview last week, "is to
create an atmosphere of total
disillusionment and loss of
confidence in the President. We
want the enemy to think its
dealing with a guy who hasn't
recovered from the days he used
to play football without a helmet.
"To acheieve this end, we've
gotten together in the White
House the biggest group of misfits
and intellectual lightweights ever
assembled in one place to advise
the President and to run the
administration. As soon as we
sense the enemy has put down its
guard, we strike."
"How exactly have you been
going about portraying Ford as a
featherbrain?" I asked.
"Oh, it hasn't been too hard,"
he said. "Take that economic
address before the Congress, for
example. Ford had a tough time
keeping a straight face during that
one especially the part where he
recommended shutting
refrigerator doors faster to help
whip inflation.
'Those WIN Buttons'
"And those WIN buttons! The
idea of the President of the
United States and Leader of the
Free World making a speech
before the world with some dumb
red button on his lapel with a
slogan that sounds like it came
from a chewing gum wrapper.
Yeah we promoted the clown
who came up with that idea."
"Have you been confining
Ford's stupidity to economics?" I
asked.
"Oh, hell no. Take the Nixon
pardon. We were sitting in the

Oval Office with the President one
day, trying to think of some new
ways to make him look bad, when
Haig said that the best way to
bring Ford down in the polls
really fast, and to insure a
slaughter of Republicans in
November, was to pardon Nixon.
The important thing was to do it
right after the resignation so it
would look like some sort of deal
had been made. It was Zeigler's
idea, of course, to have Ford say a
week before the pardon that he
wasn't considering one.
'Word Got Out'
"And we made sure that right
after the pardon word got out
that Ford was considering
pardoning the whole group of
Watergate conspirators. We were
going to have him say that he
might open up the doors of every
federal prison in the country, but
we were worried about his

credibility."
"Has the rest of the Cabinet
been informed of the decision to
do everything possible to discredit
the President?"
"We didn't need to. With a
bunch like that, Nixon holdovers
and so forth, chosen for precisely
that quality, you can sort of
count on them doing it anyway."

"Oh we've got some great
things still in store don't worry
on that account. We're going to

next week to the effect that the
President is considering asking
Congress to amend the

whole idea of holding Presidential
