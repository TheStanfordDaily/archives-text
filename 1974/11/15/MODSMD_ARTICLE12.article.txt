# Don't Pelt Incomparables

### Buzz Thompson 
I speak for myself and most of the LSJUMB
when I offer my congratulations to the Stanford
student section in general and the Theta Delt water
balloon squad in particular for a fine demonstration
of Stanford hypocrisy at the USC game. For a
school that purports to have more class than the
"University of Second Choice," we certainly put on
a fine show to prove the opposite.
In Monday's Daily Tim Ferguson wrote that
launching water balloons is comparable to throwing
a rock at a barn. In terms of the intelligence
required, I agree. But firing a water balloon from a
three-man sling made out of surgical tubing can do
far more damage. I can imagine the orgasmic feeling
of power that comes from shooting at someone
who has his back turned. Wouldn't it be even better
if you hit the person and made him knock out his
teeth on his mouthpiece?
Unless someone puts an end to it, that's
probably what will happen. It would be convenient
to lay the blame for this kind of behavior on a few
frat "men." But it just won't stick when the rest of

the fans are madly cheering them on.
Since the Athletic Department refuses to send
the security guards into the stands, the only
possible way to stop this bullshit is for the students
who have their heads on straight to stand up and let
it be know that they are grossed out and don't
want that kind of thing going on.
Anyone can see that there's something wrong
when the Band is standing on the field flipping off
our own stands. After I screamed at the crowd,
people told me to mellow out.
You aren't the ones who will have to go down to
the Coliseum next fall and get shelled in retaliation
by the USC Fans. Any bandsperson will tell you
that no band, be it the SC Rubber Band, the Cal
Weenies or the LSJUMB, should have to take that
kind of treatment from the stands. I hope that
Stanford students will get their heads unwedged for
Cal and the future.
