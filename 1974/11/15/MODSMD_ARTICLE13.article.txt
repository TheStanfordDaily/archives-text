# Housing Insanity
## 
### Philip lan Klein 
Undergraduate education is
supposedly a primary function of
the University.
Yet the current housing
shortage threatens to undermine
the entire workings of the
educational system here. It is
much more than merely a
question of living conditions.
A student's education should
take place both inside and outside
the classroom. This has become
such a common cliche that I will
not belabor the point that the
individual's development is
dependent at least equally as
much on social living
arrangements as it is on purely
"academic" concerns (if there is
indeed such a pure concern).
It is fair to say that on-campus
housing (in terms of living with
and sharin'g college life with other
students) is an integral and
necessary part of any Stanford
education.
This is too often overlooked in
the debate concerning student
housing. What are usually
discussed are costs and draw rights
and building "priorities." But the
losses being incurred by Stanford
students because of a shortage of
student housing cannot even be
measured.
How To Measure?
How can friendships or social
maturing or common experiences
as a result of dorm or frat life be
measured in concrete terms? And
that is the point. Because of its
inadequate housing system,
Stanford is effecting
immeasurable losses upon its
students and very seriously
reducing the quality of
"education" at Stanford.
As a residential University,
Stanford currently has a duty and
a responsibility to reduce
enrollment to a level which
corresponds to Stanford's ability
to house its students. To refuse to
do so means cheating many
students of the kind of education
that they were led to believe they
would receive at Stanford.
The administration opposes
any reduction in enrollment
because of the resulting reduction
in revenue. How can one argue
against this when the benefits of
on-campus living do not lend
, themselves to dollars-andrcents
refutations? By showing how the
current situation harms all
students and considerably reduces
the quality of the Stanford
education?
Loss Only Temporary
By showing that the loss in
revenues would be only
temporary since enrollment could
be brought back to the current
level once the new student
residences are completed? By
showing that the millions of
dollars Stanford is spending to
attempt to provide a superior
education to its students are being
undermined because of
over-enrollment?
By showing how the present
system destroys the possibility of
any continuity in social
relationships within a residence
from year to year? By showing
that over-enrollment threatens
now to result in the extinction of
fraternities from Stanford because
of inequalities in draw priorities
for some students? Or finally, by
showing that Stanford's position
and reputation declines as this
situation is allowed to continue?
Stanford, in its present state,
has plummeted from the ranks of
leading universities. In its
pretentiousness, Stanford likes to
place itself among the likes of
Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
Others Provide Housing
Yet, these institutions, also all
suffering from financial troubles,
provide housing for their
undergraduates. One does not see
Princeton, for example, adding a
thousand new students to its
enrollment to bolster its economic
condition; it realizes that by doing
so, it would be lowering the
quality of its education and
making itself less worthy of its
high repute.
Harvard reduced this year's
freshman class by 10 percent to
deal with a housing shortage
which, by Stanford standards, is
miniscule. In addition, Harvard
declared a moratorium on
accepting transfer students for the
current year so as to further
combat the problem.
Stanford, on the other hand,
allowed aroung 500 new students
to transfer in, thereby adding salt
to the wound. It is obvious where
the priorities lie at Stanford. So
obvious that until the current
housing tragedy is eliminated, it is
not only pretentious to compare
Stanford any longer with its
former Ivy League counterparts;
to do so is indeed sadly ridiculous.

former Ivy League counterparts;
to do so is indeed sadly ridiculous.
(Philip lan Klein is an

Undergraduate education is
supposedly a primary function of
the University.
Yet the current housing
shortage threatens to undermine
the entire workings of the
educational system here. It is
much more than merely a
question of living conditions.
A student's education should
take place both inside and outside
the classroom. This has become
such a common cliche that I will
not belabor the point that the
individual's development is
dependent at least equally as
much on social living
arrangements as it is on purely
"academic" concerns (if there is
indeed such a pure concern).
It is fair to say that on-campus
housing (in terms of living with
and sharin'g college life with other
students) is an integral and
necessary part of any Stanford
education.
This is too often overlooked in
the debate concerning student
housing. What are usually
discussed are costs and draw rights
and building "priorities." But the
losses being incurred by Stanford
students because of a shortage of
student housing cannot even be
measured.
How To Measure?
How can friendships or social
maturing or common experiences
as a result of dorm or frat life be
measured in concrete terms? And
that is the point. Because of its
inadequate housing system,
Stanford is effecting
immeasurable losses upon its
students and very seriously
reducing the quality of
"education" at Stanford.
As a residential University,
Stanford currently has a duty and
a responsibility to reduce
enrollment to a level which
corresponds to Stanford's ability
to house its students. To refuse to
do so means cheating many
students of the kind of education
that they were led to believe they
would receive at Stanford.
The administration opposes
any reduction in enrollment
because of the resulting reduction
in revenue. How can one argue
against this when the benefits of
on-campus living do not lend
, themselves to dollars-andrcents
refutations? By showing how the
current situation harms all
students and considerably reduces
the quality of the Stanford
education?
Loss Only Temporary
By showing that the loss in
revenues would be only
temporary since enrollment could
be brought back to the current
level once the new student
residences are completed? By
showing that the millions of
dollars Stanford is spending to
attempt to provide a superior
education to its students are being
undermined because of
over-enrollment?
By showing how the present
system destroys the possibility of
any continuity in social
relationships within a residence
from year to year? By showing
that over-enrollment threatens
now to result in the extinction of
fraternities from Stanford because
of inequalities in draw priorities
for some students? Or finally, by
showing that Stanford's position
and reputation declines as this
situation is allowed to continue?
Stanford, in its present state,
has plummeted from the ranks of
leading universities. In its
pretentiousness, Stanford likes to
place itself among the likes of
Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
Others Provide Housing
Yet, these institutions, also all
suffering from financial troubles,
provide housing for their
undergraduates. One does not see
Princeton, for example, adding a
thousand new students to its
enrollment to bolster its economic
condition; it realizes that by doing
so, it would be lowering the
quality of its education and
making itself less worthy of its
high repute.
Harvard reduced this year's
freshman class by 10 percent to
deal with a housing shortage
which, by Stanford standards, is
miniscule. In addition, Harvard
declared a moratorium on
accepting transfer students for the
current year so as to further
combat the problem.
Stanford, on the other hand,
allowed aroung 500 new students
to transfer in, thereby adding salt
to the wound. It is obvious where
the priorities lie at Stanford. So
obvious that until the current
housing tragedy is eliminated, it is
not only pretentious to compare
Stanford any longer with its
former Ivy League counterparts;
to do so is indeed sadly ridiculous.
