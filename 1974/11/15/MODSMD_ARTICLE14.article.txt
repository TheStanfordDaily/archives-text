# Fee Proposals May Be Undeserved--But Who Cares?
## 
### DON COX 
Students face two more fee assessments
next week; if past practices are any indication,
they may routinely approve them without
much concern for the issues or the
consequences.
That is the fear of those who would like to
reverse this trend and have fee assessments
voted for those services that truly deserve the
financial backing and support.
They would like to see the "what's a buck
when I'm paying $5,000 a year" feeling
replaced with a concern to evaluate the
soundness and merits of proposed projects.
The two proposals up for the vote next
week, while some may charge they are only

preying on the students' easy money attitude,
are both defended as being sound projects by
their proponents.
'Live Oak' Asks $1
The new weekly paper Live Oak is asking
for $1 from every student to allow expansion
and a general upgrading of its quality.
And the ASSU will take over record sales
at the Bookstore if students approve a fee
assessment of $1 for this purpose.
ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri is
among those that are urging students not to
rubber-stamp the proposals but to examine
them.
"Everybody and his mother got a fee
assessment last year," complained Olivieri,

who is concerned about establishing a "critical
precedent" of doling out money mindlessly.
So the Live Oak and the record co-op fee
assessments are the first objects for serious
analysis, Olivieri hopes.
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein has said the
paper can operate "indefinitely" on its
present ad revenue. It has money in the bank
and it's on solid financial ground. Weinstein
said that the paper has to rely too heavily on
ads, however, and they limit the amount of
editorial copy that can be printed. A fee
assessment would allow a shift to a larger
paper with a smaller ad line.
No Need?
Olivieri, ASSU President Mike Herman and
Pub Board Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky have
announced their opposition to the Live Oak
fee assessment on the grounds that the paper
is financially solvent and that it doesn't need
$11,500 of student money. They also charge
that the paper has not used a $5OO loan from
the Campus Affairs office, it is too young to go
for an assessment, and it hasn't exhausted all
other possible sources of funding.
The record co-op, sponsored by ASSU
Vice-presidents Ann Carter and Len Mackey,
and undergraduate Lance Friedman, will offer
records to the students at a lower price than
the Bookstore. They claim service, selegtion
and display will be better in the student
operation. The operation might also expand
into other lines of goods such as audio
equipment, bookbags and gift items.
Olivieri and Tom Fitzgerald, assistant

financial manager, have noted that records
will only be a dime cheaper than the
Bookstore under the most recent proposal and
that the whole operation is precariously
balanced economically. It will not pay itself
off for 15 years, and the Bookstore has the
ability to lower the price itself on its records,
they suggest.
Due to the peculiar election rules that
govern fee assessments, it's easier to beat an
assessment by not voting rather than voting
no. This arises out of the ASSU by-law
requirement that 20 percent of the entire

student vote on a fee assessment before
it's valid.
Because the turnout at ASSU elections is
characteristically low,opponents of a measure
can only hurt their position by voting for it.
If next week's ballot measures are worthy
projects, and they are approved by the
students, the election will mean nothing.
If they are ill-considered proposals that are
not sound economically or structurally and
the students vote them down, it might
represent a minor milestone.

that the whole operation is precariously
balanced economically. It will not pay itself
off for 15 years, and the Bookstore has the
ability to lower the price itself on its records,
they suggest.
Due to the peculiar election rules that
govern fee assessments, it's easier to beat an
assessment by not voting rather than voting
no. This arises out of the ASSU by-law
requirement that 20 percent of the entire

student vote on a fee assessment before
it's valid.
Because the turnout at ASSU elections is
characteristically low,opponents of a measure
can only hurt their position by voting for it.
If next week's ballot measures are worthy
projects, and they are approved by the
students, the election will mean nothing.
If they are ill-considered proposals that are
not sound economically or structurally and
the students vote them down, it might
represent a minor milestone.
Students face two more fee assessments
next week; if past practices are any indication,
they may routinely approve them without
much concern for the issues or the
consequences.
That is the fear of those who would like to
reverse this trend and have fee assessments
voted for those services that truly deserve the
financial backing and support.
They would like to see the "what's a buck
when I'm paying $5,000 a year" feeling
replaced with a concern to evaluate the
soundness and merits of proposed projects.
The two proposals up for the vote next
week, while some may charge they are only

preying on the students' easy money attitude,
are both defended as being sound projects by
their proponents.
'Live Oak' Asks $1
The new weekly paper Live Oak is asking
for $1 from every student to allow expansion
and a general upgrading of its quality.
And the ASSU will take over record sales
at the Bookstore if students approve a fee
assessment of $1 for this purpose.
ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri is
among those that are urging students not to
rubber-stamp the proposals but to examine
them.
"Everybody and his mother got a fee
assessment last year," complained Olivieri,

who is concerned about establishing a "critical
precedent" of doling out money mindlessly.
So the Live Oak and the record co-op fee
assessments are the first objects for serious
analysis, Olivieri hopes.
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein has said the
paper can operate "indefinitely" on its
present ad revenue. It has money in the bank
and it's on solid financial ground. Weinstein
said that the paper has to rely too heavily on
ads, however, and they limit the amount of
editorial copy that can be printed. A fee
assessment would allow a shift to a larger
paper with a smaller ad line.
No Need?
Olivieri, ASSU President Mike Herman and
Pub Board Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky have
announced their opposition to the Live Oak
fee assessment on the grounds that the paper
is financially solvent and that it doesn't need
$11,500 of student money. They also charge
that the paper has not used a $5OO loan from
the Campus Affairs office, it is too young to go
for an assessment, and it hasn't exhausted all
other possible sources of funding.
The record co-op, sponsored by ASSU
Vice-presidents Ann Carter and Len Mackey,
and undergraduate Lance Friedman, will offer
records to the students at a lower price than
the Bookstore. They claim service, selegtion
and display will be better in the student
operation. The operation might also expand
into other lines of goods such as audio
equipment, bookbags and gift items.
Olivieri and Tom Fitzgerald, assistant

financial manager, have noted that records
will only be a dime cheaper than the
Bookstore under the most recent proposal and
that the whole operation is precariously
balanced economically. It will not pay itself
off for 15 years, and the Bookstore has the
ability to lower the price itself on its records,
