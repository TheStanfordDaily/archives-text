# Stanford's Money Woes Stem From U.S. Economy
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
During the same week in which President
Ford finally admitted that the nation is
entering a recession, acting University
President William Miller conceded that
Stanford's budget has been pared to the point
where future cost slices will start hurting.
When circumspect optimists like Miller talk
about trouble, you can be sure a crisis is at
hand.
Miller's announcement on Tuesday that the
University expects a $1.6 million deficit for
1974-75 and sustained a $713,000 deficit last
year surprised few people, although the exact
size of the problem had obviously been
underestimated.
The University reduced its operating
expenses by three percent last spring, cutting
corners wherever it could and eliminating the
same expenditures from this year's budget.
Now, it seems that there are no more corners
left to cut, and Miller claims that future
spending reductions will have "noticeable
impact" on University programs.
The latest announcement of financial
gloom occurred only weeks after President
Lyman unveiled a three-year, Jslo million
austerity program and warned that the
University faces a $22 million deficit in five
years if spending is not curbed.
Stanford's money woes are inextricably
tied to the nation's recession. Lyman has
repeatedly blamed the "collapse of the stock
market" for the loss of millions of dollars in
University income.
Inflation has also devastated the best laid
plans of the University's financial experts. It
has devalued the endowment, forced up costs
especially salaries and thrown a chaotic
element of uncertainty into the entire
planning process. Reduction in federal grants
to the University have further disrupted
planning.
Some critics of the Uniersity's planning
procedure argue that the current plight could
have been avoided if more money had been
invested in endowment during the University's
years of expansion in the late 1950s and early
19605.
But University officials are quick to point
out that the planners of those years could not
have foreseen the current recession and
inflation. They claim that without the
smmmfflmm Â» . mmmsmsmmmm

national crisis, the University would not be
faced with budget deficits.
Considerable credence is lent to this view
by recent Business Week and Fortune
Magazine articles noting that Stanford in the
1950s was the first university in the nation to
set up a large planning office that applied
sophisticated business techniques to university
management. According to Fortune,
Stanford's careful financial planning has
served as model for universities throughout
the nation.
University financial planners now are
engaged in a new challenge, attempting to cut
costs without lowering academic quality while
attempting to second guess and inexorable
and unprecedented inflationary recession.
The Budget Priorities Commission is
currently studying alternatives and is
determined not to act rashly. But certain cuts
seem inevitable.
First, the University staff probably faces a
reduction in size. According to Lyman, the
University hopes to avoid laying anyone off.
Instead, new vacancies will not be filled.
Construction plans might also be
pigeon-holed for a while Most notably, the
building of a proposed $25 million library
may be postponed. Officials are currently
undecided about whether to build the library
on a reduced scale or to wait and carry
through some day with the original, lavish
plan.
More than ever, the student housing crunch
seems to be here to stay. Since housing adds
little to the University's academic prestige, it
is doubtful that the administration will
approve spending for housing at a time when
cutbackes are seriously under consideration.
There has been no indication however that the
University plans to abandon its plans to
construct two $3 million row houses.
If misery loves company, the University
can take some solace by observing the
financial dilemma facing other universities. All
major private universities watch helplessly as
inflation corrodes their endowments and the
stock market slide decimates dividends.
So Stanford's academic standing relative to
other universities is not endangered.
Consequently, the real loser of the current
recession is not Stanford alone, but American
higher education as a whole.
