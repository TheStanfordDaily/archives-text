# The 						ASSU Managing Tresidder? That's What Dale Snape Wants
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Asst. Dean of Students Dale Snape
proposed this week that the ASSU take
control of Tresidder Union to make it more
responsive to student needs.
He said that the ASSU should "move
toward the trend of service orientation" as the
University of California student associations
have done.
UC-Berkeley runs its own bookstore,
UC-Davis has a bus service into the downtown

area and UCLA provides a large complex of
student services, Snape said.
However, ASSU President Mike Herman
objected to Snape's comparison of Stanford
with the UC campuses. "There are so many
differences between us and the UCs in the
entire structure of a student union. I
appreciate Dale's challenge to the ASSU
Senate [to expand ASSU service programs],
but it might be a little too soon."
Avoid Pitfalls
Snape contended that Tresidder could
conceivably "avoid some of the pitfalls seen
throughout its history" if the ASSU managed
the operation. "The ASSU is able to look
upon Tresidder as a resource and tool," he
said, "while the University's ultimate budget
decisions" have academic priorities.
Snape said that the ASSU has proven its
"ability to provide desirable, profit-making
services." Tresidder is losing money, and as
Senate Chairman Lee Rosenbaum said, the
University wants "to get rid of it."
The implication is that the ASSU with
the help of professional managers could
turn Tresidder into a profit-making or
break-even operation as the University
worried about its own financial troubles.
Starr Opposed
Tresidder's General Manager Gordon Stan
opposed any plan to have ASSU run the
Union. "There's a problem of continuity with

the turnover of students," Starr said
yesterday. "I don't like the idea of ASSU
running Tresidder."
Starr suggested a possible
Tresidder-Bookstore merger that would accrue
"less accounting costs and less administrative
costs" for Tresidder.
ASSU Sen. Tim Conway thought the
Tresidder proposal was "totally unfeasible. We
[the ASSU] just don't have the necessary
capital right now." However, Conway
conceded that Tresidder should be "more
responsive" to students and that ASSU
control "might be a good idea" sometime in
the future.
"I'd like to see a McDonald's in Tresidder,"
Conway said.
If the 'Senate now agrees that ASSU
services should expand, then it is a curious
shift of opinion. Last week, many senators
feared ASSU expansion in the Bookstore after
establishment of the proposed record co-op.
It appears that Snape's proposal is a long
way from realization. Herman's Council of
Presidents has a definite service orientation,
but there's no guarantee that succeeding
administrations will support the trend of
expanding services.
The Snape proposal remains open for
scrutiny. But right now, no one can form a
plan to help financially-crippled Tresidder
that is agreeable to everyone involved.
