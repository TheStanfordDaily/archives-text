# Guess What, Fraternity Brothers?
## Horton Leaning Toward Doing Away With Fraternity Draw Exemptions--So Get Ready To Join... 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton finally indicated last week he is
leaning towards a recommendation to
eliminate the draw-exempt status for
fraternities.
Horton, who has consistently professed he
will consider all proposals for a new housing
system, said at a meeting in Rinconada that
every single group he has met with "believe
we should do our best to retain fraternities as
a housing option, but not with vast
privileges."
Just a few weeks ago on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Horton said he had no preference
for one system over another. "I don't think I
can really make that judgment yet," he
declared then.
Horton has been studying the housing
system since last spring when the Committee
on Services to Students (COSS) said the
system discriminates against women because
only fraternities are exempt from the housing
draw. There is no housing option for women
which would allow them the same privilege.
Consider COSS
Horton has said he will seriously consider a
housing system recommendation from the
COSS housing subcommittee. Its

recommendation could also have a substantial
influence on President Richard Lyman's final
decision.
However, though it is unlikely if the
subcommittee and Horton were to submit
separate proposals to Lyman, he would be
confronted with recommendations from a
group appointed Nov. 5 to consider the
problem and from a person who has spent
more than six months studying the issue.
Horton continues to visit dormitories with
what he dubs his "road shows," soliciting .
student opinions and explaining the facts of
the dilemma. Yet he shoots a formulated
retort at any proposal mentioned. Horton has
an answer for everything.
Some students feel that Horton's shows,
complete with his elaborate housing system
chart, are merely that shows. "He's making
it look like he's listening to students'
opinions, but he has already made up his
mind," one student said.
Why Not Sororities
Horton is frequently asked why the
University doesn't reinstate sororities to give
some women draw-exempt status. Congress
crushed one of Horton's favorite arguments
Wednesday when it supported amending the
Title IX of the federal Education

Amendments Act of 1972.
Horton usually cites a proposed regulation
to Title IX which could possibly prevent the
University from assisting any organization
which discriminates on the basis of sex. But
now Congress will amend the Title IX to
exclude fraternities and sororities from the
organizations.
Horton also mentions that reviving
sororities would necessitate reversing the 1944
Board of Trustees decision to eliminate
sororities on campus.
However, he agreed reluctantly at
Rinconada that the trustees' policy would be
illegal under regulations developed under Title
IX.
Horton Won't Bite
Fraternity members have not been able to
lure Horton to support sororities.
Inter-Fraternity Council President Mike
Nilsson said two national sororities have
shown an interest in establishing locals on
campus. However, Nilsson has not been able
to produce evidence that Stanford women
want sororities to return.
The IFC has dropped a plan to fight
Horton and the possible obliteration of
fraternities on legal grounds. In mid-October
the Council considered obtaining legal

counsel, but on Oct. 31 Nilsson declared
fraternities could not be saved on legal issues.
Fraternity members have also not been
able to prove to Horton that including
fraternities in the draw would destroy them.
Horton has said many times that the
University "wants to preserve fraternities"
because "having a variety of living options is
desirable."
Yet he said he personally cannot accept the
judgment that the fraternities will die if filled
through the draw.
A Sigma Alpha Epsilon member remarked
at the Rinconada meeting that the president
of Kappa Sigma, the only all-male fraternity
in the draw, told him "for all intents and
purposes the fraternity is dead." Horton
disagreed.
He said Kappa Sigma "is stronger today"
than when it joined the draw in order to avoid
folding.
It appears that no one has submitted a
proposal which will convince Horton to retain
the fraternities' draw-exempt status. Unless a
brilliant idea emerges from the murky depths
of ignorance and confusion surrounding this
issue, the decision is already apparent.
Fraternity members, welcome to the draw.

Board of Trustees decision to eliminate
sororities on campus.
However, he agreed reluctantly at
Rinconada that the trustees' policy would be
illegal under regulations developed under Title
IX.
Horton Won't Bite
Fraternity members have not been able to
lure Horton to support sororities.
Inter-Fraternity Council President Mike
Nilsson said two national sororities have
shown an interest in establishing locals on
campus. However, Nilsson has not been able
to produce evidence that Stanford women
want sororities to return.
The IFC has dropped a plan to fight
Horton and the possible obliteration of
fraternities on legal grounds. In mid-October
the Council considered obtaining legal

counsel, but on Oct. 31 Nilsson declared
fraternities could not be saved on legal issues.
Fraternity members have also not been
able to prove to Horton that including
fraternities in the draw would destroy them.
Horton has said many times that the
University "wants to preserve fraternities"
because "having a variety of living options is
desirable."
Yet he said he personally cannot accept the
judgment that the fraternities will die if filled
through the draw.
A Sigma Alpha Epsilon member remarked
at the Rinconada meeting that the president
of Kappa Sigma, the only all-male fraternity
in the draw, told him "for all intents and
purposes the fraternity is dead." Horton
disagreed.
He said Kappa Sigma "is stronger today"
than when it joined the draw in order to avoid
folding.
It appears that no one has submitted a
proposal which will convince Horton to retain
the fraternities' draw-exempt status. Unless a
brilliant idea emerges from the murky depths
of ignorance and confusion surrounding this
issue, the decision is already apparent.
Fraternity members, welcome to the draw.

Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton finally indicated last week he is
leaning towards a recommendation to
eliminate the draw-exempt status for
fraternities.
Horton, who has consistently professed he
will consider all proposals for a new housing
system, said at a meeting in Rinconada that
every single group he has met with "believe
we should do our best to retain fraternities as
a housing option, but not with vast
privileges."
Just a few weeks ago on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Horton said he had no preference
for one system over another. "I don't think I
can really make that judgment yet," he
declared then.
Horton has been studying the housing
system since last spring when the Committee
on Services to Students (COSS) said the
system discriminates against women because
only fraternities are exempt from the housing
draw. There is no housing option for women
which would allow them the same privilege.
Consider COSS
Horton has said he will seriously consider a
housing system recommendation from the
COSS housing subcommittee. Its

recommendation could also have a substantial
influence on President Richard Lyman's final
decision.
However, though it is unlikely if the
subcommittee and Horton were to submit
separate proposals to Lyman, he would be
confronted with recommendations from a
group appointed Nov. 5 to consider the
problem and from a person who has spent
more than six months studying the issue.
Horton continues to visit dormitories with
what he dubs his "road shows," soliciting .
student opinions and explaining the facts of
the dilemma. Yet he shoots a formulated
retort at any proposal mentioned. Horton has
an answer for everything.
Some students feel that Horton's shows,
complete with his elaborate housing system
chart, are merely that shows. "He's making
it look like he's listening to students'
opinions, but he has already made up his
mind," one student said.
Why Not Sororities
Horton is frequently asked why the
University doesn't reinstate sororities to give
some women draw-exempt status. Congress
crushed one of Horton's favorite arguments
Wednesday when it supported amending the
Title IX of the federal Education

Amendments Act of 1972.
Horton usually cites a proposed regulation
to Title IX which could possibly prevent the
University from assisting any organization
which discriminates on the basis of sex. But
now Congress will amend the Title IX to
exclude fraternities and sororities from the
organizations.
Horton also mentions that reviving
sororities would necessitate reversing the 1944
Board of Trustees decision to eliminate
sororities on campus.
However, he agreed reluctantly at
Rinconada that the trustees' policy would be
illegal under regulations developed under Title
