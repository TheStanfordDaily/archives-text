# Park District Urges Council To Spare Trees Along Creek
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Midpeninsula Regional Park District
recommended to the Palo Alto City Council this
week that any extension of Willow Road between
Arboretum and El Camino Real spare the trees
along San Francisquito Creek.
According to board member Nonette Hanko, the
City Council's current plan for widening the road
would force the destruction of approximately 20
trees.
The board also expressed concern that the
widening of Willow would interfere with a plan to
link the creek with a future trail and park.
Board President William Snyder explained that
the district, a citizens group, is working with a
Trails Task Force to construct a series of regional
trails that will eventually link the foothills with San
Francisco Bay.
Snyder claimed that the widening of the road
near the creek would at worst make such a link
impossible and at best would add to the area's noise
and make the trail unpleasant.
"The concept of extending Willow Road is, on
its own, probably meritorious," Snyder said. "The

district has taken no stand on whether or not the
road should be extended, nor are we telling the
Council how to reroute the road."
Peters conceded that any plan to widen Willow
Road will involve engineering problems, since the
trail and the trees were not considered when the
road was originally constructed.
According to Hanko, the city's current plans
would uproot about 20 trees, including eucalyptus,
redwood, walnut and cedar. She said that some of
them are at least 100 years old.
The issue of destroying trees was discussed at
some length at a Council meeting last week.
Councilman Alan Henderson and Enid Pearson
supported a plan which would have destroyed few
if any of the trees in the area. But the
council members voted 6-2 to accept a plan
sponsored by Councilman Richard Rosenbaum
which might destroy the 20 trees.
Rosenbaum told the Daily last week that he
does not want to unnecessarily uproot any trees
and hopes that the staff can find away to preserve
them while extending the road.
