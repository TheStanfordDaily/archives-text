# Researchers Discuss Uses Of Computers In Solving Complex Medical Problems
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Computers may hold the keys to a
number of complex medical questions,
ffom when a patient is suffering from
glaucoma to what causes paranoia,
medical researchers said here
yesterday.
Medical researchers from across the
nation attended a day-long conference
on the use of computers in medicine
held in conjunction with the
dedication of the Stanford University
Medical Experimental Computer
facility (SUMEX).
Directed by Genetics Prof. Joshua
Lederberg, a Nobel Laureate, a
SUMEX project explores uses of
artificial intelligence in many health
fields, from psychiatry to
ophthalmology.
In artifical intelligence applications,
the computer is used as an extension
of the human brain, rather than simply
as a calculator. By storing huge bodies
of knowledge, constructing models
and making complex decisions, the
computer can become an invaluable
aid to doctors.
Computer Network
The backbone of SUMEX is a
Stanford PDP-10 computer connected
by two networks to user terminals in
50 cities. Through this network,
researchers can share both facilities
and knowledge.
The use of computer-based
consultation systems for diseases of
the eye was discussed by Professors
Saul Amarel and Casimir Kulikowski
of Rutgers. Together with Dr. Afran
Safir, an ophthalmologist at Mt. Sinai
School of Medicine, they have
developed a national computer
network to diagnose and treat
glaucoma.
Glaucoma is a disease in which
increased pressure within the eye
impairs sight, sometimes leading to
blindness. The disease most frequently
strikes among those over 40.
An elaborate computer model of
glaucoma, which includes symptoms,
their pathological causes and possible
treatments, will soon be tested at three
eye centers: Mount Sinai Hospital and
Medical Center, New York;
Washington University, St. Louis ; and
Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore.
Trying to simulate the
tremendously complex, often

instinctive thought processes of a
physician making a diagnosis has its
own problems, Julikowski noted.
"Doctors rarely agree on the decision
rules," he said.
Another problem researchers face is
in developing computer systems that
briefly tell the physician why a
prescribed treatment should be used,
Computer Science Prof. Edward
Feigenbaum said. Doctors will not
accept a suggested treatment in a
life-or-death situation "unless they
[the systems] can explain
themselves," he emphasized.
Diseases of the mind may also
eventually be cured with the aid of
computers, suggested Dr. Kenneth
Coiby, a UCLA psychiatrist and
computer scientist. Colby spoke about
his development of a computer
of a paranoid patient.
The computer simulates a paranoiac
in such detail that it can actually be
"interviewed" by a psychiatrist.
During the interview, the "patient"
even asks itself whether its
interrogator "is incompetent, whether
he's crazy, whether he's a sex fiend,"
similar to the way a paranoiac would
illogically suspect others of wanting to
harm him.
The "patient" can even withdraw
by telling the interviewer, "I'm getting
exhausted. I've got to go," Colby
added, prompting laughter from his
audience.
Thoughts Understood
Thus, psychiatrists can better
understand the thought processes of a
paranoiac, and attempt to discover the
causes and treatments of the disease,
Colby said. Using his computer model,
Colby is working on a theory that
paranoia is an extreme sensitivity
caused by shame or humiliation.
Appropriately using computer
terminology, he admitted that he's
ldoking at paranoia exclusively as a
"software" disorder the result of
psychological disturbances. Many
other scientists are investigating
possible "hardware" (biochemical)
causes of mental disorders.
But "at some level everything is
chemical," he said.
Colby forsees a need for
experiments on the effects of
humiliation on paranoid patients to
test his theory. But noting that such
experiments would be "extremely

cruel," he asked, "Is it ethical to
experiment on paranoid patients?"
Two SUMEX projects based at
Stanford were also discussed. A
computer program which helps
physicians choose the correct
antibiotic to treat a bacterial infection
has been developed by Doctors
Stanley Cohen and Stanton Axline of
the Medical School.
Feigenbaum, Lederberg and

Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi have
created a system which will analyze
unknown organic compounds found in
the human body.
The scientists hope that by
studying the incidence of these
compounds in healthy and sick bodies,
they may eventually be able to
identify diseases by determining the
amounts of these compounds present
in a patient.
