# Famine Committee Plans Campaign
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The African Famine Relief
Committee has only collected $l4
so far this year, according to Dave
"Big Daddy" McCullum, but he
added that committee work has
only just begun.
The committee made the
money on Friday night sales of
chicken dinners earlier this
quarter. The dinners were cooked
by Big Daddy.
Response was not as high as
usual, Big Daddy said, and he
suggested that this was because of
insufficient advertising.
He added, however, that the
major objective of the dinner sales
was not to make a lot of money.
"What we've been doing," he
said, "is trying to get people
interested in the famine. A lot of
people would be interested if they
knew what was going on."
The student-run committee is

an off-shoot of Relief for Africans
in Need in the Sahel (RAINS), a
coalition of Afro-American
organizations joined together to
mobilize a national response to
; the African famine.
Charles Ogletree, acting
. program coordinator, estimated
; that one million Africans have
' died of malnutrition and disease
during the past six years in the
Southern Sahara desert area.
The famine in Africa is the
' result of a six-year drought,
Ogletree explained. He denied
that the rain that has fallen this
; year in the Sahel means the crisis
/'"is over.
"The torrential rain which has
fallen in the southern area of the
Sahel has often done more
damage by wiping out existing
dirt roads and making the delivery
> of relief food impossible," he said.

"Even with good rains all over
the Sahel," it will take a minimum
of seven years for the land to
recover and be usable for farming,
he added.
The major job of the
committee this year will be to get
information on the Sahel situation
to the public, Ogletree said.
According to Ogletree, the
committee plans to show a film
Sahel: Border On Hell sometime
before Thanksgiving vacation and
once before Christmas vacation,
but, exact times and places have
not been decided yet.
The committee hopes to show
the film in dormitories beginning
next quarter, Ogletree said.

In addition, Big Daddy said he
hopes to teach a culinary class
beginning next quarter and at the
same time lecture on the situation
in Africa.
Ogletree said the committee is
planning several other fund-raising
events, including a spring carnival,
car washes, more chicken dinner
sales and a food fast.
The committee has some new
ideas on what to do with the
money, Ogletree said. Instead of
just donating it to RAINS, the
committee may use the money to
send some students to Africa to
get a first-hand look at the
situation or use the money to buy
a tractor for Africa, he said.
