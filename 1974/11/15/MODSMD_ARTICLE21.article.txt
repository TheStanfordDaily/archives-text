"Long ago I knew perhaps that
mine was not a truly first-rate
talent. I had then two choices
onlyâ€”to throw it over or to use
what I had to the best of my
ability. I chose the second and I
have tried to keep it clean."
So John Steinbeck wrote June
27, 1961, in one of the
remarkable and candid letters just
acquired by the Stanford
University Library from Carlton
Allyn Sheffield, a roommate of
Steinbeck's at Stanford and a
friend of many years.
The collection includes 62
letters from Steinbeck, written
over a period of 40 years and a
series of manuscripts of early
writings of the Nobel Prize
winning author.
In an interview in his Los Altos
Hills home this week, Sheffield
told of coming to Stanford, where
he first met Steinbeck. "I was
working in the shipyards in Long

Beach it was 1919. Several of
the fellows were talking. 'This is a
helluva life,' we said. There must
be something better than this.'
" 'Well, what colleges were
there? There was the University of
California at Berkeley and there
was Stanford.
" 'Hell,' someone else said,
'don't go to UC, that's too
expensive. At Stanford the tuition
is free.'"
Boxing Battles
Sheffield came to Stanford in
October 1919 and met Steinbeck
in his freshman year. "I came to
know John through classes at
first. And then we used to box a
little. The boxing consisted of his
hitting me and my falling down
and getting up and being hit
again."
Steinbeck dropped out of
school in 1921 and Sheffield lost
track of him. "But then on
registration day in January 1923 I

was signing up for my classes in
journalism and there he was.
"He said he was rooming with
someone who had pictures of
naked women pasted on all the
walls. He said he liked naked
women personally but he didn't
care to be surrounded by pictures
of them."
Steinbeck and Sheffield
became roommates, living in
Encina for two quarters. Sheffield
graduated in 1923, but Steinbeck
left later without graduating.
"He refused to take required
courses," Sheffield says. "He took
every writing course offered but
one, a play-writing class. Professor
Grey told him he didn't have the
qualifications."
They both took a verse-writing
class under English Prof. William
Herbert Carruth. "We'd sit on the
grass on the oval writing verses.
Some of it was rather charming."
An outgrowth of that
verse-writing, "A Tahoe Epic" by
Steinbeck, is included in the
manuscripts in the collection.
After graduation Sheffield
went to work as a newspaper
reporter for The Long Beach
Telegram." After he left school
John had a night job keeping the
lab open at the Spreckels Sugar
factory. It wasn't much of a job.
We were both writing to each
other two or three times a week.
"I had a whole shopping bag
full of letters from that time, but
once, some time later, John got
hold of them and fed them on the
fire, one leaf at a time."
Sheffield and Steinbeck finally
decided to go into business
together, selling Echophone radios
in Long Beach.
'Cup Of Gold'
"Neither of us knew anything
about how radios worked. I'd
spend all my time trying to figure

out how to get the talking tape,
the aerial, taped to the moulding.
John would stand around and not
say a word.
"Well, we finally sold one.
That was to my aunt. We made
$lO commission and split it. John
went back to Pacific Grove and
then on up to Lake Tahoe where
he finished Cup of Gold."
Among the manuscripts in the
collection is the first half of an
early version of Cup of Gold.
Sheffield speaks of the care
Steinbeck took in his writing. "He
insisted he'd rewritten Cup of
Gold six times."
In a letter in 1933, Steinbeck
describes his method of working
on a novel. One puts down endless
observations and pieces of
research, he wrote. "But until you
can put your theme down in one
sentence you're not ready to start
writing. Then when you start, it's
the most exciting time in the
world."
Steinbeck became famous after
the publication of The Grapes of
Wrath in 1939. "He found the
side effects of fame difficult to
take," says Sheffield. "He fought
off making speeches and he hated
having his photograph taken. He
said that a photograph took part
of him away."
Parts ot the collection will be
on view to the public in an exhibit
planned for April 1975. Currently
supervising documentation of the
collection is Florian J. Shasky,
chief of the special collections
department, with the assistance of
Patricia Palmer, manuscripts
librarian.
