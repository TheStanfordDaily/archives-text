Rolling Stones
It's Only Rock 'n Roll
Rolling Stones Records
COC 29101-0698
It's Only Rock 'n Roll is quite
simply the best Rolling Stones
album since Beggars' Banquet.
Gone is the vague
experimentation which marked
Goat's Head Soup. Gone is the
jumbled thinness which flawed
Exile on Main Street. Gone is the
unsettling uneveness of Sticky
Fingers. Instead, the Stones have
presented us with 50 minutes of
well-paced, confident, rich and
accessible ballads and rockers.
"If you can't rock me" opens
the first side. Mick Jagger assaults
all "you women in your leather
and lace;" informing them that he
"ain't looking for no wedding
date." You get the general idea
from the chorus line: "if you
can't rock me somebody will."
Instrumentally, the tune
departs from the tight format
dominating previous Stones'
rockers. Mick Taylor is allowed
room to move, and proves himself
the equal of any rock guitar
player around (especially Eric
Clapton). Keith Richards wields

his rhythm guitar more like a
powerful second lead, holding the
group together, but standing out
with each one of his well planned
licks. Quiet Bill Wyman's bass is
even permitted a chance to be
heard, complementing his two
guitarists in some call and
response interplay near the middle
of the song.
Big Hit Single
The title track is probably
familiar to most as the Stones'
summer single. In the context of
the album it becomes a statement
of purpose. The Stones play
because they like to. It's only
rock 'n roll, a limited form of art,
but it's fun. Jagger revels in its
decadence and hedonism. This
pleasure is no weakness.
"Time waits for no one" may
be the best non-rocker the Stones
have ever put down on vinyl. It is
a masterpiece both lyrically and
musically. Jagger admonishes us.
He demands a consideration and
assessment of the present in
relation to one's goals and
ambitions. "Hear him come
shufflin' and reapin '/ Hear him
laugh before cheatin' " time
wasted is life lost.

As a reflection on Jagger's own
status, the thoughts are more
profound than those voiced in
"It's only rock 'n roll." The
questions raised are harder to
answer. How long do you plan
rock 'n roll if you're a Rolling
Stone? How much do you limit
yourself? When do you move on?
Watts Set Pace
Charlie Watts drums evenly and
relentlessly through "Time." The
remainder of the group follows
this lead, pushing on, issuing a
challenge to the vocalist. Taylor's
willowy guitar dances around
Jagger, toying with him. Finally,
Jagger fades out, overmatched
against Taylor and overwhelmed
by the rest.
The second side is as good as
the first. It opens with "Luxury,"
a reggae influenced rock song,
very similar to Jagger and
Richards' "I Can Feel the Fire"
on Ron Wood's solo album.
Thankfully, it is not an attempt at
straight reggae. No imitations
here. Wyman, Hopkins, Watts and
Richards set down the beat.
Taylor adds the frills. Jagger sings
about keeping Bianca in
diamonds.
"Dance little sister" follows,
providing the kind of shoot from
the pelvis, stick and thrust rock at
which the Stones are most adept.
Again, Taylor shines; when not
soloing he burns beneath Jagger's
exhortations.
Jagger Plea
Jagger shows the tempo down
for "If you really want to be my
friend," affectionately asking a
lover for freedom, urging her to
"give me the look of love, not
jealousy." Blue Magic's
background vocals add an
appropriate soft touch to the
sound.
"Fingerprint File" rounds out
the album. It is the most complex
work in the collection, employing
a synthesizer (either Wyman or
Taylor) for its funk beat. The
guitars, bass and piano shift in and
out of focus, each taking
command for an instant. Someone
has been listening to just a little
bit of Herbie Hancock. Lyrically
it's an ensemble of paranoid lines
about invasions of privacy.
Anyone who has seen Gene
Hackman in The Conversation will
understand. Those who haven't
don't have to pay attention in
order to appreciate the music.
Overall, It's Only Rock 'n Roll
is significant in two respects. It
marks a return to roots by the
Stones. Rock is their medium;
they are masters at it. Secondly,

Mick Taylor has emerged as a
third major musical force in the
group. Since the death of Brian
Jones, Jagger and Richards have
been entirely responsible for the
band's product.
Indeed the capable production
on this album is credited to them
under the alias "Glimmer Twin."
Now Taylor has staked out a place
for himself. The Stones remain
tight, but Taylor escapes the
restricted instrumental format
characteristic of the group
previously. The rest of the band
stretches but as well. As a result
the songs are longer and more
satisfying. One gets the feeling

that this expansion is just
beginning; this band is still
growing.

Neil Diamond '
Serenade
Columbia TC-32919
Attention, dreamers of the
world!, Neil Diamond's newest
album has just been released for
you. It is guaranteed to Serenade
you (as the title suggests). He'll
unlock your spirit to bring you
gentle romance and less than
subtle inspiration, although not a
rude awakening.
This LP is certainly not unique
from his previous productions. In
fact, considering the stream of
tunes Diamond turned to gold,
imagine a collage of his most
typical hits.
For instance, "I Am I Said"
depicts his spiritual classicism, so
respectively, he sings "Lady
Magdelene" and "I've Been This
Way Before" on the Serenade
album.
Jamaican and Latin rock
rhythms are characterized by two
old favorites, "Porcupine Pie" and
"Crunch Granola," and in turn, he
includes the "Reggae Strut" and
"The Last Picasso" in his latest
venture.
Diamond does expand talented
traits in an outstanding country
folk melody, "Rosemary's Wine."
Out of the three remaining, two

songs mediocre descriptions of
common life and love themes. The
third overcompensates for these.
It's his current popular single,
"Longfellow Serenade," which
has been monopolizing radio air
time.
Diamond, as always, performs
to the peak of energy. He only
misses low notes twice (in concert
he is known for "voice breaking"
due to giving his all and more),
but in the album he maintains his
ruggedly sexy tone quality.
Emotional vibes are radiated as
potently as freshly peeled orange
rind, and communication is

effective.
Had you been adding up the
number of selections Diamond
performs on the Serenade album,
a major flaw would have probably
occurred to you. The fact that
there are only eight pieces is
clearly disconcerting, especially
for materialists who prefer to
economize. In addition, it's
disappointing for the many who
anxiously await his annual creation.
Whether the album is worth it or
not depends on individual craving
for spiritual uplifting. For those,
it is most likely priceless.

Buddy Miles
All the Faces of Buddy Miles
Columbia KC 33089
Buddy Miles is probably the
only drummer to record with
both Jimi Hendrix and John
McLaughlin, but there are no
clues of that fact on this new
release. For one thing, Miles
doesn't play drums at all. For
another, the music is as banal,
boring and commercial as any ever
recorded.
Miles sings at least as well as
ever before on this record: it's
what he sings that is so
disappointing. Most of the tunes
on this album (and the throwaway
lyrics as well) were written by
producer Johnny Bristol, a
relative unknown who has
managed to combine the absolute
worst aspects of A1 Green, Tower
of Power and Motown. Miles is
hardly a great drummer, but he's
never done anything as
embarassing as All the Faces.

Daryl Hall and John Oates

War Babies
Atlantic SD-18109

Hall and Oates' new release has
been getting quite a lot of airplay
lately, and with good reason. It
represents a worthy successor to
recent electronic-pop recordings
by performers like David Bowie
and Todd Rundgren.
Rundgren is a major reason for
the success of this album; he plays
guitar and sings and, while he did
not write any of the songs, his
influence can be heard clearly on
every composition. "You're Much

Too Soon" especially sounds like
it could have come straight from
Rundgren's Something/Anything
album.
Hall and Oates, who share the
lead vocals, are not likely to rival
Loggins and Messina for
distinctive sound: both have
pleasant, if somewhat weak,
voices. Their understated style
works well with this material.
"Is It a Star?" stands out
among several well-written songs
on the album; it features some
fine wah-wah guitar work by Rich
Cerniglia and some nicely
constructed vocal harmonies.
Rundgren's solos, often coupled
with subtle synthesizer effects/
provide some of the brighter
moments in the music. His guitar
blends nicely with Hall's mandolin
to give "Better Watch Your Back"
a bubbly sound.
■ y
Hall, who wrote most of the
words and music, seems to have
subscribed to the Todd Rundgren
school of lyrics. Some of his
words are unextraordinary, and
one song, "I'm Watching You"
(subtitled "A Mutant Romance")
actually forms an interesting
scenario in nighttime Times
Square. When he starts including
stories about Faustus, who "ate
glass for an appetizer and bled all
over his synthesizer," it is time to
start concentrating on the music.
That's not a bad idea anyway,
if you want to hear one of the
best-played pop records of the
year.

TOASTING SUCCESS—Mick Jagger, shown here long ago, is able to
smile again after the commercial success of the Stones' latest album,
It's Only Rock 'n Roll. Billy Preston, one of the stars of the George
Harrison tour, performs on a few of the album's songs.
