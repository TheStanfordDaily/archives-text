# Airto Makes Unique Sounds With Strange Instruments
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
There are few bandleaders in
the world who play the berimbau
and the caxixi, let alone a
life-sized statue of a human made
of cymbals, bells and shakers, but
Airto made vibrant music on all of
them last weekend at the Great
American Music Hall.
Airto's quintet, Fingers, plays
an exotic blend of South
American folk music and
American jazz, always focusing on
the infectious rhythms provided
by their Brazilian master

percussionist and leader. Whether
flailing away on drums or singing
exuberant scat vocals or playing
something from his legendary
collection of rattles, bells and
anything else that makes a sound,
Airto gives the music its unique
flavor.
Fingers features a front line of
Raul, another Brazilian, on bass
trombone, Barry Finnerty on
guitar, and Mike Wolf on electric
piano, with Charles Fambrough's
bass aiding a powerful bottom to
the rhythmic concoctions.
Finnerty was particularly

impressive, stating most of the
themes with his soft, fluid runs.
Raul played very well on his
difficult instrument, with a fine,
understated solo on Antonio
Carlos Jobim's "Dindi" Wolf at
times played in the same style
Chick Corea has used on his
Latin-flavored pieces.
There could be no doubt,
though, that Fingers is Airto's
band. Although he uses a very
small kit, his drumming is
exceptionally powerful and his
drum solos, especially when he
accompanied himself with
whistling and shouting, were
fascinating and very infectious. He
spent most of the set on drums,
powering the band's samba pieces
as well as the more rock-oriented
numbers like those on his recent
album, Virgin Lands.
Easily the highlights of the
show, however, were Airto's solo
percussion excursions. He
transformed an ordinary
tambourine into a unique
instrument; his amazing solo on
maracas and caxixi, a type of
whistle made from dried seaweed,
was not only a lot of fun but
exuberantly great music as well.
Even more remarkable was the
percussionist's simple tune, sung
in Portuguese and accompanied
by his own berimbau, a primitive
instrument consisting of a wire
stretched between the ends of a
bent stick, and played by striking
the wire with a short stick. Airto
added further accompaniment by
scratching a gourd.

Carlos Jobim's "Dindi" Wolf at
times played in the same style
Chick Corea has used on his
Latin-flavored pieces.
There could be no doubt,
though, that Fingers is Airto's
band. Although he uses a very
small kit, his drumming is
exceptionally powerful and his
drum solos, especially when he
accompanied himself with
whistling and shouting, were
fascinating and very infectious. He
spent most of the set on drums,
powering the band's samba pieces
as well as the more rock-oriented
numbers like those on his recent
album, Virgin Lands.
Easily the highlights of the
show, however, were Airto's solo
percussion excursions. He
transformed an ordinary
tambourine into a unique
instrument; his amazing solo on
maracas and caxixi, a type of
whistle made from dried seaweed,
was not only a lot of fun but
exuberantly great music as well.
Even more remarkable was the
percussionist's simple tune, sung
in Portuguese and accompanied
by his own berimbau, a primitive
instrument consisting of a wire
stretched between the ends of a
bent stick, and played by striking
the wire with a short stick. Airto
added further accompaniment by
scratching a gourd.
There are few bandleaders in
the world who play the berimbau
and the caxixi, let alone a
life-sized statue of a human made
of cymbals, bells and shakers, but
Airto made vibrant music on all of
them last weekend at the Great
American Music Hall.
Airto's quintet, Fingers, plays
an exotic blend of South
American folk music and
American jazz, always focusing on
the infectious rhythms provided
by their Brazilian master

percussionist and leader. Whether
flailing away on drums or singing
exuberant scat vocals or playing
something from his legendary
collection of rattles, bells and
anything else that makes a sound,
Airto gives the music its unique
flavor.
Fingers features a front line of
Raul, another Brazilian, on bass
trombone, Barry Finnerty on
guitar, and Mike Wolf on electric
piano, with Charles Fambrough's
bass aiding a powerful bottom to
the rhythmic concoctions.
Finnerty was particularly

impressive, stating most of the
themes with his soft, fluid runs.
Raul played very well on his
difficult instrument, with a fine,
understated solo on Antonio
