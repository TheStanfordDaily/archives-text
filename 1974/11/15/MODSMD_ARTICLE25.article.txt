## Sex Spoof: Funny But Only Soft-Core 
### George Powell 
Cute as it sounds, Flesh
Gordon is not Airport '75 dosed
with Spanish fly, as newspaper ads
maintain. It's more like watching
The Golden Voyage of Sinbad
after a hit from a big blue condom
mled with nitrous oxide.
Is Flesh Gordon as funny as
laughing gas? No. It begins where
Barbarella left off as fantasy, and
succeeds as a fairly
straight-forward sexual spoof of
old Saturday afternoon serials and
Monster movies. The special
effects are generally excellent,
combining the obvious fakery of
the old Flash Gordon serials with
the more realistic effects of Ray
Harryhausen (who did the special
effects for The Golden Voyage of
Minbad and a host of similar films).
However, the sex scenes are
strictly soft-core, i.e., there are no
close-ups of anybody actually
doing it, and Flesh Gordon is
actually a lesser movie for it. This
may be the first movie that
fxtended explicit sex scenes might
ave aided the continuity, rather
than become just another ho-hum,
w hat-else-can- wedo-to-pad-the-plot
device.
Like a vibrator without
batteries, Flesh Gordon as an
erotic film doesn't work, and
%stead of the first erotic, campy,
funny monster movie, what's left
is little more than a hyped-up
Saturday serial, connected in
herkey-jerky fashion with some
truncated sex scenes.
The scenes that are complete,
Khough, are good fun and
shouldn't be missed by anyone
who was a fan of those old serials
and super heroes. A brief plot
synopsis should give potential
viewers an idea of the type of
humor in the movie, which, as
jsou may have surmised, is rooted
almost totally in sex.
Earth, sometime in the 19305,
has been attacked by a mysterious
sex ray from outer space, which
makes people "love to do it all the
time." Flesh Gordon and Dale
Ardor are on an airplane that's hit
the ray. Bailing out when the
pilots get tremendous hard-ons
and begin to ravish the passengers,
Flesh and Dale land near the
house of Dr. Flexi Jerkoff, who
has a space ship which can fly to

the planet Porno, from which the
evil ray emanates.
Some of the best scenes of the"
movie are aboard Jerkoff's ship,
which is started with a
Volkswagen key and steered like a
cable car (complete with bell).
Naturally the sex ray hits the ship,
it crashes on Porno, where the evil
Wang (who sounds like an
effeminate Fu Manchu and looks
like a bad female impersonation
of the Dowager Empress) captures
them and then lusts after the
nubile Dale Ardor.
This could go on and on. Who
can forget the copulating court of
Wang, the attack of the
penisaurouses, the gay,
Robin-Hood-like figure of Prince

Precious, Dale's initiation into a
tribe of Amazonian dykes and the
attack of the giant mincing
monster.
Any further summary would
spoil the show for those who
haven't seen it. Don't look for
much in the way of stimulating
sex scenes, but do look for an
excessive amount of erotic
imagination, puns and loony
special effects.
The film may be stretching
things a bit when the mincing
monster does what King Kong
always wanted to do, ripping
Ardor's dress off because, as the
monster says, "I want to look at
your tits." If it's not Dale's
clothes, it's Flesh's that are being
ripped off, with more time spent

J
in clothes ripping than actual sex,
but that's just a function of the
way the movie was edited.
It's difficult to edit a funny,
sexy hard core movie into a sexy,
funny soft-core movie when much
of the humor is embellished in the
omitted hard-core footage. What's
left is funny, but seems cluttered
and rushed.
However, let's get one thing
perfectly straight. With all its
faults, Flesh Gordon is still a
better movie than the first X-rated
musical, Can Heironymus Merkin
Ever Forget Mercy Humpe and
Find True Happiness? And that's
saying a mouthful.
"Flesh Gordon," rated X, is
currently playing at the Bijou
Theater in Palo Alto.
