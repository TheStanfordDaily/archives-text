# 'Cyrano' A Pleasure
## 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
One wonders why a premier
repertory company such as ACT,
whose forte is a diverse repertoire
of dramatic literature from all
over the world, presents the same
play three years in succession.
One wonders, that is, until the
opening curtain of William Ball's
production of Cyrano de
Bergerac. Its spell is irresistable,
its mood warm and vibrant, its
legendary hero uplifting.
Edmond Rostand's classic
heroic comedy, written in 1897, is
proof that romanticism can still
work in the theatre. Indeed,
romanticism so wonderfully
captured can strike a chord of
idealism in one's innermost heart.
Cyrano, infamous nose and all,
is a hero by virtue of his
swashbuckling swordplay and
dazzling wit alike. He handily
thwarts an evil adversary with his
blade while composing a ballad
"and with the refrain, thrust
homy." But it is his incessant
pursuit of the ideal in all that he
does, his adamant refusal to
compromise his lofty principles,
that captures our imagination. He
is the philosopher's Superman.
Cyrano challenges the cliche.
Take, for example, "The pen is
mightier than the sword."
Cyrano's purge of the bombastic
excesses of the theatre of
Montfleury by the sword would
make any critic wonder about the
relative efficacy of his weapon.
Misleading Surface
Cyrano's flamboyance,
courage, prideful arrogance and
elan make him the very
quintessence of "panache." But
we arg moved because he is,
beneath all the swagger, also very
tender. The love he bears for the
beautiful Roxane is pure and
self-sacrificing. We are devastated
by the poignancy of his
unrequited love, only to be
rescued by Cyrano's irrepressible
idealism and "panache" his
"white plume."
Director William Ball's
production is a visual masterpiece.

Ball parallels the contrast between
the swashbuckling public Cyrano
and the tender and sensitive
private Cyrano in the very first
scene.
The boisterous, colorful
pandemonium of the crowd at the
Theatre de Bourgogne freezes and
the spotlights turn to the intimate
feelings of the principle
characters. Ball makes striking use
of tableau throughout. Each scene
is ended with a live "picture"
which summarizes the scene. Ball
has painted with vivid, confident
and brilliant brush strokes.
Technically Great
All of the technical aspects of
this production enhance this
conception; grand costumes,
simple and artistically economical
sets and complementary lights and
music are superbly integrated
until one can feel the pure
romanticism in the air.
The cast is significantly
changed from last year's
production. Ray Reinhardt has
taken over the title role
admirably, and his performance is
reason enough for last year's

Cyrano patrons to repeat.
ReinHardt's performance is
infused with warmth throughout.
He is particularly adept at
revealing Cyrano's vulnerability as
well as his idealism. His mixture
of these elements is guaranteed to
bring tears to the eys of even the
most hardened cynic.
Stephen Schnetzer brings a
level of innocence and
three-dimensionality to the often
bland role of Christian. Earl
Boen's Le Bret is sensitive and
straightforward. Deborah May's
Roxane has shown remarkable
growth since last year. She has
encompassed the frivolous young
Roxane and the more soulful and
brave Roxane into a single human
being. Elizabeth Huddle's Duenna
is again a comic gem.
ACT's Cyrano is a rare treat of
exhilaration and inspiration. It is
a romanticized release from our
woes of the world, but it is also an
encouragement to share a little of
Cyrano's idealism. Cyrano is a
Don Quixote, but the windmills
he tilts with thrust him and us
up among the stars.

is a hero by virtue of his
swashbuckling swordplay and
dazzling wit alike. He handily
thwarts an evil adversary with his
blade while composing a ballad
"and with the refrain, thrust
homy." But it is his incessant
pursuit of the ideal in all that he
does, his adamant refusal to
compromise his lofty principles,
that captures our imagination. He
is the philosopher's Superman.
Cyrano challenges the cliche.
Take, for example, "The pen is
mightier than the sword."
Cyrano's purge of the bombastic
excesses of the theatre of
Montfleury by the sword would
make any critic wonder about the
relative efficacy of his weapon.
Misleading Surface
Cyrano's flamboyance,
courage, prideful arrogance and
elan make him the very
quintessence of "panache." But
we arg moved because he is,
beneath all the swagger, also very
tender. The love he bears for the
beautiful Roxane is pure and
self-sacrificing. We are devastated
by the poignancy of his
unrequited love, only to be
rescued by Cyrano's irrepressible
idealism and "panache" his
"white plume."
Director William Ball's
production is a visual masterpiece.

Ball parallels the contrast between
the swashbuckling public Cyrano
and the tender and sensitive
private Cyrano in the very first
scene.
The boisterous, colorful
pandemonium of the crowd at the
Theatre de Bourgogne freezes and
the spotlights turn to the intimate
feelings of the principle
characters. Ball makes striking use
of tableau throughout. Each scene
is ended with a live "picture"
which summarizes the scene. Ball
has painted with vivid, confident
and brilliant brush strokes.
Technically Great
All of the technical aspects of
this production enhance this
conception; grand costumes,
simple and artistically economical
sets and complementary lights and
music are superbly integrated
until one can feel the pure
romanticism in the air.
The cast is significantly
changed from last year's
production. Ray Reinhardt has
taken over the title role
admirably, and his performance is
reason enough for last year's

Cyrano patrons to repeat.
ReinHardt's performance is
infused with warmth throughout.
He is particularly adept at
revealing Cyrano's vulnerability as
well as his idealism. His mixture
of these elements is guaranteed to
bring tears to the eys of even the
most hardened cynic.
Stephen Schnetzer brings a
level of innocence and
three-dimensionality to the often
bland role of Christian. Earl
Boen's Le Bret is sensitive and
straightforward. Deborah May's
Roxane has shown remarkable
growth since last year. She has
encompassed the frivolous young
Roxane and the more soulful and
brave Roxane into a single human
being. Elizabeth Huddle's Duenna
is again a comic gem.
ACT's Cyrano is a rare treat of
exhilaration and inspiration. It is
a romanticized release from our
woes of the world, but it is also an
encouragement to share a little of
Cyrano's idealism. Cyrano is a
Don Quixote, but the windmills
he tilts with thrust him and us
up among the stars.
One wonders why a premier
repertory company such as ACT,
whose forte is a diverse repertoire
of dramatic literature from all
over the world, presents the same
play three years in succession.
One wonders, that is, until the
opening curtain of William Ball's
production of Cyrano de
Bergerac. Its spell is irresistable,
its mood warm and vibrant, its
legendary hero uplifting.
Edmond Rostand's classic
heroic comedy, written in 1897, is
proof that romanticism can still
work in the theatre. Indeed,
romanticism so wonderfully
captured can strike a chord of
idealism in one's innermost heart.
Cyrano, infamous nose and all,
is a hero by virtue of his
swashbuckling swordplay and
dazzling wit alike. He handily
thwarts an evil adversary with his
blade while composing a ballad
"and with the refrain, thrust
