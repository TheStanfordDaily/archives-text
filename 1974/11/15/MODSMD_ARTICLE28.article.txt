# IM Roundup
## Steele Leads Biz IIA Romp 
### PETE BHATIA 
Biz II A, last year's football 'A'
division runnerup, itself
as a prime title contender
yesterday by thrashing
once-beaten Phi Delta Theta 45-0
in a quarterfinal tilt.
The Biz II team, seeded second
behind defending champion Zeta
Psi, used a little rugby, some
fierce hitting and the incredibly
sharp passing arm of quarterback
Gary Steele to earn the victory.
Steele was hitting his receivers
in bad spots all day, namely their
hands, but they were holding on
to the ball, unlike another
football team in the area. Top
receivers yesterday for Biz were
Marty o'Donahue and rugby
player Larry Lieberman.
Biz ll's offense is an amazing
mixture of standard IM
football-type plays, such as simple
outs and crosses, mixed with
four-man screens, blocking back
releases and even a variation of
the triple option.
In the semis, set for early next
week, Biz II will meet the winner
of today's 2:30 game between
third-seeded Theta Delta Chi and
sixth seeded Kappa Alpha. The
Theta Delts edged the Wildmen, a
law school team, 26-19 in their
playoff opener Tuesday.
In that wild one, almost the
entire second half was played in
the" dark. Only a diving last
minute interception by Theta Delt
Rob Spitzer prevented the game
from going into overtime.
The KA's had an easier time of

it, with a 32-14 romp over
independent Burbank '74. KA
quarterback Curtis Dubost teamed
with receiver Bill Ross to account
for most of the KA offense.
Both teams bring good records
into the game. The Theta Delts
are 6-1, with their only defeat at
the hands of the top-seeded Zetes,
25-12. The only mar on the KA
record was a 13-13 tie with the
improving Delts.
And speaking of the Delts,
they, under the leadership of
quarterback John Carroll, upset
the fourth-seeded JRA team 9-7 in a

first-round tournament game. The
Delts' meet Biz I, a one-point
winner over the Melatrons, in
another quarterfinal match today.
In the other quarterfinal game,
the Zetes meet SAE.
In the 'B' division, the top four
seeds all won in the first found.
The top seeded and defending
champion Zetes had a tough time
before beating Serra 20-6. The
second seeded KA team has won
two playoff games thus far, 24-18
over the Wasted Parrots (yes,
that's really their name) and 32-0
over the Dekes.
