# Attacking SJS Edges Hockey Team
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
"It was the best game I've ever played," said
senior fullback Susy Schatzman. The same can be
said about goalie Betsy Morris and the rest of this
year's Stanford field hockey team.
But their best simply wasn't good enough as San
Jose State overpowered the Cards 3-2 yesterday.
SJS finishes the year with a 4 1 league mark, the
Cardinals are now officially 5-2.
The Spartan offense proved the deciding factor
in the game. SJS put tremendous pressure on the
goal when it was on the attack and only the
play of Morris kept the game from turning into a
rout during the first half.
The Stanford offense, on the other hand, never
did get untracked. Whenever the Cards threatened
to score, either the Spartan goalie or the defense in
front of her managed to break up the play. The
game was tied 1-1 at halftime only by virtue of a
very long, hard shot by Janell Edman.
In the second half, SJS slowly pulled away,
taking a 3-1 lead with 10 minutes left. The Cards
staged a brief rally culminating in Kathy Levinson's

goal with three minutes left, but it was too little
and too late.
Stanford's junior varsity battled to a scoreless tie
with its SJS counterpart. Each team had several
opportunities to score. Stanford often lost the ball
on violations, including several times in almost
certain scoring situations. In general, however, the
defenses of both teams, especially goalkeeping,
were far superior to the offenses.
The Cards have now completed their conference
schedule with a 5-2 record unless their rematch
with Cal State-Humboldt on Nov. 23 counts as a
conference game. Stanford coach Shirley Schoof
protested the first game between the two teams,
which the Cards lost 3-2. The protest has yet to be
ruled on.
Tomorrow morning, Stanford plays Simon
Frazier University from Vancouver, 8.C., at 10:30
a.m. on the field outside Roble gym.
The winner of that game will play the Pacific
Southwest All-Star team No. 1 at 1:30 on the same
field and the loser will play the No. 2 PSW team,
also at 1:30.
