# Financial Managers Question Co-op Plan
## 
### ROSARIO DE LA TORRE 
Tom Fitzgerald, assistant to ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri,
yesterday expressed concern about the
"economic soundness" of the
proposed Record Co-op.
"They have expectations of
increasing gross sales from the $41,000
the Bookstore now has, to $54,000. I
don't think the demand is that great,"
he explained.
According to the projected figures,
the co-op must have $54,000 in sales
for the first accounting year to break
even. The authors of the proposal,
ASSU Vice Presidents Leonard
Mackey and Ann Carter and
undergraduate Lance Friedmann,
expect $61,000 in sales for a profit of
$lOOO for the first year.
"Under this proposal, it will take
14 to 15 years to pay back the
assessment," Olivieri noted.
Break-Even Point
To break even, the co-op will have
to sell 30 percent more records than

the Bookstore now sells. Fitzgerald is
not convinced that the market exists
for increased record sales. "They think
they are going to sell another 3000
records just by dropping the price 10
cents," Fitzgerald explained.
Under the proposal, records will sell
for $4.39. 11 cents less than the
current Bookstore price. One out of
every five records will be at a lower
"sale" price.
Olivieri stressed that students won't
get their $1 investment back in price
savings after two records. "A student
will have to buy nine records at the
regular price to save $l," he explained.
"If the Stanford Record Co-op wins
its fee assessment, the margin by
which it' passes will be an indicator of
the co-op's chances of success,"
Fitzgerald said.
"Very Good Chances"
"If the Record Co-op fee
assessment passes by a significant
percentage, the chances are very good
that it will be successful," he added.
"The reason I am concerned about
the future of the co-op is that there
has not been a market survey to
determine the demand for records. I
am not sure if there is enough interest
to support a $50,000 to $60,000
investment in a record co-op,"
Fitzgerald said.
Fitzgerald is also concerned that if
the fee assessment is passed, the co-op
may only be able to use 80 percent of
the money.
"Since all ASSU assessments are
refundable, refunds to students may
amount to 20 percent of the
assessment," Fitzgerald noted.
Prices May Go Up
Another possible problem is that
increasing costs may force the co-op to
raise its prices or lose profits. "For
example, gas prices may go up in the
next six months, raising the
transportation costs for the records,"
Fitzgerald explained.
"If the fee assessment passes by a
substantial margin, I will be optimistic
about the future of the Co-op,"
Fitzgerald said.
"If the co-op makes money, the
record buyers are subsidizing
themselves; if the co-op loses money,
then it's going to end up being the
student body subsidizing the record
buyers," Fitzgerald elaborated.
Mackey agreed with Fitzgerald that
the results of the election will be a
good indicator of interest in the co-op.
"If students vote for the assessment it
indicates that people will go out and
buy records," Mackey said.
No Survey
Mackey conceded that no market
survey was conducted. "We looked
into the possibility of one, but it
would have cost too much," he said.
Mackey continued, "We can start
with eight to nine thousand dollars, 70
percent of the assessment. Start-up
costs will be spread out over a period
of time."

RECORD CO-OPâ€”ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri discussed the pros
Mid cons of the proposed record co-op yesterday. "What students have to decide
is if they are quite willing to shell out a dollar for a 10 cent break," he said.
