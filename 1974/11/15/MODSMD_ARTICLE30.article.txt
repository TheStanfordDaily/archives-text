## Whoopee! Cards Play At Oregon 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
We're playing the worst team
in the league.
Nobody's going to be in the
stands.
We're not going to any Rose
Bowl.
It's probably gonna rain.
It's Oregon week.
Blaaaaaaahhh!
Pardon the cynicism, but it's a
little hard to get excited about the
trip to Eugene to play the Oregon
Ducks at 1:30 tomorrow (KSFO,
560).
This game, just like last year, is
sandwiched between the end of
the real season (USC) and the real
end of season (Cal).
And if it's like last season,
there won't be much emotion on
the part of the Stanford players.
Best Happenings
Really, what's the best that
could happen up in Eugene?
The whole team could get laid,
maybe.
Or Stanford could win real big
and have the quarterback question
settled forever.
There's about as much chance
of one as the other.
At any rate, Stanford will be
without defensive end . Roger
St ill well, who's fighting
pneumonia.
And as the quarterback
situation now stands, it'll be Mike
Cordova in the starter's role and
Guy Benjamin in reserve, despite
all the flak coach Jack
Christiansen has been getting
about his choice.
Well, let's turn attention to
Oregon, which has a football
program everyone's cynical about.
Calamities
The Ducks are now 2-7, 0-5 in

league play. The team should have
been better than that except for a
series of calamities.
Don Read took over the head
coaching job this season with five
fine players, only two of whom
are left.
Quarterback Herb Singleton
broke his wrist.
All-Coast tight end Russ
Francis flunked out of school.
All-Coast defensive lineman
Reggie Lewis got kicked off the
squad after he missed a couple
practices.
That leaves two. An explosive
tailback named Don Reynolds
(who hasn't carried the ball that
much this season) and a very good
safety named Steve Donnelly.
You remember Donnelly. He
apparently intercepted a Mike
Boryla pass in the endzone last
season, in the Ducks' 21-7 loss to
Stanford, but had it stolen from
him by Bill Singler for a Stanford
TD.
Other than those two, there are
few names on the Oregon roster
that draw much more than blank
stares.
One is Rick Kane, a "dive"
back in Read's Veer offense
(Reynolds is the "pitch" back, the
names describing what plays they
run in the triple-option.) Kane
starred against the Cardinals last
season, and is a tough 188-pound
runner.
The Ducks' quarterback,
Norval Turner, doesn't throw too
accurately (12 interceptions in
158 passes) but was expected to
run the veer well. But his total
rushing yardage of minus 84
doesn't indicate that he's the next
John Sciarra.
- Defensively, Oregon plays a
5-2, an anachronism in the Pacific
Eight, where most teams play the
3-4 because they have more good
linebackers than linemen.

This could leave the Ducks
vulnerable to short passes. The
defensive backfield is strong,
however, including Donnelly and
Mario White, who beat Stanford
two years ago with two fourth
quarter interceptions.
Teams which have beaten
Oregon this season have generally
worn the Ducks down in the
second half, as the team has little
depth. A notable exception was
USC, which won only 16-7 up in
Eugene against a stubborn
defensive unit.
Very few fans will be in the
stands. Eveni for Homecoming,
Oregon (a school that goes beserk
for basketball) got only between

15,000 and 21,500 fans,
depending on whose count you
believe.
Those hardy souls who will be
present at Autzen Stadium,
according to the Oregon Daily
Emerald, have enough alcohol in
their systems to "power a Mack
truck from Eugene to the
California border."
Popular drinks, the paper says,
include several varieties of
bourbon, Red Mountain, peach
brandy, Annie Green Springs and
151 proof Puerto Rican rum "that
will flame with a match."
Maybe the place will burn
down and there'll be something
exciting to report after all.

PLAY OF THE YEAR—Oregon safety Steve Donnelly is probably looking for revenge after Bill Singler
(21) made him look stupid on this play last season. Donnelly, as shown, apparently intercepted Mike
Boryla's pass in the end zone, but Singler wrestled it away from him for Stanford's first touchdown. From
that point on, it was all Stanford, as the Cards beat Oregon 21-7.

runner.
The Ducks' quarterback,
Norval Turner, doesn't throw too
accurately (12 interceptions in
158 passes) but was expected to
run the veer well. But his total
rushing yardage of minus 84
doesn't indicate that he's the next
John Sciarra.
- Defensively, Oregon plays a
5-2, an anachronism in the Pacific
Eight, where most teams play the
3-4 because they have more good
linebackers than linemen.

This could leave the Ducks
vulnerable to short passes. The
defensive backfield is strong,
however, including Donnelly and
Mario White, who beat Stanford
two years ago with two fourth
quarter interceptions.
Teams which have beaten
Oregon this season have generally
worn the Ducks down in the
second half, as the team has little
depth. A notable exception was
USC, which won only 16-7 up in
Eugene against a stubborn
defensive unit.
Very few fans will be in the
stands. Eveni for Homecoming,
Oregon (a school that goes beserk
for basketball) got only between

15,000 and 21,500 fans,
depending on whose count you
believe.
Those hardy souls who will be
present at Autzen Stadium,
according to the Oregon Daily
Emerald, have enough alcohol in
their systems to "power a Mack
truck from Eugene to the
California border."
Popular drinks, the paper says,
include several varieties of
bourbon, Red Mountain, peach
brandy, Annie Green Springs and
151 proof Puerto Rican rum "that
will flame with a match."
Maybe the place will burn
down and there'll be something
exciting to report after all.

PLAY OF THE YEAR—Oregon safety Steve Donnelly is probably looking for revenge after Bill Singler
(21) made him look stupid on this play last season. Donnelly, as shown, apparently intercepted Mike
Boryla's pass in the end zone, but Singler wrestled it away from him for Stanford's first touchdown. From
that point on, it was all Stanford, as the Cards beat Oregon 21-7.
We're playing the worst team
in the league.
Nobody's going to be in the
stands.
We're not going to any Rose
Bowl.
It's probably gonna rain.
It's Oregon week.
Blaaaaaaahhh!
Pardon the cynicism, but it's a
little hard to get excited about the
trip to Eugene to play the Oregon
Ducks at 1:30 tomorrow (KSFO,
560).
This game, just like last year, is
sandwiched between the end of
the real season (USC) and the real
end of season (Cal).
And if it's like last season,
there won't be much emotion on
the part of the Stanford players.
Best Happenings
Really, what's the best that
could happen up in Eugene?
The whole team could get laid,
maybe.
Or Stanford could win real big
and have the quarterback question
settled forever.
There's about as much chance
of one as the other.
At any rate, Stanford will be
without defensive end . Roger
St ill well, who's fighting
pneumonia.
And as the quarterback
situation now stands, it'll be Mike
Cordova in the starter's role and
Guy Benjamin in reserve, despite
all the flak coach Jack
Christiansen has been getting
about his choice.
Well, let's turn attention to
Oregon, which has a football
program everyone's cynical about.
Calamities
The Ducks are now 2-7, 0-5 in

league play. The team should have
been better than that except for a
series of calamities.
Don Read took over the head
coaching job this season with five
fine players, only two of whom
are left.
Quarterback Herb Singleton
broke his wrist.
All-Coast tight end Russ
Francis flunked out of school.
All-Coast defensive lineman
Reggie Lewis got kicked off the
squad after he missed a couple
practices.
That leaves two. An explosive
tailback named Don Reynolds
(who hasn't carried the ball that
much this season) and a very good
safety named Steve Donnelly.
You remember Donnelly. He
apparently intercepted a Mike
Boryla pass in the endzone last
season, in the Ducks' 21-7 loss to
Stanford, but had it stolen from
him by Bill Singler for a Stanford
TD.
Other than those two, there are
few names on the Oregon roster
that draw much more than blank
stares.
One is Rick Kane, a "dive"
back in Read's Veer offense
(Reynolds is the "pitch" back, the
names describing what plays they
run in the triple-option.) Kane
starred against the Cardinals last
season, and is a tough 188-pound
runner.

there won't be much emotion on
the part of the Stanford players.
Best Happenings
Really, what's the best that
could happen up in Eugene?
The whole team could get laid,
maybe.
Or Stanford could win real big
and have the quarterback question
settled forever.
There's about as much chance
of one as the other.
At any rate, Stanford will be
without defensive end . Roger
St ill well, who's fighting
pneumonia.
And as the quarterback
situation now stands, it'll be Mike
Cordova in the starter's role and
Guy Benjamin in reserve, despite
all the flak coach Jack
Christiansen has been getting
about his choice.
Well, let's turn attention to
Oregon, which has a football
program everyone's cynical about.
Calamities
The Ducks are now 2-7, 0-5 in

league play. The team should have
been better than that except for a
series of calamities.
Don Read took over the head
coaching job this season with five
fine players, only two of whom
are left.
Quarterback Herb Singleton
broke his wrist.
All-Coast tight end Russ
Francis flunked out of school.
All-Coast defensive lineman
Reggie Lewis got kicked off the
squad after he missed a couple
practices.
That leaves two. An explosive
tailback named Don Reynolds
(who hasn't carried the ball that
much this season) and a very good
safety named Steve Donnelly.
You remember Donnelly. He
apparently intercepted a Mike
Boryla pass in the endzone last
season, in the Ducks' 21-7 loss to
Stanford, but had it stolen from
him by Bill Singler for a Stanford
TD.
Other than those two, there are
few names on the Oregon roster
that draw much more than blank
stares.
One is Rick Kane, a "dive"
back in Read's Veer offense
(Reynolds is the "pitch" back, the
names describing what plays they
run in the triple-option.) Kane
starred against the Cardinals last
season, and is a tough 188-pound
runner.
The Ducks' quarterback,
Norval Turner, doesn't throw too
accurately (12 interceptions in
158 passes) but was expected to
run the veer well. But his total
rushing yardage of minus 84
doesn't indicate that he's the next
John Sciarra.
- Defensively, Oregon plays a
5-2, an anachronism in the Pacific
Eight, where most teams play the
3-4 because they have more good
linebackers than linemen.

This could leave the Ducks
vulnerable to short passes. The
defensive backfield is strong,
however, including Donnelly and
Mario White, who beat Stanford
two years ago with two fourth
quarter interceptions.
Teams which have beaten
Oregon this season have generally
worn the Ducks down in the
second half, as the team has little
depth. A notable exception was
USC, which won only 16-7 up in
Eugene against a stubborn
defensive unit.
Very few fans will be in the
stands. Eveni for Homecoming,
Oregon (a school that goes beserk
for basketball) got only between

15,000 and 21,500 fans,
depending on whose count you
believe.
Those hardy souls who will be
present at Autzen Stadium,
according to the Oregon Daily
Emerald, have enough alcohol in
their systems to "power a Mack
truck from Eugene to the
California border."
Popular drinks, the paper says,
include several varieties of
bourbon, Red Mountain, peach
brandy, Annie Green Springs and
151 proof Puerto Rican rum "that
will flame with a match."
Maybe the place will burn
down and there'll be something
exciting to report after all.

PLAY OF THE YEAR—Oregon safety Steve Donnelly is probably looking for revenge after Bill Singler
(21) made him look stupid on this play last season. Donnelly, as shown, apparently intercepted Mike
Boryla's pass in the end zone, but Singler wrestled it away from him for Stanford's first touchdown. From
that point on, it was all Stanford, as the Cards beat Oregon 21-7.
We're playing the worst team
in the league.
Nobody's going to be in the
stands.
We're not going to any Rose
Bowl.
It's probably gonna rain.
It's Oregon week.
Blaaaaaaahhh!
Pardon the cynicism, but it's a
little hard to get excited about the
trip to Eugene to play the Oregon
Ducks at 1:30 tomorrow (KSFO,
560).
This game, just like last year, is
sandwiched between the end of
the real season (USC) and the real
end of season (Cal).
And if it's like last season,
there won't be much emotion on
the part of the Stanford players.
