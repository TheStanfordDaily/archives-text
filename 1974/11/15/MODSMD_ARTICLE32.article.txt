# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
It's another one of those
weeks in the Pacific Eight
conference, one in which the
four California schools are
favored to crush the four
Northwest teams.
But our fearful forecaster,
his record now diminished to a
fair 25-7-3, doesn't want to
pick all the favorites
especially when one of them is
bound to lose.
So our upset special pick
this week is Oregon State over
UCLA. Despite the Bruins'
better record, the team has not
played quite as well as OSU in
recent weeks.
Otherwise, it looks good for
the favorites. California has
proven it's for real the past two
weeks, though it could have
folded after the UCLA loss.
The Bears have enough aerie/
power to get by Washington
State.

Everyone's talking up Steve
Bartkowski as All-American,
but Bart won't have a chance
of getting past Michigan's
Dennis Franklin if the Bears
don't win this one
convincingly.
USC plays host to
Washington. The Huskies are so
hot-and-cold they could jump
out to a big lead, but the
Trojans, as proven last week,
are a much stronger team.
Finally, our Cardinals play
up at Eugene, in a game that
doesn't figure to raise much
excitement. Look for Stanford
to put on a second-half charge
(very likely under Guy
Benjamin) to win.
Predictions
Oregon State 24, UCLA 20
California 31, WSU 16
USC 28, Washington 14
