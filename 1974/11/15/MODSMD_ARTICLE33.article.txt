# Two Pac-8 Championships Here This Weekend
## Runners Seek Third Behind Oregon, WSU 
### MIKE SHEPHARD 
Hoping for a third-place finish
and subsequent trip to the
NCAAs, Stanford will host the
Pacific Eight Cross Country
Championship tomorrow. The
meet will be held on the Stanford
Golf Course beginning at 11 a.m.
Cardinal coach Marshall Clark
has entered an eight-man team,
including Southern Division
champ Tony Sandoval. "Sandy,"
who holds the all-time Stanford
record for six miles (28:56.6), will
be joined by captain Mark
McConnell and juryor Jack Bellah.
McConnell and Bellah finished
third and sixth respectively in the
Southern Division meet. These
three have been the Cards' top
runners all season.
Rounding out the squad will be
juniors Art Brown and Doug
McLean, and sophs Jeff Parietti,
Frank Boutin and Steve Crowley.
Oregon, the defending
champion, is pre-meet favorite.
The Ducks are led by senior Paul
Geis. Geis, the national collegiate
track three-mile champ, is seen as
the Ducks' successor to all-time
great Steve Prefontaine.
Washington State, led by
veterans John Ngeno and Dan
Murphy, should provide a strong
challenge. Ngeno is this year's
collegiate champ at six miles.
The top two teams qualify for
the NCAA meet later this month
at Bloomington, Ind. The third
place team is generally invited as
the "at large" Western
representative, Stanford will be
shooting for this spot, as will Cal
and the other two Northern
schools.
Clark is optimistic about
Sandoval's chances. "Tony should
be very competitive with the
leaders despite a leg problem. As a
team, we're hoping for the best."
This will mark the second
consecutive year that Stanford has
hosted the meet.
Last November, approximately
2000 fans turned out in the rain
to see Prefontaine cut almost 30
seconds off the course record,
covering the six-mile loop in
28:05.4.

champion, is pre-meet favorite.
The Ducks are led by senior Paul
Geis. Geis, the national collegiate
track three-mile champ, is seen as
the Ducks' successor to all-time
great Steve Prefontaine.
Washington State, led by
veterans John Ngeno and Dan
Murphy, should provide a strong
challenge. Ngeno is this year's
collegiate champ at six miles.
The top two teams qualify for
the NCAA meet later this month
at Bloomington, Ind. The third
place team is generally invited as
the "at large" Western
representative, Stanford will be
shooting for this spot, as will Cal
and the other two Northern
schools.
Clark is optimistic about
Sandoval's chances. "Tony should
be very competitive with the
leaders despite a leg problem. As a
team, we're hoping for the best."
This will mark the second
consecutive year that Stanford has
hosted the meet.
Last November, approximately
2000 fans turned out in the rain
to see Prefontaine cut almost 30
seconds off the course record,
covering the six-mile loop in
28:05.4.
