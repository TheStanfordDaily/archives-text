# JV Poloists Conclude Season
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The Stanford aquatic program
is in full swing this year. The
water polo team is headed for an
NCAA championship tourney, the
women swimmers are preparing
for their third straight NCI AC
championship and a host of
talent insures another fine swim
season for coach Jim Gaughran's
troops.
In the midst of all the poolside
ejyntement, Stanford's JV water
polo team has been forced to play
in relative obscurity. This
afternoon, the JV squad winds up
its campaign seeking its eighth win
against five losses, as the Cards
take on the Cal JV in Berkeley.
A young and inexperienced
team at the opening of the season,
the Card JV's, under the
direction of coach Peter Snyder,
have made giant strides. "We
could easily beat a lot of the
teams we lost to at the beginning
of the year if we could play them
again now," says Snyder.
The 22-year-old coach, who
starred for the Card polo team as
a senior last year, will be coaching
again next year. He hopes to be
enrolled in the STEP program in
the School of Education. If all

goes well, Pete will someday
coach "at any level, high school,
junior college or college."
Varsity mentor Art Lambert
praises Snyder for doing "such a
great job" and believes he should
make coaching a career. "He's got
a real feel for it," says Lambert.
Snyder has found coaching
quite a challenge. With so many
individuals, "It's tough to know
how to handle each personality,"
he said.
The team itself has done well.
Like the varsity, the JV is a
well-conditioned ball club, relying
on speed and stamina to win. Two
of the stars, Marty Davis and Ken
Favaro, were elevated last week to

Lambert's varsity ranks, where
they will be expected to
contribute heavily next year.
The loss of the two freshmen
forces the rest of the team to pick
up the slack. Snyder looks for
Larry Scarborough to lead the
way, as well as Dave Shapiro,
who's "played steadily all year"
according to Snyder. Sophomore
Ed Geary and goalie Dave Burke
have also contributed to the
Cardinal cause.
Hopefully, next year many
more of the faces of the JV
players seen around the pool will
become familiar figures to
followers of Stanford's varsity
water polo team.
