# Booters Get Second Chance
## 
### DAN PYNE 
If anyone ever had a second
chance, the Stanford soccer team
has one this morning.
After stumbling to a 7-8-3
season, the Cardinals have a
chance to prove that pre-season
hopes were not hollow in the first
round of the Stanford Invitational
(Pac-8) tournament at 10 a.m.
The booters play Washington,
ninth ranked in the West and
unofficially second-ranked in the
tournament behind nationally
ranked UCLA.
But (alas) even if the Cardinals
lose to Washington, there is still a
chance they can win the
tournament, and even if they
don't win the tournament there
will still be a lot of excellent
college soccer displayed on the
Harry Maloney soccer field today
and tomorrow.
Bob DiGrazia, soccer coach at
Cal and the tournament director,
explains that, the tournament
"started last spring as a simple
idea to get the Pac-8 coaches
together to discuss the
possibilities for inter-school play.
We decided that Stanford was the

perfect spot for a tournament,
found some sponsors and
everything sort of fit together."
First Of Its Kind
Dick Berg, general manager of
the San Jose Earthquakes
professional soccer team, called
the tournament "the first of its
kind, and certainly a step forward
in the area of college soccer.
"College soccer has come a
long way; further even than
professional soccer in many
ways." The Earthquakes will play
an exhibition game at halftime of
the championship game
tomorrow.
Stanford head coach Fred
Priddle added that the event is
good indication of the growth of
soccer within the Pac-8. Priddle
has worked closely with Di Grazia
in planning the tournament.
The other game at 10 a.m.
today will have USC playing
Oregon. At 11:30, Cal will play
Oregon State and UCLA will face
Washington State.
Odd Schedule
In the afternoon, four more
games will be played, and then
another four will be held
tomorrow morning. (The
scheduling is, needless to say,
somewhat odd.)
At any rate, every team will
play four games, with the
championship game tomorrow at
1:30 p.m.
Priddle said the draw was made
blindly, "from a hat," and admits
his team is a little miffed at
drawing Washington for the initial
game. "They're all mad at me."
If there is a drawback to the
tournament, it is that there is an
admission fee; $1 for adults, 50
cents for students and children.
Well Prepared
Stanford should go into the
tourney well-prepared, after
shellacking Menlo College 6-0
Wednesday. The Cards put on an
impressive offensive performance,
with 26 shots. Skip Pfeiffer led
the scoring with a
two-thirds-of-a-hat trick.
Stanford scored twice in the
first half. Mack Taylor took the

ball in unassisted for the first goal
at 20 minutes into the period, and
Charlie Hall made it 2-0 with a
penalty kick four minutes before
the end of the half.
At 22 minutes into the second
period Marty Glickfeld passed to
Robby Robb for Stanford's third
tally. Glickfeld scored 14 minutes
later on another penalty kick, and
then Pfeiffer put in two unassisted
shots before the game ended.
Bruce Mosbacher made eight
saves in the goal in netting his
fifth shutout of the season. Menlo
took 13 shots.
Priddle summed it up quite
simply, "We were really shooting
in there." The last time Stanford
faced Menlo the Cards scraped by
2-1.
And so another soccer season,
perhaps stranger than some, draws
to a close. The Cardinals play one
more game after the tournament,
against Notre Dame College Nov.

Kickers: Phil Wright is the
Card's leading scorer with 5 goals
and 1 assist. Robby Robb follows
with 4 goals, Mack Taylor has 3
goals and 3 assists, Marty
Glickfeld has 3 goals and 2 assists.
The biggest surprise of the
week was the JV's first victory of
the season, over the Menlo College
JV, 5-1. Stanford's John Rhodes
scored the only goal for Menlo.

the season, over the Menlo College
JV, 5-1. Stanford's John Rhodes
scored the only goal for Menlo.

HALL PASS—A study in soccer
concentration, Stanford fullback
Charlie Hall pushes the ball
downfield in Wednesday's 6-0
bombing of Menlo College. The
Cardinals, 7-8-3 for the season,
play Washington today in the
Pac-8 soccer tournament.
If anyone ever had a second
chance, the Stanford soccer team
has one this morning.
After stumbling to a 7-8-3
season, the Cardinals have a
chance to prove that pre-season
hopes were not hollow in the first
round of the Stanford Invitational
(Pac-8) tournament at 10 a.m.
The booters play Washington,
ninth ranked in the West and
unofficially second-ranked in the
tournament behind nationally
ranked UCLA.
But (alas) even if the Cardinals
lose to Washington, there is still a
chance they can win the
tournament, and even if they
don't win the tournament there
will still be a lot of excellent
college soccer displayed on the
Harry Maloney soccer field today
and tomorrow.
Bob DiGrazia, soccer coach at
Cal and the tournament director,
explains that, the tournament
"started last spring as a simple
idea to get the Pac-8 coaches
together to discuss the
possibilities for inter-school play.
We decided that Stanford was the

perfect spot for a tournament,
found some sponsors and
everything sort of fit together."
First Of Its Kind
Dick Berg, general manager of
the San Jose Earthquakes
professional soccer team, called
the tournament "the first of its
kind, and certainly a step forward
in the area of college soccer.
"College soccer has come a
long way; further even than
professional soccer in many
ways." The Earthquakes will play
an exhibition game at halftime of
the championship game
tomorrow.
Stanford head coach Fred
Priddle added that the event is
good indication of the growth of
soccer within the Pac-8. Priddle
has worked closely with Di Grazia
in planning the tournament.
The other game at 10 a.m.
today will have USC playing
Oregon. At 11:30, Cal will play
Oregon State and UCLA will face
Washington State.
Odd Schedule
In the afternoon, four more
games will be played, and then
another four will be held
tomorrow morning. (The
scheduling is, needless to say,
somewhat odd.)
At any rate, every team will
play four games, with the
championship game tomorrow at
1:30 p.m.
Priddle said the draw was made
blindly, "from a hat," and admits
his team is a little miffed at
drawing Washington for the initial
game. "They're all mad at me."
If there is a drawback to the
tournament, it is that there is an
admission fee; $1 for adults, 50
cents for students and children.
Well Prepared
Stanford should go into the
tourney well-prepared, after
shellacking Menlo College 6-0
Wednesday. The Cards put on an
impressive offensive performance,
with 26 shots. Skip Pfeiffer led
the scoring with a
two-thirds-of-a-hat trick.
Stanford scored twice in the
first half. Mack Taylor took the

ball in unassisted for the first goal
at 20 minutes into the period, and
Charlie Hall made it 2-0 with a
penalty kick four minutes before
the end of the half.
At 22 minutes into the second
period Marty Glickfeld passed to
Robby Robb for Stanford's third
tally. Glickfeld scored 14 minutes
later on another penalty kick, and
then Pfeiffer put in two unassisted
shots before the game ended.
Bruce Mosbacher made eight
saves in the goal in netting his
fifth shutout of the season. Menlo
took 13 shots.
Priddle summed it up quite
simply, "We were really shooting
in there." The last time Stanford
faced Menlo the Cards scraped by
2-1.
And so another soccer season,
perhaps stranger than some, draws
to a close. The Cardinals play one
more game after the tournament,
against Notre Dame College Nov.

HALL PASS—A study in soccer
concentration, Stanford fullback
Charlie Hall pushes the ball
downfield in Wednesday's 6-0
bombing of Menlo College. The
Cardinals, 7-8-3 for the season,
play Washington today in the
Pac-8 soccer tournament.
If anyone ever had a second
chance, the Stanford soccer team
has one this morning.
After stumbling to a 7-8-3
season, the Cardinals have a
chance to prove that pre-season
hopes were not hollow in the first
round of the Stanford Invitational
(Pac-8) tournament at 10 a.m.
The booters play Washington,
ninth ranked in the West and
unofficially second-ranked in the
tournament behind nationally
ranked UCLA.
But (alas) even if the Cardinals
lose to Washington, there is still a
chance they can win the
tournament, and even if they
don't win the tournament there
will still be a lot of excellent
college soccer displayed on the
Harry Maloney soccer field today
and tomorrow.
Bob DiGrazia, soccer coach at
Cal and the tournament director,
explains that, the tournament
"started last spring as a simple
idea to get the Pac-8 coaches
together to discuss the
possibilities for inter-school play.
We decided that Stanford was the

perfect spot for a tournament,
found some sponsors and
everything sort of fit together."
First Of Its Kind
Dick Berg, general manager of
the San Jose Earthquakes
professional soccer team, called
the tournament "the first of its
kind, and certainly a step forward
in the area of college soccer.
"College soccer has come a
long way; further even than
professional soccer in many
ways." The Earthquakes will play
an exhibition game at halftime of
the championship game
tomorrow.
Stanford head coach Fred
Priddle added that the event is
good indication of the growth of
soccer within the Pac-8. Priddle
has worked closely with Di Grazia
in planning the tournament.
The other game at 10 a.m.
today will have USC playing
Oregon. At 11:30, Cal will play
Oregon State and UCLA will face
Washington State.
Odd Schedule
In the afternoon, four more
games will be played, and then
another four will be held
tomorrow morning. (The
scheduling is, needless to say,
somewhat odd.)
At any rate, every team will
play four games, with the
championship game tomorrow at
1:30 p.m.
Priddle said the draw was made
blindly, "from a hat," and admits
his team is a little miffed at
drawing Washington for the initial
game. "They're all mad at me."
If there is a drawback to the
tournament, it is that there is an
admission fee; $1 for adults, 50
cents for students and children.
Well Prepared
Stanford should go into the
tourney well-prepared, after
shellacking Menlo College 6-0
Wednesday. The Cards put on an
impressive offensive performance,
with 26 shots. Skip Pfeiffer led
the scoring with a
two-thirds-of-a-hat trick.
Stanford scored twice in the
first half. Mack Taylor took the

ball in unassisted for the first goal
at 20 minutes into the period, and
Charlie Hall made it 2-0 with a
penalty kick four minutes before
the end of the half.
At 22 minutes into the second
period Marty Glickfeld passed to
Robby Robb for Stanford's third
tally. Glickfeld scored 14 minutes
later on another penalty kick, and
then Pfeiffer put in two unassisted
shots before the game ended.
Bruce Mosbacher made eight
saves in the goal in netting his
fifth shutout of the season. Menlo
took 13 shots.
Priddle summed it up quite
simply, "We were really shooting
in there." The last time Stanford
faced Menlo the Cards scraped by
2-1.
And so another soccer season,
perhaps stranger than some, draws
to a close. The Cardinals play one
more game after the tournament,
against Notre Dame College Nov.
30.
