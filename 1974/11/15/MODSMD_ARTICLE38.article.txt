Ford Calls For Rocky's Confirmation
PHOENIX, Ariz. President Ford pressed last night for
prompt congressional confirmation of Vice President
designate Nelson A. Rockefeller, and declared that "no
conditions that I could imagine" would lead him to
withdraw the nomination.
Ford said "nominating Nelson Rockefeller" was the first
item on his list of achievements during the first 100 days of
his presidency. He scolded Congress for delaying action on
that vice presidential choice. n
Ford added that there was "no political chicanery
involved in about $2 million in loans and gifts by
Rockefeller to former associates an issue that has
contributed to delays in action on the nomination.
At a nationally broadcast news conference, Ford also
cited as a major achievement his plan for coping with the
economic situation calling it "a finely tuned program" to
deal with recession and inflation at the same time.
He again spurned any turn to wage and price controls,
plugged for quick congressional action on a five percent
surtax on middle and upper income taxpayers, said flatly
that he is not considering an increase in gasoline taxes and
hinted at mandatory energy restrictions if voluntary
consumption curbs don't work.
Nixon Leaves Hospital
LONG BEACH Chalk-faced and thin, former President
Richard M. Nixon left the hospital yesterday and returned
to his San Clemente villa, where he may be examined by
three doctors to determine if he can testify at the Watergate
coverup trial.
His personal physician said he believes Nixon's blood
pressure would soar from the stress of the court-ordered
examination and warned it might set off renewed internal
bleeding.
Nixon shook hands weakly with his doctor, nurses and
other personnel who bad attended him for 23 days before
getting into a limousine that took him and his wife to their
seaside estate 50 miles south of the hospital.
He had lost 10 to 15 pounds since re-entering the
hospital for a second time Oct. 23 after a phlebitis flareup.
Meanwhile in Washington, the head of the medical team
appointed to determine whether Nixon can testify in the
Watergate coverup trial said yesterday he wants more help
from the court before attempting the examination.
Dr. Charles A. Hufnagel also said it is not certain that
the three court-appointed physicians would actually
conduct a physical examination of Nixon, but said they
probably would.
Hufnagel, chief of surgery at Georgetown University
Hospital, said at a news briefing he has asked U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica for clarification of his instructions and
expects a response in two or three days.
The doctors want the court or its agents to make the

contacts with Nixon's lawyers and make arrangements
rather than leaving the legal problems to them, Hufnagel
said. He said no contact has been made by the medical
panel either with Nixon's lawyers or doctors.
Sirica's order, signed Wednesday, instructs the doctors
to report back to the court should Nixon refuse to undergo
examination. Hufnagel said the court should work this out
first and give the doctors a contact in the Nixon camp to
talk to about physical arrangements for the exam.
UMW Leaders Diseuss Settlement
WASHINGTON The 38-member bargaining council of
the striking United Mine Workers (UMW) deliberated last
night on a proposed settlement that UMW President Arnold
Miller predicted would be approved by the 120,000
member union.
Council members assembled at the union's national
headquarters in what union spokesmen said could be an
all-night session. Those arriving for the meeting were
generally non-committal on the proposed agreement.
Initial reaction to the tentative new contract appeared
cautious amortg the rank-and-file members, who went out
on strike Tuesday.
A union source said the bargaining council had covered
only two sections of the 31-section proposal after several
hours in closed-door session.
Council members raised few questions about the wage
section of the proposed contract, but seemed bogged down
on fringe benefit issues, the source said.
The proposal calls for a total 15 percent increase in
wages over three years, plus additional cost-of-living riases.
Wholesale Prices Up 2.3 Percent
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices of goods ranging
from autos to food increased 2.3 percent in October,
signaling higher prices ahead for consumers, the Labor
Department reported yesterday.
Prices of consumer foods rose four percent in wholesale
markets, the biggest one-month increase in 14 months.
Government analysts said this increase already is being
passed along to supermarket shelves.
The October increase in wholesale prices marked the
fourth worst month this year, and put over-all wholesale
prices 22.6 percent above a year earlier. That was the worst
increase since a 28.5 percent rise in the 12-month period
ending in June, 1974.
Today's Weather
Persistent fog along the coast decreasing tomorrow.
Otherwise variable cloudiness through tomorrow but with
patchy fog increasing night and morning. Little temperature
change. Lows tonight in the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs
today and tomorrow in the upper 50s to 60s. Northwest
winds 5 to 15 mph.

Sirica's order, signed Wednesday, instructs the doctors
to report back to the court should Nixon refuse to undergo
examination. Hufnagel said the court should work this out

talk to about physical arrangements for the exam.
UMW Leaders Diseuss Settlement
WASHINGTON The 38-member bargaining council of
the striking United Mine Workers (UMW) deliberated last
night on a proposed settlement that UMW President Arnold
Miller predicted would be approved by the 120,000
member union.
Council members assembled at the union's national
headquarters in what union spokesmen said could be an
all-night session. Those arriving for the meeting were
generally non-committal on the proposed agreement.
Initial reaction to the tentative new contract appeared
cautious amortg the rank-and-file members, who went out
on strike Tuesday.
A union source said the bargaining council had covered
only two sections of the 31-section proposal after several
hours in closed-door session.
Council members raised few questions about the wage
section of the proposed contract, but seemed bogged down
on fringe benefit issues, the source said.
The proposal calls for a total 15 percent increase in
wages over three years, plus additional cost-of-living riases.
Wholesale Prices Up 2.3 Percent
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices of goods ranging
from autos to food increased 2.3 percent in October,
signaling higher prices ahead for consumers, the Labor
Department reported yesterday.
Prices of consumer foods rose four percent in wholesale
markets, the biggest one-month increase in 14 months.
Government analysts said this increase already is being
passed along to supermarket shelves.
The October increase in wholesale prices marked the
fourth worst month this year, and put over-all wholesale
prices 22.6 percent above a year earlier. That was the worst
increase since a 28.5 percent rise in the 12-month period
ending in June, 1974.
Today's Weather
Persistent fog along the coast decreasing tomorrow.
Otherwise variable cloudiness through tomorrow but with
patchy fog increasing night and morning. Little temperature
change. Lows tonight in the mid 40s to low 50s. Highs
today and tomorrow in the upper 50s to 60s. Northwest
winds 5 to 15 mph.
Ford Calls For Rocky's Confirmation
PHOENIX, Ariz. President Ford pressed last night for
prompt congressional confirmation of Vice President
designate Nelson A. Rockefeller, and declared that "no
conditions that I could imagine" would lead him to
withdraw the nomination.
Ford said "nominating Nelson Rockefeller" was the first
item on his list of achievements during the first 100 days of
his presidency. He scolded Congress for delaying action on
that vice presidential choice. n
Ford added that there was "no political chicanery
involved in about $2 million in loans and gifts by
Rockefeller to former associates an issue that has
contributed to delays in action on the nomination.
At a nationally broadcast news conference, Ford also
cited as a major achievement his plan for coping with the
economic situation calling it "a finely tuned program" to
deal with recession and inflation at the same time.
He again spurned any turn to wage and price controls,
plugged for quick congressional action on a five percent
surtax on middle and upper income taxpayers, said flatly
that he is not considering an increase in gasoline taxes and
hinted at mandatory energy restrictions if voluntary
consumption curbs don't work.
Nixon Leaves Hospital
LONG BEACH Chalk-faced and thin, former President
Richard M. Nixon left the hospital yesterday and returned
to his San Clemente villa, where he may be examined by
three doctors to determine if he can testify at the Watergate
coverup trial.
His personal physician said he believes Nixon's blood
pressure would soar from the stress of the court-ordered
examination and warned it might set off renewed internal
bleeding.
Nixon shook hands weakly with his doctor, nurses and
other personnel who bad attended him for 23 days before
getting into a limousine that took him and his wife to their
seaside estate 50 miles south of the hospital.
He had lost 10 to 15 pounds since re-entering the
hospital for a second time Oct. 23 after a phlebitis flareup.
Meanwhile in Washington, the head of the medical team
appointed to determine whether Nixon can testify in the
Watergate coverup trial said yesterday he wants more help
from the court before attempting the examination.
Dr. Charles A. Hufnagel also said it is not certain that
the three court-appointed physicians would actually
conduct a physical examination of Nixon, but said they
probably would.
Hufnagel, chief of surgery at Georgetown University
Hospital, said at a news briefing he has asked U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica for clarification of his instructions and
expects a response in two or three days.
The doctors want the court or its agents to make the

contacts with Nixon's lawyers and make arrangements
rather than leaving the legal problems to them, Hufnagel
said. He said no contact has been made by the medical
panel either with Nixon's lawyers or doctors.
Sirica's order, signed Wednesday, instructs the doctors

that vice presidential choice. n
Ford added that there was "no political chicanery
involved in about $2 million in loans and gifts by
Rockefeller to former associates an issue that has
contributed to delays in action on the nomination.
At a nationally broadcast news conference, Ford also
cited as a major achievement his plan for coping with the
economic situation calling it "a finely tuned program" to
deal with recession and inflation at the same time.
He again spurned any turn to wage and price controls,
plugged for quick congressional action on a five percent
surtax on middle and upper income taxpayers, said flatly
that he is not considering an increase in gasoline taxes and
hinted at mandatory energy restrictions if voluntary
consumption curbs don't work.
Nixon Leaves Hospital
LONG BEACH Chalk-faced and thin, former President
Richard M. Nixon left the hospital yesterday and returned
to his San Clemente villa, where he may be examined by
three doctors to determine if he can testify at the Watergate
coverup trial.
His personal physician said he believes Nixon's blood
pressure would soar from the stress of the court-ordered
examination and warned it might set off renewed internal
bleeding.
Nixon shook hands weakly with his doctor, nurses and
other personnel who bad attended him for 23 days before
getting into a limousine that took him and his wife to their
seaside estate 50 miles south of the hospital.
He had lost 10 to 15 pounds since re-entering the
hospital for a second time Oct. 23 after a phlebitis flareup.
Meanwhile in Washington, the head of the medical team
appointed to determine whether Nixon can testify in the
Watergate coverup trial said yesterday he wants more help
from the court before attempting the examination.
Dr. Charles A. Hufnagel also said it is not certain that
the three court-appointed physicians would actually
conduct a physical examination of Nixon, but said they
probably would.
Hufnagel, chief of surgery at Georgetown University
Hospital, said at a news briefing he has asked U.S. District
Judge John J. Sirica for clarification of his instructions and
expects a response in two or three days.
The doctors want the court or its agents to make the

contacts with Nixon's lawyers and make arrangements
rather than leaving the legal problems to them, Hufnagel
said. He said no contact has been made by the medical
panel either with Nixon's lawyers or doctors.
Sirica's order, signed Wednesday, instructs the doctors
to report back to the court should Nixon refuse to undergo
examination. Hufnagel said the court should work this out
first and give the doctors a contact in the Nixon camp to
talk to about physical arrangements for the exam.
UMW Leaders Diseuss Settlement
WASHINGTON The 38-member bargaining council of
the striking United Mine Workers (UMW) deliberated last
night on a proposed settlement that UMW President Arnold
Miller predicted would be approved by the 120,000
member union.
Council members assembled at the union's national
headquarters in what union spokesmen said could be an
all-night session. Those arriving for the meeting were
generally non-committal on the proposed agreement.
Initial reaction to the tentative new contract appeared
cautious amortg the rank-and-file members, who went out
on strike Tuesday.
A union source said the bargaining council had covered
only two sections of the 31-section proposal after several
hours in closed-door session.
Council members raised few questions about the wage
section of the proposed contract, but seemed bogged down
on fringe benefit issues, the source said.
The proposal calls for a total 15 percent increase in
wages over three years, plus additional cost-of-living riases.
Wholesale Prices Up 2.3 Percent
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices of goods ranging
from autos to food increased 2.3 percent in October,
signaling higher prices ahead for consumers, the Labor
Department reported yesterday.
Prices of consumer foods rose four percent in wholesale
markets, the biggest one-month increase in 14 months.
Government analysts said this increase already is being
passed along to supermarket shelves.
The October increase in wholesale prices marked the
fourth worst month this year, and put over-all wholesale
prices 22.6 percent above a year earlier. That was the worst
increase since a 28.5 percent rise in the 12-month period
ending in June, 1974.

Ford Calls For Rocky's Confirmation
PHOENIX, Ariz. President Ford pressed last night for
prompt congressional confirmation of Vice President
designate Nelson A. Rockefeller, and declared that "no
conditions that I could imagine" would lead him to
withdraw the nomination.
Ford said "nominating Nelson Rockefeller" was the first
item on his list of achievements during the first 100 days of
his presidency. He scolded Congress for delaying action on
that vice presidential choice. n
Ford added that there was "no political chicanery
involved in about $2 million in loans and gifts by
