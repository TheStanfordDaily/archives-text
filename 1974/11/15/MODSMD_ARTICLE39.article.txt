# Prof Advocates Health Insurance

### RICHARD FEARON 
"The only way I see for health to
improve is through advances in
knowledge or through changes in
behavior. How people live is the major
determination of when they will die."
Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs,
speaking in the Tresidder Lounge
lecture series last night, offered that
opinion of the health situation in
America.
"Differences in health levels have
very little to do with medical care," he
observed.
An improvement in general health
necessitates basic changes in American
thought and patterns of living, he said.
Fuchs advocated positive actions in

two other categories of medical care
cost and access.
Costs
In the cost spectrum, Fuchs said
there were two major problems. One is
the unusual costs that may plague a
family with sudden, catastrophic
expenses. "It is not that uncommon
for a family to run up a bill greater
than its total income for that year,"
Fuchs said.
"The only solution is some kind of
insurance. We are moving toward the
stage where there will be compulsory
insurance," he told the group.
The other difficulty is that of the
average cost for medical care.
Nationwide medical costs have

soared to $lOO billion in America
taking eight percent of the GNp
compared to six percent 10 years ago
The reasons and implications of thij
increased cost are numerous, Fuch s
said.
Need Increase
First, the need for medical care has
increased tremendously. The growth
of urban life, environmental factors
stress and other factors have
precipitated this, he said.
At the same time, the decline of
religions and the family as a source of
care has compounded the cost
problem. "A tremendous amount of
medical care and expenses goes f or
that kind of care," Fuchs said.
The cost of medical technology j s
also skyrocketing. Since the mid sos
"it has been much more complex and
more expensive to take care of
patient's health needs. The advances
have been great, but not in relation to
the increased use of resources," Fuchs
said.
Finally, the "growth of the third 1
party medical care" is an important
element of costs. "Patients don't pay
directly before entering" the hospital
and consequently are not so concerned
about the fees. Insurance lessens
expenses greatly, and alleviates much
of the burden on the individual, he
said.
Incentives
Fuchs advocates financial incentives
to lower spending as a solution. "Most
of the care costs come about because
of decisions of the physician, and so if
you want to get a grip on it, you've
got to change physicians' behavior."
Fuchs indicated that "incentives
and constraints of a financial kind, the
capitation method" is an excellent
technique for achieving this goal.
It can take the form of a set limit
on fees, guaranteeing that costs won't
exceed a certain limit, or a salary
regulated by the hospital or group in
charge, he suggested.
Fuchs listed "access to medical
services" as another major problem.
People in general have difficulty in
getting health care, especially the
poor, the rural population and the
minorities, he said.
"The only way I see for health to
improve is through advances in
knowledge or through changes in
behavior. How people live is the major
determination of when they will die."

taking eight percent of the GNp
compared to six percent 10 years ago
The reasons and implications of thij
increased cost are numerous, Fuch s
said.
Need Increase
First, the need for medical care has
increased tremendously. The growth
of urban life, environmental factors
stress and other factors have
precipitated this, he said.
At the same time, the decline of
religions and the family as a source of
care has compounded the cost
problem. "A tremendous amount of
medical care and expenses goes f or
that kind of care," Fuchs said.
The cost of medical technology j s
also skyrocketing. Since the mid sos
"it has been much more complex and
more expensive to take care of
patient's health needs. The advances
have been great, but not in relation to
the increased use of resources," Fuchs
said.
Finally, the "growth of the third 1
party medical care" is an important
element of costs. "Patients don't pay
directly before entering" the hospital
and consequently are not so concerned
about the fees. Insurance lessens
expenses greatly, and alleviates much
of the burden on the individual, he
said.
Incentives
Fuchs advocates financial incentives
to lower spending as a solution. "Most
of the care costs come about because
of decisions of the physician, and so if
you want to get a grip on it, you've
got to change physicians' behavior."
Fuchs indicated that "incentives
and constraints of a financial kind, the
capitation method" is an excellent
technique for achieving this goal.
It can take the form of a set limit
on fees, guaranteeing that costs won't
exceed a certain limit, or a salary
regulated by the hospital or group in
charge, he suggested.
Fuchs listed "access to medical
services" as another major problem.
People in general have difficulty in
getting health care, especially the
poor, the rural population and the
minorities, he said.
"The only way I see for health to
improve is through advances in
knowledge or through changes in
behavior. How people live is the major
determination of when they will die."
Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs,
speaking in the Tresidder Lounge
lecture series last night, offered that
opinion of the health situation in
America.
"Differences in health levels have
very little to do with medical care," he
observed.
An improvement in general health
necessitates basic changes in American
thought and patterns of living, he said.
Fuchs advocated positive actions in

two other categories of medical care
cost and access.
Costs
In the cost spectrum, Fuchs said
there were two major problems. One is
the unusual costs that may plague a
family with sudden, catastrophic
expenses. "It is not that uncommon
for a family to run up a bill greater
than its total income for that year,"
Fuchs said.
"The only solution is some kind of
insurance. We are moving toward the
stage where there will be compulsory
insurance," he told the group.
The other difficulty is that of the
average cost for medical care.
Nationwide medical costs have

soared to $lOO billion in America
taking eight percent of the GNp
compared to six percent 10 years ago
The reasons and implications of thij
increased cost are numerous, Fuch s
