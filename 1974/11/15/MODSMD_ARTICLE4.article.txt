## Undergrads Design Individual Majors 
### CECILE HEROLD 
"I began as a biology major, like
everyone else," senior Jim Renvoyr
recalls. "But I was really interested in
architecture and also aspired to do
some social good."
So Renvoyr became one of the 20
to 35 students, mostly juniors and fall
quarter seniors, who design their own
majors each year. Combining courses
from the departments of architecture,
geology, civil engineering, urban
studies and art, Renvoyr emerged
with his own "urban design" major.
The process of designing an
individualized program begins with a
trip to the Academic Information
Center (AIC), where the student
receives an outline of factors to
consider in proposing his major. If he

believes his idea, qualifies for the
Interdepartmental Major Program he
then begins a five-step process outlined
by the Undergraduate Dean's Advisory
Committee for Individually Designed
Majors.
The first step is the student's
selection of three faculty mambers, all
assistant professors or above, to serve
as an advisory group for his work.
Next, he must prepare a statement
of purpose forming the core of a
formal proposal to the committee.
Serious Statement
B. Michael Closson, assistant dean
of undergraduate studies and
ex-officio member of the advisory
committee, "Some of the students
have felt hassled by the amount of
paperwork involved, but it

demonstrates that the student is really
serious."
Closson said the third step is the
student's outline of a tentative list of
courses comprising his major.
According to the Interdepartmental
Program's guidelines, each major must
consist of at least 60 units, all in
courses of the 100 level or equivalent.
Certain requirements regarding
pass-fail and independent study also
dictate the course outline.
Not A 'Cafeteria'
"The independent major is not
easier than other majors," Closson
remarked. "Actually I'd like to see
some other departments be as strict as
this." English Prof. Kenneth Fields,
chairman of the committee, noted,

"This is not a major chosen cafeteria
style."
After the student selects his courses
and the title for his major, he submits
an official proposal to the committee
through Bob Hamrdla, director of the
Academic Information Center and
ex-officio member of the committee.
The committee, comprised of three
students and four faculty members,
meets monthly to review these
proposals and give them formal
approval.
It does not act as a rubber stamp,
however. "Some rejections are made
because the proposals require
clarification or more specific
programming," Closson explained.
Enthusiastic Students
What is the result after all the
administrative work is completed and
the major is finally approved? Nancy
Thelan, a senior, was so fired with
enthusiasm for her self-designed major
out that she became a member of the
advisory committee herself and now
helps other students with their
programs.
Thelan is majoring in "social
interaction" which covers courses in
sociology, psychology, history, and
political science. "The program gives
you the freedom to choose courses
related to your own needs," she said.
"The great thing about the
program," Renvoyr concluded, "is
that you don't have to work with a
curriculum structured maybe seven
years ago for a particular department."

The committee, comprised of three
students and four faculty members,
meets monthly to review these
proposals and give them formal
approval.
It does not act as a rubber stamp,
however. "Some rejections are made
because the proposals require
clarification or more specific
programming," Closson explained.
Enthusiastic Students
What is the result after all the
administrative work is completed and
the major is finally approved? Nancy
Thelan, a senior, was so fired with
enthusiasm for her self-designed major
out that she became a member of the
advisory committee herself and now
helps other students with their
programs.
Thelan is majoring in "social
interaction" which covers courses in
sociology, psychology, history, and
political science. "The program gives
you the freedom to choose courses
related to your own needs," she said.
"The great thing about the
program," Renvoyr concluded, "is
that you don't have to work with a
curriculum structured maybe seven
years ago for a particular department."
"I began as a biology major, like
everyone else," senior Jim Renvoyr
recalls. "But I was really interested in
architecture and also aspired to do
some social good."
So Renvoyr became one of the 20
to 35 students, mostly juniors and fall
quarter seniors, who design their own
majors each year. Combining courses
from the departments of architecture,
geology, civil engineering, urban
studies and art, Renvoyr emerged
with his own "urban design" major.
The process of designing an
individualized program begins with a
trip to the Academic Information
Center (AIC), where the student
receives an outline of factors to
consider in proposing his major. If he

believes his idea, qualifies for the
Interdepartmental Major Program he
then begins a five-step process outlined
by the Undergraduate Dean's Advisory
Committee for Individually Designed
Majors.
The first step is the student's
selection of three faculty mambers, all
assistant professors or above, to serve
as an advisory group for his work.
Next, he must prepare a statement
of purpose forming the core of a
formal proposal to the committee.
Serious Statement
B. Michael Closson, assistant dean
of undergraduate studies and
ex-officio member of the advisory
committee, "Some of the students
have felt hassled by the amount of
paperwork involved, but it

demonstrates that the student is really
serious."
Closson said the third step is the
student's outline of a tentative list of
courses comprising his major.
According to the Interdepartmental
Program's guidelines, each major must
consist of at least 60 units, all in
courses of the 100 level or equivalent.
Certain requirements regarding
pass-fail and independent study also
dictate the course outline.
Not A 'Cafeteria'
"The independent major is not
easier than other majors," Closson
remarked. "Actually I'd like to see
some other departments be as strict as
this." English Prof. Kenneth Fields,
chairman of the committee, noted,

"This is not a major chosen cafeteria
style."
After the student selects his courses
and the title for his major, he submits
an official proposal to the committee
through Bob Hamrdla, director of the
Academic Information Center and
ex-officio member of the committee.
The committee, comprised of three
