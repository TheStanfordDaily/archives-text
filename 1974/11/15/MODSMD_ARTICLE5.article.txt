# Visitor To China Describes Economic Picture
## 
### STEPHEN M. SOBLE 
Chinese workers are not out to beat the system,
declared Paul Sweezy, who recently returned from a
five-week visit to the People's Republic of China.
Sweezy, editor of The Monthly Review, added
"Chinese workers believe they're working for
themselves, their society and the success of the
revolution."
Speaking to over 250 people on campus last
night, Sweezy explained that China has made
remarkable economic development over the past 25
years.
Besides being self-sufficient in its food supply as
the Chinese delegate to the World Food Conference
recently announced, China is also self-sufficient in
fuel production. Furthermore, China has no
inflation, no national debt and boasts of full
employment, Sweezy said.
This smoothly functioning economy is the result
of ideological transformation, the victory of the
"logic of socialism over the logic of capitalism,"
Sweezy argued.
Different Strike Effects
The side-effects of the current United Mine
Workers strike accurately show the logic of
capitalism, Sweezy said. Because profit is the motive
force of the economy, the coal shortage is causing
lay-offs in the railroad, iron and steel industries.
Under Chinese socialism, Sweezy said, if a
disaster stopped the flow of essential goods,
lay-offs in related industries would not result.
Instead, the workers in the affected industries
would report to the factory to discuss problems,
catch up on work, plan ahead for the resumption of
normal work, or hold study groups.
The difference between capitalism and Chinese
socialism, Sweezy said, is that under capitalism, the
factory represents a mere producer of profit, and
the worker becomes an appendage of the factory's
machines.
In China, factories are more than economic
entities and can serve to meet the human needs of

the workers.
The needs of the workers are elicited through
two mechanisms, economic planning and class
struggle, observed Sweezy. The planning system in
China combines centralization with
decentralization, Sweezy said.
The over-all economic plan is the responsibility
of the central government in Peking. But a great
deal of freedom in iniative and execution is reserved
for the lower levels of government, he added.
Each lower level, province, region, county and
city strives for as high a degree of self-reliance in
production and consumption as possible. Many
Chinese talk of self-reliance as a badge of honor,
Sweezy said.
Because of this self-reliance, Sweezy contended,
Chinese workers take pride in their achievements.
They have developed a high level of group action
and community cooperation, that seems to have
paid off.
"People feel they can do things" declared
Sweezy.
Class Struggle
Class struggle is often misinterpreted to mean
only struggle between the capitalist and proletarian
classes, said Sweezy.
But Mao has defined class struggle to include
social differences of power, authority, and
opportunity which may tend to become hardened
or institutionalized. To counter this tendency
toward elitism, Mao has frequently mobilized the
people and encouraged them to criticize abuses in
the system, Sweezy said.
In one factory he visited, women took the lead in
the current Anti-Confucian-Anti-Lin Piao
mobilization campaign. The women charged that
they were under represented on the decision-making
Factory Revolutionary Committee. The women
were forty-five percent of the work force, but only
held twenty-five percent of the Committee seats.
The women won their demand for increased
representation.
