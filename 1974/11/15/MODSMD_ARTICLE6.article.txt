Response On The Bonfire

Editor:
We must admit to being quite
perplexed over the upcoming
bonfire, as well as the lack of
controversy surrounding the
event. Stanford students and the
Daily appear to be regressing to
the irresponsibility of students of
earlier eras.
Contrary to popular belief, the
energy crisis did not end with the
termination of the Arab oil
embargo, and pollution did not
end with the creation of the EPA.
Both problems are as crucial
today as in the past.
The rationalization that the
bonfire is a small luxury is
ludicrous. Many things are small
luxuries Sunday pleasure drives,
that extra bit of heat in your
house to keep you cozy, etc. We
are constantly urged to relinquish
these for the public good. Why
should an event of such dubious
value as a bonfire be any
exception (though, from Daily
editorial, the bonfire is
tantamount to a supreme spiritual
experience)?
That bonfire watchers are
encouraged to cut back on the use
of their cars to compensate for
the bonfire is absurd. Any
perceptive individual can see that
this is merely an expression of
subconscious personal guilt.
Students should not require a
bonfire to urge them to curtail
unnecessary driving. Awareness
should provide this incentive.
Environmental concern was
claimed by many observers to be a
passing fad. Must Stanford be a
case in point?

The Stanford Inter-Fraternity
Council is again attempting to
stage a "Big Game" Bonfire in the
dry lakebed on Friday, Nov. 22.
In past years, these bonfires
have released over four tons of
pollutants into our already
over-burdened atmosphere. These
pollutants include carbon
monoxide, organics and
particulate matter. Past Bonfires
have been fueled by telephone
poles, hundreds of wooden
packing crates and hundreds of
gallons of fuel oil. Apparently,
this year's fire will be no
exception in this tradition.
The Bay Area Pollution
Control District cannot stop this

Bonfire, because of a legal
loophole in their regulations
which allow "recreational and
cooking fires." Private citizens
(you and I) are not permitted to
burn leaves or other trash in
outdoor fires'by BAAPCD rules.
The Stanford "Big Game"
Bonfire is the last of its kind
remaining in the Bay Area; all
other colleges and high schools
have abolished theirs.
A tradition of polluting the air
and wasting energy resources is a
poor tradition to maintain these
days.
To express your feelings about
the Bonfire, please contact the
Stanford University
administration or the
Inter-Fraternity Council.

The Nov. 13 Daily editorial
rejoices, "The Bonfire is Back"
for only $6OO. Of course, the
editorial goes on, some may think
it is a luxury, or a polluter, but
still it is a small luxury which will
bring the community together. We
suggest that the community
reflect on this fact: $6OO will feed
22 families of the United Farm
Workers in your own local
community every night from now
until and including Thanksgiving
and Christmas. It is true, they will
not eat well.
If any of the Stanford
community *care to try their diet
of pinto beans and cornbread,
they may order packaged meals
from the Agape Community of
the United Campus Christian
Ministry (497-3114) and they will
be delivered. A meal to serve four
persons costs you $3 and sends
$2.30 to the UFW. Group prices
are available. We are hoping for a
large order from the
Inter-Fraternity Council.

Environmental considerations
aside, how do University
Relations and the Athletic
Department justify throwing $4OO
on a Big Game Bonfire, when
President Lyman tells us that the
University is in serious financial
trouble. If the Inter-Fraternity
Council wants to put its efforts
into a big burn, let's keep
Stanford dollars from going up in
smoke!
