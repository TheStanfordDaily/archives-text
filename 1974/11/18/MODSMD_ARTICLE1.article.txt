# SLAC Team Finds New Atomic Particle

### DON COX 
A new sub-atomic particle
described as "the biggest discovery in
high energy physics in years" has been
found simultaneously by teams of
physicists working at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and
the Brookhaven National Laboratory
(BNL) in New York.
The discovery of the totally
unexpected and unpredicted tiny new
fragment of matter, called the "Psi"
particle by the SLAC group and the
"J" particle by the BNL group, was
announced jointly Saturday by both
teams.
The particle's unusual and
unexpected properties, which include
a large mass and a long life, have
prompted energetic discussions as to
how the particle may fit into current
theories on the elementary nature of
matter.

Stanford and Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory (LBL) physicists under
SLAC Prof. Burton Richter found the
new particle while experimenting with
colliding beams of electrons and
positrons matter and anti-matter.
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) Prof. Samuel Ting,
heading a group of MIT physicists at
BNL, detected the "J" particle in the
course of a systematic search for such
phenomena.
Exciting Discovery
"The suddenness of the discovery
coupled with the totally unexpected
properties of the particle are what
make it so exciting. It is not like the
particles we know and we must have
some new kinds of structure," said
Richter and Ting.
"The theorists are working
frantically to fit it into the framework
of our present knowledge of the

elementary particle. We experimenters
hope to keep them busy for some time
to come," they said.
Usually, the existence of new
particles is predicted by theoretical
physicists well in advance of* their
discovery by experimenters working
with atom smashers. Richter said
many Stanford theoretical physicists
are working on the new find, but there
still is much disagreement and
uncertainty about it.
'More Information'
"I spent five hours in a seminar
Friday discussing it. But we would
create a new theory and then a half
hour later destroy it. We need much
more information on the particle's
properties," he said.
Properties of the particle already
known are considered to be
extraordinary. It is relatively heavy,
with a mass of 3.1 billion electron

volts, and a relatively long lifetime for
a nuclear particle of such large mass
100 billionths of a billionth of a
second.
The remarkably long lifetime
indicates the particle must have some
novel, and as yet not understood
properties, which prevent it from
decaying in the much shorter time
expected from a conventional particle.
Weak Force
The new particle might be the
long-sought manifestation of one of
the four basic forces in nature the
so-called weak force according to
some scientists. The other forces are
gravity, electromagnetism, and the
strong force that binds the atomic
nucleus together. But observed
properties of the particle conflict with
those expected in terms of this theory.
Measurements are continuing at
SLAC, BNL, and other laboratories to

detect and determine the new
particle's exact lifetime, spin, charge,
and decay modes. The MIT group is
also searching for additional particles
at BNL and is preparing an experiment
at the CERN laboratory in
Switzerland, extending the search to
much higher energies.
Although discoveries of a new
particle usually await a second
experimental verification before they
are accepted as valid, physicists believe
the evidence is conclusive that a new
kind of particle has been found
because two independent groups using
very different techniques observed the
same phenomenon.
Fiscal Beating
Richter said the discovery and the
excitement generated by it might help
to maintain or boost federal
expenditures for high-energy physics
experimentation at a time when such
projects have been taking a fiscal
beating.
"When things come along to get
physicists and newspapers excited, it
may convince the bureaucrats that
there is still a lot of life in this field
yet," he said.
The SLAC-LBL group observed the
new particle while studying colliding
beams in the SPEAR storage ring.
SPEAR stores high energy electrons
and positrons from the two-mile long
SLAC linear accelerator in two
counter-rotating particle beams.
Annihilate
When the electron and
positron matter and
anti-matter—collide head-on in the
ring, they annihilate each other in a
small fireball, out of which emerge
other particles.
As the energy of the colliding
beams was raised to 3.105 billion
electron volts six months ago,
physicists saw a "sudden enormous
increase" in the number of particles
produced. As the beam energies
continued to rise, the excess
production of heavy particles
vanished.
"Two weeks ago we decided that it
could not be a defect in the equipment

ATOM SMASHER—Stanford physicists at SLAC discovered a new sub-atomic particle, it was announced yesterday. A
team of physicists under SLAC Prof. Burton Richter using the SPEAR storage ring at SLAC (above), observed collisions
of protons and positrons and the ensuing production of the new "psi" particle. MIT physicists discovered the new particle
simultaneously.
and that the only thing that could
have created the increase were new
particles," said Richter.
"So, a week ago Sunday we went
hunting for it and found it," he said.
Detector
The MIT-BNL team made their
discovery while bombarding protons
with protons accelerated to an energy
of 30 billion electron volts in the
alternating gradient synchroton at
BNL. They used an elaborate detector
specifically designed to detect pairs of
electrons and positrons in the presence
of millions of other unwanted
particles.
The SLAC team led by Richter
included Prof. Roy F. Schwitters, and
Dr. Rudolf R. Larsen of SLAC and
Profs. William Chinowsky, Gerson
Goldhaber and George H. Trilling of
LBL.
Ting's MIT team included MIT
Profs. U.J. Becker and Min Chen, and
Dr. Y.Y. Lee of BNL.
The findings of the groups will be
reported simultaneously in the Dec. 2
issue of Physical Review Letters.
