# Do Jews Control The Country?

Do the Jews run the country?
Well, maybe some aspects of it, according
to no less an authority that Gen. George S.
Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Speaking at Duke University last month, the
nation's top military officer noted that Jews
"own, you know, the banks in this country,
the newspapers, you just look at where the
Jewish money is in this country." This, of
course, is in addition to Jewish control of the
arts ("They're Jewish—leftwing " —Richard
M. Nixon).
Anyway, the general's remarks seem to
have stirred a bit of a flap. But when you
stop and think about it, maybe he's right.
After all, Henry Kissinger is Jewish. So are
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger and A.M. Rosenthal,
publisher and managing editor, respectively,
of The New York Times. So, for that matter,
are the last two editors of the Daily. So is
Jack Benny. So is Groucho Marx. So was
Marc Chagall.
Elite Gentiles
But then again, Jerry Ford isn't. Neither is
Benjamin Bradlee of The Washington Post, or
Otis Chandler of the Los Angeles Times. Bob
Woodward isn't (but I think Carl Bernstein
is). A.W. Clausen of Bank of America isn't.
Neither is David Rockefeller of Chase
Manhattan. The Bundy Brothers sure
weren't. No one on the Supreme Court is.
Neither is Earl Butz. Or Bob Hope.

So maybe the general was overstating a
bit. But he did call attention to what appears
to be creeping infiltration of Jews into
American life.
Take baseball's Hall of Fame, for example.
I mean, did you realize that there are Jews in
there? Hank Greenberg and Sandy Koufax,
for two. And baseball is the National
Pastime!
Just look around you. Why, there are Jews
in the United States Senate. Three of 'em!
And my God, they must be all over the
Council on Foreign Relations, to say nothing
of the Screen Actors Guild. And what about
that uppity Arthur Goldberg, who had the
nerve to run against Nelson Rockefeller?
'Jewish Lobby'
So what's to be done? Gen. Brown had his
own possible view of the future: "You can
conjure up a situation where there is another
oil embargo and people in this country are
not only inconvenienced and uncomfortable,
but suffer, and they get tough-minded
enough to set down the Jewish influence in
this country and break that lobby."
But one wonders if even that would be
enough. After all, from what the nation's
number-one military man seems to be saying,
this small band of people have a pretty good
stranglehold on the national life, thwarting
the expressed will of the nation. So let's open
up the debate. Write in! Tell me your

suggestions.
I mean, we all know how canny those
Jews are with their money. And how all
Orientals look alike. And how blacks have
natural rhythm.
Cruel Stereotype
Now some have been so unkind as to
criticize Gen. Brown. They say he is
reinforcing a cruel stereotype. They ask why
he talks about Jews and their money while it
turns out that Nelson Rockefeller has been
spreading his around like fertilizer in a corn
field. They say his comments smack of
anti-Semitism and even made him apologize.
Even Jerry Ford got into the act. In a
hard-hitting statement, he called Gen.
Brown's remarks "ill-advised and poorly
handled."
Not to take anything away from Jerry
but we think one of his predecessors summed
up the situation a little better. It was Harry
Truman, talking about Douglas Mac Arthur.
He said something like this:
"I didn't fire him because he was a dumb
son-of-a-bitch, although he was, but that's
not against the law for generals. If it was, half
to three-quarters of them would be in jail."
