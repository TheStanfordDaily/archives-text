# Letters: Students Blast Big Game Bonfire Plan
## 
### 
Editor:
On Nov. 13, the Daily
published an editorial advocating
a restoration of the annual Big
Game Bonfire. The editors
portrayed the event as a happy
"throwback to days when things
didn't seem so pressing," and
pointed out that the fire would,
by itself, add very little pollutants
to the air. Hence, the
environmentalists need not worry
themselves.
No doubt, the Bonfire's direct,
quantitative effects on the quality
of our atmosphere will not be
worth hassling about, and there is
nothing wrong with backing off
from the pressing issues to relax.
However, we must make the
distinction between relaxation
and living in the past.
It is perfectly all right to "get
away from it all," but while we
are relaxing we must not entirely
forget the context of the situation
in which we are living. The
Bonfire represents just such a
denial of reality. The editors of
the Daily are quite right; the
Bonfire is a throwback to the days
when things didn't seem so
pressing. Things are pressing, and
the Bonfire is an anachronism.
In the past, when air was clean
and sources of fuel seemed
infinite, there was nothing wrong
with cutting up a few tons of
wood, setting it afire, and
watching smoke spew into the sky
for a few hours. Today, however,
the air is dirty and an energy crisis
is no longer imminent; it has
already begun to choke us. We can
no longer afford to expropriate
sources of fuel and pollute the air
without reservation. We must
recognize the context of the
world in which we live.
It is not the direct, quantitative
effects of the Bonfire, but the
gesture implicit in it, which I
respond to. It represents a
lackadaisical attitude on the part
of the student body in a time
which demands genuine concern
and positive action, not just from
environmentalists but from all
who have a stake in the survival of
the human race.

We are members of this year's
senior class that remember the last
Stanford Bonfire. We enjoyed that
coming together of the entire
Stanford community. Yet we
disagree that the Bonfire is
insignificant in terms of our
wasteful lifestyle.
The Bonfire is part of a
consumptive mentality that draws
83,000 people, us among them, to
a football game, seemingly
arriving in 50,000 cars. Dodging
those cars last year down Palm
Drive we yelled "Ride bikes,
down with cars!", and were met
only by bemused looks and the
sight of an Arboretum where you
couldn't see the trees for the cars.
Perhaps we would fine the
Bonfire easier to stomach if it
wasn't so directly connected with
activities that consume well over
200 gallons of fuel oil or that
produce air pollutants more
destructive than those produced
by the burning of eight oil soaked
telephone poles.
After all, should we be proud
that the Bonfire produces only
10 percent of the pollution that
hundreds of jets spew out every
24 hours at the San Francisco
airport?
Why can the Stanford
community, including the
financially pressed administration,
so easily raise $6OO in order to
watch it burn?
We find it sad, but must agree
that the Bonfire was one of the
few events that involved most of
the Stanford community. If we
were three years younger, we
might go and be awed by the
sheer spectacle. But we should
know better. We should not need
the Bonfire as a retreat from
facing the reality of people
starving, as only the Daily could
so "sensitively" put it.

The Daily's front-page photo
of a Big Game Bonfire on Nov. 12
bore a striking and somewhat
disconcerting resemblance to

another traditional ritual of fire
which is no longer in vogue.
Did anyone notice the
similarities to a cross burning? Did
anyone consider the nasty
inferences to be drawn from the
visual similarities of the two
practices?
I was only wondering .. .

The Nov. 13 Daily stated that
"Terra House, the ecology theme
house, has given the event[ the
Bonfire] its approval." That
statement is simply not true.
A Terra resident was present at
last Tuesday's Bonfire
organizational meeting. When the
question as to Terra's position
came up, he said we were not
going to help organize the Bonfire
but that Terra residents were not
necessarily opposed to it. That
does not mean that Terra has
approved it.
This matter did not come
under house consideration prior
to Tuesday's meeting. In the
meantime, a house vote indicated
that a substantial majority of
Terra residents oppose the
Bonfire.
The ecological reasons.against
the Bonfire are clear no matter
what the size of this fire
compared to past ones. While
Terra is not about to organize
resistance to the Bonfire, let the
record indicate that Terra House
has taken a stand against the Big
Game Bonfire.

If what I read in the Daily is
any reflection of the sentiment of
the Stanford community, it
appears we will have another Big
Game Bonfire.
Numbers have been thrown out
concerning the amount of
pollution arising from the Bonfire
4.3 tons from the Bonfire as
compared to 49.7 tons from a
single days operation of San

Francisco Airport. These numbers
should not be how we measure
whether or not to have the
Bonfire.
Have you ever stopped to think
what runs through the minds of
millions of commuters who use
our highways every day? They
probably dislike pollution as
much as you and I, but how
would one less car being driven
help solve the air pollution
problem? So millions of cars clog
our highways and such things as
mass transit legislation fall to the
wayside. If there were a feeling
that the actions of individuals
would help solve the problem,
then things could get better.
Of course there is always a
price one must pay in order to
clean things up. The Daily
editorial of Nov. 13 described the
last Bonfire as, "a beautiful and
awe inspiring sight." I saw the last
Bonfire three years ago and it was
impressive. In case the editorial
board is new to the area, may I
remind them of another
"beautiful and awe inspiring
sight" which existed three years
ago the Stanford foothills
without the blanket of haze.

Two articles and an editorial in
the Nov. 13 Dailyadvocated a Big
Game Bonfire. The last Bonfire
"dumped only 4.7 tons of
contaminants into the
atmosphere," according to the
Daily, which added that twelve
telephone poles and "between
100 and 200 gallons of fuel oil"
will be used.
Are we going crazy? Have we
totally lost all perspective? To put
it bluntly, I see only absurdity in
the remarks made in Daily articles
by Bonfire supporters. Most show
the kind of thinking about our
natural resources and pollution
that perpetuate misuse of our
environment.

Ah, the hallowed traditions of

college life; the Big Game Bonfire
will soon make its annual
appearance on the Stanford scene
just picture it, great clouds of
smoke and soot billowing above a
blazing inferno, our sacrifice of
cellulose to the great god of
sports, of school spirit and of
winning.
The Stanford Inter-Fraternity
Council, in its infinite wisdom,
has again deemed it necessary to
add its very own contribution to
our already over-polluted skies.
The IFC will attempt to stage a
Bonfire in the dry lake bed on
Friday, Nov. 22.
The IFC has received some
financial support for this
uncertain venture from the
Athletic Department and the
University Relations Office.
Pacific Telephone Co. will install
telephone poles in the lakebed for
free (imagine, the phone company
doing something for free; doesn't
it make you wonder just a bit?).
Some of the local corporations
will donate wooden packing crates
for our little inferno.
Every morning I look westward
to see if I can see the mountains;
usually I see outlines of the close
ones; if I'm very lucky I can see
across the Bay to the hills above
Fremont; and these guys want to
add to this haze... to raise
school spirit... for a Big
Game . . .
In past years these Bonfires
have released over four tons of
gaseous pollutants into the air
which we all must breathe. These
pollutants include carbon
monoxide, organic molecules and
particulate matter. These bonfires
have burned telephone poles,
wooden packing crates and fuel
oil.
I was under the impression that
we had an energy crisis, that we
had to conserve our resources,
that people were starving in parts
of the world ... but I guess that is
outside Stanford and therefore we
do not have to be concerned.
I really shouldn't complain. I
guess the Inter-Fraternity Council
does know what's best for all the
rest of us.
