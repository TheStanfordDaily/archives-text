# On Food
## 
### Kim Nyegaard 
I was very disturbed to learn of
Pope Paul Vl's stand on the
hunger problem.
The Pope stated that curbing
birth control would not solve the
world food crisis either in the
present or future. Of course it
would be unrealistic to say that
only by stopping a rising world
population that the world food
shortage would end. However, it is
just as nhive to believe that a
controlled birth rate would not
ease this food crisis.
It upsets me to think that
many of the world's Catholics and
non-Catholics are uneducated in
birth control and the Scriptures,
and therefore unable to question
the Pope's authority. These
people who are the victims of
starvation should not be
encouraged to have more children.
Yes, family life is important, but
at what cost to these devastated
individuals?
Granted, a growing population
. is not the only factor contributing
to our world food crisis. One of
the major contributors is that
many subsistent farmers in areas
of India, Mexico and South
America do not use land to its full
food production capacity.
Common sense reveals that if
better and more fertilizer were
available and used, more food
could be grown to increase
production from 20 percent to 30
percent annually. Yet isn't it
interesting that these countries
with the greatest agricultural
problems have the fastest growing
birth rates; a direct parallel exists
and something must be done to
improve the situation.
A world council has been
drawn together to look at the
problems and hopefully find some
solutions. Nobody seems to be
donating food except the United
States. Of course it would be
wrong and inhumane to shut our
eyes and not help these
starving people.
However, when the Uhited States
suggested some cooperation from
other countries by practicing birth
control methods, we were slapped
in the face by the Pope's
statement.
God gave us our minds to work
and improve our conditions here
on earth. Let's not be unrealistic
and blind to mankinds problems.
As John Donne once wrote, "No
man is an island entire of himself,
every man is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main."

. is not the only factor contributing
to our world food crisis. One of
the major contributors is that
many subsistent farmers in areas
of India, Mexico and South
America do not use land to its full
food production capacity.
Common sense reveals that if
better and more fertilizer were
available and used, more food
could be grown to increase
production from 20 percent to 30
percent annually. Yet isn't it
interesting that these countries
with the greatest agricultural
problems have the fastest growing
birth rates; a direct parallel exists
and something must be done to
improve the situation.
A world council has been
drawn together to look at the
problems and hopefully find some
solutions. Nobody seems to be
donating food except the United
States. Of course it would be
wrong and inhumane to shut our
eyes and not help these
starving people.
However, when the Uhited States
suggested some cooperation from
other countries by practicing birth
control methods, we were slapped
in the face by the Pope's
statement.
God gave us our minds to work
and improve our conditions here
on earth. Let's not be unrealistic
and blind to mankinds problems.
As John Donne once wrote, "No
man is an island entire of himself,
every man is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main."
