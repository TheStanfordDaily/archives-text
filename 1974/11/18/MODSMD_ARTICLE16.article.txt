## New Generation Of Defenders Stars In Cards' Win Over Ducks 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
EUGENE, Ore.— The real story
that came out of this wet,
unspoiled region Saturday might
not be that Stanford kept its
hopes for a winning season alive
with a 17-0 whitewash of Oregon.
And it might not be that Scott
Laidlaw had the best game of a
career that has included some fine
ones. Nor that the defense turned
the game around with a bruising
goal line stand.
Nor even that, as the Oakland
Tribune writer began his article,
Jack Christiansen, by leaving Mike
Cordova in the game, is "either
terribly compassionate or
stubborn as a mule." *
A few unknown and untested
underclassmen provided the real
story by showing that Stanford's
defense during the next two years
will likely be as strong as it has
been this season.
Not Much Chance
This year, six of the seven
linemen and linebackers are
seniors. As many as five of the six
could play in post-season All-Star
games. So the underclassmen
didn't get much chance to play
until this week.
And they came through very
impressively.
Particularly good was
sophomore right end Duncan
McColl, who replaced Roger
StillweU, who was out with
pneumonia. McColl sacked
Oregon QB Norval Turner four
times, showing signs of becoming
a sort of combination Stillwell-Pat
Donovan.
McColl explained he's watched
both star defensive ends closely,
learning to "plow through"
offensive linemen from Stillwell
and techniques of getting around
them from Donovan.
While it's long been known
McColl could pass rush, his ability
against the run had been suspect
until Saturday. Oregon tested him
severely, but McColl responded to
the challenge well.
Linebackers
Equally impressive was a crew
of reserve linebackers who played
most of the second half. John
Olenchalk, Rich Merlo and Dan
Francis all played good games.
Oregon's first string offense did
no better against them than

against the regular unit.
One of the best of the veterans,
Gordy Riegel, heaped praise on
his replacement, Francis,
"Danny's going to keep the
tradition of great linebackers at
Stanford going. He's learned chase
techniques real well. He's been
right behind me all season."
But before the new linebackers
got their chance, the only veteran
who'll be around next season, Geb
Church, walked into the play of
the game.

On the first series from
scrimmage, the Ducks, passing
unusually well, moved to first and
goal at the Stanford two. Three
times, fullback Rick Kane dived
over his right guard, but couldn't
get over the goal line as the Cards'
defensive front outmuscled the
Ducks.
Not Blocked
On fourth down and one inch,
Turner rolled left on an option
pass. He never had a chance,
though, as Church zoomed in
without being blocked and
nabbed Turner seven yards behind
the line.
The Ducks threatened again in
the quarter, but Drew Palin
recovered a fumble at the

Stanford' five to snuff out that
threat. After that, Oregon's
outgunned offense did little.
Stanford's offense also had
too much power to stop. Scott
Laidlaw burst through holes on
the Cards' strong side several
times. Laidlaw collected 100
yards rushing in the first half, but
finished with only 142 because he
didn't play much thereafter.
The Cards' couldn't score a
touchdown in their first four

drives, because of an 0-for-6 start
by Cordova, with incompletions
at the most inopportune times.
On the fourth drive, Laidlaw's
runs did set up a 31-yard Mike
Langford field goal.
Card TD's
The Cards finally did get a
touchdown when Cordova hit
Ron Inge with a swing pass. Inge,
sprung by A1 Tenßhiggencate's
block raced into the end zone for
the score.
The second and final Stanford
TD came late in the third quarter,
when just about every Stanford
fan in attendance thought
Cordova should be removed.
But Cordova, whose form has
resembled that of Joe Kapp for

the past three games, surprised
most fans by throwing two
perfectly spiralling bombs, a
35-yarder to Eric Test and a
23-yard toss to Bill Singler, deep
and all alone in the end zone.
Singler joked about his
"blazing speed" which enabled
him to get by the cornerback,
who apparently fell asleep because
Singler hadn't caught a pass all
day. The Oregon native did have
some speed, though, as he
couldn't stop and slid on the
astroturf, finally bouncing into a
retaining wall.
Dull Game
After that, the game was fairly
dull, as most of the 18,500 fans
contented themselves by throwing
debris and drinking. Guy
Benjamin replaced Cordova
midway through the fourth
quarter, and had his first bad
game of the year, completing only
one of four passes and throwing
two near-interceptions.
Obviously, the reason the
Cardinals won was more talent on
both sides of the line. Oregon was
pretty friuch hopeless. A large
cackle of geese and flock of ducks
which hang around the campus
laughed loudly and knowingly
about the league's last place team.
While few spectators came to
the game, an Oregon basketball
scrimmage yes, a scrimmage
sold out. As one student put it,
"Why don't we give up football
and build a 33,000 seat basketball
stadium?"
Cardinal Notes: Paul Skrabo
and Pat Donovan intercepted
passes for the Cards. Donovan?
Well, somehow a Turner pass was
deflected into his hands. "I was
laughing so hard I couldn't run it
back," Pat said, noting that his
four yard return put him ahead of
fellow lineman Drew Palin, who
earlier this year returned an
interception for minus three
yards...
Langford's field goal gives him
12 for the year, tops in the league.
But Langford's consistent
performance has gone unnoticed
because he doesn't have the range
of Rod Garcia. Ironically,
Langford is listed in NCAA
rankings just behind Garcia's kid
brother, who kicks for Fresno
State.

CLOSING IN—Fullback Scott Laidlaw (33) went over the 1500 yard mark in career rushing Saturday
against Oregon. Laidlaw gained 142 yards for a great 6.8 average. He needs only about 93 yards in his final

CLOSING IN—Fullback Scott Laidlaw (33) went over the 1500 yard mark in career rushing Saturday
against Oregon. Laidlaw gained 142 yards for a great 6.8 average. He needs only about 93 yards in his final
game this week to become Stanford's second leading all-time rusher.
EUGENE, Ore.— The real story
that came out of this wet,
unspoiled region Saturday might
not be that Stanford kept its
hopes for a winning season alive
with a 17-0 whitewash of Oregon.
And it might not be that Scott
Laidlaw had the best game of a
career that has included some fine
ones. Nor that the defense turned
the game around with a bruising
goal line stand.
Nor even that, as the Oakland
Tribune writer began his article,
Jack Christiansen, by leaving Mike
Cordova in the game, is "either
terribly compassionate or
stubborn as a mule." *
A few unknown and untested
underclassmen provided the real
story by showing that Stanford's
defense during the next two years
will likely be as strong as it has
been this season.
Not Much Chance
This year, six of the seven
linemen and linebackers are
seniors. As many as five of the six
could play in post-season All-Star
games. So the underclassmen
didn't get much chance to play
until this week.
And they came through very
impressively.
Particularly good was
sophomore right end Duncan
McColl, who replaced Roger
StillweU, who was out with
pneumonia. McColl sacked
Oregon QB Norval Turner four
times, showing signs of becoming
a sort of combination Stillwell-Pat
Donovan.
McColl explained he's watched
both star defensive ends closely,
learning to "plow through"
offensive linemen from Stillwell
and techniques of getting around
them from Donovan.
While it's long been known
McColl could pass rush, his ability
against the run had been suspect
until Saturday. Oregon tested him
severely, but McColl responded to
the challenge well.
Linebackers
Equally impressive was a crew
of reserve linebackers who played
most of the second half. John
Olenchalk, Rich Merlo and Dan
Francis all played good games.
Oregon's first string offense did
no better against them than

against the regular unit.
One of the best of the veterans,
Gordy Riegel, heaped praise on
his replacement, Francis,
"Danny's going to keep the
tradition of great linebackers at
Stanford going. He's learned chase
techniques real well. He's been
right behind me all season."
But before the new linebackers
got their chance, the only veteran
who'll be around next season, Geb
Church, walked into the play of
the game.

On the first series from
scrimmage, the Ducks, passing
unusually well, moved to first and
goal at the Stanford two. Three
times, fullback Rick Kane dived
over his right guard, but couldn't
get over the goal line as the Cards'
defensive front outmuscled the
Ducks.
Not Blocked
On fourth down and one inch,
Turner rolled left on an option
pass. He never had a chance,
though, as Church zoomed in
without being blocked and
nabbed Turner seven yards behind
the line.
The Ducks threatened again in
the quarter, but Drew Palin
recovered a fumble at the

Stanford' five to snuff out that
threat. After that, Oregon's
outgunned offense did little.
Stanford's offense also had
too much power to stop. Scott
Laidlaw burst through holes on
the Cards' strong side several
times. Laidlaw collected 100
yards rushing in the first half, but
finished with only 142 because he
didn't play much thereafter.
The Cards' couldn't score a
touchdown in their first four

drives, because of an 0-for-6 start
by Cordova, with incompletions
at the most inopportune times.
On the fourth drive, Laidlaw's
runs did set up a 31-yard Mike
Langford field goal.
Card TD's
The Cards finally did get a
touchdown when Cordova hit
Ron Inge with a swing pass. Inge,
sprung by A1 Tenßhiggencate's
block raced into the end zone for
the score.
The second and final Stanford
TD came late in the third quarter,
when just about every Stanford
fan in attendance thought
Cordova should be removed.
But Cordova, whose form has
resembled that of Joe Kapp for

the past three games, surprised
most fans by throwing two
perfectly spiralling bombs, a
35-yarder to Eric Test and a
23-yard toss to Bill Singler, deep
and all alone in the end zone.
Singler joked about his
"blazing speed" which enabled
him to get by the cornerback,
who apparently fell asleep because
Singler hadn't caught a pass all
day. The Oregon native did have
some speed, though, as he
couldn't stop and slid on the
astroturf, finally bouncing into a
retaining wall.
Dull Game
After that, the game was fairly
dull, as most of the 18,500 fans
contented themselves by throwing
debris and drinking. Guy
Benjamin replaced Cordova
midway through the fourth
quarter, and had his first bad
game of the year, completing only
one of four passes and throwing
two near-interceptions.
Obviously, the reason the
Cardinals won was more talent on
both sides of the line. Oregon was
pretty friuch hopeless. A large
cackle of geese and flock of ducks
which hang around the campus
laughed loudly and knowingly
about the league's last place team.
While few spectators came to
the game, an Oregon basketball
scrimmage yes, a scrimmage
sold out. As one student put it,
"Why don't we give up football
and build a 33,000 seat basketball
stadium?"
Cardinal Notes: Paul Skrabo
and Pat Donovan intercepted
passes for the Cards. Donovan?
Well, somehow a Turner pass was
deflected into his hands. "I was
laughing so hard I couldn't run it
back," Pat said, noting that his
four yard return put him ahead of
fellow lineman Drew Palin, who
earlier this year returned an
interception for minus three
yards...
Langford's field goal gives him
12 for the year, tops in the league.
But Langford's consistent
performance has gone unnoticed
because he doesn't have the range
of Rod Garcia. Ironically,
Langford is listed in NCAA
rankings just behind Garcia's kid
brother, who kicks for Fresno
State.

CLOSING IN—Fullback Scott Laidlaw (33) went over the 1500 yard mark in career rushing Saturday
against Oregon. Laidlaw gained 142 yards for a great 6.8 average. He needs only about 93 yards in his final
game this week to become Stanford's second leading all-time rusher.
EUGENE, Ore.— The real story
that came out of this wet,
unspoiled region Saturday might
not be that Stanford kept its
hopes for a winning season alive
with a 17-0 whitewash of Oregon.
And it might not be that Scott
Laidlaw had the best game of a
career that has included some fine
ones. Nor that the defense turned
the game around with a bruising
goal line stand.
Nor even that, as the Oakland
Tribune writer began his article,
Jack Christiansen, by leaving Mike
Cordova in the game, is "either
terribly compassionate or
stubborn as a mule." *
A few unknown and untested
underclassmen provided the real
story by showing that Stanford's
defense during the next two years
will likely be as strong as it has
been this season.
Not Much Chance
This year, six of the seven
linemen and linebackers are
seniors. As many as five of the six
could play in post-season All-Star
games. So the underclassmen
didn't get much chance to play
until this week.
And they came through very
impressively.
Particularly good was
sophomore right end Duncan
McColl, who replaced Roger
StillweU, who was out with
pneumonia. McColl sacked
Oregon QB Norval Turner four
times, showing signs of becoming
a sort of combination Stillwell-Pat
Donovan.
McColl explained he's watched
both star defensive ends closely,
learning to "plow through"
offensive linemen from Stillwell
and techniques of getting around
them from Donovan.
While it's long been known
McColl could pass rush, his ability
against the run had been suspect
until Saturday. Oregon tested him
severely, but McColl responded to
the challenge well.
Linebackers
Equally impressive was a crew
of reserve linebackers who played
most of the second half. John
Olenchalk, Rich Merlo and Dan
Francis all played good games.
Oregon's first string offense did
no better against them than

against the regular unit.
One of the best of the veterans,
Gordy Riegel, heaped praise on
his replacement, Francis,
"Danny's going to keep the
tradition of great linebackers at
Stanford going. He's learned chase
techniques real well. He's been
right behind me all season."
But before the new linebackers
got their chance, the only veteran
who'll be around next season, Geb
Church, walked into the play of
the game.

On the first series from
scrimmage, the Ducks, passing
unusually well, moved to first and
goal at the Stanford two. Three
times, fullback Rick Kane dived
over his right guard, but couldn't
get over the goal line as the Cards'
defensive front outmuscled the
Ducks.
Not Blocked
On fourth down and one inch,
Turner rolled left on an option
pass. He never had a chance,
though, as Church zoomed in
without being blocked and
nabbed Turner seven yards behind
the line.
The Ducks threatened again in
the quarter, but Drew Palin
recovered a fumble at the

Stanford' five to snuff out that
threat. After that, Oregon's
outgunned offense did little.
Stanford's offense also had
too much power to stop. Scott
Laidlaw burst through holes on
the Cards' strong side several
times. Laidlaw collected 100
yards rushing in the first half, but
finished with only 142 because he
didn't play much thereafter.
The Cards' couldn't score a
touchdown in their first four

drives, because of an 0-for-6 start
by Cordova, with incompletions
at the most inopportune times.
On the fourth drive, Laidlaw's
runs did set up a 31-yard Mike
Langford field goal.
Card TD's
The Cards finally did get a
touchdown when Cordova hit
Ron Inge with a swing pass. Inge,
sprung by A1 Tenßhiggencate's
block raced into the end zone for
the score.
The second and final Stanford
TD came late in the third quarter,
when just about every Stanford
fan in attendance thought
Cordova should be removed.
But Cordova, whose form has
resembled that of Joe Kapp for

the past three games, surprised
most fans by throwing two
perfectly spiralling bombs, a
35-yarder to Eric Test and a
23-yard toss to Bill Singler, deep
and all alone in the end zone.
Singler joked about his
"blazing speed" which enabled
him to get by the cornerback,
who apparently fell asleep because
Singler hadn't caught a pass all
day. The Oregon native did have
some speed, though, as he
couldn't stop and slid on the
astroturf, finally bouncing into a
retaining wall.
Dull Game
After that, the game was fairly
dull, as most of the 18,500 fans
contented themselves by throwing
debris and drinking. Guy
Benjamin replaced Cordova
midway through the fourth
quarter, and had his first bad
game of the year, completing only
one of four passes and throwing
two near-interceptions.
Obviously, the reason the
Cardinals won was more talent on
both sides of the line. Oregon was

Stanford' five to snuff out that
threat. After that, Oregon's
outgunned offense did little.
Stanford's offense also had
too much power to stop. Scott
Laidlaw burst through holes on
the Cards' strong side several
times. Laidlaw collected 100
yards rushing in the first half, but
finished with only 142 because he
didn't play much thereafter.
The Cards' couldn't score a
touchdown in their first four

drives, because of an 0-for-6 start
by Cordova, with incompletions
at the most inopportune times.
On the fourth drive, Laidlaw's
runs did set up a 31-yard Mike
Langford field goal.
Card TD's
The Cards finally did get a
touchdown when Cordova hit
Ron Inge with a swing pass. Inge,
sprung by A1 Tenßhiggencate's
block raced into the end zone for
the score.
The second and final Stanford
TD came late in the third quarter,
when just about every Stanford
fan in attendance thought
Cordova should be removed.
But Cordova, whose form has
resembled that of Joe Kapp for

the past three games, surprised
most fans by throwing two
perfectly spiralling bombs, a
35-yarder to Eric Test and a
23-yard toss to Bill Singler, deep
and all alone in the end zone.
Singler joked about his
"blazing speed" which enabled
him to get by the cornerback,
who apparently fell asleep because
Singler hadn't caught a pass all
day. The Oregon native did have
some speed, though, as he
couldn't stop and slid on the
astroturf, finally bouncing into a
retaining wall.
Dull Game
After that, the game was fairly
dull, as most of the 18,500 fans
contented themselves by throwing
debris and drinking. Guy
Benjamin replaced Cordova
midway through the fourth
quarter, and had his first bad
game of the year, completing only
one of four passes and throwing
two near-interceptions.
Obviously, the reason the
Cardinals won was more talent on
both sides of the line. Oregon was
pretty friuch hopeless. A large
cackle of geese and flock of ducks
which hang around the campus
laughed loudly and knowingly
about the league's last place team.
While few spectators came to
the game, an Oregon basketball
scrimmage yes, a scrimmage
sold out. As one student put it,
"Why don't we give up football
and build a 33,000 seat basketball
stadium?"
Cardinal Notes: Paul Skrabo
and Pat Donovan intercepted
passes for the Cards. Donovan?
Well, somehow a Turner pass was
deflected into his hands. "I was
laughing so hard I couldn't run it
back," Pat said, noting that his
four yard return put him ahead of
fellow lineman Drew Palin, who
earlier this year returned an
interception for minus three
yards...
Langford's field goal gives him
12 for the year, tops in the league.
But Langford's consistent
performance has gone unnoticed
because he doesn't have the range
of Rod Garcia. Ironically,
Langford is listed in NCAA
rankings just behind Garcia's kid

CLOSING IN—Fullback Scott Laidlaw (33) went over the 1500 yard mark in career rushing Saturday
against Oregon. Laidlaw gained 142 yards for a great 6.8 average. He needs only about 93 yards in his final
game this week to become Stanford's second leading all-time rusher.
EUGENE, Ore.— The real story
that came out of this wet,
unspoiled region Saturday might
not be that Stanford kept its
hopes for a winning season alive
with a 17-0 whitewash of Oregon.
And it might not be that Scott
Laidlaw had the best game of a
career that has included some fine
ones. Nor that the defense turned
the game around with a bruising
goal line stand.
Nor even that, as the Oakland
Tribune writer began his article,
Jack Christiansen, by leaving Mike
Cordova in the game, is "either
terribly compassionate or
stubborn as a mule." *
A few unknown and untested
underclassmen provided the real
story by showing that Stanford's
defense during the next two years
will likely be as strong as it has
been this season.
Not Much Chance
This year, six of the seven
linemen and linebackers are
seniors. As many as five of the six
could play in post-season All-Star
games. So the underclassmen
didn't get much chance to play
until this week.
And they came through very
impressively.
Particularly good was
sophomore right end Duncan
McColl, who replaced Roger
StillweU, who was out with
pneumonia. McColl sacked
Oregon QB Norval Turner four
times, showing signs of becoming
a sort of combination Stillwell-Pat
Donovan.
McColl explained he's watched
both star defensive ends closely,
learning to "plow through"
offensive linemen from Stillwell
and techniques of getting around
them from Donovan.
While it's long been known
McColl could pass rush, his ability
against the run had been suspect
until Saturday. Oregon tested him
severely, but McColl responded to
the challenge well.
Linebackers
Equally impressive was a crew
of reserve linebackers who played
most of the second half. John
Olenchalk, Rich Merlo and Dan
Francis all played good games.
Oregon's first string offense did
no better against them than

against the regular unit.
One of the best of the veterans,
Gordy Riegel, heaped praise on
his replacement, Francis,
"Danny's going to keep the
tradition of great linebackers at
Stanford going. He's learned chase
techniques real well. He's been
right behind me all season."
But before the new linebackers
got their chance, the only veteran
who'll be around next season, Geb
Church, walked into the play of
the game.

On the first series from
scrimmage, the Ducks, passing
unusually well, moved to first and
goal at the Stanford two. Three
times, fullback Rick Kane dived
over his right guard, but couldn't
get over the goal line as the Cards'
defensive front outmuscled the
Ducks.
Not Blocked
On fourth down and one inch,
Turner rolled left on an option
pass. He never had a chance,
though, as Church zoomed in
without being blocked and
nabbed Turner seven yards behind
the line.
The Ducks threatened again in
the quarter, but Drew Palin
recovered a fumble at the

Stanford' five to snuff out that
threat. After that, Oregon's
outgunned offense did little.
Stanford's offense also had
