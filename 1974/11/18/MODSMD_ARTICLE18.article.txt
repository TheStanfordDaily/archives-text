# Rose Bowl Deciders Set
## Pac-8, Big 10 Come Down To Wire 
### 
Traditional rivalries, one of
which extends just across town,
are all that stand between four
football teams and two bids to the
Rose Bowl.
The stage is set for the
championship of Los Angeles this
Saturday as Southern California
and UCLA battle to represent the
Pacific Eight in Pasadena New
Year's Day.
Meanwhile, over two thousand
miles away in Columbus, Ohio,
nationally-ranked powers
Michigan and Ohio State will
renew a rivalry that has
determined the Big Ten's Rose
Bowl entrant since 1969.
USC dismantled Washington
42-11 Saturday, a team that beat
UCLA earlier in the season. But
Trojan Coach John McKay
predicts a "dogfight" against the
Bruins.
And Husky coach Jim Owens
agrees.
"It's really tough to compare
UCLA and USC because we didn't
play as well Saturday as we did
when we beat the Bruins," Owens
said. "They are two good clubs
and I think it will be a close,
tough game next week."
UCLA, plagued by injuries that

have sidelined half of their
starting backfield, beat Oregon
33-14 Saturday in Corvallis.
Senior halfback Russel Charles
scored two touchdowns and
UCLA's defense was impressive in
stopping the Beavers, who had
battled the Los Angeles club to a
7-7 half-time standoff.
If UCLA defeats the Trojans
next Saturday at the Coliseum
and Notre Dame stops USC Nov.
30 (or California beats Stanford
this week), it will £e the Bruins'
first Rose Bowl appearance since
1966.
USC looked good Saturday.
Particularly so looked tailback
Anthony Davis, who scored two
touchdowns and gained 147
yards on 29 carries to become the
first three-time 1000 yard rusher
in Pac-8 history.
In other conference action,
California downed Washington
State 37-33 in a Big Game
prelude. The lead changed hands
seven times and California
linebacker Rick Booth forced a
fumble on his own two-yard line
with 1:30 left to play to prevent
it from seesawing an eighth time.
Bear quarterback Steve
Bartkowski, now being touted for
the Heisman Trophy, completed
21 of 30 passes for 304 yards,
breaking a school one-season
passing record set by Craig
Morton in 1964.
In the Big Ten, third-ranked
Michigan tuned up for its meeting
with Ohio State by literally
running over Purdue 51-0.
Injured Dennis Franklin put on
his best passing display of the year
before being hurt, throwing two
touchdown passes and completing
seven of 12 for 143 yards. His leg,
however, is swelling again and
could hamper his performance
next week.
The win assured the Wolverines
of at least a tie for the Big Ten
crown which they have shared
with Ohio State for the past two
years.
In lowa City, Archie Griffin
and Champ Henson bulldozed for
253 yards as lowa extended
fourth-ranked Ohio State a whole
half before succumbing 35-10.

Year's Day.
Meanwhile, over two thousand
miles away in Columbus, Ohio,
nationally-ranked powers
Michigan and Ohio State will
renew a rivalry that has
determined the Big Ten's Rose
Bowl entrant since 1969.
USC dismantled Washington
42-11 Saturday, a team that beat
UCLA earlier in the season. But
Trojan Coach John McKay
predicts a "dogfight" against the
Bruins.
And Husky coach Jim Owens
agrees.
"It's really tough to compare
UCLA and USC because we didn't
play as well Saturday as we did
when we beat the Bruins," Owens
said. "They are two good clubs
and I think it will be a close,
tough game next week."
UCLA, plagued by injuries that

have sidelined half of their
starting backfield, beat Oregon
33-14 Saturday in Corvallis.
Senior halfback Russel Charles
scored two touchdowns and
UCLA's defense was impressive in
stopping the Beavers, who had
battled the Los Angeles club to a
7-7 half-time standoff.
If UCLA defeats the Trojans
next Saturday at the Coliseum
and Notre Dame stops USC Nov.
30 (or California beats Stanford
this week), it will £e the Bruins'
first Rose Bowl appearance since
1966.
USC looked good Saturday.
Particularly so looked tailback
Anthony Davis, who scored two
touchdowns and gained 147
yards on 29 carries to become the
first three-time 1000 yard rusher
in Pac-8 history.
In other conference action,
California downed Washington
State 37-33 in a Big Game
prelude. The lead changed hands
seven times and California
linebacker Rick Booth forced a
fumble on his own two-yard line
with 1:30 left to play to prevent
it from seesawing an eighth time.
Bear quarterback Steve
Bartkowski, now being touted for
the Heisman Trophy, completed
21 of 30 passes for 304 yards,
breaking a school one-season
passing record set by Craig
Morton in 1964.
In the Big Ten, third-ranked
Michigan tuned up for its meeting
with Ohio State by literally
running over Purdue 51-0.
Injured Dennis Franklin put on
his best passing display of the year
before being hurt, throwing two
touchdown passes and completing
seven of 12 for 143 yards. His leg,
however, is swelling again and
could hamper his performance
next week.
The win assured the Wolverines
of at least a tie for the Big Ten
crown which they have shared
with Ohio State for the past two
years.
In lowa City, Archie Griffin
and Champ Henson bulldozed for
253 yards as lowa extended
fourth-ranked Ohio State a whole
half before succumbing 35-10.
Traditional rivalries, one of
which extends just across town,
are all that stand between four
football teams and two bids to the
Rose Bowl.
The stage is set for the
championship of Los Angeles this
Saturday as Southern California
and UCLA battle to represent the
Pacific Eight in Pasadena New
Year's Day.
