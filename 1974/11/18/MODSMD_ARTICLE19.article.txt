# Hard Day For Hockey Team
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
Saturday was a long, hard day
for the Stanford field hockey
team.
In the morning, the Cards
survived injuries and a strange
lineup to tie a good team from
Simon Frazier Univeristy 1-1. The
varsity then played a half against
the Pacific Southwest All-Star
team No. 1, losing 3-0. This was
followed by 35 minutes of play
against the PSW No. 2 team, who
outscored the Cards 1-0.
The Simon Frazier game was a
fine exhibition of field hockey.
The Stanford offense struggled
throughout the game as every
player on the front line tried a
new position, but the Cards'
defense did an extraordinary job.
Stanford took the lead very
early in the game on Ann Walker's
goal and held the advantage until
the visitors scored with only six
minutes left to play.
With the score tied 1-1, play
flowed up and down the field.
Two injuries hit the Cards in the
last two minutes.
Junior Jane Schultz, who
moments before had made a

miraculous stop of a hard drive,
was struck in the eye by the ball
and forced to leave the game.
Stanford finished the game one
person short.
At about the same time, Kathy
Levinson nearly scored for
Stanford but fell and added a
sprained wrist to her two bad
knees.
With Schultz and Levinson out
of the afternoon lineup, the
Cards played gamely, but were no
match for the All-Stars. By the
end of the afternoon's play even
the usually tireless Stanford
defenders were dragging their feet.
The varsity now has a week to
rest for its season-ending rematch
with Cal State-Humboldt here
next Saturday morning. The
junior varsity plays two
non-league games this week.

players during the team's 3-2 loss to San Jose State last week. Schoof,
often criticized as a poor basketball mentor, reportedly will not coach
the women's cage team this year.
