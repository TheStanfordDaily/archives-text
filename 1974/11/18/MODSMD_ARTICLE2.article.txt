# Files To Be Cleared Of Confidential Letters
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The administration will remove
confidential letters of
recommendation from students'
cumulative records in response to a
new law which allows students to view
their Files, Acting President William
Miller announced Friday.
The law, which takes effect
tomorrow, will allow students over 18
to "inspect and review any and all
official records, files and data directly
related" to themselves.
Confidential letters of
recommendation will be stored
separately from other files kept on
students, and access will be allowed
"only upon agreement from the
President's Office. It is our present
intent to allow access only if our
admissions decisions are challenged,"
Miller stated Friday. He explained the
reasoning behind the pronouncement.
"[Students] have the right to view
these records, if used for school
purposes. It is our position that those
records are not so used. They were
intended for admissions only and not
for outside use, and so we can keep
them separate," Miller noted.
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, claimed that the law applies
to Stanford only when students are
actually attending the University,
rather than during the admissions
process as well.
"The point is, that [letters of
recommendation] are relied upon in
the admissions process prior to the
time the person becomes a student
here, when the provisions of the law
apply. By the time someone becomes a
student, these records are no longer
used," Siena said.
Immediate Removal Set
Fred Hargadon, dean of admissions,
said that the process of removing
letters of recommendation from all
files will begin immediately. The
University's action applies to students
already here as well as to new ones, he
explained.

"We have to honor the
commitment under which [the
recommendations] were solicited. We
will continue to solicit confidential
recommendations [and] put them in
cold storage prior to sending the rest
of the files to the Registrar's office,"
Hargadon noted.
Although plans are not final,
students will probably be able to sign
up to view their files beginning
tomorrow, Miller said. After
confidential letters are removed, the
student would then be allowed to
inspect the record.
"We're going to comply with the
law," Miller insisted. "The removal of
these letters is in anticipation of
letting students see their files. We have
asked departments to notify us if they
have any problems, since students may
want to see their files before [the
letters are removed]."
Controversy A 'Surprise'
Hargadon voiced surprise that the
letters of recommendation were a
major source of controversy.
"The way we collect
recommendations is not to solicit
them from people we name. Rather,
we let the students themselves select
two teachers for recommendations. I
think students realize that 99.8
percent of recommendations are
positive," Hargadon remarked.
The access-to-files law, authored by
Sen. James Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.),
contains an "ambiguous" phrase which
University lawyers have "narrowly
construed," according to Hargadon.
The debated section reads, in part:
[Students have] the right to inspect
and review any and all official records,
files, and data directly related to
[them], including all material that is
incorporated into each student's
cumulative record folder, and intended
for school use or to be available to
parties outside the school or school
system, and specifically
including . ... teacher or counselor
ratings and observations ..."
University Interpretation
Hargadon explained how the
University viewed the clause.
"We again are reading -'school use' "
as the cumulative record. Technically,
the records we are removing are not
used by the school as the student goes
through Stanford ... at least, not to
my knowledge. Keep in mind that this
was written primarily with secondary
schools in mind," Hargadon
commented.
One major difficulty facing school
administrations across the nation
trying to interpret the spirit of the law

is that the law was passed without any
public hearings.
"Since there were no hearings on it,
it's difficult to know just what was
meant," Hargadon noted.
Some senators, notably Sen.
Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.), may try to win
a delay of the effective date of the
legislation when Congress reconvenes
today, The New York Times reported
yesterday.
Decision Period
In any event, the law has a built-in
45-day time period during which
schools can decide what information
they will let a student see. Thus,
schools have until at least January

before releasing the contents of any
student files.
"There is some hope that the
legislation will be amended," Miller
noted. "There are people working on
it. If there are hearings, we
hope . . . the legislators can understand
the importance of confidentiality."
Siena explained why the University
is even bothering to keep the letters of
recommendation.
"The prospect of a lawsuit
[challenging an admissions decision] is
before us. Since the letters do make a
difference in the admissions process,
we feel it prudent to keep them,"
Siena stated.
