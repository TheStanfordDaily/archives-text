# UCLA, Washington St. Win Pac-8 Titles Here
## Bruins' Soccer; Cards Finish Seventh 
### DAN PYNE 
A lot of excellent soccer was
dispalyed in the Stanford
Invitational soccer tournament
Friday and Saturday.
Unfortunately very little of it was
displayed by Stanford.
And while the Cardinals now
8-10-3 fumbled their way into
seventh place with a 1-0 overtime
decision over Washington State,
UCLA blanked a surprising USC
™ 2-0 for the championship.
Despite cold weather and the
flu (the San Jose Earthquakes
were scheduled to play a halftime
exhibition for the championship
game, but cancelled it when four
. players got sick), Cal coach Bob
* Di Grazia and Stanford coach
Fred Priddle staged an impressive
soccer first for the Pac-8.
The Bruins were favored to
win, and, with a roster that read
like an international phone
directory, scored nine goals, gave
up none, and lived up to their
11th place national ranking.
But USC was somewhat of a
surprise. The Trojans overpowered
Oregon in the first round 5-1,
then upset Washington, eighth
ranked in the West, 2-1 in
. overtime on sudden death penalty
™ kicks.
UCLA reached the finals by
drubbing Washington State 5-0 in
the first round and beating Cal 2-0
in the semi-finals.
Confrontation
The championship game was a
• superb confrontation between
soccer of different philosophies.
USC played "kick-and-run," relying
on long crosses and passes, and
hoping for a breakaway that never
materialized as the Bruin fullbacks
managed to contain the Trojan
forwards.
UCLA concentrated on
ball control with short, accurate
passing, and scored twice on the
same basic play.
Both teams took only six shots
in the first half, but UCLA
g. controlled the second period with
nine shots to USC's one. Knut
Kristiansen of USC was awarded
the tournament's Most Valuable
Player award, a multicolor,
spotted soccer ball.
Oh Yes, Stanford
Oh yes, and the Stanford
Cardinals were there too.
Against Washington in the first
round, the Cards did well. Eleven
minutes into the first period a
lapse in the Card defense allowed
Husky forward Ward Forrest to
dribble through them and score.
| Forrest, dubbed "ICBM" after
rocketing a shot from midfield
into the trees by the athletic
grounds buildings, calmly chipped
his clear shot into the left side of
the goal, giving Washington a 1-0
lead.

w That was all the Huskies got
against Stanford's stubborn
defense, but it was all they
needed. The Cards put on their
usual late-game pressure, but
could not score.
Cal Wins
In the other first round game,
!t Oregon State surprised Cal early
in the game with some impressive
ball control, then fell apart and
gave up two quick goals. The
Beavers regrouped, but Cal won
2-0.
After Oregon was drubbed by USC
USC everyone thought Stanford
would be the next to whitewash
the erratic Ducks. The Cards, of
course, refused to play the role of
the favorite. Leading 2-0 midway

through the second half on goals
by Charlie Hall and Phil Wright,
Priddle took out some of his
mainstay defensemen.
The Ducks scored two fast and
awkward goals, and then
proceeded to dump Stanford 4-2
on penalty kicks.
Bottom Playoff
In the bottom-of-the-heap
playoff, the Cards, sans Marty
Glickfeld and Jim Melamed,
pushed the ball around the field
for about 90 minutes against
Washington State, with no
scoring, but then managed to beat
the hapless Cougars on penalty
kicks.
Forward Glenn Cristofori, who
surprised everyone by outrunning
a Washington State fullback early
in the game, attempted to explain
the Cards' dismal performance in
their last two matches. "We had a
little mental letdown after losing
to Oregon on penalty kicks," he
said, "because we outplayed
them."
Washington and Cal battled to
a standoff in the third-place game,
2-2, and the Huskies, perhaps due
to some early-morning practice,
were able to beat the Bears on
penalty kicks.
Oregon State continued to be
somewhat surprising, and after the
initial loss to Cal beat Washington
State and Oregon to take fifth in
the tournament.
That was the first annual
Stanford Invitational Soccer
tourney.
Sigh.

FUTILE LEAP Stanford goalkeeper Bruce Mosbacher attempts to
block an overtime penalty kick, but the ball is placed too well.
Mosbacher and Stanford managed to beat Washington State in this
penalty kick series, but Mosbacher, who has five shutouts this season,
spent a lot of time making futile leaps on penalty kicks this week-end
as Stanford placed seventh in the Pac-8 soccer tournament.
