# Lose To Cal, 11-7
## Poloists Await NCAA Bid 
### BOB KUSTEL 
Stanford's water polo team
begins preparing for the biggest
weekend of the season today, as
the Cards (13-9) get ready for the
NCAA championship tournament
at the Belmont Plaza in Long
Beach.
Though not official yet, there
is little doubt in anyone's mind,
including that of coach Art
Lambert, that they will be leaving
for Southern California at the end
of the week.
The Cards concluded their
regular season on Friday with an
11-7 loss to Cal in the Berkeley
pool. The game, of little real
consequence other than an
opportunity for the two teams to
tune-up in anticipation of their
tournament meeting, closed out
the Pac-8 campaign for the two
teams.

Cal and UCLA, each with 5-1
records, finished on top of the
conference, while Stanford's 2-4
league mark was good for third
place. USC, 0-6, occupied the
cellar position.
Dean Anderson, who in four
years has given Cal its share of
headaches, led the Cardinal attack
with three goals, while John Paul
Roberts, Stan Johnson, Rick
Johannsen and Tom Elson
rounded out the scoring with one
each.
The NCAA berth is indeed an
outstanding achievement, for after
a slow start under a new coach
and new program, Stanford jelled
into a formidable team.

The Cards have performed well
in several clutch games this year,
particularly in the last two weeks,
as the poloists have knocked off
Cal Poly-Pomona, UOP, San Jose

State, UC-Davis and USC in
succession to earn the right to vie
for the NCAA crown along with
seven other powerhouses.
The seedings for the
tournament have yet to be
announced. The logical ranking
would place defending champion
Cal in the number one spot,
followed by UCLA, UC-Irvine
and Stanford.
