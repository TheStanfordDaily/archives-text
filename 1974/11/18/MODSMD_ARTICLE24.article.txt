# Ngeno: New Cross Country Hero
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Remember Steve Prefontaine,
the flashy Oregon runner who
closed out his Pacific Eight career
in 1973 with a record-breaking
victory in the league finals at
Stanford?
Well, last Saturday, on the
same course, hardly anybody
remembered Mr. Prefontaine as
John Ngeno, the man who more
than anyone wanted to bury
memories of Pre, demolished Pre's
old course record by a whopping
27 seconds en route to a personal
victory and a Washington State
championship in the Pac-8 finals.
This year's meet had much the
same flavor as last year's bout;
Oregon again was considered the
slight favorite over WSU, mainly
because Oregon's Paul Geis (the
highly touted heir to Pre's throne)
was favored over the talented, but
inconsistent Ngeno.
But two things led to a reversal
of the 1973 outcome; Ngeno
made the tactics of the race serve
his purposes, and his archrival
ended up not showing.
Last year Ngeno forged ahead
of Pre in an attempt to build a
comfortable lead, but when the
Kenyan passed the two-mile mark
in a slow 9:54, Pre was only three
seconds behind. The Oregon
runner broke Ngeno's will with a
quick surge on the last hill to win
by 50 yards.
Didn't Take Lead
This year Ngeno let a
teammate bear the burden of the
early pace before taking the lead
for good near the two mile mark.
His very fast 9:19 at the one-third
point blew out his closest
pursuers, among them Stanford's
Tony Sandoval, who was 20 yards
behind at the two mile mark.
"That early pace hurt us more
than anybody else" said Cardinal
coach Marshall Clark. "Sandy
probably could have handled it if
he hadn't been running on a bum
leg."
From that point forward
Ngeno increased his lead, and was
not seriously challenged after the
third mile. In fact, Ngeno's
performance was so strong that he
pulled three other runners under
Prefontaine's old record.

Oregon's Terry Williams was
second in 27:58.2, Ngeno's
teammate Josrl Kitmeto was
third, and even Oregon's Dave
Taylor, in fourth, was 1.8 seconds
under the old mark of 28:05.4.
WSU won the team title 30-51
over Oregon, but there was some
question whether WSU would
have prevailed if Geis had not
been forced to withdraw due to
illness.
"I ran as easily as I can today,"
Ngeno countered, "and if
someone had been here to push
me I might have increased my lead
and got in the 26 [minute] range.
No Difference
"Things would have been no
different with Geis in the
race ... I've been training very
hard and I am looking forward to

the NCAA finals... I cannot
compare this race to last year's;
today I am very happy, last year
was lousy. I had no strength and
bad muscle problems last year.
Today I was ready for anyone,"
Ngeno said.
Jack Bellah, Stanford's top
finisher at 28:53.0 for 11th place,
tended to agree with the champ.
"Ngeno was great today. If he
runs this well in the NCAA's he
should win. But he will have to
get used to the Indiana course
since he hasn't run there before.
That may be a factor."
Clark echoed Bellah's point.
"Ngeno has to learn to know his
course before the race he'll have
to be wiser than he has been in
the past. He makes a lot of
mistakes; things that could hurt
him in the NCAA meet.
Cards Do Well
"As far as our team goes, I was
pleased given the circumstances.
We could have done better if
Sandy hadn't been hurt, but I was
very pleased with Bellah's
showing. Jack will never surprise
me in the important meets."
Sandoval finished two places
behind Bellah in 13th at 28:55
and seven seconds later senior
Mark McConnell took 15th.
Steady Art Brown was 36th with
Jeff Parietti in 38th. Bellah's
28:53 shaved three seconds off
the old Stanford record set by
Sandoval earlier this year.
Oregon State made a strong
showing to nab third place among
the teams. Cal temporarily took
fourth, but dropped to fifth
behind the Cards when star Brad
Duffey was disqualified for an
illegal maneuver on the
backstretch.
"He took a shortcut around a
sandtrap and passed three guys"
Bellah explained.
Washington and UCLA were
sixth and seventh, with USC not
entered.

under the old mark of 28:05.4.
WSU won the team title 30-51
over Oregon, but there was some
question whether WSU would
have prevailed if Geis had not
been forced to withdraw due to
illness.
"I ran as easily as I can today,"
Ngeno countered, "and if
someone had been here to push
me I might have increased my lead
and got in the 26 [minute] range.
No Difference
"Things would have been no
different with Geis in the
race ... I've been training very
hard and I am looking forward to

the NCAA finals... I cannot
compare this race to last year's;
today I am very happy, last year
was lousy. I had no strength and
bad muscle problems last year.
Today I was ready for anyone,"
Ngeno said.
Jack Bellah, Stanford's top
finisher at 28:53.0 for 11th place,
tended to agree with the champ.
"Ngeno was great today. If he
runs this well in the NCAA's he
should win. But he will have to
get used to the Indiana course
since he hasn't run there before.
That may be a factor."
Clark echoed Bellah's point.
"Ngeno has to learn to know his
course before the race he'll have
to be wiser than he has been in
the past. He makes a lot of
mistakes; things that could hurt
him in the NCAA meet.
Cards Do Well
"As far as our team goes, I was
pleased given the circumstances.
We could have done better if
Sandy hadn't been hurt, but I was
very pleased with Bellah's
showing. Jack will never surprise
me in the important meets."
Sandoval finished two places
behind Bellah in 13th at 28:55
and seven seconds later senior
Mark McConnell took 15th.
Steady Art Brown was 36th with
Jeff Parietti in 38th. Bellah's
28:53 shaved three seconds off
the old Stanford record set by
Sandoval earlier this year.
Oregon State made a strong
showing to nab third place among
the teams. Cal temporarily took
fourth, but dropped to fifth
behind the Cards when star Brad
Duffey was disqualified for an
illegal maneuver on the
backstretch.
"He took a shortcut around a
sandtrap and passed three guys"
Bellah explained.
Washington and UCLA were
sixth and seventh, with USC not
entered.

The Champion
Remember Steve Prefontaine,
the flashy Oregon runner who
closed out his Pacific Eight career
in 1973 with a record-breaking
victory in the league finals at
Stanford?
Well, last Saturday, on the
same course, hardly anybody
remembered Mr. Prefontaine as
John Ngeno, the man who more
than anyone wanted to bury
memories of Pre, demolished Pre's
old course record by a whopping
27 seconds en route to a personal
victory and a Washington State
championship in the Pac-8 finals.
This year's meet had much the
same flavor as last year's bout;
Oregon again was considered the
slight favorite over WSU, mainly
because Oregon's Paul Geis (the
highly touted heir to Pre's throne)
was favored over the talented, but
inconsistent Ngeno.
But two things led to a reversal
of the 1973 outcome; Ngeno
made the tactics of the race serve
his purposes, and his archrival
ended up not showing.
Last year Ngeno forged ahead
of Pre in an attempt to build a
comfortable lead, but when the
Kenyan passed the two-mile mark
in a slow 9:54, Pre was only three
seconds behind. The Oregon
runner broke Ngeno's will with a
quick surge on the last hill to win
by 50 yards.
Didn't Take Lead
This year Ngeno let a
teammate bear the burden of the
early pace before taking the lead
for good near the two mile mark.
His very fast 9:19 at the one-third
point blew out his closest
pursuers, among them Stanford's
Tony Sandoval, who was 20 yards
behind at the two mile mark.
"That early pace hurt us more
than anybody else" said Cardinal
coach Marshall Clark. "Sandy
probably could have handled it if
he hadn't been running on a bum
leg."
From that point forward
Ngeno increased his lead, and was
not seriously challenged after the
third mile. In fact, Ngeno's
performance was so strong that he
pulled three other runners under
Prefontaine's old record.

Oregon's Terry Williams was
second in 27:58.2, Ngeno's
teammate Josrl Kitmeto was
third, and even Oregon's Dave
Taylor, in fourth, was 1.8 seconds
under the old mark of 28:05.4.
WSU won the team title 30-51
over Oregon, but there was some

The Champion
Remember Steve Prefontaine,
the flashy Oregon runner who
closed out his Pacific Eight career
in 1973 with a record-breaking
victory in the league finals at
Stanford?
Well, last Saturday, on the
same course, hardly anybody
remembered Mr. Prefontaine as
John Ngeno, the man who more
than anyone wanted to bury
memories of Pre, demolished Pre's
old course record by a whopping
27 seconds en route to a personal
victory and a Washington State
championship in the Pac-8 finals.
This year's meet had much the
same flavor as last year's bout;
Oregon again was considered the
slight favorite over WSU, mainly
because Oregon's Paul Geis (the
highly touted heir to Pre's throne)
was favored over the talented, but
inconsistent Ngeno.
But two things led to a reversal
of the 1973 outcome; Ngeno
made the tactics of the race serve
his purposes, and his archrival
ended up not showing.
Last year Ngeno forged ahead
of Pre in an attempt to build a
comfortable lead, but when the
Kenyan passed the two-mile mark
in a slow 9:54, Pre was only three
seconds behind. The Oregon
runner broke Ngeno's will with a
quick surge on the last hill to win
by 50 yards.
Didn't Take Lead
This year Ngeno let a
teammate bear the burden of the
early pace before taking the lead
for good near the two mile mark.
His very fast 9:19 at the one-third
point blew out his closest
pursuers, among them Stanford's
Tony Sandoval, who was 20 yards
behind at the two mile mark.
"That early pace hurt us more
than anybody else" said Cardinal
coach Marshall Clark. "Sandy
probably could have handled it if
he hadn't been running on a bum
leg."
From that point forward
Ngeno increased his lead, and was
not seriously challenged after the
third mile. In fact, Ngeno's
performance was so strong that he
pulled three other runners under
Prefontaine's old record.

Oregon's Terry Williams was
second in 27:58.2, Ngeno's
teammate Josrl Kitmeto was
third, and even Oregon's Dave
Taylor, in fourth, was 1.8 seconds
under the old mark of 28:05.4.
WSU won the team title 30-51
over Oregon, but there was some
question whether WSU would
have prevailed if Geis had not
been forced to withdraw due to
illness.
"I ran as easily as I can today,"
Ngeno countered, "and if
someone had been here to push
me I might have increased my lead
and got in the 26 [minute] range.
No Difference
"Things would have been no
different with Geis in the
race ... I've been training very
hard and I am looking forward to

the NCAA finals... I cannot
compare this race to last year's;
today I am very happy, last year
was lousy. I had no strength and
bad muscle problems last year.
Today I was ready for anyone,"
Ngeno said.
Jack Bellah, Stanford's top
finisher at 28:53.0 for 11th place,
tended to agree with the champ.
"Ngeno was great today. If he
runs this well in the NCAA's he
should win. But he will have to
get used to the Indiana course
since he hasn't run there before.
That may be a factor."
Clark echoed Bellah's point.
"Ngeno has to learn to know his
course before the race he'll have
to be wiser than he has been in
the past. He makes a lot of
mistakes; things that could hurt
him in the NCAA meet.
Cards Do Well
"As far as our team goes, I was
pleased given the circumstances.
We could have done better if
Sandy hadn't been hurt, but I was
very pleased with Bellah's
showing. Jack will never surprise
me in the important meets."
Sandoval finished two places
behind Bellah in 13th at 28:55
and seven seconds later senior
Mark McConnell took 15th.
Steady Art Brown was 36th with
Jeff Parietti in 38th. Bellah's
28:53 shaved three seconds off
the old Stanford record set by
Sandoval earlier this year.
Oregon State made a strong
showing to nab third place among
the teams. Cal temporarily took
fourth, but dropped to fifth
behind the Cards when star Brad
Duffey was disqualified for an
illegal maneuver on the
backstretch.
"He took a shortcut around a
sandtrap and passed three guys"
Bellah explained.
Washington and UCLA were
sixth and seventh, with USC not
