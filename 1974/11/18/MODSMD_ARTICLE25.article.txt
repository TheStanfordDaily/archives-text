IRS Reveals Secret Documents
WASHINGTON Newly revealed documents identify
99 political and activist organizations investigated by a
secret intelligence gathering arm of the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) during the Nixon administration.
The IRS has refused for more than a year to name the
organizations, which include such nationally known groups
as the Americans for Democratic Action, National Student
Association, the Urban League and Unitarian Society.
The groups were named in more than 200 pages of
documents made public yesterday as a result of a Freedom
of Information Act suit filed against the tax agency by
Ralph Nader's Tax Reform Research Group.
The documents reveal that, contrary to repeated public
denials by the IRS, the secret Special Service Staff was set
up as an intelligence-gathering unit within the IRS as a
direct result of White House influence in 1969.
It began as a project to identify activist organizations
and individuals for possible income tax audits and
collection of unpaid taxes.
The present IRS commissioner, Donald C. Alexander,
and other agency spokesmen have insisted for the past year
the IRS never succumbed to the political pressures of the
Nixon White House.
The documents show that even as the Special Service
Staff was being disbanded last year in the midst of the
Watergate scandal, Alexander attempted to conceal the true
activities of the unit by claiming it had been set up solely to
investigate tax protesters and people who refused to pay
income tax.
By the time it was abolished, the organization had
collected files in 11,458 individuals and groups, most of
whom still have not been identified. The IRS is refusing to
reveal what has become on the top secret files.
Ford Visits Japan Amid Tight Security
TOKYO President Ford arrived this afternoon Tokyo
time for a historic five-day visit to Japan amid security
precautions so tight that neither Emperor Hirohito nor
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was at Haneda International
Airport to greet him.
Before Ford began the first visit to Japan by a U.S.
president, about 6000 flag-waving, snake-dancing students
chanting "stop Ford" milled around a park two miles from
the airport.
In downtown Tokyo, a group of 200 South Koreans
opposed to the rule of President Chung Hee Park loudly
protested Ford's scheduled stop in Seoul after he leaves
Japan.
Twenty-five thousand police—7o percent of the
39,000-strong Tokyo force—were placed on full alert hours
before the touchdown of the presidential jet carrying Ford
and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. Another
100,000 police were on stand-by orders in other parts of
Japan.
Ford is on a nine-day, 16,555 mile journey that also will
take him to a meeting with Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev in Vladivostok.
A helicopter was waiting at the airport to take Ford and
his party from the airport to the state guest house, where
the President will spend the night. He is to meet the
emperor tomorrow morning.
During a stopover in Anchorage, Alaska, Ford declared
he would "rather travel thousands of miles for peace than
take a single step toward war."
Before leaving Washington for Japan he told well-wishers
he was "determined to perpetuate the special relationship
that links our two nations for the common good."
Demos Say They May Vote For Rocky
WASHINGTON The chairman and another leading

Democratic member of the Senate committee probing the
vice presidential nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller say
they expect to vote for the nomination.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) said yesterday that
"on the basis of what I know now, if nothing else develops,
I will vote for him." Appearing on ABC's Issues and
Answers , the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee
praised Rockefeller's administrative ability and said that
while Rockefeller served as governor of New York there
were no indications of conflict of interest.
Cannon said he hoped to complete hearings on the
nomination today and have the committee vote by next
week, which would mean the matter could be voted on by
the entire Senate right after the Thanksgiving recess.
Cannon predicted the committee would approve the
nomination and predicted the Senate also will vote to
confirm the nomination.
The House Judiciary Committee begins hearings on the
Rockefeller nomination later this week.
Saxbe: FBI Failed To Report
WASHINGTON Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe said
yesterday the FBI apparently failed to report regularly to
the attorney general on the counter-intelligence program it
aimed at radical and extremist groups.
He said a report on the counter-intelligence operation,
revealed over the weekend, would be discussed today but
he did not say whether it would be released by the Justice
Department.
Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, Saxbe said there
is currently no such program in operation. But he declined
to discuss in detail reports that the FBI ran such a program
for 15 years.
Asked whether any attorney general had been aware of
the program, Saxbe said "I can't be sure ... As far as direct
regular reports, I don't think so."
According to a draft of an FBI report, the program was
aimed at the New Left, black extremists, white hate groups,
the Socialist Workers party and the U.S. Communist Party.
Although he said no such program is now in operation,
Saxbe warned that it could develop.
"It could always develop," he said. "You could have
Watergate happen again, you could have all these things
happen if the people in the Congress aren't interested."
But, Saxbe added that the answer is continual vigilance
and "I'm not worried about it happening while I'm here."
Russia Sends Warships To Syria
TEL AVIV Pro-guerrilla riots erupted on the West
Bank of Jordan for the second straight day yesterday, two
bombs exploded in Jerusalem, and the Kremlin announced
it was sending three warships to Syria on an "official,
friendly visit."
Israeli Defense Minister Shimon Peres told the cabinet in
Jerusalem the tension which prompted a partial Israeli
mobilization has died down, but that the military was
keeping a close watch on Syrian moves.
Haim Herzog a military analyst for the state radio, said
if Syria fails to. renew the U.N. peacekeeping mandate on
the Golan Heights new fighting could break out.
No casualties were reported in the Jerusalem blasts,
which shook an apartment complex. Police said one of
them caused minor damage and the state radio said 40
suspected Arab guerrillas were arrested.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness with rain likely. Partly cloudy
today "with chance of showers. Fair tonight and tomorrow.
Slightly cooler today and tonight. Lows tonight in the 40s.

The IRS has refused for more than a year to name the
organizations, which include such nationally known groups
as the Americans for Democratic Action, National Student
Association, the Urban League and Unitarian Society.
The groups were named in more than 200 pages of
documents made public yesterday as a result of a Freedom
of Information Act suit filed against the tax agency by
Ralph Nader's Tax Reform Research Group.
The documents reveal that, contrary to repeated public
denials by the IRS, the secret Special Service Staff was set
up as an intelligence-gathering unit within the IRS as a
direct result of White House influence in 1969.
It began as a project to identify activist organizations
and individuals for possible income tax audits and
collection of unpaid taxes.
The present IRS commissioner, Donald C. Alexander,
and other agency spokesmen have insisted for the past year
the IRS never succumbed to the political pressures of the
Nixon White House.
The documents show that even as the Special Service
Staff was being disbanded last year in the midst of the
Watergate scandal, Alexander attempted to conceal the true
activities of the unit by claiming it had been set up solely to
investigate tax protesters and people who refused to pay
income tax.
By the time it was abolished, the organization had
collected files in 11,458 individuals and groups, most of
whom still have not been identified. The IRS is refusing to
reveal what has become on the top secret files.
Ford Visits Japan Amid Tight Security
TOKYO President Ford arrived this afternoon Tokyo
time for a historic five-day visit to Japan amid security
precautions so tight that neither Emperor Hirohito nor
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was at Haneda International
Airport to greet him.
Before Ford began the first visit to Japan by a U.S.
president, about 6000 flag-waving, snake-dancing students
chanting "stop Ford" milled around a park two miles from
the airport.
In downtown Tokyo, a group of 200 South Koreans
opposed to the rule of President Chung Hee Park loudly
protested Ford's scheduled stop in Seoul after he leaves
Japan.
Twenty-five thousand police—7o percent of the
39,000-strong Tokyo force—were placed on full alert hours
before the touchdown of the presidential jet carrying Ford
and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. Another
100,000 police were on stand-by orders in other parts of
Japan.
Ford is on a nine-day, 16,555 mile journey that also will
take him to a meeting with Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev in Vladivostok.
A helicopter was waiting at the airport to take Ford and
his party from the airport to the state guest house, where
the President will spend the night. He is to meet the
emperor tomorrow morning.
During a stopover in Anchorage, Alaska, Ford declared
he would "rather travel thousands of miles for peace than
take a single step toward war."
Before leaving Washington for Japan he told well-wishers
he was "determined to perpetuate the special relationship
that links our two nations for the common good."
Demos Say They May Vote For Rocky
WASHINGTON The chairman and another leading

Democratic member of the Senate committee probing the
vice presidential nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller say
they expect to vote for the nomination.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) said yesterday that
"on the basis of what I know now, if nothing else develops,
I will vote for him." Appearing on ABC's Issues and
Answers , the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee
praised Rockefeller's administrative ability and said that
while Rockefeller served as governor of New York there
were no indications of conflict of interest.
Cannon said he hoped to complete hearings on the
nomination today and have the committee vote by next
week, which would mean the matter could be voted on by
the entire Senate right after the Thanksgiving recess.
Cannon predicted the committee would approve the
nomination and predicted the Senate also will vote to
confirm the nomination.
The House Judiciary Committee begins hearings on the
Rockefeller nomination later this week.
Saxbe: FBI Failed To Report
WASHINGTON Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe said
yesterday the FBI apparently failed to report regularly to
the attorney general on the counter-intelligence program it
aimed at radical and extremist groups.
He said a report on the counter-intelligence operation,
revealed over the weekend, would be discussed today but
he did not say whether it would be released by the Justice
Department.
Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, Saxbe said there
is currently no such program in operation. But he declined
to discuss in detail reports that the FBI ran such a program
for 15 years.
Asked whether any attorney general had been aware of
the program, Saxbe said "I can't be sure ... As far as direct
regular reports, I don't think so."
According to a draft of an FBI report, the program was
aimed at the New Left, black extremists, white hate groups,
the Socialist Workers party and the U.S. Communist Party.
Although he said no such program is now in operation,
Saxbe warned that it could develop.
"It could always develop," he said. "You could have
Watergate happen again, you could have all these things
happen if the people in the Congress aren't interested."
But, Saxbe added that the answer is continual vigilance
and "I'm not worried about it happening while I'm here."
Russia Sends Warships To Syria
TEL AVIV Pro-guerrilla riots erupted on the West

Association, the Urban League and Unitarian Society.
The groups were named in more than 200 pages of
documents made public yesterday as a result of a Freedom
of Information Act suit filed against the tax agency by
Ralph Nader's Tax Reform Research Group.
The documents reveal that, contrary to repeated public
denials by the IRS, the secret Special Service Staff was set
up as an intelligence-gathering unit within the IRS as a
direct result of White House influence in 1969.
It began as a project to identify activist organizations
and individuals for possible income tax audits and
collection of unpaid taxes.
The present IRS commissioner, Donald C. Alexander,
and other agency spokesmen have insisted for the past year
the IRS never succumbed to the political pressures of the
Nixon White House.
The documents show that even as the Special Service
Staff was being disbanded last year in the midst of the
Watergate scandal, Alexander attempted to conceal the true
activities of the unit by claiming it had been set up solely to
investigate tax protesters and people who refused to pay
income tax.
By the time it was abolished, the organization had
collected files in 11,458 individuals and groups, most of
whom still have not been identified. The IRS is refusing to
reveal what has become on the top secret files.
Ford Visits Japan Amid Tight Security
TOKYO President Ford arrived this afternoon Tokyo
time for a historic five-day visit to Japan amid security
precautions so tight that neither Emperor Hirohito nor
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was at Haneda International
Airport to greet him.
Before Ford began the first visit to Japan by a U.S.
president, about 6000 flag-waving, snake-dancing students
chanting "stop Ford" milled around a park two miles from
the airport.
In downtown Tokyo, a group of 200 South Koreans
opposed to the rule of President Chung Hee Park loudly
protested Ford's scheduled stop in Seoul after he leaves
Japan.
Twenty-five thousand police—7o percent of the
39,000-strong Tokyo force—were placed on full alert hours
before the touchdown of the presidential jet carrying Ford
and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. Another
100,000 police were on stand-by orders in other parts of
Japan.
Ford is on a nine-day, 16,555 mile journey that also will
take him to a meeting with Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev in Vladivostok.
A helicopter was waiting at the airport to take Ford and
his party from the airport to the state guest house, where
the President will spend the night. He is to meet the
emperor tomorrow morning.
During a stopover in Anchorage, Alaska, Ford declared
he would "rather travel thousands of miles for peace than
take a single step toward war."
Before leaving Washington for Japan he told well-wishers
he was "determined to perpetuate the special relationship
that links our two nations for the common good."
Demos Say They May Vote For Rocky
WASHINGTON The chairman and another leading

Democratic member of the Senate committee probing the
vice presidential nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller say
they expect to vote for the nomination.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) said yesterday that
"on the basis of what I know now, if nothing else develops,
I will vote for him." Appearing on ABC's Issues and
Answers , the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee
praised Rockefeller's administrative ability and said that
while Rockefeller served as governor of New York there
were no indications of conflict of interest.
Cannon said he hoped to complete hearings on the
nomination today and have the committee vote by next
week, which would mean the matter could be voted on by
the entire Senate right after the Thanksgiving recess.
Cannon predicted the committee would approve the
nomination and predicted the Senate also will vote to
confirm the nomination.
The House Judiciary Committee begins hearings on the
Rockefeller nomination later this week.
Saxbe: FBI Failed To Report
WASHINGTON Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe said
yesterday the FBI apparently failed to report regularly to
the attorney general on the counter-intelligence program it
aimed at radical and extremist groups.
He said a report on the counter-intelligence operation,
revealed over the weekend, would be discussed today but
he did not say whether it would be released by the Justice
Department.
Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, Saxbe said there
is currently no such program in operation. But he declined
to discuss in detail reports that the FBI ran such a program
for 15 years.
Asked whether any attorney general had been aware of
the program, Saxbe said "I can't be sure ... As far as direct
regular reports, I don't think so."
According to a draft of an FBI report, the program was
aimed at the New Left, black extremists, white hate groups,
the Socialist Workers party and the U.S. Communist Party.
Although he said no such program is now in operation,
Saxbe warned that it could develop.
"It could always develop," he said. "You could have
Watergate happen again, you could have all these things
happen if the people in the Congress aren't interested."
But, Saxbe added that the answer is continual vigilance
and "I'm not worried about it happening while I'm here."
