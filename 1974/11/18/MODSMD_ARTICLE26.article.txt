# Marine World Night
## ASSU Benefit Breaks Even 
### GORDON FIRESTEIN 
Stanford night at Marine World,
held Oct. 5 to benefit the Optacon
Fund, Operation Share and the Black
Student Center, just broke even,
according to event coordinator Rocky
Barber.
Barber originally had announced
that the ASSU made a $5O profit but
last week he discovered that figure was
based on a "miscalculation."
"It was a blunder on my part,"
Barber said. He said he thought the
ASSU would receive from Marine
World 90 cents for every $4 ticket
sold, when Marine World had actually
agreed to give the ASSU only 25 cents

per ticket.
The ASSU incurred expenses of
$620 in organizing the event, Barber
said. Since 720 people attended, the
ASSU was supposed to receive only
$lBO from the gate receipts, instead of
the $648 Barber had anticipated.
Barber met with Marine World
marketing representative Mike
Gallagher Friday, and Gallagher agreed
to allow the ASSU a percentage of the
receipts large enough to cover its
expenses.
Barber notified the intended
beneficiaries of the event that no
funds had been raised. "That's what I

felt the worst about," he said.
Barber said he had "simply
misunderstood" the original
arrangements with Marine World, and
had made an honest mistake in basing
his calculations on 90 cents per ticket.
No written contract had been
drafted, and it was only Friday, he
said, that he saw the correct figures for
the first time.
"If I had known we were only
supposed to receive 25 cents per
ticket," Barber said, "I would have
cancelled the event. All I can do now,"
he added, "is chalk it up to
experience."
