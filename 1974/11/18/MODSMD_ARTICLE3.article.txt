# Millions Starving
## Profs Analyze Food Crisis 
### PHILIP FEDER 
By conservative estimates, at least 460 million people are
threatened with starvation today. Ten million will probably
die this year most of them children under five years old.
The United Nations-sponsored World Food Conference
ended talks on short and long run solutions to the global
problem in Rome last week, prompting comment from
professors at the Food Research Institute here.
Asst. Prof. C. Peter Timmer said the conference will
"achieve an understanding that major new policies are
needed" to increase food production in the less-developed
countries.
In the final day of talks, the conference set up a World
Food Council to direct the fight against hunger because
"every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to
be free from hunger and malnutrition."
The new world food agency will have its headquarters in
Rome. It will supervise aid and investment in food
production in needy countries.
1000 Attend Meeting
About 1000 delegates from some 100 nations and a
dozen international organizations gathered for the
conference.
The overriding concern, Timmer said, was to make the
Third World countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
some of the African nations "self-sufficient" in food
production.
However, bad weather conditions in 1972 halted any
immediate chances for self-sufficiency. Monsoons in India
and extended drought in the Sahel were two such instances,
he explained.
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger delivered the
keynote address to the conference. "We are faced not just
with the problem of food but with the accelerating
momentum of our interdependence," Kissinger said. "The
contemporary agenda of energy, food and inflation exceeds
the capacity of any single government, or even of a few
governments together, to resolve."
Contribution May Triple
Kissinger said the United States was willing to triple its

research contribution from $3O million to about $lOO
million a year by 1980, but he emphasized the financial
burden of sustaining the food deficit countries was too
great to be borne by any single country.
When the United States supplies grains to the-stricken
areas, Timmer explained, Americans can expect a "rise of
three to five points in the cost of living index."
In 1973 and 1974, food price increases contributed "to
more than half of the total increase in the cost of living,"
wrote Timmer and Food Research Institute Director Walter
P. Falcon in the fall/winter Stanford Magazine.
Food Research Institute Prof. Roger W. Gray submitted
a paper to the World Food Conference that, according to
Timmer, was looked at "very hard" by long run planners.
Gray suggested that a buffer stock of grain be located in
the United States where the most surpluses exist.
U.S. Grain Monopoly
Even with the recent domestic crop failures, "we [the
United States] have a greater monopoly of grain than the
Arabs do of oil," Timmer said. "What we do is the critical
issue. If we continue to supply grains, then the other
nations will follow suit."
In the less-developed countries, the "only way to solve
the food production problem" in the long run is with
"significant progress in population control," Timmer said.
"Starvation is one way to control population, the more
humane way is population control."
The United States restricted aid to needy countries after
the U.S. Russian wheat deal in 1972, according to
Timmer. At that time, the U.S. reserve stock was "wiped
out."
"After the deal, the United States depended on a run of
three years to 'get off of the razor's edge ' " he said. 1973
was a reasonably good crop year, but 1974 was disastrous.
The Russians oppose a reserve system that would
preclude any bargain deals with the western grain
producers. The 1972 wheat bought from the Americans was
"used for livestock consumption" and not for humans,
Timmer said.

million a year by 1980, but he emphasized the financial
burden of sustaining the food deficit countries was too
great to be borne by any single country.
When the United States supplies grains to the-stricken
areas, Timmer explained, Americans can expect a "rise of
three to five points in the cost of living index."
In 1973 and 1974, food price increases contributed "to
more than half of the total increase in the cost of living,"
wrote Timmer and Food Research Institute Director Walter
P. Falcon in the fall/winter Stanford Magazine.
Food Research Institute Prof. Roger W. Gray submitted
a paper to the World Food Conference that, according to
Timmer, was looked at "very hard" by long run planners.
Gray suggested that a buffer stock of grain be located in
the United States where the most surpluses exist.
U.S. Grain Monopoly
Even with the recent domestic crop failures, "we [the
United States] have a greater monopoly of grain than the
Arabs do of oil," Timmer said. "What we do is the critical
issue. If we continue to supply grains, then the other
nations will follow suit."
In the less-developed countries, the "only way to solve
the food production problem" in the long run is with
"significant progress in population control," Timmer said.
"Starvation is one way to control population, the more
humane way is population control."
The United States restricted aid to needy countries after
the U.S. Russian wheat deal in 1972, according to
Timmer. At that time, the U.S. reserve stock was "wiped
out."
"After the deal, the United States depended on a run of
three years to 'get off of the razor's edge ' " he said. 1973
was a reasonably good crop year, but 1974 was disastrous.
The Russians oppose a reserve system that would
preclude any bargain deals with the western grain
producers. The 1972 wheat bought from the Americans was
"used for livestock consumption" and not for humans,
Timmer said.
By conservative estimates, at least 460 million people are
threatened with starvation today. Ten million will probably
die this year most of them children under five years old.
The United Nations-sponsored World Food Conference
ended talks on short and long run solutions to the global
problem in Rome last week, prompting comment from
professors at the Food Research Institute here.
Asst. Prof. C. Peter Timmer said the conference will
"achieve an understanding that major new policies are
needed" to increase food production in the less-developed
countries.
In the final day of talks, the conference set up a World
Food Council to direct the fight against hunger because
"every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to
be free from hunger and malnutrition."
The new world food agency will have its headquarters in
Rome. It will supervise aid and investment in food
production in needy countries.
1000 Attend Meeting
About 1000 delegates from some 100 nations and a
dozen international organizations gathered for the
conference.
The overriding concern, Timmer said, was to make the
Third World countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
some of the African nations "self-sufficient" in food
production.
However, bad weather conditions in 1972 halted any
immediate chances for self-sufficiency. Monsoons in India
and extended drought in the Sahel were two such instances,
he explained.
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger delivered the
keynote address to the conference. "We are faced not just
with the problem of food but with the accelerating
momentum of our interdependence," Kissinger said. "The
contemporary agenda of energy, food and inflation exceeds
the capacity of any single government, or even of a few
governments together, to resolve."
Contribution May Triple
Kissinger said the United States was willing to triple its

research contribution from $3O million to about $lOO
million a year by 1980, but he emphasized the financial
burden of sustaining the food deficit countries was too
great to be borne by any single country.
