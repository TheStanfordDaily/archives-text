# Starr To Leave Jan. 1 After Two-Year Stay
## Tresidder Head Announces Resignation 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Gordon Starr, general manager of
Tresidder Memorial Union (TMU),
announced to his staff Thursday that
he plans to resign Jan. 1, the Daily
learned yesterday.
Starr, contacted late last night, said
his decision has nothing to do with
any dissatisfaction with Tresidder.
Starr was plagued with a $300,000 deficit
when he joined the TMU
administration two years ago.
Starr explained that he has been
offered a job which has interested him
for a long time. He will work for
Earhard Seminars Training (EST), a
"personal growth center" in San
Francisco.
Assoc. Dean of Students Daniel

Williams said Starr's announcement
would not affect the present
reorganization of Tresidder.
University officials closed the
Tresidder cafeteria last August because
of large financial losses and reopened
in September with The Transition.
Starr said he will complete his work
on the future of the TMU Food
Service before he leaves.
Overseeing Budget
After January, Starr's
responsibilities, which include
overseeing TMU's budget, will be
reallocated among TMU officials,
Williams said.
Starr remarked that his departure
would allow the "strong group of
people" managing the various parts of
the Union to "take on more
responsibility."
He explained that his leaving is
actually beneficial because "the
non-retail programming side—Campus
Affairs Office will be brought together
with the retail side."
Precarious
Starr also said he is not deserting
the TMU administration with its
precarious 1974-75 budget. He
remarked that TMU is already SIO,OOC

ahead of its budget for this year.
Williams said the TMU
administration would decide in June
whether to hire someone to replace
Starr.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons commended Starr for doing "a
superb job" as TMU manager. "He's
reducing the deficit and turning it
around," Lyons remarked.
'ln The Wind'
He added that Starr's desire to leave

his position "has been in the wind for
a long time." Williams said that no one
pressured Starr to resign.
Lyons named Starr as general
manager in January, 1973 when
Forrest Tregea resigned from his
position as TMU director.
He started his new job after being
appointed TMU financial manager in
June, 1972 Starr replaced former
business manager Phil Duffy, who was
reportedly forced out of his job.

He added that Starr's desire to leave

his position "has been in the wind for
a long time." Williams said that no one
pressured Starr to resign.
Lyons named Starr as general
manager in January, 1973 when
Forrest Tregea resigned from his
position as TMU director.
He started his new job after being
appointed TMU financial manager in
June, 1972 Starr replaced former
business manager Phil Duffy, who was
reportedly forced out of his job.

Gordon Starr, general manager of
Tresidder Memorial Union (TMU),
announced to his staff Thursday that
he plans to resign Jan. 1, the Daily
learned yesterday.
Starr, contacted late last night, said
his decision has nothing to do with
any dissatisfaction with Tresidder.
Starr was plagued with a $300,000 deficit
when he joined the TMU
administration two years ago.
Starr explained that he has been
offered a job which has interested him
for a long time. He will work for
Earhard Seminars Training (EST), a
"personal growth center" in San
Francisco.
Assoc. Dean of Students Daniel

Williams said Starr's announcement
would not affect the present
reorganization of Tresidder.
University officials closed the
Tresidder cafeteria last August because
of large financial losses and reopened
in September with The Transition.
Starr said he will complete his work
on the future of the TMU Food
Service before he leaves.
Overseeing Budget
After January, Starr's
responsibilities, which include
overseeing TMU's budget, will be
reallocated among TMU officials,
Williams said.
Starr remarked that his departure
would allow the "strong group of
people" managing the various parts of
the Union to "take on more
responsibility."
He explained that his leaving is
actually beneficial because "the
non-retail programming side—Campus
Affairs Office will be brought together
with the retail side."
Precarious
Starr also said he is not deserting
the TMU administration with its
precarious 1974-75 budget. He
remarked that TMU is already SIO,OOC

ahead of its budget for this year.
Williams said the TMU
administration would decide in June
whether to hire someone to replace
Starr.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons commended Starr for doing "a
superb job" as TMU manager. "He's
reducing the deficit and turning it
around," Lyons remarked.
