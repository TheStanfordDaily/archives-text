# 400 Undergrads Linger On Housing Waiting List
## 
### CECILE HEROLD 
Four hundred undergraduate
students are currently registered on
the winter quarter waiting list for
on-campus housing, Sue Espinosa,
administrative assistant to the dean of
student affairs, reported yesterday.
The waiting list figure which
includes 250 men and 150 women
was tabulated from the results of last
Friday's waiting list confirmations.
"By Friday's confirmation deadline,
off-campus students had either
confirmed their waiting list position
for the upcoming quarter, deferred
their request for on-campus housing to
spring quarter, or removed their names
from the list all together," Espinosa
said.
Twenty-eight men and 21 women
postponed on-campus housing requests
until spring quarter, according to
Espinosa. "They lose nothing by
deferment, because we work not on a
first come, first serve basis, but
according to the date of original
application," she said. "The students
who deferred take the same relative
position on the spring quarter list as
they would have on the winter quarter
list."
Seventeen men and six women
decided to drop from the waiting list
all together, Espinosa said, adding that
the housing office removed the names
of about 70 students who failed to
meet Friday's confirmation deadline.
110 Places Open
Espinosa noted that about 110
students were certain of placement
because some 50 men and 60 women
are leaving for overseas this quarter.
She added that just 33 students would
be returning from overseas with
on-campus housing requests, making a
fortunate imbalance for those on the

waiting list.
"This list is comprised of
undergraduates already living on
campus who would like to transfer to
another on-campus residence," she said. "We
now have 60 men and 110 women on
the list. Primarily they are Stern,
Wilbur' and Manzanita residents
requesting assignments to the Row and
special sign-up houses."
The housing office places a freeze
on the on-campus transfer list during
the first two weeks of each quarter in
order to concentrate on placing
off-campus students.
Neither of the lists involving on â€”or
off-campus students involves graduate
students. "The graduate students
occupy separate spaces in Crothers or
Escondido Village. They are not vying
for the same places," Espinosa
explained. "However, I would like to
consider the graduate students'
situation more closely because,
proportionately, their housing
predicament is as bad as that of the
undergraduates."
"At this point, it is difficult to
assess whether the undergraduates'
waiting list situation has improved
since last quarter," Espinosa
continued. "We aren't certain yet of
the total number of vacancies we have
to work with and thus the number of
students we can place during winter
quarter."
Espinosa said the housing office
will begin making new winter quarter
assignments as soon as the termination
deadline has passed, "starting at six
o'clock Friday evening." Students
have until 5 p.m. Friday to tell the
Housing Office of plans to move
off-campus, although the office
requests their notice as soon as
possible.
