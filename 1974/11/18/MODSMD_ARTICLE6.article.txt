# Support Co-Op
## 
### Carter, Makey, Friedmann 
There has been a great deal of
controversy lately in the Daily
over the relative merits of both
the Record Co-op proposal and
the co-op's fee assessment. We
would like to clear up the
controversy and put the fee
assessment into the proper
context.
We propose to take over record
sales at the Bookstore and make
three improvements over the
current Bookstore offering: 1)
lower prices 18 cents to as
much as 50 cents (during sale
periods) below the Bookstore's
current low prices; 2) increase the
selection, display and inventory
of records; and 3) vastly increase
record advertising.
These lowered prices will be by
far the best around, better than
Banana and Discount. By
increasing the selection by 50
percent and improving the
display, we hope that a student
will be able to quickly find any
record. Finally, advertising on
campus will keep everyone aware
of the improved offering.
In themselves, these three
improvements constitute a better
service to students; but they also
constitute the ~ basis of our
predicted increase in sales.
Obviously, lower prices alone will
not attract many more sales, but
lower prices combined with a
more thorough collection of
records, a better display of that
collection and increased
advertising of its existence should
cause sales to jump.
How much they might jump
cannot be accurately predicted, as
we cannot afford a sufficiently
accurate market survey. However,
our critics have agreed with us
that should the assessment pass, it
would indicate the existence of a
sufficient market to support the
co-op. That means that one
should vote for the fee assessment

if one wants lower prices and
increased selection on campus.
In truth, the fee assessment is a
good investment for anybody
wanting cheaper records. Much of
the controversy has been a
misunderstanding as to the
per-record saving. This saving will
be at least 18 cents during
non-sale periods (it may be even
more if initial sales are good
enough) and at least 50 cents
during sale periods. Therefore, the
purchase of two to five records
will recoup the assessment.
Finally, there is a greater
concept at stake here: the
eventual establishment of a
general, student-merchandise store
on campus. As much as this
proposal and fee assessment are
concerned with the specifics of a
record co-op, if successful, it will
also set in motion the initiative
and machinery for a discount
store offering merchandise of
particular interest to Stanford
students.
The Bookstore has not yet had
either the initiative, the money, or
the space to offer stereos,
backpacks, bicycles, or camping
equipment. The establishment of
the co-op will assure student
initiative for such a general,
student-merchandise co-op.
Therefore, as much as students
should vote in this election
primarily with their desire for a
wider selection of lower-priced
records on campus in mind, they
should also not forget that the
greater concept underlying this
proposal may be forced into
hibernation for another two or
three years if not enough people
indicate an interest in the co-op in
the referendum.
