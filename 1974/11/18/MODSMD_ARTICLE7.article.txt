# Voting Is Needed

### Mike Herman 
Don Cox's news analysis, "Fee
Proposals May Be
Undeservedâ€”But Who Cares?"?"
(Daily Nov. 15) is an obvious case
of a rational and concerned idea
carried to dangerously irrational
and negativistic proportions.
Cox feels, as do many members
of the ASSU government, that the
ease with which organizations and
causes are capable of passing fee
assessments to facilitate the
creation or expansion of those
services has become ludicrous in
its excess.
I too have my own doubts
about some of the $1
assessments that have been
approved by the student body in
recent years, given considerations
of the necessity of that large an
amount of money being given to
any one group and of the
responsibility of that group to
handle the expenditure of that
money with the efficiency
students trust they will.
Yet, Cox concludes that the
best way of deterring
organizations and groups from
gaining assessments and, in fact,
from even attempting to pass an
assessment is to refuse to vote
when such an election occurs,
with the hope that, if enough
fellow students follow suit, the
election will not receive the
required 20 percent of the eligible
student body voting to pass any
assessment.
Cox would have the students
consider carefully the "soundness
and merits of proposed projects,"
and to grant money to "services
that truly deserve the financial
backing and support." I doubt
that a rational person could
disagree with such a statement.
Yet, the manner in which Cox has
deigned correct for effectively
blocking the misallocation of
funds is by not voting.

Why then do many of those
who sign petitions to place an
issue on the ballot do so with the
explicit and laudable intent of
providing that issue its fair place
before the student body?
To exhort the student body to
refrain from voting is a call to
reject the democratic process
upon which elections for student
body positions and issues are
based, as well as a call for the
further impotence and inertia that
has plagued ASSU in the past. If
students do not vote, they have
surrendered their most valuable
weapon for dealing with forces
with which, as individuals, they
stand little chance of dealing
effectively. Particularly with fee
assessments, if students do not
vote, one of the most effective
and necessary means of acquiring
the requisite funds for operating
the ASSU and its many
organizations is lost.

Especially in times such as
these, when the constraints of an
inflated University budget seek to
overwhelm the cash inflow to the
University, the ASSU stands in
even greater need of support by
the students, both politically and
financially. In two years, when
the ASSU will be forced to
renegotiate its budget with the
Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs, as it must every other
year, predictions are that its
budget may be cut anywhere from
50-100 percent. At that point,
many of the Services offered by
the ASSU which students have
come to take for granted and
upon which many are dependent
(Travel Service, Special Events,
Sunday Flicks, etc.) as Well as all
the smaller organizations under
the umbrella of the ASSU will be
in dire need of funds to survive.
