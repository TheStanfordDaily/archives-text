STAY AT STANFORD
NEXT SUMMER
(June 21 - August 14)
While you're pre-registering for Winter Quarter, think
about next summer.... maybe you'll want to plan for it....
Will you be only a few units short of graduation?
Will you be behind in distribution requirements?
Do you need to pick up a course in math, or physics, or
biology? (Bio majors and pre-meds 24S will be offered
during Summer IS)
Do you want to learn a language or take that studio art
course or dance class instead of being on the wait-list for it —
or take the creative writing course that never seemed to fit
into your schedule or study Beckett at the Summer '75
Samuel Beckett Workshop?????
Maybe you'll want to have time to enjoy your studies (uji
dergrads may take as few as eight units) or work part time
while you take some courses?
5 ink about it ■• ■ and on Reg. Day in January, come by the
Summer Session desk in the Pavillion to see what courses are
being offered
