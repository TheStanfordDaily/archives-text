# At Emeriti Project Site
## Demolition Almost Complete 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Demolition of the old Stanford
Elementary School is being completed
this week, making way for the
controversial emeriti housing project,
according to Robert Summers,
director of faculty housing.
The 82-unit Pearce Mitchell
complex is expected to be completed
on schedule by autumn 1975,
Summers said. Site grading and utility
installation will begin later this week.
Summers explained that site
grading, which must be completed
before construction can actually begin,
includes adjusting internal roads and
deciding which trees and old school

walls should be retained.
Cost Stable
Although no contract has been
signed with the project's builders,
Summers noted that all bids have been
submitted and that inflation is not
expected to raise the project's cost
beyond the anticipated $3.9 million.
Summers said that a "myriad of
details" must be settled before a
contract can be signed.
Although the project was originally
planned to include 100 units, the
Board of Trustees in June scaled it
down to 82 despite a demand for
considerably more.
A survey early this year indicated a
market for 182 households. Summers
said yesterday that about 100 families
have signed waiting lists.
Housing Draw

Available units will be allocated
through a housing draw to be held in
January, Summers said.
Assignments will not be completely
arbitrary, however. Senior faculty will
receive special preference, Summers
said.
"Seniority is defined by age and
not rank," Summers emphasized.
Although Summers claims there is
"sustained enthusiasm" among senior
faculty for the project, he noted that
it is still possible that enough emeriti
will withdraw requests for housing
that there will be no shortage.
The local child care center displaced
by the demolition of the school has
been relocated in "new facilities well
tailored to [its] needs" on Pampus
Lane, according to Summers.
The emeriti project, to be located
on Mayfield Avenue, created a
controversy last winter when Row
residents claimed that the complex
was incompatible with the neighborhood.
Although Edward Shaw, executive
assistant to the provost, assured Row
residents that the project would bQ
constructed in traditional architecture
in harmony with the area Row houses,
area residents complained that the

presence of elderly people would
interfere with student activities.
In a student referendum held
during winter quarter, 96 percent of
voters opposed placing the project on
the Row, and President Lyman
promised to review the plans for
placing the complex there.
However, he approved the project's
location on June 11 after receiving
favorable recommendations from
Summers and Shaw.
Shaw later explained that they
chose the Row site because every
other area had a higher demand for
another project than the site.
Summers noted yesterday that the
project's planners are pleased to have
decided on a name for the project,
choosing to name it in honor of Pearce
Mitchell, a former professor and
registrar here.

down to 82 despite a demand for
considerably more.
A survey early this year indicated a
market for 182 households. Summers
said yesterday that about 100 families
have signed waiting lists.
Housing Draw

Available units will be allocated
through a housing draw to be held in
January, Summers said.
Assignments will not be completely
arbitrary, however. Senior faculty will
receive special preference, Summers
said.
"Seniority is defined by age and
not rank," Summers emphasized.
Although Summers claims there is
"sustained enthusiasm" among senior
faculty for the project, he noted that
it is still possible that enough emeriti
will withdraw requests for housing
that there will be no shortage.
The local child care center displaced
by the demolition of the school has
been relocated in "new facilities well
tailored to [its] needs" on Pampus
Lane, according to Summers.
The emeriti project, to be located
on Mayfield Avenue, created a
controversy last winter when Row
residents claimed that the complex
was incompatible with the neighborhood.
Although Edward Shaw, executive
assistant to the provost, assured Row
residents that the project would bQ
constructed in traditional architecture
in harmony with the area Row houses,
area residents complained that the

presence of elderly people would
interfere with student activities.
In a student referendum held
during winter quarter, 96 percent of
voters opposed placing the project on
the Row, and President Lyman
promised to review the plans for
placing the complex there.
However, he approved the project's
location on June 11 after receiving
favorable recommendations from
Summers and Shaw.
Shaw later explained that they
chose the Row site because every
other area had a higher demand for
another project than the site.
Summers noted yesterday that the
project's planners are pleased to have
decided on a name for the project,
choosing to name it in honor of Pearce
Mitchell, a former professor and
registrar here.

MAKE WAY—Now that the child care center has been relocated, demolition of the old Stanford Elementary School is
underway. The earth mover above is clearing the way for the new emeriti housing project.
Demolition of the old Stanford
Elementary School is being completed
this week, making way for the
controversial emeriti housing project,
according to Robert Summers,
director of faculty housing.
The 82-unit Pearce Mitchell
complex is expected to be completed
on schedule by autumn 1975,
Summers said. Site grading and utility
installation will begin later this week.
Summers explained that site
grading, which must be completed
before construction can actually begin,
includes adjusting internal roads and
deciding which trees and old school

walls should be retained.
Cost Stable
Although no contract has been
signed with the project's builders,
Summers noted that all bids have been
submitted and that inflation is not
expected to raise the project's cost
beyond the anticipated $3.9 million.
Summers said that a "myriad of
details" must be settled before a
contract can be signed.
Although the project was originally
planned to include 100 units, the
Board of Trustees in June scaled it
down to 82 despite a demand for
considerably more.
