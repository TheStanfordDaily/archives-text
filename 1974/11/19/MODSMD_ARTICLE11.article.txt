# U.S. Violates Chrome Sanctions
## 
### Stephen Carter 
Early on the morning of June 9, 1973,
Baltimore longshoremen were routinely
unloading cargo from a ship docked in that
port.
A few hours later, every worker had
walked off the job.
Why? Because a then loosely knit coalition
of officials and activists had in the interim
informed the longshoremen that the ship
carried chrome imported from Rhodesia in
violation of United Nations sanctions against
that nation.
Once they learned this, the workers
became "unanimous in their feelings,"
against unloading, according to William Haile,
international vice president of the
International Longshoremen's Union.
Rep. Parren Mitchell (D-Md.), among
others, has since that time supported the
longshoremen in their refusal to unload any
ships carrying Rhodesian chrome. Other
groups, including the Friends Service
Committee and African Liberation Support
Committee, have tried to extend the boycott
to the entire East Coast.
What has led to this controversy?
Trade Prohibited
Although the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 253 prohibited trade
with Rhodesia, the United States has been
able to import chrome from that nation since
the passage of the Byrd amendment in
September, 1971. The Byrd amendment,
which explicitly prohibited governmental
enforcement of U.N. sanctions in cases of
national security or national emergency, was
intended, according to its sponsor, to reduce
American dependence on chrome from the
Soviet Union.
As a result, the United States joined
Portugal and South Africa as the only nations
in violation of the sanctions. No evidence was
ever presented to support charges that the
Soviet Union violated the sanctions regularly.

Since that time, Reps. Charles Diggs
(D-Mich.) and Donald Fraser (D-Minn.)
have led the fight in Congress to repeal the
amendment. But so far, they have failed.
Although the Senate has voted to repeal
the amendment, such attempts have
repeatedly collapsed in the House of
Representatives. As usual, cries of
"Communism!" have made most
representatives impervious to evidence or
logical consistency.
Usual Arguments
The arguments usually advanced to
support the Byrd amendment are:
—that the amendment reduces American
dependence on the Soviet Union, a
"potential enemy," for chrome;
—that the imports help preserve the
stability of the United States ferrochrome
industry;
—that the chrome is necessary for
America's defense; and
—that after all, even serveral African
countries violate the sanctions.
Every argument falls down.
Since the Byrd Amendment's passage,
U.S. reliance on Soviet chrome which,
according to official government reports, is
some of the best available in the world has
more than doubled from 24 to 51 percent of
total imports. Moreover, 20 nations other
than the Soviet Union export chrome of a
grade comparable to Rhodesia's at cheaper
prices.
Ferrochrome Industry
And the ferrochrome industry in the
United States has been hurt , not helped.
According to a U.S. Ferroalloys Association
study released in May, 1973,19 ferrochrome
plants in this country have been endangered
by the import of Rhodesian chrome. Four
such companies have laid off some 30
percent of their workers.
For its part, the Defense Department says

the current chrome stockpile is adequate to
meet all defense needs for at least 18 years.
In fact, the Department admits that the first
year of a war would deplete the stockpile
only about 2.3 percent and the stockpile is so
bulging that the government has been trying
to sell some of it.
Only one African nation, Zambia, has ever
traded with Rhodesia, this because it has no
other means of exporting goods. Zambia has
appealed to the United States for aid to
lessen or eliminate this dependence, but has
repeatedly been turned down.
President Ford has endorsed the
amendment's repeal. And Secretary of State
Kissinger wrote in a letter to Congress: "The
Byrd provision is not essential to our national
security, brings us no real economic
advantage, and is detrimental to the conduct
of foreign relations."
Rhodesian Crackdown
There was evidence, shortly after passage
of the sanctions, that the Rhodesian
government was "loosening up." But since
the U.S. decision to resume trade, the
Rhodesian economy has improved, and the
government has cracked down anew on
opposition.
Still, the violations continue. In August,
Congressional proponents of repeal
assembled heavy artillery but to no avail.
Once again the House refused to act.
But the longshoremen remain stalwarts in
the protest. "I understand the issues here,"
one white worker explained after the initial
boycott. "I know it's against them goin' over
there for that cheap labor."
And as a black longshoreman summed up:
"What does this little bit of money mean that
we could have earned today? Nothing,
compared to the fight for freedom."
