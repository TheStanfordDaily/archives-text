# Letters--Live Oak', Half-Time,Co-Op

On Live Oak Fee
Editor:
The recent ASSU elections
glaringly pointed out that
students just don't take an active
interest in campus issues. The top
ASSU senator gained less than
500 votes, and barely 20 percent
of the student body votes in any
election.
Live Oak was published this
fall,, to present issues as much for
the 80 percent who don't vote as
for the 20 percent who do. So
when Live Oak decided to go for a
fee assessment as a means to
enlarge and improve its paper, the
question of student interest was
naturally raised.
It has taken an immense
amount of effort by over 50
people to put Live Oak on the
stands each Friday, and even
greater hardships to even get the
paper started due to fierce
opposition by established groups
on campus.
What bothers us most is not
losing the fee assessment because
of a negative vote, but because of
student apathy. If the vote is
negative, it only means we have to
work harder to improve the paper
to meet student approval. But a
low voter turnout means that we
have failed in our primary
objective which was to increase
student awareness on campus.
The fee assessment would
allow Live Oak to improve itself
dramatically be decreasing the
editorial copy/advertising ratio
and giving the publication the
option to use more color, decent
newsprint, better quality
photography and a whole series
of other items. In short, the fee
assessment would mean the
difference between a mediocre
paper and a good paper.
If three cents an issue is truly
an objectionable sum to you, at
least let us know by your vote.

Half-Time Option
Editor:
It was extremely heartening to
learn of the student half-time
option that was proposed by the
ASSU Task Force on Half-Time
Status (Daily, Nov. 11). As a new

transfer student this fall, my
greatest disillusionment with the
educational process at Stanford
was recognized during the first
week of classes: I immediately
missed the social and academic
interaction between diverse age
and maturity levels that was
present at my former college.
Although, if adopted, this
proposal would bring in a
seemingly insignificant number of
older, part-time students within
the next four years, it would
create a precedent in admissions
policy that would conceivably
eventuate a vital change in the
student body make-up at
Stanford.
This charge would be as
important to the social and
academic growth of Stanford as
was the inclusion of greater
numbers of minority applicants
and women.
Ignoring even the positive
aspect of demonstrating
"increased responsiveness to the
community," the existence of the
half-time option would allow the
typical Stanford studlent (typical,
in the sense that one enters as a
freshman, directly from high
school) to participate in a student
community that was more
representative of society outside
of the University.
Having enjoyed such a
situation, I was very aware of its
necessity to my personal growth,
and very aware of its utter
nonexistence at Stanford.
Thus, when I read about the
half-time option proposal, I was
encouraged to know that others at
Stanford were dissatisfied with
the homogeneity of the
undergraduate student body.

I wish to amend my letter of
Nov. 14. Although Danny Scher
introduced the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band, the concerts of that
group were sponsored by the
Office of Public Events.
Nonetheless, this disclosure hardly
lessens the impressive record that

is Scher's.

More On Record Co-Op
Editor:
In reference to the Record
Co-op Plan (Daily, Nov.
15), I would like to explain further
my position on the proposal.
First of all, I believe a student
managed operation that provides
lowest cost services to students
(e.g. ASSU Travel Service) is
highly desirable. I would be very
happy to see a student run Record
Co-op on campus that would sell
phonographic equipment to the
Stanford community at the lowest
cost possible.
However, after reviewing the
proposal for the ASSU co-op, I
don't believe that adequate
demand exists to generate an
additional $13,000 in gross sales
the amount necessary just for
the co-op to break even. If this is
the case, and the co-op does not
break even, the students will end
up paying more than the $1 initial
fee assessment.
Because no measure exists to
gauge the adequacy of record
demand, the upcoming election
will serve to determine this
demand. If the support exists for
a Record Co-op, it will be reflected
by a strong affirmation of the
assessment. A lack of support will
be reflected by a poor turn-out or
a strongly negative vote for the
fee assessment.
One point made in the article
that needs correcting is that a
$50,000 to $60,000 inestment is
necessary to begin the co-op.
Actually, only an $ll,OOO
investment is necessary to operate
the co-op. I mistakenly reported
the former figure to the Daily's
reporter.

A Man At Last
Editor:
I have long felt that one of
America's most urgent needs is for

an institution that can provide a
set of "rites of passage" for that
awful transition into manhood. In
the old days, we American males
could confirm our manhood in
assorted wars or elaborate hazings.
With the vietnamization of one
and the widespread legislation
against the other we are left
untested and unsure.
Rather then hassling the
development of a new rite of
passage I deem it much simpler to
resurrect one from the past. I
cannot express my elation at the
dramatic attempts now being
made to turn back the clock here
at Stanford.
No, I am not referrring to the
founding of the Conservative
Student Union, nor the return of
editorials (however bland) to the
Daily. I am speaking about the Big
Game Bonfire. The Bonfire is just
a beginning, but we should
remember men ennoble
themselves in small steps.
Now some students are
concerned about the possibilities
of dumping more dirt into the
local air. I hasten to point out
that the total pollution will
measure a mere four tons or just
.00000007854 percent of the
total air pollution caused by
World War 11, Vietnam, and the
Coup in Chile combined. Not
wishing to pollute more than my
fair share, I intend to leave Dad's
Mustang in the lot all day Friday.
A small price to pay.
I hunger for the excitement of
crackling flames, and more than
that, I lust for the chance to
defend Stanford's honor. No one
is going to light that fire but we
men of Stanford. To protect our
honor throughout the perils of the
night and to greet the dawn with
my cold Coors clasped in my
strong right hand will be profound
fulfillment of my most secret
desires.
I just want to thank the
Stanford Athletic Department,
the University itself and the
wonderful guys in the
Inter-Fraternity Council for giving
me a chance to prove myself. Too
small for the gridiron, we also
fight, who only drink and guard.

option that was proposed by the
ASSU Task Force on Half-Time
Status (Daily, Nov. 11). As a new

transfer student this fall, my
greatest disillusionment with the
educational process at Stanford
was recognized during the first
week of classes: I immediately
missed the social and academic
interaction between diverse age
and maturity levels that was
present at my former college.
Although, if adopted, this
proposal would bring in a
seemingly insignificant number of
older, part-time students within
the next four years, it would
create a precedent in admissions
policy that would conceivably
eventuate a vital change in the
student body make-up at
Stanford.
This charge would be as
important to the social and
academic growth of Stanford as
was the inclusion of greater
numbers of minority applicants
and women.
Ignoring even the positive
aspect of demonstrating
"increased responsiveness to the
community," the existence of the
half-time option would allow the
typical Stanford studlent (typical,
in the sense that one enters as a
freshman, directly from high
school) to participate in a student
community that was more
representative of society outside
of the University.
Having enjoyed such a
situation, I was very aware of its
necessity to my personal growth,
and very aware of its utter
nonexistence at Stanford.
Thus, when I read about the
half-time option proposal, I was
encouraged to know that others at
Stanford were dissatisfied with
the homogeneity of the
undergraduate student body.

More On Record Co-Op
Editor:
In reference to the Record
Co-op Plan (Daily, Nov.
15), I would like to explain further
my position on the proposal.
First of all, I believe a student
managed operation that provides
lowest cost services to students
(e.g. ASSU Travel Service) is
highly desirable. I would be very
happy to see a student run Record
Co-op on campus that would sell
phonographic equipment to the
Stanford community at the lowest
cost possible.
However, after reviewing the
proposal for the ASSU co-op, I
don't believe that adequate
demand exists to generate an
additional $13,000 in gross sales
the amount necessary just for
the co-op to break even. If this is
the case, and the co-op does not
break even, the students will end
up paying more than the $1 initial
fee assessment.
Because no measure exists to
gauge the adequacy of record
demand, the upcoming election
will serve to determine this
demand. If the support exists for
a Record Co-op, it will be reflected
by a strong affirmation of the
assessment. A lack of support will
be reflected by a poor turn-out or
a strongly negative vote for the
fee assessment.
One point made in the article
that needs correcting is that a
$50,000 to $60,000 inestment is
necessary to begin the co-op.
Actually, only an $ll,OOO
investment is necessary to operate
the co-op. I mistakenly reported
the former figure to the Daily's
reporter.

A Man At Last
Editor:
I have long felt that one of
America's most urgent needs is for

an institution that can provide a
set of "rites of passage" for that
awful transition into manhood. In
the old days, we American males
could confirm our manhood in
assorted wars or elaborate hazings.
With the vietnamization of one
and the widespread legislation
against the other we are left
untested and unsure.
Rather then hassling the
development of a new rite of
passage I deem it much simpler to
resurrect one from the past. I
cannot express my elation at the
dramatic attempts now being
made to turn back the clock here
at Stanford.
No, I am not referrring to the
founding of the Conservative
Student Union, nor the return of
editorials (however bland) to the
Daily. I am speaking about the Big
Game Bonfire. The Bonfire is just
a beginning, but we should
remember men ennoble
themselves in small steps.
Now some students are
concerned about the possibilities
of dumping more dirt into the
local air. I hasten to point out
that the total pollution will
measure a mere four tons or just
.00000007854 percent of the
total air pollution caused by
World War 11, Vietnam, and the
Coup in Chile combined. Not
wishing to pollute more than my
fair share, I intend to leave Dad's
Mustang in the lot all day Friday.
A small price to pay.
I hunger for the excitement of
crackling flames, and more than
that, I lust for the chance to
defend Stanford's honor. No one
is going to light that fire but we
men of Stanford. To protect our
honor throughout the perils of the
night and to greet the dawn with
my cold Coors clasped in my
strong right hand will be profound
fulfillment of my most secret
desires.
I just want to thank the
Stanford Athletic Department,
the University itself and the
wonderful guys in the
Inter-Fraternity Council for giving
me a chance to prove myself. Too
small for the gridiron, we also
fight, who only drink and guard.

On Live Oak Fee
Editor:
The recent ASSU elections
glaringly pointed out that
students just don't take an active
interest in campus issues. The top
ASSU senator gained less than
500 votes, and barely 20 percent
of the student body votes in any
election.
Live Oak was published this
fall,, to present issues as much for
the 80 percent who don't vote as
for the 20 percent who do. So
when Live Oak decided to go for a
fee assessment as a means to
enlarge and improve its paper, the
question of student interest was
naturally raised.
It has taken an immense
amount of effort by over 50
people to put Live Oak on the
stands each Friday, and even
greater hardships to even get the
paper started due to fierce
opposition by established groups
on campus.
What bothers us most is not
losing the fee assessment because
of a negative vote, but because of
student apathy. If the vote is
negative, it only means we have to
work harder to improve the paper
to meet student approval. But a
low voter turnout means that we
have failed in our primary
objective which was to increase
student awareness on campus.
The fee assessment would
allow Live Oak to improve itself
dramatically be decreasing the
editorial copy/advertising ratio
and giving the publication the
option to use more color, decent
newsprint, better quality
photography and a whole series
of other items. In short, the fee
assessment would mean the
difference between a mediocre
paper and a good paper.
If three cents an issue is truly
an objectionable sum to you, at
least let us know by your vote.

More On Record Co-Op
Editor:
In reference to the Record
Co-op Plan (Daily, Nov.
15), I would like to explain further
my position on the proposal.
First of all, I believe a student
managed operation that provides
lowest cost services to students
(e.g. ASSU Travel Service) is
highly desirable. I would be very
happy to see a student run Record
Co-op on campus that would sell
phonographic equipment to the
Stanford community at the lowest
cost possible.
However, after reviewing the
proposal for the ASSU co-op, I
don't believe that adequate
demand exists to generate an
additional $13,000 in gross sales
the amount necessary just for
the co-op to break even. If this is
the case, and the co-op does not
break even, the students will end
up paying more than the $1 initial
fee assessment.
Because no measure exists to
gauge the adequacy of record
demand, the upcoming election
will serve to determine this
demand. If the support exists for
a Record Co-op, it will be reflected
by a strong affirmation of the
assessment. A lack of support will
be reflected by a poor turn-out or
a strongly negative vote for the
fee assessment.
One point made in the article
that needs correcting is that a
$50,000 to $60,000 inestment is
necessary to begin the co-op.
Actually, only an $ll,OOO
investment is necessary to operate
the co-op. I mistakenly reported
the former figure to the Daily's
reporter.

A Man At Last
Editor:
I have long felt that one of
America's most urgent needs is for

an institution that can provide a
set of "rites of passage" for that
awful transition into manhood. In
the old days, we American males
could confirm our manhood in
assorted wars or elaborate hazings.
With the vietnamization of one
and the widespread legislation
against the other we are left
untested and unsure.
Rather then hassling the
development of a new rite of
passage I deem it much simpler to
resurrect one from the past. I
cannot express my elation at the
dramatic attempts now being
made to turn back the clock here
at Stanford.
No, I am not referrring to the
founding of the Conservative
Student Union, nor the return of
editorials (however bland) to the
Daily. I am speaking about the Big
Game Bonfire. The Bonfire is just
a beginning, but we should
remember men ennoble
themselves in small steps.
Now some students are
concerned about the possibilities
of dumping more dirt into the
local air. I hasten to point out
that the total pollution will
measure a mere four tons or just
.00000007854 percent of the
total air pollution caused by
World War 11, Vietnam, and the
Coup in Chile combined. Not
wishing to pollute more than my
fair share, I intend to leave Dad's
Mustang in the lot all day Friday.
A small price to pay.
I hunger for the excitement of
crackling flames, and more than
that, I lust for the chance to
defend Stanford's honor. No one
is going to light that fire but we
men of Stanford. To protect our
honor throughout the perils of the
night and to greet the dawn with
my cold Coors clasped in my
strong right hand will be profound
fulfillment of my most secret
desires.
I just want to thank the
Stanford Athletic Department,
the University itself and the
wonderful guys in the
Inter-Fraternity Council for giving
me a chance to prove myself. Too
small for the gridiron, we also
fight, who only drink and guard.

On Live Oak Fee
Editor:
The recent ASSU elections
glaringly pointed out that
students just don't take an active
interest in campus issues. The top
ASSU senator gained less than
500 votes, and barely 20 percent
of the student body votes in any
election.
Live Oak was published this
fall,, to present issues as much for
the 80 percent who don't vote as
for the 20 percent who do. So
when Live Oak decided to go for a
fee assessment as a means to
enlarge and improve its paper, the
question of student interest was
naturally raised.
It has taken an immense
amount of effort by over 50
people to put Live Oak on the
stands each Friday, and even
greater hardships to even get the
paper started due to fierce
opposition by established groups
on campus.
What bothers us most is not
losing the fee assessment because
of a negative vote, but because of
student apathy. If the vote is
negative, it only means we have to
work harder to improve the paper
to meet student approval. But a
low voter turnout means that we
have failed in our primary
objective which was to increase
student awareness on campus.
The fee assessment would
allow Live Oak to improve itself
dramatically be decreasing the
editorial copy/advertising ratio
and giving the publication the
option to use more color, decent
newsprint, better quality
photography and a whole series
of other items. In short, the fee
assessment would mean the
difference between a mediocre
paper and a good paper.
If three cents an issue is truly
an objectionable sum to you, at
least let us know by your vote.

Half-Time Option
Editor:
It was extremely heartening to
learn of the student half-time
option that was proposed by the
ASSU Task Force on Half-Time
Status (Daily, Nov. 11). As a new

transfer student this fall, my
greatest disillusionment with the
educational process at Stanford
was recognized during the first
week of classes: I immediately
missed the social and academic
interaction between diverse age
and maturity levels that was
present at my former college.
Although, if adopted, this
proposal would bring in a
seemingly insignificant number of
older, part-time students within
the next four years, it would
create a precedent in admissions
policy that would conceivably
eventuate a vital change in the
student body make-up at
Stanford.
This charge would be as
important to the social and
academic growth of Stanford as
was the inclusion of greater
numbers of minority applicants
and women.
Ignoring even the positive
aspect of demonstrating
"increased responsiveness to the
community," the existence of the
half-time option would allow the
typical Stanford studlent (typical,
in the sense that one enters as a
freshman, directly from high
school) to participate in a student
community that was more
representative of society outside
of the University.
Having enjoyed such a
situation, I was very aware of its
necessity to my personal growth,
and very aware of its utter
nonexistence at Stanford.
Thus, when I read about the
half-time option proposal, I was
encouraged to know that others at
Stanford were dissatisfied with
the homogeneity of the
undergraduate student body.

set of "rites of passage" for that
awful transition into manhood. In
the old days, we American males
could confirm our manhood in
assorted wars or elaborate hazings.
With the vietnamization of one
and the widespread legislation
against the other we are left
untested and unsure.
Rather then hassling the
development of a new rite of
passage I deem it much simpler to
resurrect one from the past. I
cannot express my elation at the
dramatic attempts now being
made to turn back the clock here
at Stanford.
No, I am not referrring to the
founding of the Conservative
Student Union, nor the return of
editorials (however bland) to the
Daily. I am speaking about the Big
Game Bonfire. The Bonfire is just
a beginning, but we should
remember men ennoble
themselves in small steps.
Now some students are
concerned about the possibilities
of dumping more dirt into the
local air. I hasten to point out
that the total pollution will
measure a mere four tons or just
.00000007854 percent of the
total air pollution caused by
World War 11, Vietnam, and the
Coup in Chile combined. Not
wishing to pollute more than my
fair share, I intend to leave Dad's
Mustang in the lot all day Friday.
A small price to pay.
I hunger for the excitement of
crackling flames, and more than
that, I lust for the chance to
defend Stanford's honor. No one
is going to light that fire but we
men of Stanford. To protect our
honor throughout the perils of the
night and to greet the dawn with
my cold Coors clasped in my
strong right hand will be profound
fulfillment of my most secret
desires.
I just want to thank the
Stanford Athletic Department,
the University itself and the
wonderful guys in the
Inter-Fraternity Council for giving
me a chance to prove myself. Too
small for the gridiron, we also
fight, who only drink and guard.

On Live Oak Fee
Editor:
The recent ASSU elections
glaringly pointed out that
students just don't take an active
interest in campus issues. The top
ASSU senator gained less than
500 votes, and barely 20 percent
of the student body votes in any
election.
Live Oak was published this
fall,, to present issues as much for
the 80 percent who don't vote as
for the 20 percent who do. So
when Live Oak decided to go for a
fee assessment as a means to
enlarge and improve its paper, the
question of student interest was
naturally raised.
It has taken an immense
amount of effort by over 50
people to put Live Oak on the
stands each Friday, and even
greater hardships to even get the
paper started due to fierce
opposition by established groups
on campus.
What bothers us most is not
losing the fee assessment because
of a negative vote, but because of
student apathy. If the vote is
negative, it only means we have to
work harder to improve the paper
to meet student approval. But a
low voter turnout means that we
have failed in our primary
objective which was to increase
student awareness on campus.
The fee assessment would
allow Live Oak to improve itself
dramatically be decreasing the
editorial copy/advertising ratio
and giving the publication the
option to use more color, decent
newsprint, better quality
photography and a whole series
of other items. In short, the fee
assessment would mean the
difference between a mediocre
paper and a good paper.
If three cents an issue is truly
an objectionable sum to you, at
least let us know by your vote.

Half-Time Option
Editor:
It was extremely heartening to
learn of the student half-time
option that was proposed by the
ASSU Task Force on Half-Time
Status (Daily, Nov. 11). As a new

transfer student this fall, my
greatest disillusionment with the
educational process at Stanford
was recognized during the first
week of classes: I immediately
missed the social and academic
interaction between diverse age
and maturity levels that was
present at my former college.
Although, if adopted, this
proposal would bring in a
seemingly insignificant number of
older, part-time students within
the next four years, it would
create a precedent in admissions
policy that would conceivably
eventuate a vital change in the
student body make-up at
Stanford.
This charge would be as
important to the social and
academic growth of Stanford as
was the inclusion of greater
numbers of minority applicants
and women.
Ignoring even the positive
aspect of demonstrating
"increased responsiveness to the
community," the existence of the
half-time option would allow the
typical Stanford studlent (typical,
in the sense that one enters as a
freshman, directly from high
school) to participate in a student
community that was more
representative of society outside
of the University.
Having enjoyed such a
situation, I was very aware of its
necessity to my personal growth,
and very aware of its utter
nonexistence at Stanford.
Thus, when I read about the
half-time option proposal, I was
encouraged to know that others at
Stanford were dissatisfied with
the homogeneity of the
undergraduate student body.

Letter Amended
Editor:
I wish to amend my letter of
Nov. 14. Although Danny Scher
introduced the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band, the concerts of that
group were sponsored by the
Office of Public Events.
Nonetheless, this disclosure hardly
lessens the impressive record that

is Scher's.

More On Record Co-Op
Editor:
In reference to the Record
Co-op Plan (Daily, Nov.
15), I would like to explain further
my position on the proposal.
First of all, I believe a student
managed operation that provides
lowest cost services to students
(e.g. ASSU Travel Service) is
highly desirable. I would be very
happy to see a student run Record
Co-op on campus that would sell
phonographic equipment to the
Stanford community at the lowest
cost possible.
However, after reviewing the
proposal for the ASSU co-op, I
don't believe that adequate
demand exists to generate an
additional $13,000 in gross sales
the amount necessary just for
the co-op to break even. If this is
the case, and the co-op does not
break even, the students will end
up paying more than the $1 initial
fee assessment.
Because no measure exists to
gauge the adequacy of record
demand, the upcoming election
will serve to determine this
demand. If the support exists for
a Record Co-op, it will be reflected
by a strong affirmation of the
assessment. A lack of support will
be reflected by a poor turn-out or
a strongly negative vote for the
fee assessment.
One point made in the article
that needs correcting is that a
$50,000 to $60,000 inestment is
necessary to begin the co-op.
Actually, only an $ll,OOO
investment is necessary to operate
the co-op. I mistakenly reported
the former figure to the Daily's
reporter.
