# Housing Concept
## 
### Tim Ferguson 
If Larry Horton has indeed
already decided against
fraternities in the draw-exemption
issue, as Bonny Rodden implied in
her Nov. 15 Daily analysis, then
both he and the University
decision-making process deserve
the rancor directed at them in
many student quarters.
However, if Horton actually
desires further input on the
University-created problems of
discriminatory treatment and
housing shortages, then both he
and the Committee On Student
Services (COSS) sub-committee
on housing ought to consider a
proposal made to University
President Richard Lyman on Oct.
28.
Conceived by Beta Theta Phi
alumnus Pitch Johnson, the plan
follows the line of earlier
proposals to extend the
continuity and subjective
selection of members now a part
of the fraternity system to other
houses which include women.
But Johnson's plan does so
with one twist: it avoids any
increase in the on-campus eviction
rate for those who choose to
remain in the University draw
system.
Paradox?
Such an apparent paradox is
achieved by requiring those
houses existing outside the draw
to absorb an "overcrowding
percentage" equal to the percent
of students seeking on-campus
housing who are forced off by the
shortage.
Thus, at present, houses would
overcrowd by 25 percent over
their rated occupancy. (Because
current occupancy ratings vary
widely among similar-sized
structures, a new, uniform rating
would be needed.)
A house could achieve such
overcrowding simply by
converting, for example, doubles
into triples; or by convincing
some house members to
voluntarily live off-campus; or, if
necessary, by renting an
off-campus structure for surplus
members.
In any case, the advantages of
continuity and self-selection for
those in independent houses could
no longer be termed "unfair" to
those without them, because such
gains would be achieved through a
trade-off with the "losses" of
overcrowded conditions.
And obviously, independence
theoretically could thus be
extended indefinitely through the
housing system to a point of zero
shortages.
Tattered Argument
Johnson's plan, frankly, leaves
Horton's argument against
extending to more houses the
benefits of continuity and
self-selection (which the
University admits are just that
—benefits) in tatters. The eviction
rate is not increased; no one is
hurt.
Sentiment within the
Inter-fraternity Council indicates
that its members are willing to
sacrifice the pleasures of
uncrowded living in light of the
housing shortage. And it is just
that a sacrifice not an
obligation in order to maintain
what Horton mistakenly calls
"vast privileges."
Webster's defines "privilege" as
a "special right, favor, etc. granted
to some person or group." No one
"granted" fraternities those things
which they now have; no one,
until now, has assumed the right
to take, them away, except when
frats themselves abused the rights
of others. Fraternities, not the
Unversity, built the houses.
But, given the pressures of the
moment, fraternities are willing to
help Stanford out of a
discrimination and shortage
problem which the University
created by sacrificing
uncrowded living.
Fraternities are not, however,
willing to relinquish that
considered vital to their existence:
independent judgment over
membership, and hence residence.
Misleading Statement
Horton is misleading when he
points to Kappa Sigma as
"stronger today" in the draw than
it was under independence. The
house's financial picture is
stronger, because it has been
guaranteed full residence. The
fraternity, its president admits, is
all but dead, in large part because
its expected pledge class of 20 was
decimated by draw requirements
and reduced by three fourths.
So we do, as Horton says, have
an excellent example in Kappa
Sigma of just what will happen to
fraternities unless Horton's mind
is changed or his decision
reversed.
Pitch Johnson's proposal is
reasonable grounds on which to
do so. The only individuals who
stand to lose anything under its
tenets are fraternity members, and
even they are able to preserve that
which they feel they must save.

theoretically could thus be
extended indefinitely through the
housing system to a point of zero
shortages.
Tattered Argument
Johnson's plan, frankly, leaves
Horton's argument against
extending to more houses the
benefits of continuity and
self-selection (which the
University admits are just that
—benefits) in tatters. The eviction
rate is not increased; no one is
hurt.
Sentiment within the
Inter-fraternity Council indicates
that its members are willing to
sacrifice the pleasures of
uncrowded living in light of the
housing shortage. And it is just
that a sacrifice not an
obligation in order to maintain
what Horton mistakenly calls
"vast privileges."
Webster's defines "privilege" as
a "special right, favor, etc. granted
to some person or group." No one
"granted" fraternities those things
which they now have; no one,
until now, has assumed the right
to take, them away, except when
frats themselves abused the rights
of others. Fraternities, not the
Unversity, built the houses.
But, given the pressures of the
moment, fraternities are willing to
help Stanford out of a
discrimination and shortage
problem which the University
created by sacrificing
uncrowded living.
Fraternities are not, however,
willing to relinquish that
considered vital to their existence:
independent judgment over
membership, and hence residence.
Misleading Statement
Horton is misleading when he
points to Kappa Sigma as
"stronger today" in the draw than
it was under independence. The
house's financial picture is
stronger, because it has been
guaranteed full residence. The
fraternity, its president admits, is
all but dead, in large part because
its expected pledge class of 20 was
decimated by draw requirements
and reduced by three fourths.
So we do, as Horton says, have
an excellent example in Kappa
Sigma of just what will happen to
fraternities unless Horton's mind
is changed or his decision
reversed.
Pitch Johnson's proposal is
reasonable grounds on which to
do so. The only individuals who
stand to lose anything under its
tenets are fraternity members, and
even they are able to preserve that
which they feel they must save.
(Tim Ferguson is a member of the
Daily editorial board.)
If Larry Horton has indeed
already decided against
fraternities in the draw-exemption
issue, as Bonny Rodden implied in
her Nov. 15 Daily analysis, then
both he and the University
decision-making process deserve
the rancor directed at them in
many student quarters.
However, if Horton actually
desires further input on the
University-created problems of
discriminatory treatment and
housing shortages, then both he
and the Committee On Student
Services (COSS) sub-committee
on housing ought to consider a
proposal made to University
President Richard Lyman on Oct.
28.
Conceived by Beta Theta Phi
alumnus Pitch Johnson, the plan
follows the line of earlier
proposals to extend the
continuity and subjective
selection of members now a part
of the fraternity system to other
houses which include women.
But Johnson's plan does so
with one twist: it avoids any
increase in the on-campus eviction
rate for those who choose to
remain in the University draw
system.
Paradox?
Such an apparent paradox is
achieved by requiring those
houses existing outside the draw
to absorb an "overcrowding
percentage" equal to the percent
of students seeking on-campus
housing who are forced off by the
shortage.
Thus, at present, houses would
overcrowd by 25 percent over
their rated occupancy. (Because
current occupancy ratings vary
widely among similar-sized
structures, a new, uniform rating
would be needed.)
A house could achieve such
overcrowding simply by
converting, for example, doubles
into triples; or by convincing
some house members to
voluntarily live off-campus; or, if
necessary, by renting an
off-campus structure for surplus
members.
In any case, the advantages of
continuity and self-selection for
those in independent houses could
no longer be termed "unfair" to
those without them, because such
gains would be achieved through a
trade-off with the "losses" of
overcrowded conditions.
And obviously, independence
theoretically could thus be
extended indefinitely through the
housing system to a point of zero
shortages.
