## Audio-Visual Aids Help Smokers Kick The Habit Health Education: Filling The Information Gap 
### BARBARA LANE 
2 a.m. The chemistry exam is
seven hours away. You're
confident you know the material,
you're exhausted, but you just
can't get to sleep. You are tense,
full of nervous anticipation. Those
formulas keep racing through
your head.
You can't stop smoking
although you've tried everything.
You stopped buying cigarettes for
a while, but managed to feed your
habit through the generosity of
other smokers. Gum, carrots
you've suffered through every
conceivable cigarette substitute
without success.
There may be a remedy for
both of these conditions that
involves neither drugs nor religion.
Palo Alto's Health Education
Center, located at 920 Bryant

Street, offers progammed
audio-visual instruction that
enables patients to understand
and deal with their problems.
"Relaxation is well worth it in
physical and emotional rewards,"
the pleasantly modulated voice
begins. "Just allow yourself to
relax, let go."
The "Relaxation Skills"
videotape cassette instructs the
listener to tense and tighten
individual muscles, and then relax
them. The patient learns to
recognize the difference between
tension and relaxation, and how
to achieve the relaxed state.
Center directors say the program
has already helped some members
of the Stanford football team
shed their pre-game tensions.
Another patient, Joseph Jew,
was referred to the relaxation

program by his physician
following hospitalization for a
heart attack. "I had forgotten
how to relax and needed to slow
down," says Jew.
He describes the program as
"the nucleus for his change" but
emphasizes, "It's no good unless
you are conscientious about doing
the recommended exercises." Jew
says the physical approach to
relaxation is "much better than
tranquilizers."
The program for cigarette
addicts, "Smoking: What Your
Doctor Wants You To Know"
provides a frightening look at the
dangers of smoking.
Besides describing the
biological effects, chronic
pulmonary disease, bronchitis and
pulmonary emphysema, the

program systematically shoots
down smokers' common excuses.
The program informs those
who maintain they smoke to stay
slim that a smoker would have to
gain 80 pounds to strain his or her
heart the way cigarettes do. "The
evidence is in, the price is high,
the risk is great ... is your
cigarette really worth it?"
Filling The Void
The six-month-old Health
Education Center' is part of a
project developed jointly by the
American Association of Medical
Clinics (AAMC) and Core
Communications In Health
(CCH). It was founded on the
premise that patient education
represents the biggest void in the
health care system.
The programs offered range
from general relaxation therapy to
explanations of specific diseases
that require major adjustments in
a patient's lifestyle.
These specific programs, which
require a doctor's prescription, are
"Heart Attack: Recovery and
Rehabilitation," "Diabetes
Mellitus: The Self Injection of
Insulin," and "Living with a Low
Sodium Diet."
"The programs were
informative and very helpful" says
Janet Martinich, a young diabetic
woman. Referred by her doctor at
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic,
Martinich saw two programs on
Diabetes: "Living with Diabetes"
and "Skin and Foot Care for the
Diabetic."
"I learned new facts and became
more aware of how to care for my
condition," she said. Martinich is
"enthusiastic about
recommending the program to
diabetics."
Personalized Programs
Each program is tailored by a
health educator who works with
the patient to develop personal
goals to make the treatment more
effective. AAMC medical
consultants control the creation
and development of the programs,
assuring medical validity. The
chief consultant on each program
is a recognized expert in the field
who has demonstrated an interest
in patient education.
Ann Hammond, patient
education director at the Health
Education Center, looks to the
program's future. Although only

four clinics like the one in Palo
Alto now exist, CCH hopes to
have 10 centers in operation by
the end of the year, she says.
"Many patients are hesitant to
bring up what they consider to be
trivial questions with their M.D.,"
Hammond explains. Patients at
the clinic feel free to ask
questions in a non-intimidating
atmosphere, she adds.
Positive Results
"The results from the
relaxation and smoking programs
thus far have been fantastically
good," says Hammond. However,
she adds it is "difficult to assess"
the effectiveness of the other
programs over such a short period
of time, partly because many of
them require behavioral changes.
Dr. Robert Jamplish, executive
director of the Palo Alto clinic
and AAMC's president, views
patient education as "an integral
part of the whole diagnostic
scheme and a logical extension of
medical treatment. "It can make
the work of the doctor a whole
lot easier," he claims.
