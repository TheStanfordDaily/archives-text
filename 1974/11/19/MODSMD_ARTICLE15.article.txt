What is the Stanford Band's version of Cal's fight
song? —Q.E.D.
Year after year, whether at Berkeley or at
Stanford, Golden Bear fans whine their whimpers
for victory while the Stanford crew boisterously
bellows its own version of Cal's tired tune.
One bear crawled out of his lair long enough to
deliver these words to Bug:
Our sturdy golden bear
Is watching from the sky
Looks down upon our colors fair
And guides us from, his lair.
Our banner gold and blue
The symbol on it true
Means fight for California
For California through and through.
Saturday, Stanford Band members will make
that bear eat his words. With the following
licentious lyrics, the Band will force all the bears
back into their lairs for early hibernation:
The dirty golden bear
Is losing all his hair
His teeth are out
He's got the gout
He don't know what it's all about.
His eyes are made of glass
He's losing all his class
So take your dirty golden bear
And shove him up your ass.
Well, you asked for it.

What ever happened to the bicycle stop sign at
May field in front of Sigma Chi? —K.S.
"It may have been swiped," Police Chief Marvin
Herrington remarked, adding that no one was
authorized to remove it.
"It should not be down," he said. He will check
it.
Herrington explained that the stop sign is not
actually necessary. "It was put up there as a
reminder," he said. "They're required to stop
there anyway" because the path between Lathrop
and Sigma is an accessory road to a main
thoroughfare.
Herrington said the purpose of the stop signs is to
"get people to comply as voluntarily as they will."
He said the police just issue tickets for blatant
violations.
Most people stop for the signs, Herrington said.
However, he added that he did not know if what
police stationed in their cars "are seeing is the
actual situation or not."
