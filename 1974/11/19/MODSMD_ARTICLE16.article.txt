# Phonathon Gift Campaign Asks Donors To Bite Bullet
## 
### ELIZABETH POLLOCK 
The caller introduces himself
and says, "We are asking you to
make two specific gifts to
Stanford, one in the form of your
annual gift and the other a special
gift to the Campaign for Stanford
[the University's $3OO million
fundraising drive]."
"I'd like to ask for the bigger
gift first," the voice on the phone
continues. He suggests a number
that is five times the amount of
your $lOO-500 annual gift to
Stanford.
A deliberate pause ensues,
enabling both fundraiser Ed Ford
and the recipient of his call to
plan their next moves.
Ford, a Stanford alumnus and
a fundraiser for the Quad
program, suggests this approach to
participants in this year's National
Region Quad Phonathon.
The Quad program comprises
all persons who donate $lOO-500
annually to Stanford. The

phonathon is a once-a-year
follow-up on earlier mailings to
alumni that fundraisers are unable
to visit personally.
'Underground' Recruiting
Approximately 85 phonathon
volunteers are recruited by the
"Stanford Fundraising
Underground," says fundraiser
Nick Davis, a 1967 graduate. The
volunteers try to contact about
1000 donors during the four-day
phoning period.
Ford was selected to
demonstrate telephone technique
because, "He's been very
successful," explains Brook Phifer
of the Student Development
Committee (SDC). But volunteers
develop their own styles.
Ken Olivier, one of 45 student
volunteers, used this approach:
". .. Would you like to hear my
spiel? ...By the way, how's
Madera? I'm from Merced."
Another student from
Washington received an

impromptu home-state weather
report from a potential donor.
Fundraiser Jack Roberts
lamented, "I chickened out. I
only asked for $100 as an annual
gift." But his partner added that
Roberts once asked for $600
dollars and got it, although he
should have only requested a $500
campaign gift from the donor.
The human element pervaded
many phone conversations.
"Excuse me," one volunteer
apologized. "I didn't mean to
start any family arguments."
An evening phone session held
in Encina Hall last Thursday did
produce one potential heroine.
Said the volunteer who contacted
a 7 0-year-old retired,
schoolteacher living on aJfe
income, "I bit the
asked [her] for $500 and she'd,"
'Well, I don't think I can giv'af
much, but I'll certainly try.'

enabling both fundraiser Ed Ford
and the recipient of his call to
plan their next moves.
Ford, a Stanford alumnus and
a fundraiser for the Quad
program, suggests this approach to
participants in this year's National
Region Quad Phonathon.
The Quad program comprises
all persons who donate $lOO-500
annually to Stanford. The

phonathon is a once-a-year
follow-up on earlier mailings to
alumni that fundraisers are unable
to visit personally.
'Underground' Recruiting
Approximately 85 phonathon
volunteers are recruited by the
"Stanford Fundraising
Underground," says fundraiser
Nick Davis, a 1967 graduate. The
volunteers try to contact about
1000 donors during the four-day
phoning period.
Ford was selected to
demonstrate telephone technique
because, "He's been very
successful," explains Brook Phifer
of the Student Development
Committee (SDC). But volunteers
develop their own styles.
Ken Olivier, one of 45 student
volunteers, used this approach:
". .. Would you like to hear my
spiel? ...By the way, how's
Madera? I'm from Merced."
Another student from
Washington received an

impromptu home-state weather
report from a potential donor.
Fundraiser Jack Roberts
lamented, "I chickened out. I
only asked for $100 as an annual
gift." But his partner added that
Roberts once asked for $600
dollars and got it, although he
should have only requested a $500
campaign gift from the donor.
The human element pervaded
many phone conversations.
"Excuse me," one volunteer
apologized. "I didn't mean to
start any family arguments."
An evening phone session held
in Encina Hall last Thursday did
produce one potential heroine.
Said the volunteer who contacted
a 7 0-year-old retired,
schoolteacher living on aJfe
income, "I bit the
asked [her] for $500 and she'd,"
'Well, I don't think I can giv'af
much, but I'll certainly try.'
The caller introduces himself
and says, "We are asking you to
make two specific gifts to
Stanford, one in the form of your
annual gift and the other a special
gift to the Campaign for Stanford
[the University's $3OO million
fundraising drive]."
"I'd like to ask for the bigger
gift first," the voice on the phone
continues. He suggests a number
that is five times the amount of
your $lOO-500 annual gift to
Stanford.
A deliberate pause ensues,
enabling both fundraiser Ed Ford
and the recipient of his call to
plan their next moves.
