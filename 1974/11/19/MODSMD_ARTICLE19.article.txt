Loveable
Bigot
Show

"Chico, you got a lot of
energy. No brains but a lot of
energy."
"Yeah, well I'm not going to
let this business go down hill."
"Too late, we're already at the
bottom."
So goes the weekly battle
between Chico Rodriguez and Ed
Brown in NBC's wersion of the
Odd Couple, Chico and the Man, a
show that is far from the bottom.
No, this series doesn't concern
two divorcees. It doesn't even
concern two friends. But it
attempts to answer the question:
Can a "cheerful young Chicano"
live peaceably with a
"narrow-minded old garage
owner?"
To find out, we must keep
watching. But if the process of
discovering continues to be as
humorous as it has been, Chico
can certainly live with this
narrow-minded critic.
Old Concept
Following in the pattern layed
out by All in the Family, Maude,
San ford and Son and Good Times,
this series also attempts to present
the funny side of bigotry. And
enough can be enough. But unlike
these programs, Chico and the
Man provides us with one
stunning attribute: the well
coordinated acting abilities of
stars Jack Albertson and Freddie
Prinz. It is their rapport and
timing that make this series worth
viewing.
Prinz, actually of Puerto Rican
descent, portrays Chico with just
the right touch of assertiveness.
From fast-talking Brown into
hiring him to proposing one
ridiculous scheme after another,
Chico maintains command of
every situation. And frequently,
he is less than subtle, as when he
describes the "Ed Brown A-l tune
up: rotate windshield wipers,
change ashtrays and put air in the
tires."
Chico is indeed fast on his
mouth and so is Prinz. When
Chico wants to put someone on,
Prinz beautifully oversmphasizes a
Mexican accent. In past episodes,
he has even done Godfather and
car dealer Ralph Williams
impersonations. In short, Prinz
helps the role of Chico by
presenting him as more than an
ethnic stereotype, giving him
intelligence and a sense of humor.
And Prinz has helped make
famous the line, "That's not my
job."
Counter
Albertson's job as the stubborn
Brown is to continually counter
Chico's ideas.
"I don't know who's right and
who' wrong," Chico says in one
situation.
"Who do you work for?"
Brown asks.
"You."

"IH give you 10 seconds to
figure out who's right."
One character describes Brown
as "angry, frustrated and mean.'
Another calls him "sensitive, kind
and understanding." Indeed, he is
both. And Albertson's veteran
genius (You may remember him
in I Never Sang For My Father)
lies in his allowing these diverse
qualities to come through. With
all of Brown's stubbornness, a
touch of kindness also manifests
itself each week.
Certainly producer David
Wolper and the script writers are
to be commended for a show that
isn't ghetto messagey or
sickeningly sweet but consistently
funny and frequently poignant.
Favorite Episode
One of our favorite episodes
concerned Louis, a black man
who hoped to sell his long-owned
car, "Rosebud," and asked Brown
to help him get rid of it.
Chico talked Brown into aiding
Louis, who then commented,
"You must be eating our food
cause you got soul." After Louis
left, exclaiming, "Rosebud,

you've given me 20,000 miles of
pleasure I wish I could say the
same thing about my wife," and
Brown made scathing comments
about the car ("It's ready for
social security"), Chico and
Brown attemtped to get rid of it.
A butcher claimed he couldn't
afford it: "Why not? With the
price of meat, you'll be a
millionaire by next Tuesday,"
Brown said. Finally, lawyer Raoul
Gomez purchased it and as he
started the ignition, the car broke
down.
Tough Luck
"I'm not gonna give him his
money back," Brown said. "I had
a friend who went to a doctor and
two months later, he dropped
dead. Did the doctor give him his
money back?"
"That is an act of God," Chico
said.
"God works in strange ways."
Brown and Gomez also argued.
"Do you know the state of
California repealed capital
punishment just to protect your
clients?"
"I graduated from USC Law

School in 1950."
"That was also a bad year for
wine."
Not All Bad
So Brown isn't all bad, is he?
Finally, Chico convinced him to
return the money by threatening
to sell Brown's camper van on the
basis of squatter's rights and give
the money to Gomez. Soon after,
Louis came back commenting that
since the car has been gone, "I've
been impossible to live with." He
took the car back.
This episode indicates the
sharp use of comedy, good human
insight and smooth wrap-ups that
characterize this series.
As Jose Feliciano says in the
title song, "Chico, don't be
discouraged. The man ain't so
hard to understand." This
reviewer believes that if this show
can get us to laugh over
misconceptions and do it with the
likenesses of Albertson and Prinz,
then perhaps it is headed in the
proper direction. Preaching? Well,
that is my job.
Chico and the Man can be seen
Fridays at 8:30 p.m. on NBC.
