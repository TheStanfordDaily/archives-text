### ANN AMIOKA 
Geraldine Steinberg, who two years
ago became the first woman to serve
on the Santa Clara County Planning
Commission, was chosen this weekend
as the first woman to serve on the
County Board of Supervisors.
Steinberg will fill the vacancy left
by the election of Supervisor Victor
Calvo to the state Assembly. She will
be representing the fifth supervisorial
district, which includes Stanford, Palo
Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Los
Altos Hills and part of Cupertino and
Saratoga.
Steinberg was chosen by the other
four board members, Sig Sanchez,
Dominic Cortese, Dan McCorquodale
jpid Ralph Mehrkens.
"The decision was not an easy
one," said Sanchez. "All 17 candidates
were excellent."
Sanchez said that Steinberg was a
"more rounded applicant" with
experience in the community oriented
toward county government.
"We're very pleased that she's
coming aboard," Sanchez said. "She'll
make an excellent supervisor."
Calvo was also enthqsiastic. "I'm
delighted that the board appointed a
woman and that the woman is
Geraldine Steinberg," he said.
The University found Steinberg to
be "quite fair and helpful" as a
planning commissioner, said Director
of Community Relations Andrew M.
Doty.
Doty credited Steinberg with
helping work out the compromise
between Stanford and Palo Alto in last
year's zoning dispute.
Steinberg is particularly concerned
with special problems faced by
women. "I think we should try to
establish more, and more convenient
childcare centers; improve job training
programs for women," she said.
She said she is also "very
enthusiastic about the opportunities
open to me as supervisor to solve some
of the problems that face our county
especially in the field of public
transportation and good land
planning."
Steinberg graduated from Vassar
College and received law degrees from
the University of Illinois and Stanford.
