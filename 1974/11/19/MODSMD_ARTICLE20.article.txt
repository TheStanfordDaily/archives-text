# Sparse Crowd Hurts Naftalin
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Pianist Mark Naftalin returned
to campus Saturday night for his
more or less annual appearance in
the Tresidder lounge. Due largely
to weak audience response, this
fall's concert was less satisfying
than previous ones.
Naftalin's solo recitals of blues,
rock, boogie woogie piano and
songs have attracted steadily
growing crowds since his First one
here three years ago. This time,
however, the interaction with the
audience which draws an artist's
best performance was lacking.
The show started out
extremely well. In the first few
numbers, Naftalin used nearly all
the tricks of the blues piano trade,
showing his usual skill with
chords, phrasing and rhythm. He
was particularly effective in
setting up tension between major
and minor keys, and slipping into
alternate time signatures, say 4/4
in the middle of a 12/8 tune.
Most of the first set was
instrumental, with only a few
vocals. Naftalin mixed complex,
moody tunes with straightforward
rock and roll and some classic
boogie woogie.
The Tresidder audience was
appreciative, but not wildly
enthusiastic. Many of the listeners
seemed to be enjoying the music
intellectually, but if the feeling
behind the music was getting
across, that message never got
back to the man at the piano.
Apparently less than satisfied
with the response, Naftalin
concentrated on vocals for most
of the set. He started out by
asking for requests; the ones he
got were for old tunes from the
days with the Paul Butterfield
Blues Band. Actually, he did a
good job converting the
guitar-harp-vocal sound of "Get
Outa My Life" and "Walin'
Blues" to a solo piano version, but
these were less than ideal requests.
Some of the set seemed to be a
sort of grouping for the right sort
of song to please the audience.
After a long string of rock and roll
tunes and Chuck Berry's
sentimental "Daughter Caroline,"
he seemed to find the right

combination in Jerry Lee Lewis'
"Wolverton Mountain." Here he
pulled out all the stops, vocally
and instrumentally, and for the
two-thirds or so of the audience
who remained, it was a strong
closing number.
It is hard to fault Naftalin's
performance, except for a
tendency to draw out the ends of
some tunes. Somehow the

feedback from the audience, so
necessary to make a good concert
great, never quite materialized.
Backstage, Naftalin said that
some solo recording in the near
future is possible. He said he has a
collection of tapes of live
performances from which he has
forumulated "about four"
possible albums, "but I haven't
gone into the studio yet."

POOR AUDIENCE RESPONSEâ€”Mark Naftalin's Saturday night
recital was marred by poor rapport between Naftalin and the
Tresidder Large Lounge crowd. Naftalin's performance was part of the
ASSU Special Events Season.
