Ford Welcomed To Japan '
TOKYO Emperor Hirohito, wearing his
imperial robes, officially welcomed President
Ford to Japan this afternoon Tokyo time.
The historic first meeting in Japan between
an American president in office and a Japanese
emperor took place under clear and sunny skies,
with security guards staring down from hotel
windows overlooking the courtyard of the
official guest house.
Other buildings near the palatial guest house,
where Ford is staying during his five-day visit,
also were under tight security. The courtyard's
iron gates were locked.
The emperor's full-dress reception was the
first official function of the President's visit, the
symbolism of which he plans to use to
strengthen already close U.S.-Japanese ties.
Rocky Adviser Defends Gift
WASHINGTON - The single largest
beneficiary of Nelson A. Rockefeller's
generosity said yesterday his acceptance of
$625,000 did not hinder his ability to act
objectively as a New York state official.
"My judgment was not warped," William J.
Ronan, a longtime friend and adviser of the
former New York governor, told the Senate
Rules Committee. The committee is considering

Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president.
"We frequently disagreed," said Ronan,
adding that if his actions as a state official
enhanced the interests of the Rockefeller
family, "that would be incidental and only
because their interests are so intimately
identified with the interests of the community
itself."
Rockefeller's gifts totaling $2.5 million to
friends and associates over the past 17 years
have become a major issue in the confirmation
hearings.
Ronan's testimony came on the last day of
the Rules Committee hearings. Chairman
Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) said the committee
probably will vote on the nomination
Wednesday, and Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield said a vote by the full Senate could
follow next week.
However, House Judiciary Committee action
on Rockefeller is expected to delay final
confirmation until around Christmas.
Philippine Envoy Held Hostage
WASHINGTON - Philippine Ambassador
Eduardo Z. Romualdez was held hostage in his
office yesterday and an aide was reported shot
by a gunman demanding that his 24-year-old son
be allowed to emigrate from the Philippines.
Philippine diplomat Jose Naldo identified the
gunman as Napoleon Gechoco, a Filipino about
40, of suburban Oxon Hill, Md., who was
demanding that his son still in the Philippines be
allowed to join his family here.
An FBI spokesman indicated late last night
that the seige at the embassy chancery could last
for some time, although negotiations were
continuing and Philippine authorities had agreed
to release the son if the hostages were released.
Nixon Planned Hunt Buildup
WASHINGTON Former President Richard
M. Nixon planned a publicity buildup to pave
the way to grant executive clemency to E.
Howard Hunt Jr. on the day Hunt went on trial
for the Watergate burglary, according to a White
House tape made public for the first time
yesterday.
The tapes of that conversation and several
others were played for the jury yesterday at the
Watergate cover-up trial of former Nixon
lieutenants H. R. Haldeman, John D.
Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell and re-election
committee aides Robert C. Mardian and
Kenneth W. Parkinson.
More than two months after the Jan. 8,

1973, conversation and repeatedly thereafter,
Nixon denied that he had authorized clemency
to be offered to Hunt or any other of the
seven-man burglary team because, as he told
former White House counsel John Dean, "It
would be wrong."
Meanwhile in San Clemente, a Nixon
spokesman said yesterday Nixon will not oppose
efforts of three court-appointed physicians to
see if the former president is fit to testify at the
Watergate cover-up trial.
Nixon aide Ronald Ziegler, contacted at the
Nixon home, said "there has never been any
question that they would be permitted" to
perform the examination. Sirica ordered the
three-man team of doctors to determine Nixon's
physical state.
Israelis Storm Terrorists
TEL AVIV, Israel Israeli security forces
stormed an apartment house in the Jordan River
town of Beit Shean Tuesday and killed the
members of a gang of Arab terrorists who had
seized the building and taken a number of
civilians captive, the Israeli military command
reported.
Residents of the town said three to five
terrorists seized the four-story building about 5
a.m., throwing a hand grenade as they broke in.
First reports indicated the guerrillas killed
one woman and wounded 13 persons.
The gunmen held the building for more than
three hours before Israeli forces
counter-attacked.
Earlier, Arabs demonstrated in the Old City
of Jerusalem for the first time in four years
yesterday.
For the third straight day Arabs defied Israeli
police and border troops in the occupied west
bank in a wave of nationalism sparked by the
appearance of Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasir Arafat before the United Nations.
Greek Leader Takes Landslide
ATHENS, Greece Armed with the biggest
electoral victory in Greek history, Premier
Constantine Caramanlis said yesterday that
democracy has returned to its birthplace and
prepared the nation for a plebiscite on the
future of the monarchy.
He also had decisions to make on Cyprus, ties
with the United States and possibly renewing
Greece's military links with NATO, severed at
the height of the Cyprus crisis.
The 67-year-old Caramanlis told a news
conference he will not take a stand on whether

exiled King Constantine should be restored to
the throne and asserted, "Let the people decide
for themselves without any pressures."
Caramanlis and his New Democracy party
polled 54.5 percent of the vote Sunday and
took 214 of the 300 seats in Parliament in the
first free elections in more than a decade.
Chrysler Plants To Close
DETROIT Chrysler Corp. chairman Lynn
Townsend said yesterday t the firm plans
"substantial plant closing" in December because
of poor car sales, but added that there will be no
"companywide shutdown."
Townsend declined to be specific about the
plant closings, saying production schedules for
the rest of this year would be released soon.
Townsend said there would be many
additional layoffs in the coming two months, as
the firm trims 50,000 cars from its
fourth-quarter production schedule.
Some 26,600 Chrysler workers were on
layoffs this week, from a blue-collar workforce
numbering about 100,000.
Chrysler's auto sales in early November were
off 34 percent from a year ago and 1974
calendar year sales are down 19 percent.
Greyhound Drivers Strike
PHOENIX, Ariz. Some 16,000 bus drivers
and other employees of Greyhound Bus Lines
struck the nationwide system yesterday, but
many terminals remained open with supervisory
personnel handling telephone lines, ticket
refunds and passenger referrals.
Few passengers were reported stranded at
Greyhound Terminals, as Continental Trailways
buses and Amtrak passenger trains agreed to
honor Greyhound tickets to take travelers on
parallel routes.
The Amalgamated Transit Union's contract
with Greyhound expired at 11 a.m. PST
yesterday. Forty-eight hours of
around-the-clock negotiations failed to produce
a new contract, and the workers walked out.
Today's Weather
Fair today except patches of fog night and
morning. Increasing cloudiness tonight. Mostly
cloudy Wednesday. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the 40s to low 50s. High
today and Wednesday in the mid 50s to mid
60s. Light winds becoming southerly 10 to 20

Nixon Planned Hunt Buildup
WASHINGTON Former President Richard
M. Nixon planned a publicity buildup to pave
the way to grant executive clemency to E.
Howard Hunt Jr. on the day Hunt went on trial
for the Watergate burglary, according to a White
House tape made public for the first time
yesterday.
The tapes of that conversation and several
others were played for the jury yesterday at the
Watergate cover-up trial of former Nixon
lieutenants H. R. Haldeman, John D.
Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell and re-election
committee aides Robert C. Mardian and
Kenneth W. Parkinson.
More than two months after the Jan. 8,

1973, conversation and repeatedly thereafter,
Nixon denied that he had authorized clemency
to be offered to Hunt or any other of the
seven-man burglary team because, as he told
former White House counsel John Dean, "It
would be wrong."
Meanwhile in San Clemente, a Nixon
spokesman said yesterday Nixon will not oppose
efforts of three court-appointed physicians to
see if the former president is fit to testify at the
Watergate cover-up trial.
Nixon aide Ronald Ziegler, contacted at the
Nixon home, said "there has never been any
question that they would be permitted" to
perform the examination. Sirica ordered the
three-man team of doctors to determine Nixon's
physical state.
Israelis Storm Terrorists
TEL AVIV, Israel Israeli security forces
stormed an apartment house in the Jordan River
town of Beit Shean Tuesday and killed the
members of a gang of Arab terrorists who had
seized the building and taken a number of
civilians captive, the Israeli military command
reported.
Residents of the town said three to five
terrorists seized the four-story building about 5
a.m., throwing a hand grenade as they broke in.
First reports indicated the guerrillas killed
one woman and wounded 13 persons.
The gunmen held the building for more than
three hours before Israeli forces
counter-attacked.
Earlier, Arabs demonstrated in the Old City
of Jerusalem for the first time in four years
yesterday.
For the third straight day Arabs defied Israeli
police and border troops in the occupied west
bank in a wave of nationalism sparked by the
appearance of Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasir Arafat before the United Nations.
Greek Leader Takes Landslide
ATHENS, Greece Armed with the biggest
electoral victory in Greek history, Premier
Constantine Caramanlis said yesterday that
democracy has returned to its birthplace and
prepared the nation for a plebiscite on the
future of the monarchy.
He also had decisions to make on Cyprus, ties
with the United States and possibly renewing
Greece's military links with NATO, severed at
the height of the Cyprus crisis.
The 67-year-old Caramanlis told a news
conference he will not take a stand on whether

exiled King Constantine should be restored to
the throne and asserted, "Let the people decide
for themselves without any pressures."
Caramanlis and his New Democracy party
polled 54.5 percent of the vote Sunday and
took 214 of the 300 seats in Parliament in the
first free elections in more than a decade.
Chrysler Plants To Close
DETROIT Chrysler Corp. chairman Lynn
Townsend said yesterday t the firm plans
"substantial plant closing" in December because
of poor car sales, but added that there will be no
"companywide shutdown."
Townsend declined to be specific about the
plant closings, saying production schedules for
the rest of this year would be released soon.
Townsend said there would be many
additional layoffs in the coming two months, as
the firm trims 50,000 cars from its
fourth-quarter production schedule.
Some 26,600 Chrysler workers were on
layoffs this week, from a blue-collar workforce
numbering about 100,000.
Chrysler's auto sales in early November were
off 34 percent from a year ago and 1974
calendar year sales are down 19 percent.
Greyhound Drivers Strike
PHOENIX, Ariz. Some 16,000 bus drivers
and other employees of Greyhound Bus Lines
struck the nationwide system yesterday, but
many terminals remained open with supervisory
personnel handling telephone lines, ticket
refunds and passenger referrals.
Few passengers were reported stranded at
Greyhound Terminals, as Continental Trailways
buses and Amtrak passenger trains agreed to
honor Greyhound tickets to take travelers on
parallel routes.
The Amalgamated Transit Union's contract
with Greyhound expired at 11 a.m. PST
yesterday. Forty-eight hours of
around-the-clock negotiations failed to produce
a new contract, and the workers walked out.
Today's Weather
Fair today except patches of fog night and
morning. Increasing cloudiness tonight. Mostly
cloudy Wednesday. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the 40s to low 50s. High
today and Wednesday in the mid 50s to mid

Ford Welcomed To Japan '
TOKYO Emperor Hirohito, wearing his
imperial robes, officially welcomed President
Ford to Japan this afternoon Tokyo time.
The historic first meeting in Japan between
an American president in office and a Japanese
emperor took place under clear and sunny skies,
with security guards staring down from hotel
windows overlooking the courtyard of the
official guest house.
Other buildings near the palatial guest house,
where Ford is staying during his five-day visit,
also were under tight security. The courtyard's
iron gates were locked.
The emperor's full-dress reception was the
first official function of the President's visit, the
symbolism of which he plans to use to
strengthen already close U.S.-Japanese ties.
Rocky Adviser Defends Gift
WASHINGTON - The single largest
beneficiary of Nelson A. Rockefeller's
generosity said yesterday his acceptance of
$625,000 did not hinder his ability to act
objectively as a New York state official.
"My judgment was not warped," William J.
Ronan, a longtime friend and adviser of the
former New York governor, told the Senate
Rules Committee. The committee is considering

Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president.
"We frequently disagreed," said Ronan,
adding that if his actions as a state official
enhanced the interests of the Rockefeller
family, "that would be incidental and only
because their interests are so intimately
identified with the interests of the community
itself."
Rockefeller's gifts totaling $2.5 million to
friends and associates over the past 17 years
have become a major issue in the confirmation
hearings.
Ronan's testimony came on the last day of
the Rules Committee hearings. Chairman
Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) said the committee
probably will vote on the nomination
Wednesday, and Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield said a vote by the full Senate could
follow next week.
However, House Judiciary Committee action
on Rockefeller is expected to delay final
confirmation until around Christmas.
Philippine Envoy Held Hostage
WASHINGTON - Philippine Ambassador
Eduardo Z. Romualdez was held hostage in his
office yesterday and an aide was reported shot
by a gunman demanding that his 24-year-old son
be allowed to emigrate from the Philippines.
Philippine diplomat Jose Naldo identified the
gunman as Napoleon Gechoco, a Filipino about
40, of suburban Oxon Hill, Md., who was
demanding that his son still in the Philippines be
allowed to join his family here.
An FBI spokesman indicated late last night
that the seige at the embassy chancery could last

Constantine Caramanlis said yesterday that
democracy has returned to its birthplace and
prepared the nation for a plebiscite on the
future of the monarchy.
He also had decisions to make on Cyprus, ties
with the United States and possibly renewing
Greece's military links with NATO, severed at
the height of the Cyprus crisis.
The 67-year-old Caramanlis told a news
conference he will not take a stand on whether

exiled King Constantine should be restored to
the throne and asserted, "Let the people decide
for themselves without any pressures."
Caramanlis and his New Democracy party
polled 54.5 percent of the vote Sunday and
took 214 of the 300 seats in Parliament in the
first free elections in more than a decade.
Chrysler Plants To Close
DETROIT Chrysler Corp. chairman Lynn
Townsend said yesterday t the firm plans
"substantial plant closing" in December because
of poor car sales, but added that there will be no
"companywide shutdown."
Townsend declined to be specific about the
plant closings, saying production schedules for
the rest of this year would be released soon.
Townsend said there would be many
additional layoffs in the coming two months, as
the firm trims 50,000 cars from its
fourth-quarter production schedule.
Some 26,600 Chrysler workers were on
layoffs this week, from a blue-collar workforce
numbering about 100,000.
Chrysler's auto sales in early November were
off 34 percent from a year ago and 1974
calendar year sales are down 19 percent.
Greyhound Drivers Strike
PHOENIX, Ariz. Some 16,000 bus drivers
and other employees of Greyhound Bus Lines
struck the nationwide system yesterday, but
many terminals remained open with supervisory
personnel handling telephone lines, ticket
refunds and passenger referrals.
Few passengers were reported stranded at
Greyhound Terminals, as Continental Trailways
buses and Amtrak passenger trains agreed to
honor Greyhound tickets to take travelers on
parallel routes.
The Amalgamated Transit Union's contract
with Greyhound expired at 11 a.m. PST
yesterday. Forty-eight hours of
around-the-clock negotiations failed to produce
a new contract, and the workers walked out.
Today's Weather

Ford Welcomed To Japan '
TOKYO Emperor Hirohito, wearing his
imperial robes, officially welcomed President
Ford to Japan this afternoon Tokyo time.
The historic first meeting in Japan between
an American president in office and a Japanese
emperor took place under clear and sunny skies,
with security guards staring down from hotel
windows overlooking the courtyard of the
official guest house.
Other buildings near the palatial guest house,
where Ford is staying during his five-day visit,
also were under tight security. The courtyard's
iron gates were locked.
The emperor's full-dress reception was the
first official function of the President's visit, the
symbolism of which he plans to use to
strengthen already close U.S.-Japanese ties.
Rocky Adviser Defends Gift
WASHINGTON - The single largest
beneficiary of Nelson A. Rockefeller's
generosity said yesterday his acceptance of
$625,000 did not hinder his ability to act
objectively as a New York state official.
"My judgment was not warped," William J.
Ronan, a longtime friend and adviser of the
former New York governor, told the Senate
Rules Committee. The committee is considering

Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president.
"We frequently disagreed," said Ronan,
adding that if his actions as a state official
enhanced the interests of the Rockefeller
family, "that would be incidental and only
because their interests are so intimately
identified with the interests of the community
itself."
Rockefeller's gifts totaling $2.5 million to
friends and associates over the past 17 years
have become a major issue in the confirmation
hearings.
Ronan's testimony came on the last day of
the Rules Committee hearings. Chairman
Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) said the committee
probably will vote on the nomination
Wednesday, and Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield said a vote by the full Senate could
follow next week.
However, House Judiciary Committee action
on Rockefeller is expected to delay final
confirmation until around Christmas.
Philippine Envoy Held Hostage
WASHINGTON - Philippine Ambassador
Eduardo Z. Romualdez was held hostage in his
office yesterday and an aide was reported shot
by a gunman demanding that his 24-year-old son
be allowed to emigrate from the Philippines.
Philippine diplomat Jose Naldo identified the
gunman as Napoleon Gechoco, a Filipino about
40, of suburban Oxon Hill, Md., who was
demanding that his son still in the Philippines be
allowed to join his family here.
An FBI spokesman indicated late last night
that the seige at the embassy chancery could last
for some time, although negotiations were
continuing and Philippine authorities had agreed
to release the son if the hostages were released.
Nixon Planned Hunt Buildup
WASHINGTON Former President Richard
M. Nixon planned a publicity buildup to pave
the way to grant executive clemency to E.
Howard Hunt Jr. on the day Hunt went on trial
for the Watergate burglary, according to a White
House tape made public for the first time
yesterday.
The tapes of that conversation and several
others were played for the jury yesterday at the
Watergate cover-up trial of former Nixon
lieutenants H. R. Haldeman, John D.
Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell and re-election
committee aides Robert C. Mardian and
Kenneth W. Parkinson.
More than two months after the Jan. 8,

1973, conversation and repeatedly thereafter,
Nixon denied that he had authorized clemency
to be offered to Hunt or any other of the
seven-man burglary team because, as he told
former White House counsel John Dean, "It
would be wrong."
Meanwhile in San Clemente, a Nixon
spokesman said yesterday Nixon will not oppose
efforts of three court-appointed physicians to
see if the former president is fit to testify at the
Watergate cover-up trial.
Nixon aide Ronald Ziegler, contacted at the
Nixon home, said "there has never been any
question that they would be permitted" to
perform the examination. Sirica ordered the
three-man team of doctors to determine Nixon's
physical state.
Israelis Storm Terrorists
TEL AVIV, Israel Israeli security forces
stormed an apartment house in the Jordan River
town of Beit Shean Tuesday and killed the
members of a gang of Arab terrorists who had
seized the building and taken a number of
civilians captive, the Israeli military command
reported.
Residents of the town said three to five
terrorists seized the four-story building about 5
a.m., throwing a hand grenade as they broke in.
First reports indicated the guerrillas killed
one woman and wounded 13 persons.
The gunmen held the building for more than
three hours before Israeli forces
counter-attacked.
Earlier, Arabs demonstrated in the Old City
of Jerusalem for the first time in four years
yesterday.
For the third straight day Arabs defied Israeli
police and border troops in the occupied west
bank in a wave of nationalism sparked by the
appearance of Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasir Arafat before the United Nations.

Ford Welcomed To Japan '
TOKYO Emperor Hirohito, wearing his
imperial robes, officially welcomed President
Ford to Japan this afternoon Tokyo time.
The historic first meeting in Japan between
an American president in office and a Japanese
emperor took place under clear and sunny skies,
with security guards staring down from hotel
windows overlooking the courtyard of the
official guest house.
Other buildings near the palatial guest house,
where Ford is staying during his five-day visit,
also were under tight security. The courtyard's
iron gates were locked.
The emperor's full-dress reception was the
first official function of the President's visit, the
symbolism of which he plans to use to
strengthen already close U.S.-Japanese ties.
Rocky Adviser Defends Gift
WASHINGTON - The single largest
beneficiary of Nelson A. Rockefeller's
generosity said yesterday his acceptance of
$625,000 did not hinder his ability to act
objectively as a New York state official.
"My judgment was not warped," William J.
Ronan, a longtime friend and adviser of the
former New York governor, told the Senate
Rules Committee. The committee is considering

Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president.
"We frequently disagreed," said Ronan,
adding that if his actions as a state official
enhanced the interests of the Rockefeller
family, "that would be incidental and only
because their interests are so intimately
identified with the interests of the community
itself."
Rockefeller's gifts totaling $2.5 million to
friends and associates over the past 17 years
have become a major issue in the confirmation
hearings.
Ronan's testimony came on the last day of
the Rules Committee hearings. Chairman
Howard W. Cannon (D-Nev.) said the committee
probably will vote on the nomination
Wednesday, and Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield said a vote by the full Senate could
follow next week.
However, House Judiciary Committee action
on Rockefeller is expected to delay final
confirmation until around Christmas.
Philippine Envoy Held Hostage
WASHINGTON - Philippine Ambassador
Eduardo Z. Romualdez was held hostage in his
office yesterday and an aide was reported shot
by a gunman demanding that his 24-year-old son
be allowed to emigrate from the Philippines.
Philippine diplomat Jose Naldo identified the
gunman as Napoleon Gechoco, a Filipino about
40, of suburban Oxon Hill, Md., who was
demanding that his son still in the Philippines be
allowed to join his family here.
An FBI spokesman indicated late last night
that the seige at the embassy chancery could last
for some time, although negotiations were
continuing and Philippine authorities had agreed
to release the son if the hostages were released.
Nixon Planned Hunt Buildup
WASHINGTON Former President Richard
M. Nixon planned a publicity buildup to pave
the way to grant executive clemency to E.
Howard Hunt Jr. on the day Hunt went on trial
for the Watergate burglary, according to a White
House tape made public for the first time
yesterday.
The tapes of that conversation and several
others were played for the jury yesterday at the
Watergate cover-up trial of former Nixon
lieutenants H. R. Haldeman, John D.
Ehrlichman, John N. Mitchell and re-election
committee aides Robert C. Mardian and
Kenneth W. Parkinson.
More than two months after the Jan. 8,

1973, conversation and repeatedly thereafter,
Nixon denied that he had authorized clemency
to be offered to Hunt or any other of the
seven-man burglary team because, as he told
former White House counsel John Dean, "It
would be wrong."
Meanwhile in San Clemente, a Nixon
spokesman said yesterday Nixon will not oppose
efforts of three court-appointed physicians to
see if the former president is fit to testify at the
Watergate cover-up trial.
Nixon aide Ronald Ziegler, contacted at the
Nixon home, said "there has never been any
question that they would be permitted" to
perform the examination. Sirica ordered the
three-man team of doctors to determine Nixon's
physical state.
Israelis Storm Terrorists
TEL AVIV, Israel Israeli security forces
stormed an apartment house in the Jordan River
town of Beit Shean Tuesday and killed the
members of a gang of Arab terrorists who had
seized the building and taken a number of
civilians captive, the Israeli military command
reported.
Residents of the town said three to five
terrorists seized the four-story building about 5
a.m., throwing a hand grenade as they broke in.
First reports indicated the guerrillas killed
one woman and wounded 13 persons.
The gunmen held the building for more than
three hours before Israeli forces
counter-attacked.
Earlier, Arabs demonstrated in the Old City
of Jerusalem for the first time in four years
yesterday.
For the third straight day Arabs defied Israeli
police and border troops in the occupied west
bank in a wave of nationalism sparked by the
appearance of Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasir Arafat before the United Nations.
Greek Leader Takes Landslide
ATHENS, Greece Armed with the biggest
electoral victory in Greek history, Premier
Constantine Caramanlis said yesterday that
democracy has returned to its birthplace and
prepared the nation for a plebiscite on the
future of the monarchy.
He also had decisions to make on Cyprus, ties
with the United States and possibly renewing
Greece's military links with NATO, severed at
the height of the Cyprus crisis.
The 67-year-old Caramanlis told a news
conference he will not take a stand on whether

exiled King Constantine should be restored to
the throne and asserted, "Let the people decide
for themselves without any pressures."
Caramanlis and his New Democracy party
polled 54.5 percent of the vote Sunday and
took 214 of the 300 seats in Parliament in the
first free elections in more than a decade.
Chrysler Plants To Close
DETROIT Chrysler Corp. chairman Lynn
Townsend said yesterday t the firm plans
"substantial plant closing" in December because
of poor car sales, but added that there will be no
"companywide shutdown."
Townsend declined to be specific about the
plant closings, saying production schedules for
the rest of this year would be released soon.
Townsend said there would be many
additional layoffs in the coming two months, as
the firm trims 50,000 cars from its
fourth-quarter production schedule.
Some 26,600 Chrysler workers were on
layoffs this week, from a blue-collar workforce
numbering about 100,000.
Chrysler's auto sales in early November were
off 34 percent from a year ago and 1974
calendar year sales are down 19 percent.
Greyhound Drivers Strike
PHOENIX, Ariz. Some 16,000 bus drivers
and other employees of Greyhound Bus Lines
struck the nationwide system yesterday, but
many terminals remained open with supervisory
personnel handling telephone lines, ticket
refunds and passenger referrals.
Few passengers were reported stranded at
Greyhound Terminals, as Continental Trailways
buses and Amtrak passenger trains agreed to
honor Greyhound tickets to take travelers on
parallel routes.
The Amalgamated Transit Union's contract
with Greyhound expired at 11 a.m. PST
yesterday. Forty-eight hours of
around-the-clock negotiations failed to produce
a new contract, and the workers walked out.
Today's Weather
