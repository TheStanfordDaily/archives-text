# Engineering Course's Project
## A
						Masterpiece In A Minute 
### JON BIGELOW 
Some departments here offer the
opportunity to do independent research. In
others one can argue with celebrated geniuses
in the field.
However, there's at least one department
which offers the opportunity to roll raw eggs
off ramps onto newsprint' and to pop
paint-filled balloons in a crowded room.
That department is mechanical engineering,
and the particular course where such antics are
part of the classroom experience is "Visual
Thinking," taught by Prof. Robert McKim and
Acting Asst. Prof. William Verplank.
Yesterday afternoon, McKim and
Verplank's students got to show off some
imagination and ingenuity as each
demonstrated a design project called "The
Marvelous One-Minute Masterpipce Machine."
One-Minute Process
The specific requirements were to "design
and build a device into which you insert a
blank canvas 18 inches by 24 inches made of
mat board. Insertion shall trigger a one-minute
process, during which the machine draws,
paints, assembles or somehow deposits on the
surface of the mat board a pleasing design or
pattern."

There were several restrictions: no other
human activity but the insertion itself was
allowed in the process, there was a 60-second
time limit, use of electric power was
prohibited and a $5 limit was set on the cost
of materials.
The results were incredibly varied. Many of
the art machines utilized swinging weights, or
rolling golf balls. A few long-fused firecrackers
exploded inside cardboard boxes and
splattered poster paint on the canvases. One
imaginative student converted a felt pen into a
top, and came up with an elaborate design.
Hamster's Performance
Cheryl Williamson, a junior in architecture,
devised one of the most entertaining
contraptions. She brought a maze and a
hamster, and rigged trip wires in the maze so
that her hamster tipped over small dishes of
paint onto her canvas. The hamster performed
perfectly, and as he arrived right on time at
the other end of his journey, the crowd of
spectators cheered.
Not everyone had that kind of luck. In
fact, only about half of the projects worked as
their designers had intended.
"It worked so well this morning," one
dejected student lamented after his project

failed.
There were other problems. Freshman
Glenn Hudson's paint-coated balloons popped
on schedule, but splattered his face as well as
his canvas.
'Loosening Up'
McKim sympathized. "I don't mind if the
projects fail. This is intended to be a
loosening-up exercise. Rather than start out
serious, we try to open up creativity and then
later get serious."
Many students used waterwheels and
slowly falling weights to synchronize the
timing of their machines. McKim explained
that this aspect of the project taught the
students much about friction and other
problems of engineering.
Freshman Jim Favaro felt he learned
something more. "It took a lot of work, and I
learned a lot about perseverance," he said.
But their efforts were worthwhile. "There's
a lot of ingenious stuff here," McKim said,
surveying the scene.
Looking around at the weird, surrealistic
machines with bobbing weights and spinning
dowels, one could only agree. As one
spectator said, "If Rube Goldberg were here,
he'd be embarrassed.

IS IT ART?—These students seem to think so. This "Marvelous One-Minute Masterpiece
Machine" was one of many designed for a mechanical engineering class exhibiting its creative
visual thinking.
