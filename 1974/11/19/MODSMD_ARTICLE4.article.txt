# Senate Saves Bonfire After Heated Debate
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The Big Game Bonfire could have
gone up in smoke last night.
After refusing to contribute $75 to
the event, the ASSU Senate rejected a
resolution to call "on University
Relations and the Athletic Department
to suspend their support of the
Bonfire" by a 13-4 vote.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape said during the meeting that " if
the Senate rejects the spirit of the
Bonfire, then University support will
be lifted."
The University has pledged $2OO to
the Bonfire. According to Snape, the
Senate's final decision to withhold
money from the pre-Big Game event
"will have no effect on the
University's contribution."
It now appears that the Bonfire will
be held Friday night as planned.
A Tradition
Proponents called the Bonfire a
tradition that should be reinstituted.
"It's unfair to let the Bonfire die out
without letting everyone experience
it," said Bonfire Committee Chairman
Tom Pedreira. "It will be an enjoyable
experience, with student friendship
and school spirit."
The Bonfire has been canceled the
past two years because of rain and lack
of interest.
Joel Plaisance, a co-terminal
environmental engineering student,
pointed to the "insignificant impact"
of the Bonfire on air pollution in the
Bay Area. "The ecological arguments
against it aren't valid," he said.
Environment Affected
However, Bonfire opponents
insisted that the environment would
be affected. "The Bonfire will result in
one-tenth of the pollution emitted
everyday at San Francisco Airport,"
said Stanford Conservation Group
President Loren Bloch.
"But there's something deeper than
that," Bloch said. "It is the implicit
gesture. The Bonfire symbolizes the
days when things weren't so pressing.
There's a lackadaisical attitude, a
miserable attitude at Stanford while
everything is rotten in Denmark."
Sen. Tim Conway countered that
the "implicit gesture" of the Bonfire
was positive. "We're burning a bunch

of junk wood that will probably be
burned anyway," he said. "This is a
common cause and a feeling of
camaraderie that is very important."
Appropriations
Opponents also suggested that the
money appropriated for the event
could be used elsewhere. "I wish the
same support could be given to
another activity," said ASSU Vice
President Ann Carter. Sen. Janice
Haney and Bloch suggested an open
party in Lake Lagunita with free beer.
"The bonfire is 10 tons of wood,
spewing pollution into the air. There's
definitely damage being done. With a
party, you don't spit in the face of our
scarce resources," Bloch said.
Haney said, "The Bonfire is a
funeral pyre for the age of the 60s.
Alternative activities could be found."
Sen. Maria Echaveste added, "If it

takes the Bonfire to bring the Stanford
community together, then we are in
bad shape."
Many observers thought the action
to give no position on the Bonfire
reflected the Senate's unwillingness to
speak for the entire student body.
ASSU President Mike Herman said,
"I think that when they [the senators]
voted against funding the Bonfire,
they were saying that they opposed it.
Then, when they refused to call on the
University to suspend support, they
were saying that they cannot represent
the students."
Herman questioned "why we go to
the trouble of Senate elections
without representation by the
Senate."
Sen. Lyse Strnad said during the
meeting, "It's time the Senate said
something and offered an opinion."
