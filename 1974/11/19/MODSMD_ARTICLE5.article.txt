# 'Open File' Provision Becomes Law Today
## 
### BOB LOWE 
A federal law granting students
greater access to their files goes into
effect today. However, the
University's opposition to parts of the
law and a second look by Congress
could keep students here from ever
seeing confidential letters written
about them.
Effects of the law, authored by
Sen. James Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.),
already have been felt in the freshman
admissions office, according to Dean
of Admissions Fred Hargadon.
Hargadon said that some high
school administrators are sending less
information about their students than
last year, apparently because of
apprehension about the law.
"We get some reports sent back,
enclosing simply the transcript but no
recommendation," Hargadon said.
"Usually, you get a letter from a
counselor or someone," in addition to
required teacher recommendations.
'Overreactidn'
Hargadon added that a few schools

won't 6ven send class rankings. He
attributed the problem to
"overreaction" by the high schools.
Hargadon said that the admissions
office here is not operating any
differently than usual. "Given our
interpretation of the law, and also in
anticipation of amendments to the
law, it won't change the information
we obtain nor the way we get it," he
said.
The Buckley amendment probably
won't cause much change for students
who are already here, either.
University Registrar Sally Mahoney
said that in her office, students won't
see any more of their files than they
could before the law took effect.
'No Need'
Acting President William Miller has
said that the recommendation letters
"are not, and there is no need for
them to be, used in connection with a
student's career at Stanford after
admission."
However, Miller has noted that in
cases where "our admissions decisions
are challenged," access will be allowed
"upon agreement from the President's
office.
Miller has directed Mahoney and
other University officials to pull
confidential letters out of these files in
the registrar's office and store them
separately.
Amendments Likely
It appears likely that Congress will
back the University in its concern over
confidentiality by amending the law in
the next month.
Buckley is planning to introduce
two amendments to the law which will
pull out many teeth of the provision
opening confidential letters to
students.
Buckley's legislative assistant, John
Kwapisz, said yesterday that the
senator soon will introduce one
amendment which would make the
law invalid for letters written before
today.
Another amendment would enable
students to sign away their right to see
a letter.
"If the student wanted to have
access to a letter, he would tell the
