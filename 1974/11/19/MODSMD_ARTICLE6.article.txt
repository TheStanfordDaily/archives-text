# Students Debate Record Co-Op

### KATHY BATTS 
The student turnout for this week's
special fee assessment election will
determine if there is a market for the
proposed record co-op, ASSU Vice
President Ann Carter said yesterday.
Carter made the statement in a
joint news conference with ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri and
Asst. Financial Manager Tom
Fitzgerald. The conference was called
in order to resolve several
contradictory statements recently
made regarding both the record co-op
and the fee assessment on it.
A basic disagreement has existed
between the financial managers, and
ASSU Vice President Len Mackey,
undergraduate Lance Friedmann and
Carter, authors of the co-op proposal.
Olivieri and Fitzgerald have said they
do not think there is enough demand
for the co-op to warrant a student fee
assessment.
Carter has said that the voter

turnout tomorrow and Thursday will
serve as a market survey to show if
there is a demand.
Demand Indicator
"If a lot of students vote for the fee
assessment, I think that would indicate
that there is a demand for an
on-campus record shop with lower
prices and a wider selection than the
Bookstore," Carter said.
"On the other hand, if only 10
students vote in the election, there is
obviously no market for a co-op."
The $1 assessment will provide up
to $11,500 in funding to subsidize the
co-op. Given the approximate 10
percent loss to student refunds,
Fitzgerald said the co-op would have
about $lO,OOO with which to work.
'ASSU Like It'
Entitled "ASSU Like It," the co-op
will be located at the Bookstore's
current record display. Backers of the
proposal claim they will be able to sell
records at an average of 11 cents lower

than the Bookstore's current prices.
"However," noted Friedmann," 70
percent of our records will normally
list for $6.98, which we will sell for
$4.34. That's 18 cents lower than the
Bookstore."
Friedmann also said that one in five
records will be sold at a sale price of
around $3.77.
Breaking Even
Present statistics indicate that the
co-op will have to increase record sales
from the Bookstore's current $41,000
annual income to $54,000 to break
even. Carter predicted that they could
expect sales of $61,00,0 the first year,
for a profit of $lOOO. Both Olivieri
and Fitzgerald are skeptical that the
venture could do so well the first year.
"Personally, I'd really like to see
the thing work," Fitzgerald added.
"But looking at it from a financial
manager's viewpoint, I've got to be
skeptical. They're dealing with a lot of
other people's money."
