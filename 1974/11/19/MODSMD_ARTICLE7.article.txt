## editorial Fee Assessments! 
### 
The Daily urges a NO vote on both $1 fee assessments in the
election tomorrow and Thursday.
In a time of great economic uncertainty, the Record Co-op
proposal does not have enough economic flexibility or soundness to
ensure financial success.
Increases in costs may force the co-op to raise prices or lose
projected paper-thin profits in a market that is unsurveyed and
unknown.
The authors of the proposal expect to reap an additional $20,000
in gross sales over the Bookstore's present intake by dropping the
price 18 cents, a very questionable projection. Furthermore, at the
18-cent reduction rate, students will have to buy six records just to
get their dollar back.
If the co-op makes money, the record buyers are subsidizing
themselves. If it loses money, then the student body will only be
subsidizing the record buyers.
Neither result warrants the passage of the record co-op fee
assessment.
We also urge a NO vote on the proposed fee assessment for Live
Oak.
Live Oak has provided the community with a valuable service, and
its editorial quality has improved a great deal over the past two
months. If we thought this fee assessment was necessary for the
paper's survival, we would not hesitate to endorse it.
But Live Oak has done little to explain just what the money will be
used for. When a group is asking for $11,500 of student funds, it must
assume the burden of showing how and why it needs the money and
exactly where it will be spent. Live Oak has not done so; in fact, the
fee assessment hasn't even been mentioned in the pages of Live Oak
despite the fact that three issues have appeared since the election was
scheduled.
In the past, the Daily has supported fee assessments that would
fund competitive publications. But we have also opposed fee
assessments that were poorly planned or publicized. We believe the
Live Oak proposal falls into the latter category. The Daily and KZSU,
when asking for fee assessments in past years, have submitted detailed
budgets and financial briefs. Live Oak hasn't bothered to.
If Live Oak really needs the money, then we urge it to try again for
a fee assessment during spring quarter with a more cohesive plan.
Until then, however, we urge a NO vote.
