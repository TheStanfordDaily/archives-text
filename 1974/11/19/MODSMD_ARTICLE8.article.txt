# Bonfire Pollutes
## 
### Richard C. Pasco 
I was disappointed to read in
the Nov. 13 Daily that the Big
Game Bonfire is on again this
year, and I was angered to read
your editorial and Jim Dewell's
column supporting it. The reasons
for cancelling the Bonfire should
not be dismissed as easily as they
were.
On the environmental side, are
we to believe that 4.37 tons of
soot, oil, smoke, ash and other
trash dumped into the air we
beathe is "not much"? That San
Francisco Airport pollutes more is
no justification for us also to
pollute, especially in such an
unnecessary way as a Bonfire
from which no one materially
gains.
Another environmental aspect
which hasn't been considered is
what happens to the remnants on
the ground which don't
completely burn? Surely there
will be cinders, and of the 200
gallons of oil some is certain to
soak into the lakebed. Then next
spring when the lake is filled these
substances will come floating to
the surface.
No Small Luxury
The economics run deeper than
the simplistic question of whether
the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
can raise the money. Does being
able to pay for 200 gallons of fuel
oil give one the right to burn it
waste fully on a small luxury,
when some families shiver because
they can't afford to heat their
homes through the winter?
Technically it may, but I
would feel a lot more respect
toward the IFC if after raising the
money to buy the oil it was to
donate it to some appropriate
cause instead of burning it.
Dewell's almost sarcastic
suggestion that Bonfire watchers
"cut back on the use of their cars
Thursday and Friday" deserves
examination. Using

figures, a car emits less than one
pound of pollutants per 10 miles,
so to compensate for the 9000
pounds to be belched by the
Bonfire would require that each of
3000 Bonfire watchers walk more
than 30 miles those days that they
would normally drive, and not
drive to the Bonfire, either!
I doubt that this would
happen. Requesting only "those
who worry about such things"
(sadly too few) to "cut back on
their driving 10 percent or so" is
asking a few to carry the burden
of many. They probably already
have cut back (I have), but this is
far to little to compensate for the
Bonfire. Such unthinking,
irresponsible proposals as Dewell's
deserve censure.
Disgraceful Waste
I dispute two claims made in
the editorial. The first claim is
that the Bonfire will "bring the
entire Stanford community
together." This is false,
considering the many people like
myself who will avoid that
disgrace. The second is that it
"eases life's burdens for so many
people." How this works is
beyond me. That Stanford is
burning tons of wood and oil does
not pay the rent, cure the sick,
feed the hungry or heat the
home. Surely there are more
effective ways of easing people's
burdens!
I call upon the Stanford
community to become aware of
its responsibility to set an
example, in minimizing pollution
and serving the community, by
halting the Bonfire. I urge
potential donors to withhold their
financial support, and I urge
concerned citizens to protest the
construction and not to attend
the Bonfire.
