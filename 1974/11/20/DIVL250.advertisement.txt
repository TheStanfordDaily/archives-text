Cyclesack
The Unique Bike Bag
it
Unsnap two snaps, untie two ties and
your colorful orange Cyclesack is a
shoulder bag. Unbeatable for .school,
picnics, cycle touring, shopping and just
plain carrying stuff from place to place.
Constructed of heavy, durable sail-cloth,
the Cyclesack has two large pouches
that will accommodate Books, Sweaters,
Food, Spirits, etc. but yet not interfere
with operation of bike; and two outside
pockets, great for carrying cigarettes,
sunglasses, suntan lotion, etc. Believe it
