# Horn's Students Await Their 'Moment Of Truth'
## The
						Man Many Call Stanford's Kingsfield Leads His Public Law Students On A 'Paper Chase' 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
The students sit, nervous and tense,
awaiting what one called "the moment
of truth."
"You know he's gonna call on
you," the student explained. "You
know he's gonna call on you, and you
know he'll find something you don't
know about."
The professor takes his time making
a complicated legal point, then fires
off a question. "What did the court
hold in that case?" A pause. "Mr.
Smith?"
"Some students usually know the
answer, and some never do," one
student recalled. "But nobody always
does. Sooner or later, he'll get you."
A scene from Prof. Kingsfield's
class in The Paper Chase?
Only A Movie?
Almost, but not quite. Rather, a
typical day in a class given by the man
many people call "Stanford's
Kingsfield" Political Science Prof.
Robert Horn, who teaches three
popular undergraduate courses in
public law.
A graffito on the blackboard of one
of Horn's classes last year read,
"Would you like to see this class in a
movie? Go see the Paper Chase!"
And although many students feel
that Kingsfield, that film's stereotyped,
stiff-upper-lipped Harvard law
professor, resembles Horn only in his
teaching method, one said, "They're
both pretty pompous."
The class format which has gained
Horn his formidable reputation
consists of lectures and case
discussions, in which he calls on
various students to answer questions.
"The case method," Horn
explained, "was developed at Harvard
in the late 19th century. It was a real
revolution in the method of teaching
law."
Heavy Workload
Of course, not all students agree
that Horn's teaching methods are the
best. One girl complained, "It's easier
to learn from someone who gives less
work, but is more interested in his
students."
And a senior, calling Horn
"intellectually arrogant" and
"pretentious," charged: "In his case
discussions, he probes around until he

finds someone who obviously doesn't
understand the material or doesn't
know it, and then he kicks him for the
entire period."
But Horn denied that he "picks on"
any particular students. "I think I'm
pretty random in choosing students,"
he commented.
Horn added that he wasn't aware of
comparisons between his classes and
those taught by the mythical
Kingsfield. He noted that anyone
attending a "good" law school would
have "four courses, about as much
work."
No Casualties Yet
"I've never had anybody die of
overwork on me yet," he continued.
However, a student who left Stanford
for Yale law school three years ago
commented, "I worked harder in
Horn's course than in any of my
courses at Yale."
Horn suggested that students like
the format and workload. "I think
students do come in looking for a
challenge," he stated, adding that
"bright, able people like to engage in
an argument."
Prof. Hubert Marshall, who joined
the political science faculty in 1953 at
the same time as Horn, agreed. "Horn
has attracted into his courses and
trained some of the brightest and
ablest students in the department," he
said.
And yet, as another professor

SPOT THE RINGER—The resemblance between Political Science Prof. Robert A. Horn and the Professor Kingsfield character in the Paper Chase (middle) is
limited to their teaching styles. However, to the students who try in vain to catch him in error, Horn is king of his field. "He's never wrong " claimed one student.
Horn is not well known for research in the political science field, but one of his colleagues explains, "He's a teacher, not a scholar."
