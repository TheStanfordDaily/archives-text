# Horn's Students Await Their 'Moment Of Truth'
## The 						Man Many Call Stanford's Kingsfield Leads His Public Law Students On A 'Paper Chase' 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
The students sit, nervous and tense,
awaiting what one called "the moment
of truth."
"You know he's gonna call on
you," the student explained. "You
know he's gonna call on you, and you
know he'll find something you don't
know about."
The professor takes his time making
a complicated legal point, then fires
off a question. "What did the court
hold in that case?" A pause. "Mr.
Smith?"
"Some students usually know the
answer, and some never do," one
student recalled. "But nobody always
does. Sooner or later, he'll get you."
A scene from Prof. Kingsfield's
class in The Paper Chase?
Only A Movie?
Almost, but not quite. Rather, a
typical day in a class given by the man
many people call "Stanford's
Kingsfield" Political Science Prof.
Robert Horn, who teaches three
popular undergraduate courses in
public law.
A graffito on the blackboard of one
of Horn's classes last year read,
"Would you like to see this class in a
movie? Go see the Paper Chase!"
And although many students feel
that Kingsfield, that film's stereotyped,
stiff-upper-lipped Harvard law
professor, resembles Horn only in his
teaching method, one said, "They're
both pretty pompous."
The class format which has gained
Horn his formidable reputation
consists of lectures and case
discussions, in which he calls on
various students to answer questions.
"The case method," Horn
explained, "was developed at Harvard
in the late 19th century. It was a real
revolution in the method of teaching
law."
Heavy Workload
Of course, not all students agree
that Horn's teaching methods are the
best. One girl complained, "It's easier
to learn from someone who gives less
work, but is more interested in his
students."
And a senior, calling Horn
"intellectually arrogant" and
"pretentious," charged: "In his case
discussions, he probes around until he

finds someone who obviously doesn't
understand the material or doesn't
know it, and then he kicks him for the
entire period."
But Horn denied that he "picks on"
any particular students. "I think I'm
pretty random in choosing students,"
he commented.
Horn added that he wasn't aware of
comparisons between his classes and
those taught by the mythical
Kingsfield. He noted that anyone
attending a "good" law school would
have "four courses, about as much
work."
No Casualties Yet
"I've never had anybody die of
overwork on me yet," he continued.
However, a student who left Stanford
for Yale law school three years ago
commented, "I worked harder in
Horn's course than in any of my
courses at Yale."
Horn suggested that students like
the format and workload. "I think
students do come in looking for a
challenge," he stated, adding that
"bright, able people like to engage in
an argument."
Prof. Hubert Marshall, who joined
the political science faculty in 1953 at
the same time as Horn, agreed. "Horn
has attracted into his courses and
trained some of the brightest and
ablest students in the department," he
said.
And yet, as another professor

SPOT THE RINGERâ€”The resemblance between Political Science Prof. Robert A. Horn and the Professor Kingsfield character in the Paper Chase (middle) is
limited to their teaching styles. However, to the students who try in vain to catch him in error, Horn is king of his field. "He's never wrong " claimed one student.
Horn is not well known for research in the political science field, but one of his colleagues explains, "He's a teacher, not a scholar."
pointed out, most students are liberals,
while Horn is "either the most
conservative member or among the
most conservative members" of the
department.
Classroom Conservatism *
"I suspect I am the most
conservative," Horn agreed. And he
admitted that his views come across in
class, as many have accused: "I don't
know how you can avoid giving
political views when you're teaching
politics."
But he said he doesn't try to
convert anyone: "I know that's
futile." He noted that his are minority
views, but that he thinks his students
should be exposed to them. "If liberals
aren't challenged enough, they tend to
get rather sloppy in their arguments."
And when those in his classes are,
he's quick to catch it, which led one
student to complain, "Why didn't
Horn just become a lawyer?"
In fact, he almost did.
"It's more or less sheer accident
that I'm a political scientist," he
mused. "I really wanted to be a
lawyer."
Hard Times
But times were hard when Horn,
born and raised in Ohio, received his
bachelor's degree in history from Ohio
Wesleyan in 1937. During the
Depression, he explained, "financial
aid for law school was almost unheard
of."

Instead, he received a fellowship and
studied at Princeton and Harvard,
finally receiving his Ph.D. in political
science from Princeton in 1942. He
received his first teaching experience
as a graduate student at Harvard,
where he also took several law courses.
Horn was drafted into the Army
shortly after receiving his doctorate,
and became a lieutenant. But he
admitted having trouble with Officers'
Candidate School because, in his
words, "I was never very physically
coordinated."
After receiving his commission, he
taught at the Public Information
School, where, during one lecture, he
committed a most un-Kingsfield-like
act.
As Horn lectured, a student in the
front row held up a sheet of paper, but
try as he might, Horn couldn't read it.
After the lecture, the student came up
to him and showed him the piece of
paper. It read: "Your fly is open."
Horn recalled, "I believe I started
the next day's lecture with something
like, 'I understand that some of you
noticed a gap in my lecture yesterday.'
About half the class broke up."
When the war ended, Horn received
an offer to teach at the University of
Chicago. He accepted, and began
teaching public law using much the
same format he uses now.
Varied Assignments
He volunteered for service in Korea
and was sent to Tokyo to work in the

field of psychological warfare. In 1953
he joined the Stanford faculty. He
admits things have changed here since
he came, and laments the decreased
emphasis on "liberal education."
Horn spends a lot of time preparing
for his courses. "It takes a lot of work
to make people think, and that's what
he does," one student pointed out.
Student opinion was divided on
how open he is to his students,
although one graduate student said
simply, "He loves to teach."
On the other hand, one professor
called Horn "not the kind of person
who has a following of students that
he takes into his home and knows
personally." The professor added that
Horn "is not an active participant in
research," but he nevertheless teaches
enough to make up for it..
"His academic standards are high,"
he explained, "and his is teaching we
can be proud of."
