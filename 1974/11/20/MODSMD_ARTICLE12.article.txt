# Administration Not Always Wrong
## 
### William Ross 
The announcement last week that the
University faces a $1.6 million deficit for
1974-75 should have killed any lingering
hopes for an early end to either persistent
tuition increases or to student housing
shortages.
Students might as well resign themselves
to the continuance of these dual evils. We
can't prevent the recession from hitting
Stanford. President Ford can wear his WIN
buttons and mouth inanities about driving
slower and turning off lights, but I doubt if
many students will follow such simplistic
nostrums.
But at least students can realize that
Stanford's money crunch is a manifestation
of the national recession, and refrain from
unwarranted criticism of the University's
planning procedures.
Critics of Stanford's planning are correct
in noting that the roots of the current
problems lie in the University's expansion
during the 1950s and 19605. Between 1949
and 1969 the University's endowment
increased from $35 million to $270 million.
Faculty size tripled and academic prestige
soared. During this time, the University
acquired many commitments that are now a
burden to maintain. But to assert that the
University was wrong to expand during this
time is plainly absurd.
The Prosperous Years
During those prosperous years, the
University had no reason to assume that
federal grants would some day decline, or
that the value of its stocks would evaporate
in the wake of inflation and a bear market.
Although the University may have
over-extended itself somewhat during these
years and deprived endowment in preference
to building programs, it is possible that
without such expansion, Stanford today
would be struggling for its very survival as a
small institution.
Furthermore, the University's financial

planning long has been exemplary.
Planners in the 19505, while obviously
unable to second-guess the American
economy of the future, recognized the need
to conserve financial resources. Several
policies adopted then are now serving the
University well in a time of need.
In 1959 for example, Stanford became the
first American university to develop 10-year
financial forecasts to aid annual budgeting.
The $ll4 million PACE campaign of
1959-64 set up a $6 million contingency
fund from which the University is now
drawing. Attempts to set University
expenditures on a stable level and trim
unnecessary costs started as early as 1969
when the Budget Adjustment Program
eliminated $6 million in expenditures.
Planning Not Sloppy
Clearly, the University's current crisis is
not due to sloppy planning by its financial
experts.
I am also bothered by students who have
compared the University's response to its
financial crisis unfavorably to that of schools
such as Harvard. They note that Harvard has
met its housing shortage by declaring a
moratorium on transfer students and
reducing freshman admissions. Those
students who advocate that Stanford should
do the same, fail to realize crucial differences
in the financial situations of the two schools.
As a far older school than Stanford,
Harvard has had more years to solicit funds
from alumni. In contrast, this University
lived off Leland Stanford's bequest until the
1930s and was unable to establish a regular
fund raising trend tradition until the 19505.
For these and other reasons, Harvard's
endowment is now four times larger than
that of Stanford.
Harvard can afford to slice its admissions.
But as President Lyman has observed, any
cuts in Stanford's admissions would deprive
the University of essential tuition money

without enabling Stanford to cut costs by a
commensurate percentage.
Reductions Would Backfire
Any reduction in the endowment to lower
tuition or to build new student housing
would backfire, since it would reduce
income, inevitably creating the need to raise
tuition or cut academic programs.
Since tuition constitutes 43 percent of the
University's income, the Administration has
no choice but to continue to raise it as
inflation forces up costs.
Here again, one sees the national recession
reflected in Stanford's plight. Last year,
Stanford lost $2 million in the stock market
slide, experienced a 13 percent decline in
government research constracts and awards
during the last quarter, and was hit by an
eight percent rate of inflation.
Stanford is not alone in its problems. All
major private universities, dependent upon
grants, gifts and tuition, are caught in a
financial crunch. For example, the University
of Pennsylvania last month revealed a
$500,000 deficit for the current year, noting
that the declining stock market prices wiped
out $1.5 million in projected securities
income.
Meanwhile, state universities are
under the control of legislatures that have
suddenly discovered "fiscal responsibility."
Perhaps hardest hit of all are the small private
colleges, many of which are on the verge of
folding.
So, it appears that Stanford's financial
woes can't be dissolved by a change in
University policy. Students who wish to
complain about the housing shortage and
rising tuition would be wiser to blame the
Ford Administration, the oil shieks or the
enigmatic forces of the stock market than to
criticize the University's policies.
