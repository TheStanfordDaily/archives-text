# It's As Vern Said--It's Up To You!

Last week, amidst the
noontime hour traffic of White
Plaza, Berkeley radio broadcaster
Vern Grimsley spoke about
religious questions that university
students are most often puzzled
by.
His topics covered the gamut
of queries which he has
confronted in dealing with
students from the University of
California at Berkeley. He stated
that religion is an experience, not
of mind alone, but of the whole
person, a commitment to living by
faith in God and in the Family of
all Humanity, in synchrony with
our highest values.
"The essence of the teachings
of Jesus is the Way of Love and
Service. He came to teach that we
are children of God, and that by
faith we can appropriate this truth
in our personal experience. You as
an individual are known and loved
by God, with whom you may
have spiritual fellowship this
very instant. But finding God is a
decision, a deliberate exercise of
your own God-given free will."
Grimsley said that every
doubt which a person may carry
about the vitality of a belief in
spiritual realities is capable of
being resolved by a test. Like true
scientists, Vern said we should be
willing to donate some time to
this "live and momentous
option." He quoted the Roman
Stoic Epictetus who said that all
one need do is to go to a quiet
place and honestly open one's
heart, then will one know if all
that God-talk is true. That is the
acid test, Vern said. It is
impossible to verify the existence
of such a Being by philosophic
inquiry, since God is Spirit.
'Not A Grandfather'
"God is not a cosmic
grandfather who sits on a
cumulonimbus cloud strumming
his great white beard while
recording all our Faults with a red
marker in the debit column, and
all our good deeds with black
marks in the credit column. He is
the First Source and Center of all
things and beings who loves each
and every one of his children with

an infinite love."
Though there was not one
heckler bothering Vern, which as
he said was his usual experience in
talking to the people at the
Berkeley campus, a number of
people attended the preacher's
hour long talk. These people were
not only greeted by Vern's "glad
tidings" but also by a number of
supporters from the Berkeley
area, where Vern heads a
non-denominational, non-profit
foundation.
Vern stated that he had a
number of radio broadcasts
around the world, including such
places as England, Ceylon and
Africa. He has been encouraged
by the good response which he
has received from these places.
From such response, and from his
dialogue with numerous students
concerning Jesus' life and
thoughts, Vern is convinced that
the planet is now "in the midst of
a Spiritual Renaissance which is

ultimately bound to make more
differences in this world than any
war which has ever been waged,
any battle which has ever been
fought, any political, social or
economic upheaval in all of
human history."
Enthusiasm Appreciated
This student very much
appreciated Vern's enthusiasm. In
this time of political, social and
economic riptides, it is refreshing
to hear such words. If Vern is
correct in saying that faith is not
just a justification for weakness,
but a substantiation of strength, it
would seem that in this time of
energy shortage, faith is indeed an
Option which should be honestly
considered by every individual.
More true than the often
quoted phrase "We are what we
eat," is the phrase, "We are what
we think." Our self image is that
which shapes our whole future; if
it is that of a "good doctor" or a
"good lawyer" that, then, will be

the limit of our potential, our
peak; that image serves as the
basis of our life.
If we would envision ourselves
as children of the Creator,
infinitely loved by that God, how
much broader would be our
horizons for achivement! This is
not to say that being a good
doctor excludes the possibility of
realizing that one has been
"created in the image of God." It
is to say that it makes a
tremendous difference which one
values more, being God's person
or being the best doctor on the
ward.
Try living first as God's person,
then as that doctor who is able to
serve others see if it doesn't
lead to happier living. It is your
decision; no priest, evangelist,
book, creed or friend can make it
for you. "He who seeks will find."

Try living first as God's person,
then as that doctor who is able to
serve others see if it doesn't
lead to happier living. It is your
decision; no priest, evangelist,
book, creed or friend can make it
for you. "He who seeks will find."

Last week, amidst the
noontime hour traffic of White
Plaza, Berkeley radio broadcaster
Vern Grimsley spoke about
religious questions that university
students are most often puzzled
by.
His topics covered the gamut
of queries which he has
confronted in dealing with
students from the University of
California at Berkeley. He stated
that religion is an experience, not
of mind alone, but of the whole
person, a commitment to living by
faith in God and in the Family of
all Humanity, in synchrony with
our highest values.
"The essence of the teachings
of Jesus is the Way of Love and
Service. He came to teach that we
are children of God, and that by
faith we can appropriate this truth
in our personal experience. You as
an individual are known and loved
by God, with whom you may
have spiritual fellowship this
very instant. But finding God is a
decision, a deliberate exercise of
your own God-given free will."
Grimsley said that every
doubt which a person may carry
about the vitality of a belief in
spiritual realities is capable of
being resolved by a test. Like true
scientists, Vern said we should be
willing to donate some time to
this "live and momentous
option." He quoted the Roman
Stoic Epictetus who said that all
one need do is to go to a quiet
place and honestly open one's
heart, then will one know if all
that God-talk is true. That is the
acid test, Vern said. It is
impossible to verify the existence
of such a Being by philosophic
inquiry, since God is Spirit.
'Not A Grandfather'
"God is not a cosmic
grandfather who sits on a
cumulonimbus cloud strumming
his great white beard while
recording all our Faults with a red
marker in the debit column, and
all our good deeds with black
marks in the credit column. He is
the First Source and Center of all
things and beings who loves each
and every one of his children with

an infinite love."
Though there was not one
heckler bothering Vern, which as
he said was his usual experience in
talking to the people at the
Berkeley campus, a number of
people attended the preacher's
hour long talk. These people were
not only greeted by Vern's "glad
tidings" but also by a number of
supporters from the Berkeley
area, where Vern heads a
non-denominational, non-profit
foundation.
Vern stated that he had a
number of radio broadcasts
around the world, including such
places as England, Ceylon and
Africa. He has been encouraged
by the good response which he
has received from these places.
From such response, and from his
dialogue with numerous students
concerning Jesus' life and
thoughts, Vern is convinced that
the planet is now "in the midst of
a Spiritual Renaissance which is

ultimately bound to make more
differences in this world than any
war which has ever been waged,
any battle which has ever been
fought, any political, social or
economic upheaval in all of
human history."
Enthusiasm Appreciated
This student very much
appreciated Vern's enthusiasm. In
this time of political, social and
economic riptides, it is refreshing
to hear such words. If Vern is
correct in saying that faith is not
just a justification for weakness,
but a substantiation of strength, it
would seem that in this time of
energy shortage, faith is indeed an
Option which should be honestly
considered by every individual.
More true than the often
quoted phrase "We are what we
eat," is the phrase, "We are what
we think." Our self image is that
which shapes our whole future; if
it is that of a "good doctor" or a
"good lawyer" that, then, will be

the limit of our potential, our
peak; that image serves as the
basis of our life.
If we would envision ourselves
as children of the Creator,
infinitely loved by that God, how
much broader would be our
horizons for achivement! This is
not to say that being a good
doctor excludes the possibility of
realizing that one has been
"created in the image of God." It
is to say that it makes a
tremendous difference which one
values more, being God's person
or being the best doctor on the
ward.
Try living first as God's person,
then as that doctor who is able to
serve others see if it doesn't

horizons for achivement! This is
not to say that being a good
doctor excludes the possibility of
realizing that one has been
"created in the image of God." It
is to say that it makes a
tremendous difference which one
values more, being God's person
or being the best doctor on the
ward.
Try living first as God's person,
then as that doctor who is able to
serve others see if it doesn't
lead to happier living. It is your
decision; no priest, evangelist,
book, creed or friend can make it
for you. "He who seeks will find."

Last week, amidst the
noontime hour traffic of White
Plaza, Berkeley radio broadcaster
Vern Grimsley spoke about
religious questions that university
students are most often puzzled
by.
His topics covered the gamut
of queries which he has
confronted in dealing with
students from the University of
California at Berkeley. He stated
that religion is an experience, not
of mind alone, but of the whole
person, a commitment to living by
faith in God and in the Family of
all Humanity, in synchrony with
our highest values.
"The essence of the teachings
of Jesus is the Way of Love and
Service. He came to teach that we
are children of God, and that by
faith we can appropriate this truth
in our personal experience. You as
an individual are known and loved
by God, with whom you may
have spiritual fellowship this
very instant. But finding God is a
decision, a deliberate exercise of
your own God-given free will."
Grimsley said that every
doubt which a person may carry
about the vitality of a belief in
spiritual realities is capable of
being resolved by a test. Like true
scientists, Vern said we should be
willing to donate some time to
this "live and momentous
option." He quoted the Roman
Stoic Epictetus who said that all
one need do is to go to a quiet
place and honestly open one's
heart, then will one know if all
that God-talk is true. That is the
acid test, Vern said. It is
impossible to verify the existence
of such a Being by philosophic
inquiry, since God is Spirit.
'Not A Grandfather'
"God is not a cosmic
grandfather who sits on a
cumulonimbus cloud strumming
his great white beard while
recording all our Faults with a red
marker in the debit column, and
all our good deeds with black
marks in the credit column. He is
the First Source and Center of all
things and beings who loves each
and every one of his children with

an infinite love."
Though there was not one
heckler bothering Vern, which as
he said was his usual experience in
talking to the people at the
Berkeley campus, a number of
people attended the preacher's
hour long talk. These people were
not only greeted by Vern's "glad
tidings" but also by a number of
supporters from the Berkeley
area, where Vern heads a
non-denominational, non-profit
foundation.
Vern stated that he had a
number of radio broadcasts
around the world, including such
places as England, Ceylon and
Africa. He has been encouraged
by the good response which he
has received from these places.
From such response, and from his
dialogue with numerous students
concerning Jesus' life and
thoughts, Vern is convinced that
the planet is now "in the midst of
a Spiritual Renaissance which is

ultimately bound to make more
differences in this world than any
war which has ever been waged,
any battle which has ever been
fought, any political, social or
economic upheaval in all of
human history."
Enthusiasm Appreciated
This student very much
appreciated Vern's enthusiasm. In
this time of political, social and
economic riptides, it is refreshing
to hear such words. If Vern is
correct in saying that faith is not
just a justification for weakness,
but a substantiation of strength, it
would seem that in this time of
energy shortage, faith is indeed an
Option which should be honestly
considered by every individual.
More true than the often
quoted phrase "We are what we
eat," is the phrase, "We are what
we think." Our self image is that
which shapes our whole future; if
it is that of a "good doctor" or a
"good lawyer" that, then, will be

the limit of our potential, our
peak; that image serves as the
basis of our life.
If we would envision ourselves
as children of the Creator,
infinitely loved by that God, how
much broader would be our
horizons for achivement! This is
not to say that being a good
doctor excludes the possibility of
realizing that one has been
"created in the image of God." It
is to say that it makes a
tremendous difference which one
values more, being God's person
or being the best doctor on the
ward.
Try living first as God's person,
then as that doctor who is able to
serve others see if it doesn't
lead to happier living. It is your
decision; no priest, evangelist,
book, creed or friend can make it
for you. "He who seeks will find."
