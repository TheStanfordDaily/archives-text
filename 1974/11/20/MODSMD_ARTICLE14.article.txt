# More Housing Confusion
## 
### Harmatz, Davis 
An example of the confusion
in the current housing issue came
in a question often posed,
addressing the role of women in
identifying the problems of the
status quo: "Who was it that
demonstrated the discrimination
of women in the present housing
system?"
The answer is not that a
women's organization pointed out
this problem, but that a coed
fraternity Alpha Sig raised
the issue in its proposal of last
February. This occurred when
Alpha Sig, a coed fraternity,
sought to regain its draw-exempt
privilege by arguing that women
were not allowed these privileges
in the present system, which was
a clear case of discrimination.
Why didn't women notice this
earlier?
The present system when

viewed at its surface presents two
options: the fraternity or the
draw. We now realize that the
fraternity system has privileges
that the draw doesn't.
Many women until recently
have viewed the fraternity not as a
privileged system, but more as a
system of organized single sex
living. In 1944, when women had
agreed with the Board of Trustees
decision to discontinue the
sorority system, they did not feel
they were losing privileges or
housing options.
Indicate Differences
We feel that it is important to
indicate the differences in the
housing issue between women
wanting privileges such as draw
exemptions, and women wanting
organized single sex living. The
answer is not to reinstate
sororities, nor is it necessary to

eliminate fraternity privileges.
We believe the best alternative
to the present system would be
one that allowed an expanded two
system housing configuration
which will provide maximum
choice as well as equality and
variety in housing.
We encourage women to
respond to our opinions so that
organizations working on
proposals will be aware of the
interests of women on the
campus. Please get in touch with
the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) at the ASSU
Office or the Center for Research
on Women (CROW).
