Summer Conference Programs
Editor:
Brad Cornell apparenlty isn't
aware of our extensive and
profitable summer conference
program. According to his column
(Daily, Oct. 25), most of
Stanford's expensive buildings are
locked tight during the summer *
and dazed graduate students are
the only people to be seen. He
stated that Stanford does have a
summer session (of sorts) that
ends in mid-August. Cornell
believes that no private business
not even the most successful f
could dream of using its capital
(buildings, land and research
facilities) so inefficiently.
Contrary to the ghost town
scenerio described by Cornell, last
summer our student residences
housed 1013 students and 4500 '
conference participants and
visitors, staying for periods of
several nights to 11 weeks.
Gross income for housing and
food services for the summer was
$678,000. Net income, after
direct expenses, was $185,000.
Without that income, room and
board rates this year would be
about $45 higher than they are.
The University derives other
benefits from hosting these
conferences. They are (
academically oriented and
contribute to continuing
education. Jobs are provided for
regular employees in student
residences who otherwise might
face a summer layoff, as well as
Plant Services personnel and
students on financial aid. '
Classrooms and auditoriums
are utilized, and other facilities,
such as the golf course, swimming
pools, bookstore, reprographics,
Tresidder Union and Faculty
Club, also benefit from the
additional customers. Conferees 1
also attend summer programs
scheduled by Public Events.
So you see, we're trying to use
our facilities and bring money to
our Stanford summers. Any ideas
for new conference business?

A Good Concert?
Editor:
It seems that Dan Forte in his
review of the George Harrison
concert defines a good concert as,
one in which the audience is
brought to its feet (e.g., "... but
it was Preston's soul-colored rock
which brought the packed house
to its feet"). Has Forte ever
boogied to a symphony? Or has
he ever tried to dance to "While
My Guitar Gently Weeps"?
I am in no way trying to
downgrade the performance of
Billy Preston, a super musician
and showman. Rather it seems
quite apparent that the beat of a
Preston song is much more
conducive to foot-stomping than
the fluid smooth sound of a
Harrison tune.
Forte is correct when he
discusses Harrison's hoarse voice,
but I feel he is neglecting an
important aspect of the show by
failing to mention Harrison's
enthusiasm. The ex-Beatle was
never happier than when
accompanying Preston or Shankar
and it showed.

Purpose Of Trial
Editor:
What is the purpose of a
criminal trial?
According to Stephen Carter
(Daily, Nov. 7), "to the
Constitution, to the law and to
reasonable men a trial exists for
the sole purpose of determining a
guilt or innocence of the
accused."
Carter then went on to
harangue Federal District Court
Judge John Sirica for telling the
jury in the current Watergate
cover-up trial that the purpose of
the trial is "to find the truth."
My question is this: how can
guilt or innocence be determine
except on the basis of the truth? I
suggest to Carter that finding the
truth is the only way to determine
the guilt or innocence of the
accused.

Preston song is much more
conducive to foot-stomping than
the fluid smooth sound of a
Harrison tune.
Forte is correct when he
discusses Harrison's hoarse voice,
but I feel he is neglecting an
important aspect of the show by
failing to mention Harrison's
enthusiasm. The ex-Beatle was
never happier than when
accompanying Preston or Shankar
and it showed.

Purpose Of Trial
Editor:
What is the purpose of a
criminal trial?
According to Stephen Carter
(Daily, Nov. 7), "to the
Constitution, to the law and to
reasonable men a trial exists for
the sole purpose of determining a
guilt or innocence of the
accused."
Carter then went on to
harangue Federal District Court
Judge John Sirica for telling the
jury in the current Watergate
cover-up trial that the purpose of
the trial is "to find the truth."
My question is this: how can
guilt or innocence be determine
except on the basis of the truth? I
suggest to Carter that finding the
truth is the only way to determine
the guilt or innocence of the
accused.

Summer Conference Programs
Editor:
Brad Cornell apparenlty isn't
aware of our extensive and
profitable summer conference
program. According to his column
(Daily, Oct. 25), most of
Stanford's expensive buildings are
locked tight during the summer *
and dazed graduate students are
the only people to be seen. He
stated that Stanford does have a
summer session (of sorts) that
ends in mid-August. Cornell
believes that no private business
not even the most successful f
could dream of using its capital
(buildings, land and research
facilities) so inefficiently.
Contrary to the ghost town
scenerio described by Cornell, last
summer our student residences
housed 1013 students and 4500 '
conference participants and
visitors, staying for periods of
several nights to 11 weeks.
Gross income for housing and
food services for the summer was
$678,000. Net income, after
direct expenses, was $185,000.
Without that income, room and
board rates this year would be
about $45 higher than they are.
The University derives other
benefits from hosting these
conferences. They are (
academically oriented and
contribute to continuing
education. Jobs are provided for
regular employees in student
residences who otherwise might
face a summer layoff, as well as
Plant Services personnel and
students on financial aid. '
Classrooms and auditoriums
are utilized, and other facilities,
such as the golf course, swimming
pools, bookstore, reprographics,
Tresidder Union and Faculty
Club, also benefit from the
additional customers. Conferees 1
also attend summer programs
scheduled by Public Events.
So you see, we're trying to use
our facilities and bring money to
our Stanford summers. Any ideas
for new conference business?

A Good Concert?
Editor:
It seems that Dan Forte in his
review of the George Harrison
concert defines a good concert as,
one in which the audience is
brought to its feet (e.g., "... but
it was Preston's soul-colored rock
which brought the packed house
to its feet"). Has Forte ever
boogied to a symphony? Or has
he ever tried to dance to "While
My Guitar Gently Weeps"?
I am in no way trying to
downgrade the performance of
Billy Preston, a super musician
and showman. Rather it seems
quite apparent that the beat of a
Preston song is much more
conducive to foot-stomping than
the fluid smooth sound of a
Harrison tune.
Forte is correct when he
discusses Harrison's hoarse voice,
but I feel he is neglecting an
important aspect of the show by
