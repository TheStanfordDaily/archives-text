## Meet A New Playmate-The People's Computer 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Five-year-old Jeff is concentrating very hard. It's Friday
afternoon and he's playing a game. But it's not the kind of
game that five-year-olds played a generation ago
marbles, hop scotch or cowboys and Indians. Jeff is
playing with a computer.
Children in Jeff's generation will be as familiar with
computers as previous ones were with television, radio and
telephones. One place where children like Jeff or adults
can play with and learn about computers is the People's
Computer Center, at 1919 Menalto Ave., in Menlo Park.
Computers at the Center are for people to play with,
and not regarded in awe or mystery. The idea that
computers are fun is obvious both in the Center's
literature, and the easy-going ways of both game players
and supervisors.
Joanne Verplank, who says she is one of the 2Vi
full-time employees of the Center, oversees some of its
daily operations and originated the
games-playing class for youngsters age 5-8.
More Than Games
Before she started the class "only computer games were
available," Verplank said. "Classes for the younger
children have other board games, with computers there if
they want to play. It's a lot to expect a small child to sit in
front of a terminal for an hour."
It's a lot to expect even of an adult, when some of the
games available have such exotic names as Bagels, Hunt the
Wumpus, Stars, Hurkle and Star Trek. The more complex
games teach the player how computers think logically, and
the relationships between groups of numbers, all while the
learner is playing a game.
"Many adults don't realize that it's possible to learn
and have fun at the same time," Verplank explained."When
parents come in they say 'That's all very nice, but when
are they going to learn something?' "
Learning By Playing
Jeff is one of the kids who is learning by playing.
Squirmy but articulate, he said he has been coming to the
Center for a month. He's playing Number, a simple game
which involves guessing a number from 1 to 10. Jeff is
j getting pretty proficient, too, guessing several in two
; turns.
"Write that down! " he yells excitedly, when the
computer terminal (a clattering teletype) tells him "You

got it in two turns!!!" The computer tells him if each
guess he makes is bigger or smaller than the correct
number, so Jeff has to know more than how to count to
10 to play the game; he has to know the relationship of 10
numbers to each other as well.
Older children at the Center play more complex games,
and classes in basic computer programming are held for all
ages. Craig, a bit small for an eight-year-old, is having
trouble reading the teletype printout because he forgot
his glasses. He is playing Hamarabi, a sort of open-ended
game that involves juggling a given amount of people,
crops,land and yield per acre to get a big enough harvest to
support all the residents of a town. In the role of
Hamarabi, the player makes the decision of how much
land to sell, how many acres to plant and how much grain
to distribute from the storehouse.
Starting with 100 people, Craig has reached a steady
state of 5-10 inhabitants, distributing just enough grain to
keep the remaining people from starving, and thereby
losing the contest.
Bushel Battle
"What's a bushel?" he asks. He is beginning to grasp the
relationship between the diverse factors of the game
without knowing the proper names for quantities the
numbers measure.
The People's Computer Center has done far better than
Craig's mythical town. The Center has grown from a few
people who liked tb play with computers into an
operation that combines features of a library, a day care
center and a classroom.
The Center now has three computers, seven terminals,
several hand calculators, a large number of puzzles and
board games, and a growing lending library of paperback
science fiction books and magazines.
In fact, the Center has grown so fast that it's now a part
of the People's Computer Company, a non-profit
organization that runs the Center, publishes a
cluttered-looking newspaper full of interesting computer
game developments, and has started a bookstore that sells
computer literature.
All this is contained in a pair of large rooms decorated
with colorful dragons painted on the walls. In the words of
Puff, the Magic Dragon, "making way for other toys,"
even those as complex as computers, hasn't removed the
magic spirit of playfulness from the People's Computer
Center.

Squirmy but articulate, he said he has been coming to the
Center for a month. He's playing Number, a simple game
which involves guessing a number from 1 to 10. Jeff is
j getting pretty proficient, too, guessing several in two
; turns.
"Write that down! " he yells excitedly, when the
computer terminal (a clattering teletype) tells him "You

got it in two turns!!!" The computer tells him if each
guess he makes is bigger or smaller than the correct
number, so Jeff has to know more than how to count to
10 to play the game; he has to know the relationship of 10
numbers to each other as well.
Older children at the Center play more complex games,
and classes in basic computer programming are held for all
ages. Craig, a bit small for an eight-year-old, is having
trouble reading the teletype printout because he forgot
his glasses. He is playing Hamarabi, a sort of open-ended
game that involves juggling a given amount of people,
crops,land and yield per acre to get a big enough harvest to
support all the residents of a town. In the role of
Hamarabi, the player makes the decision of how much
land to sell, how many acres to plant and how much grain
to distribute from the storehouse.
Starting with 100 people, Craig has reached a steady
state of 5-10 inhabitants, distributing just enough grain to
keep the remaining people from starving, and thereby
losing the contest.

"What's a bushel?" he asks. He is beginning to grasp the
relationship between the diverse factors of the game
without knowing the proper names for quantities the
numbers measure.
The People's Computer Center has done far better than
Craig's mythical town. The Center has grown from a few
people who liked tb play with computers into an
operation that combines features of a library, a day care
center and a classroom.
The Center now has three computers, seven terminals,
several hand calculators, a large number of puzzles and
board games, and a growing lending library of paperback
science fiction books and magazines.
In fact, the Center has grown so fast that it's now a part
of the People's Computer Company, a non-profit
organization that runs the Center, publishes a
cluttered-looking newspaper full of interesting computer
game developments, and has started a bookstore that sells
computer literature.
All this is contained in a pair of large rooms decorated
with colorful dragons painted on the walls. In the words of
Puff, the Magic Dragon, "making way for other toys,"
even those as complex as computers, hasn't removed the
magic spirit of playfulness from the People's Computer
Center.

FACE TO FACE—Although this youngster's mother might
not understand, his new "playmate" isn't just a new kid
on the block. With the help of games and classes offered at
the People's Computer Center, children are learning that
the computer can be their friend.

FUN, GAMES AND LEARNING—A young client of the People's
Computer Center in Menlo Park learns that computers can be fun. At
the same time, he may also be strengthening his understanding of
numerical relationships and mathematical concepts.
Five-year-old Jeff is concentrating very hard. It's Friday
afternoon and he's playing a game. But it's not the kind of
game that five-year-olds played a generation ago
marbles, hop scotch or cowboys and Indians. Jeff is
playing with a computer.
Children in Jeff's generation will be as familiar with
computers as previous ones were with television, radio and
telephones. One place where children like Jeff or adults
can play with and learn about computers is the People's
Computer Center, at 1919 Menalto Ave., in Menlo Park.
Computers at the Center are for people to play with,
and not regarded in awe or mystery. The idea that
computers are fun is obvious both in the Center's
literature, and the easy-going ways of both game players
and supervisors.
Joanne Verplank, who says she is one of the 2Vi
full-time employees of the Center, oversees some of its
daily operations and originated the
games-playing class for youngsters age 5-8.
More Than Games
Before she started the class "only computer games were
available," Verplank said. "Classes for the younger
children have other board games, with computers there if
they want to play. It's a lot to expect a small child to sit in
front of a terminal for an hour."
It's a lot to expect even of an adult, when some of the
games available have such exotic names as Bagels, Hunt the
Wumpus, Stars, Hurkle and Star Trek. The more complex
games teach the player how computers think logically, and
the relationships between groups of numbers, all while the
learner is playing a game.
"Many adults don't realize that it's possible to learn
and have fun at the same time," Verplank explained."When
parents come in they say 'That's all very nice, but when
are they going to learn something?' "

several hand calculators, a large number of puzzles and
board games, and a growing lending library of paperback
science fiction books and magazines.
In fact, the Center has grown so fast that it's now a part
of the People's Computer Company, a non-profit
organization that runs the Center, publishes a
cluttered-looking newspaper full of interesting computer
game developments, and has started a bookstore that sells
computer literature.
All this is contained in a pair of large rooms decorated
with colorful dragons painted on the walls. In the words of
Puff, the Magic Dragon, "making way for other toys,"
even those as complex as computers, hasn't removed the
magic spirit of playfulness from the People's Computer
Center.

FACE TO FACE—Although this youngster's mother might
not understand, his new "playmate" isn't just a new kid
on the block. With the help of games and classes offered at
the People's Computer Center, children are learning that
the computer can be their friend.

FUN, GAMES AND LEARNING—A young client of the People's
Computer Center in Menlo Park learns that computers can be fun. At
the same time, he may also be strengthening his understanding of
numerical relationships and mathematical concepts.
Five-year-old Jeff is concentrating very hard. It's Friday
afternoon and he's playing a game. But it's not the kind of
game that five-year-olds played a generation ago
marbles, hop scotch or cowboys and Indians. Jeff is
playing with a computer.
Children in Jeff's generation will be as familiar with
computers as previous ones were with television, radio and
telephones. One place where children like Jeff or adults
can play with and learn about computers is the People's
Computer Center, at 1919 Menalto Ave., in Menlo Park.
Computers at the Center are for people to play with,
and not regarded in awe or mystery. The idea that
computers are fun is obvious both in the Center's
literature, and the easy-going ways of both game players
and supervisors.
Joanne Verplank, who says she is one of the 2Vi
full-time employees of the Center, oversees some of its
daily operations and originated the
games-playing class for youngsters age 5-8.
More Than Games
Before she started the class "only computer games were
available," Verplank said. "Classes for the younger
children have other board games, with computers there if
they want to play. It's a lot to expect a small child to sit in
front of a terminal for an hour."
It's a lot to expect even of an adult, when some of the
games available have such exotic names as Bagels, Hunt the
Wumpus, Stars, Hurkle and Star Trek. The more complex
games teach the player how computers think logically, and
the relationships between groups of numbers, all while the
learner is playing a game.
"Many adults don't realize that it's possible to learn
and have fun at the same time," Verplank explained."When
parents come in they say 'That's all very nice, but when
are they going to learn something?' "
Learning By Playing
Jeff is one of the kids who is learning by playing.
Squirmy but articulate, he said he has been coming to the
Center for a month. He's playing Number, a simple game
which involves guessing a number from 1 to 10. Jeff is
j getting pretty proficient, too, guessing several in two
; turns.
"Write that down! " he yells excitedly, when the
computer terminal (a clattering teletype) tells him "You

got it in two turns!!!" The computer tells him if each
guess he makes is bigger or smaller than the correct
number, so Jeff has to know more than how to count to
10 to play the game; he has to know the relationship of 10
numbers to each other as well.
Older children at the Center play more complex games,
and classes in basic computer programming are held for all
ages. Craig, a bit small for an eight-year-old, is having
trouble reading the teletype printout because he forgot
his glasses. He is playing Hamarabi, a sort of open-ended
game that involves juggling a given amount of people,
crops,land and yield per acre to get a big enough harvest to
support all the residents of a town. In the role of
Hamarabi, the player makes the decision of how much
land to sell, how many acres to plant and how much grain
to distribute from the storehouse.
Starting with 100 people, Craig has reached a steady
state of 5-10 inhabitants, distributing just enough grain to
keep the remaining people from starving, and thereby
losing the contest.

"What's a bushel?" he asks. He is beginning to grasp the
relationship between the diverse factors of the game
without knowing the proper names for quantities the
numbers measure.
The People's Computer Center has done far better than
Craig's mythical town. The Center has grown from a few
people who liked tb play with computers into an
operation that combines features of a library, a day care
center and a classroom.
The Center now has three computers, seven terminals,
several hand calculators, a large number of puzzles and
board games, and a growing lending library of paperback
science fiction books and magazines.
