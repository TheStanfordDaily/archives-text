# Fee Assessment Voting Begins
## 
### KATHY BATTS JOHN FREED 
Students will go to the polls today
and tomorrow to vote on two
' refundable $1 fee assessments for
spring quarter in a special ASSU
election.
The assessments, if passed, will be
used to fund the proposed ASSU
record co-op and the new weekly
student newspaper, Live Oak.
The record co-op named "ASSU
Like It," will attempt to take over
record sales at the Bookstore if the
assessment passes. Proponents of the
co-op claim that they will be able to
offer records at an average discount of
11 cents under the Bookstore price,
and provide a much wider selection.
However, most records sold will list
for $6.98, and the co-op will sell them
for $4.34, a 16-cent discount from
current Bookstore prices. Backers say
that at least one in five of the records
V will be sold at a sale price of around
$3.77.
ASSU Vice President Ann Carter,
one of the authors of the proposal,
said the co-op will be just the first step
in an eventual expansion to a general,
student-merchandise store, offering
stereo equipment, backpacks, bicycles,
etc.

ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri has criticized the co-op
assessment, questioning if there is
sufficient demand to warrant $11,500
in student funding. He stressed that no
market survey had been taken before
the election to determine student
interest in the co-op.
Carter said the voter turnout for
the election will serve as an indicator
of student interest in the venture.
At a press conference last night,

Suzi Harmatz, who chairs the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS), revealed the group has
endorsed the record co-op.
"COSS does endorse this as a
potentially excellent service to
students," Harmatz said. Harmatz and
the two other speakers at the
conference ASSU Senate Chairman
Lee Rosenbaum and Senior Class
President Lise Pfeiffer all stressed
that a large voter turnout is "very

important."
The ASSU election regulations
require that there be at least a 20
percent voter turnout for the
assessments to pass.
Pfeiffer disputed Olivieri's
contention that the co-op will not
generate enough sales to make money.
The Live Oak assessment will give
the weekly news-feature publication
$11,500, if passed. Editor Bill
