# Fee Assessment Voting Begins
## 
### KATHY BATTS JOHN FREED 
Students will go to the polls today
and tomorrow to vote on two
' refundable $1 fee assessments for
spring quarter in a special ASSU
election.
The assessments, if passed, will be
used to fund the proposed ASSU
record co-op and the new weekly
student newspaper, Live Oak.
The record co-op named "ASSU
Like It," will attempt to take over
record sales at the Bookstore if the
assessment passes. Proponents of the
co-op claim that they will be able to
offer records at an average discount of
11 cents under the Bookstore price,
and provide a much wider selection.
However, most records sold will list
for $6.98, and the co-op will sell them
for $4.34, a 16-cent discount from
current Bookstore prices. Backers say
that at least one in five of the records
V will be sold at a sale price of around
$3.77.
ASSU Vice President Ann Carter,
one of the authors of the proposal,
said the co-op will be just the first step
in an eventual expansion to a general,
student-merchandise store, offering
stereo equipment, backpacks, bicycles,
etc.

ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri has criticized the co-op
assessment, questioning if there is
sufficient demand to warrant $11,500
in student funding. He stressed that no
market survey had been taken before
the election to determine student
interest in the co-op.
Carter said the voter turnout for
the election will serve as an indicator
of student interest in the venture.
At a press conference last night,

Suzi Harmatz, who chairs the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS), revealed the group has
endorsed the record co-op.
"COSS does endorse this as a
potentially excellent service to
students," Harmatz said. Harmatz and
the two other speakers at the
conference ASSU Senate Chairman
Lee Rosenbaum and Senior Class
President Lise Pfeiffer all stressed
that a large voter turnout is "very

important."
The ASSU election regulations
require that there be at least a 20
percent voter turnout for the
assessments to pass.
Pfeiffer disputed Olivieri's
contention that the co-op will not
generate enough sales to make money.
The Live Oak assessment will give
the weekly news-feature publication
$11,500, if passed. Editor Bill
Weinstein said the funds are necessary
to expand the newspaper and "make it
into a better paper."
Although Weinstein conceded that
Live Oak could operate indefinitely
with ad revenue, he said the funds are
necessary to pay for initial equipment
and start-up costs and to allow
expansion from the present 12-page
format to a 16- or 20-page paper.
Olivieri questioned Live Oak's need
for additional funds "Right now, he's
doing very, very well almost
breaking even," he said.
Olivieri added he still thought it
was much too early for Live Oak to be

going to the students for a fee
assessment, since it has only been in
publication two months.
Weinstein disagreed, saying "it was
not too early." He added that the
additional funding, to be spent over a
period of a year and a Jialf, would
solve the paper's cash flow problem
and establish Live Oak as a financial
entity on campus.
Polls will be open from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. today and tomorrow in front of
the Post Office, and outside the
engineering corner, and from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m. outside the history corner, in
the Business School lounge, at the
Medical School and at the physics
tank.

$11,500, if passed. Editor Bill
Weinstein said the funds are necessary
to expand the newspaper and "make it
into a better paper."
Although Weinstein conceded that
Live Oak could operate indefinitely
with ad revenue, he said the funds are
necessary to pay for initial equipment
and start-up costs and to allow
expansion from the present 12-page
format to a 16- or 20-page paper.
Olivieri questioned Live Oak's need
for additional funds "Right now, he's
doing very, very well almost
breaking even," he said.
Olivieri added he still thought it
was much too early for Live Oak to be

going to the students for a fee
assessment, since it has only been in
publication two months.
Weinstein disagreed, saying "it was
not too early." He added that the
additional funding, to be spent over a
period of a year and a Jialf, would
solve the paper's cash flow problem
and establish Live Oak as a financial
entity on campus.
Polls will be open from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. today and tomorrow in front of
the Post Office, and outside the
engineering corner, and from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m. outside the history corner, in
the Business School lounge, at the
Medical School and at the physics
tank.
Students will go to the polls today
and tomorrow to vote on two
' refundable $1 fee assessments for
spring quarter in a special ASSU
election.
The assessments, if passed, will be
used to fund the proposed ASSU
record co-op and the new weekly
student newspaper, Live Oak.
The record co-op named "ASSU
Like It," will attempt to take over
record sales at the Bookstore if the
assessment passes. Proponents of the
co-op claim that they will be able to
offer records at an average discount of
11 cents under the Bookstore price,
and provide a much wider selection.
However, most records sold will list
for $6.98, and the co-op will sell them
for $4.34, a 16-cent discount from
current Bookstore prices. Backers say
that at least one in five of the records
V will be sold at a sale price of around
$3.77.
ASSU Vice President Ann Carter,
one of the authors of the proposal,
said the co-op will be just the first step
in an eventual expansion to a general,
student-merchandise store, offering
stereo equipment, backpacks, bicycles,
etc.

ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri has criticized the co-op
assessment, questioning if there is
sufficient demand to warrant $11,500
in student funding. He stressed that no
market survey had been taken before
the election to determine student
interest in the co-op.
Carter said the voter turnout for
the election will serve as an indicator
of student interest in the venture.
At a press conference last night,

Suzi Harmatz, who chairs the
Committee on Services to Students
(COSS), revealed the group has
endorsed the record co-op.
"COSS does endorse this as a
potentially excellent service to
students," Harmatz said. Harmatz and
the two other speakers at the
conference ASSU Senate Chairman
Lee Rosenbaum and Senior Class
President Lise Pfeiffer all stressed
that a large voter turnout is "very

important."
The ASSU election regulations
require that there be at least a 20
percent voter turnout for the
assessments to pass.
Pfeiffer disputed Olivieri's
contention that the co-op will not
generate enough sales to make money.

the weekly news-feature publication
$11,500, if passed. Editor Bill
