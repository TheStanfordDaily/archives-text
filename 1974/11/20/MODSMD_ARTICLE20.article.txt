# Angry Writers Give Cards No Awards
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A group of very, very angry
Northern California sportswriters
blanked Stanford at yesterday's
awards luncheon in San Francisco.
Asked to predict who would
win the Big Game, the writers
picked Cal, 17 votes to zero for
Stanford. As expected, Cal's Steve
Bartkowski easily won Northern
California offensive player of the
year honors, but the real action
came in the voting for defensive

player of the year.
First, a press release was
distributed by Shrine Game
Director Bob Murphy,
naming Cardinal defenders Pat
Donovan, Roger Stillwell and
Gordy Riegel, along with
Bartkowski, to the East-West
Shrine game, which will be played
in Stanford Stadium Dec. 28.
Then, Stanford assistant coach
Dave Curry (subbing for Jack
Christiansen, who couldn't make

it due to the death of his
father-in-law) got up to announce
Stanford's nomination for
defensive player of the year.
"We're nominating our best
defensive player, Drew Palin,"
Curry said. "We've got some
All-Americans on our team, but
Palin has outplayed them." Curry
also nominated Scott Laidlaw for
offensive player honors.
In addition to receiving
nominations as Stanford's top

player from the coaches, Palin and
Laidlaw were elected captains for
the season by team members
Monday.
After a brief address by
Murphy, who didn't explain why
he picked three Stanford players
but not Palin, SJS coach Darryl
Rogers got up to speak.
Rogers gave Murphy a
withering look and said, "I've got
a defensive player on my team
who is the best in Northern
California, but he wasn't picked
for any post-season All-Star game.
Dave Wasick is the best defensive
player around, and Cal coaches
and Stanford coaches admit it."
The sportswriters agreed with
Rogers and 15 of them voted for
Wasick. Only three votes,
including those of the Daily and
Palo Alto Times, went to Palin.
After the meeting, one writer
complained, "I never would have
voted for a Stanford player.
They're only 4-4-1 and they put
all their own people in the Shrine
Game." Another said, "this shit
cheapens the game."
In other votes, the
sportswriters selected California as
both the most improved team and
best team in Northern California.
Cal's Mike White was named
coach-of-the-year. And the writers
predicted USC to beat UCLA
(again, the vote was a unanimous
17-0), and picked Ohio State over
Michigan by a 12-5 count.
