RAMBLE: To walk or wander
aimlessly.
—Webster's
If ever a team was given the
appropriate nickname, it had to
be the California JV football
team, which is called "the
ramblers." <
The Bears lived up to their
name, as Stanford's JV team made
the scoreboard look like a pinball
machine, winning by the biggest
score in its history, 82-26. The
win means that Stanford closes its
season with a perfect 4-0 record.
"What can I say? It was just an
outstanding game on the part of
all the guys," first-year Card
coach Doug Single said.
The Cardinal offense could do
no wrong. It rolled up an
Oklahoma-like 717 total yards
and held a 41-0 lead in the second
quarter. The score might have
been higher had not officials
decided to run the clock during
much of the second half to prevent
further slaughter.
Junior running back Greg
Smith became the JV-frosh team's
all-time leading ground gainer, as
he rolled up 117 yards (including
a touchdown) in only eight carries
to finish the season with 487
yards.
Other major contributers to
the Cards' total of 398 rushing
yards were John Finley, with 97
yards in nine carries, and Gary
Lynn, with 78 yards in but five
carries.
The Cardinal passing game was
as effective as the running attack,
as the team's three quarterbacks
hit 14 of 32 passes for 319 yards.
Bill Christopher threw touchdown
passes of 33 and four yards to
Orlando Mayes.
The first-string quarterback also
tossed two TD passes, including a
44-yard strike to wide receiver
James Lofton, who also ran a
reverse 67 yards for a touchdown.
Even third-string quarterback
Mike Galfkides hit the jackpot,
throwing to an unguarded

Dwayne Pursley, who romped for
a 69-yard TD.
The Stanford defense was
almost as impressive, as the freely
substituting Cards hit hard and
forced two fumbles. Linebacker
Mike Yancey and defensive back
Jay Gallinatti led the team with
five unassisted tackles each.
Specialty teams also did well.
Punter Brad Fox only got to punt
twice, but he averaged 41.5 yards.
One of his kicks officially
measured 46 yards, and also
carried 10 yards deep into the end
zone. The kickoff return team
also made a contribution, as Lynn
returned a kickoff for an
82-yard touchdown.
"I was pleased with the
running of Smith and Finley and
the receiving of Lofton and Mayes

on offense. Of course, our
quarterbacks really played
outstanding games," Single said.
The JV coach thinks that
several players from this year's
team look like possible varsity
material next season. The three
star running backs, Smith, Finley
and Lynn, quarterback Steve Dils and
6-5, 250-pound freshman tackle
Gordon King are among those
who could make it.
There was only one possible
problem with the game. As varsity
coach Jack Christiansen told
Single on the sideline, "I hope
you didn't get Cal too mad for
Saturday's game."

The Cardinal offense could do
no wrong. It rolled up an
Oklahoma-like 717 total yards
and held a 41-0 lead in the second
quarter. The score might have
been higher had not officials
decided to run the clock during
much of the second half to prevent
further slaughter.
Junior running back Greg
Smith became the JV-frosh team's
all-time leading ground gainer, as
he rolled up 117 yards (including
a touchdown) in only eight carries
to finish the season with 487
yards.
Other major contributers to
the Cards' total of 398 rushing
yards were John Finley, with 97
yards in nine carries, and Gary
Lynn, with 78 yards in but five
carries.
The Cardinal passing game was
as effective as the running attack,
as the team's three quarterbacks
hit 14 of 32 passes for 319 yards.
Bill Christopher threw touchdown
passes of 33 and four yards to
Orlando Mayes.
The first-string quarterback also
tossed two TD passes, including a
44-yard strike to wide receiver
James Lofton, who also ran a
reverse 67 yards for a touchdown.
Even third-string quarterback
Mike Galfkides hit the jackpot,
throwing to an unguarded

Dwayne Pursley, who romped for
a 69-yard TD.
The Stanford defense was
almost as impressive, as the freely
substituting Cards hit hard and
forced two fumbles. Linebacker
Mike Yancey and defensive back
Jay Gallinatti led the team with
five unassisted tackles each.
Specialty teams also did well.
Punter Brad Fox only got to punt
twice, but he averaged 41.5 yards.
One of his kicks officially
measured 46 yards, and also
carried 10 yards deep into the end
zone. The kickoff return team
also made a contribution, as Lynn
returned a kickoff for an
82-yard touchdown.
"I was pleased with the
running of Smith and Finley and
the receiving of Lofton and Mayes

on offense. Of course, our
quarterbacks really played
outstanding games," Single said.
The JV coach thinks that
several players from this year's
team look like possible varsity
material next season. The three
star running backs, Smith, Finley
and Lynn, quarterback Steve Dils and
6-5, 250-pound freshman tackle
Gordon King are among those
who could make it.
There was only one possible
problem with the game. As varsity
coach Jack Christiansen told
Single on the sideline, "I hope
you didn't get Cal too mad for
Saturday's game."
