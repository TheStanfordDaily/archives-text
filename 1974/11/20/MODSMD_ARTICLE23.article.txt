## Let's All Cry For Aaron 
### Glenn Garvin 
Poor Hank Aaron. He is leading a rough life.
You might not believe it's true, but Dick Young
wrote it in the New York Daily News. And Dick
Young's credentials as the world's number one
humanitarian and champion of the oppressed go
unchallenged, although cynics suggest this may be
due to the fact that anyone with any brains has
better things to do than argue with Dick Young.
Young's thesis, lest you missed this remarkable
piece of hard-hitting, tell-it-like-it-is reporting, is
that the Atlanta Braves are behaving shamefully by
refusing to pay Aaron $200,000 to sit behind a
desk in the front office, stringing paper clips and
remembering the good old days.
Aaron recently wound up his career as a
ballplayer—or so he said at the time—and wanted an
executive position with Atlanta. So the Braves
made him an offer: $50,000 a year to be assistant
to Bill Bartholomay, chairman of their board. Part of
the job involved helping two of Bartholomay's
subsidiary companies sell insurance and sporting
goods.
Now you can buy a lot of cheese and crackers
for $50,000 a year. But you can buy a hell of a lot
more for $173,000 a year, which is what Aaron
made playing ball. Then it turned out that a prior
commitment would prevent Aaron from being able
to help with the sporting goods business, so the
Braves cut their offer to $30,000. Aaron told them
to take a hike and wangled a trade to Milwaukee.
Great Deal
Fine. That's where he belongs. In Milwaukee
Aaron can hit baseballs, which is what he does best,
and because of the American's League's mindless
designated hitter rule he won't even have to play in
the field. Just get off the bench four times each
night and swing a bat. For $173,000.
Top that.
What Aaron and his old buddy Dick Young are

mad about is that Atlanta didn't think Hank's
executive prowess was worth $200,000 a year. And
of course they're right. Aaron is such a skillful,
tactful human being; a really fine manager of men.
Just this summer Hank proved what a good guy
he was. He shoved a sports writer's face in a carton
of strawberries after reading an article he didn't
like. No matter that the guy who got the
strawberries up his nose didn't write the piece that
Aaron found offensive. When you're as wonderful a
person as Hank Aaron, these things aren't
important.
Changed His Mind
The article that made Hank mad was pretty
interesting. It simply pointed out that for three
months Aaron said he didn't want to manage the
Braves. Then, the day after Atlanta fired manager
Eddie Mathews and hired former Giant manager
Clyde King to replace him, Hank changed his mind.
Obviously he's a man with great decision-making
skill.
Aaron and Young have missed one essential
point. Hank Aaron is the greatest home-run hitter
of all time—but that's all. He has never done one
other thing, and when he quit doing that, to
Atlanta he was a worthless property. The Braves
were willing to pay him a nice piece of change for
the use of his name, but Hank decided that was
beneath him.
"After all, Babe Ruth didn't drive a beer truck
for Colonel Ruppert's brewery in his spare time,"
Young observed perceptively in his Sunday column.
True, Dick. But the Yankees wouldn't give Ruth
an executive job, either, and when he insisted on
waiting around for one they traded him to Boston,
which is a burial ground if ever there was one.
Aaron should just count his money and thank
heaven he didn't wind up with the Giants.

executive prowess was worth $200,000 a year. And
of course they're right. Aaron is such a skillful,
tactful human being; a really fine manager of men.
Just this summer Hank proved what a good guy
he was. He shoved a sports writer's face in a carton
of strawberries after reading an article he didn't
like. No matter that the guy who got the
strawberries up his nose didn't write the piece that
Aaron found offensive. When you're as wonderful a
person as Hank Aaron, these things aren't
important.
Changed His Mind
The article that made Hank mad was pretty
interesting. It simply pointed out that for three
months Aaron said he didn't want to manage the
Braves. Then, the day after Atlanta fired manager
Eddie Mathews and hired former Giant manager
Clyde King to replace him, Hank changed his mind.
Obviously he's a man with great decision-making
skill.
Aaron and Young have missed one essential
point. Hank Aaron is the greatest home-run hitter
of all time—but that's all. He has never done one
other thing, and when he quit doing that, to
Atlanta he was a worthless property. The Braves
were willing to pay him a nice piece of change for
the use of his name, but Hank decided that was
beneath him.
"After all, Babe Ruth didn't drive a beer truck
for Colonel Ruppert's brewery in his spare time,"
Young observed perceptively in his Sunday column.
True, Dick. But the Yankees wouldn't give Ruth
an executive job, either, and when he insisted on
waiting around for one they traded him to Boston,
which is a burial ground if ever there was one.
Aaron should just count his money and thank
heaven he didn't wind up with the Giants.
Poor Hank Aaron. He is leading a rough life.
You might not believe it's true, but Dick Young
wrote it in the New York Daily News. And Dick
Young's credentials as the world's number one
humanitarian and champion of the oppressed go
unchallenged, although cynics suggest this may be
due to the fact that anyone with any brains has
better things to do than argue with Dick Young.
Young's thesis, lest you missed this remarkable
piece of hard-hitting, tell-it-like-it-is reporting, is
that the Atlanta Braves are behaving shamefully by
refusing to pay Aaron $200,000 to sit behind a
desk in the front office, stringing paper clips and
remembering the good old days.
Aaron recently wound up his career as a
ballplayer—or so he said at the time—and wanted an
executive position with Atlanta. So the Braves
made him an offer: $50,000 a year to be assistant
to Bill Bartholomay, chairman of their board. Part of
the job involved helping two of Bartholomay's
subsidiary companies sell insurance and sporting
goods.
Now you can buy a lot of cheese and crackers
for $50,000 a year. But you can buy a hell of a lot
more for $173,000 a year, which is what Aaron
made playing ball. Then it turned out that a prior
commitment would prevent Aaron from being able
to help with the sporting goods business, so the
Braves cut their offer to $30,000. Aaron told them
to take a hike and wangled a trade to Milwaukee.
Great Deal
Fine. That's where he belongs. In Milwaukee
Aaron can hit baseballs, which is what he does best,
and because of the American's League's mindless
designated hitter rule he won't even have to play in
the field. Just get off the bench four times each
night and swing a bat. For $173,000.
Top that.
