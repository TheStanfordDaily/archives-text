Coal Union Postpones Negotiations
WASHINGTON As the nation's biggest steel producers
braced for the ever-deepening rippling effect of the United
Mine Workers strike, union leaders postponed contract
negotiations until today.
UMW President Arnold Miller said the union's
38-member bargaining council arrived in Washington late
yesterday and "was just too worn out" to resume
deliberations.
The airplane carrying council members attending the
funeral in Bessemer, Ala., for UMW official Samuel E.
Littlefield, was delayed because of bad weather.
UMW Secretary-Treasurer Harry Patrick said there was a
50-50 chance the council would approve the tentative
agreement.
"The officers feel we have gotten the very best contract
we can," he said. "The membership had a right to expect a
large increase and I think it's in there."

ambassador at gunpoint for 11 hours was committed to a
mental hospital yesterday before he could see the son
whose freedom was won by the siege.

kidnaping a diplomatic official of a foreign country.
Meanwhile, Napoleon Lechoco Jr., 16, last of seven of
the family's children, was flying to this country from the
Philippines as part of the deal which ended the siege.
"I still don't know what it's all about," the teenager said
when his plane stopped in Honolulu. The son said he would
be very happy to see his family again.
Jerry R. Alexander, one of Lechoco's lawyers, said no
attempt would be made to overturn the commitment order
issued by U.S. District Judge George L. Hart Jr., but efforts
would be made for the son to see hi? father through normal
hospital visitation procedures.
The elder Lechoco walked into the embassy's chancery
about 3 p.m. Monday to keep an appointment with
Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualadez he had made by
telephone a week earlier.
Lechoco held Romualadez and economic attache Mario
Lagdameo at gunpoint in the ambassador's second floor
office until shortly after 2 a.m. yesterday when he threw
his pistol out the window and surrendered.

Governors Urge Economie Controls
HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. - The nation's
Democratic governors urged Congress yesterday to enact a
broad economic program including wage, price and profit
controls unless the rate of inflation subsides substantially
by mid-1975.
They watered down a resolution calling for "immediate
action" on controls because of opposition from most
members of a panel of experts.
Only 14 of the 32 Democratic governors and
governors-elect who gathered at Hilton Head for the
three-day Democratic Governors' Conference remained for
yesterday's final unanimous voice vote on the economic
resolution.
The group voted 8-6 against eliminating any reference to
controls and then agreed 7-6 to take out the plea for action
now.
Chairman Wendell Anderson of Minnesota said the
resolution had strong support from the governors who left
before the vote.
