# County Tries 'Dial-A-Bus'
## 
### LONNIE ROSENWALD 
The Santa Clara County Transit
District will launch its $3.9 million
"Dial-A-Bus" bus service Sunday.
For 25 cents (10 cents for senior
citizens and no charge for the blind)
the 1.2 million residents of Santa Clara
County will be able to obtain
taxi-like service in fixed areas between
any two points within the system's
240-square-mile area.
Requests for service will be
answered within an hour by one of 90
dispatched buses, which will arrive at
the stop nearest the caller's location.
Similar "Dial-A-Bus" systems on a
smaller scale are presently operating in
at least 40 other communities across
the country, including nearby
Richmond. Santa Clara County's
system will be the largest
demand-responsive public
transportation system in the country.
Under the zoning plan for the Santa
Clara system, most of the Stanford
campus is excluded from "Dial-A-Bus"
service. The only area of the campus
with access to the system is the faculty
residence area.
Transit Operations engineer Jim
Lightbody indicated that the Transit
District office might be willing to
expand present boundaries in response
to specific request proposals submitted
by the University.
In the meantime, the ASSU has
recently concluded a survey to gauge
the potential student market for
Dial-A-Bus service, and also for a
possible arterial route to circumvent
the campus.
The ASSU hopes to present the
results to the county as evidence that a
sizable market for service exists within
the Stanford community.
Preliminary results indicate a high
interest in utilizing bus service on
campus. For example, among those
students who do not have cars
available, 85 percent said they would
use a bus up to three times per week,
according to the survey.
