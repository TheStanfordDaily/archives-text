# Fears New Middle East War
## Israeli Radical Calls For Palestinian State 
### BILL EVERS 
/'lt seems likely the Middle East
will experience another war, a war that
may break out any day," Israeli New
Left journalist Peretz Kidron told
about 100 people crowded into the
Bechtel International Center lounge •
yesterday.
The only feasible political solution,
Kidron add his fellow members of the
small Israeli radical group SIAH
believe, is a "package deal" based on
U.N. Resolution 242, which suggests
an exchange of Israeli withdrawal from
territory occupied since 1967 for Arab
recognition of Israel and a peace
settlement.
Following the Israeli withdrawal,
the Palestinian Arabs should be free to
set up a Palestinian state in Gaza and
the West Bank or a federation with
Jordan or whatever governmental form
they choose, Kidron said. This overall
political settlement, he said, would
give to each of the parties to the
conflict a "tolerable minimum."
Such a compromise might make
"the absence of war more tolerable
than war" to the Middle East peoples,
Kidron said. At present the
populations on both are united in
support of war, he added. But if a
settlement were based on the SIAH
proposal, Kidron believes the
"political equilibrium within each
people" would alter.
Kidron said that with a new
situation and changed attitudes Israel
and a Palestinian state could coexist
peacefully side by side.
Kidron said wide-spread Middle
East pro-war sentiment is rooted in a
well-developed political consciousness
on both sides.
« The * Palestinian Arabs see
themselves as personally humiliated by
refugee camp living and the loss of
homes and lands in 1948, and
collectively humiliated by their lack of
sovereign nationhood in a time when
other Arab peoples have gained
independent sovereignty. They resent
the Israeli occupation of the territory
of Arab states since 1967, he said.
The Jewish Israelis see themselves
as having lived under the sovereignty
of other peoples, subject to continued
pogroms. They see the recent hostility
of their Arab neighbors as parallel to
past persecution of Jews, he said. The
key to understanding current Israeli
pplitical consciousness is "listening to
the speeches on Holocaust Memorial
Day," Kidron said.
Each of the parties to the conflict
in the Middle East has the capacity to
make life intolerable for the others
who live in the region. Because of this
volatile situation, Kidron argued that
"if you haven't solved all the
problems, you haven't solved any of
them."
This is the reason the SIAH peace
plan seeks a "tolerable minimum" for

all parties.
After Kidron's talk, two men from
the audience argued that his proposal
of two national states one Arab, the
other Jewish was in effect the*
Zionist program in a new package.
They argued for a single democratic
state containing both Arabs and Jews
Kidron replied that under present
circumstances the Israeli population
wanted a Jewish state. He said there
was too much recent Arab-Israeli
distrust to permit cooperation in one
government, though he hoped a
bi-national state or a Mid-Eastern
confederation would be possible after
some years of peaceful coexistence of
two national states.
Another member of the audience
asked whether a Palestinian State in
the West Bank would not threaten the
Israeli government's goal of secure
borders. Kidron responded by noting
that all that ever makes a border
secure is political support from those
living on both sides of it. He added
that in this era, borders that are
absolutely secure militarily are im
possible, even for countries much
more powerful than Israel.
SIAH is a radical socialist action
group which has been in existence five
years; it grew out of the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
