# Files Open: Students Get Limited Look
## 
### MARK FUNK 
As the controversial Buckley
amendment went into effect
yesterday, 12 Stanford students
requested and received permission to
look into their personal files minus
letters of recommendation, according
to assistant registrar W.J. Findeisen.
The new federal law, authored by
Sen. James Buckley (Cons.-NY), is
designed to allow students and
parents, particularly those in public
schools, access to files.
An opinion handed " down by
Stanford's legal staff, however, said
confidential letters of
recommendation did not fall under the
statute and the University would not
break the law if it continued to
withhold them.
Letters Confidential
James Siena, legal advisor to
President Richard Lyman, summed up
the administration's position, "We feel
strongly that the legislation does not
apply to confidential letters in student
files. We feel that confidential
information which students solicited
from individuals must be respected."
According to Findeisen, only two
students persisted in demanding to see
letters of recommendation. They were
referred to Siena's office. "The other
10 were docile and co-operative," he
said.
"Interestingly enough," Findeisen
added, "the majority of students
asking to see their files were
freshmen."
'Only Two'
At the Academic Information
Center, where undergraduates can
store recommendations from faculty
members for law or medical schools
before they graduate, AIC director
Robert Hamrdla said few students had
approached him about opening their
files. "Only two," he said.
Hamrdla said his office was engaged
in formulating "a cogent policy" to
deal with the issue. "Frankly," he said,
"we don't" know what we are going to.
do." Presently he is not allowing
students to see letters. He too has
referred students to Siena.
He pointed out that his department
would have at least 45 days to
formulate a policy before Congress
acts to change the Buckley
amendment. "We won't take that long
to put one together," Hamrdla
claimed.
No Challenges
"I want to examine not necessarily
the necessity, but the possibility, of
co-ordinating our policies with other
offices," Hamrdla concluded.
At Siena's office, no one has been
in to challenge the University's legal
opinion. "Somebody called and told
me that two people would be coming
over to talk with me," Siena said, "but
I guess they couldn't find the
president's office. Maybe it's just too
small.
"What we intend to do," Siena said,
in case students do challenge the
opinion, "is to treat them case by case
on individual merits. There is little
chance they will be allowed to see
their files under other circumstances."
He added that if the nature of the
material is such that it comes under
the jurisdiction of the Buckley
amendment, they could then see it.

James Siena, legal advisor to
President Richard Lyman, summed up
the administration's position, "We feel
strongly that the legislation does not
apply to confidential letters in student
files. We feel that confidential
information which students solicited
from individuals must be respected."
According to Findeisen, only two
students persisted in demanding to see
letters of recommendation. They were
referred to Siena's office. "The other
10 were docile and co-operative," he
said.
"Interestingly enough," Findeisen
added, "the majority of students
asking to see their files were
freshmen."
'Only Two'
At the Academic Information
Center, where undergraduates can
store recommendations from faculty
members for law or medical schools
before they graduate, AIC director
Robert Hamrdla said few students had
approached him about opening their
files. "Only two," he said.
Hamrdla said his office was engaged
in formulating "a cogent policy" to
deal with the issue. "Frankly," he said,
"we don't" know what we are going to.
do." Presently he is not allowing
students to see letters. He too has
referred students to Siena.
He pointed out that his department
would have at least 45 days to
formulate a policy before Congress
acts to change the Buckley
amendment. "We won't take that long
to put one together," Hamrdla
claimed.
No Challenges
"I want to examine not necessarily
the necessity, but the possibility, of
co-ordinating our policies with other
offices," Hamrdla concluded.
At Siena's office, no one has been
in to challenge the University's legal
opinion. "Somebody called and told
me that two people would be coming
over to talk with me," Siena said, "but
I guess they couldn't find the
president's office. Maybe it's just too
small.
"What we intend to do," Siena said,
in case students do challenge the
opinion, "is to treat them case by case
on individual merits. There is little
chance they will be allowed to see
their files under other circumstances."
He added that if the nature of the
material is such that it comes under
the jurisdiction of the Buckley
amendment, they could then see it.
As the controversial Buckley
amendment went into effect
yesterday, 12 Stanford students
requested and received permission to
look into their personal files minus
letters of recommendation, according
to assistant registrar W.J. Findeisen.
The new federal law, authored by
Sen. James Buckley (Cons.-NY), is
designed to allow students and
parents, particularly those in public
schools, access to files.
An opinion handed " down by
Stanford's legal staff, however, said
confidential letters of
recommendation did not fall under the
statute and the University would not
break the law if it continued to
withhold them.
