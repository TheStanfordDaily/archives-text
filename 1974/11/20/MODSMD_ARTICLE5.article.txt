# Files Open: Students Get Limited Look

As the controversial Buckley
amendment went into effect
yesterday, 12 Stanford students
requested and received permission to
look into their personal files minus
letters of recommendation, according
to assistant registrar W.J. Findeisen.
The new federal law, authored by
Sen. James Buckley (Cons.-NY), is
designed to allow students and
parents, particularly those in public
schools, access to files.

10 were docile and co-operative," he
said.

added, "the majority of students
asking to see their files were
freshmen."
'Only Two'

approached him about opening their
files. "Only two," he said.
Hamrdla said his office was engaged
