# Panofsky: Still Examining Particle
## 
### DON COX 
Wolfgang Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), said yesterday
that "there has been a population explosion of
theorists" trying to explain the new "psi" particle
SLAC physicists recently discovered by accident.
"It has made a real madhouse of the central
SLAC lab" as theorists struggle to explain the
strange properties of the new particle, Panofsky said
KZSU's Campus Conference.
The particle was discovered by a team of
physicists at SLAC and the Brookhaven National
Laboratory in New York about the same time and
displays properties uncharacteristic of other
sub-atomic particles. Its heavy mass and unusually
long lifetime cannot be explained by current
theories, he said.
"The experiments show there is another new set
of particles that nobody predicted would be there
that carry the property which keeps them from
disintegrating rapidly," Panofsky said.
Discovery Can't Hurt
Panofsky said the discovery "clearly can't hurt"
the center's search for funding to continue its work.
SLAC is only operating at 45 percent of the time
due to budget constraints, he said, though the
center for high energy physics research is still very
busy.
The SLAC team, headed by SLAC Prof. Burton
Richter, discovered the new particle during
experiments in which they observed the collisions of
electrons and positrons. Out of the small fireball
created by the collision of the two particles
matter and anti-matter emerged the new psi

particle.
Responding to other questions, Panofsky said
that he "didn't see any hope in bringing the present
nuclear arms race to an end in the immediate
future." Panofsky is a widely recognized authority
in the field of arms control.
"Neither side has shown restraint since the first
SALT talks, both sides have been trying to get
bargaining leverage on the other," he said.
On President Ford's planned visit to the Soviet
Union, Panofsky said that he didn't "have a lot of
hope" of any productive results in terms of arms
control to result.
But the threat of a nuclear confrontation is not
serious since "both countries have not fully realized
that their arsenals of weapons are so massive that
they can no longer be used." The only reasons
behind the retention of the weapons is "political
prestige and arm leverage" he said.
Expanding Arms Race
The arms race continues to expand since there
"is no rational strategy that has been developed for
which the weapons might be used, therefore the lid
has been removed."
Panofsky said that while "maybe things could be
done better than they are currently done on
engineering" designs for the construction of nuclear
power reactors, "nuclear plants are a must for the
energy needs of the country for some time to
come."
"The danger of accidents exists, but the risks are
well below those of an ordinary fuel plant if you
ike pollution into account," he said.

The SLAC team, headed by SLAC Prof. Burton
Richter, discovered the new particle during
experiments in which they observed the collisions of
electrons and positrons. Out of the small fireball
created by the collision of the two particles
matter and anti-matter emerged the new psi

particle.
Responding to other questions, Panofsky said
that he "didn't see any hope in bringing the present
nuclear arms race to an end in the immediate
future." Panofsky is a widely recognized authority
in the field of arms control.
"Neither side has shown restraint since the first
SALT talks, both sides have been trying to get
bargaining leverage on the other," he said.
On President Ford's planned visit to the Soviet
Union, Panofsky said that he didn't "have a lot of
hope" of any productive results in terms of arms
control to result.
But the threat of a nuclear confrontation is not
serious since "both countries have not fully realized
that their arsenals of weapons are so massive that
they can no longer be used." The only reasons
behind the retention of the weapons is "political
prestige and arm leverage" he said.
Expanding Arms Race
The arms race continues to expand since there
"is no rational strategy that has been developed for
which the weapons might be used, therefore the lid
has been removed."
Panofsky said that while "maybe things could be
done better than they are currently done on
engineering" designs for the construction of nuclear
power reactors, "nuclear plants are a must for the
energy needs of the country for some time to
come."
"The danger of accidents exists, but the risks are
well below those of an ordinary fuel plant if you
ike pollution into account," he said.

Wolfgang Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), said yesterday
that "there has been a population explosion of
theorists" trying to explain the new "psi" particle
SLAC physicists recently discovered by accident.
"It has made a real madhouse of the central
SLAC lab" as theorists struggle to explain the
strange properties of the new particle, Panofsky said
KZSU's Campus Conference.
The particle was discovered by a team of
physicists at SLAC and the Brookhaven National
Laboratory in New York about the same time and
displays properties uncharacteristic of other
sub-atomic particles. Its heavy mass and unusually
long lifetime cannot be explained by current
theories, he said.
"The experiments show there is another new set
of particles that nobody predicted would be there
that carry the property which keeps them from
disintegrating rapidly," Panofsky said.
Discovery Can't Hurt
Panofsky said the discovery "clearly can't hurt"
the center's search for funding to continue its work.
SLAC is only operating at 45 percent of the time
due to budget constraints, he said, though the
center for high energy physics research is still very
busy.
