As students begin voting today on two proposed fee assessments,
we feel a discussion of current voting procedures on assessments is
needed.
Under the present system, fee assessments must be voted on by at
least 20 percent of the student body and must receive majority
support in order to pass.
We believe the 20 percent provision should be revised. As it stands
now, an assessment could lose even though it receives far more
support among the student body than another assessment that wins.
For example, if 20 percent of the student body is 2000 votes, an
assessment which receives 1900 "yes" votes and 20 "no" votes would
be defeated, while an assessment which receives 1200 "yes" votes and
1100 "no" votes would pass simply because more than 2000
students voted.
Furthermore, voters who are opposed to an assessment are out in
the ludicrous position of having to decide whether it would be better
to vote "no" on the assessment or not to vote at all, in the hope that
the required 20 percent turnout would not be achieved.
We agree with the principle behind the minimum voting
requirement that students should not be taxed for a proposal only
supported by a few. But a far better way to accomplish this goal
would be to put a minimum requirement on the number of "yes"
votes needed.
We believe that the ASSU Constitution should be amended to
provide that assessments would pass if they receive a certain
proportion of "yes" votes (perhaps around 15 percent) and also
obtain a majority of those voting.
