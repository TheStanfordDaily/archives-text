# Student Mis-Directory
## 
### 
The Stanford Student Directory has finally come off the presses,
complete with the usual number of omissions and inaccuracies.
A survey conducted by a Daily staffer shows that only 17 of 30
names on an office phone list were listed correctly in the directory.
Although the survey was far from scientific, we find the 57 percent
figure appalling.
Of course much of the fault lies with the students themselves, who
are responsible for informing the Registrar of their phone numbers.
But the whole problem could be solved quite simply if the Registrar's
office abandoned the ridiculous procedure of asking students for
phone numbers on registration day, before most phones have been
installed.
Instead, students should be required to turn in their phone
numbers at the same time they turn in their study lists two weeks
after the start of the quarter. Then the University would have some
accurate information, and its 117-page publication might actually be
useful.
