# A 						Current Myth
## 
### Merritt Ruhlen 
One of the most prevalent
myths in the United States today
is that to be anti-Israel necessarily
entails being anti-Semitic.
Nothing could be further from
the truth, of course. One may
oppose Israel simply because it is
a country which was created 25
years ago by armed aggression
against the indigenous people of
the area, the Palestinian Arabs.
Like South Africa, Israel is a
creation of Europeans. However,
while the South Africans allowed
the natives to continue to inhabit
their own land (but not to
participate in the government),
the Israeli regime has not only
excluded the indigenous people
from the government, but has
banished them from their
homeland itself, Palestine.
There are today over two
million Palestinian Arabs living in
wretched conditions in refugee
camps. These people feel they
should be allowed to return to the
homeland from which they were
driven by Zionist terrorists a
quarter century ago. One opposes
Israel, then, for the same reason
one opposes imperialism
anywhere in the world.
Anti-Semites, In General
An anti-Semite, on the other
hand, dislikes Jews in general.
Like any kind of racism,
anti-Semitism is the irrational
hatred of a particular racial group,
and is thus quite different from
rational opposition to a certain

political entity.
As the recent U.N. reception of
Yassir Arafat demonstrated,
practically every country in the
world, except the United Staes,
thinks the Palestinians have just as
much right to a homeland as the
Jews.
Either we Americans must
consider ourselves to be the only
moral people in the world, and
hence further withdraw into
paranoia, or else we should begin
to listen to what the rest of the
globe is saying.
Contrary to Zionist
propaganda, what the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO)
demands is not the annihilation of
the people living in Israel, but of a
form of government in which the
native people of a land are barred
from entering that land. The PLO
is asking for the establishment of
a democratic state in which Arabs,
Jews and Christians are treated as
equals. What the present Israeli
regime insists on is a state which
excludes most Palestinian Arabs,
and treats the rest as second-class
citizens.
It is time to recognize that
simply turning our backs on the
Palestinian Arabs, as we have done
for a quarter century, will not
make them disappear. Until their
just demands are answered, there
is no possibility of peace in the
Middle East.

practically every country in the
world, except the United Staes,
thinks the Palestinians have just as
much right to a homeland as the
Jews.
Either we Americans must
consider ourselves to be the only
moral people in the world, and
hence further withdraw into
paranoia, or else we should begin
to listen to what the rest of the
globe is saying.
Contrary to Zionist
propaganda, what the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO)
demands is not the annihilation of
the people living in Israel, but of a
form of government in which the
native people of a land are barred
from entering that land. The PLO
is asking for the establishment of
a democratic state in which Arabs,
Jews and Christians are treated as
equals. What the present Israeli
regime insists on is a state which
excludes most Palestinian Arabs,
and treats the rest as second-class
citizens.
It is time to recognize that
simply turning our backs on the
Palestinian Arabs, as we have done
for a quarter century, will not
make them disappear. Until their
just demands are answered, there
is no possibility of peace in the
Middle East.

One of the most prevalent
myths in the United States today
is that to be anti-Israel necessarily
entails being anti-Semitic.
Nothing could be further from
the truth, of course. One may
oppose Israel simply because it is
a country which was created 25
years ago by armed aggression
against the indigenous people of
the area, the Palestinian Arabs.
Like South Africa, Israel is a
creation of Europeans. However,
while the South Africans allowed
the natives to continue to inhabit
their own land (but not to
participate in the government),
the Israeli regime has not only
excluded the indigenous people
from the government, but has
banished them from their
homeland itself, Palestine.
There are today over two
million Palestinian Arabs living in
wretched conditions in refugee
camps. These people feel they
should be allowed to return to the
homeland from which they were
driven by Zionist terrorists a
quarter century ago. One opposes
Israel, then, for the same reason
one opposes imperialism
anywhere in the world.
Anti-Semites, In General
An anti-Semite, on the other
hand, dislikes Jews in general.
Like any kind of racism,
anti-Semitism is the irrational
hatred of a particular racial group,
and is thus quite different from
rational opposition to a certain

political entity.
As the recent U.N. reception of
Yassir Arafat demonstrated,
practically every country in the
world, except the United Staes,
thinks the Palestinians have just as
much right to a homeland as the
Jews.
