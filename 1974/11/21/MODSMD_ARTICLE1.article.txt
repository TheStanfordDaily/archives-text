Approximately 1333 persons voted
in the first day of balloting on two $1
fee assessments for spring quarter,
according to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald said the voting turnout
had been "a little higher than
expected," and he declined to release
specific vote tallies.
Voting concludes today on the
assessments to fund the proposed
ASSU record co-op and the new
weekly student newspaper Live Oak.
At least 20 percent df the students
must vote for an assessment to be
approved, and the measure must
receive a favorable majority.
. Fitzgerald said he would check with
the Registrar today to determine the
number of registered students. As of
Oct. 15, 11,423 matriculated students
were registered, according to the
Stanford Student Directory 74-75.
"We've also started getting
telegrams from the overseas
* campuses," Fitzgerald said. He also
discounted the effect of a mail strike
in France on the balloting, saying that
no hitches had developed so far.
Fitzgerald and ASSU Vice President
Leonard Mackey have already tallied
the first day's ballots, according to
Fitzgerald, but results will remain
• secret until voting finishes.
Fitzgerald said he allowed Mackey
in on the counting as a representative
from the issues, "to make sure the
counting was done fairly."
The ASSU Financial Manager's
office, which is responsible for
overseeing the election, along with
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri and Fitzgerald, in his position
as Olivieri's assistant, have all formally
opposed both assessments.
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein was
also present for some of the counting,
but "he only stopped by for a short
time," according to Fitzgerald.
