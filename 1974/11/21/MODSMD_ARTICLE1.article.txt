### MARK SIMONIAN 
Approximately 1333 persons voted
in the first day of balloting on two $1
fee assessments for spring quarter,
according to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald said the voting turnout
had been "a little higher than
expected," and he declined to release
specific vote tallies.
Voting concludes today on the
assessments to fund the proposed
ASSU record co-op and the new
weekly student newspaper Live Oak.
At least 20 percent df the students
must vote for an assessment to be
approved, and the measure must
receive a favorable majority.
. Fitzgerald said he would check with
the Registrar today to determine the
number of registered students. As of
Oct. 15, 11,423 matriculated students
were registered, according to the
Stanford Student Directory 74-75.
"We've also started getting
telegrams from the overseas
* campuses," Fitzgerald said. He also
discounted the effect of a mail strike
in France on the balloting, saying that
no hitches had developed so far.
Fitzgerald and ASSU Vice President
Leonard Mackey have already tallied
the first day's ballots, according to
Fitzgerald, but results will remain
• secret until voting finishes.
Fitzgerald said he allowed Mackey
in on the counting as a representative
from the issues, "to make sure the
counting was done fairly."
The ASSU Financial Manager's
office, which is responsible for
overseeing the election, along with
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri and Fitzgerald, in his position
as Olivieri's assistant, have all formally
opposed both assessments.
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein was
also present for some of the counting,
but "he only stopped by for a short
time," according to Fitzgerald.
Normally, only the elections
commissioner and his staff view the
ballot counting. In recent history,
ballot results have not been tallied
until voting has been completed.
Fitzgerald denied any wrongdoing,
saying that the ASSU election rules do
not specifically prohibit either a
preliminary result count or outside
observation of that count.
Former ASSU Elections
Commissioner Mike Nilsson, contacted
late last night, said that when he was
elections commissioner, no pro-con
count was ever made midway through
an election. However, he supported
Fitzgerald, commenting that there was
no prohibition of such a count.
Polls will be open today from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. in front of the Post
Office and outside the engineering
corner of the Quad, and from 10 a.m.
to 2 p.m. at the Quad's history corner,
at the Business School lounge, at the
Medical School and at the physics
tank.

ASSU record co-op and the new
weekly student newspaper Live Oak.
At least 20 percent df the students
must vote for an assessment to be
approved, and the measure must
receive a favorable majority.
. Fitzgerald said he would check with
the Registrar today to determine the
number of registered students. As of
Oct. 15, 11,423 matriculated students
were registered, according to the
Stanford Student Directory 74-75.
"We've also started getting
telegrams from the overseas
* campuses," Fitzgerald said. He also
discounted the effect of a mail strike
in France on the balloting, saying that
no hitches had developed so far.
Fitzgerald and ASSU Vice President
Leonard Mackey have already tallied
the first day's ballots, according to
Fitzgerald, but results will remain
• secret until voting finishes.
Fitzgerald said he allowed Mackey
in on the counting as a representative
from the issues, "to make sure the
counting was done fairly."
The ASSU Financial Manager's
office, which is responsible for
overseeing the election, along with
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri and Fitzgerald, in his position
as Olivieri's assistant, have all formally
opposed both assessments.
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein was
also present for some of the counting,
but "he only stopped by for a short
time," according to Fitzgerald.
Normally, only the elections
commissioner and his staff view the
ballot counting. In recent history,
ballot results have not been tallied
until voting has been completed.
Fitzgerald denied any wrongdoing,
saying that the ASSU election rules do
not specifically prohibit either a
preliminary result count or outside
observation of that count.
Former ASSU Elections
Commissioner Mike Nilsson, contacted
late last night, said that when he was
elections commissioner, no pro-con
count was ever made midway through
an election. However, he supported
Fitzgerald, commenting that there was
no prohibition of such a count.

at the Business School lounge, at the

expected," and he declined to release
specific vote tallies.
