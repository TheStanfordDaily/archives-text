# PIC Helps Battle A 'Medieval Relic'
## 
### Michael Kieschnick 
The Prison Information Center exists in
order to bring about basic penal reform. To
accomplish this, we attempt to educate the
Stanford Palo Alto community about the
harsh realities of the present prison system
and to indicate positive directions and
alternative structures leading to change.
We also try to deal with the day to day
survival needs of individual prisoners. To this
end we run a legal aid project, Project
Inside/Outside (a correspondence program), '
and a dental care project.
Our work is only a small step in relation
to the inertia of the entrenched American
concept of prisons. We need people to
maintain the present services and to expand
into other areas. Prisoners' needs are
immediate and disparate.
We have a waiting list of over 200 men
who want correspondents. Some of these
prisoners have had no contact outside prison
walls for several years. We have established
over 400 correspondences over the last two
years, but the need is greater still.
Writing letters admittedly will not change
the prison system, but it will help to relieve
the incredible isolation felt by most
prisoners.
Help You, Too
But beyond helping prisoners, it should
help you, too. The public rarely has to deal

with the reality of the men and women it has
deemed unfit to live freely. On a total basis,
this reality can be overwhelming, but on a
one to one basis, you discover that prisoners
are very human, and as easily destroyed by
rejection arid isolation as all of us.
With this discovery, each person can grow
from the flow of common and unique
experiences. We see the ensuing
communication and understanding as a
prelude to meaningful changes in our prison
system.
Our legal aid project receives several
inquiries a day from prisoners with a wide
range of legal problems. Once in prison, there
is no pretense of due process. There is no
justice after you have been deemed a
criminal. Groups such as ours are often the
only source of legal aid available.
Need People
We need people to research and answer
these requests. We presently have about ten
undergraduates, led by a law student, who
meet in small groups several hours a month
to work 'out how best to answer the
prisoner's requests.
Anyone interested in the application and
positive uses of law in American society can
gain a rapid understanding and render a vital
service.
As a stable group active in California

prisons, we are sometimes requested to
testify before various legislative bodies. We
can also take the initiative in bringing issues
to the attention of our too comfortable
representatives. Beyond direct law reform,
opportunities for needed research exist in
such ignored areas as the status of women in
prison, medical care and its abuses in prison,
psychosurgery, work furlough programs and
indeterminate sentencing.
The California prison system is a medieval
relic relying on isolation, deprivation and
physical punishment. All of this is carried out
under the guise of rehabilitation. Only
outside the prison walls is there even this
pretense of rehabilitiation. If society
demands that its citizens should resolve their
personal problems without resorting to
violence or inflicting death, then society
should find means to resolve its criminal
problems without resorting to violence,
cruelty or death.
The Prison Information Center offers an
effective vehicle through which you can learn
about the prison system, help alleviate
present conditions, and work towards basic
reform. If you would like to help, see us at
the Old Firehouse, or call us at 497-2677.
