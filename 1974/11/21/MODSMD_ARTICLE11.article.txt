# Boycott Espirit De Corps Products
## 
### Susannah Brown 
Chinese working women in two
Chinatown companies struggling
for the right to organize against
bad working conditions and low
wages, have been on strike for
over three months.
These workers are employees
at the Jung Sai Co. (Great Chinese
American Sewing Co.) and at Lee
Mah Electronics. Jung Sai is a
subsidiary of Espirit de Corps,
which manufactures dresses under
such brand names as Plain Jane,
Rose Hip, etc., while Lee Mah is a
subsidiary of Farinon Electric.
Working conditions at these
two plants are best described as
inhuman and degrading. Workers
are forbidden to talk to each
other, use the restroom or even
get a drink of water during work.
In addition, they work long
hours: Jung Sai workers usually
work 10-14 hours a day, seven
days a week, while the Lee Mah
workers aren't even allowed sick
leave during their first year of
work.
Wages are, of course, always set
at the legal minimum, irrespective
of the amount of profit made.
Workers at Jung Sai earn $2 per
hour, although each worker turns
out two pieces of garment sold at
$l6 apiece, per hour. Little
wonder the employer was able to
expand the plant almost
seven-fold in merely two years!
The starting salary at Lee Mah is a
mere $2.05 per hour, and the
workers are coerced into
purchasing company stocks. For
over a year, each worker has been
giving several dollars per month to
the boss, but no stocks have been
received. Nor is there any
accounting of where the money
went. Jung Sai did promise
medical insurance coverage to the
workers, but one of them, having
worked for over one and a half
years, belatedly discovered that
she wasn't under any coverage at
all.
Tales Of Woe
And the tales of woe go on
forever. But the workers can no
longer take such oppression, and
have organized themselves to fight
back. The dastardly management
reacted in clear violation of the
rights of the workers to organize.

Several workers at Jung Sai
were fired for organizing the
workers, and when 135 of them
walked out in protest, the
management closed the shop.
Since then, the workers have been
picketing the main plant Plain
Jane. At Lee Mah, a unionization
effort was sabotaged by the
management: 18 workers involved
in the effort were unjustly fired,
and 26 others walked out in
protest. They are now picketing
the plant, demanding
reinstatement with full back pay
as well as an end to harassment
and unfair firings.
The management and the
police are out daily, harassing the
picket lines with threats and racial
slurs. On two occasions some 45
workers and supporters from the
picket line were arrested. Amid a
tide of furor from the
community, however, the police
were quick to drop all charges,
saying that they did not have
enough evidence for the unjust
arrests.
Common Problems
The problems encountered by
these workers are certainly not
unique. All over the country,
immigrants (especially women)
Chinese, chicano, Puerto Rican
and other minority people face
the same problems. American
society is simply not the
"melting-pot" it claims to be, and
most immigrants find themselves
isolated from the mainstream of
American life because of cultural
differences, language problems
and racism.
This is even more so for
women workers, facing extra
discrimination in a male-oriented
society. They are often unable to
find jobs outside their own
communities and employers have
capitalized on such misfortune.
Many large firms move their
plants from high-income areas to
these communities where labor is
available even at the lowest wages
and the worst working conditions.
And the employers use the threat
of deportation as well as the claim
that unions do not support
immigrant workers to keep the
workers unorganized and
submissive.

However, the immigrant
working people refuse to be
oppressed any longer. Everywhere
they are organizing themselves,
just as did the farmworkers and
the chicano garment workers at
the Farah plant in Texas. They
can be successful, but they need
widespread support. The victory
of the Farah workers and
the progress made by the United
Farm Workers have shown the

importance of broadly-based
support from communities, and
the effectiveness of economic
pressure on the managements. We
therefore urge you to help the
cause of these workers, by
boycotting all Espirit de Corps
products.

Chinese working women in two
Chinatown companies struggling
for the right to organize against
bad working conditions and low
wages, have been on strike for
over three months.
These workers are employees
at the Jung Sai Co. (Great Chinese
American Sewing Co.) and at Lee
Mah Electronics. Jung Sai is a
subsidiary of Espirit de Corps,
which manufactures dresses under
such brand names as Plain Jane,
Rose Hip, etc., while Lee Mah is a
subsidiary of Farinon Electric.
Working conditions at these
two plants are best described as
inhuman and degrading. Workers
are forbidden to talk to each
other, use the restroom or even
get a drink of water during work.
In addition, they work long
hours: Jung Sai workers usually
work 10-14 hours a day, seven
days a week, while the Lee Mah
workers aren't even allowed sick
leave during their first year of
work.
Wages are, of course, always set
at the legal minimum, irrespective
of the amount of profit made.
Workers at Jung Sai earn $2 per
hour, although each worker turns
out two pieces of garment sold at
$l6 apiece, per hour. Little
wonder the employer was able to
expand the plant almost
seven-fold in merely two years!
The starting salary at Lee Mah is a
mere $2.05 per hour, and the
workers are coerced into
purchasing company stocks. For
over a year, each worker has been
giving several dollars per month to
the boss, but no stocks have been
received. Nor is there any
accounting of where the money
went. Jung Sai did promise
medical insurance coverage to the
workers, but one of them, having
worked for over one and a half
years, belatedly discovered that
she wasn't under any coverage at
all.
Tales Of Woe
And the tales of woe go on
forever. But the workers can no
longer take such oppression, and
have organized themselves to fight
back. The dastardly management
reacted in clear violation of the
rights of the workers to organize.

Several workers at Jung Sai
were fired for organizing the
workers, and when 135 of them
walked out in protest, the
management closed the shop.
Since then, the workers have been
picketing the main plant Plain
Jane. At Lee Mah, a unionization
effort was sabotaged by the
management: 18 workers involved
in the effort were unjustly fired,
and 26 others walked out in
protest. They are now picketing
the plant, demanding
reinstatement with full back pay
as well as an end to harassment
and unfair firings.
The management and the
police are out daily, harassing the
picket lines with threats and racial
slurs. On two occasions some 45
workers and supporters from the
picket line were arrested. Amid a
tide of furor from the
community, however, the police
were quick to drop all charges,
saying that they did not have
enough evidence for the unjust
arrests.
Common Problems
The problems encountered by
these workers are certainly not
unique. All over the country,
immigrants (especially women)
Chinese, chicano, Puerto Rican
and other minority people face
the same problems. American
society is simply not the
"melting-pot" it claims to be, and
most immigrants find themselves
isolated from the mainstream of
American life because of cultural
differences, language problems
and racism.
This is even more so for
women workers, facing extra
discrimination in a male-oriented
society. They are often unable to
find jobs outside their own
communities and employers have
capitalized on such misfortune.
Many large firms move their
plants from high-income areas to
these communities where labor is
available even at the lowest wages
and the worst working conditions.
And the employers use the threat
of deportation as well as the claim
that unions do not support
immigrant workers to keep the
workers unorganized and
submissive.

However, the immigrant
working people refuse to be
oppressed any longer. Everywhere
they are organizing themselves,
just as did the farmworkers and
the chicano garment workers at
the Farah plant in Texas. They
can be successful, but they need
widespread support. The victory
of the Farah workers and
the progress made by the United
Farm Workers have shown the

importance of broadly-based
support from communities, and
the effectiveness of economic
pressure on the managements. We
therefore urge you to help the
cause of these workers, by
boycotting all Espirit de Corps
products.

Chinese working women in two
Chinatown companies struggling
for the right to organize against
bad working conditions and low
wages, have been on strike for
over three months.
These workers are employees
at the Jung Sai Co. (Great Chinese
American Sewing Co.) and at Lee
Mah Electronics. Jung Sai is a
subsidiary of Espirit de Corps,
which manufactures dresses under
such brand names as Plain Jane,
Rose Hip, etc., while Lee Mah is a
subsidiary of Farinon Electric.
Working conditions at these
two plants are best described as
inhuman and degrading. Workers
are forbidden to talk to each
other, use the restroom or even
get a drink of water during work.
In addition, they work long
hours: Jung Sai workers usually
work 10-14 hours a day, seven
days a week, while the Lee Mah
workers aren't even allowed sick
leave during their first year of
work.
Wages are, of course, always set
at the legal minimum, irrespective
of the amount of profit made.
Workers at Jung Sai earn $2 per
hour, although each worker turns
out two pieces of garment sold at
$l6 apiece, per hour. Little
wonder the employer was able to
expand the plant almost
seven-fold in merely two years!
The starting salary at Lee Mah is a
mere $2.05 per hour, and the
workers are coerced into
purchasing company stocks. For
over a year, each worker has been
giving several dollars per month to
the boss, but no stocks have been
received. Nor is there any
accounting of where the money
went. Jung Sai did promise
medical insurance coverage to the
workers, but one of them, having
worked for over one and a half
years, belatedly discovered that
she wasn't under any coverage at
all.
Tales Of Woe
And the tales of woe go on
forever. But the workers can no
longer take such oppression, and
have organized themselves to fight
back. The dastardly management
reacted in clear violation of the
rights of the workers to organize.

Several workers at Jung Sai
were fired for organizing the
workers, and when 135 of them
walked out in protest, the
management closed the shop.
Since then, the workers have been
picketing the main plant Plain
Jane. At Lee Mah, a unionization
effort was sabotaged by the
management: 18 workers involved
in the effort were unjustly fired,
and 26 others walked out in
protest. They are now picketing
the plant, demanding
reinstatement with full back pay
as well as an end to harassment
and unfair firings.
The management and the
police are out daily, harassing the
picket lines with threats and racial
slurs. On two occasions some 45
workers and supporters from the
picket line were arrested. Amid a
tide of furor from the
community, however, the police
were quick to drop all charges,
saying that they did not have
enough evidence for the unjust
arrests.
Common Problems
The problems encountered by
these workers are certainly not
unique. All over the country,
immigrants (especially women)
Chinese, chicano, Puerto Rican
and other minority people face
the same problems. American
society is simply not the
"melting-pot" it claims to be, and
most immigrants find themselves
isolated from the mainstream of
American life because of cultural
differences, language problems
and racism.
This is even more so for
women workers, facing extra
discrimination in a male-oriented
society. They are often unable to
find jobs outside their own
communities and employers have
capitalized on such misfortune.
Many large firms move their
plants from high-income areas to
these communities where labor is
available even at the lowest wages
and the worst working conditions.
And the employers use the threat
of deportation as well as the claim
that unions do not support
immigrant workers to keep the
workers unorganized and
submissive.

However, the immigrant
working people refuse to be
oppressed any longer. Everywhere
they are organizing themselves,
just as did the farmworkers and
the chicano garment workers at
the Farah plant in Texas. They
can be successful, but they need
widespread support. The victory
of the Farah workers and
the progress made by the United
Farm Workers have shown the

importance of broadly-based
support from communities, and
the effectiveness of economic
pressure on the managements. We
therefore urge you to help the
cause of these workers, by
boycotting all Espirit de Corps
products.
