# Save The Frats!

### Rappaport et al 
A recent Daily,article quotes
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton as saying that
"Kappa Sigma, the only all male
fraternity in the draw, is stronger
today than when it joined the
draw in order to avoid folding."
Residents of Kappa Sigma feel
that this is a very deceptive
statement and deserves some
clarification.
Larry Horton often speaks of
unmet demand ratios when
discussing the desirability of
specific residences. Kappa Sigma's
ratio was .00. This means that
Kappa Sigma, in the eyes of male
students at least, was less desirable
than Manzanita Park. In fact,
Kappa Sigma was the least
desirable place to live on campus
according to student demand. Is
this what is meant when it is said
that a fraternity can survive in the
draw system?
Kappa Sigma was forced into
the draw becasue of a weak
financial position some years ago.
It is financially stronger now; but
not because of the draw system,
but rather because of the efforts
of a few fraternity members,
coupled with the increased
demand for on-campus housing.
The fraternity's financial
difficulties arose at a time when
the demand for on campus
housing, especially fraternity
housing, was at a low. This,
combined with poor management,
led to the house's financial

problems.
Other fraternities were also in
poor financial condition at the
time Kappa Sigma entered the
draw. However, by remaining
outside the draw, the other
fraternities have grown stronger in
every sense of the word.
In the Kappa Sigma house a
small core of active members,
lured by the hope of leaving the
draw system, held a. very effective
rush program last spring.
Unfortunately, many of their
efforts were in vain.
The house was not allowed to
leave the draw, and many of the
people who were attracted to the
fraternity during rush were unable
to live here. Certainly Kappa
Sigma is not presently providing
the strong social and cohesive
environment found within the
other fraternities.
The members of Kappa Sigma
feel that their attempts at creating
such an environment have been
stifled by the draw system. It
should also be pointed out that
Kappa Sigma national members,
at the time the fraternity went
into the draw, were permitted to
remain "draw exempt." If it were
not for this small amount of
continuity, what is left of Kappa
Sigma today would certainly have
ceased to exist some time ago.
