I wish to take issue with H.R. I
Nickerson on the physician's role L
in social leadership. He suggests L
that the failure of Dr. Michael L
Deßakey, in his recent campus L
appearance, to address himself to f
such broad issues as the politics of
medicine reflects a general $
inadequacy of the medical ft
profession to meet the obligations L
of shaping public opinion and I
offering constructive solutions to h
a number of complex social L
problems.
For a decade or more, health '
professionals have been badgered •
by spokesmen for consumer
groups, ethnic minorities and
academic dissidents to take on the
social ills of mankind, in addition
to the usual patient load. This
may be expecting too much from
physicians individually, who at
best are often just able to keep up
with patient responsibilities, |
teaching committments, research
and continuing self-education. I
On the other hand, no amount
of collective social consciousness
on the part of physicians is likely
to change American smoking
habits, alcohol and drug abuse,
diet fads, air pollution, highway
accidents, venereal disease and
criminal assault all symptomatic
of a sick society.
It is naive to assume that
American physicians are likely to
have some unusual insights into
problems of international health
generally, and particularly medical
problems of developing countries.
First of all, very few American
physicians have had first-hand
experience of medical practice in
a developing country.
Immigrants Experienced
Secondly, those who have had
some experience are largely
immigrant physicians-in-training
who are reluctant to return to
their native countries and prefer
to settle in the United States.
Furthermore, it is not now, nor
has it ever been fashionable to
emphasize public health,
preventive medicine, tropical
medicine and nutrition (which is j
what international health is all '
about) in the curricula of U.S.
medical schools.
Funding for research in these
areas has been dismally
inadequate. The "Project Hope"
approach to aiding developing
countries has many shortcomings;
not the least of which is
prohibitive expense if applied on a
large scale. While it is true that
such conditions as tuberculosis,
malnutrition, and trachoma tend
to disappear spontaneously as the
economy improves in a developing
country, international
wealth-sharing schemes are likely
to be disastrous unless financial
aid is routed through
well-organized and responsible
health ministries, and unless
population pressures can be
controlled.
I am not at all convinced that
"students are in a unique position
to criticize objectively the forces
of their society, since they are not
yet permanently committed to
any role in that society," for the
reason that this view labels the
student as a dilletante. Lack of
committment or resolve is as
much an impediment to change as
the inertia of professionalism.
Reservations Sincere?
Nickerson's reservations about
trusting his body to < socially
indifferent physicians may be
sincere. Still, I doubt if his
selection of an auto mechanic to
repair his car would be in any way
influenced by the mechanic's
views on auto emission control or
the desirability of rapid transit. .
Quite the contrary: his anecdote
about obstetrical complications
clearly underlines his concern
about professional competence.
In summary: physicians are not
necessarily ignorant of or
indifferent to the ills of society.
Sensitive laymen and physicians
alike have identified these ills, and
even agree on the urgency for
treatment. It is in the area of
priorities and methodology where
we begin to bog down.
Nickerson's arguments are not
entirely without merit, and I
would be willing to meet him
halfway by suggesting that social
awareness must be nurtured in the
medical student, that departments
of community medicine and
international health should receive
more academic support and
federal funding and that student
selection should be based
somewhat more on motivation
and somewhat less on scholarship.
In any case, the remedies for a
sick, Western society and a
troubled world are more apt to be
found on the philosopher's
bookshelf rather than in the
doctor's bag.
