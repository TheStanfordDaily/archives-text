## No Board, No Money, No Dice Computer Monopoly-You Can't Lie, Cheat Or Steal 
### PATTY FELS 
It is 1 a.m. on a Monday morning and most
campus buildings have been empty since early
evening. But in the Durand Labs, three
students have been hunched over an IBM 360
computer terminal for two intense hours.
Computer freaks trying to calculate pi to
the billionth place? Frantic students
desperately finishing a problem set, due
before noon? Not quite. And yet their
conversation sounds strangely familiar:
"All right, all right. I'll sell you Baltic. But
I still can't understand why you want the
purples so much."
"Probably because he's counting on getting
Boardwalk and then he'll have the whole

corner."
"No one ever gets Boardwalk and Park
Place with this fuckin' computer."
Obviously, this is no ordinary program.
These three people are playing what is known
to the computer as "fctOOO.watorv.
monopoly on syslO." To the layman, it is
simply Computer Monopoly.
Why play Monopoly on a computer rather
than in the traditional method? For one thing,
it's faster. There is no game board to set up,
no money to distribute, no property deeds to
shuffle through. A simple carriage return
substitutes for a roll of the dice, and the
computer automatically moves the player and
tells him where he has landed:

LISA , you are on *** GO * * *
and have $l5OO
WHAT IS YOUR MOVE?
You roll: 5 4
You land on CONNECTICUT AVE
Computer Monopoly is also simpler. The
computer does everything. It keeps track of
property and money, and can list a player's
financial assets and property holdings on
request.
There are drawbacks, of course. Cheating is
almost non-existent since the computer
automatically subtracts rent from a player
who lands on someone else's property:

TOM , you are on COMMUNITY CHEST
and have $1350
GLtNH 0
Is the hlch bidder et $ 150

KEEPING SCORE—Computerized monopoly
eliminates some of the classic arguments of
the game by telling players what they own,
what they owe, and when they are broke. But
with this printout there are no dice, money,
tokens, playing boards or Community Chest
cards in the computer's version of the famous
game and no mess to clean up afterward.

WHAT IS YOUR MOVE?
You roll 1 1 *** DOUBLES ***
You land on NEW YORK AVE
It is owned by MIKE
You pay $l6
TOM HAS $1334
And, naturally, there are never any of
Monopoly's most-cherished arguments
whether a dice roll on the rug should count,
whether the Free Parking space carries a cash
reward, who gets the Scotty and who gets the
battleship, etc.
But there is something addictive about the
game. Something more than convenience.
Computer Monopoly has an effervescent
quality as players realize that they are playing
a game without a board, tokens, or paper
money.
The only evidence that the game ever
existed is the 19-foot printout that will be
torn off the computer at the end.
The game also becomes strangely
whimsical. The computer is a machine,
programmed to print out specific responses.
But this is hard to remember when one needs
to mortgage and gets this cherry greeting:
WELCOME TO THE FRIENDLY LOAN
COMPANY!
Equally irritating is the computer's
dispassionate statement when you misjudge
your net worth after landing on the income
tax square:
You land on INCOME TAX
You can pay S2OQ or
10% of your net worth
YOU MUST DECIDE BEFORE YOU ADD
UP THE VALUE OF YOUR PROPERTIES.
NET WORTH IS THE SUM OF WHAT YOU
PAID FOR EVERYTHING YOU OWN, PLUS
YOUR CASH. TO PAY $2OO REPLY YES.
Y€S.
YES/NO? Yes
Too bad. You were worth $1720.
Sometimes the computer even appears to
gloat a bit:
You roll: 5 2
You land on BOARDWALK
It is owned by TOM
WITH A HOTEL!

YOU PAY $2OOO
Finally, there is the Computer's relentless
refusal to recognize last-chance pleas from , 0
those who have mortgaged everything they
have:
r t
TYPE THE NAMES OF THE PROPERTIES
YOU WISH TO MORTGAGE.
PROPERTY? park place
Sorry, MIKE ,
vou don't own PARK PLACE
PROPERTY? give me a break
Name not recognized. Try again or type
"DONE" or "DISPLAY."
PROPERTY? please, i've got a wife and two
kids.
Name not recognized. Try again or type
"DONE" or "DISPLAY."
Perhaps the computer's most human trait is
what programmers call a "bug." For example,
occasionally someone will run out of money
and the computer won't catch it for a turn or
so. Then, all of a sudden, it will appear to
remember and swear at itself:
###
-%
TOM LISA MIKE
187 -339 527
LISA OWES THE BANK $339
Superstition has it that the computer .
inevitably takes revenge on the person who
caused the mistake. In this game, the
unfortunate Lisa landed on Park Place and .
mortgaged all her property to pay the rent.
On the next roll of the dice, she threw double
ones and landed on Boardwalk, wiping her out.
By 1:30, Tom has all the property on the
board. The computer types out:
CONGRATULATIONS, TOM
YOU ARE THE WINNER
Now the real disadvantages of Computer
Monopoly become apparent. There is no
board to overturn, no money to throw, no
mess to force the winner to clean up.
The disgruntled losers must settle for
loudly slamming the door as they leave the lab ■-
with an unsatisfied desire for revengeance
and the eerie feeling that the computer is
laughing at them.
