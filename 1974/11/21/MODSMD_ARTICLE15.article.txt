Why is it easier to flunk a course then to drop
it? -H.T.C.
"I don't think that's true," Registrar Sally
Mahoney remarked. She explained a NC
means a student receives no credit for the
course; it does not necessarily mean the
student flunked it. He could have just
dropped the course.
"The meaning of NC cannot be inferred,"
she added.
Mahoney explained that some students tell
their professors out of courtesy they are
dropping a course. The drop card only is one
way of letting the professors know.
Most students do not fill out drop cards,
however. Students, adding classes, account for
the majority of the 17,000 cards turned in
this last year, according to Mahoney.
Generally filling out a card is "merely a
record-keeping device" and not a formal
petition, Mahoney explained.
However, students who drop below 12
units must petition the University committee
on academic standing if they wish exemption
from the academic requirement of completing
36 units within three quarters. This regulation
does not apply to summer quarter.
Students who want more than 20 units
must also petition the committee.

Sunday Flicks ads now claim that alumni can
enter at the 50 cent price. A few weeks ago,
my old picture-I.D. card was refused. Will it
be honored in the future? —D.M.
Rocky Barber, head of the Sunday Flicks,
said he did not know why the card was
refused. He added, "it will be accepted from
now on."
Barber said he would tell his ticket
collectors to sell tickets at the 50 cent price to
anyone with a fall or former quarter student,
faculty or staff I.D. card.
Why can't the Sunday Flicks projectionist
focus the film properly? —D.C.
The projectionist might indulge in weekly
drinking sprees on Sundays, or maybe his
Sunday morning hangovers linger until
Sunday night or maybe the prescription for
his glasses is off.
"Your guess is as good as mine," Barber
remarked. "We do go up and yell at him,
though."
Barber mentioned a more rational
explanation might be 1) the projectionist is a
long way from the screen; 2) he has to look
through a small window; and 3) he has to
refocus after every reel.
