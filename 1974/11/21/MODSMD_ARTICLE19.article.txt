# Exercise May Help Avoid Heart Attack

Middle-aged men may reduce
their chances of developing heart
disease if they engage in vigorous
physical activity, like long
distance running, a group of
Stanford researchers reported.
Scientists discovered that male
. runners they studied, aged 35 to
59, had blood fat distribution
more like younger women than
like less active middle-aged men.
Young women comprise a group
that is rarely afflicted by heart
disease.
Adjunct medicine Prof. Peter
* D. Wood, Herbert Klein, Steven
Lewis and Dr. William Haskell
presented their findings at the
annual scientific session of the
American Heart Association
meeting in Dallas yesterday.
Solid Evidence
h Their work represents solid
evidence to support contentions
that strenuous physical activity by
older men is beneficial with
respect to avoiding heart disease.
They cautioned, however, that no
such vigorous exercise program
I shouldbe launched without sufficient
preconditioning and advice from a
physician.
The runners were a Northern
California group of 41 male
long-distance runners who
averaged at least 15 miles of
I running each week during the
preceding year. Many had begun
their habit within the last few
years and were not lifelong
athletes. They were all in
excellent physical condition as
measured by treadmill testing.
- Compared with this group was
a larger group of randomly
selected middle-aged men, more
representative of the entire male
population, according to Wood,
and generally rather sedentary.
Lower Cholesterol
Researchers found cholesterol
levels modestly lower in the
runners. Most significantly, they
found changes in the distribution
of cholesterol in the blood
lipoproteins which carry the fats
through the body circulation.
Cholesterol in low density
* lipoproteins, generally considered
an important risk factor for heart
disease, was only 125 in runners,
but 139 in the control group.
Plasma triglyceride levels were
very much lower in the runners
than in the control group (70
I versus 146), confirming previous
reports.
The continued presence of
excess fats in blood plasma is
thought to increase the chances

that these fats will accumulate in
the artery walls. If this occurs in a
coronary artery, reduced or
obstructed blood flow could
result in heart attack.
Fat Accumulation ,
The recent research indicates
that vigorous exercise may help to
slow down this process of fat
accumulation.
None of the runners smoked
cigarettes, and most were close to
ideal weight. However, Wood said,
the data suggest that it was the
exercising and not these other
factors that was primarily
responsible for the distribution of
fats in the runners.
The researchers concluded:
"Vigorous activity in older men is
associated with a pattern of blood
lipids considered by most
authorities to be conducive to
heart health, and that such
activity is to be commended, at
least from this point of view, in fit
individuals."
Wood himself is considered one
of the finest senior distance
runners in the country, and has
often stressed the positive effects
exercise can have in respect to
heart disease.
