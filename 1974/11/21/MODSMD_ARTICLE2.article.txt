# Federal Lawsuit Labels AT&T 'Illegal Monopoly'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
government filed suit yesterday to
force the American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. to end an allegedly
illegal monopoly over the nation's
telephone and telecommunications
industry.
The Justice Department lawsuit
seeks a court order requiring AT&T to
sell off its manufacturing subsidiary,
Western Electric Co. Inc., which is
itself one of the nation's largest
corporations.
The court also was asked to force
AT&T to separate all or part of its
Long Lines Department from some or
all of the Bell operating companies.
The suit was filed in court and
announced moments after the New
York Stock Exchange halted trading
for the day, but the Securities and
Exchange Commission, anticipating
the action, suspended trading in AT&T
stock for the day an hour before the 1
p.m. PST market closing time. Trading
will resume today.
AT&T stock closed unchanged at
$46.62 per share.
Western Electric Activities
Western Electric, with over 200,000

employees, supplies the Bell System
with virtually all of its telephones and
communications. Much of this
equipment was designed and
developed at Bell Laboratories, owned
jointly by AT&T and Western Electric.
Long Lines is the nationwide cable
chain that links the various telephone
companies around the country into a
world wide communications network.
AT&T with total assets exceeding
$67 billion, is the jbiggest company
ever attacked in a government
anti-trust suit. It is the world's largest
privately owned company.
Restore Competition
Justice Department officials said
the purpose of the civil suit, filed in
U.S. District Court here, is to restore
competition to the business of
providing telephone service and other
electronic communications and the
manufacturing and selling of
telecommunications equipment.
AT&T supplies more than 80
percent of the nation's telephones.
But the results, for the company
and customers alike, will be a long
time coming. Deputy Asst. Atty. Gen.
Keith I. Clearwaters estimated that it
will take at least three years before the
case goes to trial.
'Not In Violation'
AT&T's board chairman, John D.
Deßutts, issued a statement saying
"we are confident that we are not in
violation of the antitrust laws and are
astonished that the Justice
Department would take its present
action with apparent disregard to the
public."
Saying the department's action
could lead to fragmentation of
responsibility for the nation's
telephone network with telephone
service deteriorating and costing more,

Deßutts said:
"The telephone network, to work
efficiently, must be designed, built and
operated as a single entity. It is for this
reason and no other that the Bell
System is structured as it is."
As for the impact on consumers,
Clearwaters told reporters, "I don't
believe we can promise this is going to
lower rates." But if the department
succeeds, he said, the result "may be a
downward pressure on those rates" as
other companies enter the market and
gain competitive strength.
In urging AT&T divestiture of
Western Electric, the suit called for the
subsidiary to be split into two or more
competing firms.
