# Prof: Stock Market 'Outlived Usefulness'
## 
### 
The New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) has "outlived its
usefulness," visiting Law Prof.
David L. Ratner contended in a
guest column published Tuesday
by The Wall Street Journal.
Ratner, a Cornell law
professor, served as chief counsel
to the securities subcommittee of
the Senate Banking Committee in
its 1971-73 study of the securities
industry.
The shift of stock trading from
individual to institutions and the
improvement of communication
and computer technology have
changed the role of brokers and
"made the whole idea of a
physical exchange 'floor'
obsolete," he wrote.
"If the New York Stock
Exchange had responded to these
changes by modifying its rigid
compensation structure and entry
requirements and by automating
its procedures, it could probably
have preserved its predominant
role in the trading of listed
securities," he said.
"Instead, it has driven
institutional and other customers
to the regional exchanges and the
'third market' the
over-the-counter market for listed
securities maintained by firms
who do not belong to the NYSE
by giving them unsuitable
service at excessive cost."
The Securities and Exchange
commission has proposed that
fixed commission charges by
stock exchanges by eliminated by
May, 1975. Hearings opened
Tuesday in Washington to debate
the proposal.
Fixed charges are the principal
reason brokers now stay in the
exchange, Ratner said.

"Without governmental
intervention, the NYSE in its
present form will not long survive
the elimination of fixed rates," he
declared. "The plain fact of the
matter is the type of 'central
auction market' which it purports
to represent has virtually ceased
to exist."
When fixed commission rates
are ended, "the major retail
[brokerage] firms may decide
rather quickly that it is in their
best interest, as well as that of
their customers, to deal in 'listed'
stocks for their own account
outside the NYSE market.
"Once this process gets under
way, the NYSE could disappear in

a relatively short time ...
"The availability of an
unlimited number of competing
market makers in the
over-the-counter market offers the
prospect of a far more efficient
market, better designed to
eliminate unfair pricing practices
than the single franchised
'specialist' who is the only person
permitted to make a market on
the NYSE," Ratner said.
A 1972 Senate subcommittee
study found NYSE regulation of
the specialists almost completely
lacking effective supervision or
sanctions.
Ratner suggests that the
present system of computerized

information on stock transactions
developed by the National
Association of Securities Dealers
could be expanded to encompass
all trades by market-making
dealers. A "composite tape,"
started last month on an
experimental basis, now reports
transactions in selected NYSE
stocks in all markets, he notes.
"NYSE regulation of the
financial responsibility of it's
member firms was abysmal, even
in the pre-1971 era when it
assumed some responsibility for
reimbursing customers of its
members who failed or could not
honor their customers' claims."
