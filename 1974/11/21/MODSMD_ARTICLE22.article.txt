# University To Borrow For New Construction
## 
### 
Stanford will borrow $16.9
million through the California
Educational Facilities Authority
(CEFA) to help finance
construction of the new hospital
wing, student housing, food service
facility and general plant
improvements.
Planned for early January the
private borrowing will be the first
through CEFA and will save the
University an estimated $400,000
annually in interests costs, said
Director of Finance Rod Adams.
The borrowing will provide
approximately $6.3 million
toward the $12.6 million total
projected cost of the hospital
expansion, $4.2 million for
refinancing the completed
Escondido Village IV student
housing, $1 million for the central
food service building, and $4.2
million for general plant
improvements.
The borrowing also includes
about $1.2 million debt service
reserve.
The Board of Trustees
approved plans for the bond issue
at their November meeting
following the legislative
enactment of CEFA and a
California State Supreme Court

ruling in September permitting
the state authority to issue
tax-exempt bonds for private
institutions.
Previously, private college
construction bonds were not
tax-exempt.
The bonds may be sold to both
institutional buyers and the
public. The University already has
received inquiries from individuals
who have expressed interests in
buying the bonds, Adams said.
Any Stanford bonds issued
under CEFA will be full faith and
credit obligations of the
University.
About a dozen California
institutions already have indicated
they will seek to use this method
of helping finance construction,
which was strongly supported by
the Association of Independent
Colleges and Universities.
Legislation similar to
California's has long been on the
books of New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode
Island, and South Carolina, among
other states.
Bank of America is financial
