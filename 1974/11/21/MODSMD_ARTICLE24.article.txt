## History Of The Blues Joe Pass: Next Jazz Guitar Great 
### Dan Forte 
SAN FRANCISCO In the history of jazz guitar, there have been
three individuals usually regarded as being of the "genius" category.
First was a Belgian gypsy named Django Reinhardt, who although
he was badly bumed in a caravan fire as a teenager and had the use of
only two fingers on his fretting hand, was perhaps the greatest jazz
guitar soloist of all. He, in fact, made the guitar a solo instrument.
Django was followed shortly thereafter by a young black from
Oklahoma named Charlie Christian.
Along with his astounding, amplified solos as a member of Benny
Goodman's sextet, Christian was pioneering the precursors of what
was to become be-bop, in all-night Harlem jams with Dizzy, Monk,
Bird and others in the late 30s.
In his brief career, before dying of T.B. in his early 20s, Christian
was to influence every jazz guitarist that followed.
The third, usually acknowledged by jazz historians as being of like
calibre, was the late Wes Montgomery.
Like Reinhardt and Christian, he too was self-taught, playing
amazing octave runs, using only his thumb as a pick, allowing for a
very distinctive sound.
The next guitarist to be added to the roster will undoubtedly be
Joe Pass, who appeared at the Great American Music Hall Saturday.

Pass' most recent album is entitled Virtuoso (on the Pablo label),
and features him in unaccompanied solos of several standards. It has
been called the best guitar album to come out in decades.
In away, though, the title of virtuoso doesn't give Pass his just due.
The term implies great technical ability, but Pass' talents go much
farther than skill alone.
Clearly, Pass can do more on his instrument than anyone around
today; he knows his fretboard like Einstein knew his multiplication
tables (or did he?).
But, Pass has that one elusive attribute which 50 years of intensive
study cannot insure. He swings his ass off!
Pass split his sets at the Music Hall between solo numbers and
numbers with bass and drum backing, from Mario Saraci and Glen
Cronkhite.
Some of his better solo performances were Duke's "Concerto ror
Cootie," Billy Strayhorn's "Lush Life," and T. Monk's "Round
Midnight."
On many of the trio's selections Pass would take a long break
alone, with the band laying out completely. This would inevitably be
the highlight of the song, as on "I Can't Get Started."
Saraci and Cronkhite provided a fairly able backup, but, with no
rehearsal since Pass doesn't lead a regular band, the two lacked the
delicateness evident in Pass' style.
A fair percentage of the audience were guitar players, leaning
forward, eyes glued on Pass' hands, hoping to come away with maybe
just one of his licks.
Pass spoke facetiously of his technique and of the guitar seminar
he'd given earlier in the day at the GAMH. "I only have three licks. If
you stay for the next set, maybe I'll think up a fourth."
Ending the opening set with "Once I Had A Secret Love," taken at
a feverish pace, Pass referred to himself as "King of the Bth Notes."
Pass welcomed requests in the second set, and then recalled his
childhood days when his father would come home from work every
Friday night and drink wine with his friends while Joe played Italian
songs until 2 a.m. (Pass' name was shortened from Passalagua.)
Improvising on the crowd's requests, Pass would sometimes find
himself stuck in the middle of a tune with nowhere to go. This is
mainly because Pass never just plays a song; every rendition is a totally
original, fresh treatment.
When he did get stuck, he would simply say, "I better get out of
this tune," or "I hate playing guitar," or just "shit."
What makes Joe Pass more than just a good guitar player, voted
number one by nearly every recent critics' poll, is his ability to play a
song to its fullest.
Since Stevie Wonder wrote "You Are The Sunshine Of My Life,"
the song has been performed by everyone from Frank Sinatra to the
Stanford Band, in arrangements ranging from mediocre to deplorable.
In Pass' hands the beauty of the tune is restored, and also given a
totally different feel at the same time.

But, Pass has that one elusive attribute which 50 years of intensive
study cannot insure. He swings his ass off!
Pass split his sets at the Music Hall between solo numbers and
numbers with bass and drum backing, from Mario Saraci and Glen
Cronkhite.
Some of his better solo performances were Duke's "Concerto ror
Cootie," Billy Strayhorn's "Lush Life," and T. Monk's "Round
Midnight."
On many of the trio's selections Pass would take a long break
alone, with the band laying out completely. This would inevitably be
the highlight of the song, as on "I Can't Get Started."
Saraci and Cronkhite provided a fairly able backup, but, with no
rehearsal since Pass doesn't lead a regular band, the two lacked the
delicateness evident in Pass' style.
A fair percentage of the audience were guitar players, leaning
forward, eyes glued on Pass' hands, hoping to come away with maybe
just one of his licks.
Pass spoke facetiously of his technique and of the guitar seminar
he'd given earlier in the day at the GAMH. "I only have three licks. If
you stay for the next set, maybe I'll think up a fourth."
Ending the opening set with "Once I Had A Secret Love," taken at
a feverish pace, Pass referred to himself as "King of the Bth Notes."
Pass welcomed requests in the second set, and then recalled his
childhood days when his father would come home from work every
Friday night and drink wine with his friends while Joe played Italian
songs until 2 a.m. (Pass' name was shortened from Passalagua.)
Improvising on the crowd's requests, Pass would sometimes find
himself stuck in the middle of a tune with nowhere to go. This is
mainly because Pass never just plays a song; every rendition is a totally
original, fresh treatment.
When he did get stuck, he would simply say, "I better get out of
this tune," or "I hate playing guitar," or just "shit."
What makes Joe Pass more than just a good guitar player, voted
number one by nearly every recent critics' poll, is his ability to play a
song to its fullest.
Since Stevie Wonder wrote "You Are The Sunshine Of My Life,"
the song has been performed by everyone from Frank Sinatra to the
Stanford Band, in arrangements ranging from mediocre to deplorable.
In Pass' hands the beauty of the tune is restored, and also given a
totally different feel at the same time.

SAN FRANCISCO In the history of jazz guitar, there have been
three individuals usually regarded as being of the "genius" category.
First was a Belgian gypsy named Django Reinhardt, who although
he was badly bumed in a caravan fire as a teenager and had the use of
only two fingers on his fretting hand, was perhaps the greatest jazz
guitar soloist of all. He, in fact, made the guitar a solo instrument.
Django was followed shortly thereafter by a young black from
Oklahoma named Charlie Christian.
Along with his astounding, amplified solos as a member of Benny
Goodman's sextet, Christian was pioneering the precursors of what
was to become be-bop, in all-night Harlem jams with Dizzy, Monk,
Bird and others in the late 30s.
In his brief career, before dying of T.B. in his early 20s, Christian
was to influence every jazz guitarist that followed.
The third, usually acknowledged by jazz historians as being of like
calibre, was the late Wes Montgomery.
Like Reinhardt and Christian, he too was self-taught, playing
amazing octave runs, using only his thumb as a pick, allowing for a
very distinctive sound.
The next guitarist to be added to the roster will undoubtedly be
Joe Pass, who appeared at the Great American Music Hall Saturday.

Pass' most recent album is entitled Virtuoso (on the Pablo label),
and features him in unaccompanied solos of several standards. It has
been called the best guitar album to come out in decades.
In away, though, the title of virtuoso doesn't give Pass his just due.
The term implies great technical ability, but Pass' talents go much
farther than skill alone.
Clearly, Pass can do more on his instrument than anyone around
today; he knows his fretboard like Einstein knew his multiplication
tables (or did he?).
But, Pass has that one elusive attribute which 50 years of intensive
study cannot insure. He swings his ass off!

mainly because Pass never just plays a song; every rendition is a totally
original, fresh treatment.
When he did get stuck, he would simply say, "I better get out of
this tune," or "I hate playing guitar," or just "shit."
What makes Joe Pass more than just a good guitar player, voted
number one by nearly every recent critics' poll, is his ability to play a
song to its fullest.
Since Stevie Wonder wrote "You Are The Sunshine Of My Life,"
the song has been performed by everyone from Frank Sinatra to the
Stanford Band, in arrangements ranging from mediocre to deplorable.
In Pass' hands the beauty of the tune is restored, and also given a
totally different feel at the same time.
