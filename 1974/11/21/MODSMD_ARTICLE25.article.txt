# Art Show Surprises
## 
### BARBARA HEINS 
For everyone who envisions 17 th century Italian
art as consisting only of fleshy cupids floating in
swirling masses of air, frenzied saints and heavy
ornamentation, the exhibition now on view at the
Stanford Art Gallery will come as a surprise.
The 120 drawings comprise a portion of the
Janos Scholz collection, considered the most
important private collection of master drawings in
the United States. All of the great familiar Baroque
artists are represented: included are Bernini,
Carracci, Domenichino, da Cortona, as well as
many lesser known ones.
The exhibition is very special because in both
subject matter and medium the works are not
usually seen in art books or slide lectures on
Baroque art.
Prof. Alfred Moir of Santa Barbara
deliberately selected works which "favored
drawings of men over angels, of commoners over
nobles, of the ordinary over the extraordinary, and
of things material over things spiritual."
Intimate Look
' In doing this he provides viewers with an
intimate perspective on the personal sketches,
studies and caricatures of artists usually known for
huge commissioned ceilings and elaborate sculpted
creations.
Too often all that is seen by the public is
completed art works; yet the artist's preparatory
drawings frequently reveal an individuality and a
spontaneous response to the subject that is lost in
the finished work.
The artistic process so evident in these sketches
makes the finished work seem less intimidating and
affords a greater understanding of the stages the
artist goes through to create the work. Viewing
these studies and personal drawings makes the
viewer almost a participant in the working-out
process of the artists.
Variety Incredible
The most striking aspect of the exhibition now
at Stanford is the individuality and incredible
variety of drawing styles. Each artist has his own
unique "handwriting" which undergoes changes as
he matures but remains his own.
Castiglione's work Orpheus and the Animals is a
page of whimsical sketches of feet, elephants,
monster heads and profile caricatures in the midst
of which Orpheus sits playing his lyre. This is
different in every way from the quiet, precise,
thoughtful drapery study of Domenichino, in
which light and shadow modelled in red chalk is the

subject matter.
The largest work in the exhibition is a drawing
study, Half-length Female by Peiro da Cortona. It is
considered a cartoon, a full-sized sketch ready for
transfer to the plaster wall, for a fresco. It was
possibly intended for the great ceiling of the Plazzo
Barberini in Rome.
Fast-Moving Hand
The work is open and sketchy, as if the artist's
hand had moved swiftly across the paper, finding
contours, reinforcing areas of line, indicating
modelling. It is interesting to compare this work
with an earlier one by da Cortona, Queen of Sheba
Before Solomon, also in the exhibition.
This tightly constructed composition is quite
different in style and conception from the earlier
cartoon showing the changes in a single artist's
work over time.
The medium often reflects the emotive intent of
the subject matter. Salvator Rosa's Joel Killing
Sisera is a dark ink wash whose high contrasts of
dark and light areas create an almost abstract
background for the sharply delineated figure of
Joel, weapon in hand.
Sentimental Baby
The sentimental sleeping baby in a sketch by
Santi di Tito, on the other hand, is made with thin
whispy lines that seem to melt into the wide empty
area around them, giving an impression of the
softness of the small child.
Along one wall is a group of works totally unlike
the landscapes and figure studies of the rest of the
exhibition. This group is made up of caricatures
made by several of the artists. These humorous,
satirical drawings are extremely witty and add yet
another dimension to the exhibition. Several of the
cleverest works are by Pier Francesco Mola whose
tiny drawing Man Playing a Guitar elicits a smile
from everyone who passes it.
The exhibition of Janos Scholz's collection
demonstrates something very central about the
nature and understanding of art: art in our society
is an individual creation. A work may be placed
within certain stylistic categories that it resembles,
but it still remains the creation of the artist, both in
his personal "handwriting" and choice of depiction
and arrangement of subject matter.
To understand 17 th century art you must not
only see the central trends but those that are
different. Ony way to do this is to view exhibitions
like the one at the gallery, which will continue
through December.

study, Half-length Female by Peiro da Cortona. It is
considered a cartoon, a full-sized sketch ready for
transfer to the plaster wall, for a fresco. It was
possibly intended for the great ceiling of the Plazzo
Barberini in Rome.
Fast-Moving Hand
The work is open and sketchy, as if the artist's
hand had moved swiftly across the paper, finding
contours, reinforcing areas of line, indicating
modelling. It is interesting to compare this work
with an earlier one by da Cortona, Queen of Sheba
Before Solomon, also in the exhibition.
This tightly constructed composition is quite
different in style and conception from the earlier
cartoon showing the changes in a single artist's
work over time.
The medium often reflects the emotive intent of
the subject matter. Salvator Rosa's Joel Killing
Sisera is a dark ink wash whose high contrasts of
dark and light areas create an almost abstract
background for the sharply delineated figure of
Joel, weapon in hand.
Sentimental Baby
The sentimental sleeping baby in a sketch by
Santi di Tito, on the other hand, is made with thin
whispy lines that seem to melt into the wide empty
area around them, giving an impression of the
softness of the small child.
Along one wall is a group of works totally unlike
the landscapes and figure studies of the rest of the
exhibition. This group is made up of caricatures
made by several of the artists. These humorous,
satirical drawings are extremely witty and add yet
another dimension to the exhibition. Several of the
cleverest works are by Pier Francesco Mola whose
tiny drawing Man Playing a Guitar elicits a smile
from everyone who passes it.
The exhibition of Janos Scholz's collection
demonstrates something very central about the
nature and understanding of art: art in our society
is an individual creation. A work may be placed
within certain stylistic categories that it resembles,
but it still remains the creation of the artist, both in
his personal "handwriting" and choice of depiction
and arrangement of subject matter.
To understand 17 th century art you must not
only see the central trends but those that are
different. Ony way to do this is to view exhibitions
like the one at the gallery, which will continue
through December.
For everyone who envisions 17 th century Italian
art as consisting only of fleshy cupids floating in
swirling masses of air, frenzied saints and heavy
ornamentation, the exhibition now on view at the
Stanford Art Gallery will come as a surprise.
The 120 drawings comprise a portion of the
Janos Scholz collection, considered the most
important private collection of master drawings in
the United States. All of the great familiar Baroque
artists are represented: included are Bernini,
Carracci, Domenichino, da Cortona, as well as
many lesser known ones.
The exhibition is very special because in both
subject matter and medium the works are not
usually seen in art books or slide lectures on
Baroque art.
Prof. Alfred Moir of Santa Barbara
deliberately selected works which "favored
drawings of men over angels, of commoners over
nobles, of the ordinary over the extraordinary, and
of things material over things spiritual."
Intimate Look
' In doing this he provides viewers with an
intimate perspective on the personal sketches,
studies and caricatures of artists usually known for
huge commissioned ceilings and elaborate sculpted
creations.
Too often all that is seen by the public is
completed art works; yet the artist's preparatory
drawings frequently reveal an individuality and a
spontaneous response to the subject that is lost in
the finished work.
The artistic process so evident in these sketches
makes the finished work seem less intimidating and
affords a greater understanding of the stages the
artist goes through to create the work. Viewing
these studies and personal drawings makes the
viewer almost a participant in the working-out
process of the artists.
Variety Incredible
The most striking aspect of the exhibition now
at Stanford is the individuality and incredible
variety of drawing styles. Each artist has his own
unique "handwriting" which undergoes changes as
he matures but remains his own.
Castiglione's work Orpheus and the Animals is a
page of whimsical sketches of feet, elephants,
monster heads and profile caricatures in the midst
of which Orpheus sits playing his lyre. This is
different in every way from the quiet, precise,
thoughtful drapery study of Domenichino, in
which light and shadow modelled in red chalk is the

subject matter.
