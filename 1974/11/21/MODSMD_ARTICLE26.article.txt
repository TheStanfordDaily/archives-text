# Deep Purple, ELO And Elf Add Up To Boredom *

### DOUG ARCHERD 
SAN FRANCISCO - A friend
of mine refers to hard, heavy rock
and roll as "shit-kicking music."
Last Wednesday at the Cow Palace
saw a whole evening dedicated to
"shit-kicking music," as Deep
Purple, backed by the Electric
Light Orchestra and Elf, came to
San Francisco. Unfortunately, I
discovered that after one or two
songs, I had had the shit kicked
out of me.
The evening began on a rowdy
note, with some people in the
young crowd throwing sparklers
and pinwheels through the air. Bill
Graham came out at one point
and pleaded with the crowd to
think about what they were

doing, explaining that one girl had
been hurt already.
Then the lead-off act, a new
group called Elf, came out. This
group would be excellent playing
at a frat party with everyone a
little bit drunk and just wanting
to boogie. They come off as
disappointingly unimaginative on
the big stage, though. While they
were tight and played competent
rock and roll, they did everything
according to very well-worn
formulas, using standard openings
and breaks in the songs that are
usually guaranteed to make the
audience want to "boogie."
B.F. Skinner would have been
proud. The audience responded
according to the rules. To their

credit, however, almost no one
wanted an encore, leaving behind
a group which will hopefully die a
merciful death in the very near
future.
Next to assault our senses, if
one doesn't count the scene in the
halls as thousands of
teenyboppers descend upon the
bathrooms and coke stands, was
The Electric Light Orchestra. This
group comes on stage with two
celloes and a violin, together with
the standard rock instruments.
I was hopeful that this would
be another group trying to
explore the union with rock and
classical. No such luck. They seem
to be a group of frustrated young
men who were forced to take
lessons when they were young,
and are now taking their
vengeance on their hated
instructors. Far from playing
advanced music with precision,
they are merely fiddling around.
They could be forgiven perhaps

if they played well. They do not,
having very little sense of rhythm
and no sense of pitch. As one final
slap in the face to classical, the
keyboard man started playing a
synthesized "Moonlight Sonata"
which somehow turned into "Roll
Over, Beethoven." He is, he is.
Then, after an overlong set
change, Deep Purple came out
with artificial fog swirling around
their feet. They were fairly tight,
played hard rocking music that
never let up, put the expected
amoung of energy into the
performance, and I was bored out
of my mind. They have talented
musicians, notably their guitarist

and their keyboard man, and
looking at any one piece of their
material, they play good rock and
roll.
4
The problem is that after
third or fourth song in E which
features screaming vocalists and
fast, gimmicky fuzz guitar, the
formula begins to wear a little
thin. They have the imagination,
at least in organist Jon Lord, to \
really put some changeup
numbers into their repertoire.
As they stand now, they will
fail to gain the serious attention
of anyone above the naughty little
teeny bopper level.

they are merely fiddling around.
They could be forgiven perhaps

if they played well. They do not,
having very little sense of rhythm
and no sense of pitch. As one final
slap in the face to classical, the
keyboard man started playing a
synthesized "Moonlight Sonata"
which somehow turned into "Roll
Over, Beethoven." He is, he is.
Then, after an overlong set
change, Deep Purple came out
with artificial fog swirling around
their feet. They were fairly tight,
played hard rocking music that
never let up, put the expected
amoung of energy into the
performance, and I was bored out
of my mind. They have talented
musicians, notably their guitarist

and their keyboard man, and
looking at any one piece of their
material, they play good rock and
roll.

The problem is that after
third or fourth song in E which
features screaming vocalists and
fast, gimmicky fuzz guitar, the
formula begins to wear a little
thin. They have the imagination,
at least in organist Jon Lord, to \
really put some changeup
numbers into their repertoire.
As they stand now, they will
fail to gain the serious attention
of anyone above the naughty little
teeny bopper level.
SAN FRANCISCO - A friend
of mine refers to hard, heavy rock
and roll as "shit-kicking music."
Last Wednesday at the Cow Palace
saw a whole evening dedicated to
"shit-kicking music," as Deep
Purple, backed by the Electric
Light Orchestra and Elf, came to
San Francisco. Unfortunately, I
discovered that after one or two
songs, I had had the shit kicked
out of me.
The evening began on a rowdy
note, with some people in the
young crowd throwing sparklers
and pinwheels through the air. Bill
Graham came out at one point
and pleaded with the crowd to
think about what they were

doing, explaining that one girl had
been hurt already.
Then the lead-off act, a new
group called Elf, came out. This
group would be excellent playing
at a frat party with everyone a
little bit drunk and just wanting
to boogie. They come off as
disappointingly unimaginative on
the big stage, though. While they
were tight and played competent
rock and roll, they did everything
according to very well-worn
formulas, using standard openings
and breaks in the songs that are
usually guaranteed to make the
audience want to "boogie."
B.F. Skinner would have been
proud. The audience responded
according to the rules. To their

credit, however, almost no one
wanted an encore, leaving behind
a group which will hopefully die a
merciful death in the very near
future.
Next to assault our senses, if
one doesn't count the scene in the
halls as thousands of
teenyboppers descend upon the
bathrooms and coke stands, was
The Electric Light Orchestra. This
group comes on stage with two
celloes and a violin, together with
the standard rock instruments.
I was hopeful that this would
be another group trying to
explore the union with rock and
classical. No such luck. They seem
to be a group of frustrated young
men who were forced to take
lessons when they were young,
and are now taking their
vengeance on their hated
instructors. Far from playing
advanced music with precision,
they are merely fiddling around.
