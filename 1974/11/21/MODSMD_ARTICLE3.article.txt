# Bonfire Builders Mix Alcohol, Dedication, Humor
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A woman drunkenly lurched up to
one of the several small fires burning
in Lagunita's lake bed last night and
spilled some beer into the flames.
"Hey, what the fuck are you
doing?" inquired a male friend.
"That's good beer."
"I just wanted to see what would
happen," she replied apologetically. "I
wanted to see if it would smell or
anything."
That's guarding the Big Game
Bonfire: a bizarre combination of
alcohol, dedication and humor. This
strange mixture reappeared at
Stanford last night for the first time in
three years as 40 or 50 hardy souls
forsook studying to protect the huge
structure from Cal marauders.
Pacific Telephone installed 15 poles
in the lake bed yesterday afternoon to
form the frame of the Bonfire, and
about 6 p.m. the guards appeared,
vowing to stave off Berkeley
pranksters who traditionally try to
touch the flames off before Friday's
rally.
Dope, Nails, Palettes
They occupied their time smoking
dope, nailing up the 1500 wooden
shipping palettes donated by Heublein

Corporation, or drinking from the
seemingly bottomless kegs of beer
provided for guards.
Inter-Fraternity Council President
Mike Nilsson, whose group is
sponsoring the Bonfire, said there was
wide student enthusiasm for guarding
a job traditionally reserved for
freshmen.
"You wouldn't believe the signup
lists in some of the dorms," he said,
sipping from a paper cup of beer.
"There were 57 signups in Donner." In
addition, residents of Zeta Psi and
Kappa Alpha were keeping a constant
watch from their houses, he said.
Possible Sabotage
Tom Pedreira, coordinating the
Bonfire for the IFC, said someone
tried to block its construction by
hiding the telephone poles.
"I believe they had a four-wheel
drive vehicle," Pedreira said. "We came
in this afternoon and someone had
hauled two of the poles away."
Bonfire workers found • the poles
hidden in some brush a few hundred
yards away.
Pedreira refused to guess at who
might have taken the poles "I'm not
going to say anything because
whatever I say will be wrong" but

other workers hinted that anti-Bonfire
ecology groups were responsible.
Other Incidents Unlikely
Pedreira said it was unlikely any
other incidents would take place, since
the Bonfire will be under 24-hour
guard until it's torched at 7 p.m.
tomorrow. Several IFC members said
they intended to sleep in trucks
parked near the Bonfire so they could
keep watch on it.
Most of the talk about pranks last
night was more whimsical. "Tomorrow
night they're coming from Cal in jeeps
and they're going to drive in and
throw molotov cocktails," one man
said with a straight face. "I think we
ought to bring cars in here and circle
the thing so no one can get near it."
But an hour later the beer had
begun to take hold, and defense
proposals escalated. "Let's mount a
machine gun on top of it and then just
shoot the shit out of them if they
come in here," a guard said.
Fond Reminiscences
Most of the guards were fraternity
upperclassmen, and they fondly
reminisced about their experiences
guarding the 1971 Bonfire.
"Forrie Martin [football
linebacker] was captain of our team of

guards," one man explained. "He kept
yelling stuff like 'See those guys up
there? They're going to jump us! Get
over there!' Sure, Forrie. T here's a lot
of Cal guys in those bushes."
Another man gazed into one of the
small fires. "Let's burn Larry Horton,"
he finally announced. This prospect
fascinated another guard, who turned
to a friend and explained "Being
burned to death isn't really very
painful at all. You die in inhaling all
the gases long before you actually
burn."
Urinates Playfully
One man, heading back to the beer
keg, stumbled in a trench and fell to
the ground. A companion playfully
urinated near him.
Another truckload of palettes
arrived, and Nilsson tried to coax some
of the beer-drinkers into helping
unload it. "What do you mean? I'm
guarding ," one scowled, gesturing
wildly with his paper cup.
Another man gleefully scaled one
of the telephone poles, startling a
guard who happened to look up.
"Who's that batshit up there?" he
grumbled, and then walked away to
get another beer.

stumble around the bottom of Lake Lagunita. When they had time, they helped
guard the Big Game Bonfire, which will go up in smoke tomorrow at 7 p.m.

throw molotov cocktails," one man
said with a straight face. "I think we
ought to bring cars in here and circle
the thing so no one can get near it."
But an hour later the beer had
begun to take hold, and defense
proposals escalated. "Let's mount a
machine gun on top of it and then just
shoot the shit out of them if they
come in here," a guard said.
Fond Reminiscences
Most of the guards were fraternity
upperclassmen, and they fondly
reminisced about their experiences
guarding the 1971 Bonfire.
"Forrie Martin [football
linebacker] was captain of our team of

guards," one man explained. "He kept
yelling stuff like 'See those guys up
there? They're going to jump us! Get
over there!' Sure, Forrie. T here's a lot
of Cal guys in those bushes."
Another man gazed into one of the
small fires. "Let's burn Larry Horton,"
he finally announced. This prospect
fascinated another guard, who turned
to a friend and explained "Being
burned to death isn't really very
painful at all. You die in inhaling all
the gases long before you actually
burn."
Urinates Playfully
One man, heading back to the beer
keg, stumbled in a trench and fell to
the ground. A companion playfully
urinated near him.
Another truckload of palettes
arrived, and Nilsson tried to coax some
of the beer-drinkers into helping
unload it. "What do you mean? I'm
guarding ," one scowled, gesturing
wildly with his paper cup.
Another man gleefully scaled one
of the telephone poles, startling a
guard who happened to look up.
"Who's that batshit up there?" he
grumbled, and then walked away to
get another beer.

LAKE BED FUN—About 50 students turned out last night to drink beer, and
stumble around the bottom of Lake Lagunita. When they had time, they helped
guard the Big Game Bonfire, which will go up in smoke tomorrow at 7 p.m.
A woman drunkenly lurched up to
one of the several small fires burning
in Lagunita's lake bed last night and
spilled some beer into the flames.
"Hey, what the fuck are you
doing?" inquired a male friend.
"That's good beer."
"I just wanted to see what would
happen," she replied apologetically. "I
wanted to see if it would smell or
anything."
That's guarding the Big Game
Bonfire: a bizarre combination of
alcohol, dedication and humor. This
strange mixture reappeared at
Stanford last night for the first time in
three years as 40 or 50 hardy souls
forsook studying to protect the huge
structure from Cal marauders.
Pacific Telephone installed 15 poles
in the lake bed yesterday afternoon to
form the frame of the Bonfire, and
about 6 p.m. the guards appeared,
vowing to stave off Berkeley
pranksters who traditionally try to
touch the flames off before Friday's
rally.
Dope, Nails, Palettes
They occupied their time smoking
dope, nailing up the 1500 wooden
shipping palettes donated by Heublein

Corporation, or drinking from the
seemingly bottomless kegs of beer
provided for guards.
Inter-Fraternity Council President
Mike Nilsson, whose group is
sponsoring the Bonfire, said there was
wide student enthusiasm for guarding
a job traditionally reserved for
freshmen.
"You wouldn't believe the signup
lists in some of the dorms," he said,
sipping from a paper cup of beer.
"There were 57 signups in Donner." In
addition, residents of Zeta Psi and
Kappa Alpha were keeping a constant
watch from their houses, he said.
Possible Sabotage
Tom Pedreira, coordinating the
Bonfire for the IFC, said someone
tried to block its construction by
hiding the telephone poles.
"I believe they had a four-wheel
drive vehicle," Pedreira said. "We came
in this afternoon and someone had
hauled two of the poles away."
Bonfire workers found • the poles
hidden in some brush a few hundred
yards away.
Pedreira refused to guess at who
might have taken the poles "I'm not
going to say anything because
whatever I say will be wrong" but

other workers hinted that anti-Bonfire
ecology groups were responsible.
Other Incidents Unlikely
Pedreira said it was unlikely any
other incidents would take place, since
the Bonfire will be under 24-hour
guard until it's torched at 7 p.m.
tomorrow. Several IFC members said
they intended to sleep in trucks
parked near the Bonfire so they could
keep watch on it.
Most of the talk about pranks last
night was more whimsical. "Tomorrow
night they're coming from Cal in jeeps
and they're going to drive in and
throw molotov cocktails," one man
said with a straight face. "I think we
ought to bring cars in here and circle
the thing so no one can get near it."

in the lake bed yesterday afternoon to
form the frame of the Bonfire, and
about 6 p.m. the guards appeared,
vowing to stave off Berkeley
pranksters who traditionally try to
touch the flames off before Friday's
rally.
Dope, Nails, Palettes
They occupied their time smoking
dope, nailing up the 1500 wooden
shipping palettes donated by Heublein

Corporation, or drinking from the
seemingly bottomless kegs of beer
provided for guards.
Inter-Fraternity Council President
Mike Nilsson, whose group is
sponsoring the Bonfire, said there was
wide student enthusiasm for guarding
a job traditionally reserved for
freshmen.
"You wouldn't believe the signup
lists in some of the dorms," he said,
sipping from a paper cup of beer.
"There were 57 signups in Donner." In
addition, residents of Zeta Psi and
Kappa Alpha were keeping a constant
watch from their houses, he said.
Possible Sabotage
Tom Pedreira, coordinating the
Bonfire for the IFC, said someone
tried to block its construction by
hiding the telephone poles.
"I believe they had a four-wheel
drive vehicle," Pedreira said. "We came
in this afternoon and someone had
hauled two of the poles away."
Bonfire workers found • the poles
hidden in some brush a few hundred
yards away.
Pedreira refused to guess at who
might have taken the poles "I'm not
going to say anything because
whatever I say will be wrong" but

other workers hinted that anti-Bonfire
ecology groups were responsible.
Other Incidents Unlikely
Pedreira said it was unlikely any
other incidents would take place, since
the Bonfire will be under 24-hour
guard until it's torched at 7 p.m.
tomorrow. Several IFC members said
they intended to sleep in trucks
parked near the Bonfire so they could
keep watch on it.
Most of the talk about pranks last
night was more whimsical. "Tomorrow
night they're coming from Cal in jeeps
and they're going to drive in and
throw molotov cocktails," one man
said with a straight face. "I think we
ought to bring cars in here and circle
the thing so no one can get near it."
But an hour later the beer had
begun to take hold, and defense
proposals escalated. "Let's mount a
machine gun on top of it and then just
shoot the shit out of them if they
come in here," a guard said.
Fond Reminiscences
Most of the guards were fraternity
upperclassmen, and they fondly
reminisced about their experiences
guarding the 1971 Bonfire.
"Forrie Martin [football
linebacker] was captain of our team of

guards," one man explained. "He kept
yelling stuff like 'See those guys up
there? They're going to jump us! Get
over there!' Sure, Forrie. T here's a lot
of Cal guys in those bushes."
Another man gazed into one of the
small fires. "Let's burn Larry Horton,"
he finally announced. This prospect
fascinated another guard, who turned
to a friend and explained "Being
burned to death isn't really very
painful at all. You die in inhaling all
the gases long before you actually
burn."
Urinates Playfully
One man, heading back to the beer
keg, stumbled in a trench and fell to
the ground. A companion playfully
urinated near him.
Another truckload of palettes
arrived, and Nilsson tried to coax some
of the beer-drinkers into helping
unload it. "What do you mean? I'm
guarding ," one scowled, gesturing
wildly with his paper cup.
Another man gleefully scaled one
of the telephone poles, startling a
guard who happened to look up.
"Who's that batshit up there?" he
grumbled, and then walked away to
get another beer.

LAKE BED FUN—About 50 students turned out last night to drink beer, and
stumble around the bottom of Lake Lagunita. When they had time, they helped
guard the Big Game Bonfire, which will go up in smoke tomorrow at 7 p.m.
A woman drunkenly lurched up to
one of the several small fires burning
in Lagunita's lake bed last night and
spilled some beer into the flames.
"Hey, what the fuck are you
doing?" inquired a male friend.
"That's good beer."
"I just wanted to see what would
happen," she replied apologetically. "I
wanted to see if it would smell or
anything."
That's guarding the Big Game
Bonfire: a bizarre combination of
alcohol, dedication and humor. This
strange mixture reappeared at
Stanford last night for the first time in
three years as 40 or 50 hardy souls
forsook studying to protect the huge
structure from Cal marauders.
