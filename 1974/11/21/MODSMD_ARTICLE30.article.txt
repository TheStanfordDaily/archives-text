Jumbo Jet Crash In Africa Kills 59
NAIROBI, Kenya The fiery crash of a jumbo jet took
59 lives here yesterday but the rest of the 157 aboard lived
and survivors and officials praised the jet's crew for fast
action. The disaster was the first fatal crash of a Boeing
747.
Seventy-three of the survivors were virtually unharmed,
officials said, and were resting at a hotel before resuming
their trip.
"Looking at the scene, one would not expect too many
survivors," an East African civil aviation official said. "I
think the crew reacted very fast at the first sign of trouble
and that accounts for the very large number of survivors."
The Lufthansa jetliner plunged into a muddy field and
burst into flames moments after lifting off from Nairobi on
a flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg, the airline said.
A Lufthansa official said there were 98 survivors among
the 139 passengers and 18 crewmen aboard the plane.
Twenty-three were admitted to hospitals, three in critical
condition. 1
Most of the passengers were German, but a Lufthansa
official said there were 12 Americans aboard, and a Los
Angeles based travel operator said there were at least 13.
UMW Council Fails To Approve Pact
WASHINGTON The United Mine Workers' bargaining
council failed yesterday to approve a tentative new contract
with the coal industry and urged that union officers return
to the bargaining table.
However, the industry's chief negotiator later issued a
statement indicating that the coal operators were unwilling
to reopen the talks.
As the possibility of a prolonged coal strike mounted,
the UMW council recommended that "some minor
adjustments" be made before the contract offer is
submitted for ratification.
The nationwide walkout, in its , tenth day today, is
already certain to last at least three weeks.
Following the union council's failure to okay the
proposed accord, chief industry spokesman Guy Farmer
said: "It was agreed at the bargaining table that the
agreement as negotiated would be submitted promptly to
the membership for ratification," Farmer said.
The UMW president Arnold Miller said the 38-member
bargaining council had not taken a vote on the proposed
contract nor had it spelled out in detail its objections.
UJS., Japan Pledge 4 New Era'
KYOTO, Japan The United States and Japan pledged
themselves to "a new era of creativity and common
purpose" yesterday to avoid a world economic crisis and

The pledge was in a joint communique that ended the
official parts of President Ford's five-day state visit to
Japan. He then became a tourist, coming to this former
imperial capital for a day of sightseeing among its ancient
glories.
Talks involving Ford, Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and
their staffs were the basis for the communique, which said
the two countries would seek cooperation among
oil-consuming nations to meet energy needs while
maintaining harmonious relations with the oil exporters.
Ford went on national television, meanwhile, to recite
what is fast becoming his slogan: "I would rather walk a
thousand miles for peace than take a single step toward
war."
The presidential party was to spend the night at Kyoto.
Ford leaves Friday morning for Seoul, South Korea, and for

Vladivostok, where he will meet Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev.

The medical team will see Nixon at his oceanside estate
here to determine if he is well enough to testify at the
Watergate cover-up trial of five of his former aides.
The date of the examination was announced at the trial

Jr., told U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica that the
doctors wanted to know how much of Nixon's health
history would be made public.
The judge replied, "As I understand it, it will only be
necessary for the doctors ... to state their conclusions for
the record whether or not we can have a deposition taken
or what have you. You don't have to spread it [Nixon's
medical history] on the public record."

Jumbo Jet Crash In Africa Kills 59
NAIROBI, Kenya The fiery crash of a jumbo jet took
59 lives here yesterday but the rest of the 157 aboard lived
and survivors and officials praised the jet's crew for fast
action. The disaster was the first fatal crash of a Boeing
747.
Seventy-three of the survivors were virtually unharmed,
officials said, and were resting at a hotel before resuming
their trip.
"Looking at the scene, one would not expect too many
survivors," an East African civil aviation official said. "I
think the crew reacted very fast at the first sign of trouble
and that accounts for the very large number of survivors."
The Lufthansa jetliner plunged into a muddy field and
burst into flames moments after lifting off from Nairobi on
a flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg, the airline said.
A Lufthansa official said there were 98 survivors among
the 139 passengers and 18 crewmen aboard the plane.
Twenty-three were admitted to hospitals, three in critical
condition. 1
Most of the passengers were German, but a Lufthansa
official said there were 12 Americans aboard, and a Los

UMW Council Fails To Approve Pact

Court Medics To Check Nixon Monday
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. Former President Richard M.
Nixon was described as still weak and limited in his activity
as word came yesterday that he will be examined on
Monday by three court-appointed doctors.
The medical team will see Nixon at his oceanside estate
here to determine if he is well enough to testify at the
Watergate cover-up trial of five of his former aides.
The date of the examination was announced at the trial
in Washington, D.C., as Nixon's lawyer, Herbert J. Miller
Jr., told U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica that the
doctors wanted to know how much of Nixon's health
history would be made public.
The judge replied, "As I understand it, it will only be
necessary for the doctors ... to state their conclusions for
the record whether or not we can have a deposition taken
or what have you. You don't have to spread it [Nixon's
medical history] on the public record."

Jumbo Jet Crash In Africa Kills 59
NAIROBI, Kenya The fiery crash of a jumbo jet took
59 lives here yesterday but the rest of the 157 aboard lived
and survivors and officials praised the jet's crew for fast
action. The disaster was the first fatal crash of a Boeing
747.
Seventy-three of the survivors were virtually unharmed,
officials said, and were resting at a hotel before resuming
their trip.
"Looking at the scene, one would not expect too many
survivors," an East African civil aviation official said. "I
think the crew reacted very fast at the first sign of trouble
and that accounts for the very large number of survivors."
The Lufthansa jetliner plunged into a muddy field and
burst into flames moments after lifting off from Nairobi on
a flight from Frankfurt to Johannesburg, the airline said.
A Lufthansa official said there were 98 survivors among
the 139 passengers and 18 crewmen aboard the plane.
Twenty-three were admitted to hospitals, three in critical
condition. 1
Most of the passengers were German, but a Lufthansa
official said there were 12 Americans aboard, and a Los
Angeles based travel operator said there were at least 13.
UMW Council Fails To Approve Pact
WASHINGTON The United Mine Workers' bargaining
council failed yesterday to approve a tentative new contract
with the coal industry and urged that union officers return
to the bargaining table.
However, the industry's chief negotiator later issued a
statement indicating that the coal operators were unwilling
to reopen the talks.
As the possibility of a prolonged coal strike mounted,
the UMW council recommended that "some minor
adjustments" be made before the contract offer is
submitted for ratification.
The nationwide walkout, in its , tenth day today, is
already certain to last at least three weeks.
Following the union council's failure to okay the
proposed accord, chief industry spokesman Guy Farmer
said: "It was agreed at the bargaining table that the
agreement as negotiated would be submitted promptly to
the membership for ratification," Farmer said.
The UMW president Arnold Miller said the 38-member
bargaining council had not taken a vote on the proposed
contract nor had it spelled out in detail its objections.
