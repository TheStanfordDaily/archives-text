# Group Advocates Restoration Of Sororities After 30 Years
## 
### SHERI BEBB 
A small, but enthusiastic group of
women met in Mirlo lounge last night
to discuss the possibility of bringing
sororities back to Stanford.
Charlotte Christman, a sophomore
living in Mirlo, called the meeting to
see if there was a strong enough
interest among women here "to go out
and fight whoever we have to fight" to
restore sororities on campus. About 15
persons attended.
Sororities were banned in 1944 by
the University Board of Trustees after
a student referendum which opposed
their continued existence, on the
grounds they created extreme social

pressure.
They would provide "a chance for
women to get together," opined Diane
Kotelnikoff, a junior living in Roth.
The advantage sororities have over
existing women's housing would be
their ability to choose the residents of
the house independent of the housing
draw. A woman also expressed her
desire for continuity in living "with
people you have a commitment to"
the house for more than one year.
In acknowledging anti-sorority
sentiment here, Christman stated "we
have to attack the myth of the
sorority" and get rid of existing
stereotypes.
The women agreed they would have
to build a new image for sororities.
"You'll be looking at a sorority system
that's beginning in 1974-75,"
Christman explained. "[We have to]
demolish the myth of [the] sorority
on this campus. We have to make it
acceptable to Stanford."
The "first objective is to lift the
ban" on sororities, according to Mike
Higgins, a Theta Delta Chi alumnus
who graduated two years ago, and who
is working with the fraternities on
their housing proposal.
"The ban is illegal," according to
Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, Christman
explained, because it discriminates
against women.
The next problem would be to find
houses for the sororities. Higgins said
"it will probably have to be new
housing," since it would be difficult to
remove students from already existing
houses to make room for sororities.
But new housing will not be built on
the Row for at least two years.
The next step is to "show the
University, 'Yes, there is a little bit of
interest' " in sororities, said Higgins.

He said that Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton believes there is
no interest in sororities here but that
this group could show him interest
does exist.
Another housing possibility is for
interested women to draw into the
same all-female house next year, and 4
from there to establish a framework
from which to build greater support,
according to Christman.
National sororities are being
contacted to see if they are interested
in setting up a chapter at Stanford.
Mike Nilsson, president of the 4
Inter-Fraternity Council, has written
to five sororities, according to Higgins.
Kappa Kappa Gamma has already said
they would be willing to begin a
chapter here, he related.

ban" on sororities, according to Mike
Higgins, a Theta Delta Chi alumnus
who graduated two years ago, and who
is working with the fraternities on
their housing proposal.
"The ban is illegal," according to
Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, Christman
explained, because it discriminates
against women.
The next problem would be to find
houses for the sororities. Higgins said
"it will probably have to be new
housing," since it would be difficult to
remove students from already existing
houses to make room for sororities.
But new housing will not be built on
the Row for at least two years.
The next step is to "show the
University, 'Yes, there is a little bit of
interest' " in sororities, said Higgins.

He said that Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Larry Horton believes there is
no interest in sororities here but that
this group could show him interest
does exist.
Another housing possibility is for
interested women to draw into the
same all-female house next year, and 4
from there to establish a framework
from which to build greater support,
according to Christman.
National sororities are being
contacted to see if they are interested
in setting up a chapter at Stanford.
Mike Nilsson, president of the 4
Inter-Fraternity Council, has written
to five sororities, according to Higgins.
Kappa Kappa Gamma has already said
they would be willing to begin a
chapter here, he related.
A small, but enthusiastic group of
women met in Mirlo lounge last night
to discuss the possibility of bringing
sororities back to Stanford.
Charlotte Christman, a sophomore
living in Mirlo, called the meeting to
see if there was a strong enough
interest among women here "to go out
and fight whoever we have to fight" to
restore sororities on campus. About 15
persons attended.
Sororities were banned in 1944 by
the University Board of Trustees after
a student referendum which opposed
their continued existence, on the
grounds they created extreme social

pressure.
They would provide "a chance for
women to get together," opined Diane
Kotelnikoff, a junior living in Roth.
The advantage sororities have over
existing women's housing would be
their ability to choose the residents of
the house independent of the housing
draw. A woman also expressed her
desire for continuity in living "with
people you have a commitment to"
the house for more than one year.
In acknowledging anti-sorority
sentiment here, Christman stated "we
have to attack the myth of the
sorority" and get rid of existing
stereotypes.
The women agreed they would have
to build a new image for sororities.
"You'll be looking at a sorority system
that's beginning in 1974-75,"
Christman explained. "[We have to]
demolish the myth of [the] sorority
on this campus. We have to make it
acceptable to Stanford."
The "first objective is to lift the
ban" on sororities, according to Mike
Higgins, a Theta Delta Chi alumnus
who graduated two years ago, and who
is working with the fraternities on
their housing proposal.
"The ban is illegal," according to
