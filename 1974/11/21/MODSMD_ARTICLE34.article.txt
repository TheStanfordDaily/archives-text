# Stanfordites substitute skiing for studying
## 
### Steve Hefter 
Gliding through fresh knee-deep powder
and racing alone through a white forest of
pine. Sipping Sauvignon by a blazing fire
while your feet unthaw and your boots
drip melted snow.
For many Stanfordites this can be a
weekday, a weekend or a holiday break.
But for a few, a special few, it can be 12
weeks, a year, or a lifetime.
Fall quarter of his junior year Jim
Phelps fled the confining classrooms here
for the snowy mountaintops of the Sierras.
He headed out to Tahoe where he
worked as a lift operator for $5O a week,
barely enough for room and board. At
night he played bass guitar at local bars and
bused tables for extra bucks. But during
the day, five days a week, Phelps skied the
slopes of the North Shore.
Progress
Until taking the quarter off, Phelps had
only skied about 20 times. He could barely
parallel and even his stem turns needed
work.
Today, Phelps can ski anything. And in
any form.
"By doing it five days a week I
improved more than I would have had I
skied the same number of times just on
weekends," he said. "I thought it would
take all season to be as good as I wanted.

But after five or six weeks I could ski as
well as anyone."
No Superman
Phelps is not a superman. At about five
foot nine with blond hair, he's simply a
determined guy and his face lets you know
it. He looks you straight in the eye,
clenches his fist and tightens his forearm
muscles when talking of skiing.
"When I get up to the top of a hill I go
craaaaazy," he said. "I can't wait to start
down. Even when I leave here [Deke
House] I get excited because I know I'm
going to be skiing."
For Phelps, the three main elements of
skiing are powder, bumps and jumps.
"What makes bumps and jumps so great,"
he began, "is the violent physical action
involved. There's an opportunity in the
midst of the violent action to transform
grace."
Beat The Bumps
"With powder you do it for the feel.
You can't do much more once you get
good. But with bumps and jumps you can
work all day and always get better."
When Phelps returned to Stanford last
winter he realized the rewards of his effort.
"Once you take time off," he said, "it
makes going back to school another thing.
You decide you want to go back. You
want to go back to learn things."

The rewards of taking time off were also
evident for Branner freshman Nicole Fiore.
As a ski instructor at Badger Pass' in
Yosemite, she earned $lOO a week plus
free lift tickets and up to $2O extra a day
for giving private lessons.
"I wanted to work on technique," Fiore
explained. "I've been skiing seriously for
about four years."
Every Winter Off
Fiore took her break between high
school and college, skiing from November
to June. The experience was so gratifying
that she plans on taking every winter
quarter off to ski at Badger Pass.
"At night sometimes my mind wanders
off to ski pictures and I can't study," she
said. "If I weren't skiing next quarter I
think I'd go insane. It's not easy for me to
sit all day."
Stanford graduate Ted Suen has the
same problem. After leaving here in 1972,
he went to work in architectural drafting.
Now he plans on taking winter off to ski
the West.
From Telluride to Taos, Aspen to
Breckenridge, Vail to Copper Mountain
Suen plans on skiing them all. Then he will
settle down again and attend grad school at
the University of Utah.
'Go, Live, Enjoy'
For Suen, and for Phelps, Fiore and so

many other students, there is a hedonistic
driving force inside which says "Go, live,
enjoy life while you can."
Sitting in classrooms, reading textbooks
and deciphering scrawled class notes can
not compare with taking in all the wind
sun and snow of mountains and skiing.
Many students find it difficult to do the
former, expecially when daydreaming
about the latter. And others never cast
schooling another glance once they've
tasted the freedom of skiing.
Four years ago Jeanne Russel was
offered a scholarship to come here. But
during the winter of her senior year in high
school she went skiing in the Rockies.
When September rolled around there was
no Jeanne Russel at Stanford. She had
opted for the people, parties and powder
of Aspen, Colo.
Perhaps Jim Phelps suggested the best
raison d'etre of those who substitute four
feet of powder for four units of physics.
"I'm going to go ahead and get my
degree," he said. 'Then I'm going to ski,
surf and play volleyball until I've had as
much as I want. I want to learn how to
hang-glide, white-water [canoe] and
perhaps scuba dive, yeah that too. And
then, when I'm all done, then I'll think
about being somebody."

clenches his fist and tightens his forearm
muscles when talking of skiing.
"When I get up to the top of a hill I go
craaaaazy," he said. "I can't wait to start
down. Even when I leave here [Deke
House] I get excited because I know I'm
going to be skiing."
For Phelps, the three main elements of
skiing are powder, bumps and jumps.
"What makes bumps and jumps so great,"
he began, "is the violent physical action
involved. There's an opportunity in the
midst of the violent action to transform
grace."
Beat The Bumps
"With powder you do it for the feel.
You can't do much more once you get
good. But with bumps and jumps you can
work all day and always get better."
When Phelps returned to Stanford last
winter he realized the rewards of his effort.
"Once you take time off," he said, "it
makes going back to school another thing.
You decide you want to go back. You
want to go back to learn things."

The rewards of taking time off were also
evident for Branner freshman Nicole Fiore.
As a ski instructor at Badger Pass' in
Yosemite, she earned $lOO a week plus
free lift tickets and up to $2O extra a day
for giving private lessons.
"I wanted to work on technique," Fiore
explained. "I've been skiing seriously for
about four years."
Every Winter Off
Fiore took her break between high
school and college, skiing from November
to June. The experience was so gratifying
that she plans on taking every winter
quarter off to ski at Badger Pass.
"At night sometimes my mind wanders
off to ski pictures and I can't study," she
said. "If I weren't skiing next quarter I
think I'd go insane. It's not easy for me to
sit all day."
Stanford graduate Ted Suen has the
same problem. After leaving here in 1972,
he went to work in architectural drafting.
Now he plans on taking winter off to ski
the West.
From Telluride to Taos, Aspen to
Breckenridge, Vail to Copper Mountain
Suen plans on skiing them all. Then he will
settle down again and attend grad school at
the University of Utah.
'Go, Live, Enjoy'
For Suen, and for Phelps, Fiore and so

many other students, there is a hedonistic
driving force inside which says "Go, live,
enjoy life while you can."
Sitting in classrooms, reading textbooks
and deciphering scrawled class notes can
not compare with taking in all the wind
sun and snow of mountains and skiing.
Many students find it difficult to do the
former, expecially when daydreaming
about the latter. And others never cast
schooling another glance once they've
tasted the freedom of skiing.
Four years ago Jeanne Russel was
offered a scholarship to come here. But
during the winter of her senior year in high
school she went skiing in the Rockies.
When September rolled around there was
no Jeanne Russel at Stanford. She had
opted for the people, parties and powder
of Aspen, Colo.
Perhaps Jim Phelps suggested the best
raison d'etre of those who substitute four
feet of powder for four units of physics.
"I'm going to go ahead and get my
degree," he said. 'Then I'm going to ski,
surf and play volleyball until I've had as
much as I want. I want to learn how to
hang-glide, white-water [canoe] and
perhaps scuba dive, yeah that too. And
then, when I'm all done, then I'll think
about being somebody."

Gliding through fresh knee-deep powder
and racing alone through a white forest of
pine. Sipping Sauvignon by a blazing fire
while your feet unthaw and your boots
drip melted snow.
For many Stanfordites this can be a
weekday, a weekend or a holiday break.
But for a few, a special few, it can be 12
weeks, a year, or a lifetime.
Fall quarter of his junior year Jim
Phelps fled the confining classrooms here
for the snowy mountaintops of the Sierras.
He headed out to Tahoe where he
worked as a lift operator for $5O a week,
barely enough for room and board. At
night he played bass guitar at local bars and
bused tables for extra bucks. But during
the day, five days a week, Phelps skied the
slopes of the North Shore.
Progress
Until taking the quarter off, Phelps had
only skied about 20 times. He could barely
parallel and even his stem turns needed
work.
Today, Phelps can ski anything. And in
any form.
"By doing it five days a week I
improved more than I would have had I
skied the same number of times just on
weekends," he said. "I thought it would
take all season to be as good as I wanted.

But after five or six weeks I could ski as
well as anyone."
No Superman
Phelps is not a superman. At about five
foot nine with blond hair, he's simply a
determined guy and his face lets you know
it. He looks you straight in the eye,
clenches his fist and tightens his forearm
muscles when talking of skiing.

to June. The experience was so gratifying
that she plans on taking every winter
quarter off to ski at Badger Pass.
"At night sometimes my mind wanders
off to ski pictures and I can't study," she
said. "If I weren't skiing next quarter I
think I'd go insane. It's not easy for me to
sit all day."
Stanford graduate Ted Suen has the
same problem. After leaving here in 1972,
he went to work in architectural drafting.
Now he plans on taking winter off to ski
the West.
From Telluride to Taos, Aspen to
Breckenridge, Vail to Copper Mountain
Suen plans on skiing them all. Then he will
settle down again and attend grad school at
the University of Utah.
'Go, Live, Enjoy'
For Suen, and for Phelps, Fiore and so

many other students, there is a hedonistic
driving force inside which says "Go, live,
enjoy life while you can."
Sitting in classrooms, reading textbooks
and deciphering scrawled class notes can
not compare with taking in all the wind
sun and snow of mountains and skiing.
Many students find it difficult to do the
former, expecially when daydreaming
about the latter. And others never cast
schooling another glance once they've
tasted the freedom of skiing.
Four years ago Jeanne Russel was
offered a scholarship to come here. But
during the winter of her senior year in high
school she went skiing in the Rockies.
When September rolled around there was
no Jeanne Russel at Stanford. She had
opted for the people, parties and powder
of Aspen, Colo.
Perhaps Jim Phelps suggested the best
raison d'etre of those who substitute four
feet of powder for four units of physics.
"I'm going to go ahead and get my
degree," he said. 'Then I'm going to ski,
surf and play volleyball until I've had as
much as I want. I want to learn how to
hang-glide, white-water [canoe] and
perhaps scuba dive, yeah that too. And
then, when I'm all done, then I'll think
about being somebody."

Gliding through fresh knee-deep powder
and racing alone through a white forest of
pine. Sipping Sauvignon by a blazing fire
while your feet unthaw and your boots
drip melted snow.
For many Stanfordites this can be a
weekday, a weekend or a holiday break.
But for a few, a special few, it can be 12
weeks, a year, or a lifetime.
Fall quarter of his junior year Jim
Phelps fled the confining classrooms here
for the snowy mountaintops of the Sierras.
He headed out to Tahoe where he
worked as a lift operator for $5O a week,
barely enough for room and board. At
night he played bass guitar at local bars and
bused tables for extra bucks. But during
the day, five days a week, Phelps skied the
slopes of the North Shore.
Progress
Until taking the quarter off, Phelps had
only skied about 20 times. He could barely
parallel and even his stem turns needed
work.
Today, Phelps can ski anything. And in
any form.
"By doing it five days a week I
improved more than I would have had I
skied the same number of times just on
weekends," he said. "I thought it would
take all season to be as good as I wanted.

But after five or six weeks I could ski as
well as anyone."
No Superman
Phelps is not a superman. At about five
foot nine with blond hair, he's simply a
determined guy and his face lets you know
it. He looks you straight in the eye,
clenches his fist and tightens his forearm
muscles when talking of skiing.
"When I get up to the top of a hill I go
craaaaazy," he said. "I can't wait to start
down. Even when I leave here [Deke
House] I get excited because I know I'm
going to be skiing."
For Phelps, the three main elements of
skiing are powder, bumps and jumps.
"What makes bumps and jumps so great,"
he began, "is the violent physical action
involved. There's an opportunity in the
midst of the violent action to transform
grace."
Beat The Bumps
"With powder you do it for the feel.
You can't do much more once you get
good. But with bumps and jumps you can
work all day and always get better."
When Phelps returned to Stanford last
winter he realized the rewards of his effort.
"Once you take time off," he said, "it
makes going back to school another thing.
You decide you want to go back. You
want to go back to learn things."

The rewards of taking time off were also
evident for Branner freshman Nicole Fiore.
As a ski instructor at Badger Pass' in
Yosemite, she earned $lOO a week plus
free lift tickets and up to $2O extra a day
for giving private lessons.
"I wanted to work on technique," Fiore
explained. "I've been skiing seriously for
about four years."
Every Winter Off

to June. The experience was so gratifying
