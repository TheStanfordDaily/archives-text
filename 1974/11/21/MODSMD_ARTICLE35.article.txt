# Trends in ski equipment
## Beware of flashy hot-doggers on short skis 
### Dan Pyne 
A few years ago, the subtleties of skiing
were quite simple. Everyone who wanted
to be anyone needed Head or Hart skis,
Marker bindings, Reicher boots, and White
Stag stretch pants.
The skis ran about $lOO, the bindings
about $5O, the boots around $75, and the
stretch pants about $4O. No one really
worried about parkas as long as they were
nylon, or at least looked like nylon.
Oh, yes, hats had tassels, and ran about
$3.
Then some joker made a fibreglass ski,
and someone else found that you could put
buckles on boots, and someone else said
Marker bindings weren't as good as people
and someone else realized that
stretch pants felt like something was trying
to pull your hips down around your knees,
and everyone found that tassels.came off
hats and got iost.
Big Time
Prices went up, lift lines got longer, Jean
Claude Killy won three gold medals and
everyone started skiing the new "French
way" and calling their friends
Pierre ... ("Bonjour, Pierre. Ca va bien?")
Today, to anyone who goes into a ski
shop and surveys the many different skis
against the wall and all those boots and the
70 bronze-faced salespeople with goggle
marks and striped sweaters, it is quite clear
that this whole skilaufen business has
become extremely complex and
expensive.

This year, a few new trends are evident,
and a few new products are being
introduced.
Shorter Skis
Perhaps the most significant is the move
toward shorter skis, which has enabled the
shaky intermediate to ramble down
Ruthie's Run with the experts. Moguls
seem a heck of a lot less trouble for people
with shorter skis.
In the "good old days," a person bought
skis which reached, with an arm extended
above the head, to the wrist. A six-footer
skied on about 200 centimenter skis.
Today, "ski companies are making
compressed skis," Lynn Hauk of Shreve's
Sport Shop in Menlo Park explained. "A
compressed ski lets you put a heavier, taller
person on a shorter ski without losing
flexibility."
People are going to shorter skis, she
said, "because they want to have more fun.
You can do more on a shorter ski, and you
don't have to work as much."
Muscle, Not Punch
But to people who think anyone on
anything over 190 centimeters is crazy, Jim
Phelps, an avid student skier here, issues a
warning. "There's not much you can do on
longs that you can't do on shorts, except
go fast. But a shorter ski won't carve a
turn. You don't have to punch your turns
the way you do with longer skis; you can
just muscle your skis around."
For many skiers, carving the turn is the
essence of the sport. It involves a dropping.

then pushing with the knees that reverses
the bend (camber) of the skis, to cut an arc
in the snow.
But "people are getting lazier," Wendy
McPherson of the Short Swing Inc. ski
shop in Palo Alto explained. 'The average
weekend skier is not in good shape and
doesn't want to work as much, so instead
of carving their turns they just sort of
swish their skis around."
Trends
Some say the short ski trend is
transitional, but they may be the same

people who said buckle boots would never
last. ("You can't get them to fit right,"
they used to explain.)
Speaking of boots, new developments
are even making buckles look
old-fashioned. According to McPherson,
boots are getting taller, giving more lateral
support and more forward-backward
flexibility.
Nordica, of bright yellow Banana boot
fame, remains the best seller, offering a
wide variety of styles and prices to suit
most tastes and budgets (if the price of ski
equipment can suit any budget).
The "foam boot" has been replaced by
the "flow boot" as manufacturers found
that injected foam tends to break down
with use.
Flow boots have an already solid foam
padding that responds to pressure from the
foot to form the same tight fit as in a foam
boot, but with a more durable support.
Where in an injected-foam boot the plastic
hardens and never changes, in the flow
boot the flexible padding can adjust if
necessary, and won't break down.
. Innovative Boot
Scott makes a boot a little different
from most, and a good example of
innovation. It is extremely lightweight,
molded entirely out of stiff plastic, and
insulated with a special foam which fits the
boot to any foot.
The Scott boot has only one buckle,
and a very thin sole. It runs about $l6O,
