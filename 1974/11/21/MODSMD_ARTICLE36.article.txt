# Snowtrain: the romantic idea that melted fast
## 
### Glenn Kramon 
Last winter, when those gas station lines started
to get long, Amtrak and Northstar-At-Tahoe ski
area introduced their own romantic solution to the
energy crisis.
They organized a "Snowtrain" to whisk skiers
from the Bay Area through the snowy Sierras to
Truckee, in the Tahoe ski country, without the
worry of finding gasoline or losing control on
slippery roads.
The Pony Express would have done a better job.
The train never left Oakland station. The whole
thing flopped. "We burned all the publicity
material," said an employee in Northstar's San
Francisco office. "It was an expensive mistake."
People just wouldn't buy the Snowtrain, which
mass transit enthusiasts praised as a step toward
eliminating skiers' dependence on the automobile.
'Before Its Time'
Everybody's got a different reason why the
ambitious project never left the station, but most
agree with Nick Badami, chairman of the board at
Alpine Meadows, that the Snowtrain "was simply
an idea before its time."
"People are just not geared to getting on trains,"
explains Northstar spokesman Ron McGrath. "The
gasoline shortage just hasn't hit hard enough here.
Trains are big for skiers in Europe, but there's a
natural reluctance to use them in this country."
Southern Pacific Railroad officials, who for
years have tried to lure Peninsula auto commuters,
can probably nod in uncomfortable sympathy.
"Americans are a little spoiled," Badami adds.
"It's too easy for them to jump into a car and drive
on good roads up to the mountains. If you've ever
tried to drive on the road between Geneva and St.
Moritz, you'll know why people over there always
take the train."
Party Trains
He recalls his college days just before World War
II when gangs of student skiers would pile into a
New York train bound for the Vermont slopes.
The old iron horses took about 10 hours to
make the trip, but Badami remembers that none of
the skiers ever looked at the clock because they
were having fun.
"We always had a big party on the way up.
Nobody ever slept. We wanted to take the train;
skiing was only half the trip."
Jerry Herrmann, editor of the Truckee
hewspaper, recalls a similar train popular among
Sierra-bound Bay Area skiers in the first half of this
century.
No Time Today
Nobody,, least of all students, seems to have time
to take the long train ride these days, particularly
the way the Snowtrain was organized. Scheduled to
leave on a Sunday and return five days later, it
virtually eliminated the student who still thinks
attending class is in vogue.
And the five- to six-hour trip would have begun
in the morning, a good time for people who enjoy
snowy Sierra panoramas and deluxe buffet
luncheons, but an inconvenient time for real ski
enthusiasts who don't want to miss a precious day
on the slopes.

Moreover, Oakland station is half way to the
slopes in the minds of skiers living in the southern
portion of the Peninsula who must drive an hour
just to get to the train.
A regular Amtrak train still stops in Truckee
several times a day, and some 300 skiers did reach
the slopes that way last year.
Expensive
But most frugal skiers are even more reluctant to
buy the $3O round-trip ticket when they could just
as easily cram five people into a Volkswagon and
drive up for considerably less.
Even if the skier, in the noble interest of saving
oil and air, had agreed to pay more and
inconvenience himself a little, the Snowtfain still
would have been frozen by other problems.
The scenic ride through the mountains is just as
taxing on a train as on a car. Climbing these hills
increases fuel consumption, and the train must
switch crews in Sacramento, increasing labor
expenses.
Once the train reaches Truckee, moreover, it
would have to contend with an embarrassingly
small station whose platform is only two railroad
cars long. The train would have to unload two cars
at a time, so that impatient skiers in the tenth car
of a crowded Snowtrain would have to sit tight and
watch the sun go down.
Oops!
But that's not the worst of it, says Amtrak
spokesman Steve Liebhart. "It's hard to keep the
train stili because it'll be stopped on a slight hill. So
the train keeps jerking back and forth" as people,
their equipment flying in all directions, attempt to
disembark.
After everybody's gotten off, the Snowtrain
must go somewhere. It does. All the way to Sparks,
Nev., the closest place where it can be turned
around and sent back down to the Bay Area.
And how do the skiers get from Truckee station
to their hotels? After all, Truckee hardly conjures
an image of romantic Zermatt, Switzerland, where
horse-drawn sleds greet you at the station with
jingling bells.
Prospective Snowtrain passengers probably
feared this inability to move around once they got
off the train as the best reason to keep on using
their cars on ski trips.
Push For Transit
So everybody in Truckee is pushing for a mass
transit system. Right now, some ski areas and
motels run small shuttle buses to Truckee station.
But there's still no public transportation system.
In an effort to prove to the federal government
that the area could use a mass transit subsidy,
several ski areas, the business community, Placer
County and the public at large have contributed to
a $142,000 four-month experimental bqs system.
If the public can raise $20,000 by about the end
of the month, the Las Vegas-Tonapah-Reno Line
will begin Dec. 15 an hourly service on the North
Shore of Lake Tahoe, stopping at the train station,
the bus depot and the airport in Truckee and at
several ski areas.
If the bus system works, and if mass transit
catches on, someday a packed Sierra Snowtrain
may be chugging out of Oakland after all.
