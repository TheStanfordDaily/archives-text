# It's not all wine and kisses for ski team racers
## 
### Lyn Littlefield 
Suffer, Tolerate, Endure are words
painfully familiar to ? long distance runner,
or a cyclist... but do they exist in the
vocabulary of a ski racer?
No. The racer's language functions as a
happy mask, invoking images of storming
down the mountain with a tune in your
head, carving turns to the rhythm. Of wine
picnics in the sun and of kissing on the
chairlift after an exhilaratingly fast run.
Who would ever think Agony and
Frustration to be words in the Stanford ski
team member's vocabulary?
Horrors
But how can language disguise the
horror of spending a clear sunny day in the
emergency room of the Reno Hospital?
Or waiting out 10 hours of stalled
traffic on snow-clogged Route 80 the night
before a race?
Or taking a Monday morning exam after
having studied a total of 40 minutes while
eating a hot dog in the lodge at lunch?
Or worst of all, huffing and puffing up
and down stadium steps as part of an
exhausting training program which

prepares these student skiers not only for
racing/but for all the hassles that go along
with it.
Harder Than Ever
Each autumn the ski team trains harder
than the previous year, for past winters
have found competitors unprepared to deal
with the intensity of their endeavors.
Tearing up and down the stadium steps
is a vital part of the workout, but is less
needed for racing than for boot-packing
trudging up and down the course in your
heavy boots, with your skis on your back,
in order to pack down the snow.
Jogging endlessly around Angell Field is
used as a psychological prep, for it helps
inure the skier to the frustration of
laboring only to see himself end up where
he began at the bottom.
Backwards running not only strengthens
the legs, but accustoms the racer to the
amount of forward vision he'll have when
racing in a blizzard.
Such tortures also gear the racer for
climbing the mountain, as lift tickets are
only an occasional luxury for team
members who must shell out a large

percentage of the cost of racing.
In order to cut costs they trade man
hours for reduced lift rates at Slide
Mountain. This autumn most of the racers
worked weekends at Slide Mountain,
painting the lodge and clearing trails.
A local ski shop also helps the racers by
giving discounts to varsity members, and
the team receives money from the club
sports program here.
Volunteer Coaches
And the coaches volunteer their own
time and money. Skip Stritter, a Ph.D. in
computer science here, will be running the
team for the third year.
- Lack of varsity status has until this year
been an obstacle as frustrating as fighting a
blizzard during a race. This year's captain
Tom Hutton qualified for the NCAAs and
went as far as the practice runs at Jackson
Hole, Wyo. before being informed that he
couldn't compete.
Now anyone who qualifies from the
team can definitely compete because the
Athletic Department has granted the skiers
associate varsity status. Under this
arrangement, the University sanctionsJh' >

sport, but does not hold financial
responsibility for it.
Improvisation
A dearth of skiers with background in
jumping and cross country has also plagued
the team. Skip Stritter explains that few
skiers on the West Coast have developed
these skills at a young enough age.
So the team continues to improvise by
risking its best downhill skiers on the
hazardous ski jumps and in the grueling
cross country marathons. To complete the
Nordic team, long distance runners have
been borrowed from the cross country
team. Though they're enthusiastic and fit,
most are not great skiers.
Nevertheless, the team ranks with the
University of Nevada, and Sierra College in
the top three on the West Coast And
Stritter feels optimistic abov the coming
season.
Once the racers have undergone the
gruesome floundering of the
training camp, he believer tfegw
