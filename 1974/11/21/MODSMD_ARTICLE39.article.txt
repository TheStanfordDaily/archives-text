# Ski club offers trips, discounts
## 
### 
The Stanford ski club is up to
its old discount tricks again this
year. Ski club President Mark
Winkler reports that a $5
membership fee will entitle one to
$5 mid-week tickets at
Heavenly Valley ski area;
lift ticket discounts at
Squaw Valley;
probable discounts on two
cabins, arrangements pending;
discounts of at least $3 on
trips.
Trips right now are planned for
Utah over Thanksgiving break,
and for Sun Valley, Idaho the
week of Dec. 14-21. Winkler says

the club also plans to arrange the
annual Winter Carnival at either
Squaw Valley or Heavenly Valley.
Because of "problems getting
volunteers to work on organizing
trips," Winkler noted that the ski
club this year will act as a
"broker" rather than set up the
entire trip.
"We'll find the cheapest
existing group package deals that
we can" to fit the University's
vacation schedule, he said.
The Utah trip next week will
include four days of skiing two
at Park City and one each at
Snowbird and Alta. The price of

$96.50 for ski club members,
$99.50 for others, pays for
transportation, lodging, lift
tickets, two dances, a beer race
and two wine and cheese parties.
The December trip to Sun
Valley, at $189.90 for members
and $193.50 for non-members,
includes round-trip air
transportation, lodging and lift
tickets.
And the ski club may still be
around after the last spring snows
have melted. "We're now in the
process of exploring year-round
activities such as hiking and
backpacking trips, and
white-water rafting," Winkler
said,.
But the club needs more
people to work on organization of
activities. Those interested in
working out the arrangements for
such trips should contact Mark at
326-6739 or Jackie at 497-3542.
