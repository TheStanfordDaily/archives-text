# Pending Budget Cuts Could Cripple Academics Greatly
## 
### MARK LICKER 
Department chairmen have
expressed uncertainty and concern
about where cuts will be made in next
year's University budget, and what the
consequences will be for educational
programs. The Administration has
asked them to consider possible
reductions of up to 17 percent in
operating budgets over the next three
years.
Philosophy department chairman
Julius Moravcsik expressed concern
about the present freeze on faculty
hiring.
"We need 12 to 13 philosophers in
the department, and want an
appointment in social-political
philosophy. Any further cuts at all and
we would no longer be competitive
with the top 20 [philosophy
departments]," Moravcsik remarked.
Other chairmen voiced similar
ideas. And Anthropology Prof. Frank
Cancian observed where potential cuts
would do the most damage.
"For the past three years, we have

been barely skimping along. There is
very little fat in the program," Cancian
noted. "Cuts are really going to hurt in
course offerings and decreasing faculty
opportunities. It is going to cut into
faculty research time."
Continued Strength Desired
Joseph Van Campen, chairman of
the Slavic Languages and Literatures
Department, hoped the department
could maintain its strength despite the
retirement of one senior faculty
member.
"[We are] possibly in danger of
losing one-third of our literature staff,
which would be very damaging to our
program. We can't survive as a viable
Ph.D. program, with a strong
undergraduate major, with that
reduction," Van Campen lamented.
Similar views were also expressed
outside the School of Humanities and
Sciences. Robert Eustis, associate dean
of the School of Engineering, said the
school hopes to increase income from
research overhead.
"[There is] a very deep concern on

the part of faculty about cuts in the
academic part of the University
[budget]," Eustis observed. "My
personal feeling is that if 10 percent
cuts do come, departments will have
to vanish."
Although the School of Medicine
receives unrestricted funds on a
formula basis, Dean Clayton Rich
figured that the school is in much the
same shape as other schools in the
University.
"[lt] faces the same kinds of
constraints as the rest of the
University inflation, collapse of
returns on endowment, and the same
trends of a deficit," Rich stated. The
medical school's rate of deficit,
however, will not be as bad during the
next two years as for the
University-at-large, he added.
No Specific Priorities
No specific budget priorities or
reductions have yet been announced
by Administrators, who are presently
consulting with the dean of the seven
schools. Moravcsik felt there is need
for much more consultation between
faculty and the office of Vice Provost
for Budget and Planning Raymond
Bacchetti. Adding that Humanities and
Sciences Dean Halsey Royden "has
done a fine job so far," Moravcsik said
"the only way to handle cuts
rationally is for them not to come
from the academic budget. In times of
crisis, we should concentrate on what
the University is about: teaching
students in small classes."
Criticizing funding of "frills,"
Moravcsik called road construction
"absolutely crazy," and concluded
that "when it comes to the University
making housing loans to senior
professors, I'm absolutely against it."
Art Prof. Lorenz Eitner flatly
stated that "no one really expects cuts
of that magnitude [l7 percent]. In
Humanities and Sciences, it would be
catastrophic. Ninety-six percent of the
budget consists of salaries ... to save
anything like 17 percent, you would
have to cut salaries. This means
teaching "
