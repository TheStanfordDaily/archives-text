# Dauntless mountain-killers name the tougher ski slopes

What is the toughest ski run that you've been
on? What makes it tough? Most importantly, what
determines whether or not you will go down it
again?
Self-proclaimed mountain conquerors here had
plenty of answers.
Concentrating on California areas, interviews
proved the most notorious slope to be the grueling
West Face of KT-22 at Squaw Valley. Riding up the
lift, you see underneath you the mogul-ridden East
Bowl, only a hint of what the West Face is like.
As you slide off the ramp and ski down the crest
to the right, KT's West Face, a true vertical horror,
awaits you. It's so steep that, from above, you can
only see some of the slope. And if you manage to
stop on the way down you'll notice you can often
touch the snowy hill just above you by simply
extending your arm.
'Straight Down'
Skip Stritter, a coach on the Stanford ski team,
compares the West Face to Exhibition, a run at Sun
Valley renowned for its deep moguls. Speaking of
KT's terrain he said, "The West Face just goes
straight down and never gives up."
Another ski team member, junior Dave Horth,
agreed with Stritter's choice. Taken alone, the
steepness of KT's West Face isn't so bad, Horth
said.
However, he admitted that the whole
psychological approach can get the adrenalin going
when he thinks of the steepness in terms of the
speed he would attain if he made any kind of slip.
Sliding 50 yards on your back can be frightening.
When asked why he voluntarily subjects himself
to the hazards of the West Face, Horth said that "if
you spend a whole day on it, then when you go
onto the easier slopes it's a breeze."
Narrow Threat
Challenging KT-22 is a demanding slope at
Mammoth Mountain called "Climax." "It's not so
tough as it is narrow," Horth said, noting the slope

starts out as a bowl and then harrows to 40 or 50
feet wide with ominous rocks on both sides and
deep moguls marring the path.
"Climax" got another solid vote of respect from
sophomore Lisa Fiedler, a Californian whose skiing
experience ranges from the Sierras to the Alps.
But why go down such a tough slope if it looks
so threatening from the lift? Fiedler and most of
her skiing peers seemed to agree that it was the
challenge of conquering the hill without getting
killed which kept them from teetering on the brink
of indecision at the top of a threatening slope.
Moving back up into the Lake Tahoe region,
another tough run is "Gunbarrel" at Heavenly
Valley. If you're the type who gets his kicks
vicariously, you can sit in the lodge and watch
skiers descend "Gunbarrel," which ends its steep
run practically at the lodge door.
'Humongous'
But if you are on the hill, you might feel like
junior Erik Humber, who skis for the typical "fun
day in the snow." Humber said he didn't enjoy
"Gunbarrel" at all, and that besides being the
toughest run he'd been on, it was icy and had
"humongous" moguls.
Why did he ski it? "It was the fastest way down
at the end of a long day."
An employee at a local ski shop said that
"Gunbarrel" made her wince not only for its steep
terrain but because so many people skied it. In her
words, the conditions were "Kamakasi-like." you
took your life in your hands when bombing by or
over other skiers.
No Way Out
A slope much less traveled, but equally
challenging is "Silver Bell" at Sugar Bowl. Junior
Mike Levinthal described it as narrow with sudden,
steep drop-offs. Levinthal cautioned that once you
start down, there is no way out but to keep going
down. Moreover, you can't see the whole run from

ttie top and the "unknowing" of
what is ahead is unnerving.
If Levinthal felt "Silver Bell"
so foreboding, why did he go
down it? "Why do you go
skiing?" he replied.
It makes sense that cross
country ski tourers are not out for
the tough slope but rather for the
gentle and picturesque areas to
enjoy at their leisure.
However, some Nordic racing
courses require endurance that
would make the Alpine mountain
master drop from exhaustion.
Porter Story, a Stanford medical
student, felt the track at Boreal
Ridge to be the toughest in the
Sierras.
Another Nordic skier, junior
Frank Johns, considered the track
at Mt. Rose to be one of the
rougher ones he'd seen. It consists
of a tiring 2-3 mile loop which
racers must circle several times.
No matter what kind of skis
you're on, slope difficulty is all a
matter of mind. After all, to the
petrified novice out for the first-'
time, even the descent ramp from
the ski lift looks like a sheer cliff.
