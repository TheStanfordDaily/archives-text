# Hoover Fellow Predicts Recession
## Economist Sees Slower Inflation 
### DAN PYNE 
"I'm optimistic that inflation will
drop considerably this year,"
economist Thomas G. Moore said in an
interview yesterday, "but this will
mean recession ... probably the worst
recession since World War 11, and a
high unemployment rate, perhaps as
much as seven percent.
Moore, a senior fellow in economics
at the Hoover Institution, attended
two of President Ford's mini-economic
conferences earlier this fall and
proposed 32 steps designed to combat
rising price levels.

"My proposals are basically
concerned with 32 government
constraints regulating transportation,
shipping, agriculture, imports, and
other markets," Moore remarked.
"The economists at the conferences
almost unanimously agreed that
changes ought to be made in these
areas."
But, he said, at the economic
summit "the result was that the
President proposed a commission be
set up to study the problem. The
commission has a three year life span,
but the momentum will be gone in
three years. A report will be filed and
forgotten."
Moore admitted he was "a little
disappointed" with the economic
conferences, and though he was
invited to the main summit, he did not
attend. "I figured it would be a
madhouse," he said. "I wouldn't have
been able to get my points in."
Ford Program 'Very Mild'
Although he does not advocate
extremely strong programs directed at
either unemployment or inflation,
Moore said that President Ford's
economic program is "very mild."
"What he's doing now is not a great
deal. His tax-surcharge proposal was
called a 'marshmallow' and I think it
is. It doesn't really hurt anyone that
much; the impact [on consumption] is
very small," Moore charged.
Moore's 32 proposals would
attempt to eliminate governmental
restrictions on market supplies. Moore
pointed out that, in California this
year, peach farmers were knocking the
buds off of peach trees to keep the
supply down and the price up.
'lncreasing Supply'
"It's particularly a question of
increasing supply," he said. "If you
remove restrictions on supply, prices
will begin to fall. My proposals do not
really affect the rate of inflation; my
proposals would lower price levels
once and for all. In doing this, prices
would be lower than they would

otherwise be, even if the rate of
inflation remains."
Moore contended that "the rate of
inflation is affected mainly by the
quantity of money existing; if you
increase the money supply rapidly,
inflation results. If we want to deal
with inflation, we've also got to
restrict the supply of money to get
people to cut back on consumption."
While a drop in prices will usually
cause a drop in the rate of inflation,
Moore claimed, certain factors that he
calls "delayed inflation" tend to
prevent the immediate elimination of
inflation. Some wages, notably those
of organized labor, have to catch up
with the price level, and any costs or

prices set on a periodic basis will need
time to catch up with inflation as well,
he explained.
Price Leveling Possible
But Moore claims that it is possible
for both inflation and prices to level
out, if the government acts "sensibly."
"If the Federal Reserve Board
begins slowly to increase money,
business will start to pick up toward
the middle of next year. If they panic
at a rising unemployment rate and
throw a lot of money into the
economy, inflation will take off
again," he hypothesized.
Moore said that during the coming
recession "some prices will drop, but
overall I don't expect prices to decline."
