# Fasters To Protest Starvation
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Dozens of Stanford students and 200,000 other
Americans concerned about the world's starving millions
will participate today in a day-long fast.
Residents of Columbae House agreed to consume only
water, fruit juices, coffee, tea and broth for the entire day,
and have urged other students to join them.
Fasters have been asked by the organizers of the event
the American affiliate of the Oxford Committee for Famine
Relief, Oxfam-America—to donate whatever money they
would have spent on the day's food.
Columbae resident Scott Stratford said that the house
will act as an a go-between for cash contributions.
"We will act as coordinators for people who don't want
to send the money themselves to Oxfam-America in
Boston," Stratford said.
'Water Dinner' Tonight
Columbae is sponsoring a "water dinner" this evening at
6 p.m., which will be open to the public.
"It's a kind of reaffirmation of our feelings," Stratford
commented. "The dinner will commemorate the fact that
we are participating in the fast. We must recognize that it's
a community effort."
Organizers at Columbae had hoped that on-campus living
groups would join in the fast and get rebates from the
University Food Service. But Food Service Manager Maxine
Anderson said that groups must give a week's notice to
obtain rebates.
Time Lag Explained
Stratford explained why residences weren't informed of

the event in time to apply for rebates.
"We were just notified of this a letter from
Oxfam-America. That's why the publicity has been so late,"
he remarked.
Stratford and Stephanie Brown, also of Columbae, said
in a statement that, while the World Food Conference in
Rome shows that nations are concerned about starvation,
not a single country has contributed sizeable amounts to
world food reserves.
Private Aid 'Crucial'
"Aid from the private sector, which ultimately consists
of individual contributions, is crucial in filling the gap that
governments have created by their inertia," they stated.
They criticized Americans for maintaining a
"conservation ethic" for gasoline, while having no qualms
about wasting food.
"Americans as a nation consume two times more calories
than our bodies need to function well, and four times more
meat protein than our bodies can utilize," they noted.
Immediate Famine Relief
About 30 percent of the funds collected nationally will
be used for immediate famine relief, according to Columbae
resident Jane Stoner.
A spokesman for Oxfam-America said that, by not
eating, Americans will be adding to global food reserves,
symbolically if not substantially.
She emphasized that one aim of the program is "to get
Americans conscious of what it's like to be hungry, to
identify will the starving millions."

the American affiliate of the Oxford Committee for Famine
Relief, Oxfam-America—to donate whatever money they
would have spent on the day's food.
Columbae resident Scott Stratford said that the house
will act as an a go-between for cash contributions.
"We will act as coordinators for people who don't want
to send the money themselves to Oxfam-America in
Boston," Stratford said.
'Water Dinner' Tonight
Columbae is sponsoring a "water dinner" this evening at
6 p.m., which will be open to the public.
"It's a kind of reaffirmation of our feelings," Stratford
commented. "The dinner will commemorate the fact that
we are participating in the fast. We must recognize that it's
a community effort."
Organizers at Columbae had hoped that on-campus living
groups would join in the fast and get rebates from the
University Food Service. But Food Service Manager Maxine
Anderson said that groups must give a week's notice to
obtain rebates.
Time Lag Explained
Stratford explained why residences weren't informed of

the event in time to apply for rebates.
"We were just notified of this a letter from
Oxfam-America. That's why the publicity has been so late,"
he remarked.
Stratford and Stephanie Brown, also of Columbae, said
in a statement that, while the World Food Conference in
Rome shows that nations are concerned about starvation,
not a single country has contributed sizeable amounts to
world food reserves.
Private Aid 'Crucial'
"Aid from the private sector, which ultimately consists
of individual contributions, is crucial in filling the gap that
governments have created by their inertia," they stated.
They criticized Americans for maintaining a
"conservation ethic" for gasoline, while having no qualms
about wasting food.
"Americans as a nation consume two times more calories
than our bodies need to function well, and four times more
meat protein than our bodies can utilize," they noted.
Immediate Famine Relief
About 30 percent of the funds collected nationally will
be used for immediate famine relief, according to Columbae
resident Jane Stoner.
A spokesman for Oxfam-America said that, by not
eating, Americans will be adding to global food reserves,
symbolically if not substantially.
She emphasized that one aim of the program is "to get
Americans conscious of what it's like to be hungry, to
identify will the starving millions."
Dozens of Stanford students and 200,000 other
Americans concerned about the world's starving millions
will participate today in a day-long fast.
Residents of Columbae House agreed to consume only
water, fruit juices, coffee, tea and broth for the entire day,
and have urged other students to join them.
