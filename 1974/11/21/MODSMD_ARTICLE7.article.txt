In reply to Arvin Levine's
letter concerning our advertising
policy, I would like to make a few
points. We are a non-profit
student organization serving the
Stanford community. But at the
same time we do compete with
other travel and charter
organizations, and must, like
them, advertise our services to
remain in business.
In advertising our rates on a
comparative basis, we have not
used other charter rates or special
discount fares on commercial
airlines. Rather, we have used the
standard economy class
commercial fare. I do not believe
that this policy has been
misleading, but to prevent any
future misunderstandings we will
clearly note the precise name for
commercial rates used in price
comparisons. Where our flight
times correspond with available
"night coach" depature times, we
will use that rate in our
comparisons.

Caption 'ln Poor Taste'
Editor:
The caption under Shirley
Schoof's picture (Daily sports
page, Nov. 18) was done in very
poor taste. The picture showed
Schoof giving some advice to a
hockey player during a recent
game. Although the first line of
the caption concerned hockey,
the rest of it dealt with basketball.
It stated that Schoof has often
been "criticized as a poor
basketball mentor" and that she
"reportedly will not coach the
women's cage team this year."
The picture alone would have
made a nice addition to the
hockey article that appeared along
side of it. But instead of leaving
well enough alone, a caption was
added that served no purpose
except to degrade Schoof's ability
as a coach. How does "being a
poor basketball mentor" relate to
the hockey team?
If Schoof is not going to teach
the women's cage team this year, I
think that a full expalanation of
the events surrounding this change
is in order. Schoof has coached
the basketball team for the past
three years. She deserves better
than a one-line rumored send-off.
I don't know who is
responsible for the pointless and
degrading caption, but I think
that the person involved owes
Daily readers an explanation and
owes Schoof a personal apology.

Campus Safety Measures
Editor:
Thus far, 35 members of the
Stanford community have signed
petitions sent to the President's
Office demanding that Stanford
take some action to protect
members of the community from
physical attack.
Some 24 of these signatures
represented people living off
campus. To some people it may
seem that Stanford hasn't
responded to the tragic events of
the past several weeks. Actually,
this is not the case. There have
been several ad hoc meetings
called by Dale Snape, assistant
dean of student affairs, which
included students and University
officials most concerned or
knowlegeable about these matters.
Out of these meetings emerged
a need for circulating security

precautions for all the campus
community stressing methods of
prevention. This is in the works.
Also a press conference was held
to alert people to the availability
of fire alarms as away of calling
for help in case of danger or
attack.
It is important for each person
to take the responsibility for
locating such a fire alarm and
educating himself in general about
what he can do to insure his own
safety.
There will be a continuous
showing of the movie Nobody's
Victim at a time to be announced.
Also, work is being done on trying
to establish a "buddy" or escort
service for people who, for special
reasons, need to be out late at
night.
The main point I'd like to
stress is that this is a mutual
problem. We are all apprehensive
and concerned and want
guarantees for our personal safety.
However, University faculty, staff
and students each must take on
some of the burden of increasing
safety for all.

Other Dangers Noted
Editor:
Some less publicized dangers to
students in dorms deserve a short
note. Males have been found
hiding in some women's
bathrooms. Periodically strangers
will case out a dorm by knocking
on doors and then trying to turn
the knob if there is no answer.
Many attempted assaults go
unprinted.
We do not want to create
undue apprehension but we do
encourage that any suspicious
actions be promptly reported to
the police, and that people be
more scrupulous in locking their
doors.
Also, the Daily can be used as a
method for alerting people to the
problems they encounter. Don't
let apathy enhance the desirability
of dorms as "easy hits" for con
men, voyeurs, assailants and
burglars.

Call For Rain
Editor:
Since the bulk of the ASSU
Senate has felt itself unqualified
to condemn the bonfire, there can
be no peaceful way of stopping it,
other then rain itself. After all, it
is nature we are abusing; perhaps
it will be nature that will still the
small pageants of men.
It seems that now only Mother
Nature herself can. stop the
bonfire. Therefore, it is only
fitting that those of us in the
Stanford community who feel
that a bonfire isn't the best way
to have a good time, who feel that
it isn't the best way to spend
$750 and who feel that the open
air isn't the best place to put four
tons of ash, ask Mother Nature for
her help in preventing the violent
destruction of her trees and her
oil.
To this end there will be at
noon in White Plaza this Friday a
celebration of life and call for
rain. Bring your love, bring your
wine, bring your musical
instruments, bring yourselves.
If you are interested in helping
please contact Columbae House.
In the event of rain before
Friday noon there will be a
victory dance instead.

made a nice addition to the
hockey article that appeared along
side of it. But instead of leaving
well enough alone, a caption was
added that served no purpose
except to degrade Schoof's ability
as a coach. How does "being a
poor basketball mentor" relate to
the hockey team?
If Schoof is not going to teach
the women's cage team this year, I
think that a full expalanation of
the events surrounding this change
is in order. Schoof has coached
the basketball team for the past
three years. She deserves better
than a one-line rumored send-off.
I don't know who is
responsible for the pointless and
degrading caption, but I think
that the person involved owes
Daily readers an explanation and
owes Schoof a personal apology.

Campus Safety Measures
Editor:
Thus far, 35 members of the
Stanford community have signed
petitions sent to the President's
Office demanding that Stanford
take some action to protect
members of the community from
physical attack.
Some 24 of these signatures
represented people living off
campus. To some people it may
seem that Stanford hasn't
responded to the tragic events of
the past several weeks. Actually,
this is not the case. There have
been several ad hoc meetings
called by Dale Snape, assistant
dean of student affairs, which
included students and University
officials most concerned or
knowlegeable about these matters.
Out of these meetings emerged
a need for circulating security

precautions for all the campus
community stressing methods of
prevention. This is in the works.
Also a press conference was held
to alert people to the availability
of fire alarms as away of calling
for help in case of danger or
attack.
It is important for each person
to take the responsibility for
locating such a fire alarm and
educating himself in general about
what he can do to insure his own
safety.
There will be a continuous
showing of the movie Nobody's
Victim at a time to be announced.
Also, work is being done on trying
to establish a "buddy" or escort
service for people who, for special
reasons, need to be out late at
night.
The main point I'd like to
stress is that this is a mutual
problem. We are all apprehensive
and concerned and want
guarantees for our personal safety.
However, University faculty, staff
and students each must take on
some of the burden of increasing
safety for all.

Other Dangers Noted
Editor:
Some less publicized dangers to
students in dorms deserve a short
note. Males have been found
hiding in some women's
bathrooms. Periodically strangers
will case out a dorm by knocking
on doors and then trying to turn
the knob if there is no answer.
Many attempted assaults go
unprinted.
We do not want to create
undue apprehension but we do
encourage that any suspicious
actions be promptly reported to
the police, and that people be
more scrupulous in locking their
doors.
Also, the Daily can be used as a
method for alerting people to the
problems they encounter. Don't
let apathy enhance the desirability
of dorms as "easy hits" for con
men, voyeurs, assailants and
burglars.

Call For Rain
Editor:
Since the bulk of the ASSU
Senate has felt itself unqualified
to condemn the bonfire, there can
be no peaceful way of stopping it,
other then rain itself. After all, it
is nature we are abusing; perhaps
it will be nature that will still the
small pageants of men.
It seems that now only Mother
Nature herself can. stop the
bonfire. Therefore, it is only
fitting that those of us in the
Stanford community who feel
that a bonfire isn't the best way
to have a good time, who feel that
it isn't the best way to spend
$750 and who feel that the open
air isn't the best place to put four
tons of ash, ask Mother Nature for
her help in preventing the violent
destruction of her trees and her
oil.
To this end there will be at
noon in White Plaza this Friday a
celebration of life and call for
rain. Bring your love, bring your
wine, bring your musical
instruments, bring yourselves.

In reply to Arvin Levine's
letter concerning our advertising
policy, I would like to make a few
points. We are a non-profit
student organization serving the
Stanford community. But at the
same time we do compete with
other travel and charter
organizations, and must, like
them, advertise our services to
remain in business.
In advertising our rates on a
comparative basis, we have not
used other charter rates or special
discount fares on commercial
airlines. Rather, we have used the
standard economy class
commercial fare. I do not believe
that this policy has been
misleading, but to prevent any
future misunderstandings we will
clearly note the precise name for
commercial rates used in price
comparisons. Where our flight
times correspond with available
"night coach" depature times, we
will use that rate in our

Out of these meetings emerged
a need for circulating security

precautions for all the campus
community stressing methods of
prevention. This is in the works.
Also a press conference was held
to alert people to the availability
of fire alarms as away of calling
for help in case of danger or
attack.
It is important for each person
to take the responsibility for
locating such a fire alarm and
educating himself in general about
what he can do to insure his own
safety.
There will be a continuous
showing of the movie Nobody's
Victim at a time to be announced.
Also, work is being done on trying
to establish a "buddy" or escort
service for people who, for special
reasons, need to be out late at
night.
The main point I'd like to
stress is that this is a mutual
problem. We are all apprehensive
and concerned and want
guarantees for our personal safety.
However, University faculty, staff
and students each must take on
some of the burden of increasing
safety for all.

Other Dangers Noted
Editor:
Some less publicized dangers to
students in dorms deserve a short
note. Males have been found
hiding in some women's
bathrooms. Periodically strangers
will case out a dorm by knocking
on doors and then trying to turn
the knob if there is no answer.
Many attempted assaults go
unprinted.
We do not want to create
undue apprehension but we do
encourage that any suspicious
actions be promptly reported to
the police, and that people be
more scrupulous in locking their
doors.
Also, the Daily can be used as a
method for alerting people to the
problems they encounter. Don't
let apathy enhance the desirability
of dorms as "easy hits" for con
men, voyeurs, assailants and
burglars.

Call For Rain
Editor:
Since the bulk of the ASSU
Senate has felt itself unqualified
to condemn the bonfire, there can
be no peaceful way of stopping it,
other then rain itself. After all, it
is nature we are abusing; perhaps
it will be nature that will still the
small pageants of men.
It seems that now only Mother
Nature herself can. stop the
bonfire. Therefore, it is only
fitting that those of us in the
Stanford community who feel
that a bonfire isn't the best way
to have a good time, who feel that
it isn't the best way to spend
$750 and who feel that the open
air isn't the best place to put four
tons of ash, ask Mother Nature for
her help in preventing the violent
destruction of her trees and her
oil.
To this end there will be at
noon in White Plaza this Friday a
celebration of life and call for
rain. Bring your love, bring your
wine, bring your musical
instruments, bring yourselves.
If you are interested in helping
please contact Columbae House.
In the event of rain before
Friday noon there will be a
victory dance instead.

In reply to Arvin Levine's
letter concerning our advertising
policy, I would like to make a few
points. We are a non-profit
student organization serving the
Stanford community. But at the
same time we do compete with
other travel and charter
organizations, and must, like
them, advertise our services to
remain in business.
In advertising our rates on a
comparative basis, we have not
used other charter rates or special
discount fares on commercial
airlines. Rather, we have used the
standard economy class
commercial fare. I do not believe
that this policy has been
misleading, but to prevent any
future misunderstandings we will
clearly note the precise name for
commercial rates used in price
comparisons. Where our flight
times correspond with available
"night coach" depature times, we
will use that rate in our
comparisons.

Caption 'ln Poor Taste'
Editor:
The caption under Shirley
Schoof's picture (Daily sports
page, Nov. 18) was done in very
poor taste. The picture showed
Schoof giving some advice to a
hockey player during a recent
game. Although the first line of
the caption concerned hockey,
the rest of it dealt with basketball.
It stated that Schoof has often
been "criticized as a poor
basketball mentor" and that she
"reportedly will not coach the
women's cage team this year."
The picture alone would have
made a nice addition to the
hockey article that appeared along
side of it. But instead of leaving
well enough alone, a caption was
added that served no purpose
except to degrade Schoof's ability
as a coach. How does "being a
poor basketball mentor" relate to
the hockey team?
If Schoof is not going to teach
the women's cage team this year, I
think that a full expalanation of
the events surrounding this change
is in order. Schoof has coached
the basketball team for the past
three years. She deserves better
than a one-line rumored send-off.
I don't know who is
responsible for the pointless and
degrading caption, but I think
that the person involved owes
Daily readers an explanation and
owes Schoof a personal apology.

Thus far, 35 members of the

take some action to protect

responded to the tragic events of
the past several weeks. Actually,
this is not the case. There have
