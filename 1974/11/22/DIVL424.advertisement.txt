PLO:
Will Their Plan Bring Peace
to The Middle East?
THE PLO APPROACH TO PEACE
DENIES THE RIGHTS OF ISRAELI JEWS
Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization's purported goals
for the Middle East are peace, justice, and equality. Arafat told the United
Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, November 13, 1974: "Let us work
together (to establish) one democratic state where Christian, Jew, and Moslem
live in justice, equality, and fraternity." The creation of this new "democratic
state," however, would necessitate that the PLO destroy Israel. The
Palestinian National Covenant, commonly regarded as the authoritative
statement of PLO goals, declares that "the establishment of Israel is null and
void." And in an interview for the New Republic magazine (November 16),
Arafat stated: "The goal of our struggle is the end of Israel, and there can be no
compromises or mediation."
Moreover, the only Jews whom the PLO would allow in a new Palestinian
state would be the Jews of present-day Israel who are descended from the 20,000
Jews who lived in Palestine prior to 1881. The Palestinian National Covenant
recognizes as future inhabitants of a new Palestine only those Jews in Palestine
"before the Zionist invasion." And Arafat made a great point of telling the
United Nations: "The Jewish invasion of Palestine began in 1881. Before the
first large wave of immigrants started arriving, Palestine had a population of
half a million; most of the population was either Moslem or Christian, and only
20,000 were Jewish."
This approach to the Middle East problem would only grant the Palestinian
people a nation, while denying the Jewish people—and other non-Arab peoples
as well —their right to existence in the Middle East.
WE RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMATE
RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
TO A STATE
The Palestinian people view themselves as a national entity, and therefore
have a legitimate right to a state of their own. They believe that life in a
country—lsrael —with a majority culture not their own —Jewish —is unac
ceptable. This belief is understandable: non-whites and non-Protestants in
America also face the various problems inherent for life in a culture where they
are in the minority. For this reason, we respect the desire of the Palestinian
people to a state of their own.
THERE ARE POSSIBLE APPROACHES
TO PEACE
The PLO regards Zionism and Zionists to be its enemies, and claims peace
will come only to the Middle East if they are eliminated. Arafat stated at the
UN: "Destitute, oppressed Jews (were) employed on behalf of world im
perialism and of the Zionist leadership. European Jews were transformed into
the instruments of aggression." Accordingly, those "destitute" Jews—who
came in part as refugees from the Arab countries—who were used as "in
struments" of Zionism, and whose descendants now occupy Israel and en
courage other Jews to emigrate to Israel, are enemies of the PLO and would be
excluded from its proposed Palestinian state. Therefore, such a Palestinian
state would create two-and-a-half million Jewish refugees: those Jews living in
Israel not descended from the 20,000 who lived there prior to 1881.
Furthermore, it is very unlikely that a new Palestinian state could achieve
the degree of secularism implied by Arafat's remarks. Secular states are,
indeed, a rarity in the Middle East. For example, according to their con
stitutions, both Egypt and Syria are Moslem states. When the PLO discusses a
"democratic secular state," they envision a state that is meant to be an in
tegral, inseparable part of Arab culture and society, and that any non-Moslem,
non-Arab residents will be allowed only that modicum of freedom of self
expression available within the limits imposed by a pervasively Arab society.
As the Palestine National Council, which met in Cairo last June, declared:
"The Palestine national entity, after it comes into existence, will struggle to
achieve a federation of confrontation states in order'to complete the liberation
of the entire Palestinian soil and as a step on the road to complete Arab unity."
We believe that there is a viable resolution to the Middle East problem, which
could involve either separate states, or a federation of both Palestinians and
Jews. However, any plan which fails to establish and preserve the political
integrity of both groups would in turn fail to provide a just and lasting peace.
TERRORISM IS NOT AN APPROACH
In his interview for the New Republic, Arafat declared: "We don't want
peace, we want victory. Peace for us means Israel's destruction and nothing
else." But neither the attempted destruction of Israel nor terrorism will
provide a solution to the Middle East problem. Denying the Jews' rights will
solve nothing, nor will indiscriminate killing: Israeli athletes at the Olympic
games in Munich, Israel schoolchildren at Maalot, five Israeli citizens just this
last Monday at Beit Shean. And this is why the PLO plan for peace in the Middle
East will not work.
In Conclusion, the secular democratic state that Arafat and the PLO would
establish in Palestine would destroy Israel and exclude 2.5 million of its Jews.
Though we recognize the rights of the Palestinian people, we dispute the PLO's
power to supplant the rights of the Jewish people. It is our hope that in freedom
the people of Israel shall live now and forever.

As the Palestine National Council, which met in Cairo last June, declared:
"The Palestine national entity, after it comes into existence, will struggle to
achieve a federation of confrontation states in order'to complete the liberation
of the entire Palestinian soil and as a step on the road to complete Arab unity."
We believe that there is a viable resolution to the Middle East problem, which
could involve either separate states, or a federation of both Palestinians and
Jews. However, any plan which fails to establish and preserve the political
integrity of both groups would in turn fail to provide a just and lasting peace.
TERRORISM IS NOT AN APPROACH
In his interview for the New Republic, Arafat declared: "We don't want
peace, we want victory. Peace for us means Israel's destruction and nothing
else." But neither the attempted destruction of Israel nor terrorism will
provide a solution to the Middle East problem. Denying the Jews' rights will
solve nothing, nor will indiscriminate killing: Israeli athletes at the Olympic
games in Munich, Israel schoolchildren at Maalot, five Israeli citizens just this
last Monday at Beit Shean. And this is why the PLO plan for peace in the Middle
East will not work.
In Conclusion, the secular democratic state that Arafat and the PLO would
establish in Palestine would destroy Israel and exclude 2.5 million of its Jews.
Though we recognize the rights of the Palestinian people, we dispute the PLO's
power to supplant the rights of the Jewish people. It is our hope that in freedom
the people of Israel shall live now and forever.

PLO:
Will Their Plan Bring Peace
to The Middle East?
THE PLO APPROACH TO PEACE
DENIES THE RIGHTS OF ISRAELI JEWS
Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization's purported goals
for the Middle East are peace, justice, and equality. Arafat told the United
Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, November 13, 1974: "Let us work
together (to establish) one democratic state where Christian, Jew, and Moslem
live in justice, equality, and fraternity." The creation of this new "democratic
state," however, would necessitate that the PLO destroy Israel. The
Palestinian National Covenant, commonly regarded as the authoritative
statement of PLO goals, declares that "the establishment of Israel is null and
void." And in an interview for the New Republic magazine (November 16),
Arafat stated: "The goal of our struggle is the end of Israel, and there can be no
compromises or mediation."
Moreover, the only Jews whom the PLO would allow in a new Palestinian
state would be the Jews of present-day Israel who are descended from the 20,000
Jews who lived in Palestine prior to 1881. The Palestinian National Covenant
recognizes as future inhabitants of a new Palestine only those Jews in Palestine
"before the Zionist invasion." And Arafat made a great point of telling the
United Nations: "The Jewish invasion of Palestine began in 1881. Before the
first large wave of immigrants started arriving, Palestine had a population of
half a million; most of the population was either Moslem or Christian, and only
20,000 were Jewish."
This approach to the Middle East problem would only grant the Palestinian
people a nation, while denying the Jewish people—and other non-Arab peoples
as well —their right to existence in the Middle East.
WE RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMATE
RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
TO A STATE
The Palestinian people view themselves as a national entity, and therefore
have a legitimate right to a state of their own. They believe that life in a
country—lsrael —with a majority culture not their own —Jewish —is unac
ceptable. This belief is understandable: non-whites and non-Protestants in
America also face the various problems inherent for life in a culture where they
are in the minority. For this reason, we respect the desire of the Palestinian
people to a state of their own.
THERE ARE POSSIBLE APPROACHES
TO PEACE
The PLO regards Zionism and Zionists to be its enemies, and claims peace
will come only to the Middle East if they are eliminated. Arafat stated at the
UN: "Destitute, oppressed Jews (were) employed on behalf of world im
perialism and of the Zionist leadership. European Jews were transformed into
the instruments of aggression." Accordingly, those "destitute" Jews—who
came in part as refugees from the Arab countries—who were used as "in
struments" of Zionism, and whose descendants now occupy Israel and en
courage other Jews to emigrate to Israel, are enemies of the PLO and would be
excluded from its proposed Palestinian state. Therefore, such a Palestinian
state would create two-and-a-half million Jewish refugees: those Jews living in
Israel not descended from the 20,000 who lived there prior to 1881.
Furthermore, it is very unlikely that a new Palestinian state could achieve
the degree of secularism implied by Arafat's remarks. Secular states are,
indeed, a rarity in the Middle East. For example, according to their con
stitutions, both Egypt and Syria are Moslem states. When the PLO discusses a
"democratic secular state," they envision a state that is meant to be an in
tegral, inseparable part of Arab culture and society, and that any non-Moslem,
non-Arab residents will be allowed only that modicum of freedom of self
expression available within the limits imposed by a pervasively Arab society.
As the Palestine National Council, which met in Cairo last June, declared:
"The Palestine national entity, after it comes into existence, will struggle to
achieve a federation of confrontation states in order'to complete the liberation
of the entire Palestinian soil and as a step on the road to complete Arab unity."

This approach to the Middle East problem would only grant the Palestinian
people a nation, while denying the Jewish people—and other non-Arab peoples
as well —their right to existence in the Middle East.
WE RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMATE
RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE
TO A STATE
The Palestinian people view themselves as a national entity, and therefore
have a legitimate right to a state of their own. They believe that life in a
country—lsrael —with a majority culture not their own —Jewish —is unac
ceptable. This belief is understandable: non-whites and non-Protestants in
America also face the various problems inherent for life in a culture where they
are in the minority. For this reason, we respect the desire of the Palestinian
people to a state of their own.
THERE ARE POSSIBLE APPROACHES
TO PEACE
The PLO regards Zionism and Zionists to be its enemies, and claims peace
will come only to the Middle East if they are eliminated. Arafat stated at the
UN: "Destitute, oppressed Jews (were) employed on behalf of world im
perialism and of the Zionist leadership. European Jews were transformed into
the instruments of aggression." Accordingly, those "destitute" Jews—who
came in part as refugees from the Arab countries—who were used as "in
struments" of Zionism, and whose descendants now occupy Israel and en
courage other Jews to emigrate to Israel, are enemies of the PLO and would be
excluded from its proposed Palestinian state. Therefore, such a Palestinian
state would create two-and-a-half million Jewish refugees: those Jews living in
Israel not descended from the 20,000 who lived there prior to 1881.
Furthermore, it is very unlikely that a new Palestinian state could achieve
the degree of secularism implied by Arafat's remarks. Secular states are,
indeed, a rarity in the Middle East. For example, according to their con
stitutions, both Egypt and Syria are Moslem states. When the PLO discusses a
"democratic secular state," they envision a state that is meant to be an in
tegral, inseparable part of Arab culture and society, and that any non-Moslem,
non-Arab residents will be allowed only that modicum of freedom of self
expression available within the limits imposed by a pervasively Arab society.
As the Palestine National Council, which met in Cairo last June, declared:
"The Palestine national entity, after it comes into existence, will struggle to
achieve a federation of confrontation states in order'to complete the liberation
of the entire Palestinian soil and as a step on the road to complete Arab unity."
We believe that there is a viable resolution to the Middle East problem, which
could involve either separate states, or a federation of both Palestinians and
Jews. However, any plan which fails to establish and preserve the political
integrity of both groups would in turn fail to provide a just and lasting peace.
TERRORISM IS NOT AN APPROACH
In his interview for the New Republic, Arafat declared: "We don't want
peace, we want victory. Peace for us means Israel's destruction and nothing
else." But neither the attempted destruction of Israel nor terrorism will
provide a solution to the Middle East problem. Denying the Jews' rights will
solve nothing, nor will indiscriminate killing: Israeli athletes at the Olympic
games in Munich, Israel schoolchildren at Maalot, five Israeli citizens just this
last Monday at Beit Shean. And this is why the PLO plan for peace in the Middle
East will not work.
In Conclusion, the secular democratic state that Arafat and the PLO would
establish in Palestine would destroy Israel and exclude 2.5 million of its Jews.
Though we recognize the rights of the Palestinian people, we dispute the PLO's
power to supplant the rights of the Jewish people. It is our hope that in freedom
the people of Israel shall live now and forever.

PLO:
Will Their Plan Bring Peace
to The Middle East?
THE PLO APPROACH TO PEACE
DENIES THE RIGHTS OF ISRAELI JEWS
Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization's purported goals
for the Middle East are peace, justice, and equality. Arafat told the United
Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, November 13, 1974: "Let us work
together (to establish) one democratic state where Christian, Jew, and Moslem
live in justice, equality, and fraternity." The creation of this new "democratic
state," however, would necessitate that the PLO destroy Israel. The
Palestinian National Covenant, commonly regarded as the authoritative
statement of PLO goals, declares that "the establishment of Israel is null and
void." And in an interview for the New Republic magazine (November 16),
Arafat stated: "The goal of our struggle is the end of Israel, and there can be no
compromises or mediation."
Moreover, the only Jews whom the PLO would allow in a new Palestinian
state would be the Jews of present-day Israel who are descended from the 20,000
Jews who lived in Palestine prior to 1881. The Palestinian National Covenant
recognizes as future inhabitants of a new Palestine only those Jews in Palestine
"before the Zionist invasion." And Arafat made a great point of telling the
United Nations: "The Jewish invasion of Palestine began in 1881. Before the
first large wave of immigrants started arriving, Palestine had a population of
half a million; most of the population was either Moslem or Christian, and only
20,000 were Jewish."
This approach to the Middle East problem would only grant the Palestinian
people a nation, while denying the Jewish people—and other non-Arab peoples
as well —their right to existence in the Middle East.
