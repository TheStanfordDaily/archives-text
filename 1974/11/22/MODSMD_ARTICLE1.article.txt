# Second 'Psi' Particle Discovered At SLAC
## 
### DON COX 
A team of physicists at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) announced yesterday the
discovery of a second member of an
apparently new unpredicated family of
subatomic particles with unusual
properties.
The new particle, called psi (3700),
was discovered in a systematic search
for such particles following the
accidental discovery of the first
particle, psi (3105), 12 days ago.
SLAC Prof. Burton Richter, head
of the team of SLAC and Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) physicists,
said the new particle demonstrated the
"same large mass and long lifetime"
qnd neutral charge as the first particle.
Psi (3700) has a mass roughly four
times that of a proton while psi (3105)
was about three times as large as the
proton, he said.
Richter said the existence of the
second particle "wasn't predictable,
we couldn't tell if there were more.
But the experiment that gave us the
indications of the existence of the first
particle gave suggestions that there
might be more," he said.
Five Times?
"Is there going to be pne at five
times the mass of a proton? I can only
say we're going to look for it," Richter
said.
Richter said the search for a
possible third member of the family
was scheduled to begin last night after
some equipment was adjusted.
The particles were discovered in
experiments at SLAC in which
electrons and positrons collided in the
SPEAR storage ring. The psi particles
emerged out of the small fireball
resulting from the collision of the
electrons and positrons matter and
anti-matter.
A team of MIT physicists at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory
(BNL) in New York discovered the
first particle at the same time the
SLAC team found it. The BNL team
fired protons at protons and observed
the production of the PSI (3105), or
the "J" particle as they called it,
resulting from the collision.

Richter said he tried to contact the
BNL group yesterday to see if it had
evidence of the second particle, but he
was unable to reach MIT Prof. Samuel
Ting, head of the BNL team.
Richter said it was possible the
second particle might be harder to
spot using the method the BNL team
was employing to look for the
particles.
Theoretical physicists at SLAC,
already at a loss to explain the first
particle, struggled to develop a theory
to explain the presence and unusual
properties of the new family of
particles. SLAC Deputy Director
Sidney Drell said.
"The theoretical physics
community is struggling with a very
difficult situation here. We don't have
any simple explanation," he said.
Unsurprising
Drell said he was not particilarly
surprised by the discovery of the
second particle.
While in the past, theorists have
usually predicted the existence of a
new particle long before the
experimentalists actually discover it,
the situation has been spectacularly
reversed by the find of the two psi

particles.
"Any honest theorist will tell you
that the experimentalists have been
ahead of us for quite a while," said
Drell.
The second particle was found early
yesterday morning at an energy of 37
billion electron volts.
This lifetime is about 10,000 times
longer than a particle of that mass
would be expected to last under old
theories. The remarkably long lifetime
indicates that the particles must have
some novel, as yet not understood
properties, which prevent it from
decaying in the much shorter time
expected from a conventional particle.
SLAC Prof. Martin Perl also headed
the SLAC team working on the project
while the LBL team was led by LBL
Profs. Gerson Goldhaber and George
H. Trilling.

Richter said he tried to contact the
BNL group yesterday to see if it had
evidence of the second particle, but he
was unable to reach MIT Prof. Samuel
Ting, head of the BNL team.
Richter said it was possible the
second particle might be harder to
spot using the method the BNL team
was employing to look for the
particles.
Theoretical physicists at SLAC,
already at a loss to explain the first
particle, struggled to develop a theory
to explain the presence and unusual
properties of the new family of
particles. SLAC Deputy Director
Sidney Drell said.
"The theoretical physics
community is struggling with a very
difficult situation here. We don't have
any simple explanation," he said.
Unsurprising
Drell said he was not particilarly
surprised by the discovery of the
second particle.
While in the past, theorists have
usually predicted the existence of a
new particle long before the
experimentalists actually discover it,
the situation has been spectacularly
reversed by the find of the two psi

particles.
"Any honest theorist will tell you
that the experimentalists have been
ahead of us for quite a while," said
Drell.
The second particle was found early
yesterday morning at an energy of 37
billion electron volts.
This lifetime is about 10,000 times
longer than a particle of that mass
would be expected to last under old
theories. The remarkably long lifetime
indicates that the particles must have
some novel, as yet not understood
properties, which prevent it from
decaying in the much shorter time
expected from a conventional particle.

A team of physicists at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) announced yesterday the
discovery of a second member of an
apparently new unpredicated family of
subatomic particles with unusual
properties.
The new particle, called psi (3700),
was discovered in a systematic search
for such particles following the
accidental discovery of the first
particle, psi (3105), 12 days ago.
SLAC Prof. Burton Richter, head
of the team of SLAC and Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) physicists,
said the new particle demonstrated the
"same large mass and long lifetime"
qnd neutral charge as the first particle.
Psi (3700) has a mass roughly four
times that of a proton while psi (3105)
was about three times as large as the
proton, he said.
Richter said the existence of the
second particle "wasn't predictable,
we couldn't tell if there were more.
But the experiment that gave us the
indications of the existence of the first
particle gave suggestions that there
might be more," he said.
Five Times?
"Is there going to be pne at five
times the mass of a proton? I can only
say we're going to look for it," Richter
said.
Richter said the search for a
possible third member of the family
was scheduled to begin last night after
some equipment was adjusted.
The particles were discovered in
experiments at SLAC in which
electrons and positrons collided in the
SPEAR storage ring. The psi particles
emerged out of the small fireball
resulting from the collision of the
electrons and positrons matter and
anti-matter.
A team of MIT physicists at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory
(BNL) in New York discovered the
first particle at the same time the
SLAC team found it. The BNL team
fired protons at protons and observed
the production of the PSI (3105), or
the "J" particle as they called it,
resulting from the collision.
