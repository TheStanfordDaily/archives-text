# Obscenity Rulings, Firearm Control
## 
### 
Doily Kansan
In June 1973, the Supreme Court
attempted to extricate itself from its position
as the nation's chief censorship board when it
ruled in Miller vs. California that local, not
national, standards would prevail in deciding
obscenity cases. The 'Miller decision,
however, has only deepened the Court's
position in the morass of case-by-case
determinations of obscenity decisions.
One fault in the Miller ruling is the Court's
failure to define properly the term
"community" when it held that community
standards would prevail.
The Court stated: "It is neither realistic
nor constitutionally sdund to read the First
Amendment as requiring the people of Maine
or Mississippi accept public depiction of
conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas or New
York City. . ."
Here, the Court refers to community first
as applying to a state and then as to a city.
As a result of this ambiguity, judges,
legislators and law enforcement officials
often are left in a quandary as to who is
responsible for obscenity standards in their
locale.
Constitutional Definition
In Miller, the Court also attempted to
refine the constitutional definition of
obscenity. The earlier ruling of Memoirs vs.
Massachusetts that a film, magazine or book
was protected by the First Amendment if it
had redeeming social value, was trimmed by
the Miller decision. Now, material under
question must have specific literary, artistic,
political or scientific value. The problem that
makes this definition futile is that courts are
unable to concur on the intended meaning of
the qualitative values listed above.
It was only two weeks after the Miller
decision that a jury in Albany, Ga., convicted
a theater owner for showing the

award-winning film Carnal Knowledge.
When the case finally reached the
Supreme Court in June 1974, the conviction
was overturned. The Court held that "it
would be a serious misreading of Miller to
conclude that juries.have unbridled discretion
in determining what is 'patently offensive.' "
Thus, the Court held a reserved right to
overrule any standards it deemed
unreasonable.
'lnto The Mire'
Justice Brennan's separate opinion in the
Carnal Knowledge case that "the court has
fallen into the mire of case-by-case
determinations" has proven accurate. The
Court is faced with at least three obscenity
cases during its present term.
The adage that it is impossible to legislate
morals seems to be an absolute in the realm
of obscenity legislation. Since the Hicklin
rule of 1879, the landmark Roth decision of
1957 and Miller of 1973, the Court has
wasted precious time perusing filthy
literature and, more recently, viewing
hard-core pornographic films. Regardless of
the court's noble attempts to keep smut from
Americans, obscene books, movies and plays
permeate our society.
The only reasonable obscenity law that
the Court could make would be one
containing these two provisions: prohibition
of obscene material from minors and
prohibition of obtrusive exposure of obscene
material on an unwilling public. Courts of all
jurisdictional levels would be able to apply
these standards effectively without having to
delve into matters of arbitration and
constitutional definitions of obscenity.
Until such a ruling is made, the court will,
without a question, maintain its position as
the nation's chief censorship board.

The Treasury Department recently

announced a program for cracking down on
the illegal use of guns and explosives which
seems to have an inherent potential for
abuse.
The program, called "Significant Criminal
Enforcement Program Armed and
Dangerous," is to be run by the department's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
The intent of the plan is to systematically
identify and prosecute the most violent and
dangerous criminals who use firearms and
explosives. Included in the list are contract
killers, organized crime members, terrorists
and dealers in stolen guns and explosives.
The danger lies in who the bureau defines
and Identifies as a "terrorist." Many left-wing
political groups are marked for arrest under
the existing gun control and explosives act,
and the result could be the violation of the
groups' First Amendment rights of freedom
of expression.
We do not suggest that the investigation of
clearly illegal activities by revolutionary
groups is unconstitutional. Rather, since lists
compiled under the program are secret, only
bureaucratic controls prevent the use of the
new program for harassment of political
dissidents.
The Significant Criminal Enforcement
Program or something similar is clearly
necessary, in light of the increasingly violent
criminal activity occurring in many cities.
However, officials directly responsible to the
public must be included in the regulation of
the plan. A congressional watchdog
committee similar to the one which now
oversees the operations of the Central
Intelligence Agency might be a good
solution, as long as the committee would
regulate rather than passively condone
whatever the Treasury Department decides to
do.
