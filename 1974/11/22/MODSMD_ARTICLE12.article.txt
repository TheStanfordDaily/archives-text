# Fallacies About The Middle East
## 
### M.S. Redjeb 
I would like to call your
attention to a problem that has
always bothered me whenever I
engage in or overhear a discussion
about the Middle East.
It seems that many Americans
find it hard to express their
honest opinion about the
situation there without taking the
risk of being labeled
"anti-Semitic," "racist " or at
best, "unfair." The problem, I
believe, stems from some
fallacious arguments that were
advanced by Zionist propaganda
and are now commonly accepted
here in the U.S.
The first of these arguments
says that anybody who speaks out
against the policy of Israel is to be
considered "anti-Semitic." This is
why, for example, when Sen. J.
William Fulbright (D-Ark.) stated
that Israel is exerting excessive
influence on American foreign
policy, he was called
"anti-Semitic." This paranoia is
carried to the extent that when
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.)
voted against the nomination of
Henry Kissinger (who happens to
be of the Jewish faith) to
secretary of state, many people
called him "anti-Semitic."
The latest example is the case
of Gen. George Brown, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, wno spoke out against
Jewish influence on American
policy. Brown advanced some
refutable statements that anybody
could disprove by studying the
facts. Yet instead of trying to
refute his statements, the Jewish
lobby, as usual, used the weapon
of "anti-Semitism" and forced
Brown to apologize publicly.
I believe that this intimidation

of government officials as well as
of the American public is a
dangerous course because it
simply prevents freedom of
opinion, hinders people from
discussing the real issues and does
not serve the cause of peace. The
truth is: anti-Israel simply is not
the equivalent of Anti-Semitic.
(One might note additionally that
the Arabs are also Semites.)
The second argument concerns
the slogan "Never Again!"
Here I must confess that I do
not understand what is meant by
this slogan. If it is used to oppose
Nazism and racism, the point is

well taken. But to cheer for
Zionism and shout "Never
Again!" is out of context. The
wrong doings of the Nazis does
not in anyway give the Zionists a
justification to abuse the
Palestinians who are themselves
victims rather than oppressors.
The third argument is the
pretention that the creation of a
Palestinian state is a threat to
Israel. Let me here remind those
who have not followed the
development of events in the
Middle East that Israel has so far
won four wars in the Middle East
(although the outcome of the

fourth is not clear); it is
occupying beside the Palestinian
land, the lands of three countries,
Egypt, Jordan and Syria; and it is
waging war against Lebanon. In
the light of these facts how can
one say that the creation of a
Palestinian state with less than
three million people is a threat to
Israel?
I believe the time has come to
reject these fallacies and these
complexes and start discussing the
issues in their proper contexts.
