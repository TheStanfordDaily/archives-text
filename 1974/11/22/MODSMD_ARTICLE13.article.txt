# On Experiential' Education
## 
### Ross Miller 
This quarter two classes were offered in the
Undergraduate Specials (UES) program, Altering
States of Consciousness and Parapsychology and
Psychic Phenomena. Both of these classes were in ,
great demand by the student body and the
community in general.
Several on-campus-off-campus rapports were
established. In fact, Altering States of
Consciousness had to open a second section. In
most classes at this University, the attendance
probably decreases as the quarter progresses. In
these classes in the UGS program, the attendance
increases, as people bring more and more friends to
get involved.
Now, the University has decided that three
classes are not "academic" enough. They have
decided definitely not to approve the continuation
course of the idealized 3-quarter sequence, a class
to be called "Inner Visions." Despite the fact that
these classes are listed in the Time Schedule for
winter quarter, the two others may not be
approved to be taught again next quarter.
Their acceptance with the University depends on

the quality of the term projects turned in by the
students presently enrolled in this quarter's classes.
It appears that they will have to be scientific and
bibliographical, not experiential. Are our projects
to be morally restricted?
This is a major blockade for our relationship
with the University, perhaps the most crucial since
the anti-war movement, or perhaps the most crucial
in decades.
Are we going to let the University tell us that
"experiential" education is less important than
purely "academic" information? Are we going to
let them completely destroy the now fragile idea
that this University may be for the students? The
plea is now for all students concerned with this
issue to call the Undergraduate Specials Office and
express the interest or desire you have that they be
continued. These type of classes are necessary for
our mutual benefit. Please help evaluate the
classes favorably. Stanford needs a quantum jump
in consciousness levels.
