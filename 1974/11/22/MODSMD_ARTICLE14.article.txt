Two recent events have
brought into dramatic focus the
manner in which the University
interprets and manipulates the
laws to its own ends.
Though widely dissimilar
issues, the question of putting
fraternities into the housing draw
and the recent University decision
to set up a second set of files to
hold confidential letters of
recommendation reveal a
fundamental disregard for a basic
standard of law and intellectual
honesty.
Let us take the case of the
fraternities first. It seems clear
that the administration really does
not like fraternities they are
noisy, cause discipline trouble and
don't quite fit into the image of
an academic institution. It also
seems clear that forcing the
fraternities to participate in the
housing draw offers the University
major advantages in aiding
the housing crunch without a
major increase in funding costs.
But, we are told, this is not
why the administration is
pressuring the fraternities to join
the housing system. The
administration's rationale is that
Title IX of the housing code
forbids discrimination in housing;
and fraternities are certainly
violating that article.
Hypocrisy Revealed
Although the claim is plausible
on its face, its hypocrisy was
revealed recently when it was
announced that HEW itself is
attempting to amend Title IX
specifically to exclude fraternities
and sororities from its
stipulations.
This means that there is now
no legal pressure on the University
to change the fraternities' status.
Does the University alter its
position? Does it admit that the
Title IX argument is now moot?
The answer to both questions is
obviously no.
The second case concerns
Acting President William Miller's
decision to establish a secondary
set of confidential files, which will
contain letters of recommenda
tion. Now I have no quarrel with
the desire to keep letters of
recommendation confidential, but
there is a slight legal problem
the phrasing of the newly adopted
Buckley Amendment. The
amendment says, in short, that all
files for school purposes shall be
open to students.
Dislikes Law
The administration, in contrast
to its attitude toward Title IX,
does not like this law. The result
is an interpretation that comes
very close to circumventing the
law. A student can see his file
but there is now a second set that
will be released only by the
President's office!
In a recent interview on KZSU,
Presidential Legal Adviser James
Siena defended this interpretation
by claiming that "after talking
with members of the Buckley
staff and people in Harvard who
are spearheading the drive [to
amend the Buckley Amendment]
I came to the conclusion that they
I the legislators] really didn't
know what they were doing."
In other words there is no
violation of the intent of the
amendment, since there was no
intent regarding letters of
recommendation. As a humble
pre-law student, I might suggest
that it is somewhat dubious to
deduce the intent of the U.S.
Congress after talks with members
of one senator's staff, and leaders
of an opposition movement
against part of the measure.
However, rather than
second-guess trained lawyers I can
merely observe as a student of the
English language that it is still
very difficult to justify keeping a
second set of files secret when the
law reads: "[Students have] the
right to inspect and review any
and all official records, files, and
data directly related to them. . ."
Both examples illustrate that
the administration will either
apply vigorously or ignore laws in
order to gain its own ends.
