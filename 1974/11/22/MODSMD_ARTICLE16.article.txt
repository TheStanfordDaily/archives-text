# LOW Election Turnout Could Mean Voters Fed Up

headlined the Dallas Morning News on
Election Day 1974.
"You will not just be voting for Democrats
or Republicans," Gerald Ford had told the
electorate the previous day. "You will be
casting your vote of confidence in the United
States of America."
If Ford's synopsis was correct, Americans
cast a resounding vote against their nation two
t weeks ago. Across the continent, just 38
| percent of voting-age individuals journeyed to
the polls, the lowest percentage in a
non-Presidential election year since 1946.

Political theorists differ widely in their
explanations for the low turnout. Five
opinions emerge as most common:
—the reduced turnout represented a
long-growing suspicion that the political
process is futile;
—the non-vote was a vote against the
system by those disillusioned by many recent
scandals lumped under the term "Watergate";
—the turnout was poor mainly among
Republicans, who usually vote in large
numbers, in contrast to Democrats;
—lower turnouts are to be expected
because newly enfranchised young voters
traditionally ballot in smaller numbers;

—voters do not feel they are being provided
with clear enough choices to lure them to the
polls.
Those who attribute the sparse turnout to
voter apathy or hostility differ over whether
the rejection was temporal or part of a
long-term trend.
'Expected'
"The drop had been expected by experts,
who have noted a steady fall-off in voter
participation over the years," reported the
New York Times.
"The electorate is absolutely turned off,
and it isn't just Watergate," said a California
Democratic politician. "People just don't
think anyone can deal with the issues we
face."
* "Maybe people are expecting too much
from politicians," said Political Science Prof.
Robert Hom, attributing the expectations to a
"rise of formal education." Retiring U.S.
Senator George Aiken echoed Horn's
comments. "The voters are not satisfied with
the candidates anymore. Maybe the voters are
more educated."
A woman at a San Francisco beach on
Election Day explained her absence from the
polls: "There's too many crooked politicians.
People voting don't mean nothing. You can
vote yourself blue in the face, and if a
congressman or a certain person decides to do
something, they'll go ahead and do it."
'Long-Term Alientation'
"There's a long-term alienation from the
political system in general that has built up in
the last five years or decade," said Michael
Weatherford, a lecturer in the Political Science
Department.
"The people sense that their needs are not
being responded to on the war, for
example. They see politicians as
either incapable or unwilling to solve these
problems."
Weatherford, however, suspected that the
"short-term influece" of Watergate, Ford's
pardon of former President Richard Nixon
and the government's inability to cure
economic ills "probably was stronger'.' in
influencing voters to stay home.
Turnout figures seem to indicate that 1974
was a special case. Although thfe percentage of
voting-age individuals who cast ballots in the

1970 election was slightly lower than that of
1966 (43.5 to 15.4), the latter total was the
peak of a steadily increasing trend since 1946.
Dramatic Drop
And the drop in 1974 was a much more
dramatic one 5.5 percent. Indeed, as
Newsweek said, it was a "sour and diminished
electorate" which trooped to the polls this
year.
Some analysts believe that the dropoff and
the Democratic sweep which accompanied it
in 1974 logs caused by a particularly poor
turnout among Republicans, who traditionally
vote more faithfully than do Democrats or
independents.
"My guess is that Republicans voted almost
as badly as Democrats," said lorn Hoeber,
publisher of California Journal magazine,
which specializes in state government.
Heatherford disagreed that GOP abstinence
was to blame. "The chairman of the party said
the Republican turnout was the same [as
usual] . . . they just didn't vote for the right
folks."
'Against Us'
"We got our vote out," a California GOP
congressman said, "and they voted against
us."
Figures on the matter are in short supply,
though Hoeber's view seems more plausible.
But Republicans alone weren't responsible for
the lowered turnout.
Horn said the dropoff is "nothing very
surprising with the addition of the 18-year-old
vote. Even with the 21-to-30 year olds, the
younger voters always voted least, except for
the very elderly. The same kind of thing
happened when women got the vote."
Though young people may overcome an
aversion to the ballot box, as women did,
some feel the entire populace may develop a
similar reluctance unless "better choices" are
offered to voters. They cite the 1964 and
1968 Presidential elections as ones in which
the candidates were either two extreme or too
similar to entice the voters.
Such an argument may be valid considering
the high turnouts for the John
Kennedy-Nixon Presidential race, Nixon's race
against California Governor Pat Brown two
years later and the George McGovern-Leo
Thorsness Senate race this year. In each case

the lines were clearly drawn, but not
stretched.
Doubtful Solution
Will, then, distinct yet moderate candidates
be sufficient to lure the voters back? It's
doubtful. The malaise of the past year, though
apparently not yet part of a continuing trend,
is deep-rooted nonetheless.
"Short-term influences always have a
chance to be translated into long-term
alienation," said Weatherford, "if people see
Ford doesn't seem to be able to solve our
economic problems, and if the Democrats are
dependent on his leadership and don't come
up with anything of their own."
A return to the polls, Weatherford
continued, "would have to be based on the
opinion that some politician" can effect
change.
It's an opinion whose time may have come
and gone.

who have noted a steady fall-off in voter
participation over the years," reported the
New York Times.
"The electorate is absolutely turned off,
and it isn't just Watergate," said a California
Democratic politician. "People just don't
think anyone can deal with the issues we
face."
* "Maybe people are expecting too much
from politicians," said Political Science Prof.
Robert Hom, attributing the expectations to a
"rise of formal education." Retiring U.S.
Senator George Aiken echoed Horn's
comments. "The voters are not satisfied with
the candidates anymore. Maybe the voters are
more educated."
A woman at a San Francisco beach on
Election Day explained her absence from the
polls: "There's too many crooked politicians.
People voting don't mean nothing. You can
vote yourself blue in the face, and if a
congressman or a certain person decides to do
something, they'll go ahead and do it."
'Long-Term Alientation'
"There's a long-term alienation from the
political system in general that has built up in
the last five years or decade," said Michael
Weatherford, a lecturer in the Political Science
Department.
"The people sense that their needs are not
being responded to on the war, for
example. They see politicians as
either incapable or unwilling to solve these
problems."
Weatherford, however, suspected that the
"short-term influece" of Watergate, Ford's
pardon of former President Richard Nixon
and the government's inability to cure
economic ills "probably was stronger'.' in
influencing voters to stay home.
Turnout figures seem to indicate that 1974
was a special case. Although thfe percentage of
voting-age individuals who cast ballots in the

1970 election was slightly lower than that of
1966 (43.5 to 15.4), the latter total was the
peak of a steadily increasing trend since 1946.
Dramatic Drop
And the drop in 1974 was a much more
dramatic one 5.5 percent. Indeed, as
Newsweek said, it was a "sour and diminished
electorate" which trooped to the polls this
year.
Some analysts believe that the dropoff and
the Democratic sweep which accompanied it
in 1974 logs caused by a particularly poor
turnout among Republicans, who traditionally
vote more faithfully than do Democrats or
independents.
"My guess is that Republicans voted almost
as badly as Democrats," said lorn Hoeber,
publisher of California Journal magazine,
which specializes in state government.
Heatherford disagreed that GOP abstinence
was to blame. "The chairman of the party said
the Republican turnout was the same [as
usual] . . . they just didn't vote for the right
folks."
'Against Us'
"We got our vote out," a California GOP
congressman said, "and they voted against
us."
Figures on the matter are in short supply,
though Hoeber's view seems more plausible.
But Republicans alone weren't responsible for
the lowered turnout.
Horn said the dropoff is "nothing very
surprising with the addition of the 18-year-old
vote. Even with the 21-to-30 year olds, the
younger voters always voted least, except for
the very elderly. The same kind of thing
happened when women got the vote."
Though young people may overcome an
aversion to the ballot box, as women did,
some feel the entire populace may develop a
similar reluctance unless "better choices" are
offered to voters. They cite the 1964 and
1968 Presidential elections as ones in which
the candidates were either two extreme or too
similar to entice the voters.
Such an argument may be valid considering
the high turnouts for the John
Kennedy-Nixon Presidential race, Nixon's race
against California Governor Pat Brown two
years later and the George McGovern-Leo
Thorsness Senate race this year. In each case

the lines were clearly drawn, but not
stretched.
Doubtful Solution
Will, then, distinct yet moderate candidates
be sufficient to lure the voters back? It's
doubtful. The malaise of the past year, though
apparently not yet part of a continuing trend,
is deep-rooted nonetheless.
"Short-term influences always have a
chance to be translated into long-term
alienation," said Weatherford, "if people see
Ford doesn't seem to be able to solve our
economic problems, and if the Democrats are
dependent on his leadership and don't come
up with anything of their own."
A return to the polls, Weatherford
continued, "would have to be based on the
opinion that some politician" can effect
change.
It's an opinion whose time may have come
and gone.

"You will not just be voting for Democrats
or Republicans," Gerald Ford had told the
electorate the previous day. "You will be

If Ford's synopsis was correct, Americans
cast a resounding vote against their nation two

Political theorists differ widely in their

opinions emerge as most common:
—the reduced turnout represented a

—the turnout was poor mainly among
Republicans, who usually vote in large
numbers, in contrast to Democrats;
—lower turnouts are to be expected
because newly enfranchised young voters
traditionally ballot in smaller numbers;

and the government's inability to cure
economic ills "probably was stronger'.' in
influencing voters to stay home.
Turnout figures seem to indicate that 1974
was a special case. Although thfe percentage of
voting-age individuals who cast ballots in the

1970 election was slightly lower than that of
1966 (43.5 to 15.4), the latter total was the
peak of a steadily increasing trend since 1946.
Dramatic Drop
And the drop in 1974 was a much more
dramatic one 5.5 percent. Indeed, as
Newsweek said, it was a "sour and diminished
electorate" which trooped to the polls this
year.
Some analysts believe that the dropoff and
the Democratic sweep which accompanied it
in 1974 logs caused by a particularly poor
turnout among Republicans, who traditionally
vote more faithfully than do Democrats or
independents.
"My guess is that Republicans voted almost
as badly as Democrats," said lorn Hoeber,
publisher of California Journal magazine,
which specializes in state government.
Heatherford disagreed that GOP abstinence
was to blame. "The chairman of the party said
the Republican turnout was the same [as
usual] . . . they just didn't vote for the right
folks."
'Against Us'
"We got our vote out," a California GOP
congressman said, "and they voted against
us."
Figures on the matter are in short supply,
though Hoeber's view seems more plausible.
But Republicans alone weren't responsible for
the lowered turnout.
Horn said the dropoff is "nothing very
surprising with the addition of the 18-year-old
vote. Even with the 21-to-30 year olds, the
younger voters always voted least, except for
the very elderly. The same kind of thing
happened when women got the vote."
Though young people may overcome an
aversion to the ballot box, as women did,
some feel the entire populace may develop a
similar reluctance unless "better choices" are
offered to voters. They cite the 1964 and
1968 Presidential elections as ones in which
the candidates were either two extreme or too
similar to entice the voters.
Such an argument may be valid considering
the high turnouts for the John
Kennedy-Nixon Presidential race, Nixon's race
against California Governor Pat Brown two
years later and the George McGovern-Leo
Thorsness Senate race this year. In each case

the lines were clearly drawn, but not
stretched.
Doubtful Solution
Will, then, distinct yet moderate candidates
be sufficient to lure the voters back? It's
doubtful. The malaise of the past year, though
apparently not yet part of a continuing trend,
is deep-rooted nonetheless.
"Short-term influences always have a
chance to be translated into long-term
alienation," said Weatherford, "if people see
Ford doesn't seem to be able to solve our
economic problems, and if the Democrats are
dependent on his leadership and don't come
up with anything of their own."
A return to the polls, Weatherford
continued, "would have to be based on the
opinion that some politician" can effect
change.
It's an opinion whose time may have come

headlined the Dallas Morning News on
Election Day 1974.
"You will not just be voting for Democrats
or Republicans," Gerald Ford had told the
electorate the previous day. "You will be
casting your vote of confidence in the United
States of America."
If Ford's synopsis was correct, Americans
cast a resounding vote against their nation two
t weeks ago. Across the continent, just 38
| percent of voting-age individuals journeyed to
the polls, the lowest percentage in a
non-Presidential election year since 1946.

Political theorists differ widely in their
explanations for the low turnout. Five
opinions emerge as most common:
—the reduced turnout represented a
long-growing suspicion that the political
process is futile;
—the non-vote was a vote against the
system by those disillusioned by many recent
scandals lumped under the term "Watergate";
—the turnout was poor mainly among
Republicans, who usually vote in large
numbers, in contrast to Democrats;
—lower turnouts are to be expected
because newly enfranchised young voters
traditionally ballot in smaller numbers;

—voters do not feel they are being provided
with clear enough choices to lure them to the
polls.
Those who attribute the sparse turnout to
voter apathy or hostility differ over whether
the rejection was temporal or part of a
long-term trend.
'Expected'
"The drop had been expected by experts,
who have noted a steady fall-off in voter
participation over the years," reported the
New York Times.
"The electorate is absolutely turned off,
and it isn't just Watergate," said a California
Democratic politician. "People just don't
think anyone can deal with the issues we
face."
* "Maybe people are expecting too much
from politicians," said Political Science Prof.
Robert Hom, attributing the expectations to a
"rise of formal education." Retiring U.S.
Senator George Aiken echoed Horn's
comments. "The voters are not satisfied with
the candidates anymore. Maybe the voters are
more educated."
A woman at a San Francisco beach on
Election Day explained her absence from the
polls: "There's too many crooked politicians.
People voting don't mean nothing. You can
vote yourself blue in the face, and if a
congressman or a certain person decides to do
something, they'll go ahead and do it."
'Long-Term Alientation'
"There's a long-term alienation from the
political system in general that has built up in
the last five years or decade," said Michael
Weatherford, a lecturer in the Political Science
Department.
"The people sense that their needs are not
being responded to on the war, for
example. They see politicians as
either incapable or unwilling to solve these
problems."
Weatherford, however, suspected that the
"short-term influece" of Watergate, Ford's
pardon of former President Richard Nixon
and the government's inability to cure
economic ills "probably was stronger'.' in
influencing voters to stay home.
