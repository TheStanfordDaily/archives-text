# Democrats Get Ready For Stormy Convention
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Whig Party fell apart at the last
midterm political convention ever held by a
major American party, but Santa Clara
County delegates to the Democratic charter
cpnvention to gather nekt month jn- Kansas
City don't consider this a bad omen.
All three delegates agree that the party is
strong enough to survive the conflicts that will
no doubt arise at the convention, and they
believe it will emerge from the gathering as a
more open, issue-oriented and intellectually
coherent organization.
Stanford Law Prof. William Gould, Palo
Alto attorney Thomas Skornia and University
political science researcher Joshua Goldstein
will represent county Democrats at the
convention, which will consider a new charter
for the party.
Although the three men have different
political styles and ideas, they all strongly
support affirmative action for minority groups
and favor placing a no-nonsense affirmative
action clause in the charter. They also want the
party to start taking more specific stands on
issues.
The affirmative action provision is likely to
spark considerable controversy between the
party's left and right wings.
The delegates will consider four separate
versions of the affirmative action article.
The first directs the National Committee to
include provisions for affirmative action for
minorily groups in its by-laws. The second
recommends that states adopt affirmative
action programs of their own choosing. A
third provision is the same as the second, but
specifies certain minority groups, including
any group oppressed because of age, sex,
religion or (economic status.
Goldstein, Skornia and Gould favor the
fourth and strongest of the proposals. It
provides that the National Committee by-laws
promote affirmative action to encourage
participation of people in "reasonable
relationship to their representation in the

Democratic electorate."
Although Santa Clara delegates said they
were sure many Democrats will oppose a
strong affirmative action measure, they
expressed hope the convention will adopt the
strongest of the proposals. All agreed that
most California delegates supported the plan.
The liberal affirmative action proposition
seems likely to receive approval among Kansas
City delegates, since many of them are being
chosen at local caucuses packed with young,
liberal activists.
At the Santa Clara caucus, for example, a
large contingent of Stanford students helped
to push Goldstein over the top and also lent
considerable support to Skornia and Gould.
This raises the question of whether the
delegates to the convention are representative
of the party rank and file or merely the liberal
activists who elected them.
The question is an important one since the
type of charter selected by the
delegates will determine what sort of delegates
are chosen to the 1978 presidential
convention — and thus the Democratic
nominee.
If the party nominates a candidate whose
political views are similar to those of its left
wing activists, the Democrats seem destined
for another defeat.
Furthermore, the intention of activists to
make the party more "issue oriented," while
admirable per se, is all too likely to
disintegrate into an attempt to make the party
more ideological.
Democratic strength has long been based
on the willingness of the diverse elements of
the party to mold themselves into a pragmatic
coalition intent on capturing political office.
If the Democrats attempt to make the
national party too consistent in its policies, it
is likely to fly apart or continue to suffer
McGovern-style defeats in presidential
elections.
Next month's convention should provide
some clues.

coalition intent on capturing political office.
If the Democrats attempt to make the
national party too consistent in its policies, it
is likely to fly apart or continue to suffer
McGovern-style defeats in presidential
elections.
Next month's convention should provide
some clues.
The Whig Party fell apart at the last
midterm political convention ever held by a
major American party, but Santa Clara
County delegates to the Democratic charter
cpnvention to gather nekt month jn- Kansas
City don't consider this a bad omen.
All three delegates agree that the party is
strong enough to survive the conflicts that will
no doubt arise at the convention, and they
believe it will emerge from the gathering as a
more open, issue-oriented and intellectually
coherent organization.
Stanford Law Prof. William Gould, Palo
Alto attorney Thomas Skornia and University
political science researcher Joshua Goldstein
will represent county Democrats at the
convention, which will consider a new charter
for the party.
Although the three men have different
political styles and ideas, they all strongly
support affirmative action for minority groups
and favor placing a no-nonsense affirmative
action clause in the charter. They also want the
party to start taking more specific stands on
issues.
The affirmative action provision is likely to
spark considerable controversy between the
party's left and right wings.
The delegates will consider four separate
versions of the affirmative action article.
The first directs the National Committee to
include provisions for affirmative action for
minorily groups in its by-laws. The second
recommends that states adopt affirmative
action programs of their own choosing. A
third provision is the same as the second, but
specifies certain minority groups, including
any group oppressed because of age, sex,
religion or (economic status.
Goldstein, Skornia and Gould favor the
fourth and strongest of the proposals. It
provides that the National Committee by-laws
promote affirmative action to encourage
participation of people in "reasonable
relationship to their representation in the

Democratic electorate."
Although Santa Clara delegates said they
were sure many Democrats will oppose a
strong affirmative action measure, they
expressed hope the convention will adopt the
strongest of the proposals. All agreed that
most California delegates supported the plan.
The liberal affirmative action proposition
seems likely to receive approval among Kansas
City delegates, since many of them are being
chosen at local caucuses packed with young,
liberal activists.
At the Santa Clara caucus, for example, a
large contingent of Stanford students helped
to push Goldstein over the top and also lent
considerable support to Skornia and Gould.
This raises the question of whether the
delegates to the convention are representative
of the party rank and file or merely the liberal
activists who elected them.
The question is an important one since the
type of charter selected by the
delegates will determine what sort of delegates
are chosen to the 1978 presidential
convention — and thus the Democratic
nominee.
If the party nominates a candidate whose
political views are similar to those of its left
wing activists, the Democrats seem destined
for another defeat.
Furthermore, the intention of activists to
make the party more "issue oriented," while
admirable per se, is all too likely to
disintegrate into an attempt to make the party
more ideological.
Democratic strength has long been based
on the willingness of the diverse elements of
the party to mold themselves into a pragmatic
coalition intent on capturing political office.
