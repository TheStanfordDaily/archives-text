# Not Just Another Resignation
## Starr Leaves Good TMU Record 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Tresidder Memorial Union (TMU) has been
plagued by financial and managerial problems
for years, but the announced resignation of
General Manager Gordon Starr Monday is
unrelated to Tresidder's problems.
Starr's resignation, which becomes
effective Jan. 1, may look like just another
TMU manager being forced to step down, but

Starr and University officials insist it's not.
Dean of Students James Lyons and Assoc.
Dean of Students Dan Williams both
commended Starr for doing "a superb job" in
helping to solve TMU's financial woes. Both
noted that under Starr's direction, Tresidder's
annual deficits had been reduced
considerably.
Why?
So why is he leaving, especially when his
job change includes a salary cut?
Starr said his interest in his new job far
outweighs financial considerations. He will
work as a staff assistant for Earhard Seminars
Training (EST), "a personal growth center" in
San Francisco beginning Jan. 2.
EST "expands the aliveness of people
through a combination of training techniques,
allowing people to experience themselves
more fully," Starr said.
Starr admitted that his current job
putting Tresidder back on solid financial
ground has not been completed. But the
University should be able to finish the job
after he's gone, he said.
Reorganization
Williams, TMU director, said the TMU staff
will be reorganized by mid-December. He said
Starr's jobs probably will be dividied among
current University staff.
The financial outlook has certainly
brightened since Starr became TMU financial
manager in June 3 972 and general manager in

January 1973. During the fiscal year before
Starr's arrival, Tresidder incurred an operating
deficit of $309,000. During Starr's first year,
the deficit dropped to $264,000.
Last year, on Starr's recommendation, the
University signed an operating contract to run
Tresidder's food services with TDS Inc., a
food service company, it cut the deficit
another $lOO,OOO.
The University has followed through on
many of Starr's other recommendations: Fp) -
example, changing the cafeteria to "the
Transition," a temporary fast-food operation^.
Cafeteria Losses
Starr said the old cafeteria was responsible
for most of Tresidder's food service losses.
TMU, with all its services, has lost more than
$1.2 million since 1968.
The change to "the Transition" has been
met with a decline in customer service.
However, with reduced labor and food costs,
the food service is slowly "coming out of the
red," according to Starr.
According to figures for September, TMU
is already $lO,OOO ahead of this fiscal year's
projected deficit.
Including all its services, TMU could
conceivably break even by the end of the
year, Starr said, but he added "it will be very
tight."
"We have received a mandate from a
University budgetary group to achieve
consistant break-even performance by May
1975." Starr said.
Pay Deficit
If TMU does not break even by then,
Lyons said the University must pay the
deficit. The money would come from new
sources or a reduction in student services.
Lyons said the University could institute a
$lO fee assessment, or stop funding either
student counseling, the ASSU or the health
service.
It remains unclear whether TMU can break
even by the May deadline; a lot depends on
upcoming changes. Starr is meeting with
University officials and a student board
chosen by the ASSU to determine just what
these changes will be.
Starr said he already has an operation
model in mind which includes cutting the
space for "the Transition," and using it for
small retail shops. He said the University
might even add some new TMU food services,
including an ice cream franchise and a
on-campus pub. But those prospects are bleak.
Starr said he hopes the group can make a
recommendation to the University within the
next two weeks. The ultimate decisions rest
with Lyons.
Whatever happens, Starr admits that none
of the changes can occur until at least
mid-January, and the results of any changes
based partially on his recommendations
won't be known until well after he is gone.
