# Buckley Law No Help To The Curious
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Curious students had their hopes raised and
then dashed again this week as the effective
date of a so-called "file-access" law passed
with little change in accessibility of files.
The controversy started innocently
enough. Sen. James Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.)
decided it wasn't fair for school teachers to
put nasty things in a kid's cumulative record
without giving parents a chance to try and set
the record straight.
An instance of what Buckley wanted to
prevent occurred when a teacher, observing a
nine-year-old boy hugging a classmate, noted
in his file that the child had "homosexual
tendencies."
The amendment passed Congress by voice
vote and without public hearings. But, as the
effective date of the law approached, critics of
the legislation started to raise questions about
a crucial matter confidential letters of
recommendation.
Questions
Some of the questions: Should confidential
recommendations be included in open files? If
not, should they be removed and destroyed or

removed and stored? Does a student applying
to a new school have the right to inspect his
recommendations?
Officials at different schools have taken
different actions. The Harvard Crimson said
confidential material in the files of graduate
students there would be destroyed unless the
documents' authors could be found to
approve release of the information.
Stanford administrators and lawyers
decided to remove recommendations and
store them separately. The confidential
records will probably be released "only if our
admissions decisions are challenged" in court,
Acting President William Miller said last
Friday.
"The point is that they are relied upon in
the admissions process prior to the time the
person becomes a student here, when the
provisions of the law apply," said James
Siene, legal adviser to the president.
AIC Service
But that raised yet another question:
should Stanford students have access to
recommendations written by Stanford
professors intended for graduate schools? The

Academic Information Center (AIC) has a
service which files away such letters for
pre-law and pre-medical students.
AIC Director Robert Hamrdla said Tuesday
that his office had not yet formulated a policy
on releasing recommendations held by his
office.
"Frankly, we don't know what we are
going to do," he admitted. "I want to
examine . . . the possibility of coordinating
our policies with other offices."
On Tuesday, when the law took effect, 12
students here asked to see their files. Each
received permission to check the contents
minus letters of recommendation. Only two
asked further to see the recommendations,
and they were referred to Siena.
Hargadon Surprised
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon voiced
surprise that students would want to see the
recommendations at all considering that
they were written by persons the students
themselves chose. "I think students realize
that 99.8 percent of recommendations are
positive," Hargadon commented.
Whether the law has had any effect at all

on student access to personal data remains
unresolved. Hargadon has hinted that he
would have "leaned" toward allowing
students to see test scores and other
non-confidential information had anyone
asked.
Some students have complained that
removing information from an open file and
putting it into a closed file violates the spirit
of the law. But Hargadon points out that the
spirit of the law is unclear.
"Since there were no hearings on it, it's
difficult to know just what was meant by the
law," Hargadon noted.
The legislation may .itself soon be
amended. Buckley plans to introduce an
amendment exempting confidential letters of
recommendation written before last Tuesday,
according to his legislative assistant.
This would validate the legal position taken
by the University, but would leave unresolved
the question of whether later
recommednations could also be kept away
from students.

Some students have complained that
removing information from an open file and
putting it into a closed file violates the spirit
of the law. But Hargadon points out that the
spirit of the law is unclear.
"Since there were no hearings on it, it's
difficult to know just what was meant by the
law," Hargadon noted.
The legislation may .itself soon be
amended. Buckley plans to introduce an
amendment exempting confidential letters of
recommendation written before last Tuesday,
according to his legislative assistant.
This would validate the legal position taken
by the University, but would leave unresolved
the question of whether later
recommednations could also be kept away
from students.
Curious students had their hopes raised and
then dashed again this week as the effective
date of a so-called "file-access" law passed
with little change in accessibility of files.
The controversy started innocently
enough. Sen. James Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.)
decided it wasn't fair for school teachers to
put nasty things in a kid's cumulative record
without giving parents a chance to try and set
the record straight.
An instance of what Buckley wanted to
prevent occurred when a teacher, observing a
nine-year-old boy hugging a classmate, noted
in his file that the child had "homosexual
tendencies."
The amendment passed Congress by voice
vote and without public hearings. But, as the
effective date of the law approached, critics of
the legislation started to raise questions about
a crucial matter confidential letters of
recommendation.
Questions
Some of the questions: Should confidential
recommendations be included in open files? If
not, should they be removed and destroyed or

removed and stored? Does a student applying
to a new school have the right to inspect his
recommendations?
Officials at different schools have taken
different actions. The Harvard Crimson said
confidential material in the files of graduate
students there would be destroyed unless the
documents' authors could be found to
approve release of the information.
Stanford administrators and lawyers
decided to remove recommendations and
store them separately. The confidential
records will probably be released "only if our
admissions decisions are challenged" in court,
Acting President William Miller said last
Friday.
"The point is that they are relied upon in
the admissions process prior to the time the
person becomes a student here, when the
provisions of the law apply," said James
Siene, legal adviser to the president.
AIC Service
But that raised yet another question:
should Stanford students have access to
recommendations written by Stanford
professors intended for graduate schools? The

Academic Information Center (AIC) has a
service which files away such letters for
pre-law and pre-medical students.
AIC Director Robert Hamrdla said Tuesday
that his office had not yet formulated a policy
on releasing recommendations held by his
office.
"Frankly, we don't know what we are
going to do," he admitted. "I want to
examine . . . the possibility of coordinating
our policies with other offices."
On Tuesday, when the law took effect, 12
students here asked to see their files. Each
received permission to check the contents
minus letters of recommendation. Only two
asked further to see the recommendations,
and they were referred to Siena.
Hargadon Surprised
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon voiced
surprise that students would want to see the
recommendations at all considering that
they were written by persons the students
themselves chose. "I think students realize
that 99.8 percent of recommendations are
positive," Hargadon commented.
Whether the law has had any effect at all

on student access to personal data remains
unresolved. Hargadon has hinted that he
would have "leaned" toward allowing
students to see test scores and other
non-confidential information had anyone
asked.
