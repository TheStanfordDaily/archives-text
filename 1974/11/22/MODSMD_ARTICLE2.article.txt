# 'Live Oak,' Co-Op Assessments Defeated
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
With a slightly less than 20 percent
voter turnout, the proposed $1 fee
assessments for the ASSU record co-op
and the new weekly newspaper Live
Oak were defeated yesterday in an
ASSU special election.
The record co-op received 874 yes
votes (40.2 percent) and 1302 no
votes (59.8). Live Oak did a little
better, garnering 890 yes votes (40.9)
and 1284 no votes (59.1).
ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald said that vote tallies had
been counted from the home campus
and two overseas campuses, Lima,
Peru,and Beutelsbach, Germany. There
are 210 more potential votes which
could come in from the other overseas
campuses, Fitzgerald added, but that
would raise the number of total votes
cast to only 2386, which is still 94
votes short of the minimum 20
percent needed to pass an assessment.
ASSU Vice Presidents Ann Carter
and Len Mackey and undergraduate
Lance Friedmann, authors of the
co-op proposal, had predicted earlier
that the voter turnout would indicate
the strength of a student market for a
co-op. However, an actual market
survey was not conducted prior to the
election.

Carter said she was disappointed
with the results, but "if that's the
sense of the students, we don't want
to go ahead if the students don't want
it.
"Even if the assessment had won, if
it had been close we would have had
reservations about going ahead with
it," she said.
Carter attributed the loss to the bad
weather yesterday, and a "general
student backlash against fee
assessments." The view of the co-op as
far as students are concerned was
"myopic," she said.
Bad Weather
Mackey agreed that the bad
weather was the "most important
reason" for the failure of 20 percent
of the students to vote. "It was a

combination of our failure to do
enough campaigning and the
realization on the part of some
students that it may be advantageous
to avoid voting than to vote no," he
added.
Mackey said he expected someone
to suggest changing the election
system and the 20 percent rule. "Some
different system is called for," he said.
Carter said that the co-op sponsors
would not try to start up the project
again and that any future projects to
retail any line of goods were unlikely
since no space was available.
No Space
"We are not going to be able to
engage in any retail sales in the
Bookstore. Should the ASSU come up
with some space, possibly in Tresidder,

we might try again," she said.
Live Oak editor Bill Weinstein
refused to comment.
Fitzgerald said that costs of the
election ($400) would be borne by the
ASSU. Had either assessment passed.
50 percent of the labor costs for the
election workers would have been
deducted from the assessment
received.
"Since neither assessment passed,"
he said v "the ASSU election bylaws
provide for the costs to be taken care
of. Since there was no record co-op,
there are no funds for the proponents
of the co-op to help pay for the labor
costs. As for Live Oak —I don't know
what they'll do, but my guess is that
ASSU funds will pay for this
election."

survey was not conducted prior to the
election.

Carter said she was disappointed
with the results, but "if that's the
sense of the students, we don't want
to go ahead if the students don't want
it.
"Even if the assessment had won, if
it had been close we would have had
reservations about going ahead with
it," she said.
Carter attributed the loss to the bad
weather yesterday, and a "general
student backlash against fee
assessments." The view of the co-op as
far as students are concerned was
"myopic," she said.
Bad Weather
Mackey agreed that the bad
weather was the "most important
reason" for the failure of 20 percent
of the students to vote. "It was a

combination of our failure to do
enough campaigning and the
realization on the part of some
students that it may be advantageous
to avoid voting than to vote no," he
added.
Mackey said he expected someone
to suggest changing the election
system and the 20 percent rule. "Some
different system is called for," he said.
Carter said that the co-op sponsors
would not try to start up the project
again and that any future projects to
retail any line of goods were unlikely
since no space was available.
No Space
"We are not going to be able to
engage in any retail sales in the
Bookstore. Should the ASSU come up
with some space, possibly in Tresidder,

we might try again," she said.
Live Oak editor Bill Weinstein
refused to comment.
Fitzgerald said that costs of the
election ($400) would be borne by the
ASSU. Had either assessment passed.
50 percent of the labor costs for the
election workers would have been
deducted from the assessment
received.
"Since neither assessment passed,"
he said v "the ASSU election bylaws
provide for the costs to be taken care
of. Since there was no record co-op,
there are no funds for the proponents
of the co-op to help pay for the labor
costs. As for Live Oak —I don't know
what they'll do, but my guess is that
ASSU funds will pay for this
election."
With a slightly less than 20 percent
voter turnout, the proposed $1 fee
assessments for the ASSU record co-op
and the new weekly newspaper Live
Oak were defeated yesterday in an
ASSU special election.
The record co-op received 874 yes
votes (40.2 percent) and 1302 no
votes (59.8). Live Oak did a little
better, garnering 890 yes votes (40.9)
and 1284 no votes (59.1).
ASSU Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald said that vote tallies had
been counted from the home campus
and two overseas campuses, Lima,
Peru,and Beutelsbach, Germany. There
are 210 more potential votes which
could come in from the other overseas
campuses, Fitzgerald added, but that
would raise the number of total votes
cast to only 2386, which is still 94
votes short of the minimum 20
percent needed to pass an assessment.
ASSU Vice Presidents Ann Carter
and Len Mackey and undergraduate
Lance Friedmann, authors of the
co-op proposal, had predicted earlier
that the voter turnout would indicate
the strength of a student market for a
co-op. However, an actual market
survey was not conducted prior to the
election.
