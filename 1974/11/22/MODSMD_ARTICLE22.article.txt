## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) Parents can
have better luck picking their
baby's sex by timing natural or
artificial insemination around
shifts in the woman's body
a medical researcher
says.
The sex ratio of offspring was
found to change significantly
when conceived at various stages
during the menstrual cycle, the
researcher says. And the method
*of conception also affects the
" ratio, he determined.
During the periods when the
proportion of male babies increased
with natural insemination, the
chances of having a male with
artificial insemination decreased,
he says.
% And, at other times when the
artificial method produced more
males, the chances of having boys
decreased with natural
insemination.
In a report in the current New
England Journal of Medicine, Dr.
Rodrigo Guerrero of the
Universidad del Valle in Cali,
Colombia, says he analyzed the
records of 1318 pregnancies. The
cases were drawn from the United
States, France, Canada, Mauritius
Island and Colombia.
4 With help from researchers at
the Harvard School of Public
Health, Guerrero looked at the
proportion of boys to girls in 875
cases in which the parents had
normal sex. He also examined 443
cases in which conception came
artificially placing male
" sperm in females.
.It has been established that on
or ' about the 14th day of the
menstrual cycle, an egg is released
from the woman's ovary and
becomes ripe for conception.
hormone levels at that
"time cause a few tenths of a
degree rise in body temperature.
