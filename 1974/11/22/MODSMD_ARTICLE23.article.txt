# Report Urges Consolidation Of Police, Fire Systems
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Police and fire communications
of Stanford University, Palo Alto,
Los Altos and Mountain View
should be consolidated, according
to a Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) study issued earlier this
month.
The report, third in a series
conducted for Santa Clara County
by SRI, studied the
communication systems of fire
and police departments in Palo
Alto, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San
Jose and the south county areas,
and listed a number of possible
methods of consolidation.
The recommended plan
proposed that Stanford, Palo
Alto, Los Altos and Mountain
View be dispatched from the
North County Courthouse as one
of four centers, the others to be
composed of Sunnyvale and Santa
Clara; Gilroy and Morgan Hill; and
San Jose county sheriff,
Campbell, Los Gatos, Saratoga
and Milpitas.
Los Altos Hills, currently
under contract with the county
for police protection, would
remain part of the County
Sheriff's department, being
dispatched from San Jose, rather
than joining the North County
dispatching unit.
Through implementation of
this proposal, the SRI report
indicated that $l5-$32 million
would be saved, even assuming
that present arrangements are
improved. Additionally, each
municipality running its own
communications would save
money, the report notes.
Besides cost, nine factors were
taken into account by the report.
They are law enforcement
dispatch, fire protection dispatch,
telephone systems, personnel
considerations, desire of agencies,
acceptance by the public,
security, vulnerability and
reliability and use of radio

frequencies.
Four of the nine are best met
by the proposal, the research team
led by Thomas Dayharsh
concluded. These include law
enforcement and fire protection
dispatch requirements, overall
telephone system considerations
and acceptability in terms of
personnel requirements, the
report states. Reliability is also
emphasized as being good.
Opposition to the plan may be
forthcoming though. A
preliminary questionnaire
distributed to the city managers
of Sunnyvale, Palo Alto and Santa
Clara before the cost savings
that could be affected by the plan
became known indicated that
they opposed any consolidation,
preferring to retain their present
systems.
Yet, of the proposals given in
the questionnaire, their response
to the four-center one was
highest.
Reached for comment
Wednesday, Stanford Fire Chief
Frank Jurian said that the plan
"has merit, but there are a lot of
factors that need to be taken into
account.
"Personally, I see some areas
that would have to be resolved
before something like this could
even be considered."
Bruce Wiggins, Stanford
operations manager, said that his
department has not had a chance
to make any judgments on the
study. "I really haven't had an
opportunity to study the report,
he said. "I did attend the meeting
last Friday. It was the first public
presentation and the consensus
was that everyone had just
glanced through it. That's all that
I've done," Wiggins said.
However, he emphasized that
"Stanford University is interested
in any improvement of service if
there is a reduction of costs."
For now, SRI will make
presentations to each City Council

"city by c(ty" before anything
else is done, Wiggins said.
As a secondary plan, the report
proposed that three centers be
organized, with Santa Clara
joining the central dispatching
point and Sunnyvale consolidating
with the North County agencies.
Costs of the first plan,
estimated at $2,842,700 initially
and $3,455,880 annually, are
higher than those of the alternate,
which would cost $2,339,880
initially and $2,796,700 annually.
Both are considerably less than
the costs of updating the entire
system, the report said.
"It is our opinion that the
benefits of the recommended
alternatives outweigh the benefits
of maximum costs savings and
that both the citizens and the
public safety agencies that serve
them will be ultimately more
satisfied with one of these two
alternatives," the researchers
concluded.
