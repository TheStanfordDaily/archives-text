## The 						World Of Cinema 'Amarcord', 'Steppenwolf' Nostalgic Films 
### George Powell 
Nostalgia, for some reason or
another, seems to be popular with
Americans these days. It must be
popular with Italians, too, because
Amarcord. Frederico Fellini's
latest film, takes a dreamy bow to
life in the 1930s from Fellini's
unique viewpoint.
Steppenwolf , the movie of the
Herman Hesse novel originally
published in 1972, also seems an
exercise in nostalgia, when viewed
in 1974. It takes the viewer back
to the foundations of angst and
anomie that gripped so many
young people in the late 60s,
when Hesse's nbvel received wide
recognition. So it's only fitting
that Steppenwolf should be
directed by Fred Haines, a former
staffer of radio station KPFA in
Berkeley.
In bringing Steppenwolf to the
screen, Haines had a much
tougher job than Fellini, who had
to be faithful only to his
imagination in directing
Amarcord. Haines, however, had
previous experience in adapting
what many people would consider
unadaptable novels to the screen.
With director Joseph Strick, he
co-authored the screenplay for the
movie version of Ulysses, which
brought him an Academy Award
nomination, but little in the way of
subsequent work.
Faithful To Book
Haines had to be faithful to the
vision of Hesse, as well as his own,
while attempting to make a
cohesive movie out of
Steppenwolf. He succeeds on all
counts, but is left with little more
than a rather puffed-up, pedantic
statement of the flower child
litany "Relax, let go, loosen up,
do your own thing." What keeps
the movie from sinking under the
weight of its own restated
profundities is the outstanding
performance of Max Von Sydow
J Haller, the Steppenwolf.
Teetering on the brink of madness

on an intellectual high wire far
above the bourgeois below,
Harry's balancing act is a wonder
to behold, and the major source
of fascination in the live action
sequences.
The animated sequences, which
are necessary to show Harry's
state of mind and his encounter
with the Magic Theater, are also
noteworthy. Dali-esque and
surreal, they are the creation of
Jaroslav Bradac, whose style does
much to explain the workings of
Harry's mind.
Old Restatement
As a whole, though,
Steppenwolf boils down to a
restatement of older man
reinvigoratirig his tired, useless life
with a young female of some sort.
In this case, the female is Hermine
iDominique Sanda) as
beautiful, as hard and as cold as a
quart/. crystal carving and
perhaps as crazy as Harry.
Hesse may have been one of
the first to get it down on paper,
but as film, the theme has been

done and overdone, the most
recent example being Breezy, in
which tired, angst-striken
businessman William Holden has
his life brightened by hippie Kay
Lenz, who, after a struggle,
teaches him the value of the
cosmic giggle. And that,
essentially, is what Harry learns
from Hermine, although it's acted
out for him in the (magic) theater
of his mind, rather than in the
melodramatic real time of Breezy.
While Steppenwolf is about
loosening up with a cosmic giggle
or two, Amarcord is about settling
back and remembering the way it
was, through rose-tinted glasses.
Fellini, who has been obsessed by
freaky looks and inexplicable
events in most of his recent films,
rounds off humanity's rough
edges until the rudest thing left in
Amarcord is a fart or a forced
dose of castor oil.
Clever Opening
Amarcord opens with a
toe-tapping score from Nino Rota,

while simple credits role by. Then
the air is filled with golden puff
balls known in Italy as "manine,"
which herald the coming of
spring. As the gentle, golden tufts
drift hither and yon on the breeze,
it's obvious that this Fellini film
will have no grotesqueries, only
amusing quirks, and nothing more
sexually debuched than young
boys' natural urges to do it with
girls.
Structurally, Amarcord is

about as flimsy as the golden
puffs wafting through the air at
the beginning and end of the Film.
Only the changing seasons serve to
hold the vignettes of Fellini's
youth together, but lack of a
discernable plot doesn't make for
tedium. The lazy, hazy focus
makes viewing Amarcord like
having an especially vivid and
relaxing dream, then waking up
with a sleepy smile of
contentment.
