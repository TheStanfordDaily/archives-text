# New Riders Perform To Sparse Audience
## 
### GARY COHEN 
The only unfortunate aspect of
last Friday's concert at Winterland
was the lack of people who were
there to enjoy it. The 5000-seat
hall was about one third occupied,
an occasion which caused
promoter Bill Graham to close the
balcony. Yet, for those who were
lucky enough to attend, the
evening was quite enjoyable.
Commander Cody and His Lost
Planet Airmen performed their
standard act: A bunch of hot
songs dealing with drugs, trucks
and sex. Nothing profound or
pretentious, just a lot of fun.
The Airmen are great, not
because of their musicianship, but
rather because they know what
they're all about. Who else could
play "The Downtown Seeds And
Stems Again Blues," "Diggy Diggy
Lo" and "The Greatest Daddy of
Them All" in the same set and not
be apologetic about it? In what
other group does the lead vocalist
(Billy C. Farlow) hold a guitar and
not play it? And who besides the
Commander could play boogie
piano on "Jailhouse Rock" with
his feet?
Dancing Room
By the tirpe the band returned
for their encores ("only for San
Francisco"), "Hot;Rpd Lincoln,"
"Mean Woman BTftfeS"' and "Lost
in The Ozone," tHe entire (jrowd
had abandoned its seats in favor
of the expansive daihce floor.
While that sounds like a tough
act to follow, The New Riders
have been doing just that on and
off for the past two years, with
consistent success. Their
personnel is outstanding, their
music pleasant and finally it seems
that they've solved the problem of
a previously limited repertoire
with the release of their new

album, Brujo.
On Friday, they played
somewhere between 20 and
25 different songs (but who's
counting), each distinctive and
each well received. Buddy Cage is
undoubtedly one of the best pedal
steel guitarists around along
with Jerry Garcia and Bernie
Leadon and he stood out all
night long. Drummer Spencer
Dryden has been continually
outstanding since he left Jefferson
Airplane four years ago.
Good Sounds
Add John Dawson's rhythm
guitar and pleasing vocals, David
Nelson's leads, Newcomer Skip
Battin's Bass and Commander
Cody's piano playing and you
have the sound that the Riders
hope will fill the void the Grateful
Dead have left on the rock scene.
If Friday night is any
indication, The New Riders could
go a long way in that direction.
Interspersing familiar favorites ("I
Don't Know You," "Panama
Red," . "L.A. Cowboy" and
"Henry") with cuts off the new
LP ("Workingman's Woman,"
"Singing Cowboy " and Dylan's
"You Angel, You"), they played
studio type versions of songs for
about an hour and a half, before
they got down to straight boogie
music.
Undoubtedly, the highlight of
the evening was "Portland
Woman," with a 20-minute
jam featuring Buddy Cage and the
Commander. After that David
Nelson sang "Crooked Judge," a
song he wrote with Robert
Hunter, followed by "Glendale
Train," probably the Rider's rpost
popular song. After that they
walked off (as if they weren't
coming back).

night long. Drummer Spencer
Dryden has been continually
outstanding since he left Jefferson
Airplane four years ago.
Good Sounds
Add John Dawson's rhythm
guitar and pleasing vocals, David
Nelson's leads, Newcomer Skip
Battin's Bass and Commander
Cody's piano playing and you
have the sound that the Riders
hope will fill the void the Grateful
Dead have left on the rock scene.
If Friday night is any
indication, The New Riders could
go a long way in that direction.
Interspersing familiar favorites ("I
Don't Know You," "Panama
Red," . "L.A. Cowboy" and
"Henry") with cuts off the new
LP ("Workingman's Woman,"
"Singing Cowboy " and Dylan's
"You Angel, You"), they played
studio type versions of songs for
about an hour and a half, before
they got down to straight boogie
music.
Undoubtedly, the highlight of
the evening was "Portland
Woman," with a 20-minute
jam featuring Buddy Cage and the
Commander. After that David
Nelson sang "Crooked Judge," a
song he wrote with Robert
Hunter, followed by "Glendale
Train," probably the Rider's rpost
popular song. After that they
walked off (as if they weren't
coming back).
The only unfortunate aspect of
last Friday's concert at Winterland
was the lack of people who were
there to enjoy it. The 5000-seat
hall was about one third occupied,
an occasion which caused
promoter Bill Graham to close the
balcony. Yet, for those who were
lucky enough to attend, the
evening was quite enjoyable.
Commander Cody and His Lost
Planet Airmen performed their
standard act: A bunch of hot
songs dealing with drugs, trucks
and sex. Nothing profound or
pretentious, just a lot of fun.
The Airmen are great, not
because of their musicianship, but
rather because they know what
they're all about. Who else could
play "The Downtown Seeds And
Stems Again Blues," "Diggy Diggy
Lo" and "The Greatest Daddy of
Them All" in the same set and not
be apologetic about it? In what
other group does the lead vocalist
(Billy C. Farlow) hold a guitar and
not play it? And who besides the
Commander could play boogie
piano on "Jailhouse Rock" with
his feet?
Dancing Room
By the tirpe the band returned
for their encores ("only for San
Francisco"), "Hot;Rpd Lincoln,"
"Mean Woman BTftfeS"' and "Lost
in The Ozone," tHe entire (jrowd
had abandoned its seats in favor
of the expansive daihce floor.
While that sounds like a tough
act to follow, The New Riders
have been doing just that on and
off for the past two years, with
consistent success. Their
personnel is outstanding, their
music pleasant and finally it seems
that they've solved the problem of
a previously limited repertoire
with the release of their new

album, Brujo.
On Friday, they played
somewhere between 20 and
25 different songs (but who's
counting), each distinctive and
each well received. Buddy Cage is
undoubtedly one of the best pedal
steel guitarists around along
with Jerry Garcia and Bernie
Leadon and he stood out all
night long. Drummer Spencer
Dryden has been continually
outstanding since he left Jefferson
Airplane four years ago.
