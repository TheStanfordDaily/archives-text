# Quartet Lives Up To Outstanding Billing

### MARY INGERSOLL 
The Guarneri String Quartet
opened the first of three concerts
Tuesday night at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium to a capacity
audience.
Internationally known, the
Guarneri Quartet well deserves its
reputation as the finest quartet in
the world. As an attest to this,
their performance of three
Beethoven quartets certainly was
as Beethoven would have wanted
it.
The concert began excellently,
and improved from there. It
opened with the Quartet in E flat
Major, Op. 127, No. 12. This is
from Beethoven's late period,
with a personalized form, intense
''soul-searching" musical
expression, and during the height
of his maturity as a composer.
The technical superiority of
the group was evident from the
first movement, but musically
it still hadn't completely
warmed up. The rest of the piece,
however, was perfect, with
particularly beautiful moments of
solo cello in the second
movement.'
The second piece, the Quartet
in F Major, Op. 18, No. 1, is from
Beethoven's early period, and is a
marked contrast to his later
works. This particular quartet is
the first he published. Very
classical in form, it is spirited, yet
with tragic overtones in the

second movement.
. The group played most of this
work faster than usual; musicians
of lesser caliber might find the
articulation difficult at this pace,
but again, the group displayed its
excellence and completely
matched the challenge.
The concert ended with a work
from Beethoven's middle period,
the Quartet in C Major, Op. 59,
No. 3. This is eveidence of his
grandest style; not as intimate as
the later period, but more
romantic than the early.
Here the group was at its
finest. The piece is difficult and
intricate, full of unusual textural
nuances that they played
brilliantly. The cellist's pizzicato
was clear and reverberant; the first
and second violins displayed vivid
contrasts between the expressive
and more diminished passages
and the violist played his solos
with an extreme physical and
emotional energy. They are
superb, sensitive musicians.
Much of the reason for their
great sound is immediately
obvious the unity, timing and
"harmony" between them as a
group.
Thus they richly deserve the
standing ovation they received
Tuesday night. Equally
memorable should be their
coming concerts at Dinkelspiel,
Friday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at
2:30 p.m.
