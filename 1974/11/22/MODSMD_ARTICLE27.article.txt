David Bowie
David Live
RCA CPL 2-0771
David Bowie's physical
appearance turns off many people
that might otherwise enjoy his
music. That's a shame, because his
music is well worth listening to. In
fact, the unexposed might find
themselves hearing some
unexpectedly good music if they
pick up Bowie's latest album,
David Live.
This album shows off Bowie's
tremendous versatility. From
beginning to end, it is a display of
musical talent. Recorded live on
his tour late last summer, the
songs focus primarily on his later
work Aladdin Sane, Pin-Ups and
Diamond Dogs. There are also
some old hits on the double
album that serve to give the
record a "Greatest Hits" quality.
The sound Js technically
excellent throughout the album.
Despite being live, the quality of
the album is as good as any of his
studio albums.
Bowie has a good backup band
although Mick Ronson would
have made it even better and he
lets them go off on their own
occasionally. Guitarist Earl Slick
takes advantage of that for a
couple of tight riffs, as in "When
You Rock n' Roll With Me."
Michael Kamen produces some
strange sounding electronic
backup music on the electric
organ.
Bowie changes style from song
to song, from mellow to hard rock
and back again to mellow. His
ability to swiftly change
keynotes his versatility.
Some of the weaker points of
the album are his re-works of
older material. "Suffragette City"
is one old song in particular that
lost something in the transition
from studio recording to live
recording. But the occasional
decline in quality is made up for
by the improvement in style on
others "Changes" and "Aladdin
Sane" imVnediately come to mind
as typical of improved songs.
It is impossible to say that
Bowie has been a consistent
performer style-wise, because he's
constantly fluctuating, but his
music is certainly consistently
good. He's changed tremendously
from the days of "Suffragette
City" to "1984," and that's what
keeps him entertaining so well. He
doesn't grow stale.
Bowie has no problem in
putting out good music, and this
album is truly indicative of that.
He is very pleasing musically, and
it would be sad if he didn't get the
recognition that he truly deserves
from musically oriented people.

Fairport Convention
A Moveable Feast -
Island I LPS 9285
After a short separation,
Fairport Convention, those
well-regarded English folk-rockers,

have been reunited with Sandy
Denny, the vocalist who had so
much to do with the group's early
success.
She sounds a lot like Grace
Slick on parts of A Moveable
Feast, and with energetic fiddling
the rest of Fairport Convention
sounds like the Jefferson Starship
on a good night.
Fairport Convention, however,
has always occupied a unique
place in the pop spectrum, and
this single-record live album does
nothing to diminish that position.
From the opening bars of one of
the group's best known tunes,
"Matty Groves," to faultless,
raucous arrangements of Dylan's
"Down in the Flood" and the
popular "Something You Got,"
this album should please all
Fairport fans, and serve as a good
introduction to the group for
those unfamiliar with it.
But be forewarned. If you
don't like English country rock,
or lots of fiddling in songs like
"Fiddlestix" and "Sir B.
Mackenzie," best pass this one by.
However, if you liked Sandy
Denny solo, don't miss her
combined again with one of the
first groups to make English folk
music electric.

Leo Kottke — y —y —y-
Dreams And AH That Stuff
Capitol ST-11335
To those acquainted with Leo
Kottke's excellent guitar
arrangements, parts of Dreams
And All That Stuff will sound
awfully familiar. But the inclusion
of some instrumental
accompaniments from guest
musicians makes this album a bit
more well rounded than his
others.

As usual, Kottke performs
flawlessly and with great sensitive
expression. He carries the rhythm,
melody and harmony of the songs
by himself, giving numerous
examples of his ability to exploit
his instrument to the fullest. And
on most of the cuts, the
embellishments provided by the
other musicians serve to develop
the mood more completely.

On "Twilight Property," for
example, Cal Hand's steel guitar
slides the song towards
melancholia. And on "Bill
Chaetham," Hand's dobro does a
job of lending a distinctly
country-western flavor to the
tune.
"Why Ask Why," one of the
most tender songs on the album,
utilizes the sounds of an acoustic
piano to round out the intricate
lines of Kotke's guitar. In

addition, duet guitar, ' bass,
percussion and synthesizer are
occasionally included
unobtrusively.
No one instrument demands
attention at the expense of the
others,, but each adds depth to the
sound as a whole. The melding of
guitar and steel guitar on "Mona
Roy," is a noteworthy example.
Though it is heard on his

Greenhouse album, Kottke's voice
is absent here. Some may express
disappointment at this, while on
the other hand, Kottke would
contend that the omission of his
vocals is a blessing. He only uses
the rudest of terms to describe his
Dilities as a singer. The effect of
nis vocals is occasional!} pleasant
on older songs such as "Going
From The Cradle to the Grave,"
but the instrumentals on this
album are rich and varied enough
to make the songs sound
full-bodied.
It is worth nothing that some
of his songs have a great deal of
energy, without the use of
vocalists or of heavy electric
instruments. "When Shrimps
Learn to Whistle" gets most of its
drive from Kottke's slide guitar
runs. That song, and "Taking a
Sandwich to a Feast" are
showcases for some great
strumming and rapid changes of
pace.
Kottke's songs are generally
made up of a series of smooth and
melodic motifs. Each part is
euphonous and interesting in and
of itself. The problem is that some
of the songs are rather ineffective
combinations of the motifs.
"Constant Traveller," for
example, contains beautiful parts,
but is, as a whole, a bit disjointed
and uneven. Other songs, such as
"When Shrimps Learn to Whistle"
flow more easily, and include well
executed changes of pace and
mood. Really, there is not a bad
song on the album.
Dreams And All That Stuff
provides the listener with a
buoyant musical package to which
he can cling if threatened by being
overcome by a wave of less gentle
sounds.

Masters of the Airwaves
Masters of the Airwaves
Epic KE 33060
This is the first album from a
band that's supposed to be
popular here in the Bay Area,
according to enclosed publicity.
Only two things are confusing
about that; first, that the group is
a heavy metal band (which can't
happen here) and second, that the
name Masters of the Airwaves has
just been adopted (so no one
knows the new name). They used

to be called the Himmy Berick
Group, after Berick. the group's
guiding light.
His gimmick is a double-necked
steel guitar, which sports 32
strings and sounds "real neat"
when Berick hits some
particularly "heavy" riffs.
All tongue-in-cheek asides
aside, the instrumental parts of
this album are tight and tasty, if
still more heavy guitar riffs and
wah-wah boogie effects can be
considered fresh.

Songs like "Squeeze Me
Positive," "Highway to Hell" or
"Getting Tight," feature lively
arrangements backed with stale
lyrics about topics that have been
sung to death by singers with
better vocal abilities.
For a debut album, though.
Masters of the Airwaves does
show a glimmer of promise among
all the recycled riffs. After all.
even the Beatles got started with a
gimmick - long hair.
