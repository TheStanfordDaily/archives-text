## Mike White: Charmer Becomes Winner 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Mike White is young, suave,
handsome and articulate. He
dresses well, smiles a lot and
grasps your hand with authority.
- 'Hell," said Stanford Sports
Information Director Gary
Cavalli, "he could charm the pants
off anybody."
Of course it takes more than
charm to turn a floundering,
(.suspension-ridden football team
into a Pacific Eight title
contender. And White, 38, who
will be participating in his 20th
consecutive Big Game tomorrow
at Berkeley, has accomplished a
miraculous revival in three short
years as California's head coach.
If the Bears beat Stanford
tomorrow, it will mark the first
time in 23 years that a California
team has won eight games. Much
of the credit for Cal's 1974

success lies with quarterback
Steve. Bartkowski and explosive
running baqks Chuck Muncie and
Howard Strickland. But nobody
dares dispute White's influence.
''He's intelligent,
well-organized and dedicated,"
says Denver Broncos coach John
Ralston, Stanford's head coach
while White was offensive
coordinator here. "Mike has
intense personal pride."
"He's very emotional, very
sensitive, very magnetic," adds
Bob Murphy, former Stanford
sports information director and a
long-time friend of White's.
"Mike's been known to fight with
his players on the field, and he
thinks it's good for the players
and good for the team."
Two Faces
At Stanford, however, many
players resented White's fiery
tactics. Some, including standout
running back Jackie Brown, felt
White's on-the-field exhortations
were often insincere. "His main
technique," Brown recalls, "was
what we call 'two faces' telling
you one thing to your face and
then talking about you another
way when your back was turned."
Before the 1972 Rose Bowl,
starting fullback Hillary Shockley
angrily walked off the team when
White told him he had lost his
starting job, ostensibly because of
a minor injury. Shockley's
dissatisfaction with White was
widely known, and rumors
involving White's relations with
other black players flared a month
later when White was the leading
candidate for Stanford's vacated
head coaching position.
Some suspected that the black
players would boycott spring
practice en masse if White got the
job. White himself admits "he
heard some rumors," but said he
didn't think there "was much
substance in them."
Toughest Decision
Talk of protest was irrelevant,
however, as soon as White made
"truly the toughest decision in my
life," accepting the head coaching

job at his alma mater, California,
after both schools had made firm
offers.
"I don't think I could have
made a wrong decision," he said.
"I just told myself I'd make a
decision and then make it the
right one."
White's first two seasons at Cal
were difficult ones. The Bears
struggled to 3-8 and 4-7 records,
as White himself struggled to mold
his coaching style.
"Mike really builds a bond
with his players," Murphy said,
"and it was harder as a head coach
for him to detach himself from
the players."
White admits that the
transition was slow and painful. "I
finally realized that stability and
consistency are two key words as
a head coach," he said. "When
you're dealing with 55 guys
instead of 10 or 15 and you're
not dealing directly with each
segment every day you have to
take more of an administrative,
organizational approach. The last
two years have been a real
maturing experience for me."
White says, "I'm not a guy that
will set 20-year goals. I set
short-term goals and try to
accomplish them. I coach purely
for the kids. I feel I have
something to contribute in an
educational atmosphere I can
help teach kids about
themselves."
Stanford assistant coach
George Seifert says White
"sincerely loves the emotion of
football and he passes his
emotion on to his players."
Skinny Little Guy
Of course White's emotion
despite his mellower behavior this
year runs highest around Big
Game time. As a 145-pound
sophomore receiver/defensive
back at Cal in 1955, White started
his first Big Game, even though "I
was a skinny little guy. I wasn't
much of a factor."
He's been involved in every Big
Game since either as a Cal
player, Stanford assistant or Cal

head coach.
"He has immense respect for
the Big Game," Murphy says,
"and he's done a remarkable job
of maintaining a friendship with
all the Stanford people.
"I remember after last year's
game at Stanford. It was cold and
dark a couple hours after the
game when Mike finally left the
locker room. There was a group of
Stanford people waiting for him
outside and Mike was moved
almost to the point of tears."
Emotion will certainly play a
key role in tomorrow's Big Game,
and White is likely to supply a
good portion of it. "I'm not a
great technical football coach," he
says. "I don't spend 400 hours a
month watching films.
"The game's not as
complicated as most coaches
make it. Basically there's just a
certain frame of mind you need to
win football games."
And for Mike White, a certain
charm.

LOOKING UP—Cal coach Mike White changed his methods of
motivating players this season, and the difference is reflected in Cal's
7-2-1 record. Since White changed his style, things have been looking

Berkeley's Strawberry Canyon.

time in 23 years that a California
team has won eight games. Much
of the credit for Cal's 1974

success lies with quarterback
Steve. Bartkowski and explosive
running baqks Chuck Muncie and
Howard Strickland. But nobody
dares dispute White's influence.
''He's intelligent,
well-organized and dedicated,"
says Denver Broncos coach John
Ralston, Stanford's head coach
while White was offensive
coordinator here. "Mike has
intense personal pride."
"He's very emotional, very
sensitive, very magnetic," adds
Bob Murphy, former Stanford
sports information director and a
long-time friend of White's.
"Mike's been known to fight with
his players on the field, and he
thinks it's good for the players
and good for the team."
Two Faces
At Stanford, however, many
players resented White's fiery
tactics. Some, including standout
running back Jackie Brown, felt
White's on-the-field exhortations
were often insincere. "His main
technique," Brown recalls, "was
what we call 'two faces' telling
you one thing to your face and
then talking about you another
way when your back was turned."
Before the 1972 Rose Bowl,
starting fullback Hillary Shockley
angrily walked off the team when
White told him he had lost his
starting job, ostensibly because of
a minor injury. Shockley's
dissatisfaction with White was
widely known, and rumors
involving White's relations with
other black players flared a month
later when White was the leading
candidate for Stanford's vacated
head coaching position.
Some suspected that the black
players would boycott spring
practice en masse if White got the
job. White himself admits "he
heard some rumors," but said he
didn't think there "was much
substance in them."
Toughest Decision
Talk of protest was irrelevant,
however, as soon as White made
"truly the toughest decision in my
life," accepting the head coaching

job at his alma mater, California,
after both schools had made firm
offers.
"I don't think I could have
made a wrong decision," he said.
"I just told myself I'd make a
decision and then make it the
right one."
White's first two seasons at Cal
were difficult ones. The Bears
struggled to 3-8 and 4-7 records,
as White himself struggled to mold
his coaching style.
"Mike really builds a bond
with his players," Murphy said,
"and it was harder as a head coach
for him to detach himself from
the players."
White admits that the
transition was slow and painful. "I
finally realized that stability and
consistency are two key words as
a head coach," he said. "When
you're dealing with 55 guys
instead of 10 or 15 and you're
not dealing directly with each
segment every day you have to
take more of an administrative,
organizational approach. The last
two years have been a real
maturing experience for me."
White says, "I'm not a guy that
will set 20-year goals. I set
short-term goals and try to
accomplish them. I coach purely
for the kids. I feel I have
something to contribute in an
educational atmosphere I can
help teach kids about
themselves."
Stanford assistant coach
George Seifert says White
"sincerely loves the emotion of
football and he passes his
emotion on to his players."
Skinny Little Guy
Of course White's emotion
despite his mellower behavior this
year runs highest around Big
Game time. As a 145-pound
sophomore receiver/defensive
back at Cal in 1955, White started
his first Big Game, even though "I
was a skinny little guy. I wasn't
much of a factor."
He's been involved in every Big
Game since either as a Cal
player, Stanford assistant or Cal

head coach.
"He has immense respect for
the Big Game," Murphy says,
"and he's done a remarkable job
of maintaining a friendship with
all the Stanford people.
"I remember after last year's
game at Stanford. It was cold and
dark a couple hours after the
game when Mike finally left the
locker room. There was a group of
Stanford people waiting for him
outside and Mike was moved
almost to the point of tears."
Emotion will certainly play a
key role in tomorrow's Big Game,
and White is likely to supply a
good portion of it. "I'm not a
great technical football coach," he
says. "I don't spend 400 hours a
month watching films.
"The game's not as
complicated as most coaches
make it. Basically there's just a
certain frame of mind you need to
win football games."
And for Mike White, a certain
charm.

LOOKING UP—Cal coach Mike White changed his methods of
motivating players this season, and the difference is reflected in Cal's
7-2-1 record. Since White changed his style, things have been looking
up for Cal's football team, whose Pac-8 records had been as low as
Berkeley's Strawberry Canyon.
Mike White is young, suave,
handsome and articulate. He
dresses well, smiles a lot and
grasps your hand with authority.
- 'Hell," said Stanford Sports
Information Director Gary
Cavalli, "he could charm the pants

Of course it takes more than
charm to turn a floundering,
(.suspension-ridden football team

contender. And White, 38, who
will be participating in his 20th

at Berkeley, has accomplished a
miraculous revival in three short

"Mike's been known to fight with
his players on the field, and he
thinks it's good for the players
and good for the team."
Two Faces
At Stanford, however, many
players resented White's fiery
tactics. Some, including standout
running back Jackie Brown, felt
White's on-the-field exhortations
were often insincere. "His main
technique," Brown recalls, "was
what we call 'two faces' telling
you one thing to your face and
then talking about you another
way when your back was turned."
Before the 1972 Rose Bowl,
starting fullback Hillary Shockley
angrily walked off the team when
White told him he had lost his
starting job, ostensibly because of
a minor injury. Shockley's
dissatisfaction with White was
widely known, and rumors
involving White's relations with
other black players flared a month
later when White was the leading
candidate for Stanford's vacated
head coaching position.
Some suspected that the black
players would boycott spring
practice en masse if White got the
job. White himself admits "he
heard some rumors," but said he
didn't think there "was much
substance in them."
Toughest Decision
Talk of protest was irrelevant,
however, as soon as White made
"truly the toughest decision in my
life," accepting the head coaching

job at his alma mater, California,
after both schools had made firm
offers.
"I don't think I could have
made a wrong decision," he said.
"I just told myself I'd make a
decision and then make it the
right one."
White's first two seasons at Cal
were difficult ones. The Bears
struggled to 3-8 and 4-7 records,
as White himself struggled to mold
his coaching style.
"Mike really builds a bond
with his players," Murphy said,
"and it was harder as a head coach
for him to detach himself from
the players."
White admits that the
transition was slow and painful. "I
finally realized that stability and
consistency are two key words as
a head coach," he said. "When
you're dealing with 55 guys
instead of 10 or 15 and you're
not dealing directly with each
segment every day you have to
take more of an administrative,
organizational approach. The last
two years have been a real
maturing experience for me."
White says, "I'm not a guy that
will set 20-year goals. I set
short-term goals and try to
accomplish them. I coach purely
for the kids. I feel I have
something to contribute in an
educational atmosphere I can
help teach kids about
themselves."
Stanford assistant coach
George Seifert says White
"sincerely loves the emotion of
football and he passes his
emotion on to his players."
Skinny Little Guy
Of course White's emotion
despite his mellower behavior this
year runs highest around Big
Game time. As a 145-pound
sophomore receiver/defensive
back at Cal in 1955, White started
his first Big Game, even though "I
was a skinny little guy. I wasn't
much of a factor."
He's been involved in every Big
Game since either as a Cal
player, Stanford assistant or Cal

head coach.
"He has immense respect for
the Big Game," Murphy says,
"and he's done a remarkable job
of maintaining a friendship with
all the Stanford people.
"I remember after last year's
game at Stanford. It was cold and
dark a couple hours after the
game when Mike finally left the
locker room. There was a group of
Stanford people waiting for him
outside and Mike was moved
almost to the point of tears."
Emotion will certainly play a
key role in tomorrow's Big Game,
and White is likely to supply a
good portion of it. "I'm not a
great technical football coach," he
says. "I don't spend 400 hours a
month watching films.
"The game's not as
complicated as most coaches
make it. Basically there's just a
certain frame of mind you need to
win football games."
And for Mike White, a certain
charm.

LOOKING UP—Cal coach Mike White changed his methods of
motivating players this season, and the difference is reflected in Cal's
7-2-1 record. Since White changed his style, things have been looking
up for Cal's football team, whose Pac-8 records had been as low as
Berkeley's Strawberry Canyon.
Mike White is young, suave,
handsome and articulate. He
dresses well, smiles a lot and
grasps your hand with authority.
- 'Hell," said Stanford Sports
Information Director Gary
Cavalli, "he could charm the pants
off anybody."
Of course it takes more than
charm to turn a floundering,
(.suspension-ridden football team
into a Pacific Eight title
contender. And White, 38, who
will be participating in his 20th
consecutive Big Game tomorrow
at Berkeley, has accomplished a
miraculous revival in three short
years as California's head coach.
If the Bears beat Stanford
tomorrow, it will mark the first
time in 23 years that a California
team has won eight games. Much
of the credit for Cal's 1974

success lies with quarterback
Steve. Bartkowski and explosive
running baqks Chuck Muncie and
Howard Strickland. But nobody
dares dispute White's influence.
''He's intelligent,
well-organized and dedicated,"
says Denver Broncos coach John
Ralston, Stanford's head coach
while White was offensive
coordinator here. "Mike has
intense personal pride."
"He's very emotional, very
sensitive, very magnetic," adds
Bob Murphy, former Stanford
sports information director and a
long-time friend of White's.
"Mike's been known to fight with
his players on the field, and he
