[ Ca/'s defense is no great
[shakes, but Stanford hasn't
[scored more than the needec
[2l points but once this year,
[against Washington.
[ Meanwhile, USC and UCLA
[play. If Troy wins, it goes tc
the Rose Bowl. If UCLA wins,
the Pasadena bid would be in
doubt, pending several events
(see game preview).
We don't think you'll have
to memorize these possibilities.
USC always beats UCLA, and
this season, more than ever, the
Trojans are superior to the
Bruins, who are no better than
the fourth best team in the
league.
The other Pac-8 games bear
no relation to the Rose Bowl,
but still smack of traditional
rivalry.
Oregon-Oregon State is a
game called the "Civil War."
The only trouble is that how
the hell can Oregon win a Civil
War without any offense?
Answer: it can't.
In the week's toughest pick,
we'll take WSU over
Washington in Pullman. We
hope so, anyway. Getting
cheap shot master Jim Owens
fired would be the best thing
WSU could ever do for the
league.

[ Ca/'s defense is no great

[against Washington.
[ Meanwhile, USC and UCLA
[play. If Troy wins, it goes tc
the Rose Bowl. If UCLA wins,
the Pasadena bid would be in
doubt, pending several events
(see game preview).
We don't think you'll have
to memorize these possibilities.
USC always beats UCLA, and
this season, more than ever, the
Trojans are superior to the
Bruins, who are no better than
the fourth best team in the
league.
The other Pac-8 games bear
no relation to the Rose Bowl,
but still smack of traditional
rivalry.
Oregon-Oregon State is a
game called the "Civil War."
The only trouble is that how
the hell can Oregon win a Civil
War without any offense?
Answer: it can't.
In the week's toughest pick,
we'll take WSU over
Washington in Pullman. We
hope so, anyway. Getting
cheap shot master Jim Owens
fired would be the best thing
WSU could ever do for the
league.
Predictions
California 21, Stanford 20
USC 21, UCLA 10
Oregon St. 14, Oregon 7
Wash. St. 27, Washington 24
