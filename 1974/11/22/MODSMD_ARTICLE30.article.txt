# It's Always The Big Game, But This Year It's Bigger
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
There's some talk that when
the good ole boys down at SLAC
found that particle yesterday
morning, the first thing shouted
was not "Eureka!" but "We beat
Cal to it!"
Never have two schools been
such natural rivals in everything:
academics, nuclear physics,
student demonstrations, alumni
wealth and oh yes, football.
But behind the booze,
buffoonery, ballyhoo and bonfire
that makes the Big Game the
spectacle that it is, there's an
important meaning to tomorrow's
contest at Berkeley.
This season, the seeds of
Northern California football
power seem to have blown away
from Stanford toward Berkeley's
Strawberry Canyon.
And should the favored Golden
Bears win tomorrow's game,
Stanford will finish the year with
an ignominious 4-5-2 record, its
first losing season since 1963. The
Bears, meanwhile, would finish at
an impressive 8-2-1.
One would wonder, in that
case, whether those prize high

school recruits who want both
top-flight academics and a
winning football program might
begin flocking to Cal rather than
the Farm.
But that's all in the future. The
Big Game has significance in this
year's standings as well.
Should USC beat or tie UCLA,
as expected, then the winner of
the Big Game will finish a clear
second in the Pacific Eight with
an impressive 5-1-1 record.
Should UCLA upset USC, then
the Big Game victor would finish in
a three-way tie for the league
championship with the two
Southern schools.
If UCLA took USC while Cal
beat Stanford, the Bruins would
go to the Rose Bowl because the
Bruins would have beaten both
the Bears and Trojans.
Undecided
If both Stanford and UCLA
win tomorrow, even the Pac-8
Rose Bowl representative would
remain undecided for a week,
depending on what happened in
the USC-Notre Dame game.
Thus, ironically, a Stanford
win could save the Rose Bowl for
the Cards' other hated rival, USC.
Well, the Trojans will probably
win anyway, so USC-hating Card
fans needn't root against their
own team.
A crowd of 61,000 is expected
for the 1:30 game, which will be
broadcast live on KSFO (560 AM)
and KZSU (880 AM).
If 61,000 doesn't seem like
that big a crowd for the Big
Game, that's because it isn't. Most
Berkeley fans would rather stay at
home. Only an average of 32,099
people have attended the Bears'
games this season.
Mysterious Crowds
Why they don't come to the
games is a mystery. Cal has one of
the nation's most exciting
offenses, with more passing yards
than any other major university.
Leading the way, of course, is
blossoming quarterback Steve
Bartkowski. Bart started strong
and has gotten better every week.
"The big difference between
Cal and Stanford this season has
been the performance of the
quarterbacks," Card coach Jack
Christiansen said. "Otherwise, the
two teams are very similar."
Cal has thrown 62 times fewer

than Stanford but has still gained
208 yards more passing, which
effectively explains the difference
in the records of two very similar
teams.
"Both Cal and Stanford run
basically the same offense that
Mike White and 1 developed when
we were assistant coaches at
Stanford," Christiansen said.
Basically Similar
"Our basic looks, reads and
philosophies are the same," Chris
said. "The only differences are in
things caused by personnel."
In fact, Cal and Stanford,
except for a minor difference in
formation (Cal is in the T,
Stanford splits its backs) both

look something like the other
school did last year.
Stanford, of course, switched
from Mike Boryla drop-back to
Mike Cordova rollout. Cal
switched from Vince Ferragamo
rollout to Bartkowski drop-back.
As we said, very similar
offenses.
Cal's backs have had more
success than Stanford's this
season, because of more speed,
fewer injuries and a better passing
game to complement them. The
Bears' Chuck Muncie and Howard
Strickland have rushed for a total
of 1524 yards.
On defense, Cal and Stanford
are similarly similar, with both
schools playing a 3-4-4. The Bears'
personnel isn't as experienced as
Stanford's and gives up many

more yards, but has been tough
near the goal line. Nose guard Paul
Von der Mehden and linebacker
Ivan "The Terrible" Weiss are
especially fearsome.
Last week, Washington State
ran all over Oal in a 37-33 loss to
the Bears, who are weak against a
'veer'. Though Stanford will run
more than usual against Cat, it's
not likely Christiansen will junk
his whole passing offense in favor
of a veer.
So the two football teams,
both largely shaped by Stanford's
Rose Bowl years, play tomorrow.
If Cal wins, the Bears, bastard
sons of those years, might end up
as the true heirs.

Cardinal Notes: Defensive end
Roger Stillwell, suffering from the
after-effects of walking
pneumonia, is doubtful for the
game .. . Student rooter tickets
are still available for the game.
Cordova has thrown for 1476
yards and is the nation's seventh
leading passer under college
football's completions-per-game
ranking formula. But he has
completed only 44 percent of his
tries, compared to Bartkowski's
.570 completion average.
A Cal victory would pull the
Bears closer to Stanford in the Big
Game series standings. The Cards
lead 35-31-10.
"It's going to be a high scoring
game. We may need five
touchdowns to win," Bartkowski
predicts.
