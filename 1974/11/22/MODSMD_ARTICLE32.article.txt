# Suddenly An All-American
## Bart's Problems Not Serious 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
If the United States had Steve
Bartkowski's problems, we'd all be in great
shape. Gerald Ford might be wondering how
to best distribute the surplus $lO billion he
found laying around the White House.
The Cal quarterback's distressing dilemma
is, or was, whether to play professional
baseball or football. Poor guy. It was tough,
but last summer Bart decided to "make a
total commitment to football."
The result has been national prominence
for the 6-foot-4, 215-pound senior.
Relatively undistinguished at the beginning
of the season, many now consider
Bartkowski the best passer in the country.
This season, Bart has already eclipsed Cal
single season passing and total offense
records (2262 and 2094 yards respectively
with one game to go). He has passed for over
300 yards in each of his last two games,
netting 316 yards against Washington (also a
Cal record) and 304 yards against Washington
State.
Bartkowski has moved to second on Cal's
all-tirre passing list and needs 385 yards in
tomorrow's Big Game to wrest the number
one position from Craig Morton. The feat is
unlikely, but not impossible.
Scouts Drooling
The pro scouts in attendance tomorrow
will be drooling over Bart. They're as high on
him as he is on playing pro football.
"If he's available," says Matt Speedie of
the Denver Broncos, "Bartkowski will
probably be Denver's number one pick. He'll
be excellent in a pro-style offense.
Bartkowski is absolutely a first-rounder."
Norm Pollom of the Los Angeles Rams:
"Bartkowski gets top marks for delivery, size,
timing, poise and vision. From what I've
seen, he's definitely the best quarterback
prospect in the country."
Cal coach Mike White has been pushing
Bart as an Ail-American candidate. "If
Bartkowski hasn't convinced people now that
he's an Ail-American, he never will. He is a
true AU-Ameriean candidate in every sense of
the word.
Fast Development
"Bart has all the qualifications and
qualities of an Ail-American quarterback. I
saw them in Craig Morton here and in Jim
Plunkett at Stanford, but when you consider
how much more playing time Craig and Jim
had, Bart's development has been
unbelievable."
If White is prejudiced toward his own
quarterback, rival coaches Jim Owens of
Washington and good ole John McKay at
USC have no reason to be.
"Bartkowski is one of the best
quarterbacks in the country," McKay said.

"No quarterback did what he did to us this
year."
Owens added, "I can't ever remember
anyone passing the ball better in Husky
Stadium ever." Owens has coached at
Washington for 18 years.
Washington not only lost that game to
Cal, but surrendered at least one fan too.
Kathi Arnason, a 19-year-old sophomore, was
one of the "Husky Honeys" sent to Cal's
hotel in Seattle to welcome the team. A
writer introduced Bart to her as a handsome
player who'd soon be very rich. "As soon as I
met Steve I knew that I was a Cal fan," she
said later. "Actually, I rooted for the Bears
against the Huskies."
'Something Clicked'
Prince Charming didn't mind.
" . . . . Something sort of clicked when we
were introduced," he said. "I know it sounds
kind of corny | agreed | but it was, you know,
like love at first sight. We talked for a long
time. The more we talked, the more I
realized she was somebody special to me."
So Kathi came down for Cal's next game.
Bart also had another date in the stands. Ah,
what problems . . .
What a season . . . when things go right,
things go right.
In retrospect, it's easy to say Bartkowski's

decision to concentrate on football at the -
expense of baseball was the right one. But
baseball used to seem the logical choice.
Bart was a proven catcher with major
league potential, but as a quarterback his
playing time was severely limited by injuries
and ex-Cal quarterback Vince Ferragamo.
Only this year will Bartkowski have
completed an entire season as Cal's starting
quarterback.
As a catcher, Bart set Cal single season and
career home run records (12 and 17
respectively) and hit .344. Major league
scouts urged him to quit school and sign a
contract. Yet Bart's preference remained
football.
So for the first time, Bart didn't play
baseball last summer and devoted his time to
constantly throwing the football. "1 made up
my mind that I was going to fight Ferragamo
for the job," he said, apparently disturbed
that the younger Ferragamo had come out
ahead in the past.
Baseball Incident
Ferragamo's defection to Nebraska
simplified Bartkowski's task. Bart was hardly
tearful over the loss, but realized he would
have to perform as a starter to remain one.
"I felt I had to prove to a lot of people that I
could play football."
Bartkowski's intensity and competitive
nature nearly got him in trouble two years
ago in an incident at Stanford. While Cal was
losing a baseball doubleheader to Stanford, a
group of slightly intoxicated students in the
stands began to taunt Cal's pitcher.
Some of the students had apparently
played against the pitcher as freshmen and
had accused him of throwing at them. The
fans continued to "ride" the pitcher while
also directing chants of "We want
Ferragamo" toward Bartkowski.
After losing both games Bart decided to
take out his frustrations against the students.
He followed the dissidents as they entered
their cars.
According to Stanford baseball coach Ray
Young, Bart "asked or pulled" one of them
out of his car and hit him in the mouth,
almost breaking his jaw. Young said at one
time there was a possibility of a lawsuit and
an assault and battery charge against
Bartkowski, but apparently nothing came of
it.
If you can't make it to Berkeley
tomorrow, Bartkowski will appear in the
East-West Shrine Came Dec. 28 at Stanford
Stadium, assuming he accepts his invitation.
Should you be away then, there's a decent
chance he may be playing in Candlestick Park
next year for the 49ers.
Hmmmm .. . maybe Bart does have a
serious problem . . .

Stadium, assuming he accepts his invitation.
Should you be away then, there's a decent
chance he may be playing in Candlestick Park
next year for the 49ers.
Hmmmm .. . maybe Bart does have a
serious problem . . .

Steve Bartkowski
If the United States had Steve
Bartkowski's problems, we'd all be in great
shape. Gerald Ford might be wondering how
to best distribute the surplus $lO billion he
found laying around the White House.
The Cal quarterback's distressing dilemma
is, or was, whether to play professional
baseball or football. Poor guy. It was tough,
but last summer Bart decided to "make a
total commitment to football."
The result has been national prominence
for the 6-foot-4, 215-pound senior.
Relatively undistinguished at the beginning
of the season, many now consider
Bartkowski the best passer in the country.
This season, Bart has already eclipsed Cal
single season passing and total offense
records (2262 and 2094 yards respectively
with one game to go). He has passed for over
300 yards in each of his last two games,
netting 316 yards against Washington (also a
Cal record) and 304 yards against Washington
State.
Bartkowski has moved to second on Cal's
all-tirre passing list and needs 385 yards in
tomorrow's Big Game to wrest the number
one position from Craig Morton. The feat is
unlikely, but not impossible.
Scouts Drooling
The pro scouts in attendance tomorrow
will be drooling over Bart. They're as high on
him as he is on playing pro football.
"If he's available," says Matt Speedie of
the Denver Broncos, "Bartkowski will
probably be Denver's number one pick. He'll
be excellent in a pro-style offense.
Bartkowski is absolutely a first-rounder."
Norm Pollom of the Los Angeles Rams:
"Bartkowski gets top marks for delivery, size,
timing, poise and vision. From what I've
seen, he's definitely the best quarterback
prospect in the country."
Cal coach Mike White has been pushing
Bart as an Ail-American candidate. "If
Bartkowski hasn't convinced people now that
he's an Ail-American, he never will. He is a
true AU-Ameriean candidate in every sense of
the word.
Fast Development
"Bart has all the qualifications and
qualities of an Ail-American quarterback. I
saw them in Craig Morton here and in Jim
Plunkett at Stanford, but when you consider
how much more playing time Craig and Jim
had, Bart's development has been
unbelievable."
If White is prejudiced toward his own
quarterback, rival coaches Jim Owens of
Washington and good ole John McKay at
USC have no reason to be.
"Bartkowski is one of the best
quarterbacks in the country," McKay said.

"No quarterback did what he did to us this
year."
Owens added, "I can't ever remember
anyone passing the ball better in Husky
Stadium ever." Owens has coached at
Washington for 18 years.
Washington not only lost that game to
Cal, but surrendered at least one fan too.
Kathi Arnason, a 19-year-old sophomore, was
one of the "Husky Honeys" sent to Cal's
hotel in Seattle to welcome the team. A
writer introduced Bart to her as a handsome
player who'd soon be very rich. "As soon as I
met Steve I knew that I was a Cal fan," she
said later. "Actually, I rooted for the Bears
against the Huskies."
'Something Clicked'
Prince Charming didn't mind.
" . . . . Something sort of clicked when we
were introduced," he said. "I know it sounds
kind of corny | agreed | but it was, you know,
like love at first sight. We talked for a long
time. The more we talked, the more I
realized she was somebody special to me."
So Kathi came down for Cal's next game.
Bart also had another date in the stands. Ah,
what problems . . .
What a season . . . when things go right,
things go right.
In retrospect, it's easy to say Bartkowski's

decision to concentrate on football at the -
expense of baseball was the right one. But
baseball used to seem the logical choice.
Bart was a proven catcher with major
league potential, but as a quarterback his
playing time was severely limited by injuries
and ex-Cal quarterback Vince Ferragamo.
Only this year will Bartkowski have
completed an entire season as Cal's starting
quarterback.
As a catcher, Bart set Cal single season and
career home run records (12 and 17
respectively) and hit .344. Major league
scouts urged him to quit school and sign a
contract. Yet Bart's preference remained
football.
So for the first time, Bart didn't play
baseball last summer and devoted his time to
constantly throwing the football. "1 made up
my mind that I was going to fight Ferragamo
for the job," he said, apparently disturbed
that the younger Ferragamo had come out
ahead in the past.
Baseball Incident
Ferragamo's defection to Nebraska
simplified Bartkowski's task. Bart was hardly
tearful over the loss, but realized he would
have to perform as a starter to remain one.
"I felt I had to prove to a lot of people that I
could play football."
Bartkowski's intensity and competitive
nature nearly got him in trouble two years
ago in an incident at Stanford. While Cal was
losing a baseball doubleheader to Stanford, a
group of slightly intoxicated students in the
stands began to taunt Cal's pitcher.
Some of the students had apparently
played against the pitcher as freshmen and
had accused him of throwing at them. The
fans continued to "ride" the pitcher while
also directing chants of "We want
Ferragamo" toward Bartkowski.
After losing both games Bart decided to
take out his frustrations against the students.
He followed the dissidents as they entered
their cars.
According to Stanford baseball coach Ray
Young, Bart "asked or pulled" one of them
out of his car and hit him in the mouth,
almost breaking his jaw. Young said at one
time there was a possibility of a lawsuit and
an assault and battery charge against
Bartkowski, but apparently nothing came of
it.
If you can't make it to Berkeley
tomorrow, Bartkowski will appear in the
East-West Shrine Came Dec. 28 at Stanford
Stadium, assuming he accepts his invitation.
Should you be away then, there's a decent
chance he may be playing in Candlestick Park
next year for the 49ers.
Hmmmm .. . maybe Bart does have a

time there was a possibility of a lawsuit and
an assault and battery charge against
Bartkowski, but apparently nothing came of
it.
If you can't make it to Berkeley
tomorrow, Bartkowski will appear in the
East-West Shrine Came Dec. 28 at Stanford
Stadium, assuming he accepts his invitation.
Should you be away then, there's a decent
chance he may be playing in Candlestick Park
next year for the 49ers.
Hmmmm .. . maybe Bart does have a
serious problem . . .

Steve Bartkowski
If the United States had Steve
Bartkowski's problems, we'd all be in great
shape. Gerald Ford might be wondering how
to best distribute the surplus $lO billion he
found laying around the White House.
The Cal quarterback's distressing dilemma
is, or was, whether to play professional
baseball or football. Poor guy. It was tough,
but last summer Bart decided to "make a
total commitment to football."
The result has been national prominence
for the 6-foot-4, 215-pound senior.
Relatively undistinguished at the beginning
of the season, many now consider
Bartkowski the best passer in the country.
This season, Bart has already eclipsed Cal
single season passing and total offense
records (2262 and 2094 yards respectively
with one game to go). He has passed for over
300 yards in each of his last two games,
netting 316 yards against Washington (also a
Cal record) and 304 yards against Washington
State.
Bartkowski has moved to second on Cal's
all-tirre passing list and needs 385 yards in
tomorrow's Big Game to wrest the number
one position from Craig Morton. The feat is
unlikely, but not impossible.
Scouts Drooling
The pro scouts in attendance tomorrow
will be drooling over Bart. They're as high on
him as he is on playing pro football.
"If he's available," says Matt Speedie of
the Denver Broncos, "Bartkowski will
probably be Denver's number one pick. He'll
be excellent in a pro-style offense.
Bartkowski is absolutely a first-rounder."
Norm Pollom of the Los Angeles Rams:
"Bartkowski gets top marks for delivery, size,
timing, poise and vision. From what I've
seen, he's definitely the best quarterback
prospect in the country."
Cal coach Mike White has been pushing
Bart as an Ail-American candidate. "If
Bartkowski hasn't convinced people now that
he's an Ail-American, he never will. He is a
true AU-Ameriean candidate in every sense of
the word.
Fast Development
"Bart has all the qualifications and
qualities of an Ail-American quarterback. I
saw them in Craig Morton here and in Jim
Plunkett at Stanford, but when you consider
how much more playing time Craig and Jim
had, Bart's development has been
unbelievable."
If White is prejudiced toward his own
quarterback, rival coaches Jim Owens of
Washington and good ole John McKay at
USC have no reason to be.
"Bartkowski is one of the best
quarterbacks in the country," McKay said.

"No quarterback did what he did to us this
year."
Owens added, "I can't ever remember
anyone passing the ball better in Husky
Stadium ever." Owens has coached at
Washington for 18 years.
Washington not only lost that game to
Cal, but surrendered at least one fan too.
Kathi Arnason, a 19-year-old sophomore, was
one of the "Husky Honeys" sent to Cal's
hotel in Seattle to welcome the team. A
writer introduced Bart to her as a handsome
player who'd soon be very rich. "As soon as I
met Steve I knew that I was a Cal fan," she
said later. "Actually, I rooted for the Bears
against the Huskies."
'Something Clicked'
Prince Charming didn't mind.
" . . . . Something sort of clicked when we
were introduced," he said. "I know it sounds
kind of corny | agreed | but it was, you know,
like love at first sight. We talked for a long
time. The more we talked, the more I
realized she was somebody special to me."
So Kathi came down for Cal's next game.
Bart also had another date in the stands. Ah,
what problems . . .
What a season . . . when things go right,
things go right.
In retrospect, it's easy to say Bartkowski's

decision to concentrate on football at the -
expense of baseball was the right one. But
baseball used to seem the logical choice.
Bart was a proven catcher with major
league potential, but as a quarterback his
playing time was severely limited by injuries
and ex-Cal quarterback Vince Ferragamo.
Only this year will Bartkowski have
completed an entire season as Cal's starting
quarterback.
As a catcher, Bart set Cal single season and
career home run records (12 and 17
respectively) and hit .344. Major league
scouts urged him to quit school and sign a
contract. Yet Bart's preference remained
football.
So for the first time, Bart didn't play
baseball last summer and devoted his time to
constantly throwing the football. "1 made up
my mind that I was going to fight Ferragamo
for the job," he said, apparently disturbed
that the younger Ferragamo had come out
ahead in the past.
Baseball Incident
Ferragamo's defection to Nebraska
simplified Bartkowski's task. Bart was hardly
tearful over the loss, but realized he would
have to perform as a starter to remain one.
"I felt I had to prove to a lot of people that I
could play football."
Bartkowski's intensity and competitive
nature nearly got him in trouble two years
ago in an incident at Stanford. While Cal was
losing a baseball doubleheader to Stanford, a
group of slightly intoxicated students in the
stands began to taunt Cal's pitcher.
Some of the students had apparently
played against the pitcher as freshmen and
had accused him of throwing at them. The
fans continued to "ride" the pitcher while
also directing chants of "We want
Ferragamo" toward Bartkowski.
After losing both games Bart decided to
take out his frustrations against the students.
He followed the dissidents as they entered
their cars.
According to Stanford baseball coach Ray
Young, Bart "asked or pulled" one of them
out of his car and hit him in the mouth,
almost breaking his jaw. Young said at one
time there was a possibility of a lawsuit and
an assault and battery charge against
Bartkowski, but apparently nothing came of
it.
If you can't make it to Berkeley
tomorrow, Bartkowski will appear in the
East-West Shrine Came Dec. 28 at Stanford
Stadium, assuming he accepts his invitation.
Should you be away then, there's a decent
chance he may be playing in Candlestick Park
next year for the 49ers.

take out his frustrations against the students.
He followed the dissidents as they entered
their cars.
According to Stanford baseball coach Ray
Young, Bart "asked or pulled" one of them
out of his car and hit him in the mouth,
almost breaking his jaw. Young said at one
time there was a possibility of a lawsuit and
an assault and battery charge against
Bartkowski, but apparently nothing came of
it.
If you can't make it to Berkeley
tomorrow, Bartkowski will appear in the
East-West Shrine Came Dec. 28 at Stanford
Stadium, assuming he accepts his invitation.
Should you be away then, there's a decent
chance he may be playing in Candlestick Park
next year for the 49ers.
Hmmmm .. . maybe Bart does have a
serious problem . . .
