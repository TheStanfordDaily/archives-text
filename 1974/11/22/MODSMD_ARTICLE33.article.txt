# An Idiot Named Billy Erb Had An Axe-ellent Idea
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Billy Erb holds a secure place
in Stanford history. On this
statement there can be little
disagreement.
Just what that place is, though,
is open for debate. Billy Erb may
either have been one of the most
crafty, dedicated men ever to
attend this University or he
may have been the biggest
imbecile ever to set foot on
campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man
responsible for all this Axe
madness. You see, in 1899, he
feared Stanford was about to
blow a three-game baseball series
to Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound axe
to a pre-game rally and amused
the crowd by hacking up a
dummy bear. Then Erb, who was
the kind Of guy who would have
starred in The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre if he were around today,
took the Axe to the game and
spent a couple of hours chopping
up blue and gold ribbons.
Decapitation
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Berkeley
band members with decapitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game 9-7,
but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of Cal thugs jumped Erb
and the other guardians (including
Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and raced
off. They, outwitted their
Stanford pursuers not too
tough if Billy Erb can be
considered typical and got it
back to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been reading

along and thinking that Billy Erb
was um, unique then brace
yourself. Billy Erb had a friend
named Harry Dutton. And in any
discussion of great moments of
Stanford history, Harry Dutton's
name must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers got
back to their campus, they held a
spontaneous rally. Enter Harry
Dutton, just as dedicated to God,
flag and Stanford as Billy Erb.
Dutton, on horseback, rode into
the middle of the crowd and
suggested to the Cal men that
they hand him the Axe so
everyone could see it.
They agreed but
unfortunately the Cal men held
onto the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run away.
Luckily, Harry Dutton was no
faint-heart. After the rally the
Axe was taken to the Chi Phi
fraternity house, and Dutton
turned up there in a false
mustache with a note instructing
the frat men to turn the Axe over
to him so he could paint it. The
painfully naive Cal students
handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no dummy,
despite what you might think
after reading all this. He did not
consider it his destiny to go down
in infamy as the man who lost
Stanford's Axe. No sir, not Billy
Erb.
So, late one night Chi Phi men
awoke to the gently sounds of a
battering ram on their door. Billy
Erb was leading a raiding party in
a desperate last-ditch attempt to
regain the Axe.
Kill For Axe
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, saw the group enter. He

snatched an ancient army sword
from the wall and snarled "I'll kill
the first man who starts up these
stairs." Obviously he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his car and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house but they couldn't find
the Axe. Sadder (but probably no
wiser) they returned to the Farm
empty-handed. Not until 1930
would honor and justice be
restored at Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long-gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would be a
much different story. Now the
Immortal 21 took over the quest.
For three years they, schemed and
plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930,
they were ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper photographers
promising fame and fortune to the
dim-witted Cal freshmen who
were carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs the first time
during the long Cal-Stanford
rivalry that anyone ever resorted
to chemical warfare.

Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car, and
they headed back for Palo Alto at
a torrid 65 miles an hour. Other
members of the Immortal 21
posed as Cal students and formed
search, parties to go in the
opposite direction of the escape
route.
What A Celebration
It worked. When the Immortal
21 got back to campus:
—classes were cancelled for two
days;
—the campus partied all night;
—the University presented
them with block 'S' letters, the
highest symbol of Stanford valor
and achievement, and special gold
Axe watch charms.
'They have won the gratitude
of every Stanford alumnus from
the White House to San Quentin,"
the student body applauded.
But the taste of victory quickly
turned bitter. The Stanford
administration, composed of men
with brainpans about the same
size as Billy Erb's, signed a pact
with Cal, making the Axe into a
trophy going to the winner of
each autumn's Big Game.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time to
time. But since 1930, only one
group has pulled off a heist that
can truly be said to be in the
grand tradition of Billy Erb, Harry
Dutton and the Immortal 21.

Thev called themselves,
appropriately, the Infamous
Three. Residents of Theta Delta
Chi, they concluded that Cal
didn't deserve possessing of the
Axe for its last second 24-21
victory in 1972 in a game since
known as the Mud Bowl.
Justice. they concluded,
demanded that the Axe return to
Stanford. So last fall they devised
a plot to bring it back.
Looking at the plot with one
year's hindsight, it seems far too
stupid to ever succeed. But
remember: Cal students are
stupid. That's why they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claim to be Bear
coach Mike White and ask if the -
Axe could be photographed with
two "football players" at a
football writer's banquet at Ming's
in Palo Alto. >
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we figured
no one else did either," said David
Suliteanu, now a senior. It worked
perfectly: the student union
manager agreed to hand over the
Axe. But when Suliteanu and the
now-graduated Tim
showed up in Cal letter jackets, it.

CARRYING THE WORD—In the noble tradition of Stanford overseas campuses, these students at

student union manager, who
agreed to call the Axe
Commission and get the Axe. He
did, although the guards insisted it
go to Palo Alto in their car. Matt
Conway, Tim's older brother and
the third conspirator, made a

quick call to the Theta Delt house
and told them to have a
contingent waiting at Ming's,
where it was no contest.
"Except for some jail time, we
had nothing to lose," the
Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the theft.
"It had only been 30-odd years
since the last theft; and the Axe
was only encased in a nuclear
attack-proof case with an alarm
system; and what should it matter
if it was Big Game week and the
Axe was the center of attention
for the entire community?"
Only a school with Cal's
ineptitude could lose thp Axe

under those circumstances. And
the Bears very nearly didn't get it
back. The Infamous Three, feeling
powerful after such a brazen
theft, issued a list of
"non-negotiable" demands to the
Stanford administration which
had to be met before th£ Axe
would be returned.
They included $6OOO cash.

Immortal 21 took over the quest.
For three years they, schemed and
plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930,
they were ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper photographers
promising fame and fortune to the
dim-witted Cal freshmen who
were carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs the first time
during the long Cal-Stanford
rivalry that anyone ever resorted
to chemical warfare.

Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car, and
they headed back for Palo Alto at
a torrid 65 miles an hour. Other
members of the Immortal 21
posed as Cal students and formed
search, parties to go in the
opposite direction of the escape
route.
What A Celebration
It worked. When the Immortal
21 got back to campus:
—classes were cancelled for two
days;
—the campus partied all night;
—the University presented
them with block 'S' letters, the
highest symbol of Stanford valor
and achievement, and special gold
Axe watch charms.
'They have won the gratitude
of every Stanford alumnus from
the White House to San Quentin,"
the student body applauded.
But the taste of victory quickly
turned bitter. The Stanford
administration, composed of men
with brainpans about the same
size as Billy Erb's, signed a pact
with Cal, making the Axe into a
trophy going to the winner of
each autumn's Big Game.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time to
time. But since 1930, only one
group has pulled off a heist that
can truly be said to be in the
grand tradition of Billy Erb, Harry
Dutton and the Immortal 21.

Thev called themselves,
appropriately, the Infamous
Three. Residents of Theta Delta
Chi, they concluded that Cal
didn't deserve possessing of the
Axe for its last second 24-21
victory in 1972 in a game since
known as the Mud Bowl.
Justice. they concluded,
demanded that the Axe return to
Stanford. So last fall they devised
a plot to bring it back.
Looking at the plot with one
year's hindsight, it seems far too
stupid to ever succeed. But
remember: Cal students are
stupid. That's why they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claim to be Bear
coach Mike White and ask if the -
Axe could be photographed with
two "football players" at a
football writer's banquet at Ming's
in Palo Alto. >
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we figured
no one else did either," said David
Suliteanu, now a senior. It worked
perfectly: the student union
manager agreed to hand over the
Axe. But when Suliteanu and the
now-graduated Tim
showed up in Cal letter jackets, it.

CARRYING THE WORD—In the noble tradition of Stanford overseas campuses, these students at

agreed to call the Axe
Commission and get the Axe. He
did, although the guards insisted it
go to Palo Alto in their car. Matt
Conway, Tim's older brother and
the third conspirator, made a

quick call to the Theta Delt house
and told them to have a
contingent waiting at Ming's,
where it was no contest.
"Except for some jail time, we
had nothing to lose," the
Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the theft.
"It had only been 30-odd years
since the last theft; and the Axe
was only encased in a nuclear
attack-proof case with an alarm
system; and what should it matter
if it was Big Game week and the
Axe was the center of attention
for the entire community?"
Only a school with Cal's
ineptitude could lose thp Axe

under those circumstances. And
the Bears very nearly didn't get it
back. The Infamous Three, feeling
powerful after such a brazen
theft, issued a list of
"non-negotiable" demands to the
Stanford administration which
had to be met before th£ Axe
would be returned.
They included $6OOO cash.

Billy Erb would have been
proud.
Billy Erb holds a secure place
in Stanford history. On this
statement there can be little
disagreement.
Just what that place is, though,
is open for debate. Billy Erb may
either have been one of the most
crafty, dedicated men ever to
attend this University or he
may have been the biggest
imbecile ever to set foot on
campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man
responsible for all this Axe
madness. You see, in 1899, he
feared Stanford was about to
blow a three-game baseball series
to Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound axe
to a pre-game rally and amused
the crowd by hacking up a
dummy bear. Then Erb, who was
the kind Of guy who would have
starred in The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre if he were around today,
took the Axe to the game and
spent a couple of hours chopping
up blue and gold ribbons.
Decapitation
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Berkeley
band members with decapitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game 9-7,
but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of Cal thugs jumped Erb
and the other guardians (including
Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and raced
off. They, outwitted their
Stanford pursuers not too
tough if Billy Erb can be
considered typical and got it
back to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been reading

along and thinking that Billy Erb
was um, unique then brace
yourself. Billy Erb had a friend
named Harry Dutton. And in any
discussion of great moments of
Stanford history, Harry Dutton's
name must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers got
back to their campus, they held a
spontaneous rally. Enter Harry
Dutton, just as dedicated to God,
flag and Stanford as Billy Erb.
Dutton, on horseback, rode into
the middle of the crowd and
suggested to the Cal men that
they hand him the Axe so
everyone could see it.
They agreed but
unfortunately the Cal men held
onto the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run away.
Luckily, Harry Dutton was no
faint-heart. After the rally the
Axe was taken to the Chi Phi
fraternity house, and Dutton
turned up there in a false
mustache with a note instructing
the frat men to turn the Axe over
to him so he could paint it. The
painfully naive Cal students
handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no dummy,
despite what you might think
after reading all this. He did not
consider it his destiny to go down
in infamy as the man who lost
Stanford's Axe. No sir, not Billy
Erb.
So, late one night Chi Phi men
awoke to the gently sounds of a
battering ram on their door. Billy
Erb was leading a raiding party in
a desperate last-ditch attempt to
regain the Axe.
Kill For Axe
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, saw the group enter. He

snatched an ancient army sword
from the wall and snarled "I'll kill
the first man who starts up these
stairs." Obviously he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his car and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house but they couldn't find
the Axe. Sadder (but probably no
wiser) they returned to the Farm
empty-handed. Not until 1930
would honor and justice be
restored at Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long-gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would be a
much different story. Now the
Immortal 21 took over the quest.
For three years they, schemed and
plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930,
they were ready.

the third conspirator, made a

quick call to the Theta Delt house
and told them to have a
contingent waiting at Ming's,
where it was no contest.
"Except for some jail time, we
had nothing to lose," the
Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the theft.
"It had only been 30-odd years
since the last theft; and the Axe
was only encased in a nuclear
attack-proof case with an alarm
system; and what should it matter
if it was Big Game week and the
Axe was the center of attention
for the entire community?"
Only a school with Cal's
ineptitude could lose thp Axe

under those circumstances. And
the Bears very nearly didn't get it
back. The Infamous Three, feeling
powerful after such a brazen
theft, issued a list of
"non-negotiable" demands to the
Stanford administration which
had to be met before th£ Axe
would be returned.
They included $6OOO cash.

Billy Erb would have been
proud.
Billy Erb holds a secure place
in Stanford history. On this
statement there can be little
disagreement.
Just what that place is, though,
is open for debate. Billy Erb may
either have been one of the most
crafty, dedicated men ever to
attend this University or he
may have been the biggest
imbecile ever to set foot on
campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man
responsible for all this Axe
madness. You see, in 1899, he
feared Stanford was about to
blow a three-game baseball series
to Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound axe
to a pre-game rally and amused
the crowd by hacking up a
dummy bear. Then Erb, who was
the kind Of guy who would have
starred in The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre if he were around today,
took the Axe to the game and
spent a couple of hours chopping
up blue and gold ribbons.
Decapitation
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Berkeley
band members with decapitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game 9-7,
but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of Cal thugs jumped Erb
and the other guardians (including
Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and raced
off. They, outwitted their
Stanford pursuers not too
tough if Billy Erb can be
considered typical and got it
back to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been reading

along and thinking that Billy Erb
was um, unique then brace
yourself. Billy Erb had a friend
named Harry Dutton. And in any
discussion of great moments of
Stanford history, Harry Dutton's
name must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers got
back to their campus, they held a
spontaneous rally. Enter Harry
Dutton, just as dedicated to God,
flag and Stanford as Billy Erb.
Dutton, on horseback, rode into
the middle of the crowd and
suggested to the Cal men that
they hand him the Axe so
everyone could see it.
They agreed but
unfortunately the Cal men held
onto the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run away.
Luckily, Harry Dutton was no
faint-heart. After the rally the
Axe was taken to the Chi Phi
fraternity house, and Dutton
turned up there in a false
mustache with a note instructing
the frat men to turn the Axe over
to him so he could paint it. The
painfully naive Cal students
handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no dummy,
despite what you might think
after reading all this. He did not
consider it his destiny to go down
in infamy as the man who lost
Stanford's Axe. No sir, not Billy
Erb.
So, late one night Chi Phi men
awoke to the gently sounds of a
battering ram on their door. Billy
Erb was leading a raiding party in
a desperate last-ditch attempt to
regain the Axe.
Kill For Axe
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, saw the group enter. He

snatched an ancient army sword
from the wall and snarled "I'll kill
the first man who starts up these
stairs." Obviously he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his car and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house but they couldn't find
the Axe. Sadder (but probably no
wiser) they returned to the Farm
empty-handed. Not until 1930
would honor and justice be
restored at Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long-gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would be a
much different story. Now the
Immortal 21 took over the quest.
For three years they, schemed and
plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930,
they were ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper photographers
promising fame and fortune to the
dim-witted Cal freshmen who
were carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs the first time
during the long Cal-Stanford
rivalry that anyone ever resorted
to chemical warfare.

Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car, and
they headed back for Palo Alto at
a torrid 65 miles an hour. Other
members of the Immortal 21
posed as Cal students and formed
search, parties to go in the
opposite direction of the escape
route.
What A Celebration
It worked. When the Immortal
21 got back to campus:
—classes were cancelled for two
days;
—the campus partied all night;
—the University presented
them with block 'S' letters, the
highest symbol of Stanford valor
and achievement, and special gold
Axe watch charms.
'They have won the gratitude
of every Stanford alumnus from
the White House to San Quentin,"
the student body applauded.
But the taste of victory quickly
turned bitter. The Stanford
administration, composed of men
with brainpans about the same
size as Billy Erb's, signed a pact
with Cal, making the Axe into a
trophy going to the winner of
each autumn's Big Game.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time to
time. But since 1930, only one
group has pulled off a heist that
can truly be said to be in the
grand tradition of Billy Erb, Harry
Dutton and the Immortal 21.

Thev called themselves,
appropriately, the Infamous
Three. Residents of Theta Delta
Chi, they concluded that Cal
didn't deserve possessing of the
Axe for its last second 24-21
victory in 1972 in a game since
known as the Mud Bowl.
Justice. they concluded,
demanded that the Axe return to
Stanford. So last fall they devised
a plot to bring it back.
Looking at the plot with one
year's hindsight, it seems far too
stupid to ever succeed. But
remember: Cal students are
stupid. That's why they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claim to be Bear
coach Mike White and ask if the -
Axe could be photographed with
two "football players" at a
football writer's banquet at Ming's
in Palo Alto. >
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we figured
no one else did either," said David
Suliteanu, now a senior. It worked
perfectly: the student union
manager agreed to hand over the
Axe. But when Suliteanu and the
now-graduated Tim
showed up in Cal letter jackets, it.

into the fray. Erb was no dummy,
despite what you might think
after reading all this. He did not
consider it his destiny to go down
in infamy as the man who lost
Stanford's Axe. No sir, not Billy
Erb.
So, late one night Chi Phi men
awoke to the gently sounds of a
battering ram on their door. Billy
Erb was leading a raiding party in
a desperate last-ditch attempt to
regain the Axe.
Kill For Axe
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, saw the group enter. He

snatched an ancient army sword
from the wall and snarled "I'll kill
the first man who starts up these
stairs." Obviously he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his car and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house but they couldn't find
the Axe. Sadder (but probably no
wiser) they returned to the Farm
empty-handed. Not until 1930
would honor and justice be
restored at Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long-gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would be a
much different story. Now the
Immortal 21 took over the quest.
For three years they, schemed and
plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930,
they were ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper photographers
promising fame and fortune to the
dim-witted Cal freshmen who
were carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs the first time
during the long Cal-Stanford
rivalry that anyone ever resorted
to chemical warfare.

Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car, and
they headed back for Palo Alto at
a torrid 65 miles an hour. Other
members of the Immortal 21
posed as Cal students and formed
search, parties to go in the
opposite direction of the escape
route.
What A Celebration
It worked. When the Immortal
21 got back to campus:
—classes were cancelled for two
days;
—the campus partied all night;
—the University presented
them with block 'S' letters, the
highest symbol of Stanford valor
and achievement, and special gold
Axe watch charms.
'They have won the gratitude
of every Stanford alumnus from
the White House to San Quentin,"
the student body applauded.
But the taste of victory quickly
turned bitter. The Stanford
administration, composed of men
with brainpans about the same
size as Billy Erb's, signed a pact
with Cal, making the Axe into a
trophy going to the winner of
each autumn's Big Game.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time to
time. But since 1930, only one
group has pulled off a heist that
can truly be said to be in the
grand tradition of Billy Erb, Harry
Dutton and the Immortal 21.

Thev called themselves,
appropriately, the Infamous
Three. Residents of Theta Delta
Chi, they concluded that Cal
didn't deserve possessing of the
Axe for its last second 24-21
victory in 1972 in a game since
known as the Mud Bowl.
Justice. they concluded,
demanded that the Axe return to
Stanford. So last fall they devised
a plot to bring it back.
Looking at the plot with one
year's hindsight, it seems far too
stupid to ever succeed. But
remember: Cal students are
stupid. That's why they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claim to be Bear
coach Mike White and ask if the -
Axe could be photographed with
two "football players" at a
football writer's banquet at Ming's
in Palo Alto. >
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we figured
no one else did either," said David
Suliteanu, now a senior. It worked
perfectly: the student union
manager agreed to hand over the
Axe. But when Suliteanu and the
now-graduated Tim
showed up in Cal letter jackets, it.

CARRYING THE WORD—In the noble tradition of Stanford overseas campuses, these students at
"Stanford-in-Africa," Dr. Jane Goodall's Gombe Stream Research Center in Tanzania, decided to educate
some of the native simians. Rumor has it the chimpanzees, all of whom were honor graduates of Cal,

tear-jerking performance to the
student union manager, who
agreed to call the Axe
Commission and get the Axe. He
did, although the guards insisted it
go to Palo Alto in their car. Matt
Conway, Tim's older brother and
the third conspirator, made a

quick call to the Theta Delt house
and told them to have a
contingent waiting at Ming's,
where it was no contest.
"Except for some jail time, we
had nothing to lose," the
Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the theft.
"It had only been 30-odd years
since the last theft; and the Axe
was only encased in a nuclear
attack-proof case with an alarm
system; and what should it matter
if it was Big Game week and the
Axe was the center of attention
for the entire community?"
Only a school with Cal's
ineptitude could lose thp Axe

under those circumstances. And
the Bears very nearly didn't get it
back. The Infamous Three, feeling
powerful after such a brazen
theft, issued a list of
"non-negotiable" demands to the
Stanford administration which
had to be met before th£ Axe
would be returned.
They included $6OOO cash.

Billy Erb would have been
proud.
Billy Erb holds a secure place
in Stanford history. On this
statement there can be little
disagreement.
Just what that place is, though,
is open for debate. Billy Erb may
either have been one of the most
crafty, dedicated men ever to
attend this University or he
may have been the biggest
imbecile ever to set foot on
campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man
responsible for all this Axe
madness. You see, in 1899, he
feared Stanford was about to
blow a three-game baseball series
to Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound axe
to a pre-game rally and amused
the crowd by hacking up a
dummy bear. Then Erb, who was
the kind Of guy who would have
starred in The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre if he were around today,
took the Axe to the game and
spent a couple of hours chopping
up blue and gold ribbons.
Decapitation
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Berkeley
band members with decapitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game 9-7,
but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of Cal thugs jumped Erb
and the other guardians (including
Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and raced
off. They, outwitted their
Stanford pursuers not too
tough if Billy Erb can be
considered typical and got it
back to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been reading

along and thinking that Billy Erb
was um, unique then brace
yourself. Billy Erb had a friend
named Harry Dutton. And in any
discussion of great moments of
Stanford history, Harry Dutton's
name must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers got
back to their campus, they held a
spontaneous rally. Enter Harry
Dutton, just as dedicated to God,
flag and Stanford as Billy Erb.
Dutton, on horseback, rode into
the middle of the crowd and
suggested to the Cal men that
they hand him the Axe so
everyone could see it.
They agreed but
unfortunately the Cal men held
onto the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run away.
Luckily, Harry Dutton was no
faint-heart. After the rally the
Axe was taken to the Chi Phi
fraternity house, and Dutton
turned up there in a false
mustache with a note instructing
the frat men to turn the Axe over
to him so he could paint it. The
painfully naive Cal students
handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no dummy,
despite what you might think
after reading all this. He did not
consider it his destiny to go down

CARRYING THE WORD—In the noble tradition of Stanford overseas campuses, these students at
"Stanford-in-Africa," Dr. Jane Goodall's Gombe Stream Research Center in Tanzania, decided to educate
some of the native simians. Rumor has it the chimpanzees, all of whom were honor graduates of Cal,
replied by fashioning a "Beat Stanford" banner.
tear-jerking performance to the
student union manager, who
agreed to call the Axe
Commission and get the Axe. He
did, although the guards insisted it
go to Palo Alto in their car. Matt
Conway, Tim's older brother and
the third conspirator, made a

quick call to the Theta Delt house
and told them to have a
contingent waiting at Ming's,
where it was no contest.
"Except for some jail time, we
had nothing to lose," the
Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the theft.
"It had only been 30-odd years
since the last theft; and the Axe
was only encased in a nuclear
attack-proof case with an alarm
system; and what should it matter
if it was Big Game week and the
Axe was the center of attention
for the entire community?"
Only a school with Cal's
ineptitude could lose thp Axe

under those circumstances. And
the Bears very nearly didn't get it
back. The Infamous Three, feeling
powerful after such a brazen
theft, issued a list of
"non-negotiable" demands to the
Stanford administration which
had to be met before th£ Axe
would be returned.
They included $6OOO cash.

Billy Erb would have been
proud.
Billy Erb holds a secure place
in Stanford history. On this
statement there can be little
disagreement.
Just what that place is, though,
is open for debate. Billy Erb may
either have been one of the most
crafty, dedicated men ever to
attend this University or he
may have been the biggest
imbecile ever to set foot on
campus.
Either way, he's certainly
among the weirdest.
Billy Erb is the man
responsible for all this Axe
madness. You see, in 1899, he
feared Stanford was about to
blow a three-game baseball series
to Cal. Being a man of great
school spirit, Erb decided to
single-handedly prevent this
disgrace.
So he brought a 10-pound axe
to a pre-game rally and amused
the crowd by hacking up a
dummy bear. Then Erb, who was
the kind Of guy who would have
starred in The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre if he were around today,
took the Axe to the game and
spent a couple of hours chopping
up blue and gold ribbons.
Decapitation
To break the monotony, he
occasionally threatened Berkeley
band members with decapitation.
But it was a bad, bad day for
Stanford sports fans. Not only
did the Cards botch the game 9-7,
but Billy Erb lost the Axe. A
group of Cal thugs jumped Erb
and the other guardians (including
Carl Hayden, later to be U.S.
senator from Arizona) and raced
off. They, outwitted their
Stanford pursuers not too
tough if Billy Erb can be
considered typical and got it
back to Berkeley via ferryboat.
Now if you have been reading

along and thinking that Billy Erb
was um, unique then brace
yourself. Billy Erb had a friend
named Harry Dutton. And in any
discussion of great moments of
Stanford history, Harry Dutton's
name must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal Axe-nappers got
back to their campus, they held a
spontaneous rally. Enter Harry
Dutton, just as dedicated to God,
flag and Stanford as Billy Erb.
Dutton, on horseback, rode into
the middle of the crowd and
suggested to the Cal men that
they hand him the Axe so
everyone could see it.
They agreed but
unfortunately the Cal men held
onto the horse because they were
afraid it would shy and run away.
Luckily, Harry Dutton was no
faint-heart. After the rally the
Axe was taken to the Chi Phi
fraternity house, and Dutton
turned up there in a false
mustache with a note instructing
the frat men to turn the Axe over
to him so he could paint it. The
painfully naive Cal students
handed him the Axe.
Then his mustache fell off.
Dutton barely got away with his
life, much less the Axe, which
didn't leave the house.
Now Billy Erb plunged back
into the fray. Erb was no dummy,
despite what you might think
after reading all this. He did not
consider it his destiny to go down
in infamy as the man who lost
Stanford's Axe. No sir, not Billy
Erb.
So, late one night Chi Phi men
awoke to the gently sounds of a
battering ram on their door. Billy
Erb was leading a raiding party in
a desperate last-ditch attempt to
regain the Axe.
Kill For Axe
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, saw the group enter. He

snatched an ancient army sword
from the wall and snarled "I'll kill
the first man who starts up these
stairs." Obviously he didn't know
Billy Erb. A flower vase whizzed
by his car and he retreated in
disarray.
The Stanford men ransacked
the house but they couldn't find
the Axe. Sadder (but probably no
wiser) they returned to the Farm
empty-handed. Not until 1930
would honor and justice be
restored at Stanford.
Billy Erb and Harry Dutton
were long-gone by this time, of
course. Otherwise this would be a
much different story. Now the
Immortal 21 took over the quest.
For three years they, schemed and
plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930,
they were ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper photographers
promising fame and fortune to the
dim-witted Cal freshmen who
were carrying the Axe from a pep
rally. But when the flashbulbs
went off, they turned out to be
tear gas bombs the first time
during the long Cal-Stanford
rivalry that anyone ever resorted
to chemical warfare.

Howard Avery snatched the
Axe, tossed it into the car, and
they headed back for Palo Alto at
a torrid 65 miles an hour. Other
members of the Immortal 21
posed as Cal students and formed
search, parties to go in the
opposite direction of the escape
route.
What A Celebration
It worked. When the Immortal
21 got back to campus:
—classes were cancelled for two
days;
—the campus partied all night;
—the University presented
them with block 'S' letters, the
highest symbol of Stanford valor
and achievement, and special gold
Axe watch charms.
'They have won the gratitude
of every Stanford alumnus from
the White House to San Quentin,"
the student body applauded.
But the taste of victory quickly
turned bitter. The Stanford
administration, composed of men
with brainpans about the same
size as Billy Erb's, signed a pact
with Cal, making the Axe into a
trophy going to the winner of
each autumn's Big Game.
What treachery.
Thefts continued from time to
time. But since 1930, only one
group has pulled off a heist that
can truly be said to be in the
grand tradition of Billy Erb, Harry
Dutton and the Immortal 21.

Thev called themselves,
appropriately, the Infamous
Three. Residents of Theta Delta
Chi, they concluded that Cal
didn't deserve possessing of the
Axe for its last second 24-21
victory in 1972 in a game since
known as the Mud Bowl.
Justice. they concluded,
demanded that the Axe return to
Stanford. So last fall they devised
a plot to bring it back.
Looking at the plot with one
year's hindsight, it seems far too
stupid to ever succeed. But
remember: Cal students are
stupid. That's why they're there.
Briefly the plot was this:
someone would call up the Cal
student union, claim to be Bear
coach Mike White and ask if the -
Axe could be photographed with
two "football players" at a
football writer's banquet at Ming's
in Palo Alto. >
"We didn't really know what
he sounded like, but we figured
no one else did either," said David
Suliteanu, now a senior. It worked
perfectly: the student union
manager agreed to hand over the
Axe. But when Suliteanu and the
now-graduated Tim
showed up in Cal letter jackets, it.
