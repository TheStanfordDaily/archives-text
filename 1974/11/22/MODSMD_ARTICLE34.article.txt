# Poloists Play UCLA In NCAAs

### BOB KUSTEL 
"To say our work is cut out for
us is simply an overwhelming
understatement," said water polo
l,coach Art Lambert,
" contemplating this weekend's
long-awaited NCAA
Championships in Long Beach.
The NCAA's are the
culmination of a two-month
ordeal that began with grueling
two-a-day workouts in August and
' carried right through the last days
of the campaign, when the Cards
reeled off five straight victories to
earn a berth.
The Cardinals open the
tournament this afternoon against
Pac-8 co-champion UCLA, seeded
1 second in the tourney. "They'll
play their usual game against us,"
said Lambert, "trying to
out-muscle us, of course, and
using their great bench to wear us
down."
The Bruins, with a pair of
victories over Stanford already
this year (by a total of three
goals), may well overlook the
Cards in anticipation of a title
game against favored California,
the team that wrested the crown
from the Bruins two years ago.
Should the Cards get by
UCLA, and Lambert is quite
confident they will, Stanford
probably will meet the Anteaters
of UC-Irvine, who also knocked
off Stanford twice this year (4-3
and 9-5 at the beginning of the
season).
Victories over the two
Southern California rivals are
indeed possible, Lambert says, "If
we play the way we're capable
of."
It will take more than hard
driving, counter-attacking
i momentum and optimum effort
to beat Cal in the championship
game on Saturday evening.
"A little luck would be nice,"
laughed Lambert, in light of three
solid victories the Bears have
scored over Stanford this year.
I The rugged Bears need only
get by Air Force Academy and
Cal-State Fullerton to move into
the finals, a relatively simple task
for a team that has lost only twice
in two years.
So there it is. An 0-6 team in
the Pac-8 last year suddenly
1 talking about an NCAA
championship. "Why not?" asked
Lambert.

REASON FOR TURNAROUNDâ€”Stanford's new water polo coach,
Art Lambert, has led the team from oblivion into an NCAA
championship berth. Lambert's predecessor, swim coach Jim
Gaughran, looks on, very pleased the Athletic Department decided it
could afford to hire one of the nation's finest water polo mentors.
