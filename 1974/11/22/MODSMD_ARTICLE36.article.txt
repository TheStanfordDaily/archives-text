## Biz II Wrests Grid Title From Zetes 
### PETE BHATIA 
Biz II A ran its flea-flicking,
option offense to an 18-0 halftime
lead yesterday afternoon and then
held off a second-half Zete charge
to record an 18-7 victory and win
the IM football championship.
The Biz team, second seeded
and runner-up to the Zetes last
year, rolled into the finals with
flawless 43-0 victories over KA
and Phi Delt. Their offense was
wide-open and varied, using all six
of their receivers. All season long,
quarterback Gary Steele was able
to mix long, rush dominated
drives with long bombs, and
essentially score at will.
The first half yesterday was no
exception. After the Zete offense
failed to move on , its first
possession, the second year Biz
students went on an eight play,
57-yard drive, which was capped
by a five-yard toss from Steele to
Scott Schnuck for the score.
The Zetes came right back and
moved to the Biz 15, but Bill
Eaton intercepted Zete
quarterback Ed Snate's pass to kill
the drive. On the next play, Steele
unloaded a 65-yard TD bomb to
t ie streaking ( so to speak) Tony
Ledeaux. The conversion failed
for a second time and Biz II led
12-0.
After an exchange of punts,
Schnuck picked off an aerial at
the Zete 29. Four plays later,
Tom O'Donahue hauled in an
option pass from flanker Lawry
Liebermann and the halftime tally
read 18-0, Biz.
The Zetes got it together in
the second half and stopped the
Biz schoolers' initial drive on a
Johnßurtchaell interception at the
Zete 12. From there, the Zetes
drove 68 yards in 10 plays,
scoring on a one-yard roll by
Snate. The PAT was good on a
toss from Snate to Tom Bauer.

The teams punched it out, oft
literally, in the middle of the field
for the bulk of the rest of the
game, Bill Shattuck and the Zetes'
Bob Shaver making key
interceptions.
After the Shaver interception
the Zetes moved to the Biz
one-yard line, where Bedeaux
picked off a Snate pass in the end
zone for a touchback to cinch the
win.
The win earned the Bizzers 100
IM points while the Zetes
garnered 80. It marked the first
time since 1971 that the Zetes
failed to win the football crown.
In the B division, the
semi-finals are on top for today.

In one bout, unseeded Firehouses
meets third-seed Seven-in-the-Kip
py and fourth-seed Activated
Sludge (blech) meets unseeded
Adelfa. The fearless IM office
predictor, Pete the Greek, who
has picked 13 out of 15 games
correctly this season, sees the
Firehouse upsetting the Kippy by
six and the Sludge creeping by
Adelfa by a narrow seven-point
margin.

In the A volleyball playoffs,
the top-seeded team of Mike
Schmidt and Tom Duralde meets
the fifth-seeded Theta Delta A1
team in the semi-finals of the
tourney in a match at Maples
Pavilion tonight after the Bonfire.
In the other semifinal tilt, the
Hammers will meet the winner of
the quarterfinal match between
second seed Serra and the sixth
seed Theta Delt A2.
