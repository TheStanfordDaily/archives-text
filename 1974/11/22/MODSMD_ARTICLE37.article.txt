Dean Told Nixon Of Impeachment
WASHINGTON A deeply worried Richard M. Nixon
was told in April 1973 that John W. Dean's disclosures
might lead to his impeachment "on the ground that you
committed a crime."
Nixon reacted by working out a story to protect himself.
"I have got to put the wagons up around the President,"
Nixon was heard telling top aide H.R. Haldeman on a tape
recording of April 25, 1973, played yesterday for the
Watergate cover-up trial jury.
Ironically, what seemed to concern Nixon most was that
Dean might have taped a conversation a month earlier, on
March 21, when they discussed the blackmail money
demands being made on the White House be convicted
Watergate burglar E. Howard Hunt Jr.
"I just wonder if the son-of-a-bitch had a recorder on
him," Nixon said. "I didn't notice any, but I wasn't
looking."
Mondale Won t Run In *76
WASHINGTON Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.) has
become the second drop-out of the 1976 Democratic
presidential race, leaving liberal Democrats at least
temporarily without a well-known contender.
Mondale announced his withdrawal yesterday just a few
hours after Sen. Henry M. Jackson, who has strong support
from party regulars and organized labor, disclosed he has
hired a key party organizer for his anticipated candidacy.
The Jackson recruit was Robert J. Keefe, 40-year-old
executive director of the Democratic National Committee.
Coming less than two months after the September
withdrawal of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts,
Mondale's surprise decision left Rep. Morris K. Udall of
Arizona as the most visible, current liberal candidate against
Jackson when the presidential primaries begin 16 months
from now.
Ford Visits South Korea
SEOUL, South Korea President Ford arrived here for
a brief official visit today to a welcome by an estimated one
million South Koreans who waved flags and showered him
with confetti.
Despite tight security arrangements, the President left
his car twice during the trip to his hotel to shake
outstretched hands.
In remarks at Kimpo Airport, where Air Force One
touched down at the end of a flight from Japan, Ford set
the theme of the visit to reaffirm U.S. military ties with
the country that American troops helped to repel an
invasion almost a quarter century ago.
"I want to see for myself what you hqve built upon the
ashes of war," he said.
Although the purpose of Ford's visit is mainly to restate
the two countries' long-standing alliance, Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger told newsmen the President
"undoubtedly will call attention to the impact of Korea's
domestic policy" on U.S. Korean relations.
Senate Overturn* Ford Vetoes
WASHINGTON President Ford's vetoes of
anti-government secrecy and aid to the handicapped bills

were overturned in the Senate yesterday, the day after the
House took the same action.
The 65-27 Senate vote on the freedom of information
bill was close, only three more than the required two-thirds.
But a 90-1 tally was rolled up on the vocational
rehabilitation bill, with only Sen. William L. Scott (R-Va.)
supporting the President.
Ford now has been overridden on three of his 13 vetoes
in his three and a half months in the White House. The
other was on a railroad retirement measure.
The Senate vote, joined with that of the House, had the
effect of enacting the anti-secrecy bill into law.
On the measure covering programs for the handicapped,
there was some confusion because the President contended
he pocket-vetoed the bill during the congressional election
recess. Pocket vetoes cannot be acted on by Congress.
However, Ford's view was challenged by many members
of Congress, including some Republicans, who said it was a
regular veto.
Waldie Sharply Questions Rocky
WASHINGTON The House Judiciary Committee was
urged by one of its members yesterday to determine
whether Nelson A. Rockefeller has used the power of his
family's vast wealth to advance Rockefeller's political
career.
At the opening of what could be extensive hearings on
Rockefeller's nomination to be vice president, Rep. Jerome
Waldie (D-Calif.) said this was of much more concern than
whether Rockefeller might use political power to increase
the family fortune.
Waldie's questioning, among the sharpest Rockefeller has
faced during his confirmation hearings in both the House
and Senate, produced a sharp response from Rockefeller,
who said he resented the implication of the questions.
U.S. Blasts PLO Policy At U.N.
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The United States
yesterday declared its support of Israel's right to exist and
lashed out at the Arab guerrillas' "deliberate, policy of
terror" and their attempt to compare it with the American
Revolution.
The stance was at odds with the approach to the
Palestine question taken by a majority of speakers in the
General Assembly debate on Palestine. The stance also
differed with a resolution prepared by Third World
countries which says nothing about the continued existence
of Israel.
The resolution's approval is probably today, but some
diplomats said it might get only 70 or 60 votes rather than
the 120 hoped for by Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
Israel said it will never negotiate with the PLO on the
grounds it is a terrorist organization committed to
liquidating the Jewish State.
