# Frats May Overcrowd Rooms
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
considered another proposal last night
that would extend draw-exempt
privileges to University houses, which,
according to IFC President Mike
Nilsson. would "be willing to make a
sacrifice."
Under the proposal, fraternities and
houses desiring continuity would have
to accept 33 percent occupancy
increase. The house residents could
decide whether they wanted to crowd
the rooms or place the extra students
off campus.
At least "the groups would decide
who lives on and who lives off," Theta
Delta Chi alumnus Mike Higgins said.
The proposal presently popular
with Larry Horton, associate "dean of
students, would include fraternities in
the draw; thus, the University would
decide whether a student lives on or
off campus.
Inflating Eviction
Horton has said proposals which
extend the draw-exempt privilege
inflate the eviction rate.
Houses wishing the privilege will
compensate for the increased eviction
rate by raising the number.of students
assigned to a house, Nilsson said.
Horton described the proposal as
"an intriguing idea." However, he said
he has not studied the proposal in
depth since it hasn't been submitted
yet.
He said he would eventually judge
the proposal on its merit, not on its
support by the Council. The proposal
will be discussed among fraternity
members this weekend. The IFC will

decide next week if it will submit the
proposal. Nilsson said.
Nilsson explained that the proposal
allows for three housing systems
fraternity-sorority, continuity living
and the draw.
He said the fraternity-sorotity
system allows for sororities but does
not require them. Fraternities
sororities which become
co-educational will still be included
within the fraternity-sorority system if
they retain their national affiliation.
Nilsson also said fraternities would
search for boarders if they could not
fulfill their occupancy rate plus the 33
percent number of additional spaces.
The University could place students
from the draw in the house if the
fraternity still could not fill its quota
after adding boarders, he said.
One IFC member said this policy
could force fraternity members off
campus while the boarders took the
available rooms in the house.
Pressure
Other IFC members complained
that the 33 percent increase in pledges
would put a lot of pressure on the
fraternities.
"Unless we rush like hell we could
get screwed over by this proposal,"
IFC Vice President Steve Hansen
warned.
Higgins retorted that fraternities
haven't made themselves as attractive
to students as they could. However, he
conceded, "if a house can't survive, it
can't survive."
Nilsson and Higgins went on to
explain an elaborate guide they have

organized for University officials
forced to decide which houses will
receive continuity living status.
The two Theta Delt members based
their guide on the ratio of demand for
a particular house 1 divided by th P
number of available spaces in th P
house.
The proposal suggests those houses
with lower availability ratios be used
for continuity living because "students
wishing to become members of such
living groups have a better chance,
through some type of rush system, o|
gaining admittance than through the
draw."
Nilsson and Higgins specifically
chose an availability ratio less than
2.1, noting that the number would still
allow continuity living for 11 Row and
independent houses.
