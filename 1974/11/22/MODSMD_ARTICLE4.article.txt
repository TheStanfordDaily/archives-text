# Housing Office Proposes Addition Of 100 Florence Moore Units
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Housing Office revealed plans
yesterday to construct an addition to
Florence Moore Hall that would
accommodate approximately 100
students by next autumn.
If approved by the Board of
Trustees, the $1.3 million project
would* convert breezeways on the
ground floor of Florence Moore into
living spaces for between 90 and 107
students, Larry Horton, associate dean
of students, said.
The conversion would cost only
half as much as would construction of
a totally new structure with the same
number of units.
Horton said the project wouldn't
pre-empt existing plans to construct
three new Row houses for 150
students.
An interim loan taken from
University funds would finance the
Florence Moore project for one year
until the University could apply for a
30-year loan at six-and-a-half percent
interest from the 'California
Educational Facilities Authority
(CEFA), Horton said.
It will take a year to develop the
detailed explanation of expenditures
required by CEFA, according to Alan
Cummings, manager of student
housing. Since construction would
almost be completed when CEFA
acted on the loan request, the project
is not contingent upon obtaining the
loan, he added.
Prudent Plan
Although Horton said chances of
receiving the CEFA loan are "very
favorable," he said the Housing Office
would want to implement its "sound
and prudent plan" even if the
University were forced to seek a nine
percent commercial loan.
Horton noted, however, that
current plans estimate that even with a
CEFA loan, construction of the
project will raise housing costs by $l7
a year for the average student.
The Florence Moore project would
convert breezeways under Mirlo and
Paioma into full student living
quarters. Planners are undecided about
adding units to Gavilan. Spaces under
Alondra are already occupied by the
resident fellow's quarters.
Horton said construction of the
new units is expected to cause little

inconvenience to Florence Moore
students.
Security Precaution
Cummings explained that the
breezeways were included in the
original complex when it was built in
1957 in order to elevate the seven
houses and thereby protect the
all-female occupants.
Subsequent abolition of curfews
and introduction of coed living
arrangements in all Florence Moore
houses except Paloma have made the
breezeways obsolete, he noted.
Horton said the Housing Office
hasn't yet decided how much ancillary
space to include in the additions. He
noted that extra storage space might
be needed, but that storage room
would decrease the size of living
quarters.

The Housing Office has also not
determined whether or not new rooms
will be built to accomodate two or
three students.
Horton said he'll meet with
Florence Moore students and staff
several times in order to determine the
needs of the complex.
According to Lorraine Thompson,
Florence Moore resident fellow, the
plan would not provide new dining
spaces. But she doubted if the extra
students would crowd the kitchen and
dining facilities, which presently serve
Florence Moore's 360 students.
Horton noted that the construction
would add few if any new facilities to
Florence Moore.
Solid Quality
"The Florence Moore plan is
attractive because it includes solid,

permanent, quality spaces equal to
others at Florence Moore." Horton
said.
"In order to have this thing open
by next fall requires a tight time
schedule." Horton observed. "We'll
have to receive our approvals | from
the Trustees and the contractors! like
clockwork."
Both Horton and Cummings denied
that the formulation of the plan is a
reaction to recent expressions of
student bitterness about the housing
shortage.
They said the project was not
mentioned in the Housing Office's
recent report on undergraduate
housing because the plan was not
proven architeetually feasible until this
fall.
