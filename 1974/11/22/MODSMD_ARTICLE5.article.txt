# Five-Year Projection
## Tuition To Reach $5500 
### BOB LOWE 
Tuition may increase by 63 percent
over the next five years, jumping from
the present level of $3375 a year! to a
whopping $5500 in 1979-80, Acting
President William Miller told the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
That increase represents a projected
tuition hike which averages 10.3
percent per year a rate higher than
projected average inflation over the
five-year period.
Miller discussed the University's
long-range budget balancing and
predicted the big tuition increase along
with serious budget cutting in many
areas of the University.
He outlined a few definite
budgetary reductions in administrative
services over the next three years, but
provided no details about possible
reductions in other areas of the
Univeristy.
Reduction Target
"In thepresident's-provost office we
gave set a target for 25 percent
reduction of staff and related
support," Miller said. "We shall have a
very thin office.
Miller added that the
administration hopes to reduce general

fund support for the University
computing fund which sponsors
computer research by 20 percent.
The president's-provost's office and
the computing fund were allocated
$1.4 million and $200,000
respectively in this year's operating
budget.
Support for two funds, the
Research Development and the
University Progress' funds, also will be
cut out of the operating budget. Miller
said.
General Fund Savings
This will save the general fund
about $322,000 formerly used to
support and promote new teaching
and research programs.
"We intend to scramble for gift
funds to fulfill these functions," Miller
said, "but no doubt at a reduced
level."
Miller's report to the Senate elicited
a heated response from Biology Prof.
Colin Pittendrigh and comments from
others at the meeting.
Pittendrigh Criticizes
Pittendrigh criticized the University
administration for poor planning in
foreseeing the magnitude of the
University's financial woes.

"Planning has been inadequate," he
said. Pittendrigh added that a "great
amount of damage" has resulted from
the suddenness of the financial crisis.
Miller responded that the severe
economic crunch and drop in the
stock market could not be predicted.
"The wolves are on the
departments' backs," Pittendrigh said,
referring to inevitable budget cutting.
Departments have been asked by the
administration to consider possible
reductions as high as 17 percent over
the next three years.
Staff Hardship
Untenured staff will take the brunt
of the financial hardship, Pittendrigh
said. He added that the Biology
Department will recommend to the
administration that tenured staff in
the department take salary reductions.
This would distribute some of the
burden, he said.
ASSU Senate Chairman Lee
Rosenbaum warned that increasing
tuition while cutting academic areas
will diminish the University's
attractiveness.
"At what point does< Stanford's
education stop being attractive?" he
asked.
Same Across Country
Miller pointed out that colleges and
universities all over the country are in
similar economic situations. "It
depends not only on what we do but
what the competition does," he said.
Vice provost William Massy said he
expects tuition increases to exceed the
10.2 percent average in the next
couple of years, decreasing in
subsequent years as inflation eases.
Predictions Reasonable
Massy said the predictions in the
long range financial forecast are
reasonable, but he added that
estimates may be too low for this year.
The University anticipates nine
percent inflation rate for 1974-75,
Massy said. But the current rate
projects closer to 12 percent annual
inflation.
The tuition increase will exceed
price increases in other goods that
