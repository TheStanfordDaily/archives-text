# McCloskey Named To Judiciary Committee
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park) was
named yesterday to succeed Rep. Delbert Latta
(R-Ohio) on the House Judiciary Committee.
Latta, a conservative who supported President
Nixon during last summer's impeachment hearings,
won re-election this month but decided to resign
from the committee for unspecified reasons.
McCloskey called for Nixon's impeachment in 1971
on the war powers issue.
McCloskey was appointed by Rep. John J.
Rhodes of Arizona, House minority leader.
Although Rhodes is a member of the GOP's
conservative wing, he has often expressed interest in
giving liberals like McCloskey greater responsibility
in the House in order to broaden the base of the
party.
In accepting the appointment yesterday,
McCloskey acknowledged that he will work to bring
a more "moderate viewpoint" to the committee.
McCloskey will take his seat on the committee
before it begins its consideration of Nelson
Rockefeller's confirmation as vice president.
Although McCloskey originally supported
President Ford's appointment of Rockefeller, he
now claims that he doesn't know how he will vote
until he is able to examine more of the evidence for
and against Rockefeller.
In August, McCloskey called Rockefeller,
together with former Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson
and Republican National Committee Chairman
George Bush, the best vice-presidential possibilities,
recommending them to Ford.
But McCloskey has recently expressed discontent
with Rockefeller's apparent use of wealth to

influence the political process.
McCloskey says he sees nothing illegal with the
Rockefeller's gifts to his friends or the funding of a
book critical of Arthur Goldberg, Rockefeller's
opponent in the 1970 New York gubernatorial race.
But McCloskey questions the ethics of both acts.
McCloskey told reporters yesterday that he
expects Judiciary Committee hearings on
Rockefeller to last at least three weeks and probe
even deeper into Rockefeller's past than did the
Senate Rules Committee.
As the Judiciary Committee's newest member,
McCloskey will be the lowest ranking of the
committee's 38 representatives. McCloskey
currently serves as ranking Republican on the
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee and the
Government Operations Committee.
Although McCloskey has recently expressed
doubts about seeking fifth term in 1976, he often
speaks with enthusiasm about the possibility of the
next Congress carrying out significant national
reform.
Long considered a maverick for his opposition to
the Vietnam War, McCloskey opposed Nixon in
several GOP presidential primaries in 1972. After a
period of estrangement from the party, he has
recently attempted to re-establish his ties with the
party while retaining his generally liberal views.
A graduate of Stanford Law School, McCloskey
practiced law in Palo Alto for a decade before his
election to Congress in a special election in 1967.
On the Judiciary Committee, he will serve with
another Stanford alumnus. Rep. Don Edwards
(D-San Jose).
