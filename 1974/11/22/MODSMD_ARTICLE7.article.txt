Switching The Mail
Editor:
I am writing in the hope of
changing a University tradition.
This tradition seems to be of
minor importance yet can be of
a vital nature.
The practice of putting
someone else's mail in your P.O.
box is frustrating. We can yell at
the P.O. men, but that really
accomplishes nothing, for these
men do have a lot of work. Most
considerate Stanfordites put the
misplaced letters on the outside of
the addressee's box. The problem
with this is that it leaves the letter
vulnerable to be ripped off.
May I suggest that instead of
putting the letters on the outside
of the box, why not:
1) Present the letter to a
window clerk and bawl him out;
or, if you are in a hurry or the line
inside is long, why not
2) just shove the letter inside
the Post Office itself through your
post box so it falls to the
ground and gets picked up by the
next distributor who will
(hopefully) correctly place it this
time.
Think of the number of
relationships which will continue
through your action.

Top Priority
Editor:
I recently read that President
Lyman endorsed the proposed
multi-million dollar library as the
University's "number one
priority." From an educational
point of view, he may be right. In
terms of equitable land usage and
storage space, he ought to
consider the architecturally
extravagant and spacious Meyer
Library.
Simply walk into the middle of
the lobby on the second floor end
look straight up. Do you notice
anything unusual? There is
obviously a tremendous shaft of
nothing where thousands of books
could be stored. The architecture
and the planning commission
missed the point of what a library
should be especially in the

1970s when building costs are
skyrocketing!
A library ought to be a storage
house for books where students
can study and do research in a
comfortable atmosphere. It
should not be a social parlor
where students on the fourth floor
can peer down a shaft at students
milling about on the second floor.
I suspect that my complaint
will fall on deaf ears. If not,
perhaps the next library will
reflect the hard earned dollar of
both the students and the
contributors to the University.

Zionists Stole Land
Editor:
In his Nov. 13 speech to the
United Nations General Assembly,
Yasir Arafat of the Palestine
Liberation Organization dwelt
time and again on the usurpation
of Palestinians' land. He spoke of
those forced to leave their homes
and lands. He spoke of the
Palestinians right to return to
their homeland.
At the root of the strife in the
Middle East is the theft of the
land of Palestinians by Israelis.
This is recognized by Israelis as
well as Arabs, though not always
by Americans.
In 1973, Yehoshofat Harkabi,
the former chief of Israeli military
intelligence, said in an interview:
"Because we took the land, this
gives us the image of being bad, of
being aggressive. v
The Jews always considered
that the land belonged to them,
but in fact it belonged to the
Arabs. I would go farther I
would say the original source of
the conflict lies with Israel, with
the Jews."
In a similar vein, a journalist
writing in the July 14,1972, issue
of the popular Israeli newspaper,
Yediot Ahronot, said "there is no
Zionism, no settlement and no
Jewish state without evacuation
of Arabs and the expropriation
and fencing of lands."
Justice demands repatriation of
the Palestinians and restitution to
them of their stolen property.
