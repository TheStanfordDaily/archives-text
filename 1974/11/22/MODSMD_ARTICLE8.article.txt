# Big Daddy Day'
## 
### Charles Ogletree 
Who is that certain individual
one can always turn to when in
need? Who is that gentleman who
proudly carries a smile throughout
his trails and tribulations?
Who is that certain individual
who has been able to unite
students, faculty and staff on
issues that one would never have
thought possible? What manner of
man is it who claims to have no
formal education, but yet knows
more about life than the above
average human being?
Maybe a clue will aid those
who have yet to identify this
individual.
He's well over 200 pounds of
joy. and cooks a mean side of rib.
I'm speaking of none other than
the (Godfather of Soul Food, Dave
"Big Daddy" McCullum, head
chef at the Faculty Club.
Most people are only familiar
with Big Daddy as a cook.
However, in view of the following
remarks, I'm sure you will agree
that he is much more than a
master of the culinary art.
'Motivating Force'
For those who are unaware,
Big Daddy was the motivating
force behind the tremendous
response of the Stanford
community to the African Famine
Relief effort.
This seemingly tireless
individual, with the support of his
loving wife Donna and four
children, Dave Jr.. Michael,

Rebecca and Linda, contributed
his time and energy seven days a
week, in addition to working 40
hours a week at the Stanford
Faculty Club. He prepared
dinners, consoled irate customers
and encouraged students to
continue pushing the program
even at times when the general
community response was low key.
Big Daddy is a counselor,
adviser, mother, father, big sister
and big brother to many students
on this campus. He is a man for all
seasons who in his ability to reach
out to people never ceases to
amaze me. He has supported the
Black Students Union African
Famine Relief, Black Student
Cultural Center, Whitman House,
ASSU and countless other
organizations in initiating
activities.
In recognition of his
aforementioned qualities and
numerous others, the residents of
the Black Cultural Center are
proclaiming Nov. 26 as "Big
Daddy Day" and saluting him and
his family accordingly.
Those interested in
participating in the momentous
occasion should contact any of
the staff members of the Black
Cultural Center. It's time we made
it known to this extraordinary
individual how well he is loved
and respected in this community.
