# Big Game: From Gloom To Glory In 23 Seconds
## Langford's Field Goal Caps Miracle Comeback 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
BERKELEY Some Stanford fans sat with head in
hands, stunned. Some cried. Some stared bitterly at a
scoreboard clock which read California 20, Stanford 19
with only 23 seconds to play, or at a California crowd
exploding with joy.
A few blamed the defense for failing to stop the
incredible pair of Steves Bartkowski and Rivera while
most mourned the apparent realization that the Cardinals
had done it again, blowing another game they should have
won.
Down below this pocket of depression in an otherwise
raucous Memorial Stadium, some guys on their own
24-yard line were still trying, pathetically hoping they
could move the ball 40 yards downfield against a "prevent"
defense to get the ball into what barely passes as field goal
range. All in 23 seconds.
Stanford's favorite quarterback, Guy Benjamin, given
plenty of time by a determined offensive line, first threw an
18-yarder to Ted Pappas, who raced out of bounds. But
Benjamin's next pass came closer to interception than
completion, so the Cardinals were left in the hopeless
situation of being on their own 42 with but 11 seconds to
play in Saturday's 77th Big Game.
Benjamin, unflustered by the start of the rhythmic
countdown of the seconds, threw beneath the deeply set
defensive backs to tight end Brad Williams, crossing over
the middle, still short of field goal range.
But Williams made the most of the last reception of his
college career. He bowled over Cal defender Herman
Edwards and raced diagonally to the sideline. Williams
apparently had both a clock and a

field-goal-length-calculator ensconsed in his head, as he
dashed out of bounds as far upfield as he could possibly
advance before time expired.
Up To Langford
So with two seconds left, it was all in the hands, or feet,
of an obscure junior college transfer kicker named Mike
Langford.
Langford isn't your usual 5-foot-5 foreign-born kicker
who comes into the game, methodically decides which
group of Ail-American boys win the contest and shrugs in
the locker room, "No, I wasn't nervous."
In fact, Langford is a big, friendly redhead most people
mistake for a reserve linebacker. (He is, but is too valuable
to play that spot.) He doesn't even kick soccer style. Hell,
he even gets nervous. Even petrified.
So when Langford saw he'd have to kick a 50-yarder
from the right hashmark, he told himself, "Oh my God,
here I am."
Holder Eric Test calmed Langford, telling him to keep
his head down and follow through. So Langford, head
down, kicked it.
The ball wobbled, drifted to the right, wobbled some
more and finally arched over and between a
soon-to-be-destroyed pair of goalposts.
The Hero
When Langford finally looked up, "I just saw people
running at me." Those people mobbed him, hugged him,
lifted him up because the nervous All-American boy had
just become one of the Big Game's biggest heroes, the guy
whose third field goal of the day won it, 22-20.
Langford's boot turned those two mournful sections of
