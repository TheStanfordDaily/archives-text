# Big Game: From Gloom To Glory In 23 Seconds
## Langford's Field Goal Caps Miracle Comeback 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
BERKELEY Some Stanford fans sat with head in
hands, stunned. Some cried. Some stared bitterly at a
scoreboard clock which read California 20, Stanford 19
with only 23 seconds to play, or at a California crowd
exploding with joy.
A few blamed the defense for failing to stop the
incredible pair of Steves Bartkowski and Rivera while
most mourned the apparent realization that the Cardinals
had done it again, blowing another game they should have
won.
Down below this pocket of depression in an otherwise
raucous Memorial Stadium, some guys on their own
24-yard line were still trying, pathetically hoping they
could move the ball 40 yards downfield against a "prevent"
defense to get the ball into what barely passes as field goal
range. All in 23 seconds.
Stanford's favorite quarterback, Guy Benjamin, given
plenty of time by a determined offensive line, first threw an
18-yarder to Ted Pappas, who raced out of bounds. But
Benjamin's next pass came closer to interception than
completion, so the Cardinals were left in the hopeless
situation of being on their own 42 with but 11 seconds to
play in Saturday's 77th Big Game.
Benjamin, unflustered by the start of the rhythmic
countdown of the seconds, threw beneath the deeply set
defensive backs to tight end Brad Williams, crossing over
the middle, still short of field goal range.
But Williams made the most of the last reception of his
college career. He bowled over Cal defender Herman
Edwards and raced diagonally to the sideline. Williams
apparently had both a clock and a

field-goal-length-calculator ensconsed in his head, as he
dashed out of bounds as far upfield as he could possibly
advance before time expired.
Up To Langford
So with two seconds left, it was all in the hands, or feet,
of an obscure junior college transfer kicker named Mike
Langford.
Langford isn't your usual 5-foot-5 foreign-born kicker
who comes into the game, methodically decides which
group of Ail-American boys win the contest and shrugs in
the locker room, "No, I wasn't nervous."
In fact, Langford is a big, friendly redhead most people
mistake for a reserve linebacker. (He is, but is too valuable
to play that spot.) He doesn't even kick soccer style. Hell,
he even gets nervous. Even petrified.
So when Langford saw he'd have to kick a 50-yarder
from the right hashmark, he told himself, "Oh my God,
here I am."
Holder Eric Test calmed Langford, telling him to keep
his head down and follow through. So Langford, head
down, kicked it.
The ball wobbled, drifted to the right, wobbled some
more and finally arched over and between a
soon-to-be-destroyed pair of goalposts.
The Hero
When Langford finally looked up, "I just saw people
running at me." Those people mobbed him, hugged him,
lifted him up because the nervous All-American boy had
just become one of the Big Game's biggest heroes, the guy
whose third field goal of the day won it, 22-20.

WE’VE STILL GOT THE AXE These jubilant players and fans were sullen and hopeless before Mike Langford
transformed crushing defeat into memorable victory Saturday at Berkeley. Langford's 50-yard field goal gave Stanford a
22-20 victory over California in the 77th Big Game.
Stanford rcoters into unbridled
ecstacy, ant stunned the rest of
the 71,866 fans, who just sat
there, moticnless, for five minutes
after the game.
Cal players, and their coach,
Mike Whitq cried in the locker
room. But the Stanford locker
room scene was the most jubilant
"since the Ohio State Rose
Bowl," according to equipment
manager Dot Marvin.
The playtrs hugged each other,
yelled and ang a loud rendition
of "The Dirty Golden Bear." And
in a corner, the Stanford Axe lay
unattended, easy-to-steal.
Modest QB
In a corntr of the locker room,
Benjamin, ore of the least excited
persons present, modestly
explained thit while he was in the
game, "We got a couple of breaks
that Mike [Cbrdova, the forgotten
starting quarterback] could have
gotten too."
The Cardinals got only three
points during the first three
quarters. Coriova played well for
awhile, but the Bears' defense, as
Scott Laidhw explained, was
tough because "both teams run
the same offense," and the
defenses knev just how to stop
the familiar pays.
The Card defense was equally
tough, after giving up a first
touchdown set up by an
unbelievable one-handed grab by
Rivera, who aught nine passes for
205 yards. Hewas recruited to the
Farm by ore of the turncoat
assistant coathes who went to
work for Cal md took his recruits
with him. livera is the best
receiver mosl of the Stanford
players had ever seen, simply
outrunning Card defenders for
receptions.
Anyway, Cordova went sour
midway thrtugh the game,
sandwiching three straight
interceptions around halftime.
Coach Jack Christiansen gave
Cordova i score-or-else
ultimatum, anJ when the Cards
didn't move on the next
possession, in vtent Benjamin.
Better And Better
Benjamin hoked bad for a
couple series, but loosened up
after Stanford's defense recovered
a high punt snjp and gave the ball
to the offense oi the Bear nine.
Benjamin haided the ball to
Scott Laidlaw oi three of the four
plays from scrinmage, and on the
final play, a fourth and inches,
Laidlaw banged it across to make
it 13-10, Stanfoil.
Cal got the ball back and
marched downleld for awhile,
but Jeff Siemeis intercepted a
hurried Bartkavski pass and
returned it to the Card 40.
On the first pky after Siemens'
pickoff, Benjamn called a deep
sideline pass to lony Hill in order
to take advantag* of an untested
Cal defensive i«ack. Benjamin
threw a perfect pass and that
rookie defender never touched

Hill on the latter's scamper to the
endzone.
Cal marched right back with a
field goal with 4:40 remaining.
Stanford then tried three running
plays which didn't get a first
down, and gave the ball back to
Bart with 2:27 to play.
That was plenty of time for the
love-lorn quarterback to launch a
10-play drive which featured two
fourth down conversions,
including a key pass to Rivera.
With 27 seconds left, Bart threw
the apparently winning TD pass to
Rivera.
That was Bart's mistake. He
was 27 seconds too good. But

then, how could he figure that
Stanford's offense would set up
Langford's immortal wobble and
make him the losing quarterback?

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
finishes the season at 5-4-2, its
11th straight non-losing and sixth
straight winning year... By
winning five of their last six, the
Cards finish second in the Pacific
Eight with a 5-1-1 mark ... It was
the first Stanford win in Berkeley
since 1968.
The Bears finish their season at
7-3-1, precisely equaling their

In fact, Langford is a big, friendly redhead most people

to play that spot.) He doesn't even kick soccer style. Hell,
he even gets nervous. Even petrified.
So when Langford saw he'd have to kick a 50-yarder
from the right hashmark, he told himself, "Oh my God,
here I am."
Holder Eric Test calmed Langford, telling him to keep
his head down and follow through. So Langford, head
down, kicked it.

WE’VE STILL GOT THE AXE These jubilant players and fans were sullen and hopeless before Mike Langford
transformed crushing defeat into memorable victory Saturday at Berkeley. Langford's 50-yard field goal gave Stanford a
22-20 victory over California in the 77th Big Game.
Stanford rcoters into unbridled
ecstacy, ant stunned the rest of
the 71,866 fans, who just sat
there, moticnless, for five minutes
after the game.
Cal players, and their coach,
Mike Whitq cried in the locker
room. But the Stanford locker
room scene was the most jubilant
"since the Ohio State Rose
Bowl," according to equipment
manager Dot Marvin.
The playtrs hugged each other,
yelled and ang a loud rendition
of "The Dirty Golden Bear." And
in a corner, the Stanford Axe lay
unattended, easy-to-steal.
Modest QB
In a corntr of the locker room,
Benjamin, ore of the least excited
persons present, modestly
explained thit while he was in the
game, "We got a couple of breaks
that Mike [Cbrdova, the forgotten
starting quarterback] could have
gotten too."
The Cardinals got only three
points during the first three
quarters. Coriova played well for
awhile, but the Bears' defense, as
Scott Laidhw explained, was
tough because "both teams run
the same offense," and the
defenses knev just how to stop
the familiar pays.
The Card defense was equally
tough, after giving up a first
touchdown set up by an
unbelievable one-handed grab by
Rivera, who aught nine passes for
205 yards. Hewas recruited to the
Farm by ore of the turncoat
assistant coathes who went to
work for Cal md took his recruits
with him. livera is the best
receiver mosl of the Stanford
players had ever seen, simply
outrunning Card defenders for
receptions.
Anyway, Cordova went sour
midway thrtugh the game,
sandwiching three straight
interceptions around halftime.
Coach Jack Christiansen gave
Cordova i score-or-else
ultimatum, anJ when the Cards
didn't move on the next
possession, in vtent Benjamin.
Better And Better
Benjamin hoked bad for a
couple series, but loosened up
after Stanford's defense recovered
a high punt snjp and gave the ball
to the offense oi the Bear nine.
Benjamin haided the ball to
Scott Laidlaw oi three of the four
plays from scrinmage, and on the
final play, a fourth and inches,
Laidlaw banged it across to make
it 13-10, Stanfoil.
Cal got the ball back and
marched downleld for awhile,
but Jeff Siemeis intercepted a
hurried Bartkavski pass and
returned it to the Card 40.
On the first pky after Siemens'
pickoff, Benjamn called a deep
sideline pass to lony Hill in order
to take advantag* of an untested
Cal defensive i«ack. Benjamin
threw a perfect pass and that
rookie defender never touched

Hill on the latter's scamper to the
endzone.
Cal marched right back with a
field goal with 4:40 remaining.
Stanford then tried three running
plays which didn't get a first
down, and gave the ball back to
Bart with 2:27 to play.
That was plenty of time for the
love-lorn quarterback to launch a
10-play drive which featured two
fourth down conversions,
including a key pass to Rivera.
With 27 seconds left, Bart threw
the apparently winning TD pass to
Rivera.
That was Bart's mistake. He
was 27 seconds too good. But

then, how could he figure that
Stanford's offense would set up
Langford's immortal wobble and
make him the losing quarterback?

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
finishes the season at 5-4-2, its
11th straight non-losing and sixth
straight winning year... By
winning five of their last six, the
Cards finish second in the Pacific
Eight with a 5-1-1 mark ... It was
the first Stanford win in Berkeley
since 1968.
The Bears finish their season at
7-3-1, precisely equaling their
record of '6B, their other "best
year" of the last 15 .
BERKELEY Some Stanford fans sat with head in
hands, stunned. Some cried. Some stared bitterly at a
scoreboard clock which read California 20, Stanford 19
with only 23 seconds to play, or at a California crowd
exploding with joy.
A few blamed the defense for failing to stop the
incredible pair of Steves Bartkowski and Rivera while
most mourned the apparent realization that the Cardinals
had done it again, blowing another game they should have
won.
Down below this pocket of depression in an otherwise
raucous Memorial Stadium, some guys on their own
24-yard line were still trying, pathetically hoping they
could move the ball 40 yards downfield against a "prevent"
defense to get the ball into what barely passes as field goal
range. All in 23 seconds.
Stanford's favorite quarterback, Guy Benjamin, given
plenty of time by a determined offensive line, first threw an
18-yarder to Ted Pappas, who raced out of bounds. But
Benjamin's next pass came closer to interception than
completion, so the Cardinals were left in the hopeless
situation of being on their own 42 with but 11 seconds to
play in Saturday's 77th Big Game.
Benjamin, unflustered by the start of the rhythmic
countdown of the seconds, threw beneath the deeply set
defensive backs to tight end Brad Williams, crossing over
the middle, still short of field goal range.
But Williams made the most of the last reception of his
college career. He bowled over Cal defender Herman
Edwards and raced diagonally to the sideline. Williams
apparently had both a clock and a

field-goal-length-calculator ensconsed in his head, as he
dashed out of bounds as far upfield as he could possibly
advance before time expired.
Up To Langford
So with two seconds left, it was all in the hands, or feet,
of an obscure junior college transfer kicker named Mike
Langford.
Langford isn't your usual 5-foot-5 foreign-born kicker

in a corner, the Stanford Axe lay
unattended, easy-to-steal.
Modest QB
In a corntr of the locker room,
Benjamin, ore of the least excited
persons present, modestly
explained thit while he was in the
game, "We got a couple of breaks
that Mike [Cbrdova, the forgotten
starting quarterback] could have
gotten too."
The Cardinals got only three
points during the first three
quarters. Coriova played well for
awhile, but the Bears' defense, as
Scott Laidhw explained, was
tough because "both teams run
the same offense," and the
defenses knev just how to stop
the familiar pays.
The Card defense was equally
tough, after giving up a first
touchdown set up by an
unbelievable one-handed grab by
Rivera, who aught nine passes for
205 yards. Hewas recruited to the
Farm by ore of the turncoat
assistant coathes who went to
work for Cal md took his recruits
with him. livera is the best
receiver mosl of the Stanford
players had ever seen, simply
outrunning Card defenders for
receptions.
Anyway, Cordova went sour
midway thrtugh the game,
sandwiching three straight
interceptions around halftime.
Coach Jack Christiansen gave
Cordova i score-or-else
ultimatum, anJ when the Cards
didn't move on the next
possession, in vtent Benjamin.
Better And Better
Benjamin hoked bad for a
couple series, but loosened up
after Stanford's defense recovered
a high punt snjp and gave the ball
to the offense oi the Bear nine.
Benjamin haided the ball to
Scott Laidlaw oi three of the four
plays from scrinmage, and on the
final play, a fourth and inches,
Laidlaw banged it across to make
it 13-10, Stanfoil.
Cal got the ball back and
marched downleld for awhile,
but Jeff Siemeis intercepted a
hurried Bartkavski pass and
returned it to the Card 40.
On the first pky after Siemens'
pickoff, Benjamn called a deep
sideline pass to lony Hill in order
to take advantag* of an untested
Cal defensive i«ack. Benjamin
threw a perfect pass and that
rookie defender never touched

Hill on the latter's scamper to the
endzone.
Cal marched right back with a
field goal with 4:40 remaining.
Stanford then tried three running
plays which didn't get a first
down, and gave the ball back to
Bart with 2:27 to play.
That was plenty of time for the
love-lorn quarterback to launch a
10-play drive which featured two
fourth down conversions,
including a key pass to Rivera.
With 27 seconds left, Bart threw
the apparently winning TD pass to
Rivera.
That was Bart's mistake. He
was 27 seconds too good. But

then, how could he figure that
Stanford's offense would set up
Langford's immortal wobble and
make him the losing quarterback?

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
finishes the season at 5-4-2, its
11th straight non-losing and sixth
straight winning year... By
winning five of their last six, the
Cards finish second in the Pacific
Eight with a 5-1-1 mark ... It was
the first Stanford win in Berkeley
since 1968.
The Bears finish their season at
7-3-1, precisely equaling their
record of '6B, their other "best
year" of the last 15 .
BERKELEY Some Stanford fans sat with head in
hands, stunned. Some cried. Some stared bitterly at a
scoreboard clock which read California 20, Stanford 19
with only 23 seconds to play, or at a California crowd
exploding with joy.
A few blamed the defense for failing to stop the
incredible pair of Steves Bartkowski and Rivera while
most mourned the apparent realization that the Cardinals
had done it again, blowing another game they should have
won.
Down below this pocket of depression in an otherwise
raucous Memorial Stadium, some guys on their own
24-yard line were still trying, pathetically hoping they
could move the ball 40 yards downfield against a "prevent"
defense to get the ball into what barely passes as field goal
range. All in 23 seconds.
Stanford's favorite quarterback, Guy Benjamin, given
plenty of time by a determined offensive line, first threw an
18-yarder to Ted Pappas, who raced out of bounds. But
Benjamin's next pass came closer to interception than
completion, so the Cardinals were left in the hopeless
situation of being on their own 42 with but 11 seconds to
play in Saturday's 77th Big Game.
Benjamin, unflustered by the start of the rhythmic
countdown of the seconds, threw beneath the deeply set
defensive backs to tight end Brad Williams, crossing over
the middle, still short of field goal range.
But Williams made the most of the last reception of his
college career. He bowled over Cal defender Herman
Edwards and raced diagonally to the sideline. Williams
apparently had both a clock and a

field-goal-length-calculator ensconsed in his head, as he
dashed out of bounds as far upfield as he could possibly
advance before time expired.
Up To Langford
So with two seconds left, it was all in the hands, or feet,
of an obscure junior college transfer kicker named Mike
Langford.
Langford isn't your usual 5-foot-5 foreign-born kicker
who comes into the game, methodically decides which
group of Ail-American boys win the contest and shrugs in
the locker room, "No, I wasn't nervous."
In fact, Langford is a big, friendly redhead most people
mistake for a reserve linebacker. (He is, but is too valuable
to play that spot.) He doesn't even kick soccer style. Hell,
he even gets nervous. Even petrified.
So when Langford saw he'd have to kick a 50-yarder
from the right hashmark, he told himself, "Oh my God,
here I am."
Holder Eric Test calmed Langford, telling him to keep
his head down and follow through. So Langford, head
down, kicked it.
The ball wobbled, drifted to the right, wobbled some
more and finally arched over and between a
soon-to-be-destroyed pair of goalposts.
The Hero
When Langford finally looked up, "I just saw people
running at me." Those people mobbed him, hugged him,
lifted him up because the nervous All-American boy had
just become one of the Big Game's biggest heroes, the guy
whose third field goal of the day won it, 22-20.

On the first pky after Siemens'
pickoff, Benjamn called a deep
sideline pass to lony Hill in order
to take advantag* of an untested
Cal defensive i«ack. Benjamin
threw a perfect pass and that
rookie defender never touched

Hill on the latter's scamper to the
endzone.
Cal marched right back with a
field goal with 4:40 remaining.
Stanford then tried three running
plays which didn't get a first
down, and gave the ball back to
Bart with 2:27 to play.
That was plenty of time for the
love-lorn quarterback to launch a
10-play drive which featured two
fourth down conversions,
including a key pass to Rivera.
With 27 seconds left, Bart threw
the apparently winning TD pass to
Rivera.
That was Bart's mistake. He
was 27 seconds too good. But

then, how could he figure that
Stanford's offense would set up
Langford's immortal wobble and
make him the losing quarterback?

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
finishes the season at 5-4-2, its
11th straight non-losing and sixth
straight winning year... By
winning five of their last six, the
Cards finish second in the Pacific
Eight with a 5-1-1 mark ... It was
the first Stanford win in Berkeley
since 1968.
The Bears finish their season at
7-3-1, precisely equaling their
record of '6B, their other "best
year" of the last 15 .
BERKELEY Some Stanford fans sat with head in
hands, stunned. Some cried. Some stared bitterly at a
scoreboard clock which read California 20, Stanford 19
with only 23 seconds to play, or at a California crowd
exploding with joy.
A few blamed the defense for failing to stop the
incredible pair of Steves Bartkowski and Rivera while
most mourned the apparent realization that the Cardinals
had done it again, blowing another game they should have
won.
Down below this pocket of depression in an otherwise
raucous Memorial Stadium, some guys on their own
24-yard line were still trying, pathetically hoping they
could move the ball 40 yards downfield against a "prevent"
defense to get the ball into what barely passes as field goal
range. All in 23 seconds.
Stanford's favorite quarterback, Guy Benjamin, given
plenty of time by a determined offensive line, first threw an
18-yarder to Ted Pappas, who raced out of bounds. But
Benjamin's next pass came closer to interception than
completion, so the Cardinals were left in the hopeless
situation of being on their own 42 with but 11 seconds to
play in Saturday's 77th Big Game.
Benjamin, unflustered by the start of the rhythmic
countdown of the seconds, threw beneath the deeply set
defensive backs to tight end Brad Williams, crossing over
the middle, still short of field goal range.
But Williams made the most of the last reception of his
college career. He bowled over Cal defender Herman
Edwards and raced diagonally to the sideline. Williams
apparently had both a clock and a

field-goal-length-calculator ensconsed in his head, as he
dashed out of bounds as far upfield as he could possibly
advance before time expired.
Up To Langford
So with two seconds left, it was all in the hands, or feet,
of an obscure junior college transfer kicker named Mike
Langford.
Langford isn't your usual 5-foot-5 foreign-born kicker
who comes into the game, methodically decides which
group of Ail-American boys win the contest and shrugs in
the locker room, "No, I wasn't nervous."
In fact, Langford is a big, friendly redhead most people
mistake for a reserve linebacker. (He is, but is too valuable
to play that spot.) He doesn't even kick soccer style. Hell,
he even gets nervous. Even petrified.
So when Langford saw he'd have to kick a 50-yarder
from the right hashmark, he told himself, "Oh my God,
here I am."
Holder Eric Test calmed Langford, telling him to keep
his head down and follow through. So Langford, head
down, kicked it.
The ball wobbled, drifted to the right, wobbled some
more and finally arched over and between a
soon-to-be-destroyed pair of goalposts.
The Hero
When Langford finally looked up, "I just saw people
running at me." Those people mobbed him, hugged him,
lifted him up because the nervous All-American boy had
just become one of the Big Game's biggest heroes, the guy
whose third field goal of the day won it, 22-20.

WE’VE STILL GOT THE AXE These jubilant players and fans were sullen and hopeless before Mike Langford
transformed crushing defeat into memorable victory Saturday at Berkeley. Langford's 50-yard field goal gave Stanford a
22-20 victory over California in the 77th Big Game.
Stanford rcoters into unbridled
ecstacy, ant stunned the rest of
the 71,866 fans, who just sat
there, moticnless, for five minutes
after the game.
Cal players, and their coach,
Mike Whitq cried in the locker
room. But the Stanford locker
room scene was the most jubilant
"since the Ohio State Rose
Bowl," according to equipment
manager Dot Marvin.
The playtrs hugged each other,
yelled and ang a loud rendition
of "The Dirty Golden Bear." And
in a corner, the Stanford Axe lay
unattended, easy-to-steal.
Modest QB
In a corntr of the locker room,
Benjamin, ore of the least excited
persons present, modestly
explained thit while he was in the
game, "We got a couple of breaks
that Mike [Cbrdova, the forgotten
starting quarterback] could have
gotten too."
The Cardinals got only three
points during the first three
quarters. Coriova played well for
awhile, but the Bears' defense, as
Scott Laidhw explained, was
tough because "both teams run
the same offense," and the
defenses knev just how to stop
the familiar pays.
The Card defense was equally
tough, after giving up a first
touchdown set up by an
unbelievable one-handed grab by
Rivera, who aught nine passes for
205 yards. Hewas recruited to the
Farm by ore of the turncoat
assistant coathes who went to
work for Cal md took his recruits
with him. livera is the best
receiver mosl of the Stanford
players had ever seen, simply
outrunning Card defenders for
receptions.
Anyway, Cordova went sour
midway thrtugh the game,
sandwiching three straight
interceptions around halftime.
Coach Jack Christiansen gave
Cordova i score-or-else
ultimatum, anJ when the Cards
didn't move on the next
possession, in vtent Benjamin.
Better And Better
Benjamin hoked bad for a
couple series, but loosened up
after Stanford's defense recovered
a high punt snjp and gave the ball
to the offense oi the Bear nine.
Benjamin haided the ball to
Scott Laidlaw oi three of the four
plays from scrinmage, and on the
final play, a fourth and inches,
Laidlaw banged it across to make
it 13-10, Stanfoil.
Cal got the ball back and
marched downleld for awhile,
but Jeff Siemeis intercepted a
hurried Bartkavski pass and
returned it to the Card 40.
