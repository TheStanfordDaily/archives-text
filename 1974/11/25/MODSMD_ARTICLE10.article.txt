# U.N. Meddling In Mideast Useless
## 
### Jim Wascher 
Once again, the United Nations General
Assembly has come up with a solution for
"the Palestinian question." This should scare
the hell out of everybody. After all, four
major wars have been fought in the Mideast
as a result of the U.N.'s first attempt at a
solution back in 1948.
At that time, the Free World and
especially the United States, France and
Great Britain had refused to accept the
flood of Jews emerging from Nazi
concentration camps and Allied refugee
centers throughout Europe. Instead, they
were shopping around for another convenient
dumping ground for a group which has
suffered centuries of discrimination at the
hands of Europeans and Americans alike.
And so the great powers settled upon
Palestine, where Jewish terrorist groups such
as the Stern Gang and the Irgun had been
massacuring Arabs and British alike in their
campaign to recover Zion as a haven for the
Jews of the world.
Of course, as soon as the British left, the
Arab states which surrounded Israel invaded
the new nation with the avowed intention of
driving the Jews into the Mediterranean. The
Arabs even had ex-Nazis as military advisers.
But they failed to defeat Israel and even
managed to lose a little more of their own
land.
Three Mideast wars have been fought since
then. The Arabs lost all three originally

having taken the offensive in only one. More
importantly, a new Arab power emerged in
the Mideast during the years following the
Six Days' War of 1967: the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO).
Scarcely a week has gone by in the last
four years or so when a reader couldn't find
an item in the newspaper about Arab
terrorists hijacking a plane or attacking an
Israeli village. Places such as Munich, Lod
Airport and Maalot became topics of daily
conversation.
Meanwhile, as nation after nation was
forced to deal with the PLO on an equal
footing, the group gradually gained a
recognized position as the spokesman for a
nation even if that nation had no country
which it could actually call its own.
f
Reception For Arafat
The reception which PLO leader Yasir
Arafat received during his appearance before
the U.N. General Assembly last week is an
indication of the position to which his group
has risen.
And when the General Assembly voted
89-8 Friday that the Palestinian people have
"the right to national independence and
sovereignty," they seemed to be saying that
they had made a mistake in setting up the
Israeli state 26 years ago.
Another resolution, adopted by a 95-17

vote, granted the PLO a permanent observer
position at the U.N. This vote, in effect,
recognized the national status of the PLO
no entity other than a nation has ever
received an observer's position.
Where To Locate Palestinians
That's all well and good. Most Jews would
agree that Palestinians should have their own
country. The differences of opinion arise
when it comes to discussing where that
country should be. The PLO wants the land
currently occupied by the State of Israel;
Yitzhak Rabin and other Israeli leaders
would prefer to locate the Palestinians on the
west bank of the River Jordan, land seized by
Israel from Jordan in 1967, or in Jordan
itself.
The first U.N. resolution affirmed "the
inalienable right of the Palestinians to return
to their homes and property from which they
have been displaced and uprooted" and
called for their return. -
The U.N. members expressed their
support for a principle which I support in the
abstract, but ignored the reality of the
current situation. What is required is a lot of
hard-headed arbitration over the conflicting
property claims of the Israelis and the
Palestinians. All the U.N. has offered so far
has been mushy talk.
