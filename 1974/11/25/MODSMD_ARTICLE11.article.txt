# Exemption Is Easily Misunderstood
## 
### Bruce Kadden 
Norman Dupont's column
about the University manipulating
the law to its own ends (Daily
Nov. 22) contains three glaring
errors in its treatment of the
draw-exemption issue.
Whether the administration
"does not like fraternities" as
Dupont claims is debatable,
though for the sake of argument
this point can be conceded.
Dupont says that forcing
fraternities into the draw "offers
the University major advantages in
aiding the housing crunch without
a major increase in funding costs."
This claim is not correct,
because, as almost everyone
admits, putting fraternities in the
draw will only slightly lower the
eviction rate for men, and would
not increase the number of
students housed on campus.
In fact, the major difficulty is
not the current exemptions
granted to fraternities (which a lot
of people would like to see kept),
but proposals to change the
system which would extend the
draw-exemption privilege to other
living groups.
Same Displacement
The heart of the matter lies in
relation to distributing
displacement by the housing
draw. No matter what the
solution, the same number of
students would be housed on
campus.
Dupont's second error is his
claim that the University is
pressuring fraternities to join the
draw system because of Title IX,
which forbids discrimination on
the basis of sex. Nothing could be
more inaccurate. The Stanford
discrimination issue surfaced last
May, before Title IX regulations
were publicized.
Virtually everyone agrees that
the status quo cannot be
maintained because it
discriminates, regardless of
whether Title IX regulations
would force such a change.
Contrary to Dupont's view, the
Title IX argument is moot now,

and has always been moot. It only
forces the University to do what
everyone wants It to do
eliminate the discrimination.
Dupont thirdly theorizes that
HEW's amendments to Title IX
would allow the status quo to
exist. It is almost certain that this
theory is dead wrong. When Title
IX regulations were initially
proposed, there was a big question
whether fraternities could exist
at all on campus if they received
University support, regardless of
whether women were provided

with separate, but equal facilities.
It is of interest to note that
these changes by HEW come in
response to letters from, among
other groups and persons,
President Richard Lyman,
representing the University.
Lyman recognized that
possible interpretations of the
regulations "places the fraternity
system here in jeopardy." He
continued, "We believe that
student living groups should be
allowed to choose to be single-sex
so long as the quantity and

quality of housing available to
each sex is proportionate, and
that the regulations should be
appropriately amended so as to
permit this."
So much for Dupont's column.
It only points out that the issues
involved in the draw-exemption
issue are extremely complex and
confusing, requiring an extensive
examination before a thorough
understanding can be achieved.

whether Title IX regulations
would force such a change.
Contrary to Dupont's view, the
Title IX argument is moot now,

and has always been moot. It only
forces the University to do what
everyone wants It to do
eliminate the discrimination.
Dupont thirdly theorizes that
HEW's amendments to Title IX
would allow the status quo to
exist. It is almost certain that this
theory is dead wrong. When Title
IX regulations were initially
proposed, there was a big question
whether fraternities could exist
at all on campus if they received
University support, regardless of
whether women were provided

with separate, but equal facilities.
It is of interest to note that
these changes by HEW come in
response to letters from, among
other groups and persons,
President Richard Lyman,
representing the University.
Lyman recognized that
possible interpretations of the
regulations "places the fraternity
system here in jeopardy." He
continued, "We believe that
student living groups should be
allowed to choose to be single-sex
so long as the quantity and

quality of housing available to
each sex is proportionate, and
that the regulations should be
appropriately amended so as to
permit this."
So much for Dupont's column.
It only points out that the issues
involved in the draw-exemption
issue are extremely complex and
confusing, requiring an extensive
examination before a thorough
understanding can be achieved.

Norman Dupont's column
about the University manipulating
the law to its own ends (Daily
Nov. 22) contains three glaring
errors in its treatment of the
draw-exemption issue.
Whether the administration
"does not like fraternities" as
Dupont claims is debatable,
though for the sake of argument
this point can be conceded.
Dupont says that forcing
fraternities into the draw "offers
the University major advantages in
aiding the housing crunch without
a major increase in funding costs."
This claim is not correct,
because, as almost everyone
admits, putting fraternities in the
draw will only slightly lower the
eviction rate for men, and would
not increase the number of
students housed on campus.
In fact, the major difficulty is
not the current exemptions
granted to fraternities (which a lot
of people would like to see kept),
but proposals to change the
system which would extend the
draw-exemption privilege to other
living groups.
Same Displacement
The heart of the matter lies in
relation to distributing
displacement by the housing
draw. No matter what the
solution, the same number of
students would be housed on
campus.
Dupont's second error is his
claim that the University is
pressuring fraternities to join the
draw system because of Title IX,
which forbids discrimination on
the basis of sex. Nothing could be
more inaccurate. The Stanford
discrimination issue surfaced last
May, before Title IX regulations
were publicized.
Virtually everyone agrees that
the status quo cannot be
maintained because it
discriminates, regardless of
whether Title IX regulations
would force such a change.
Contrary to Dupont's view, the
Title IX argument is moot now,

and has always been moot. It only
forces the University to do what
everyone wants It to do
