# Israel Isn't Imperialistic
## 
### Robert Michael Smith 
Merritt Ruhlen, in his attempt to disprove the
"myth" concerning the relationship between
anti-Israel feeling and anti-Semitism (Daily,. Nov.
20), only creates more myths.
Israel is not, as Ruhlen claims, a creation of
Europeans, nor of imperialists. It is a creation of
Jews. One only has to look back upon Jewish
literature and prayer from the time of the Jewish
expulsion from Palestine (135 A.D.) until 1948 to
realize that the desire for returning to their
homeland and rebuilding a Jewish state was a
constant and uniting thought in the minds of the
world's Jews. The greatest desire that any Jew
could express prior to 1948 was to see the Jewish
people returned to Zion.
Nor has the Israeli government banished the
Palestinian Arabs from Israel. All Palestinians in
refugee camps left Israel voluntarily. This is
evidenced by the large Arab population which
remains in present-day Israel. Moreover, Israeli
Arabs enjoy the full rights of all Israeli citizens,
such as voting, freedom of movement and serving
in government. As just one example, there are
several Arab members of the Knesset, the Israeli
parliament.
Israel Offers Equality
The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)
demands the removal of most Jews from Palestine.
The Palestinian National Covenant, the
authoritative statement of PLO goals, recognizes as
future Jewish inhabitants of a new Palestinian state
only those Jews who lived in Palestine "before the
Zionist invasion," which Yasir Arafat sets at 1881,
when there were only 20,000 Jews in Palestine.
Contrary to Ruhlen's beliefs, there already exists in
the Middle East a "democratic state in which
Arabs, Jews and Christians are treated as equals":

and that state is Israel.
I, as Ruhlen, do not believe in turning my back
on the Palestinian people. I recognize their
legitimate demands for a state in the Middle East. I
fail to see, however, why it is necessary to destroy
Israel as a Jewish state, and kick out of their
homeland 2.5 million of its Jewish residents, to
establish this Palestinian state.
Anti-Semitic Myth
Lastly, let me address myself to Ruhlen's first
statement. No, one does not have to be
anti-Semitic to be anti-Israel. But though Ruhlen
obviously does not consider himself an anti-Semite,
he has fallen prey to history's greatest anti-Semitic
myths. Foremost among these is that the Jews are a
race, when in reality they are only a religious,
cultural and ethnic group.
Second is the myth of "Zionist propaganda."
Zionist propaganda imples that there exists an
official Zionist leadership the "Elders of Zion,"
as anti-Semites throughout history have referred to
them of an official Zionist organization that!
cranks out official Zionist propaganda and that
determines official Zionist policy.
As a Jew, believe me: There is no such thing as
the Elders of Zion. Please, Ruhlen, talk about
either "Israeli" propaganda or "Jewish"
propaganda; but don't propagate myths that there
is a Zionist machine.
Let us all realize that the only solution to the
Middle East problem is the coexistence of a Jewish
and a Palestinian state. Any plan which fails to
establish and preserve the political integrity of both
groups would in turn fail to provide a lasting and
just peace.
