Libertarian Hypocrisy
Editor:
The campaign against the
pollution and waste of the Bonfire 4
has gone up in smoke. Here is a
suggestion which would lead to a
far greater amelioration.
I recently attended a teach-in
which, like most teach-ins, was
one-sided and sloppy. It was held
in a classroom where' large signs
said "No smoking!" A number of
the speakers and the audience
disregarded this injunction.
Some of the polluting puffers
were obviously slobs who cannot
control themselves: I requested
one woman next to me to desist;
she did, but within five minutes J
out came another polluter. Some
of the puffers, or rather suckers,
had in their eyes the glint which
lost souls feel at resisting
authority, however legitimate.
There was no consideration for
the others present, none for the
University's problems with
janitorial service and fire
insurance. These individuals are
clearly totally self-centered.
If our classroom lucifers would
quit and give the money thus
saved to feeding the hungry, a
serious pollution problem would
be abated and many fed. Until
they are willing to put their
money where their mouth is I
shall not take their libertarianism
seriously.

PLO Propaganda?
Editor:
The propaganda piece for the
Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) by Merritt
Ruhlen (Daily, Nov. 19), called
"A Current Myth," contains some
horrible distortions of history that
cannot go unchallenged. He says
Israel was created "25 years ago
by armed aggression against the
indigenous people of the area, the
Palestinian Arabs."
Israel was created legally by
the United Nations, and the
indigenous people of the area
were the Jews who stayed, and
also some Palestinian Arabs who
also stayed. When the collective
mass of armed Moslem nations
invaded they told the "Palestinian
Arabs" if they wanted to share in
the spoils they had better leave so
that the armies wouldn't kill them
by confusing them with the Jews
on the land.
The San Francisco Chronicle's
"morgue" of 1947-48 has the full
story, as do most reliable history
books, and the Israeli government
has recordings of radio programs
beamed into Israel telling the
people (in Arabic) to leave in
advance of the invading armies.
The remainder of Ruhlen's
exhortation has other such
monstrous distortions, but simply
dealing with this one serves to
alert one to his venemous
distortions.

A quotation attributed to
Acting President William Miller in
the Nov. 22 issue of the Daily
confirmed my darkest suspicions
about the administration's view of
the role of Stanford in society.
Responding to a question about
how increases in tuition and
cutbacks in academic programs
will affect Stanford, Miller said,
"It depends not only on what we
do but on what the competition
does." That's right "what the
competition does."
Are colleges and universities
striving together in a question for
knowledge or for the general good
of society? Hell, no! They are
merchandising 57 varieties of cat
food, and if your quality goes
down while the price goes ip,
that's okay as Ntfng as the
"competition" does it too. You
pay your tuition and room
board for four years, and you buy
a degree. It's all pretty disgusting,
and I hope Miller can come up
with a good explanation.

A quotation attributed to
Acting President William Miller in
the Nov. 22 issue of the Daily
confirmed my darkest suspicions
about the administration's view of
the role of Stanford in society.
Responding to a question about
how increases in tuition and
cutbacks in academic programs
will affect Stanford, Miller said,
"It depends not only on what we
do but on what the competition
does." That's right "what the
competition does."
Are colleges and universities
striving together in a question for
knowledge or for the general good
of society? Hell, no! They are
merchandising 57 varieties of cat
food, and if your quality goes
down while the price goes ip,
that's okay as Ntfng as the
"competition" does it too. You
pay your tuition and room
board for four years, and you buy
a degree. It's all pretty disgusting,
and I hope Miller can come up
with a good explanation.

The campaign against the
pollution and waste of the Bonfire 4
has gone up in smoke. Here is a
suggestion which would lead to a
far greater amelioration.
I recently attended a teach-in
which, like most teach-ins, was
one-sided and sloppy. It was held
in a classroom where' large signs
said "No smoking!" A number of
the speakers and the audience
disregarded this injunction.
Some of the polluting puffers
were obviously slobs who cannot
control themselves: I requested
one woman next to me to desist;
she did, but within five minutes J
out came another polluter. Some
of the puffers, or rather suckers,
had in their eyes the glint which
lost souls feel at resisting
authority, however legitimate.
There was no consideration for
the others present, none for the
University's problems with
janitorial service and fire
insurance. These individuals are
clearly totally self-centered.
If our classroom lucifers would
quit and give the money thus
saved to feeding the hungry, a
serious pollution problem would
be abated and many fed. Until
they are willing to put their
money where their mouth is I
shall not take their libertarianism
seriously.

PLO Propaganda?
Editor:
The propaganda piece for the
Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) by Merritt
Ruhlen (Daily, Nov. 19), called
"A Current Myth," contains some
horrible distortions of history that
cannot go unchallenged. He says
Israel was created "25 years ago
by armed aggression against the
indigenous people of the area, the
Palestinian Arabs."
Israel was created legally by
the United Nations, and the
indigenous people of the area
were the Jews who stayed, and
also some Palestinian Arabs who
also stayed. When the collective
mass of armed Moslem nations
invaded they told the "Palestinian
Arabs" if they wanted to share in
the spoils they had better leave so
that the armies wouldn't kill them
by confusing them with the Jews
on the land.
The San Francisco Chronicle's
"morgue" of 1947-48 has the full
story, as do most reliable history
books, and the Israeli government
has recordings of radio programs
beamed into Israel telling the
people (in Arabic) to leave in
advance of the invading armies.
The remainder of Ruhlen's
exhortation has other such
monstrous distortions, but simply
dealing with this one serves to
alert one to his venemous
distortions.
