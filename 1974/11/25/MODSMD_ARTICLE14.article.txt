## ‘Incomparable’ Music For Big Game Eve Enlivens The Streets Of San Francisco 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO —They meander
across California Street, mostly in
single file.
They make a point of walking single
file, slowly.
Stopped motorists and motorcade
police look on, helpless in the face of a
phenomenon they don't really
comprehend and are nearly unable to
control the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching
Band.
Gathered for their annual assault on
The City, undaunted by a ban on
street parading that has drastically cut
the scale of their most glorious gig, the
Incomparables line up in the driveway

of the Mark Hopkins Hotel.
Seconds later, following three sharp
blasts from drum major Buzz
Thompson's whistle, the
Incomparables burst through the big
glass doors blaring out "Come Join
The Band."
Breakthrough
Bandsmen in the central ranks
make a point of going through the
revolving door, one at a time. One
bandsman carries the Marijuana Tuba
through.
Inside the lobby, doormen and
patrons smile inanely, not quite
certain what they're seeing or why
they're seeing it. Near the ground floor
bar, well-attired men sway their glasses

in time with the music.
Only the assembled grads of the
Class of 1949 understand what's
happening. Inside the hotel's ballroom,
approximately 150 alumni and spouses
cheer wildly as the Incomparables
snake into the center of the room.
"They look young," murmurs one
of the alum wives. Her opinion is
echoed throughout the room.
Dolly Daze
While totally overpowered by the
music, the Class of '49 is fascinated by
the dollies. Men in classically tailored
suits shimmy clumsily, trying not to
spill their drinks while mimmicking
the luscious ladies before them.
"No girl would get up in front of
the rooting section when we were
young," comments one woman with a
smile that somehow betrays an inner
thought you've come a long way,
baby.
"They're so young," says one wife
who is herself quite lovely.
"I know, I know," murmurs her
friend.
Cocktail Chatter
The alums smile, cheer, clap and
stomp, but the quantum leap between
the Stanford they knew and the
Stanford of today holds their
attention and fills the cocktail
conversation.
"You guys are all the Class of '49?"
queries an alum.
"No, you are," a student explains
gently.
"Not me," protests the alum.
But age is the only alienation
between the Incomparables and their
audience, and students and alums join
together as the band plays "Hail,
Stanford, Hail" the alums stand out
because they know the words.
Three whistles the Incomparables
retreat, garnering departing hits off
alumni drinks and shaking hands as
they go.

In the lobby, an elderly lady
wrapped in mink grabs the hand of a
passing student, thinking he is a
bandsman.
"This is marvelous," she gasps.
"Thank you! Good luck!"
Tumbling back out the front doors
of the Mark Hopkins, Thompson
attempts to get the Red Menace back
into something resembling marching
order a largely hopeless task. Finally
lined up, the ranks move out into the
street and immediately mutate.
It isn't the fact that the band
breaks ranks it's the students who
march behind, beside and within the
band, making the contingent look
rather motley.
Heading out from the Mark
Hopkins, the Incomparables are led by
motorcycle cops who occasionally
astound the masses by riding down the
sidewalk to get back to the front of
the parade. The police block sections
and keep the marchers from being run
down by marauding cable cars and
unsuspecting taxis.
Innocent Bystanders
Overhead, innocent citizens are
roused from their televisions by the
incessant drumming and stomping.
People wave from the windows of
their flats. Bandsmen and students
salute with forked fingers and
clenched fists.
A girl in a pink bathrobe excites
bandsmen to new heights of rampant
rowdiness they holler and wave
wildly to the surprised woman.
For the ' people walking along
with the band, keeping step isn't easy:
the drums break into a Santana
rhythm, stop abruptly, then "ONE,
TWO - One, TWO, ONETWOTHREE
FOUR!"
The entire band turns 360 degrees
in mid-march, hooting and shouting.
The drums return to noimal tempo,
but only for a few blocks:

"ONE, TWO - ONE, TWO,
ONETWOTHREEFOUR."
By the time the Red Tide hits the
beach near The Cannery, most of the
students have mastered the turn, and
the knowledge is shared by tourists
and city natives who have joined the
parade.
Stanford Serenade
At the Hyde Park gazebo, the
Incomparables wrap up Big Game Eve
by seranading about 1000 students,
tourists, and alums. When the band

hits the opening blast of the Revised
Stanford Fight Song, "All Right
Now," half the crowd bounds two feet
in the air.
Keeping their customers satisfied,
the band encores with its new "orgasm
chart," "Livin' In the USA," and
exits to the slow samba of "Tell Her
She's Lovely."
In best LSJUMB tradition, part of
Hyde Park's gazebo magically
disappears along with the disheveled
dollies and footweary bandsmen.

SPIR IT RO USERS-'When topless entertainer Carol Doda (left) brought a piece
oi San rranciscos Broadway Street to this year's Big Game, some spectators
were reminded of the band's 1971 Big Game Eve march down Broadway, where
several topless dancers answered the call to "Come Join the Band." This year the
band joined Doda when she took her cue from bandleader Buzz Thompson and
mspired the Incomparables to new heights of pre-game musical achievement.


SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE—Merrymakers at a 1972 Big Game alumni
reunion in San Francisco wonder if this dolly is typical of today's Stanford. The
scene was repeated Friday night when the band and dollies entertained at alumni
parties during the traditional LSJUMB romp through The City
