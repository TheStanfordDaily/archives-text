# Bettelheim Probes Problems Faced By Modern Families

### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The problems faced by modern
families are more "esoteric" than
those faced by families four
generations ago, Bruno
Bettelheim, visiting professor of
education and psychiatry, said
Thursday.
Speaking to 400 people at the
Tresidder Speakers Series,
Bettelheim emphasized that
modern family problems are
certainly no worse, but they
require different solutions.
"Anxiety in the past was for
sheer survival," he explained,
adding that contemporary families
have to deal with intangibles, like
personality development and
resentment among family
members.
Bettelheim, formerly the
director of a school for
emotionally disturbed children at
the University of Chicago, noted
that children remain dependent
for many years longer than they
used to.

While the age of physical
maturity has dropped from 17 to
13, the age of economic
dependence has. risen from 14 to
20, he said. This prolonged
dependency is bound to create
"tremendous stresses and strains
within the family," he suggested.
The tension is increased by
what Bettelheim called a "simple
but dangerous truth." He said that
only in the last 50 years have
people realized that "if the
children are a little strange, the
parents have a lot to do with it."
In the past, parents could
attribute a "bad child" to chance,
he said. But now, middle-class
parents feel that they are failures
if their children are not model
citizens, he added.
A reformed adult can also be
welcomed back into the family
"because he had not damaged the
self-respect of the parent,"
Bettelheim said.
"To raise children is a very
expensive venture," Bettelheim
noted, adding that people expect
certain returns on their
investment.
Before Medicare, pensions and
social security, parents gave their
children food and shelter,
expecting their children to care
for them in old age, he explained.
But now, old people can care
for themselves, Bettelheim said,
and parents expect respect and a
"justification for their existence"

from their children.
"Because we exfEct returns on
our investment, we :-annot accept
that our childrei are just
average," Bettelhein suggested.
Bettelheim waned future
parents not to exp<ct a perfectly
happy family. All living groups
have conflicts and cfises as well as
good times, he said.
"A happy family is one where
the family members... are happy
that they are meftbers of this
family rather than apy other," he
concluded.
