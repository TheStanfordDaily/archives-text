# Ex-Convict Criticizes His Trial
## 
### MARK LICKER 
Morton Sobell, convicted with
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg for
conspiracy to commit espionage
in 1951, said Friday night that the
public must support defendants in
what he termed "political trials."
Speaking at the First
Presbyterian Church of Palo Alto,
Sobell characterized the
Rosenberg case as "a classic
political trial" that no one
understood.
He said the trial "had one
intrinsic purpose: to equate being
a communist or a communist
sympathizing liberal with being an
enemy of the people."
Claiming that "the ACLU
[American Civil Liberties Union]
today is ashamed of the position
[it] took" regarding the trial, he
concluded that "an adequate
defense was impossible."
Sobell and the Rosenbergs
were convicted after Ethel's
brother, David Greenglass, and
Max Elitcher testified that they
discussed defense secrets with
them.
The Rosenbergs were
sentenced to death for collecting
secret information on the atomic
bomb, and were executed. Sobell,
only convicted of conspiracy to
acquire naval secrets, is free on
parole after serving 15 years of a
30-year prison sentence.
He said that prosecution
exhibits such as diagrams of bomb
mechanisms "were fakes to begin
with" and that "Greenglass drew
them after the arrest."
Drawing a parallel between his
case and the more recent trials of
the Chicago Seven and San
Quentin Six, Sobell said he felt
that experiences in the 1960s
"pushed back the frontiers of
what is acceptable conduct in
court."
He said he now hopes the
Rosenbergs will be vindicated by
challenges to social injustice at
such trials as the ones for the
participants in the Attica prison
revolt and those stemming from
assault and murder charges against
Black Panther Huey Newton.
Attorney Louis Nizer's book
about the Rosenberg case, The
Implosion Conspiracy, received
criticism from Sobell, who called
Nizer a "shyster" and the book a
"fraud."
"Nizer could say it was a fair
trial, but forgot what happened
when I filed six appeals," Sobell
said.
