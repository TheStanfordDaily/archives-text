# University Holding Shares In Alleged Drilling Swindle
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Stanford holds what was once almost
$200,000 worth of shares in
oil-drilling programs of a bankrupt
Tulsa concern that is accused of
swindling some $lOO million from
investors.
The shares in ventures of
Home-Stake Production Co. were
donated to the University about three
years ago, according to Rodney
Adams, director of finance. However,
Stanford was never able to determine
the shares' worth, and thus never
assigned them a value on the
University's books.

, It could not immediately be
determined who donated the shares.
According to the Wall Street
Journal, Stanford is just one of 485
universities, hospitals, foundations and
other charities that received gifts of
Home-Stake shares. Donors reportedly
paid some $26 million for the shares
they later gave away, but the Internal
Revenue Service is challenging their
tax deductions on grounds that the
shares' real value was considerably less.
Ponzi Scheme
Home-Stake which is unrelated
to the San Francisco-based Homestake
Mining Co. or other concerns with

Home-Stake in their names is alleged
by the Securities and Exchange
Commission to have been a gigantic
Ponzi scheme, a type of swindle
named after a Boston entrepreneur of
a half-century ago.
A Ponzi scheme is basically a
pyramid, in which part of an
investor's money is returned to him
disguised as "'profit." Typically, large
initial returns are used to lure
progressively larger investments, and
money from newer investors is used to
pay off earlier ones.
The Journal reported this summer
that many prominent entertainers and
businessmen had invested in
Home-Stake as a tax shelter. These
included Jack Benny, Liza Minelli,
Barbara Steisand, Andy Williams,
Walter W. Wristin (chairman of
Citicorp, parent of the nation's second
largest bank) and George J.W.
Goodman, former editor of the
business magazine Institutional
Investor and author (under the
pseudonym 'Adam Smith') of several
best-selling books on investing.
Deduction Unknown
The shares eventually donated to
Stanford cost their original buyer
$198,020, the Journal reported. It
wasn't known, however, how large a

deduction the buyer took when he
donated his shares.
Adams said the University didn't
receive an estimate of the shares'
worth from the donor, and repeatedly
wrote to the company itself seeking an
estimate. However, he said, the
University never received a satisfactory
answer, and thus never assigned the
shares a value for bookkeeping
purposes.
"We saw something fishy when we
got what were basically form letters in
response to our inquiries," Adams said
yesterday. "It was never anything we
could blow the whistle on, but those
kind of responses aren't uncommon
when a company is coming apart at
the seams."

At about the same time Stanford
was making those inquiries, the SEC
and IRS were investigating
Home-Stake's operations and claimed
assets.
Adams said the University has filed
a claim for restriction if and when
Home-Stake's assets are liquidated.
However, there is virtually no chance
it will collect the full $198,020 the*
donor paid for the shares.
According to the Journal, * the
University of Oklahoma Foundation
Trippet's alma mater was the biggest
beneficiary of Home-Stake shares,
receiving gifts for which investors
originally paid some $3.1 million.*
Among other private universities,
Harvard received $448,795, Columbia
$160,500 and Yale $117,457.
