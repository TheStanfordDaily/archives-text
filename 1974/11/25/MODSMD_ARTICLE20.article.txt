It was a great weekend for Stanford as the
Cardinals won one of the most exciting Big Games in
history.
Stanford safety Jeff Siemens (17) (top) teams how
it is to be on the other side of bone-bruising tackles.
Siemens intercepted a Steve Bartkowski pass in the
fourth quarter, killing a key drive, but fumbled after
being hit. Luckily for the Cards, those two Cal
players reacted more quickly with their eyes than
with their feet, and Stanford recovered.
Above, safety Doc Blanchard, who played a great
final game, hits Cat running back Chuck Muncie for
no gain during a futile goal line stand.
Blanchard was one of the seniors introduced the
previous night at the bonfire (right) which returned
bigger and better (or worse, depending on your point
of view) than ever Friday night.
In the end, though, one junior, kicker Mike
Lang ford, was responsible for the success of the
weekend. Langford booted this winning 50-yarder
(below) as time expired to win the game. Cat coach
Mike White, soon to begin weeping, looks on
nervously from his vantage point, just above the ball.
