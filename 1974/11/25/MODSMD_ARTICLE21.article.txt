# Defensive Heroics Set Up Late Surge

### TIM FERGUSON 
BERKELEY - Though Mike
Langford and Guy Benjamin were
the most obvious heroes,
Stanford's defense may have been
equally responsible for the Cards'
22-20 win over California here
Saturday.
Maligned earlier this season
when the likes of Illinois and San
Jose State pushed it around, the
defense arose Saturday to
sufficiently tame the Pacific
Eight's best passing combination.
Defensive line coach Gunther
Cunningham, always a fancier of
the superlative, called the game
"the best defensive effort I've ever
been associated with."
Defensive coordinator Norb
Hecker wouldn't go so far, saying
his unit's play in its 20-18 win
over Washington State earlier this
year "was awfully good." But, he
said of his men's Big Game effort,
"When we needed it, they came
through."
Failed Once
Actually, Stanford's defenders
did fail dramatically once, on
Cal's march to an apparent
game-winning touchdown. But
that sin was forgiven by a
miraculous field goal which
wouldn't have been possible had
Cal quarterback Steve Bartkowski
not been sufficiently harrassed all
day.
The nation's leading passer was
sacked for 42 yards in losses and
bruised mercilessly when he did
get the ball away.
"That was our game plan," said
Hecker. "Put pressure on him.
Given time, he's super."
"Every time I looked up, he
was on the ground," said
Cunningham of Bartkowski.
But Bart, whose Heismap
Trophy aspirations may have been
sunk by Stanford's last minute
comeback, was a tough customer.
He still completed 20 of 41 passes
for 318 yards.
"He really hung in there,
though we were really hitting him

hard," Card defensive end Duncan
McColl commented. 'That's the
mark of a great quarterback."
'Unbelievable'
"Bart is just tremendous,
unbelievable," said cornerback
Kelly Walker, who should know.
He was stung for Cal's go-ahead
touchdown with 26 seconds left
by a pass to split end Steve
Rivera,'without doubt the league's
premier receiver.
Bartkowski and Rivera worked
on Walker throughout the final
Cal drive, realizing, as Walker put
it, "I couldn't cover him. He was
too quick."
"How many times did he
[Bart] throw at you?" a friend
asked Walker in the locker room.
"Too many," replied the
near-goat, puffing on a cigar
reminiscent of ones which often
protrude from John McKay's
well-oiled mouth.
But Rivera's corner pattern for
the touchdown, which evoked the
greatest response from
Berkeleyites since the Free Speech
Movement, turned out for naught
in part because of the job
Walker and his fellow backs did
on Cal receivers most of the day.
"Our deep backs helped us out
a lot," said linebacker Geb
Church. 'They kept their men
covered and gave us more time to
rush Bartkowski."
Bear offensive linemen had
their hands full with the
determined Card rush, and
weren't quite up to the match.
Noseguard Drew Palin was
complimentary nonetheless:
'They weren't that physical, but
they blocked well as a unit."
But the Cal linemen also may
have contributed to their own
demise by tipping off Stanford
linebackers on what to expect.
"We were reading their line all
day," said Card linebacker Gordy
Riegel., "and calling signals telling
our defensive linemen whether
they'd pass or pitch or run."

Bear offensive linemen had
their hands full with the
determined Card rush, and
weren't quite up to the match.
Noseguard Drew Palin was
complimentary nonetheless:
'They weren't that physical, but
they blocked well as a unit."
But the Cal linemen also may
have contributed to their own
demise by tipping off Stanford
linebackers on what to expect.

day," said Card linebacker Gordy

BERKELEY - Though Mike
Langford and Guy Benjamin were
the most obvious heroes,
Stanford's defense may have been
equally responsible for the Cards'
22-20 win over California here
Saturday.
Maligned earlier this season
when the likes of Illinois and San
Jose State pushed it around, the
defense arose Saturday to
sufficiently tame the Pacific
Eight's best passing combination.
Defensive line coach Gunther
Cunningham, always a fancier of
the superlative, called the game
"the best defensive effort I've ever
been associated with."
Defensive coordinator Norb
Hecker wouldn't go so far, saying
his unit's play in its 20-18 win
over Washington State earlier this
year "was awfully good." But, he
said of his men's Big Game effort,
"When we needed it, they came
through."
Failed Once
Actually, Stanford's defenders
did fail dramatically once, on
Cal's march to an apparent
game-winning touchdown. But
that sin was forgiven by a
miraculous field goal which
wouldn't have been possible had
Cal quarterback Steve Bartkowski
not been sufficiently harrassed all
day.
The nation's leading passer was
sacked for 42 yards in losses and
bruised mercilessly when he did
get the ball away.
"That was our game plan," said
Hecker. "Put pressure on him.
Given time, he's super."
"Every time I looked up, he
was on the ground," said
Cunningham of Bartkowski.
But Bart, whose Heismap
Trophy aspirations may have been
sunk by Stanford's last minute
comeback, was a tough customer.
He still completed 20 of 41 passes
for 318 yards.
"He really hung in there,
though we were really hitting him

hard," Card defensive end Duncan
McColl commented. 'That's the
mark of a great quarterback."
'Unbelievable'
"Bart is just tremendous,
unbelievable," said cornerback
Kelly Walker, who should know.
He was stung for Cal's go-ahead
touchdown with 26 seconds left
by a pass to split end Steve
Rivera,'without doubt the league's
premier receiver.
Bartkowski and Rivera worked
on Walker throughout the final
Cal drive, realizing, as Walker put
it, "I couldn't cover him. He was
too quick."
"How many times did he
[Bart] throw at you?" a friend
asked Walker in the locker room.
"Too many," replied the
near-goat, puffing on a cigar
reminiscent of ones which often
protrude from John McKay's
well-oiled mouth.
But Rivera's corner pattern for
the touchdown, which evoked the
greatest response from
Berkeleyites since the Free Speech
Movement, turned out for naught
in part because of the job
Walker and his fellow backs did
on Cal receivers most of the day.
"Our deep backs helped us out
a lot," said linebacker Geb
Church. 'They kept their men
covered and gave us more time to
rush Bartkowski."
