# Better Than Ever, Say Observers
## The
						Bonfire Is Really Back 
### GLENN GARVIN 
"I can't believe this," one senior said Friday
night, surveying tie throngs of alcohol-fueled
football fans crowted into the Lagunita lakebed.
"It's just like old tines."
And so it was. There were the masses of
students, chattering! with old enthusiasm about
tomorrow's game. Tiere was Don Bunce, remnant
of happier days for Stanford's football team. And
best of all, there wasthe Bonfire, towering over the
whole assemblage likta brooding giant.
Not since 1971 hid Stanford seen a sight like
this. In the days snce then the Bonfire had
apparently died of in overdose of rain and an
underdose of enthusiasm. The happy fans were in
large part lacking beciuse the football team wasn't
winning often enouh because it didn't have
enough players like D<n Bunce.
But Friday night viped that all away.
Another QB
"I'm just what you needed another
quarterback up here," Bunce jibed as he moved to
the microphone to reid the traditional pre-Bonfire
history of the Axe that mystical symbol of
Stanford-Cal football supremacy.
Unfortunately, Brnce didn't write his own
speech, and had trouble with some of the words
with more than two s-llables. "BUNCE: HOW DID
YOU GET INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL?" Band
members chanted. 'Put in Boryla!" someone
yelled, repeating a cleer popular in the old days
when Bunce was the tarting quarterback and Mike
Boryla the backup mai.
Finally, after on< particularly bad round of
stumbling, a Bandsmai handed him a joint with the
advice "Mellow out, Bunce." Everyone broke up.
The crowd listenec dutifully to his speech, booing
when he told of Cal's original theft of the Axe,and
cheering when he re<ounted how Stanford stole it
back.
Too Patient
"These people don't sound like Stanford
students," one obserer said wondrously. "They're
too damn patient."
Then finally it Wis time to get on with the
evening's business: torching the huge wooden tower
that seemed to appear out of nowhere earlier in the

week.
Throughout the day rumors had flown that
anti-Bonfire ecology groups, angry at the
University's refusal to stop the event, would try to
block it themselves. One story had it that a group
of students from Columbae House would circle the
Bonfire to keep anyone from lighting it.
Another, more dramatic, rumor said a student
would actually climb atop the structure and refuse
to come down, resulting in either the Bpnfire's
cancellation or the student's barbecue.
But that's what it all turned out to be: rumor,
and nothing else. "We had no trouble at all," said
Mike Nilsson, president of the Inter-Fraternity,
Council, which sponsored the Bonfire. "It went off
without a hitch."
Olympic Start
When Bunce finished his speech, Nilsson turned
off the floodlights brightening the speaker's stage.
Bonfire organizers appeared with torches, and
sprinted across the lake Olympic-style as the Band's
drummers hammered out a thunderous crescendo.
The drums reached their peak just as the first
torch hit the Bonfire, and nothing happened. It
didn't go off. Everyone just stood there, marveling
at this cosmic anti-climax.
Finally which is to say three seconds later a
tiny tongue of flame crept up one side of the
structure. A few seconds later the whole thing lit
up like a nuclear holocuast.
Amazing Fire
"This is absolutely AMAZING" a freshmen said.
"I've never seen anything like it." It's an apt
description; superlatives fail where the Bonfire is
concerned. "It looks like it's lighting up the whole
goddam world," another exclaimed.
Most of the 3300 who packed the lake had never
seen a Bonfire before. They were impressed. A few
had. They were more impressed. "This is even
bigger than I remembered it," one said. That this
Bonfire could successfully compete with another,
incredibly stretched by three years of hazy
memory, was a tribute indeed.
As the flames continued, one man, remembering
all the bitter talk of pollution, joked, "Don't you
feel guilty?" The unspoken answer was no. As the
audience trooped out of Lagunita into the present,
they didn't feel bad at all.
