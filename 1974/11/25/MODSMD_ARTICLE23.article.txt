# Rose Bowl Roundup
## It's Ohio State, USC Again 
### 
Hours before Mike Langford
had booted Stanford's winning
points over Berkeley on Saturday,
Ohio State had finished throwing
the Big 10 Rose Bowl race into its
second straight year of confusion.
The Buckeyes beat the Michigan
Wolverines, 12-10, to capture a tie
for the league title. The victory
left both teams with identical
league and non-league records for
the third straight year.
It wasn't until a day later that
Buckeye fans knew for sure that
Ohio State would be the Big 10's
Rose Bowl representative. The
decision to send the Buckeyes was
reached yesterday after a secret
ballot of the conference athletic
directors.
The Big 10 commissioner
refused to comment on the details
of the voting, but it is certain that
Ohio State received more than
half of the votes.
Ohio State set up the crucial
vote by beating the Wolverines
without ever crossing the goal
line. Place kicker Tom Klaban
punched through all 12 of the
Buckeye's points.

Michigan had a chance to take
the game and the league
championship with only 18
seconds left on a 33-yard field
goal. The situation was exactly
the same last year in the Big 10
decider between the two schools,
and again, like last year,
Michigan's kicking specialist, Mike
Lantry, missed the shot.
The Wolverines have a 30-2-1
record over the past three seasons,
but have been unable to attend
any bowl games due to the
current Rose Bowl pact.
The Pac-8 had a much easier
time determining its
representative. Southern
California made it clear who the
best team in the league is by
trouncing crosstown rival UCLA
in the same fashion as it
steamrolled Stanford two weeks
ago.
The Trojans got off to a quick
start in Los Angeles and never let
up. Minutes into the third quarter,
the Trojans scored to push the
score to 24-9. UCLA Coach Dick
Vermeil called that the turning
point.
"We just couldn't stop their
offense," Vermeil said.

Anthony Davis led the
unstoppable offense with 190
rushing yards which gave him
enough to surpass O.J. Simpson as
the all-time leading Pac-8 ground
gainer.
The win gave USC undisputed
first place in the Pac-8, with their
tie against Cal being the only
mark on an otherwise perfect
league season. The Bruins dropped
into a tie for third in the standings
with Cal, giving Stanford a lone
hold on the second place notch.
The Northwestern Pac-8 teams
battled it out among themselves
for the remaining four places in
the standings. Oregon State
secured a tie for fifth place with
Washington by coming from
behind to beat hapless Oregon,
33-16. Oregon has lost its last
eight games, and stands by itself
in the league with an 0-7 record.
Washington downed
Washington State by a 24-7 score
behind Husky quarterback Dennis
Fitzpatrick's 250 rushing yards.
The Cougars were never in the
game and lost the Apple Cup
symbol of the state's best football
squad to Washington for the
first time in three years.

Hours before Mike Langford
had booted Stanford's winning
points over Berkeley on Saturday,
Ohio State had finished throwing
the Big 10 Rose Bowl race into its
second straight year of confusion.
The Buckeyes beat the Michigan
Wolverines, 12-10, to capture a tie
for the league title. The victory
left both teams with identical
league and non-league records for
the third straight year.
It wasn't until a day later that
Buckeye fans knew for sure that
Ohio State would be the Big 10's
Rose Bowl representative. The
decision to send the Buckeyes was
reached yesterday after a secret
ballot of the conference athletic
directors.
The Big 10 commissioner
refused to comment on the details
of the voting, but it is certain that
Ohio State received more than
half of the votes.
Ohio State set up the crucial
vote by beating the Wolverines
without ever crossing the goal
line. Place kicker Tom Klaban
punched through all 12 of the
Buckeye's points.

Michigan had a chance to take
the game and the league
championship with only 18
seconds left on a 33-yard field
goal. The situation was exactly
the same last year in the Big 10
decider between the two schools,
and again, like last year,
Michigan's kicking specialist, Mike
Lantry, missed the shot.
The Wolverines have a 30-2-1
record over the past three seasons,
but have been unable to attend
any bowl games due to the
current Rose Bowl pact.
The Pac-8 had a much easier
time determining its
representative. Southern
California made it clear who the
best team in the league is by
trouncing crosstown rival UCLA
in the same fashion as it
steamrolled Stanford two weeks
ago.
The Trojans got off to a quick
start in Los Angeles and never let
up. Minutes into the third quarter,
the Trojans scored to push the
score to 24-9. UCLA Coach Dick
Vermeil called that the turning
point.
"We just couldn't stop their
offense," Vermeil said.

Anthony Davis led the
unstoppable offense with 190
rushing yards which gave him
enough to surpass O.J. Simpson as
the all-time leading Pac-8 ground
gainer.
The win gave USC undisputed
first place in the Pac-8, with their
tie against Cal being the only
mark on an otherwise perfect
league season. The Bruins dropped
into a tie for third in the standings
with Cal, giving Stanford a lone
hold on the second place notch.
The Northwestern Pac-8 teams
battled it out among themselves
for the remaining four places in
the standings. Oregon State
secured a tie for fifth place with
Washington by coming from
behind to beat hapless Oregon,
33-16. Oregon has lost its last
eight games, and stands by itself
in the league with an 0-7 record.
Washington downed
Washington State by a 24-7 score
behind Husky quarterback Dennis
Fitzpatrick's 250 rushing yards.
The Cougars were never in the
game and lost the Apple Cup
symbol of the state's best football
squad to Washington for the
first time in three years.

Hours before Mike Langford
had booted Stanford's winning
points over Berkeley on Saturday,
Ohio State had finished throwing
the Big 10 Rose Bowl race into its
second straight year of confusion.
The Buckeyes beat the Michigan
Wolverines, 12-10, to capture a tie
for the league title. The victory
left both teams with identical
league and non-league records for
the third straight year.
It wasn't until a day later that
Buckeye fans knew for sure that
Ohio State would be the Big 10's
Rose Bowl representative. The
decision to send the Buckeyes was
reached yesterday after a secret
ballot of the conference athletic
directors.
The Big 10 commissioner
refused to comment on the details
of the voting, but it is certain that
Ohio State received more than
half of the votes.
Ohio State set up the crucial
vote by beating the Wolverines
without ever crossing the goal
line. Place kicker Tom Klaban
punched through all 12 of the
Buckeye's points.

Michigan had a chance to take
the game and the league
championship with only 18
seconds left on a 33-yard field
goal. The situation was exactly
the same last year in the Big 10
decider between the two schools,
and again, like last year,
Michigan's kicking specialist, Mike
Lantry, missed the shot.
The Wolverines have a 30-2-1
record over the past three seasons,
but have been unable to attend
any bowl games due to the
current Rose Bowl pact.
The Pac-8 had a much easier
time determining its
representative. Southern
California made it clear who the
best team in the league is by
trouncing crosstown rival UCLA
in the same fashion as it
steamrolled Stanford two weeks
ago.
The Trojans got off to a quick
start in Los Angeles and never let
up. Minutes into the third quarter,
the Trojans scored to push the
score to 24-9. UCLA Coach Dick
Vermeil called that the turning
point.
"We just couldn't stop their
offense," Vermeil said.

Anthony Davis led the
unstoppable offense with 190
rushing yards which gave him
enough to surpass O.J. Simpson as
the all-time leading Pac-8 ground
gainer.
The win gave USC undisputed
first place in the Pac-8, with their
tie against Cal being the only
mark on an otherwise perfect
league season. The Bruins dropped
into a tie for third in the standings
with Cal, giving Stanford a lone
hold on the second place notch.
The Northwestern Pac-8 teams
battled it out among themselves
for the remaining four places in
the standings. Oregon State
secured a tie for fifth place with
Washington by coming from
behind to beat hapless Oregon,
33-16. Oregon has lost its last
eight games, and stands by itself
in the league with an 0-7 record.
Washington downed
Washington State by a 24-7 score
behind Husky quarterback Dennis
Fitzpatrick's 250 rushing yards.
The Cougars were never in the
game and lost the Apple Cup
symbol of the state's best football
squad to Washington for the
first time in three years.
