# Hockey Team Ties Humboldt
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
In a match that was in many ways a mirror of the entire season,
Stanford closed out its 1974 field hockey campaign Saturday with a
3-3 tie against Cal State-Humboldt.
After starting quickly, the Cards collapsed for most of the first half
before scrambling back in the final period. The familiar scenario
resulted in a 3-3 tie and a 5-2-1 season record.
! The Cards started the game on the attack, but after only a few
minutes the defense lapsed into one of the inexplicable slumps that
plagued Stanford during the middle of the season. Humboldt scored
twice in two minutes and threatened to add to its lead.

The Stanford offense refused
to give up, however, and midway
through the period cut the
I Humboldt lead to 2-1. The goal
came on a perfect play by Kathy
Levinson and Ann Walker.
Levinson charged the left side of
the Humboldt goal and passed off
to Walker at the last moment for
an easy score.
Humboldt cut the rally short,
* however, moving to a seemingly -
insurmountable 3-1 lead just
before intermission.
As they had in the game after
their loss to Humboldt earlier this
season, the Cards remembered
they could play good hockey in
* the second half.
The Stanford defense stiffened
and shut out the visitors, as Dee
Gates did an especially good job
stopping opposing attackers.
The Cards were especially
i impressive on offense. Stanford
lacked the powerful punch of the
Humboldt attack, but the ball still
spent most of the second half near
the visitors' goal.
Onnie Killefer cut the
Humboldt lead to 3-2 midway
||through the period. Her second
goal, a shot between the goalie's
legs, tied the game with five
minutes left to play.
