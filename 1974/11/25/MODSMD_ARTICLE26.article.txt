# Poloists Drop Two Of Three

### BOB KUSTEL CHRIS BAKER 
"Overall, it's been a
tremendous season," said water
polo coach Art Lambert, "and
we've built a solid foundation for
next year."
That's about all that can be
said following a disappointing
showing at the NCAA
Championship Tournament in
Long Beach this weekend, where
the Cards dropped two out of
three games.
On Friday afternoon the
poloists fell to UCLA 9-5,
although Lambert noted that "the
game was actually closer than the
score indicated. We really played
well except for three critical
situations," in which the Cards
blew a series of fast-break
opportunities.
Freshman Rick Johannsen
starred in the losing cause, tallying
three times, while sophomore
Drew McDonald, who, according
to Lambert, "really played
consistently" in the final weeks of
the season, added two goals.
The Cardinals did a "good job
of rebounding" in the next game,
bombing a strong UC-Santa
Barbara team, 9-1. Johannsen and
McDonald again led the assault
with three and two goals apiece.
"We played as well as we're
capable of playing," said Lambert,

singling out Johannsen, McDonald
and sophomore goalie Chris Dorst
for outstanding play in the victory
over a team which had dumped
the Cards 8-5 earlier in the year.
On Saturday, Lambert's troops
fell to underdog UC-Davis 4-3, in
a game in which the Cards "did

everything wrong," according to
Lambert. "We couldn't pass, we
couldn't shoot, we couldn't think
and we couldn't swim," he
lamented. "I guess we thought the
season was over after beating
Santa Barbara."
Stanford had already beaten
Davis once this year, and Lambert
felt that the Cards were "a far
better team."
The Cardinals were without the
services of senior Dean Anderson,
who was suspended from the team
for what Lambert termed a
"discipline problem."
California won the NCAA
tournament with a
come-from-behind 7-6 win over
UC-Irvine in the finals. It was the
Bears' second straight title.
It looked like Irvine was about
to shatter the Polo Bears, leading
6-5 with four minutes remaining
in the contest.
Cal coach Pete Cutino
emphasized the importance of
depth during the season. He never
named a starting unit. "We have a
starting team of 14-15 players,"
Cutino told the Daily Californian.
