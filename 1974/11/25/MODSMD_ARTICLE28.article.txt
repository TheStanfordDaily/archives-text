# Wrestlers Lose Opener To Cal

### MARK FUNK 
In a reversal of "Big Game" fortune, it was
California who came from behind to register a
dramatic last-second win as the Cal wrestling squad
defeated Stanford 21-17 Saturday in Berkeley.
Leading 17-15 going into the final match,
Stanford heavyweight Doug Stamm "just ran out of
gas," according to coach Joe DeMeo, and was
pinned in the final minute of the third round to
give the Bears the win. Stamm was ahead on points
at the time of the fall.
"We were upset," DeMeo said. "We should have
won the contest but didn't. Stamm wrestled very
well so the blame does not rest with him. Horpel's
match was the pivotal one."
DeMeo was referring to his All-America
candidate, Chris Horpel, back on the mats after an
operation sidelined him last season. Wrestling at
158, Horpel was bested 5-3 in a match DeMeo
characterized as the turning point in the meet.
"The team was let down after the loss," he
explained. "We expected him to win and when he
didn't it hurt us."
A trio of Stanford wrestlers shone in the defeat,

first dual meet for either club this season. Lester
Yoshida, competing for the first time at 126,
picked up the Cards only pin when he beat Frank
Cuthbert in the third round. Cuthbert is listed third
in the state's collegiate rankings.
Bob Keating upset another ranked California
grappler when he defeated Juan Pichardo 7-5.
John Govea, another Card wrestler off the
injured list this season, won what appeared to be
the match clincher when he upended Paul Fritz 9-4
at 190 pounds to give Stanford its 17-15 lead. "At
that point," DeMeo said wistfully, "even the Cal
people thought they had lost."
But then the heavyweights took to the mats.
Tuesday, Stanford opens its home schedule with
a double-dual meet against Chico State and
Sacramento State at Encina Gym. Matches start at
7 p.m.
"Chico State has one of the best small college
wrestling programs around," DeMeo said,
announcing that free popcorn will be given to
spectators to celebrate the home opener.
DeMeo added that approximately 18 Stanford
wrestlers would participate in matches that night.
