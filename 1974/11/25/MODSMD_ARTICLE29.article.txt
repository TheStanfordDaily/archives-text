Ford Returns From Russia
WASHINGTON President Ford arrived home
from his week-long Asian journey last night,
declaring to an airport audience that he had
established with the Soviet Union "a sound basis for
a new agreement that will constrain our military
competition over the next decade.
"Ceilings on the strategic forces of both nations
have been accepted," he said. "A good agreement
that will serve the interests of the United States and
the Soviet Union is within our grasp."
Ford said the talks with the Russians in
Vladivostok represented "the beginning of what I
hope will be a productive personal relationship"
with Soviet Communist leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
Ford said he and Brezhnev did not always agree
in their discussions on the Middle East, European
security and mutual relations.
"We often agreed, but not always. When we did
not, we stated our differences quite frankly," he
said.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen
predicted that the summit would produce a SALT
agreement that almost certainly will be signed next
year.
He said the meetings produced "one of the most
significant agreements since World War II."
Former President Richard M. Nixon "could not

achieve this in five years" and Ford "achieved it in
three months," Nessen said.
Rocky's Wife To Undergo Surgery
NEW YORK Happy Rockefeller, whose
cancerous left breast was removed only five weeks
ago, entered Memorial Hospital yesterday and will
undergo surgery today to have her right breast
removed.
Vice President-designate Nelson A. Rockefeller
made the announcement at a news conference
shortly after his wife was admitted.
The former New York governor said he had
known about the cancerous condition of her right
breast since shortly after the first operation Oct. 17.
But he said he kept it from her until a week ago
so she would not worry and so other alternatives
could be studied.
Doctors said after the first operation that her
chances of long-term survival were 90 percent, but
the question of what they will be after today's
operation was not raised.
Later, a hospital spokesman said there would be
no medical comment on the case from Mrs.
Rockefeller's doctors until after the surgery is
performed. The operation is scheduled for 4:30 a.m.
PST today.
Guerrillas May Blow Up Plane
TUNIS, Tunisia Four Palestinian guerrillas
holding three crewmen hostage aboard a hijacked
British airliner threatened yesterday to blow the
plane up after the Arab world apparently refused
them sanctuary.
The gunmen were joined by seven colleagues who
had been released from confinement in Cairo and
the Netherlands and brought here in exchange for
the freedom of 40 passengers and crew members
aboard the plane that was hijacked Thursday.
Abdelkim Moussa, the Tunisian director of
information, said the guerrillas have asked they be
allowed to disembark in Tunis with guarantees
against prosecution and that they not be turned
over to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
The PLO, a guerrilla umbrella group headed by
Yasir Arafat, has denounced the hijacking. So has
the rest of the Arab world, including the militant
countries of Iraq and Libya which observers had
thought might provide a haven for the gunmen.
Ethiopian Regime Executes 60
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia Ethiopia's new
military government announced yesterday the
execution of 60 former aristocrats and officials,
including a grandson of deposed Emperor Haile
Selassie, two former premiers and the head of the
ruling military council.
A Radio Ethiopia broadcast said the executions
were "an act of justice." Most of those killed were
among the 200 noblemen, military leaders and
government officials arrested during the
seven-month anti-corruption drive by reformist
military officers that culminated with the

deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie on Sept. 12.
Lt. Gen. Aman Michael Andom, the chairman of
the 120-man military council until a week ago and a
moderate who had sought peaceful solutions to
problems facing this backward nation, was reported
killed. Two members of the council were also dead.
Aman's death apparently established Maj.
Mengistu Haile Miriam, a little-known 36-year-old
officer who heads an inner cabinet within the
military council, as the new Ethiopian strongman.
Radio Ethiopia said the two former premiers
killed were Aklilu Hapte Wold and Endedkachew
Makonnen.
No mention yas made of 83-year-old Haile
Selassie, who has been tinder arrest since he was
deposed. But his grandson, Rear Adm. Alexander
Desta, and at least two close relatives Adm.
Eskinder Desta, one-time navy commander, and
Prince Asrate Kassa, head of the disbanded crown
council were reported executed.
New Coal Agreement Proposed
WASHINGTON Negotiators for the nation's
coal industry and mine workers announced a new
proposed agreement last night to end the
nationwide walkout.
Details of the proposed settlement were not
released, but it is expected to contain industry
concessions to demands made by the United Mine
Workers 38-member bargaining council.
The council must approve any proposed
agreement before it can be submitted to the union's
120,000 striking miners, who on Nov. 12 struck
coal mines which produce 70 percent of the nation's
coal.
In a joint statement, UMW President Arnold
Miller and chief industry negotiator Guy Farmer
said both sides "have tonight agreed in principle on
improvements in the tentative contract package.
"We intend to devote [today] to the task of
finalizing contract language so that a complete and
final document can be presented for the ratification
process without delay."

Rocky's Wife To Undergo Surgery
NEW YORK Happy Rockefeller, whose
cancerous left breast was removed only five weeks
ago, entered Memorial Hospital yesterday and will
undergo surgery today to have her right breast
removed.
Vice President-designate Nelson A. Rockefeller
made the announcement at a news conference
shortly after his wife was admitted.
The former New York governor said he had
known about the cancerous condition of her right
breast since shortly after the first operation Oct. 17.
But he said he kept it from her until a week ago
so she would not worry and so other alternatives
could be studied.
Doctors said after the first operation that her
chances of long-term survival were 90 percent, but
the question of what they will be after today's
operation was not raised.
Later, a hospital spokesman said there would be
no medical comment on the case from Mrs.
Rockefeller's doctors until after the surgery is
performed. The operation is scheduled for 4:30 a.m.
PST today.
Guerrillas May Blow Up Plane
TUNIS, Tunisia Four Palestinian guerrillas
holding three crewmen hostage aboard a hijacked
British airliner threatened yesterday to blow the
plane up after the Arab world apparently refused
them sanctuary.
The gunmen were joined by seven colleagues who
had been released from confinement in Cairo and
the Netherlands and brought here in exchange for
the freedom of 40 passengers and crew members
aboard the plane that was hijacked Thursday.
Abdelkim Moussa, the Tunisian director of
information, said the guerrillas have asked they be
allowed to disembark in Tunis with guarantees
against prosecution and that they not be turned
over to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
The PLO, a guerrilla umbrella group headed by
Yasir Arafat, has denounced the hijacking. So has
the rest of the Arab world, including the militant
countries of Iraq and Libya which observers had
thought might provide a haven for the gunmen.
Ethiopian Regime Executes 60
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia Ethiopia's new
military government announced yesterday the
execution of 60 former aristocrats and officials,
including a grandson of deposed Emperor Haile
Selassie, two former premiers and the head of the
ruling military council.
A Radio Ethiopia broadcast said the executions
were "an act of justice." Most of those killed were
among the 200 noblemen, military leaders and
government officials arrested during the
seven-month anti-corruption drive by reformist
military officers that culminated with the

deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie on Sept. 12.
Lt. Gen. Aman Michael Andom, the chairman of
the 120-man military council until a week ago and a
moderate who had sought peaceful solutions to
problems facing this backward nation, was reported
killed. Two members of the council were also dead.
Aman's death apparently established Maj.
Mengistu Haile Miriam, a little-known 36-year-old
officer who heads an inner cabinet within the
military council, as the new Ethiopian strongman.
Radio Ethiopia said the two former premiers
killed were Aklilu Hapte Wold and Endedkachew
Makonnen.
No mention yas made of 83-year-old Haile
Selassie, who has been tinder arrest since he was
deposed. But his grandson, Rear Adm. Alexander
Desta, and at least two close relatives Adm.
Eskinder Desta, one-time navy commander, and
Prince Asrate Kassa, head of the disbanded crown
council were reported executed.
New Coal Agreement Proposed
WASHINGTON Negotiators for the nation's
coal industry and mine workers announced a new
proposed agreement last night to end the
nationwide walkout.
Details of the proposed settlement were not
released, but it is expected to contain industry
concessions to demands made by the United Mine
Workers 38-member bargaining council.
The council must approve any proposed
agreement before it can be submitted to the union's
120,000 striking miners, who on Nov. 12 struck
coal mines which produce 70 percent of the nation's
coal.
In a joint statement, UMW President Arnold
Miller and chief industry negotiator Guy Farmer
said both sides "have tonight agreed in principle on
improvements in the tentative contract package.
"We intend to devote [today] to the task of
finalizing contract language so that a complete and
final document can be presented for the ratification
process without delay."

Guerrillas May Blow Up Plane
TUNIS, Tunisia Four Palestinian guerrillas
holding three crewmen hostage aboard a hijacked
British airliner threatened yesterday to blow the
plane up after the Arab world apparently refused
them sanctuary.
The gunmen were joined by seven colleagues who
had been released from confinement in Cairo and
the Netherlands and brought here in exchange for
the freedom of 40 passengers and crew members
aboard the plane that was hijacked Thursday.
Abdelkim Moussa, the Tunisian director of
information, said the guerrillas have asked they be
allowed to disembark in Tunis with guarantees
against prosecution and that they not be turned
over to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
The PLO, a guerrilla umbrella group headed by
Yasir Arafat, has denounced the hijacking. So has
the rest of the Arab world, including the militant
countries of Iraq and Libya which observers had
thought might provide a haven for the gunmen.
Ethiopian Regime Executes 60
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia Ethiopia's new
military government announced yesterday the
execution of 60 former aristocrats and officials,
including a grandson of deposed Emperor Haile
Selassie, two former premiers and the head of the
ruling military council.
A Radio Ethiopia broadcast said the executions
were "an act of justice." Most of those killed were

government officials arrested during the
seven-month anti-corruption drive by reformist
military officers that culminated with the

deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie on Sept. 12.

the 120-man military council until a week ago and a
moderate who had sought peaceful solutions to
problems facing this backward nation, was reported
killed. Two members of the council were also dead.
Aman's death apparently established Maj.
Mengistu Haile Miriam, a little-known 36-year-old
officer who heads an inner cabinet within the
military council, as the new Ethiopian strongman.
Radio Ethiopia said the two former premiers
killed were Aklilu Hapte Wold and Endedkachew
Makonnen.
No mention yas made of 83-year-old Haile
Selassie, who has been tinder arrest since he was
deposed. But his grandson, Rear Adm. Alexander
Desta, and at least two close relatives Adm.
Eskinder Desta, one-time navy commander, and

New Coal Agreement Proposed
WASHINGTON Negotiators for the nation's
coal industry and mine workers announced a new
proposed agreement last night to end the
nationwide walkout.
Details of the proposed settlement were not
released, but it is expected to contain industry
concessions to demands made by the United Mine
Workers 38-member bargaining council.
The council must approve any proposed
agreement before it can be submitted to the union's
120,000 striking miners, who on Nov. 12 struck
coal mines which produce 70 percent of the nation's
coal.
In a joint statement, UMW President Arnold
Miller and chief industry negotiator Guy Farmer
said both sides "have tonight agreed in principle on
improvements in the tentative contract package.
"We intend to devote [today] to the task of
finalizing contract language so that a complete and
final document can be presented for the ratification
process without delay."

Ford Returns From Russia
WASHINGTON President Ford arrived home
from his week-long Asian journey last night,
declaring to an airport audience that he had
established with the Soviet Union "a sound basis for
a new agreement that will constrain our military
competition over the next decade.
"Ceilings on the strategic forces of both nations
have been accepted," he said. "A good agreement
that will serve the interests of the United States and
the Soviet Union is within our grasp."
Ford said the talks with the Russians in
Vladivostok represented "the beginning of what I
hope will be a productive personal relationship"
with Soviet Communist leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
Ford said he and Brezhnev did not always agree
in their discussions on the Middle East, European
security and mutual relations.
"We often agreed, but not always. When we did
not, we stated our differences quite frankly," he
said.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen
predicted that the summit would produce a SALT
agreement that almost certainly will be signed next
year.
He said the meetings produced "one of the most
significant agreements since World War II."
Former President Richard M. Nixon "could not

achieve this in five years" and Ford "achieved it in
three months," Nessen said.
