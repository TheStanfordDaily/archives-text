# Election Procedures Set Poor Precedent
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN News Analysis 
The manner in which last week's
ASSU election was ' conducted
provided an opportunity for abuse of
the election system.
After the first day of balloting,
major proponents of both the record
co-op and the Live Oak fee
assessments knew or could estimate
the general voting trend based on
information not available to the
general public.
With that knowledge, the
proponents could have organized a
last-minute drive to alter the trends.
As it turned out, both propositions
lost. If the knowledge was used
improperly, the last-minute drives only
changed the percentages of pro and
con votes, not the final outcome.
There is no firm evidence that the
knowledge was improperly used,
however.
But in a- closer, more important
election, advance knowledge of voting
trends could have a serious impact on
the final results and could call to
question the election's validity.
Premature Results Tallied
For the first time in recent
memory, not only the total number of
ballots, but also the actual yes-no
results, were tallied before voting had
concluded.
The vote results were to remain
"strictly confidential" after the count
Wednesday, according to ASSU
elections commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald. But the results didn't stay
secret.
The responsibility of overseeing
ASSU elections rests with the financial
manager's office.
However, Fitzgerald, the ASSU
financial manager's office and AÂ§SU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri had
formally opposed the two assessments.
Therefore, Fitzgerald invited ASSU
Vice President Leonard Mackey, an
organizer of the record co-op, to, sit in
during the vote count '.'to make sure
the counting was done fairly."
Live Oak editor Bill Weinstein,
Olivieri and ASSU Vice President
Quinn Mayer also observed part of the
Wednesday ballot count.
Fitzgerald said he made all the

observers promise not to release or to
use any of the count information
before the election was over.
Mackey, however, admitted that he
had discussed both "the extent and
the direction" of the vote with ASSU
Vice President Ann Carter, another
top co-op backer, Wednesday night.
Weinstein said Thursday he
"stopped in [Wednesday] to see how
the vote was going."
Weinstein added that he felt the
whole election had been conducted
unfairly and that the Wednesday tally,
to which he was not invited, was just a
small part of the unfairness.
Even Mackey conceded that the
vote results should not have been
tallied until the election was over: "It
was a bad thing just oh principle.
There's always a risk of a leak.
"But he [Fitzgerald] was going to
count the ballots Wednesday and I
demanded that I be there," Mackey
said. "I didn't doubt his honesty or
fairness. I just wanted to make sure in
my own mind."
Vote Count Defended
Fitzgerald defended the Wednesday
vote count, claiming it was necessary
for efficiency.
"It took 40 man-hours to count the
ballots in the last election. We wanted
to speed things up this time," he said.
The observers' inside knowledge
"could have affected the election, but
it didn't. I know that the co-op people
had already planned a big last-minute
get-out-the-vote push. What they knew
wasn't going to change anything," he
said.
But Fitzgerald also said he had
counted on the observers to keep their
oaths of secrecy. And at least one did
not.
All these problems might not have
surfaced if the ASSU by-laws had been
followed strictly.
According to the by-laws, the
elections commission must file a
detailed proposition of election
procedures with the ASSU President at
least five days in advance. The
President then has the power of veto
over the procedures.
Fitzgerald filed nothing with ASSU
President Mike Herman, so the
questionable procedures went
unchecked.
