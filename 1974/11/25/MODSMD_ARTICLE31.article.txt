# 'Chappie' Distributes 'Daily' Parody At Cal
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
The unofficial Chaparral made its
second appearance this year as a
parody of a Stanford Daily football
issue.
According to editor Mike
Dornheim, over 13,000 copies of the
eight-page publication were distributed
at the football game in Berkeley
Saturday.
Because the Daily, unable to sell
the necessary advertising, did not
publish a Big Game issue this year,
Dornheim said many people probably
assumed the Daily had printed a funny
issue.
The publication, deceptively similar
to a real Daily football issue, included
a story reporting that coach Jack
Christiansen lost the axe, lineups -
listing Steve Weed as playing SLA for
the California Bears and a mock
interview with the cheerleaders
supposedly written by Daily reporter
Glenn Garvin.
"I just wish they had misspelled my
name or something, so people
wouldn't think I actually wrote it,"
said Garvin. The issue also included a
story under Mike Cordova's byline
entitled "Football Physics," discussing
the sport in pseudo-scientific terms.
Cordova was a declared physics major
last year.
Mistaken Readers
"I'm afraid some unaware readers
thought it was a real Daily," said Tim
Ferguson, editor of the real Daily

football issues. "I'd be embarrassed
they got that impression." *
Funding for the publication was
loaned to Dornheim by the Student
Affairs Office. According to ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri,
Dornheim received up to $7OO to "get
his act together" and impress members
of the Hammer and Coffin Trusfc
Fund, who control $7OOO designated
for use by the Chaparral.
Dale Snape, assistant dean of
student affairs, emphasized that the
loan was made to Dornheim, rather
than to the Chaparral , since there is
still controversy as to the legitimacy q£
the publication. The loan is only for
one issue, and is to be paid back prior
to the release of subsequent issues.
'Not Ecstatic'
"Frank's not ecstatic about it," said
Snape, "but he's going along with it, since
it is the only way that the ChaparraL
debt to the ASSU from last year mighf
be paid."
"We actually made money on it
[the issue]," said Dornheim. He claims
that at least $lOO was cleared on
"pure advertising" from the Big Game
issue spoof.
According to Dornheim, th#
"provisional active members" of the
Hammer and Coffin Society, the
organization affiliated with the
Chaparral, met and voted 18-0 that
Dornheim and Jim Hu, his financial
manager, are the legitimate
representatives of the Chaparral. [ m

the necessary advertising, did not
publish a Big Game issue this year,
Dornheim said many people probably
assumed the Daily had printed a funny
issue.
The publication, deceptively similar
to a real Daily football issue, included
a story reporting that coach Jack
Christiansen lost the axe, lineups -
listing Steve Weed as playing SLA for
the California Bears and a mock
interview with the cheerleaders
supposedly written by Daily reporter
Glenn Garvin.
"I just wish they had misspelled my
name or something, so people
wouldn't think I actually wrote it,"
said Garvin. The issue also included a
story under Mike Cordova's byline
entitled "Football Physics," discussing
the sport in pseudo-scientific terms.
Cordova was a declared physics major
last year.
Mistaken Readers
"I'm afraid some unaware readers
thought it was a real Daily," said Tim
Ferguson, editor of the real Daily

football issues. "I'd be embarrassed
they got that impression." *
Funding for the publication was
loaned to Dornheim by the Student
Affairs Office. According to ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri,
Dornheim received up to $7OO to "get
his act together" and impress members
of the Hammer and Coffin Trusfc
Fund, who control $7OOO designated
for use by the Chaparral.
Dale Snape, assistant dean of
student affairs, emphasized that the
loan was made to Dornheim, rather
than to the Chaparral , since there is
still controversy as to the legitimacy q£
the publication. The loan is only for
one issue, and is to be paid back prior
to the release of subsequent issues.
'Not Ecstatic'
"Frank's not ecstatic about it," said
Snape, "but he's going along with it, since
it is the only way that the ChaparraL
debt to the ASSU from last year mighf
be paid."
"We actually made money on it
[the issue]," said Dornheim. He claims
that at least $lOO was cleared on
"pure advertising" from the Big Game
issue spoof.
According to Dornheim, th#
"provisional active members" of the
Hammer and Coffin Society, the
organization affiliated with the
Chaparral, met and voted 18-0 that
Dornheim and Jim Hu, his financial
manager, are the legitimate
representatives of the Chaparral. [ m
The unofficial Chaparral made its
second appearance this year as a
parody of a Stanford Daily football
issue.
According to editor Mike
Dornheim, over 13,000 copies of the
eight-page publication were distributed
at the football game in Berkeley
Saturday.
Because the Daily, unable to sell
the necessary advertising, did not
publish a Big Game issue this year,
Dornheim said many people probably
