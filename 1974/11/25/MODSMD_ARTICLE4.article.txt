# DES Linked To Cancer
## Drug Awareness Plan Begins 
### CHRISTY WISE 
A committee at Cowell Health Center has launched an
awareness campaign about a potentially harmful drug called
diethylstilbesterol (DES).
According to a report by Dr. Eugene Sandberg, associate
professor of gynecology and obstetrics, evidence
accumulated during the past three years indicates that
daughters of women who were administered DES during
pregnancy "have a significantly elevated potential for the
development of vaginal and/or cervical clear cell
adenocarcinoma" a rare form of vaginal cancer.
"The major emphasis is that this not be a scare type
thing," said Cowell physician Norman Fisk, one of three
committee members.
He and Cowell peer counselors Susie Phillips and
Suzanne Murphy plan to inform the entire Stanford
community about DES.
"We've known about DES of course for a long time,"
said Fisk. "There has been national publicity but of an
irresponsible nature alarmist and frightening."
Exposure
Since last December, women patients at Cowell have
been asked about possible exposure to DES. "There are
problems in asking women," said Phillips. "They don't
know and there's a real reluctance to ask their mothers.
Their mothers may not know. The doctor may have moved
away."
Fisk suggests that Christmas break provides a good
opportunity for women students to ask their mothers about
DES exposure.
Sandberg's report claims that no effect has been noted
on males similarly exposed. However Fisk suggests there is a
strong suspicion that DES exposure may cause urinary
abnormalities in -males, "but they would know about that
without examination," he added.
Original Use
Use of DES began in the early 1940s when it was found
to be an effective treatment for women who had previously
miscarried or threatened to abort during pregnancy,
according to a report by undergraduate Patrice Badstubner.
The drug was also given to many diabetic mothers,

according to Fisk. "That kind of treatment fell into disuse
around 1957," he added.
DES still is occasionally employed as the "morning
after" pill said Fisk. He said this use has not been banned
because "it doesn't appear DES has any effect on the
person taking it."
He added that if the post-coital contraceptive didn't
work the woman should consider a therapeutic abortion in
case of a female infant. Fisk emphasized that the "morning
after" pill is not encouraged as a form of birth control.
Rare Cancer
In Boston several years ago, a number of women
developed a rare form of vaginal cancer, according to Fisk.
The mothers of 70 percent of these women had been
administered DES, usually during the first five months of
pregnancy. "Thirty percent didn't have a history of DES so
there may be other factors involved," Fisk said. "But
there's a reasonable suspicion that there's a relationship."
According to Sandberg, "the incidence is probably
somewhere between one in 1000 and one in 10,000 that an
exposed patient will have a serious problem." He added
that of the 260 women examined by Stanford Hospital,
"half of them have some minimal change of their vagina or
cervix that is obvious on physical inspection but not
detrimental to health ... We have not found a malignancy
as yet."
Sandberg urges that the individuals be identified "so
they know of their exposure and so they are acquainted
with the fact that they are in a group of possible risk for
this cancer."
Examinations
After identification "it's relatively simple," said
Sandberg. The women are encouraged to have examinations
every six months and "to pay attention to their genital
health more than others might," said Sandberg.
Sandberg also explained that once a woman is aware of
her exposure she can inform other doctors who examine
her to look for the noted changes and not be misled into
thinking they are highly atypical or dangerous.
A year and a half ago Sandberg developed a Bay Area
registry to identify and follow up DES daughters.

there's a reasonable suspicion that there's a relationship."
According to Sandberg, "the incidence is probably
somewhere between one in 1000 and one in 10,000 that an
exposed patient will have a serious problem." He added
that of the 260 women examined by Stanford Hospital,
"half of them have some minimal change of their vagina or
cervix that is obvious on physical inspection but not
detrimental to health ... We have not found a malignancy
as yet."
Sandberg urges that the individuals be identified "so
they know of their exposure and so they are acquainted
with the fact that they are in a group of possible risk for
this cancer."
Examinations
After identification "it's relatively simple," said
Sandberg. The women are encouraged to have examinations
every six months and "to pay attention to their genital
health more than others might," said Sandberg.
Sandberg also explained that once a woman is aware of
her exposure she can inform other doctors who examine
her to look for the noted changes and not be misled into
thinking they are highly atypical or dangerous.
A year and a half ago Sandberg developed a Bay Area
registry to identify and follow up DES daughters.
A committee at Cowell Health Center has launched an
awareness campaign about a potentially harmful drug called
diethylstilbesterol (DES).
According to a report by Dr. Eugene Sandberg, associate
professor of gynecology and obstetrics, evidence
accumulated during the past three years indicates that
daughters of women who were administered DES during
pregnancy "have a significantly elevated potential for the
development of vaginal and/or cervical clear cell
adenocarcinoma" a rare form of vaginal cancer.
"The major emphasis is that this not be a scare type
thing," said Cowell physician Norman Fisk, one of three
committee members.
He and Cowell peer counselors Susie Phillips and
Suzanne Murphy plan to inform the entire Stanford
community about DES.
"We've known about DES of course for a long time,"
said Fisk. "There has been national publicity but of an
irresponsible nature alarmist and frightening."
Exposure
Since last December, women patients at Cowell have
been asked about possible exposure to DES. "There are
problems in asking women," said Phillips. "They don't
know and there's a real reluctance to ask their mothers.
Their mothers may not know. The doctor may have moved
away."
Fisk suggests that Christmas break provides a good
opportunity for women students to ask their mothers about
DES exposure.
Sandberg's report claims that no effect has been noted
on males similarly exposed. However Fisk suggests there is a
strong suspicion that DES exposure may cause urinary
abnormalities in -males, "but they would know about that
without examination," he added.
Original Use
Use of DES began in the early 1940s when it was found
to be an effective treatment for women who had previously
miscarried or threatened to abort during pregnancy,
according to a report by undergraduate Patrice Badstubner.
The drug was also given to many diabetic mothers,

according to Fisk. "That kind of treatment fell into disuse
around 1957," he added.
DES still is occasionally employed as the "morning
after" pill said Fisk. He said this use has not been banned
because "it doesn't appear DES has any effect on the
person taking it."
He added that if the post-coital contraceptive didn't
work the woman should consider a therapeutic abortion in
case of a female infant. Fisk emphasized that the "morning
after" pill is not encouraged as a form of birth control.
Rare Cancer
In Boston several years ago, a number of women
developed a rare form of vaginal cancer, according to Fisk.
The mothers of 70 percent of these women had been
administered DES, usually during the first five months of
pregnancy. "Thirty percent didn't have a history of DES so
there may be other factors involved," Fisk said. "But
there's a reasonable suspicion that there's a relationship."
According to Sandberg, "the incidence is probably
somewhere between one in 1000 and one in 10,000 that an
