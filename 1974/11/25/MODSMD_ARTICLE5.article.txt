# Fire Blazes In Lagunita Apartment
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
A fire ripped through the
apartment of west Lagunita Court
resident feilows Clayton and Priscilla
Bates Friday night, causing $12,000
worth of damage.
The cause of the blaze still is
undetermined, Asst. Fire Chief Harry
Lund stated yesterday. "It is under
investigation by the [Santa Clara
County] Fire Marshall," he added.
No one was in the apartment,
located behind the Lagunita Food
Service building, when the fire started,
according to Priscilla Bates.
She said the flames apparently
originated in the bedroom closet and
spread through a trap door into the
attic.
Bates estimated that the blaze
destroyed nearly $2OOO worth of
personal belongings, primarily clothes.
A mattress also smoldered in the
flames, she said.
Building Damage
According to Levi Richardson,
maintenance supervisor of University
housing, about $lO,OOO worth of
damage was done to the building. He
said the flames burnt part of the
ceiling, the closet and the floor;
however, he attributed most of the
damage to smoke.
Students, first spotting the
destructive gray smoke billowing out
of the apartment's windows, called the
Fire Department and set off the alarm
in Olivo-Magnolia.
It took the Fire Department a long
time to answer the call, Sylvia Dyson,
the student who set off the alarm said.
"It was at least 10 to 15 minutes
before I heard the sirens," she
remarked.
Some students tried to put out the
fire themselves. They unrolled the fire
hose from Olivo-Magnolia and lowered
it into the Bates' apartment through a
window, according to Tamara Morales,
an Olivo-Magnolia resident.
Malfunction
When the water was turned on the
hose didn't work, according to
Morales. "The hose was wet but the
water just dribbled out. There wasn't
any pressure," she said.
"Those hoses are supposed to be
checked," she shouted angrily to
bystanders watching the gray clouds
spewing out of the apartment
windows. Ironically, fire watchers on
the other side of Lake Lagunita's
banks waited for torchbearers to set a
planned blaze, the Bonfire, alight.
Lund explained yesterday that the
valve for the hose had been turned off.
"Unfortunately we found someone
had shut off the valve on the outside.
It was probably a gardener," he said.
Reparation
According to Richardson, it will
take 10 working days to repair the
apartment. Until then the Bates will
live in Escondido Village.
The University constructed the
Lagunita apartment this summer
specifically for the new resident
fellows. The Bates moved in early in
September.
"That's the distressing thing about
it," Bates sighed.

the other side of Lake Lagunita's
banks waited for torchbearers to set a
planned blaze, the Bonfire, alight.
Lund explained yesterday that the
valve for the hose had been turned off.
"Unfortunately we found someone
had shut off the valve on the outside.
It was probably a gardener," he said.
Reparation
According to Richardson, it will
take 10 working days to repair the
apartment. Until then the Bates will
live in Escondido Village.
The University constructed the
Lagunita apartment this summer
specifically for the new resident
fellows. The Bates moved in early in
September.
"That's the distressing thing about
it," Bates sighed.
A fire ripped through the
apartment of west Lagunita Court
resident feilows Clayton and Priscilla
Bates Friday night, causing $12,000
worth of damage.
The cause of the blaze still is
undetermined, Asst. Fire Chief Harry
Lund stated yesterday. "It is under
investigation by the [Santa Clara
County] Fire Marshall," he added.
No one was in the apartment,
located behind the Lagunita Food
Service building, when the fire started,
according to Priscilla Bates.
She said the flames apparently
originated in the bedroom closet and
spread through a trap door into the
attic.
Bates estimated that the blaze
destroyed nearly $2OOO worth of
personal belongings, primarily clothes.
A mattress also smoldered in the
flames, she said.
Building Damage
According to Levi Richardson,
maintenance supervisor of University
housing, about $lO,OOO worth of
damage was done to the building. He
said the flames burnt part of the
ceiling, the closet and the floor;
however, he attributed most of the
damage to smoke.
Students, first spotting the
destructive gray smoke billowing out
of the apartment's windows, called the
Fire Department and set off the alarm
in Olivo-Magnolia.
It took the Fire Department a long
time to answer the call, Sylvia Dyson,
the student who set off the alarm said.
"It was at least 10 to 15 minutes
before I heard the sirens," she
remarked.
Some students tried to put out the
fire themselves. They unrolled the fire
hose from Olivo-Magnolia and lowered
it into the Bates' apartment through a
window, according to Tamara Morales,
an Olivo-Magnolia resident.
Malfunction
When the water was turned on the
hose didn't work, according to
Morales. "The hose was wet but the
water just dribbled out. There wasn't
any pressure," she said.
"Those hoses are supposed to be
checked," she shouted angrily to
bystanders watching the gray clouds
spewing out of the apartment
windows. Ironically, fire watchers on
the other side of Lake Lagunita's
banks waited for torchbearers to set a
planned blaze, the Bonfire, alight.
