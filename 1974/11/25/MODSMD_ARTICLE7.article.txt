# Ford: Nixon's Heir
## 
### Jonathan Marshall 
So strong is America's
revulsion towards Watergate that
even liberal Democrats have
lavished praise on President Ford
for establishing a welcome image
of openness and integrity, despite
his strongly conservative politics.
Even after Ford's veto of the
Freedom of Information Bill and
pardon of Richard Nixon, New
York Times columnist James
Reston lauded the President as
"an honest, decent and refreshing
man." But America's hopes for an
honest administrate m under Ford
rest on a shaky foundation.
As a Michigan congressman,
Ford's record was considerably
less than clean In 1970 he failed
to report $11,500 from corporate
supporters, including oil men and
bankers, and concealed the
contributions by filing a false
sworn statement to the House of
Representatives.
In the 1972 race, Ford's
assistants raised secret funds
through a committee listed only
by its post office box in a rush to
avoid the provisions of a new
campaign law. "I don't know who
contributed to the Committee and
I think it's better that I don't
know," he later insisted.
Integrity Weakened
After only three months in the
White House, Ford is calling into
question the integrity of his new
administration even aside from
the massive conflict of interest
problems raised by his nomination
of Nelson Rockefeller. On Oct.
29, Ford announced with great
fanfare his selection of Andrew
Gibson to head the Federal
Energy Administration, following
the ouster of John Sawhill. Ford
knew that Gibson had been
president of Interstate Oil
Transport Co. (from which he was
still receiving $BB,OOO a year in
"severance pay"), and that as
head of the Federal Maritime
Administration Gibson had
arranged a subsidy to his old firm.
Only after the New York Times
exposed these embarrassing details
did Ford otherwise
unconcerned with the obvious
conflict-of-interest reluctantly
move to ease Gibson out.
Like Nixon, Ford is building a
political power base around
cormpt but powerful interests. On
Aug 16, only a week after he
took office. Ford met with Frank
Fitzsimmons to receive the
Teamsters Union president's
expression of support.
Fitzsimmons donated large sums
from his union's coffers to
support Rabbi Baruch Korff's
National Committee For Fairness
to the President, and signed his
name to full page ads opposing all
moves to oust Nixon from office.
Ford's record on Watergate,
however, shows him to be more
concerned with covering up for
friends than with ending
corruption in government.
Ford In Cover-Up, Too
From a recently released White
House tape and last year's
testimony by John Dean, we now
know that Ford was an active

participant in the Watergate
cover-up as early as 1972.
Watergate prosecutors a few
I weeks ago played a tape in which
Nixon suggested using then House
Minority Leader Ford to suppress
an incipient investigation by the
House Banking and Currency
Committee, in 1972, into
Watergate cover-up activities of
the Nixon Administration.
Dean testified that the White
House went ahead with this
(successful) cover-up effort, and
Ford has acknowledged his key
role in aborting the investigate,
, which he termed at the time a
"fishing expedition." The tape
i disproves Ford's contention that
the White House did not prompt
on this matter.
Nixon subsequently appointed
Ford vice president, confident
that he would continue as a good
"team player." Ford proceeded to
tour the country giving numerous
speeches in Nixon's defense in an
attempt to intimidate the
Watergate investigators. As
outspokenly partisan as the most
dedicated Nixon loyalist, Ford
called the House Judiciary
Committee proceedings "a
travesty" and "a deliberate
attempt to undermine the [1972]
election results.... Nixon is
innocent, period," he insisted.
President Ford apparently still
feels an obligation towards his
Watergate-tainted associated. He
pardoned Nixon under
questionable circumstances and
gave him control of vital tapes and
documents. He appointed Nixon's
chief aide, Gen. Haig (implicated
in illegal wiretapping, and
suspected in the cover-up) to the
post of commander-in-chief of
NATO despite Haig's retirement
from military duty and his relative
inexperience.
Brazen Action
Perhaps Ford's most brazen
action to date was his nomination
of former Nixon White House aide
Peter Flanigan to be ambassador
to Spain. Long known around
Washington as "Mr. Fix-it," and
denounced by Ralph Nader as
"the most evil man in
Washington," Flanigan quickly
acquired a richly deserved
reputation as the Nixon
Administration's chief
trouble-shooter for big business
thanks to his repeated attempts to
influence regulatory agency
proceedings. Flanigan helped to
arrnage ITT's favorable antitrust
settlement with the Justice
Department. Not surprisingly, the
Senate Foreign Relations
Committee refused to pass on his
nomination.
With friends like these, Ford
may well be tempted to continue
Nixon's policy of using the
federal government to promote
the special interests of big
business, big labor and perhaps
even organized crime. Certainly
his record to date does not allow
us to hope for anything different.
