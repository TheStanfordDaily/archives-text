Small enough to fit snugly
into harfd, purse, or attache
case, the petite SONY TC-45
is a true friend that sticks
with you all day long at
work, school, and play. An
ideal traveling companion, it's
full of the extra perform
ance, value, and dependabil
ity that's made SONY the
first name in tape recorders.
