# Cost Set At $1 Million
## Bookstore Plans Expansion 
### ROSARIO DE LA TORRE 
The Stanford Bookstore is planning -
a $1 million expansion using a
$570,000 expansion fund for that
purpose which has been accumulating
since 1960, according to Asst.
Bookstore Manager Phil Chiaramonte.
Bookstore Manager Eldon Speed
explained, "We have a need for more
space. Right now there is insufficient
space for books, texts and receiving
facilities."
Speed said the Bookstore alone will
have to pay for the expansion. He
estimates the cost for an expansion
will be from $1 million to $1.25
million. "Reserves will not totally
cover any sort of expansion. We will
incur a debt," he noted.
'No Price Increase'
But Speed said he does not feel the
proposed expansion will lead to an
increase in prices at the Bookstore.
"The debt incurred by expansion will
be paid off from the surpluses of sales
we will make," he said. "If the
increase in sales after expansion is
great enough, prices may even be
lowered."
A loss in profits during 1969 caused
the Bookstore to eliminate its five
percent discount to members of the
University community on the sale of
books and non-book merchandise,
Speed said.
He explained that profits increased
after the Bookstore removed the
discount and dropped prices on
non-book merchandise to make those
items more competitive.
The increased profits were added to
the fund to provide money for future
expansion of the Bookstore, he said.
Leases The Land
The Bookstore is not a part of the
University. It leases the land on which
it is built and therefore needs the
University's approval to expand, Speed
explained.
Currently, the Bookstore leases
8500 square feet of space off campus
for its Palo Alto accounting office and
warehouse. "The ideal plan would
bring the whole Bookstore together,"
he said.

The Bookstore's board of directors
authorized payment of $lO,OOO to
finance the cost of a feasibility study
by the Planning Office of possible
expansion alternatives.
Gene Kershner, project planner in
the Planning office, indicated that it
will be several weeks before that staff
can begin to study the Bookstore
proposal.
Cutbacks Cause Delay
"There are many factors to be
considered in the proposal. The
Planning Office is suffering from staff
cutbacks because of budget cuts, so it
will be a while before we can get
someone on the proposal," he said.
Kershner said it would take three to
four months for the Planning Office to
approve the alternatives. It would then
be five to seven months until the
architectural plans are finalized after
the Bookstore selects a definite plan.
"It could be two years before the
expansion is completed," Kershner
said.
One alternative is the construction
of a building where the Bookstore's
loading dock is now located. The

building would resemble the Post
Office, but would be smaller and
would be joined to the Bookstore on
the main floor.
Another Possibility
Another possibility is to build the
proposed addition on the side of the
Bookstore now facing its parking lot.
This building would resemble the
Bookstore, but would be smaller.
The expanded facility would
maintain the current ratio of
merchandise 70 percent textbooks
and 30 percent non-textbooks,
according to Speed.
Chiaramonte explained, "The sale
of non-book merchandise, such as gifts
and shirts, provides profits to offset
the losses from textbooks. A
bookstore sellipg only books will lose
money."
Speed said that sales have been
increasing in the last three years.
"Sales reached their peak last year
with a 20 percent increase over 1972.
This year's sales are 10 to 11 percent
greater than last year."
