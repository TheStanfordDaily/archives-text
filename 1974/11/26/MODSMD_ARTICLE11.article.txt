# Live Oak' Distorts Daily' Position
## 
### Stephen Carter 
"Daily shows little accountability,"
declared an editorial in the latest issue of
Live Oak.
Although a good case can be made to
justify that claim, the unfortunately bitter
but predictable Live Oak editorial failed to
do so. Rather, it relied on a mishmash of
misleading or inaccurate information, in
apparent furtherance of a policy, enunciated
by Live Oak editor Bill Weinstein.
"If the Daily comes out against [the
proposed Live Oak fee assessment], it will be
open warfare," he said.
"The Daily's editorial policy on the recent
fee assessments is indicative of this problem,"
the Live Oak editorial declared. It went on to
contend the Daily staff lambasted the Live
Oak for being "parasitic."
The juxtaposition of the two sentences
would, as the Live Oak staff must be aware,
give the uninitiated the impression that the
Daily editorial called Live Oak "parasitic."
After all, in the Live Oak editorial, this claim
was followed by the word "and," followed
by a claim the editorial did, indeed, make.
But it was a column by Daily editorial
board member Tim Ferguson which referred
to Live Oak's fee assessment proposal as
"parasitic." The Live Oak staff must realize
that columns reflect only the opinions of the
author. And had they bothered to check,
they would have discovered that Ferguson
regards all fee assessments, even for the
Daily, as parasitic. He said as much in his

column.
The editorial attacks the Daily for
implying that Live Oak has "been less than
candid with the students for not providing a
full, detailed account" of expenses and
income, contending that Live Oak's finances
have been emblazoned across the Daily for
nearly a year.
Although setting up and knocking down a
straw man in this fashion is an amusing lesson
obfuscation, it only serves further to muddle
the issues.
The Daily editorial actually charged Live
Oak " has done little to explain just what the
money will be used for." The Live Oak
editorial did not answer this charge,
presumably because it is true.
The Daily further pointed out, correctly,
that Live Oak has not submitted "detailed
budgets and financial briefs." The fact that a
separate publication has included occasional
articles (several of which contradicted each
other, due to Ziegleresque mis-statements
from Live Oak staffers) about one paper's
finances does not excuse that last paper from
making an effort to inform its own readers of
its rationale and situation.
But the pages of Live Oak never contained
the slightest inkling that that paper was going
for a fee assessment. Nowhere in that paper
was any justification for the assessment ever
set forward. Apparently, Live Oak expected
students to do research in their files of old
Dailies (assuming, of course, students kept

them for more than the usual few hours) in
order to understand Live Oak's fee
assessment request.
The Live Oak editorial did not answer this
charge. The Daily urged Live Oak to come up
with "a more cohesive plan" for the money's
use. In this, the Daily was being charitable:
for Live Oak never presented any plan for
exactly what it would do with the rhoney,
although day-before-the-election letter (to
the Daily, of course) indicated a few rather
broad and obvious uses.
"The Daily's most detrimental article,
however, was written by Don Cox, who last
week advocated that the best way to express
disapproval in the assessment election was
simply by staying away from the polls."
A careful re-reading of Cox's analysis,
however, indicates he was criticizing the
ASSU for having a rule which encouraged
such non-participation. And again, no matter
what inferences are drawn from Cox's article,
it in no way represents "the Daily's editorial
policy."
Perhaps Live Oak would do well to take
its own advice, so generously offered in its
editorial:
"This kind of lackadaisical attitude only
serves to decrease student input, and thus
requires even less accountability of those
holding power."
