# Bigotry Is No Subject For Humor

### George Reina 
In writing his article, "Another
Loveable Bigot Show,"in the Nov.
19 Daily, George Dobbins must
have been referring to himself as
the "bigot," for he certainly
missed the point. Chico and the
Man represents some very
important issues which Dobbins
ignored in his effort to focus on
the cute lines.
Chico and the Man may be
following in the pattern of
San ford and Son and All in
the Family but it is a pattern
that has gone awry. The
combination of the two older
shows in Chico and the Man
presents a disturbing situation
when put in its proper context. . .
that of racism.
If Demond Wilson of Sanford
and Son had to labor under a
white boss who called him
"nigger" and "boy" then it might
not be considered so charming.
Neither television nor Dobbins
appear to have matured enough to
see that bigotry is bigotry no
matter where it occurs.
The dignity and respect
afforded blacks in television,
evidently has not been extended
to chicanos. Moreover, the current
black shows draw much of their
strength from the discussion of
blacks dealing with themselves,
rather than having to suffer under
white bosses. Blacks play all of
the significant roles in these
shows. The positive identification
that black children can draw from
this is obvious.
This type of interaction has
been specifically put aside for
Chico and the Man. Thus,
whatever benefit could have been
accrued for chicano children, as
an identification, has been passed
up by the boy/man relationship of
the show. There are no other
alternative roles on television for
young chicanos to identify with.
We and our children have only
Chico.
Dobbins also makes the point
of seeing Chico and the Man as
the "funny side of bigotry," and
perhaps from his point of view it

is. But it is difficult to find the
funny side of bigotry when one
sees a bright, young, able-bodied
chicano whose only alternative is
to sell his services to an Anglo
bigot.
One has only to look at the
credits to see that the program
that Dobbins thinks is not "ghetto
messagey" in its script is indeed
"messagey" in its employment.
Ray Andrade is the only member
of the Chico and the Man staff
who is a chicano. The show's
employment practices perpetuate
a system that makes money off of
chicanos and their heritage, while
at the same time excluding them
from participation.
It's a sort of ghetto merchant

of the airwaves. Freddie Prinz
(Chico) is the most blatant
example of this sort of rip off. Of
the nine million chicanos in this
nation, there must not have been
a "qualified minority" to play the
part.
Once Amos 'n Andy moved
to television, Blacks were
"allowed" to play themselves;
before that there had been whites
playing the black voices. Now
blacks are afforded the dignity of
portraying themselves. But
chicanos are still barred from this
participation.
Dobbins' argument that the
program writers are "presenting
him (Chico) as more than an
ethnic stereotype" rings hollow

since neither Chico nor anyone
else on the show is a chicano. The
lesson of Charlie Chan, Amos 'n
Andy and Chico Rodriguez is still
to be learned.
I admit that both Prinz and
Albert can be cute (although to
chicanos the lines aren't always so
funny), and that the show has
undergone some cosmetic surgery
in recent weeks; but it still
maintains the boy/man format
and its still a ripoff. Chico may, or
may not, understand "the man,"
but Dobbins definitely does not
understand Chico. We can do
without his preaching.

the significant roles in these
shows. The positive identification
that black children can draw from
this is obvious.
This type of interaction has
been specifically put aside for
Chico and the Man. Thus,
whatever benefit could have been
accrued for chicano children, as
an identification, has been passed
up by the boy/man relationship of
the show. There are no other
alternative roles on television for
young chicanos to identify with.
We and our children have only
Chico.
Dobbins also makes the point
of seeing Chico and the Man as
the "funny side of bigotry," and
perhaps from his point of view it

is. But it is difficult to find the
funny side of bigotry when one
sees a bright, young, able-bodied
chicano whose only alternative is
to sell his services to an Anglo
bigot.
One has only to look at the
credits to see that the program
that Dobbins thinks is not "ghetto
messagey" in its script is indeed
"messagey" in its employment.
Ray Andrade is the only member
of the Chico and the Man staff
who is a chicano. The show's
employment practices perpetuate
a system that makes money off of
chicanos and their heritage, while
at the same time excluding them
from participation.
It's a sort of ghetto merchant

of the airwaves. Freddie Prinz
(Chico) is the most blatant
example of this sort of rip off. Of
the nine million chicanos in this
nation, there must not have been
a "qualified minority" to play the
part.
Once Amos 'n Andy moved
to television, Blacks were
"allowed" to play themselves;
before that there had been whites
playing the black voices. Now
blacks are afforded the dignity of
portraying themselves. But
chicanos are still barred from this
participation.
Dobbins' argument that the
program writers are "presenting
him (Chico) as more than an
ethnic stereotype" rings hollow

since neither Chico nor anyone
else on the show is a chicano. The
lesson of Charlie Chan, Amos 'n
Andy and Chico Rodriguez is still
to be learned.
I admit that both Prinz and
Albert can be cute (although to
chicanos the lines aren't always so
funny), and that the show has
undergone some cosmetic surgery
in recent weeks; but it still
maintains the boy/man format
and its still a ripoff. Chico may, or
may not, understand "the man,"
but Dobbins definitely does not
understand Chico. We can do
without his preaching.

In writing his article, "Another
Loveable Bigot Show,"in the Nov.
19 Daily, George Dobbins must
have been referring to himself as
the "bigot," for he certainly
missed the point. Chico and the
Man represents some very
important issues which Dobbins
ignored in his effort to focus on
the cute lines.
Chico and the Man may be
following in the pattern of
San ford and Son and All in
the Family but it is a pattern
that has gone awry. The
combination of the two older
shows in Chico and the Man
presents a disturbing situation
when put in its proper context. . .
that of racism.
If Demond Wilson of Sanford
and Son had to labor under a
white boss who called him
"nigger" and "boy" then it might
not be considered so charming.
Neither television nor Dobbins
appear to have matured enough to
see that bigotry is bigotry no
matter where it occurs.
The dignity and respect
afforded blacks in television,
evidently has not been extended
