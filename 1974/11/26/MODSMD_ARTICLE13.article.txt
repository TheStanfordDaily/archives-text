# Share Your Thanksgiving
## 
### Eddie Sosa 
At this time of year, many of us return home to
join in a Thanksgiving meal. After roasting huge
turkeys and preparing more than enough vegetables
and deserts, we sit down and gorge ourselves, never
taking into consideration the fact that we probably
only need about half of this food. We eat much
more than is necessary and throw away the large
amount that is left over. We claim to do all this in
order to give "thanks for our food and good
fortune."
We never stop to think for a moment of those
people who do not have food for such a monstrous
meal, the people who very often do not have a
nutritious meal at all. Those people, people like the
farmworkers, we block out of our minds. We forget
them and return to our tables and try to stuff
another piece of turkey into our mouths.
The farmworker does not have any luxuries like
a Thanksgiving meal. He is too poor to afford it.
When he sits down to eat on Nov. 28 his parents
and grandparents are not there; most of them are
dead. Due to horrible living conditions and years of
stoop labor, the farmworker is lucky to live 49
years. His children are uneducated because most of
them will never get eight years of schooling.
The farmer has no cozy fireplace or comfortable
dining room. If he is lucky his house will have
electricity but it is very unlikely that he would have
a toilet, sink bathtub or shower in his house.

How can we turn away from this? How can we
close our eyes to these misfortunes and injustices?
How can we go on wasting food and money which
are directly needed by the farmworker? More
importantly, what can we do to help?
On Sunday, Dec. 1, student groups and religious
groups from all over Santa Clara County will come
together and take part in a day of solidarity with
the farmworkers. At 1 p.m. at Guadalupe Church
in the east side of San Jose we will meet and sing
songs. We will then break up and participate in a
door to door campaign, going to each home in the
area asking people to support the boycott of
grapes, head lettuce, and Gallo wine. At 4 p.m. we
will regroup for an ecumenical service and share in
a modest meal. For some supporters this meal will
be the first in 24 hours, as some people will express
their dedication and complete devotion to the
farmworkers by fasting.
Rides will be given to Stanford students who
meet at Tresidder at noon on Sunday, Dec. 1.
Carpools will be arranged. Anyone who wishes to
participate and has a car should contact me.
So this Thanksgiving, instead of selfishly wasting
your own good fortune, make an effort to spread it
among poor and less fortunate people so that they
too can be thankful.

Carpools will be arranged. Anyone who wishes to
participate and has a car should contact me.
So this Thanksgiving, instead of selfishly wasting
your own good fortune, make an effort to spread it
among poor and less fortunate people so that they
too can be thankful.

At this time of year, many of us return home to
join in a Thanksgiving meal. After roasting huge
turkeys and preparing more than enough vegetables
and deserts, we sit down and gorge ourselves, never
taking into consideration the fact that we probably
only need about half of this food. We eat much
more than is necessary and throw away the large
amount that is left over. We claim to do all this in
order to give "thanks for our food and good
fortune."
We never stop to think for a moment of those
people who do not have food for such a monstrous
meal, the people who very often do not have a
nutritious meal at all. Those people, people like the
farmworkers, we block out of our minds. We forget
them and return to our tables and try to stuff
another piece of turkey into our mouths.
The farmworker does not have any luxuries like
a Thanksgiving meal. He is too poor to afford it.
When he sits down to eat on Nov. 28 his parents
and grandparents are not there; most of them are
dead. Due to horrible living conditions and years of
stoop labor, the farmworker is lucky to live 49
years. His children are uneducated because most of
them will never get eight years of schooling.
The farmer has no cozy fireplace or comfortable
dining room. If he is lucky his house will have
electricity but it is very unlikely that he would have
a toilet, sink bathtub or shower in his house.

How can we turn away from this? How can we
close our eyes to these misfortunes and injustices?
How can we go on wasting food and money which
are directly needed by the farmworker? More
importantly, what can we do to help?
On Sunday, Dec. 1, student groups and religious
groups from all over Santa Clara County will come
together and take part in a day of solidarity with
the farmworkers. At 1 p.m. at Guadalupe Church
in the east side of San Jose we will meet and sing
songs. We will then break up and participate in a
door to door campaign, going to each home in the
area asking people to support the boycott of
grapes, head lettuce, and Gallo wine. At 4 p.m. we
will regroup for an ecumenical service and share in
a modest meal. For some supporters this meal will
be the first in 24 hours, as some people will express
their dedication and complete devotion to the
farmworkers by fasting.
Rides will be given to Stanford students who
meet at Tresidder at noon on Sunday, Dec. 1.
Carpools will be arranged. Anyone who wishes to
participate and has a car should contact me.
So this Thanksgiving, instead of selfishly wasting
your own good fortune, make an effort to spread it
among poor and less fortunate people so that they
too can be thankful.
