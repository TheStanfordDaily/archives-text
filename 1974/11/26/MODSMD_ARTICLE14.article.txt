In "A Current Myth" (Daily,
Nove. 20), Merritt Ruhlen
presented two points regarding
Israel in an honest and reasonable
manner. Then, midway through,
he abandoned this practice to
write, .. practically every
country in the world ... thinks
the Palestinians have just as much
right to a homeland as the Jews.
Either we Americans must
consider ourselves the only moral
people in the world, and hence
withdraw further into paranoia, or
else we should begin to listen to
what the rest of the world is
saying." This is not argument.
If it were, he would have to
consider what a "right to a
homeland" means, and consider
what limits one in deciding what
his homeland should include. He
would also have to consider the
morality of majority rule, not just
assume it.
The present world, as
represented in the United Nations,
consists of envy-ridden nations
who resent Israel for the same;
reason they resent the United
States: Israel has been more
successful than they. And there is,
another reason. Although Ruhlen
makes the point that
anti-Semitism and anti-Israel
sentiment are not the same, it
cannot be denied that a major,
reason for today's opposition to
Israel is anti-Semitism,
particularly in Europe and Russia.;
Ruhlen is trying to bake his
in an oven he has already rightly*
destroyed.
Aside from this, the idea that
retaining one's position, and.
regarding it as moral in the face of
opposition, is paranoid, disgusts,
me. The majority has been wrong
much more often than it has been
right, and it is time rational!!

Larry Horton is a heckuva guy. •
Last Wednesday night he.
considerately warned the Florence
Moore staff that the proposed'*
construction of 100 additional
living units onto Florence Moore
Hall would create a considerable
disturbance. Apparently he
discovered later that he had beer*
wrong. He told the Daily, in aii
article printed Nov. 22, that the
construction "is expected to cause
little inconvenience, to Florence
Moore students."
Of course, Larry is right •
Who minds a little hammering?"
And no truck is really that loud.
Also, once the construction begins
winter quarter, Flo Mo residents
will actually start receiving all
sorts of fringe benefits.
For example, no one in Flo Mo*
will need an alarm clock. We can
all get up together at 7:30 when
the workers begin. What better ;
way is there to promote dorm
unity? f
In addition, Flo Mo students'
grades should improve markedly.
We realize that it's tempting to
tap one's toe to a jackhammer,
but we Figure most people will,
out of sheer responsibility, utilize
the library facilities. Life is not all
good times, after all.
And think of the time we Flo
Mo residents will save by avoiding
those wasteful afternoon naps.
One mustn't forget, either, the
abundant opportunities we will
have to strengthen our vocal
cords, and to prepare our
eardrums for upcoming high
decibel rock concerts.
Who can complain? And
considering the current housing
shortage, whether the Flo Mo plan
should go ahead is a moot point. I
merely wanted to emunerate
obvious benefits of the plan which
Horton, in all modesty, I'm sure,
neglected to mention in his
statement to the Stanford
community through the Daily last
Friday.

As two of the "usual idiots"
laboring for the Chaparral we
would like to extend our sincere
apologies to Tim Ferguson and
Glenn Garvin for any insinuations
of their involvement in the "Big
Game" Daily. We presumed that,
based on the consistently high
literary standards of the Saturday
Football Daily, readers would
naturally assume that Ferguson
and Garvin had no involvement in
this issue. Again, we apologize if
this was not the case.
