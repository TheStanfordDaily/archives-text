## Off-Campus Dwellers Seek A 'Home' On Campus Problems Plague Housing Draw 'Losers' 
### CECILE HEROLD 
If you don't have a car, you've
had it," said David Hughes, a
junior who is living off campus
this quarter. "And once you're on
campus, there's really no home to
go to between classes, unless you
consider the library your
'home.' "
Last spring, about 820
undergraduate students were
evicted from on-campus housing
by the University draw. More than
400 students still live off-campus,
either renting entire houses with
friends, sharing Apartments, or
leasing single rooms. Their new
addresses extend from Palo Alto
to Mountain View, and result in
an average commute distance of
five miles.
For many students, the
commute has effected a changed
life style. "It sure is different
from last year on campus when I
could fall out of bed and into my
first class," lamented Junior Alex
Donale, a former Lagunita-
Naranja resident.
Christine Douglas, a senior who
rents a room in Palo Alto,
outlined the inconveniences she
has encountered since moving
off-campus: "The University
assumes everyone evicted from
the housing system has money
because if you need to stay late
on campus, you must own a car.
Since I don't, I leave campus on
my bike before dark. For that
reason, dinner with the University
food service is out. And, because I
can't cook in my room, I
generally eat at /Encina Commons
about 4:45 not exactly a
pleasant routine." .
Biking With Books
Douglas also mentioned the
problem of bringing books to
campus. "I'm in the middle of
preparing a thesis and use 10 or
12 books each day for work
between classes," she explained.
All the lockers in the library are
completely full and I have no
place to store them. Then, in the
evening, the books must be carted

home again, since I continue
writing in my room."
Douglas noted another
inconvenience for the student
without a car: "Rain."
Comparing dormitory living to
off-campus life, junior Jack
Speilberg remarked, "It's really a
trade-off of advantages and
disadvantages. I like the privacy
and being able to study when I
want. In Wilbur last year, I spent
alot of time unintentionally just
talking to kids in the hall. On the
other hand, that social connection
is something you can miss.
Housing Trade-off
"There's alot of chance
involved with finding a good place
to live," Speilberg explained. "I
drew off with two friends. But it
was so hard to find a place big

enough and close enough to
campus to have all the little
things work out right that we
ended up living separately."
A number of off-campus
students, mostly upperclassmen or
second-year transfer students,
thought the advantages of
off-campus living far outweighed
the disadvantages.
"I like being out of the food
service," said Jim Hu, a senior.
Another senior, Mark Leiffer,
agreed, but complained, "because
you're away from the University,
no one of importance ever comes
to visit you."
Doug Sterne, now a resident
associate at Hurlburt House, spent
his junior year off-campus in Palo
Alto and says the experience "put
more reality into life. I found I

wasn't absorbed by school 24
hours a day. Instead, I was living
life and school was just a part of
life." Sterne said that, because he
saw less of friends on campus,
relationships among the people he
lived with were strengthened.
Some Like It
Bob Percival, a first year
student in the Economics Ph.D.
program, enjoys off-campus living
for a simple, unphilosophical
reason. "I like having a cat and
sitting in front of the tube," he
admitted happily.
If all off-campus students were
so content, the current housing
shortage would be of little
consequence to Stanford students
and the University. However,
Geophysics Prof. Alan Cox, a
member of the Committee on

Services to Students (COSS) said
the transition from dormitory to
apartment living does represent "a
tremendous letdown" for many
students he has consulted.
Cox is studying suggestions to
provide more University services
for off-campus students such as
"lockers, a lounge area, study
carrels, weekly spaghetti feeds at
Encina, or the establishment of
eating clubs, if there is a perceived
interest," he said.
Alice Supton, director of the
Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education
(SCIRE), says she is initiating
programs which could benefit the
off-campus transfer student in
particular, although "other
students could participate:"
Services For Exiles
Among the services Supton
mentioned were an on-campus
buddy sytem "the buddy giving
help and advice," organized car
pools, a neighborhood lease and
renting guide and a better
transfer student orientation
program.
Supplementing SCIRE services,
the Tresidder Program Board may
soon gear more activities toward
off-campus students, according to
Board Chairperson Marcie
Axelrad.
"We could hold informal
faculty-member dinners with
off-campus students similar to the
dinners held in dorms. Also, we'll
look into the possibility of
providing typewriters for students
supplying study-break
refreshments, if an off-campus
lounge space is reserved," Axelrad
said.

Cox emphasized that "at this
stage, we would like to hear from
the off-campus student to see
where his chief complaints lie and
what his needs are for increased
services." He added that COSS
and the Tresidder Program Board
will sponsor a meeting at noon
today in Tresidder's small lounge
"to invite input from all
off-campus students."

OUT OF LUCKâ€”Students evicted from on-campUs housing hopefully study the waiting list posted outside
the Housing Office in Old Union. But if they aren't among the 160 exiles who have received on-campus
spots for next quarter, they are out of luck. Perhaps fewer off-campus dwellers will be so eager to return
to dormitory living if programs planned to create an on-campus "home" for the exiles are successful.
