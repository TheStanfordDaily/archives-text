Are there any ladies' rooms on campus which have Tampax vending
machines? Why aren't they in more locations? K.K.
Only women's restrooms in the Main Library and Building 40 have
both Kotex and Tampax dispensers, according to Orvie Anderson,
manager of grounds and custodial services.
All the other public buildings only supply women with Kotex
because "that's what was asked for when they were originally
installed," Anderson said.
It would cost the University about $6O to replace the present
dispensers or to add new ones, Anderson added.
He mentioned that a women's bathroom in Hoover Tower's
basement, which Anderson does not consider a public building, has a
special Tanf£>ax machine instead of Kotex because someone requested
the change.

Why are there no crossword puzzles or cartoons Doonesbury,
Peanuts, etc. —in the Daily? —M.N.
The Daily has made "tremendous efforts" to acquire Doonesbury,
according to Daily editor Dave Robinson, to enliven the paper.
"We've written Gary Trudeau [Doonesbury cartoonist], the San
Francisco Chronicle and the syndicate, but the Chronicle claims it
has territorial rights in the BayArea,"Robinson lamented.
"When you buy features, you buy exclusivity," Chronicle Features
Editor Stanley Arnold said. If the Daily had run the feature before the
Chron, Arnold would have considered letting the Daily continue
running Doonesbury when the Chron later bought the rights.
Robinson added that the Daily no longer has room to print
crosswords. "They're not worth it if you don't run them every day,"
he explained. The crosswords received a lukewarm response in a Daily
readership survey last fall.

Could you please tell me how one goes about becoming a paid subject
for psychology experiments. —J.S.
Some subjects do get paid for the experiments but unless you're
taking Psych 1 this quarter, don't plan to buy your next meal with the
money you might make.
There are at least 500 Psych 1 students vying for those same
experiments just to fulfill a department rule which requires them to
participate in five experiments during the quarter.
Graduate psychology students, performing the experiments, pin
sign-up sheets on the bulletin board near Room 040-041 in the
basement of Jordan Hall.
Students may also fill out cards and place them in a file box on the
main floor of Jordan. Female subjects should enter their name on
orange cards, male on yellow cards. There must be some psychological
aversion to the more traditional pink and blue.
Subjects do not receive pay for every experiment. The pay option
is designated on the sign-up sheets. Most subjects are paid $1 per
experiment but if you're easily hypnotized you can make much more
money.
A secretary in the Psychology Department said fewer students are
expected to enroll in Psych 1 winter quarter and spring quarters so the
number of paying experiments will increase.

has territorial rights in the BayArea,"Robinson lamented.
"When you buy features, you buy exclusivity," Chronicle Features
Editor Stanley Arnold said. If the Daily had run the feature before the
Chron, Arnold would have considered letting the Daily continue
running Doonesbury when the Chron later bought the rights.
Robinson added that the Daily no longer has room to print
crosswords. "They're not worth it if you don't run them every day,"
he explained. The crosswords received a lukewarm response in a Daily
readership survey last fall.

Could you please tell me how one goes about becoming a paid subject
for psychology experiments. —J.S.
Some subjects do get paid for the experiments but unless you're
taking Psych 1 this quarter, don't plan to buy your next meal with the
money you might make.
There are at least 500 Psych 1 students vying for those same
experiments just to fulfill a department rule which requires them to
participate in five experiments during the quarter.
Graduate psychology students, performing the experiments, pin
sign-up sheets on the bulletin board near Room 040-041 in the
basement of Jordan Hall.
Students may also fill out cards and place them in a file box on the
main floor of Jordan. Female subjects should enter their name on
orange cards, male on yellow cards. There must be some psychological
aversion to the more traditional pink and blue.
Subjects do not receive pay for every experiment. The pay option
is designated on the sign-up sheets. Most subjects are paid $1 per
experiment but if you're easily hypnotized you can make much more
money.
A secretary in the Psychology Department said fewer students are
expected to enroll in Psych 1 winter quarter and spring quarters so the
number of paying experiments will increase.

Are there any ladies' rooms on campus which have Tampax vending
machines? Why aren't they in more locations? K.K.
Only women's restrooms in the Main Library and Building 40 have
both Kotex and Tampax dispensers, according to Orvie Anderson,
manager of grounds and custodial services.
All the other public buildings only supply women with Kotex
because "that's what was asked for when they were originally
installed," Anderson said.
It would cost the University about $6O to replace the present
dispensers or to add new ones, Anderson added.
He mentioned that a women's bathroom in Hoover Tower's
basement, which Anderson does not consider a public building, has a
special Tanf£>ax machine instead of Kotex because someone requested
the change.

Why are there no crossword puzzles or cartoons Doonesbury,

The Daily has made "tremendous efforts" to acquire Doonesbury,
according to Daily editor Dave Robinson, to enliven the paper.
"We've written Gary Trudeau [Doonesbury cartoonist], the San
Francisco Chronicle and the syndicate, but the Chronicle claims it
has territorial rights in the BayArea,"Robinson lamented.
