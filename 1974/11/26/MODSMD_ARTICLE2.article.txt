# Dial-A-Bus Switchboards Flooded With Inquiries
## 
### MARK FUNK 
Citizens seeking information on
Santa Clara County's new dial-a-bus
system flooded transit district
telephone lines with inquiries
yesterday. Some callers had to wait up
% to 45 minutes if they reached an
operator at all.
The system, which offers county
residents taxi-like service in fixed areas
between any two points within the
240-square-mile transit district, has
been in operation for two days.
' Frank Lara, the transit district's
marketing officer, acknowledged that
the calls have presented problems for
him and his staff. "All of our
telephone trunk lines all 70 of them
are busy," he said.
Many Calls
By 4 p.m. yesterday, 3727 calls had
gone through. Lara said that as many
as 1400 might have grown tired of the
delays and simply hung up.
Lara estimated that 90 percent of
the callers were asking for
$ information, and that those calls have
averaged six to eight minutes in length.
"Over the long haul, we estimated that
each trunk line could handle two calls

every three minutes," he commented.
"When people talk for six, we get
bottlenecks."
"We anticipate that as people
become familiar with the system, the
number of informational calls will
decline and the number of reservation
calls will increase as will our ability
to handle a larger volume of calls."
v
Below Capacity
At this time, Lara said buses are
operating below capacity because of
the telephone foul-up. However, he
said that he did not plan to add any
more trunk lines and predicted that
within two months the lines would be
operating smoothly.
Lara added that reaction to the new
service has been quite favorable. "'The
people using it have been absolutely
delighted," he said. He said that most
callers are picked up within 15
minutes of their call, "if it gets
through."
A radio and television campaign has
been hastily organized to help clear up
some of the confusion of the first two
days, Lara said. "We expect that some
of the questions people have will be
answered by those spots."
