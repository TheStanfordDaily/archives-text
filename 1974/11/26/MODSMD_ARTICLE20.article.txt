## The 						TV People 
### George Dobbins 
When we told you that Rhoda was the best new show of the
season, we forgot to mention the worst. So now let us redeem
ourselves. It is called The Manhunter and it is the type of show that
helps to earn television its reputation as a vast wasteland of stupid
ideas analogous to a doily for your mind.
The critics handbook tells us that nothing is ever all good or all
I baft. Therefore, to be fair, the good part of this show is its producer,
Quinn Martin. His genius has given us: The Untouchables, The FBI,
Twelve O'Clock High, The Invaders and The Fugitive. But the bad
news is that he had to give us this one.
The Manhunter is almost a carbon copy of Martin's last major
series, Banyon, with a little bit of The FBI thrown in. Like Banyon, it
takes place in the '3os, features fancy cars and glib dialogue. And
' perhaps the most unappealing aspect of this program is that it features
a character who is so flat, that, as the old joke goes, he could turn
sideways, stick out his tongue and be mistaken for a zipper.
His name is Dave Barrett, "a farmer who moonlights as a
cnmefighter," according to a CBS press release. Even a crime-fighter
moonlighting as a farmer would sound more interesting. In practice,
Barrett, an ex-marine, has this great desire to capture felons roaming
» the country-side.
Vigilante
- He even carries a shotgun, rifle and handgun hidden in secret panels
of his car. Indeed, he is your archtypal vigilante. And perhaps, even if
you're not a sociologist, there is a commentary in the fact that certain
people consider this man a hero in 1974. We consider him a dull and
unbelievable character.
(His Jack-Webbish preachings merely serve to substantiate that view.
Lines like "Animals don't know right from wrong. They (criminals)
do" and "Talkin's cheaper than shooting it's safer" make us wish
that we'd see more shooting. And indeed there's an excess of that.
You've probably noticed that we haven't mentioned Ken Howard,
the star of this disaster. That's because "we pity him and because we
have nothing to say about his acting ability other than he runs well,
wears jeans nicely and delivers his lines clearly. But as to how human
* or "Compassionate he can be, the scripts never allow anyone to
deTiheate.
Apocryphal Story
An apocryphal story says that in his late years Earle Stanley
Gardner fed names into a computer, which would actually select the
order of events and print out a Perry Mason novel. Martin seems to be
trying this same idea, dredging up plots and characters from his old
t shdws and merely changing the names. But he would best get his mind
engaged before he puts his computer in gear. The technique doesn't
seem to be working here.
episodes all have those venerable QM titles, i.e. "The
Doomsday Gang" and "The Man Who Thought He Was Dillinger." But
the scripts lack any notion of thought. Generally, we see a crime
committed. Barrett is called in and he catches the criminals. That's it!
i The stories really stretch our suspension of disbelief. In one, a
blind FBI agent asks Barrett to be his eyes. In another, a gang led by a
prbacher robs factory payrolls and then blows up the factories. Isn't
this a little hard to swallow sort of like Milk of Magnesia?
Martin has promised that The Manhunter scripts will concentrate
more on dramatic complexity and characterization as opposed to the
i Vaction-oriented material. But, so far, that change hasn't manifested
itself. If it does not, we can only paraphrase one of Barrett's lines and
say that this show should be cancelled, because even though animals
don't know right from wrong, Quinn Martin and his scriptwriters
shpuld.
