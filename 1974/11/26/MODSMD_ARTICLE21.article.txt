# 'Electra' Starts Week-Long Run
## 
### 
The Stanford Drama
Department will present Electra
by Hugo von Hofmannsthal in
The Nitery Studio Theater at 8
tonight through Saturday night
with additional performances at
11 p.m. Friday and at 2:30 p.m.
Saturday.
Electra is based on the classic
Greek myth of a sister and
brother's revenge upon their
mother and her lover for having
murdered their father.
Director Ellen Mease and her
cast are using group performance
techniques to explore and express
the dynamics . of these violent
human relationships. Their aim is
to express complex internal states
physically and vocally, using the
total resources of the body and
the voice in nonrealistic ways.
One of the ways in which the
varied facets of the psyche will be
demonstrated theatrically will be
through the fragmentation of
roles. For example, the actress
who plays Electra will be joined
by eight other actors, each
portraying a different aspect of

Electra's personality.
Three weeks of rehearsal have
been devoted exclusively to
evolving a style of movement and
sound which Mease says is "not
pretty" and which has been
suggested to the director and
actors by the animal imagery of
the script.
In contrast to the clean, classic
Greek versions of the myth, von
Hofmannsthal's treatment is
late-romantic, Germanic, dark,
gloomy and savage. Ropes, nets
irregular platforms and
freely-poured paints will be
employed to mirror pictorially the
psychic turmoil expressed in the
text.

Von Hofmannsthal wrote his
tortuous version of the Electra
story in 1903. It was later used as
the libretto for Richard Strauss'
opera "Elektra." Von
Hofmannsthal is best known for
his collaboration with Strauss on
such operatic masterpieces as
"Ariadne and Naxos," "Die Frau
ohne Schatten" and "Der
Rosenkavalier."
Tickets for the performances
are available through Tresidder
ticket office (415) 497-4317.
Remaining tickets for the
additional performances on
Friday and Saturday will be sold
at the door one hour before
curtain.

to express complex internal states
physically and vocally, using the
total resources of the body and
the voice in nonrealistic ways.
One of the ways in which the
varied facets of the psyche will be
demonstrated theatrically will be
through the fragmentation of
roles. For example, the actress
who plays Electra will be joined
by eight other actors, each
portraying a different aspect of

Electra's personality.
Three weeks of rehearsal have
been devoted exclusively to
evolving a style of movement and
sound which Mease says is "not
pretty" and which has been
suggested to the director and
actors by the animal imagery of
the script.
In contrast to the clean, classic
Greek versions of the myth, von
Hofmannsthal's treatment is
late-romantic, Germanic, dark,
gloomy and savage. Ropes, nets
irregular platforms and
freely-poured paints will be
employed to mirror pictorially the
psychic turmoil expressed in the
text.

Von Hofmannsthal wrote his
tortuous version of the Electra
story in 1903. It was later used as
the libretto for Richard Strauss'
opera "Elektra." Von
Hofmannsthal is best known for
his collaboration with Strauss on
such operatic masterpieces as
"Ariadne and Naxos," "Die Frau
ohne Schatten" and "Der
Rosenkavalier."
Tickets for the performances
are available through Tresidder
ticket office (415) 497-4317.
Remaining tickets for the
additional performances on
Friday and Saturday will be sold
at the door one hour before
curtain.

The Stanford Drama
Department will present Electra
by Hugo von Hofmannsthal in
The Nitery Studio Theater at 8
tonight through Saturday night
with additional performances at
11 p.m. Friday and at 2:30 p.m.
Saturday.
Electra is based on the classic
Greek myth of a sister and
brother's revenge upon their
mother and her lover for having
murdered their father.
Director Ellen Mease and her
cast are using group performance
techniques to explore and express
the dynamics . of these violent
human relationships. Their aim is
to express complex internal states
physically and vocally, using the
total resources of the body and
the voice in nonrealistic ways.
