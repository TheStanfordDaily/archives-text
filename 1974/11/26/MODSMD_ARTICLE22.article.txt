# Something's Afoot: Sparkling Comedy
## 
### DAVID MOYER 
SAN FRANCISCO - Picture
an English country manor
abundant wood paneling within,
the chirping of birds without. An
assortment of guests are gathered
for a holiday weekend, each one a
cliche: the typical gushing
ingenue, the distinguished doctor,
the playboy nephew, the
uppercrust dowager, the elderly
colonel (who of course fought in
"Injah"), the saucy maid, the
Cockney servant, the Agatha
Cristiesque scoop and it almost
goes without saying the politely
stiff butler.
Before long the butler is
merely one stiff among many. The
guests begin dropping like flies,
following the host's example, of
course. Meanwhile you guessed
it a storm has stranded the
weekenders from all contact with
the outside world, the telephone
lines have been cut, and the power
is off.
Add to this scenario a musical
score, outrageous lyrics and full
choreography and you have but a
notion of the whole-hearted
insanity of Something's Afoot,
now playing at the Marine's
Memorial theatre.
Authors James McDonald,
David Voss and Robert Gerlach
have collaborated to make a virtue
out of cliche. They offer a
delightful parody of the British
whodunit. The plot is a recreation
of countless late-late show movies
in the genre, but with novel twists
throughout. The deaths are
priceless. Each zany character
meets his or her bizarre demise,
only to be outdone by that of the
next, victims of poisoned-dart
spitting totem poles or
carnivorous Ming vases. The set,

which aids and abets the ultimate
perpetration of all this doom and
damnation, is truly an engineer's
dream with a multitude of
gimmicks which cannot be
divulged.
In the midst of all this mayhem
the characters somehow manage
to squeeze in song and dance,
from rumba to march and
baroque to torch song. One
wonders how the authors were
ever able to sing the songs, for all
the lyrics are tongue in cheek:
"Something's afoot/ And the
butler didn't do it."
The cast is full of good
character actors. Of particular
note are Gary Beach's greedy and
conniving young nephew, Nigel
Rancour, slithering around the
stage looking for his uncle's will;
Lily Sheridan's dowager fallen on
bad times, Lady Grace
Manely-Prowe, who maintains a
haughty air with ill-spoken
French; and Gary Gage's
monacled Colonel Gillweather,
who times his death on his watch
with a very British
matter-of-factness.
Something's Afoot is neither
great nor profound, nor does it
profess to be. It will not long be
remembered, except perhaps in
high school term play
reincarnations. It is without
substance. But for Agatha Christie
buffs it is a must. And for all it
promises an evening of fun and
frivolity, good for a handful of
guffaws and a multitude of
chuckles.
