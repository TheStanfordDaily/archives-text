Prosecution Rests In Cover-Up Trial
WASHINGTON The prosecution rested its case
yesterday in the Watergate cover-up trial and U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica immediately dismissed two of
the 12 courts in the indictment.
Sirica dismissed counts charging that former Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell and ex-White House aide John D.
Ehrlichman lied to FBI agents when they told the agenfs in
July 1972 that all they knew about the Watergate break-in
was what they had read in newspapers.
Sirica denied all other motions from the defendants for
directed verdicts of acquittal.
Mitchell, Ehrlichman, former White House staff chief
H.R. Haldeman, former Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert C.
Mardian and Kenneth W. Parkinson, one-time attorney for
Nixon's re-election committee, are charged with conspiring
to obstruct the investigation of the Watergate break-in.
All but Mardian are also charge! with obstruction of
justice.
Mitchell also is charged with two counts of lying to a
grand jury, Ehrlichman, with two counts of lying to a grand
jury and Haldeman with three counts of lying to the Senate
Watergate Committee.
Palestinian Hijackers Surrender
TUNIS, Tunisia Denied asylum by the Arab world,
four Palestinians ended their three-day siege of a British
jetliner yesterday and surrendered to Tunisian authorities.
West Germany said it may ask extradition of the hijackers
for the murder of a German hostage.
The four gunmen walked out with three crewmen, the
last of 48 hostages, and seven ransomed Arab guerrillas
after the Tunisian government announced it would grant
them asylum.
Immediately after their surrender Foreign Minister
Habib Chatti denied any binding agreement.
Chatti said the decision to offer asylum was taken to
avoid a carnage. The Palestinians, learning that they had
nowhere to go in the Arab world, wired hand grenades
together and threatened to blow up the plane with all
aboard unless they were granted asylum in Tunis.
Former U.N. Leader U Thant Dies
NEW YORK U Thant, a Buddhist schoolmaster from
Burma who served for a decade as the secretary-general of
the United Nations, died yesterday of cancer. He was 65.
Thant, who served two five-year terms as
secretary-general, retired Dec. 31, 1971, and had been
working on his memoirs in Harrison, N.Y.
During his reign he grappled with numerous world crises,
including wars in Indochina, the Congo and the Middle
East.
He also helped end the Soviet-American missile crisis in
1962 and pushed for the seating of Mainland China, which
was approved in 1971.

Court Physicians Visit Nixon
LONG BEACH, Calif. Three physicians, appointed by
a court to determine if former President Richard M. Nixon
is physically fit to testify at the Watergate cover-up trial,
spent two hours inside Nixon's walled, seaside estate in San
Clemente yesterday.
However, the doctors drove out the gates of the villa
without stopping to talk with reporters, and there was no
word on whether they had examined the former president
or determined whether he was able to testify at the trial of
five former aides.
The physicians plan to leave California today, and a
spokesman for them said they would hold an airport news
conference.
Unique Heart Transplant Performed
CAPE TOWN, South Africa Dr. Christian Barnard
implanted a second heart in the chest of a 58-year-old man
yesterday to ease the burden on the man's own diseased
heart.
The unidentified man was reported in satisfactory
condition with both hearts beating together. It was the first
implant of a new heart without removing the old heart.
Barnard said there still could be problems of the body
rejecting the new heart, as in past transplants, but that the
added heart gives "a little leeway."
Rockefeller's Wife In 'Good Condition'
NEW YORK Margaretta "Happy" Rockefeller was in
good condition yesterday after undergoing her second
operation for removal of a cancerous breast. Her surgeon
said her chances for long-term survival were 90 percent.
Dr. Jerome Urban removed her right breast to excise a
cancer the size of a pencil lead that he discovered during the
first mastectomy five weeks ago.
"I'm greatly relieved," Vice President-designate Nelson
A. Rockefeller told reporters last night after arriving at the
hospital to have dinner with his wife.
Car Sales Nosedive
DETROIT U.S. auto sales continued to nosedive in
mid-November as the nation's car makers posted their
second worst performance for the period of 14 years.
Company figures released yesterday showed a sharp 34.7
percent decline from Nov. 11-20,1973.
All four manufacturers already announced major plant
closings and worker layoffs last week in anticipation of the
latest sales drop in the year-long slump.

fog or low clouds. Increasing clouds tomorrow. Lows
tonight in upper 30s and 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in
