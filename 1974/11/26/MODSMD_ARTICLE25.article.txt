# Pub Board Recognizes Chappie's Dornheim, Hu
## 
### 
The ASSU Publications Board
officially recognized undergraduates
Mike Dornheim and Jim Hu as Pub
Board representatives for the
Chaparral.
By a 13-0 vote, the Pub Board
ended the longstanding Chappie
controversy and declared the
Chaparral officially publishing with
Dornheim as editor and Hu as financial
manager.
Graduate student Mason Blacher
had challenged Dornheim for control
of the publication earlier this month,
but withdrew as a contender, claiming
he was no longer interested.
Earlier this quarter, the Pub Board
ruled that the Chaparral had officially
"ceased to publish." ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri closed the
publication down this summer for
alleged financial mismanagement.
Yesterday's vote also gives
Dornheim and his staff access to the
Chaparral office space in the Storke
Student Publications Building.
The decision to reinstate the

Chaparral will not affect the Pub
Board's earlier decision to allow Live
Oak temporary use of one-half the
Chappie offices. Dornheim and Hu had
asked that the space be returned to
Chaparral control immediately.
Live Oak must leave the space in
June 1975, unless the Pub Board
extends Live Oak's space grant.
In other business, the Pub Board
received initial recommendations from
its committee on funding publications.
But because a procedural snafu led
to an unfavorable recommendation for
one publication and because two other
publications, Live Oak and the
Stanford Review, had failed to appear
before the subcommittee, the Board
referred the matter back to the
subcommittee.
After a lengthy and fractious
debate on the date for the next Pub
Board meeting, Pub Board Chairman
Rich Jaroslovsky recessed the meeting.
He said he will reconvene the Board at
the beginning of winter quarter.
