# I Lagunita Fire 'Accidental'
## 
### 
Friday night's fire which damaged
the apartment of Clayton and Priscilla
Bates, resident fellows of West
Lagunita Court, was "accidental,"
according to Santa Clara County Fire
Inspector Russ Kuebel.
"All evidence at this time leads to a
child playing with matches," Kuebel
said, noting that there was "no
evidence leading to deliberate criminal
intent."
Priscilla Bates said her daughter
could have set the fire, but added, "I
don't really think she's capable of
striking a match. She is only 3V2 years
old."
She said she considers Kuebel's
findings merely "a guess on his part."
Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian
challenged a remark in yesterday's
Daily in which Sylvia Dyson, the
student who set off the fire alarm in
Olivo-Magnolia, said, "It was at least
10 to 15 minutes before I heard the
sirens."
According to a recording in the
Telecommunications Building, it took
fire engines exactly four minutes and
nine seconds to arrive at the scene
after the alarm was set off, Jurian said.
