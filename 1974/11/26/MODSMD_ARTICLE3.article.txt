# IFC Divided On Housing Issue
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Members of the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) could not give united
support to any proposal at last night's
meeting, IFC President Mike Nilsson
said.
"There wasn't any decision that
could have been made," Nilsson
remarked.
At last week's meeting, the IFC
discussed a modified proposal by Pitch
Johnson which would have forced
fraternities and houses desiring
continuity to make a sacrifice in order
to maintain draw-exempt status.
Under the proposal, the houses
would have been forced to accept 33
percent more residents than are
presently in the house. The extra
students could either live off campus
or in crowded rooms in the house.

Nilsson expected the members to
talk to their individual houses about
the proposal and return last night to
either accept or reject it.
However, no one could agree
unanimously on what to do about the
proposal, Nilsson said.
Some fraternity representatives still
favored the modified Johnson
proposal while others supported
Nilsson's original proposal, which
extends to independent houses the
draw-exempt privilege which only
fraternities now claim.
Nilsson said some of the houses,
particularly Kappa Sigma and Delta
Kappa Epsilon, "did not think they
could fill their houses to the degree
the [Johnson] proposal asked for."
'University's Problem'
Other students supported one of
Nilsson's former stands that "this is a
University problem the University
should try to solve since it's a problem
the University created," Nilsson said.
They were willing to support
Nilsson's proposal even though it
increased the eviction rate for those
students remaining in the draw," he
maintained.
Johnson's proposal would
compensate for the increased eviction
rate by incorporating extra students
into the houses with draw-exempt
status.
"They were willing to take my
proposal or lose everything they
have," Nilsson added.
Nilsson feared that Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton will have
an advantage over fraternity members
because he does not have any verbal
dissenters among his ranks. "If we do
not stand behind one proposal, I think
the Housing Office can take advantage
of us," Nilsson lamented.
IFC Ballot
He said he plans to present a ballot
containing a number of popular
proposals to IFC members at the
Council's next meeting during Dead
Week.
The fraternity representatives will
then return to their houses with the
ballots to assess members' opinions
regarding the various proposals. After
the ballots are tallied, the IFC will
decide whether or not to commit itself
to one proposal.
Nilsson also remarked, "Larry

Horton is wrong in assuming that
temporary housing would be contrary
to what the students want." He stated
that rising prices in Palo Alto would
encourage students to accept any kind
of on-campus housing, even if
temporary.
Nilsson said the IFC plans to assess
student demand to determine the
validity of his assumption.

Nilsson expected the members to
talk to their individual houses about
the proposal and return last night to
either accept or reject it.
However, no one could agree
unanimously on what to do about the
proposal, Nilsson said.
Some fraternity representatives still
favored the modified Johnson
proposal while others supported
Nilsson's original proposal, which
extends to independent houses the
draw-exempt privilege which only
fraternities now claim.
Nilsson said some of the houses,
particularly Kappa Sigma and Delta
Kappa Epsilon, "did not think they
could fill their houses to the degree
the [Johnson] proposal asked for."
'University's Problem'
Other students supported one of
Nilsson's former stands that "this is a
University problem the University
should try to solve since it's a problem
the University created," Nilsson said.
They were willing to support
Nilsson's proposal even though it
increased the eviction rate for those
students remaining in the draw," he
maintained.
Johnson's proposal would
compensate for the increased eviction
rate by incorporating extra students
into the houses with draw-exempt
status.
"They were willing to take my
proposal or lose everything they
have," Nilsson added.
Nilsson feared that Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton will have
an advantage over fraternity members
because he does not have any verbal
dissenters among his ranks. "If we do
not stand behind one proposal, I think
the Housing Office can take advantage
of us," Nilsson lamented.
IFC Ballot
He said he plans to present a ballot
containing a number of popular
proposals to IFC members at the
Council's next meeting during Dead
Week.
The fraternity representatives will
then return to their houses with the
ballots to assess members' opinions
regarding the various proposals. After
the ballots are tallied, the IFC will
decide whether or not to commit itself
to one proposal.
Nilsson also remarked, "Larry

Horton is wrong in assuming that
temporary housing would be contrary
to what the students want." He stated
that rising prices in Palo Alto would
encourage students to accept any kind
of on-campus housing, even if
temporary.
Nilsson said the IFC plans to assess
student demand to determine the
validity of his assumption.

Members of the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) could not give united
support to any proposal at last night's
meeting, IFC President Mike Nilsson
said.
"There wasn't any decision that
could have been made," Nilsson
remarked.
At last week's meeting, the IFC
discussed a modified proposal by Pitch
Johnson which would have forced
fraternities and houses desiring
continuity to make a sacrifice in order
to maintain draw-exempt status.
Under the proposal, the houses
would have been forced to accept 33
percent more residents than are
presently in the house. The extra
students could either live off campus
or in crowded rooms in the house.
