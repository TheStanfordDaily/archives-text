# Top-Level University Committee Proposes $3810 Tuition Rate
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
A top-level University staff
committee will submit a proposal to
the Board of Trustees next month to
increase tuition by $435, from $3375
to $3BlO for the 1974-75 academic
year.
The proposal, composed by staff of
Provost William F. Miller and Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert R. Augsburger said, "We [the
University] have not been increasing
tuition at a rate commensurate with
our expansion and improvement of
academic programs and support
services."
Miller said the proposed tuition
raise is "aimed at getting through the
three-year budget adjustment
program," after which the tuition
revenues would provide funds for
improvement.
The Board of Trustees will consider
the proposal at its next regular
meeting Dec. 10.

The staff proposal stated that the
University's fastest growing expense is
financial aid. This growth reflects
higher tuition, cutbacks in federal
support and national changes in
student aid formulas.
Changes on the national level,
established earlier this year by the
College Scholarship Service, estimate
that aggregate financial need of college
students will raise $BOO million in
1975-76.
Even with the expected rise in
demand for financial aid, the
University will make a "net financial
gain" with the proposed tuition rise,
Miller said. "Some of the financial aid
comes from outside the University's
operating budget," he explained.
According to University figures,
more than half the undergraduate
student body (55 percent) now
receives some financial assistance.
Scholarships and grants account for
three-fourths of total aid.
Admissions Unaffected
The proposed tuition increase will
not affect admissions standards, Miller
said. "We [the University] intend to
hold to our policy of admitting first
and determining financial aid second."
The University last year sustained a
$713,000 deficit in its operating
budget, which is composed* mainly of
tuition revenues, and now anticipates a
$1.6 million deficit for 1974-75, even
after a three percent savings in
currently approved budgets.
Cornell University has already
advised students to expect a tuition
increase of 10 percent or more next
year. Several other major Eastern
universities plan substantial increases,
but do not reach final decisions on
rates as early as Stanford, a University
news release here said.
Meanwhile, the ASSU Senate
last night discussed the report of the
Senate's Select Committee on Tuition,
headed by Sen. Kevin McDermott.
Student Feelings
"The Senate's tuition report will be
submitted to the Board of Trustees" as
an expression of student feelings on
tuition increases, McDermott said. "I
think the University will consider the
recommendations of the report to
affect current studies on budget
decisions."

The ASSU Senate committee report
recommends "that the tuition increase
percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable
income or consumer price index, since
a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for
their education.
Citing University predictions that
percentage of the rise of the price
indices would be less than the
percentage increase in tuition, the
report stated that the suggested tuition
rise "is too large an increase" and

urged a reconsideration of the
proposal.
The McDermott committee also
opposed the University granting funds
for improvement.
"We feel inclusion of this factor
increases the burden of educational
costs too much," the report said.
"Although this funded improvement
factor is necessary to help achieve
growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of
resources from present non-essential
uses.

demand for financial aid, the
University will make a "net financial
gain" with the proposed tuition rise,
Miller said. "Some of the financial aid
comes from outside the University's
operating budget," he explained.
According to University figures,
more than half the undergraduate
student body (55 percent) now
receives some financial assistance.
Scholarships and grants account for
three-fourths of total aid.
Admissions Unaffected
The proposed tuition increase will
not affect admissions standards, Miller
said. "We [the University] intend to
hold to our policy of admitting first
and determining financial aid second."
The University last year sustained a
$713,000 deficit in its operating
budget, which is composed* mainly of
tuition revenues, and now anticipates a
$1.6 million deficit for 1974-75, even
after a three percent savings in
currently approved budgets.
Cornell University has already
advised students to expect a tuition
increase of 10 percent or more next
year. Several other major Eastern
universities plan substantial increases,
but do not reach final decisions on
rates as early as Stanford, a University
news release here said.
Meanwhile, the ASSU Senate
last night discussed the report of the
Senate's Select Committee on Tuition,
headed by Sen. Kevin McDermott.
Student Feelings
"The Senate's tuition report will be
submitted to the Board of Trustees" as
an expression of student feelings on
tuition increases, McDermott said. "I
think the University will consider the
recommendations of the report to
affect current studies on budget
decisions."

The ASSU Senate committee report
recommends "that the tuition increase
percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable
income or consumer price index, since
a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for
their education.
Citing University predictions that
percentage of the rise of the price
indices would be less than the
percentage increase in tuition, the
report stated that the suggested tuition
rise "is too large an increase" and

urged a reconsideration of the
proposal.
The McDermott committee also
opposed the University granting funds
for improvement.
"We feel inclusion of this factor
increases the burden of educational
costs too much," the report said.
"Although this funded improvement
factor is necessary to help achieve
growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of
resources from present non-essential

TUITION REPORT—ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott headed the Senate's Select
Committee on Tuition that opposed tuition hikes exceeding percentage rises in
consumer price and disposable income indices. He presented the committee's
report to the ASSU Senate last night.
A top-level University staff
committee will submit a proposal to
the Board of Trustees next month to
increase tuition by $435, from $3375
to $3BlO for the 1974-75 academic
year.
The proposal, composed by staff of
Provost William F. Miller and Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert R. Augsburger said, "We [the
University] have not been increasing
tuition at a rate commensurate with
our expansion and improvement of
academic programs and support
services."
Miller said the proposed tuition
raise is "aimed at getting through the
three-year budget adjustment
program," after which the tuition
revenues would provide funds for
improvement.
The Board of Trustees will consider
the proposal at its next regular
meeting Dec. 10.

The staff proposal stated that the
University's fastest growing expense is
financial aid. This growth reflects
higher tuition, cutbacks in federal
support and national changes in
student aid formulas.
Changes on the national level,
established earlier this year by the
College Scholarship Service, estimate
that aggregate financial need of college
students will raise $BOO million in
1975-76.
Even with the expected rise in
demand for financial aid, the
University will make a "net financial
gain" with the proposed tuition rise,
Miller said. "Some of the financial aid
