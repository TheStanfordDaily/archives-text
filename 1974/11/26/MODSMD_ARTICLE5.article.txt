# Budget Cuts Threaten Academic Standards
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS First of Two Parts 
Most educators agree that a
university's strength is based more
than any other factor on the quality of
its faculty. The recent announcement
that a large operating deficit will force
the University to reduce substantially
its expenses has raised fears that
Stanford's academic standing is
endangered.
Halsey Roy den, dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences, declared
that if the University must make major
cuts in its academic programs it will
follow "general practice" by
eliminating its weakest programs
rather than cutting expenses in every
department.
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost
for budget and planning, said that
during the University's 1969-74 $6
million Budget Adjustment Program
(BAP), the quality of its academic
programs was maintained by
eliminating speech instruction and
nuclear engineering altogether from
the University's program.
Kill Weak Programs
Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost
for faculty affairs, agreed that it is
better to kill weak programs than to
make cuts across the board.
"If I could, I \yould single out weak
and peripheral programs for the
deepest cuts," he said. "In order to
attract the best students and faculty
we must show them the best.
"This University has no reason for
survival if it can't keep its strong
departments good and it knows it. We
may see some cuts, but we're going to
make every effort to keep them [the
departments] strong."
But no University officials would
name any weak departments. All
administrators emphasized that major
cost cuts are still in the planning stage.
Quality Over Quantity
While University administrators
agree that Stanford's financial woes
adversely affect its ability to hire
faculty members, they all seem to
hope that faculty quality can be
Spared at the cost of quantity.
"Good faculty and good students
are the essence of this institution,"
Bienenstock declared last week. "IH
be looking for every opportunity to
maintain the strength of the faculty
when budget cuts are made."
Bienenstock explained that the
University has ceased to increase its
faculty size, except in the School of
Medicine. Although the money crunch
has not yet forced the University to
dismiss any instructors, he noted that
the failure to fill some vacant positions
may be due to financial problems.
According to Bienenstock, failure
to establish new faculty positions will
eventually deprive the University of
income.
Not only do good faculty members
attract graduate students, but the

average faculty member attracts
$16,000 in federal funds to the
University each year.
The addition of new faculty
members forces the University to add
to its facilities, including library stock
and laboratory equipment,
Bienenstock said. But the federal
government grants 46 percent of this
cost, about $l6 million each year.
This federal aid called indirect
cost recovery is highest in the
sciences because of the more expensive
equipment required there. But
Bienenstock emphasized that the
University is not about to spare cuts in
science departments to the detriment
of the humanities.
Humanities Important
"A lot of administrators
including myself are committed to
maintaining a first-rate university in
the humanities," Bienenstock
declared. "Not only do we believe that
humanities are essential to an
institution of higher learning but we
contend that they attract many strong
faculty members in the sciences who
agree with this view of a university."
Royden agreed with Bienenstock
that the liberal arts are "central to an
academic institution" and must be
maintained even if they don't always
pull their weight in attracting funds.
Administrators in every department
complained that inflation has deprived
instructors of increases in wages.
Royden claimed that faculty
salaries in the School of Humanities
and Sciences rank sixth or seventh in
the nation, but formerly ranked
higher.
Salary Comparisons
"We're just barely holding our own
and not quite that," Royden
commented. He added that salaries
here are particularly low at the highest
