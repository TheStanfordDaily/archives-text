# Housing Office Assigns 160 Students
## 
### 
In the first round of housing assignments for winter
quarter, 74 men and 86 women now living off campus
received on-campus housing. Still on the waiting list are 186
men and 79 women.
Second round assignments are scheduled to be made
Dec. 13 and 14.
Housing officials can't predict second round results, but
can only make comparisons with last year, said Sue
Richard, a housing office staff member.ln December 1973,
116 men and 68 women from off campus had been assigned
on-campus spots at the of round two.
"We will probably be able to offer any off-campus
women who stay on the list a spot," said Richard. However,
she noted that the men's off-campus waiting list looks
"frighteningly long."
Future Vacancies
Vacancies may still arise if a student turns down an
assignment. Also, if a student drops out of University
housing now more spaces would be available.
There are presently over 60 vacancies in Manzanita Park.
Students remaining in Manzanita and Mirrielees will be
allowed to choose new roommates. The forms for naming

roommates must be turned in to the Housing Office within
10 days after students learn there will be a vacancy in their
trailer or apartment or by Dec. 10—"whichever comes
first," said Richard.
Trailers now designated for women may also be
converted into men's trailers, Richard said.
There were 59 inter-residential switches 27 men and
32 women. Forty-two men and 79 women still remain on
the inter-residential waiting list, Richard said.
Mid-Quarter Switches
No more inter-residential switches will be made "until
winter quarter is underway," said Richard. Off-campus
assignments have priority, she said, noting that
inter-residential switches hold up the assigning process.
Students refusing assignments will be charged $lO,
dropped from the waiting list and will lose all accumulated
priorities.
They will also forfeit their $5O housing deposit and will
have "in effect" chosen to live off campus for winter
quarter, Richard said.
More assignments will be posted outside the Housing
Office on Jan. 3.
