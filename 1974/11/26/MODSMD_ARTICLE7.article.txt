# Hunger's Causes
## 
### Tim Knaak 
I was very disturbed to read
Kim Nyegaard's stand on the
hunger problem (Daily, Nov. 18).
Of course, it only represents the
outlook U.S. leaders are
encouraging and newspaper
editorials parroting throughout
the country.
The population density of
India is 447 people per square
mile; that of West Germany is
621; of Great Britain., 594. Most
countries facing food shortages
are far less densely populated than
India. The point is that the
problem is not excess population,
but rather the unequal
distribution of the world's wealth
and productive capacity.
According to the September
Scientific American, if the
technology available on a typical
lowa farm were applied to the
world's presently arable land,
enough food would be produced
for 10 to 13 times the present
world population. According to a
U.S. Department of Agriculture
study, surplus food in the
developed nations is sufficient to
balance the needs of those with
food shortages and will remain so
despite the doubling of the "food
gap" in the next decade.
Idealistic Moralizing
Nyegaard notes that "common
sense" reveals that better use of
technology could solve the
problem. Then why don't the
backward countries use their
"God-given minds" to do this?
Nyegaard is too busy with
idealistic moralizing to use hers
and fails to see that the good
"business sense" of capitalism
prevents any real solution. To
cover this up, the "free" press
parrots the government myths of
Malthusiasn overpopulation and
U.S; humanitarianism.
As Marion Clawson, of
Resources for the Future, Inc.,
noted: "of all the factors
involved, the major one is
economic the price has to be
right." The famous paradox of
"overproduction" while millions
starve is endemic to the capitalist
system. During the periodic
economic crises, it becomes
unprofitable for individual
producers to bring their food to
market and tons of it are burned
or dumped till prices rise.
Nyegaard claims that food

shortages are correlated with
population growth. Then how
does one account for the ability
of China to feed its millions
despite phenomenal population
growth? Not even America with
its "higher standard of living" can
claim to have ended hunger and
malnutrition within its borders
(cf. hearings of the U.S. Senate
Committee on Nutrition and
Human Needs, which also note a
rise in human consumption of pet
food in ghettos and among the
elderly). Common sense reveals
that a planned economy and
cooperation in things that matter
is better than anarchy in
production and cooperation to
support capitalist myths.
Can we at least pat ourselves
on the back for humanitarianism?
While the world famine has
grown, U.S. food aid has declined
from 18 million tons in 1965 to
nine in 1972 to three in
1973 to a projected 1.5 million
tons for 1974. Even then, 80
percent of that food was sold "at
the right price" (with a special
low-interest loan "deal" to South
Vietnam and Cambodia 75
percent) and a few other friends.
We offered one million tons at
the World Food Conference, but
quickly "doubled" our aid with
great fanfare. The current food
deficit is estimated from seven to
11 million tons.
The real reason for U.S.
emphasis on population growth is
indicated in a recent State
Department memorandum. After
blaming the problems of unequal
distribution, famine, environment
and unemployment on the
scapegoat of population growth, it
finally gets down to the real fear,
that such growth "enlarges the
danger of civil unrest and
promotes aggression endangering
peace."
This is fear of the "Yellow (or
Red) Peril." Fear that the masses
will become unwieldy and catch
on to being exploited. While blind
to the possibilities for positive
change, capitalist leaders are
aware that the U.S. won't be so
willing to support any more
"police actions" to preserve the
privileged few of the current
system.
