# Jews Made Israel
## 
### Louis Steinberg 
People keep saying that Israel
is a creation of the "imperialists."
You hear it so often that if you
don't stop to think, you might
even believe it. If you do stop to
think, it becomes absurd.
True, in a legal sense, Israel was
created by the United Nations,
but long before the U.N. acted,
the Jews of Israel had school
systems, a labor federation,
political parties and even a
shadow government.
In a real sense, Israel was
created by the labor of
generations of Jews. It was not
created by the U.N. or by England
any more than Algeria, for
instance, was created by France.
Nor were these Jews a "foreign
element," placed in the Middle
East only by the colonial policy
of some country, as whites were
in South Africa or North America.
Long ago there was a Jewish state
in what is now called Palestine,
and if it were not for Imperial
Rome it might well have been
there ever since.
Since they were exiled,
religious Jews have prayed three
times a day for the restoration of
a Jewish state in Israel. With the
rise of nationalism in the world,
this desire became a mass
movement for liberation from
statelessness and exile.
The language of Israeli Jews is
not a European language, but
Hebrew, as native to the Middle

East as Arabic. Jewish holidays
have always corresponded to the
times of harvest in Israel, and
Israel's literature and mythology
and morality are all rooted in
Middle Eastern sources.
And half of Israel's Jews are
descended frpm Asian and African
Jews, people from places like
Yemen, Syria and Egypt.
Yes, Zionists dealt with the
imperialists, trying to use the
imperialists' ambitions for their
own ends, and yes the imperialists
tried to use the Zionists. Every
movement of national liberation
has looked for aid where ever it
could be found, and every
imperialist nation has tried to use
the liberation movements when it
could.
Jordan, for instance, was
created by Britain as a reward to
one group of Arabs for their
support in World War I. And the
Jews of Palestine certainly did as
much as the Arabs to eject the
British.
So, if someone tells you that
the Palestinian Arabs have a right
to a Palestinian Arab state, agree
with him. But if he goes on to say
that the Israeli is an "imperialist
creation" and Jews have no right
to an Israeli Jewish state, set him
straight. Zionism is the Jewish
national liberation movement and
Israel is its fully legitimate
expression.
