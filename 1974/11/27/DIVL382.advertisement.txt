All Frye Boots are made from full
grain cowhide, which means that the
leather has not been split or
laminated. Their oakbend soles give
Frye boots the best leather soles
available.
Frye Boots are still benchcrafted
This means that many of the
operations are done by skilled
hands, fnuch the same as they were
over a hundred years ago.
A wide variety of styles are
available in handstained brown
cowhide or natural antiqued
cowhide.
From $34 to $52.
