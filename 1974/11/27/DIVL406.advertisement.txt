Subcommittee on Residences
The Committee on Services to Students (COSS) Subcommittee on Residences requests thoughtful
comments and proposals to rectify the current discrimination in undergraduate housing.
Last winter quarter, Alpha Sigma Phi, a coed fraternity, requested exemption from the housing
draw. Its petition asserted that the University's policy of placing a fraternity in the draw simply
because it admits women is discriminatory on the basis of sex.
The Alpha Sigma Phi request was unanimously turned down last winter by a Housing Configura
tion Advisory Panel. The panel felt that, by extending exemptions to Alpha Sigma Phi and all other
similar houses, the resultant rise in the eviction rate of students not in the exempt houses could not be
justified. But the panel recognized the validity of the claim that the present housing system
discriminates on the basis of sex, and recommended that a special committee be established to study
the issue.
Since the matter became public last February, it has been the subject of much concern and study.
Because of the housing shortage and the desirability of on-campus living, many students, in
draw-controlled housing as well as draw-exempt housing, realize that they will be affected by any
changes in the system.
As a first order of business this autumn, COSS established its Subcommittee on Residences. This
subcommittee is now systematically and objectively examining the organization of Stanford under
graduate residences, including the allocation of privileges (e.g., draw exemption). This ten-member
subcommittee has been meeting two or three times per week. It is currently establishing a general
framework of principles within which the issues may be considered.
The subcommittee agrees that: Men and women should be treated equally within the housing
system. The present housing system discriminates against women in that they have no option to obtain
draw exemption. Therefore, the present housing system should be changed, and the new system
should treat men and women equally. This does not mean that men and women must have equal
access to a particular house, but simply to the University's housing options. Whether a house is
single-sex or coed should not in itself be a factor in the allocation of privileges.
The subcommittee recognizes that to obtain equity, privileges must be extended and/or modified.
The subcommittee will be considering the selection process for individual houses as well as the broader
question of access to on-campus housing.
A number of proposals to solve the inequity have been submitted and are currently being
considered by the committee. All proposals submitted so far and all other pertinent documents are
available in public binders in the Office of Residential Education, third floor, Old Union, and in the
Row Office, 584 Mayfield. Students are encouraged to submit any thoughtful comments and
proposals-considering disadvantages as well as advantages-fora housing policy that will rectify the
current discrimination.
Proposals should be submitted to the Office of Residential Education no later than December 6,
1974. The subcommittee's final recommendation will be a public document and will be submitted to
Dean Lyons and President Lyman. ,
