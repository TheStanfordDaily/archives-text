HEALTH CARE DELIVERY
AND PUBLIC POLICY
at
STANFORD IN BRITAIN
SUMMER QUARTER, 1974-75
Stanford Overseas Studies, working in conjunction
with Professor Count D. Gibson of the Department
of Family, Community, and Preventive Medicine at
the Stanford Medical School, has planned an eight
week summer session for undergraduates and M.D.
candidates interested in the social aspects of health
care delivery. The program will be given at the
Stanford-in-Britain studies center near London in the
summer of 1975. It will be preceded by a three-unit
"Seminar in Comparative Health Care Systems," to
be offered in the Spring Quarter, 1974-75, at
Stanford.
(The regular summer program in British area
studies will be offered at the same time as the
special program in health care delivery for those stu
dents who do not take part in the special program.
There will be places for about 40 students in this
regular program.)
The special program is designed not only for students
preparing for a career in the health sciences but also
for all students in other areas who are interested in
the economic, political and cultural aspects of
health care delivery.
Some M.D. candidates may have the opportunity to
take clerkships in the United Kingdom in the autumn
following the special program.
THE PROGRAM
The program in Britain will have three parts:
1) A five-unit two-week course called
"Introduction to Health Care
Organization and Financing" taught
by Professor Count D. Gibson and
a British colleague
2) A five-unit three-week period during
which each of the 10 teams will do
field study on and produce a written
report about a particular problem or
issue in health care in the British
Isles
3) A five-unit three-week seminar on health
care in which the reports from the
10 teams will be discussed in three
or four sessions per week.
All students will be required to produce a paper com
paring the strengths and weaknesses of the British
and American health care delivery systems.
PREPARATION-SPRING SEMINAR, 1974-75
In order to develop an acquaintance with the litera
ture and to form a base against which to compare the
British experience, students in the spring seminar
will concern themselves with discussions of and field
study on assigned topics analogous in Northern
California to those to be undertaken in Britain. This
seminar is stronqly recommended for all. This course,
which will meet weekly at night, is not a prerequisite
but is strongly recommended.
PARTICIPANTS
Thirty (30) undergraduates and ten (10) M.D. candi
dates will be selected. The 30 undergraduates will be
divided into ten teams of three persons each, with
each team led by one of the M.D. candidates.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTION
Undergraduates: Priority will be given to Stanford
students. Students who have not previously partici
pated in a Stanford program overseas and students
with some evidence of course preparation for study
in England will be given preference (see the list of
recommended courses in the Britain folder). Priority
will go to those nearest graduation and to those
students applying to stay for two or more quarters
overseas.
M.D. Candidates: Priority will be given to Stanford
M.D. candidates. Students shall have completed their
first year of medical school and must have taken
DFCPM 200 (Department of Family, Community,
and Preventive Medicine 200), "Health Care and
Society. Priority will be given to those nearest
graduation. If the number of equally qualified can
didates exceeds the spaces available, the participants
will be drawn by lot and an alternative list established.
HOW TO APPLY AND DEADLINES
Application forms are available in 112 Old Union and
106 Medical School. Applications are due by
December 6, 1974, and selections will be announced
on December 16, 1974. After the application deadline,
if all places are not taken, applications will be con
sidered on a first-come first-served ba§is. There is no
advantage to applying early before the deadline.

HEALTH CARE DELIVERY
AND PUBLIC POLICY
at
STANFORD IN BRITAIN
SUMMER QUARTER, 1974-75
Stanford Overseas Studies, working in conjunction
with Professor Count D. Gibson of the Department
of Family, Community, and Preventive Medicine at
the Stanford Medical School, has planned an eight
week summer session for undergraduates and M.D.
candidates interested in the social aspects of health
care delivery. The program will be given at the
Stanford-in-Britain studies center near London in the
summer of 1975. It will be preceded by a three-unit
"Seminar in Comparative Health Care Systems," to
be offered in the Spring Quarter, 1974-75, at
Stanford.
(The regular summer program in British area
studies will be offered at the same time as the
special program in health care delivery for those stu
dents who do not take part in the special program.
There will be places for about 40 students in this
regular program.)
The special program is designed not only for students
preparing for a career in the health sciences but also
for all students in other areas who are interested in
the economic, political and cultural aspects of
health care delivery.
Some M.D. candidates may have the opportunity to
take clerkships in the United Kingdom in the autumn
following the special program.
THE PROGRAM
The program in Britain will have three parts:
1) A five-unit two-week course called
"Introduction to Health Care
Organization and Financing" taught
by Professor Count D. Gibson and
a British colleague
2) A five-unit three-week period during
which each of the 10 teams will do
field study on and produce a written
report about a particular problem or
issue in health care in the British
Isles
3) A five-unit three-week seminar on health
care in which the reports from the
10 teams will be discussed in three
or four sessions per week.
All students will be required to produce a paper com
paring the strengths and weaknesses of the British
and American health care delivery systems.
PREPARATION-SPRING SEMINAR, 1974-75
In order to develop an acquaintance with the litera
ture and to form a base against which to compare the
British experience, students in the spring seminar
will concern themselves with discussions of and field
study on assigned topics analogous in Northern
California to those to be undertaken in Britain. This
seminar is stronqly recommended for all. This course,
which will meet weekly at night, is not a prerequisite
but is strongly recommended.
PARTICIPANTS
Thirty (30) undergraduates and ten (10) M.D. candi
dates will be selected. The 30 undergraduates will be
divided into ten teams of three persons each, with
each team led by one of the M.D. candidates.
CRITERIA FOR SELECTION
Undergraduates: Priority will be given to Stanford
students. Students who have not previously partici
pated in a Stanford program overseas and students
with some evidence of course preparation for study
in England will be given preference (see the list of
recommended courses in the Britain folder). Priority
will go to those nearest graduation and to those
students applying to stay for two or more quarters
overseas.
M.D. Candidates: Priority will be given to Stanford
M.D. candidates. Students shall have completed their
first year of medical school and must have taken
DFCPM 200 (Department of Family, Community,
and Preventive Medicine 200), "Health Care and
Society. Priority will be given to those nearest
graduation. If the number of equally qualified can
didates exceeds the spaces available, the participants
will be drawn by lot and an alternative list established.
HOW TO APPLY AND DEADLINES
Application forms are available in 112 Old Union and
106 Medical School. Applications are due by

HEALTH CARE DELIVERY
AND PUBLIC POLICY
at
STANFORD IN BRITAIN
SUMMER QUARTER, 1974-75
Stanford Overseas Studies, working in conjunction
with Professor Count D. Gibson of the Department
of Family, Community, and Preventive Medicine at
the Stanford Medical School, has planned an eight
week summer session for undergraduates and M.D.
candidates interested in the social aspects of health
care delivery. The program will be given at the
Stanford-in-Britain studies center near London in the
summer of 1975. It will be preceded by a three-unit
"Seminar in Comparative Health Care Systems," to
be offered in the Spring Quarter, 1974-75, at
Stanford.
(The regular summer program in British area
studies will be offered at the same time as the
special program in health care delivery for those stu
dents who do not take part in the special program.
There will be places for about 40 students in this
regular program.)
The special program is designed not only for students
preparing for a career in the health sciences but also
for all students in other areas who are interested in
the economic, political and cultural aspects of
health care delivery.
Some M.D. candidates may have the opportunity to
take clerkships in the United Kingdom in the autumn
following the special program.
THE PROGRAM
The program in Britain will have three parts:
1) A five-unit two-week course called
"Introduction to Health Care
Organization and Financing" taught
by Professor Count D. Gibson and
a British colleague
2) A five-unit three-week period during
which each of the 10 teams will do
field study on and produce a written
report about a particular problem or
issue in health care in the British
Isles
3) A five-unit three-week seminar on health
care in which the reports from the
10 teams will be discussed in three
or four sessions per week.
All students will be required to produce a paper com
paring the strengths and weaknesses of the British
and American health care delivery systems.
PREPARATION-SPRING SEMINAR, 1974-75
In order to develop an acquaintance with the litera
ture and to form a base against which to compare the
British experience, students in the spring seminar
will concern themselves with discussions of and field
study on assigned topics analogous in Northern
California to those to be undertaken in Britain. This
seminar is stronqly recommended for all. This course,
which will meet weekly at night, is not a prerequisite
but is strongly recommended.
PARTICIPANTS
Thirty (30) undergraduates and ten (10) M.D. candi
dates will be selected. The 30 undergraduates will be
divided into ten teams of three persons each, with
each team led by one of the M.D. candidates.

students. Students who have not previously partici
