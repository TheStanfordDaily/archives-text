# ASSU Committee Report Says Tuition Lacks Student Input
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition recommended
in its final report "that a student or
students be included on the staff of
the Academic Planning Office as
part-time assistants" to "influence"
tuition decisions.
The committee, headed by ASSU
Sen. Kevin McDermott, submitted the
report to the ASSU Senate Monday
night.
"The tuition report will be
submitted to the Board of Trustees" as
an expression of student feelings on

tuition increases, McDermott said. "I
think the University will consider the
recommendations of the report to
affect current studies on budget
decisions."
ASSU President Mike Herman
yesterday said he agreed that the
University does "put a lot of value in
student opinion. I see no problem with
getting students" on the Academic
Planning Office staff.
Constructive
Student influence on tuition
increases would serve in a constructive
way rather than in the "reactionary"

way that students are now heard, the
report said.
According to the McDermott
committee, direct student input would
change the present situation in which,
students "have some control over the
final decision, but generally their
influence functions only in a review
capacity."
The report suggested that a study
be made on qualified students who
chose not to apply here. It proposed a
poll of University of California
freshmen.
Questions would probe why they
chose to attend a public school;
whether they applied to a private
school; if so, did they apply to
Stanford; if not, why not.
Advance Notice
The University should also
communicate its tuition increase
decision to students before presenting
the proposal to the Board of Trustees.
The report said that student reactions
"should provide constructive
suggestions" so as to improve the
decision-making process.
McDermott's report stipulated that
"the tuition increase percentage
should not exceed the greater of
increases of disposable income or
consumer price index, since a greater
increase would cause increased burden
on those paying for their education."
The proposed tuition increase of
$435 for the 1975-76 academic year
was termed "too large" by the
committee. Since the University has
proposed that tuition be raised by
more than the projected rise of
personal disposable income, the
committee urged reconsideration of
the tuition increase.
While supporting the University's
previous policy of providing financial
aid to all students with demonstrated
need, the committee opposed the
policy of adopting new aid guidelines
for entering students.

Sortie Need
"Returning students have the same
need and should be treated equally,"
the report said. "At a minimum,
everyone should be eligible for loans
or jobs" by the new standards.
The report pointed to the
inefficient use of resources because of
attendance patterns. For every 100
students that start classes in the fall
only 98 return for winter quarter and
92 in the spring. "Thus, when the
University expands to fulfill the entire
need in the autumn, it has an excess of
resources in the spring.

"One alternative would be to give a
discount to any student attending
three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example, tuition
[would be] $l2OO a quarter unless a
person has gone fall and winter, then
spring tuition would only cost $900,"
the report said.
Under the present system of fixed

tuition each academic year "the
person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming
the full year pays for him," it said.
With respect to the budget, the
committee opposed the University's
plan to continually improve academic
programs. "In this period of extreme
economic problems, we feel inclusion
of the factor [of improvement]
increases the burden of educational
costs too much," the committee said.
"Although this improvement is
necessary to help achieve growth "new
programs can be established by a
reallocation of resources from present
non-essential uses," it said.
The committee said the economic
situation dictates that program
cutbacks must be made. "We [the
committee] feel that it is better to
sacrifice one program and save the
quality of the rest. Equal reductions
everywhere will just lead us down the
path to mediocrity," the report said.
ASSU Sen. Tom Price and Senate
Chairman Lee Rosenbaum joined
McDermott on the tuition committee.

MONEY MATTERS—Stanford's proposed $435 tuition hike is necessary to beat
off the constantly rising costs of higher education, Acting President William
Miller said last night on KZSU.
The ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition recommended
in its final report "that a student or
students be included on the staff of
the Academic Planning Office as
part-time assistants" to "influence"
tuition decisions.
The committee, headed by ASSU
Sen. Kevin McDermott, submitted the
report to the ASSU Senate Monday
night.
"The tuition report will be
submitted to the Board of Trustees" as
an expression of student feelings on

tuition increases, McDermott said. "I
think the University will consider the
recommendations of the report to
affect current studies on budget
decisions."
ASSU President Mike Herman
yesterday said he agreed that the
University does "put a lot of value in
student opinion. I see no problem with
getting students" on the Academic
Planning Office staff.
Constructive
Student influence on tuition
increases would serve in a constructive
way rather than in the "reactionary"

way that students are now heard, the
report said.
According to the McDermott
committee, direct student input would
change the present situation in which,
students "have some control over the
final decision, but generally their
influence functions only in a review
capacity."
The report suggested that a study
be made on qualified students who
chose not to apply here. It proposed a
poll of University of California
freshmen.
Questions would probe why they
chose to attend a public school;
whether they applied to a private
school; if so, did they apply to
Stanford; if not, why not.
Advance Notice
The University should also
communicate its tuition increase
decision to students before presenting
the proposal to the Board of Trustees.
The report said that student reactions
"should provide constructive
suggestions" so as to improve the
decision-making process.
McDermott's report stipulated that
"the tuition increase percentage
should not exceed the greater of
increases of disposable income or
consumer price index, since a greater
increase would cause increased burden
on those paying for their education."
The proposed tuition increase of
$435 for the 1975-76 academic year
was termed "too large" by the
committee. Since the University has
proposed that tuition be raised by
more than the projected rise of
personal disposable income, the
committee urged reconsideration of
the tuition increase.
While supporting the University's
previous policy of providing financial
aid to all students with demonstrated
need, the committee opposed the
policy of adopting new aid guidelines
for entering students.

Sortie Need
"Returning students have the same
need and should be treated equally,"
the report said. "At a minimum,
everyone should be eligible for loans
or jobs" by the new standards.
The report pointed to the
inefficient use of resources because of
attendance patterns. For every 100
students that start classes in the fall
only 98 return for winter quarter and
92 in the spring. "Thus, when the
University expands to fulfill the entire
need in the autumn, it has an excess of
resources in the spring.

"One alternative would be to give a
discount to any student attending
three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example, tuition
[would be] $l2OO a quarter unless a
person has gone fall and winter, then
spring tuition would only cost $900,"
the report said.
Under the present system of fixed

tuition each academic year "the
person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming
the full year pays for him," it said.

previous policy of providing financial
aid to all students with demonstrated
need, the committee opposed the
policy of adopting new aid guidelines
for entering students.

Sortie Need
"Returning students have the same
need and should be treated equally,"
the report said. "At a minimum,
everyone should be eligible for loans
or jobs" by the new standards.
The report pointed to the
inefficient use of resources because of
attendance patterns. For every 100
students that start classes in the fall
only 98 return for winter quarter and
92 in the spring. "Thus, when the
University expands to fulfill the entire
need in the autumn, it has an excess of
resources in the spring.

"One alternative would be to give a
discount to any student attending
three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example, tuition
[would be] $l2OO a quarter unless a
person has gone fall and winter, then
spring tuition would only cost $900,"
the report said.
Under the present system of fixed

tuition each academic year "the
person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming
the full year pays for him," it said.
With respect to the budget, the
committee opposed the University's
plan to continually improve academic
programs. "In this period of extreme
economic problems, we feel inclusion
of the factor [of improvement]
increases the burden of educational
costs too much," the committee said.
"Although this improvement is
necessary to help achieve growth "new
programs can be established by a
reallocation of resources from present
non-essential uses," it said.
The committee said the economic
situation dictates that program
cutbacks must be made. "We [the
committee] feel that it is better to
sacrifice one program and save the
quality of the rest. Equal reductions
everywhere will just lead us down the
path to mediocrity," the report said.

MONEY MATTERS—Stanford's proposed $435 tuition hike is necessary to beat
off the constantly rising costs of higher education, Acting President William
Miller said last night on KZSU.
The ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition recommended
in its final report "that a student or
students be included on the staff of
the Academic Planning Office as
part-time assistants" to "influence"
tuition decisions.
The committee, headed by ASSU
Sen. Kevin McDermott, submitted the
report to the ASSU Senate Monday
night.
"The tuition report will be
submitted to the Board of Trustees" as
an expression of student feelings on

tuition increases, McDermott said. "I
think the University will consider the
recommendations of the report to
affect current studies on budget
decisions."
ASSU President Mike Herman
yesterday said he agreed that the
University does "put a lot of value in
student opinion. I see no problem with
getting students" on the Academic
Planning Office staff.
Constructive
Student influence on tuition
increases would serve in a constructive
way rather than in the "reactionary"

way that students are now heard, the
report said.
According to the McDermott
committee, direct student input would
change the present situation in which,
students "have some control over the
final decision, but generally their
influence functions only in a review
capacity."
The report suggested that a study
be made on qualified students who
chose not to apply here. It proposed a
poll of University of California
freshmen.
Questions would probe why they
chose to attend a public school;
whether they applied to a private
school; if so, did they apply to
Stanford; if not, why not.
Advance Notice
The University should also
communicate its tuition increase
decision to students before presenting
the proposal to the Board of Trustees.
The report said that student reactions
"should provide constructive
suggestions" so as to improve the
decision-making process.
McDermott's report stipulated that
"the tuition increase percentage
should not exceed the greater of
increases of disposable income or
consumer price index, since a greater
increase would cause increased burden
on those paying for their education."
The proposed tuition increase of
$435 for the 1975-76 academic year
was termed "too large" by the
committee. Since the University has
proposed that tuition be raised by
more than the projected rise of
personal disposable income, the
committee urged reconsideration of
the tuition increase.
While supporting the University's
previous policy of providing financial
aid to all students with demonstrated
need, the committee opposed the
policy of adopting new aid guidelines
for entering students.
