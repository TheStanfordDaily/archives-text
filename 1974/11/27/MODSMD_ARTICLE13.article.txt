# Faculty Finances A Major Problem
## 
### William Ross 
Such is the embarrassment of riches: after
using high salaries to lure dozens of Ivy
League professors to Stanford during the last
decade, the University is now aghast because
developing schools are trying to recruit
professors from Stanford.
Although Stanford has not yet lost any
major faculty member, University
administrators are clearly worried that
current money problems will weaken the
University's ability to hire new faculty
members.
University finances are strained to the
point where cuts in its academic programs
including faculty expenses appear
inevitable. Rather than cut departments
straight across the board, the University has
decided to eliminate altogether its weakest
programs.
Those programs that are strongest will be
maintained at current levels. Administrators
are tight-lipped about which programs will be
sliced or killed, but admit that cuts will occur
not only in weak departments, but also
among weak programs in strong departments.
Elimination
The University has already tried
eliminating weak programs in strong
departments, and the departments have
emerged from the process stronger than ever.
The elimination of Stanford's nuclear
engineering program and several Graduate
School of Business programs in order to cut
costs has not seemed to hurt the departments
in which they occurred.
Furthermore, this strategy is consistent
with recent trends in higher education.
Rather than attempt to maintain a large
number of mediocre programs, more and
more universities strive to concentrate

financial efforts in certain key areas.
Specialization by universities in certain
areas has considerable educational
advantages. It allows the best students and
faculty members to congregate in one place
to share their talents.
There is, of course, always the danger of a
university becoming too narrow in its
academic focus, thereby violating the
traditional purpose of a liberal arts
institution. \
Isolation Unlikely
But Stanford is unlikely to isolate itself in
this way. At worst, only a few programs will
have to be stopped. The University's
administration doesn't like to admit that it
can't retain every program and realistically
hope for each one to rank among the best of
its kind in the nation.
But during the past several months, the
administration has cast aside some of its
pride, admitted the existence of severe
financial worries and embarked on a program
to save intact the best that Stanford has
to offer.
This policy should enable the University
to retain its best faculty members, but
administrators clearly are worried that some
of them will be lost as a consequence of the
financial crunch.
Perhaps they remember how Stanford
during its expansion in the 1960s recruited
faculty en masse from the nation's best
universities. Since Stanford didn't hesitate to
boast about its successes in plethora of press
releases, maybe the University fears that
other developing schools have decided to
copy Stanford's technique.
Or perhaps administrators recall the

departure of Nobel-Prize Winning economist
Kenneth Arrow in 1968. Arrow returned to
Harvard, complaining that Stanford had
failed to provide enough support for the
Economics Department.
Arrow's resignation is a graphic reminder
of how financial difficulties can cost schools
their best faculty members. Although the
Economics Department retained its other
leading professors, the University still misses
Arrow's presence, as evidenced by its recent
and unsuccessful attempt to persuade
him to return.
There is no evidence however, that
financial woes have hindered recent attempts
at faculty recruitment. As Raymond
Bacchetti, vice provost for budget and
planning, noted last week, the University can
usually find funds for what he termed an
"exciting appointment."
During the past year, the University failed
to attract Harvard Political Science Prof.
Seymour Martin Lipset. But Lipset's reasons
for not coming here were not necessarily
financial.
Meanwhile, former Treasury Secretary
George Schultz accepted a Business School
appointment and Prof. Norman Shumway,
the noted heart surgeon, chose to disregard
lucrative offers from the University of
California.
If the University follows its policy of
cutting the worst programs and maintaining
the best at their current levels, no one need
fear that Stanford will be deserted by its best
faculty members.
