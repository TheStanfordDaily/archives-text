# Brown's Israel Remarks ‘Correct’
## 
### John Rarick 
Possibilities of renewed warfare
in the Middle East this time war
directly involving the United
States loom on the
not-too-distant horizon, according
to most international observers
in Washington.
Secret alliances, stacking the
full military might of this country
on the side of Israel in the event
of a new flare-up, have allegedly
been made at the highest levels of
government.
It appears that we are
stumbling »diplomatically into
another Vietnam. The American
people who will be called on to
give their tax money and sons to
fight for Israel are being given the
same blind, one-sided presentation
we received before plunging into
that Southeast Asian fiasco.
But anyone in authority who
dares to suggest this is purged.
Brownian Brouhaha
Last week, Gen. George S.
Brown, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, caused a brouhaha
to erupt when he correctly
pointed out the unbelievably
strong hold that Israel, a foreign
nation, has on the formation of
Pentagon policies. Demands for
his immediate removal as the
nation's highest military officer
were swift.
Despite a public rebuke from
the President and an apology from
Brown, which followed within
hours of publication of the story,
vehement demands from the
Jewish community for his removal
continue.
Brown's comments, made more
than a month ago,* reveal some
interesting sidelights on the extent
of power generated by the Israeli
lobby in shaping U.S. military
policies in the Middle East.
Referring to the Jewish lobby
efforts on Capitol Hill and at the
Pentagon, he said:
"It's so strong you wouldn't
believe it now. We have the
Israelis coming to us for
equipment. We say we can't
possibly get the Congress to
support a program like that. They
say, 'Don't worry about Congress.
We'll take care of the Congress.'
"Now this is somebody from
another country," he added, "but
they can do it. They own, you
know, the banks in this country,

the newspapers you just look at
where the Jewish money is in this
country."
Reports surfaced last April that
Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt, then
Chief of Naval Operations, was
actively lobbying influential
Jewish businessmen in an effort to
get them to apply pressure on
Congress to approve the
Pentagon's $86.9 billion budget
request. His argument was that
the stockpile of U.S. military
armaments had been reduced by
as much as one-third due to the
Yom Kippur War. He asserted that
they must be rebuilt if this
country is to once again come to
the rescue of the Israelis from the
Arabs.

Ira Silverman, director of the
Institute for Jewish Policy
Planning and Research, confirmed
the fact that Zumwalt was
"lobbying the Jewish lobby."
"One level is rather subtle,"
Silverman said. "They are saying,
'We helped you, now you help us.'
'lnvaluable Weapons'
"At the practical level, C-5
transport planes and aircraft
carriers, items previously opposed
by the would-be military budget
slashers, were invaluable in
support of Israel during the war,
so will American military capacity
in the future determine Israel's
security."
Interestingly enough, the
Defense Department

appropriations bill passed with
only cosmetic cuts.
It is a potentially dangerous
situation anytime that a foreign
country has ias much unmitigated
".power to direct the military and
diplomatic course of the United
States as the tiny state of Israel
apparently does. For foreigners to
direct the internal affairs of
Americans at all is outrageous.
All Americans need heed
Brown's admonition. His removal
or coerced resignation will prove
the accuracy of his statement and
the failure of our foreign policy.
