# U.N. Now Political Weapon
## 
### Jeffrey Greenwald 
In the past five years, the U.N.
has ceased its role as a political
forum for nations, and has
become a political weapon.
In these years, Taiwan was
removed, in favor of the "real"
China, South Africa was shelved
until its national attitudes on
racial discrimination were changed
and the original doctrine on who
could debate was altered to allow
the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) to debate all
in the name of international
cooperation.
When the U.N. attempts to set
policies with conduct that
diverges from the goals of its
doctrine, the inevitable result is
one of international politics that
can only inhibit the desires to
achieve international peace and
understanding.
The concept of the U.N. is one
of developing a communication
path between the 140 nations of
the world so that they may
understand and respect the
philosophies of the other nations,
and that perhaps by this
communication, international
differences can be worked out at a
table, and not on the battle

ground.
But by excommunicating a
country because of its national
philosophies, the U.N. is actually
contradicting its goal of respect
and honor of its member nations,
and is instead submitting to the
political whims of the time.
The U.N. cannot afford to
prostitute itself in this manner; its
mission is too valuable, and its
commitment to world peace is too
dear. Shall corruptness and
political maneuvering be
manifested in the U.N. just as
these have in countries at the
national level?
One-fourth of the world's
population is starving to death,,
one-third of the world's
population live in poverty or with
disease, another billion people are
illiterate, and the U.N. spends the
majority of its time debating
whether or not to suspend a
country or to debate issues with
decade after decade of no
solutions.
One Or The Other
Either set the goals and
conduct as one and the same, or
shirk the responsibility that it has
set for itself. When this forum is
no longer viewed as such, when

corrupt political maneuvering is
the precursor to international
disrespect of U.N. fundamental
goals, when intimadation works
more frequently than
cooperation, the U.N. should fold.
This criticism is not
preemptory to the founding of
organizations such as UNCTAD
and UNESCO, and to policies
which have resulted in
international cooperation, it is
merely a questioning of the
methods in which decisions are
arrived at the international level.
Because the method in which
decisions are arrived fit is as
important as what the decision
arrived at is, the U.N. needs to
re-evaluate its operating capacity.
The U.N. must re-assert its
commitment to preserving
international peace, using those
methods and channels that
exemplify the cooperation that it
wants its member nations to
emulate.
Only when the U.N. has lifted
itself above the problems that it is
attempting to solve will its policy
goals be reached and the obstacles
to world peace be simplified.
