Editor:
I wish to comment on Jazmyn
Mac Donald's very poetic letter to
the Stanford Band printed in the
(Nov. 25) Daily. As a member of
the LSJUMB, I'd like to set a few
things straight.
First of all, Mac Donald refers
to the Band's Bonfire. Before we
decided to play, many members
of the band, myself included, were
strongly opposed to the building
and burning of the Bonfire.
As far as attacking our social
and political morals and priorities,
Mac Donald goes too far. The
LSJUMB is a tinit, but it is
composed of individuals. We are
all Stanford students, here for
various reasons and participating
in various activities during the
year. We have minds and
consciences as everyone else does.
When we are outside of the
Band, we can, and do, concern
ourselves with whatever seems
important to us, whether it is war,
poverty and hunger, or studying
or having fun. Who is Jazmyn
Mac Donald to tell me that my
priorities are wrongly placed?
When we are together as a unit,
we are "The Band," carrying with
us all the stereotypes that the
Band has acquired over the years.
People enjoy listening to us and
we enjoy playing. What more
reason is there for us to exist? No
one could, or should, devote
themselves to the problems of the
world twenty-four hours a day.
Only after a release can we look
with a proper perspective at the
world.
The Band serves a definite
purpose in Stanford life. It does
not pervade into our entire lives
but it provides us, and those that
appreciate us, with that release
that makes staying at Stanford
enjoyable. I, personally, would
not want to give that up for
anything.

Misdirected Budget Cuts
Editor:
The administration's plan to
cut the teaching and research
budget by 17 percent is oddly
misdirected. Large cuts should be
made in the administration itself,
where proliferating bureaucrats
and assistants to assistants
consume an ever-increasing share
of the total budget. If times are
hard, superfluous characters, not
the essence of the University,
should be sacrificed.
We hope the University
community will join with us in
pressing for a revision of
administration policy.

'Study Nature'
Editor:
The other day at the California
Academy of Sciences I was
informed that Stanford plans to
loan or give away most of its
systematic collections. The fishes
are already at the Academy, some
of the plants and fossils are at
Berkeley and so forth.
This is probably a mistake. A
collection of rocks, fossils, plants,
or animals is at least as useful an
information source as a collection
of books, and as Agassiz said,
"Study nature, not books."

'Half-Time Status'
Editor:
The ASSU task force proposal
recommending half-time status for
undergraduates over age 25 merits
serious consideration, but why
should such an option be limited
to older students?
Half-time status for
undergraduates as a whole would
grant relief from the treadmill
approach to education, would
allow pursuit of non-academic
interests concurrent with a
traditional curriculum, and would,
for economically strapped
students, provide an alternative to
dropping out for an entire quarter
or more to earn tuition dollars.
If in fact Stanford's primary
purpose is the education of young
people, the benefits of increased
flexibility offered by the
extension of the half-time status
option to all students would
outweigh any conceivable
resultant increase in costs.

Misdirected Budget Cuts
Editor:
The administration's plan to
cut the teaching and research
budget by 17 percent is oddly
misdirected. Large cuts should be
made in the administration itself,
where proliferating bureaucrats
and assistants to assistants
consume an ever-increasing share
of the total budget. If times are
hard, superfluous characters, not
the essence of the University,
should be sacrificed.
We hope the University
community will join with us in
pressing for a revision of
administration policy.

The other day at the California
Academy of Sciences I was
informed that Stanford plans to
loan or give away most of its
systematic collections. The fishes
are already at the Academy, some
of the plants and fossils are at
Berkeley and so forth.
This is probably a mistake. A
collection of rocks, fossils, plants,
or animals is at least as useful an
information source as a collection
of books, and as Agassiz said,
"Study nature, not books."

'Half-Time Status'
Editor:
The ASSU task force proposal
recommending half-time status for
undergraduates over age 25 merits
serious consideration, but why
should such an option be limited
to older students?
Half-time status for
undergraduates as a whole would
grant relief from the treadmill
approach to education, would
allow pursuit of non-academic
interests concurrent with a
traditional curriculum, and would,
for economically strapped
students, provide an alternative to
dropping out for an entire quarter
or more to earn tuition dollars.
If in fact Stanford's primary
purpose is the education of young
people, the benefits of increased
flexibility offered by the
extension of the half-time status
option to all students would
outweigh any conceivable
resultant increase in costs.

I wish to comment on Jazmyn
Mac Donald's very poetic letter to
the Stanford Band printed in the
(Nov. 25) Daily. As a member of
the LSJUMB, I'd like to set a few
things straight.
First of all, Mac Donald refers
to the Band's Bonfire. Before we
decided to play, many members
of the band, myself included, were
strongly opposed to the building
and burning of the Bonfire.
As far as attacking our social
and political morals and priorities,
Mac Donald goes too far. The
LSJUMB is a tinit, but it is
composed of individuals. We are
all Stanford students, here for
various reasons and participating
in various activities during the
year. We have minds and
consciences as everyone else does.
When we are outside of the
Band, we can, and do, concern
ourselves with whatever seems
important to us, whether it is war,
poverty and hunger, or studying
or having fun. Who is Jazmyn
Mac Donald to tell me that my
priorities are wrongly placed?
When we are together as a unit,
we are "The Band," carrying with
us all the stereotypes that the
Band has acquired over the years.
People enjoy listening to us and
we enjoy playing. What more
reason is there for us to exist? No
one could, or should, devote
themselves to the problems of the
world twenty-four hours a day.
Only after a release can we look
