## Feasting And Friendships Mark Campus Cook’s 40th Anniversary 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
David "Tommy" Thomas has 4000 sons, and he has a
place in his heart for every one of them.
Some are doctors, lawyers, one is a bank president, all
have done well in life and all have received a Stanford
education.
Tommy is a special kind of father, and last night he was
treated in away no ordinary father would ever know. One
hundred of his sons well-scrubbed, clean-shaven and
dressed in their finest jackets and ties filed into the
dark-stained, wood-paneled El Toro Eating Club dining
room to honor their dad for "simply being himself."
But besides paying tribute to him for being a very special
person, club members honored Tommy for being a very
special cook.
Last night marked Tommy's 40th year of cooking for
Stanford fraternities and eating clubs. So when El Toro
members wanted to throw a party to commemorate this
anniversary, they decided to hire the cook they think has
the finest reputation on campus Tommy himself.
When members planned their annual candlelight
Thanksgiving banquet, and told their cook to cook up a
storm, Tommy cooked his own goose. He didn't know that
the members planned to surprise him with a gold watch, a
day off and loads and loads of thanks.
The dinner appeared, as planned: a golden roast turkey,
succulent roast beef, crisp green salad, hot buttered rolls,
chilled red and white wines and the dessert flaming
cherries jubilee.
At 6:47 p.m. Tommy appeared at the dining room
entrance carrying the cherries jubilee fresh from the oven,
set the platter down, doused it with cognac, struck a match
to it. Ahhh, the crowd went wild.

They cheered, got up from their seats and applauded.
The proud but humble cook looked away from his fans,
raised his right hand in thanks and retreated back to the
kitchen.
Minutes later, a club member brought Tommy back into
the dining room and led him to a seat of honor at the head
table. Someone clanked a glass and the room grew silent.
Club Manager Michael Best stood up and said, "Tonight
is a very special night because 40 years ago David Thomas,
better known to us as 'Tommy,' first started working here
at Stanford."
According to Best, Tommy is well-known for his
"mischievous character" in the 30s his favorite hobby
was "nudging" the bumpers of cars stopped in front of him
at stop signs and for his generosity. When one of his
"boys" needed money for a plane ticket to New York,
Tommy bought it for him and "sent him on his way."
Pranksters frequently invaded Tommy's kitchen when he
cooked at the Delta Chi fraternity. Jokesters once stuffed
limburger cheese into every crack in the room and the
smell lingered for four days. One morning, Tommy arrived
to prepare a weekend breakfast and found the tables set
out in the middle of Lake Lagunita.
"He brought a little bit of home into our otherwise drab
college life," said Kirk Duncan, El Toro president. "It's
hard to put feelings into words," Duncan added.
But Tommy said it best. "It's been just like a family
with my boys" over the years, he said teary-eyed. "I'll
always keep you in my mind as long as I live."
Although Tommy has no real children of his own, he
says that he and his wife Zenobia talk about "the kids
here" as if they were their own.

OUT OF THE KITCHEN—During 40 years of cooking at Stanford, El Toro Eating Club Cook David "Tommy" Thomas
(right) has provided his 4000 "sons" with good fun and good food. When Tommy attended a fraternity party in 1935, he
noticed that the women were outdancing the fratmen. In an attempt to improve their style, he demonstrated the "big
apple" and the "black bottom." Last night, he received a standing ovation from El Toro officers Carl Dalton, Jim Noonan
and Kirk Duncan (left to right) and 96 other "sons."
