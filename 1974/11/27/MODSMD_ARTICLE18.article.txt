# From Undergraduate Involvement To University Administration
## Dale Snape: A Helpful-But ‘Shaggy’--Man For All Ages 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Dale Snape is a man for all ages. As*
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and a
student adviser, he deals with everyone
from the shyest young freshman to
Dean of Students James Lyons. Judging
from their response, Snape gets along
with almost everyone.
"He's one of those people who is
comfortable to speak to right after first
impression," says one student. "And
he's always responsive and helpful."
"He's as sweet as a jelly donut," says
another.
Sitting behind his desk in Tresidder
Union with a phone in his ear and a
hand in the faculty or student
directory, Snape looks like a very busy
' man, and he is.
In a typical day, he advises three
students on class schedules, answers
calls from irate students and guests
wanting to know the location of an
unpublicized meeting, answers ASSU
representatives' questions on University
policy and writes recommendations for
Dean Lyons on anything from budget
cuts to adding a new student bus
service.
'Student Advocate'
"He's not the most powerful
administrator," says ASSU President
, Mike Hernian, "But he's certainly the
most helpful. Not a day goes by when
someone at the ASSU doesn't ask his

advice. He's more than most
administrators, an invaluable resource
and a student advocate."
But Snape, a heavy-set, cheerful
man, also works well with the older
generation.
"Dale is the oldest young man I
know," says Assoc. Dean of Students
Daniel Williams who works with Snape
almost every day. "Dale has always
been pretty mature and the impression
one gets is he's older than he is. This is a
real plus when he deals with University
officials and alumni."
Guessing Game
Trying to guess his age from his
appearance is not easy. His brown suede
jacket, well-pressed blue slacks, clean,
polished shoes and wide tie give the
impression that he's at least 30. That
full beard hiding his baby face, and
those gold-rimmed glasses hiding his
squinty eyes don't help either.
His pink shirt and Mickey Mouse
watch are the only hints that he's not as
old as he looks.
"I guess it's my tough lower
middle-class upbringing that made me
age so fast," jokes Snape, who is only
24.
Snape grew up'in Rockville, Conn., a
place he descirbes as "an old mill town
that's gone down the drain. They've
even torn down the old mill."
Later he attended Pomfret, a private

boarding school near Hartford, on a full
scholarship. He didn't have a full beard
then, but hie did have a desire to learn
that pushed him through high school
with an 'A' average and into Stanford
on a full scholarship in 1968.
Snape lived in Branner during his
freshman year. He had his first run-in
with the administration when he had to
pay extra rent for living in the dorms
during Christmas break. Snape said he
didn't have enough money to go home.
He worked to pay the extra dorm fees.
"I remember I thought they were
completely inane at the time," Snape
says with a smile. "The whole situation
drove me up the wall."
Snape lived in Grove (now
Columbae) House as a sophomore, and
was a Resident Associate (R.A.) in
Arroyo as a junior and senior.
'ln The Movement'
"Like everyone else, I was caught up
in the movement against U.S. military
involvement in Southeast Asia," Snape
recalls.
As a student, Snape worked on many
University committees including one on
residents and one on fraternities.
Through these committees, he met
many University staff and faculty.
Perhaps his biggest contribution to
the University was his work on The
Bridge, a non-profit personal crisis
center. The Bridge was originally

organized to help students with drug
problems and to provide peer
counseling, Snape says.
In his senior year, Snape won the
Dinkelspiel Award for his work on The
Bridge and his job as an R.A. He
graduated with a B.A. in psychology in
1972.
Surprising Transition
In his tattered blue jeans, beard and
long wild hair held in place with a
bright red headband, undergraduate
Snape didn't look like he'd eVer become
a University administrator. But Williams
hired him to be a liaison between
students and the University the summer
after he graduated.
Snape says, "I started wearing ties so
people could tell me from the
students."
"He's cleaned up his act a lot since
the old days," says Williams about
Snape's appearance. "But I still think of
him as a bit shaggy."
Shaggy or not, Snape will keep his
current job until sometime this summer.
Next fall he hopes to begin graduate
business school at Harvard, Stanford or
UCLA.
When it's all over, he'll probably be
sad to leave.
"Sure, just like any organization it
[the University] has its own
doublethink and inertia," he says, "but
we do get a lot done even though
sometimes I'm not sure how."

TRANSITION—Imagining Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Dale Snape in the
tattered jeans and the red headband of his Stanford undergraduate days doesn't
make guessing how old he is any easier. Snape, 24, will leave his post next
summer and begin graduate business studies.
