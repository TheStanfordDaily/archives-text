# Endowed Chairs Ease Faculty Money Woes
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS Last Of Two Parts 
If you happen to have an extra
million dollars, don't be surprised if
the University asks you to endow a
faculty chair.
Endowment of faculty chairs is a
major source of University income
and provides long-term financial
support for distinguished faculty
members. The administration
contends chair endowments provide
some relief from the threats of
faculty quality and quantity posed
by the University's growing operating
deficit.
According to Robert Augsburger,
vice president for business and
finance, inflation has cut severely
into chair endowments. But he added
that "moderately conservative"
investment policies have spared the
University the brunt of* the stock
market decline.
Augsburger explained that the
nation's recent 12 percent inflation
rate has wiped out gains made by
endowment investments, which only
average a 10 percent rate of return.
Successful Campaign
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for planning, said the
five-year, $3OO million Campaign For
Stanford has been reasonably
successful in obtaining new endowed
chairs.
"We went into the campaign two
and a half years ago with only 50
chairs for 700 tenured faculty
members," Cuthbertson noted. "Now
we have 83."
The Campaign For Stanford set
$42 million as its goal for endowed
chairs, Cuthbertson said. The
University is currently approximately
on schedule, having collected half
that amount.
Cuthbertson explained that the
University requires between
$600,000 and $1.25 million to

endow a chair.
Endowment of a professor already 1
at Stanford, teaching in a field |
requiring few supplementary |
materials, costs only about $600,000, f
Cuthbertson explained. But I
endowment of a new professor in a|
field requiring expensive new \
' laboratory equipment or library ยง
books costs up to $1.25 million.
"We're still relatively |
unendowed," Cuthbertson declared.|
"We built a quality faculty here withf
the hope and expectation that we 1
could raise the money later. We've |
been able to provide adequate 1
financial support for the faculty, but |
we can always use more f
endowments."
Cuthbertson said ideally, all of the f
University's tenured professors |
should have endowed chairs.
But James Miller, financial |
director of the Graduate School of|
Business, said that he sees endowed |
chairs as a special reward to be |
granted only to the most |
distinguished faculty members.*
Recruitment Factor
Miller emphasized, however, that |
the Business School can always use |
more money for faculty salaries.
Miller said that endowment of
chairs has "definitely improved the |
quality of the faculty here."
Both Miller and Cuthbertson j
noted that the Business School has |
been extremely successful in j
endowing chairs. Miller attributed I
much of the success to the work of;
Arjay Miller, dean of the Business \
School.
"Arjay used to be on Board off
Directors of the Ford Corp. so he:
uses his professional contacts to |
attract the top people," Miller |
explained.
Cuthbertson said he is surprised ;j
that the School of Engineering has \
only three endowed faculty positions,
considering the academic quality of
that school.
Engineering Dean William Kays said
lack of endowed chairs hasn't had
much impact on the budget. "Perhaps
they have some small impact," he
conceded.
Kays explained it doesn't matter
much whether the school receives
general funds to be allocated to
faculty salaries or whether it gets
endowed chairs.
But Cuthbertson claihied that the
chance to endow chairs encourages
some people to contribute money who
otherwise would not have donated
such large amounts.
Featured In Campaign
"We strongly encourage potential
donors to make their gifts in the form
of faculty endowments," Cuthbertson
said. "We have particularly featured
faculty chairs in the Campaign For
Stanford."
According to Cuthbertson, most
people who choose to endow chairs
know in what field of study they wish

to endow a professorship.
Cuthbertson noted, however, that
the University tries to dissuade
potential donors from restricting their
endowment to an extremely narrow
area of study.
If a gift is too specific in its terms, a
vacancy is hard to fill, he explained.
Faculty endowment funds are
rarely segregated from other
University monies, according to
Augsburger.
Few New Appointments
With University finances strained,
administrators on all levels emphasized
that they prefer to endow professors
already here rather than make a new
appointment.
Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost
for faculty affairs, pointed out that
the University is creating few new
faculty positions.
Bienenstock said there will be few
openings for new faculty members
until 1982-83 when many professors
will retire.
Although Bienenstock said he isn't
worried that the University will have

difficulty finding equally talented
people to replace the retirees, he
lamented the University's inability to
hire many new faculty members until
then.
Academic Depression
"What worries me is that the
academic depression could produce a
generation of young professors who
will not be able to work with the
greats in their fields," Bienenstock
said. "Being close to senior faculty
members plays a significant role in
intellectual development.
"Since we anticipate fewer
appointments for a long while,
talented professors will go to
institutions where they won't be
challenged by leaders in their
professions."
But several administrators all of
whom requested anonymity said
that the University's current
retirement plan encourages early
retirement among less distinguished
faculty (i.e. those with lower salaries).
By offering such incentives, the
University hopes to open many faculty
positions during the next few years.
Administrators generally are
confident that despite the financial
woes, the University can maintain
faculty quality even though
faculty size will remain static.
Cuthbertson noted that the
University still follows the basic policy
laid down during the 1950s by then
President Wallace Sterling.
"Sterling used to say that if we
could get a first-rate faculty and
student body, the necessary money
would follow," Cuthbertson said.
"That policy has worked in the past
and we're convinced that it still can
work."
