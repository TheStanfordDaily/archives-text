# Endowed Chairs Ease Faculty Money Woes
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS Last Of Two Parts 
If you happen to have an extra
million dollars, don't be surprised if
the University asks you to endow a
faculty chair.
Endowment of faculty chairs is a
major source of University income
and provides long-term financial
support for distinguished faculty
members. The administration
contends chair endowments provide
some relief from the threats of
faculty quality and quantity posed
by the University's growing operating
deficit.
According to Robert Augsburger,
vice president for business and
finance, inflation has cut severely
into chair endowments. But he added
that "moderately conservative"
investment policies have spared the
University the brunt of* the stock
market decline.
Augsburger explained that the
nation's recent 12 percent inflation
rate has wiped out gains made by
endowment investments, which only
average a 10 percent rate of return.
Successful Campaign
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for planning, said the
five-year, $3OO million Campaign For
Stanford has been reasonably
successful in obtaining new endowed
chairs.
"We went into the campaign two
and a half years ago with only 50
chairs for 700 tenured faculty
members," Cuthbertson noted. "Now
we have 83."
The Campaign For Stanford set
$42 million as its goal for endowed
chairs, Cuthbertson said. The
University is currently approximately
on schedule, having collected half
that amount.
Cuthbertson explained that the
University requires between
$600,000 and $1.25 million to

endow a chair.
Endowment of a professor already 1
at Stanford, teaching in a field |
requiring few supplementary |
materials, costs only about $600,000, f
Cuthbertson explained. But I
endowment of a new professor in a|
field requiring expensive new \
' laboratory equipment or library §
books costs up to $1.25 million.
"We're still relatively |
unendowed," Cuthbertson declared.|
"We built a quality faculty here withf
the hope and expectation that we 1
could raise the money later. We've |
been able to provide adequate 1
financial support for the faculty, but |
we can always use more f
endowments."
Cuthbertson said ideally, all of the f
University's tenured professors |
should have endowed chairs.
But James Miller, financial |
director of the Graduate School of|
Business, said that he sees endowed |
chairs as a special reward to be |
granted only to the most |
distinguished faculty members.*
Recruitment Factor
Miller emphasized, however, that |
the Business School can always use |
more money for faculty salaries.
Miller said that endowment of
chairs has "definitely improved the |
quality of the faculty here."
Both Miller and Cuthbertson j
noted that the Business School has |
been extremely successful in j
endowing chairs. Miller attributed I
much of the success to the work of;
Arjay Miller, dean of the Business \
School.
"Arjay used to be on Board off
Directors of the Ford Corp. so he:
uses his professional contacts to |
attract the top people," Miller |
explained.
Cuthbertson said he is surprised ;j
that the School of Engineering has \
