# ‘Stop Arms Race,’ Retired Admiral Says
## 
### GORDON FIRESTEIN 
"We have to stop this senseless arms race
that we're involved in," retired Rear Adm.
Gene Laßocque said Monday night. "The
U.S. turns to military solutions for
foreign-policy problems. I see it everywhere,
and I'm horrified."
Laßocque, speaking to about 60 persons
in Tresidder Large Lounge, said the U.S. "has
been at war for 30 years, and that's really
been our foreign policy... But it's stupid to
use war to settle our differences. It only
makes things worse."
"On the other hand," he added, "We need
a strong defense. But we've got four times
what we need."
This year's defense budget of $B2 billion
is "the largest in history," Laßocque said,
"and it's $8 billion larger than last year. The
Pentagon is putting together the most
massive campaign in history to convince
Americans that, despite inflation, this
defense expenditure is necessary."
'Awful Lot of Waste'
The defense budget represents "an awful
lot of waste," he said. "We are the most
powerful nation in the world, yet every year
we get more and more afraid. We compensate
for this fear by adding more and more
weapons to our arsenal."
Laßocque suggested several ways to
demilitarize U.S. foreign policy. "First, stop
assuming the military is a sacred cow,"
Laßocque said. "The way things are these
days, if you are in any way critical of the
Pentagon, you're being disloyal. That's
ridiculous."
The audience applauded when Laßocque
suggested that the "U.S. stop all military

assistance today to military dictators. It
wouldn't hurt our defense one iota."
Laßocque said the U.S. gives military aid
to 64 countries, 26 of them run by dictators.
This assistance is "very insidious," he said,
"and it's going to get worse because we
found we could make a profit doing it. It's
very good for the balance of payments. The
fact that it also kills people and starts wars
has just been forgotten."
Bring Troops Home
Laßocque also suggested that the U.S.
bring all of its troops home from Asia and

reduce the number of troops in Europe. The
U.S. has 27,000 soldiers stationed in
Thailand alone, Laßocque said. And we
could easily bring home 10 percent of the
300,000 U.S. troops in Europe wihtout
"destabilizing" conditions there.
Ideally, Laßocque said, he would like
Congress to cut the defense budget, "But
that would be impractical. It can't be done
overnight," he said, noting long-term
contracts that can't be broken.
"Just don't give them any more,"
Laßocque suggested. "Hold them at the
present level for five years, and let inflation
at 10 to 12 percent a year give them that
much of a cut."
Strong Posture
Laßocque said the U.S. should maintain
"a strong defense posture," but that there is
no need for "the gun-boat diplomacy of the
past to get our way." As it is, Laßocque said,
"we have, without any doubt whatsoever, the
most modern, most powerful navy in the
world."
Laßocque retired from the Navy in 1972.
He became "disenchanted" with the military
during the Korean war, but he said the
Vietnam war "really turned me off.
"Let's not kid ourselves," he said, "our
job in the military is to kill and destroy.
That's what our profession is all about."
Laßocque founded the Center for Defense
Information in Washington, D.C. after he
retired from military service. The center
analyses the defense budget, Laßocque said,
and tries to "ferret out the important issues
and make them evident to members of
Congress."
