## Lou Reed No Letdown 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
SAN FRANCISCO -
Concert-goers anticipating a
bizarre evening at Winterland
Friday night were far from
disappointed.
Lou Reed's music embodied
several types of rock and roll as he
razzled, dazzled, taunted and
challenged the audience with
theatrics in the true style of a
master performer.
The band opened with the
introduction to "Sweet Jane," a
hard-driving tune with heavy
metal guitar leads characteristic of
the Rock N Roll Animal album.
Crowd pitch reached a frenzy
when Lou lept onstage and belted
out the first lines dressed like a
'sos rock star in tight blue jeans
and T-shirt, with huge dark glasses
obscuring his face.
He broke into the famous
"Vicious" and then did two
compositions from his new
album: the title song "Sally Can't
Dance" and "Animal Language,"
which emphasize keyboard over
guitar and are more softly
rhythmic and funky than much of
his earlier material. 1
Step And Jive
During "Walk on the Wild
Side," which lacked the usual
brass accompaniment as well as
The Thunder Thighs on back-up
vocals, Reed stepped and jived
animatedly across the stage,
requesting that the crowd join in
on the chorus. When the band
launched into "White Light/White
Heat," he threw off his shades,
turned around, and wiggled his ass
suggestively at a delighted
audience.
Both the lead guitarist's
impressive, clean tones, which hit
every note without a trace of slur,
and the drummer's distinctive,
crisp beat supplied spectacular
accompaniment. The spirited
inflections of Prakash John's bass

were outstanding, especially on
"Walk on the Wild Side."
The domineering quality of
Lou Reed's smooth voice (often
described as a "monotone")
consists in his speaking rather
than singing his songs. His
execution borders on narration.
Monotone Essential
This is essential to Reed's
delivery, for his lyrics display a
relevatory synthesis of deeply
personal experiences, and this
narrative style sucks the listener
directly into the middle of his
mysterious psyche. Grabbing mike
stands and flinging them on the
stage floor, whirling his arms
around in the air, and
gesticulating wildly at the crowd,
he exhorted us to listen to his
forceful epic "Heroin," a
composition from the late 60s
when Reed was with Andy
Warhol's Velvet Underground:
"Heroin be the death of me
It's my wife, it's my life
I'm better off dead
When the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care
anymore"
Meanwhile Reed, defiantly facing
the crowd, wrapped the
microphone cord around his bare
arm and poked a syringe into one
of his veins.
Throughout his lyrics Reed
explored controversial themes,
heavily concentrating on drugs as
well as transvestism,
homosexuality, insanity and
death. Not surprisingly, Reed has
stated in interviews that he is a
transvestite and that he also
spends most of his money on
drugs. During "Kill Your Sons" he
warned of "two-bit psychiatrists
giving out electroshock" and "all
the drugs we took, it really was
lots of fun shoot me up with
Thorazine and crystal smoke" but

adds "Don't you know they're
gonna kill your sons?"
Second billing for the evening
featured Love, a predominantly
black group formed about three
months ago. Band leader Arthur
Lee dates back to the sixties when
his song "Little Red Book" soared
to the top of AM radio charts. His
most recent material such as
"Love is Like a River" and "You
Make Me Happy" sounds
somewhat Hendrix-influenced.
Lee's dominating vocals and
wailing 'flying V' guitar produce a
pleasing style, but the band
generally suffers from lack of
good composing abilities thus far.
A local group named
Earthquake also appeared, playing
hard rock selections such as the
well-known "Friday on My
Mind," along with "Vargas Girl"
and "I'm Gonna Get You." Lead
singer John Doukas attempted an
imitation of Peter Wolfe of the J.
Geils Band, but his voice often
seemed too harsh, and his style,
although dynamic, became
monotonous as the set wore on.

'sos rock star in tight blue jeans
and T-shirt, with huge dark glasses
obscuring his face.
He broke into the famous
"Vicious" and then did two
compositions from his new
album: the title song "Sally Can't
Dance" and "Animal Language,"
which emphasize keyboard over
guitar and are more softly
rhythmic and funky than much of
his earlier material. 1
Step And Jive
During "Walk on the Wild
Side," which lacked the usual
brass accompaniment as well as
The Thunder Thighs on back-up
vocals, Reed stepped and jived
animatedly across the stage,
requesting that the crowd join in
on the chorus. When the band
launched into "White Light/White
Heat," he threw off his shades,
turned around, and wiggled his ass
suggestively at a delighted
audience.
Both the lead guitarist's
impressive, clean tones, which hit
every note without a trace of slur,
and the drummer's distinctive,
crisp beat supplied spectacular
accompaniment. The spirited
inflections of Prakash John's bass

were outstanding, especially on
"Walk on the Wild Side."
The domineering quality of
Lou Reed's smooth voice (often
described as a "monotone")
consists in his speaking rather
than singing his songs. His
execution borders on narration.
Monotone Essential
This is essential to Reed's
delivery, for his lyrics display a
relevatory synthesis of deeply
personal experiences, and this
narrative style sucks the listener
directly into the middle of his
mysterious psyche. Grabbing mike
stands and flinging them on the
stage floor, whirling his arms
around in the air, and
gesticulating wildly at the crowd,
he exhorted us to listen to his
forceful epic "Heroin," a
composition from the late 60s
when Reed was with Andy
Warhol's Velvet Underground:
"Heroin be the death of me
It's my wife, it's my life
I'm better off dead
When the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care
anymore"
Meanwhile Reed, defiantly facing
the crowd, wrapped the
microphone cord around his bare
arm and poked a syringe into one
of his veins.
Throughout his lyrics Reed
explored controversial themes,
heavily concentrating on drugs as
well as transvestism,
homosexuality, insanity and
death. Not surprisingly, Reed has
stated in interviews that he is a
transvestite and that he also
spends most of his money on
drugs. During "Kill Your Sons" he
warned of "two-bit psychiatrists
giving out electroshock" and "all
the drugs we took, it really was
lots of fun shoot me up with
Thorazine and crystal smoke" but

adds "Don't you know they're
gonna kill your sons?"
Second billing for the evening
featured Love, a predominantly
black group formed about three
months ago. Band leader Arthur
Lee dates back to the sixties when
his song "Little Red Book" soared
to the top of AM radio charts. His
most recent material such as
"Love is Like a River" and "You
Make Me Happy" sounds
somewhat Hendrix-influenced.
Lee's dominating vocals and
wailing 'flying V' guitar produce a
pleasing style, but the band
generally suffers from lack of
good composing abilities thus far.
A local group named
Earthquake also appeared, playing
hard rock selections such as the
well-known "Friday on My
Mind," along with "Vargas Girl"
and "I'm Gonna Get You." Lead
singer John Doukas attempted an
imitation of Peter Wolfe of the J.
Geils Band, but his voice often
seemed too harsh, and his style,
although dynamic, became
monotonous as the set wore on.

PETERED OUT Pacific Ballet's performance of Peter Pan didn't
quite hit the mark. John Pasqualetti's version of Peter Pan was unique,
but maybe too unique for ballet.
SAN FRANCISCO -
Concert-goers anticipating a
bizarre evening at Winterland
Friday night were far from
disappointed.
Lou Reed's music embodied
several types of rock and roll as he
razzled, dazzled, taunted and
challenged the audience with
theatrics in the true style of a
master performer.
The band opened with the
introduction to "Sweet Jane," a
hard-driving tune with heavy
metal guitar leads characteristic of
the Rock N Roll Animal album.

requesting that the crowd join in
on the chorus. When the band
launched into "White Light/White
Heat," he threw off his shades,
turned around, and wiggled his ass
suggestively at a delighted
audience.
Both the lead guitarist's
impressive, clean tones, which hit
every note without a trace of slur,
and the drummer's distinctive,
crisp beat supplied spectacular
accompaniment. The spirited
inflections of Prakash John's bass

were outstanding, especially on
"Walk on the Wild Side."
The domineering quality of
Lou Reed's smooth voice (often
described as a "monotone")
consists in his speaking rather
than singing his songs. His
execution borders on narration.
Monotone Essential
This is essential to Reed's
delivery, for his lyrics display a
relevatory synthesis of deeply
personal experiences, and this
narrative style sucks the listener
directly into the middle of his
mysterious psyche. Grabbing mike
stands and flinging them on the
stage floor, whirling his arms
around in the air, and
gesticulating wildly at the crowd,
he exhorted us to listen to his
forceful epic "Heroin," a
composition from the late 60s
when Reed was with Andy
Warhol's Velvet Underground:
"Heroin be the death of me
It's my wife, it's my life
I'm better off dead
When the smack begins to flow
And I really don't care
anymore"
Meanwhile Reed, defiantly facing
the crowd, wrapped the
microphone cord around his bare
arm and poked a syringe into one
of his veins.
Throughout his lyrics Reed
explored controversial themes,
heavily concentrating on drugs as
well as transvestism,
homosexuality, insanity and
death. Not surprisingly, Reed has
stated in interviews that he is a
transvestite and that he also
spends most of his money on
drugs. During "Kill Your Sons" he
warned of "two-bit psychiatrists
giving out electroshock" and "all
the drugs we took, it really was
lots of fun shoot me up with
Thorazine and crystal smoke" but

adds "Don't you know they're
gonna kill your sons?"
Second billing for the evening
featured Love, a predominantly
black group formed about three
months ago. Band leader Arthur
Lee dates back to the sixties when
his song "Little Red Book" soared
to the top of AM radio charts. His
most recent material such as
"Love is Like a River" and "You
Make Me Happy" sounds
somewhat Hendrix-influenced.
Lee's dominating vocals and
wailing 'flying V' guitar produce a
pleasing style, but the band
generally suffers from lack of
good composing abilities thus far.
A local group named
Earthquake also appeared, playing
hard rock selections such as the
well-known "Friday on My
Mind," along with "Vargas Girl"
and "I'm Gonna Get You." Lead
singer John Doukas attempted an
imitation of Peter Wolfe of the J.
Geils Band, but his voice often
seemed too harsh, and his style,
although dynamic, became
monotonous as the set wore on.

PETERED OUT Pacific Ballet's performance of Peter Pan didn't
quite hit the mark. John Pasqualetti's version of Peter Pan was unique,
but maybe too unique for ballet.
