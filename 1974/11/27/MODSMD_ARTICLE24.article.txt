# Star ship Delivers Good Show
## 
### ALDEN MARIN 
SAN FRANCISCO When Kansas' singer and
violin player announced to a packed Saturday night
crowd at Winterland that "I'm gonna bring ya back
some smoke from Mexico," the capacity crowd
erupted in stomping, screaming enthusiasm, a
characteristic feature of the evening's show headed
by The Jefferson Starship.
Kansas, a midwestern band whose five members
must weigh in excess of one ton, layed down
surprisingly dynamic, tight hard rock for an entire
45 minute opener set, featuring such numbers as
"The Murder of Mother Nature." Unusually
high-energy for an opening act, Kansas avoided
most rock cliches, itl an impressive, crowd-pleasing
set which gained them an encore.
Video tapes of former Winterland shows
entertained the masses who anxiously awaited "the
legendary Blue Oyster Cult," a New York
"decadence rock" band, akin to the New York
Dolls. Critics nationwide have heralded the Cult as
"saviors of hard rock."
As the Cult members stepped onstage for their
first West Coast appearance, the Frisco audience
went wild as the band ripped into "Stairway to the
Stars," a cut from their first album. Fires flashed
atop the sound system as the black and white clad
rockers blasted the audience with very loud,
remarkably tight numbers.
Strange Lyrics
The evening continued to provide interesting
quotes as Eric Bloom, the glitter and sunglasses
adorned lead singer of the Cult shreiked in gutteral
tones such lyrics as "I got prison in ma veins."
Veterans of three critically acclaimed albums,
the Cult rocked through an hour and a half
repertoire, highlighted by the dazzling lead guitar
riffs of Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser, a talented
picker who calmly proceeded to lace burning leads
into his band's music pushing the hoardes into

frenzy. Band members demonstrated versatility as
they doubled on keyboards and synthesizers. Even
the drummer twirls his sticks with finesse. At one
point, all five members of the band, each equipped
with a guitar, participated in a strange, ear-splitting
ritual five dueling electric guitars. The Cult
encored with Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild," a
song appropriately suited to the band's nature.
Juggling Exhibition
Preceeding Jefferson Starship's entrance, a
juggler who treated knives and sickles like oranges,
dazzled the audience. The juggler even ate an apple
bite by bite while flipping blades through the air.
Jefferson Starship, featuring Grace Slick, landed
onstage to perform a well-received hour and a half
set which included such cuts as "Have You Seen
The Stars Tonight?" and "Wooden Ships." Grace
Slick, despite traditionally pleasing vocals, has
gained a noticable amount of weight and would
seem to be filling the role of a new Mama Cass.
Known for biting political lyrics, images of
future starships traveling to the sun, and
communings with pumpkins onstage, Slick treated
the crowd to some enlightening advice mid-way
through a song, as she suggested "you girls should
go down on that young man next to you." A
strange surprise occurred when Marty Balin, former
Jefferson Airplane member, appeared onstage at
Slick's summoning to help her sing a tune.
Balin sported a short, styled haircut and a
sportcoat, and sang as though he were part of a Las
Vegas casino act. The Starship, highlighted by such
well-knowns as lead guitarist Paul Kantner and
keyboardist David Freeburg, sailed on to an encore
which featured "Volunteers ( of Amerika,"
-performed with the house lights on. The
illuminated masses pulsated to a revival of the late
sixties' spirit. Light shows and revolutions had
returned for an evening anyway.

set which gained them an encore.
Video tapes of former Winterland shows
entertained the masses who anxiously awaited "the
legendary Blue Oyster Cult," a New York
"decadence rock" band, akin to the New York
Dolls. Critics nationwide have heralded the Cult as
"saviors of hard rock."
As the Cult members stepped onstage for their
first West Coast appearance, the Frisco audience
went wild as the band ripped into "Stairway to the
Stars," a cut from their first album. Fires flashed
atop the sound system as the black and white clad
rockers blasted the audience with very loud,
remarkably tight numbers.
Strange Lyrics
The evening continued to provide interesting
quotes as Eric Bloom, the glitter and sunglasses
adorned lead singer of the Cult shreiked in gutteral
tones such lyrics as "I got prison in ma veins."
Veterans of three critically acclaimed albums,
the Cult rocked through an hour and a half
repertoire, highlighted by the dazzling lead guitar
riffs of Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser, a talented
picker who calmly proceeded to lace burning leads
into his band's music pushing the hoardes into

frenzy. Band members demonstrated versatility as
they doubled on keyboards and synthesizers. Even
the drummer twirls his sticks with finesse. At one
point, all five members of the band, each equipped
with a guitar, participated in a strange, ear-splitting
ritual five dueling electric guitars. The Cult
encored with Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild," a
song appropriately suited to the band's nature.
Juggling Exhibition
Preceeding Jefferson Starship's entrance, a
juggler who treated knives and sickles like oranges,
dazzled the audience. The juggler even ate an apple
bite by bite while flipping blades through the air.
Jefferson Starship, featuring Grace Slick, landed
onstage to perform a well-received hour and a half
set which included such cuts as "Have You Seen
The Stars Tonight?" and "Wooden Ships." Grace
Slick, despite traditionally pleasing vocals, has
gained a noticable amount of weight and would
seem to be filling the role of a new Mama Cass.
Known for biting political lyrics, images of
future starships traveling to the sun, and
communings with pumpkins onstage, Slick treated
the crowd to some enlightening advice mid-way
through a song, as she suggested "you girls should
go down on that young man next to you." A
strange surprise occurred when Marty Balin, former
Jefferson Airplane member, appeared onstage at
Slick's summoning to help her sing a tune.
Balin sported a short, styled haircut and a
sportcoat, and sang as though he were part of a Las
Vegas casino act. The Starship, highlighted by such
well-knowns as lead guitarist Paul Kantner and
keyboardist David Freeburg, sailed on to an encore
which featured "Volunteers ( of Amerika,"
-performed with the house lights on. The
illuminated masses pulsated to a revival of the late
sixties' spirit. Light shows and revolutions had
returned for an evening anyway.
SAN FRANCISCO When Kansas' singer and
violin player announced to a packed Saturday night
crowd at Winterland that "I'm gonna bring ya back
some smoke from Mexico," the capacity crowd
erupted in stomping, screaming enthusiasm, a
characteristic feature of the evening's show headed
by The Jefferson Starship.
Kansas, a midwestern band whose five members
must weigh in excess of one ton, layed down
surprisingly dynamic, tight hard rock for an entire
45 minute opener set, featuring such numbers as
"The Murder of Mother Nature." Unusually
high-energy for an opening act, Kansas avoided
most rock cliches, itl an impressive, crowd-pleasing
set which gained them an encore.
