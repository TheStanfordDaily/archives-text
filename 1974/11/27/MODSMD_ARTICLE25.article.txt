# ‘Peter’ Gets Panned

### SHERIDAN CRAWFORD 
SAN FRANCISCO I'll take
Mary Martin strung up and sailing
skyward via the visible wire any
day.
Whereas I am willing to believe
in a Peter Pan who levitates with
the assistance of a few stagehands
and a song, John Pasqualetti's
ballet version of Peter Pan never
came close to simulating flight,
despite the potential that dance
embodies for making any
audience suspend its belief in
gravity.
Tinkerbell danced en pointe
was built in amazonian
proportions and portrayed as a
pouting vixen. Neither her
physique nor her dancing were
light and fairy-like as she
attempted to seduce Peter Pan.
Wendy was a little snob a
ballerina with her nose in the air.
And Peter Pan with hundreds of
little green aspen leaves glued to
his quite muscular body cavorted
gleefully, like a little boy lost in
space, but without the power to
make a Never-never land real or
convincing for John, Michael,
Wendy or the audience. Captain
Hook inspired not one ounce of
fear. Another problem in the
suspension of belief.
Writing about the Pacific
Ballet's Peter Pan is like trying to
reconstruct a bad dream. The
small stage in the Veteran's
Auditorium was continually
cluttered with bodies including
the inflexible ones of the two
narrators Francesca Howe and

William Ferriter. They assumed
every voice in the play, from Mr
and Mrs. Darling to Wendy to
Peter to Captain Hook. Except for
missing a line now and then and
speaking out of synch with the
dancers' silent mouthing of the
words (no dancer ever speaks)
they deserve a certain amount of
acclaim for having attempted to
tell the whole story with their
voices. At times it became quite
confusing for the viewer in trying
to decide who to listen to or
watch since the narrators'
dramatic abilities far exceeded
those of the dancers. The
continuity of the dance (and there
was so little sustained movement)
was disrupted by various speeches,
and the two actor's lines were
almost literally stepped on by
fairies and pirates and other
members of an assemblage who
crowded in on the stage.
This is a ballet company which
on Thursday night was both
sloppy and incoherent. Those are
harsh words, but if the story line
was so much more important than
the dance, the combined
movements of the company did
not relay the plot, and as my
friend next to me kept saying
"When is it ever going to begin?,"
we also wondered when it was
ever going to end.
Hopefully, in the future, the
Pacific Ballet can convert their
energies into a sustained dance
performance and leave the
dramatic interpretation to theatre
and the actors.
