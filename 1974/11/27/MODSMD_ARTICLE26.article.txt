# Toyon Play Good
## 
### DOUG BEDARD 
I will honor Christmas in my heart
and try to keep it all year!... A
Merry Christmas to everybody! A
Happy New Year to all the World!
—Ebeneezer Scrooge
Sound corny? Maybe. But
enough people were taken in by
the magic of A Christmas Carol to
pack the lounge of Toyon Hall
last Friday night, even though the
show faced tough competition
from the Bonfire and other
pre-Cal game activities.
Directed by Gioia Kelley, the
Toyon and Stanford Eating Clubs
presentation of the Charles
Dickens classic had as much
warmth as the fire which crackled
and glowed in Toyon's large
fireplace throughout the show.
The Narrator (Steve Pascal)
conveyed this warmth and served
as the play's link with the
audience.
Jeff Little's presentation of
Scrooge, highlighted by fine

makeup by Paul Edwards, was
consistently good, especially in his
vocal interpretation of the role.
The Narrator, Pascal, was
very personable and had excellent
rapport with the audience,
especially with those sitting
closest to the stage. A chorus of
Christmas carolers and Dennis
Berry's violin music during a party
scene added to the play's festive
mood.
Many of the actors played two
or more roles, which often led to
confusion between characters.
Especially good in two roles was
Dave Farris in the roles of
Scrooge's nephew Fred and
Young Scrooge.
Another problem the audience
faced was a difficulty in hearing
the actors at times, due both to
the acoustics of the lounge and
the cast's failure to speak clearly.
From a technical standpoint,
the show was tightly run. The
lighting design was well executed
by Katie Solow, and especially
noteworthy were the "color
temperature" changes Scrooge's
chambers looked and actually felt
cold when Marley's ghost entered.
The moans of Marley's ghost,
the jovial "Come in, man!" of the
Ghost of Christmas Present and
Tiny Tim's "God bless us all of
us every one" contributed to
the often corny but highly
warming magic that was Toyon's
A Christmas Carol.
I will honor Christmas in my heart
and try to keep it all year!... A
Merry Christmas to everybody! A
Happy New Year to all the World!
