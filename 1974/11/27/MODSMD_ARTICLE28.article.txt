# Ginsberg: Unique
## 
### PAUL YEUELL 
SAN FRANCISCO - Allen
Ginsberg's poetry readings are not
at all easy, family entertainment.
Even if you're right there with
him as he drags you through long,
long mantras or agonizingly
compelling odes to anal
intercourse, you don't walk out of
a Ginsberg reading without
shedding a drop or two of moral
sweat.
Maybe when you saw all the
crap in your life float by in the
heavy air above the poet's head,
you sweated a drop.
Or maybe you shed a drop
when he beckoned, pleaded,
implored you to come "fuck him
in the ass, long and hard."
Ginsberg read to about 500
people in a crowded dance studio
at the Lone Mountain College in
San Francisco last week.
In a two and a half hour
session, Ginsberg read material
spanning more than 15 years. His
readings ranged from scathing
blasts at Rockefeller and the CIA
to a mystical migration of mind
around the world.
Ginsberg has been an enigmatic
Figure in contemporary American
poetry for more than a decade.
His name has become associated
with the legends of Neal Cassady,
Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, Ken
Kesey and the Pranksters.
He has always spoken out
frankly and boldly, perenially
tongueing the unspeakable. His
readings have ' long had the
reputation of being events with

their own brand of magic.
This one at Lone Mountain was
no exception. He chanted
mantras, sang rags and ditties,
read straight verses and read
outrageous verse.
He began by telling everyone
to unbutton their pants, let their
stomachs sag, and breathe. Sitting
cross-legged on a fat pillow, he
began the single word
("Aaaaahhhh . . .") mantra,
accompanying himself on a hand
harmonium. The whole room
joined in.
After this warm-up, he read his
poetry, did a short set of songs
and then read more poems. One
poem read early in the evening, a
poem about the homosexual
fantasies evoked by an old set of
cushions that he slept on in New
York, drew nervous laughs.
Another, "Slave Master," most
assuredly made stomachs turn and
rectums twitch. This one dealt
explicitly with desperately painful
anal passion.
In others, he railed on Colby
and the CIA and Rockefeller the
"oil junkie." These were met with
cheers.
When the last mantra was over,
the event moved to another room
where the crowd, plied with wine
and a jazz orchestra, warmed up
to a slow boil.
Ginsberg, perhaps the
modern-day Walt Whitman, rolled
in and out, had involved
conversations with pretty young
men, and seemed not at all
impressed with himself.

to unbutton their pants, let their
stomachs sag, and breathe. Sitting
cross-legged on a fat pillow, he
began the single word
("Aaaaahhhh . . .") mantra,
accompanying himself on a hand
harmonium. The whole room
joined in.
After this warm-up, he read his
poetry, did a short set of songs
and then read more poems. One
poem read early in the evening, a
poem about the homosexual
fantasies evoked by an old set of
cushions that he slept on in New
York, drew nervous laughs.
Another, "Slave Master," most
assuredly made stomachs turn and
rectums twitch. This one dealt
explicitly with desperately painful
anal passion.
In others, he railed on Colby
and the CIA and Rockefeller the
"oil junkie." These were met with
cheers.

the event moved to another room

to a slow boil.
Ginsberg, perhaps the
modern-day Walt Whitman, rolled
in and out, had involved

SAN FRANCISCO - Allen
Ginsberg's poetry readings are not
at all easy, family entertainment.
Even if you're right there with
him as he drags you through long,
long mantras or agonizingly
compelling odes to anal
intercourse, you don't walk out of
a Ginsberg reading without
shedding a drop or two of moral
sweat.
Maybe when you saw all the
crap in your life float by in the
heavy air above the poet's head,
you sweated a drop.
Or maybe you shed a drop
when he beckoned, pleaded,
implored you to come "fuck him
in the ass, long and hard."
Ginsberg read to about 500
people in a crowded dance studio
at the Lone Mountain College in
San Francisco last week.
In a two and a half hour
session, Ginsberg read material
spanning more than 15 years. His
readings ranged from scathing
blasts at Rockefeller and the CIA
to a mystical migration of mind
around the world.
Ginsberg has been an enigmatic
Figure in contemporary American
poetry for more than a decade.
His name has become associated
with the legends of Neal Cassady,
Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, Ken
Kesey and the Pranksters.
He has always spoken out
frankly and boldly, perenially
tongueing the unspeakable. His
readings have ' long had the
reputation of being events with

their own brand of magic.
This one at Lone Mountain was
no exception. He chanted
mantras, sang rags and ditties,
read straight verses and read
outrageous verse.
He began by telling everyone
to unbutton their pants, let their
stomachs sag, and breathe. Sitting
cross-legged on a fat pillow, he
began the single word
