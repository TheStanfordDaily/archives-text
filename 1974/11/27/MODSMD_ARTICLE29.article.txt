## Swimmers Expect Improved Record 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The Stanford swim team posted an impressive 7-1 record last year,
and placed sixth in the NCAA championships. And coach Jim
Gaughran thinks the Cards can do even better this season.
"USC and Indiana are probably the best two teams in the nation,"
Gaughran explained, but "it will be a real battle for third between
UCLA, Washington, Tennessee and us."
Stanford opens its season this weekend at the DeGuerre pools in
the Northern California Invitational, and Gaughran will display a
squad that should swim the socks off the other teams competing.
(UOP, Cal, and the Lodi, Arden Hills and Concord Swim Clubs.)
"Our only problem is depth, really," Gaughran said, "at least in
comparison to a team like SC or Indiana... For the first time, we've
got more than just one good swimmer in every event. With some good
performances we should be able to beat UCLA and Washington."
Only Two Vacancies
All but two members of last year's team are returning this year
(Martin Pedley and Terry Sutton graduated), and Gaughran's
determined recruiting efforts have added 13 freshmen to the squad.
Foremost among the returning swimmers is junior John Hencken,
who holds world records in the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke and is

the current NCAA 200
breaststroke champion. He is
joined by Ail-Americans Dean
Anderson, Randy Whitchurch,
Bruce Goodwin, Brian Roux and
Dave Fairbank.
Mike Bruner, who holds the
American record in the 1650
meter freestyle and is the 1974
AAU champion in that event,
leads a freshman contingent of
Stu Corliss, Chris Whalen, Matt
Sullivan, Jack Connelly, Mark
McDonagh, Rick Johanssen, Hugh
Kuhn, Bill Chao and Brent Smith.
Bruner, 1973 All-American
Steve Strong, and juniors Craig
Van Zandt, Richard Cook, Ron
Longinotti and Paul Clark should
give the Cards strength in middle
and long distance events.
New Dimension
Bruner "adds a whole new
dimension to our program,"
Gaughran said, and predicted "a
new Stanford record in the 500
and 1000 [meter freestyle] in this
weekend's meet."

Whalen back-up Hencken in the
breaststroke.
Diving coach Clyde Devine will
have four returning sophomores in
Wayne Wager, who qualified for
the NCAAs last season, Diane
Campbell, Tom Pedreira and Jill
Ward. They are joined by
freshmen Craig Olson, Steve
Powell and Jim Jett.
Admission to the NorCal
Invitational this weekend is free,
and because there will be a
shortage of timers Gaughran urges
students staying on campus to
come out and help. The meet will
begin Friday at 2:30 p.m. and
resume Saturday at 10 a.m.

comparison to a team like SC or Indiana... For the first time, we've
got more than just one good swimmer in every event. With some good
performances we should be able to beat UCLA and Washington."
Only Two Vacancies
All but two members of last year's team are returning this year
(Martin Pedley and Terry Sutton graduated), and Gaughran's
determined recruiting efforts have added 13 freshmen to the squad.
Foremost among the returning swimmers is junior John Hencken,
who holds world records in the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke and is

the current NCAA 200
breaststroke champion. He is
joined by Ail-Americans Dean
Anderson, Randy Whitchurch,
Bruce Goodwin, Brian Roux and
Dave Fairbank.
Mike Bruner, who holds the
American record in the 1650
meter freestyle and is the 1974
AAU champion in that event,
leads a freshman contingent of
Stu Corliss, Chris Whalen, Matt
Sullivan, Jack Connelly, Mark
McDonagh, Rick Johanssen, Hugh
Kuhn, Bill Chao and Brent Smith.
Bruner, 1973 All-American
Steve Strong, and juniors Craig
Van Zandt, Richard Cook, Ron
Longinotti and Paul Clark should
give the Cards strength in middle
and long distance events.
New Dimension
Bruner "adds a whole new
dimension to our program,"
Gaughran said, and predicted "a
new Stanford record in the 500
and 1000 [meter freestyle] in this
weekend's meet."

Whalen back-up Hencken in the

Diving coach Clyde Devine will
have four returning sophomores in
Wayne Wager, who qualified for
the NCAAs last season, Diane
Campbell, Tom Pedreira and Jill
Ward. They are joined by
freshmen Craig Olson, Steve
Powell and Jim Jett.
Admission to the NorCal
Invitational this weekend is free,
and because there will be a
shortage of timers Gaughran urges
students staying on campus to
come out and help. The meet will
begin Friday at 2:30 p.m. and
resume Saturday at 10 a.m.

SENIOR STARS Senior Melvin Arterberry (34) goes for the ball
against UCLA's since-departed superstar, Keith Wilkes. Arterberry and
7-foot center Rich Kelley (background) are expected to lead the
Cardinal basketball team this season.
The Stanford swim team posted an impressive 7-1 record last year,
and placed sixth in the NCAA championships. And coach Jim
Gaughran thinks the Cards can do even better this season.
"USC and Indiana are probably the best two teams in the nation,"
Gaughran explained, but "it will be a real battle for third between
UCLA, Washington, Tennessee and us."
Stanford opens its season this weekend at the DeGuerre pools in
the Northern California Invitational, and Gaughran will display a
squad that should swim the socks off the other teams competing.
(UOP, Cal, and the Lodi, Arden Hills and Concord Swim Clubs.)
"Our only problem is depth, really," Gaughran said, "at least in
comparison to a team like SC or Indiana... For the first time, we've
got more than just one good swimmer in every event. With some good
performances we should be able to beat UCLA and Washington."
