# Clebsch Heads Religious Council
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
As the new chairman of the Council
on the Study of Religion, Stanford's
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebsch will try to steer the group
toward its goal of "creating order out
of the chaos that has existed in learned
-societies in the field of religion."
The Council is an organization of
independent societies that studies and
coordinates methods of religious
scholarship "for the purpose of giving
religious studies a humanistic,
pillar-Of-excellence approach,"
according to Clebsch, chairman of the
Religious Studies Department.
It ties together the approximately
800 theological schools and 12,000
religious scholars of the United States
and Canada,
Having served on the boards of
directors of several of the societies and
as president of the American Society
of Church History, Clebsch says he has
acquired a broad overview of the field
that will help him in his new role.
Policy Making
Clebsch says he sees his job as
predominantly one of policy making.
He hopes to encourage the "efficiency
of operations and the improvement of
excellence in the * profession of
religious studies."
Among the nine organizations
included in the council are the
American Academy of Religion, the
Society of Biblical Literature and the
Society for the Scientific Study of
Religion. Three others have applied for
membership.
"Before the Council was formed,"
Clebsch said, "these organizations

passed like ships in the dark. Members
of one society didn't know what was
going on in another."
A major aim of the Council is to
coordinate individual societies to avoid
duplication of research and general
confusion. The Council newsletter is a
vehicle through which religious
scholars can know of new courses and
teaching methods in different areas of
. the field, Clebsch pointed out.
'Overview'
"The Council has done more than
any other agency in giving all of us an
accurate over view of what is going on
in the field," Clebsch said.
A second aim of the Council is to
encourage excellence in the field of
teaching. Clebsch cited the planned
Review of Religious Studies as one of
its measures for achieving that
excellence. The Council's major
project at present, the Review will be a
journalistic listing of all publications
dealing with religion.
Clebsch said the flood of Ph.Ds in
the field of religious studies is the
greatest problem facing the Council. Its
efforts to direct scholars into different
channels have proven beneficial,
Clebsch said. So has its attempt to
coordinate University curricula.
Clebsch cited the reduction of the
number of Ph.Ds awarded at Stanford
and the collapse of its Bible Studies
Program as two results of the
coordination of the Council. "Through
the work of the council, we knew that
a few places had excellent Bible
Studies programs. We did not need one
at Stanford," he explained.

number of Ph.Ds awarded at Stanford
and the collapse of its Bible Studies
Program as two results of the
coordination of the Council. "Through

CHAIRMAN—Prof. William Clebsch is the new chairman of the Council on the
Study of Religion, a group which is supposed to "create order out of chaos" in
religious groups.
As the new chairman of the Council
on the Study of Religion, Stanford's
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebsch will try to steer the group
toward its goal of "creating order out
of the chaos that has existed in learned
-societies in the field of religion."
The Council is an organization of
independent societies that studies and
coordinates methods of religious
scholarship "for the purpose of giving
religious studies a humanistic,
pillar-Of-excellence approach,"
according to Clebsch, chairman of the
Religious Studies Department.
It ties together the approximately
800 theological schools and 12,000
religious scholars of the United States
and Canada,
Having served on the boards of
directors of several of the societies and
as president of the American Society
of Church History, Clebsch says he has
acquired a broad overview of the field
that will help him in his new role.
Policy Making
Clebsch says he sees his job as
predominantly one of policy making.
He hopes to encourage the "efficiency
of operations and the improvement of
excellence in the * profession of
religious studies."
Among the nine organizations
included in the council are the
American Academy of Religion, the
Society of Biblical Literature and the
Society for the Scientific Study of
Religion. Three others have applied for
membership.
"Before the Council was formed,"
Clebsch said, "these organizations

passed like ships in the dark. Members
of one society didn't know what was
going on in another."
A major aim of the Council is to
coordinate individual societies to avoid
duplication of research and general
confusion. The Council newsletter is a
vehicle through which religious
scholars can know of new courses and
teaching methods in different areas of
. the field, Clebsch pointed out.
'Overview'
"The Council has done more than
any other agency in giving all of us an
accurate over view of what is going on
in the field," Clebsch said.
A second aim of the Council is to
encourage excellence in the field of
teaching. Clebsch cited the planned
Review of Religious Studies as one of
its measures for achieving that
excellence. The Council's major
project at present, the Review will be a
journalistic listing of all publications
dealing with religion.
Clebsch said the flood of Ph.Ds in
the field of religious studies is the
greatest problem facing the Council. Its
efforts to direct scholars into different
channels have proven beneficial,
Clebsch said. So has its attempt to
coordinate University curricula.
Clebsch cited the reduction of the
number of Ph.Ds awarded at Stanford
and the collapse of its Bible Studies
Program as two results of the
coordination of the Council. "Through
