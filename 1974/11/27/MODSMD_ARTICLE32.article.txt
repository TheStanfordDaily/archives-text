# Ruggers, Huggers Open 1974-75 Season
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Well, the rugger huggers can
don their skimpiest attire, grab a
couple six packs of beer and come
on out to Harry Maloney Field to
help kick off the ' 1974-75
Northern California rugby
campaign at the Stanford
10-a-side rugby tournament,
Saturday at 8:30 a.m.
Oh yeah, and the 56 teams that
have entered the day-long affair
had better bring their own rugby
balls, as the tournament rules
specify, or those pretty little
rugger huggers will be hugging
each other.
What's a rugger hugger? Well,
rugby seems to be the only sport
in which its groupies openly
display their affection for the

participants by wearing shirts with
their calling emblazoned on them.
And there will be plenty of
"honey shots" for photographers
because about 600 ruggers and
their huggers will be participating
in the unofficial kickoff to the
Northern California rugby season.
BATS Favored
All of Northern California's
top teams have entered the affair,
including perennial powerhouse
Bay Area Touring Side (BATS),
which is favored to win the
tourney.
Last year Stanford rugby coach
and tournament director Pete
Kmetovic said, "We don't pretend
to be holding the world
championships. It's just an
opportunity for teams to get
together and have some fun after
the games."
The same spirit will again
prevail this year, according to
Kmetovic. Teams must bring their
own balls, and when officials start
to tire, an appeal will go out for
volunteers to help referee the
games.
Players will arrive in
everything from vintage World
War II ambulances to custom
trailer vans. And they'll keep
themselves company with such
trusted friends as Jack Daniels and
Jim Beam. Of course there'll be
the traditional get-together over

some kegs of beer after the
tourney.
'Open Game'
While there are normally 15
players to a side, Stanford's
tournament limits each team to
just 10 players, making for a
"more open game," according to
Kmetovic. Each team will play
three games in the morning, with
the winners playing four
afternoon contests for the
championship.
Last year the Cards finished
third in the tourney and went on
to compile a 9-4-1 record. Lawry
Lieberman, who last year led the
Cards with impressive
performances from his fullback
slot, is expected to captain the
Cards this year. Football wide
receiver Eric Test will also help
out the ruggers with his kicking.
But gone will be fun-loving Gordy
Riegel, who will graduate at the
end of this quarter.
Like Football
The object of the sport is the
same as football to ground the
ball over the opponent's goal line
and try to add the extra point
after the score. Rugby and the Big
Ten would get along just fine,
because there's about as much
passing in rugby as there is in that
anachronism of sports none.
Scoring is four points for a try
(same as a touchdown), two
points for the conversion and
three for a drop shot and penalty
shot.
The game starts after an affair
known as a scrum,which resembles
a midnight greeting in Central
Park. In the scrum, the eight
forwards circle the ball locking

.arms, then try to secure it with
their feet and pass it to their team
mates.
The Stanford football
defensive backfield would love
rugby because there's no
interference and the rugger must
depend on his elusiveness to break
away. All the players must be
behind the ball or they'll be
penalized for offsides. There is
also no penalty such as backfield
in motion.
Stanford has won the
Monterey National Rugby
Tournament, the unofficial
(everything's unoffical in rugby)
national championship eight
times, the last time in 1971.
