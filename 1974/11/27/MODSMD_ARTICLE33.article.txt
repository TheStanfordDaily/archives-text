# Redwood Line Axed
## Cagers To Alter Style 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The unbridled optimism that
preceded last season's basketball
campaign is now tempered.
For in a frustrating 11-14 year,
the Cardinals learned a sad lesson
about a basketball truism. The
statement "height makes might,"
just isn't accurate.
The Cardinals played a line of
redwood trees last season, 7-foot
center Rich Kelley, 6-11 forward
Tim Patterson and 6-B'/2 forward
Ed Schweitzer. The three, playing
together on the front line, looked
intimidating but slowed down any
attempt at a fast-break offense
and confounded Stanford's
attempt to play man-to-man
defense.
So, when this season begins in
Maples Saturday at 8 p.m. against
LSU, you won't see the line of
trees. Instead, Patterson, who had
problems with rebounding and
defense last season, will play
behind Kelley and Schweitzer,
and substitute for them at the
post spots.
Coach Howie Dallmar
explained that this move would
not only add speed, but also help
keep Kelley out of foul trouble.
The big center fouled out of 40
percent of his games last season,
but with Patterson able to
substitute for him, that figure
should decrease.
Back Injury
With Bill Walton gone, Kelley
is expected to be the dominant
center on the West Coast, but that
title could be jeopardized by a
back injury.

This injury will probably force
Kelley to play in a corset for
awhile. That's a warning don't
think you're seeing a 7-foot drag
queen.
Schweitzer, an aggressive
rebounder, complements Kelley
well at the other post position in
the Cards' offense. And Patterson
has to be one of the best reserve
postmen in the country. So the
Cardinals will be well stocked at
these two positions.
Which leaves three places
where Stanford hasn't always
been so strong the other
forward and two guard positions.
It's certain Melvin Arterberry
will be at one of these spots.
Dallmar's current plan is to start
Arterberry at guard, where he
played last season, and often
move the 6-3V2 senior to forward.
Straightened Out
The regular owner of the
second forward position is 6-6
Scott Trobbe. You might
remember Trobbe as the cockeyed
shooter. Well, his shooting
straightened out over the summer
and Dallmar is hopeful Trobbe
will finally display the promise he
showed as a freshman in this, his
final season.
So what could be better than a
domineering center, two quick
forwards and a great defensive
guard. Not much. But there's
something missing from this
review of last season's talent a
playmaking guard who can shoot.
In 1973-74, Dallmar alternated
since-graduated Jim Montague
with returnees Mark Gilbert and
Ben Bluitt at the point guard spot.
This season, Gilberg and Bluitt
will both see action, but the
probably starter at least for
now is a 6-1 (and that's
stretching it) junior college
transfer named Mike Bratz, which
rhymes with shots, which is what
Dallmar wants him to take.
Bratz has looked good in
practice as both an outside
shooter and a play maker, and it's
hoped that his addition will fill
what has been the team's most
noticeable void.
Frosh Star
Another newcomer, one who
made an aggressive bid for a
starting job but was sidetracked
by an ankle injury, is freshman
Jay Carter. Carter, a native of
Dayton, Ohio, is potentially a
defensive player of Arterberry's

quality, and has more outside
shooting talent than Arterberry,
At 6-3, Carter will generally
play guard, but will be able to
move into a forward spot.
Dallmar says he's not afraid to
play two of his three little men-
Bratz, Bluitt and Gilberg at the
same time.
If two of those players were in
the game, and Arterberry, Carter
or Mike Simons (a 6-4 i
guard/forward swingman best
known for taking shots from way,
way outside) were at
Stanford's lineup would average
only 6-5 or less.
More Man-To-Man
The smaller lineup will be able
to play more man-to-man defense
(Dallmar says he'll play
man-to-man 80 percent of the
time, as opposed to only 50
percent last season), and
fast-break more on offense.
Apparently, the catchword
that has replaced "height makes
might," is "speed is what you
need."
The Cards will need everything
including hieght, speed, hot
shooting and competent referees
to survive a murderous
early-season schedule, which
includes nine road games among
the first 12.
Dallmar thinks, however, that
the tough schedule, though it will
hurt Stanford's overall record, will
prepare the team for a tough year
of play in the Pacific Eight -
which may be, top to bottom, the
best in its history.
"I'd trade two or three of
those early-season wins any time,"
Dallmar says, "for one in the
conference."

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
hasn't won its opener since
1970 ... The Maravich-less LSU
team is pegged for eighth place in
the Southeastern Conference.
Despite its lack of hieght, (no
starter over 6-9) LSU figures to be
rough competition. The Tigers are
led by forward Glenn Hansen,
who averaged 10.4 points last
season and is compared by LSU
coach Dale Brown to John
Havlicek.
Other starters for the Tigers,
who finished 12-14 last year, are
blue-chip freshman Kenny Higgs,
center Ed Le√ülanc and guards
Mike Darnall and Gary Huffman.

So, when this season begins in
Maples Saturday at 8 p.m. against
LSU, you won't see the line of
trees. Instead, Patterson, who had
problems with rebounding and
defense last season, will play
behind Kelley and Schweitzer,
and substitute for them at the
post spots.
Coach Howie Dallmar
explained that this move would
not only add speed, but also help
keep Kelley out of foul trouble.
The big center fouled out of 40
percent of his games last season,
but with Patterson able to
substitute for him, that figure
should decrease.
Back Injury
With Bill Walton gone, Kelley
is expected to be the dominant
center on the West Coast, but that
title could be jeopardized by a
back injury.

This injury will probably force
Kelley to play in a corset for
awhile. That's a warning don't
think you're seeing a 7-foot drag
queen.
Schweitzer, an aggressive
rebounder, complements Kelley
well at the other post position in
the Cards' offense. And Patterson
has to be one of the best reserve
postmen in the country. So the
Cardinals will be well stocked at
these two positions.
Which leaves three places
where Stanford hasn't always
been so strong the other
forward and two guard positions.
It's certain Melvin Arterberry
will be at one of these spots.
Dallmar's current plan is to start
Arterberry at guard, where he
played last season, and often
move the 6-3V2 senior to forward.
Straightened Out
The regular owner of the
second forward position is 6-6
Scott Trobbe. You might
remember Trobbe as the cockeyed
shooter. Well, his shooting
straightened out over the summer
and Dallmar is hopeful Trobbe
will finally display the promise he
showed as a freshman in this, his
final season.
So what could be better than a
domineering center, two quick
forwards and a great defensive
guard. Not much. But there's
something missing from this
review of last season's talent a
playmaking guard who can shoot.
In 1973-74, Dallmar alternated
since-graduated Jim Montague
with returnees Mark Gilbert and
Ben Bluitt at the point guard spot.
This season, Gilberg and Bluitt
will both see action, but the
probably starter at least for
now is a 6-1 (and that's
stretching it) junior college
transfer named Mike Bratz, which
rhymes with shots, which is what
Dallmar wants him to take.
Bratz has looked good in
practice as both an outside
shooter and a play maker, and it's
hoped that his addition will fill
what has been the team's most
noticeable void.
Frosh Star
Another newcomer, one who
made an aggressive bid for a
starting job but was sidetracked
by an ankle injury, is freshman
Jay Carter. Carter, a native of
Dayton, Ohio, is potentially a
defensive player of Arterberry's

quality, and has more outside
shooting talent than Arterberry,
At 6-3, Carter will generally
play guard, but will be able to
move into a forward spot.
Dallmar says he's not afraid to
play two of his three little men-
Bratz, Bluitt and Gilberg at the
same time.
If two of those players were in
the game, and Arterberry, Carter
or Mike Simons (a 6-4 i
guard/forward swingman best
known for taking shots from way,
way outside) were at
Stanford's lineup would average
only 6-5 or less.
More Man-To-Man
The smaller lineup will be able
to play more man-to-man defense
(Dallmar says he'll play
man-to-man 80 percent of the
time, as opposed to only 50
percent last season), and
fast-break more on offense.
Apparently, the catchword
that has replaced "height makes
might," is "speed is what you
need."
The Cards will need everything
including hieght, speed, hot
shooting and competent referees
to survive a murderous
early-season schedule, which
includes nine road games among
the first 12.
Dallmar thinks, however, that
the tough schedule, though it will
hurt Stanford's overall record, will
prepare the team for a tough year
of play in the Pacific Eight -
which may be, top to bottom, the
best in its history.
"I'd trade two or three of
those early-season wins any time,"
Dallmar says, "for one in the
conference."

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
hasn't won its opener since
1970 ... The Maravich-less LSU
team is pegged for eighth place in
the Southeastern Conference.
Despite its lack of hieght, (no
starter over 6-9) LSU figures to be
rough competition. The Tigers are
led by forward Glenn Hansen,
who averaged 10.4 points last

Other starters for the Tigers,

THE SCRUM IS BACK Rugby, which is probably growing in
popularity faster than any other Stanford sport, returns this Saturday
with the Stanford 10-a-side tournament. About 560 rugby players are
expected for the massive event and subsequent kegger.
The unbridled optimism that

center on the West Coast, but that
title could be jeopardized by a
back injury.

This injury will probably force
Kelley to play in a corset for
awhile. That's a warning don't
think you're seeing a 7-foot drag
queen.
Schweitzer, an aggressive
rebounder, complements Kelley
well at the other post position in
the Cards' offense. And Patterson
has to be one of the best reserve
postmen in the country. So the
Cardinals will be well stocked at
these two positions.
Which leaves three places
where Stanford hasn't always
been so strong the other
forward and two guard positions.
It's certain Melvin Arterberry
will be at one of these spots.
Dallmar's current plan is to start
Arterberry at guard, where he
played last season, and often
move the 6-3V2 senior to forward.
Straightened Out
The regular owner of the
second forward position is 6-6
Scott Trobbe. You might
remember Trobbe as the cockeyed
shooter. Well, his shooting
straightened out over the summer
and Dallmar is hopeful Trobbe
will finally display the promise he
showed as a freshman in this, his
final season.
So what could be better than a
domineering center, two quick
forwards and a great defensive
guard. Not much. But there's
something missing from this
review of last season's talent a
playmaking guard who can shoot.
In 1973-74, Dallmar alternated
since-graduated Jim Montague
with returnees Mark Gilbert and
Ben Bluitt at the point guard spot.
This season, Gilberg and Bluitt
will both see action, but the
probably starter at least for
now is a 6-1 (and that's
stretching it) junior college
transfer named Mike Bratz, which
rhymes with shots, which is what
Dallmar wants him to take.
Bratz has looked good in
practice as both an outside
shooter and a play maker, and it's
hoped that his addition will fill
what has been the team's most
noticeable void.
Frosh Star
Another newcomer, one who
made an aggressive bid for a
starting job but was sidetracked
by an ankle injury, is freshman
Jay Carter. Carter, a native of
Dayton, Ohio, is potentially a
defensive player of Arterberry's

quality, and has more outside
shooting talent than Arterberry,
At 6-3, Carter will generally
play guard, but will be able to
move into a forward spot.
Dallmar says he's not afraid to
play two of his three little men-
Bratz, Bluitt and Gilberg at the
same time.
If two of those players were in
the game, and Arterberry, Carter
or Mike Simons (a 6-4 i
guard/forward swingman best
known for taking shots from way,
way outside) were at
Stanford's lineup would average
only 6-5 or less.
More Man-To-Man
The smaller lineup will be able
to play more man-to-man defense
(Dallmar says he'll play
man-to-man 80 percent of the
time, as opposed to only 50
percent last season), and
fast-break more on offense.
Apparently, the catchword
that has replaced "height makes
might," is "speed is what you
need."
The Cards will need everything
including hieght, speed, hot
shooting and competent referees
to survive a murderous
early-season schedule, which
includes nine road games among
the first 12.
Dallmar thinks, however, that
the tough schedule, though it will
hurt Stanford's overall record, will
prepare the team for a tough year
of play in the Pacific Eight -
which may be, top to bottom, the
best in its history.
"I'd trade two or three of
those early-season wins any time,"
Dallmar says, "for one in the
conference."

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
hasn't won its opener since
1970 ... The Maravich-less LSU
team is pegged for eighth place in
the Southeastern Conference.
Despite its lack of hieght, (no
starter over 6-9) LSU figures to be
rough competition. The Tigers are
led by forward Glenn Hansen,
who averaged 10.4 points last
season and is compared by LSU

Other starters for the Tigers,

THE SCRUM IS BACK Rugby, which is probably growing in
popularity faster than any other Stanford sport, returns this Saturday
with the Stanford 10-a-side tournament. About 560 rugby players are
expected for the massive event and subsequent kegger.
The unbridled optimism that
preceded last season's basketball
campaign is now tempered.
For in a frustrating 11-14 year,
the Cardinals learned a sad lesson
about a basketball truism. The
statement "height makes might,"
just isn't accurate.
The Cardinals played a line of
redwood trees last season, 7-foot
center Rich Kelley, 6-11 forward
Tim Patterson and 6-B'/2 forward
Ed Schweitzer. The three, playing
together on the front line, looked
intimidating but slowed down any
attempt at a fast-break offense
and confounded Stanford's
attempt to play man-to-man
defense.
So, when this season begins in
Maples Saturday at 8 p.m. against
LSU, you won't see the line of
trees. Instead, Patterson, who had
problems with rebounding and
defense last season, will play
behind Kelley and Schweitzer,
and substitute for them at the
post spots.
Coach Howie Dallmar
explained that this move would
not only add speed, but also help
keep Kelley out of foul trouble.
The big center fouled out of 40
percent of his games last season,
but with Patterson able to
substitute for him, that figure
should decrease.

is expected to be the dominant
center on the West Coast, but that
