Bouncing back strongly after a
season-opening loss to California,
Stanford's wrestling team swept
both ends of a double-dual meet.
* The Cards defeated highly
regarded Chico State 31-9 in the
first match and came back to
swamp Sacramento State 30-14 in
the nightcap yesterday evening in
Encina Gym.
"I was very happy with the
team's showing tonight," head
coach Joe DeMeo commented
after the double win. "We made a
strong comeback after the Cal
loss."
DeMe'o sent his first-liners
against Chico while a number of
,) jayvees saw action in the
Sacramento match.
Chico jumped to a 6-0 lead
before Stanford picked up four
straight wins and a forfeit to
clinch the match. John Govea,
wrestling at 190, recorded two
, takedowns against Jim Minto to
take a close contest 5-3 and give
Stanford its first points of the
evening.
At 118, Malcom Scott won an
entertaining 7-1 decision over Gen
Burris on the strength of superior
>,» riding and a take down. "Scott
wrestled tough," DeMeo said. "I
didn't think he would win so
easily."

The pivotal matches of the
evening were in the 150 and 158
pound weight categories. Stanford
All-America candidate Chris
Horpel, coming off a
disappointing loss in Berkeley,
pinned Chico's Dennis Jansen at
2:38 of the second round after
building up a commanding 15-0
lead in the early going.
' "Chris did an excellent job for
us tonight," DeMeo said. "He
really looked sharp. I think he's
going to be someone to be
reckoned with at the Pac-B's later
this year."
Sophomore Craig Reynolds
almost duplicated Horpel's feat
when he pinned Chico's Carl
Anderson at 2:11 of the second
round. The fall put the contest
out of reach.

In other matches, Mark Yancy
used a last-minute escape to edge
Steve Nolan 8-7 at 142. Roy
•Tolles, wrestling at 177, ended the
match with a 17-5 major decision
over Allen Ingram.
One of the most interesting
matches of the" evening saw
Chico's Victor Gutirrez, rated one
of the best wrestlers in California
by some observers, defeat
Stanford's Bob Keating 10-4.
"Bob exhibited too much macho,"
DeMeo said. "He thought, 'l'm
going out there and throw you,
you're not going to do it to me.'
That's not his style, it's Gutirrez's
style and Keating couldn't handle
it."
Stanford's next match will be
against San Jose State Saturday in
Maples Pavilion after the
Louisiana State basketball game.
