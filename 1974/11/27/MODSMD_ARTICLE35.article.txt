## 49ers Bad, Even For S.F. 
### Glenn Garvin 
"Why don't you write something about the
Seals?" someone asked the other day. Ahh, but
that would be like kicking at cripple. Not that this
column has ever been reluctant to kick cripples. It's
just there are far more fun teams in the Bay Area
to pick on.
Like the 49ers, for instance. For sheer
mediocrity you can't beat the 49ers. Not only are
they crummy, but they're boring , almost to the
point of tears. Watching them play football is about
as exciting as counting stop signs in Millbrae.
The amazing thing is not that the 49ers are so
lousy all San Francisco professional teams are
lousy but that they so easily take in the city's
sportswriters. These guys, who never learn, are
raving about the team again. Fools.
It seems the 49ers, who stumbled around to a
2-7 start, have won two games in a row. They beat
a pair of NFL powerhouses: Chicago, which finally
broke a string of 25 quarters without a touchdown
this Sunday, and Atlanta, which has scored just six
offensive touchdowns in 11 games.
These two gridiron giants have a combined
record of 5-19. Generally beating them is not cause
for great jubilation, but when you're a 49er fan you
have to spread your superlatives when you can.
Swallowed It Whole
San Francisco newspapers have taken that
philosophy completely to heart. 49ers Roll to
Another Shutout screamed the Chronicle.
Turnabout 49ers 'Capable of 7-7 Finish. Owen Rips
Falcons in 27-0 Win. The Examiner, never one to
lag behind, babbled Sweet smell of success stirs
49ers.
The media's treatment of Tom Owen is just as
lavish. The San Jose Mercury labeled him "rookie
quarterback sensation" and the Examiner called
him "brilliant."
To set the record straight, Owen completed 7 of
16 passes for 127 yards and was sacked five times
which is no disgrace, but not really the kind of
thing that's going to make his bubble gum card a
collector's item, either.

Owen is from Wjchita State, a school known
mostly for producing experts on soybean cosmetics
and cow toiletry. He's the latest in a long line of
quarterbacks who have paraded quickly through
town since John Brodie started to get old.
He got his chance to start when the 49er
management decided Joe Reed's disturbing
propensity to throw footballs into waterbuckets
and passing aircraft didn't seem to be lessening. So
Reed was dispatched to Antarctica (or Detroit, or
somewhere) for two Eskimos and a future draft
choice, and Owen became number one man for the
49ers a fate slightly better than death, but not
much.
Owen's season stats are not really very good,
despite all the wonderful things the papers have
been scribbling about him: 62 of 122 with 8
interceptions for 1017 yards. And if he's getting
any ideas about sticking around here for very long,
he should remember that Joe Reed got the same
kind of publicity when he took over last year. More
than likely Owen will wind up building snowmen
with Reed.
Anonymous Backfield
The 49er running backs are Larry Schreiber
(Larry Schreiber ?) and Wilbur Jackson, who was
supposed to add some punch to the offense and has
failed magnificently. Surely this is one of the most
deservedly anonymous backfields in pro football.
Actually, the 49ers did have one semi-competent
runner, Vic Washington. The team's management,
alert as always, spotted Washington right away and
traded him to Houston for 10 yards of Astroturf.
Despite tnis utter lack qf offensive punch,
many people think the 49ers have played under
their potential. Tom Owen, for instance. "We could
have beaten both Los Angeles and Oakland if the
breaks had been different," he brightly told
sportswriters Sunday.
Sure. And Japan could have'won World War II if
the breaks had been different, too. And with a little
luck Evel Knievel could jump the Pacific Ocean and
William Shockley could be President. But don't
hold your breath.
