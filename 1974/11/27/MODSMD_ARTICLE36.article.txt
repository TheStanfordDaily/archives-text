# OSU's Andros Rehired; Owens Ponders Future
## 
### 
Oregon State football
coach Dee Andros, contrary
to rumors, was rehired for
another season Monday night.
It had been rumored that
Andros would lose his job,
but OSU's 3-4 conference
finish, which included strong
showings in losses to Cal,
Stanford and USC, saved the
Pumpkin's job for at least one
more season.
In Seattle, Washington
coach Jim Owens, also
rumored on the way out, has
been offered one-year pact.
Two non-league college
coaches didn't fare as well.
Kansas State's Vince Gibson
and Wyoming's Fritz Shurmer
both announced their
leifcgnations Monday.
