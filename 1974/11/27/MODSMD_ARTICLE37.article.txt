## Prediction: It'll Be Cordova Again 
### Viae Kershner 
Stanford's football season is over,
successfully completed with a clear second
place finish in the Pacific Eight, best since
1953, excluding the two Rose Bowl years.
But still, all sports fans here talk about is
the quarterback situation, and whether we
could have gone to the Rose Bowl if a
different person had played QB against USC.
The answer to that is "No." The way USC
played against us, and then performed against
Washington and UCLA, you'd have to say the
Trojans are by far the best team in the
league, and that Stanford couldn't have
beaten them with Steve Bartkowski.
So, I think the seasoh wasn't totally
screwed up by anything having to do with
quarterbacks. But that doesn't mean
Stanford should stick with the same QB next
year.
Changed Mind
I've changed my mind and now agree with
the majority of Cardinal fans: Guy Benjamin
deserves first shot at the job next season.
I wasn't one of Guy's biggest fans after
the Illinois game, when he made one of the
dumbest fumbles I'd ever seen and then
complained he shouldn't have been taken out
of the game.
But now, Benjamin has obviously shown
he is, at this point in his career, a better
quarterback than Mike Cordova.
Moreover, he's matured a lot. His
performance in the locker room after the Cal
game was masterful he* didn't come even
remotely close to criticizing anyone. That's
exactly how a team leader should act.
It almost seemed that Benjamin had taken
Jack Christiansen's "course" on how not to
step on anyone's toes with public statements.
Benjamin Phenomenal
I disagree with those who think Cordova's

1974 performance was unsatisfactory.
Generally, Mike played OK. But Benjamin
was nothing short of phenomenal, and
deserves the number one job. •
It's really too bad Stanford had recruited
two excellent quarterbacks whose ambitions
will constantly conflict. The only solution is
for the second-best of the two quarterbacks
in my opinion, Cordova to redshirt a
season in anticipation of being the starting
QB in 1977.
That's what Don Bunce did so he
wouldn't always be Jim Plunkett's backup,
and now Bunce is a bona fide hero.
OK, that's what I hope will occur. But
that isn't, I'm afraid, what's going to happen.
Here's my best guess.
A Prediction
Both Benjamin and Cordova will show up
at spring practice hopeful of getting the
number one job (Benjamin told Daily
reporter Chris Baker Monday that he
definitely wouldn't transfer this year.)
Cordova will outplay Benjamin in spring
ball, at least the way Christiansen sees it. So
Mike will be listed number one again going
into next fall.
Christiansen will then ask Benjamin to
redshirt.Guy will say, "Fuck you, coach."No,
I take that back. Like I said, Benjamin is
mellow.
OK, so then Cordova will start the first
two games at Penn State and Michigan.
Since there won't be any lynch mobs coming
after Chris that far away from the Farm,
Cordova will get to play all of both games.
If Cordova plays well, Benjamin will be
asked to redshirt next season. He'll either say
yes or quit the team and transfer.
Back To The Phones
In either case, Jerry Waldvogel will. be

number two. Jerry doesn't quite have the
talent to be number one, so he'll be on the
telephones again next year, making his usual
wise-ass remarks, serving as unofficial
assistant quarterback coach and becoming
one of the most well-liked players on the
team.
Now, if Cordova doesn't play well in the
first two games, Chris will bench him and tell
Benjamin he's number one.
Sure, it would be an admission on
Christiansen's part that he made a mistake
with Cordova, but Chris is more interested in
winning and saving his job than saving face.
In that case, Cordova would be back-up
next season and redshirt in 1976, in
anticipation of becoming number one in
1977.
Got all that straight? What it all boils
down to is that, since Christiansen likes
Cordova better than Benjamin, Cordova will
get the first shot next year. But since Chris
also likes Benjamin better than
unemployment, he won't stick with Cordova
if he can't do the job in his junior year.
That's not to say Christiansen doesn't like
Benjamin. Deep down, I'm convinced that
Chris likes everyone he's ever met, even
George Halas, John McKay, Rod Garcia and
Glenn Dickey. Well, at least Halas, McKay
and Garcia.
But Christiansen really likes Cordova. He
desperately wants him to' succeed as a
quarterback, and perhaps this feeling gets in
the way of his football judgment.
. So Guy will be relegated to the bench,
again, at the beginning of next season. But
watch, I think Chris will go with his gut
feeling for only two games next season.
Then, if his feeling is unproven, he'll go
back to his better judgment.

step on anyone's toes with public statements.
Benjamin Phenomenal
I disagree with those who think Cordova's

1974 performance was unsatisfactory.
Generally, Mike played OK. But Benjamin
was nothing short of phenomenal, and
deserves the number one job. •
It's really too bad Stanford had recruited
two excellent quarterbacks whose ambitions
will constantly conflict. The only solution is
for the second-best of the two quarterbacks
in my opinion, Cordova to redshirt a
season in anticipation of being the starting
QB in 1977.
That's what Don Bunce did so he
wouldn't always be Jim Plunkett's backup,
and now Bunce is a bona fide hero.
OK, that's what I hope will occur. But
that isn't, I'm afraid, what's going to happen.
Here's my best guess.
A Prediction
Both Benjamin and Cordova will show up
at spring practice hopeful of getting the
number one job (Benjamin told Daily
reporter Chris Baker Monday that he
definitely wouldn't transfer this year.)
Cordova will outplay Benjamin in spring
ball, at least the way Christiansen sees it. So
Mike will be listed number one again going
into next fall.
Christiansen will then ask Benjamin to
redshirt.Guy will say, "Fuck you, coach."No,
I take that back. Like I said, Benjamin is
mellow.
OK, so then Cordova will start the first
two games at Penn State and Michigan.
Since there won't be any lynch mobs coming
after Chris that far away from the Farm,
Cordova will get to play all of both games.
If Cordova plays well, Benjamin will be
asked to redshirt next season. He'll either say
yes or quit the team and transfer.
Back To The Phones
In either case, Jerry Waldvogel will. be

number two. Jerry doesn't quite have the
talent to be number one, so he'll be on the
telephones again next year, making his usual
wise-ass remarks, serving as unofficial
assistant quarterback coach and becoming
one of the most well-liked players on the
team.
Now, if Cordova doesn't play well in the
first two games, Chris will bench him and tell
Benjamin he's number one.
Sure, it would be an admission on
Christiansen's part that he made a mistake
with Cordova, but Chris is more interested in
winning and saving his job than saving face.
In that case, Cordova would be back-up
next season and redshirt in 1976, in
anticipation of becoming number one in
1977.
Got all that straight? What it all boils
down to is that, since Christiansen likes
Cordova better than Benjamin, Cordova will
get the first shot next year. But since Chris
also likes Benjamin better than
unemployment, he won't stick with Cordova
if he can't do the job in his junior year.
That's not to say Christiansen doesn't like
Benjamin. Deep down, I'm convinced that
Chris likes everyone he's ever met, even
George Halas, John McKay, Rod Garcia and
Glenn Dickey. Well, at least Halas, McKay
and Garcia.
But Christiansen really likes Cordova. He
desperately wants him to' succeed as a
quarterback, and perhaps this feeling gets in
the way of his football judgment.
. So Guy will be relegated to the bench,
again, at the beginning of next season. But
watch, I think Chris will go with his gut
feeling for only two games next season.
Then, if his feeling is unproven, he'll go
back to his better judgment.
Stanford's football season is over,
successfully completed with a clear second
place finish in the Pacific Eight, best since
1953, excluding the two Rose Bowl years.
But still, all sports fans here talk about is
the quarterback situation, and whether we
could have gone to the Rose Bowl if a
different person had played QB against USC.
The answer to that is "No." The way USC
played against us, and then performed against
Washington and UCLA, you'd have to say the
Trojans are by far the best team in the
league, and that Stanford couldn't have
beaten them with Steve Bartkowski.
So, I think the seasoh wasn't totally
screwed up by anything having to do with
quarterbacks. But that doesn't mean
Stanford should stick with the same QB next
year.
Changed Mind
I've changed my mind and now agree with
the majority of Cardinal fans: Guy Benjamin
deserves first shot at the job next season.
I wasn't one of Guy's biggest fans after
the Illinois game, when he made one of the
dumbest fumbles I'd ever seen and then
complained he shouldn't have been taken out
of the game.
But now, Benjamin has obviously shown
he is, at this point in his career, a better
quarterback than Mike Cordova.
Moreover, he's matured a lot. His
performance in the locker room after the Cal
game was masterful he* didn't come even
remotely close to criticizing anyone. That's
exactly how a team leader should act.

If Cordova plays well, Benjamin will be
asked to redshirt next season. He'll either say
yes or quit the team and transfer.
Back To The Phones
In either case, Jerry Waldvogel will. be

number two. Jerry doesn't quite have the
talent to be number one, so he'll be on the
telephones again next year, making his usual
wise-ass remarks, serving as unofficial
assistant quarterback coach and becoming
one of the most well-liked players on the
team.
Now, if Cordova doesn't play well in the
first two games, Chris will bench him and tell
Benjamin he's number one.
Sure, it would be an admission on
Christiansen's part that he made a mistake
with Cordova, but Chris is more interested in
winning and saving his job than saving face.
In that case, Cordova would be back-up
next season and redshirt in 1976, in
anticipation of becoming number one in
1977.
Got all that straight? What it all boils
down to is that, since Christiansen likes
Cordova better than Benjamin, Cordova will
get the first shot next year. But since Chris
also likes Benjamin better than
unemployment, he won't stick with Cordova
if he can't do the job in his junior year.
That's not to say Christiansen doesn't like
Benjamin. Deep down, I'm convinced that
Chris likes everyone he's ever met, even
George Halas, John McKay, Rod Garcia and
Glenn Dickey. Well, at least Halas, McKay
and Garcia.
But Christiansen really likes Cordova. He
desperately wants him to' succeed as a
quarterback, and perhaps this feeling gets in
the way of his football judgment.
. So Guy will be relegated to the bench,
again, at the beginning of next season. But
watch, I think Chris will go with his gut
feeling for only two games next season.
Then, if his feeling is unproven, he'll go
back to his better judgment.
Stanford's football season is over,
successfully completed with a clear second
place finish in the Pacific Eight, best since
1953, excluding the two Rose Bowl years.
But still, all sports fans here talk about is
the quarterback situation, and whether we
could have gone to the Rose Bowl if a
different person had played QB against USC.
The answer to that is "No." The way USC
played against us, and then performed against
Washington and UCLA, you'd have to say the
Trojans are by far the best team in the
league, and that Stanford couldn't have
beaten them with Steve Bartkowski.
So, I think the seasoh wasn't totally
screwed up by anything having to do with
quarterbacks. But that doesn't mean
Stanford should stick with the same QB next
year.
Changed Mind
I've changed my mind and now agree with
the majority of Cardinal fans: Guy Benjamin
deserves first shot at the job next season.
I wasn't one of Guy's biggest fans after
the Illinois game, when he made one of the
dumbest fumbles I'd ever seen and then
complained he shouldn't have been taken out
of the game.
But now, Benjamin has obviously shown
he is, at this point in his career, a better
quarterback than Mike Cordova.
Moreover, he's matured a lot. His
performance in the locker room after the Cal
game was masterful he* didn't come even
remotely close to criticizing anyone. That's
exactly how a team leader should act.
It almost seemed that Benjamin had taken
Jack Christiansen's "course" on how not to
step on anyone's toes with public statements.
Benjamin Phenomenal
I disagree with those who think Cordova's

1974 performance was unsatisfactory.
Generally, Mike played OK. But Benjamin
was nothing short of phenomenal, and
deserves the number one job. •
It's really too bad Stanford had recruited
two excellent quarterbacks whose ambitions
will constantly conflict. The only solution is
for the second-best of the two quarterbacks
in my opinion, Cordova to redshirt a
season in anticipation of being the starting
QB in 1977.
That's what Don Bunce did so he
wouldn't always be Jim Plunkett's backup,
and now Bunce is a bona fide hero.
OK, that's what I hope will occur. But
that isn't, I'm afraid, what's going to happen.
Here's my best guess.
A Prediction
Both Benjamin and Cordova will show up
at spring practice hopeful of getting the
number one job (Benjamin told Daily
reporter Chris Baker Monday that he
definitely wouldn't transfer this year.)
Cordova will outplay Benjamin in spring
ball, at least the way Christiansen sees it. So
Mike will be listed number one again going
into next fall.
Christiansen will then ask Benjamin to
redshirt.Guy will say, "Fuck you, coach."No,
I take that back. Like I said, Benjamin is
mellow.
OK, so then Cordova will start the first
two games at Penn State and Michigan.
Since there won't be any lynch mobs coming
after Chris that far away from the Farm,
Cordova will get to play all of both games.
If Cordova plays well, Benjamin will be
asked to redshirt next season. He'll either say
yes or quit the team and transfer.
