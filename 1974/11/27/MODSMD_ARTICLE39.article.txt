# New Women's Cage Coach Named
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
A new era is opening up in
women's basketball at Stanford
with the appointment of head
coach Gay Coburn.
"This will be an exciting year,"
promises Coburn, who was named
head coach only one day before
the first team meeting Nov. 13.
Shirley Schoof, last year's head
coach, voluntarily stepped down

to be Coburn's assistant.
A graduate student in
education working for her Ph.D.,
Coburn brings four years .of
basketball coaching experience to
her new position. She coached
high school teams for three years
and the Univesity of Arizona's
junior varsity for one season.
Coburn takes the position just
as great changes are coming into
both women's basketball and the
Stanford program.
"Rule changes in the last three
or four years have made women's
basketball into a rougher, more
open game, more like men play,"
Coburn says.

These changes have not yet had
time to be fully absorbed by the
women trying out for the team.
Coburn expects to concentrate on
teaching fundamentals as well as
developing coordinated offenses
and defenses.
The Stanford program also
features innovations. For the first
time ever the team will have
uniforms. There will be a trainer
and manager as well as two
coaches. Longer practice sessions
have also been scheduled.
In perhaps the greatest change
from past years, the team is
already beginning to take shape.
Three voluntary meetings have
been held, including some
scrimmaging. This preseason
definitely permits Coburn to get
some idea of the players available
as well as tell the team to report
in top physical condition on the
first day of practice in January.
All this may seem very normal
to those familiar with the men's
program, but it is a new world for
the women's intercollegiate team. 4
Coburn professes to be a
disciplinarian. Despite this,
enthusiasm seems to be a common
denominator among the 35
women trying out for the team.
Nonetheless, the new coach
faces an uphill battle. The Cards
won only once last season, and '
the indications are that this year's
team will not be very tall. Coburn
hopes to compensate by
concentrating on the fast break
and a passing offense.
