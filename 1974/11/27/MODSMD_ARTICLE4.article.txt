# Education Costs Rising
## Miller Defends Tuition Hike 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Acting President William Miller last
night defended a proposed 12.9
percent tuition hike for next fall as the
best method of dealing with
skyrocketing University expenses.
Contending the cost of higher
education is rising more rapidly than
the general inflation rate in this
country, Miller said he would rather
raise tuition across the board than
"structure" it so that students would
pay different amounts depending on
how many units they take, or on other
factors.
"If you have to structure tuition, it
might make financial aid more
difficult because there would have to
be a more individual process in
assigning it," Miller said after an
interview on KZSU's Campus
Conference.
Despite the tuition increase, Miller
said "it's still clear we'll have to make
a dimunition of academic programs.
We will be doing fewer things, but
what we do we will do well."
However, Miller refused on several
to commit himself to the
support of specific program cuts. "It's
premature to identify particular areas
at this time. I haven't gotten feedback
from the deans yet."

He emphasized that the budget
tightening to relieve a $lO million
projected deficit will "not be a sudden
program. There will be a time for
adjustment over three years."
Miller agreed that budget cuts will
make it less likely that new professors

will be granted tenure. As a result,
"the flow of younger faculty to the
University will be slowed down. We
have a large number of tenured faculty
with secure positions so there will be a
bigger burden at the junior faculty
level" when the University tightens its
belt.
Although he did not foresee any
large new sources of funds, Miller said
the University could look toward
business and industry to contribute
more.
"We had an unexpectedly high
support from business and industry,"
reaching an all-time high last year.
Business and industry is the fastest
growing area of financial support, he
added.

Noting that the University has been
looking outside the country for
funding, Miller said he did not believe
foreign countries nor corporations
contributing large amounts would
exert too much influence over
University planning.
"I have a lot of confidence that the
top people in business and industry are
quite enlightened. Most do designate
funds to specific areas, but they also
take recognition of the need for
unrestricted support," he said.
Miller also said he "wouldn't be
surprised if we moved somewhat in the
direction" of allowing University fund
raisers to give high priority to
soliciting money for women's athletic
scholarships.

"the flow of younger faculty to the
University will be slowed down. We
have a large number of tenured faculty
with secure positions so there will be a
bigger burden at the junior faculty
level" when the University tightens its
belt.
Although he did not foresee any
large new sources of funds, Miller said
the University could look toward
business and industry to contribute
more.
"We had an unexpectedly high
support from business and industry,"
reaching an all-time high last year.
Business and industry is the fastest
growing area of financial support, he
added.

Noting that the University has been
looking outside the country for
funding, Miller said he did not believe
foreign countries nor corporations
contributing large amounts would
exert too much influence over
University planning.
"I have a lot of confidence that the
top people in business and industry are
quite enlightened. Most do designate
funds to specific areas, but they also
take recognition of the need for
unrestricted support," he said.
Miller also said he "wouldn't be
surprised if we moved somewhat in the
direction" of allowing University fund
raisers to give high priority to
soliciting money for women's athletic
scholarships.
Acting President William Miller last
night defended a proposed 12.9
percent tuition hike for next fall as the
best method of dealing with
skyrocketing University expenses.
Contending the cost of higher
education is rising more rapidly than
the general inflation rate in this
country, Miller said he would rather
raise tuition across the board than
"structure" it so that students would
pay different amounts depending on
how many units they take, or on other
factors.
"If you have to structure tuition, it
might make financial aid more
difficult because there would have to
be a more individual process in
assigning it," Miller said after an
interview on KZSU's Campus
Conference.
Despite the tuition increase, Miller
said "it's still clear we'll have to make
a dimunition of academic programs.
We will be doing fewer things, but
what we do we will do well."
However, Miller refused on several
to commit himself to the
support of specific program cuts. "It's
premature to identify particular areas
at this time. I haven't gotten feedback
from the deans yet."

He emphasized that the budget
tightening to relieve a $lO million
projected deficit will "not be a sudden
program. There will be a time for
adjustment over three years."
Miller agreed that budget cuts will
make it less likely that new professors

will be granted tenure. As a result,
"the flow of younger faculty to the
University will be slowed down. We
have a large number of tenured faculty
with secure positions so there will be a
