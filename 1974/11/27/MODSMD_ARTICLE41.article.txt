Coal Union Approves Contract
WASHINGTON Regional leaders of the United Mine
reversing themselves, approved a contract offer
from the coal industry yesterday and agreed to put it to a
vote by the union's 120,000 striking miners.
UMW President Arnold Miller announced the council's
approval and said it may be possible to reopen the mines
'sometime next week if the membership ratifies the pact.
The council had rejected the proposed contract 21-11
Jearlier in the day but within hours reconvened and changed
position. Miller gave no reason for the change, other than to
say it was part of the "democratic process working at its
finest."
The vote to approve the agreement and send it out for
ratification was not given. However, council member Gene
Mitchell of Benton, 111. said it was by a wide margin.
Miller said the package, providing miners with a 63
percent increase in wages and benefits over the next three
years, would be explained Saturday to district officials at
eight regional meetings. He said the ratification vote may be
held as early as Monday.
Doctors Reach Nixon Health Decision
LOS ANGELES Three court-appointed doctors
W assigned to determine whether former President Richard M.
Nixon is well enough to testify at the Watergate cover-up
trial said yesterday they had reached a unanimous
conclusion. But they wouldn't reveal it.
The cardiovascular specialists said at an airport news
conference that their report was confidential for the trial.
After a medical examination of Nixon and four and a
fchalf hours of reviewing his medical records Monday, "our
conclusion was absolutely unanimous," said Dr. Richard
Starr Ross of Johns Hopkins University.
Dr. Charles Hufnagel of Georgetown University in
Washington, head of the team, said U.S. District Court
Judge John J. Sirica will have the report Friday.
Congress Favoring Arms Agreement
'W'
WASHINGTON Congressional leaders were reported
to have reacted favorably yesterday to President Ford's
briefing on the proposed nuclear arms agreement with the
Soviet Union.
Sen. J. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), a frequent critic of
U.S.-Soviet negotiations emerged from a one and a half
.hour meeting at the White House predicting that the
accord reached at Vladivostock with Soviet Party
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev probably would win Senate
approval.
However, two key senators not present for the briefing
remained skeptical of the accord that reportedly would
allow the U.S. to increase its array of nuclear arms slightly
while requiring the Soviets to scale down their arms
%>rogram.
Sen. Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.), the Senate's most
outspoken critic of U.S.-Soviet policy, said Americans
should not be led to believe that the Ford-Brezhnev
agreement will bring about an arms reduction.
Sirica Questions Mitchell
fc WASHINGTON - U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
startled the Watergate cover-up trial yesterday by
personally taking over the questioning of defendant and

former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell.
With the jury present, Mitchell became the first of the
five defendants to testify in their own defense. For two
hours he denied ever approving the original Watergate
break-in or taking part in the raising or distribution of
$420,000 in cash for the original seven defendants.
Then Sirica sent the jury from the room and questioned
Mitchell for almost 30 minutes on why it was necessary for
anyone to pay any funds to the defendants.
Sirica repeatedly pressed Mitchell, formerly the director
of the 1972 Nixon re-election committee, on the purpose
of the payments made from June 1972 to March 1973.
"What right did the Committee to Re-Elect the President
[CRP] or the Finance Committee have to pay $1... if'
they was not some obligation to these people?
"Why not say 'get out of my office, we don't owe you
any money'?"
Mitchell: "There never was any CRP money as I
understand it."
Simon Predicts Extended Recession
WASHINGTON Treasury Secretary William E. Simon
says the United States may be facing the longest recession
of the postwar period, but it doesn't require a change in
administration economic policy.
The longest previous postwar recession extended 13
months from July 1953 to August 1954. The current
recession is the sixth since World War 11.
Simon disputed the White House view that the country
is not now in a recession but is moving into one. "We're not
sinking into a recession; we're in a recession," he said in an
interview.
He said he expects the current recession will be worse in
some areas than some previous recessions, and did not rule
out entirely that it could be worst since the war.
"It might be longer than any of the recessions we've
experienced since World War 11, but it's way too early to
tell whether it will be more severe," he said.
Unemployment will rise to seven percent by late spring,
Simon said, which means about 900,000 more jobless
workers. The unemployment rate now is about six percent
of the labor force.
Speculative Sugar Trading Declines
WASHINGTON Speculators are not to blame for
quadrupling sugar prices, the president of the New York
Coffee and Sugar Exchange told a special government
hearing yesterday.
According to Earle Mac Hardy, speculative trading in the
commodity actually has declined over the past year. The
real reason for sky-rocketing prices, Mac Hardy said, is
strong competition for the 15 percent of the world's sugar
that is not consumed by producing nations or already under
contract.
Appearing before a wage and price stability panel
examining the sugar price rise, Mac Hardy cited figures
showing that the volume of trading in sugar futures has
dropped 21 percent on a daily average.
