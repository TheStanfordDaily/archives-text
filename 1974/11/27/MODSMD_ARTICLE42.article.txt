prevention of heart disease, it was
announced yesterday.
A recruiting drive continues in the
Bay Area to enlist persons with high

CORRECTIONS
Yesterday's Daily incorrectly
reported that a University staff
committee will submit a proposal to
the Board of Trustees for tuition
increase from $3375 to $3BlO for the
1974-75 academic year. It should have
read for the 1975-76 academic year.
A quote in yesterday's Daily which
said that the School of Humanities and
Sciences has been "moderately
successful" in retaining existing
faculty, was incorrectly attributed to
Robert Butler, financial manager of
the School of Medicine. It should have
been attributed to Halsey Royden,
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
