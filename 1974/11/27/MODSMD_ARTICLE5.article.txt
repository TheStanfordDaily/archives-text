# Ford Slices Budget: Hits Food Stamp Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford, apparently signaling increased
concern about a deepening recession,
abandoned yesterday his goal of
cutting this year's federal spending
below $3OO billion.
In a special message to Congress,
however, Ford did propose $4.6
billion of spending cuts that would put
estimated outlays for the current fiscal
year that began July 1 at $302.2
billion.
The bulk of the reductions would
come in programs administered by the
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare and the Veterans
Administration.
Defending a decision to seek a
cutback of only $3Bl million in
Defense Department spending, Ford
said earlier actions, largely initiated by
Congress, already have slashed $2.2
billion from anticipated defense
spending.
The government's food stamp
program, designed to help needy
Americans eat better, was the target of
a $325 million cut. Couples and
persons living alone will be hardest hit
by the food stamp cutback set to take
effect next March, agriculture officials
said. The food stamp cutback set to
take effect next March, agriculture
officials said.
The food stamp reduction will
account for one-half of a planned cut
of $650 million in USDA spending
during the fiscal year that ends next
June 30, the officials said.
The President said he would have
reached his goal of a budget under
$3OO billion except for $2.7 billion in
increased spending for aid to the
unemployed.
"It would be unwise, in my view, to
add additional dollar reductions of
each dollar of increased aid to the
unemployed," he said.
Although White House officials
now talk in terms of a recession, Ford

did not use the term in his message but
rather spoke of "slack that has
developed in some sectors of the
economy."
The President's new budget
projections are extremely "iffy," if
only because the bulk of proposed
cuts in outlays would require 135
separate actions by Congress.
Moreover, the revised budget
assumes enactment of a variety of past
administration proposals, including the
five percent income surtax Ford wants
but which has generated little
congressional enthusiasm.
