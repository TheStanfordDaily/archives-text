### JIM WASCHER 
The Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) has received a $lO,OOO grant
from the Luke B. Hancock
Foundation of Menlo Park, ARLO
Policy Board Chairman Jamie Newton
announced yesterday.
ARLO provides students with
connections to community
organizations which need help with
specific research projects and then
assists students in arranging academic
credit for their work.
Newton said the group currently is
sponsoring 50 projects "ranging from
studies in land development and
ecology to the economics of weapon
development."
Newton explained that the
Hancock Foundation "gives grants
primarily to organizations involved in
social service and education." He
added that the $lO,OOO will "enable us
to continue full scale operations which
we began this quarter on the
assumption that we would find
additional funding."
According to Newton, ARLO's
original seed money had come from
the ASSU, the University's
Community Relations Office, the
Dean of Student Affairs' Initiative
Fund and an anonymous private
donor.
Newton, who coordinated ARLO's
fund raising efforts, called the
Hancock Foundation donation "a
demonstration of interest and
confidence on the part of a
foundation, which enhances our
fundraising opportunities."
He said ARLO would maintain
contact with several other groups
which it had approached for funding
in the hope that they, too, would
make a donation. "Our efforts to find
support will continue," Newton said.
ARLO has enjoyed "lots of interest
from students and from community
action and social service concerns,"
Newton said.
"All the signals for us were green
with the exception of the financial
end. We were very close to running out
of money," he added.
