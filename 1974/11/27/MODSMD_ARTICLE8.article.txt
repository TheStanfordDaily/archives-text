## editorials The 						Rocky Vote 
### 
We are opposed to the nomination of former New York Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller to be vice president of the United States. We
believe that Rockefeller has shown neither the sound judgment nor
the moral fiber to merit his ascension to the second highest office in
the nation.
While we do not believe that a man or woman should be excluded
from high office merely because of vast personal wealth, we do feel
that such a person must undergo a great amount of scrutiny in order
to determine just how that wealth has been used. In Rockefeller's
case, we find that he has used his wealth in certain ways which we
believe are objectionable.
Although loaning or donating large sums of money to public
officials is not illegal, we think it is a matter of questionable ethics to
lend or give such sums of money to public officials whose decisions
are important to the benefactor. Rockefeller's $625,000 donation to
former New York state official William J. Ronan is only the largest in
a long list of similar gifts and loans.
Several more, ethical questions have been raised by Rockefeller's
involvement with a derogatory, anti-Semitic book written about his
1970 gubernatorial opponent, Arthur J. Goldberg. Not only is
Rockefeller's admission that he helped finance the book damaging,
but his about-face on the extent of his involvement with the book
raises an ugly spectre. During his original sworn statements before the
Senate Rules Committee, Rockefeller denied that he knew that his
money had gone for such a book. But he lated admitted knowledge
of the book, attributing his earlier statement to "faulty memory."
This brings before us again one of the most distasteful aspects of
the Watergate affair and the Nixon Administration. If a statement of
this magnitude involving Rockefeller's own personal background has
already been rendered "inoperative," how much similar behavior can
we expect if and when he becomes vice president? '
Finally, we must condemn Rockefeller's amazing display of
insensitivity during the Attica State Prison rebellion several years ago
when he was still governor of New York. Not only did he turn a deaf
ear to prisoner grievances, but he refused even to appear at the scene
of the revolt as requested by the prisoners, claiming that if he were to
bow to this request, radical causes would be encouraged in this
country. Shortly after his refusal, more than three dozen people died
when no compromise was reached.
A man who has shown the insensitivity and abuse of power
exhibited by Nelson Rockefeller during his career does not deserve to
be vice president. We are dismayed by the unanimous vote in his favor
by the Senate Rules Committee, but hope that the House Judiciary
Committee and the full Congress exercise better judgment.
