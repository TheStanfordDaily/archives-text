# New Housing Plans
## 
### 
3/e are greatly encouraged by the announcement from the
Housing Office last week that the University is planning to construct
an addition to Florence Moore Hall with spaces for 100 students.
In light of the many recent complaints that the University ignores
student input when making policy decisions, we see this proposal as a
positive step on the part of the Administration to pay attention to
student concerns and needs.
This is not to say that the plan is perfect. We see great problems
arising from a 25 percent increase in the number of students at
Florence Moore without a matching increase in eating facilities.
Perhaps an extension of Florence Moore eating hours is planned, but
Flo Mo's lines are already among the longest on campus and it seems
that any substantial increase would make the wait intolerable.
Nevertheless, problems such as these can be ironed out, and their
existence should not detract from the University's positive attempt to
help meet the needs of its students.
