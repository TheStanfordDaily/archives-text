Anatomy of a Root
Fine Canadian Leathers
The soft skins are naturally
finished, not "corrected"
by chemical additives. Inside.
Roots are lined with even
softer leather for even
greater comfort. All Roots are
crafted by Canadian Cobblers
who feel that a product made
mostly by hand will still do
the most for your feet

moves from the heel, along
the outer side of the foot

big toe. which springs you off

Recessed Heel
Walk on sand and your heel
will leave the deepest part of
your footprint. In natural
walking, most of your weight
lands on your heel. Conven
tional shoes-even low
heeled shoes-tilt you forward
and change your basic pos
ture. In Roots, your heel sinks
into a comfortable recess,
giving you a natural walk on
any kind of surface.
