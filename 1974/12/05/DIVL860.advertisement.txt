Welcome to a quiet,
beautiful wor d.
Just picture it.
You're gliding silently, quickly over a
velvety carpet of fresh snow. All around you,
the stately firs, pines and oaks loom
starkly against a perfect blue sky filled with
puffy white clouds, and every bre,ath you gulp
is of fresh clean mountain air.
No crowds. No crush.
When the snows cover the vast valleys and wide
meadows of Yosemite, it's one of the finest
cross-country skiing areas in the whole world.
And best of all, it's within easy reach
from most anywhere in California. (In fact,
the free Yosemite Shuttle Service makes it so
easy for you to get around the entire Park
that you should consider taking the bus or
train up to Yosemite in order to skip
all the bother of getting anti-freeze and
chains for your car.)
Mid-week packages.
They include accommodations at the Yosemite
Lodge starting at $16.00 per person per night
for double occupancy. Also included are an
all-day cross-country ski touring lesson,
unlimited equipment rental and use of
the ice skating rink.
More good news.
Come to Yosemite at least 2 days before any
Saturday and stay through the weekend at
the mid-week rates.
