Dear Akadama Mama, y J (x /«<_>
Did you know you're
selling your wine short. It's /-
much more than the wine /
you can mix—it's the j
wine you can eat. The / , ' — —p
other night my old lady / ~ J
took some pineapple J J S
dessert topping and / S —-
stirred in some of /
your Akadama Plum and
then poured it over pound cake and choco
late ice cream. It tasted so good my teeth
still hurt. Jim
Dear Jim,
