# Democrats May Oust ‘Tired’ Mills

### JIM WASCHER 
House Democrats apparently plan
to replace Wilbur D. Mills as chairman
of the powerful Ways and Means
Committee later this month. Mills, 65,
has played a key l role in drafting the
nation's tax, Social Security and
health insurance legislation since
assuming the chairmanship in 1958.
Speaker Carl B. Albert (D-Okla.)
was asked at a press conference
yesterday if he assumed that Mills
would not be chairman if he returns to
Congress. "I think that's a pretty
accurate statement," Albert said.
Mills entered Bethesda Naval
Medical Center Tuesday afternoon
after complaining to a House colleague
that he was "exhausted." Mills' illness
was not diagnosed, but a hospital
spokesman said he was in satisfactory
condition. Mills has suffered from
recurrent back problems in recent
months.
Earlier Tuesday, Democrats on the
Ways and Means Committee had
summoned Mills to a secret meeting,
and without a dissenting voice, told
him he would have to step down. One
informed source said they also urged
him to enter a hospital.
At first, the Arkansas Democrat
agreed, but he later decided _ to
postpone his hospitalization for one to
two weeks. Representatives then
scheduled a meeting of the House
Committee on Standards and Conduct
for yesterday.
'Unspoken Threat'
According to the San Francisco
Examiner, "the unspoken threat was
that Mills would be censured, even
expelled [from the House], if he did
not take a rest."
House Democratic leaders expect
the Democratic Caucus to elect Rep.
A1 Ullman (D-Ore.) to replace Mills as
chairman. Ullman is currently the
second ranking Democrat on Ways and
