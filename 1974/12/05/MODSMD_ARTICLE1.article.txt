# Democrats May Oust ‘Tired’ Mills
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
House Democrats apparently plan
to replace Wilbur D. Mills as chairman
of the powerful Ways and Means
Committee later this month. Mills, 65,
has played a key l role in drafting the
nation's tax, Social Security and
health insurance legislation since
assuming the chairmanship in 1958.
Speaker Carl B. Albert (D-Okla.)
was asked at a press conference
yesterday if he assumed that Mills
would not be chairman if he returns to
Congress. "I think that's a pretty
accurate statement," Albert said.
Mills entered Bethesda Naval
Medical Center Tuesday afternoon
after complaining to a House colleague
that he was "exhausted." Mills' illness
was not diagnosed, but a hospital
spokesman said he was in satisfactory
condition. Mills has suffered from
recurrent back problems in recent
months.
Earlier Tuesday, Democrats on the
Ways and Means Committee had
summoned Mills to a secret meeting,
and without a dissenting voice, told
him he would have to step down. One
informed source said they also urged
him to enter a hospital.
At first, the Arkansas Democrat
agreed, but he later decided _ to
postpone his hospitalization for one to
two weeks. Representatives then
scheduled a meeting of the House
Committee on Standards and Conduct
for yesterday.
'Unspoken Threat'
According to the San Francisco
Examiner, "the unspoken threat was
that Mills would be censured, even
expelled [from the House], if he did
not take a rest."
House Democratic leaders expect
the Democratic Caucus to elect Rep.
A1 Ullman (D-Ore.) to replace Mills as
chairman. Ullman is currently the
second ranking Democrat on Ways and
Means.
Committee members said they were
troubled, not so much by Mills'
relationship with stripper Fanne Foxe
as they were with his so-called
irrational behavior. Last weekend,
Mills visited Foxe in Boston, appeared
with her on stage and vowed to make
her a movie star.
Reform Measures
Earlier this week, the House
Democratic Caucus had passed two
reform measures which severely
curtailed Mills' previously great power

on the committee.
On Monday, the Caucus voted to
divest Ways and Means Democrats of
their power and assign Democratic
members to all other committees. On
Tuesday, they unanimously voted to
increase the membership on Ways and
Means from 25 to 37.
Under this plan, the Democrats
would increase their majority on the
committee from 15-10 to 25-12. The
caucus must also fill two Democratic
vacancies on the committee so 12
new Democrats will be assigned to
Ways and Means. Observers, including

two Political Science Department
faculty members here, expect most to
be liberals,
'Liberal Programs'
Assoc. Political Science Prof. John
F. Manley yesterday said he expects
"that the committee will become a
major source of liberal programs.
National health insurance, of probably
a more liheral variety than would have
been likely last year, some form of tax
reform package and increased
unemployment benefits will come
out" of the committee, Manley
predicted.
Manley is a noted authority both
on Mills and the Ways and Means
Committee, having served on the staff
of two of its members and later
written a book about the committee.
He said yesterday that the "20
reasonably liberal Democrats on Ways
and Means, in consultation with the
leadership of the Democratic Study
Group and the House leadership, and
linking up with the liberal labor lobby,
Common Cause and some
non-congressional Democrats, will
probably design a party program
which will have no difficulty clearing
Ways and Means and the House, and
have only some difficulty clearing the
Senate."
According to Manley, "Mills fell
from a position of enormous prestige
not seen in the House since the days of
[former Speaker] Sam Rayburn to a
laughing stock."
He also pointed out, however, that
"this is not a sudden thing. He's been
undergoing a considerable amount of
stress ever since he ran for President in
1972. Whether it's physical or
emotional or God knows what,"
Manley said, "he's simply gone over
the brink."

written a book about the committee.
He said yesterday that the "20
reasonably liberal Democrats on Ways
and Means, in consultation with the
leadership of the Democratic Study
Group and the House leadership, and
linking up with the liberal labor lobby,
Common Cause and some
non-congressional Democrats, will
probably design a party program
which will have no difficulty clearing
Ways and Means and the House, and
have only some difficulty clearing the
Senate."
According to Manley, "Mills fell
from a position of enormous prestige
not seen in the House since the days of
[former Speaker] Sam Rayburn to a
laughing stock."
He also pointed out, however, that
"this is not a sudden thing. He's been
undergoing a considerable amount of
stress ever since he ran for President in
1972. Whether it's physical or
emotional or God knows what,"
Manley said, "he's simply gone over
the brink."
House Democrats apparently plan
to replace Wilbur D. Mills as chairman
of the powerful Ways and Means
Committee later this month. Mills, 65,
has played a key l role in drafting the
nation's tax, Social Security and
health insurance legislation since
assuming the chairmanship in 1958.
Speaker Carl B. Albert (D-Okla.)
was asked at a press conference
yesterday if he assumed that Mills
would not be chairman if he returns to
Congress. "I think that's a pretty
accurate statement," Albert said.
Mills entered Bethesda Naval
Medical Center Tuesday afternoon
after complaining to a House colleague
that he was "exhausted." Mills' illness
was not diagnosed, but a hospital
spokesman said he was in satisfactory
condition. Mills has suffered from
recurrent back problems in recent
months.
Earlier Tuesday, Democrats on the
Ways and Means Committee had
summoned Mills to a secret meeting,
and without a dissenting voice, told
him he would have to step down. One
informed source said they also urged
him to enter a hospital.
At first, the Arkansas Democrat
agreed, but he later decided _ to
postpone his hospitalization for one to
two weeks. Representatives then
scheduled a meeting of the House
Committee on Standards and Conduct
for yesterday.
'Unspoken Threat'
According to the San Francisco
Examiner, "the unspoken threat was
that Mills would be censured, even
expelled [from the House], if he did
not take a rest."
House Democratic leaders expect
the Democratic Caucus to elect Rep.
A1 Ullman (D-Ore.) to replace Mills as
chairman. Ullman is currently the
second ranking Democrat on Ways and
Means.
Committee members said they were
troubled, not so much by Mills'
relationship with stripper Fanne Foxe
as they were with his so-called
irrational behavior. Last weekend,
Mills visited Foxe in Boston, appeared
with her on stage and vowed to make
her a movie star.
Reform Measures
Earlier this week, the House
Democratic Caucus had passed two
reform measures which severely
curtailed Mills' previously great power

on the committee.
On Monday, the Caucus voted to
divest Ways and Means Democrats of
their power and assign Democratic
members to all other committees. On
Tuesday, they unanimously voted to
increase the membership on Ways and
Means from 25 to 37.
Under this plan, the Democrats
would increase their majority on the
committee from 15-10 to 25-12. The
caucus must also fill two Democratic
vacancies on the committee so 12
new Democrats will be assigned to
Ways and Means. Observers, including

two Political Science Department
faculty members here, expect most to
be liberals,
'Liberal Programs'
Assoc. Political Science Prof. John

reform package and increased
unemployment benefits will come
out" of the committee, Manley
predicted.
