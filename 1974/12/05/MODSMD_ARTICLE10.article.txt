# Xmas Candidates
## 
### 
Already, Democratic Presidential hopefuls are barnstorming the
nation in search of support. And if 1976 is anything like 1972, the
party's nominee will be the candidate who most impresses political
activists and other voters during these pre-campaign swings.
In the past few months, the Stanford community has seen two
persons - Walter Mondale and Sargent Shriver who frequently have
been mentioned as possible nominees. And we'd like to see more
hopefuls people like Lloyd Bentsen and Morris Udall whose
policies and personalities are unknown to most of us.
We urge the ASSU Speaker's Bureau to put such persons (as well as
prominent Republicans) at the top of its Christmas shopping list. In
this way Stanford residents can learn enough about potential
candidates to take an active role in determining who will be elected
President.
