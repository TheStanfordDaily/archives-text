# Right To Know?

With the implementation of
the Buckley Amendment, legally
opening most confidential school
records to students, an admirable
attempt to combat excessive
secrecy in our society will be lost
in a bureaucratic morass.
The Buckley Jaw was in trouble
before it left Capitol Hill. Hastily
thought out, insufficiently
debated and poorly
conceptualized, the law provides
no guidelines for executing the
laudable goal of access to
confidential records. If Congress
hopes to salvage its high hopes for
the new law, it should postpone
adoption of the law until
adequate guidelines for its
enforcement are worked out.

University administrators for
their part have merely
exacerbated the cloudy legal
situation. In the absence of
federal guidelines for enforcement
of the law, the University has
decided to interpret the statute in
a controversial and excessively
narrow way. This desire to retain
the legal status quo, despite the
provisions of the new law, may
effectively kill the statute in its
infancy.

While the Buckley Amendment
calls for the opening of all school
records, both academic and
non-academic, both past and
present, the University is just
partially complying by disclosing
only selected records. This
half-hearted attempt to follow the

law says little for the University's
faith in the legal process.
However, the University is in a
real bind. Administrators are
faced with executing a law which
is so hopelessly vague, even its
promulgators have trouble
comprehending it. Also, the
University understandably wants
to protect the privacy of those
who have supplied previous
confidential statements.
Unfortunately, this policy runs
directly counter to a student's
right to know what has been said
about him.
In short, the Buckley
Amendment is a mess, generating
more problems than it solves. To
straighten out the tortured law,
Congress must either abandon for
the present any hopes of
enforcing the law or expeditiously
arrive at realistic guidelines for its
implementation.
While not responsible for
restructuring the law, the
University nevertheless has an
obligation not to be
obstructionist. The school should
comply with the law to the fullest
extent possible, and open all
records. The present confusion
should not be utilized to totally
ignore the spirit of the law.
