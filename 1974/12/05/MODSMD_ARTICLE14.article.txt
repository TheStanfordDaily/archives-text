# Roots Of Current Sugar Crisis
## 
### Bill Evers 
On Nov. 26, NBC Nightly News had a
feature story on sugar. The newsmen
emphasized that the sugar industry is
government regulated from farm wages to
marketing quotas and that the industry
receives millions of dollars of subsidies.
With the U.S. government's sugar program
about to undergo major revision next year, it
is worthwhile exploring the historical roots
of the current sugar situation.
The politics of sugar have a long history.
Napoleon promoted a high-cost domestic
sugar industry as a war measure. Changes in
U.S. governmental sugar policy induced the
American-born colonial elite in Hawaii in the
1890s to overthrow the native monarchy and
seek annexation of the islands to the United
States.
Existing Program
The existing U.S. government program in
sugar dates from the 19305. Its main features
are:
allocation of shares of the total U.S.
consumption requirements, as estimated by
the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, among
domestic sugar-growing areas and foreign
countries;
establishment of import quotas on raw
and refined sugar;
establishment of quotas on raw sugar
imported to the U.S. mainland from Hawaii
and Puerto Rico;
payment of subsidies to domestic
producers: and
' tariff on sugar imports.

There is no basis other than politics for the
assignment of the sugar quotas. As a result,
foreign countries invest large sums in
lobbying efforts to secure, sustain and
increase quotas.
In domestic sugar-growing regions when it
is anticipated that more sugar will be grown
than the quota allows, acreage allotments are
imposed in order to limit production, as they
have been in recent years in Louisiana and
Florida.
Agricultural economist D. Gale Johnson
points out in a detailed study published last
April that "the most protective and arbitrary
features of the sugar program are the virtual
prohibition of the importation of refined
sugar into the United States and the strict
limitation on the amount of sugar that can be
refined in Hawaii and Puerto Rico."
While under a regime of free trade very
little sugar would be grown in the U.S., the
acreage could be put to other uses relatively
quickly and thÂ£ managers and harvesters
employed in other work.
Johnson notes, however, that much of the
capital now invested in sugar processing
plants would be of little or no value if a free
trade policy were instituted. At present,
sugar consumers are paying higher prices to
sqpport this protected, high-cost refining
industry. This is a subsidy of inefficiency.
Total Cost
Johnson estimates that the annual cost of
the entire sugar program to American
consumers and taxpayers lies between $502

and $730 million.
The program yields about $lOO million in
income benefits to domestic producers.
This money comes from the effect of
quota, the effect of the tariff, and the direct
subsidy payments. (These direct payments in
recent years have been from 14 to 15 percent
of the prices received for sugar beets and 11
to 12 percent of the prices received for sugar
cane from the mainland.)
The farm subsidies and import controls
benefit a select segment of the population.
There are 21,000 sugar-producing farms in
the U.S., of these 224 produce at least a third
of the sugar. One-fourth of all the sugar is
produced on 65 farms, and these receive a
sixth of all sugar program payments.
It is likely that two-thirds of the world's
sugar production is in inappropriate places
because of government regulatory programs
like that of the United States. These
encourage production in high-cost locations
and raise the price paid by the consumer.
The American Revolution of 1778 was
precipitated in part, President John Adams
thought, because of the intransigent
rebelliousness of American consumers,
smugglers and political activists in the face of
British mercantilist tariffs and controls on
molasses sugar.
Perhaps organized public indignation could
rid us eptirely of the neo-mercantilist sugar
program we suffer from today.
