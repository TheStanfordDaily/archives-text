# New Med School Criteria Needed?
## 
### William Creger 
I feel there are two major
problems besetting medical school
admissions activities.
First, there are far too many
college students who seem to see a
morally, intellectually and
personally satisfying future only
in medicine. I believe the basic
social reason for this glut of
people choosing medical careers is
lack of availability of similarly
satisfying careers in other fields.
For example, had we a West
Point for urban planning, an Air
Force Academy for environmental
pollution or an Annapolis for
marine biology, with subsequent
related careers made possible that
were both meaningful and well
supported, our applicant pool for
U.S. medical schools would drop
by some thousands rather
promptly.
Our second major difficulty,
after the pressures on all
concerned of forty-five thousand
contestants for fourteen thousand
places, is the darkness in which
admissions committees must work
when it comes to perceiving the
attitudes and human qualities the
committees properly desire in
their medical school classes.
GPA's Increasingly Similar
These need not tye listed here,
but human understanding and
compassion, and personal stability
and unselfishness are certainly
some of them, besides the
scientific understanding and
discipline in learning which is
more easily determined by grades.
But with an increase in
indistinguishability among
students by grade point averages,
there is more need than ever
before to look to other bases for
medical school selection.
I therefore propose that the
colleges do their own selecting
among candidates for medical
school, I base this suggestion, not
a humorous one, really, on the
following arguments.
Admissions committees
currently get a quite sound idea of
which candidates can do the
academic work. Between MCAT's
and good grades at a reasonably
demanding college, the academic
issue is seldom in doubt.
It is in the attitudinal areas
that admissions committees make

errors of choice, and there is ample
evidence for that contention in
performance in clerkships and in
graduate medical education. But
the testimony about the candidate
in the attitudinal areas is, at best,
mostly obtained from highly
interested parties.
Statements Naturally Biased
We try to judge the applicant's
personal statement, usually a
cunning confession for whose bias
we cannot blame the applicant.
Then there are the letters from
college professors who probably
feel they must put their, and their
school's, products in a good light.
In addition, the professors are
selected to testify by the
candidate himself, an arrangement
not likely to let the medical
school admissions committee hear
negative views.
All the admissions committee
has of a more disinterested
character to oppose these selected
views is the medical school
interview, and few of us are
always perspicacious in that single
hour's setting.
I do believe there are people
who know much more of the
candidate's attitudes than the
admissions committee ever learns.
For example there are* the

candidate's family, his fellow
college students and some critical
faculty members not asked for
letters. But we can't and don't
want to make spies for the
admissions committee out of
these people, so I have an
alternative suggestion.
Use College's Desire
Let us make use of the
college's desire to place its
premedical students as
advantageously as possible by
giving each of a group of colleges
a fixed number of places to fill
which will add up to a class in
each of our medical schools. Or
the colleges can supply a pool of,
say, twice the size of the class,
and the admissions committee can
select one out of two of such
candidates itself it it wishes.
Under the present
arrangement, the college tries to
assess the premedical student
based on reports from the often
distant teacher-student
relationships, which the medical
school admissions committee is at
twice that distance, in that it must
also penetrate all the selling
practices employed in the
admissions transaction.
You may ask what there is to
prevent the colleges from sending

us their top grade-getters, and
attitudes be damned (after all, the
college faculties probably don't
want to spend any more time at
medical school admissions work
than the medical school faculties
do). My answer is that if a college
sent to our medical school some
psychopaths with all "A+," we
could respond by cutting down or
out that school's number of
nominations for the following
year.
Thus it might prove to the
college's interest to select
carefully, and better college
teaching and student-faculty
relations might be a sort of slow
retroflexive result. Right now, the
colleges which prepare our
medical school candidates, and are
in the best position to know and
recommend them as people, have
little responsibility for medical
school selection and suffer no
penalty if they are wrong.
I speak only for myself in the
suggestions offered above, and
would welcome written comments
from interested students or
faculty.

evidence for that contention in
performance in clerkships and in
graduate medical education. But
the testimony about the candidate
in the attitudinal areas is, at best,
mostly obtained from highly
interested parties.
Statements Naturally Biased
We try to judge the applicant's
personal statement, usually a
cunning confession for whose bias
we cannot blame the applicant.
Then there are the letters from
college professors who probably
feel they must put their, and their
school's, products in a good light.
In addition, the professors are
selected to testify by the
candidate himself, an arrangement
not likely to let the medical
school admissions committee hear
negative views.
All the admissions committee
has of a more disinterested
character to oppose these selected
views is the medical school
interview, and few of us are
always perspicacious in that single
hour's setting.
I do believe there are people
who know much more of the
candidate's attitudes than the
admissions committee ever learns.
For example there are* the

candidate's family, his fellow
college students and some critical
faculty members not asked for
letters. But we can't and don't
want to make spies for the
admissions committee out of
these people, so I have an
alternative suggestion.
Use College's Desire
Let us make use of the
college's desire to place its
premedical students as
advantageously as possible by
giving each of a group of colleges
a fixed number of places to fill
which will add up to a class in
each of our medical schools. Or
the colleges can supply a pool of,
say, twice the size of the class,
and the admissions committee can
select one out of two of such
candidates itself it it wishes.
Under the present
arrangement, the college tries to
assess the premedical student
based on reports from the often
distant teacher-student
relationships, which the medical
school admissions committee is at
twice that distance, in that it must
also penetrate all the selling
practices employed in the
admissions transaction.
You may ask what there is to
prevent the colleges from sending

us their top grade-getters, and
attitudes be damned (after all, the
college faculties probably don't
want to spend any more time at
medical school admissions work
than the medical school faculties
do). My answer is that if a college
sent to our medical school some
psychopaths with all "A+," we
could respond by cutting down or
out that school's number of
nominations for the following
year.
Thus it might prove to the
college's interest to select
carefully, and better college
teaching and student-faculty
relations might be a sort of slow
retroflexive result. Right now, the
colleges which prepare our
medical school candidates, and are
in the best position to know and
recommend them as people, have
little responsibility for medical
school selection and suffer no
penalty if they are wrong.
I speak only for myself in the
suggestions offered above, and
would welcome written comments
from interested students or
faculty.
(William P. Creger is associate
dean for student affairs and a
member of the admissions
committee at the Medical School.)
I feel there are two major
problems besetting medical school
admissions activities.
First, there are far too many
college students who seem to see a
morally, intellectually and
personally satisfying future only
in medicine. I believe the basic
social reason for this glut of
people choosing medical careers is
lack of availability of similarly
satisfying careers in other fields.
For example, had we a West
Point for urban planning, an Air
Force Academy for environmental
pollution or an Annapolis for
marine biology, with subsequent
related careers made possible that
were both meaningful and well
supported, our applicant pool for
U.S. medical schools would drop
by some thousands rather
promptly.
Our second major difficulty,
after the pressures on all
concerned of forty-five thousand
contestants for fourteen thousand
places, is the darkness in which
admissions committees must work
when it comes to perceiving the
attitudes and human qualities the
committees properly desire in
their medical school classes.
GPA's Increasingly Similar
These need not tye listed here,
but human understanding and
compassion, and personal stability
and unselfishness are certainly
some of them, besides the
scientific understanding and
discipline in learning which is
more easily determined by grades.
But with an increase in
indistinguishability among
students by grade point averages,
there is more need than ever
before to look to other bases for
medical school selection.
I therefore propose that the
colleges do their own selecting
among candidates for medical
school, I base this suggestion, not
a humorous one, really, on the
following arguments.
Admissions committees
currently get a quite sound idea of
which candidates can do the
academic work. Between MCAT's
and good grades at a reasonably
demanding college, the academic
issue is seldom in doubt.
It is in the attitudinal areas
that admissions committees make

errors of choice, and there is ample
evidence for that contention in
performance in clerkships and in
graduate medical education. But

relationships, which the medical
school admissions committee is at
twice that distance, in that it must
also penetrate all the selling
practices employed in the
admissions transaction.
You may ask what there is to
prevent the colleges from sending

us their top grade-getters, and
attitudes be damned (after all, the
college faculties probably don't
want to spend any more time at
medical school admissions work
than the medical school faculties
do). My answer is that if a college
sent to our medical school some
psychopaths with all "A+," we
could respond by cutting down or
out that school's number of
nominations for the following
year.
Thus it might prove to the
college's interest to select
carefully, and better college
teaching and student-faculty
relations might be a sort of slow
retroflexive result. Right now, the
colleges which prepare our
medical school candidates, and are
in the best position to know and
recommend them as people, have
little responsibility for medical
school selection and suffer no
penalty if they are wrong.
I speak only for myself in the
suggestions offered above, and
would welcome written comments
from interested students or
faculty.
(William P. Creger is associate
dean for student affairs and a

committee at the Medical School.)
I feel there are two major
problems besetting medical school
admissions activities.
First, there are far too many
college students who seem to see a
morally, intellectually and
personally satisfying future only
in medicine. I believe the basic
social reason for this glut of
people choosing medical careers is
lack of availability of similarly
satisfying careers in other fields.
For example, had we a West
Point for urban planning, an Air
Force Academy for environmental
pollution or an Annapolis for
marine biology, with subsequent
related careers made possible that
were both meaningful and well
supported, our applicant pool for
U.S. medical schools would drop
by some thousands rather
promptly.
Our second major difficulty,
after the pressures on all
concerned of forty-five thousand
contestants for fourteen thousand
places, is the darkness in which
admissions committees must work
when it comes to perceiving the
attitudes and human qualities the
committees properly desire in
their medical school classes.
GPA's Increasingly Similar
These need not tye listed here,
but human understanding and
compassion, and personal stability
and unselfishness are certainly
some of them, besides the
scientific understanding and
discipline in learning which is
more easily determined by grades.
But with an increase in
indistinguishability among
students by grade point averages,
there is more need than ever
before to look to other bases for
medical school selection.
I therefore propose that the
colleges do their own selecting
among candidates for medical
school, I base this suggestion, not
a humorous one, really, on the
following arguments.
Admissions committees
currently get a quite sound idea of
which candidates can do the
academic work. Between MCAT's
and good grades at a reasonably
demanding college, the academic
issue is seldom in doubt.
It is in the attitudinal areas
that admissions committees make

errors of choice, and there is ample
evidence for that contention in
performance in clerkships and in
graduate medical education. But
the testimony about the candidate
in the attitudinal areas is, at best,
mostly obtained from highly
interested parties.
Statements Naturally Biased
We try to judge the applicant's
personal statement, usually a
cunning confession for whose bias
we cannot blame the applicant.
Then there are the letters from
college professors who probably
feel they must put their, and their
school's, products in a good light.
In addition, the professors are
selected to testify by the
candidate himself, an arrangement
not likely to let the medical
school admissions committee hear
negative views.
All the admissions committee
has of a more disinterested
character to oppose these selected
views is the medical school
interview, and few of us are
always perspicacious in that single
hour's setting.
I do believe there are people
who know much more of the
candidate's attitudes than the
admissions committee ever learns.
For example there are* the

candidate's family, his fellow
college students and some critical
faculty members not asked for
letters. But we can't and don't
want to make spies for the
admissions committee out of
these people, so I have an
alternative suggestion.
Use College's Desire
Let us make use of the
college's desire to place its
premedical students as
advantageously as possible by
giving each of a group of colleges
a fixed number of places to fill
which will add up to a class in
each of our medical schools. Or
the colleges can supply a pool of,
say, twice the size of the class,
and the admissions committee can
select one out of two of such
candidates itself it it wishes.
Under the present
arrangement, the college tries to
assess the premedical student
based on reports from the often
distant teacher-student
relationships, which the medical
school admissions committee is at
twice that distance, in that it must
also penetrate all the selling
practices employed in the
admissions transaction.
