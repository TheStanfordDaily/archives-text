# Support UFW's Struggle
## 
### Judy Hogness 
Farm workers are striking the Sunkist lemon
ranch in Yuma, Arizona, asking for union
recognition and a contract between the grower and
the United Farm Workers.
In a brilliant and imaginative move to stem the
easy flow of wetback labor as strikebreakers a
particular hazard, since Yuma is so close to the
Mexican border the UFW has set up a line of
tents 100 yards apart along the border. These tents
are within sight and voice distance of each other
and are manned 24 hours a day.
This tactic has effectively dried up the flow of
wetbacks along that line. Sunkist needs 2500 lemon
pickers; last week Father Eugene Boyle flew over
the ranch in a helicbpter and counted only some
400 workers.
So the strike and the "border patrol" are
successfully keeping workers from the harvest, and
now the violence begins. Recently 18 peaceful
pickets were arrested, eight of them maced, by

sheriff's deputies in Yuma County.
Fearing a repeat of the summer of 1973 in
which violence by Teamsters, growers and sheriffs'
deputies escalated until two farm workers were
killed, UFW President Cesar Chavez has send an
urgent plea to the public: please send telegrams or
mailgrams protesting this brutality and urging
negotiation. Send them to:
—the man who decided to break the strike with
violence: Mike Smith, Yuma County Attorney, 168
S. 2nd Ave., Yuma, Ariz., 85364;
—the man whose deputies set up a road block to
bar the pickets' return to their cars, and maced and
arrested them: Sheriff Yancey, Yuma County, 256
W. 2nd St., Yuma, Ariz., 85364;
—the company that owns the ranch, and lowered
wages this season from $lB to $l4 a box,
precipitating the strike: Sunkist Growers, Inc.,
4130 Riverside Dr., Sherman Oaks, Calif., 91403.
