# Against Illegal Aliens
## 
### Anthony Harrigan 
America was settled by people
from many parts of the world.
Immigrants from the British Isles,
Germany, Poland, Southern and
Central Europe cleared the forests
and built America's canals,
railroads and cities. David
Thoreau, the 19th century
New England writer, said, only
half in jest, that there was a dead
Irishman under every railway tie.
But times have changed. The
United States has been filled out.
In many urban areas, there is
severe overcrowding. The need
now is to halt immigration except
for those with special skills
required by the country.
The serious problem, however,
is not the legal immigration but
the flood of people entering this
country illegally. Atty. Gen.
William Saxbe recently called for
the deportation of one million
illegal aliens next year and said
their impact on the country
constitutes "a severe national
crisis."
If one million illegal aliens are
deported, that action will only
touch the problem. The U.S.
Immigration Service believes there
could be as many as 12 million
illegal aliens in America. New
York City may have one-twelfth
of that population.
'Colossal Burdens'
These illegal aliens impose
colossal burdens on the citizens of
the United States. They hold
down jobs with an annual payroll
of more than $lO billion. They
absorb social services at a
tremendous rate.
The U.S. government must deal
with this illegal alien problem this
year. The illegal aliens are
swarming across our borders.
They enter on student visas and,
as Saxbe noted, "go underground
and vanish when their visits
officially expire." Many people
from the Caribbean Islands travel
to Puerto Rico and pass as Puerto
Ricans who are free to enter the
U.S.
Understandably, the United
States is a powerful magnet,
attracting people from the
Caribbean, India, Mexico and
elsewhere. Indian doctors, for
example, enjoy the high incomes
they can obtain in the United
States. They are unwilling to
return to their homeland in South
Asia which is desperately in need
of medical practitioners.
The United States cannot
continue to absorb vast numbers
of aliens. It cannot continue to
permit illegal residence in this
country. As the U.S. enters a
period of economic recession, it
will need to husband its resources.
A Global Problem
To some degree the problem of
illegal immigration is a global one.
A good part of Britain's current
difficulties are the result of
unrestricted immigration from the
former British colonies. Indeed,
the character of Britain has been
somewhat compromised by the
influx of people from Trinidad,
Pakistan and other lands with
different cultural traditions and
standards.
Switzerland and other
advanced European countries are
concerned about the influx of
workers from Southern Europe.
Holland, for example, has a
problem with Turkish workers.
But the European countries
have begun to clamp down. They
are taking steps to curb the flow
of foreign workers and reduce the
number of aliens in their midst.
Migrations are nothing new in
history. For thousands of years,
people have moved across
frontiers in search of food or
wealth. These movements are
taking place in our own time. But
realism should dictate to
Americans that it is necessary to
prevent illegal population
movements across our national
borders. The jobs available in the
U.S. should go to Americans not
to illegal aliens.
Dealing with the illegal alien
problem should be a priority item
for the 94th Congress.
