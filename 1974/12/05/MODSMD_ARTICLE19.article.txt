# Hungerquakes' To Rock World
## 
### Ramesh Agarwal 
Historically, whenever one or more
nations has undergone a political, social or
economic crisis, only two points of view have
been presented as to the cause of the crisis.
These two points of view have been put
forward by two groups, each blaming the
other for the crisis.
There is never a consensus on the root
causes of such a crisis during its initial,
formative states. And almost always, one
point of view not necessarily a correct one
seems to gain respectability among the
masses, depending on the political
propaganda and the press. Only in the end,
and sometimes many years after, does a clear,
historical perspective emerge.
Ironically fitting the pattern, the current
world food crisis has also generated two
opinions as to its main cause. One opinion
comes from those believing the rhetoric of
the overfed nations, the other from those
sympathetic to the sufferings of. the "starving
nations. The recent Daily opinion columns
by Kim Nyegaard (Nov. 18) and Tim Knaak
(Nov. 26) respectively represent these view
points.
Again ironically, as is clear from the
outcome of the World Food Conference in

Rome, no constructive plan has emerged to
combat the harrowing world food crisis. Each
side accuses the other; the affluent nations
blame the poor for overpopulation,
backwardness and inefficiency, while the
poor nations blame the rich for their
continued economic exploitation during the
colonial and post-colonial periods.
Will Crisis Deepen?
And it is quite evident that no
constructive plan of action is likely to emerge
until, perhaps, the crisis further deepens and
takes the toll of a few more million human
beings. After all, such plan would necessarily
require some measure of austerity, fair
economic cartels and withdrawal of support
of socially unjust regimes on the part of
advanced nations.
And it would require measures of birth
control, social transformation and massive
agricultural efforts by less developed nations.
Such measures, however, could mean
political suicide for the leadership (which is
usually short-term anyway) in both types of
nations.
It appears from the outset that any
constructive plan should include short-term
as well as long-term solutions.

Understandably, the key to providing
short-term solutions is in the hands of those
nations with surpluses of food and oil. They
can move to counter existing famines while a
long-term plan acceptable to the majority of
nations is worked out by the entire world
community.
Current Situation Grim
However, the situation at the moment
looks very grim. Already hundreds of
thousands of humans have died of starvation
and malnutrition in the politically less
volatile regions of Africa. And now the arms
of the crisis are encircling the politically
more volatile nations of Asia and South
America.
As the dimension of the crisis increases,
more and more alarm bells are ringing. But
no serious effort to stave off the crisis before
it fulfills pessimistic forecasts is in sight.
Let us hope that this time the leaders of
the destiny of mankind will truly work in the
Utopian spirit to meet this challenge before
the hungerquakes in Asia, Africa and South
America rock the world.

Again ironically, as is clear from the
outcome of the World Food Conference in

Rome, no constructive plan has emerged to
combat the harrowing world food crisis. Each
side accuses the other; the affluent nations
blame the poor for overpopulation,
backwardness and inefficiency, while the
poor nations blame the rich for their
continued economic exploitation during the
colonial and post-colonial periods.
Will Crisis Deepen?
And it is quite evident that no
constructive plan of action is likely to emerge
until, perhaps, the crisis further deepens and
takes the toll of a few more million human
beings. After all, such plan would necessarily
require some measure of austerity, fair
economic cartels and withdrawal of support
of socially unjust regimes on the part of
advanced nations.
And it would require measures of birth
control, social transformation and massive
agricultural efforts by less developed nations.
Such measures, however, could mean
political suicide for the leadership (which is
usually short-term anyway) in both types of
nations.
It appears from the outset that any
constructive plan should include short-term
as well as long-term solutions.

Understandably, the key to providing
short-term solutions is in the hands of those
nations with surpluses of food and oil. They
can move to counter existing famines while a
long-term plan acceptable to the majority of
nations is worked out by the entire world
community.
Current Situation Grim
However, the situation at the moment
looks very grim. Already hundreds of
thousands of humans have died of starvation
and malnutrition in the politically less
volatile regions of Africa. And now the arms
of the crisis are encircling the politically
more volatile nations of Asia and South
America.
As the dimension of the crisis increases,
more and more alarm bells are ringing. But
no serious effort to stave off the crisis before
it fulfills pessimistic forecasts is in sight.
Let us hope that this time the leaders of
the destiny of mankind will truly work in the
Utopian spirit to meet this challenge before
the hungerquakes in Asia, Africa and South
America rock the world.

Historically, whenever one or more
nations has undergone a political, social or
economic crisis, only two points of view have
been presented as to the cause of the crisis.
These two points of view have been put
forward by two groups, each blaming the
other for the crisis.
There is never a consensus on the root
causes of such a crisis during its initial,
formative states. And almost always, one
point of view not necessarily a correct one
seems to gain respectability among the
masses, depending on the political
propaganda and the press. Only in the end,
and sometimes many years after, does a clear,
historical perspective emerge.
Ironically fitting the pattern, the current
world food crisis has also generated two
opinions as to its main cause. One opinion
comes from those believing the rhetoric of
the overfed nations, the other from those
sympathetic to the sufferings of. the "starving
nations. The recent Daily opinion columns
by Kim Nyegaard (Nov. 18) and Tim Knaak
(Nov. 26) respectively represent these view
points.
