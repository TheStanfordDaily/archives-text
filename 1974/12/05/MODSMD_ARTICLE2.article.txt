# IFC Delays Decision On Housing Proposals
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
has decided not to support any
specific housing proposal at present,
IFC President Mike Nilsson announced
last night.
The IFC will wait until Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Larry Horton and
the Committee on Student Services
(COSS) subcommittee on residences
make a recommendation to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons before it
takes any more action, Nilsson said.
The Council had announced in past
meetings that it would decide by last
night whether to support one specific

housing proposal or make no
recommendation until Horton and the
subcommittee finalized their
proposals.
Council members unanimously
agreed, however, that "the University
must change its discriminatory policy,
but the fraternities in themselves are
not discriminatory. We're not denying
women any privilege; it's the
University," Nilsson continued.
A petition last February by
students from Alpha Sigma Phi
prompted the decision to change the
housing system, Lyons said.
University Discrimination?
The students complained that the
University discriminates against
women because it forces
co-educational fraternities to join the
draw, while male fraternities remain
draw-exempt.
Nilsson reiterated his hope that the
University can solve the discriminatory
housing policy without forcing the
fraternities to give up their
draw-exempt privilege.
He conceded, though, "This is what
we want but what's going to happen is
a different story."
The subcommittee has already
limited its considerations to two
proposals Haight and Salego both
of which would include fraternities in
the draw, subcommittee co-chairman
Bill Rifkin declared.
'Share The Shortage'
He explained the subcommittee has
decided that "all the students in the
University should share the housing
shortage" and that no students should
enjoy draw-exempt status.
The subcommittee will make its
recommendation to President Richard
Lyman during the first week of winter
quarter, Rifkin declared.
But Lyons disagreed. "I think the
decision will be made in my office,"
he said.
He said it is "highly likely that the
University, through some fair method,
will decide who lives on campus since
there is not enough housing for
everybody. Where they will live on
campus will be a matter of student
choice."
Lyons also remarked that the
University would probably not revive
sororities on campus as a means of
combating the housing dilemma
because "there is no lasting interest
among students. There has been a
long-term trend of dwindling interest
in single-sex housing."
Lyons explained that weak
fraternities "are being kept alive by
the housing shortage."

limited its considerations to two
proposals Haight and Salego both
of which would include fraternities in
the draw, subcommittee co-chairman
Bill Rifkin declared.
'Share The Shortage'
He explained the subcommittee has
decided that "all the students in the
University should share the housing
shortage" and that no students should
enjoy draw-exempt status.
The subcommittee will make its
recommendation to President Richard
Lyman during the first week of winter
quarter, Rifkin declared.
But Lyons disagreed. "I think the
decision will be made in my office,"
he said.
He said it is "highly likely that the
University, through some fair method,
will decide who lives on campus since
there is not enough housing for
everybody. Where they will live on
campus will be a matter of student
choice."
Lyons also remarked that the
University would probably not revive
sororities on campus as a means of
combating the housing dilemma
because "there is no lasting interest
among students. There has been a
long-term trend of dwindling interest
in single-sex housing."
Lyons explained that weak
fraternities "are being kept alive by
the housing shortage."
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
has decided not to support any
specific housing proposal at present,
IFC President Mike Nilsson announced
last night.
The IFC will wait until Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Larry Horton and
the Committee on Student Services
(COSS) subcommittee on residences
make a recommendation to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons before it
takes any more action, Nilsson said.
The Council had announced in past
meetings that it would decide by last
night whether to support one specific

housing proposal or make no
recommendation until Horton and the
subcommittee finalized their
proposals.
Council members unanimously
agreed, however, that "the University
must change its discriminatory policy,
but the fraternities in themselves are
not discriminatory. We're not denying
women any privilege; it's the
University," Nilsson continued.
A petition last February by
students from Alpha Sigma Phi
prompted the decision to change the
housing system, Lyons said.
University Discrimination?
The students complained that the
University discriminates against
women because it forces
co-educational fraternities to join the
draw, while male fraternities remain
draw-exempt.
Nilsson reiterated his hope that the
University can solve the discriminatory
housing policy without forcing the
fraternities to give up their
draw-exempt privilege.
He conceded, though, "This is what
we want but what's going to happen is
a different story."
The subcommittee has already
