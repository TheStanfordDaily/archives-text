Nuclear Engineering Extant
Editor:
In the Nov. 26 Daily, Vice
Provost Raymond Bacchetti and
Dean Halsey Royden are quoted
as saying that during the 1969-74
Budget Adjustment Program, the
quality of " the University's
academic programs was
maintained by eliminating "weak"
programs like speech instruction
and nuclear engineering altogether
from the University's budget.
Since there are now about a dozen
students studying for graduate
degrees in nuclear engineering, we
want to assure them and others
that we still have something of a
program, and that the report of

our demise has been at least
somewhat exaggerated.
As a result of BAP decisions in
1972, the University's nuclear
reactor was shut down, one
untenured faculty member was let
go, and the Nuclear Engineering
Division of the Department of
Mechanical Engineering was
abolished, its remaining faculty
joining another division within the
Mechanical Engineering
Department. The number of
nuclear engineering courses was
reduced, but enough courses are
still offered to maintain a viable
nuclear engineering option offered
in conjunction with other
programs in the Mechanical
Engineering Department.
The program two or three
years ago was financially weak, in
part because of massive Federal
(AEC) cutbacks in nuclear
engineering graduate student
support and also because the
reactor was too costly to maintain
in terms of the amount of
research funding it attracted. We
do not believe, however, that the
nuclear engineering program was
ever academically weak from
the point of view of the quality of
its course offerings, research or its
reputation in the profession, and
it would be unfortunate if this
implication is drawn from the
Daily story.

'Heartfelt Thanks'
Editor:
My wife and I would like to
express our heartfelt thanks to the
students and staff of Lagunita
who so graciously gave of their
time and effort during the recent
fire at our apartment. At 8 a.m.
the morning after the fire there
were students helping to remove
the debris and to salvage what was
left of our personal effects. They
worked tirelessly in helping the
University staff to start renovating
our apartment and moved us to

our temporary quarters in
Escondido Village.
Of course it goes without
saying that without the Stanford
Fire Department all would be lost
and we wish to thank them for
their efforts which too often seem
to be taken for granted.

Sororities Have Their Place
Editor:
Sororities have long been a
dead issue at Stanford. Many
would call it for the better, and
shudder at the idea of female
Greeks on campus. The myth of a
sorority which arises in their
minds seems to have no place on
Stanford's campus today.
A sorority does have its place
on Stanford's campus, though. It
can be to the Stanford
community and to its own
members whatever its members
wish to make it not just a
perpetuation of the stereotyped
sorority. It offers advantages to its
members which even the
University committee in 1943
recommending the abolishment of
sororities recognized:
"1) The benefit of small living
groups composed of women who
have elected to live with each
other and who, for the most part,
govern themselves;
2) The influence of national
sororities with their programs of
stimulating group responsibility,
developing leadership and
promoting high standards of
scholarships;
3) The advantages derived from
close association with sorority
sisters in other universities;
4) The helpful influence of
alumnae."
To the Stanford community,
sororities would offer another
option in housing, a continuity
living group with broad interests
and the cohesion to activate these
interests. Sororities would shift
the present University housing
arrangements towards a more

equitable system for women, and
they would provide the University
with closer alumnae ties.
The myth and the stereotype
of a sofority deserve to be
destroyed by the existence of live
and functioning sororities,
contributing not only to the
personal growth of their members
but also to the growth of the
Stanford community.

'Cycle Of Terror'
Editor:
In his column of Nov. 25, Jim
Wascher implied that Israel was
willing to see an independent
Palestinian state established on
the West Bank of the Jordan.
There is no evidence that such is
the case. Last September Premier
Yitzhak Rabin said that an
independent state in the occupied
territories would be "the
beginning of the end of the Jewish
state" and that the Israeli position
was one of "no establishment of a
Palestinian state -but a
confrontation from a position of
strength."
The same day that column
appeared, Israel's information
minister said that someday there
might be negotiations with the
people of the West Bank
concerning "gradual stages, of
local autonomy," but not until
"the people living in the
territories see that our presence
there is firm and undoubted."
Earlier this month King Hussein
of Jordan explained that Israel's
persistent refusal to negotiate over
the West Bank left him' no
alternative but to support the
Palestine Liberation Organization.

The PLO has made some
extravagant demands, but until
Israel agrees to negotiate with its
representatives, the current cycle
of terror and counter-terror in the
Middle East is bound to continue.
