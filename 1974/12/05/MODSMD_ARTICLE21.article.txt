## 'The Art And Science Of Wine' Wine Tasting For Academic Credit? 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Most professors receive a round
of. applause before students close
their notebooks on the last class
lecture of the quarter. But for the
teacher of Undergraduate Special
04 there was the clinking of wine
glasses and a toast.
: "Let's toast to Rich for putting
up with us," exclaimed one
student, raising her glass to drink
to Richard Peers, a 1974 graduate
in- history who teaches a course
called "The Art and Science of
Wine."
"It's not a mick," says Jenny
Jewell, one of 23 students
enrolled in the course.
To earn three units of pass/no
credit for the class, students must
choose and read a textbook on
wine, write a short paper on a
wine-related topic, go wine-tasting
on.their own at least once, pass a
wine-tasting final and take notes
during lectures and tasting
sessions. Peers grades students'
lecture notes as well as papers and
written finals.
In spite of the workload,
students look forward to
Thursday evening class sessions in
the; main lounge of Florence
Moore Hall.

Lecture topics have included
viticulture (the growing of
grapes), enology (the process of
making wine), and the history of
wihe-making. "Tonight," Peers
announces at the last class session
of the quarter, "we'll talk about
champagnes."
His talk includes both fact and
folklore: "They say champagne
gets you there fastest and keeps
you there longest it's a fun
drjnk."
Tasting begins when Peers
opens a bottle of Franzia
champagne, a non-vintage-dated
California wine produced by an
undistinguished bulk method.
"See what it's like for s2,'' Peers
says as he passes the bottle to a
student.

The wine-tasters fill their
stemmed wine glasses, sip and
take notes. "The most important
thing you can do is look at the
bubbles," Peers advises. "Notice
that as you taste the wine."
"This is a big night," comments
student wine-taster Vivian Krai,
glancing at the foil-crowned tops
of bottles that protrude from a
styrofoam cooling chest, "We've
got nine different champagnes."
One of them is a $26.25 bottle
of 1966 vintage champagne,
produced in France by Moet et
Chandon. "Look for the yeasty
flavor and the aftertaste and for
$26.25 they should give you a
damn good aftertaste," Peers
points out.
Tasting Fees
Peers estimates the average cost
of the 80-85 bottles used in class
session at $5-7 each. At the
beginning of the quarter he
collected $25 from each
participant to cover wine costs.
He plans to refund the $l5O he
didn't spend to the students.
Although he receives no pay for
teaching the Undergraduate
Special course, Peers thinks his
position as a Stanford wine
teacher helped him land a job at a
wine and cheese store on El
Camino Real.
Peers turned down an
opportunity to enroll at Harvard
Law School this fall. "I'm a West
Coast boy," he explains, and
eventually he hopes to study law
at Stanford.
Before he begins the paper
chase, Peers plans to travel to
Europe "to taste wine for a lot
less money" than he can in the
U.S.
"I want the students to gain
appreciation for the differences in
types of wines and learn the basics
of tasting," he says. For the final
exam, Peers will ask students to
taste four red and four white
wines and identify the grape
variety and country of origin for
each sample.

But the changes that occur in
the class atmosphere during the
tasting sessions don't depend on
the type of wine the group is
drinking. Over red and white
wines from France, Germany,
Spain or Italy, voices get louder,
faces redden, students leave their
seats on red naugahyde couches
and lounge on the shag carpet.
Tough Assignment
"We're supposed to write down
descriptions of the wine but it's
hard to do after a few glasses."
claims one student. "About the
fourth or fifth glass we stop
saying 'it's acidic' or 'it's
brick-colored' and just say, 'it's
wine.' "
The taste of fine French wine
reminds some students of their
experiences abroad. Somebody
asks, "How do you burp in
French?"
Peers provides instant answers
to many questions. When a
student wants to learn how to

open a bottle of champagne "just
like Cary Grant," Peers
demonstrates the proper
technique of twisting the bottle,
not the cork.
Officially, all students in the
course are over 21, says Peers,
who doesn't require participants
to present identification.
However, one student recalls that
she was asked for her driver's
license when she signed up for the
class on registration day.
Asked why she enrolled in the
course, a student replied. "Why
not? We all need a little culture."
But whether or not they can tell
the difference between a 1947
Chateauneuf du Pape and 1974
Franzia, students in Peers' class
share their teacher's enjoyment of
the art and science of wine.
"The year on the label isn't
what's important," Peers tells
them. "Drink wine by how it
tastes to you."

of the quarter, "we'll talk about
champagnes."
His talk includes both fact and
folklore: "They say champagne
gets you there fastest and keeps
you there longest it's a fun
drjnk."
Tasting begins when Peers
opens a bottle of Franzia
champagne, a non-vintage-dated
California wine produced by an
undistinguished bulk method.
"See what it's like for s2,'' Peers
says as he passes the bottle to a
student.

The wine-tasters fill their
stemmed wine glasses, sip and
take notes. "The most important
thing you can do is look at the
bubbles," Peers advises. "Notice
that as you taste the wine."
"This is a big night," comments
student wine-taster Vivian Krai,
glancing at the foil-crowned tops
of bottles that protrude from a
styrofoam cooling chest, "We've
got nine different champagnes."
One of them is a $26.25 bottle
of 1966 vintage champagne,
produced in France by Moet et
Chandon. "Look for the yeasty
flavor and the aftertaste and for
$26.25 they should give you a
damn good aftertaste," Peers
points out.
Tasting Fees
Peers estimates the average cost
of the 80-85 bottles used in class
session at $5-7 each. At the
beginning of the quarter he
collected $25 from each
participant to cover wine costs.
He plans to refund the $l5O he
didn't spend to the students.
Although he receives no pay for
teaching the Undergraduate
Special course, Peers thinks his
position as a Stanford wine
teacher helped him land a job at a
wine and cheese store on El
Camino Real.
Peers turned down an
opportunity to enroll at Harvard
Law School this fall. "I'm a West
Coast boy," he explains, and
eventually he hopes to study law
at Stanford.
Before he begins the paper
chase, Peers plans to travel to
Europe "to taste wine for a lot
less money" than he can in the
U.S.
"I want the students to gain
appreciation for the differences in
types of wines and learn the basics
of tasting," he says. For the final
exam, Peers will ask students to
taste four red and four white
wines and identify the grape
variety and country of origin for
each sample.

But the changes that occur in
the class atmosphere during the
tasting sessions don't depend on
the type of wine the group is
drinking. Over red and white
wines from France, Germany,
Spain or Italy, voices get louder,
faces redden, students leave their
seats on red naugahyde couches
and lounge on the shag carpet.
Tough Assignment
"We're supposed to write down
descriptions of the wine but it's
hard to do after a few glasses."
claims one student. "About the
fourth or fifth glass we stop
saying 'it's acidic' or 'it's
brick-colored' and just say, 'it's
wine.' "
The taste of fine French wine
reminds some students of their
experiences abroad. Somebody
asks, "How do you burp in
French?"
Peers provides instant answers
to many questions. When a
student wants to learn how to

open a bottle of champagne "just
like Cary Grant," Peers
demonstrates the proper
technique of twisting the bottle,
not the cork.
Officially, all students in the
course are over 21, says Peers,
who doesn't require participants

However, one student recalls that
she was asked for her driver's
license when she signed up for the
class on registration day.
Asked why she enrolled in the
course, a student replied. "Why
not? We all need a little culture."
But whether or not they can tell
the difference between a 1947
Chateauneuf du Pape and 1974
Franzia, students in Peers' class
share their teacher's enjoyment of

"The year on the label isn't
what's important," Peers tells
them. "Drink wine by how it

and Vivian Krai note the strengths and weaknesses of this classroom sample of champagne. After sampling
nine wines in one class session, Krai commented, "Thursday nights are always shot no good for
homework."
Most professors receive a round
of. applause before students close
their notebooks on the last class
lecture of the quarter. But for the
teacher of Undergraduate Special
04 there was the clinking of wine
glasses and a toast.
: "Let's toast to Rich for putting
up with us," exclaimed one
student, raising her glass to drink
to Richard Peers, a 1974 graduate
in- history who teaches a course
called "The Art and Science of
Wine."
"It's not a mick," says Jenny
Jewell, one of 23 students
enrolled in the course.
To earn three units of pass/no
credit for the class, students must
choose and read a textbook on
wine, write a short paper on a
wine-related topic, go wine-tasting
on.their own at least once, pass a
wine-tasting final and take notes
during lectures and tasting
sessions. Peers grades students'
lecture notes as well as papers and
written finals.
In spite of the workload,
students look forward to
Thursday evening class sessions in
the; main lounge of Florence
Moore Hall.

Lecture topics have included
viticulture (the growing of
grapes), enology (the process of
making wine), and the history of
wihe-making. "Tonight," Peers
announces at the last class session
of the quarter, "we'll talk about
champagnes."
His talk includes both fact and
folklore: "They say champagne
gets you there fastest and keeps
you there longest it's a fun
drjnk."
Tasting begins when Peers
opens a bottle of Franzia
champagne, a non-vintage-dated
California wine produced by an
undistinguished bulk method.
"See what it's like for s2,'' Peers
says as he passes the bottle to a
student.

The wine-tasters fill their
stemmed wine glasses, sip and
take notes. "The most important
thing you can do is look at the
bubbles," Peers advises. "Notice
that as you taste the wine."
"This is a big night," comments
student wine-taster Vivian Krai,
glancing at the foil-crowned tops
of bottles that protrude from a
styrofoam cooling chest, "We've
got nine different champagnes."
One of them is a $26.25 bottle
of 1966 vintage champagne,
produced in France by Moet et
Chandon. "Look for the yeasty
flavor and the aftertaste and for
$26.25 they should give you a
damn good aftertaste," Peers
points out.
Tasting Fees
Peers estimates the average cost
of the 80-85 bottles used in class
session at $5-7 each. At the
