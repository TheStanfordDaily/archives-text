# Dance Specialist Generates Enthusiasm Among Chicanos, Native Americans
## 
### BARBARA LANE 
"His personality oozes philosophy. It
makes his dance class very different." "He
makes us aware that we've been doing
everything necessary in dance all our lives."
That's what his students say about Juan
Valenzuela, a joint teaching specialist in
Physical Education and lecturer in Drama
who is generating new enthusiasm for the
creative arts here, particularly among
Chicano and Native American students.
A graceful, softspoken, man, Valenzuela
comments on the role of the Chicano and
Indian as artist: "The performing arts as
introduced by the Europeans are separate
from life itself. For Chcianos and Indians, the
performing arts have been an intimate part of
our lives. It is hard for our parents to think
of us becoming professional artists. They
want doctors and lawyers."
Valenzuela was brought to Stanford
through the efforts of Faculty Affirmative
Action, specifically Chicano Faculty
Recruitment. "There is an attempt to
increase the number of high quality people
among the minorities" says Susan Horst,
assistant to the vice provost for faculty
affairs. "It is hoped that Chicanos and Native
Americans will gravitate toward Juan," she
added.
Artist In Residence
Now an artist in residence at Stanford for
one year, Valenzuela came from Santa Fe
where he teaches dance at the Institute of
American Indian Arts. "Stanford is very

exciting compared to Santa Fe," he observed.
Describing himself as a "Mexican-Indian"
Valenzuela says, "I don't know what the
word 'Chicano' means." He contends he is
"sympathetic" to Chicano and Indiana
activity on campus, but "not involved. I say
things through art, not on the soap box," he
explains.
Known for his work in children's dance,
Valenzuela is a Movement Specialist for the
Artists in Schools Program of the National
Endowment for the Arts. With his associate,
John Wakeland, Valenzuela visits elementary
and junior high schools throughout the
country teaching movement to children and
holding teacher's workshops.
Dance Education
"I teach the children to realize that their
bodies are marvelous instruments" says
Valenzuela. "Dance becomes a tool of
education and promoting self expression," he
adds.
Students should be exposed to dance
movement at an early age, Valenzuela
maintains. Those who finally decide to major
in dance when they enter universities have to
start at the beginning and never reach the
advanced level, he explains.
Although his own dance career did not
begin until the age of 16 when he started tap
dancing, Valenzuela claims "I was born to
dance. It is something I always wanted to
do." He experimented with various dance
forms and discovered he was able to make
more statements through the medium of

modern dance.
Valenzuela's former teachers include
Martha Graham, Jose Limon, and Louis
Horst. A great admirer of Martha Graham, he
describes her as "disciplined and
professional." "I learned to philosophize
from Miss Graham and from my mother" he
says.
At the beginning of each dance class,
Valenzuela puts a quotation on the board to
"make students think and feel and do. Dance
awakens deep things the student can't talk
about," he believes.
Valenzuela and Wakeland are frequent
visitors at Zapata, the Latin American theme
house. Arturo Pacheco, faculty resident
there, says Valenzuela "serves as a role model
for students as there are few older Chicano
professors around." He has offered dance
workshops at Zapata.
"Juan excels in presenting the 'sentido' of
Native American and Chicano movements"
says Ramon Flores, resident associate at
Zapata and member of the Dance I class.
"People feel really good about him. His
concepts are an expression of Native
American values," according to Katherine
Graham, resident advisor at Gavilan, the
Native American theme house.
He is well received by the Native
American community at Stanford, and
although only a few students are taking his
class this quarter, Graham feels that many
more will probably become involved next
quarter.

Valenzuela reflects on his Aztec
heritage: "Winter was the time when
the history of our tribe was taught to
ys, the rural tradition was handed
down. In this tradition of our
ancestors I would like to see a new
form of Indian theatre dance-drama
given birth, to be created and
performed in all aspects by our young
people in the reservations during the
winter months."
Universal Medium
"We should use theatre not
political or biased for universality"
says Valenzuela.
"I would like to see Chicanos and
Indians contribute from their heritages
to the culture of the United States,"
says Valenzuela. "We are part of
America."
Valenzuela's feelings are perhaps
best expressed in an address he
presented to the Committee On
Research in Dance in 1972: "My roots
are Indian. I am an American branch.
My students and creative dances are
the blossoms that will produce new
reeds which will create new roots,
branches and blossoms."

visitors at Zapata, the Latin American theme
house. Arturo Pacheco, faculty resident
there, says Valenzuela "serves as a role model
for students as there are few older Chicano
professors around." He has offered dance
workshops at Zapata.
"Juan excels in presenting the 'sentido' of
Native American and Chicano movements"
says Ramon Flores, resident associate at
Zapata and member of the Dance I class.
"People feel really good about him. His
concepts are an expression of Native
American values," according to Katherine
Graham, resident advisor at Gavilan, the
Native American theme house.
He is well received by the Native
American community at Stanford, and
although only a few students are taking his
class this quarter, Graham feels that many
more will probably become involved next
quarter.

Valenzuela reflects on his Aztec
heritage: "Winter was the time when
the history of our tribe was taught to
ys, the rural tradition was handed
down. In this tradition of our
ancestors I would like to see a new
form of Indian theatre dance-drama
given birth, to be created and
performed in all aspects by our young
people in the reservations during the
winter months."
Universal Medium
"We should use theatre not
political or biased for universality"
says Valenzuela.
"I would like to see Chicanos and
Indians contribute from their heritages
to the culture of the United States,"
says Valenzuela. "We are part of
America."
Valenzuela's feelings are perhaps
best expressed in an address he
presented to the Committee On
Research in Dance in 1972: "My roots
are Indian. I am an American branch.
My students and creative dances are
the blossoms that will produce new
reeds which will create new roots,
branches and blossoms."
"His personality oozes philosophy. It
makes his dance class very different." "He
makes us aware that we've been doing
everything necessary in dance all our lives."
That's what his students say about Juan
Valenzuela, a joint teaching specialist in
Physical Education and lecturer in Drama
who is generating new enthusiasm for the
creative arts here, particularly among
Chicano and Native American students.
A graceful, softspoken, man, Valenzuela
comments on the role of the Chicano and
Indian as artist: "The performing arts as
introduced by the Europeans are separate
from life itself. For Chcianos and Indians, the
performing arts have been an intimate part of
our lives. It is hard for our parents to think
of us becoming professional artists. They
want doctors and lawyers."
Valenzuela was brought to Stanford
through the efforts of Faculty Affirmative
Action, specifically Chicano Faculty
Recruitment. "There is an attempt to
increase the number of high quality people
among the minorities" says Susan Horst,
assistant to the vice provost for faculty
affairs. "It is hoped that Chicanos and Native
Americans will gravitate toward Juan," she
added.
Artist In Residence
Now an artist in residence at Stanford for
one year, Valenzuela came from Santa Fe
where he teaches dance at the Institute of
American Indian Arts. "Stanford is very

exciting compared to Santa Fe," he observed.
Describing himself as a "Mexican-Indian"
Valenzuela says, "I don't know what the
word 'Chicano' means." He contends he is
"sympathetic" to Chicano and Indiana
activity on campus, but "not involved. I say
things through art, not on the soap box," he
explains.
Known for his work in children's dance,
Valenzuela is a Movement Specialist for the
Artists in Schools Program of the National
Endowment for the Arts. With his associate,
John Wakeland, Valenzuela visits elementary
and junior high schools throughout the
country teaching movement to children and
holding teacher's workshops.
Dance Education
"I teach the children to realize that their
bodies are marvelous instruments" says
Valenzuela. "Dance becomes a tool of
education and promoting self expression," he
adds.
Students should be exposed to dance
movement at an early age, Valenzuela
maintains. Those who finally decide to major
in dance when they enter universities have to
start at the beginning and never reach the
advanced level, he explains.
Although his own dance career did not
begin until the age of 16 when he started tap
dancing, Valenzuela claims "I was born to
dance. It is something I always wanted to
do." He experimented with various dance
forms and discovered he was able to make
more statements through the medium of

modern dance.
Valenzuela's former teachers include
Martha Graham, Jose Limon, and Louis
Horst. A great admirer of Martha Graham, he
describes her as "disciplined and
professional." "I learned to philosophize
from Miss Graham and from my mother" he
says.
At the beginning of each dance class,
Valenzuela puts a quotation on the board to
"make students think and feel and do. Dance
awakens deep things the student can't talk
about," he believes.

Valenzuela says, "I don't know what the
word 'Chicano' means." He contends he is
"sympathetic" to Chicano and Indiana
activity on campus, but "not involved. I say
things through art, not on the soap box," he
explains.
Known for his work in children's dance,
Valenzuela is a Movement Specialist for the
Artists in Schools Program of the National
Endowment for the Arts. With his associate,
John Wakeland, Valenzuela visits elementary
and junior high schools throughout the
country teaching movement to children and
holding teacher's workshops.
Dance Education
"I teach the children to realize that their
bodies are marvelous instruments" says
Valenzuela. "Dance becomes a tool of
education and promoting self expression," he
adds.
Students should be exposed to dance
movement at an early age, Valenzuela
maintains. Those who finally decide to major
in dance when they enter universities have to
start at the beginning and never reach the
advanced level, he explains.
Although his own dance career did not
begin until the age of 16 when he started tap
dancing, Valenzuela claims "I was born to
dance. It is something I always wanted to
do." He experimented with various dance
forms and discovered he was able to make
more statements through the medium of

modern dance.
Valenzuela's former teachers include
Martha Graham, Jose Limon, and Louis
Horst. A great admirer of Martha Graham, he
describes her as "disciplined and
professional." "I learned to philosophize
from Miss Graham and from my mother" he
says.
At the beginning of each dance class,
Valenzuela puts a quotation on the board to
"make students think and feel and do. Dance
awakens deep things the student can't talk
about," he believes.
Valenzuela and Wakeland are frequent
visitors at Zapata, the Latin American theme
house. Arturo Pacheco, faculty resident
there, says Valenzuela "serves as a role model
for students as there are few older Chicano
professors around." He has offered dance
workshops at Zapata.
"Juan excels in presenting the 'sentido' of
Native American and Chicano movements"
says Ramon Flores, resident associate at
Zapata and member of the Dance I class.
"People feel really good about him. His
concepts are an expression of Native
American values," according to Katherine
Graham, resident advisor at Gavilan, the
Native American theme house.
He is well received by the Native
American community at Stanford, and
although only a few students are taking his
class this quarter, Graham feels that many
more will probably become involved next
quarter.

Valenzuela reflects on his Aztec
heritage: "Winter was the time when
the history of our tribe was taught to
ys, the rural tradition was handed
down. In this tradition of our
ancestors I would like to see a new
form of Indian theatre dance-drama
given birth, to be created and
performed in all aspects by our young
people in the reservations during the
winter months."
Universal Medium
"We should use theatre not
political or biased for universality"
says Valenzuela.
"I would like to see Chicanos and
Indians contribute from their heritages
to the culture of the United States,"
says Valenzuela. "We are part of
America."
Valenzuela's feelings are perhaps
best expressed in an address he
presented to the Committee On
Research in Dance in 1972: "My roots
are Indian. I am an American branch.
My students and creative dances are
the blossoms that will produce new
reeds which will create new roots,
branches and blossoms."
"His personality oozes philosophy. It
makes his dance class very different." "He
makes us aware that we've been doing
everything necessary in dance all our lives."
That's what his students say about Juan
Valenzuela, a joint teaching specialist in
Physical Education and lecturer in Drama
who is generating new enthusiasm for the
creative arts here, particularly among
Chicano and Native American students.
A graceful, softspoken, man, Valenzuela
comments on the role of the Chicano and
Indian as artist: "The performing arts as
introduced by the Europeans are separate
from life itself. For Chcianos and Indians, the
performing arts have been an intimate part of
our lives. It is hard for our parents to think
of us becoming professional artists. They
want doctors and lawyers."
Valenzuela was brought to Stanford
through the efforts of Faculty Affirmative
Action, specifically Chicano Faculty
Recruitment. "There is an attempt to
increase the number of high quality people
among the minorities" says Susan Horst,
assistant to the vice provost for faculty
affairs. "It is hoped that Chicanos and Native
Americans will gravitate toward Juan," she
added.
Artist In Residence
Now an artist in residence at Stanford for
one year, Valenzuela came from Santa Fe
where he teaches dance at the Institute of
American Indian Arts. "Stanford is very

exciting compared to Santa Fe," he observed.
