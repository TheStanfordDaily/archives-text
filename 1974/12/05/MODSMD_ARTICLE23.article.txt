# The 						Little Old Wine-Taster At Stanford-In-France
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Having drunk with knowledge {and
therefore wisely) the man of the valley
leaves his cellar with steady eyes, unlike
some visitors to the district.
â€”from the Michelin Guide
to the Cheateaux of the Loire
The authors of the Michelin guide
probably never have encountered Rene
Loyeau. But they point out that some
people make two tours of the France's
Loire Valley: that of the chateaus and
that of the wine cellars.
During the past 10 years over 1000
Stanford students have begun the latter
tour in Loyeau's cave at Rochecorbon,
about six miles from the Overseas
Studies Center in Tours, France.
Wine-tasting adventures begin less
than 24 hours after a new group of
students arrives in Tours. The bus
crosses the Loire River to tackle the
slopes of the Vouvray vineyards: on the
right side of the highway, the spires of
St. Gatien's cathedral preside over the
burnished-gray Loire; to the left, the
13th century Abbaye of Marmoutier
evokes the memory of St. Martin, a
patron saint of the region who founded
vineyards as well as monasteries.
Until the bus turns off at a narrow
side road and stops midway up a hill,
few passengers pay much attention to
Loyeau, a small grandfatherly

Frenchman who sits near the front of
the bus.
Grardfatheriy Frenchman
Wearing a scarf neatly tucked
between the lapels of his plaid woolen
coat, he glances at the students with the
precise discretion of a conscientious
restauranteur sizing up the gastronomic
sophistication of his clientele.
At the entrance to his cave, Loyeau
stoops to pick a fragrant yellow flower
from the chalky rocks. With a chivalrous
flourish he presents it to the young
woman who heads the line of would-be
wine-tasters.
He leads the pilgrimage into the
cave's earthy darkness, illustrating his
comments with sharp, birdlike gestures.
His fast-flowing French communicates
the enthusiasm of a connaisseur who
delights in his wine and in his work.
History And Humor
Loyeau's account of the history and
traditions of French viticulture is
peppered with what he thinks are
humorous >.?. asides. Few students
understand the jokes, but everyone
laughs at Loyeau's low chuckle the
"heh-heh-heh" that TV buffs associate
with Tyrone F. Hornai's approach to a
prudish Gladys on the Laugh-In park
bench.
Loyeau either doesn't speak English
or knows well how to keep a secret.

When one listener's face flickers a vague
understanding of his remarks, Loyeau
looks straight into her eyes and
continues gesturing and speaking in
French.
The three-room subterranean cave,
he explains, is a natural cavern enlarged
by the linear incisions of stone
quarrymen seeking building materials
for the nearby towns.
Students who left their coats and
sweaters in the bus quickly discover one
advantage of subterranean wine storage
a dependable year-round temperature
of 12 degrees centigrade.
Cave Child
The cold doesn't seem to bother
Loyeau. Born in Vernou 78 years ago
when most of the inhabitants still lived
.in the rocks, he literally grew up in the
cave of his father, a hotel-keeper and
wine merchant. Loyeau, too, is a dealer
in fine wines, un negociant en vins fins.
He could probably open his cellar to
the public as a regional wine museuam:
layers of dust testify to the age of 1947
sauternes and bourgognes, and the
Vouvrays of 1858, 1893 and 1921.
"One harvests a great year every 50
years, a very good year every 10 years, a
good year like 1973 every five
years and a really disasterous year every
10 years. But I don't think the Touraine
region has produced a superior wine

since 1947," Loyeau tells visitors to his
cave.
He dispalys a bottle of 1874 Vouvray
"just to prove it can be done." But he is
proud of his skill in tasting wines and
emphasizes that the real enjoyment of a
vintage wine is not in possessing it, but
in tasting it.
Degustation
At Loyeau's request the well-chilled
students find seats on the rough wooden
benches that form a jagged circle around
a low table covered with an immaculate
white cloth. Loyeau produces an exact
number of stemmed wine glasses from a
nearby carton, careful to include one
for himself and counting several times
just to make certain.
Even the bare electric bulb overhead
seems to brighten as he asks the
question each student has been
anticipating: "Now, what do you want
to drink?"
The verdict? a relatively young
Vouvray sec.
Chez Loyeau, wine-tasting is a ritual.
He uncorks the bottles with painstaking
care, skillfully extracting the stopper in
one pice to prevent any contamination
of,the wine. A mellow pop, followed by
Loyeau's grin and another
"heh-heh-heh," finally breaks a long
moment of silence.
The wine expert explains that the first step in
appraising fine wine is like appraising a fine woman
first, you must look at her. After shaking his glass
to insure a thorough marriage of wine and oxygen,
he savors the bouquet in a long sniff. Finally he
tastes the wine, sticking it into his mouth through
pursed lips, rolling it around his tongue, abruptly
spitting the mouthful onto the earthen floor, and
pronouncing a favorable judgment.
The students imitate the procedure except for
the spitting.
Loyeau claims that his taste for wine is so well
developed that he can distinguish the year and the
vine-plant of almost any wine specimen by analyzing
only its color and its scent.
"It's a question of professional experience," he
shrugs. "Sometimes you can tell the temperature of
the wine in the glass."
Acquired Skills
He acquired his skill by a circuitous route. At age
seven, he conducted wine-brokers through his
father's cellars. "I liked to accompany these men in
the cellars," he remembers. "It developed my taste
for fine things.
However, at 13 he was apprenticed as a wigmaker
and spent five years learning his trade.
In 1916, Loyeau left for the battlefields of World
War I. He re-entered the wine business after he
returned from combat and succeeded at
the head of the Hotel des Negotiants in Tours.
But World War II forced another modification in

his "metier." The hotel was destroyed by bombs
and he opened a small bar under the same sign in
the center of Tours.
"I sold my wine, and I went all over France
trading 100,000 bottles each year," he recalls
proudly.
Today In Tours
The Cafe des Negotiants still stands on the Rue
Bertholet, just off the "main drag" of Tours, the
Rue Nationale.
Although Loyeau sold the bar several years ago,
he and his family still surround it: Loyeau lives in
the apartment above the cafe; one of his sons
operates a food store on one side; the second son
owns the tobacco and magazine shop across the
street.
Loyeau now devotes all his time to his cave with
a dedication that paraphrases the old proverb: "A
man's cave is his castle." Her permits only friends,
clients and Stanford students to enter his domain.
"Je m'occupe de ma cave, moi," he says with an
expansive wave of his hand.
Loyeau personally selects his own stock. At
annual tasting/selling marathons he samples up to
2000 wines in a week.
Never Too Much
He claims he has tasted wines from every year
since 1797, yet has never been drunk in his life.
Overindulgence, he says, hardens one's tasting
faculties.

"No machine could replace the human senses,"
he says emphatically. "If somebody tries to puzzle
me, only rarely am I unable to figure out what I am
tasting. But I am tricked by capitalization and
commercialization. One can only really judge
natural wines."
Visitors from Stanford who ask Loyeau's opinion
of California wines hear a discourse on the
differences between Californian and French wine
production in torrential French.
The virtue of French wine is its variety, Loyeau
explains. He praises the consistant quality of
California wine, but laments its monotony.
Not Cheap
The wines in Loyeau's cave are not notable for
either monotony or economy. Yet, he generously
taps a barrel of 1947 Chateauneuf du Pape and
uncorks $2l bottles of Fine Vouvray when he
entertains the curious but untrained palates of
Stanford students.
At 78, Loyeau remains as lively as a vin
mousseaux. And after toasting to my health, my
family's health and my ancestors, health with
several glasses of Vouvray sec, I promised him that
if I ever became rich, I would stock my own cellar
with the wines that bear the ornate gold label of his
cave.
Loyeau put his arm around me in a
grandfatherly way and advised, "Hurry up, my
dear. Heh-heh-heh."
