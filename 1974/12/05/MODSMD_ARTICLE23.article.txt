# The Little Old Wine-Taster At Stanford-In-France
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Having drunk with knowledge {and
therefore wisely) the man of the valley
leaves his cellar with steady eyes, unlike
some visitors to the district.
â€”from the Michelin Guide
to the Cheateaux of the Loire
The authors of the Michelin guide
probably never have encountered Rene
Loyeau. But they point out that some
people make two tours of the France's
Loire Valley: that of the chateaus and
that of the wine cellars.
During the past 10 years over 1000
Stanford students have begun the latter
tour in Loyeau's cave at Rochecorbon,
about six miles from the Overseas
Studies Center in Tours, France.
Wine-tasting adventures begin less
than 24 hours after a new group of
students arrives in Tours. The bus
crosses the Loire River to tackle the
slopes of the Vouvray vineyards: on the
right side of the highway, the spires of
St. Gatien's cathedral preside over the
burnished-gray Loire; to the left, the
13th century Abbaye of Marmoutier
evokes the memory of St. Martin, a
patron saint of the region who founded
vineyards as well as monasteries.
Until the bus turns off at a narrow
side road and stops midway up a hill,
few passengers pay much attention to
Loyeau, a small grandfatherly

Frenchman who sits near the front of
the bus.
Grardfatheriy Frenchman
Wearing a scarf neatly tucked
between the lapels of his plaid woolen
coat, he glances at the students with the
precise discretion of a conscientious
restauranteur sizing up the gastronomic
sophistication of his clientele.
At the entrance to his cave, Loyeau
stoops to pick a fragrant yellow flower
from the chalky rocks. With a chivalrous
flourish he presents it to the young
woman who heads the line of would-be
wine-tasters.
He leads the pilgrimage into the
cave's earthy darkness, illustrating his
comments with sharp, birdlike gestures.
His fast-flowing French communicates
the enthusiasm of a connaisseur who
delights in his wine and in his work.
History And Humor
Loyeau's account of the history and
traditions of French viticulture is
peppered with what he thinks are
humorous >.?. asides. Few students
understand the jokes, but everyone
laughs at Loyeau's low chuckle the
"heh-heh-heh" that TV buffs associate
with Tyrone F. Hornai's approach to a
prudish Gladys on the Laugh-In park
bench.
Loyeau either doesn't speak English
or knows well how to keep a secret.

When one listener's face flickers a vague
understanding of his remarks, Loyeau
looks straight into her eyes and
continues gesturing and speaking in
French.
The three-room subterranean cave,
he explains, is a natural cavern enlarged
by the linear incisions of stone
quarrymen seeking building materials
for the nearby towns.
Students who left their coats and
sweaters in the bus quickly discover one
advantage of subterranean wine storage
a dependable year-round temperature
of 12 degrees centigrade.
Cave Child
The cold doesn't seem to bother
Loyeau. Born in Vernou 78 years ago
when most of the inhabitants still lived
.in the rocks, he literally grew up in the
cave of his father, a hotel-keeper and
wine merchant. Loyeau, too, is a dealer
in fine wines, un negociant en vins fins.
He could probably open his cellar to
the public as a regional wine museuam:
layers of dust testify to the age of 1947
sauternes and bourgognes, and the
Vouvrays of 1858, 1893 and 1921.
"One harvests a great year every 50
years, a very good year every 10 years, a
good year like 1973 every five
years and a really disasterous year every
10 years. But I don't think the Touraine
region has produced a superior wine

since 1947," Loyeau tells visitors to his
cave.
He dispalys a bottle of 1874 Vouvray
"just to prove it can be done." But he is
proud of his skill in tasting wines and
emphasizes that the real enjoyment of a
vintage wine is not in possessing it, but
in tasting it.
Degustation
At Loyeau's request the well-chilled
students find seats on the rough wooden
benches that form a jagged circle around
a low table covered with an immaculate
white cloth. Loyeau produces an exact
number of stemmed wine glasses from a
nearby carton, careful to include one
for himself and counting several times
just to make certain.
Even the bare electric bulb overhead
seems to brighten as he asks the
question each student has been
anticipating: "Now, what do you want
to drink?"
The verdict? a relatively young
Vouvray sec.
Chez Loyeau, wine-tasting is a ritual.
He uncorks the bottles with painstaking
care, skillfully extracting the stopper in
one pice to prevent any contamination
of,the wine. A mellow pop, followed by
Loyeau's grin and another
"heh-heh-heh," finally breaks a long
moment of silence.
