# Needed: New Perspectives On Energy
## Visiting Expert Stresses Interdisciplinary Approach To Problems 
### STEPHEN M. SOBLE 
When Dr. Richard A. Gonzalez
looks out of his office window he
sees a steely blue-gray blanket of
smog over the San Jose hills.
As a visiting professor of
energy economics this quarter in
the Applied Earth Sciences
department, he has spent much of
his time lobbying for
interdisciplinary approaches to
real-world energy and
environmental problems.
Previous academic approaches
to the study of energy have been
bogged down in "regional

peculiarities and local
circumstances," Gonzales says.
"The three E's are energy,
economics and the environment,"
he explains, and they're as basic
to understanding today's
problems as the three R's.
"We need a variety of energy
centers around the country with
staff and students moving toward
a rounded perspective of the total
problem," Gonzalez suggests.
The Gonzalez approach may
get its first application here in the
near future. The Applied Earth
Sciences Department and the

Stanford Institute for Energy
Studies, a clearinghouse for
energy-related work, are
proposing the creation of a
program in Resource Economics
and Development. The new
program is expected to get off the
ground in September, 1975.
Creative Approach
Even with the current
economic problems facing the
university, Gonzalez and others
are confident a creative approach
to energy problems can be
funded.
"The people at Stanford who
are after research dollars go where
the money lies," noted one
observer.
So far, Stanford University has
received nearly $1 million from
Standard Oil of California for
financial aid to students, and the
visiting professor program in
which Gonzalez is participating.
In addition to lending his
advice on the establishment of a
fuel resources program, Gonzalez
"gets a lot of people to recognize
the breadth and complexity of the
entire resource situation," said
Richard Jahns, dean of the
Applied Earth Sciences
Department.
Gonzalez believes that a
fundamental factor has been
overlooked in the current push for
more mass transit. "No- study has
been conducted to determine
what the average man really
wants, or whether hell really use
mass transit," he says.
Impractical Solution
"Mass transit may be another
noble experiment like prohibition
good for the people, but they
won't buy it," Gonzales claims.
According to Gonzalez, the
niche of the automobile in
American life is so complex that
stiff gasoline taxes or engine size
regulations may cripple the
economy and increase
unemployment.
"Abrupt changes always
produce unhappy people" is one
of Gonzalez's guiding principles.
As a government consultant,
Gonzalez has urged a major shift
in domestic gasoline consumption
but by gradual steps.

"We can have a gas tax and a
tax on auto weight, but the tax
should be modest at first, and
gradually, annually increase over
the next 10 to 15 years,"
says Gonzalez.
Incremental Change
Failure to adopt long-range
guidelines with cautiously
implemented solutions has been
the main problem of the
government role in the energy,
economics and environmental
fields, Gonzalez's says.
"The failure to plan our cities
has resulted in crowded inner
cities and sprawling suburbs which
inefficiently use energy and create
environmental problems," he
argues.
Furthermore, government
regulation of natural gas prices has
been so misdirected "that now we

are faced with the anomalous
situation where we import natural
gas at three times the government
fixed price" while there is no
supply shortage of gas. "It's just
uneconomical to produce
domestic gas," notes Gonzalez.
"Since our politicians are
interested in getting re-elected,
our system places a premium on
short-term solutiorfs," observes
Gonzalez.
He believes that social
scientists and physical scientists
should overcome the political and
life-style differences that have
separated them in the past. "To
solve human, political and legal
aspects of resource development
more people will have to get
exposed to something beyond
their narrow speciality," muses
Gonzalez.

advice on the establishment of a
fuel resources program, Gonzalez
"gets a lot of people to recognize
the breadth and complexity of the
entire resource situation," said
Richard Jahns, dean of the
Applied Earth Sciences
Department.
Gonzalez believes that a
fundamental factor has been
overlooked in the current push for
more mass transit. "No- study has
been conducted to determine
what the average man really
wants, or whether hell really use
mass transit," he says.
Impractical Solution
"Mass transit may be another
noble experiment like prohibition
good for the people, but they
won't buy it," Gonzales claims.
According to Gonzalez, the
niche of the automobile in
American life is so complex that
stiff gasoline taxes or engine size
regulations may cripple the
economy and increase
unemployment.
"Abrupt changes always
produce unhappy people" is one
of Gonzalez's guiding principles.
As a government consultant,
Gonzalez has urged a major shift
in domestic gasoline consumption
but by gradual steps.

"We can have a gas tax and a
tax on auto weight, but the tax
should be modest at first, and
gradually, annually increase over
the next 10 to 15 years,"
says Gonzalez.
Incremental Change
Failure to adopt long-range
guidelines with cautiously
implemented solutions has been
the main problem of the
government role in the energy,
economics and environmental
fields, Gonzalez's says.
"The failure to plan our cities
has resulted in crowded inner
cities and sprawling suburbs which
inefficiently use energy and create
environmental problems," he
argues.
Furthermore, government
regulation of natural gas prices has
been so misdirected "that now we

are faced with the anomalous
situation where we import natural
gas at three times the government
fixed price" while there is no
supply shortage of gas. "It's just
uneconomical to produce
domestic gas," notes Gonzalez.
"Since our politicians are
interested in getting re-elected,
our system places a premium on
short-term solutiorfs," observes
Gonzalez.
He believes that social
scientists and physical scientists
should overcome the political and
life-style differences that have
separated them in the past. "To
solve human, political and legal
aspects of resource development
more people will have to get
exposed to something beyond
their narrow speciality," muses
Gonzalez.

ENERGY ECONOMIST—Richard Gonzalez, a visiting professor here
this quarter, believes that solutions to energy problems will evolve
through interdisciplinary study in the "three E's." A private
consultant to both government and industry, Gonzalez is interested in
developing the University's ability to contribute to long-range
problem solving.
When Dr. Richard A. Gonzalez
looks out of his office window he
sees a steely blue-gray blanket of
smog over the San Jose hills.
As a visiting professor of
energy economics this quarter in
the Applied Earth Sciences
department, he has spent much of
his time lobbying for
interdisciplinary approaches to
real-world energy and
environmental problems.
Previous academic approaches
to the study of energy have been
bogged down in "regional

peculiarities and local
circumstances," Gonzales says.
"The three E's are energy,
economics and the environment,"
he explains, and they're as basic
to understanding today's
problems as the three R's.
"We need a variety of energy
centers around the country with
staff and students moving toward
a rounded perspective of the total
problem," Gonzalez suggests.
The Gonzalez approach may
get its first application here in the
near future. The Applied Earth
Sciences Department and the

Stanford Institute for Energy
Studies, a clearinghouse for
energy-related work, are
proposing the creation of a
program in Resource Economics
and Development. The new
program is expected to get off the
ground in September, 1975.
Creative Approach
Even with the current
economic problems facing the
university, Gonzalez and others
are confident a creative approach
to energy problems can be
funded.
"The people at Stanford who
are after research dollars go where
the money lies," noted one
observer.
So far, Stanford University has
received nearly $1 million from
Standard Oil of California for
financial aid to students, and the
visiting professor program in
which Gonzalez is participating.
In addition to lending his
advice on the establishment of a
fuel resources program, Gonzalez
"gets a lot of people to recognize
the breadth and complexity of the
entire resource situation," said

gas at three times the government
fixed price" while there is no
supply shortage of gas. "It's just
uneconomical to produce
domestic gas," notes Gonzalez.
"Since our politicians are
interested in getting re-elected,
our system places a premium on
short-term solutiorfs," observes
Gonzalez.
He believes that social
scientists and physical scientists
should overcome the political and
life-style differences that have
separated them in the past. "To
solve human, political and legal
aspects of resource development
more people will have to get
exposed to something beyond
their narrow speciality," muses
Gonzalez.

consultant to both government and industry, Gonzalez is interested in
developing the University's ability to contribute to long-range
problem solving.
