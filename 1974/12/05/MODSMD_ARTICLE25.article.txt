# Bill Stone: The President's Man Aids Lyman With Wit, Capability
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
President Richard Lyman stands in
the doorway of Bill Stone's office and
says tensely, "Bill, may I see you a
moment?"
Stone, Lyman's assistant, leans back
in his chair, yawns, stretches and
answers, "Oh I guess so" as he ambles
to his feet.
"That puts them both at ease and
they start talking from there,'? explains
Noel Kolak, office supervisor for the
president and provost.
She ends her scenario with the
comment, "That is uniquely him
[Stone] his ability to depressurize
situations."
Most people who work with Stone
echo a comment by Vice Provost
Robert Rosenzweig, "He brings wit
and irony to his work. He has a
detached and sensible point of view on
most issues."
Change In Plans
Stone didn't intend to become a
University administrator. After he
graduated from Stanford in 1967 he
enrolled in the Graduate School of
Business. "My family had been
bankers," Stone explains. "I was never
allowed to assume I would do
otherwise. Then I looked around at
what bankers and businessmen are
like."
Stone's plans to work for the state
of Illinois changed when the Student
Affairs staff asked him to be assistant
dean and business manager.
"That was the year of Cambodia
and many wrenching problems," says
Stone. While dealing with the crises
Stone became acquainted with
then-Provost Lyman who "eventually
became president and asked me to be
his assistant."
His explanation completed, Stone
leans back in his swivel chair, loafers
barely touching the floor, and takes a
moment for a sip of coffee. He looks
small behind his large, cluttered desk.'
The window is open behind his head.
Two upholstered chairs face his desk.
Half a dozen coffee mugs sit on the
bookshelves to his left for visitors.
The President's Man
Stone likens his duties to those
performed by former White House
aides Haldeman and Ehrlichman:
representing Lyman's views to other
people and other's views to Lyman. "I
try to see that Mr. Lyman gets involved
only in those things that require his
participation so he doesn't have to
do everything twice," explains Stone.
Robert Freelen of University
Relations comments that Stone "does
an excellent job in terms of getting
information from the president's office
to other people in the institution" and
vice versa. "He knows the University

very well."
Stone was surprised at first that so
many people feel they have to talk to
Lyman to get something done. "My
feelings moved from curiosity to
annoyance. But you have to be patient
with people."
Organizational behavior the
business class that Stone liked least
"has turned out to be the most
valuable," he observes. "This
institution is incredibly complex.
There is no shared idea of what the
purpose is.. . You work problems
through a whole variety of
constituencies and in many cases it's
difficult just to keep people talking to
one another."
Busy Days
In one typical day Stone will talk to
six or eight drop-in visitors, read and
outline Lyman's mail, speak with 10 or
12 people on the telephone, draft letters
for the president, confirm speaking
engagements, write a text for an
awards ceremony and take care of the
Christmas card list.
He arrives via bicycle at 7:30
a.m. to have an hour before the phone
starts ringing and people start arriving
and "just to get organized and collect
my thoughts."
Stone tries to be as accessible as
possible. He answers his own phone,
keeps his door open at all times and
avoids standing commitments which
would keep him inflexibly tied up.
"I like it to be thought that there's
someone here people can reach," he
explains. "It is important that people
really aren't stalled on things they're
interested in that they can get
answers."
Keeping In Touch
Also in an effort to keep in contact
with students, Stone was a resident in
Stern Hall for three years. He met his
wife Alice while teaching a SWOPSI
course ("She got an A in the course.")
They moved out of the dorm but
stayed on campus in a house "so it
would be easy to come and go and easy
for students to come and go in our
house," says Stone.
He adds that they didn't want to
give up the turmoil of campus. "With
the ever present challenge of ideas it's
hard to be complacent. I come from a
small town in Illinois which looks
pretty pallid in comparison."
Stone sees working with Lyman as
one of the greatest challenges of his
job. "He's one of the most remarkable
and demanding individuals I've worked
for. . . He really focuses on the quality
of ideas."
Stone, however, recognizes that
"It's a good idea for the University
president to change the palace guard
every few years. .. It can't be healthy

to have everything filtering through
the same eyes and ears all the time,"
explains Stone.
Stone thinks someone else should
have a chance at his job, partly because
he has become so comfortable with it.
"What's most important for me is to be
under pressure over my head this
particular situation isn't meeting that
test anymore."

No 'Game Plan'
Stone can't predict when he'll clear
off his desk. "Sooner rather than
later. .. I'm not somebody who has a
clear game plan of what I want to do
with my life. The two jobs I've had
since I graduated were pretty
unexpected."
At the moment he is coordinating
career plans with Alice and asking
"what kind of circumstances would
duplicate this type of challenge?"
Because Stone has been at Stanford
since his undergraduate days many
people ask him, "When are you going
out in the real world and prove
yourself?"

He answers that with the "variety of
things going on here, the richness of
the community, the campus is no less
narrow than other places you could be
this is an exhilarating place to be."

"which is sometimes more important than what is put across."
President Richard Lyman stands in
the doorway of Bill Stone's office and
says tensely, "Bill, may I see you a
moment?"
Stone, Lyman's assistant, leans back
in his chair, yawns, stretches and
answers, "Oh I guess so" as he ambles
to his feet.
"That puts them both at ease and
they start talking from there,'? explains
Noel Kolak, office supervisor for the
president and provost.
She ends her scenario with the
comment, "That is uniquely him
[Stone] his ability to depressurize
situations."
Most people who work with Stone
echo a comment by Vice Provost
Robert Rosenzweig, "He brings wit
and irony to his work. He has a
detached and sensible point of view on
most issues."
Change In Plans
Stone didn't intend to become a
University administrator. After he
graduated from Stanford in 1967 he
enrolled in the Graduate School of
Business. "My family had been
bankers," Stone explains. "I was never
allowed to assume I would do
otherwise. Then I looked around at
what bankers and businessmen are
like."
Stone's plans to work for the state
of Illinois changed when the Student
Affairs staff asked him to be assistant
dean and business manager.
"That was the year of Cambodia
and many wrenching problems," says
Stone. While dealing with the crises
Stone became acquainted with
then-Provost Lyman who "eventually
became president and asked me to be
his assistant."
His explanation completed, Stone
leans back in his swivel chair, loafers
barely touching the floor, and takes a
moment for a sip of coffee. He looks
small behind his large, cluttered desk.'
The window is open behind his head.
Two upholstered chairs face his desk.
Half a dozen coffee mugs sit on the
bookshelves to his left for visitors.
The President's Man
Stone likens his duties to those
performed by former White House
aides Haldeman and Ehrlichman:
representing Lyman's views to other
people and other's views to Lyman. "I
try to see that Mr. Lyman gets involved
only in those things that require his
participation so he doesn't have to
do everything twice," explains Stone.
Robert Freelen of University
Relations comments that Stone "does
an excellent job in terms of getting
information from the president's office
to other people in the institution" and
vice versa. "He knows the University

very well."
Stone was surprised at first that so
many people feel they have to talk to
Lyman to get something done. "My
feelings moved from curiosity to
annoyance. But you have to be patient
with people."
Organizational behavior the
business class that Stone liked least
"has turned out to be the most
valuable," he observes. "This
institution is incredibly complex.
There is no shared idea of what the
purpose is.. . You work problems
through a whole variety of
constituencies and in many cases it's
difficult just to keep people talking to
one another."
Busy Days
In one typical day Stone will talk to
six or eight drop-in visitors, read and
outline Lyman's mail, speak with 10 or
12 people on the telephone, draft letters
for the president, confirm speaking
engagements, write a text for an
awards ceremony and take care of the
Christmas card list.
He arrives via bicycle at 7:30
a.m. to have an hour before the phone
starts ringing and people start arriving
and "just to get organized and collect
my thoughts."
Stone tries to be as accessible as
possible. He answers his own phone,
keeps his door open at all times and
avoids standing commitments which
would keep him inflexibly tied up.
"I like it to be thought that there's
someone here people can reach," he
explains. "It is important that people
really aren't stalled on things they're
interested in that they can get
answers."
Keeping In Touch
Also in an effort to keep in contact
with students, Stone was a resident in
Stern Hall for three years. He met his
wife Alice while teaching a SWOPSI
course ("She got an A in the course.")
They moved out of the dorm but
stayed on campus in a house "so it
would be easy to come and go and easy
for students to come and go in our
house," says Stone.
He adds that they didn't want to
give up the turmoil of campus. "With
the ever present challenge of ideas it's
hard to be complacent. I come from a
small town in Illinois which looks
pretty pallid in comparison."
Stone sees working with Lyman as
one of the greatest challenges of his
job. "He's one of the most remarkable
and demanding individuals I've worked
for. . . He really focuses on the quality
of ideas."
Stone, however, recognizes that
"It's a good idea for the University
president to change the palace guard
every few years. .. It can't be healthy

to have everything filtering through
the same eyes and ears all the time,"
explains Stone.
Stone thinks someone else should
have a chance at his job, partly because
he has become so comfortable with it.
"What's most important for me is to be
under pressure over my head this
particular situation isn't meeting that
test anymore."

No 'Game Plan'
Stone can't predict when he'll clear
off his desk. "Sooner rather than
later. .. I'm not somebody who has a
clear game plan of what I want to do
with my life. The two jobs I've had
since I graduated were pretty
unexpected."
At the moment he is coordinating
career plans with Alice and asking
"what kind of circumstances would
duplicate this type of challenge?"
Because Stone has been at Stanford
since his undergraduate days many
people ask him, "When are you going
out in the real world and prove
yourself?"

He answers that with the "variety of
things going on here, the richness of
the community, the campus is no less
narrow than other places you could be
this is an exhilarating place to be."

words, and comments that much of effectiveness is getting the point across
"which is sometimes more important than what is put across."
President Richard Lyman stands in
the doorway of Bill Stone's office and
says tensely, "Bill, may I see you a
moment?"
Stone, Lyman's assistant, leans back
in his chair, yawns, stretches and
answers, "Oh I guess so" as he ambles
to his feet.
"That puts them both at ease and
they start talking from there,'? explains
Noel Kolak, office supervisor for the
president and provost.
She ends her scenario with the
comment, "That is uniquely him
[Stone] his ability to depressurize
situations."
Most people who work with Stone
echo a comment by Vice Provost
Robert Rosenzweig, "He brings wit
and irony to his work. He has a
detached and sensible point of view on
most issues."
Change In Plans
Stone didn't intend to become a
University administrator. After he
graduated from Stanford in 1967 he
enrolled in the Graduate School of
Business. "My family had been
bankers," Stone explains. "I was never
allowed to assume I would do
otherwise. Then I looked around at
what bankers and businessmen are
like."
Stone's plans to work for the state
of Illinois changed when the Student
Affairs staff asked him to be assistant
dean and business manager.
"That was the year of Cambodia
and many wrenching problems," says
Stone. While dealing with the crises
Stone became acquainted with
then-Provost Lyman who "eventually
became president and asked me to be
his assistant."
His explanation completed, Stone
leans back in his swivel chair, loafers
barely touching the floor, and takes a
moment for a sip of coffee. He looks
small behind his large, cluttered desk.'
The window is open behind his head.
Two upholstered chairs face his desk.
Half a dozen coffee mugs sit on the
bookshelves to his left for visitors.
The President's Man
Stone likens his duties to those
performed by former White House
aides Haldeman and Ehrlichman:
representing Lyman's views to other
people and other's views to Lyman. "I
try to see that Mr. Lyman gets involved
only in those things that require his
participation so he doesn't have to
do everything twice," explains Stone.
Robert Freelen of University
Relations comments that Stone "does
an excellent job in terms of getting
information from the president's office
to other people in the institution" and
vice versa. "He knows the University

very well."
Stone was surprised at first that so
many people feel they have to talk to
Lyman to get something done. "My
feelings moved from curiosity to
annoyance. But you have to be patient
with people."
Organizational behavior the
business class that Stone liked least
"has turned out to be the most
valuable," he observes. "This
institution is incredibly complex.
There is no shared idea of what the
purpose is.. . You work problems
through a whole variety of
constituencies and in many cases it's
difficult just to keep people talking to
one another."
Busy Days
In one typical day Stone will talk to
six or eight drop-in visitors, read and
outline Lyman's mail, speak with 10 or
12 people on the telephone, draft letters
for the president, confirm speaking
engagements, write a text for an
awards ceremony and take care of the
Christmas card list.
He arrives via bicycle at 7:30
a.m. to have an hour before the phone
starts ringing and people start arriving
and "just to get organized and collect
my thoughts."
Stone tries to be as accessible as
possible. He answers his own phone,
keeps his door open at all times and
avoids standing commitments which
would keep him inflexibly tied up.
"I like it to be thought that there's
someone here people can reach," he
explains. "It is important that people
really aren't stalled on things they're
interested in that they can get
answers."
Keeping In Touch
Also in an effort to keep in contact
with students, Stone was a resident in
Stern Hall for three years. He met his
wife Alice while teaching a SWOPSI
course ("She got an A in the course.")
They moved out of the dorm but
stayed on campus in a house "so it
would be easy to come and go and easy
for students to come and go in our
house," says Stone.
He adds that they didn't want to
give up the turmoil of campus. "With
the ever present challenge of ideas it's
hard to be complacent. I come from a
small town in Illinois which looks
pretty pallid in comparison."
Stone sees working with Lyman as
one of the greatest challenges of his
job. "He's one of the most remarkable
and demanding individuals I've worked
for. . . He really focuses on the quality
of ideas."
Stone, however, recognizes that
"It's a good idea for the University
president to change the palace guard
every few years. .. It can't be healthy

to have everything filtering through
the same eyes and ears all the time,"
explains Stone.
Stone thinks someone else should
have a chance at his job, partly because
he has become so comfortable with it.
"What's most important for me is to be
under pressure over my head this
particular situation isn't meeting that
test anymore."

No 'Game Plan'
Stone can't predict when he'll clear
off his desk. "Sooner rather than
later. .. I'm not somebody who has a
clear game plan of what I want to do
with my life. The two jobs I've had
since I graduated were pretty
unexpected."
At the moment he is coordinating
career plans with Alice and asking
"what kind of circumstances would
duplicate this type of challenge?"
Because Stone has been at Stanford
since his undergraduate days many
people ask him, "When are you going
out in the real world and prove
yourself?"

He answers that with the "variety of
things going on here, the richness of
the community, the campus is no less
narrow than other places you could be
this is an exhilarating place to be."
