# Bug Me
## 
### Bonny Rodden 
This column, the last one of the quarter,
will be devoted to updating all the previous
questions answered this fall. All those people
who said they would do something about the
problems bugging readers were contacted to
see if they followed through.
• I.D. CARDS (9/24) Assoc. "Registrar
Robert Houghton said no one has
complained to him about the inconvenience
of the new pictureless cards. However,
Bookstore Manager Eldon Speed said some of
his customers are perturbed because the
Bookstore now requires more identification
than just the card.
Houghton mentioned a "bright" idea the
ASSU developed but eventually rejected.
Apparently the ASSU considered offering
plastic pouches to put both cards in.
• ALL-NIGHT STUDY ROOMS (10/1) -
The Oct. 13 murder in Memorial Church has
' pot caused security officers to lock up Quad
or Meyer Library classrooms any earlier,
Police Chief Marvin Herrington said.
Jlowever, the police do ask people to
evacuate the church by 10 p.m. unless an
organized group is using the building; before
the murder the closing hour was midnight,
Herrington said.
The security officers now alert deputized
officers if they see anyone "looking
suspicious" in the locked classrooms. Some
, people "looking for some place just to get
out of the rain" will find locked doors ajar
and enter the building, Herrington explained.
• CAN RECYCLING IN STADIUM (10/3)
T- Someone else finally got tired of all the
aluminum cans left in the stadium after
football games. Three groups two from Los
Altos and one from campus collected the
cans, Assoc. Director of Athletics Bob Young
said. Students, saying they represented the
Stanford Conservation Group, walked up and
down the bleachers with plastic bags, starting
about halfway through the season.
; • PARKING MENACES (10/3) -
Motorists still seem to enjoy harrassing
„,fpcyclists by stationing their cars in the no
parking zone between Meyer and the Main
Library. Although Police Chief Marvin

Herrington said he sees cars with tickets
waving forebodingly on their windshields
everytime he walks past the zone, he
lamented that the "citations don't seem to be
working." He toyed with the idea of a blitz
campaign in that area but decided a blitz
would draw officers away from other places
where they are needed. This looks like one
problem that isn't going to be solved.
• FACSIMILE SERVICES (10/2) - There
is a telecopier machine in the News and
Publications Office that can send manuscripts
to any other telecopier machine across the
country. The machine is usually used for
University business, but Bob Beyers,
University News Service director, said he
would make exceptions for students who
need to send a story to a news publication.
He explained that his staff does not have
enough time to let "just anybody" use the
equipment.
Beyers said the student would have to
know the receiver's phone number and the
receiver would have to be willing to accept a
collect call from the student for the service.
News and Pub is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Monday through Friday.
• SERRA STREET BIKE PATHS (10/29)
Prepare for a smoother ride, bicyclists who
travel treacherous Serra Street. Perry
Hackett, environmental protection services
manager, said he has installed four ramps on
the north and less bumpy sidewalk for
bicyclists. He said he has also filled some of
the worst potholes on Galvez Street.
• THE AXE, THE AXE (10/31) - Now
that the axe is back on campus once again, it
has prompted quite a bit of axe-iety. The Axe
Commission plans to display the plaque a lot
more this year at Cal basketball and baseball
games; a fact which is causing paranoia. "Are
you sure you're from the Daily and not from
Cal?" Claudia Temby, head of the
Commission, queried suspiciously.
Temby said three Stanford alumni, who
designed the Band Shak's alarm system, are
working together to construct a new case for
the Axe with funds from the Athletic
Department. The case will be made of several

kinds of glass armor plate, regular plate
glass and maybe Plexiglass, according to Rick
Miller, one of the three designers. The main
feature of the case will be the locks. He
estimated the case will be finished after
Christmas vacation, but Temby doesn't
expect it to be finished until the beginning of
spring quarter.
• POST OFFICE LINES (11/5) - There's
good news for those of you who are tired of
waiting in line at the campus Post Office. In a
few weeks, the Stanford branch will acquire a
new clerk, Palo Alto Postmaster James
Hodgen announced. "We are planning on
having enough people there so that the
window service will be adequate and people
won't wait so long," he added. The clerk will
work full time and will have other duties, but
he will be available for window work when
the lines start forming.
• LEFT-HANDED DESKS (11/5) -
Southpaws had better learn to write
ambidextrously because it looks like
replacing some of the right-hand tablet arms
in the Psychology Department for
left-handed ones will be too expensive.
Psychology Administrative Officer Maixine
Aiken stated American Seating, the company
which originally installed the seats, estimated
it would cost about $3OOO to replace 10
percent of the right-handed seats in rooms
040, 041 and 050 in the Psych Department.
Aiken explained the cost is so high because
the change involves putting a whole new side
on the seat; thus, the chair must be
completely rebuilt. She said she expects a
definite estimate in about two weeks, adding
she has no idea whether the University will
make the change.

What would happen to this column if the Bug
decided to escape her cocoon and fly away
on butterfly wings? T.D.B.
Funny you should ask. That's just what
Bug plans to do. Patty Fels, who co-edited
this week's column, will be transformed into
an insect during the reincarnation period,
Christmas vacation. She will be ready to be
bugged in January.
