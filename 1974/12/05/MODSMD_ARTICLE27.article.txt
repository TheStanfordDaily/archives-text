# Fewer Students Requesting Information In 'Open' Files
## 
### JOHN FREED 
A diminishing number of
students here are asking for
information about themselves
under a new "open files" law,
while in Washington the author of
the legislation plans to "clarify" it
shortly, according to a
spokesman.
From a peak of 12 curious
students on the first day the law
went into effect, the number of
persons requesting information in
files has trickled to one per day,
according to a worker in the
recorder's office.
All told, 32 persons have asked
for their cumulative records, and
all 32 have seen them — minus
confidential letters of
recommendation.
"Letters of recommendation,
we consider a sensitive area,"
commented James Siena, legal
adviser to the president. The
University administration
considered the letters so sensitive,
in fqct, that on Friday, Nov. 15,
then-Acting President William
Miller ordered them removed
from student files, possibly in
violation of the open-files law.
That law's sponsor, Sen. James
Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.), will soon
introduce amendments which
would validate the University's
legal position, according to
Buckley's press secretary, Tim
Lanigan.
"Right now, Sen. [Claiborne]
Pell [D-R.I.] and Sen. Buckley
have agreed to introduce
amendments to clear up
ambiguities, such as those
[concerning] letters written prior
to the enactment of the act,"
Lanigan said.
Other contemplated changes in
the law would prevent students

from seeing confidential financial
statements filed by parents,
allow parents of dependent
students to receive information
such as grades from a school
and let students waive the right to
view confidential letters written in
the future.
These changes will be formally
suggested "in the near future,
possibly the next few days,"
Lanigan said Tuesday.
On campus, only six persons
have pressed the matter of viewing
documents the administration

doesn't necessarily want them to
see, according to Siena.
"We've had one request from a
currently enrolled student to see a
folder from the registrar's office;
three from the Academic
Information Center . . . and two f
from former students," Siena
noted. "We're investigating all of
them."
Siena refused to say whether
the University would give in on
any requests.
"I'd rather not speculate,"'
Siena said.

adviser to the president. The
University administration
considered the letters so sensitive,
in fqct, that on Friday, Nov. 15,
then-Acting President William
Miller ordered them removed
from student files, possibly in
violation of the open-files law.
That law's sponsor, Sen. James
Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.), will soon
introduce amendments which
would validate the University's
legal position, according to
Buckley's press secretary, Tim
Lanigan.
"Right now, Sen. [Claiborne]
Pell [D-R.I.] and Sen. Buckley
have agreed to introduce
amendments to clear up
ambiguities, such as those
[concerning] letters written prior
to the enactment of the act,"
Lanigan said.
Other contemplated changes in
the law would prevent students

from seeing confidential financial
statements filed by parents,
allow parents of dependent
students to receive information
such as grades from a school
and let students waive the right to
view confidential letters written in
the future.
These changes will be formally
suggested "in the near future,
possibly the next few days,"
Lanigan said Tuesday.
On campus, only six persons
have pressed the matter of viewing
documents the administration

doesn't necessarily want them to
see, according to Siena.
"We've had one request from a
currently enrolled student to see a
folder from the registrar's office;
three from the Academic
Information Center . . . and two f
from former students," Siena
noted. "We're investigating all of
them."
Siena refused to say whether
the University would give in on
any requests.
"I'd rather not speculate,"'
Siena said.
A diminishing number of
students here are asking for
information about themselves
under a new "open files" law,
while in Washington the author of
the legislation plans to "clarify" it
shortly, according to a
spokesman.
From a peak of 12 curious
students on the first day the law
went into effect, the number of
persons requesting information in
files has trickled to one per day,
according to a worker in the
recorder's office.
All told, 32 persons have asked
for their cumulative records, and
all 32 have seen them — minus
confidential letters of
recommendation.
"Letters of recommendation,
we consider a sensitive area,"
commented James Siena, legal
adviser to the president. The
