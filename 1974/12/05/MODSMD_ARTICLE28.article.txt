# University To Require Student Parking Fee
## 
### 
Students who parked their cars
on campus at no charge this
quarter will have to shell out
$7.50 for parking stickers by Jan.
20 or face a citation, Director of
Police Services Marvin Herrington
has announced.
The stickers will be valid
through winter and spring
quarters and their price represents
a prorata share of last year's $lO
student parking fee.
Faculty and staff must also
obtain a sticker for their cars,
though they will still be allowed
to park for free.
Studies of University parking
policy, including fees, are still in
progress and are scheduled for
completion in January. In any
event, new policies could not
become effective until the start of
1975-76.
Asst. Vice President for Medical
Affairs Peter Carpenter has been

placed in charge of developing a
set of alternatives with respect to
the parking studies. He hopes to
complete this task by February,
following consultation with Asst.
Food Research Prof. Scott
Pearson's subcommittee on
parking of the University Land
and Buildings Committee, and
other interested parties.
Several studies of parking
policy published since 1970 have 1
recommended parking fees, plus
development of alternative
transportation systems serving the
campus area.
Forms for faculty and staff
stickers for the calendar year
1975 have been circulated to '
departments. Students may obtain
decals during registration at
Maples Pavilion Jan. 6 or at the
Fire and Police Services Building
from Jan. 7 to Jan. 20.
