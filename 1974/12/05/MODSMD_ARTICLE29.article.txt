# OR Releaseâ€”A Second Choice For Defendants
## 
### STAN WILSON 
The policeman guided his young prisoner
toward the booking clerk's window. The boy's
face revealed equal measures of fear and
contempt. Without looking up, the clerk
glanced at the court report and typed the
defendant's name and address on another
form.
"The judge has set bail at $1000," the clerk
said. "You get two phone calls."
Chances are a few years ago that first call
would have been to a bail bondsman, who
would charge the boy 10 percent of the bail
total, or $lOO for securing his freedom. Today
he has a second choice. It's called Own
Recognizance Release (OR), and if a
defendant qualifies he may be released on his
promise that he'll appear for trial.
Most of the people who have worked at the
San Mateo County OR Project are Stanford
graduates, and although 32-year-old grad Leon
Thornton pursues his work as a career, most
of the youthful investigators use the
modest-paying job as a stepping stone to law
school. But all aVe serious about their work.
"The OR Project seems to more closely
approximate justice," says Paul Glad, a 1974
Stanford graduate. Pat Dubbs, '73, explains
that she's "interested in people in the
reality of criminal justice. I'm concerned
about who gets hurt and why. This is real
it's better than Dragnet or the FBI."
According to San Mateo County OR
Director Jack Baptista, the program was
instituted "on the premise that keeping
indigents in jail merely because they can't
afford bail is a violation of their due process
rights."
Standard Analysis
The Own Recognizance investigators
conduct a standardized analysis of each
defendant to determine which are "good
risks" to appear for trial. They screen all
unsentenced persons who are booked into the
County Jail in Redwood City, and
immediately disqualify persons accused of
serious felonies murder, rape, bombing,
kidnap, etc.
The investigators attempt to verify the
information the defendant gives by checking
with a reference a spouse, friend or relative.
They use a carefully weighted point system to
analyze the information, considering such
factors as how long the defendant has lived in
the area, whether or not he is employed,
whether or not he has dependents "those
factors which would tend to insure that he
will appear for trial," says Baptista. If the
information is verified and the defendant
scores the requisite number of points, the
investigator recommends that he be released

on his Own Recognizance.
"We stick pretty close to the point
system," says Baptista, explaining that
subjective judgments play only a minor role in
the recommendation. "We give accurate
information to the court, but the judge has
the final decision. We tell him which people
we think are good risks, and he follows our
recommendations about 90 percent of the
time."
Investigator Mark Wilson, '73, believes that
"judges make better decisions because we're
here. The concept of OR is a good one
because the defendant gets out before trial
and has a chance to prepare his
defense .. . and theoretically, a man shouldn't
be punished until he's proven guilty of a
crime."
Bail A Punishment
For the poor defendant bail may be just
that a punishment, in effect a fine for
having been arrested. If he can't afford to post
bail himself, the defendant must use the
services of a bondsman. The 10 percent fee he
pays the bondsman is never recovered,
irregardless of the man's guilt or innocence.
Sometimes the pricetag is too high, and the
defendant may spend weeks or months in jail
waiting for his case to come to trial. If he has
a job, he will probably lose it.
According to Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Sidney Feinberg, "It's a matter
of justice if a person is arrested he isn't
guilty, only charged with a crime .. . under
the law he is presumed to be innocent."
The actual release process may take
anywhere from "15 minutes to a couple of
days, depending upon how complex the
situation is," says Baptista.
The investigator interviews the prisoner
after he has been booked, issued an orange
jump suit and placed in a holding cell.
Usually, eight or nine other prisoners are
present in the cell, and many are drunk.
Defendants Screened
The investigator screens the defendant for
medical problems, and alcoholics are
sometimes transferred to the detoxification
center at this point.
Because the interview is conducted in the
jail, the investigators work in close quarters
with the jail staff. "They merely put up with
us," says Wilson. "They see us as a hindrance.
But we have to maintain a working rapport
with the jail staff if we're going to be
successful."
Apparently, the atmosphere is changing.
"Two years ago they wouldn't even let us in
the jail," Wilson explains. At that time the OR
project was run by the VISTA Program, and
according to Wilson, the VISTA people "wanted
to let everyone out of jail," regardless of
whether or not they were good risks. As a
result, the program lacked credibility. "Since
they got rid of the Vista program the jail staff
can see that the OR people are trying to do a
fair job," says Wilson. "We're an impartial
service we aid both the prisoners and the
courts."
But the OR project is certainly no help to
the bail bonds industry. Its lobbyists in
Sacramento are resisting the expansion of OR
programs in California, and the bondsmen
view OR as another form of welfare, one
which poses a very real threat to their
business.
Explains bondsman Wally Perry, "If the
man at the jail says to the prisoner, 'you want
to wait and talk to an OR man? He can
probably get you out for nothing . . .' it's
ridiculous. We can't compete with that."
Three Arguments
The arguments of the bondsmen seem to
fall into three categories: 1) The OR programs
don't benefit the people they're supposed to
benefit, i.e. the poor remain in jail; 2) Bail is a
more effective means of insuring that a
defendant will appear for trial; 3) OR
programs are a waste of the taxpayers' money.
"The OR programs are supposed to help
the poor people, the minorities, blacks,
chicanos and so forth but these people are
still in jail," argues San Jose bondsman Randy
Sparacino. Adds Perry, "The poor people
don't have any roots in the community, and
so they aren't OR'd."
But according to Judge Feinberg, "the fact

that a person is poor doesn't mean he's a
floater. Many of the people who are released
on OR are poor, and are, in fact, indigenous."
Are the poor people actually being served
by the San Mateo County OR Project, or is it
merely a convenience for the middle class and
wealthy defendants?
At the request of a group of local bail
bondsmen, the County Manager's Office
evaluated the San Mateo County Project. In
his report, Executive Assistant George Riley
concluded that "the OR Project has improved
its efficiency and effectiveness a great deal
over the past year."
Classified By Employment
Riley took the first 100 cases from the OR
files beginning January 1974, and classified
each person released according to
employment. Of the 100 cases, Riley found
that 37 percent of the people released on OR
were unemployed, and another 14 percent
were employed only part time. He listed 24
percent as unskilled-menial laborers, 14
percent as recently employed, seven percent
as skilled workers and the final eight percent
were listed in the professional/managerial
classification.
"It is difficult for me to determine which
individuals could afford bail," Riley says in
his report. "Perhaps everyone employed at
least part time (63 percent of the sample); or
only those with what appears to be relatively
stable employment (38 percent); or only
those with journeyman, technical, skilled or
better employment (28 percent); or only
those with management, engineer or owner
status (11 percent)."
If Riley's survey is accurate, it is apparent
that a significant percentage of the people
released on OR have no money or very few
extra funds.
"We're not in the business to OR
everyone," explains Baptista. "Our job is to
look for people who are good risks."
Apparently Baptista and his staff are
finding those "good risks." Statistics vary, but
perhaps as many as 98 percent of those
released on OR make their court appearances.
Too Many Releases
Bondsman Ester Beard concedes that the
San Mateo County OR figures are
"outstanding," but explains that she thinks
"they are misusing OR a little in San Mateo
County. By this I mean they are releasing
people who don't need OR the bank
president, people like that."
According to section 1318 of the California
Penal Code, a judge may release any
defendant on his own recognizance if that
person is eligible for bail, and if the judge
believes that the defendant will make his

court appearance.
The law does not specify that the
defendant must be poor nor does Law
Prof. John Kaplan believe it should. "A lot of
people who get help are those who are
financially able to post bail but why should
they have to?"
Judge Feinberg concurs. "Why make him
[the defendant] pay bail if you can get him to
appear without it?"
It is not completely clear which group is
more successful at insuring its client will
appear for trial but the bondsmen have one
definite advantage. Perry explains that "We're
able to obligate people. We can't watch
everyone who's released and neither can they.
But we can have someone who's close to him
be legally responsible for him someone who
has to pay the money if he fails to appear."
For the poor defendant whose family stands
to lose its savings or a car if he fails to appear,
this can be an effective lever.
High Success Rate
But in his study, Riley found no skips
among those released on OR, for a success
rate of 100 percent. Among defendants
released on bail, Riley found that 10.3
percent failed to make their court
appearances, a success rate of 89.7 percent.
Riley conceded that his sample was too small
to be conclusive, but said it indicates that "a
generally low skip rate exists [among people
released on their own recognizance]."
The bondsmen's final argument is that the
OR program is like another welfare agency,
and accordingly, it is a financial burden on the
taxpayers.
"It's hardly a waste of the taxpayers'
money," says Kaplan. "[OR] provides a
tremendous saving..." Supporters of OR
claim that the program actually saves money
because if a defendant is granted pre-trial
release, the county isn't spending money to
house him.
According to Baptista, the Sheriffs
Department figures about 15 dollars per day
per man in jail. "That's their cost for food,
laundry, soap for consummates," he says.
"According to my study we save the county
about $319,000 per year. I counted only
those who could not afford bail, and figured a
conservative $5 per day per man. At any one
time there are from 500-1000 people out on
OR."
And, Baptista adds, 500 fewer mouths to
feed at the taxpayers expense. But Perry says,
"I don't see jails spending less money now
the cost of running a jail is almost a fixed
figure. They may spend a little less on food,
but the costs haven't varied that much. All
they've done is add another level of

bureaucracy ... and it costs them $5O-60 to
release a man."
Accurate Figure
Perry's figure is fairly accurate. The San
Mateo County OR Project had a budget of
$lOB,OOO for the year beginning July 1973,
and ending July 1974. In the first six months,
929 people were released on OR, or about
$57 per man.
If we accept the Sheriff's Department
figure of $l5/day/man, then it would take
four days for the savings to offset the $5O-60
it costs to release the defendant. Usually, a
defendant is in jail longer than four days
waiting for his case to come to trial.
In his independent study, Riley arrived at a
total savings figure significantly lower than
the $319,000 which Baptista claims the OR
Project is saving the taxpayers.
Riley figured only three dollars/day/man
for consumables, "specifically excluding all
overhead and fixed costs." Estimating 3.8
days as the average stay in jail for each
defendant, and then figuring that one in five
would have remained in jail as long as 30 more
days, Riley arrived at a savings of about
$54,000 a year which could be directly
attributed to the OR Project.
At that rate the OR Project is costing the
taxpayers $lOB,OOO (the budget), minus
$54,000 (the direct savings), or about
$54,000/ year.
Spendings Stabilized
However, Riley concluded that ". . . the
amount of money [spent] has stabilized over
the past two years and the efficiency,
effectiveness and reliability of the project is
firmly established with courts, police, the
district attorney and low-income interest
groups."
Which is good news for Baptista the OR
Project is funded by the San Mateo County
Bar Association, and the continuation of the
program is reconsidered every year.
Paul Glad had been working for the San
Mateo County project for a year when the
struggle with the bail industry reached a
highpoint. "The reason I stayed was because
the project was in a tremendous battle for
funding, and we were being hotly contested
by the bailbondsmen. I came to care very
much about whether the OR project did or
did not exist."
The project office consists of a few small
rooms on the second floor of an unobtrusive
two-story office building in Redwood City. A
few steps away stands the San Mateo County
Courthouse, which houses the County Jail.
Changed Perspective
Pat Dubbs said that her work at the OR
project changed her perspective. "I believe
that people get screwed by the system . . . my
basic reaction to prisoners is that there isn't
one person there that I wouldn't want to
spend the weekend with. When you talk to
people [in the jail] you realize they're just
people. If a few things had been different
maybe we'd have been behind those bars ...
"I suppose I have more respect for cops
now than when I started this job," she
explains. "But I've been very disillusipned
with the whole probation office they're
swamped with the people they're supposed to
help. The job is just too great."
While Dubbs has become disillusioned, Glad
remains optimistic about the project's future.
"I had very romantic ideas about detective
work and police. I was fascinated by the
whole thing," Dubbs explains. "But now I've
given up the idea of greatly changing things,
of making a big splash. Things have been the
way they are for a long time, and I don't see
how they would change."
Glad disagrees. "I think our very existence
is evidence of that change. The program is
much stronger now. It's been a lot of little
things, but I expect to keep seeing progress."
One letter from a former client summed it
up this way: "I had never been in jail before.
It was a horrible nightmare. If it wasn't for
your service I'd probably still be there, I
guess. Thanks for saving my job."
The letter isn't really typical most of
those arrested have been in jail before, and
not all have jobs to lose. But Glad read the
letter with a great deal of satisfaction. To him,
it's progress.
