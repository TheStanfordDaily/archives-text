# Med Center Group Seeks Unionization
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
The Stanford University Housestaff
Association (SUHA) has petitioned the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) to gain official recognition as
the bargaining union for some 470
interns, residents and post-doctoral
research fellows at the Stanford
Medical Center.
SUHA and several other groups of
Medical Center employees are filing
for recognition under new NLRB
provisions, instituted in August, which
allow employees of private, non-profit
hospitals to be legally represented by
unions.
According to SUHA President Dr.
Robert Jahnke, the Housestaff
Association's petition, presently under
examination in preliminary NLRB
hearings, represents the first bid by a
group of residents and interns to form
an NLRB recognized union.
"Our only precedent is a similar
group of interns and residents at the
University of Michigan who won the
right to unionize under state laws in a
Michigan Supreme Court decision,"
said Jahnke. "We plan to cite that
decision in our case.
"We feel that we are definitely
employees we're defined in the
official University documents as
employees," Jahnke stated.
"We are eligible for group health
care plans, we're covered by the
University's malpractice insurance, we
get sick leave, a three-week vacation
and a salary based on level of training,
not financial need. All those qualify
us, in our minds, as employees with
the right to unionize," he said.
Incipient Stages
University Legal Adviser John
Schwartz, who is representing
Stanford in the preliminary NLRB
hearings, said the University had not
yet formulated a position on the
SUHA petition. "This thing is in the
very, very incipient stages," he said.
"The hearings conducted so far
have not yet come to the issues
regarding the housestaff group," he

added. "Their petition has so far been
linked to several others, and they're
being considered together."
Schwartz said that petitions by the
United Stanford Employees (USE), the
Stanford United Medical Technologists
and the Stanford Engineering
Department Association (a group of
employees in the Stanford Hospital's
engineering department) are presently
being examined together with the
SUHA petition "to see that
everything's in order."
Elections
If the NLRB decides the petition is
valid, according to Schwartz, it will
conduct secret-ballot elections to
determine whether the majority of the
interns, residents and research fellows
wish to be represented by SUHA.
If there is sufficient interest in the
union, the NLRB will deliberate
further on the petition before
rendering its decision.
Jahnke said the housestaff's desire
to get an officially recognized union
grew out of dissatisfaction with
current relations with the Medical
Center administration and especially
with the terms of a salary increase the
residents and interns received last
spring.
"At first we were offered a
completely unacceptable five- percent
raise, and that was ultimately raised to
eight percent," he said.
"At that point the administration
said we absolutely couldn't get any
more, but then they turned right
around and gave a 15 percent rgise to
the nurses.

"Also, there were a number of
incidents during the nurses' strike
where we felt that surgeons and
surgical interns were being used as scab
nurses," said Jahnke, a radiology
resident. "Our lawyers and we feel
we'd be treated a lot more equitably
with a union."

have not yet come to the issues
regarding the housestaff group," he

added. "Their petition has so far been
linked to several others, and they're
being considered together."
Schwartz said that petitions by the
United Stanford Employees (USE), the
Stanford United Medical Technologists
and the Stanford Engineering
Department Association (a group of
employees in the Stanford Hospital's
engineering department) are presently
being examined together with the
SUHA petition "to see that
everything's in order."
Elections
If the NLRB decides the petition is
valid, according to Schwartz, it will
conduct secret-ballot elections to
determine whether the majority of the
interns, residents and research fellows
wish to be represented by SUHA.
If there is sufficient interest in the
union, the NLRB will deliberate
further on the petition before
rendering its decision.
Jahnke said the housestaff's desire
to get an officially recognized union
grew out of dissatisfaction with
current relations with the Medical
Center administration and especially
with the terms of a salary increase the
residents and interns received last
spring.
"At first we were offered a
completely unacceptable five- percent
raise, and that was ultimately raised to
eight percent," he said.
"At that point the administration
said we absolutely couldn't get any
more, but then they turned right
around and gave a 15 percent rgise to
the nurses.

"Also, there were a number of
incidents during the nurses' strike
where we felt that surgeons and
surgical interns were being used as scab
nurses," said Jahnke, a radiology
resident. "Our lawyers and we feel
we'd be treated a lot more equitably
with a union."
The Stanford University Housestaff
Association (SUHA) has petitioned the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) to gain official recognition as
the bargaining union for some 470
interns, residents and post-doctoral
research fellows at the Stanford
Medical Center.
SUHA and several other groups of
Medical Center employees are filing
for recognition under new NLRB
provisions, instituted in August, which
allow employees of private, non-profit
hospitals to be legally represented by
unions.
According to SUHA President Dr.
Robert Jahnke, the Housestaff
Association's petition, presently under
examination in preliminary NLRB
hearings, represents the first bid by a
group of residents and interns to form
an NLRB recognized union.
"Our only precedent is a similar
group of interns and residents at the
University of Michigan who won the
right to unionize under state laws in a
Michigan Supreme Court decision,"
said Jahnke. "We plan to cite that
decision in our case.
"We feel that we are definitely
employees we're defined in the
official University documents as
employees," Jahnke stated.
"We are eligible for group health
care plans, we're covered by the
University's malpractice insurance, we
get sick leave, a three-week vacation
and a salary based on level of training,
not financial need. All those qualify
us, in our minds, as employees with
the right to unionize," he said.
Incipient Stages
University Legal Adviser John
Schwartz, who is representing
Stanford in the preliminary NLRB
hearings, said the University had not
yet formulated a position on the
SUHA petition. "This thing is in the
very, very incipient stages," he said.
"The hearings conducted so far
have not yet come to the issues
regarding the housestaff group," he

added. "Their petition has so far been
linked to several others, and they're
