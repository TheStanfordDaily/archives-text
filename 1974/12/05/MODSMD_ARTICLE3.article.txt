# Med Center Group Seeks Unionization

Association (SUHA) has petitioned the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) to gain official recognition as
the bargaining union for some 470
interns, residents and post-doctoral
research fellows at the Stanford
Medical Center.
SUHA and several other groups of
Medical Center employees are filing
for recognition under new NLRB
provisions, instituted in August, which
allow employees of private, non-profit
hospitals to be legally represented by
unions.
According to SUHA President Dr.
Robert Jahnke, the Housestaff
Association's petition, presently under
examination in preliminary NLRB
hearings, represents the first bid by a
group of residents and interns to form
an NLRB recognized union.
"Our only precedent is a similar
group of interns and residents at the
University of Michigan who won the
right to unionize under state laws in a
Michigan Supreme Court decision,"
said Jahnke. "We plan to cite that
decision in our case.
"We feel that we are definitely
employees we're defined in the
official University documents as
employees," Jahnke stated.
"We are eligible for group health
care plans, we're covered by the
University's malpractice insurance, we
get sick leave, a three-week vacation
and a salary based on level of training,
