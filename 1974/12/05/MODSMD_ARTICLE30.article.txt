# Cuts Birth Rate, Upgrades Technology
## India Fights Food Shortage, Trade Quotas 
### S.K. CHOPRA 
SAN FRANCISCO Although India is still suffering
from a food shortage, Indian food production
"has increased by 120 percent against a population growth
of 60 percent," T.N. Kaul, Indian Ambassador to the
United States, said in an interview last week.
"Indians have more to eat than before, and no one is
starving, as sensational newspaper reports here seem to
convey," Kaul said.
When Kaul was secretary of the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research in 1947, he developed concepts of
planned farming which are credited with launching the
"green revolution" two decades later.
Boom, But No Solution
The "green revolution" led to a boom in Indian food
production.
Kaul ascribed present Indian food shortages to fertilizer
problems and current oil crisis, "problems we had not
bargained for." Despite the "green revolution," these
problems have resulted in "a marginal shortage of about
five million tons of food grains this year."
When questioned at the World Affairs Club about
India's efforts to limit population, Kaul responded, "We
spend more than any other country in the world on our
family planning programs."
Birth Rate Down
"Ninety percent of all vasectomies in the world are
performed in India today," he explained. "We have been
able to reduce our birth rate to 2.8 percent and are
determined to reduce it further to 1.4 percent."
Kaul characterized India as well-equipped to face her
current problems. He described the nation's ills as
"temporary," adding that India is looking ahead to a
"great future."
"The American people must realize that we are a
determined nation ... on the take-off stage," he said.
Discussing India's technological advances, Kaul
emphasized, "We want trade, not aid."
He explained, "Our industrial infrastructure and
technological base is sufficiently developed now to allow
fUs,â€žto enter into partnerships on an equal basis. In fact,
4here are already 700 such joint Indo-U.S. projects in
existence today."
Utilizing Expertise
Kaul said his current optimism stems from India's
utilization of its vast resources of technological and
scientific expertise for solving her immediate problems and
for planning ahead.
r "We have the third largest number of scientists and
engineers in the world, after the U.S. and the U.5.5.R.,"
he said.

"The fact that our nuclear implosion was conducted
entirely by Indian personnel is just one indicator of the
level of development of our technology. We would like to
share and trade the products of our technology with the
United States," he added.
Trade between India and the United States, the two
largest democracies, has not been very encouraging until
now, Kaul said, mainly because of U.S. quota barriers on
tariff restrictions imposed on developing countries.
About "96 percent of the U.S. trade is currently
handled by Europe, Japan and other economically

advanced countries," he said. "The developing countries
get only about four percent of the U.S. trade share."
Capability For More
"India, for instance, exports only 0.6 percent of the
total U.S. imports, although we have the capability of
handling much more. The situation is not fair to us."
According to Kaul, this "unfair situation" is likely to be
corrected by the passage of the Trade Reforms Bill, which
should come before the U.S. Congress by the end of 1974.
The Trade Reforms Bill, piloted by a group of liberal
senators, aims at loosening quota barriers against
developing countries and thus reducing the trade
imbalances between them and the U.S.
Trade imbalance between India and the U.S. is nearly
30 percent this year. Indian exports to the U.S. totalled
$550 million, while U.S. exports to India amounted to
$750 million, with a good deal of that for food grains.
India traditionally exports cotton textiles, leather,
footwear, jute and precious stones.
Engineering Goods
However, in the past decade or so, the Indian
government has gone all out to promote the export of
engineering goods because its industry has developed
enough to compete in international markets, he said.
India's export of engineering goods reached an all-time
high last year of $225 million, 27 percent more than the
1974 total. Of the $225 million though, the U.S. received
only $l2 million.
Fabricated steel structures, machine and hand tools,
bicycles and bicycle parts, diesel machinery and textile
machinery accounted for most of the exports.
The Engineering Export Promotion Council, an Indian
government agency with a branch office in Chicago, has
also identified export markets in the U.S. for electronics
equipment, electrical machinery (such as motors,
transformers, switch gears and fashlights), cathode ray
tubes, air compressors, centrifugal pumps and a variety of
simple manufactured items.
Liberalization of quota barriers is expected to give a
tremendous impetus to the export of these engineering
goods to the U.S., Kaul said.
He added that most Americans are not aware of the
export situation and do not realize India's economic and
technological potential. "Dr. Kissinger has recognized this.
So has the U.S. President. Isn't it time other Americans do
too?" he asked.
A Master of Laws from London and an honorary fellow
of King's College in London, Kaul joined the Indian Civil
Service in 1936. He has served in various administrative
posts in the Indian government and was India's envoy in
Peking, London, Moscow and Tehran.
