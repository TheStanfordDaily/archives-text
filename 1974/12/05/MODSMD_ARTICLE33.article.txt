# Frivolity Shunned
## Austere Yule In Stores 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
On University Avenue in Palo
Alto, there are no bright exterior
lights to set off the shops. Only a
few stores have indulged in the
frivolity of previous years by
putting up exterior lights, a
custom from the days when
energy seemed unlimited and
virtually no one had heard the
phrase "energy crisis."
But last year's crisis is still a
problem today.
Traditionally a time when
stofes and shopping centers blaze
with colored lights and brilliantly
decorated trees, the 1974
Christmas spirit is subdued, with
much less visual intoxication.
The California Avenue
shopping district has gone so far
as to decorate outdoor trees with
lights, but individual stores have
few, if any, interior decorations.
A few lit trees are the only
energy-consuming decorations at
Town and Country Village
Shopping Center.
Fewer Lights
And the Stanford Shopping
Center has noticeably fewer lights.
Outdoor decorations are only
being lit during business hours.
The energy problem has created
a challenge for retailers. Caught
up in the desire to profit from the
commercialism of Christmas by
luring customers, yet subjected to
public pressure to cut down on
energy consumption, store
managers have devised their own
methods of coping with the
shortage.
In previous years, Macy's has
had extensive decorative outdoor
lighting. Last year and this year,
no exterior lights have been used.
This Christmas, "much thought
had been given to the energy
problem," says David Yancey,
head of display at Macy's. "Only
small lights are being used to
decorate the store, and personnel
have made thier own decorations
for the tree." According to
Yancey, they are "home-made
and country type patchwork
and gingham."

Saks, somewhat ahead of the
times, has cut out exterior lights
the past three years; small white
lights are used inside.
Town and Country Village
Shopping Center also relied on
extensive outdoor lighting in
previous years, but the lights have
been replaced by styrofoam candy
canes, wreaths and evergreen
arrangements.
There are many reasons for the
stores to comply with the energy
cutbacks. One is public pressure,
according to A1 Waller, leasing
manager of the Town and
Country Village.
"We've cut our decorations
down to zilch ... if people
complain, they we'll put down the
lights," Waller said.
Response to Pressure
At the Stanford Shopping
Center, personnel are reflecting
public pressure by agreeing to cut
back.

Of course, less energy
consumption means lower
electricity costs. And as long as all
stores agree to cut back, all are
affected equally by the cut in
decorative advertising.
The energy problem is not one
to be immediately resolved, and
will probably become more severe
before the situation improves,
some store officials say. Energy
crisis adjustments in advertising
are inevitable, and stores will
resort to other forms of
advertising not only at
Christmas but year-round, they
predict.
Retailers are faced by a very
stark reality of even less available
energy in the coming years,
according to Walter Plonski,
manager of the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Plonski says that in the years to
come, "gaudy displays will be
gone .. . the only alternative is to
get away from lights."
