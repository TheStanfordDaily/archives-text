# Education, , Engineering Schools Ranked In Top 3
## 
### 
A new survey of professional school deans ranks Stanford's schools
of ediication, business, engineering and medicine among the top three
nationally.
The results were markedly similar to an earlier survey conducted by
a pair of Columbia University professors.
Analyses showed a very strong correlation between the size of the
professional school library and school rankings in business, education
and law. The total size of the University library was also strongly
correlated with these three schools, but less so in engineering.
The school's total budget showed a strong relation to its ranking in
law, markedly related to its standing in engineering, but not so in
business and education.

Stanford's School of, Education
was ranked first nationally, with
87 of, the 145 responding deans
naming it among the five best in
the country. Columbia placed
second with 80 mentions, Ohio
State third with 60 and Chicago
fourth with 55.
The Graduate School of
Business ranked second to
Harvard by a narrow margin, with
111 mentions compared to 118,
among 132 respondents. Chicago
was third with 93 and
Pennsylvania fourth with 44.
Among engineering schools,
Stanford tied for second with the
University of Illinois, both
receiving 84 mentions among 131
respondents. MIT was first with
119 and UC-Berkeley fourth with
67. Cal Tech placed fifth with 62.
Stanford's School of Medicine
was tied for third with Duke, both
receiving 20 mentions among 50
respondents. Harvard was first
with 48, John Hopkins second
with 29 and Yale fifth with 18.
The survey of deans 'ranked
Stanford's law school sixth
nationally, with 45 mentions
among 104 respondents. Harvard
led with 101 mentions, followed
by Yale, 86; Michigan, 73;
Columbia, 60; and Chicago, 58.
Stanford's journalism program
was tied for eighth place with
Michigan, each receiving three
mentions among 22 respondents.
Columbia and Minnesota led with
14 each, followed by
Northwestern, 13; Missouri, 12;
Illinois and Wisconsin, 11; and
Nebraska, 5,
Nearly four out of five deans
asked to list the five leading
institutibns in their field did so in
this study, a significantly higher
response rate than earlier surveys.
The survey's results are
published in the current issue of
Change magazine.

MERRY CHRISTMAS—HoIiday decorations in area shopping centers are less austere than usual this year,
as few store owners have indulged in the frivolity of exterior lights. The energy crisis has darkened—but
hopefully not subdued—the 1974 holiday spirit.

correlated with these three schools, but less so in engineering.
The school's total budget showed a strong relation to its ranking in
law, markedly related to its standing in engineering, but not so in
business and education.

Stanford's School of, Education
was ranked first nationally, with
87 of, the 145 responding deans
naming it among the five best in
the country. Columbia placed
second with 80 mentions, Ohio

Business ranked second to
Harvard by a narrow margin, with
111 mentions compared to 118,
among 132 respondents. Chicago
was third with 93 and
Pennsylvania fourth with 44.
Among engineering schools,
Stanford tied for second with the
University of Illinois, both
receiving 84 mentions among 131
respondents. MIT was first with
119 and UC-Berkeley fourth with
67. Cal Tech placed fifth with 62.
Stanford's School of Medicine
was tied for third with Duke, both
receiving 20 mentions among 50
respondents. Harvard was first
with 48, John Hopkins second
with 29 and Yale fifth with 18.
The survey of deans 'ranked
Stanford's law school sixth
nationally, with 45 mentions
among 104 respondents. Harvard

asked to list the five leading
institutibns in their field did so in
this study, a significantly higher
