# Dial-A-Bus Still Plagued By Confusion
## 
### LONNIE ROSENWALD 
After its first week of
operation, Santa Clara County
Dial-A-Bus service continues to be
plagued by glutted phone lines
and confused customers.
However, the new computer-run
buses are managing to fulfill over
3000 service requests per day.
"The response has been
excellent," says Transit District
manager Frank Lara, although
service lines are still being tied up
by callers who want to know how
to use the systeny As a result,
many service requests are not
getting through.
To ease this problem, the
transit office has installed
additional telephone lines, and has
attempted to publicize
explanatory information through
the media and advertisements.
The length of calls has also been
reduced, from an average of over
eight minutes on the first day of
operation to a current level of 4.4

minutes.
Most calls come from residents
not sure which service zone they
are in, and consequently, which
service center to call. The transit
office plans to release a brochure
with maps of the various zones
and further details on how to use
the system in the near future.
Meanwhile, service is operating
smoothly, and riders have only
had to wait an average of 20
minutes from the time of their
call until the bus arrives.

Another problem Dial-A-Bus
faces is that people frequently
request personal service between
points which the regular arterial
bus routes sufficiently cover.
Ideally, Dial-A-Bus is intended to
supplement arterial routes by
providing transportation in cases
where these routes fail to provide
access to the rider's destination.

To further improve service, an
expanded network of arterial
routes will go into effect starting
December 21. Despite attempts
by certain members of the
Stanford community to have a
bus route run through campus,
the proposed "Route 50" will not
be included in the new plan.
