# New Technique Screens Transplant Recipients
## 
### 
Medical Center News Service
A new technique for predicting
which heart transplant patients
will reject their new heart severely
and which will have a smooth
clinical course has been developed
by a Stanford heart research team.
The technique has predicted
accurately the clinical course of
the last nine patients who received
new hearts at Stanford Hospital.
It is being used to help screen
potential heart transplant
recipients.
The procedure is based on the
recent finding that immune
systems function differently in
individuals, and that white blood
cells are responsible for this
variation.
Patients whose white blood
cells mount a vigorous attack to a
test panel in the laboratory also
react violently to a new heart.
These patients have serious
rejection 'episodes and are
considered hyperreactive. Patients
with fewer active blood cells have
fewer rejection problems and do
better.
A study of 11 heart transplart
patients in 1972 and 1973 is

reported in the November issue of
Transplantation , the journal of
the Transplantation Society.
Authors are Doctors Alan
Coulson, Fran McMillan, Randall
Griepp, Edward Stinson, Eugene
Dong Jr. and Norman Shumway.
Virginia Geitman is also working
on the project now.
It is not surprising to find a
variation in immune activity,
noted Coulson. Many organs
including the brain, throid gland,
bone marrow, even the stomach
are known to vary functionally
from one person to another.
"Eventually we may use this
method to help the surgeon
determine whether or not to do a
heart transplant operation. In"
theory , such screening techniques
could be done before other organ j
transplant operations also,"
Coulson added.
For the screening procedure,
white blood cells are separated
from the blood of heart recipients
prior to surgery, before they
receive any immunosuppressive
therapy to prevent rejection. They
are mixed in a laboratory tissue
culture with several stimulants.
