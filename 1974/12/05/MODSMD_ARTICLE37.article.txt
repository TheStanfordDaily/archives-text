# Background paper summarizes rationale for proposed tuition hike

Following are excerpts from a background paper
circulated to the Board of Trustees concerning the
proposed tuition increase:
Background
A comparison of the 1974-75 rates with the
1975-76 recommendations is as follows:
Type From To % of
1974-75 1975-76 Increase Increase
General Tuition $3,375 $3,810 $435 12.88
School of Medicine
(M.D. Program) $3,570 $4,005 $435 12.88
Graduate School of
Business $3,600 $3,990 $390 10.80
While each year's tuition recommendations repre
sent in the last analysis a judgment by University
officers, that judgment this year had its roots in four
sets of considerations:
The first set combines general economic condi
tions and indicators with income and expense projec
tions for Stanford. We will refer to this set as
economic and budget considerations.
The second reviews projected tuition at other
institutions.
The third concerns the cost differential between
public and private institutions.
And the fourth—the relationship between fresh
man admissions, financial aid, and enrollment
choices—deals with our continued ability to attract
and enroll a diverse and high quality student body.
Economic and Budget Considerations
Whatever else institutions of higher learning may
be insulated from, they are clearly not insulated from
many local, national, and international economic
forces.
Whatever the focus is next year's Operating Budget
orTong term financial equilibrium—or, as is now the
case at Stanford, both together as part of a unified
plan-the major elements of income, particularly tui
tion, must be viewed in an appropriate economic
context.
In the research work which is proceeding under
Prof. William Massy's direction, a strong relationship
has been established between the growth-rate of
tuition and the growth-rate of necessary Operating
Budget expenditures, including expenditures for
funded improvements (i.e., improvements brought
securely into the budget base).
There is, moreover, a reasonably clear relationship
between economic indicators of general cost rise and
the cost of meeting particular increases in the Univer
sity's basic expenditures. As was indicated in the
presentation of the Long Range Financial Forecast,
we are assuming these values for the pertinent infla
tion indices in 1975-76:
Consumer Price Index (national) = 9.0%
Gross National Product deflator = 7.5%
Bay Area Consumer Price Index = 8.0%
There is not, of course, a one-to-one correspon
dence between these measures and Stanford's costs.
And the budget task is to cover the University's
expenses, not those of the average consumer. Never
theless, within the frame of reference provided by
Prof. Massy's work, a modest degree of funded
improvement (1% of the prior year's base) requires
approximately 4.2% in real growth of tuition.
("Real" refers to the amount of the overall increase
which exceeds inflation.)
The 1% funded improvement factor contemplated
in 1975-76 marks a reduction by two-thirds in the
level of funded improvements experienced in the past
two years.
In sum, a 4.2% real growth would require tuition
increases from 11.7% to 13.2%, depending on the
measure of inflation selected.
Giving further emphasis to the economic inter-rela
tionships relevant to the tuition rate are the un
certainties introduced by timing. We are each year in
the position of estimating the economic conditions
which will obtain some 8 to 20 months hence.
Our tendencies are generally those of optimists.
Thus a year ago the 1974-75 tuition recommendation
of a 7.6% increase was based upon an inflation
estimate of 5%. Actual inflation appears likely to
exceed that figure by a wide margin this year. Thus
there is likely to be a real decline in tuition income
for 1974-75.
[When inflation is taken into account], tuition
rate increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 of between
10.5 and 11% would be required to produce real

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.
In sum, we can say that the 1975-76 recommenda
tion compensates—but does not overcompensate— for
the decline in real tuition income in 1974-75. The
recommended rate is no higher than it would have
been if our predictions of inflation had been more
accurate.
Leaving economic factors for the moment, a look
should be taken at the basic arithmetic of the tuition
income equation. Tuition income to the Operating
Budget is a product of three factors: autumn quarter
enrollment; returning enrollment ratios in succeeding
quarters; and the tuition rate. The estimated values
for the first two of these factors appear below:

Since the student body size is expected to remain
constant at the level budgeted for 1974-75 and the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is ex
pected to remain at 98% in winter and 91% in spring,
the increase in tuition income for 1975-76 will be a
function solely of the tuition rate increase.
A further and familiar consideration also bears
emphasis here. While tuition income is one of several
sources of income, it is a major source, comprising
49% of Operating Budget income. This makes it a
particularly important factor in reckoning the steps
which move the Operating Budget toward equili
brium. '
As important as economic and budget considera
tions are, a recommendation based upon them would
be subject to serious challenge if there were evidence
that Stanford was failing to attract and enroll the
most talented and promising students. We turn, there
fore, to discuss briefly the evidence gathered in
respect to that concern.
Private/Public Cost Differential
Because public institutions, particularly in Cali
fornia, are generally of high quality as well as re
maining less costly than private institutions, a proper
concern has been expressed that Stanford may lose
able students to these public institutions.
Information is not easily obtained regarding a
student's decision not to apply to Stanford, and,
therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether costs are
a factor in such cases. Data have, however, been
collected over the last few years which provide
information about the type of institutions chosen by
those students who were admitted to Stanford but
declined to enroll.

University of California, but the UC system drew
The data indicate that the percent choosing public
institutions has remained within a narrow range. This
is a somewhat surprising finding, particularly for
freshmen entering in the autumn of 1974-75, where
the data show a continued decrease in the percentage
of students choosing public institutions over private
ones.
Since the costs of attending Stanford during this
year showed no charp divergence from the relative
costs of attending other private or public universities,
the changes reflected are not easily explained in terms
of cost differentials.
A study was made of students in the class of 1977
and 1978 comparing the reasons cited for choosing
not to attend Stanford. While there was little change
in the responses to nonfinancial questions, the per
centage indicating that cost was a "strong influence"

in the decision not to come to Stanford fell two
points this year from 22 to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points from 12% to 15%. This difference was
mentioned more often by those choosing public
institutions (19%) than by those choosing private
schools (14%).
Since Stanford's financial aid policies are designed
to meet demonstrated need, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon could be the manner in which
financial aid is proportioned among gifts, loans, and
jobs. The Committee on Undergraduate Financial
Aids presently has aid "packaging" under review.
The private schools chosen by the ex-admittee

group changed little from last year. Harvard, Yale,
and MIT were our strongest competitors, attracting
38% of the students choosing other private institu
tions. Forty percent of those enrolling at public
schools chose one of the eight campuses of the
away fewer total students (50) than did Harvard
(134), or Yale (81)..
Tuition Rates at Other Universities
The recommended Stanford tuition increase, while
changing our relative position somewhat, will not
place us out of line with other (major private)
institutions. Of those institutions chosen by 10 or
more admitted freshmen, the average tuition will be
$3,822 . during 1975-76 providing the preliminary
estimates given reflect the rates actually set.
Since Stanford's budgeting process begins earlier
and tuition is set earlier than the corresponding
events occur at some of these institutions, it is quite
possible, especially in view of the economic condi
tions, that these estimates will be revised upward.
A comparision was made this year between the
proposed tuition rates provided by contacted institu
tions last autumn and the actual tuition rates set
later. Of the 13 institutions examined last year, eight
eventually established a tuition rate increase higher
than was estimated. Of those eight institutions, four
increased tuition by twice the earlier estimated rate.
Relationship Between Tuition Rate, Financial Aid
Policy and Enrollment Choices
Since the financial elements in our ability to
attract students whose families may hesitate on
economic grounds center in our financial aid pro
gram, the remainder of this background note focuses

there, particularly since 1975-76 will see some signifi
cant changes.
During 1975-76, a higher level of overall under
graduate financial need will result from the tuition
increase and from recent actions by the College
Scholarship Service. (CSS establishes the need assess
ment formula used by Stanford and most other
educational institutions.)
Both of these circumstances will lead to an in
creased allocation to financial aid. While budget plans
call for allocating to the Financial Aids Office suffi
cient funds to meet increased need resulting from the
increases in tuition, and room and board, the magni
tude of the CSS need assessment formula changes
necessitates a phased response. Before describing that
response, a brief review of the antecedents of the
change may be useful.
In recent years, concern has been expressed at

Stanford and elsewhere that middle income families
may be particularly hard pressed to meet the rising
cost of college. The actions which were taken by
Stanford in response appear to have produced posi
tive results for middle income families but at the
same time have increased financial pressure on the
University.
First, the Admissions Office has taken special
pains to emphasize the availability of financial aid
and the policy of meeting all demonstrated need. The
Financial Aids Office last year sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness to
reconsider family financial situations if it was
believed that aid awards were not adequate. In some
cases upward revisions of aid were made.
Second, an effort was made by the Director of
Financial Aid, in concert with his colleagues at other
institutions, to encourage the CSS to slow the accele
ration of the contribution formula in the middle
income ranges, thereby making middle income fami
lies more eligible for aid. Recently, the CSS did revise
the need assessment guidelines for 1975-76 and, as a
result, the expected parental contribution has been
lowered at various income levels, particularly in the
middle income ranges.
While the recent action by the CSS may alleviate
some of the financial pressure on middle income
families, the financial burden of meeting the in
creased need has now shifted to institutions and
government student aid programs.
At the national level, the CSS formula will raise
aggregate financial need of college students by an
estimated $BOO million. So far, the federal govern
ment has made no moves to allocate additional funds
available to meet this need; moreover, the Office of
Education is deeply concerned that funds will be
diverted from low income to middle income students
as financial aid pressures increase.
While the California State Scholarship Program has
been more responsive, the burden will still fall most
heavily on individual institutions. (While the CSS has
been sharply criticized for the precipitous nature of
the change and for the lack of consultation with
institutions, the revisions to the formula have been
generally accepted.)
At Stanford, somewhat more than one million
dollars over previously planned financial aid increases
would be required to apply the new formula to all
undergraduate students enrolled in 1975-76. Given
the University's present financial difficulties, this size
increase can be managed only through a phased
response.
Accordingly, the new curves will be applied to
freshmen entering in 1975-76. In each subsequent
year, the new freshman class will be covered. By
1978-79, the need assessment of all undergraduate
students will be calculated according to the new
formula.
Toward this end, budget plans call for an increase
in the General Funds allocation to financial aid from
$1.9 million in 1974-75 to $4.8 million in 1978-79.
During the period of transition, the University will
provide for all students greater access to subsidized
long-term loans and job opportunities. In individual
cases, where this might produce unreasonable in
debtedness or require excessive work during the
school year, additional scholarship help will be made
available.
Tuition increases affect graduate students some
what differently, since parental income and need
assessment formulae are less formally taken into
account.
In the case of teaching and research assistantships,
where a tuition grant is integral to the appointment,
the size of that grant will increase in proportion to
the tuition increase. The same is true for other tuition
grants, by definition.
Since loans also constitute the major source of
graduate financial aid, access to such funds will be
increased.
A Task Force was established in 1973-74 to review
lending procedures and to assess the availability of
loans and the equitability of loan terms. The Task
Force found loan supply and demand to be in
relatively good balance, assuming the continuation of
the status quo in respect to the federal programs and
continued support from the banking community for
the Federally Insured Student Loan program.
Such continued support appears assured. To assure
equitability, the Director of Financial Aids has
assumed responsibility for the coordination of all
loan policies within the University.

While each year's tuition recommendations repre
sent in the last analysis a judgment by University
officers, that judgment this year had its roots in four
sets of considerations:
The first set combines general economic condi
tions and indicators with income and expense projec
tions for Stanford. We will refer to this set as
economic and budget considerations.
The second reviews projected tuition at other
institutions.
The third concerns the cost differential between
public and private institutions.
And the fourth—the relationship between fresh
man admissions, financial aid, and enrollment
choices—deals with our continued ability to attract
and enroll a diverse and high quality student body.
Economic and Budget Considerations
Whatever else institutions of higher learning may
be insulated from, they are clearly not insulated from
many local, national, and international economic
forces.
Whatever the focus is next year's Operating Budget
orTong term financial equilibrium—or, as is now the
case at Stanford, both together as part of a unified
plan-the major elements of income, particularly tui
tion, must be viewed in an appropriate economic
context.
In the research work which is proceeding under
Prof. William Massy's direction, a strong relationship
has been established between the growth-rate of
tuition and the growth-rate of necessary Operating
Budget expenditures, including expenditures for
funded improvements (i.e., improvements brought
securely into the budget base).
There is, moreover, a reasonably clear relationship
between economic indicators of general cost rise and
the cost of meeting particular increases in the Univer
sity's basic expenditures. As was indicated in the
presentation of the Long Range Financial Forecast,
we are assuming these values for the pertinent infla
tion indices in 1975-76:
Consumer Price Index (national) = 9.0%
Gross National Product deflator = 7.5%
Bay Area Consumer Price Index = 8.0%
There is not, of course, a one-to-one correspon
dence between these measures and Stanford's costs.
And the budget task is to cover the University's
expenses, not those of the average consumer. Never
theless, within the frame of reference provided by
Prof. Massy's work, a modest degree of funded
improvement (1% of the prior year's base) requires
approximately 4.2% in real growth of tuition.
("Real" refers to the amount of the overall increase
which exceeds inflation.)
The 1% funded improvement factor contemplated
in 1975-76 marks a reduction by two-thirds in the
level of funded improvements experienced in the past
two years.
In sum, a 4.2% real growth would require tuition
increases from 11.7% to 13.2%, depending on the
measure of inflation selected.
Giving further emphasis to the economic inter-rela
tionships relevant to the tuition rate are the un
certainties introduced by timing. We are each year in
the position of estimating the economic conditions
which will obtain some 8 to 20 months hence.
Our tendencies are generally those of optimists.
Thus a year ago the 1974-75 tuition recommendation
of a 7.6% increase was based upon an inflation
estimate of 5%. Actual inflation appears likely to
exceed that figure by a wide margin this year. Thus
there is likely to be a real decline in tuition income
for 1974-75.
[When inflation is taken into account], tuition
rate increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 of between
10.5 and 11% would be required to produce real

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.
In sum, we can say that the 1975-76 recommenda
tion compensates—but does not overcompensate— for
the decline in real tuition income in 1974-75. The
recommended rate is no higher than it would have
been if our predictions of inflation had been more
accurate.
Leaving economic factors for the moment, a look
should be taken at the basic arithmetic of the tuition
income equation. Tuition income to the Operating
Budget is a product of three factors: autumn quarter
enrollment; returning enrollment ratios in succeeding
quarters; and the tuition rate. The estimated values
for the first two of these factors appear below:

Since the student body size is expected to remain
constant at the level budgeted for 1974-75 and the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is ex
pected to remain at 98% in winter and 91% in spring,
the increase in tuition income for 1975-76 will be a
function solely of the tuition rate increase.
A further and familiar consideration also bears
emphasis here. While tuition income is one of several
sources of income, it is a major source, comprising
49% of Operating Budget income. This makes it a
particularly important factor in reckoning the steps
which move the Operating Budget toward equili
brium. '
As important as economic and budget considera
tions are, a recommendation based upon them would
be subject to serious challenge if there were evidence
that Stanford was failing to attract and enroll the
most talented and promising students. We turn, there
fore, to discuss briefly the evidence gathered in
respect to that concern.
Private/Public Cost Differential
Because public institutions, particularly in Cali
fornia, are generally of high quality as well as re
maining less costly than private institutions, a proper
concern has been expressed that Stanford may lose
able students to these public institutions.
Information is not easily obtained regarding a
student's decision not to apply to Stanford, and,
therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether costs are
a factor in such cases. Data have, however, been
collected over the last few years which provide
information about the type of institutions chosen by
those students who were admitted to Stanford but
declined to enroll.

University of California, but the UC system drew
The data indicate that the percent choosing public
institutions has remained within a narrow range. This
is a somewhat surprising finding, particularly for
freshmen entering in the autumn of 1974-75, where
the data show a continued decrease in the percentage
of students choosing public institutions over private
ones.
Since the costs of attending Stanford during this
year showed no charp divergence from the relative
costs of attending other private or public universities,
the changes reflected are not easily explained in terms
of cost differentials.
A study was made of students in the class of 1977
and 1978 comparing the reasons cited for choosing
not to attend Stanford. While there was little change
in the responses to nonfinancial questions, the per
centage indicating that cost was a "strong influence"

in the decision not to come to Stanford fell two
points this year from 22 to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points from 12% to 15%. This difference was
mentioned more often by those choosing public
institutions (19%) than by those choosing private
schools (14%).
Since Stanford's financial aid policies are designed
to meet demonstrated need, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon could be the manner in which
financial aid is proportioned among gifts, loans, and
jobs. The Committee on Undergraduate Financial
Aids presently has aid "packaging" under review.
The private schools chosen by the ex-admittee

group changed little from last year. Harvard, Yale,
and MIT were our strongest competitors, attracting
38% of the students choosing other private institu
tions. Forty percent of those enrolling at public
schools chose one of the eight campuses of the
away fewer total students (50) than did Harvard
(134), or Yale (81)..
Tuition Rates at Other Universities
The recommended Stanford tuition increase, while
changing our relative position somewhat, will not
place us out of line with other (major private)
institutions. Of those institutions chosen by 10 or
more admitted freshmen, the average tuition will be
$3,822 . during 1975-76 providing the preliminary
estimates given reflect the rates actually set.
Since Stanford's budgeting process begins earlier
and tuition is set earlier than the corresponding
events occur at some of these institutions, it is quite
possible, especially in view of the economic condi
tions, that these estimates will be revised upward.
A comparision was made this year between the
proposed tuition rates provided by contacted institu
tions last autumn and the actual tuition rates set
later. Of the 13 institutions examined last year, eight
eventually established a tuition rate increase higher
than was estimated. Of those eight institutions, four
increased tuition by twice the earlier estimated rate.
Relationship Between Tuition Rate, Financial Aid
Policy and Enrollment Choices
Since the financial elements in our ability to
attract students whose families may hesitate on
economic grounds center in our financial aid pro
gram, the remainder of this background note focuses

there, particularly since 1975-76 will see some signifi
cant changes.
During 1975-76, a higher level of overall under
graduate financial need will result from the tuition
increase and from recent actions by the College
Scholarship Service. (CSS establishes the need assess
ment formula used by Stanford and most other
educational institutions.)
Both of these circumstances will lead to an in
creased allocation to financial aid. While budget plans
call for allocating to the Financial Aids Office suffi
cient funds to meet increased need resulting from the
increases in tuition, and room and board, the magni
tude of the CSS need assessment formula changes
necessitates a phased response. Before describing that
response, a brief review of the antecedents of the
change may be useful.
In recent years, concern has been expressed at

Stanford and elsewhere that middle income families
may be particularly hard pressed to meet the rising
cost of college. The actions which were taken by
Stanford in response appear to have produced posi
tive results for middle income families but at the
same time have increased financial pressure on the
University.
First, the Admissions Office has taken special
pains to emphasize the availability of financial aid
and the policy of meeting all demonstrated need. The
Financial Aids Office last year sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness to
reconsider family financial situations if it was
believed that aid awards were not adequate. In some
cases upward revisions of aid were made.
Second, an effort was made by the Director of
Financial Aid, in concert with his colleagues at other
institutions, to encourage the CSS to slow the accele
ration of the contribution formula in the middle
income ranges, thereby making middle income fami
lies more eligible for aid. Recently, the CSS did revise
the need assessment guidelines for 1975-76 and, as a
result, the expected parental contribution has been
lowered at various income levels, particularly in the
middle income ranges.
While the recent action by the CSS may alleviate
some of the financial pressure on middle income
families, the financial burden of meeting the in
creased need has now shifted to institutions and
government student aid programs.
At the national level, the CSS formula will raise
aggregate financial need of college students by an
estimated $BOO million. So far, the federal govern
ment has made no moves to allocate additional funds
available to meet this need; moreover, the Office of
Education is deeply concerned that funds will be
diverted from low income to middle income students
as financial aid pressures increase.
While the California State Scholarship Program has
been more responsive, the burden will still fall most
heavily on individual institutions. (While the CSS has
been sharply criticized for the precipitous nature of
the change and for the lack of consultation with
institutions, the revisions to the formula have been
generally accepted.)
At Stanford, somewhat more than one million
dollars over previously planned financial aid increases
would be required to apply the new formula to all
undergraduate students enrolled in 1975-76. Given
the University's present financial difficulties, this size
increase can be managed only through a phased
response.
Accordingly, the new curves will be applied to
freshmen entering in 1975-76. In each subsequent
year, the new freshman class will be covered. By
1978-79, the need assessment of all undergraduate
students will be calculated according to the new
formula.
Toward this end, budget plans call for an increase
in the General Funds allocation to financial aid from
$1.9 million in 1974-75 to $4.8 million in 1978-79.
During the period of transition, the University will
provide for all students greater access to subsidized
long-term loans and job opportunities. In individual
cases, where this might produce unreasonable in
debtedness or require excessive work during the
school year, additional scholarship help will be made
available.
Tuition increases affect graduate students some
what differently, since parental income and need
assessment formulae are less formally taken into
account.
In the case of teaching and research assistantships,
where a tuition grant is integral to the appointment,
the size of that grant will increase in proportion to
the tuition increase. The same is true for other tuition
grants, by definition.
Since loans also constitute the major source of
graduate financial aid, access to such funds will be
increased.
A Task Force was established in 1973-74 to review
lending procedures and to assess the availability of
loans and the equitability of loan terms. The Task
Force found loan supply and demand to be in
relatively good balance, assuming the continuation of
the status quo in respect to the federal programs and
continued support from the banking community for
the Federally Insured Student Loan program.
Such continued support appears assured. To assure
equitability, the Director of Financial Aids has
assumed responsibility for the coordination of all
loan policies within the University.

be insulated from, they are clearly not insulated from
many local, national, and international economic
forces.
Whatever the focus is next year's Operating Budget
orTong term financial equilibrium—or, as is now the
case at Stanford, both together as part of a unified
plan-the major elements of income, particularly tui
tion, must be viewed in an appropriate economic
context.
In the research work which is proceeding under
Prof. William Massy's direction, a strong relationship
has been established between the growth-rate of
tuition and the growth-rate of necessary Operating
Budget expenditures, including expenditures for
funded improvements (i.e., improvements brought
securely into the budget base).
There is, moreover, a reasonably clear relationship
between economic indicators of general cost rise and
the cost of meeting particular increases in the Univer
sity's basic expenditures. As was indicated in the
presentation of the Long Range Financial Forecast,
we are assuming these values for the pertinent infla
tion indices in 1975-76:
Consumer Price Index (national) = 9.0%
Gross National Product deflator = 7.5%
Bay Area Consumer Price Index = 8.0%
There is not, of course, a one-to-one correspon
dence between these measures and Stanford's costs.
And the budget task is to cover the University's
expenses, not those of the average consumer. Never
theless, within the frame of reference provided by
Prof. Massy's work, a modest degree of funded
improvement (1% of the prior year's base) requires
approximately 4.2% in real growth of tuition.
("Real" refers to the amount of the overall increase
which exceeds inflation.)
The 1% funded improvement factor contemplated
in 1975-76 marks a reduction by two-thirds in the
level of funded improvements experienced in the past
two years.
In sum, a 4.2% real growth would require tuition
increases from 11.7% to 13.2%, depending on the
measure of inflation selected.
Giving further emphasis to the economic inter-rela
tionships relevant to the tuition rate are the un
certainties introduced by timing. We are each year in
the position of estimating the economic conditions
which will obtain some 8 to 20 months hence.
Our tendencies are generally those of optimists.
Thus a year ago the 1974-75 tuition recommendation
of a 7.6% increase was based upon an inflation
estimate of 5%. Actual inflation appears likely to
exceed that figure by a wide margin this year. Thus
there is likely to be a real decline in tuition income
for 1974-75.
[When inflation is taken into account], tuition
rate increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 of between
10.5 and 11% would be required to produce real

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.
In sum, we can say that the 1975-76 recommenda
tion compensates—but does not overcompensate— for
the decline in real tuition income in 1974-75. The
recommended rate is no higher than it would have
been if our predictions of inflation had been more
accurate.
Leaving economic factors for the moment, a look
should be taken at the basic arithmetic of the tuition
income equation. Tuition income to the Operating
Budget is a product of three factors: autumn quarter
enrollment; returning enrollment ratios in succeeding
quarters; and the tuition rate. The estimated values
for the first two of these factors appear below:

Since the student body size is expected to remain
constant at the level budgeted for 1974-75 and the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is ex
pected to remain at 98% in winter and 91% in spring,
the increase in tuition income for 1975-76 will be a
function solely of the tuition rate increase.
A further and familiar consideration also bears
emphasis here. While tuition income is one of several
sources of income, it is a major source, comprising
49% of Operating Budget income. This makes it a
particularly important factor in reckoning the steps
which move the Operating Budget toward equili
brium. '
As important as economic and budget considera
tions are, a recommendation based upon them would
be subject to serious challenge if there were evidence
that Stanford was failing to attract and enroll the
most talented and promising students. We turn, there
fore, to discuss briefly the evidence gathered in
respect to that concern.
Private/Public Cost Differential
Because public institutions, particularly in Cali
fornia, are generally of high quality as well as re
maining less costly than private institutions, a proper
concern has been expressed that Stanford may lose
able students to these public institutions.
Information is not easily obtained regarding a
student's decision not to apply to Stanford, and,
therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether costs are
a factor in such cases. Data have, however, been
collected over the last few years which provide
information about the type of institutions chosen by
those students who were admitted to Stanford but
declined to enroll.

University of California, but the UC system drew
The data indicate that the percent choosing public
institutions has remained within a narrow range. This
is a somewhat surprising finding, particularly for
freshmen entering in the autumn of 1974-75, where
the data show a continued decrease in the percentage
of students choosing public institutions over private
ones.
Since the costs of attending Stanford during this
year showed no charp divergence from the relative
costs of attending other private or public universities,
the changes reflected are not easily explained in terms
of cost differentials.
A study was made of students in the class of 1977
and 1978 comparing the reasons cited for choosing
not to attend Stanford. While there was little change
in the responses to nonfinancial questions, the per
centage indicating that cost was a "strong influence"

in the decision not to come to Stanford fell two
points this year from 22 to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points from 12% to 15%. This difference was
mentioned more often by those choosing public
institutions (19%) than by those choosing private
schools (14%).
Since Stanford's financial aid policies are designed
to meet demonstrated need, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon could be the manner in which
financial aid is proportioned among gifts, loans, and
jobs. The Committee on Undergraduate Financial
Aids presently has aid "packaging" under review.
The private schools chosen by the ex-admittee

group changed little from last year. Harvard, Yale,
and MIT were our strongest competitors, attracting
38% of the students choosing other private institu
tions. Forty percent of those enrolling at public
schools chose one of the eight campuses of the
away fewer total students (50) than did Harvard
(134), or Yale (81)..
Tuition Rates at Other Universities
The recommended Stanford tuition increase, while
changing our relative position somewhat, will not
place us out of line with other (major private)
institutions. Of those institutions chosen by 10 or
more admitted freshmen, the average tuition will be
$3,822 . during 1975-76 providing the preliminary
estimates given reflect the rates actually set.
Since Stanford's budgeting process begins earlier
and tuition is set earlier than the corresponding
events occur at some of these institutions, it is quite
possible, especially in view of the economic condi
tions, that these estimates will be revised upward.
A comparision was made this year between the
proposed tuition rates provided by contacted institu
tions last autumn and the actual tuition rates set
later. Of the 13 institutions examined last year, eight
eventually established a tuition rate increase higher
than was estimated. Of those eight institutions, four
increased tuition by twice the earlier estimated rate.
Relationship Between Tuition Rate, Financial Aid
Policy and Enrollment Choices
Since the financial elements in our ability to
attract students whose families may hesitate on
economic grounds center in our financial aid pro
gram, the remainder of this background note focuses

there, particularly since 1975-76 will see some signifi
cant changes.
During 1975-76, a higher level of overall under
graduate financial need will result from the tuition
increase and from recent actions by the College
Scholarship Service. (CSS establishes the need assess
ment formula used by Stanford and most other
educational institutions.)
Both of these circumstances will lead to an in
creased allocation to financial aid. While budget plans
call for allocating to the Financial Aids Office suffi
cient funds to meet increased need resulting from the
increases in tuition, and room and board, the magni
tude of the CSS need assessment formula changes
necessitates a phased response. Before describing that
response, a brief review of the antecedents of the
change may be useful.
In recent years, concern has been expressed at

Stanford and elsewhere that middle income families
may be particularly hard pressed to meet the rising
cost of college. The actions which were taken by
Stanford in response appear to have produced posi
tive results for middle income families but at the
same time have increased financial pressure on the
University.
First, the Admissions Office has taken special
pains to emphasize the availability of financial aid
and the policy of meeting all demonstrated need. The
Financial Aids Office last year sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness to
reconsider family financial situations if it was
believed that aid awards were not adequate. In some
cases upward revisions of aid were made.
Second, an effort was made by the Director of
Financial Aid, in concert with his colleagues at other
institutions, to encourage the CSS to slow the accele
ration of the contribution formula in the middle
income ranges, thereby making middle income fami
lies more eligible for aid. Recently, the CSS did revise
the need assessment guidelines for 1975-76 and, as a
result, the expected parental contribution has been
lowered at various income levels, particularly in the
middle income ranges.
While the recent action by the CSS may alleviate
some of the financial pressure on middle income
families, the financial burden of meeting the in
creased need has now shifted to institutions and
government student aid programs.
At the national level, the CSS formula will raise
aggregate financial need of college students by an
estimated $BOO million. So far, the federal govern
ment has made no moves to allocate additional funds
available to meet this need; moreover, the Office of
Education is deeply concerned that funds will be
diverted from low income to middle income students
as financial aid pressures increase.
While the California State Scholarship Program has
been more responsive, the burden will still fall most
heavily on individual institutions. (While the CSS has
been sharply criticized for the precipitous nature of
the change and for the lack of consultation with
institutions, the revisions to the formula have been
generally accepted.)
At Stanford, somewhat more than one million
dollars over previously planned financial aid increases
would be required to apply the new formula to all
undergraduate students enrolled in 1975-76. Given
the University's present financial difficulties, this size
increase can be managed only through a phased
response.
Accordingly, the new curves will be applied to
freshmen entering in 1975-76. In each subsequent
year, the new freshman class will be covered. By
1978-79, the need assessment of all undergraduate
students will be calculated according to the new
formula.
Toward this end, budget plans call for an increase
in the General Funds allocation to financial aid from
$1.9 million in 1974-75 to $4.8 million in 1978-79.
During the period of transition, the University will
provide for all students greater access to subsidized
long-term loans and job opportunities. In individual
cases, where this might produce unreasonable in
debtedness or require excessive work during the
school year, additional scholarship help will be made
available.
Tuition increases affect graduate students some
what differently, since parental income and need
assessment formulae are less formally taken into
account.
In the case of teaching and research assistantships,
where a tuition grant is integral to the appointment,
the size of that grant will increase in proportion to
the tuition increase. The same is true for other tuition
grants, by definition.
Since loans also constitute the major source of
graduate financial aid, access to such funds will be
increased.
A Task Force was established in 1973-74 to review
lending procedures and to assess the availability of
loans and the equitability of loan terms. The Task
Force found loan supply and demand to be in
relatively good balance, assuming the continuation of
the status quo in respect to the federal programs and
continued support from the banking community for
the Federally Insured Student Loan program.
Such continued support appears assured. To assure
equitability, the Director of Financial Aids has
assumed responsibility for the coordination of all
loan policies within the University.

Following are excerpts from a background paper

proposed tuition increase:
Background
A comparison of the 1974-75 rates with the
1975-76 recommendations is as follows:

1974-75 1975-76 Increase Increase
General Tuition $3,375 $3,810 $435 12.88

Business $3,600 $3,990 $390 10.80
While each year's tuition recommendations repre
sent in the last analysis a judgment by University
officers, that judgment this year had its roots in four
sets of considerations:
The first set combines general economic condi
tions and indicators with income and expense projec
tions for Stanford. We will refer to this set as
economic and budget considerations.
The second reviews projected tuition at other
institutions.
The third concerns the cost differential between
public and private institutions.
And the fourth—the relationship between fresh
man admissions, financial aid, and enrollment
choices—deals with our continued ability to attract
and enroll a diverse and high quality student body.

between economic indicators of general cost rise and
the cost of meeting particular increases in the Univer
sity's basic expenditures. As was indicated in the
presentation of the Long Range Financial Forecast,
we are assuming these values for the pertinent infla
tion indices in 1975-76:
Consumer Price Index (national) = 9.0%
Gross National Product deflator = 7.5%
Bay Area Consumer Price Index = 8.0%
There is not, of course, a one-to-one correspon
dence between these measures and Stanford's costs.
And the budget task is to cover the University's
expenses, not those of the average consumer. Never
theless, within the frame of reference provided by
Prof. Massy's work, a modest degree of funded
improvement (1% of the prior year's base) requires
approximately 4.2% in real growth of tuition.
("Real" refers to the amount of the overall increase
which exceeds inflation.)
The 1% funded improvement factor contemplated
in 1975-76 marks a reduction by two-thirds in the
level of funded improvements experienced in the past
two years.
In sum, a 4.2% real growth would require tuition
increases from 11.7% to 13.2%, depending on the
measure of inflation selected.
Giving further emphasis to the economic inter-rela
tionships relevant to the tuition rate are the un
certainties introduced by timing. We are each year in
the position of estimating the economic conditions
which will obtain some 8 to 20 months hence.
Our tendencies are generally those of optimists.
Thus a year ago the 1974-75 tuition recommendation
of a 7.6% increase was based upon an inflation
estimate of 5%. Actual inflation appears likely to
exceed that figure by a wide margin this year. Thus
there is likely to be a real decline in tuition income
for 1974-75.
[When inflation is taken into account], tuition
rate increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 of between
10.5 and 11% would be required to produce real

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.
In sum, we can say that the 1975-76 recommenda
tion compensates—but does not overcompensate— for
the decline in real tuition income in 1974-75. The
recommended rate is no higher than it would have
been if our predictions of inflation had been more
accurate.
Leaving economic factors for the moment, a look
should be taken at the basic arithmetic of the tuition
income equation. Tuition income to the Operating
Budget is a product of three factors: autumn quarter
enrollment; returning enrollment ratios in succeeding
quarters; and the tuition rate. The estimated values
for the first two of these factors appear below:

Since the student body size is expected to remain
constant at the level budgeted for 1974-75 and the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is ex
pected to remain at 98% in winter and 91% in spring,
the increase in tuition income for 1975-76 will be a
function solely of the tuition rate increase.
A further and familiar consideration also bears
emphasis here. While tuition income is one of several
sources of income, it is a major source, comprising
49% of Operating Budget income. This makes it a
particularly important factor in reckoning the steps
which move the Operating Budget toward equili
brium. '
As important as economic and budget considera
tions are, a recommendation based upon them would
be subject to serious challenge if there were evidence
that Stanford was failing to attract and enroll the
most talented and promising students. We turn, there
fore, to discuss briefly the evidence gathered in
respect to that concern.
Private/Public Cost Differential
Because public institutions, particularly in Cali
fornia, are generally of high quality as well as re
maining less costly than private institutions, a proper
concern has been expressed that Stanford may lose
able students to these public institutions.
Information is not easily obtained regarding a
student's decision not to apply to Stanford, and,
therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether costs are
a factor in such cases. Data have, however, been
collected over the last few years which provide
information about the type of institutions chosen by
those students who were admitted to Stanford but
declined to enroll.

University of California, but the UC system drew
The data indicate that the percent choosing public
institutions has remained within a narrow range. This
is a somewhat surprising finding, particularly for
freshmen entering in the autumn of 1974-75, where
the data show a continued decrease in the percentage
of students choosing public institutions over private
ones.
Since the costs of attending Stanford during this
year showed no charp divergence from the relative
costs of attending other private or public universities,
the changes reflected are not easily explained in terms
of cost differentials.
A study was made of students in the class of 1977
and 1978 comparing the reasons cited for choosing
not to attend Stanford. While there was little change
in the responses to nonfinancial questions, the per
centage indicating that cost was a "strong influence"

in the decision not to come to Stanford fell two
points this year from 22 to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points from 12% to 15%. This difference was
mentioned more often by those choosing public
institutions (19%) than by those choosing private
schools (14%).
Since Stanford's financial aid policies are designed
to meet demonstrated need, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon could be the manner in which
financial aid is proportioned among gifts, loans, and
jobs. The Committee on Undergraduate Financial
Aids presently has aid "packaging" under review.
The private schools chosen by the ex-admittee

group changed little from last year. Harvard, Yale,
and MIT were our strongest competitors, attracting
38% of the students choosing other private institu
tions. Forty percent of those enrolling at public
schools chose one of the eight campuses of the
away fewer total students (50) than did Harvard
(134), or Yale (81)..
Tuition Rates at Other Universities
The recommended Stanford tuition increase, while
changing our relative position somewhat, will not
place us out of line with other (major private)
institutions. Of those institutions chosen by 10 or
more admitted freshmen, the average tuition will be
$3,822 . during 1975-76 providing the preliminary
estimates given reflect the rates actually set.
Since Stanford's budgeting process begins earlier
and tuition is set earlier than the corresponding
events occur at some of these institutions, it is quite
possible, especially in view of the economic condi
tions, that these estimates will be revised upward.
A comparision was made this year between the
proposed tuition rates provided by contacted institu
tions last autumn and the actual tuition rates set
later. Of the 13 institutions examined last year, eight
eventually established a tuition rate increase higher
than was estimated. Of those eight institutions, four
increased tuition by twice the earlier estimated rate.
Relationship Between Tuition Rate, Financial Aid
Policy and Enrollment Choices
Since the financial elements in our ability to
attract students whose families may hesitate on
economic grounds center in our financial aid pro
gram, the remainder of this background note focuses

there, particularly since 1975-76 will see some signifi
cant changes.
During 1975-76, a higher level of overall under
graduate financial need will result from the tuition
increase and from recent actions by the College
Scholarship Service. (CSS establishes the need assess
ment formula used by Stanford and most other
educational institutions.)
Both of these circumstances will lead to an in
creased allocation to financial aid. While budget plans
call for allocating to the Financial Aids Office suffi
cient funds to meet increased need resulting from the
increases in tuition, and room and board, the magni
tude of the CSS need assessment formula changes
necessitates a phased response. Before describing that
response, a brief review of the antecedents of the
change may be useful.
In recent years, concern has been expressed at

Stanford and elsewhere that middle income families
may be particularly hard pressed to meet the rising
cost of college. The actions which were taken by
Stanford in response appear to have produced posi
tive results for middle income families but at the
same time have increased financial pressure on the
University.
First, the Admissions Office has taken special
pains to emphasize the availability of financial aid
and the policy of meeting all demonstrated need. The
Financial Aids Office last year sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness to
reconsider family financial situations if it was
believed that aid awards were not adequate. In some
cases upward revisions of aid were made.
Second, an effort was made by the Director of
Financial Aid, in concert with his colleagues at other
institutions, to encourage the CSS to slow the accele
ration of the contribution formula in the middle
income ranges, thereby making middle income fami
lies more eligible for aid. Recently, the CSS did revise
the need assessment guidelines for 1975-76 and, as a
result, the expected parental contribution has been
lowered at various income levels, particularly in the
middle income ranges.
While the recent action by the CSS may alleviate
some of the financial pressure on middle income
families, the financial burden of meeting the in
creased need has now shifted to institutions and
government student aid programs.
At the national level, the CSS formula will raise
aggregate financial need of college students by an
estimated $BOO million. So far, the federal govern
ment has made no moves to allocate additional funds
available to meet this need; moreover, the Office of
Education is deeply concerned that funds will be
diverted from low income to middle income students
as financial aid pressures increase.
While the California State Scholarship Program has
been more responsive, the burden will still fall most
heavily on individual institutions. (While the CSS has
been sharply criticized for the precipitous nature of
the change and for the lack of consultation with
institutions, the revisions to the formula have been
generally accepted.)
At Stanford, somewhat more than one million
dollars over previously planned financial aid increases
would be required to apply the new formula to all
undergraduate students enrolled in 1975-76. Given
the University's present financial difficulties, this size
increase can be managed only through a phased
response.
Accordingly, the new curves will be applied to
freshmen entering in 1975-76. In each subsequent
year, the new freshman class will be covered. By
1978-79, the need assessment of all undergraduate
students will be calculated according to the new
formula.
Toward this end, budget plans call for an increase
in the General Funds allocation to financial aid from
$1.9 million in 1974-75 to $4.8 million in 1978-79.
During the period of transition, the University will
provide for all students greater access to subsidized
long-term loans and job opportunities. In individual
cases, where this might produce unreasonable in
debtedness or require excessive work during the
school year, additional scholarship help will be made
available.
Tuition increases affect graduate students some
what differently, since parental income and need
assessment formulae are less formally taken into
account.
In the case of teaching and research assistantships,
where a tuition grant is integral to the appointment,
the size of that grant will increase in proportion to
the tuition increase. The same is true for other tuition
grants, by definition.
Since loans also constitute the major source of
graduate financial aid, access to such funds will be
increased.
A Task Force was established in 1973-74 to review
lending procedures and to assess the availability of
loans and the equitability of loan terms. The Task
Force found loan supply and demand to be in
relatively good balance, assuming the continuation of
the status quo in respect to the federal programs and
continued support from the banking community for
the Federally Insured Student Loan program.
Such continued support appears assured. To assure
equitability, the Director of Financial Aids has
assumed responsibility for the coordination of all
loan policies within the University.

Following are excerpts from a background paper

proposed tuition increase:
Background
A comparison of the 1974-75 rates with the
1975-76 recommendations is as follows:
Type From To % of
1974-75 1975-76 Increase Increase
General Tuition $3,375 $3,810 $435 12.88

(M.D. Program) $3,570 $4,005 $435 12.88
Graduate School of
Business $3,600 $3,990 $390 10.80
While each year's tuition recommendations repre
sent in the last analysis a judgment by University
officers, that judgment this year had its roots in four
sets of considerations:
The first set combines general economic condi
tions and indicators with income and expense projec
tions for Stanford. We will refer to this set as
economic and budget considerations.
The second reviews projected tuition at other
institutions.
The third concerns the cost differential between
public and private institutions.
And the fourth—the relationship between fresh
man admissions, financial aid, and enrollment
choices—deals with our continued ability to attract
and enroll a diverse and high quality student body.
Economic and Budget Considerations
Whatever else institutions of higher learning may
be insulated from, they are clearly not insulated from
many local, national, and international economic
forces.
Whatever the focus is next year's Operating Budget
orTong term financial equilibrium—or, as is now the
case at Stanford, both together as part of a unified
plan-the major elements of income, particularly tui
tion, must be viewed in an appropriate economic
context.
In the research work which is proceeding under
Prof. William Massy's direction, a strong relationship
has been established between the growth-rate of
tuition and the growth-rate of necessary Operating
Budget expenditures, including expenditures for
funded improvements (i.e., improvements brought
securely into the budget base).
There is, moreover, a reasonably clear relationship
between economic indicators of general cost rise and
the cost of meeting particular increases in the Univer
sity's basic expenditures. As was indicated in the
presentation of the Long Range Financial Forecast,
we are assuming these values for the pertinent infla
tion indices in 1975-76:
Consumer Price Index (national) = 9.0%
Gross National Product deflator = 7.5%

Prof. Massy's work, a modest degree of funded
improvement (1% of the prior year's base) requires
approximately 4.2% in real growth of tuition.
("Real" refers to the amount of the overall increase
which exceeds inflation.)
The 1% funded improvement factor contemplated
in 1975-76 marks a reduction by two-thirds in the
level of funded improvements experienced in the past
two years.
In sum, a 4.2% real growth would require tuition
increases from 11.7% to 13.2%, depending on the
measure of inflation selected.
Giving further emphasis to the economic inter-rela
tionships relevant to the tuition rate are the un
certainties introduced by timing. We are each year in
the position of estimating the economic conditions
which will obtain some 8 to 20 months hence.
Our tendencies are generally those of optimists.
Thus a year ago the 1974-75 tuition recommendation
of a 7.6% increase was based upon an inflation
estimate of 5%. Actual inflation appears likely to
exceed that figure by a wide margin this year. Thus
there is likely to be a real decline in tuition income
for 1974-75.
[When inflation is taken into account], tuition
rate increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 of between
10.5 and 11% would be required to produce real

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.
In sum, we can say that the 1975-76 recommenda
tion compensates—but does not overcompensate— for
the decline in real tuition income in 1974-75. The
recommended rate is no higher than it would have
been if our predictions of inflation had been more
accurate.
Leaving economic factors for the moment, a look
should be taken at the basic arithmetic of the tuition
income equation. Tuition income to the Operating
Budget is a product of three factors: autumn quarter
enrollment; returning enrollment ratios in succeeding
quarters; and the tuition rate. The estimated values
for the first two of these factors appear below:

Since the student body size is expected to remain
constant at the level budgeted for 1974-75 and the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is ex
pected to remain at 98% in winter and 91% in spring,
the increase in tuition income for 1975-76 will be a
function solely of the tuition rate increase.
A further and familiar consideration also bears
emphasis here. While tuition income is one of several
sources of income, it is a major source, comprising
49% of Operating Budget income. This makes it a
particularly important factor in reckoning the steps
which move the Operating Budget toward equili
brium. '
As important as economic and budget considera
tions are, a recommendation based upon them would
be subject to serious challenge if there were evidence
that Stanford was failing to attract and enroll the
most talented and promising students. We turn, there
fore, to discuss briefly the evidence gathered in
respect to that concern.
Private/Public Cost Differential
Because public institutions, particularly in Cali
fornia, are generally of high quality as well as re
maining less costly than private institutions, a proper
concern has been expressed that Stanford may lose
able students to these public institutions.
Information is not easily obtained regarding a
student's decision not to apply to Stanford, and,
therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether costs are
a factor in such cases. Data have, however, been
collected over the last few years which provide
information about the type of institutions chosen by
those students who were admitted to Stanford but
declined to enroll.

University of California, but the UC system drew
The data indicate that the percent choosing public
institutions has remained within a narrow range. This
is a somewhat surprising finding, particularly for
freshmen entering in the autumn of 1974-75, where
the data show a continued decrease in the percentage
of students choosing public institutions over private
ones.
Since the costs of attending Stanford during this
year showed no charp divergence from the relative
costs of attending other private or public universities,
the changes reflected are not easily explained in terms
of cost differentials.
A study was made of students in the class of 1977
and 1978 comparing the reasons cited for choosing
not to attend Stanford. While there was little change
in the responses to nonfinancial questions, the per
centage indicating that cost was a "strong influence"

in the decision not to come to Stanford fell two
points this year from 22 to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points from 12% to 15%. This difference was
mentioned more often by those choosing public
institutions (19%) than by those choosing private
schools (14%).
Since Stanford's financial aid policies are designed
to meet demonstrated need, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon could be the manner in which
financial aid is proportioned among gifts, loans, and
jobs. The Committee on Undergraduate Financial
Aids presently has aid "packaging" under review.
The private schools chosen by the ex-admittee

group changed little from last year. Harvard, Yale,
and MIT were our strongest competitors, attracting
38% of the students choosing other private institu
tions. Forty percent of those enrolling at public
schools chose one of the eight campuses of the
away fewer total students (50) than did Harvard
(134), or Yale (81)..
Tuition Rates at Other Universities
The recommended Stanford tuition increase, while
changing our relative position somewhat, will not
place us out of line with other (major private)
institutions. Of those institutions chosen by 10 or
more admitted freshmen, the average tuition will be
$3,822 . during 1975-76 providing the preliminary
estimates given reflect the rates actually set.
Since Stanford's budgeting process begins earlier
and tuition is set earlier than the corresponding
events occur at some of these institutions, it is quite
possible, especially in view of the economic condi
tions, that these estimates will be revised upward.
A comparision was made this year between the
proposed tuition rates provided by contacted institu
tions last autumn and the actual tuition rates set
later. Of the 13 institutions examined last year, eight
eventually established a tuition rate increase higher
than was estimated. Of those eight institutions, four
increased tuition by twice the earlier estimated rate.
Relationship Between Tuition Rate, Financial Aid
Policy and Enrollment Choices
Since the financial elements in our ability to
attract students whose families may hesitate on
economic grounds center in our financial aid pro
gram, the remainder of this background note focuses

there, particularly since 1975-76 will see some signifi
cant changes.
During 1975-76, a higher level of overall under
graduate financial need will result from the tuition
increase and from recent actions by the College
Scholarship Service. (CSS establishes the need assess
ment formula used by Stanford and most other
educational institutions.)
Both of these circumstances will lead to an in
creased allocation to financial aid. While budget plans
call for allocating to the Financial Aids Office suffi
cient funds to meet increased need resulting from the
increases in tuition, and room and board, the magni
tude of the CSS need assessment formula changes
necessitates a phased response. Before describing that
response, a brief review of the antecedents of the
change may be useful.
In recent years, concern has been expressed at

Stanford and elsewhere that middle income families
may be particularly hard pressed to meet the rising
cost of college. The actions which were taken by
Stanford in response appear to have produced posi
tive results for middle income families but at the
same time have increased financial pressure on the
University.
First, the Admissions Office has taken special
pains to emphasize the availability of financial aid
and the policy of meeting all demonstrated need. The
Financial Aids Office last year sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness to
reconsider family financial situations if it was
believed that aid awards were not adequate. In some
cases upward revisions of aid were made.
Second, an effort was made by the Director of
Financial Aid, in concert with his colleagues at other
institutions, to encourage the CSS to slow the accele
ration of the contribution formula in the middle
income ranges, thereby making middle income fami
lies more eligible for aid. Recently, the CSS did revise
the need assessment guidelines for 1975-76 and, as a
result, the expected parental contribution has been
lowered at various income levels, particularly in the
middle income ranges.
While the recent action by the CSS may alleviate
some of the financial pressure on middle income
families, the financial burden of meeting the in
creased need has now shifted to institutions and
government student aid programs.
At the national level, the CSS formula will raise
aggregate financial need of college students by an
estimated $BOO million. So far, the federal govern
ment has made no moves to allocate additional funds
available to meet this need; moreover, the Office of
Education is deeply concerned that funds will be
diverted from low income to middle income students
as financial aid pressures increase.
While the California State Scholarship Program has
been more responsive, the burden will still fall most
heavily on individual institutions. (While the CSS has
been sharply criticized for the precipitous nature of
the change and for the lack of consultation with
institutions, the revisions to the formula have been
generally accepted.)
At Stanford, somewhat more than one million
dollars over previously planned financial aid increases
would be required to apply the new formula to all
undergraduate students enrolled in 1975-76. Given
the University's present financial difficulties, this size
increase can be managed only through a phased
response.
Accordingly, the new curves will be applied to
freshmen entering in 1975-76. In each subsequent
year, the new freshman class will be covered. By
1978-79, the need assessment of all undergraduate
students will be calculated according to the new
formula.
Toward this end, budget plans call for an increase
in the General Funds allocation to financial aid from
$1.9 million in 1974-75 to $4.8 million in 1978-79.
During the period of transition, the University will
provide for all students greater access to subsidized
long-term loans and job opportunities. In individual
cases, where this might produce unreasonable in
debtedness or require excessive work during the
school year, additional scholarship help will be made
available.
Tuition increases affect graduate students some
what differently, since parental income and need
assessment formulae are less formally taken into
account.
In the case of teaching and research assistantships,
where a tuition grant is integral to the appointment,
the size of that grant will increase in proportion to
the tuition increase. The same is true for other tuition
grants, by definition.
Since loans also constitute the major source of
graduate financial aid, access to such funds will be
increased.
A Task Force was established in 1973-74 to review
lending procedures and to assess the availability of
loans and the equitability of loan terms. The Task
Force found loan supply and demand to be in
relatively good balance, assuming the continuation of
the status quo in respect to the federal programs and
continued support from the banking community for
the Federally Insured Student Loan program.
Such continued support appears assured. To assure
equitability, the Director of Financial Aids has
assumed responsibility for the coordination of all
loan policies within the University.

Following are excerpts from a background paper

proposed tuition increase:
Background
A comparison of the 1974-75 rates with the
1975-76 recommendations is as follows:
Type From To % of
1974-75 1975-76 Increase Increase
General Tuition $3,375 $3,810 $435 12.88

(M.D. Program) $3,570 $4,005 $435 12.88
Graduate School of
Business $3,600 $3,990 $390 10.80
While each year's tuition recommendations repre
sent in the last analysis a judgment by University
officers, that judgment this year had its roots in four
sets of considerations:
The first set combines general economic condi
tions and indicators with income and expense projec
tions for Stanford. We will refer to this set as
economic and budget considerations.
The second reviews projected tuition at other
institutions.
The third concerns the cost differential between
public and private institutions.
And the fourth—the relationship between fresh
man admissions, financial aid, and enrollment
choices—deals with our continued ability to attract
and enroll a diverse and high quality student body.
Economic and Budget Considerations
Whatever else institutions of higher learning may
be insulated from, they are clearly not insulated from
many local, national, and international economic
forces.
Whatever the focus is next year's Operating Budget
orTong term financial equilibrium—or, as is now the
case at Stanford, both together as part of a unified
plan-the major elements of income, particularly tui
tion, must be viewed in an appropriate economic
context.
In the research work which is proceeding under
Prof. William Massy's direction, a strong relationship
has been established between the growth-rate of
tuition and the growth-rate of necessary Operating
Budget expenditures, including expenditures for
funded improvements (i.e., improvements brought
securely into the budget base).
There is, moreover, a reasonably clear relationship
between economic indicators of general cost rise and
the cost of meeting particular increases in the Univer
sity's basic expenditures. As was indicated in the
presentation of the Long Range Financial Forecast,
we are assuming these values for the pertinent infla
tion indices in 1975-76:
Consumer Price Index (national) = 9.0%
Gross National Product deflator = 7.5%
Bay Area Consumer Price Index = 8.0%
There is not, of course, a one-to-one correspon
dence between these measures and Stanford's costs.
And the budget task is to cover the University's
expenses, not those of the average consumer. Never
theless, within the frame of reference provided by
Prof. Massy's work, a modest degree of funded
improvement (1% of the prior year's base) requires
approximately 4.2% in real growth of tuition.

which exceeds inflation.)
The 1% funded improvement factor contemplated

In sum, a 4.2% real growth would require tuition

certainties introduced by timing. We are each year in
the position of estimating the economic conditions
which will obtain some 8 to 20 months hence.
Our tendencies are generally those of optimists.
Thus a year ago the 1974-75 tuition recommendation
of a 7.6% increase was based upon an inflation
estimate of 5%. Actual inflation appears likely to
exceed that figure by a wide margin this year. Thus
there is likely to be a real decline in tuition income
for 1974-75.
[When inflation is taken into account], tuition
rate increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 of between
10.5 and 11% would be required to produce real

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.
In sum, we can say that the 1975-76 recommenda
tion compensates—but does not overcompensate— for
the decline in real tuition income in 1974-75. The
recommended rate is no higher than it would have
been if our predictions of inflation had been more
accurate.
Leaving economic factors for the moment, a look
should be taken at the basic arithmetic of the tuition
income equation. Tuition income to the Operating
Budget is a product of three factors: autumn quarter
enrollment; returning enrollment ratios in succeeding
quarters; and the tuition rate. The estimated values
for the first two of these factors appear below:

Since the student body size is expected to remain
constant at the level budgeted for 1974-75 and the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is ex
pected to remain at 98% in winter and 91% in spring,
the increase in tuition income for 1975-76 will be a
function solely of the tuition rate increase.
A further and familiar consideration also bears
emphasis here. While tuition income is one of several
sources of income, it is a major source, comprising
49% of Operating Budget income. This makes it a
particularly important factor in reckoning the steps
which move the Operating Budget toward equili
brium. '
As important as economic and budget considera
tions are, a recommendation based upon them would
be subject to serious challenge if there were evidence
that Stanford was failing to attract and enroll the
most talented and promising students. We turn, there
fore, to discuss briefly the evidence gathered in
respect to that concern.
Private/Public Cost Differential
Because public institutions, particularly in Cali
fornia, are generally of high quality as well as re
maining less costly than private institutions, a proper
concern has been expressed that Stanford may lose
able students to these public institutions.
Information is not easily obtained regarding a
student's decision not to apply to Stanford, and,
therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether costs are
a factor in such cases. Data have, however, been
collected over the last few years which provide
information about the type of institutions chosen by
those students who were admitted to Stanford but
declined to enroll.

University of California, but the UC system drew
The data indicate that the percent choosing public
institutions has remained within a narrow range. This
is a somewhat surprising finding, particularly for
freshmen entering in the autumn of 1974-75, where
the data show a continued decrease in the percentage
of students choosing public institutions over private
ones.
Since the costs of attending Stanford during this
year showed no charp divergence from the relative
costs of attending other private or public universities,
the changes reflected are not easily explained in terms
of cost differentials.
A study was made of students in the class of 1977
and 1978 comparing the reasons cited for choosing
not to attend Stanford. While there was little change
in the responses to nonfinancial questions, the per
centage indicating that cost was a "strong influence"

in the decision not to come to Stanford fell two
points this year from 22 to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points from 12% to 15%. This difference was
mentioned more often by those choosing public
institutions (19%) than by those choosing private
schools (14%).
Since Stanford's financial aid policies are designed
to meet demonstrated need, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon could be the manner in which
financial aid is proportioned among gifts, loans, and
jobs. The Committee on Undergraduate Financial
Aids presently has aid "packaging" under review.
The private schools chosen by the ex-admittee

group changed little from last year. Harvard, Yale,
and MIT were our strongest competitors, attracting
38% of the students choosing other private institu
tions. Forty percent of those enrolling at public
schools chose one of the eight campuses of the
away fewer total students (50) than did Harvard
(134), or Yale (81)..
Tuition Rates at Other Universities
The recommended Stanford tuition increase, while
changing our relative position somewhat, will not
place us out of line with other (major private)
institutions. Of those institutions chosen by 10 or
more admitted freshmen, the average tuition will be
$3,822 . during 1975-76 providing the preliminary
estimates given reflect the rates actually set.
Since Stanford's budgeting process begins earlier
and tuition is set earlier than the corresponding
events occur at some of these institutions, it is quite
possible, especially in view of the economic condi
tions, that these estimates will be revised upward.
A comparision was made this year between the
proposed tuition rates provided by contacted institu
tions last autumn and the actual tuition rates set
later. Of the 13 institutions examined last year, eight
eventually established a tuition rate increase higher
than was estimated. Of those eight institutions, four
increased tuition by twice the earlier estimated rate.
Relationship Between Tuition Rate, Financial Aid
Policy and Enrollment Choices
Since the financial elements in our ability to
attract students whose families may hesitate on
economic grounds center in our financial aid pro
gram, the remainder of this background note focuses

there, particularly since 1975-76 will see some signifi
cant changes.
During 1975-76, a higher level of overall under
graduate financial need will result from the tuition
increase and from recent actions by the College
Scholarship Service. (CSS establishes the need assess
ment formula used by Stanford and most other
educational institutions.)
Both of these circumstances will lead to an in
creased allocation to financial aid. While budget plans
call for allocating to the Financial Aids Office suffi
cient funds to meet increased need resulting from the
increases in tuition, and room and board, the magni
tude of the CSS need assessment formula changes
necessitates a phased response. Before describing that
response, a brief review of the antecedents of the
change may be useful.
In recent years, concern has been expressed at

Stanford and elsewhere that middle income families
may be particularly hard pressed to meet the rising
cost of college. The actions which were taken by
Stanford in response appear to have produced posi
tive results for middle income families but at the
same time have increased financial pressure on the
University.
First, the Admissions Office has taken special
pains to emphasize the availability of financial aid
and the policy of meeting all demonstrated need. The
Financial Aids Office last year sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness to
reconsider family financial situations if it was
believed that aid awards were not adequate. In some
cases upward revisions of aid were made.
Second, an effort was made by the Director of
Financial Aid, in concert with his colleagues at other
institutions, to encourage the CSS to slow the accele
ration of the contribution formula in the middle
income ranges, thereby making middle income fami
lies more eligible for aid. Recently, the CSS did revise
the need assessment guidelines for 1975-76 and, as a
result, the expected parental contribution has been
lowered at various income levels, particularly in the
middle income ranges.
While the recent action by the CSS may alleviate
some of the financial pressure on middle income
families, the financial burden of meeting the in
creased need has now shifted to institutions and
government student aid programs.
At the national level, the CSS formula will raise
aggregate financial need of college students by an
estimated $BOO million. So far, the federal govern
ment has made no moves to allocate additional funds
available to meet this need; moreover, the Office of
Education is deeply concerned that funds will be
diverted from low income to middle income students
as financial aid pressures increase.
While the California State Scholarship Program has
been more responsive, the burden will still fall most
heavily on individual institutions. (While the CSS has
been sharply criticized for the precipitous nature of
the change and for the lack of consultation with
institutions, the revisions to the formula have been
generally accepted.)
At Stanford, somewhat more than one million
dollars over previously planned financial aid increases
would be required to apply the new formula to all
undergraduate students enrolled in 1975-76. Given
the University's present financial difficulties, this size
increase can be managed only through a phased
response.
Accordingly, the new curves will be applied to
freshmen entering in 1975-76. In each subsequent
year, the new freshman class will be covered. By
1978-79, the need assessment of all undergraduate
students will be calculated according to the new
formula.
Toward this end, budget plans call for an increase
in the General Funds allocation to financial aid from
$1.9 million in 1974-75 to $4.8 million in 1978-79.
During the period of transition, the University will
provide for all students greater access to subsidized
long-term loans and job opportunities. In individual
cases, where this might produce unreasonable in
debtedness or require excessive work during the
school year, additional scholarship help will be made
available.
Tuition increases affect graduate students some
what differently, since parental income and need
assessment formulae are less formally taken into
account.
In the case of teaching and research assistantships,
where a tuition grant is integral to the appointment,
the size of that grant will increase in proportion to
the tuition increase. The same is true for other tuition
grants, by definition.
Since loans also constitute the major source of
graduate financial aid, access to such funds will be
increased.
A Task Force was established in 1973-74 to review
lending procedures and to assess the availability of
loans and the equitability of loan terms. The Task
Force found loan supply and demand to be in
relatively good balance, assuming the continuation of
the status quo in respect to the federal programs and
continued support from the banking community for
the Federally Insured Student Loan program.
Such continued support appears assured. To assure
equitability, the Director of Financial Aids has
assumed responsibility for the coordination of all
loan policies within the University.

Following are excerpts from a background paper

proposed tuition increase:
Background
A comparison of the 1974-75 rates with the
1975-76 recommendations is as follows:
Type From To % of
1974-75 1975-76 Increase Increase
General Tuition $3,375 $3,810 $435 12.88

(M.D. Program) $3,570 $4,005 $435 12.88
Graduate School of
Business $3,600 $3,990 $390 10.80
While each year's tuition recommendations repre
sent in the last analysis a judgment by University
officers, that judgment this year had its roots in four
sets of considerations:
The first set combines general economic condi
tions and indicators with income and expense projec
tions for Stanford. We will refer to this set as
economic and budget considerations.
The second reviews projected tuition at other
institutions.
The third concerns the cost differential between
public and private institutions.
And the fourth—the relationship between fresh
man admissions, financial aid, and enrollment
choices—deals with our continued ability to attract
and enroll a diverse and high quality student body.
Economic and Budget Considerations
Whatever else institutions of higher learning may
be insulated from, they are clearly not insulated from
many local, national, and international economic
forces.
Whatever the focus is next year's Operating Budget
orTong term financial equilibrium—or, as is now the
case at Stanford, both together as part of a unified
plan-the major elements of income, particularly tui
tion, must be viewed in an appropriate economic
context.
In the research work which is proceeding under
Prof. William Massy's direction, a strong relationship
has been established between the growth-rate of
tuition and the growth-rate of necessary Operating
Budget expenditures, including expenditures for
funded improvements (i.e., improvements brought
securely into the budget base).
There is, moreover, a reasonably clear relationship
between economic indicators of general cost rise and
the cost of meeting particular increases in the Univer
sity's basic expenditures. As was indicated in the
presentation of the Long Range Financial Forecast,
we are assuming these values for the pertinent infla
tion indices in 1975-76:
Consumer Price Index (national) = 9.0%
Gross National Product deflator = 7.5%
Bay Area Consumer Price Index = 8.0%
There is not, of course, a one-to-one correspon
dence between these measures and Stanford's costs.
And the budget task is to cover the University's
expenses, not those of the average consumer. Never
theless, within the frame of reference provided by
Prof. Massy's work, a modest degree of funded
improvement (1% of the prior year's base) requires
approximately 4.2% in real growth of tuition.
("Real" refers to the amount of the overall increase
which exceeds inflation.)
The 1% funded improvement factor contemplated
in 1975-76 marks a reduction by two-thirds in the
level of funded improvements experienced in the past
two years.
In sum, a 4.2% real growth would require tuition
increases from 11.7% to 13.2%, depending on the
measure of inflation selected.
Giving further emphasis to the economic inter-rela
tionships relevant to the tuition rate are the un
certainties introduced by timing. We are each year in
the position of estimating the economic conditions
which will obtain some 8 to 20 months hence.
Our tendencies are generally those of optimists.

of a 7.6% increase was based upon an inflation

there is likely to be a real decline in tuition income

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.

10.5 and 11% would be required to produce real

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.
In sum, we can say that the 1975-76 recommenda
tion compensates—but does not overcompensate— for
the decline in real tuition income in 1974-75. The
recommended rate is no higher than it would have
been if our predictions of inflation had been more
accurate.
Leaving economic factors for the moment, a look
should be taken at the basic arithmetic of the tuition
income equation. Tuition income to the Operating
Budget is a product of three factors: autumn quarter
enrollment; returning enrollment ratios in succeeding
quarters; and the tuition rate. The estimated values
for the first two of these factors appear below:

Since the student body size is expected to remain
constant at the level budgeted for 1974-75 and the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is ex
pected to remain at 98% in winter and 91% in spring,
the increase in tuition income for 1975-76 will be a
function solely of the tuition rate increase.
A further and familiar consideration also bears
emphasis here. While tuition income is one of several
sources of income, it is a major source, comprising
49% of Operating Budget income. This makes it a
particularly important factor in reckoning the steps
which move the Operating Budget toward equili
brium. '
As important as economic and budget considera
tions are, a recommendation based upon them would
be subject to serious challenge if there were evidence
that Stanford was failing to attract and enroll the
most talented and promising students. We turn, there
fore, to discuss briefly the evidence gathered in
respect to that concern.
Private/Public Cost Differential
Because public institutions, particularly in Cali
fornia, are generally of high quality as well as re
maining less costly than private institutions, a proper
concern has been expressed that Stanford may lose
able students to these public institutions.
Information is not easily obtained regarding a
student's decision not to apply to Stanford, and,
therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether costs are
a factor in such cases. Data have, however, been
collected over the last few years which provide
information about the type of institutions chosen by
those students who were admitted to Stanford but
declined to enroll.

University of California, but the UC system drew
The data indicate that the percent choosing public
institutions has remained within a narrow range. This
is a somewhat surprising finding, particularly for
freshmen entering in the autumn of 1974-75, where
the data show a continued decrease in the percentage
of students choosing public institutions over private
ones.
Since the costs of attending Stanford during this
year showed no charp divergence from the relative
costs of attending other private or public universities,
the changes reflected are not easily explained in terms
of cost differentials.
A study was made of students in the class of 1977
and 1978 comparing the reasons cited for choosing
not to attend Stanford. While there was little change
in the responses to nonfinancial questions, the per
centage indicating that cost was a "strong influence"

in the decision not to come to Stanford fell two
points this year from 22 to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points from 12% to 15%. This difference was
mentioned more often by those choosing public
institutions (19%) than by those choosing private
schools (14%).
Since Stanford's financial aid policies are designed
to meet demonstrated need, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon could be the manner in which
financial aid is proportioned among gifts, loans, and
jobs. The Committee on Undergraduate Financial
Aids presently has aid "packaging" under review.
The private schools chosen by the ex-admittee

group changed little from last year. Harvard, Yale,
and MIT were our strongest competitors, attracting
38% of the students choosing other private institu
tions. Forty percent of those enrolling at public
schools chose one of the eight campuses of the
away fewer total students (50) than did Harvard
(134), or Yale (81)..
Tuition Rates at Other Universities
The recommended Stanford tuition increase, while
changing our relative position somewhat, will not
place us out of line with other (major private)
institutions. Of those institutions chosen by 10 or
more admitted freshmen, the average tuition will be
$3,822 . during 1975-76 providing the preliminary
estimates given reflect the rates actually set.
Since Stanford's budgeting process begins earlier
and tuition is set earlier than the corresponding
events occur at some of these institutions, it is quite
possible, especially in view of the economic condi
tions, that these estimates will be revised upward.
A comparision was made this year between the
proposed tuition rates provided by contacted institu
tions last autumn and the actual tuition rates set
later. Of the 13 institutions examined last year, eight
eventually established a tuition rate increase higher
than was estimated. Of those eight institutions, four
increased tuition by twice the earlier estimated rate.
Relationship Between Tuition Rate, Financial Aid
Policy and Enrollment Choices
Since the financial elements in our ability to
attract students whose families may hesitate on
economic grounds center in our financial aid pro
gram, the remainder of this background note focuses

there, particularly since 1975-76 will see some signifi
cant changes.
During 1975-76, a higher level of overall under
graduate financial need will result from the tuition
increase and from recent actions by the College
Scholarship Service. (CSS establishes the need assess
ment formula used by Stanford and most other
educational institutions.)
Both of these circumstances will lead to an in
creased allocation to financial aid. While budget plans
call for allocating to the Financial Aids Office suffi
cient funds to meet increased need resulting from the
increases in tuition, and room and board, the magni
tude of the CSS need assessment formula changes
necessitates a phased response. Before describing that
response, a brief review of the antecedents of the
change may be useful.
In recent years, concern has been expressed at

Stanford and elsewhere that middle income families
may be particularly hard pressed to meet the rising
cost of college. The actions which were taken by
Stanford in response appear to have produced posi
tive results for middle income families but at the
same time have increased financial pressure on the
University.
First, the Admissions Office has taken special
pains to emphasize the availability of financial aid
and the policy of meeting all demonstrated need. The
Financial Aids Office last year sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness to
reconsider family financial situations if it was
believed that aid awards were not adequate. In some
cases upward revisions of aid were made.
Second, an effort was made by the Director of
Financial Aid, in concert with his colleagues at other
institutions, to encourage the CSS to slow the accele
ration of the contribution formula in the middle
income ranges, thereby making middle income fami
lies more eligible for aid. Recently, the CSS did revise
the need assessment guidelines for 1975-76 and, as a
result, the expected parental contribution has been
lowered at various income levels, particularly in the
middle income ranges.
While the recent action by the CSS may alleviate
some of the financial pressure on middle income
families, the financial burden of meeting the in
creased need has now shifted to institutions and
government student aid programs.
At the national level, the CSS formula will raise
aggregate financial need of college students by an
estimated $BOO million. So far, the federal govern
ment has made no moves to allocate additional funds
available to meet this need; moreover, the Office of
Education is deeply concerned that funds will be
diverted from low income to middle income students
as financial aid pressures increase.
While the California State Scholarship Program has
been more responsive, the burden will still fall most
heavily on individual institutions. (While the CSS has
been sharply criticized for the precipitous nature of
the change and for the lack of consultation with
institutions, the revisions to the formula have been
generally accepted.)
At Stanford, somewhat more than one million
dollars over previously planned financial aid increases
would be required to apply the new formula to all
undergraduate students enrolled in 1975-76. Given
the University's present financial difficulties, this size
increase can be managed only through a phased
response.
Accordingly, the new curves will be applied to
freshmen entering in 1975-76. In each subsequent
year, the new freshman class will be covered. By
1978-79, the need assessment of all undergraduate
students will be calculated according to the new
formula.
Toward this end, budget plans call for an increase
in the General Funds allocation to financial aid from
$1.9 million in 1974-75 to $4.8 million in 1978-79.
During the period of transition, the University will
provide for all students greater access to subsidized
long-term loans and job opportunities. In individual
cases, where this might produce unreasonable in
debtedness or require excessive work during the
school year, additional scholarship help will be made
available.
Tuition increases affect graduate students some
what differently, since parental income and need
assessment formulae are less formally taken into
account.
In the case of teaching and research assistantships,
where a tuition grant is integral to the appointment,
the size of that grant will increase in proportion to
the tuition increase. The same is true for other tuition
grants, by definition.
Since loans also constitute the major source of
graduate financial aid, access to such funds will be
increased.
A Task Force was established in 1973-74 to review
lending procedures and to assess the availability of
loans and the equitability of loan terms. The Task
Force found loan supply and demand to be in
relatively good balance, assuming the continuation of
the status quo in respect to the federal programs and
continued support from the banking community for
the Federally Insured Student Loan program.
Such continued support appears assured. To assure
equitability, the Director of Financial Aids has
assumed responsibility for the coordination of all
loan policies within the University.

Following are excerpts from a background paper

proposed tuition increase:
Background
A comparison of the 1974-75 rates with the
1975-76 recommendations is as follows:
Type From To % of
1974-75 1975-76 Increase Increase
General Tuition $3,375 $3,810 $435 12.88

(M.D. Program) $3,570 $4,005 $435 12.88
Graduate School of
Business $3,600 $3,990 $390 10.80
While each year's tuition recommendations repre
sent in the last analysis a judgment by University
officers, that judgment this year had its roots in four
sets of considerations:
The first set combines general economic condi
tions and indicators with income and expense projec
tions for Stanford. We will refer to this set as
economic and budget considerations.
The second reviews projected tuition at other
institutions.
The third concerns the cost differential between
public and private institutions.
And the fourth—the relationship between fresh
man admissions, financial aid, and enrollment
choices—deals with our continued ability to attract
and enroll a diverse and high quality student body.
Economic and Budget Considerations
Whatever else institutions of higher learning may
be insulated from, they are clearly not insulated from
many local, national, and international economic
forces.
Whatever the focus is next year's Operating Budget
orTong term financial equilibrium—or, as is now the
case at Stanford, both together as part of a unified
plan-the major elements of income, particularly tui
tion, must be viewed in an appropriate economic
context.
In the research work which is proceeding under
Prof. William Massy's direction, a strong relationship
has been established between the growth-rate of
tuition and the growth-rate of necessary Operating
Budget expenditures, including expenditures for
funded improvements (i.e., improvements brought
securely into the budget base).
There is, moreover, a reasonably clear relationship
between economic indicators of general cost rise and
the cost of meeting particular increases in the Univer
sity's basic expenditures. As was indicated in the
presentation of the Long Range Financial Forecast,
we are assuming these values for the pertinent infla
tion indices in 1975-76:
Consumer Price Index (national) = 9.0%
Gross National Product deflator = 7.5%
Bay Area Consumer Price Index = 8.0%
There is not, of course, a one-to-one correspon
dence between these measures and Stanford's costs.
And the budget task is to cover the University's
expenses, not those of the average consumer. Never
theless, within the frame of reference provided by
Prof. Massy's work, a modest degree of funded
improvement (1% of the prior year's base) requires
approximately 4.2% in real growth of tuition.
("Real" refers to the amount of the overall increase
which exceeds inflation.)
The 1% funded improvement factor contemplated
in 1975-76 marks a reduction by two-thirds in the
level of funded improvements experienced in the past
two years.
In sum, a 4.2% real growth would require tuition
increases from 11.7% to 13.2%, depending on the
measure of inflation selected.
Giving further emphasis to the economic inter-rela
tionships relevant to the tuition rate are the un
certainties introduced by timing. We are each year in
the position of estimating the economic conditions
which will obtain some 8 to 20 months hence.
Our tendencies are generally those of optimists.
Thus a year ago the 1974-75 tuition recommendation
of a 7.6% increase was based upon an inflation
estimate of 5%. Actual inflation appears likely to
exceed that figure by a wide margin this year. Thus
there is likely to be a real decline in tuition income
for 1974-75.
[When inflation is taken into account], tuition
rate increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 of between
10.5 and 11% would be required to produce real

increase of 2.5 to 3.5%. Tuition rising at those rates
would produce a 1975-76 rate at or slightly above the
$3,810 figure recommended here.
In sum, we can say that the 1975-76 recommenda
tion compensates—but does not overcompensate— for
the decline in real tuition income in 1974-75. The

should be taken at the basic arithmetic of the tuition
income equation. Tuition income to the Operating
Budget is a product of three factors: autumn quarter
enrollment; returning enrollment ratios in succeeding
quarters; and the tuition rate. The estimated values
for the first two of these factors appear below:

Since the student body size is expected to remain
constant at the level budgeted for 1974-75 and the
returning enrollment ratio for undergraduates is ex
pected to remain at 98% in winter and 91% in spring,
the increase in tuition income for 1975-76 will be a
function solely of the tuition rate increase.
A further and familiar consideration also bears
emphasis here. While tuition income is one of several
sources of income, it is a major source, comprising
49% of Operating Budget income. This makes it a
particularly important factor in reckoning the steps
which move the Operating Budget toward equili
brium. '
As important as economic and budget considera
tions are, a recommendation based upon them would
be subject to serious challenge if there were evidence
that Stanford was failing to attract and enroll the
most talented and promising students. We turn, there
fore, to discuss briefly the evidence gathered in
respect to that concern.
Private/Public Cost Differential
Because public institutions, particularly in Cali
fornia, are generally of high quality as well as re
maining less costly than private institutions, a proper
concern has been expressed that Stanford may lose
able students to these public institutions.
Information is not easily obtained regarding a
student's decision not to apply to Stanford, and,
therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether costs are
a factor in such cases. Data have, however, been
collected over the last few years which provide
information about the type of institutions chosen by
those students who were admitted to Stanford but
declined to enroll.

University of California, but the UC system drew
The data indicate that the percent choosing public
institutions has remained within a narrow range. This
is a somewhat surprising finding, particularly for
freshmen entering in the autumn of 1974-75, where
the data show a continued decrease in the percentage
of students choosing public institutions over private
ones.
Since the costs of attending Stanford during this
year showed no charp divergence from the relative
costs of attending other private or public universities,
the changes reflected are not easily explained in terms
of cost differentials.
A study was made of students in the class of 1977
and 1978 comparing the reasons cited for choosing
not to attend Stanford. While there was little change
in the responses to nonfinancial questions, the per
centage indicating that cost was a "strong influence"

in the decision not to come to Stanford fell two
points this year from 22 to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points from 12% to 15%. This difference was
mentioned more often by those choosing public
institutions (19%) than by those choosing private
schools (14%).
Since Stanford's financial aid policies are designed
to meet demonstrated need, one possible explanation
for this phenomenon could be the manner in which
financial aid is proportioned among gifts, loans, and
jobs. The Committee on Undergraduate Financial
Aids presently has aid "packaging" under review.
The private schools chosen by the ex-admittee

group changed little from last year. Harvard, Yale,
and MIT were our strongest competitors, attracting
38% of the students choosing other private institu
tions. Forty percent of those enrolling at public
schools chose one of the eight campuses of the
away fewer total students (50) than did Harvard
(134), or Yale (81)..
Tuition Rates at Other Universities
The recommended Stanford tuition increase, while
changing our relative position somewhat, will not
place us out of line with other (major private)
institutions. Of those institutions chosen by 10 or
more admitted freshmen, the average tuition will be
$3,822 . during 1975-76 providing the preliminary
estimates given reflect the rates actually set.
Since Stanford's budgeting process begins earlier
and tuition is set earlier than the corresponding
events occur at some of these institutions, it is quite
possible, especially in view of the economic condi
tions, that these estimates will be revised upward.
A comparision was made this year between the
proposed tuition rates provided by contacted institu
tions last autumn and the actual tuition rates set
later. Of the 13 institutions examined last year, eight
eventually established a tuition rate increase higher
than was estimated. Of those eight institutions, four
increased tuition by twice the earlier estimated rate.
Relationship Between Tuition Rate, Financial Aid
Policy and Enrollment Choices
Since the financial elements in our ability to
attract students whose families may hesitate on
economic grounds center in our financial aid pro
gram, the remainder of this background note focuses

there, particularly since 1975-76 will see some signifi
cant changes.
During 1975-76, a higher level of overall under
graduate financial need will result from the tuition
increase and from recent actions by the College
Scholarship Service. (CSS establishes the need assess
ment formula used by Stanford and most other
educational institutions.)
Both of these circumstances will lead to an in
creased allocation to financial aid. While budget plans
call for allocating to the Financial Aids Office suffi
cient funds to meet increased need resulting from the
increases in tuition, and room and board, the magni
tude of the CSS need assessment formula changes
necessitates a phased response. Before describing that
response, a brief review of the antecedents of the
change may be useful.
In recent years, concern has been expressed at

Stanford and elsewhere that middle income families
may be particularly hard pressed to meet the rising
cost of college. The actions which were taken by
Stanford in response appear to have produced posi
tive results for middle income families but at the
same time have increased financial pressure on the
University.
First, the Admissions Office has taken special
pains to emphasize the availability of financial aid
and the policy of meeting all demonstrated need. The
Financial Aids Office last year sent to all admitted
students who applied for financial aid, whether they
received aid or not, a letter expressing a readiness to
reconsider family financial situations if it was
believed that aid awards were not adequate. In some
cases upward revisions of aid were made.
Second, an effort was made by the Director of
Financial Aid, in concert with his colleagues at other
institutions, to encourage the CSS to slow the accele
ration of the contribution formula in the middle
income ranges, thereby making middle income fami
lies more eligible for aid. Recently, the CSS did revise
the need assessment guidelines for 1975-76 and, as a
result, the expected parental contribution has been
lowered at various income levels, particularly in the
middle income ranges.
While the recent action by the CSS may alleviate
some of the financial pressure on middle income
families, the financial burden of meeting the in
creased need has now shifted to institutions and
government student aid programs.
At the national level, the CSS formula will raise
aggregate financial need of college students by an
estimated $BOO million. So far, the federal govern
ment has made no moves to allocate additional funds
available to meet this need; moreover, the Office of
Education is deeply concerned that funds will be
diverted from low income to middle income students
as financial aid pressures increase.
While the California State Scholarship Program has
been more responsive, the burden will still fall most
heavily on individual institutions. (While the CSS has
been sharply criticized for the precipitous nature of
the change and for the lack of consultation with
institutions, the revisions to the formula have been
generally accepted.)
At Stanford, somewhat more than one million
dollars over previously planned financial aid increases
would be required to apply the new formula to all
undergraduate students enrolled in 1975-76. Given
the University's present financial difficulties, this size
increase can be managed only through a phased
response.
Accordingly, the new curves will be applied to
freshmen entering in 1975-76. In each subsequent
year, the new freshman class will be covered. By
1978-79, the need assessment of all undergraduate
students will be calculated according to the new
formula.
Toward this end, budget plans call for an increase
in the General Funds allocation to financial aid from
$1.9 million in 1974-75 to $4.8 million in 1978-79.
During the period of transition, the University will
provide for all students greater access to subsidized
long-term loans and job opportunities. In individual
cases, where this might produce unreasonable in
debtedness or require excessive work during the
school year, additional scholarship help will be made
available.
Tuition increases affect graduate students some
what differently, since parental income and need
assessment formulae are less formally taken into
account.
In the case of teaching and research assistantships,
where a tuition grant is integral to the appointment,
the size of that grant will increase in proportion to
the tuition increase. The same is true for other tuition
grants, by definition.
Since loans also constitute the major source of
graduate financial aid, access to such funds will be
increased.
A Task Force was established in 1973-74 to review
lending procedures and to assess the availability of
loans and the equitability of loan terms. The Task
Force found loan supply and demand to be in
relatively good balance, assuming the continuation of
the status quo in respect to the federal programs and
continued support from the banking community for
the Federally Insured Student Loan program.
Such continued support appears assured. To assure
equitability, the Director of Financial Aids has
assumed responsibility for the coordination of all
loan policies within the University.
