# ASSU committee urges reconsideration of proposed tuition increase
## 
### 
Following is the Report of the ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition, dated Nov. 25, 1974:
Preface
Established to examine tuition at Stanford, our
committee often found itself discussing the value of a
Stanford education. It was impossible to investigate
tuition rates and increases without also scrutinizing
the worth of the education being purchased.
In order to come to grips with this question, we
limited our examination as closely as possible to
tuition. Instead of researching budget cutting alter
natives, emphasis was placed on three specific facets
in the process.
The first major concern was the process employed
at Stanford. Since almost no publicity or common
knowledge exists with regard to how the tuition rate
is set, we concluded that this process ought to be
determined and explained to the students affected by
the decision. We were interested not only in how a
decision is reached but also in who is involved in this
process.
The actual rate and its effects on students, parents,
academics, and the general functioning of the Univer
sity was the second area examined by this committee.
Topics of interest were financial aid, general econom
ic indices and their relationship to tuition, and atten
dence patterns as affected by an increase. Of prime
interest and concern was the future effects, in three
to five years, of continued increases.
After consideration of these subjects, the more
theoretical arguments, alternatives to the present
system of collecting tuition, were discussed. Concern
was on an economically efficient and equitable alloca
tion of resources.
Major emphasis was placed on the question of
what one was actually paying for with tuition. If one
student was actually subsidizing another student's
education, excluding financial aid; solutions were
sought to remedy this situation. Several proposals
were discussed but we realize that these are not
complete and request that a study be made into this
important question.
Despite what we consider careful analysis, we
realize that it is not a complete report. Any further
suggestions and input would be greatly appreciated.

PARTI
The first topic confronting the committee was the
process by which tuition is set. In trying to find out
who actually sets the tuition rate we discovered that
this decision is not made by one person. Rather "the
administration" decides on the basis of recommenda
tions of many staff members.
The primary decision-making goes on in the office
of the Vice-President and Provost under the direction
of the Vice-Provost for Budget and Planning. At
present, Ray Bacchetti fills this position. Anyone
interested beyond the bounds of this report should
talk to him or anyone in the Academic Planning
Office on the subject.
Also involved in the decision are reports and
recommendations from the Offices of Financial Aids
and Undergraduate Admissions. The criterion used to
evaluate these and other inputs will be discussed in
detail later in this section.
The interesting fact discovered by this committee
was that in regard to input about proposed tuition
rate increases there is a definite exclusion of student
viewpoints. Being the most directly affected by these
increases the committee feels that students should be
allowed to influence the process more concretely.
This committee served as the only student input
into the process, this basically post facto for this
year. This was very ineffective since the prime con
cern of this committee was to discover the process
itself.
Since our committee will not be functioning in the
future, unless reestablished with a new charge, we
recommend that a student or students be included on
the staff of the Academic Planning Office as part time
assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

Besides people involved in the process, the com
mittee discovered that just as important were the
considerations reviewed when arriving at a tuition
rate. The facts specific to this year will be dealt with
in part two of this report.
Background information submitted to Board of
Trustees on Nov. 13, 1973. states that:
"While the [tuition] recommendation in the last
analysis represents a judgment by University officers,
that judgment has its roots in five sets of considera
tions.
"The first—general economic considerations
provides information on relevant factors whose causes
are independent of University actions but whose
effects are influential in the life of the University.
"The second—Operating Budget considerations
deals with institutional income and expense projec
tions and relationships.
"These first two together suggest a narrow range
of tuition alternatives which are then checked critical
ly against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of impor
tant considerations:
"The third—projected tuition increases at other
institutions—is a frame of reference factor showing
simply whether tuition will be in line with those
private institutions with which we share most of our
common candidates.
"The fourth—public/private cost differential
provides one check on cost as a factor in the enroll
ment choices of those admitted.
"The fifth—the relationship between tuition,
financial aid policy, and student enrollment choices
—provides another check on cost by examining the
effect of these policies upon Stanford's ability to
attract and enroll a diverse and high-quality student
bcjdy."
Although feeling that the general basis for these
considerations are sound, our committee recommends
that further study be made into an area of the fifth
consideration.
Although the reports on freshmen admissions are
complete for those applying to Stanford, we feel that
an important factor to consider is those qualified
students who chose not to apply here. We recognize
the difficulty involved, but note the following sugges
tion: possibly a study could be organized in conjunc

tion with the University of California of those fresh
men enrolhng there.
Questions to probe would be why they chose a
public school; did they apply to a private school; if
so, did they apply to Stanford; if not, why not, or
why not to Stanford. We feel this would provide
important insight into student enrollment choices as
affected by tuition.
The final area researched was the communication
of the decision by the University to the student body.
The only time students actually hear of the increase is
when it has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Tentative conclusions ought to be announced and
input solicited before presentation to the Board.
In order to prevent total exclusion of the students,
this committee recommends increased publicity re
garding tentative decisions and justifications involved.
The reactions received should provide constructive
suggestions, thus improving the present decision
making process.
PART II
In regard to the actual rate itself the five conside
rations proposed by the University provide the best
vehicle for our examination. The tuition next year
will increase by 12.9%, or $435, to $3BlO a year, or
$1270 a quarter.
1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%

Space paid by News & Publications Service
above wage increases. How can the University predict
such a drastic change?
But the question really at stake is what proportion
of disposable family income is comprised of educa
tional costs. The committee would maintain that, in
the case of either figure, education at Stanford is
becoming more expensive in regard to disposable
income. This places an additional burden on the
students and their parents.
This, our committee feels, will affect student
decisions on attending Stanford. The tuition increase
should not exceed the disposable income increase.
But we realize the added costs due to inflation.
Therefore our committee recommends that the
tuition increase percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable income or consumer
price index, since a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for their education.
We totally agree that 12.9% is too large an increase
and urge reconsideration of the economic indices and
tuition increase.
The second set of considerations is internal budget
considerations. With respect to the budget, the Uni
versity includes a 1% funded improvement factor. In
this period of extreme economic problems, we feel
inclusion of this factor increases the burden of educa
tional costs too much. This is a result of the decrease
in personal income in respect to CPI. Since the CPI is
greater than disposable income increase and the
tuition increase is larger than the CPI, the percentage
of disposable income represented by educational
costs will increase.
Although this funded improvement factor is neces
sary to help achieve growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of resources from pre
sent nonessential uses.
These cutbacks already are devaluing the worth of
a Stanford education. It is unfortunate that the
economic situation dictates these cutbacks, but being
necessary we feel that it is better to sacrifice one
program and save the quality of the rest. Equal
reductions everywhere will just lead us down the path
to mediocrity.
The third and fourth considerations are basically
undecided. The increases at other institutions are not
yet decided or announced publicly. As suggested
before, a study should be undertaken regarding the

public/private cost differential, but from the view
point of students at University of California branches.
With regard to the fifth consideration, financial aid
policy is of prime concern. We totally support Stan
ford's previous policy of providing financial aid to all
students with demonstrated need. <
Because the College Scholarship Service had over
represented parental contributions, it (CSS) has
adopted a new set of curves. For financial aid consi
derations, Stanford is planning only to apply these
curves to entering students.
We find this a totally inequitable allocation of
resources. Returning students have the same need and
should be treated equally. If economic conditions
prevent applying these curves to everyone in respect
to tuition grants, then at a minimum everyone should
be eligible for loans or jobs by the standards of these
new curves.
The new California State Tuition Grants to
middle-income students should help relieve some of
the burden on these students, but we realize the
scarcity of these awards and the fact that they apply
only to entering students.
In regard to general policy, we feel that tuition
increases cannot be justified simply by stating that
financial aid will also increase. Some students will
suffer the increased burden.
Already about 45% of students at Stanford receive
aid; further increases will not achieve the full effect
since most of increase will go to help increase finan
cial aid.
Because of this plateau it appears we are reaching,
it is time the University officers began asking some
serious questions about the worth of a Stanford
Education.
PART 111
The most interesting and theoretical discussions
centered around this final area. We concluded that
there were resources being used inefficiently because
of attendance patterns.
With the realization that for every one hundred
students that start classes in the fall only 98 return in
winter and 92 in spring. Thus, when the University
expands to fulfill the entire need in the autumn, it
has an excess of resources in the spring. .
One alternative would be to give a discount to any
student attending three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example tuition is $l2OO a quarter

unless a person has gone fall and winter, then spring
tuition would only cost $9OO.
Several problems developed here. Examine the
case of a student who attends four quarters from fall
through summer, takes off fall and returns for winter
and spring. Although helping the problems by leaving
the quarter that is most crowded, the student receives
no discount. Also important is that this would basi
cally force a person to take a full year off instead of
the option of leaving for just a quarter. This is a social
cost we don't think we would be willing to absorb.
A second plan would be to set tuition costs
proportional to attendance patterns. Since more
people come fall quarter it would cost most then and
least in spring. This would provide a cost incentive for
attending in cheaper quarters. Also, since many re
sources are developed solely for fall quarter, the cost
of these resources would be borne by those attending
that quarter instead of being equally divided over the
three quarters.
Presently the person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming the full year pays
for him. The problem with this solution is one of
economics. We are not sure what the demand curve is
in relation to attendance. If it were very inelastic,
which very well might be, then a change in price per
quarter will not affect individual preference decisions.
A method of solving this problem would also be to
make summer quarter more attractive. If more stu
dents would attend then, fewer University facilities
would be inefficiently allocated. The problem here
appears to be with faculty participation. They use
summer for research, and may not want to teach also.
Although we developed no specific programs for
increasing attendance in summer, we suggest that this
path be explored.
In thinking about the subject of inefficient re
sources, we concluded that the extra classes started
by students but dropped caused more resources to be
used than necessary. For example, 80 people sign up
for a class so two sections are created, but by the
time finals come there are only 35 students left. This
means the cost of the extra section was a useless one.
Discussed were the possibilities of withdrawing the
option to drop, but the consensus was that this was a
valuable option to have, : not worth sacrificing.
Another solution was to develop a flat fee for tuition
plus a per-unit cost. For example the flat fee for the
first 12 units would be $lOOO. Each additional unit
would be $5O, with refunds available only until the
drop/add deadline. Our committee felt this was one
of the most interesting proposals in that it would
allocate costs among those who benefit.
Within our time limit, our committee could not
examine these proposals completely. We recommend
that the University undertake a study into these and
other alternate proposals.
The problems pointed out in this report alone
dictate that a more equitable allocation of resources
among users and purchasers is required. This report
should include an analysis of the present system as
well.

way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

Besides people involved in the process, the com
mittee discovered that just as important were the
considerations reviewed when arriving at a tuition
rate. The facts specific to this year will be dealt with
in part two of this report.
Background information submitted to Board of
Trustees on Nov. 13, 1973. states that:
"While the [tuition] recommendation in the last
analysis represents a judgment by University officers,
that judgment has its roots in five sets of considera
tions.
"The first—general economic considerations
provides information on relevant factors whose causes
are independent of University actions but whose
effects are influential in the life of the University.
"The second—Operating Budget considerations
deals with institutional income and expense projec
tions and relationships.
"These first two together suggest a narrow range
of tuition alternatives which are then checked critical
ly against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of impor
tant considerations:
"The third—projected tuition increases at other
institutions—is a frame of reference factor showing
simply whether tuition will be in line with those
private institutions with which we share most of our
common candidates.
"The fourth—public/private cost differential
provides one check on cost as a factor in the enroll
ment choices of those admitted.
"The fifth—the relationship between tuition,
financial aid policy, and student enrollment choices
—provides another check on cost by examining the
effect of these policies upon Stanford's ability to
attract and enroll a diverse and high-quality student
bcjdy."
Although feeling that the general basis for these
considerations are sound, our committee recommends
that further study be made into an area of the fifth
consideration.
Although the reports on freshmen admissions are
complete for those applying to Stanford, we feel that
an important factor to consider is those qualified
students who chose not to apply here. We recognize
the difficulty involved, but note the following sugges
tion: possibly a study could be organized in conjunc

tion with the University of California of those fresh
men enrolhng there.
Questions to probe would be why they chose a
public school; did they apply to a private school; if
so, did they apply to Stanford; if not, why not, or
why not to Stanford. We feel this would provide
important insight into student enrollment choices as
affected by tuition.
The final area researched was the communication
of the decision by the University to the student body.
The only time students actually hear of the increase is
when it has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Tentative conclusions ought to be announced and
input solicited before presentation to the Board.
In order to prevent total exclusion of the students,
this committee recommends increased publicity re
garding tentative decisions and justifications involved.
The reactions received should provide constructive
suggestions, thus improving the present decision
making process.
PART II
In regard to the actual rate itself the five conside
rations proposed by the University provide the best
vehicle for our examination. The tuition next year
will increase by 12.9%, or $435, to $3BlO a year, or
$1270 a quarter.
1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%

Space paid by News & Publications Service
above wage increases. How can the University predict
such a drastic change?
But the question really at stake is what proportion
of disposable family income is comprised of educa
tional costs. The committee would maintain that, in
the case of either figure, education at Stanford is
becoming more expensive in regard to disposable
income. This places an additional burden on the
students and their parents.
This, our committee feels, will affect student
decisions on attending Stanford. The tuition increase
should not exceed the disposable income increase.
But we realize the added costs due to inflation.
Therefore our committee recommends that the
tuition increase percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable income or consumer
price index, since a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for their education.
We totally agree that 12.9% is too large an increase
and urge reconsideration of the economic indices and
tuition increase.
The second set of considerations is internal budget
considerations. With respect to the budget, the Uni
versity includes a 1% funded improvement factor. In
this period of extreme economic problems, we feel
inclusion of this factor increases the burden of educa
tional costs too much. This is a result of the decrease
in personal income in respect to CPI. Since the CPI is
greater than disposable income increase and the
tuition increase is larger than the CPI, the percentage
of disposable income represented by educational
costs will increase.
Although this funded improvement factor is neces
sary to help achieve growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of resources from pre
sent nonessential uses.
These cutbacks already are devaluing the worth of
a Stanford education. It is unfortunate that the
economic situation dictates these cutbacks, but being
necessary we feel that it is better to sacrifice one
program and save the quality of the rest. Equal
reductions everywhere will just lead us down the path
to mediocrity.
The third and fourth considerations are basically
undecided. The increases at other institutions are not
yet decided or announced publicly. As suggested
before, a study should be undertaken regarding the

public/private cost differential, but from the view
point of students at University of California branches.
With regard to the fifth consideration, financial aid
policy is of prime concern. We totally support Stan
ford's previous policy of providing financial aid to all
students with demonstrated need. <
Because the College Scholarship Service had over
represented parental contributions, it (CSS) has
adopted a new set of curves. For financial aid consi
derations, Stanford is planning only to apply these
curves to entering students.
We find this a totally inequitable allocation of
resources. Returning students have the same need and
should be treated equally. If economic conditions
prevent applying these curves to everyone in respect
to tuition grants, then at a minimum everyone should
be eligible for loans or jobs by the standards of these
new curves.
The new California State Tuition Grants to
middle-income students should help relieve some of
the burden on these students, but we realize the
scarcity of these awards and the fact that they apply
only to entering students.
In regard to general policy, we feel that tuition
increases cannot be justified simply by stating that
financial aid will also increase. Some students will
suffer the increased burden.
Already about 45% of students at Stanford receive
aid; further increases will not achieve the full effect
since most of increase will go to help increase finan
cial aid.
Because of this plateau it appears we are reaching,
it is time the University officers began asking some
serious questions about the worth of a Stanford
Education.
PART 111
The most interesting and theoretical discussions
centered around this final area. We concluded that
there were resources being used inefficiently because
of attendance patterns.
With the realization that for every one hundred
students that start classes in the fall only 98 return in
winter and 92 in spring. Thus, when the University
expands to fulfill the entire need in the autumn, it
has an excess of resources in the spring. .
One alternative would be to give a discount to any
student attending three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example tuition is $l2OO a quarter

unless a person has gone fall and winter, then spring
tuition would only cost $9OO.
Several problems developed here. Examine the
case of a student who attends four quarters from fall
through summer, takes off fall and returns for winter
and spring. Although helping the problems by leaving
the quarter that is most crowded, the student receives
no discount. Also important is that this would basi
cally force a person to take a full year off instead of
the option of leaving for just a quarter. This is a social
cost we don't think we would be willing to absorb.
A second plan would be to set tuition costs
proportional to attendance patterns. Since more
people come fall quarter it would cost most then and
least in spring. This would provide a cost incentive for
attending in cheaper quarters. Also, since many re
sources are developed solely for fall quarter, the cost
of these resources would be borne by those attending
that quarter instead of being equally divided over the
three quarters.
Presently the person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming the full year pays
for him. The problem with this solution is one of
economics. We are not sure what the demand curve is
in relation to attendance. If it were very inelastic,
which very well might be, then a change in price per
quarter will not affect individual preference decisions.
A method of solving this problem would also be to
make summer quarter more attractive. If more stu
dents would attend then, fewer University facilities
would be inefficiently allocated. The problem here
appears to be with faculty participation. They use
summer for research, and may not want to teach also.
Although we developed no specific programs for
increasing attendance in summer, we suggest that this
path be explored.
In thinking about the subject of inefficient re
sources, we concluded that the extra classes started
by students but dropped caused more resources to be
used than necessary. For example, 80 people sign up
for a class so two sections are created, but by the
time finals come there are only 35 students left. This
means the cost of the extra section was a useless one.
Discussed were the possibilities of withdrawing the
option to drop, but the consensus was that this was a
valuable option to have, : not worth sacrificing.
Another solution was to develop a flat fee for tuition
plus a per-unit cost. For example the flat fee for the
first 12 units would be $lOOO. Each additional unit
would be $5O, with refunds available only until the
drop/add deadline. Our committee felt this was one
of the most interesting proposals in that it would
allocate costs among those who benefit.
Within our time limit, our committee could not
examine these proposals completely. We recommend
that the University undertake a study into these and
other alternate proposals.
The problems pointed out in this report alone
dictate that a more equitable allocation of resources
among users and purchasers is required. This report
should include an analysis of the present system as
well.

Following is the Report of the ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition, dated Nov. 25, 1974:
Preface
Established to examine tuition at Stanford, our
committee often found itself discussing the value of a
Stanford education. It was impossible to investigate
tuition rates and increases without also scrutinizing
the worth of the education being purchased.
In order to come to grips with this question, we
limited our examination as closely as possible to
tuition. Instead of researching budget cutting alter
natives, emphasis was placed on three specific facets
in the process.
The first major concern was the process employed
at Stanford. Since almost no publicity or common
knowledge exists with regard to how the tuition rate
is set, we concluded that this process ought to be
determined and explained to the students affected by
the decision. We were interested not only in how a
decision is reached but also in who is involved in this
process.
The actual rate and its effects on students, parents,
academics, and the general functioning of the Univer
sity was the second area examined by this committee.
Topics of interest were financial aid, general econom
ic indices and their relationship to tuition, and atten
dence patterns as affected by an increase. Of prime
interest and concern was the future effects, in three
to five years, of continued increases.
After consideration of these subjects, the more
theoretical arguments, alternatives to the present
system of collecting tuition, were discussed. Concern
was on an economically efficient and equitable alloca
tion of resources.
Major emphasis was placed on the question of
what one was actually paying for with tuition. If one
student was actually subsidizing another student's
education, excluding financial aid; solutions were
sought to remedy this situation. Several proposals
were discussed but we realize that these are not
complete and request that a study be made into this
important question.
Despite what we consider careful analysis, we
realize that it is not a complete report. Any further
suggestions and input would be greatly appreciated.

PARTI
The first topic confronting the committee was the
process by which tuition is set. In trying to find out
who actually sets the tuition rate we discovered that
this decision is not made by one person. Rather "the
administration" decides on the basis of recommenda
tions of many staff members.
The primary decision-making goes on in the office
of the Vice-President and Provost under the direction
of the Vice-Provost for Budget and Planning. At
present, Ray Bacchetti fills this position. Anyone
interested beyond the bounds of this report should
talk to him or anyone in the Academic Planning
Office on the subject.
Also involved in the decision are reports and
recommendations from the Offices of Financial Aids
and Undergraduate Admissions. The criterion used to
evaluate these and other inputs will be discussed in
detail later in this section.
The interesting fact discovered by this committee
was that in regard to input about proposed tuition
rate increases there is a definite exclusion of student
viewpoints. Being the most directly affected by these
increases the committee feels that students should be
allowed to influence the process more concretely.
This committee served as the only student input
into the process, this basically post facto for this
year. This was very ineffective since the prime con
cern of this committee was to discover the process
itself.
Since our committee will not be functioning in the
future, unless reestablished with a new charge, we
recommend that a student or students be included on
the staff of the Academic Planning Office as part time
assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%

Space paid by News & Publications Service
above wage increases. How can the University predict
such a drastic change?
But the question really at stake is what proportion
of disposable family income is comprised of educa
tional costs. The committee would maintain that, in
the case of either figure, education at Stanford is
becoming more expensive in regard to disposable
income. This places an additional burden on the
students and their parents.
This, our committee feels, will affect student
decisions on attending Stanford. The tuition increase
should not exceed the disposable income increase.
But we realize the added costs due to inflation.
Therefore our committee recommends that the
tuition increase percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable income or consumer
price index, since a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for their education.
We totally agree that 12.9% is too large an increase
and urge reconsideration of the economic indices and
tuition increase.
The second set of considerations is internal budget
considerations. With respect to the budget, the Uni
versity includes a 1% funded improvement factor. In
this period of extreme economic problems, we feel
inclusion of this factor increases the burden of educa
tional costs too much. This is a result of the decrease
in personal income in respect to CPI. Since the CPI is
greater than disposable income increase and the
tuition increase is larger than the CPI, the percentage
of disposable income represented by educational
costs will increase.
Although this funded improvement factor is neces
sary to help achieve growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of resources from pre
sent nonessential uses.
These cutbacks already are devaluing the worth of
a Stanford education. It is unfortunate that the
economic situation dictates these cutbacks, but being
necessary we feel that it is better to sacrifice one
program and save the quality of the rest. Equal
reductions everywhere will just lead us down the path
to mediocrity.
The third and fourth considerations are basically
undecided. The increases at other institutions are not
yet decided or announced publicly. As suggested
before, a study should be undertaken regarding the

public/private cost differential, but from the view
point of students at University of California branches.
With regard to the fifth consideration, financial aid
policy is of prime concern. We totally support Stan
ford's previous policy of providing financial aid to all
students with demonstrated need. <
Because the College Scholarship Service had over
represented parental contributions, it (CSS) has
adopted a new set of curves. For financial aid consi
derations, Stanford is planning only to apply these
curves to entering students.
We find this a totally inequitable allocation of
resources. Returning students have the same need and
should be treated equally. If economic conditions
prevent applying these curves to everyone in respect
to tuition grants, then at a minimum everyone should
be eligible for loans or jobs by the standards of these
new curves.
The new California State Tuition Grants to
middle-income students should help relieve some of
the burden on these students, but we realize the
scarcity of these awards and the fact that they apply
only to entering students.
In regard to general policy, we feel that tuition
increases cannot be justified simply by stating that
financial aid will also increase. Some students will
suffer the increased burden.
Already about 45% of students at Stanford receive
aid; further increases will not achieve the full effect
since most of increase will go to help increase finan
cial aid.
Because of this plateau it appears we are reaching,
it is time the University officers began asking some
serious questions about the worth of a Stanford
Education.
PART 111
The most interesting and theoretical discussions
centered around this final area. We concluded that
there were resources being used inefficiently because
of attendance patterns.
With the realization that for every one hundred
students that start classes in the fall only 98 return in
winter and 92 in spring. Thus, when the University
expands to fulfill the entire need in the autumn, it
has an excess of resources in the spring. .
One alternative would be to give a discount to any
student attending three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example tuition is $l2OO a quarter

unless a person has gone fall and winter, then spring
tuition would only cost $9OO.
Several problems developed here. Examine the
case of a student who attends four quarters from fall
through summer, takes off fall and returns for winter
and spring. Although helping the problems by leaving
the quarter that is most crowded, the student receives
no discount. Also important is that this would basi
cally force a person to take a full year off instead of
the option of leaving for just a quarter. This is a social
cost we don't think we would be willing to absorb.
A second plan would be to set tuition costs
proportional to attendance patterns. Since more
people come fall quarter it would cost most then and
least in spring. This would provide a cost incentive for
attending in cheaper quarters. Also, since many re
sources are developed solely for fall quarter, the cost
of these resources would be borne by those attending
that quarter instead of being equally divided over the
three quarters.
Presently the person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming the full year pays
for him. The problem with this solution is one of
economics. We are not sure what the demand curve is
in relation to attendance. If it were very inelastic,
which very well might be, then a change in price per
quarter will not affect individual preference decisions.
A method of solving this problem would also be to
make summer quarter more attractive. If more stu
dents would attend then, fewer University facilities
would be inefficiently allocated. The problem here
appears to be with faculty participation. They use
summer for research, and may not want to teach also.
Although we developed no specific programs for
increasing attendance in summer, we suggest that this
path be explored.
In thinking about the subject of inefficient re
sources, we concluded that the extra classes started
by students but dropped caused more resources to be
used than necessary. For example, 80 people sign up
for a class so two sections are created, but by the
time finals come there are only 35 students left. This
means the cost of the extra section was a useless one.
Discussed were the possibilities of withdrawing the
option to drop, but the consensus was that this was a
valuable option to have, : not worth sacrificing.
Another solution was to develop a flat fee for tuition
plus a per-unit cost. For example the flat fee for the
first 12 units would be $lOOO. Each additional unit
would be $5O, with refunds available only until the
drop/add deadline. Our committee felt this was one
of the most interesting proposals in that it would
allocate costs among those who benefit.
Within our time limit, our committee could not
examine these proposals completely. We recommend
that the University undertake a study into these and
other alternate proposals.
The problems pointed out in this report alone
dictate that a more equitable allocation of resources
among users and purchasers is required. This report
should include an analysis of the present system as
well.

Following is the Report of the ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition, dated Nov. 25, 1974:
Preface
Established to examine tuition at Stanford, our
committee often found itself discussing the value of a
Stanford education. It was impossible to investigate
tuition rates and increases without also scrutinizing
the worth of the education being purchased.
In order to come to grips with this question, we
limited our examination as closely as possible to
tuition. Instead of researching budget cutting alter
natives, emphasis was placed on three specific facets
in the process.
The first major concern was the process employed
at Stanford. Since almost no publicity or common
knowledge exists with regard to how the tuition rate
is set, we concluded that this process ought to be
determined and explained to the students affected by
the decision. We were interested not only in how a
decision is reached but also in who is involved in this
process.
The actual rate and its effects on students, parents,
academics, and the general functioning of the Univer
sity was the second area examined by this committee.
Topics of interest were financial aid, general econom
ic indices and their relationship to tuition, and atten
dence patterns as affected by an increase. Of prime
interest and concern was the future effects, in three
to five years, of continued increases.
After consideration of these subjects, the more
theoretical arguments, alternatives to the present
system of collecting tuition, were discussed. Concern
was on an economically efficient and equitable alloca
tion of resources.
Major emphasis was placed on the question of
what one was actually paying for with tuition. If one
student was actually subsidizing another student's
education, excluding financial aid; solutions were
sought to remedy this situation. Several proposals
were discussed but we realize that these are not
complete and request that a study be made into this
important question.
Despite what we consider careful analysis, we
realize that it is not a complete report. Any further
suggestions and input would be greatly appreciated.

PARTI
The first topic confronting the committee was the
process by which tuition is set. In trying to find out
who actually sets the tuition rate we discovered that
this decision is not made by one person. Rather "the
administration" decides on the basis of recommenda
tions of many staff members.
The primary decision-making goes on in the office
of the Vice-President and Provost under the direction
of the Vice-Provost for Budget and Planning. At
present, Ray Bacchetti fills this position. Anyone
interested beyond the bounds of this report should
talk to him or anyone in the Academic Planning
Office on the subject.
Also involved in the decision are reports and
recommendations from the Offices of Financial Aids
and Undergraduate Admissions. The criterion used to
evaluate these and other inputs will be discussed in
detail later in this section.
The interesting fact discovered by this committee
was that in regard to input about proposed tuition
rate increases there is a definite exclusion of student
viewpoints. Being the most directly affected by these
increases the committee feels that students should be
allowed to influence the process more concretely.
This committee served as the only student input
into the process, this basically post facto for this
year. This was very ineffective since the prime con
cern of this committee was to discover the process
itself.
Since our committee will not be functioning in the
future, unless reestablished with a new charge, we
recommend that a student or students be included on
the staff of the Academic Planning Office as part time
assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

Besides people involved in the process, the com
mittee discovered that just as important were the
considerations reviewed when arriving at a tuition
rate. The facts specific to this year will be dealt with
in part two of this report.
Background information submitted to Board of
Trustees on Nov. 13, 1973. states that:
"While the [tuition] recommendation in the last
analysis represents a judgment by University officers,
that judgment has its roots in five sets of considera
tions.
"The first—general economic considerations
provides information on relevant factors whose causes
are independent of University actions but whose
effects are influential in the life of the University.
"The second—Operating Budget considerations
deals with institutional income and expense projec
tions and relationships.
"These first two together suggest a narrow range
of tuition alternatives which are then checked critical
ly against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of impor
tant considerations:
"The third—projected tuition increases at other
institutions—is a frame of reference factor showing
simply whether tuition will be in line with those
private institutions with which we share most of our
common candidates.
"The fourth—public/private cost differential
provides one check on cost as a factor in the enroll
ment choices of those admitted.
"The fifth—the relationship between tuition,
financial aid policy, and student enrollment choices
—provides another check on cost by examining the
effect of these policies upon Stanford's ability to
attract and enroll a diverse and high-quality student
bcjdy."
Although feeling that the general basis for these
considerations are sound, our committee recommends
that further study be made into an area of the fifth
consideration.
Although the reports on freshmen admissions are
complete for those applying to Stanford, we feel that
an important factor to consider is those qualified
students who chose not to apply here. We recognize
the difficulty involved, but note the following sugges
tion: possibly a study could be organized in conjunc

tion with the University of California of those fresh
men enrolhng there.
Questions to probe would be why they chose a
public school; did they apply to a private school; if
so, did they apply to Stanford; if not, why not, or
why not to Stanford. We feel this would provide
important insight into student enrollment choices as
affected by tuition.
The final area researched was the communication
of the decision by the University to the student body.
The only time students actually hear of the increase is
when it has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Tentative conclusions ought to be announced and
input solicited before presentation to the Board.
In order to prevent total exclusion of the students,
this committee recommends increased publicity re
garding tentative decisions and justifications involved.
The reactions received should provide constructive
suggestions, thus improving the present decision
making process.
PART II
In regard to the actual rate itself the five conside
rations proposed by the University provide the best
vehicle for our examination. The tuition next year
will increase by 12.9%, or $435, to $3BlO a year, or
$1270 a quarter.
1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89

economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But

General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%

such a drastic change?
But the question really at stake is what proportion
of disposable family income is comprised of educa

income. This places an additional burden on the

These cutbacks already are devaluing the worth of
a Stanford education. It is unfortunate that the
economic situation dictates these cutbacks, but being
necessary we feel that it is better to sacrifice one
program and save the quality of the rest. Equal
reductions everywhere will just lead us down the path
to mediocrity.
The third and fourth considerations are basically
undecided. The increases at other institutions are not
yet decided or announced publicly. As suggested
before, a study should be undertaken regarding the

public/private cost differential, but from the view
point of students at University of California branches.
With regard to the fifth consideration, financial aid
policy is of prime concern. We totally support Stan
ford's previous policy of providing financial aid to all
students with demonstrated need. <
Because the College Scholarship Service had over
represented parental contributions, it (CSS) has
adopted a new set of curves. For financial aid consi
derations, Stanford is planning only to apply these
curves to entering students.
We find this a totally inequitable allocation of
resources. Returning students have the same need and
should be treated equally. If economic conditions
prevent applying these curves to everyone in respect
to tuition grants, then at a minimum everyone should
be eligible for loans or jobs by the standards of these
new curves.
The new California State Tuition Grants to
middle-income students should help relieve some of
the burden on these students, but we realize the
scarcity of these awards and the fact that they apply
only to entering students.
In regard to general policy, we feel that tuition
increases cannot be justified simply by stating that
financial aid will also increase. Some students will
suffer the increased burden.
Already about 45% of students at Stanford receive
aid; further increases will not achieve the full effect
since most of increase will go to help increase finan
cial aid.
Because of this plateau it appears we are reaching,
it is time the University officers began asking some
serious questions about the worth of a Stanford
Education.
PART 111
The most interesting and theoretical discussions
centered around this final area. We concluded that
there were resources being used inefficiently because
of attendance patterns.
With the realization that for every one hundred
students that start classes in the fall only 98 return in
winter and 92 in spring. Thus, when the University
expands to fulfill the entire need in the autumn, it
has an excess of resources in the spring. .
One alternative would be to give a discount to any
student attending three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example tuition is $l2OO a quarter

unless a person has gone fall and winter, then spring
tuition would only cost $9OO.
Several problems developed here. Examine the
case of a student who attends four quarters from fall
through summer, takes off fall and returns for winter
and spring. Although helping the problems by leaving
the quarter that is most crowded, the student receives
no discount. Also important is that this would basi
cally force a person to take a full year off instead of
the option of leaving for just a quarter. This is a social
cost we don't think we would be willing to absorb.
A second plan would be to set tuition costs
proportional to attendance patterns. Since more
people come fall quarter it would cost most then and
least in spring. This would provide a cost incentive for
attending in cheaper quarters. Also, since many re
sources are developed solely for fall quarter, the cost
of these resources would be borne by those attending
that quarter instead of being equally divided over the
three quarters.
Presently the person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming the full year pays
for him. The problem with this solution is one of
economics. We are not sure what the demand curve is
in relation to attendance. If it were very inelastic,
which very well might be, then a change in price per
quarter will not affect individual preference decisions.
A method of solving this problem would also be to
make summer quarter more attractive. If more stu
dents would attend then, fewer University facilities
would be inefficiently allocated. The problem here
appears to be with faculty participation. They use
summer for research, and may not want to teach also.
Although we developed no specific programs for
increasing attendance in summer, we suggest that this
path be explored.
In thinking about the subject of inefficient re
sources, we concluded that the extra classes started
by students but dropped caused more resources to be
used than necessary. For example, 80 people sign up
for a class so two sections are created, but by the
time finals come there are only 35 students left. This
means the cost of the extra section was a useless one.
Discussed were the possibilities of withdrawing the
option to drop, but the consensus was that this was a
valuable option to have, : not worth sacrificing.
Another solution was to develop a flat fee for tuition
plus a per-unit cost. For example the flat fee for the
first 12 units would be $lOOO. Each additional unit
would be $5O, with refunds available only until the
drop/add deadline. Our committee felt this was one
of the most interesting proposals in that it would
allocate costs among those who benefit.
Within our time limit, our committee could not
examine these proposals completely. We recommend
that the University undertake a study into these and
other alternate proposals.
The problems pointed out in this report alone
dictate that a more equitable allocation of resources
among users and purchasers is required. This report
should include an analysis of the present system as
well.

Following is the Report of the ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition, dated Nov. 25, 1974:
Preface
Established to examine tuition at Stanford, our
committee often found itself discussing the value of a
Stanford education. It was impossible to investigate
tuition rates and increases without also scrutinizing
the worth of the education being purchased.
In order to come to grips with this question, we
limited our examination as closely as possible to
tuition. Instead of researching budget cutting alter
natives, emphasis was placed on three specific facets
in the process.
The first major concern was the process employed
at Stanford. Since almost no publicity or common
knowledge exists with regard to how the tuition rate
is set, we concluded that this process ought to be
determined and explained to the students affected by
the decision. We were interested not only in how a
decision is reached but also in who is involved in this
process.
The actual rate and its effects on students, parents,
academics, and the general functioning of the Univer
sity was the second area examined by this committee.
Topics of interest were financial aid, general econom
ic indices and their relationship to tuition, and atten
dence patterns as affected by an increase. Of prime
interest and concern was the future effects, in three
to five years, of continued increases.
After consideration of these subjects, the more
theoretical arguments, alternatives to the present
system of collecting tuition, were discussed. Concern
was on an economically efficient and equitable alloca
tion of resources.
Major emphasis was placed on the question of
what one was actually paying for with tuition. If one
student was actually subsidizing another student's
education, excluding financial aid; solutions were
sought to remedy this situation. Several proposals
were discussed but we realize that these are not
complete and request that a study be made into this
important question.
Despite what we consider careful analysis, we
realize that it is not a complete report. Any further
suggestions and input would be greatly appreciated.

PARTI
The first topic confronting the committee was the
process by which tuition is set. In trying to find out
who actually sets the tuition rate we discovered that
this decision is not made by one person. Rather "the
administration" decides on the basis of recommenda
tions of many staff members.
The primary decision-making goes on in the office
of the Vice-President and Provost under the direction
of the Vice-Provost for Budget and Planning. At
present, Ray Bacchetti fills this position. Anyone
interested beyond the bounds of this report should
talk to him or anyone in the Academic Planning
Office on the subject.
Also involved in the decision are reports and
recommendations from the Offices of Financial Aids
and Undergraduate Admissions. The criterion used to
evaluate these and other inputs will be discussed in
detail later in this section.
The interesting fact discovered by this committee
was that in regard to input about proposed tuition
rate increases there is a definite exclusion of student
viewpoints. Being the most directly affected by these
increases the committee feels that students should be
allowed to influence the process more concretely.
This committee served as the only student input
into the process, this basically post facto for this
year. This was very ineffective since the prime con
cern of this committee was to discover the process
itself.
Since our committee will not be functioning in the
future, unless reestablished with a new charge, we
recommend that a student or students be included on
the staff of the Academic Planning Office as part time
assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

Besides people involved in the process, the com
mittee discovered that just as important were the
considerations reviewed when arriving at a tuition
rate. The facts specific to this year will be dealt with
in part two of this report.
Background information submitted to Board of
Trustees on Nov. 13, 1973. states that:
"While the [tuition] recommendation in the last
analysis represents a judgment by University officers,
that judgment has its roots in five sets of considera
tions.
"The first—general economic considerations
provides information on relevant factors whose causes
are independent of University actions but whose
effects are influential in the life of the University.
"The second—Operating Budget considerations
deals with institutional income and expense projec
tions and relationships.
"These first two together suggest a narrow range
of tuition alternatives which are then checked critical
ly against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of impor
tant considerations:
"The third—projected tuition increases at other
institutions—is a frame of reference factor showing
simply whether tuition will be in line with those
private institutions with which we share most of our
common candidates.
"The fourth—public/private cost differential
provides one check on cost as a factor in the enroll
ment choices of those admitted.
"The fifth—the relationship between tuition,
financial aid policy, and student enrollment choices
—provides another check on cost by examining the
effect of these policies upon Stanford's ability to
attract and enroll a diverse and high-quality student
bcjdy."
Although feeling that the general basis for these
considerations are sound, our committee recommends
that further study be made into an area of the fifth
consideration.
Although the reports on freshmen admissions are
complete for those applying to Stanford, we feel that
an important factor to consider is those qualified
students who chose not to apply here. We recognize
the difficulty involved, but note the following sugges
tion: possibly a study could be organized in conjunc

tion with the University of California of those fresh
men enrolhng there.
Questions to probe would be why they chose a
public school; did they apply to a private school; if
so, did they apply to Stanford; if not, why not, or
why not to Stanford. We feel this would provide
important insight into student enrollment choices as
affected by tuition.
The final area researched was the communication
of the decision by the University to the student body.
The only time students actually hear of the increase is
when it has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Tentative conclusions ought to be announced and
input solicited before presentation to the Board.
In order to prevent total exclusion of the students,
this committee recommends increased publicity re
garding tentative decisions and justifications involved.
The reactions received should provide constructive
suggestions, thus improving the present decision
making process.
PART II
In regard to the actual rate itself the five conside
rations proposed by the University provide the best
vehicle for our examination. The tuition next year
will increase by 12.9%, or $435, to $3BlO a year, or
$1270 a quarter.
1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%

Space paid by News & Publications Service
above wage increases. How can the University predict
such a drastic change?
But the question really at stake is what proportion
of disposable family income is comprised of educa
tional costs. The committee would maintain that, in
the case of either figure, education at Stanford is
becoming more expensive in regard to disposable
income. This places an additional burden on the
students and their parents.
This, our committee feels, will affect student
decisions on attending Stanford. The tuition increase
should not exceed the disposable income increase.
But we realize the added costs due to inflation.
Therefore our committee recommends that the
tuition increase percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable income or consumer
price index, since a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for their education.
We totally agree that 12.9% is too large an increase
and urge reconsideration of the economic indices and
tuition increase.
The second set of considerations is internal budget
considerations. With respect to the budget, the Uni
versity includes a 1% funded improvement factor. In
this period of extreme economic problems, we feel
inclusion of this factor increases the burden of educa
tional costs too much. This is a result of the decrease
in personal income in respect to CPI. Since the CPI is
greater than disposable income increase and the
tuition increase is larger than the CPI, the percentage
of disposable income represented by educational
costs will increase.
Although this funded improvement factor is neces
sary to help achieve growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of resources from pre
sent nonessential uses.
These cutbacks already are devaluing the worth of
a Stanford education. It is unfortunate that the
economic situation dictates these cutbacks, but being
necessary we feel that it is better to sacrifice one
program and save the quality of the rest. Equal
reductions everywhere will just lead us down the path
to mediocrity.
The third and fourth considerations are basically
undecided. The increases at other institutions are not
yet decided or announced publicly. As suggested
before, a study should be undertaken regarding the

public/private cost differential, but from the view
point of students at University of California branches.
With regard to the fifth consideration, financial aid
policy is of prime concern. We totally support Stan
ford's previous policy of providing financial aid to all
students with demonstrated need. <
Because the College Scholarship Service had over
represented parental contributions, it (CSS) has
adopted a new set of curves. For financial aid consi
derations, Stanford is planning only to apply these
curves to entering students.
We find this a totally inequitable allocation of
resources. Returning students have the same need and
should be treated equally. If economic conditions
prevent applying these curves to everyone in respect
to tuition grants, then at a minimum everyone should
be eligible for loans or jobs by the standards of these
new curves.
The new California State Tuition Grants to
middle-income students should help relieve some of
the burden on these students, but we realize the
scarcity of these awards and the fact that they apply
only to entering students.
In regard to general policy, we feel that tuition
increases cannot be justified simply by stating that
financial aid will also increase. Some students will
suffer the increased burden.
Already about 45% of students at Stanford receive
aid; further increases will not achieve the full effect
since most of increase will go to help increase finan
cial aid.
Because of this plateau it appears we are reaching,
it is time the University officers began asking some
serious questions about the worth of a Stanford
Education.

of the most interesting proposals in that it would
allocate costs among those who benefit.
Within our time limit, our committee could not
examine these proposals completely. We recommend
that the University undertake a study into these and

Following is the Report of the ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition, dated Nov. 25, 1974:
Preface
Established to examine tuition at Stanford, our
committee often found itself discussing the value of a
Stanford education. It was impossible to investigate
tuition rates and increases without also scrutinizing
the worth of the education being purchased.
In order to come to grips with this question, we
limited our examination as closely as possible to
tuition. Instead of researching budget cutting alter
natives, emphasis was placed on three specific facets
in the process.
The first major concern was the process employed
at Stanford. Since almost no publicity or common
knowledge exists with regard to how the tuition rate
is set, we concluded that this process ought to be
determined and explained to the students affected by
the decision. We were interested not only in how a
decision is reached but also in who is involved in this
process.
The actual rate and its effects on students, parents,
academics, and the general functioning of the Univer
sity was the second area examined by this committee.
Topics of interest were financial aid, general econom
ic indices and their relationship to tuition, and atten
dence patterns as affected by an increase. Of prime
interest and concern was the future effects, in three
to five years, of continued increases.
After consideration of these subjects, the more
theoretical arguments, alternatives to the present
system of collecting tuition, were discussed. Concern
was on an economically efficient and equitable alloca
tion of resources.
Major emphasis was placed on the question of
what one was actually paying for with tuition. If one
student was actually subsidizing another student's
education, excluding financial aid; solutions were
sought to remedy this situation. Several proposals
were discussed but we realize that these are not
complete and request that a study be made into this
important question.
Despite what we consider careful analysis, we
realize that it is not a complete report. Any further
suggestions and input would be greatly appreciated.

PARTI
The first topic confronting the committee was the
process by which tuition is set. In trying to find out
who actually sets the tuition rate we discovered that
this decision is not made by one person. Rather "the
administration" decides on the basis of recommenda
tions of many staff members.
The primary decision-making goes on in the office
of the Vice-President and Provost under the direction
of the Vice-Provost for Budget and Planning. At
present, Ray Bacchetti fills this position. Anyone
interested beyond the bounds of this report should
talk to him or anyone in the Academic Planning
Office on the subject.
Also involved in the decision are reports and
recommendations from the Offices of Financial Aids
and Undergraduate Admissions. The criterion used to
evaluate these and other inputs will be discussed in
detail later in this section.
The interesting fact discovered by this committee
was that in regard to input about proposed tuition
rate increases there is a definite exclusion of student
viewpoints. Being the most directly affected by these
increases the committee feels that students should be
allowed to influence the process more concretely.
This committee served as the only student input
into the process, this basically post facto for this
year. This was very ineffective since the prime con
cern of this committee was to discover the process
itself.
Since our committee will not be functioning in the
future, unless reestablished with a new charge, we
recommend that a student or students be included on
the staff of the Academic Planning Office as part time
assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

Besides people involved in the process, the com
mittee discovered that just as important were the
considerations reviewed when arriving at a tuition
rate. The facts specific to this year will be dealt with
in part two of this report.
Background information submitted to Board of
Trustees on Nov. 13, 1973. states that:
"While the [tuition] recommendation in the last
analysis represents a judgment by University officers,
that judgment has its roots in five sets of considera
tions.
"The first—general economic considerations
provides information on relevant factors whose causes
are independent of University actions but whose
effects are influential in the life of the University.
"The second—Operating Budget considerations
deals with institutional income and expense projec
tions and relationships.
"These first two together suggest a narrow range
of tuition alternatives which are then checked critical
ly against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of impor
tant considerations:
"The third—projected tuition increases at other
institutions—is a frame of reference factor showing
simply whether tuition will be in line with those
private institutions with which we share most of our
common candidates.
"The fourth—public/private cost differential
provides one check on cost as a factor in the enroll
ment choices of those admitted.
"The fifth—the relationship between tuition,
financial aid policy, and student enrollment choices
—provides another check on cost by examining the
effect of these policies upon Stanford's ability to
attract and enroll a diverse and high-quality student
bcjdy."
Although feeling that the general basis for these
considerations are sound, our committee recommends
that further study be made into an area of the fifth
consideration.
Although the reports on freshmen admissions are
complete for those applying to Stanford, we feel that
an important factor to consider is those qualified
students who chose not to apply here. We recognize
the difficulty involved, but note the following sugges
tion: possibly a study could be organized in conjunc

tion with the University of California of those fresh
men enrolhng there.
Questions to probe would be why they chose a
public school; did they apply to a private school; if
so, did they apply to Stanford; if not, why not, or
why not to Stanford. We feel this would provide
important insight into student enrollment choices as
affected by tuition.
The final area researched was the communication
of the decision by the University to the student body.
The only time students actually hear of the increase is
when it has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Tentative conclusions ought to be announced and
input solicited before presentation to the Board.
In order to prevent total exclusion of the students,
this committee recommends increased publicity re
garding tentative decisions and justifications involved.
The reactions received should provide constructive
suggestions, thus improving the present decision
making process.
PART II
In regard to the actual rate itself the five conside
rations proposed by the University provide the best
vehicle for our examination. The tuition next year
will increase by 12.9%, or $435, to $3BlO a year, or
$1270 a quarter.
1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%

Space paid by News & Publications Service
above wage increases. How can the University predict
such a drastic change?
But the question really at stake is what proportion
of disposable family income is comprised of educa
tional costs. The committee would maintain that, in
the case of either figure, education at Stanford is
becoming more expensive in regard to disposable
income. This places an additional burden on the
students and their parents.
This, our committee feels, will affect student
decisions on attending Stanford. The tuition increase
should not exceed the disposable income increase.
But we realize the added costs due to inflation.
Therefore our committee recommends that the
tuition increase percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable income or consumer
price index, since a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for their education.
We totally agree that 12.9% is too large an increase
and urge reconsideration of the economic indices and
tuition increase.
The second set of considerations is internal budget
considerations. With respect to the budget, the Uni
versity includes a 1% funded improvement factor. In
this period of extreme economic problems, we feel
inclusion of this factor increases the burden of educa
tional costs too much. This is a result of the decrease
in personal income in respect to CPI. Since the CPI is
greater than disposable income increase and the
tuition increase is larger than the CPI, the percentage
of disposable income represented by educational
costs will increase.
Although this funded improvement factor is neces
sary to help achieve growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of resources from pre
sent nonessential uses.
These cutbacks already are devaluing the worth of
a Stanford education. It is unfortunate that the
economic situation dictates these cutbacks, but being
necessary we feel that it is better to sacrifice one
program and save the quality of the rest. Equal
reductions everywhere will just lead us down the path
to mediocrity.
The third and fourth considerations are basically
undecided. The increases at other institutions are not
yet decided or announced publicly. As suggested
before, a study should be undertaken regarding the

public/private cost differential, but from the view
point of students at University of California branches.
With regard to the fifth consideration, financial aid
policy is of prime concern. We totally support Stan
ford's previous policy of providing financial aid to all
students with demonstrated need. <
Because the College Scholarship Service had over
represented parental contributions, it (CSS) has
adopted a new set of curves. For financial aid consi
derations, Stanford is planning only to apply these
curves to entering students.
We find this a totally inequitable allocation of
resources. Returning students have the same need and
should be treated equally. If economic conditions
prevent applying these curves to everyone in respect
to tuition grants, then at a minimum everyone should
be eligible for loans or jobs by the standards of these
new curves.
The new California State Tuition Grants to
middle-income students should help relieve some of
the burden on these students, but we realize the
scarcity of these awards and the fact that they apply
only to entering students.
In regard to general policy, we feel that tuition
increases cannot be justified simply by stating that
financial aid will also increase. Some students will
suffer the increased burden.
Already about 45% of students at Stanford receive
aid; further increases will not achieve the full effect
since most of increase will go to help increase finan
cial aid.
Because of this plateau it appears we are reaching,
it is time the University officers began asking some
serious questions about the worth of a Stanford
Education.
PART 111
The most interesting and theoretical discussions
centered around this final area. We concluded that
there were resources being used inefficiently because
of attendance patterns.
With the realization that for every one hundred
students that start classes in the fall only 98 return in
winter and 92 in spring. Thus, when the University
expands to fulfill the entire need in the autumn, it
has an excess of resources in the spring. .
One alternative would be to give a discount to any
student attending three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example tuition is $l2OO a quarter

unless a person has gone fall and winter, then spring
tuition would only cost $9OO.
Several problems developed here. Examine the
case of a student who attends four quarters from fall
through summer, takes off fall and returns for winter
and spring. Although helping the problems by leaving
the quarter that is most crowded, the student receives
no discount. Also important is that this would basi
cally force a person to take a full year off instead of
the option of leaving for just a quarter. This is a social
cost we don't think we would be willing to absorb.
A second plan would be to set tuition costs
proportional to attendance patterns. Since more
people come fall quarter it would cost most then and
least in spring. This would provide a cost incentive for
attending in cheaper quarters. Also, since many re
sources are developed solely for fall quarter, the cost
of these resources would be borne by those attending
that quarter instead of being equally divided over the
three quarters.
Presently the person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming the full year pays
for him. The problem with this solution is one of
economics. We are not sure what the demand curve is
in relation to attendance. If it were very inelastic,
which very well might be, then a change in price per
quarter will not affect individual preference decisions.
A method of solving this problem would also be to
make summer quarter more attractive. If more stu
dents would attend then, fewer University facilities
would be inefficiently allocated. The problem here
appears to be with faculty participation. They use
summer for research, and may not want to teach also.
Although we developed no specific programs for
increasing attendance in summer, we suggest that this
path be explored.
In thinking about the subject of inefficient re
sources, we concluded that the extra classes started
by students but dropped caused more resources to be
used than necessary. For example, 80 people sign up
for a class so two sections are created, but by the
time finals come there are only 35 students left. This
means the cost of the extra section was a useless one.
Discussed were the possibilities of withdrawing the
option to drop, but the consensus was that this was a
valuable option to have, : not worth sacrificing.
Another solution was to develop a flat fee for tuition
plus a per-unit cost. For example the flat fee for the
first 12 units would be $lOOO. Each additional unit
would be $5O, with refunds available only until the
drop/add deadline. Our committee felt this was one
of the most interesting proposals in that it would
allocate costs among those who benefit.
Within our time limit, our committee could not
examine these proposals completely. We recommend
that the University undertake a study into these and
other alternate proposals.
The problems pointed out in this report alone
dictate that a more equitable allocation of resources
among users and purchasers is required. This report
should include an analysis of the present system as
well.

assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

Besides people involved in the process, the com
mittee discovered that just as important were the
considerations reviewed when arriving at a tuition
rate. The facts specific to this year will be dealt with
in part two of this report.
Background information submitted to Board of
Trustees on Nov. 13, 1973. states that:
"While the [tuition] recommendation in the last
analysis represents a judgment by University officers,
that judgment has its roots in five sets of considera
tions.
"The first—general economic considerations
provides information on relevant factors whose causes
are independent of University actions but whose
effects are influential in the life of the University.
"The second—Operating Budget considerations
deals with institutional income and expense projec
tions and relationships.
"These first two together suggest a narrow range
of tuition alternatives which are then checked critical
ly against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of impor
tant considerations:
"The third—projected tuition increases at other
institutions—is a frame of reference factor showing
simply whether tuition will be in line with those
private institutions with which we share most of our
common candidates.
"The fourth—public/private cost differential
provides one check on cost as a factor in the enroll
ment choices of those admitted.
"The fifth—the relationship between tuition,
financial aid policy, and student enrollment choices
—provides another check on cost by examining the
effect of these policies upon Stanford's ability to
attract and enroll a diverse and high-quality student
bcjdy."
Although feeling that the general basis for these
considerations are sound, our committee recommends
that further study be made into an area of the fifth
consideration.
Although the reports on freshmen admissions are
complete for those applying to Stanford, we feel that
an important factor to consider is those qualified
students who chose not to apply here. We recognize
the difficulty involved, but note the following sugges
tion: possibly a study could be organized in conjunc

tion with the University of California of those fresh
men enrolhng there.
Questions to probe would be why they chose a
public school; did they apply to a private school; if
so, did they apply to Stanford; if not, why not, or
why not to Stanford. We feel this would provide
important insight into student enrollment choices as
affected by tuition.
The final area researched was the communication
of the decision by the University to the student body.
The only time students actually hear of the increase is
when it has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Tentative conclusions ought to be announced and
input solicited before presentation to the Board.
In order to prevent total exclusion of the students,
this committee recommends increased publicity re
garding tentative decisions and justifications involved.
The reactions received should provide constructive
suggestions, thus improving the present decision
making process.
PART II
In regard to the actual rate itself the five conside
rations proposed by the University provide the best
vehicle for our examination. The tuition next year
will increase by 12.9%, or $435, to $3BlO a year, or
$1270 a quarter.
1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%

Space paid by News & Publications Service
above wage increases. How can the University predict
such a drastic change?
But the question really at stake is what proportion
of disposable family income is comprised of educa
tional costs. The committee would maintain that, in
the case of either figure, education at Stanford is
becoming more expensive in regard to disposable
income. This places an additional burden on the
students and their parents.
This, our committee feels, will affect student
decisions on attending Stanford. The tuition increase
should not exceed the disposable income increase.
But we realize the added costs due to inflation.
Therefore our committee recommends that the
tuition increase percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable income or consumer
price index, since a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for their education.
We totally agree that 12.9% is too large an increase
and urge reconsideration of the economic indices and
tuition increase.
The second set of considerations is internal budget
considerations. With respect to the budget, the Uni
versity includes a 1% funded improvement factor. In
this period of extreme economic problems, we feel
inclusion of this factor increases the burden of educa
tional costs too much. This is a result of the decrease
in personal income in respect to CPI. Since the CPI is
greater than disposable income increase and the
tuition increase is larger than the CPI, the percentage
of disposable income represented by educational
costs will increase.
Although this funded improvement factor is neces
sary to help achieve growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of resources from pre
sent nonessential uses.
These cutbacks already are devaluing the worth of
a Stanford education. It is unfortunate that the
economic situation dictates these cutbacks, but being
necessary we feel that it is better to sacrifice one
program and save the quality of the rest. Equal
reductions everywhere will just lead us down the path
to mediocrity.
The third and fourth considerations are basically
undecided. The increases at other institutions are not
yet decided or announced publicly. As suggested
before, a study should be undertaken regarding the

public/private cost differential, but from the view
point of students at University of California branches.
With regard to the fifth consideration, financial aid
policy is of prime concern. We totally support Stan
ford's previous policy of providing financial aid to all
students with demonstrated need. <
Because the College Scholarship Service had over
represented parental contributions, it (CSS) has
adopted a new set of curves. For financial aid consi
derations, Stanford is planning only to apply these
curves to entering students.
We find this a totally inequitable allocation of
resources. Returning students have the same need and
should be treated equally. If economic conditions
prevent applying these curves to everyone in respect
to tuition grants, then at a minimum everyone should
be eligible for loans or jobs by the standards of these
new curves.
The new California State Tuition Grants to
middle-income students should help relieve some of
the burden on these students, but we realize the
scarcity of these awards and the fact that they apply
only to entering students.
In regard to general policy, we feel that tuition
increases cannot be justified simply by stating that
financial aid will also increase. Some students will
suffer the increased burden.
Already about 45% of students at Stanford receive
aid; further increases will not achieve the full effect
since most of increase will go to help increase finan
cial aid.
Because of this plateau it appears we are reaching,
it is time the University officers began asking some
serious questions about the worth of a Stanford
Education.
PART 111
The most interesting and theoretical discussions
centered around this final area. We concluded that
there were resources being used inefficiently because
of attendance patterns.
With the realization that for every one hundred
students that start classes in the fall only 98 return in
winter and 92 in spring. Thus, when the University
expands to fulfill the entire need in the autumn, it
has an excess of resources in the spring. .
One alternative would be to give a discount to any
student attending three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example tuition is $l2OO a quarter

unless a person has gone fall and winter, then spring
tuition would only cost $9OO.
Several problems developed here. Examine the
case of a student who attends four quarters from fall
through summer, takes off fall and returns for winter
and spring. Although helping the problems by leaving
the quarter that is most crowded, the student receives
no discount. Also important is that this would basi
cally force a person to take a full year off instead of
the option of leaving for just a quarter. This is a social
cost we don't think we would be willing to absorb.
A second plan would be to set tuition costs
proportional to attendance patterns. Since more
people come fall quarter it would cost most then and
least in spring. This would provide a cost incentive for
attending in cheaper quarters. Also, since many re
sources are developed solely for fall quarter, the cost
of these resources would be borne by those attending
that quarter instead of being equally divided over the
three quarters.
Presently the person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming the full year pays
for him. The problem with this solution is one of
economics. We are not sure what the demand curve is
in relation to attendance. If it were very inelastic,
which very well might be, then a change in price per
quarter will not affect individual preference decisions.
A method of solving this problem would also be to
make summer quarter more attractive. If more stu
dents would attend then, fewer University facilities
would be inefficiently allocated. The problem here
appears to be with faculty participation. They use
summer for research, and may not want to teach also.
Although we developed no specific programs for
increasing attendance in summer, we suggest that this
path be explored.
In thinking about the subject of inefficient re
sources, we concluded that the extra classes started
by students but dropped caused more resources to be
used than necessary. For example, 80 people sign up
for a class so two sections are created, but by the
time finals come there are only 35 students left. This
means the cost of the extra section was a useless one.
Discussed were the possibilities of withdrawing the
option to drop, but the consensus was that this was a
valuable option to have, : not worth sacrificing.
Another solution was to develop a flat fee for tuition
plus a per-unit cost. For example the flat fee for the
first 12 units would be $lOOO. Each additional unit
would be $5O, with refunds available only until the
drop/add deadline. Our committee felt this was one
of the most interesting proposals in that it would
allocate costs among those who benefit.
Within our time limit, our committee could not
examine these proposals completely. We recommend
that the University undertake a study into these and
other alternate proposals.
The problems pointed out in this report alone
dictate that a more equitable allocation of resources
among users and purchasers is required. This report
should include an analysis of the present system as
well.

Following is the Report of the ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition, dated Nov. 25, 1974:
Preface
Established to examine tuition at Stanford, our
committee often found itself discussing the value of a
Stanford education. It was impossible to investigate
tuition rates and increases without also scrutinizing
the worth of the education being purchased.
In order to come to grips with this question, we
limited our examination as closely as possible to
tuition. Instead of researching budget cutting alter
natives, emphasis was placed on three specific facets
in the process.
The first major concern was the process employed
at Stanford. Since almost no publicity or common
knowledge exists with regard to how the tuition rate
is set, we concluded that this process ought to be
determined and explained to the students affected by
the decision. We were interested not only in how a
decision is reached but also in who is involved in this
process.
The actual rate and its effects on students, parents,
academics, and the general functioning of the Univer
sity was the second area examined by this committee.
Topics of interest were financial aid, general econom
ic indices and their relationship to tuition, and atten
dence patterns as affected by an increase. Of prime
interest and concern was the future effects, in three
to five years, of continued increases.
After consideration of these subjects, the more
theoretical arguments, alternatives to the present
system of collecting tuition, were discussed. Concern
was on an economically efficient and equitable alloca
tion of resources.
Major emphasis was placed on the question of
what one was actually paying for with tuition. If one
student was actually subsidizing another student's
education, excluding financial aid; solutions were
sought to remedy this situation. Several proposals
were discussed but we realize that these are not
complete and request that a study be made into this
important question.
Despite what we consider careful analysis, we
realize that it is not a complete report. Any further
suggestions and input would be greatly appreciated.

PARTI
The first topic confronting the committee was the
process by which tuition is set. In trying to find out
who actually sets the tuition rate we discovered that
this decision is not made by one person. Rather "the
administration" decides on the basis of recommenda
tions of many staff members.
The primary decision-making goes on in the office
of the Vice-President and Provost under the direction
of the Vice-Provost for Budget and Planning. At
present, Ray Bacchetti fills this position. Anyone
interested beyond the bounds of this report should
talk to him or anyone in the Academic Planning
Office on the subject.
Also involved in the decision are reports and
recommendations from the Offices of Financial Aids
and Undergraduate Admissions. The criterion used to
evaluate these and other inputs will be discussed in
detail later in this section.
The interesting fact discovered by this committee
was that in regard to input about proposed tuition
rate increases there is a definite exclusion of student
viewpoints. Being the most directly affected by these
increases the committee feels that students should be
allowed to influence the process more concretely.
This committee served as the only student input
into the process, this basically post facto for this
year. This was very ineffective since the prime con
cern of this committee was to discover the process
itself.
Since our committee will not be functioning in the
future, unless reestablished with a new charge, we
recommend that a student or students be included on
the staff of the Academic Planning Office as part time
assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees

1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%

above wage increases. How can the University predict
such a drastic change?
But the question really at stake is what proportion
of disposable family income is comprised of educa
tional costs. The committee would maintain that, in
the case of either figure, education at Stanford is
becoming more expensive in regard to disposable
income. This places an additional burden on the
students and their parents.
This, our committee feels, will affect student
decisions on attending Stanford. The tuition increase
should not exceed the disposable income increase.
But we realize the added costs due to inflation.
Therefore our committee recommends that the
tuition increase percentage should not exceed the
greater of increases of disposable income or consumer
price index, since a greater increase would cause
increased burden on those paying for their education.
We totally agree that 12.9% is too large an increase
and urge reconsideration of the economic indices and
tuition increase.
The second set of considerations is internal budget
considerations. With respect to the budget, the Uni
versity includes a 1% funded improvement factor. In
this period of extreme economic problems, we feel
inclusion of this factor increases the burden of educa
tional costs too much. This is a result of the decrease
in personal income in respect to CPI. Since the CPI is
greater than disposable income increase and the
tuition increase is larger than the CPI, the percentage
of disposable income represented by educational
costs will increase.
Although this funded improvement factor is neces
sary to help achieve growth, new programs can be
established by a reallocation of resources from pre
sent nonessential uses.
These cutbacks already are devaluing the worth of
a Stanford education. It is unfortunate that the
economic situation dictates these cutbacks, but being
necessary we feel that it is better to sacrifice one
program and save the quality of the rest. Equal
reductions everywhere will just lead us down the path
to mediocrity.
The third and fourth considerations are basically
undecided. The increases at other institutions are not
yet decided or announced publicly. As suggested
before, a study should be undertaken regarding the

public/private cost differential, but from the view
point of students at University of California branches.
With regard to the fifth consideration, financial aid
policy is of prime concern. We totally support Stan
ford's previous policy of providing financial aid to all
students with demonstrated need. <
Because the College Scholarship Service had over
represented parental contributions, it (CSS) has
adopted a new set of curves. For financial aid consi
derations, Stanford is planning only to apply these
curves to entering students.
We find this a totally inequitable allocation of
resources. Returning students have the same need and
should be treated equally. If economic conditions
prevent applying these curves to everyone in respect
to tuition grants, then at a minimum everyone should
be eligible for loans or jobs by the standards of these
new curves.
The new California State Tuition Grants to
middle-income students should help relieve some of
the burden on these students, but we realize the
scarcity of these awards and the fact that they apply
only to entering students.
In regard to general policy, we feel that tuition
increases cannot be justified simply by stating that
financial aid will also increase. Some students will
suffer the increased burden.
Already about 45% of students at Stanford receive
aid; further increases will not achieve the full effect
since most of increase will go to help increase finan
cial aid.
Because of this plateau it appears we are reaching,
it is time the University officers began asking some
serious questions about the worth of a Stanford
Education.
PART 111
The most interesting and theoretical discussions
centered around this final area. We concluded that
there were resources being used inefficiently because
of attendance patterns.
With the realization that for every one hundred
students that start classes in the fall only 98 return in
winter and 92 in spring. Thus, when the University
expands to fulfill the entire need in the autumn, it
has an excess of resources in the spring. .
One alternative would be to give a discount to any
student attending three consecutive quarters in one
school year. For example tuition is $l2OO a quarter

unless a person has gone fall and winter, then spring
tuition would only cost $9OO.
Several problems developed here. Examine the
case of a student who attends four quarters from fall
through summer, takes off fall and returns for winter
and spring. Although helping the problems by leaving
the quarter that is most crowded, the student receives
no discount. Also important is that this would basi
cally force a person to take a full year off instead of
the option of leaving for just a quarter. This is a social
cost we don't think we would be willing to absorb.
A second plan would be to set tuition costs
proportional to attendance patterns. Since more
people come fall quarter it would cost most then and
least in spring. This would provide a cost incentive for
attending in cheaper quarters. Also, since many re
sources are developed solely for fall quarter, the cost
of these resources would be borne by those attending
that quarter instead of being equally divided over the
three quarters.
Presently the person coming only fall quarter gets
off cheap, while the student coming the full year pays
for him. The problem with this solution is one of
economics. We are not sure what the demand curve is
in relation to attendance. If it were very inelastic,
which very well might be, then a change in price per
quarter will not affect individual preference decisions.
A method of solving this problem would also be to
make summer quarter more attractive. If more stu
dents would attend then, fewer University facilities
would be inefficiently allocated. The problem here
appears to be with faculty participation. They use
summer for research, and may not want to teach also.
Although we developed no specific programs for
increasing attendance in summer, we suggest that this
path be explored.
In thinking about the subject of inefficient re
sources, we concluded that the extra classes started
by students but dropped caused more resources to be
used than necessary. For example, 80 people sign up
for a class so two sections are created, but by the
time finals come there are only 35 students left. This
means the cost of the extra section was a useless one.
Discussed were the possibilities of withdrawing the
option to drop, but the consensus was that this was a
valuable option to have, : not worth sacrificing.
Another solution was to develop a flat fee for tuition
plus a per-unit cost. For example the flat fee for the
first 12 units would be $lOOO. Each additional unit
would be $5O, with refunds available only until the
drop/add deadline. Our committee felt this was one
of the most interesting proposals in that it would
allocate costs among those who benefit.
Within our time limit, our committee could not
examine these proposals completely. We recommend
that the University undertake a study into these and
other alternate proposals.
The problems pointed out in this report alone
dictate that a more equitable allocation of resources
among users and purchasers is required. This report
should include an analysis of the present system as
well.

Following is the Report of the ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition, dated Nov. 25, 1974:
Preface
Established to examine tuition at Stanford, our
committee often found itself discussing the value of a
Stanford education. It was impossible to investigate
tuition rates and increases without also scrutinizing
the worth of the education being purchased.
In order to come to grips with this question, we
limited our examination as closely as possible to
tuition. Instead of researching budget cutting alter
natives, emphasis was placed on three specific facets
in the process.
The first major concern was the process employed
at Stanford. Since almost no publicity or common
knowledge exists with regard to how the tuition rate
is set, we concluded that this process ought to be
determined and explained to the students affected by
the decision. We were interested not only in how a
decision is reached but also in who is involved in this
process.
The actual rate and its effects on students, parents,
academics, and the general functioning of the Univer
sity was the second area examined by this committee.
Topics of interest were financial aid, general econom
ic indices and their relationship to tuition, and atten
dence patterns as affected by an increase. Of prime
interest and concern was the future effects, in three
to five years, of continued increases.
After consideration of these subjects, the more
theoretical arguments, alternatives to the present
system of collecting tuition, were discussed. Concern
was on an economically efficient and equitable alloca
tion of resources.
Major emphasis was placed on the question of
what one was actually paying for with tuition. If one
student was actually subsidizing another student's
education, excluding financial aid; solutions were
sought to remedy this situation. Several proposals
were discussed but we realize that these are not
complete and request that a study be made into this
important question.
Despite what we consider careful analysis, we
realize that it is not a complete report. Any further
suggestions and input would be greatly appreciated.

PARTI
The first topic confronting the committee was the
process by which tuition is set. In trying to find out
who actually sets the tuition rate we discovered that
this decision is not made by one person. Rather "the
administration" decides on the basis of recommenda
tions of many staff members.
The primary decision-making goes on in the office
of the Vice-President and Provost under the direction
of the Vice-Provost for Budget and Planning. At
present, Ray Bacchetti fills this position. Anyone
interested beyond the bounds of this report should
talk to him or anyone in the Academic Planning
Office on the subject.
Also involved in the decision are reports and
recommendations from the Offices of Financial Aids
and Undergraduate Admissions. The criterion used to
evaluate these and other inputs will be discussed in
detail later in this section.
The interesting fact discovered by this committee
was that in regard to input about proposed tuition
rate increases there is a definite exclusion of student
viewpoints. Being the most directly affected by these
increases the committee feels that students should be
allowed to influence the process more concretely.
This committee served as the only student input
into the process, this basically post facto for this
year. This was very ineffective since the prime con
cern of this committee was to discover the process
itself.
Since our committee will not be functioning in the
future, unless reestablished with a new charge, we
recommend that a student or students be included on
the staff of the Academic Planning Office as part time
assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

Besides people involved in the process, the com
mittee discovered that just as important were the
considerations reviewed when arriving at a tuition
rate. The facts specific to this year will be dealt with
in part two of this report.
Background information submitted to Board of
Trustees on Nov. 13, 1973. states that:
"While the [tuition] recommendation in the last
analysis represents a judgment by University officers,
that judgment has its roots in five sets of considera
tions.
"The first—general economic considerations
provides information on relevant factors whose causes
are independent of University actions but whose
effects are influential in the life of the University.
"The second—Operating Budget considerations
deals with institutional income and expense projec
tions and relationships.
"These first two together suggest a narrow range
of tuition alternatives which are then checked critical
ly against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of impor
tant considerations:
"The third—projected tuition increases at other
institutions—is a frame of reference factor showing
simply whether tuition will be in line with those
private institutions with which we share most of our
common candidates.
"The fourth—public/private cost differential
provides one check on cost as a factor in the enroll
ment choices of those admitted.
"The fifth—the relationship between tuition,
financial aid policy, and student enrollment choices
—provides another check on cost by examining the
effect of these policies upon Stanford's ability to
attract and enroll a diverse and high-quality student
bcjdy."
Although feeling that the general basis for these
considerations are sound, our committee recommends
that further study be made into an area of the fifth
consideration.
Although the reports on freshmen admissions are
complete for those applying to Stanford, we feel that
an important factor to consider is those qualified
students who chose not to apply here. We recognize
the difficulty involved, but note the following sugges
tion: possibly a study could be organized in conjunc

tion with the University of California of those fresh
men enrolhng there.
Questions to probe would be why they chose a
public school; did they apply to a private school; if
so, did they apply to Stanford; if not, why not, or
why not to Stanford. We feel this would provide
important insight into student enrollment choices as
affected by tuition.
The final area researched was the communication
of the decision by the University to the student body.
The only time students actually hear of the increase is
when it has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Tentative conclusions ought to be announced and
input solicited before presentation to the Board.
In order to prevent total exclusion of the students,
this committee recommends increased publicity re
garding tentative decisions and justifications involved.
The reactions received should provide constructive
suggestions, thus improving the present decision
making process.
PART II
In regard to the actual rate itself the five conside
rations proposed by the University provide the best
vehicle for our examination. The tuition next year
will increase by 12.9%, or $435, to $3BlO a year, or
$1270 a quarter.
1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
