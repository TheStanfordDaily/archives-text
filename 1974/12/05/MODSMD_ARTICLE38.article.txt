# ASSU committee urges reconsideration of proposed tuition increase

### 
Following is the Report of the ASSU Senate Select
Committee on Tuition, dated Nov. 25, 1974:
Preface
Established to examine tuition at Stanford, our
committee often found itself discussing the value of a
Stanford education. It was impossible to investigate
tuition rates and increases without also scrutinizing
the worth of the education being purchased.
In order to come to grips with this question, we
limited our examination as closely as possible to
tuition. Instead of researching budget cutting alter
natives, emphasis was placed on three specific facets
in the process.
The first major concern was the process employed
at Stanford. Since almost no publicity or common
knowledge exists with regard to how the tuition rate
is set, we concluded that this process ought to be
determined and explained to the students affected by
the decision. We were interested not only in how a
decision is reached but also in who is involved in this
process.
The actual rate and its effects on students, parents,
academics, and the general functioning of the Univer
sity was the second area examined by this committee.
Topics of interest were financial aid, general econom
ic indices and their relationship to tuition, and atten
dence patterns as affected by an increase. Of prime
interest and concern was the future effects, in three
to five years, of continued increases.
After consideration of these subjects, the more
theoretical arguments, alternatives to the present
system of collecting tuition, were discussed. Concern
was on an economically efficient and equitable alloca
tion of resources.
Major emphasis was placed on the question of
what one was actually paying for with tuition. If one
student was actually subsidizing another student's
education, excluding financial aid; solutions were
sought to remedy this situation. Several proposals
were discussed but we realize that these are not
complete and request that a study be made into this
important question.
Despite what we consider careful analysis, we
realize that it is not a complete report. Any further
suggestions and input would be greatly appreciated.

PARTI
The first topic confronting the committee was the
process by which tuition is set. In trying to find out
who actually sets the tuition rate we discovered that
this decision is not made by one person. Rather "the
administration" decides on the basis of recommenda
tions of many staff members.
The primary decision-making goes on in the office
of the Vice-President and Provost under the direction
of the Vice-Provost for Budget and Planning. At
present, Ray Bacchetti fills this position. Anyone
interested beyond the bounds of this report should
talk to him or anyone in the Academic Planning
Office on the subject.
Also involved in the decision are reports and
recommendations from the Offices of Financial Aids
and Undergraduate Admissions. The criterion used to
evaluate these and other inputs will be discussed in
detail later in this section.
The interesting fact discovered by this committee
was that in regard to input about proposed tuition
rate increases there is a definite exclusion of student
viewpoints. Being the most directly affected by these
increases the committee feels that students should be
allowed to influence the process more concretely.
This committee served as the only student input
into the process, this basically post facto for this
year. This was very ineffective since the prime con
cern of this committee was to discover the process
itself.
Since our committee will not be functioning in the
future, unless reestablished with a new charge, we
recommend that a student or students be included on
the staff of the Academic Planning Office as part time
assistants. This would serve to improve the present
situation in many ways.
The most important benefit to be derived from
this charge would be the presence of the student
voice. This influence would serve in a positive, con
structive way rather than the negative, reactionary
way that the students are now heard.
Presently student members on trustee committees
have some control over the final decision, but general
ly their influence functions only in a review capacity.
This we feel is beneficial, but only if there is also
student input into arriving at the decision.

Besides people involved in the process, the com
mittee discovered that just as important were the
considerations reviewed when arriving at a tuition
rate. The facts specific to this year will be dealt with
in part two of this report.
Background information submitted to Board of
Trustees on Nov. 13, 1973. states that:
"While the [tuition] recommendation in the last
analysis represents a judgment by University officers,
that judgment has its roots in five sets of considera
tions.
"The first—general economic considerations
provides information on relevant factors whose causes
are independent of University actions but whose
effects are influential in the life of the University.
"The second—Operating Budget considerations
deals with institutional income and expense projec
tions and relationships.
"These first two together suggest a narrow range
of tuition alternatives which are then checked critical
ly against the third, fourth, and fifth sets of impor
tant considerations:
"The third—projected tuition increases at other
institutions—is a frame of reference factor showing
simply whether tuition will be in line with those
private institutions with which we share most of our
common candidates.
"The fourth—public/private cost differential
provides one check on cost as a factor in the enroll
ment choices of those admitted.
"The fifth—the relationship between tuition,
financial aid policy, and student enrollment choices
—provides another check on cost by examining the
effect of these policies upon Stanford's ability to
attract and enroll a diverse and high-quality student
bcjdy."
Although feeling that the general basis for these
considerations are sound, our committee recommends
that further study be made into an area of the fifth
consideration.
Although the reports on freshmen admissions are
complete for those applying to Stanford, we feel that
an important factor to consider is those qualified
students who chose not to apply here. We recognize
the difficulty involved, but note the following sugges
tion: possibly a study could be organized in conjunc

tion with the University of California of those fresh
men enrolhng there.
Questions to probe would be why they chose a
public school; did they apply to a private school; if
so, did they apply to Stanford; if not, why not, or
why not to Stanford. We feel this would provide
important insight into student enrollment choices as
affected by tuition.
The final area researched was the communication
of the decision by the University to the student body.
The only time students actually hear of the increase is
when it has been approved by the Board of Trustees.
Tentative conclusions ought to be announced and
input solicited before presentation to the Board.
In order to prevent total exclusion of the students,
this committee recommends increased publicity re
garding tentative decisions and justifications involved.
The reactions received should provide constructive
suggestions, thus improving the present decision
making process.
PART II
In regard to the actual rate itself the five conside
rations proposed by the University provide the best
vehicle for our examination. The tuition next year
will increase by 12.9%, or $435, to $3BlO a year, or
$1270 a quarter.
1973-74 to 1974-75 to 1975-76
General Tuition $3,135 $3,375 $3,810
Dollar Increase $240 $435
% Increase 7.66 12.89
With regard to general economic conditions, the
economy is suffering greatly and is very unstable. But
necessity dictates that predictions be made about
future economic indices. The two important indices
are those representing costs and those showing in
comes. The University predicts the consumer price
index to increase 9%, while they predict a personal
income increase of 10.5%. We question these predic
tions as this year has seen the CPI increase about 5%
