# Academic Planning Office analyzes admissions, financial aid process
## 
### 
Following are excerpts from a report on Freshman
Admissions and Financial aid, 1974-75 prepared by
the Academic Planning Office Dec. 2, 1974:
Despite the concern of many that changing eco
nomic and social conditions might adversely affect
the propensity of high school graduates to apply to
Stanford, the number of completed ("actionable")
applications actually grew this year by about 6%.
Continuing a change noted last year, the distribu
tions of both the academic and nonacademic ratings
shifted in the direction of higher quality among appli
cants for 1974-75.
With a larger number of actionable applications,
but with essentially the same number of freshman
places to fill, Stanford admitted a slightly lower pro
portion of its applicants (31%) this year than in the
prior two years. However, the admitted candidates
seem to have been slightly more willing to come, on
the whole, since 63% enrolled this year, a gain of 1-2
points over the prior two years.
Along with the increased number of applications,
this figure suggests that at least at the superficial
level, there is not yet any evidence of a defection of
potential-freshmen away from Stanford.
Nevertheless, several notable changes in enrollment
behavior did occur this year.

When grouped together, 63% of the minority
candidates enrolled, a decline of 1.8 points from last
year. This change represented a severe drop (12.7
points) among blacks, and almost-as-large gain (11.7
points) among Mexican Americans, and a slight in
crease (2.3 points) among American Indians.
In addition, admitted applicants with high aca
demic ratings were more likely this year than last to
accept their admission to Stanford. For example,
40.2% of the 1974-75 top category enrolled, as
against 33.9% last year. This change may well repre
sent only an adjustment from an anomaly last year,
since in the 1972-73 cohort, the equivalent figure was
43.3%.
After noticing in the 1972-73 group a sharp discre
pancy between men's and women's likelihood of
enrolling, we found last year that the difference has
diminished (with 66% of the woman and 60% of the
men admitted planning to actually enroll).
In the last few years, considerable anxiety has
developed at Stanford and across the nation about
the evolution of a "middle-income" or "middle-class"
problem. The concern is that as tuition and fees rise
rapidly, students from wealthy homes pay the higher

prices with minimal difficulty and students from poor
homes receive increased financial aid commensurate
with their increased need, while students from homes
in the ill-defined middle, who presumably receive
little aid, find themselves in an economic bind.
In anticipation of such a development, Stanford
financial aid officers had begun to pay special atten
tion to candidates whose financial conditions suggest
marginal ability to pay; yet the problem of definition
remains to beleaguer empirical specification.
Such an economic squeeze, if it exists, clearly is
more easily felt by the pressured middle group than
measured by an institution. In our previous research
and in this report, we have relied upon parental
income and "family contribution" as working indica
tors of family economic status, although more refined
measures which emphasize the strain on a family's
budget have been suggested and are being explored.
Although local and national attention has focused
on the economic pressures confronting the "middle"
group (however defined), it is essential to recognize
that college enrollment decisions are likely to be
strongly influenced by a host of social factors as well.
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon and Director
of Financial Aids Robert Huff have emphasized that

different perceptions and levels of expectation of the
University might be held by applicants (and by fami
lies of applicants) from different social backgrounds.
Too, they have stressed that trie values of individ
uals obviously vary across social class, and that this
variability can be reasonably expected to enter in to
the college choices of freshmen to be.
Since social and economic characteristics tend to
be closely correlated in the population at large, it is
therefore risky simply to examine enrollment rates
across financial dimensions and assert that a de
pressed rate in a single category indicates genuine
financial strain in that category, or alternatively, that
the absence of variation across categories signifies
equalized ability or willingness to pay.
As long as we guard against unjustified causal
inferences, simple descriptive data highlighting the
relationships between enrollment likelihood and
financial variables can nevertheless be valuable. The
following charts link enrollment with family contri
bution and income, respectively. In each, the whole
admitted group has been divided according to aca
demic rating in order to minimize the counfounding
effects of ability on the associations in question.

Using family contributions as the economic mea
sure, one does not easily detect any major depression
in enrollment rate across the scale, with the exception
perhaps of the low-rating group in the $6,000-$6,999
range. On the income scale, the relationship between
economic status and enrollment likelihood does not
seem suggestive of any broad, well delineated "prob
lem."
As in the past two years, the Office of Undergrad
uate Admissions this year mailed questionnaires to
those admitted candidates who elected not to enroll
at Stanford. The goal of this survey was to find out
which alternative institution they chose, as well as to
elicit from the nonenrolling candidates descriptions
of their reasons for choosing that institution.
This year, 82% of the group decided to enroll at an
independent college or university, while 18% chose a
public college or university. These figures correspond
to a similar change observed last year:
% Private % Public
1972-73 75 25
1973-74 77 23
1974-75 82 18
Despite the cost differential between public and
private institutions, admitted applicants who go else
where appear increasingly likely to turn to a private
institution.

The respondents' answers to a set of questions
concerning their reasons for choosing another school
over Stanford [shows].. .the percentage indicating
that cost was a "strong influence" in the decision not
to come to Stanford fell two points this year to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points to 15%. The latter change was evenly
distributed between those who chose public and
those who chose private.
One seemingly nonfinancial question may have
developed financial significance this year due to the
increasing public attention focused on the cost of
higher education. Although over the past two years a
stable 7% of the respondents choosing public schools
indicated family preferences as a strong influence in
their decisions, this year the figure rose to 11%.
It may be that as costs rise, parents are becoming
more anxious to see their* children enroll in public
institutions. This hypothesis is somewhat corrobo
rated by the fact that no comparable shift has
occurred among those choosing private institutions.

After noticing in the 1972-73 group a sharp discre
pancy between men's and women's likelihood of
enrolling, we found last year that the difference has
diminished (with 66% of the woman and 60% of the
men admitted planning to actually enroll).
In the last few years, considerable anxiety has
developed at Stanford and across the nation about
the evolution of a "middle-income" or "middle-class"
problem. The concern is that as tuition and fees rise
rapidly, students from wealthy homes pay the higher

prices with minimal difficulty and students from poor
homes receive increased financial aid commensurate
with their increased need, while students from homes
in the ill-defined middle, who presumably receive
little aid, find themselves in an economic bind.
In anticipation of such a development, Stanford
financial aid officers had begun to pay special atten
tion to candidates whose financial conditions suggest
marginal ability to pay; yet the problem of definition
remains to beleaguer empirical specification.
Such an economic squeeze, if it exists, clearly is
more easily felt by the pressured middle group than
measured by an institution. In our previous research
and in this report, we have relied upon parental
income and "family contribution" as working indica
tors of family economic status, although more refined
measures which emphasize the strain on a family's
budget have been suggested and are being explored.
Although local and national attention has focused
on the economic pressures confronting the "middle"
group (however defined), it is essential to recognize
that college enrollment decisions are likely to be
strongly influenced by a host of social factors as well.
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon and Director
of Financial Aids Robert Huff have emphasized that

different perceptions and levels of expectation of the
University might be held by applicants (and by fami
lies of applicants) from different social backgrounds.
Too, they have stressed that trie values of individ
uals obviously vary across social class, and that this
variability can be reasonably expected to enter in to
the college choices of freshmen to be.
Since social and economic characteristics tend to
be closely correlated in the population at large, it is
therefore risky simply to examine enrollment rates
across financial dimensions and assert that a de
pressed rate in a single category indicates genuine
financial strain in that category, or alternatively, that
the absence of variation across categories signifies
equalized ability or willingness to pay.
As long as we guard against unjustified causal
inferences, simple descriptive data highlighting the
relationships between enrollment likelihood and
financial variables can nevertheless be valuable. The
following charts link enrollment with family contri
bution and income, respectively. In each, the whole
admitted group has been divided according to aca
demic rating in order to minimize the counfounding
effects of ability on the associations in question.

Using family contributions as the economic mea
sure, one does not easily detect any major depression
in enrollment rate across the scale, with the exception
perhaps of the low-rating group in the $6,000-$6,999
range. On the income scale, the relationship between
economic status and enrollment likelihood does not
seem suggestive of any broad, well delineated "prob
lem."
As in the past two years, the Office of Undergrad
uate Admissions this year mailed questionnaires to
those admitted candidates who elected not to enroll
at Stanford. The goal of this survey was to find out
which alternative institution they chose, as well as to
elicit from the nonenrolling candidates descriptions
of their reasons for choosing that institution.
This year, 82% of the group decided to enroll at an
independent college or university, while 18% chose a
public college or university. These figures correspond
to a similar change observed last year:
% Private % Public
1972-73 75 25
1973-74 77 23
1974-75 82 18
Despite the cost differential between public and
private institutions, admitted applicants who go else
where appear increasingly likely to turn to a private
institution.

other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points to 15%. The latter change was evenly
distributed between those who chose public and
those who chose private.
One seemingly nonfinancial question may have
developed financial significance this year due to the
increasing public attention focused on the cost of
higher education. Although over the past two years a
stable 7% of the respondents choosing public schools
indicated family preferences as a strong influence in
their decisions, this year the figure rose to 11%.
It may be that as costs rise, parents are becoming
more anxious to see their* children enroll in public
institutions. This hypothesis is somewhat corrobo
rated by the fact that no comparable shift has
occurred among those choosing private institutions.

Following are excerpts from a report on Freshman
Admissions and Financial aid, 1974-75 prepared by
the Academic Planning Office Dec. 2, 1974:
Despite the concern of many that changing eco
nomic and social conditions might adversely affect
the propensity of high school graduates to apply to
Stanford, the number of completed ("actionable")
applications actually grew this year by about 6%.
Continuing a change noted last year, the distribu
tions of both the academic and nonacademic ratings
shifted in the direction of higher quality among appli
cants for 1974-75.
With a larger number of actionable applications,
but with essentially the same number of freshman
places to fill, Stanford admitted a slightly lower pro
portion of its applicants (31%) this year than in the
prior two years. However, the admitted candidates
seem to have been slightly more willing to come, on
the whole, since 63% enrolled this year, a gain of 1-2
points over the prior two years.
Along with the increased number of applications,
this figure suggests that at least at the superficial
level, there is not yet any evidence of a defection of
potential-freshmen away from Stanford.
Nevertheless, several notable changes in enrollment
behavior did occur this year.

When grouped together, 63% of the minority
candidates enrolled, a decline of 1.8 points from last
year. This change represented a severe drop (12.7
points) among blacks, and almost-as-large gain (11.7
points) among Mexican Americans, and a slight in
crease (2.3 points) among American Indians.
In addition, admitted applicants with high aca
demic ratings were more likely this year than last to
accept their admission to Stanford. For example,
40.2% of the 1974-75 top category enrolled, as
against 33.9% last year. This change may well repre
sent only an adjustment from an anomaly last year,
since in the 1972-73 cohort, the equivalent figure was
43.3%.

therefore risky simply to examine enrollment rates
across financial dimensions and assert that a de
pressed rate in a single category indicates genuine
financial strain in that category, or alternatively, that
the absence of variation across categories signifies
equalized ability or willingness to pay.
As long as we guard against unjustified causal
inferences, simple descriptive data highlighting the
relationships between enrollment likelihood and
financial variables can nevertheless be valuable. The
following charts link enrollment with family contri
bution and income, respectively. In each, the whole
admitted group has been divided according to aca
demic rating in order to minimize the counfounding
effects of ability on the associations in question.

Using family contributions as the economic mea
sure, one does not easily detect any major depression
in enrollment rate across the scale, with the exception
perhaps of the low-rating group in the $6,000-$6,999
range. On the income scale, the relationship between
economic status and enrollment likelihood does not
seem suggestive of any broad, well delineated "prob
lem."
As in the past two years, the Office of Undergrad
uate Admissions this year mailed questionnaires to
those admitted candidates who elected not to enroll
at Stanford. The goal of this survey was to find out
which alternative institution they chose, as well as to
elicit from the nonenrolling candidates descriptions
of their reasons for choosing that institution.
This year, 82% of the group decided to enroll at an
independent college or university, while 18% chose a
public college or university. These figures correspond
to a similar change observed last year:
% Private % Public
1972-73 75 25
1973-74 77 23
1974-75 82 18
Despite the cost differential between public and
private institutions, admitted applicants who go else
where appear increasingly likely to turn to a private
institution.

On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points to 15%. The latter change was evenly
distributed between those who chose public and
those who chose private.
One seemingly nonfinancial question may have
developed financial significance this year due to the
increasing public attention focused on the cost of
higher education. Although over the past two years a
stable 7% of the respondents choosing public schools
indicated family preferences as a strong influence in
their decisions, this year the figure rose to 11%.
It may be that as costs rise, parents are becoming
more anxious to see their* children enroll in public
institutions. This hypothesis is somewhat corrobo
rated by the fact that no comparable shift has
occurred among those choosing private institutions.

Following are excerpts from a report on Freshman
Admissions and Financial aid, 1974-75 prepared by
the Academic Planning Office Dec. 2, 1974:
Despite the concern of many that changing eco
nomic and social conditions might adversely affect
the propensity of high school graduates to apply to
Stanford, the number of completed ("actionable")
applications actually grew this year by about 6%.
Continuing a change noted last year, the distribu
tions of both the academic and nonacademic ratings
shifted in the direction of higher quality among appli
cants for 1974-75.
With a larger number of actionable applications,
but with essentially the same number of freshman
places to fill, Stanford admitted a slightly lower pro
portion of its applicants (31%) this year than in the
prior two years. However, the admitted candidates
seem to have been slightly more willing to come, on
the whole, since 63% enrolled this year, a gain of 1-2
points over the prior two years.
Along with the increased number of applications,
this figure suggests that at least at the superficial
level, there is not yet any evidence of a defection of
potential-freshmen away from Stanford.
Nevertheless, several notable changes in enrollment
behavior did occur this year.

When grouped together, 63% of the minority
candidates enrolled, a decline of 1.8 points from last
year. This change represented a severe drop (12.7
points) among blacks, and almost-as-large gain (11.7
points) among Mexican Americans, and a slight in
crease (2.3 points) among American Indians.
In addition, admitted applicants with high aca
demic ratings were more likely this year than last to
accept their admission to Stanford. For example,
40.2% of the 1974-75 top category enrolled, as
against 33.9% last year. This change may well repre
sent only an adjustment from an anomaly last year,
since in the 1972-73 cohort, the equivalent figure was
43.3%.
After noticing in the 1972-73 group a sharp discre
pancy between men's and women's likelihood of
enrolling, we found last year that the difference has
diminished (with 66% of the woman and 60% of the
men admitted planning to actually enroll).
In the last few years, considerable anxiety has
developed at Stanford and across the nation about
the evolution of a "middle-income" or "middle-class"
problem. The concern is that as tuition and fees rise
rapidly, students from wealthy homes pay the higher

prices with minimal difficulty and students from poor
homes receive increased financial aid commensurate
with their increased need, while students from homes
in the ill-defined middle, who presumably receive
little aid, find themselves in an economic bind.
In anticipation of such a development, Stanford
financial aid officers had begun to pay special atten
tion to candidates whose financial conditions suggest
marginal ability to pay; yet the problem of definition
remains to beleaguer empirical specification.
Such an economic squeeze, if it exists, clearly is
more easily felt by the pressured middle group than
measured by an institution. In our previous research
and in this report, we have relied upon parental
income and "family contribution" as working indica
tors of family economic status, although more refined
measures which emphasize the strain on a family's
budget have been suggested and are being explored.
Although local and national attention has focused
on the economic pressures confronting the "middle"
group (however defined), it is essential to recognize
that college enrollment decisions are likely to be
strongly influenced by a host of social factors as well.
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon and Director
of Financial Aids Robert Huff have emphasized that

different perceptions and levels of expectation of the
University might be held by applicants (and by fami
lies of applicants) from different social backgrounds.
Too, they have stressed that trie values of individ
uals obviously vary across social class, and that this
variability can be reasonably expected to enter in to
the college choices of freshmen to be.

The respondents' answers to a set of questions
concerning their reasons for choosing another school
over Stanford [shows].. .the percentage indicating
that cost was a "strong influence" in the decision not
to come to Stanford fell two points this year to 20%.
On the other hand, the fraction indicating that the
other school offered more attractive financial aid rose
three points to 15%. The latter change was evenly
distributed between those who chose public and
those who chose private.
One seemingly nonfinancial question may have
developed financial significance this year due to the
increasing public attention focused on the cost of
higher education. Although over the past two years a
stable 7% of the respondents choosing public schools
indicated family preferences as a strong influence in
their decisions, this year the figure rose to 11%.
It may be that as costs rise, parents are becoming
more anxious to see their* children enroll in public
institutions. This hypothesis is somewhat corrobo
rated by the fact that no comparable shift has
occurred among those choosing private institutions.

Following are excerpts from a report on Freshman
Admissions and Financial aid, 1974-75 prepared by
the Academic Planning Office Dec. 2, 1974:
Despite the concern of many that changing eco
nomic and social conditions might adversely affect
the propensity of high school graduates to apply to
Stanford, the number of completed ("actionable")
applications actually grew this year by about 6%.
Continuing a change noted last year, the distribu
tions of both the academic and nonacademic ratings
shifted in the direction of higher quality among appli
cants for 1974-75.
With a larger number of actionable applications,
but with essentially the same number of freshman
places to fill, Stanford admitted a slightly lower pro
portion of its applicants (31%) this year than in the
prior two years. However, the admitted candidates
seem to have been slightly more willing to come, on
the whole, since 63% enrolled this year, a gain of 1-2
points over the prior two years.
Along with the increased number of applications,
this figure suggests that at least at the superficial
level, there is not yet any evidence of a defection of
potential-freshmen away from Stanford.
Nevertheless, several notable changes in enrollment
behavior did occur this year.

When grouped together, 63% of the minority
candidates enrolled, a decline of 1.8 points from last
year. This change represented a severe drop (12.7
points) among blacks, and almost-as-large gain (11.7
points) among Mexican Americans, and a slight in
crease (2.3 points) among American Indians.
In addition, admitted applicants with high aca
demic ratings were more likely this year than last to
accept their admission to Stanford. For example,
40.2% of the 1974-75 top category enrolled, as
against 33.9% last year. This change may well repre
sent only an adjustment from an anomaly last year,
since in the 1972-73 cohort, the equivalent figure was
43.3%.
After noticing in the 1972-73 group a sharp discre
pancy between men's and women's likelihood of
enrolling, we found last year that the difference has
diminished (with 66% of the woman and 60% of the
men admitted planning to actually enroll).
In the last few years, considerable anxiety has
developed at Stanford and across the nation about
the evolution of a "middle-income" or "middle-class"
problem. The concern is that as tuition and fees rise
rapidly, students from wealthy homes pay the higher

prices with minimal difficulty and students from poor
homes receive increased financial aid commensurate
with their increased need, while students from homes
in the ill-defined middle, who presumably receive
little aid, find themselves in an economic bind.
In anticipation of such a development, Stanford
financial aid officers had begun to pay special atten
tion to candidates whose financial conditions suggest
marginal ability to pay; yet the problem of definition
remains to beleaguer empirical specification.
Such an economic squeeze, if it exists, clearly is
more easily felt by the pressured middle group than
measured by an institution. In our previous research
and in this report, we have relied upon parental
income and "family contribution" as working indica
tors of family economic status, although more refined
measures which emphasize the strain on a family's
budget have been suggested and are being explored.
Although local and national attention has focused
on the economic pressures confronting the "middle"
group (however defined), it is essential to recognize
that college enrollment decisions are likely to be
strongly influenced by a host of social factors as well.
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon and Director
of Financial Aids Robert Huff have emphasized that

different perceptions and levels of expectation of the
University might be held by applicants (and by fami
lies of applicants) from different social backgrounds.
Too, they have stressed that trie values of individ
uals obviously vary across social class, and that this
variability can be reasonably expected to enter in to
the college choices of freshmen to be.
Since social and economic characteristics tend to
be closely correlated in the population at large, it is
therefore risky simply to examine enrollment rates
across financial dimensions and assert that a de
pressed rate in a single category indicates genuine
financial strain in that category, or alternatively, that
the absence of variation across categories signifies
equalized ability or willingness to pay.
As long as we guard against unjustified causal
inferences, simple descriptive data highlighting the
relationships between enrollment likelihood and
financial variables can nevertheless be valuable. The
following charts link enrollment with family contri
bution and income, respectively. In each, the whole
admitted group has been divided according to aca
demic rating in order to minimize the counfounding
effects of ability on the associations in question.

Using family contributions as the economic mea
sure, one does not easily detect any major depression
in enrollment rate across the scale, with the exception
perhaps of the low-rating group in the $6,000-$6,999
range. On the income scale, the relationship between
economic status and enrollment likelihood does not
seem suggestive of any broad, well delineated "prob
lem."
As in the past two years, the Office of Undergrad
uate Admissions this year mailed questionnaires to
those admitted candidates who elected not to enroll
at Stanford. The goal of this survey was to find out
which alternative institution they chose, as well as to
elicit from the nonenrolling candidates descriptions
of their reasons for choosing that institution.
This year, 82% of the group decided to enroll at an
independent college or university, while 18% chose a
public college or university. These figures correspond
to a similar change observed last year:
% Private % Public
1972-73 75 25
1973-74 77 23
1974-75 82 18
Despite the cost differential between public and
private institutions, admitted applicants who go else
where appear increasingly likely to turn to a private
institution.
