# Panel Studies Transcript Changes
## 'Drop Deadlines' Supported 
### GLENN KRAMON 
A straw vote by the Ad Hoc Panel
to Study the Grading System
yesterday indicated a majority of its
members favor the reinstatement of a
"drop deadline" for classes and a
notation on the student's transcript if
he or she drops or fails a course after
that deadline. *
The panel, including two ex-officio
members, preferred this "historical
record" system by a 6-3 margin. Of
the three students' on the panel, two
voted with the majority.
The University presently utilizes a
"record of achievement" system
adopted in 1970, under which a
notation of the student's failure to
satisfactorily complete a course does

not appear on the transcript. A
student may drop a course until 24
hours before the final exam, or may
simply skip the final and receive a "no
credit" which does not appear on his
or her record.
Because of the issue's controversial
and complex nature, the panel has
decided to submit both a majority and
a minority report to its parent
committee, the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(C-AAA), according to Statistics Prof.
Bradley Efron, who chairs the panel.
The panel will meet again next
Thursday in an attempt to complete
the reports and send them on to the
C-AAA, which is scheduled to meet
Jan. 15. * •;
Senate Debate
If approved by the C-AAA, the
reports would be sent to the Faculty
Senate for what is expected to be a
heated debate.
Some panel members said they
would be reluctant to indicate their
personal preferences until after the
two reports are completed and sent to
the C-AAA.
Complete Transcript
But they agreed that the division
over the systems centers around
whether the present transcript is
complete enough without mention of
courses the student has dropped or
failed.
Those who favor a return to the
historical record system agreed that
the student's transcript should contain
as much information as possible for
future evaluation.
"The more notations there are, the
more meaningful the discussion of the
student's grades would be," said Karen
Swisher, a graduate student in business
on the panel.
Advocates of this position also
contended that students should be

forced to make a definite choice on
whether or not to stay in a class
toward the middle of the quarter
rather than decide more casually at the
end of the term.
No Penalty
Supporters of the present record of
achievement system say it allows
students to attempt to pass a valuable
but difficult course without penalty
for failure or dropping.
Efron, who voted with the
minority, added that "the present
system focuses attention on grades as a
measure of intellectual merit rather
than as a form of disciplinary action or
academic bookkeeping."
