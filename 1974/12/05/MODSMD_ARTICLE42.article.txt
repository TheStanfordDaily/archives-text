Coal Miners Vole To End Strike >
CHARLESTON, W.Va. The United Mine Workers
union has ratified a new contract for 120,000 coal miners,
unofficial returns showed yesterday, paving the way for an
end of a three-week-old strike.
With 65,000 ballots counted, about 80 percent of the
anticipated total, the three-year agreement was approved by
about a 56 percent majority, sources reported.
UMW President Arnold Miller scheduled a news
conference in Washington this morning to announce the
results. And Miller and coal industry officials planned to
formally sign the agreement immediately following his
announcement, according to industry officials.
With ratification, most UMW members would be
expected to return to work in mines producing 70 percent
of the nation's soft coal on the shift beginning at 12:01
a.m. Monday.
Study Urges Massive Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON A three-year congressional study
recommends ending most public welfare programs, J
including food stamps, in favor of tax credits, new
subsistence allowances and work incentives.
The study, released yesterday by Rep. Martha W. ;
Griffiths (D-Mich.), also calls for an end to state control of
welfare programs in favor of a federally administered
system that would be run by the Internal Revenue Service.
"Let's junk the whole thing; it's impossible," Griffiths
said at a news conference at which the new proposal was
released. She said she will introduce a bill today for the new
system.
At the same time, the Agriculture Department
announced proposed new regulations to force poor people
to spend more for food stamps.
Under the plan, families would pay 30 percent of their
net monthly income beginning next March 1 to receive
food stamps. Currently, the cost averages about 23 percent.
Nixon Offered Aides $200,000-Plus
WASHINGTON Former President Richard M. Nixon
offered to make $200,000 or $300,000 available to H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman for legal and family
expenses when they were leaving the White House, the
Watergate cover-up jury was told yesterday.
"No strain," Nixon said on a tape first made public

yesterday. The money "doesn't come outta me."
Assistant Prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste disclosed the
offer and asked whether the money would somehow be
"provided by persons who were given favored treatment
over the years."
"I can recall a general conversation like that," Haldeman
said.
The former President's physical condition is
improving but he suffers from a slight case of pneumonia in
his right lung, his surgeon said yesterday.
Dr. Eldon B. Hickman visited Nixon at his seaside villa
after the former president underwent a series of x-rays at
the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base dispensary nearby.
Asian Jet Crash Kills 191 Pilgrims
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka A chartered Dutch jetliner
carrying nearly 200 Indonesian Moslems on a pilgrimage to
Mecca crashed and burned last night on a rocky hilltop 70
miles southeast of Colombo. Police said all aboard
apparently were killed.
Martinair, the Dutch charter line that was operating the
DCB, said there were 182 passengers and a crew of nine
aboard. The flight originated in Surabaya, Indonesia.
Senate Panel Releases Roeky Report
WASHINGTON The Senate Rules Committee declared
yesterday that its probe of Vice President-designate Nelson
A. Rockefeller turned up "no bar or impediment which
would disqualify him" even though he displayed poor
judgment at times.
The committee already had voted 9-0 on Nov. 22 to
recommend full Senate approval next Tuesday, but its
formal report nonetheless raised several questions it said
should be considered before the final tally.
The greatest of all, it said, is the implication raised "in
the potential wedding of great wealth and business interests
with great political power, the totality of which has been
unmatched."
Education Civil Rights To End?
WASHINGTON The House voted yesterday to block
the federal government from collecting race and sex
statistics in education. Opponents said this would end the
enforcement of 20 years' worth of civil rights laws if also
approved by the Senate and President Ford.
The action, approved by the 212-176 vote, would
prevent schools getting federal money from being
compelled to classify teachers or students by race, religion,
sex or national origin or to assign teachers or students to
schools on those bases.
Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), wrote conferees
Monday that he interpreted the move as ending HEW's
authority to enforce civil rights laws.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with variable clouds today. Increasing clouds
tonight with chance of rain tomorrow. A little warmer
days. Lows in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow mid 50s
to lower 60s. Winds becoming northwesterly 5 to 15 mph
today.

Education Civil Rights To End?
WASHINGTON The House voted yesterday to block
the federal government from collecting race and sex
statistics in education. Opponents said this would end the
enforcement of 20 years' worth of civil rights laws if also
approved by the Senate and President Ford.
The action, approved by the 212-176 vote, would
prevent schools getting federal money from being
compelled to classify teachers or students by race, religion,
sex or national origin or to assign teachers or students to
schools on those bases.
Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), wrote conferees
Monday that he interpreted the move as ending HEW's
authority to enforce civil rights laws.
Today's Weather

Coal Miners Vole To End Strike >
CHARLESTON, W.Va. The United Mine Workers
union has ratified a new contract for 120,000 coal miners,
unofficial returns showed yesterday, paving the way for an
end of a three-week-old strike.
With 65,000 ballots counted, about 80 percent of the
anticipated total, the three-year agreement was approved by
about a 56 percent majority, sources reported.
UMW President Arnold Miller scheduled a news
conference in Washington this morning to announce the
results. And Miller and coal industry officials planned to
formally sign the agreement immediately following his
announcement, according to industry officials.
With ratification, most UMW members would be
expected to return to work in mines producing 70 percent
of the nation's soft coal on the shift beginning at 12:01
a.m. Monday.
Study Urges Massive Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON A three-year congressional study
recommends ending most public welfare programs, J
including food stamps, in favor of tax credits, new
subsistence allowances and work incentives.
The study, released yesterday by Rep. Martha W. ;
Griffiths (D-Mich.), also calls for an end to state control of
welfare programs in favor of a federally administered
system that would be run by the Internal Revenue Service.
"Let's junk the whole thing; it's impossible," Griffiths
said at a news conference at which the new proposal was
released. She said she will introduce a bill today for the new
system.
At the same time, the Agriculture Department
announced proposed new regulations to force poor people
to spend more for food stamps.
Under the plan, families would pay 30 percent of their
net monthly income beginning next March 1 to receive
food stamps. Currently, the cost averages about 23 percent.
Nixon Offered Aides $200,000-Plus
WASHINGTON Former President Richard M. Nixon
offered to make $200,000 or $300,000 available to H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman for legal and family
expenses when they were leaving the White House, the
Watergate cover-up jury was told yesterday.
"No strain," Nixon said on a tape first made public

yesterday. The money "doesn't come outta me."
Assistant Prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste disclosed the
offer and asked whether the money would somehow be
"provided by persons who were given favored treatment
over the years."
"I can recall a general conversation like that," Haldeman
said.
The former President's physical condition is
improving but he suffers from a slight case of pneumonia in
his right lung, his surgeon said yesterday.
Dr. Eldon B. Hickman visited Nixon at his seaside villa
after the former president underwent a series of x-rays at
the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base dispensary nearby.

Senate Panel Releases Roeky Report
WASHINGTON The Senate Rules Committee declared
yesterday that its probe of Vice President-designate Nelson
A. Rockefeller turned up "no bar or impediment which
would disqualify him" even though he displayed poor
judgment at times.
The committee already had voted 9-0 on Nov. 22 to
recommend full Senate approval next Tuesday, but its
formal report nonetheless raised several questions it said
should be considered before the final tally.
The greatest of all, it said, is the implication raised "in
the potential wedding of great wealth and business interests
with great political power, the totality of which has been
unmatched."
Education Civil Rights To End?
WASHINGTON The House voted yesterday to block
the federal government from collecting race and sex
statistics in education. Opponents said this would end the
enforcement of 20 years' worth of civil rights laws if also
approved by the Senate and President Ford.
The action, approved by the 212-176 vote, would
prevent schools getting federal money from being
compelled to classify teachers or students by race, religion,
sex or national origin or to assign teachers or students to
schools on those bases.
Caspar W. Weinberger, Secretary of the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), wrote conferees
Monday that he interpreted the move as ending HEW's
authority to enforce civil rights laws.

Coal Miners Vole To End Strike >
CHARLESTON, W.Va. The United Mine Workers
union has ratified a new contract for 120,000 coal miners,
unofficial returns showed yesterday, paving the way for an
end of a three-week-old strike.
With 65,000 ballots counted, about 80 percent of the
anticipated total, the three-year agreement was approved by
about a 56 percent majority, sources reported.
UMW President Arnold Miller scheduled a news
conference in Washington this morning to announce the
results. And Miller and coal industry officials planned to
formally sign the agreement immediately following his
announcement, according to industry officials.
With ratification, most UMW members would be
expected to return to work in mines producing 70 percent
of the nation's soft coal on the shift beginning at 12:01
a.m. Monday.
Study Urges Massive Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON A three-year congressional study
recommends ending most public welfare programs, J
including food stamps, in favor of tax credits, new
subsistence allowances and work incentives.
The study, released yesterday by Rep. Martha W. ;
Griffiths (D-Mich.), also calls for an end to state control of
welfare programs in favor of a federally administered
system that would be run by the Internal Revenue Service.
"Let's junk the whole thing; it's impossible," Griffiths
said at a news conference at which the new proposal was
released. She said she will introduce a bill today for the new
system.
At the same time, the Agriculture Department
announced proposed new regulations to force poor people
to spend more for food stamps.
Under the plan, families would pay 30 percent of their
net monthly income beginning next March 1 to receive
food stamps. Currently, the cost averages about 23 percent.
Nixon Offered Aides $200,000-Plus
WASHINGTON Former President Richard M. Nixon

Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman for legal and family
expenses when they were leaving the White House, the
Watergate cover-up jury was told yesterday.
"No strain," Nixon said on a tape first made public

yesterday. The money "doesn't come outta me."

offer and asked whether the money would somehow be
"provided by persons who were given favored treatment
over the years."

said.
