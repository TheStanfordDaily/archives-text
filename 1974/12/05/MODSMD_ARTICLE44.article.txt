# Radical Group Supports Liberation Of All People
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The "Principles of Unity" of the
Alliance for Radical Change (ARC)
state: "We support the liberation of all
peoples at home and abroad.
Therefore, we oppose all
manifestations of racism, sexism and
imperialism. To this end, we will work
cooperatively on programs of political
education and action."
These may sound like broad, lofty
goals, but the members of ARC, a
radical student group which formed
here in September, believe there are
numerous issues related to Stanford
whicb fit within those principles.
"It's not really difficult to look
around and find things which
demonstrate American imperialism
and which also show how Stanford is

tied to that imperialism," according to
ARC member Chris Gray, a junior.
"Issues just fall into our lap."
Protest Marine Recruiting
ARC's first public effort at finding
an issue which students here could
relate to was its demonstration against
Marine Corps recruiting at the
Placement Center in October.
Although the group only has about 40
active members, 150 persons took part
in the demonstration.
While ARC member Dianne
Doggett, a senior, thinks "we got a
good turn-out at the Marine
demonstration," she says "the group
as a whole takes it for granted that
students are apathetic. We just have to
take small strides toward educating
people and teaching them what's going

on," she adds.
Next quarter, ARC hopes to take
such strides in two principle areas:
continued efforts to bring South
Vietnamese journalist Ngyuen Huu
Thai here as an ASSU guest professor
and opposition to a Communication
Department contract to provide
research for a communications satellite
for Iran.
'Subtle' Issues
Doggett admits that "the issues
we're dealing with now are a little
more subtle than the Vietnam War
was. These are things that your good
left-liberals can't really got into," she
says. Issues such as the Iranian
research contract are "just a little less
blatant to the student body as a
whole" than were the major "causes"
of the 60s, Doggett adds.
Consequently, she says ARC is
"trying to make students aware of
some of the injustices they are
suffering, like tuition hikes and
housing." Gray says some ARC
members were among those who
campaigned against the Big Game
Bonfire last month. "We're trying to
pick issues that students can relate to
and that we can build some
momentum behind," Doggett says.
ARC member Jim Regan, who also
heads the Committee to Bring Thai to
Stanford, says the group is seeking to
"tread the line between being labeled a
radical clique out on the fringe on the
one hand, and avoiding political ideas
as we see them, even though they may
not be well received at first."
On-Going Organization
According to Doggett, the idea for
ARC "came out during the [United
Stanford Employees] strike last
spring. Students who worked on the
strike and members of the Committee
to Invite Thai to Stanford decided that
there should be an on-going
organization, rather than having
people get together from time to time
for one project or another."
Regan says ARC members
"expected a slow, critical and
sometimes apathetic response.
"It was kind of a pleasant surprise
at the beginning of the quarter when
we got started to see that there were
so many students willing to commit
themselves on a regular basis to the
sort of radical education which hasn't
gone on here for several years," Regan
remarks.

ARC will have "a good base to
work from next quarter," according to
Regan. In addition to the efforts in
Thai's behalf and in opposition to the
Communication Department contract,
ARC expects to sponsor a film series.
"The purposes of the series,"
Doggett says, "would be to raise
money and to help educate people,"
ARC members, John Levitt and Cindy
Elliott, a junior, will also teach an
undergraduate special, "An
Introduction to Marxism."
