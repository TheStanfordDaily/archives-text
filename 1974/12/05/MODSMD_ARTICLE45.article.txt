# Energy Study Institute Coordinates Research
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
When students remaining
1 on-campus for Christmas break
grudgingly move into temporary
housing, their thoughts doubtlessly will
turn to the cause of the
inconvenience: the energy crisis.
Since fall of 1973, the Institute for
Energy Studies (lES) has been trying
to find ways to deal with that crisis.
Housed inconspicuously near the
Old Union, the Institute coordinates
energy research and teaching here.
Although lES does fund many projects
on campus, the actual research and
teaching is carried on by the regular
departments.
'Same Blocking'
"The Institute will do some
blocking. But it's not the quarterback
and doesn't carry the ball," explained
William Reynolds, professor of
mechanical engineering and chairman
ofIES.
Projects sponsored by lES cover the
range of energy problems, from
technical research in energy sources to
the social problems of energy policy,
and involve about 70 faculty members,
Reynolds said.
lES plans to expand in the future,
Reynolds claimed. Just last Monday,
the Institute opened an Energy
Information Center as a clearinghouse
to assist faculty, students and the
public in energy research.
Collecting Reports
According to Librarian Marian
Ross, the Institute is collecting
industry reports, energy conference
proceedings and research reports.
"Videotapes of all Symposia that are
sponsored by the Institute" will be

included eventually, Ross advised.
Most of the technical projects
funded by lES emphasize practical
solutions to energy problems.
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy directs one such program,
utilizing coal-mining robots.
Garbage As Energy?
Another project, on using urban
wastes as an energy source, is being
carried on for Santa Clara County.
Reynolds said that Pacific Gas and
Electric Company "is very interested"
in the idea.
lES is involved heavily in
non-research activities. It sponsors a
fellowship program, which is largely
funded by Standard Oil of California.
It also holds workshops. This year,
energy policy and social considerations
are being explored in two of the
workshops.
A Visiting Professor Program is
being used to bring speakers for these
workshops from across the country, an
alternative to actually sponsoring new
faculty positions. It is "a resource to
bring some exciting people in for a day
or two," Reynolds said.
Financial Aid
Financial support comes primarily
from gifts of energy-oriented
corporations, such as Standard Oil and
General Electric. In fact, they are "the
only ones who have been asked to
support the institute" as part of the
Campaign for Stanford, Reynolds
remarked.
Asked whether support from firms
with a vested interest in energy policy
might prejudice research findings, he
replied, "It hasn't so far." The
corporations "are making unrestricted
gifts in most cases," he added.
