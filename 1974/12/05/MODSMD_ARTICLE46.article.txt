# Olivo-Magnolia's Value Questioned
## Theme House Success Debated 
### PETER WINIK 
Most residents of the Olivo-Magnolia Black Cultural
Center, the theme house which was moved from Roble Hall
to Lagunita Court this quarter, agree with the student who
says, "It was a positive move, but I still think things can get
better."
In a statement issued last March, residents of the black
theme house said the Roble Hall facility had "failed to
meet the needs of black students."
They charged, "The black theme house is no more than a
concentration of black students living in conflict with a 70
percent white majority. The house is too large to function
as a theme house, and, moveover, it is filled with white
students who have little or no interest in black culture. . ."
Adverse Conditions
The size of Roble (about 300 students), the white
majority in the house and the resentment of white students
placed in the house were three conditions black students
sought to overcome when they negotiated with the
University last Spring for a new theme house.
Most black students wanted an independent house which
would be 100 percent black, while the University offered a
Wilbur house and an even racial balance.
A compromise was eventually reached which moved the
theme house to smaller Olivo-Magnolia, established an equal
ratio of blacks to whites and asked freshmen in a letter to
specify whether they wished to participate in the program.
According to Dave Moyer, an Olivo-Magnolia student
house associate, "The response to the letter was highly
favorable."
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Clayton Bates and his wife
Priscilla, the resident fellows at Roble last year, are now the
resident fellows for Lagunita's East Court. Both feel these
changes have improved the program.
"The smaller house has made a difference .. . the
tensions are reduced from last year," Mr. Bates says.

The Bates' have been holding small breakfast sessions for
both black and white freshmen this quarter. "In general,
both black and white freshmen find it reasonably
comfortable here," says Mrs. Bates.
And student House Associate Charles Ogletree adds,
"The incoming freshmen enjoy the atmosphere in
Olivo-Magnolia more than in Roble."
Not all freshmen share the staff's optimism, however.
One white freshman says "there is definite hostility in the
dorm . . . it's not obvious hostility, it's subtle." She adds,
"There is such a consciousness of color here."
'Sad' Activities
"The activities of the dorm are kind of sad," she says,
because "there are too many all-black activities." A letter
sent to freshmen last summer indicated that "everyone
would be involved in the house activities, but this just isn't
so," she says.
Another white freshman who feels "separatism" in the
house says, "The basis of the separatism is unconscious, and
I think the barriers are beginning to break down." He agrees
there are too many "all-black activities," and suggests
"more discussions about people fighting racism."
White upperclassmen have voiced discontent as well. One
sophomore complains, "The blacks are very peer-minded
.. . people co-exist in the dorm, but it's not real friendly.
"The BSU has had more parties than the dorm," he adds,
saying he resents the amount of "black study sessions,
black intramurals, black pre-law and pre-med societies .. .
and general all-black events.
Doesn't Understand
"I don't really understand the purpose of the theme
house," he concludes. "If it is to get blacks together, then it
works. If it is to get blacks and white together, than it
doesn't work as well as it could."
One black sophomore says, "I've had po problems
getting along with other students," although she admits
