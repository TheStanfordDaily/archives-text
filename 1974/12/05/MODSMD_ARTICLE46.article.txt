# Olivo-Magnolia's Value Questioned
## Theme House Success Debated 
### PETER WINIK 
Most residents of the Olivo-Magnolia Black Cultural
Center, the theme house which was moved from Roble Hall
to Lagunita Court this quarter, agree with the student who
says, "It was a positive move, but I still think things can get
better."
In a statement issued last March, residents of the black
theme house said the Roble Hall facility had "failed to
meet the needs of black students."
They charged, "The black theme house is no more than a
concentration of black students living in conflict with a 70
percent white majority. The house is too large to function
as a theme house, and, moveover, it is filled with white
students who have little or no interest in black culture. . ."
Adverse Conditions
The size of Roble (about 300 students), the white
majority in the house and the resentment of white students
placed in the house were three conditions black students
sought to overcome when they negotiated with the
University last Spring for a new theme house.
Most black students wanted an independent house which
would be 100 percent black, while the University offered a
Wilbur house and an even racial balance.
A compromise was eventually reached which moved the
theme house to smaller Olivo-Magnolia, established an equal
ratio of blacks to whites and asked freshmen in a letter to
specify whether they wished to participate in the program.
According to Dave Moyer, an Olivo-Magnolia student
house associate, "The response to the letter was highly
favorable."
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Clayton Bates and his wife
Priscilla, the resident fellows at Roble last year, are now the
resident fellows for Lagunita's East Court. Both feel these
changes have improved the program.
"The smaller house has made a difference .. . the
tensions are reduced from last year," Mr. Bates says.

The Bates' have been holding small breakfast sessions for
both black and white freshmen this quarter. "In general,
both black and white freshmen find it reasonably
comfortable here," says Mrs. Bates.
And student House Associate Charles Ogletree adds,
"The incoming freshmen enjoy the atmosphere in
Olivo-Magnolia more than in Roble."
Not all freshmen share the staff's optimism, however.
One white freshman says "there is definite hostility in the
dorm . . . it's not obvious hostility, it's subtle." She adds,
"There is such a consciousness of color here."
'Sad' Activities
"The activities of the dorm are kind of sad," she says,
because "there are too many all-black activities." A letter
sent to freshmen last summer indicated that "everyone
would be involved in the house activities, but this just isn't
so," she says.
Another white freshman who feels "separatism" in the
house says, "The basis of the separatism is unconscious, and
I think the barriers are beginning to break down." He agrees
there are too many "all-black activities," and suggests
"more discussions about people fighting racism."
White upperclassmen have voiced discontent as well. One
sophomore complains, "The blacks are very peer-minded
.. . people co-exist in the dorm, but it's not real friendly.
"The BSU has had more parties than the dorm," he adds,
saying he resents the amount of "black study sessions,
black intramurals, black pre-law and pre-med societies .. .
and general all-black events.
Doesn't Understand
"I don't really understand the purpose of the theme
house," he concludes. "If it is to get blacks together, then it
works. If it is to get blacks and white together, than it
doesn't work as well as it could."
One black sophomore says, "I've had po problems
getting along with other students," although she admits
"the relationship with whites is more of a
co-existence, rather than mixing."
A sophomore who lived in Roble last year is more
positive. "The black-white relationship has changed
this year, it's a healthier air." She adds that
"Olivo-Magnolia is not like last year, where people
were thrown together.. . People talk to one
another, and not just to say 'hello.' "
'lnfinitely Better'
Another former Roble resident says,
"Olivo-Magnolia is infinitely better than last year
. .. this year there's community and closeness."
While he recognizes there are racial divisions, he
describes them as "not conscious, but rather
divisions along interests."
In keeping with the purpose of the Black Cultural
Center, Olivo-Magnolia has sponsored a lecture
series dealing with topical black issues. Seminars and
concerts also have been held.
While Ogletree says "there is no such thing as a
black activity per se," one student describes
attendance of whites at such programs as "next to
nil." Mrs. Bates admits that "white attendance of
black cultural programs has not been what we
would like."
"I don't know if we can do any more to
encourage white attendance," says Mr. Bates. "It
just take the white students a while, or they might
not be interested at all."
Dining Segregation
Racial patterns are also evident in Lagunita's
dining hall. Many tables are either all-black or
all-white. One white freshman says, "I can't go into
the dining room and feel comfortable."
A black resident explains, "You like to be relaxed
when you eat, and I'm more relaxed when I'm with

black people."
Mrs. Bates says the black grouping in the dining
hall "is not unusual or unnatural. It is what they
would do in their own homes." And Ogletree feels
the dining-room division is overemphasized, saying
"Olivo-Magnolia is not an experiment in
integration."
East Vs. West
Lagunita's West Court is predominantly white,
and is separated from the East Court. Some West
Court residents say two particular events have
alienated them from the theme house. One involved
a highly publicized BSU party in the Lagunita
dining hall, which attracted an estimated 800
blacks, many from off campus. The other involved
an altercation in the dining hall, in which a white
checker was punched by a black resident.
The BSU party has provoked more controversy
than any other event. After the party, thefts were
reported in all Lagunita houses, except
Olivo-Magnolia. Naranja, the hardest hit, reported
four robberies. All the Naranja thefts allegedly
occurred with persons in the rooms, with the
students claiming they were threatened in each case.
In Granada, the house fellow was reportedly
shoved aside as he attempted to restrain two blacks
who were thought to have been involved in a
previous robbery attempt.
Harassment, Thefts
University police said they received numerous
calls from Lagunita students the night of the party,
complaining of harassment and thefts by blacks.
Margaret Owens, an Olivo-Magnolia student house
associate, feels much of the problem is that "white
people are not used to having a lot of black people
around."
West Court Resident Fellow Martin Bresnick

agrees with Owens, saying "There is white racism in
Lagunita as well as black racism .. .The West Court
has white students who have never had contact with
blacks." TT _
Independent House?
Most of the black residents feel the cultural
center can be improved. Some students would
prefer the theme house to be in an independent
house, rather than be part of a dormitory.
One girl, reflecting this feeling, says "the house is
not really what the students asked for. She would
like the residents to have more control over meals,
furnishings, and would like to have "more artwork
reflecting black culture."
"I don't think a lot of Lagunita residents
understand the black theme house,' another
student adds. "They look at it as a lot of blacks in
Olivo-Magnolia." He, too, would prefer the theme
house to be an independent house.
Other Suggestions
Other students have suggestions to improve
Olivo-Magnolia this year. "I would like, once or
twice a month, to have an African meal prepared,"
one girl suggests.
"We have encouraged the students to plan their
own activities," says Mrs. Bates. "I hope to see more
cultural activities in the future."
While the staff of the theme house is pleased with
the results this quarter, they say the house has still
greater potential. The four student house associates
of Olivo-Magnolia recently distributed a letter to the
residents, encouraging greater student participation.
"The seriousness of group participation cannot be
overemphasized, but just as important is that each
student take the initiative to plan an activity so that
the cultural center will grow and include more
interests from those involved," they stated.

The BSU party has provoked more controversy
than any other event. After the party, thefts were
reported in all Lagunita houses, except
Olivo-Magnolia. Naranja, the hardest hit, reported
four robberies. All the Naranja thefts allegedly
occurred with persons in the rooms, with the
students claiming they were threatened in each case.
In Granada, the house fellow was reportedly
shoved aside as he attempted to restrain two blacks
who were thought to have been involved in a
previous robbery attempt.
Harassment, Thefts
University police said they received numerous
calls from Lagunita students the night of the party,
complaining of harassment and thefts by blacks.
Margaret Owens, an Olivo-Magnolia student house
associate, feels much of the problem is that "white
people are not used to having a lot of black people
around."
West Court Resident Fellow Martin Bresnick

agrees with Owens, saying "There is white racism in
Lagunita as well as black racism .. .The West Court
has white students who have never had contact with
blacks." TT _
Independent House?
Most of the black residents feel the cultural
center can be improved. Some students would
prefer the theme house to be in an independent
house, rather than be part of a dormitory.
One girl, reflecting this feeling, says "the house is
not really what the students asked for. She would
like the residents to have more control over meals,
furnishings, and would like to have "more artwork
reflecting black culture."
"I don't think a lot of Lagunita residents
understand the black theme house,' another
student adds. "They look at it as a lot of blacks in
Olivo-Magnolia." He, too, would prefer the theme
house to be an independent house.
Other Suggestions
Other students have suggestions to improve
Olivo-Magnolia this year. "I would like, once or
twice a month, to have an African meal prepared,"
one girl suggests.
"We have encouraged the students to plan their
own activities," says Mrs. Bates. "I hope to see more
cultural activities in the future."
While the staff of the theme house is pleased with
the results this quarter, they say the house has still
greater potential. The four student house associates
of Olivo-Magnolia recently distributed a letter to the
residents, encouraging greater student participation.
"The seriousness of group participation cannot be
overemphasized, but just as important is that each
student take the initiative to plan an activity so that
the cultural center will grow and include more
interests from those involved," they stated.

CRAFTY PEOPLE Tresidder Union is sponsoring its third annual Christmas
Crafts Faire from today through Sunday. The faire is open from 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. daily. Over 70 craftspeople will have their crafts on exhibition. Jesters,
jugglers and wandering minstrels will be circulating to add to the yuletide aura.
Most residents of the Olivo-Magnolia Black Cultural
Center, the theme house which was moved from Roble Hall
to Lagunita Court this quarter, agree with the student who
says, "It was a positive move, but I still think things can get
better."
In a statement issued last March, residents of the black
theme house said the Roble Hall facility had "failed to
meet the needs of black students."
They charged, "The black theme house is no more than a
concentration of black students living in conflict with a 70
percent white majority. The house is too large to function
as a theme house, and, moveover, it is filled with white
students who have little or no interest in black culture. . ."
Adverse Conditions
The size of Roble (about 300 students), the white
majority in the house and the resentment of white students
placed in the house were three conditions black students
sought to overcome when they negotiated with the
University last Spring for a new theme house.
Most black students wanted an independent house which
would be 100 percent black, while the University offered a
Wilbur house and an even racial balance.
A compromise was eventually reached which moved the
theme house to smaller Olivo-Magnolia, established an equal
ratio of blacks to whites and asked freshmen in a letter to
specify whether they wished to participate in the program.
According to Dave Moyer, an Olivo-Magnolia student
house associate, "The response to the letter was highly
favorable."
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Clayton Bates and his wife
Priscilla, the resident fellows at Roble last year, are now the
resident fellows for Lagunita's East Court. Both feel these
changes have improved the program.
"The smaller house has made a difference .. . the
tensions are reduced from last year," Mr. Bates says.

The Bates' have been holding small breakfast sessions for
both black and white freshmen this quarter. "In general,
both black and white freshmen find it reasonably
comfortable here," says Mrs. Bates.
And student House Associate Charles Ogletree adds,
"The incoming freshmen enjoy the atmosphere in
Olivo-Magnolia more than in Roble."
Not all freshmen share the staff's optimism, however.
One white freshman says "there is definite hostility in the
dorm . . . it's not obvious hostility, it's subtle." She adds,
"There is such a consciousness of color here."
'Sad' Activities
"The activities of the dorm are kind of sad," she says,
because "there are too many all-black activities." A letter
sent to freshmen last summer indicated that "everyone
would be involved in the house activities, but this just isn't
so," she says.
Another white freshman who feels "separatism" in the
house says, "The basis of the separatism is unconscious, and
I think the barriers are beginning to break down." He agrees
there are too many "all-black activities," and suggests
"more discussions about people fighting racism."
White upperclassmen have voiced discontent as well. One
sophomore complains, "The blacks are very peer-minded
.. . people co-exist in the dorm, but it's not real friendly.
"The BSU has had more parties than the dorm," he adds,
saying he resents the amount of "black study sessions,
black intramurals, black pre-law and pre-med societies .. .
and general all-black events.
Doesn't Understand
"I don't really understand the purpose of the theme
house," he concludes. "If it is to get blacks together, then it
works. If it is to get blacks and white together, than it
doesn't work as well as it could."
One black sophomore says, "I've had po problems
getting along with other students," although she admits
"the relationship with whites is more of a
co-existence, rather than mixing."
A sophomore who lived in Roble last year is more
positive. "The black-white relationship has changed
this year, it's a healthier air." She adds that
"Olivo-Magnolia is not like last year, where people
were thrown together.. . People talk to one
another, and not just to say 'hello.' "
'lnfinitely Better'
Another former Roble resident says,
"Olivo-Magnolia is infinitely better than last year
. .. this year there's community and closeness."
While he recognizes there are racial divisions, he
describes them as "not conscious, but rather
divisions along interests."
In keeping with the purpose of the Black Cultural
Center, Olivo-Magnolia has sponsored a lecture
series dealing with topical black issues. Seminars and
concerts also have been held.
While Ogletree says "there is no such thing as a
black activity per se," one student describes
attendance of whites at such programs as "next to
nil." Mrs. Bates admits that "white attendance of
black cultural programs has not been what we
would like."
"I don't know if we can do any more to
encourage white attendance," says Mr. Bates. "It
just take the white students a while, or they might
not be interested at all."
Dining Segregation
Racial patterns are also evident in Lagunita's
dining hall. Many tables are either all-black or
all-white. One white freshman says, "I can't go into
the dining room and feel comfortable."
A black resident explains, "You like to be relaxed
when you eat, and I'm more relaxed when I'm with

black people."
Mrs. Bates says the black grouping in the dining
hall "is not unusual or unnatural. It is what they
would do in their own homes." And Ogletree feels
the dining-room division is overemphasized, saying
"Olivo-Magnolia is not an experiment in
integration."
East Vs. West
Lagunita's West Court is predominantly white,
and is separated from the East Court. Some West
Court residents say two particular events have
alienated them from the theme house. One involved
a highly publicized BSU party in the Lagunita
dining hall, which attracted an estimated 800
blacks, many from off campus. The other involved
an altercation in the dining hall, in which a white
checker was punched by a black resident.
The BSU party has provoked more controversy
than any other event. After the party, thefts were
reported in all Lagunita houses, except
Olivo-Magnolia. Naranja, the hardest hit, reported
four robberies. All the Naranja thefts allegedly
occurred with persons in the rooms, with the
students claiming they were threatened in each case.
In Granada, the house fellow was reportedly

and general all-black events.
Doesn't Understand
"I don't really understand the purpose of the theme
house," he concludes. "If it is to get blacks together, then it
works. If it is to get blacks and white together, than it
doesn't work as well as it could."
One black sophomore says, "I've had po problems
getting along with other students," although she admits
"the relationship with whites is more of a
co-existence, rather than mixing."
A sophomore who lived in Roble last year is more
positive. "The black-white relationship has changed
this year, it's a healthier air." She adds that
"Olivo-Magnolia is not like last year, where people
were thrown together.. . People talk to one
another, and not just to say 'hello.' "
'lnfinitely Better'
Another former Roble resident says,
"Olivo-Magnolia is infinitely better than last year
. .. this year there's community and closeness."
While he recognizes there are racial divisions, he
describes them as "not conscious, but rather
divisions along interests."
In keeping with the purpose of the Black Cultural
Center, Olivo-Magnolia has sponsored a lecture
series dealing with topical black issues. Seminars and
concerts also have been held.
While Ogletree says "there is no such thing as a
black activity per se," one student describes
attendance of whites at such programs as "next to
nil." Mrs. Bates admits that "white attendance of
black cultural programs has not been what we
would like."
"I don't know if we can do any more to
encourage white attendance," says Mr. Bates. "It
just take the white students a while, or they might
not be interested at all."
Dining Segregation
Racial patterns are also evident in Lagunita's
dining hall. Many tables are either all-black or
all-white. One white freshman says, "I can't go into
the dining room and feel comfortable."
A black resident explains, "You like to be relaxed
when you eat, and I'm more relaxed when I'm with

black people."
Mrs. Bates says the black grouping in the dining
hall "is not unusual or unnatural. It is what they
would do in their own homes." And Ogletree feels
the dining-room division is overemphasized, saying
"Olivo-Magnolia is not an experiment in
integration."
East Vs. West
Lagunita's West Court is predominantly white,
and is separated from the East Court. Some West
Court residents say two particular events have
alienated them from the theme house. One involved
a highly publicized BSU party in the Lagunita
dining hall, which attracted an estimated 800
blacks, many from off campus. The other involved
an altercation in the dining hall, in which a white
checker was punched by a black resident.
The BSU party has provoked more controversy
than any other event. After the party, thefts were
reported in all Lagunita houses, except
Olivo-Magnolia. Naranja, the hardest hit, reported
four robberies. All the Naranja thefts allegedly
occurred with persons in the rooms, with the
students claiming they were threatened in each case.
In Granada, the house fellow was reportedly
shoved aside as he attempted to restrain two blacks
who were thought to have been involved in a
previous robbery attempt.
Harassment, Thefts
University police said they received numerous
calls from Lagunita students the night of the party,
complaining of harassment and thefts by blacks.
Margaret Owens, an Olivo-Magnolia student house
associate, feels much of the problem is that "white
people are not used to having a lot of black people
around."
West Court Resident Fellow Martin Bresnick

agrees with Owens, saying "There is white racism in
Lagunita as well as black racism .. .The West Court
has white students who have never had contact with
blacks." TT _
Independent House?
Most of the black residents feel the cultural
center can be improved. Some students would
prefer the theme house to be in an independent
house, rather than be part of a dormitory.
One girl, reflecting this feeling, says "the house is
not really what the students asked for. She would
like the residents to have more control over meals,
furnishings, and would like to have "more artwork
reflecting black culture."
"I don't think a lot of Lagunita residents
understand the black theme house,' another
student adds. "They look at it as a lot of blacks in
Olivo-Magnolia." He, too, would prefer the theme
house to be an independent house.
Other Suggestions
Other students have suggestions to improve
Olivo-Magnolia this year. "I would like, once or
twice a month, to have an African meal prepared,"
one girl suggests.
"We have encouraged the students to plan their
own activities," says Mrs. Bates. "I hope to see more
cultural activities in the future."
While the staff of the theme house is pleased with
the results this quarter, they say the house has still
greater potential. The four student house associates
of Olivo-Magnolia recently distributed a letter to the
residents, encouraging greater student participation.
"The seriousness of group participation cannot be
overemphasized, but just as important is that each
student take the initiative to plan an activity so that
the cultural center will grow and include more
interests from those involved," they stated.

CRAFTY PEOPLE Tresidder Union is sponsoring its third annual Christmas
Crafts Faire from today through Sunday. The faire is open from 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. daily. Over 70 craftspeople will have their crafts on exhibition. Jesters,
jugglers and wandering minstrels will be circulating to add to the yuletide aura.
Most residents of the Olivo-Magnolia Black Cultural
Center, the theme house which was moved from Roble Hall
to Lagunita Court this quarter, agree with the student who
says, "It was a positive move, but I still think things can get
better."
In a statement issued last March, residents of the black
theme house said the Roble Hall facility had "failed to
meet the needs of black students."
They charged, "The black theme house is no more than a
concentration of black students living in conflict with a 70
percent white majority. The house is too large to function
as a theme house, and, moveover, it is filled with white
students who have little or no interest in black culture. . ."
Adverse Conditions
The size of Roble (about 300 students), the white
majority in the house and the resentment of white students
placed in the house were three conditions black students
sought to overcome when they negotiated with the
University last Spring for a new theme house.
Most black students wanted an independent house which
would be 100 percent black, while the University offered a
Wilbur house and an even racial balance.
A compromise was eventually reached which moved the
theme house to smaller Olivo-Magnolia, established an equal
ratio of blacks to whites and asked freshmen in a letter to
specify whether they wished to participate in the program.
According to Dave Moyer, an Olivo-Magnolia student
house associate, "The response to the letter was highly
favorable."
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Clayton Bates and his wife
Priscilla, the resident fellows at Roble last year, are now the
resident fellows for Lagunita's East Court. Both feel these
changes have improved the program.
"The smaller house has made a difference .. . the
tensions are reduced from last year," Mr. Bates says.

The Bates' have been holding small breakfast sessions for
both black and white freshmen this quarter. "In general,
both black and white freshmen find it reasonably
comfortable here," says Mrs. Bates.
And student House Associate Charles Ogletree adds,
"The incoming freshmen enjoy the atmosphere in
Olivo-Magnolia more than in Roble."
Not all freshmen share the staff's optimism, however.
One white freshman says "there is definite hostility in the
dorm . . . it's not obvious hostility, it's subtle." She adds,
"There is such a consciousness of color here."
'Sad' Activities
"The activities of the dorm are kind of sad," she says,
because "there are too many all-black activities." A letter
sent to freshmen last summer indicated that "everyone
would be involved in the house activities, but this just isn't
so," she says.
Another white freshman who feels "separatism" in the
house says, "The basis of the separatism is unconscious, and
I think the barriers are beginning to break down." He agrees
there are too many "all-black activities," and suggests
"more discussions about people fighting racism."
White upperclassmen have voiced discontent as well. One
sophomore complains, "The blacks are very peer-minded
.. . people co-exist in the dorm, but it's not real friendly.
"The BSU has had more parties than the dorm," he adds,
saying he resents the amount of "black study sessions,
black intramurals, black pre-law and pre-med societies .. .
and general all-black events.

"I don't really understand the purpose of the theme

"Olivo-Magnolia is not like last year, where people

"Olivo-Magnolia is infinitely better than last year
. .. this year there's community and closeness."

describes them as "not conscious, but rather

In keeping with the purpose of the Black Cultural

meet the needs of black students."
They charged, "The black theme house is no more than a
concentration of black students living in conflict with a 70
percent white majority. The house is too large to function
as a theme house, and, moveover, it is filled with white
students who have little or no interest in black culture. . ."
Adverse Conditions
The size of Roble (about 300 students), the white
majority in the house and the resentment of white students
placed in the house were three conditions black students
sought to overcome when they negotiated with the
University last Spring for a new theme house.
Most black students wanted an independent house which
would be 100 percent black, while the University offered a
Wilbur house and an even racial balance.
A compromise was eventually reached which moved the
theme house to smaller Olivo-Magnolia, established an equal
ratio of blacks to whites and asked freshmen in a letter to
specify whether they wished to participate in the program.
According to Dave Moyer, an Olivo-Magnolia student
house associate, "The response to the letter was highly
favorable."
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Clayton Bates and his wife
Priscilla, the resident fellows at Roble last year, are now the
resident fellows for Lagunita's East Court. Both feel these
changes have improved the program.
"The smaller house has made a difference .. . the
tensions are reduced from last year," Mr. Bates says.

The Bates' have been holding small breakfast sessions for
both black and white freshmen this quarter. "In general,
both black and white freshmen find it reasonably
comfortable here," says Mrs. Bates.
And student House Associate Charles Ogletree adds,
"The incoming freshmen enjoy the atmosphere in
Olivo-Magnolia more than in Roble."
Not all freshmen share the staff's optimism, however.
One white freshman says "there is definite hostility in the
dorm . . . it's not obvious hostility, it's subtle." She adds,
"There is such a consciousness of color here."
'Sad' Activities
"The activities of the dorm are kind of sad," she says,
because "there are too many all-black activities." A letter
sent to freshmen last summer indicated that "everyone
would be involved in the house activities, but this just isn't
so," she says.
Another white freshman who feels "separatism" in the
house says, "The basis of the separatism is unconscious, and
I think the barriers are beginning to break down." He agrees
there are too many "all-black activities," and suggests
"more discussions about people fighting racism."
White upperclassmen have voiced discontent as well. One
sophomore complains, "The blacks are very peer-minded
.. . people co-exist in the dorm, but it's not real friendly.
"The BSU has had more parties than the dorm," he adds,
saying he resents the amount of "black study sessions,
black intramurals, black pre-law and pre-med societies .. .
and general all-black events.
Doesn't Understand
"I don't really understand the purpose of the theme
house," he concludes. "If it is to get blacks together, then it
works. If it is to get blacks and white together, than it
doesn't work as well as it could."
One black sophomore says, "I've had po problems
getting along with other students," although she admits
"the relationship with whites is more of a
co-existence, rather than mixing."
A sophomore who lived in Roble last year is more
positive. "The black-white relationship has changed
this year, it's a healthier air." She adds that
"Olivo-Magnolia is not like last year, where people
were thrown together.. . People talk to one
another, and not just to say 'hello.' "
'lnfinitely Better'
Another former Roble resident says,
"Olivo-Magnolia is infinitely better than last year
. .. this year there's community and closeness."
While he recognizes there are racial divisions, he
describes them as "not conscious, but rather
divisions along interests."
In keeping with the purpose of the Black Cultural
Center, Olivo-Magnolia has sponsored a lecture
series dealing with topical black issues. Seminars and
concerts also have been held.
While Ogletree says "there is no such thing as a
black activity per se," one student describes
attendance of whites at such programs as "next to
nil." Mrs. Bates admits that "white attendance of
black cultural programs has not been what we
would like."
"I don't know if we can do any more to
encourage white attendance," says Mr. Bates. "It
just take the white students a while, or they might
not be interested at all."
Dining Segregation
Racial patterns are also evident in Lagunita's
dining hall. Many tables are either all-black or
all-white. One white freshman says, "I can't go into
the dining room and feel comfortable."
A black resident explains, "You like to be relaxed
when you eat, and I'm more relaxed when I'm with

black people."
Mrs. Bates says the black grouping in the dining
hall "is not unusual or unnatural. It is what they
would do in their own homes." And Ogletree feels
the dining-room division is overemphasized, saying
"Olivo-Magnolia is not an experiment in
integration."
East Vs. West
Lagunita's West Court is predominantly white,
and is separated from the East Court. Some West
Court residents say two particular events have
alienated them from the theme house. One involved
a highly publicized BSU party in the Lagunita
dining hall, which attracted an estimated 800
blacks, many from off campus. The other involved
an altercation in the dining hall, in which a white
checker was punched by a black resident.
The BSU party has provoked more controversy
than any other event. After the party, thefts were
reported in all Lagunita houses, except
Olivo-Magnolia. Naranja, the hardest hit, reported
four robberies. All the Naranja thefts allegedly
occurred with persons in the rooms, with the
students claiming they were threatened in each case.
In Granada, the house fellow was reportedly
shoved aside as he attempted to restrain two blacks
who were thought to have been involved in a
previous robbery attempt.
Harassment, Thefts
University police said they received numerous
calls from Lagunita students the night of the party,
complaining of harassment and thefts by blacks.
Margaret Owens, an Olivo-Magnolia student house
associate, feels much of the problem is that "white
people are not used to having a lot of black people
around."
West Court Resident Fellow Martin Bresnick

agrees with Owens, saying "There is white racism in
Lagunita as well as black racism .. .The West Court
has white students who have never had contact with
blacks." TT _
Independent House?
Most of the black residents feel the cultural
center can be improved. Some students would
prefer the theme house to be in an independent
house, rather than be part of a dormitory.
One girl, reflecting this feeling, says "the house is
not really what the students asked for. She would
like the residents to have more control over meals,
furnishings, and would like to have "more artwork
reflecting black culture."
"I don't think a lot of Lagunita residents
understand the black theme house,' another
student adds. "They look at it as a lot of blacks in
Olivo-Magnolia." He, too, would prefer the theme
house to be an independent house.
Other Suggestions
Other students have suggestions to improve
Olivo-Magnolia this year. "I would like, once or
twice a month, to have an African meal prepared,"
one girl suggests.
"We have encouraged the students to plan their
own activities," says Mrs. Bates. "I hope to see more
cultural activities in the future."
While the staff of the theme house is pleased with
the results this quarter, they say the house has still
greater potential. The four student house associates
of Olivo-Magnolia recently distributed a letter to the
residents, encouraging greater student participation.
"The seriousness of group participation cannot be
overemphasized, but just as important is that each
student take the initiative to plan an activity so that
the cultural center will grow and include more
interests from those involved," they stated.

shoved aside as he attempted to restrain two blacks
who were thought to have been involved in a
previous robbery attempt.
Harassment, Thefts
University police said they received numerous
calls from Lagunita students the night of the party,
complaining of harassment and thefts by blacks.
Margaret Owens, an Olivo-Magnolia student house
associate, feels much of the problem is that "white
people are not used to having a lot of black people
around."
West Court Resident Fellow Martin Bresnick

agrees with Owens, saying "There is white racism in
Lagunita as well as black racism .. .The West Court
has white students who have never had contact with
blacks." TT _
Independent House?
Most of the black residents feel the cultural
center can be improved. Some students would
prefer the theme house to be in an independent
house, rather than be part of a dormitory.
One girl, reflecting this feeling, says "the house is
not really what the students asked for. She would
like the residents to have more control over meals,
furnishings, and would like to have "more artwork
reflecting black culture."
"I don't think a lot of Lagunita residents
understand the black theme house,' another
student adds. "They look at it as a lot of blacks in
Olivo-Magnolia." He, too, would prefer the theme
house to be an independent house.
Other Suggestions
Other students have suggestions to improve
Olivo-Magnolia this year. "I would like, once or
twice a month, to have an African meal prepared,"
one girl suggests.
"We have encouraged the students to plan their
own activities," says Mrs. Bates. "I hope to see more
cultural activities in the future."
While the staff of the theme house is pleased with
the results this quarter, they say the house has still
greater potential. The four student house associates
of Olivo-Magnolia recently distributed a letter to the
residents, encouraging greater student participation.
"The seriousness of group participation cannot be
overemphasized, but just as important is that each
student take the initiative to plan an activity so that
the cultural center will grow and include more
interests from those involved," they stated.
