# Library Expands Services
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The Main Library late last month
completed a complicated expansion of
its overcrowded card catalog, and
distributed last May a four-volume
preliminary listing for all periodicals in
the library system. Future
simplification of these two services
may involve computerization or a
similar process.
The more expensive of the two
projects was the four-volume Stanford
Union List of Serials (SULS). Listing
52,000 titles when it was published
last May, SULS cost "roughly"s7s,ooo
to produce, estimated Allen B. Veaner,
assistant director of University
libraries.
$20,000 Cabinets
Lawrence E. Leonard, chief
librarian, said he didn't know what the
total costs of expanding the card
catalog were, but estimated that the
new cabinets cost about $20,000.
The new plastic drawers are "lighter
weight and easier to handle" observed
Charlotte Mercado, assistant chief
librarian. Expansion was necessary, she
noted, because the old drawers were
overcrowded.
The catalog was last expanded in
1968, when 13 new cabinets with 72
drawers each were added. About 2.9
million cards were moved at the time.

Eighteen 90-drawer cabinets were
added this time, and about four
million cards were moved.
Microfilm Filing?
The lastest expansion "should last
five years," said Leonard. When the
new cabinets fill up again (about 900
new cards are added every day), the
library may switch to a new filing
system such as microfilm, Leonard
said.
Another possibility, said Veaner, is
a switch to computer terminals. Within
two weeks, the library is planning to
set out two terminals which will help
library users to locate books or
reference materials in the Stanford
libraries.
"The terminals are here," said
Veaner, so it is just a "matter of
installment."
'Public Service'
SULS was "set up mainly as a
public service," said Tina Kass, former
SULS editor.
Taking two years to complete
(from August 1972 to May 1974),
SULS was originally intended to
include all University libraries plus the
six "coordinate" libraries (Food
Research Institute, The Library of the
Hoover Institution, J. Hugh Jackson
Library Graduate School of
Business, Law Library, Lane Medical

Library, Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center).
However, only Lane and SLAC
collections are entirely included in the
preliminary volume. Updates from the
other coordinate libraries are being
sent in, said Kass, and will be included
if another volume is printed.
Out-Of-Date
SULS "always is out-of-date," she
said, but added that its main purpose
had been "to provide information to
places far away from serial records."
By enabling copies of the serial
listings to be placed in every branch
library, SULS "greatly accelerates
communications" between the library
and its users, Veaner said. It also
decreases the number of phone calls to
the serials records desk, freeing
employees to work on updating.
It will be used as a "management
tool" to identify duplicate
subscriptions and also as a "review
tool" to "decide on non-duplicated
subscriptions that could be canceled,"
said Veaner.
Veaner made a "rough guess" that
operational costs, for SULS will run
"below $lO,OOO a year" or about 20
cents per title listed.
The University libraries are
"perhaps the last major research
library to make available" a
all-inclusive list of serials, Veaner said.
Lagged Behind
The University lagged behind partly
because it was fully occupied with the
BALLOTS computer system, which
keeps track of books and journals
recently obtained and on order.
Also, from observing the libraries
that had produced a serial list, "we
knew that computerizing information
about journals is very difficult, and
thought we needed more experience
first," Veaner said.
"It is anticipated that there will be
updates to the SULS on an annual
basis," Leonard commented, adding it
is a "matter of budgetary
consideration whether the list will be
put out annually or not.
According to Kass, updates to
SULS may some day be made through
SPIRE, a data-gathering program
which can compile data, hold it, then
destroy it when the data is combined
witl? the master file. This would
eliminate "a lot of manual procedure,"
said Kass.
