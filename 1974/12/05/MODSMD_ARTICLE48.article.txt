# Djerassi Foresees No Breakthroughs
## Male Birth Control Pill Far Off 
### DAVID SMITH 
Even if concerted research were
begun immediately, it would take at
least 15 years to develop a widely
marketable male oral contraceptive,
according to Chemistry Prof. Carl
Djerassi, who directed the synthesis of
the first femlae oral contraceptive in
the 19505.
"There's very little going on in this
field, and the laws and regulations
controlling research on contraceptives
are severely limiting the possibility of
marketing any new contraceptive of
any kind," Djerassi told a Memorial
Auditorium audience Tuesday night.
"There's not a ghost of a chance
that any male contraceptive methods
presently being researched will be on
the market in three to five years, and

probably not in the 1980s," he added.
"All of them have possibly serious side
effects like enlargement of the breasts
and cardiovascular difficulties."
Abortion's Impact
Djerassi said he believes that
improved abortion techniques would
have a much wider-reaching effect on
population control in less-developed
nations than research on
contraceptives would.
"It is almost a universal law of
nature that abortion is a curative
medicine and contraception is a
preventative medicine," he stated. "It
takes a certain amount of
sophistication to know that you
should use preventative medicines
abortion is the back-out procedure,
and that's what people will turn to
first."

Djerassi, who served recently as
president of the Syntex Corporation, a
pharmaceutical firm, noted that
several new abortion methods,
including implantation of large doses
of hormones and use of chemical
aborting agents, are presently being
investigated. None will be available to
the public until at least 1985, he
explained.
"I don't think that clinical research
on chemical abortion will ever even be
permitted, because that would demand
that the aborting agent be 100 percent
effective," he said. "Even if a fraction
of a percent of the experiments didn't
work, there would be malformed
babies bom, and no one would
tolerate that."
No Baby Boom
Pointing out that the birth rate in
some parts of China has dropped 75
percent since 1963, Djerassi said that
"enormous changes in social attitudes"
in the countries with the worst
population problems will be the only
means of achieving any progress in the
struggle to control population.
"In the next 10 years there will be
nothing new in male contraceptives,
and no real progress in female
devices," Djerassi remarked. "All we
can count on is political and social
motivations working with the
contraceptive hardware we already
have."
Djerassi further contended that
using hormones to control insect
growth and reproduction promises the
best way of increasing the world's
available food supply.
Synthetic Hormones
"F rom an environmental

standpoint, synthetic insect hormones
are the perfect means of controlling
pests because they affect insects and
nothing else," he noted.
"By simply controlling the insects
that devour the food resources we
already have, we could feed an extra
one billion people every year," he
added. "But now development of new
insecticides is left to industry, and
right now they have no incentive at all
to make them.
"Some of these new, very specific
synthetic hormones will be available
next year or the year after, but we
have to realize that unless we give the
farmers some bonus payments to use
them, they won't gain any financial
advantage from them and they won't
use them," he said.

No Baby Boom
Pointing out that the birth rate in
some parts of China has dropped 75
percent since 1963, Djerassi said that
"enormous changes in social attitudes"
in the countries with the worst
population problems will be the only
means of achieving any progress in the
struggle to control population.
"In the next 10 years there will be
nothing new in male contraceptives,
and no real progress in female
devices," Djerassi remarked. "All we
can count on is political and social
motivations working with the
contraceptive hardware we already
have."
Djerassi further contended that
using hormones to control insect
growth and reproduction promises the
best way of increasing the world's
available food supply.
Synthetic Hormones
"F rom an environmental

standpoint, synthetic insect hormones
are the perfect means of controlling
pests because they affect insects and
nothing else," he noted.
"By simply controlling the insects
that devour the food resources we
already have, we could feed an extra
one billion people every year," he
added. "But now development of new
insecticides is left to industry, and
right now they have no incentive at all
to make them.
"Some of these new, very specific
synthetic hormones will be available
next year or the year after, but we
have to realize that unless we give the
farmers some bonus payments to use
them, they won't gain any financial
advantage from them and they won't
use them," he said.

UP TO WOMEN—Prof. Carl Djerassi told a Memorial Auditorium crowd Tuesday
night that a marketable male oral contraceptive is at least 15 years away. Djerassi
also said that he believed that improved abortion techniques would have a large
effect on population control.
Even if concerted research were
begun immediately, it would take at
least 15 years to develop a widely
marketable male oral contraceptive,
according to Chemistry Prof. Carl
Djerassi, who directed the synthesis of
the first femlae oral contraceptive in
the 19505.
"There's very little going on in this
field, and the laws and regulations
controlling research on contraceptives
are severely limiting the possibility of
marketing any new contraceptive of
any kind," Djerassi told a Memorial
Auditorium audience Tuesday night.
"There's not a ghost of a chance
that any male contraceptive methods
presently being researched will be on
the market in three to five years, and

probably not in the 1980s," he added.
"All of them have possibly serious side
effects like enlargement of the breasts
and cardiovascular difficulties."
Abortion's Impact
Djerassi said he believes that
improved abortion techniques would
have a much wider-reaching effect on
population control in less-developed
nations than research on
contraceptives would.
"It is almost a universal law of
nature that abortion is a curative
medicine and contraception is a
preventative medicine," he stated. "It
takes a certain amount of
sophistication to know that you
should use preventative medicines
abortion is the back-out procedure,
and that's what people will turn to
first."

Djerassi, who served recently as
president of the Syntex Corporation, a
pharmaceutical firm, noted that
several new abortion methods,
including implantation of large doses
of hormones and use of chemical
aborting agents, are presently being
investigated. None will be available to
the public until at least 1985, he
explained.
"I don't think that clinical research
on chemical abortion will ever even be
permitted, because that would demand
that the aborting agent be 100 percent
effective," he said. "Even if a fraction
of a percent of the experiments didn't
work, there would be malformed
babies bom, and no one would
tolerate that."
No Baby Boom
Pointing out that the birth rate in
some parts of China has dropped 75
