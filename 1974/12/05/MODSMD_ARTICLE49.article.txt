## The 						World Of Cinema Movie Not A Real Cut-Up 
### George Powell 
"You're in luck when you've
got a McCulloch chain saw." Or so
is said in the TV commercial.
However, you're no in luck if you
have the misfortune to see The
Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which
is a misconceived attempt to do
for chain saws what Jim Bowie
did for bowie knives.
Actually, the chain saw is
merely a gimmick, and the movie
isn't about chain saws so much as
it is about cannibalism, a subject
that was treated with more finesse
(if movies about such subjects can
have finesse) in The Folks At Red
Wolf Inn. (Ever eat a pickled
finger? Many joints are quite
tasty!)
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,
contrary to published reports,
isn't the bloodiest movie ever
made, or the grossest, although it
may be one of the worst when
talent, aesthetics and production
values are taken into account.
What gave the film such
notoriety in the first place was its
showing as a sneak preview before
people who didn't know what
they were in for. Admittedly,
hanging girls on meat hooks is not
something most people think
about doing every day. But the
bits of violence take place mostly
off camera, although it is made
perfectly clear that heads are
being sawed off, along with legs,
arms and the film's credibility.
Ludicrous
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
is so ludicrous that it isn't even
scary. All the fright is generated
by the actress who plays Sally,
whose sole function in the film is
to be captured by this group of
insane cannibals who live
somewhere out in the scrubby
back land of west Texas. When
captured, or chased, Sally
screams, shreaks and yells mosf
convincingly. The sound track

plays weird music, and the camera
zooms in on close-ups of her eyes
as they roll around. Fully 20
minutes of the film is spent with
her being chased by a hulking
cretin with sputtering chain saw
who wears a leather mask and
does the butchery for the family.
First Leatherface clonks his
victims with a hammer (the
audience gets to see one twitch
around like a dead chicken) then
saws the bodies up with a chain
saw to make barbecue.
The most "sane" one of the
family, who runs a small store,
turns the sawed up human parts
into "tasty" barbecue, cooking
and basting them over a slow fire.
The third member of this family
likes to hitchhike around, steal
hands and feet from cadavers and
mutilate himself. Crazy enough?
Grandpa Too
But no one should forget
grandpa, a zombie-like old man
kept alive (barely) by a diet of
human flesh. This disgusting old
codger (who looks vaguely like
former Senator Carl Hayden of
Arizona) gets to suck blood from
captured Sally's finger in the most
graphically disgusting scene in the
whole movie.
Mercifully, The Texas Chain
Saw Massacre ends with Sally
escaping, although it's obvious
that she's totally mad. The cretin
Leatherface does a ballet for one
with chain saw against the setting
Texas sun as Sally makes her
getaway. Dumb and disgusting.
So the question remains, why
make movies like that in the first
place? The gothic and ghoulish
have always had a place in
American cinema, but to be
genuinely frightening, such films
have to be done with some
finesse, have a competent script
and believable performances. The
Texas Chain Saw Massacre has

none of these, benefitting solely
from the publicity generated at a
sneak preview before an
unsuspecting and cinematically
unsophisticated audience.
If people in that audience ever
had seen Dark of the Sun, in
which Rod Taylor fights a brutal
duel with some beefy German
actor, first with chain saws, and
then with fists, or even Last
House On the Left, which has the
avenging father chain-sawing up
the bad men, the use of chain
saws in The Texas Chain Saw
Massacre would have seemed
forced and gimmicky, rather than
horrible.
A banal line of dialogue from
the movie sums up its essential
sappiness best. Sally (not
screaming) says, "Everything
means something ... I guess." If
that dialogue makes you want to
hear more, may your ears be the
victim of a chain saw massacre.

that can belt out a good blues number. Since his early days,
Musselwhite has been playing with the top performers.
"You're in luck when you've
got a McCulloch chain saw." Or so
is said in the TV commercial.
However, you're no in luck if you
have the misfortune to see The
Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which
is a misconceived attempt to do
for chain saws what Jim Bowie
did for bowie knives.
Actually, the chain saw is
merely a gimmick, and the movie
isn't about chain saws so much as
it is about cannibalism, a subject
that was treated with more finesse
(if movies about such subjects can
have finesse) in The Folks At Red
Wolf Inn. (Ever eat a pickled
finger? Many joints are quite
tasty!)
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,
contrary to published reports,
isn't the bloodiest movie ever
made, or the grossest, although it
may be one of the worst when
talent, aesthetics and production
values are taken into account.
What gave the film such
notoriety in the first place was its
showing as a sneak preview before
people who didn't know what
they were in for. Admittedly,
hanging girls on meat hooks is not
something most people think
about doing every day. But the
bits of violence take place mostly
off camera, although it is made
perfectly clear that heads are
being sawed off, along with legs,
arms and the film's credibility.
Ludicrous
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
is so ludicrous that it isn't even
scary. All the fright is generated
by the actress who plays Sally,
whose sole function in the film is
to be captured by this group of
insane cannibals who live
somewhere out in the scrubby
back land of west Texas. When
captured, or chased, Sally
screams, shreaks and yells mosf
convincingly. The sound track

plays weird music, and the camera
zooms in on close-ups of her eyes
as they roll around. Fully 20
minutes of the film is spent with
her being chased by a hulking
cretin with sputtering chain saw
who wears a leather mask and
does the butchery for the family.
First Leatherface clonks his
victims with a hammer (the
audience gets to see one twitch
around like a dead chicken) then
saws the bodies up with a chain
saw to make barbecue.
The most "sane" one of the
family, who runs a small store,
turns the sawed up human parts
into "tasty" barbecue, cooking
and basting them over a slow fire.
The third member of this family
likes to hitchhike around, steal
hands and feet from cadavers and
mutilate himself. Crazy enough?
Grandpa Too
But no one should forget
grandpa, a zombie-like old man
kept alive (barely) by a diet of
human flesh. This disgusting old
codger (who looks vaguely like
former Senator Carl Hayden of
Arizona) gets to suck blood from
captured Sally's finger in the most
graphically disgusting scene in the
whole movie.
Mercifully, The Texas Chain
Saw Massacre ends with Sally
escaping, although it's obvious
that she's totally mad. The cretin
Leatherface does a ballet for one
with chain saw against the setting
Texas sun as Sally makes her
getaway. Dumb and disgusting.
So the question remains, why
make movies like that in the first
place? The gothic and ghoulish
have always had a place in
American cinema, but to be
genuinely frightening, such films
have to be done with some
finesse, have a competent script
and believable performances. The
Texas Chain Saw Massacre has

none of these, benefitting solely
from the publicity generated at a
sneak preview before an
unsuspecting and cinematically
unsophisticated audience.
If people in that audience ever
had seen Dark of the Sun, in
which Rod Taylor fights a brutal
duel with some beefy German
actor, first with chain saws, and
then with fists, or even Last
House On the Left, which has the
avenging father chain-sawing up
the bad men, the use of chain
saws in The Texas Chain Saw
Massacre would have seemed
forced and gimmicky, rather than
horrible.
A banal line of dialogue from
the movie sums up its essential
sappiness best. Sally (not
screaming) says, "Everything
means something ... I guess." If
that dialogue makes you want to
hear more, may your ears be the
victim of a chain saw massacre.

"You're in luck when you've
got a McCulloch chain saw." Or so
is said in the TV commercial.
However, you're no in luck if you
have the misfortune to see The
Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which
is a misconceived attempt to do
for chain saws what Jim Bowie
did for bowie knives.
Actually, the chain saw is
merely a gimmick, and the movie
isn't about chain saws so much as
it is about cannibalism, a subject
that was treated with more finesse
(if movies about such subjects can
have finesse) in The Folks At Red
Wolf Inn. (Ever eat a pickled
finger? Many joints are quite
tasty!)
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,
contrary to published reports,
isn't the bloodiest movie ever
made, or the grossest, although it
may be one of the worst when
talent, aesthetics and production
values are taken into account.
What gave the film such
notoriety in the first place was its
showing as a sneak preview before
people who didn't know what
they were in for. Admittedly,
hanging girls on meat hooks is not
something most people think
about doing every day. But the
bits of violence take place mostly
off camera, although it is made
perfectly clear that heads are
being sawed off, along with legs,
arms and the film's credibility.
Ludicrous
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre
is so ludicrous that it isn't even
scary. All the fright is generated
by the actress who plays Sally,
whose sole function in the film is
to be captured by this group of
insane cannibals who live
somewhere out in the scrubby
back land of west Texas. When
captured, or chased, Sally
screams, shreaks and yells mosf
convincingly. The sound track

plays weird music, and the camera
zooms in on close-ups of her eyes
as they roll around. Fully 20
minutes of the film is spent with
her being chased by a hulking
cretin with sputtering chain saw
who wears a leather mask and
does the butchery for the family.
First Leatherface clonks his
victims with a hammer (the
audience gets to see one twitch
around like a dead chicken) then
saws the bodies up with a chain
saw to make barbecue.
The most "sane" one of the
family, who runs a small store,
turns the sawed up human parts
into "tasty" barbecue, cooking
and basting them over a slow fire.
The third member of this family
likes to hitchhike around, steal
hands and feet from cadavers and
mutilate himself. Crazy enough?
Grandpa Too
But no one should forget
grandpa, a zombie-like old man
kept alive (barely) by a diet of
human flesh. This disgusting old
codger (who looks vaguely like
former Senator Carl Hayden of
Arizona) gets to suck blood from
captured Sally's finger in the most
graphically disgusting scene in the
whole movie.
Mercifully, The Texas Chain
Saw Massacre ends with Sally
escaping, although it's obvious
that she's totally mad. The cretin
Leatherface does a ballet for one
with chain saw against the setting
Texas sun as Sally makes her
getaway. Dumb and disgusting.
So the question remains, why
make movies like that in the first
place? The gothic and ghoulish
have always had a place in
American cinema, but to be
genuinely frightening, such films
have to be done with some
finesse, have a competent script
and believable performances. The
Texas Chain Saw Massacre has

none of these, benefitting solely
from the publicity generated at a
sneak preview before an
unsuspecting and cinematically
unsophisticated audience.
If people in that audience ever
had seen Dark of the Sun, in
which Rod Taylor fights a brutal
duel with some beefy German
actor, first with chain saws, and
then with fists, or even Last
House On the Left, which has the
avenging father chain-sawing up
the bad men, the use of chain
saws in The Texas Chain Saw
Massacre would have seemed
forced and gimmicky, rather than
horrible.
A banal line of dialogue from
the movie sums up its essential
sappiness best. Sally (not
screaming) says, "Everything
means something ... I guess." If
that dialogue makes you want to
hear more, may your ears be the
victim of a chain saw massacre.
