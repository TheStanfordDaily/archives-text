# China's Higher Education Politicized, Lyman Says
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Higher education in the Peoples'
Republic of China is strongly
politicized and regarded with
suspicion, President Richard Lyman
commented last night. Lyman
returned from a 21-day tour of China
last Saturday.
Chinese universities are still reeling
from the effects of the sweeping
Cultural Revolution of the late 60s,
Lyman told 500 people in Tresidder
large lounge.
"The priorities of the Chinese
regime would hardly allow a major
investment in higher education, as the
term is understood in this country,"
Lyman said.
He noted a persistent fear that the
elitist scholar, removed from everyday
practical problems, tends to make

workers, peasants and soldiers lose
confidence in their own ability to
remake China.
Lyman observed the results of this
attitude when he toured Chinese
universities with 10 other American
college presidents, chancellors and
administrators. The 13-member
University President's Delegation,
sponsored by the National Committee
on U.S.-China Relations, also included
two China scholars and one
Chinese-speaking representative.
Run-Down Facilities
Members of the group noticed that
Chinese universities had run-down
facilities and small student enrollments
in relation to their faculties, Lyman
said.
The delegates also noted the
absence of graduate students at even
the most prestigious institutions, he
added.
"The efforts made on our behalf by
our Chinese hosts were remarkable,"
Lyman added. The group's experiences
ranged from a 3/4-hour meeting with
Vice-Premier Deng Hsiao-p'ing, China's
acting head of state, to visits with
peasants and workers in their homes.
"We found ourselves seated in a
bare room on tiny stools sipping hot
water our host was too poor to
provide tea," Lyman recalled.
On The Loose
He noted that Chinese officials did
not attempt to shield the delegation
from glimpses of poverty. But the
Chinese were reluctant to interrupt the
hectic schedule of tours and allow
delegates to wander the streets on
their own. Finally turned loose in the
heart of a major city, the
Western-looking delegates attracted
100-150 gawkers when they attempted
to make a purchase at a department
store, Lyman said.
"It is probably safe to say that just

about every person in this room, if put
in the position of living as a citizen of
the PRC, would feel to a stifling
degree what the late George Orwell
called 'Groupthink,' " Lyman told the
audience.
"Groupthink is away of life the
only way of life. Everything is based
upon it; glorification of the individual
in any way or in any context is
frowned upon," he added.
Pre-Conceived Notions
Lyman said he is aware that visitors
to China look for facts that fit
pre-conceived hypotheses.
"Does one take heart from the
massive cheerfulness and eagerness of
Chinese university students as they
greet you in their dormitories
buildings which are so .. . simple in
their appearance as to make Stern and
Wilbur seem more luxurious than the
Century Plaza hotel?" he asked.
Lyman's summary of his impression
of China was part of a roundtable
discussion with four faculty members
and one student who have recently
visited the People's Republic:
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi
Linguistics Prof. Charles Ferguson,
Law Prof. Victor Li, Nobel physics
laureate Robert Hofstadter and Karen
Croft, a junior majoring in psychology.
