# Ballet Company Gives Top Performance
## 
### CHRISTINE SHERRY 
When Martha Graham began
her magnificent performing career
in the 1920s and 1930s she was a
highly controversial figure.
Insisting* that dancing should be
neither pretty nor padded but
essentially real, she was criticized
for her obscurity and for her
contorted, angular movements.
Now, at age 80, Graham is
generally considered one of
America's most unique and
prolific artists, and her company's
Tuesday evening performance at
Memorial Auditorium to an
enthusiastic full house was a
tribute to her continual integrity
of artistic expression.
Diversion of Angels was
perhaps the evening's least
spectacular offering. A tribute to
the sorrows and joys of young
love, it was beautifully lyric but
lacked much diversity or depth.
Still, there were some captivating
images: loose legs in sideways
stretches, very nice solo work by

the red and ye, How couples,
beautiful costumes of brown and
beige tones.
A much more engrossing piece,
Night Journey, examined the
classical myth of Oedipus as
shaped from a woman's
viewpoint, for Graham chose
Jocasta as the central figure.
Powerful Portrayal
Exploring the complexities of
motive and deed, the work was
never over-theatrical nor a
singularly feminist statement but
a very powerful portrayal of
human relationships.
The emotions depicted in
Night Journey were typically
Graham clear but not simple,
with an intense dramatic flair.
And Diane Grey's dancing in the
role of Jocasta became almost
secondary to the ideas presented,
a tribute both to her gifts as a
performer and to Graham's skill
of symbolic creation.
Peggy Lyman as the leader of
the chorus was exceptionally

striking; the chorus on the whole
was quite strong, and only the
absolute lack of presence and
authority of Ross Parkes' Tiresias
marred the overall effect.
Early in her career Graham felt
a strong need for the American
dancer to find material in this
country, despite the fact that he
or she may dance elsewhere. A
10th generation American,
Graham was convinced that one
should not transplant foreign
dance forms here but must work
from America's own roots.
Appalachian Spring is a tribute
to the American pioneer spirit.
Now almost a period piece, it was
beautifully performed and
intensely moving.
Movements Perfect
The movements of each
character the vigor and
contentment in the young wife's
dancing, the undaunted pride of
the husband's leaps and the
revivalist's sharp staccato gestures
captured perfectly the essence

of the people's concerns and
relationships.
The darting hand movements
of the preachers' followers, the
assurance of Phyllis Gutelius as
the wife (a role Graham created)
and the beautiful, now famous
Aaron Copeland score were all
memorable.
Much of Graham's genius lies
in her awareness of the need for
unity in production. She
conceives each work entirely, with
every artistic element sculpture,
design, set, musical score, lighting
and costuming commissioned
especially for the piece.
Thus, dance truly becomes
dance-drama, a form of theater, a
media in which all the arts exist
on an equal level.
Fluid Theater
Moreover, Graham's form of
theater is extremely fluid. The
choreography is created with
special attention to the individual
dancer's capacities and talents,
and at the same time the dancer
brings his or her own ideas to the
work.
Graham's pieces are tightly
constructed down to the last
detail, but are open to constant
revision and growth.
On a most basic level it is
Graham's movement vocabulary
terse, tense, angular that gives
her creations their distinctive
force and appeal. Movement is
centered in the back, with the
flow of the head, arms and legs
acting passively in response to
that central impulse.
"Nothing is more revealing
than movement," Graham wrote
in 1935. "The motivation, the
cause of movement establishes a
center of gravity ... which
induces the co-ordination that is
body-spirit, and this spirit of body
is the state of innocence that is
the secret of the absolute dancer."
Awareness, Intent
Thus, each contraction and
release must necessarily be
accompanied by a mental
awareness and intent to be
artistically viable. A single
movement can at different times
express a variety of emotions,
from joy to pain to hatred, but
the performer must always believe
that "technique is but one integral
element necessary to the
formation of a dancer."
Graham's work reveals a
multitude of influences, from
classical mythology as in Night
Journey, to the theories and
writings of Eliot, Jung, Dante and
Rilke, to the Asian theater arts
(including Balinese and Javanese
dancing and Noh drama).
"I am a thief and I glory in it,"
Graham admitted freely in her
Notebooks, yet she is above all an
innovator.
