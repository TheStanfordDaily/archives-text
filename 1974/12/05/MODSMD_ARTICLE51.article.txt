# Music Hallâ€™s Live Performances
## Audience Applauds Silence 
### KAREN CAESAR 
"!" shouted Robert Shields and Lorene Yarnell
to the audience as they leaped forward to receive
their standing ovation.
They don't use words; they don't need them.
They are mimes of the highest caliber, and their
recent appearance at the Stanford Music Hall
brought enough class to this community to last for
the next 10 years.
The various emotions they can express through
their bodies are phenomenal. They do not prance
when they are relating joy, they float. And whether
it is anger, fear or whatever, their movements
convey it quicker than words ever could.
"When you are doing mime, to believe is the
whole thing," stresses Robert. Throughout their
grueling schedule and in spite of their self-discipline
in rehearsing their repetoire of 30 sketches, they
keep believing, and consequently, so do their
audiences. That is quite a feat considering that "to
perfect a sketch it takes a solid month working
every day," according to Robert. Yet they are
animated and ambitious, and although they travel
extensively, they want to come back to the Music
Hall almost as much as they want to perform in
. China.
Their show at the Music Hall consisted of 10
perfectly choreographed titled sketches, each one
eliciting an enthusiastic response from the
audience.
Highlights
The highlights pf the performance included an
episode entitled "Evolution," where both Robert
and Lorene assumed ape-like postures and moved
so fluidly and so naturally it seemed like they had
observed monkeys at zoos for the past year and a
half.
In "Escape," the monkey posture was assumed
again as Robert took the role of a caged gorilla,
nervously scratching himself and loping around a
not-too-expansive cage. Straining, he finally bends
the bars and steps into the real world. One second
later, he is back in his cage after bending the bars
back, content with his world, scared of the outside.

The symbolic possibilities are limitless.
The finale was called "Life." It traced the stages
of life from screaming babyhood to old, old age.
Robert and Lorene are together throughout.
Finally, she dies; a moment later, so does he. It was
done so movingly that the audience was genuinely
touched.

Although the entire program had humor, the
comic highlight was "The Biker." In this sketch,
Robert Shields is absolutely incredible in showing
the pseudo-tough, overly hostile motorcycle man of
the fifties at his most obnoxious. Swaggering across
the stage, picking fights and mouthing maledictions
at everything in sight, including the stage curtain,
the floor, the audience, etc., he is reminiscent of
the young Marlon Brando.

There is humor in his movements, in his whole
tough-guy portrayal, such as when the biker gets on
his motorcycle and adjusts himself to the stingray
handlebars that are three feet above his seat, or
when he starts zipping the ten thousand zippers
going in every direction on his imaginary uniform
of bikers everywhere.

"Bikers are just children with big heavy clothes
on," said Robert Shields after the show. He gets
most of his ideas from observing people.
Surprisingly, he has had no professional training in
ballet, and is only just beginning to study
gymnastics. "I received a lot of training in the
street, doing improvisations all the time, every day.
Kids used to pick on me because I was small; that's
sort of where I got the idea for 'The Biker.' "
Lorene Yarn ell has received more training than
her husband, having studied tap and flamenco in
addition to performing with Broadway
choreographer Peter Genero. She met her husband
on 9 TV show in Los Angeles, and they have been
together ever since.
"I didn't talk till I was five," Robert remarked.
He is 23 now; that's 18 years he has
been talking. But when one has a gift such as the
one Robert Shields and Lorene Yarnell share, there
is no need for talk, so as far as the audience is
concerned, they will never have to say a word.
