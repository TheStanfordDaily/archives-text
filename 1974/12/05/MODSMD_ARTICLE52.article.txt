# How Blue Can You Get?
## Mussel white Sings The Black Blues 
### Dan Forte 
REDWOOD CITY - I doubt if
I will ever tire of listening to
bluesman Charlie Musselwhite.
This contention has been
reconfirmed every time I've seen
him perform, as it was a while
back at the Rhinocerous.

When I first began discovering
the blues record market in around
1967, I heard an album entitled
Stand Back! Here Comes Charlie
Musselwhite's South Side Band
and was certain that the husky
voice shouting the lyrics belonged
to a veteran black who'd been on
the scene for some time.

When I later related my
keenly erroneous first impression
to Charlie, he sat for a time, very
thoughtfully and replied a simple
"Thank you."
If it weren't for album cover
photos and the fact that Charlie
later moved to the Bay Area
where he still performs, steadily, I
might still picture him as black.
He sounds black.
Bluesmen At Stanford
Last winter quarter while
teaching a course on blues history,
I brought bluesmen to perform
for the class on three separate

occasions; pianist Dave Alexander,
guitarist Chic Streetman (both
black) and harmonica player
Musselwhite.
Musically, all three were
"blues," encompassing three
entirely different styles within
that idiom, but Charlie was the
bluesiest.
In a Newsweek article devoted
completely to the
black-white-blues debate, Charlie
stated his position emphatically,
saying, "I was weaned on the
blues."
As a teenager growing up in
Memphis, Tennessee during the
late 19505, playing blues was as
natural to Charlie as playing
Country & Western or rockabilly
was to his high school friends.
No TV
Charlie's family couldn't afford
a TV set, but they did have a
radio. At that time in Memphis,
the listener had a choice of one of
three types of stations; C&W, Pop
and Black. Charlie listened to all
three, but preferred the latter.
In high school, going to
Memphis Tech, Charlie was by no
means an outcast, but he was
definitely a bit of an oddity. "I
wasn't part of that rigamarole that
was 'high school life.' Sometimes
they'd ask me to come and play
with them, but I couldn't make it
'cos I had something better to do
I thought. To this day I still agree
with myself."
While still in high school,
Charlie spent one summer
working on a construction crew
for $1 an hour, the only white
kid on an all-black crew.
Same Pattern
That has, basically, been the
pattern of Charlie's life ever since,
color-wise and, to a degree,
money-wise also. (The story of
him getting paid a grand total of
38 cents for the aforementioned
Stand Back! is a testimonial to the
latter.)
Charlie's first encounter with
real bluesmen in Memphis came as
the result of a conscious effort.
After reading Sam Charters' The
Country Blues, Charlie sought out
the retired members of the
Memphis Jug Band and Cannon's
Jug Stompers, still living in town.
(It was Charters, by the way, who
produced that first recording
session for Vanguard.)
But, after moving to Chicago at
18, Charlie's initial contact with
the blues scene was purely by
accident.
He found himself living in the
only area he could afford, the
South Side black ghetto, where
the blues was all around.
Harmonica
Here Charlie switched from
guitar (which he learned in
Memphis) to harmonica and
became a regular musician, again
in all-black bands.
Although his first LP (recorded
with Harvey Mandel and Barry
Goldberg) was a financial disaster,
it did bring Charlie to the West
Coast for a gig at the Fillmore
Auditorium.
He probably would've gone
straight back to Chicago, but the
money ran out before the
engagement did, forcing him to
stay. "We got $l,OOO for a week.
We had five guys, so that was 200
bucks each.' That's not really that
much when you think about it."
I first caught Charlie shortly
after his South Side Sound
System had broken up, with a
pick-up group in a Hayward union
hall.
Great 'Pick-Ups"
That group of "pick-ups"
included Dave Alexander

(mentioned above), bassist Jack
Myers and guitarist Luther
Tucker, three of the greatest
respective talents in blues!
The next time I saw him
perform was in 1971 at Keystone
Korner when his band included:
pianist Skip Rose, bassist Gerald
Bederson, drummer Pat Ford, and
his brother Robben on guitar
currently sweeping across the
country as part of the George
Harrison tour.
At 2 a.m., after a 20 minute
instrumental called "Chicken
Shack," the audience filed out,
the waitresses cleared off the
tables, and the band packed up
their gear. That is all but Charlie
and Skip.
Small Crowd Left
With an audience of two
(myself and my brother), Charlie
sat at a table against the side wall,
his microphone cord stretching up
to his amplifier on the stage.
Backed only by Rose's
beautiful piano, Charlie blew a
version of Duke Pearson's
sorrowful "Cristo Redentor"
which I will never forget. If you
can imagine an instrumental sad
enough to literally make you cry,
"Cristo" is it. (Charlie has
recorded the tune twice on
Stand Back! and Tennessee
Woman, both on Vanguard.)
His Rhinocerous gig included
guitarist Tucker, and both he and
Charlie were at their usual finest.

Of Tucker, Charlie says, "I'd
say the best for backin' me up out
of all the guys I've had would be
Tucker in one way and Robben
Ford in another way. They both
have really different styles, but
their timing and tone is good, and
that's what I think is most
important in blues."

It would be impossible for me
to summarize any one
Musselwhite concert as a single
entity. He's always good and can,
on occasion, be truly outstanding.
To my way of thinking,
whether they're black or white,
they don't come any bluer.
