# Black History Week Marked By Shows
## 
### 
In January, Stanford's
Committee on Black Performing
Arts, under the chairmanship of
John H. Cochran, will present its
faculty and students in an
historical and entertaining
commemoration of Black History
Week. The focus of the
Committee's events will be the
historical contributions made to
the areas of music and dance.
Drama, as a part of the program,
takes on a more contemporary
perspective.
Black History Week at
Stanford is unique for two
reasons: first, it is a month long
celebration; secondly, it is one
month earlier than national
commemorative events.
Eric Isralow, also known as Dr.
Rock 'n' Roll, will offer an
entertaining history of rock.
Highlighted by pieces from a band
and dances from the various
musical eras he presents, Isralow's
presentation will begin in the

Fifties, and the course of his show
will bring the audience to the
Seventies. Isralow, who is a
nationally known authority on
rock, served as the music
consultant to the ' Committee's
summer rock 'n' roll musical,
Remember When ... He currently
teaches a course in rock at
Stanford, and can be heard
weekly on KZSU. Isralow's show
will be presented in the Little
Theatre Jan. 10, 11, 12 at 8 p.m.
Jim Shields offers the second
musical presentation. Shields and
his students have planned a
program of contemporary music
to showcase what some black
musicians at Stanford are
currently writing and playing. It is
a show which will permit the
audience some exchange and
discussion with the players on the
influences, techniques and genesis
of ideas affecting their music.
Shield's Contributions
As music director for the
Committee on Black Performing
Arts, Shields has contributed
greatly to the last two
productions, Remember
When . . ~ and Purlie. He comes to
the Committee with a wealth of
talent, ranging from opera to
Motown's Detroit soul. Shields
and his students will perform in
the Little Theatre Jan. 17, 18,19
at 8 p.m.
The Evolution of Black Dance,
says choreographer Halifu (Janis
Miller), demonstrates how "the
dance of black people has
coincided with the moods of each
historical period from Africa
until today." The Evolution will
make history come alive for each
individual as the audience involves
itself in the dance, music and
rhythms that are such vital forces
among black people.
The presentation takes the
audience from the ritual harvest
dances of Africa, to the joyous
festival dances of Brazil, to slavery
court dances, to the minstrel and
vaudeville period, to concert jazz
dances and the latest soul steps.
Previous Chores
Since her return from her
recent tour on three continents,
Halifu has choreographed two
shows for the Committee
(Remember When . . . and Purlie),
and several productions of her
own. Halifu's presentation will be
performed Jan. 25, 26 at 8 p.m.
also in the Little Theatre.
The audience experiences more
recent history with the
Committee's production of the
comedy, Five On The Black Hand
Side, Jan. 16, 17, 18, 19 and 23,
24, 25, 26 at 8 p.m. in the Nitery.
Directed by John Cochran, the
play focuses on events that are
currently making history: the
women's liberation movement,
black militancy in its mildest
forms, the perennial problems
between father and son and
husband and Wife. Its
contemporary humor and almost
corny resolve have appeal almost
as broad as middle America.

Director Cochran, who is also
Chairman of the Committee on
Black Performing Arts, says of
this show and the others
presented during the Black
History celebration that they are
enlightening and entertaining
lessons in history. Surely the
audiences will consider the
programs the piost painless
history lessons they ever attended.

Week. The focus of the

Black History Week at
Stanford is unique for two
reasons: first, it is a month long
celebration; secondly, it is one
month earlier than national
commemorative events.
Eric Isralow, also known as Dr.
Rock 'n' Roll, will offer an
entertaining history of rock.
Highlighted by pieces from a band
and dances from the various
musical eras he presents, Isralow's
presentation will begin in the

Fifties, and the course of his show
will bring the audience to the
Seventies. Isralow, who is a
nationally known authority on
rock, served as the music
consultant to the ' Committee's
summer rock 'n' roll musical,
Remember When ... He currently
teaches a course in rock at
Stanford, and can be heard
weekly on KZSU. Isralow's show
will be presented in the Little
Theatre Jan. 10, 11, 12 at 8 p.m.
Jim Shields offers the second
musical presentation. Shields and
his students have planned a
program of contemporary music
to showcase what some black
musicians at Stanford are
currently writing and playing. It is
a show which will permit the
audience some exchange and
discussion with the players on the
influences, techniques and genesis
of ideas affecting their music.
Shield's Contributions
As music director for the
Committee on Black Performing
Arts, Shields has contributed
greatly to the last two
productions, Remember
When . . ~ and Purlie. He comes to
the Committee with a wealth of
talent, ranging from opera to
Motown's Detroit soul. Shields
and his students will perform in
the Little Theatre Jan. 17, 18,19
at 8 p.m.
The Evolution of Black Dance,
says choreographer Halifu (Janis
Miller), demonstrates how "the
dance of black people has
coincided with the moods of each
historical period from Africa
until today." The Evolution will
make history come alive for each
individual as the audience involves
itself in the dance, music and
rhythms that are such vital forces
among black people.
The presentation takes the
audience from the ritual harvest
dances of Africa, to the joyous
festival dances of Brazil, to slavery
court dances, to the minstrel and
vaudeville period, to concert jazz
dances and the latest soul steps.
Previous Chores
Since her return from her
recent tour on three continents,
Halifu has choreographed two
shows for the Committee
(Remember When . . . and Purlie),
and several productions of her
own. Halifu's presentation will be
performed Jan. 25, 26 at 8 p.m.
also in the Little Theatre.
The audience experiences more
recent history with the
Committee's production of the
comedy, Five On The Black Hand
Side, Jan. 16, 17, 18, 19 and 23,
24, 25, 26 at 8 p.m. in the Nitery.
Directed by John Cochran, the
play focuses on events that are
currently making history: the
women's liberation movement,
black militancy in its mildest
forms, the perennial problems
between father and son and
husband and Wife. Its
contemporary humor and almost
corny resolve have appeal almost
as broad as middle America.

Director Cochran, who is also
Chairman of the Committee on
