Marilyn Baker and Sally
Brompton
/ Exclusive! The Inside Story
■ of Patricia Hearst and the SLA
Macmillan, $8.95
The tangled tale of Patty
Hearst and the Symbionese
Liberation Army is perfect
material for classic story-telling. It
I contains elements of practically
every human emotion and
experience: love, hate, fear,
adventure, mystery, good, evil,
courage, pathos, sex.
In short, it's a great story.
That's why it so thoroughly
jr dominated front pages for five
months earlier this year, and
that's why there are at least four
books on the subject scheduled to
appear soon.
One must hope the
forthcoming books will deal with
k the subject a little more
sensitively than does television
newswoman Marilyn Baker in her
crude, arrogant Exclusive! Never
before has a book made a better
case against the news industry;
anyone reading this book is bound
to come away believing that
[ journalists are silly, shallow,
pretentious jackasses.
And if all newsmen were like
Marilyn Baker, they'd be right.
Bay Area Reporter
Baker, now pontificating
nightly on KPIX in San Francisco,
i was a reporter for the Bay Area's
educational station, KQED,
during the frenzied days of the
SLA last spring. She headed
KQED's coverage, and did, for the
most part, a creditable job,
breaking several exclusives ahead
» of the pack.
' She did not as you might
assume after reading her book
single-handedly unmask and
corner the SLA. She did as you
would probably never guess from
the book make a couple of
dumb mistakes. In other words,
f she is a good journalist, but not
the Woodward and
Bernstein-variety superstar she
would like you to think she is.
But Baker's major fault as a
journalist is the same one that
undermines her book. She has an
} enormous Jehovah complex, and
constantly offers judgements on
anyone and anything that strikes
her fancy. That's a major problem
for a journalist, who is supposed
to be offering the public objective
reporting.
I Of course it's hard to follow a
story for any length of time
without forming some conclusions
but most reporters have enough
brains to keep their opinions to
themselves. When they do offer
public analysis of a story they're
covering, they usually try to keep
it restrained and tempered.
No Restrictions
Marilyn Baker observes no such
restrictions. On one newscast last
February, she turned to the
cameras and told the public the
SLA had no real interest in the
f people, but was pursuing some
personal vendetta against the
Hearst family. The ransom
demand that Randolph Hearst

feed California's poor was an
effort to humiliate him, Baker
said.
Not only was that a hasty,
overblown generalization and a
blatant intrusion of editorializing
in a theoretically objective
newscast, but in retrospect it
seems to be wrong. The free food
demand was an effort to make the
SLA look like a modern Robin
Hood; no one has ever uncovered
any evidence that the SLA hated
the Hearsts anymore than it hated
anyone who was rich.
Baker's book abounds with this
kind of thing. Once a neighbor of
SLA member Patricia Soltysik
refused to grant an interview.
Baker, apparently operating on
the premise that a press card is
license to indulge in boorish
behavior, bellowed:
"Look, lady, this is what I get
paid to do. Maybe I'm not clever,
but I don't live off food stamps or
welfare, and I sure as hell pay the
taxes that let people like you live
off them. Now all I want are some
simple answers to some straight
questions."
Tragic Tale
The SLA story is one of
tragedy seven people dead,
three underground, and many
others hiding in fear but
Marilyn Baker apparently can't
see the human side of the story.
She has no sympathy for anyone:
Steven Weed, who lost his fiancee
to a terrorist gang, Patty Hearst,

plunged into a nightmare world of
guns and fire or the six SLA
soldiers who committed suicide in
a misguided and futile cause.
Baker obviously hates anyone
with values different from hers.
She bitterly accuses Weed and
Patty of creating "their own
mini-Hillsborough" in Berkeley
and then goes off on a ranting,
ripping rampage against them.
After raging against lifestyle
and personalities for a while,
Baker gets around to their
sexuality: "Had any wonderful,
low animal moans of satisfaction
strained through Weed's mustache
or shuddered out of the thin
pressed lips that looked out at me
from the picture of Patricia
Campbell Hearst?"
Baker allows as how she doubts
it, and then offers, without a
shred of evidence or provocation,
what must be the crudest printed
remark of the year, if not the
century, when she describes Patty
as "a lover without orgasm."
Other Problems
There are a number of other
problems with this book. For one
thing, Baker never once mentions
any other journalist's contribution
to the Hearst investigation— and
neglects to mention that often
other media uncovered stories at
the same time she did but
withheld them for fear of
endangering Patty Hearst,
Time magazine, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the New
York Times all abandoned scoops

to Marilyn Baker at one time or
another; if they hadn't, her
reputation would never have
advanced to the point where she
could have written this book.
Nevertheless, despite all the
pettiness, arrogance and just plain
garbage in Exclusive!, the book
does have a compelling narrative.
The story of the SLA is an
exciting one, and not even a
writer of Baker's ineptitude can
overcome that. From start to
finish it's fascinating reading, with
the tension steadily rising until it
climaxes in a crescendo of gunfire
at the little house in Los Angeles
where police killed six SLA
members.
Baker's book can incorporate
this excitement far more
effectively because she was a part
of the Hearst story.
Unfortunately, that's also the
major flaw in the book: Baker's
presence and involvement with
the story. And until another
reporter who covered the story
writes an account as several are
this will remain the most
gripping material on the SLA. It
will probably remain the most
offensive as well.

Vladimir Nabokov
Look at the Harlequins
McGraw Hill; $7.95
Look at the Harlequins,

Vladimir Nabokov's latest novel,
is a book of intellectual frivolity.
But it is a frivolity which
somehow redeems itself in the
very complexity of its twists and
turns.

In the style of Jorge Luis
Borges or Alain Robbe-Grillet,
Nabokov leads the reader through
a series of mental exercises on
reality, time and space. In other
novels he's hinted at such
intellectual games; here they
become all-important. The plot is
weak, and the characters are but
pawns harlequins that make
the games possible.
The protagonist and narrator is
one Vadim N., an aging author
turned "pedantic memoirist" who
is seeking to catalog the roots and
origins of his Russian and English
fiction. He holds just enough in
common with Nabokov to mislead
the reader into thinking he is
Nabokov. But Vadim reminds us
near the end of the novel that he
himself is merely a "figment of
somebody's not my own
imagination," another harlequin.
In the first pages of the book,
Mr. N. recalls a childhood episode
with a great aunt (whom he
immediately says is imaginary).
She reprimands the young boy for
moping too much and urges him,
to "Play! Invent Reality! Look at
the Harlequins!" And so the
puppet becomes puppeteer in his
own right; one pseudo-reality
overlays another, and things get

stranger and stranger.
In the next 200 pages, Mr. N.
describes the amorous
misadventures which result in
three marriages and a few affairs
with lithe and lewd "nymphets."
All these events are related with
that Nabokovian cosmic humor
and witty flippancy, and all are
nothing more than distorted
reflections of episodes in former
books.

Nabokov's rich English
vocabulary, interspersed with
French and Russian phrases,
constantly astounds one who
remembers that English was not
his native tongue. His tone is one
of extreme self-consciousness,
where the writer will reflect on
what he just wrote and demean or
explain the particular style in
which it was written. On the
stage, off the stage, and back
again.
But the language and the
characters are side shows, mere
icing on the cake. The main
thread running through everything
is Mr. N.'s mental sickness. No
matter how hard he tires, he
cannot visualize the physical act
of making an about-face, a shift
where right becomes left and left
becomes right.
Each wife learns of this
peculiar insanity only to dismiss it
as ridiculous, but Mr. N. continues
to puzzle over where one plane
and its opposite meet. When he
finally ends up actually having to
turn around, he freezes up,
paralyzed by his mental
convolutions, much as the reader
is paralyzed by trying to grasp
what in the hell Nabokov is
aiming at.
Right before his "death" or
rather, his ceasing to live when
Nabokov releases the strings Mr.
N.'s nymphet-fiancee offers a
complex solution. But
surprisingly, he dismisses the
whole affair as "exquisite
quibble" and crawls back into
bed.
Is the book, as Mr. N. says, a
series of meaningless mental
gymnastics? Or is Nabokov right
in justifying an invention of
spurious realities and games by
claiming, through Mr. N. earlier in
the book, that his , "harlequin
sunglasses are not a protection for
a harsh light but the masking of
tear-swollen eyelids"?
If anything could be criticized
about Nabokov, it is his apparent
lack of seriousness, his tendency
to dwell on the surface, no matter
how pretty that surface may be.
Sometimes the book seems just a
little bit too cute to be a work of

art.
And yet he might be right:
perhaps we should not delve too
deeply. A sense of humor may be
our only 'protection against
existential nausea.

Barclay Cooke & Jon Bradshaw
Backgammon: The Cruelest Game
Random House, $8.95
Swiftly following the rise in
popularity of any leisure-time
activity come shelves full of books
on the subject. Tennis' popularity
in the late 60s was followed by*
dozens of "how-to" books and
the exact same thing is happening
due to the revived interest in the
game of backgammon.
Backgammon: The Cruelest
Game is one of the few books on
the game that is of true value to
both the novice and the expert.
Despite its pretentious title, the
book is far different from the
regular pulp that profiteers
usually come out with.
Barclay Cooke, considered one
of the premier players of the
game, teamed with professional
writer Jon Bradshaw to produce
this clearly written text. Along
with Oswald Jacoby's definitive
book Backgammon, this belongs
on the bookshelf of all who are
interested in the game.
The book starts out with the
rules and basic moves of the
simple checkers-type game and
progresses steadily-but not too
swiftly for the beginner-all the
way through championship play.
The fact that an instruction
book of only 200 pages (including
many illustrations) can cover
material all the way from beginner
to expert is evidence of the game's
simplicity.
The only fault of the book is
that it seems to place too much
importance to the game. The title
is a clear overstatement of the
game's true import, but that's not
the only instance of
pretentiousness.
Each chapter begins with' a
quote by Karl von Clausewitz that
deals with actual war. Comparing
war to this simple game is ah,
unnecessary gimmick. The chapter
on "Basic Odds and Probabilities"
starts with von Clausewitz' quote
that "All action in war is directed
on probably, not on certidh
events." Surely the analogy of W&;
to backgammon is an unnecessary
gimmick.

Vladimir Nabokov
Look at the Harlequins
McGraw Hill; $7.95
Look at the Harlequins,

Vladimir Nabokov's latest novel,
is a book of intellectual frivolity.
But it is a frivolity which
somehow redeems itself in the
very complexity of its twists and
turns.

In the style of Jorge Luis
Borges or Alain Robbe-Grillet,
Nabokov leads the reader through
a series of mental exercises on
reality, time and space. In other
novels he's hinted at such
intellectual games; here they
become all-important. The plot is
weak, and the characters are but
pawns harlequins that make
the games possible.
The protagonist and narrator is
one Vadim N., an aging author
turned "pedantic memoirist" who
is seeking to catalog the roots and
origins of his Russian and English
fiction. He holds just enough in
common with Nabokov to mislead
the reader into thinking he is
Nabokov. But Vadim reminds us
near the end of the novel that he
himself is merely a "figment of
somebody's not my own
imagination," another harlequin.
In the first pages of the book,
Mr. N. recalls a childhood episode
with a great aunt (whom he
immediately says is imaginary).
She reprimands the young boy for
moping too much and urges him,
to "Play! Invent Reality! Look at
the Harlequins!" And so the
puppet becomes puppeteer in his
own right; one pseudo-reality
overlays another, and things get

stranger and stranger.
In the next 200 pages, Mr. N.
describes the amorous
misadventures which result in
three marriages and a few affairs
with lithe and lewd "nymphets."
All these events are related with
that Nabokovian cosmic humor
and witty flippancy, and all are
nothing more than distorted
reflections of episodes in former
books.

Nabokov's rich English
vocabulary, interspersed with
French and Russian phrases,
constantly astounds one who
remembers that English was not
his native tongue. His tone is one
of extreme self-consciousness,
where the writer will reflect on
what he just wrote and demean or
explain the particular style in
which it was written. On the
stage, off the stage, and back
again.
But the language and the
characters are side shows, mere
icing on the cake. The main
thread running through everything
is Mr. N.'s mental sickness. No
matter how hard he tires, he
cannot visualize the physical act
of making an about-face, a shift
where right becomes left and left
becomes right.
Each wife learns of this
peculiar insanity only to dismiss it
as ridiculous, but Mr. N. continues
to puzzle over where one plane
and its opposite meet. When he
finally ends up actually having to
turn around, he freezes up,
paralyzed by his mental
convolutions, much as the reader
is paralyzed by trying to grasp
what in the hell Nabokov is
aiming at.
Right before his "death" or
rather, his ceasing to live when
Nabokov releases the strings Mr.
N.'s nymphet-fiancee offers a
complex solution. But
surprisingly, he dismisses the
whole affair as "exquisite
quibble" and crawls back into
bed.
Is the book, as Mr. N. says, a
series of meaningless mental
gymnastics? Or is Nabokov right
in justifying an invention of
spurious realities and games by
claiming, through Mr. N. earlier in
the book, that his , "harlequin
sunglasses are not a protection for
a harsh light but the masking of
tear-swollen eyelids"?
If anything could be criticized
about Nabokov, it is his apparent
lack of seriousness, his tendency
to dwell on the surface, no matter
how pretty that surface may be.
Sometimes the book seems just a
little bit too cute to be a work of

art.
And yet he might be right:
perhaps we should not delve too
deeply. A sense of humor may be
our only 'protection against
existential nausea.

Backgammon: The Cruelest Game
Random House, $8.95
Swiftly following the rise in
popularity of any leisure-time
activity come shelves full of books
on the subject. Tennis' popularity
in the late 60s was followed by*
dozens of "how-to" books and
the exact same thing is happening
due to the revived interest in the
game of backgammon.
Backgammon: The Cruelest
Game is one of the few books on
the game that is of true value to
both the novice and the expert.
Despite its pretentious title, the
book is far different from the
regular pulp that profiteers
usually come out with.
Barclay Cooke, considered one
of the premier players of the
game, teamed with professional
writer Jon Bradshaw to produce
this clearly written text. Along
with Oswald Jacoby's definitive
book Backgammon, this belongs
on the bookshelf of all who are
interested in the game.
The book starts out with the
rules and basic moves of the
simple checkers-type game and
progresses steadily-but not too
swiftly for the beginner-all the
way through championship play.
The fact that an instruction
book of only 200 pages (including
many illustrations) can cover
material all the way from beginner
to expert is evidence of the game's
simplicity.
The only fault of the book is
that it seems to place too much
importance to the game. The title
is a clear overstatement of the
game's true import, but that's not
the only instance of
pretentiousness.
Each chapter begins with' a
quote by Karl von Clausewitz that
deals with actual war. Comparing
war to this simple game is ah,
unnecessary gimmick. The chapter
on "Basic Odds and Probabilities"
starts with von Clausewitz' quote
that "All action in war is directed
on probably, not on certidh
events." Surely the analogy of W&;
to backgammon is an unnecessary
gimmick.

BAKER'S SUBJECT—Patty (or Tania) Hearst is the subject of Bay Area reporter Marilyn Baker's book. On the left, Patty is seen posing in
front of the SLA's cobra flag, and on the right she is shown during a bank robbery. Both pictures were taken before six members of the SLA
died in a Los Angeles shootout.
Marilyn Baker and Sally
Brompton
/ Exclusive! The Inside Story
■ of Patricia Hearst and the SLA
Macmillan, $8.95
The tangled tale of Patty
Hearst and the Symbionese
Liberation Army is perfect
material for classic story-telling. It
I contains elements of practically
every human emotion and
experience: love, hate, fear,
adventure, mystery, good, evil,
courage, pathos, sex.
In short, it's a great story.
That's why it so thoroughly
jr dominated front pages for five
months earlier this year, and
that's why there are at least four
books on the subject scheduled to
appear soon.
One must hope the
forthcoming books will deal with
k the subject a little more
sensitively than does television
newswoman Marilyn Baker in her
crude, arrogant Exclusive! Never
before has a book made a better
case against the news industry;
anyone reading this book is bound
to come away believing that
[ journalists are silly, shallow,
pretentious jackasses.
And if all newsmen were like
Marilyn Baker, they'd be right.
Bay Area Reporter
Baker, now pontificating
nightly on KPIX in San Francisco,
i was a reporter for the Bay Area's
educational station, KQED,
during the frenzied days of the
SLA last spring. She headed
KQED's coverage, and did, for the
most part, a creditable job,
breaking several exclusives ahead
» of the pack.
' She did not as you might
assume after reading her book
single-handedly unmask and
corner the SLA. She did as you
would probably never guess from
the book make a couple of
dumb mistakes. In other words,
f she is a good journalist, but not
the Woodward and
Bernstein-variety superstar she
would like you to think she is.
But Baker's major fault as a
journalist is the same one that
undermines her book. She has an
} enormous Jehovah complex, and
constantly offers judgements on
anyone and anything that strikes
her fancy. That's a major problem
for a journalist, who is supposed
to be offering the public objective
reporting.
I Of course it's hard to follow a
story for any length of time
without forming some conclusions
but most reporters have enough
brains to keep their opinions to
themselves. When they do offer
public analysis of a story they're
covering, they usually try to keep
it restrained and tempered.
No Restrictions
Marilyn Baker observes no such
restrictions. On one newscast last
February, she turned to the
cameras and told the public the
SLA had no real interest in the
f people, but was pursuing some
personal vendetta against the
Hearst family. The ransom
demand that Randolph Hearst

feed California's poor was an
effort to humiliate him, Baker
said.
Not only was that a hasty,
overblown generalization and a
blatant intrusion of editorializing
in a theoretically objective
newscast, but in retrospect it
seems to be wrong. The free food
demand was an effort to make the
SLA look like a modern Robin
Hood; no one has ever uncovered
any evidence that the SLA hated
the Hearsts anymore than it hated
anyone who was rich.
Baker's book abounds with this
kind of thing. Once a neighbor of
SLA member Patricia Soltysik
refused to grant an interview.
Baker, apparently operating on
the premise that a press card is
license to indulge in boorish
behavior, bellowed:
"Look, lady, this is what I get
paid to do. Maybe I'm not clever,
but I don't live off food stamps or
welfare, and I sure as hell pay the
taxes that let people like you live
off them. Now all I want are some
simple answers to some straight
questions."
Tragic Tale
The SLA story is one of
tragedy seven people dead,
three underground, and many
others hiding in fear but
Marilyn Baker apparently can't
see the human side of the story.
She has no sympathy for anyone:
Steven Weed, who lost his fiancee
to a terrorist gang, Patty Hearst,

plunged into a nightmare world of
guns and fire or the six SLA
soldiers who committed suicide in
a misguided and futile cause.
Baker obviously hates anyone
with values different from hers.
She bitterly accuses Weed and
Patty of creating "their own
mini-Hillsborough" in Berkeley
and then goes off on a ranting,
ripping rampage against them.
After raging against lifestyle
and personalities for a while,
Baker gets around to their
sexuality: "Had any wonderful,
low animal moans of satisfaction
strained through Weed's mustache
or shuddered out of the thin
pressed lips that looked out at me
from the picture of Patricia
Campbell Hearst?"
Baker allows as how she doubts
it, and then offers, without a
shred of evidence or provocation,
what must be the crudest printed
remark of the year, if not the
century, when she describes Patty
as "a lover without orgasm."
Other Problems
There are a number of other
problems with this book. For one
thing, Baker never once mentions
any other journalist's contribution
to the Hearst investigation— and
neglects to mention that often
other media uncovered stories at
the same time she did but
withheld them for fear of
endangering Patty Hearst,
Time magazine, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the New
York Times all abandoned scoops

to Marilyn Baker at one time or
another; if they hadn't, her
reputation would never have
advanced to the point where she
could have written this book.
Nevertheless, despite all the
pettiness, arrogance and just plain
garbage in Exclusive!, the book
does have a compelling narrative.
The story of the SLA is an
exciting one, and not even a
writer of Baker's ineptitude can
overcome that. From start to
finish it's fascinating reading, with
the tension steadily rising until it
climaxes in a crescendo of gunfire
at the little house in Los Angeles
where police killed six SLA
members.
Baker's book can incorporate
this excitement far more
effectively because she was a part
of the Hearst story.
Unfortunately, that's also the
major flaw in the book: Baker's
presence and involvement with
the story. And until another
reporter who covered the story
writes an account as several are
this will remain the most
gripping material on the SLA. It
will probably remain the most
offensive as well.

/ Exclusive! The Inside Story
■ of Patricia Hearst and the SLA
Macmillan, $8.95
The tangled tale of Patty
Hearst and the Symbionese
Liberation Army is perfect
material for classic story-telling. It
I contains elements of practically
every human emotion and
experience: love, hate, fear,
adventure, mystery, good, evil,
courage, pathos, sex.
In short, it's a great story.
That's why it so thoroughly
jr dominated front pages for five
months earlier this year, and
that's why there are at least four
books on the subject scheduled to
appear soon.
One must hope the
forthcoming books will deal with
k the subject a little more
sensitively than does television
newswoman Marilyn Baker in her
crude, arrogant Exclusive! Never
before has a book made a better
case against the news industry;
anyone reading this book is bound
to come away believing that
[ journalists are silly, shallow,
pretentious jackasses.
And if all newsmen were like
Marilyn Baker, they'd be right.
Bay Area Reporter
Baker, now pontificating
nightly on KPIX in San Francisco,
i was a reporter for the Bay Area's
educational station, KQED,
during the frenzied days of the
SLA last spring. She headed
KQED's coverage, and did, for the
most part, a creditable job,
breaking several exclusives ahead
» of the pack.
' She did not as you might
assume after reading her book
single-handedly unmask and
corner the SLA. She did as you
would probably never guess from
the book make a couple of
dumb mistakes. In other words,
f she is a good journalist, but not
the Woodward and
Bernstein-variety superstar she
would like you to think she is.
But Baker's major fault as a
journalist is the same one that
undermines her book. She has an
} enormous Jehovah complex, and
constantly offers judgements on
anyone and anything that strikes
her fancy. That's a major problem
for a journalist, who is supposed
to be offering the public objective
reporting.
I Of course it's hard to follow a
story for any length of time
without forming some conclusions
but most reporters have enough
brains to keep their opinions to
themselves. When they do offer
public analysis of a story they're
covering, they usually try to keep
it restrained and tempered.
No Restrictions
Marilyn Baker observes no such
restrictions. On one newscast last
February, she turned to the
cameras and told the public the
SLA had no real interest in the
f people, but was pursuing some
personal vendetta against the
Hearst family. The ransom
demand that Randolph Hearst

feed California's poor was an
effort to humiliate him, Baker
said.
Not only was that a hasty,
overblown generalization and a
blatant intrusion of editorializing
in a theoretically objective
newscast, but in retrospect it
seems to be wrong. The free food
demand was an effort to make the
SLA look like a modern Robin
Hood; no one has ever uncovered
any evidence that the SLA hated
the Hearsts anymore than it hated
anyone who was rich.
Baker's book abounds with this
kind of thing. Once a neighbor of
SLA member Patricia Soltysik
refused to grant an interview.
Baker, apparently operating on
the premise that a press card is
license to indulge in boorish
behavior, bellowed:
"Look, lady, this is what I get
paid to do. Maybe I'm not clever,
but I don't live off food stamps or
welfare, and I sure as hell pay the
taxes that let people like you live
off them. Now all I want are some
simple answers to some straight
questions."
Tragic Tale
The SLA story is one of
tragedy seven people dead,
three underground, and many
others hiding in fear but
Marilyn Baker apparently can't
see the human side of the story.
She has no sympathy for anyone:
Steven Weed, who lost his fiancee
to a terrorist gang, Patty Hearst,

plunged into a nightmare world of
guns and fire or the six SLA
soldiers who committed suicide in
a misguided and futile cause.
Baker obviously hates anyone
with values different from hers.
She bitterly accuses Weed and
Patty of creating "their own
mini-Hillsborough" in Berkeley
and then goes off on a ranting,
ripping rampage against them.
After raging against lifestyle
and personalities for a while,
Baker gets around to their
sexuality: "Had any wonderful,
low animal moans of satisfaction
strained through Weed's mustache
or shuddered out of the thin
pressed lips that looked out at me
from the picture of Patricia
Campbell Hearst?"
Baker allows as how she doubts
it, and then offers, without a
shred of evidence or provocation,
what must be the crudest printed
remark of the year, if not the
century, when she describes Patty
as "a lover without orgasm."
Other Problems
There are a number of other
problems with this book. For one
thing, Baker never once mentions
any other journalist's contribution
to the Hearst investigation— and
neglects to mention that often
other media uncovered stories at
the same time she did but
withheld them for fear of
endangering Patty Hearst,
Time magazine, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the New
York Times all abandoned scoops

to Marilyn Baker at one time or
another; if they hadn't, her
reputation would never have
advanced to the point where she
could have written this book.
Nevertheless, despite all the
pettiness, arrogance and just plain
garbage in Exclusive!, the book
does have a compelling narrative.
The story of the SLA is an
exciting one, and not even a
writer of Baker's ineptitude can
overcome that. From start to
finish it's fascinating reading, with
the tension steadily rising until it
climaxes in a crescendo of gunfire
at the little house in Los Angeles
where police killed six SLA
members.
Baker's book can incorporate
this excitement far more
effectively because she was a part
of the Hearst story.
Unfortunately, that's also the
major flaw in the book: Baker's
presence and involvement with
the story. And until another
reporter who covered the story
writes an account as several are
this will remain the most
gripping material on the SLA. It
will probably remain the most
offensive as well.

Vladimir Nabokov
Look at the Harlequins
McGraw Hill; $7.95
Look at the Harlequins,

Vladimir Nabokov's latest novel,
is a book of intellectual frivolity.
But it is a frivolity which
somehow redeems itself in the
very complexity of its twists and
turns.

In the style of Jorge Luis
Borges or Alain Robbe-Grillet,
Nabokov leads the reader through
a series of mental exercises on
reality, time and space. In other
novels he's hinted at such
intellectual games; here they
become all-important. The plot is
weak, and the characters are but
pawns harlequins that make
the games possible.
The protagonist and narrator is
one Vadim N., an aging author
turned "pedantic memoirist" who
is seeking to catalog the roots and
origins of his Russian and English
fiction. He holds just enough in
common with Nabokov to mislead
the reader into thinking he is
Nabokov. But Vadim reminds us
near the end of the novel that he
himself is merely a "figment of
somebody's not my own
imagination," another harlequin.
In the first pages of the book,
Mr. N. recalls a childhood episode
with a great aunt (whom he
immediately says is imaginary).
She reprimands the young boy for
moping too much and urges him,
to "Play! Invent Reality! Look at
the Harlequins!" And so the
puppet becomes puppeteer in his
own right; one pseudo-reality
overlays another, and things get

stranger and stranger.
In the next 200 pages, Mr. N.
describes the amorous
misadventures which result in
three marriages and a few affairs
with lithe and lewd "nymphets."
All these events are related with
that Nabokovian cosmic humor
and witty flippancy, and all are
nothing more than distorted
reflections of episodes in former
books.

Nabokov's rich English
vocabulary, interspersed with
French and Russian phrases,
constantly astounds one who
remembers that English was not
his native tongue. His tone is one
of extreme self-consciousness,
where the writer will reflect on
what he just wrote and demean or
explain the particular style in
which it was written. On the
stage, off the stage, and back
again.
But the language and the
characters are side shows, mere
icing on the cake. The main
thread running through everything
is Mr. N.'s mental sickness. No
matter how hard he tires, he
cannot visualize the physical act
of making an about-face, a shift
where right becomes left and left
becomes right.
Each wife learns of this
peculiar insanity only to dismiss it
as ridiculous, but Mr. N. continues
to puzzle over where one plane
and its opposite meet. When he
finally ends up actually having to
turn around, he freezes up,
paralyzed by his mental
convolutions, much as the reader
is paralyzed by trying to grasp
what in the hell Nabokov is
aiming at.
Right before his "death" or
rather, his ceasing to live when
Nabokov releases the strings Mr.
N.'s nymphet-fiancee offers a
complex solution. But
surprisingly, he dismisses the
whole affair as "exquisite
quibble" and crawls back into
bed.
Is the book, as Mr. N. says, a
series of meaningless mental
gymnastics? Or is Nabokov right
in justifying an invention of
spurious realities and games by
claiming, through Mr. N. earlier in
the book, that his , "harlequin
sunglasses are not a protection for
a harsh light but the masking of
tear-swollen eyelids"?
If anything could be criticized
about Nabokov, it is his apparent
lack of seriousness, his tendency
to dwell on the surface, no matter
how pretty that surface may be.
Sometimes the book seems just a
little bit too cute to be a work of

art.
And yet he might be right:
perhaps we should not delve too
deeply. A sense of humor may be
our only 'protection against
existential nausea.

Backgammon: The Cruelest Game
Random House, $8.95
Swiftly following the rise in
popularity of any leisure-time
activity come shelves full of books
on the subject. Tennis' popularity
in the late 60s was followed by*
dozens of "how-to" books and
the exact same thing is happening
due to the revived interest in the
game of backgammon.
Backgammon: The Cruelest
Game is one of the few books on
the game that is of true value to
both the novice and the expert.
Despite its pretentious title, the
book is far different from the
regular pulp that profiteers
usually come out with.
Barclay Cooke, considered one
of the premier players of the
game, teamed with professional
writer Jon Bradshaw to produce
this clearly written text. Along
with Oswald Jacoby's definitive
book Backgammon, this belongs
on the bookshelf of all who are
interested in the game.
The book starts out with the
rules and basic moves of the
simple checkers-type game and
progresses steadily-but not too
swiftly for the beginner-all the
way through championship play.
The fact that an instruction
book of only 200 pages (including
many illustrations) can cover
material all the way from beginner
to expert is evidence of the game's
simplicity.
The only fault of the book is
that it seems to place too much
importance to the game. The title
is a clear overstatement of the
game's true import, but that's not
the only instance of
pretentiousness.
Each chapter begins with' a
quote by Karl von Clausewitz that
deals with actual war. Comparing
war to this simple game is ah,
unnecessary gimmick. The chapter
on "Basic Odds and Probabilities"
starts with von Clausewitz' quote
that "All action in war is directed
on probably, not on certidh
events." Surely the analogy of W&;
to backgammon is an unnecessary
gimmick.

Vladimir Nabokov
Look at the Harlequins
McGraw Hill; $7.95
Look at the Harlequins,

Vladimir Nabokov's latest novel,
is a book of intellectual frivolity.
But it is a frivolity which
somehow redeems itself in the
very complexity of its twists and
turns.

In the style of Jorge Luis
Borges or Alain Robbe-Grillet,
Nabokov leads the reader through
a series of mental exercises on
reality, time and space. In other
novels he's hinted at such
intellectual games; here they
become all-important. The plot is
weak, and the characters are but
pawns harlequins that make
the games possible.
The protagonist and narrator is
one Vadim N., an aging author
turned "pedantic memoirist" who
is seeking to catalog the roots and
origins of his Russian and English
fiction. He holds just enough in
common with Nabokov to mislead
the reader into thinking he is
Nabokov. But Vadim reminds us
near the end of the novel that he
himself is merely a "figment of
somebody's not my own
imagination," another harlequin.
In the first pages of the book,
Mr. N. recalls a childhood episode
with a great aunt (whom he
immediately says is imaginary).
She reprimands the young boy for
moping too much and urges him,
to "Play! Invent Reality! Look at
the Harlequins!" And so the
puppet becomes puppeteer in his
own right; one pseudo-reality
overlays another, and things get

stranger and stranger.
In the next 200 pages, Mr. N.
describes the amorous
misadventures which result in
three marriages and a few affairs
with lithe and lewd "nymphets."
All these events are related with
that Nabokovian cosmic humor
and witty flippancy, and all are
nothing more than distorted
reflections of episodes in former
books.

Nabokov's rich English
vocabulary, interspersed with
French and Russian phrases,
constantly astounds one who
remembers that English was not
his native tongue. His tone is one
of extreme self-consciousness,
where the writer will reflect on
what he just wrote and demean or
explain the particular style in
which it was written. On the
stage, off the stage, and back
again.
But the language and the
characters are side shows, mere
icing on the cake. The main
thread running through everything
is Mr. N.'s mental sickness. No
matter how hard he tires, he
cannot visualize the physical act
of making an about-face, a shift
where right becomes left and left
becomes right.
Each wife learns of this
peculiar insanity only to dismiss it
as ridiculous, but Mr. N. continues
to puzzle over where one plane
and its opposite meet. When he
finally ends up actually having to
turn around, he freezes up,
paralyzed by his mental
convolutions, much as the reader
is paralyzed by trying to grasp
what in the hell Nabokov is
aiming at.
Right before his "death" or
rather, his ceasing to live when
Nabokov releases the strings Mr.
N.'s nymphet-fiancee offers a
complex solution. But
surprisingly, he dismisses the
whole affair as "exquisite
quibble" and crawls back into
bed.
Is the book, as Mr. N. says, a
series of meaningless mental
gymnastics? Or is Nabokov right
in justifying an invention of
spurious realities and games by
claiming, through Mr. N. earlier in
the book, that his , "harlequin
sunglasses are not a protection for
a harsh light but the masking of
tear-swollen eyelids"?
If anything could be criticized
about Nabokov, it is his apparent
lack of seriousness, his tendency
to dwell on the surface, no matter
how pretty that surface may be.
Sometimes the book seems just a
little bit too cute to be a work of

art.
And yet he might be right:
perhaps we should not delve too
deeply. A sense of humor may be
our only 'protection against
existential nausea.

Backgammon: The Cruelest Game
Random House, $8.95
Swiftly following the rise in
popularity of any leisure-time
activity come shelves full of books
on the subject. Tennis' popularity
in the late 60s was followed by*
dozens of "how-to" books and
the exact same thing is happening
due to the revived interest in the
game of backgammon.
Backgammon: The Cruelest
Game is one of the few books on
the game that is of true value to
both the novice and the expert.
Despite its pretentious title, the
book is far different from the
regular pulp that profiteers
usually come out with.
Barclay Cooke, considered one
of the premier players of the
game, teamed with professional
writer Jon Bradshaw to produce
this clearly written text. Along
with Oswald Jacoby's definitive
book Backgammon, this belongs
on the bookshelf of all who are
interested in the game.
The book starts out with the
rules and basic moves of the
simple checkers-type game and
progresses steadily-but not too
swiftly for the beginner-all the
way through championship play.
The fact that an instruction
book of only 200 pages (including
many illustrations) can cover
material all the way from beginner
to expert is evidence of the game's
simplicity.
The only fault of the book is
that it seems to place too much
importance to the game. The title
is a clear overstatement of the
game's true import, but that's not
the only instance of
pretentiousness.
Each chapter begins with' a
quote by Karl von Clausewitz that
deals with actual war. Comparing
war to this simple game is ah,
unnecessary gimmick. The chapter
on "Basic Odds and Probabilities"
starts with von Clausewitz' quote
that "All action in war is directed
on probably, not on certidh
events." Surely the analogy of W&;
to backgammon is an unnecessary
gimmick.

BAKER'S SUBJECT—Patty (or Tania) Hearst is the subject of Bay Area reporter Marilyn Baker's book. On the left, Patty is seen posing in
front of the SLA's cobra flag, and on the right she is shown during a bank robbery. Both pictures were taken before six members of the SLA
died in a Los Angeles shootout.

Brompton
/ Exclusive! The Inside Story
■ of Patricia Hearst and the SLA
Macmillan, $8.95
The tangled tale of Patty
Hearst and the Symbionese
Liberation Army is perfect
material for classic story-telling. It
I contains elements of practically
every human emotion and
experience: love, hate, fear,
adventure, mystery, good, evil,
courage, pathos, sex.
In short, it's a great story.
That's why it so thoroughly
jr dominated front pages for five
months earlier this year, and
that's why there are at least four
books on the subject scheduled to
appear soon.
One must hope the
forthcoming books will deal with
k the subject a little more
sensitively than does television
newswoman Marilyn Baker in her
crude, arrogant Exclusive! Never
before has a book made a better
case against the news industry;
anyone reading this book is bound
to come away believing that
[ journalists are silly, shallow,
pretentious jackasses.
And if all newsmen were like
Marilyn Baker, they'd be right.
Bay Area Reporter
Baker, now pontificating
nightly on KPIX in San Francisco,
i was a reporter for the Bay Area's
educational station, KQED,
during the frenzied days of the
SLA last spring. She headed
KQED's coverage, and did, for the
most part, a creditable job,
breaking several exclusives ahead
» of the pack.
' She did not as you might
assume after reading her book
single-handedly unmask and
corner the SLA. She did as you
would probably never guess from
the book make a couple of
dumb mistakes. In other words,
f she is a good journalist, but not
the Woodward and
Bernstein-variety superstar she
would like you to think she is.
But Baker's major fault as a
journalist is the same one that
undermines her book. She has an
} enormous Jehovah complex, and
constantly offers judgements on
anyone and anything that strikes
her fancy. That's a major problem
for a journalist, who is supposed
to be offering the public objective
reporting.
I Of course it's hard to follow a
story for any length of time
without forming some conclusions
but most reporters have enough
brains to keep their opinions to
themselves. When they do offer
public analysis of a story they're
covering, they usually try to keep
it restrained and tempered.
No Restrictions
Marilyn Baker observes no such
restrictions. On one newscast last
February, she turned to the
cameras and told the public the
SLA had no real interest in the
f people, but was pursuing some
personal vendetta against the
Hearst family. The ransom
demand that Randolph Hearst

feed California's poor was an
effort to humiliate him, Baker
said.
Not only was that a hasty,
overblown generalization and a
blatant intrusion of editorializing
in a theoretically objective
newscast, but in retrospect it
seems to be wrong. The free food
demand was an effort to make the
SLA look like a modern Robin
Hood; no one has ever uncovered
any evidence that the SLA hated
the Hearsts anymore than it hated
anyone who was rich.
Baker's book abounds with this
kind of thing. Once a neighbor of
SLA member Patricia Soltysik
refused to grant an interview.
Baker, apparently operating on
the premise that a press card is
license to indulge in boorish
behavior, bellowed:
"Look, lady, this is what I get
paid to do. Maybe I'm not clever,
but I don't live off food stamps or
welfare, and I sure as hell pay the
taxes that let people like you live
off them. Now all I want are some
simple answers to some straight
questions."
Tragic Tale
The SLA story is one of
tragedy seven people dead,
three underground, and many
others hiding in fear but
Marilyn Baker apparently can't
see the human side of the story.
She has no sympathy for anyone:
Steven Weed, who lost his fiancee
to a terrorist gang, Patty Hearst,

plunged into a nightmare world of
guns and fire or the six SLA
soldiers who committed suicide in
a misguided and futile cause.
Baker obviously hates anyone
with values different from hers.
She bitterly accuses Weed and
Patty of creating "their own
mini-Hillsborough" in Berkeley
and then goes off on a ranting,
ripping rampage against them.
After raging against lifestyle
and personalities for a while,
Baker gets around to their
sexuality: "Had any wonderful,
low animal moans of satisfaction
strained through Weed's mustache
or shuddered out of the thin
pressed lips that looked out at me
from the picture of Patricia
Campbell Hearst?"
Baker allows as how she doubts
it, and then offers, without a
shred of evidence or provocation,
what must be the crudest printed
remark of the year, if not the
century, when she describes Patty
as "a lover without orgasm."
Other Problems
There are a number of other
problems with this book. For one
thing, Baker never once mentions
any other journalist's contribution
to the Hearst investigation— and
neglects to mention that often
other media uncovered stories at
the same time she did but
withheld them for fear of
endangering Patty Hearst,
Time magazine, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the New
York Times all abandoned scoops

to Marilyn Baker at one time or
another; if they hadn't, her
reputation would never have
advanced to the point where she
could have written this book.
Nevertheless, despite all the
pettiness, arrogance and just plain
garbage in Exclusive!, the book
does have a compelling narrative.
The story of the SLA is an
exciting one, and not even a
writer of Baker's ineptitude can
overcome that. From start to
finish it's fascinating reading, with
the tension steadily rising until it
climaxes in a crescendo of gunfire
at the little house in Los Angeles
where police killed six SLA
members.
Baker's book can incorporate
this excitement far more
effectively because she was a part
of the Hearst story.
Unfortunately, that's also the
major flaw in the book: Baker's
presence and involvement with
the story. And until another
reporter who covered the story

this will remain the most
gripping material on the SLA. It
will probably remain the most

BAKER'S SUBJECT—Patty (or Tania) Hearst is the subject of Bay Area reporter Marilyn Baker's book. On the left, Patty is seen posing in
front of the SLA's cobra flag, and on the right she is shown during a bank robbery. Both pictures were taken before six members of the SLA
died in a Los Angeles shootout.

/ Exclusive! The Inside Story
■ of Patricia Hearst and the SLA
Macmillan, $8.95
The tangled tale of Patty
Hearst and the Symbionese
Liberation Army is perfect
material for classic story-telling. It
I contains elements of practically
every human emotion and
experience: love, hate, fear,
adventure, mystery, good, evil,
courage, pathos, sex.
In short, it's a great story.
That's why it so thoroughly
jr dominated front pages for five
months earlier this year, and
that's why there are at least four
books on the subject scheduled to
appear soon.
One must hope the
forthcoming books will deal with
k the subject a little more
sensitively than does television
newswoman Marilyn Baker in her
crude, arrogant Exclusive! Never
before has a book made a better
case against the news industry;
anyone reading this book is bound
to come away believing that
[ journalists are silly, shallow,
pretentious jackasses.
And if all newsmen were like
Marilyn Baker, they'd be right.
Bay Area Reporter
Baker, now pontificating
nightly on KPIX in San Francisco,
i was a reporter for the Bay Area's
educational station, KQED,
during the frenzied days of the
SLA last spring. She headed
KQED's coverage, and did, for the
most part, a creditable job,
breaking several exclusives ahead
» of the pack.
' She did not as you might
assume after reading her book
single-handedly unmask and
corner the SLA. She did as you
would probably never guess from
the book make a couple of
dumb mistakes. In other words,
f she is a good journalist, but not
the Woodward and
Bernstein-variety superstar she
would like you to think she is.
But Baker's major fault as a
journalist is the same one that
undermines her book. She has an
} enormous Jehovah complex, and
constantly offers judgements on
anyone and anything that strikes
her fancy. That's a major problem
for a journalist, who is supposed
to be offering the public objective
reporting.
I Of course it's hard to follow a
story for any length of time
without forming some conclusions
but most reporters have enough
brains to keep their opinions to
themselves. When they do offer
public analysis of a story they're
covering, they usually try to keep
it restrained and tempered.
No Restrictions
Marilyn Baker observes no such
restrictions. On one newscast last
February, she turned to the
cameras and told the public the
SLA had no real interest in the
f people, but was pursuing some
personal vendetta against the
Hearst family. The ransom
demand that Randolph Hearst

feed California's poor was an
effort to humiliate him, Baker
said.
Not only was that a hasty,
overblown generalization and a
blatant intrusion of editorializing
in a theoretically objective
newscast, but in retrospect it
seems to be wrong. The free food
demand was an effort to make the
SLA look like a modern Robin
Hood; no one has ever uncovered
any evidence that the SLA hated
the Hearsts anymore than it hated
anyone who was rich.
Baker's book abounds with this
kind of thing. Once a neighbor of
SLA member Patricia Soltysik
refused to grant an interview.
Baker, apparently operating on
the premise that a press card is
license to indulge in boorish
behavior, bellowed:
"Look, lady, this is what I get
paid to do. Maybe I'm not clever,
but I don't live off food stamps or
welfare, and I sure as hell pay the
taxes that let people like you live
off them. Now all I want are some
simple answers to some straight
questions."
Tragic Tale
The SLA story is one of
tragedy seven people dead,
three underground, and many
others hiding in fear but
Marilyn Baker apparently can't
see the human side of the story.
She has no sympathy for anyone:
Steven Weed, who lost his fiancee
to a terrorist gang, Patty Hearst,

plunged into a nightmare world of
guns and fire or the six SLA
soldiers who committed suicide in
a misguided and futile cause.
Baker obviously hates anyone
with values different from hers.
She bitterly accuses Weed and
Patty of creating "their own
mini-Hillsborough" in Berkeley
and then goes off on a ranting,
ripping rampage against them.
After raging against lifestyle
and personalities for a while,
Baker gets around to their
sexuality: "Had any wonderful,
low animal moans of satisfaction
strained through Weed's mustache
or shuddered out of the thin
pressed lips that looked out at me
from the picture of Patricia
Campbell Hearst?"
Baker allows as how she doubts
it, and then offers, without a
shred of evidence or provocation,
what must be the crudest printed
remark of the year, if not the
century, when she describes Patty
as "a lover without orgasm."
Other Problems
There are a number of other
problems with this book. For one
thing, Baker never once mentions
any other journalist's contribution
to the Hearst investigation— and
neglects to mention that often
other media uncovered stories at
the same time she did but
withheld them for fear of
endangering Patty Hearst,
Time magazine, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the New
York Times all abandoned scoops

to Marilyn Baker at one time or
another; if they hadn't, her
reputation would never have
advanced to the point where she
could have written this book.
Nevertheless, despite all the
pettiness, arrogance and just plain
garbage in Exclusive!, the book
does have a compelling narrative.
The story of the SLA is an
exciting one, and not even a
writer of Baker's ineptitude can
overcome that. From start to
finish it's fascinating reading, with
the tension steadily rising until it
climaxes in a crescendo of gunfire
at the little house in Los Angeles
where police killed six SLA
members.
Baker's book can incorporate
this excitement far more
effectively because she was a part
of the Hearst story.
Unfortunately, that's also the
major flaw in the book: Baker's
presence and involvement with
the story. And until another
reporter who covered the story
writes an account as several are
this will remain the most
gripping material on the SLA. It
will probably remain the most
offensive as well.

Vladimir Nabokov
Look at the Harlequins
McGraw Hill; $7.95
Look at the Harlequins,

Vladimir Nabokov's latest novel,
is a book of intellectual frivolity.
But it is a frivolity which
somehow redeems itself in the
very complexity of its twists and
turns.

In the style of Jorge Luis
Borges or Alain Robbe-Grillet,
Nabokov leads the reader through
a series of mental exercises on
reality, time and space. In other
novels he's hinted at such
intellectual games; here they
become all-important. The plot is
weak, and the characters are but
pawns harlequins that make
the games possible.
The protagonist and narrator is
one Vadim N., an aging author
turned "pedantic memoirist" who
is seeking to catalog the roots and
origins of his Russian and English
fiction. He holds just enough in
common with Nabokov to mislead
the reader into thinking he is
Nabokov. But Vadim reminds us
near the end of the novel that he
himself is merely a "figment of
somebody's not my own
imagination," another harlequin.
In the first pages of the book,
Mr. N. recalls a childhood episode
with a great aunt (whom he
immediately says is imaginary).
She reprimands the young boy for
moping too much and urges him,
to "Play! Invent Reality! Look at
the Harlequins!" And so the
puppet becomes puppeteer in his
own right; one pseudo-reality
overlays another, and things get

stranger and stranger.
In the next 200 pages, Mr. N.
describes the amorous
misadventures which result in
three marriages and a few affairs
with lithe and lewd "nymphets."
All these events are related with
that Nabokovian cosmic humor
and witty flippancy, and all are
nothing more than distorted
reflections of episodes in former
books.

Nabokov's rich English
vocabulary, interspersed with
French and Russian phrases,
constantly astounds one who
remembers that English was not
his native tongue. His tone is one
of extreme self-consciousness,
where the writer will reflect on
what he just wrote and demean or
explain the particular style in
which it was written. On the
stage, off the stage, and back
again.
But the language and the
characters are side shows, mere
icing on the cake. The main
thread running through everything
is Mr. N.'s mental sickness. No
matter how hard he tires, he
cannot visualize the physical act
of making an about-face, a shift
where right becomes left and left
becomes right.
Each wife learns of this
peculiar insanity only to dismiss it
as ridiculous, but Mr. N. continues
to puzzle over where one plane
and its opposite meet. When he
finally ends up actually having to
turn around, he freezes up,
paralyzed by his mental
convolutions, much as the reader
is paralyzed by trying to grasp
what in the hell Nabokov is
aiming at.
Right before his "death" or
rather, his ceasing to live when
Nabokov releases the strings Mr.
N.'s nymphet-fiancee offers a
complex solution. But
surprisingly, he dismisses the
whole affair as "exquisite
quibble" and crawls back into
bed.
Is the book, as Mr. N. says, a
series of meaningless mental
gymnastics? Or is Nabokov right
in justifying an invention of
spurious realities and games by
claiming, through Mr. N. earlier in
the book, that his , "harlequin
sunglasses are not a protection for
a harsh light but the masking of
tear-swollen eyelids"?
If anything could be criticized
about Nabokov, it is his apparent
lack of seriousness, his tendency
to dwell on the surface, no matter
how pretty that surface may be.
Sometimes the book seems just a
little bit too cute to be a work of

art.
And yet he might be right:
perhaps we should not delve too
deeply. A sense of humor may be
our only 'protection against
existential nausea.

Backgammon: The Cruelest Game
Random House, $8.95
Swiftly following the rise in
popularity of any leisure-time
activity come shelves full of books
on the subject. Tennis' popularity

dozens of "how-to" books and
the exact same thing is happening
due to the revived interest in the
game of backgammon.
Backgammon: The Cruelest
Game is one of the few books on
the game that is of true value to
both the novice and the expert.
Despite its pretentious title, the
book is far different from the

of the premier players of the

writer Jon Bradshaw to produce
this clearly written text. Along
with Oswald Jacoby's definitive
book Backgammon, this belongs
on the bookshelf of all who are

The book starts out with the
rules and basic moves of the
simple checkers-type game and
progresses steadily-but not too
swiftly for the beginner-all the
way through championship play.
The fact that an instruction
book of only 200 pages (including
many illustrations) can cover
material all the way from beginner

simplicity.
The only fault of the book is
that it seems to place too much
importance to the game. The title
is a clear overstatement of the

and personalities for a while,
Baker gets around to their
sexuality: "Had any wonderful,
low animal moans of satisfaction
strained through Weed's mustache
or shuddered out of the thin
pressed lips that looked out at me
from the picture of Patricia
Campbell Hearst?"
Baker allows as how she doubts
it, and then offers, without a
shred of evidence or provocation,
what must be the crudest printed
remark of the year, if not the
century, when she describes Patty
as "a lover without orgasm."
Other Problems
There are a number of other
problems with this book. For one
thing, Baker never once mentions
any other journalist's contribution
to the Hearst investigation— and
neglects to mention that often
other media uncovered stories at
the same time she did but
withheld them for fear of
endangering Patty Hearst,
Time magazine, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the New
York Times all abandoned scoops

to Marilyn Baker at one time or
another; if they hadn't, her
reputation would never have
advanced to the point where she
could have written this book.
Nevertheless, despite all the
pettiness, arrogance and just plain
garbage in Exclusive!, the book
does have a compelling narrative.
The story of the SLA is an
exciting one, and not even a
writer of Baker's ineptitude can
overcome that. From start to
finish it's fascinating reading, with
the tension steadily rising until it
climaxes in a crescendo of gunfire
at the little house in Los Angeles
where police killed six SLA
members.
Baker's book can incorporate
this excitement far more
effectively because she was a part
of the Hearst story.
Unfortunately, that's also the
major flaw in the book: Baker's
presence and involvement with
the story. And until another
reporter who covered the story
writes an account as several are
this will remain the most
gripping material on the SLA. It
will probably remain the most
offensive as well.

Vladimir Nabokov
Look at the Harlequins
McGraw Hill; $7.95
Look at the Harlequins,

Vladimir Nabokov's latest novel,
is a book of intellectual frivolity.
But it is a frivolity which
somehow redeems itself in the
very complexity of its twists and
turns.

In the style of Jorge Luis
Borges or Alain Robbe-Grillet,
Nabokov leads the reader through
a series of mental exercises on
reality, time and space. In other
novels he's hinted at such
intellectual games; here they
become all-important. The plot is
weak, and the characters are but
pawns harlequins that make
the games possible.
The protagonist and narrator is
one Vadim N., an aging author
turned "pedantic memoirist" who
is seeking to catalog the roots and
origins of his Russian and English
fiction. He holds just enough in
common with Nabokov to mislead
the reader into thinking he is
Nabokov. But Vadim reminds us
near the end of the novel that he
himself is merely a "figment of
somebody's not my own
imagination," another harlequin.
In the first pages of the book,
Mr. N. recalls a childhood episode
with a great aunt (whom he
immediately says is imaginary).
She reprimands the young boy for
moping too much and urges him,
to "Play! Invent Reality! Look at
the Harlequins!" And so the
puppet becomes puppeteer in his
own right; one pseudo-reality
overlays another, and things get

stranger and stranger.
In the next 200 pages, Mr. N.
describes the amorous
misadventures which result in
three marriages and a few affairs
with lithe and lewd "nymphets."
All these events are related with
that Nabokovian cosmic humor
and witty flippancy, and all are
nothing more than distorted
reflections of episodes in former
books.

Nabokov's rich English
vocabulary, interspersed with
French and Russian phrases,
constantly astounds one who
remembers that English was not
his native tongue. His tone is one
of extreme self-consciousness,
where the writer will reflect on
what he just wrote and demean or
explain the particular style in
which it was written. On the
stage, off the stage, and back
again.
But the language and the
characters are side shows, mere
icing on the cake. The main
thread running through everything
is Mr. N.'s mental sickness. No
matter how hard he tires, he
cannot visualize the physical act
of making an about-face, a shift
where right becomes left and left
becomes right.
Each wife learns of this
peculiar insanity only to dismiss it
as ridiculous, but Mr. N. continues
to puzzle over where one plane
and its opposite meet. When he
finally ends up actually having to
turn around, he freezes up,
paralyzed by his mental
convolutions, much as the reader
is paralyzed by trying to grasp
what in the hell Nabokov is
aiming at.
Right before his "death" or
rather, his ceasing to live when
Nabokov releases the strings Mr.
N.'s nymphet-fiancee offers a
complex solution. But
surprisingly, he dismisses the
whole affair as "exquisite
quibble" and crawls back into
bed.
Is the book, as Mr. N. says, a
series of meaningless mental
gymnastics? Or is Nabokov right
in justifying an invention of
spurious realities and games by
claiming, through Mr. N. earlier in
the book, that his , "harlequin
sunglasses are not a protection for
a harsh light but the masking of
tear-swollen eyelids"?
If anything could be criticized
about Nabokov, it is his apparent
lack of seriousness, his tendency
to dwell on the surface, no matter
how pretty that surface may be.
Sometimes the book seems just a
little bit too cute to be a work of

art.
And yet he might be right:
perhaps we should not delve too
deeply. A sense of humor may be
our only 'protection against
existential nausea.

Barclay Cooke & Jon Bradshaw
Backgammon: The Cruelest Game
Random House, $8.95
Swiftly following the rise in
popularity of any leisure-time
activity come shelves full of books
on the subject. Tennis' popularity
in the late 60s was followed by*
dozens of "how-to" books and
the exact same thing is happening
due to the revived interest in the
game of backgammon.
Backgammon: The Cruelest
Game is one of the few books on
the game that is of true value to
both the novice and the expert.
Despite its pretentious title, the
book is far different from the
regular pulp that profiteers
usually come out with.
Barclay Cooke, considered one
of the premier players of the
game, teamed with professional
writer Jon Bradshaw to produce
this clearly written text. Along
with Oswald Jacoby's definitive
book Backgammon, this belongs
on the bookshelf of all who are
interested in the game.
The book starts out with the
rules and basic moves of the
simple checkers-type game and
progresses steadily-but not too
swiftly for the beginner-all the
way through championship play.
The fact that an instruction
book of only 200 pages (including
many illustrations) can cover
material all the way from beginner
to expert is evidence of the game's
simplicity.
The only fault of the book is
that it seems to place too much
importance to the game. The title
is a clear overstatement of the
game's true import, but that's not
the only instance of
pretentiousness.
Each chapter begins with' a
quote by Karl von Clausewitz that
deals with actual war. Comparing
war to this simple game is ah,
unnecessary gimmick. The chapter
on "Basic Odds and Probabilities"
starts with von Clausewitz' quote
that "All action in war is directed
on probably, not on certidh
events." Surely the analogy of W&;
to backgammon is an unnecessary
gimmick.

BAKER'S SUBJECT—Patty (or Tania) Hearst is the subject of Bay Area reporter Marilyn Baker's book. On the left, Patty is seen posing in
front of the SLA's cobra flag, and on the right she is shown during a bank robbery. Both pictures were taken before six members of the SLA
died in a Los Angeles shootout.

/ Exclusive! The Inside Story
■ of Patricia Hearst and the SLA
Macmillan, $8.95
The tangled tale of Patty
Hearst and the Symbionese
Liberation Army is perfect
material for classic story-telling. It
I contains elements of practically
every human emotion and
experience: love, hate, fear,
adventure, mystery, good, evil,
courage, pathos, sex.
In short, it's a great story.
That's why it so thoroughly
jr dominated front pages for five
months earlier this year, and
that's why there are at least four
books on the subject scheduled to
appear soon.
One must hope the
forthcoming books will deal with
k the subject a little more
sensitively than does television
newswoman Marilyn Baker in her
crude, arrogant Exclusive! Never
before has a book made a better
case against the news industry;
anyone reading this book is bound
to come away believing that
[ journalists are silly, shallow,
pretentious jackasses.
And if all newsmen were like
Marilyn Baker, they'd be right.
Bay Area Reporter
Baker, now pontificating
nightly on KPIX in San Francisco,
i was a reporter for the Bay Area's
educational station, KQED,
during the frenzied days of the
SLA last spring. She headed
KQED's coverage, and did, for the
most part, a creditable job,
breaking several exclusives ahead
» of the pack.
' She did not as you might
assume after reading her book
single-handedly unmask and
corner the SLA. She did as you
would probably never guess from
the book make a couple of
dumb mistakes. In other words,
f she is a good journalist, but not
the Woodward and
Bernstein-variety superstar she
would like you to think she is.
But Baker's major fault as a
journalist is the same one that
undermines her book. She has an
} enormous Jehovah complex, and
constantly offers judgements on
anyone and anything that strikes
her fancy. That's a major problem
for a journalist, who is supposed
to be offering the public objective
reporting.
I Of course it's hard to follow a
story for any length of time
without forming some conclusions
but most reporters have enough
brains to keep their opinions to
themselves. When they do offer
public analysis of a story they're
covering, they usually try to keep
it restrained and tempered.
No Restrictions
Marilyn Baker observes no such
restrictions. On one newscast last
February, she turned to the
cameras and told the public the
SLA had no real interest in the
f people, but was pursuing some
personal vendetta against the
Hearst family. The ransom
demand that Randolph Hearst

feed California's poor was an
effort to humiliate him, Baker
said.
Not only was that a hasty,
overblown generalization and a
blatant intrusion of editorializing
in a theoretically objective
newscast, but in retrospect it
seems to be wrong. The free food
demand was an effort to make the
SLA look like a modern Robin
Hood; no one has ever uncovered
any evidence that the SLA hated
the Hearsts anymore than it hated
anyone who was rich.
Baker's book abounds with this
kind of thing. Once a neighbor of
SLA member Patricia Soltysik
refused to grant an interview.
Baker, apparently operating on
the premise that a press card is
license to indulge in boorish
behavior, bellowed:
"Look, lady, this is what I get
paid to do. Maybe I'm not clever,
but I don't live off food stamps or
welfare, and I sure as hell pay the
taxes that let people like you live
off them. Now all I want are some
simple answers to some straight
questions."
Tragic Tale
The SLA story is one of
tragedy seven people dead,
three underground, and many
others hiding in fear but
Marilyn Baker apparently can't
see the human side of the story.
She has no sympathy for anyone:
Steven Weed, who lost his fiancee
to a terrorist gang, Patty Hearst,

plunged into a nightmare world of
guns and fire or the six SLA
soldiers who committed suicide in
a misguided and futile cause.
Baker obviously hates anyone
with values different from hers.
She bitterly accuses Weed and
Patty of creating "their own
mini-Hillsborough" in Berkeley
and then goes off on a ranting,
ripping rampage against them.
After raging against lifestyle
and personalities for a while,
Baker gets around to their
sexuality: "Had any wonderful,
low animal moans of satisfaction
strained through Weed's mustache
or shuddered out of the thin
pressed lips that looked out at me
from the picture of Patricia
Campbell Hearst?"
Baker allows as how she doubts
it, and then offers, without a
shred of evidence or provocation,
what must be the crudest printed
remark of the year, if not the
century, when she describes Patty
as "a lover without orgasm."
Other Problems
There are a number of other
problems with this book. For one
thing, Baker never once mentions
any other journalist's contribution
to the Hearst investigation— and
neglects to mention that often
other media uncovered stories at
the same time she did but
withheld them for fear of
endangering Patty Hearst,
Time magazine, the San
Francisco Chronicle and the New
York Times all abandoned scoops

to Marilyn Baker at one time or
another; if they hadn't, her
reputation would never have
advanced to the point where she
could have written this book.
Nevertheless, despite all the
pettiness, arrogance and just plain
garbage in Exclusive!, the book
does have a compelling narrative.
The story of the SLA is an
exciting one, and not even a
writer of Baker's ineptitude can
overcome that. From start to
finish it's fascinating reading, with
the tension steadily rising until it
climaxes in a crescendo of gunfire
at the little house in Los Angeles
where police killed six SLA
members.
Baker's book can incorporate
this excitement far more
effectively because she was a part
of the Hearst story.
Unfortunately, that's also the
major flaw in the book: Baker's
presence and involvement with
the story. And until another
reporter who covered the story

this will remain the most
gripping material on the SLA. It
will probably remain the most

our only 'protection against
existential nausea.

Barclay Cooke & Jon Bradshaw
Backgammon: The Cruelest Game
Random House, $8.95
Swiftly following the rise in
popularity of any leisure-time
activity come shelves full of books
on the subject. Tennis' popularity
in the late 60s was followed by*
dozens of "how-to" books and
the exact same thing is happening
due to the revived interest in the
game of backgammon.
Backgammon: The Cruelest
Game is one of the few books on
the game that is of true value to
both the novice and the expert.
Despite its pretentious title, the
book is far different from the
regular pulp that profiteers
usually come out with.
Barclay Cooke, considered one
of the premier players of the
game, teamed with professional
writer Jon Bradshaw to produce
this clearly written text. Along
with Oswald Jacoby's definitive
book Backgammon, this belongs
on the bookshelf of all who are
interested in the game.
The book starts out with the
rules and basic moves of the
simple checkers-type game and
progresses steadily-but not too
swiftly for the beginner-all the
way through championship play.
The fact that an instruction
book of only 200 pages (including
many illustrations) can cover
material all the way from beginner
to expert is evidence of the game's
simplicity.
The only fault of the book is
that it seems to place too much
importance to the game. The title
is a clear overstatement of the
game's true import, but that's not
the only instance of
pretentiousness.
Each chapter begins with' a
quote by Karl von Clausewitz that
deals with actual war. Comparing
war to this simple game is ah,
unnecessary gimmick. The chapter
on "Basic Odds and Probabilities"
starts with von Clausewitz' quote
that "All action in war is directed
on probably, not on certidh
events." Surely the analogy of W&;
to backgammon is an unnecessary
gimmick.
