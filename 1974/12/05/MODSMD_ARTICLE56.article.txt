# Wonderful Show Studded With Hits
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
DALY CITY Energy.
Undiluted, never-ending,
contagious energy. It's amazing
how much of that a 24-year-old
blind dude with a whole lot of
talent can have. Truly a Wonder.
Stevie Wonder, to be exact.
For two and a half hours last
Friday, Stevie treated a sellout
Cow Palace crowd to a diverse
performance of fast, slow, old and
new music . . . and a display of
irrepressible enthusiasm.
He's an incredible human
dynamo. It's hard to believe that
he's been on our radios and record
players for the last 12 of his 24
years and yet hasn't managed to
wear himself out.
He's so vibrant on stage that it
sometimes looks as if his head is
going to be shaken right off of his
body. And the urge to get up and
dance around the stage struck him
several times during the show. For
a blind man, that's something!
Rufus: Mediocre
So what if the warm-up group
Rufus ("Tell Me Something
Good") was mediocre at best? So
what if the three women singers
of Stevie's backup group
Wonderlove had voices that were
too shrill and that didn't blend
well with his? So what if the
speaker system distorted the
music?
The man is such a true
entertainer that these flaws in the
show just didn't seem to matter
much. He knows when to be cool.
He knows when to be warm. He
knows when to be funny or
sincere. The guy's got class.
Not to mention ability. The
variety in the kinds of music that
he successfully writes and
performs sometimes makes it hard
to believe that the same fellow is
doing it all.
Disjointed Start
Although the beginning of his
Cow Palace performance seemed
rather disjointed and aimless, he
very quickly launched into songs
which gave the concert direction.
He often played several songs
back-to-back, but* the transitions
between songs were always
perfect, adding a pleasing flow to
the performance.
The Billy Preston-style
wah-wah organ sound, which
Wonder has grown increasingly
fond of, surfaced early in the

concert on "Higher Ground," a
song well suited to his singing
style of sliding his voice over each
word and syllable.
Old Songs Lively
Even the older Wondersongs,
such as "Signed, Sealed,
Delivered, I'm Yours" and "I Was
Made To Love Her," were
performed with the same
excitement and verve as if he were
singing them for the first time.
He was able to poke fun at
himself as well. Adopting an
announcer's voice to introduce
one of his songs, Stevie said
mockingly, "We never expected
Stevie Wonder to last that long.
He was supposed to be washed up
by now." But he also displayed a
missionary side, talking about his
wish for "a greater love between
all people" without becoming too
maudlin.
Most importantly, though,
Stevie has fun. And the audience
has fun.
Humorous Medley
He performed a humorous
medley of old songs during which
he played piano and acted as DJ.
Starting with a mock version of
"Earth Angel," the medley ended
with his own most golden oldie
"Fingertips" which he recorded
when he was 12.
One thing that makes Stevie
such a great entertainer is the way
he always keeps several steps
ahead of his audience. The crowd
never knows where he is going to
turn next and therefore he
completely captures its interest.
And even though he had
already played masterfully for
two full hours, the best was still
to come. A back-to-back series of
"Don't You Worry 'Bout a
Thing," "You Haven't Done
Nothin'," and "Living for the
City" built the crowd into a
throbbing, gyrating mass. And the
final two numbers, "Sunshine of
My Life" and "Superstition"
climaxed in a wild, dancing
fade-out.
There was no attempt at an
encore: the crowd didn't need
one, it was glutted and exhausted.
But Stevie sure wasn't. Up to
the final second, he was as lively
as ever, jumping up and down,
smiling, waving and just plain
living his way off the stage and
into memory.

The man is such a true
entertainer that these flaws in the
show just didn't seem to matter
much. He knows when to be cool.
He knows when to be warm. He
knows when to be funny or
sincere. The guy's got class.
Not to mention ability. The
variety in the kinds of music that
he successfully writes and
performs sometimes makes it hard
to believe that the same fellow is
doing it all.
Disjointed Start
Although the beginning of his
Cow Palace performance seemed
rather disjointed and aimless, he
very quickly launched into songs
which gave the concert direction.
He often played several songs
back-to-back, but* the transitions
between songs were always
perfect, adding a pleasing flow to
the performance.
The Billy Preston-style
wah-wah organ sound, which
Wonder has grown increasingly
fond of, surfaced early in the

concert on "Higher Ground," a
song well suited to his singing
style of sliding his voice over each
word and syllable.
Old Songs Lively
Even the older Wondersongs,
such as "Signed, Sealed,
Delivered, I'm Yours" and "I Was
Made To Love Her," were
performed with the same
excitement and verve as if he were
singing them for the first time.
He was able to poke fun at
himself as well. Adopting an
announcer's voice to introduce
one of his songs, Stevie said
mockingly, "We never expected
Stevie Wonder to last that long.
He was supposed to be washed up
by now." But he also displayed a
missionary side, talking about his
wish for "a greater love between
all people" without becoming too
maudlin.
Most importantly, though,
Stevie has fun. And the audience
has fun.
Humorous Medley
He performed a humorous
medley of old songs during which
he played piano and acted as DJ.
Starting with a mock version of
"Earth Angel," the medley ended
with his own most golden oldie
"Fingertips" which he recorded
when he was 12.
One thing that makes Stevie
such a great entertainer is the way
he always keeps several steps
ahead of his audience. The crowd
never knows where he is going to
turn next and therefore he
completely captures its interest.
And even though he had
already played masterfully for
two full hours, the best was still
to come. A back-to-back series of
"Don't You Worry 'Bout a
Thing," "You Haven't Done
Nothin'," and "Living for the
City" built the crowd into a
throbbing, gyrating mass. And the
final two numbers, "Sunshine of
My Life" and "Superstition"
climaxed in a wild, dancing
fade-out.
There was no attempt at an
encore: the crowd didn't need
one, it was glutted and exhausted.
But Stevie sure wasn't. Up to
the final second, he was as lively
as ever, jumping up and down,
smiling, waving and just plain
living his way off the stage and
into memory.
DALY CITY Energy.
Undiluted, never-ending,
contagious energy. It's amazing
how much of that a 24-year-old
blind dude with a whole lot of
talent can have. Truly a Wonder.
Stevie Wonder, to be exact.
For two and a half hours last
Friday, Stevie treated a sellout
Cow Palace crowd to a diverse
performance of fast, slow, old and
new music . . . and a display of
irrepressible enthusiasm.
He's an incredible human
dynamo. It's hard to believe that
he's been on our radios and record
players for the last 12 of his 24
years and yet hasn't managed to
wear himself out.
He's so vibrant on stage that it
sometimes looks as if his head is
going to be shaken right off of his
body. And the urge to get up and
dance around the stage struck him
several times during the show. For
a blind man, that's something!
Rufus: Mediocre
So what if the warm-up group
Rufus ("Tell Me Something
Good") was mediocre at best? So
what if the three women singers
of Stevie's backup group
Wonderlove had voices that were
too shrill and that didn't blend
well with his? So what if the
speaker system distorted the
music?

one of his songs, Stevie said
mockingly, "We never expected
Stevie Wonder to last that long.
He was supposed to be washed up
by now." But he also displayed a
missionary side, talking about his
wish for "a greater love between
all people" without becoming too
maudlin.
Most importantly, though,
Stevie has fun. And the audience
has fun.
Humorous Medley
He performed a humorous
medley of old songs during which
he played piano and acted as DJ.
Starting with a mock version of
"Earth Angel," the medley ended
with his own most golden oldie
"Fingertips" which he recorded
when he was 12.
One thing that makes Stevie
such a great entertainer is the way
he always keeps several steps
ahead of his audience. The crowd
never knows where he is going to
turn next and therefore he
completely captures its interest.
And even though he had
already played masterfully for
two full hours, the best was still
to come. A back-to-back series of
"Don't You Worry 'Bout a
Thing," "You Haven't Done
Nothin'," and "Living for the
City" built the crowd into a
throbbing, gyrating mass. And the
final two numbers, "Sunshine of
My Life" and "Superstition"
climaxed in a wild, dancing
fade-out.
There was no attempt at an
encore: the crowd didn't need
one, it was glutted and exhausted.
But Stevie sure wasn't. Up to
the final second, he was as lively
as ever, jumping up and down,
smiling, waving and just plain
living his way off the stage and
into memory.
