# Art Exhibit: Powerful
## 
### BARBARA HEINS 
It is impossible to view the
work of Kathe Kollowitz and
remain unaffected. The Stanford
Museum is now showing a
comprehensive exhibition of her
woodcuts, etchings and
lithographs which, taken as a
whole, stand as one of the most
powerful indictments of war and
suffering ever made. But the
works, classified as degenerate by
the Nazi regime, display a
> technical skill and virtuosity
which goes beyond their message
and stamps the artist as one of the
greatest graphic artists of all time.
Kathe Kollowitz was born in
1867 in Koenigsberg, East Prussia.
Her life was characterized by a
r series of personal losses. She was
refused the gold medal by Kaiser
Wilhelm I for her Weavers series
because he felt it was "gutter art."
Her youngest son was killed in
World War I, and her husband
died in 1940. Hitler had all of her
work confiscated and banned
from exhibition, her grandson was
killed in World War II and her
house was totally demolished by
bombing.
Following in the footsteps of
artists such as Goya and Gericault,
Kollowitz took the role of artist
as moral conscience of the
society, committed, involved.
From the beginning she saw
herself as protagonist for the poor
and oppressed. She believed that
her life should be devoted to
portraying this suffering and in so
doing possibly effect change. In
1944 she wrote in her diary,
"Pacifism simply is not a matter
of calm looking on; it is work,
hard work."
Every Phase
The exhibition of her work at
, Stanford is an exciting one
because every phase of her major
work is represented. The show
begins with several small early
etchings. In 1893 the artist
attended a private performance of
the revolutionary play The
Weavers. This had a large impact
on her work and thinking. From
1895 to 1898 she worked on a
series of etchings entitled, The
Weavers' Revolt and began her
continuing pre-occupation with
the theme of the exploitation of
the workers,
i This early major series, highly
detailed with clearly delineated
faces and individualization began
her reputation. In a work
completed soon after called
Downtrodden a mother sits

staring unseeingly ahead, face
grimly set while her gnarled hands
cradle the head of her sleeping
child. Beside them the
grief-stricken father stands, face
hidden by one hand, a length of
rope in the other.
The artist's concern with the
oppressed lower classes grew and
in 1908 she began one of her
finest series, The Peasant's War,
which dramatize the 16th century
rebellion in Germany. The
individuals of the earlier works
give way now to the mass or the
symbolic figure in her later works.
Leftist
During the 1920's millions of
Germans were suffering from
malnutrition. The artist joined the
leftist Workers Aid movement to
raise funds for food. She made
several posters to protest social
and working conditions.
Soon after this she began her
War series which depicts the
effects of war on the woman, as
wife and mother. In one work the
parents huddle together for
comfort in their grief. In other
works the widow, left alone, hugs
herself or joins a group for
support.
In the final place the people,
faces hard, closed, some crazy,
stand alone, suspicious of each
other. Only the face of a small
child peering from inside his
mother's coat gives a sense of
hope to the series.
Style Change
In this War series the gradual
stylistic change in Kathe
Kollowitz's work is most evident.
The early naturalism has now
given way to massive, simplified
forms of expressionism. The
specific incident is no longer
portrayed; instead these works
represent the eternal, continual
suffering of man.
In her last of a series of self
portraits, she depicts herself in old
age. Her still determined head
sinks in her hunched shoulders,
wispy ghost-like lines surround
her image as though part of her
has already passed away. Her skin
is leathery and textured like the
grain of old wood. Around this
time she says of her life, "War
goes with me to the end." What
comes through her work in the
end, however, is not just the
misery and suffering she spent a
lifetime portraying, but a sense of
respect for the dignity of life.
The exhibition will continue at
the Stanford Art Museum through
Jan. 19.

War series which depicts the
effects of war on the woman, as
wife and mother. In one work the
parents huddle together for
comfort in their grief. In other
works the widow, left alone, hugs
herself or joins a group for
support.
In the final place the people,
faces hard, closed, some crazy,
stand alone, suspicious of each
other. Only the face of a small
child peering from inside his
mother's coat gives a sense of
hope to the series.
Style Change
In this War series the gradual
stylistic change in Kathe
Kollowitz's work is most evident.
The early naturalism has now
given way to massive, simplified
forms of expressionism. The
specific incident is no longer
portrayed; instead these works
represent the eternal, continual
suffering of man.
In her last of a series of self
portraits, she depicts herself in old
age. Her still determined head
sinks in her hunched shoulders,
wispy ghost-like lines surround
her image as though part of her
has already passed away. Her skin
is leathery and textured like the
grain of old wood. Around this
time she says of her life, "War
goes with me to the end." What
comes through her work in the
end, however, is not just the
misery and suffering she spent a
lifetime portraying, but a sense of
respect for the dignity of life.
The exhibition will continue at
the Stanford Art Museum through
Jan. 19.

SOME OF THE BIZARRE—Actors from the second drama
department production of the school year are seen in one of the
scenes from Electra, which was performed last week in the Nitery.
It is impossible to view the
work of Kathe Kollowitz and
remain unaffected. The Stanford
Museum is now showing a
comprehensive exhibition of her
woodcuts, etchings and
lithographs which, taken as a
whole, stand as one of the most
powerful indictments of war and
suffering ever made. But the
works, classified as degenerate by
the Nazi regime, display a
> technical skill and virtuosity
which goes beyond their message
and stamps the artist as one of the
greatest graphic artists of all time.
Kathe Kollowitz was born in
1867 in Koenigsberg, East Prussia.
Her life was characterized by a
r series of personal losses. She was
refused the gold medal by Kaiser
Wilhelm I for her Weavers series
because he felt it was "gutter art."
Her youngest son was killed in
World War I, and her husband
died in 1940. Hitler had all of her
work confiscated and banned
from exhibition, her grandson was
killed in World War II and her
house was totally demolished by
bombing.
Following in the footsteps of
artists such as Goya and Gericault,
Kollowitz took the role of artist
as moral conscience of the
society, committed, involved.
From the beginning she saw
herself as protagonist for the poor
and oppressed. She believed that
her life should be devoted to
portraying this suffering and in so
doing possibly effect change. In
1944 she wrote in her diary,
"Pacifism simply is not a matter
of calm looking on; it is work,
hard work."
Every Phase
The exhibition of her work at
, Stanford is an exciting one
because every phase of her major
work is represented. The show
begins with several small early
etchings. In 1893 the artist
attended a private performance of
the revolutionary play The
Weavers. This had a large impact
on her work and thinking. From
1895 to 1898 she worked on a
series of etchings entitled, The
Weavers' Revolt and began her
continuing pre-occupation with
the theme of the exploitation of
the workers,
i This early major series, highly
detailed with clearly delineated
faces and individualization began
her reputation. In a work
completed soon after called
Downtrodden a mother sits

staring unseeingly ahead, face
grimly set while her gnarled hands
cradle the head of her sleeping
child. Beside them the
grief-stricken father stands, face
hidden by one hand, a length of
rope in the other.
The artist's concern with the
oppressed lower classes grew and
in 1908 she began one of her
finest series, The Peasant's War,
which dramatize the 16th century
rebellion in Germany. The
individuals of the earlier works
give way now to the mass or the
symbolic figure in her later works.
Leftist
During the 1920's millions of
Germans were suffering from
malnutrition. The artist joined the
leftist Workers Aid movement to
raise funds for food. She made
several posters to protest social
and working conditions.

"Pacifism simply is not a matter
of calm looking on; it is work,
hard work."
Every Phase
The exhibition of her work at
, Stanford is an exciting one
because every phase of her major
work is represented. The show
begins with several small early
etchings. In 1893 the artist
attended a private performance of
the revolutionary play The
Weavers. This had a large impact
on her work and thinking. From
1895 to 1898 she worked on a
series of etchings entitled, The
Weavers' Revolt and began her
continuing pre-occupation with
the theme of the exploitation of
the workers,
i This early major series, highly
detailed with clearly delineated
faces and individualization began
her reputation. In a work
completed soon after called
Downtrodden a mother sits

staring unseeingly ahead, face
grimly set while her gnarled hands
cradle the head of her sleeping
child. Beside them the
grief-stricken father stands, face
hidden by one hand, a length of
rope in the other.
The artist's concern with the
oppressed lower classes grew and
in 1908 she began one of her
finest series, The Peasant's War,
which dramatize the 16th century
rebellion in Germany. The
individuals of the earlier works
give way now to the mass or the
symbolic figure in her later works.
Leftist
During the 1920's millions of
Germans were suffering from
malnutrition. The artist joined the
leftist Workers Aid movement to
raise funds for food. She made
several posters to protest social
and working conditions.
Soon after this she began her
War series which depicts the
effects of war on the woman, as
wife and mother. In one work the
parents huddle together for
comfort in their grief. In other
works the widow, left alone, hugs
herself or joins a group for
support.
In the final place the people,
faces hard, closed, some crazy,
stand alone, suspicious of each
other. Only the face of a small
child peering from inside his
mother's coat gives a sense of
hope to the series.
Style Change
In this War series the gradual
stylistic change in Kathe
Kollowitz's work is most evident.
The early naturalism has now
given way to massive, simplified
forms of expressionism. The
specific incident is no longer
portrayed; instead these works
represent the eternal, continual
suffering of man.
In her last of a series of self
portraits, she depicts herself in old
age. Her still determined head
sinks in her hunched shoulders,
wispy ghost-like lines surround
her image as though part of her
has already passed away. Her skin
is leathery and textured like the
grain of old wood. Around this
time she says of her life, "War
goes with me to the end." What
comes through her work in the
end, however, is not just the
misery and suffering she spent a
lifetime portraying, but a sense of
respect for the dignity of life.
The exhibition will continue at
the Stanford Art Museum through
Jan. 19.

It is impossible to view the
work of Kathe Kollowitz and
remain unaffected. The Stanford
Museum is now showing a
comprehensive exhibition of her
woodcuts, etchings and
lithographs which, taken as a
whole, stand as one of the most
powerful indictments of war and
suffering ever made. But the
works, classified as degenerate by
the Nazi regime, display a
> technical skill and virtuosity
which goes beyond their message
and stamps the artist as one of the
greatest graphic artists of all time.
Kathe Kollowitz was born in
1867 in Koenigsberg, East Prussia.
Her life was characterized by a
r series of personal losses. She was
refused the gold medal by Kaiser
Wilhelm I for her Weavers series
because he felt it was "gutter art."
Her youngest son was killed in
World War I, and her husband
died in 1940. Hitler had all of her
work confiscated and banned
from exhibition, her grandson was
killed in World War II and her
house was totally demolished by
bombing.
Following in the footsteps of
artists such as Goya and Gericault,
Kollowitz took the role of artist
as moral conscience of the
society, committed, involved.
From the beginning she saw
herself as protagonist for the poor
and oppressed. She believed that
her life should be devoted to
portraying this suffering and in so
doing possibly effect change. In
1944 she wrote in her diary,
"Pacifism simply is not a matter
of calm looking on; it is work,
hard work."
