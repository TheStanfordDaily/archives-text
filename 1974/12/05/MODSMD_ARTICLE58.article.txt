# Drama Play A Little Bizarre

### ALVIN CHARLES KATZ 
Those who were able to get tickets for the
Stanford Drama Department's Electra last week
saw a production that was at once unusually
interpreted, brilliantly executed and regrettably
pretentious.
Director Ellen Mease presumably selected this
unfamiliar version of the familiar story which was
written by Hugo von Hofmannsthal as the libretto
for the Richard Strauss opera of the same name
because there is no interpretation associated with
it. On this formless work Mease imposed her own
perceptions and sensibilities; the result is a
production that succeeded on some levels, but
failed miserably on others.
In contrast to the customary classical
interpretation the story suggests, Mease chose a
primitive one, seeking to create a gut level
emotional experience. Her production was liberally
laced with Freudian sexual and psychological
imagery, and nearly all the dialogue was punctuated
with moaning, wailing, and various percussive
noises. The cast, many of whom were intended to
represent various facets of Electra's character,
writhed and slithered with every word and line that
the characters howled and shouted.
Indeed, the current production of Electra was a
great deal more like dramatic calisthenics than it
was immensely effective; strung together, the
finished product was emotionless and consequently

meaningless. This was an interpretation with no
peaks and valleys, but instead a continuous flow of
trauma. Half lit scenes of misery and psychological
distress are effective when interwoven with
contrasting emotional levels. In sequence, they
become ineffective, tedious and even irritating.
Technically, Electra was nothing short of
superlative. The entire cast displayed excellent
ensemble, although burdened with the stylized
movements and vocal excercises Mease had given
them. Nearly all remained on stage and in character
at all times, and demonstrated remarkable agility
and control in crawling around on Richard
Riddell's highly functional and suitably murky set.
In the title role, Caryn West delivered a strong, if
slightly overstated performance. The role is a
grueling one, and West displayed remarkable
strength and endurance, performing evenly from
beginning to end. She received good supporting
performances from Susan Erlich, Jane Valentine,
Richard Jennings and Sam Ambler as other
characters. All the principals showed good range;
unfortunately, Mease's relentless emotional pitch
gave them little chance to utilize it.
As an exercise in dramatic technique Electra was
quite successful; as a meaningful dramatic
experience, it fell somewhat wide of the mark. I
can't help but think it a shame that with the highly
talented group that Mease assembled, she might
have staged a much more satisfying and enjoyable
theatrical event.
