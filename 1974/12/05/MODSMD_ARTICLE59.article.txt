### DAN FORTE 
"If this life is drivin' you to
drink,
You're sittin' around
wonderin' just what to think,
Well, I've got some
consolation, I'll give it to you if I
might.
Y'know I don't worry about a
thing cos I know nothin's goin' to
be all right."
—Mose Allison
Of the countless different
types of music that've been
performed and recorded, there are
only two categories which as a
whole have been commercially
successful: rock and Pop.
In the eyes of the record
company executives, all other,
idioms have had to take a back
seat, jazz included.
Rock fans who have ever
bothered to read the
parenthesis-ed names under song
titles on their favorite records
may be familiar with Mose Allison
(if only by name). Most jazz fans
have been hip to him for nearly
20 years.
Mose, a native of Tippo,
Mississippi, now 47, authored
such "rock hits" as "Young Man
Blues" (The Who), "Smashed"
(Leon Russell), "Everybody's
Cry in' Mercy" (Bonnie Raitt) and
"Parchman Farm" (John Mayall,

Blue Cheer, etc.).
Mose's ironic, sometimes biting
lyrics seem to speak well for the
type of music he plays, to the
point where one of his albums
referred to him as the "Jazz sage."
Aside from his composing
talents, Mose's relaxed, bluesy
delivery of the lyrics, combined
with a sophisticated, close to
free-form piano technique make
him one of modern jazz' most
influential figures.
Not only have his songs made
their way to the ears of rock fans,
he is also one of very few white
jazz artists to exercise a big
influence on black -musicians,
both jazz and blues idioms
where the reverse is usually the
rule.
The following interview was
taped Nov. 19 at San Francisco's
El Matador:

Are you as cynical as your lyrics
might reflect?
I don't really think they're
cynical. I hear that a lot. I don't
think they're cynical, because
cynicism is like a completely
pessimistic thing, like "I'm dead."
And I don't ever say that.
My thing is that you get
knocked down a lot but you can
always get up. And that's the

difference. I consider them
virtually positive; its just the way
you interpret, you know. I just
consider them realism.
What is it. that you try to
communicate in your lyrics and
music?
You don't really know, man. It
took me a long time to realize
that, but I don't really know what
I'm doin'. It starts out as just
things that appeal to you, then
you pick up on some things that
you like, and you put 'em all
together and somethin' else comes
out.
So what you eventually do is
all tied up in what you like
yourself and what your natural
abilities are. So, I don't try to
analyze it that much.
Basically, what you do is create
an illusion an illusion of
originality. But, nothin's original
really. If you want to take
everybody apart and analyze
them, and slice it up, you'll find
that something came from over
here, and something else from
over there. Like nothin's original
in a strict sense.
What a person does is try to
put these things together and
create some sort of personality
that wasn't there before.
Do you occasionally hear people
that remind you of yourself?
Oh, yeah, all the time. Well,
my vocal style has been picked up
on by a lot of the younger people.
And it's flattering, you know, to
hear somebody that sounds like
you.
It doesn't matter if you're
tryin' to copy someone; everyone
starts out trying to copy
somebody. But, what matters is
whether you've got the talent to
go on from there or not. So, the
fact that you were copying
somebody isn't really cause to be
put down or praised; it's just a
stage.
What do you think about the rock
groups picking up on your tunes?

Well, that's nice, that's
gratifying. As far as the practical
side of it, I make more money out
of those things than I do on my
own records. Man, the Who's
version of "Young Man" ( Live at
Leeds) made me more bread in
mechanical royalties than all of
my stuff put together.
Have you heard the rock versions?
The Who's I only heard once,
so I can't really evaluate it. Some
of the things for instance
Bonnie Raitt's version of
"Everybody's Cry in' Mercy," I
heard that several times, and I like
the way she did that. I haven't
heard Leon Russell's things on
"Smashed" yet either.
Are you still with Atlantic
Records?
That's a good question. A lot
of their distributors don't know
that I am (sarcastically).
Technically I'm still with Atlantic,
yeah, but right now I'm trying to
decide whether to go along and do
another album or what. I'm pretty
discouraged with that.
They want me to do something
with background, which is the
way they do all their "sellers."
(Two of Mose's more recent
Atlantic LPs, Hello There,
Universe and Western Man,
featured big band backup and
electric piano, respectively, for a
change of pace from the usual
trio.
What bothers you most about
record companies, their control?
Well, they don't have any more
control over you than you allow
them to have. I mean the thing
that bothers me about the record
company is that they haven't
made any effort to sell me as I
am. The thing that drags me is
that they just assume you can't
make it like you are; you have to
be changed into some sort of
version of what they think is
acceptable. That's what I don't
like, and that's always been the
trouble with me and record
companies.
My point is I've been doin' this
now for 20-somethin' years, and
right now I'm probably doin' as
well as I've ever done. I've got as
much work as I can take at the
moment, so I must be doin'
somethin' that somebody likes. I
feel that the record company
could've done a much better job
on the records just as they were
without having to soup them up
in any way.

I'm sort of at a stand-off with
the record company. It's strictly
investment-return, just a
corporate venture. And they don't
have much . imagination. What
they want is somethin' pretty
much like what sold last year, and
maybe just a little different
somethin' that's got all the
elements that were hot last year.
So, in that way they sort of
impose a mediocrity thing on it.
Who were some of your early
musical heroes and influences?
It goes back so far, Some pf
my early heroes were Louis
Armstrong, Fats Waller, Lester
Young and Errol Garner, Nat
Cole. A lot of the bebop players
A1 Haig, Bud Powell, John Lewis,
Thelonius Monk. Then the blues
singers: Muddy Waters is one of
my favorites, and Percy Mayfield
(father of Curtis) had a lot of
influence on my vocal style. He
wrote a lot of good tunes. He
never did get too well known, but
I really like the way he sang.
Some "Jazz Purists" have such a
"Pure" view of jazz that it comes
out fascist. Were you ever a victim
of the idea that whites can't play
jazz?
Not much. But I started doin'
it before all the social ferment
started. I was doin' the blues in
the early 50s. And I hung out
with black musicians down south
all the time and I never did have
any problem. When I got to New
York in the late 50s there was like
a lot of Jim Crow feeling. It was
there and always poppin' up, but I
didn't bear too much from it, cos
some of the better black players
gave me "testimonials." I think it
hurt some guys, but it didn't hurt
me.
Every now and then I get that
I got it up at Harvard a couple
of times, like the reverse racism
thing. It never has bothered
too, much, though. I figure if
black guys can take the pressure
in the society, I oughta be able to
take it in the jazz world.

Mose's most recent LP, Mose
In Your Ear, was recorded live at
Palo Alto's one-time night spot, In
Your Ear, in 1971.
"Don't waste your time try in'
to be a big winner;
If you get fat somebody else
gets thinner.
Y'know there 's always
somebody play in' with dynamite.
But I don't worry 'bout a thing
cos I know nothin's goin' to be all
right."
