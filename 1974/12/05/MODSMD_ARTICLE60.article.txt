# Why Aren't There More Black.Stanford Athletes ?
## 
### 
It s a question you have to ask yourself as a
coach: Can I win without black players? It's
just like flying airplanes. If everybody is flying
jets, you can't be stuck flying props."
—Bill Moultrie, former Stanford
assistant football coach
By CHRIS BAKER
The Stanford football team, to use
Moultrie's analogy, has been flying prop
planes. This season, the Cardinals had the
lowest number of blacks on any traveling
squad in the Pacific Eight seven (see
accompanying list).
Stanford was also a distant last in the
number of blacks in starting positions one.
Other sports were even worse. Last season,
there was only one black on the baseball
team. There are three blacks on this year's
basketball team, and two of them are in their
senior seasons.
The situation obviously affects the
performance of Cardinal athletic teams. For
example, it's probably not coincidence that
USC, champion of the Pac-8 this season, has
nine black starters on defense.
Why aren't there more black athletes at
Stanford? One standard answer is that many
cannot meet the academic requirements here.
But many of the black athletes and coaches
questioned by the Daily thought that other
facts deter black athletes from the Farm
factors that Stanford could largely eliminate.
Football coach Jack Christiansen, who
presides over what wide receiver Tony Hill
calls "a very happy atmosphere" between
black and white players, thinks academics is
the chief reason for the relative dearth of

blacks on his team.
"When we recruit a Jim McAlister or
Kermit Johnson, we have to see whether we
have a curriculum they could have success in.
The big thing is continuity. As coaches we like
to know whether we can plan on having a
player for four years, not one who will flunk

out of school," Christiansen said.
"Sometimes you look on other rosters and
see a player like Shelton Diggs [USC flanker].
It's not thai; we didn't recruit them, but that
they didn't fit into our admission standards,"
Christiansen said.
But others don't think this is the whole
story. A source close to the athletic
department said, "I think it's hard recruiting
minorities for Stanford. It has nothing to do
with education. When you recruit minority
athletes, most of them satisfy the academic
requirements. It just has to do with how
they're treated."
A factor that works against Stanford is the
lack of black coaches. Moultrie left the
Stanford football program after the 1972
season and wasn't replaced until this summer.

Moultrie said this probably hurt the recruiting
of blacks. "I think this would be a factor. But
since I'm not there I can't say."
Aide To Aide
There is now a black assistant, special teams
coach Willie Show. But running back Ron
Inge said of Shaw, "He came in as an assistant
to an assistant. If he had come in as an
assistant coach with some responsibility, it
would be different." (Shaw is currently
recruiting in Southern California and could
not be reached for comment.)
But freshman receiver James Lofton said,
"I think , we recognize him [Shaw] as an
adviser."
Hill said that having a black coach is
definitely an advantage. "I didn't have a black
coach in high school. Just after talking with
Shaw, I can identify with him."
Hill chose Stanford despite the fact that
USC's black assistant coach Willie Brown,
seriously recruited him.
"Tony's a personal friend of the family but
he went to Stanford because he's a wide
receiver and Stanford throws the ball," Brown
said. "I think the players look at the situation
[how they would fit into the offense] and
decide for themselves."
Not Great For Backs
This, of course, could explain why
Stanford, with rare exceptions such as Ron
Inge, does not get the top-flight black running
backs.
"For a running back, this isn't the greatest
place to come," Inge said. "It's a
predominantly white school and unless you're
goal-oriented [lnge is a human biology major]

this isn't your first choice."
Does the fact that Stanford is a mostly
white school located in a suburban
environment adversely affect the recruiting of
blacks?
• Lofton thinks so. "When I came up here
last year [as a recruit] they told me they were
having the biggest social event of the year. I
saw it and said 'what?' "
Cal assistant coach Johnny Johnson, who
received his master's degree from Stanford,
said that social life in Southern California is
more appealing for black athletes. "Once in a
while, they [black athletes] like to go back to
the community. So they feel a little more
comfortable down there. When I was in school
we weren't as aware as today's athlete."
But USC's Brown, while admitting "the
social situation there [at Stanford] probably
has something to do with" the lack of black
athletes, thinks that isn't a major factor.
"By and large social life is probably easier
for football players because they're in the
limelight. Interracial dating is also easier," for
the football player, Brown said.
In addition to academic, social and
coaching factors, the general reputation of
Stanford among blacks is not equivalent to
that of USC.
The same source quoted earlier said high
school coaches don't recommend Stanford to
their black players.
"When I was recruiting for Stanford in
Southern California, most of the coaches
wouldn't refer players to me. I only had about
three coaches who would recommend people
to me."

Inge said that "USC has a better reputation
among blacks. It's an exposure thing. You see
USC with a lot of blacks starting and then you
see Stanford."
Trojan tailback Anthony Davis said USC's
reputation among black athletes is
"tremendous."
Successful black athletes such as Davis
recruit others to the school. For example, Hill
has said he came to Stanford and became a
wide receiver because Gene Washington talked
him into it.
Washington, like Hill, is a Long Beach
native who switched form quarterback to end
while at Stanford.
Hill said, "I really think we need more
blacks. If you see no blacks, there's a lack of
something. Having more black players gives
you something to relate to."
Some Disagree
But not all would like to see an increase in
recruiting of black athletes. One who
wouldn't is Henry Organ of the General
Secretary's Office, who in 1972-73 led a
SWOPSI workshop on varsity athletics, the
black community and Stanford.
"Since there is no effort to recruit black
students generally," Organ said, "there should
be no effort to recruit black athletes."
And results of a survey conducted by the
SWOPSI workshop would seem to bear him
out. When asked what' attention should be
given to recruiting black non-athletes as
compared with black athletes, 45 percent of
the 38 persons sampled said it should be the
same, and 18 percent said it should be less.
But most Stanford rooters would rather fly
first class.

of blacks. "I think this would be a factor. But
since I'm not there I can't say."
Aide To Aide
There is now a black assistant, special teams
coach Willie Show. But running back Ron
Inge said of Shaw, "He came in as an assistant
to an assistant. If he had come in as an
assistant coach with some responsibility, it
would be different." (Shaw is currently
recruiting in Southern California and could
not be reached for comment.)
But freshman receiver James Lofton said,
"I think , we recognize him [Shaw] as an
adviser."
Hill said that having a black coach is
definitely an advantage. "I didn't have a black
coach in high school. Just after talking with
Shaw, I can identify with him."
Hill chose Stanford despite the fact that
USC's black assistant coach Willie Brown,
seriously recruited him.
"Tony's a personal friend of the family but
he went to Stanford because he's a wide
receiver and Stanford throws the ball," Brown
said. "I think the players look at the situation
[how they would fit into the offense] and
decide for themselves."
Not Great For Backs
This, of course, could explain why
Stanford, with rare exceptions such as Ron
Inge, does not get the top-flight black running
backs.
"For a running back, this isn't the greatest
place to come," Inge said. "It's a
predominantly white school and unless you're
goal-oriented [lnge is a human biology major]

this isn't your first choice."
Does the fact that Stanford is a mostly
white school located in a suburban
environment adversely affect the recruiting of
blacks?
• Lofton thinks so. "When I came up here
last year [as a recruit] they told me they were
having the biggest social event of the year. I
saw it and said 'what?' "
Cal assistant coach Johnny Johnson, who
received his master's degree from Stanford,
said that social life in Southern California is
more appealing for black athletes. "Once in a
while, they [black athletes] like to go back to
the community. So they feel a little more
comfortable down there. When I was in school
we weren't as aware as today's athlete."
But USC's Brown, while admitting "the
social situation there [at Stanford] probably
has something to do with" the lack of black
athletes, thinks that isn't a major factor.
"By and large social life is probably easier
for football players because they're in the
limelight. Interracial dating is also easier," for
the football player, Brown said.
In addition to academic, social and
coaching factors, the general reputation of
Stanford among blacks is not equivalent to
that of USC.
The same source quoted earlier said high
school coaches don't recommend Stanford to
their black players.
"When I was recruiting for Stanford in
Southern California, most of the coaches
wouldn't refer players to me. I only had about
three coaches who would recommend people
to me."

Inge said that "USC has a better reputation
among blacks. It's an exposure thing. You see
USC with a lot of blacks starting and then you
see Stanford."
Trojan tailback Anthony Davis said USC's
reputation among black athletes is
"tremendous."
Successful black athletes such as Davis
recruit others to the school. For example, Hill
has said he came to Stanford and became a
wide receiver because Gene Washington talked
him into it.
Washington, like Hill, is a Long Beach
native who switched form quarterback to end
while at Stanford.
Hill said, "I really think we need more
blacks. If you see no blacks, there's a lack of
something. Having more black players gives
you something to relate to."
Some Disagree
But not all would like to see an increase in
recruiting of black athletes. One who
wouldn't is Henry Organ of the General
Secretary's Office, who in 1972-73 led a
SWOPSI workshop on varsity athletics, the
black community and Stanford.
"Since there is no effort to recruit black
students generally," Organ said, "there should
be no effort to recruit black athletes."
And results of a survey conducted by the
SWOPSI workshop would seem to bear him
out. When asked what' attention should be
given to recruiting black non-athletes as
compared with black athletes, 45 percent of
the 38 persons sampled said it should be the
same, and 18 percent said it should be less.
But most Stanford rooters would rather fly
first class.

It s a question you have to ask yourself as a
coach: Can I win without black players? It's
just like flying airplanes. If everybody is flying
jets, you can't be stuck flying props."
—Bill Moultrie, former Stanford
assistant football coach
By CHRIS BAKER
The Stanford football team, to use
Moultrie's analogy, has been flying prop
planes. This season, the Cardinals had the
lowest number of blacks on any traveling
squad in the Pacific Eight seven (see
accompanying list).
Stanford was also a distant last in the
number of blacks in starting positions one.
Other sports were even worse. Last season,
there was only one black on the baseball
team. There are three blacks on this year's
basketball team, and two of them are in their
senior seasons.
The situation obviously affects the
performance of Cardinal athletic teams. For
example, it's probably not coincidence that
USC, champion of the Pac-8 this season, has
nine black starters on defense.
Why aren't there more black athletes at
Stanford? One standard answer is that many
cannot meet the academic requirements here.
But many of the black athletes and coaches
questioned by the Daily thought that other
facts deter black athletes from the Farm
factors that Stanford could largely eliminate.
Football coach Jack Christiansen, who
presides over what wide receiver Tony Hill
calls "a very happy atmosphere" between
black and white players, thinks academics is
the chief reason for the relative dearth of

blacks on his team.
"When we recruit a Jim McAlister or
Kermit Johnson, we have to see whether we
have a curriculum they could have success in.
The big thing is continuity. As coaches we like
to know whether we can plan on having a
player for four years, not one who will flunk

out of school," Christiansen said.
"Sometimes you look on other rosters and
see a player like Shelton Diggs [USC flanker].
It's not thai; we didn't recruit them, but that
they didn't fit into our admission standards,"
Christiansen said.
But others don't think this is the whole
story. A source close to the athletic
department said, "I think it's hard recruiting
minorities for Stanford. It has nothing to do
with education. When you recruit minority
athletes, most of them satisfy the academic
requirements. It just has to do with how
they're treated."
A factor that works against Stanford is the
lack of black coaches. Moultrie left the
Stanford football program after the 1972
season and wasn't replaced until this summer.

Moultrie said this probably hurt the recruiting

coaching factors, the general reputation of
Stanford among blacks is not equivalent to
that of USC.
The same source quoted earlier said high
school coaches don't recommend Stanford to
their black players.
"When I was recruiting for Stanford in
Southern California, most of the coaches
wouldn't refer players to me. I only had about
three coaches who would recommend people
to me."

Inge said that "USC has a better reputation
among blacks. It's an exposure thing. You see
USC with a lot of blacks starting and then you
see Stanford."
Trojan tailback Anthony Davis said USC's
reputation among black athletes is
"tremendous."
Successful black athletes such as Davis
recruit others to the school. For example, Hill
has said he came to Stanford and became a
wide receiver because Gene Washington talked
him into it.
Washington, like Hill, is a Long Beach
native who switched form quarterback to end
while at Stanford.
Hill said, "I really think we need more
blacks. If you see no blacks, there's a lack of
something. Having more black players gives
you something to relate to."
Some Disagree
But not all would like to see an increase in
recruiting of black athletes. One who
wouldn't is Henry Organ of the General
Secretary's Office, who in 1972-73 led a
SWOPSI workshop on varsity athletics, the
black community and Stanford.
"Since there is no effort to recruit black
students generally," Organ said, "there should
be no effort to recruit black athletes."
And results of a survey conducted by the
SWOPSI workshop would seem to bear him
out. When asked what' attention should be
given to recruiting black non-athletes as
compared with black athletes, 45 percent of
the 38 persons sampled said it should be the
same, and 18 percent said it should be less.
But most Stanford rooters would rather fly
first class.

It s a question you have to ask yourself as a
coach: Can I win without black players? It's
just like flying airplanes. If everybody is flying
jets, you can't be stuck flying props."
—Bill Moultrie, former Stanford
assistant football coach
By CHRIS BAKER
The Stanford football team, to use
Moultrie's analogy, has been flying prop
planes. This season, the Cardinals had the
lowest number of blacks on any traveling
squad in the Pacific Eight seven (see
accompanying list).
Stanford was also a distant last in the
number of blacks in starting positions one.
Other sports were even worse. Last season,
there was only one black on the baseball
team. There are three blacks on this year's
basketball team, and two of them are in their
senior seasons.
The situation obviously affects the
performance of Cardinal athletic teams. For
example, it's probably not coincidence that
USC, champion of the Pac-8 this season, has
nine black starters on defense.
Why aren't there more black athletes at
Stanford? One standard answer is that many
cannot meet the academic requirements here.
But many of the black athletes and coaches
questioned by the Daily thought that other
facts deter black athletes from the Farm
factors that Stanford could largely eliminate.
Football coach Jack Christiansen, who
presides over what wide receiver Tony Hill
calls "a very happy atmosphere" between
black and white players, thinks academics is
the chief reason for the relative dearth of

blacks on his team.
"When we recruit a Jim McAlister or
Kermit Johnson, we have to see whether we
have a curriculum they could have success in.
The big thing is continuity. As coaches we like
to know whether we can plan on having a
player for four years, not one who will flunk

out of school," Christiansen said.
"Sometimes you look on other rosters and
see a player like Shelton Diggs [USC flanker].
It's not thai; we didn't recruit them, but that
they didn't fit into our admission standards,"
Christiansen said.
But others don't think this is the whole
story. A source close to the athletic
department said, "I think it's hard recruiting
minorities for Stanford. It has nothing to do
with education. When you recruit minority
athletes, most of them satisfy the academic
requirements. It just has to do with how
they're treated."
A factor that works against Stanford is the
lack of black coaches. Moultrie left the
Stanford football program after the 1972
season and wasn't replaced until this summer.

Moultrie said this probably hurt the recruiting
of blacks. "I think this would be a factor. But
since I'm not there I can't say."
Aide To Aide
There is now a black assistant, special teams
coach Willie Show. But running back Ron
Inge said of Shaw, "He came in as an assistant
to an assistant. If he had come in as an
assistant coach with some responsibility, it
would be different." (Shaw is currently
recruiting in Southern California and could
not be reached for comment.)
But freshman receiver James Lofton said,
"I think , we recognize him [Shaw] as an
adviser."
Hill said that having a black coach is
definitely an advantage. "I didn't have a black
coach in high school. Just after talking with
Shaw, I can identify with him."
Hill chose Stanford despite the fact that
USC's black assistant coach Willie Brown,
seriously recruited him.
"Tony's a personal friend of the family but
he went to Stanford because he's a wide
receiver and Stanford throws the ball," Brown
said. "I think the players look at the situation
[how they would fit into the offense] and
decide for themselves."
Not Great For Backs
This, of course, could explain why
Stanford, with rare exceptions such as Ron
Inge, does not get the top-flight black running
backs.
"For a running back, this isn't the greatest
place to come," Inge said. "It's a
predominantly white school and unless you're
goal-oriented [lnge is a human biology major]

this isn't your first choice."
Does the fact that Stanford is a mostly
white school located in a suburban
environment adversely affect the recruiting of
blacks?
• Lofton thinks so. "When I came up here
last year [as a recruit] they told me they were
having the biggest social event of the year. I
saw it and said 'what?' "
Cal assistant coach Johnny Johnson, who
received his master's degree from Stanford,
said that social life in Southern California is
more appealing for black athletes. "Once in a
while, they [black athletes] like to go back to
the community. So they feel a little more
comfortable down there. When I was in school
we weren't as aware as today's athlete."
But USC's Brown, while admitting "the
social situation there [at Stanford] probably
has something to do with" the lack of black
athletes, thinks that isn't a major factor.
"By and large social life is probably easier
for football players because they're in the
limelight. Interracial dating is also easier," for
the football player, Brown said.

planes. This season, the Cardinals had the
lowest number of blacks on any traveling
squad in the Pacific Eight seven (see
accompanying list).
Stanford was also a distant last in the
number of blacks in starting positions one.
Other sports were even worse. Last season,
there was only one black on the baseball
team. There are three blacks on this year's
basketball team, and two of them are in their
senior seasons.
The situation obviously affects the
performance of Cardinal athletic teams. For
example, it's probably not coincidence that
USC, champion of the Pac-8 this season, has
nine black starters on defense.
Why aren't there more black athletes at
Stanford? One standard answer is that many
cannot meet the academic requirements here.
But many of the black athletes and coaches
questioned by the Daily thought that other
facts deter black athletes from the Farm
factors that Stanford could largely eliminate.
Football coach Jack Christiansen, who
presides over what wide receiver Tony Hill
calls "a very happy atmosphere" between
black and white players, thinks academics is
the chief reason for the relative dearth of

blacks on his team.
"When we recruit a Jim McAlister or
Kermit Johnson, we have to see whether we
have a curriculum they could have success in.
The big thing is continuity. As coaches we like
to know whether we can plan on having a
player for four years, not one who will flunk

out of school," Christiansen said.
"Sometimes you look on other rosters and
see a player like Shelton Diggs [USC flanker].
It's not thai; we didn't recruit them, but that
they didn't fit into our admission standards,"
Christiansen said.
But others don't think this is the whole
story. A source close to the athletic
department said, "I think it's hard recruiting
minorities for Stanford. It has nothing to do
with education. When you recruit minority
athletes, most of them satisfy the academic
requirements. It just has to do with how
they're treated."
A factor that works against Stanford is the
lack of black coaches. Moultrie left the
Stanford football program after the 1972
season and wasn't replaced until this summer.

Moultrie said this probably hurt the recruiting
of blacks. "I think this would be a factor. But
since I'm not there I can't say."
Aide To Aide
There is now a black assistant, special teams
coach Willie Show. But running back Ron
Inge said of Shaw, "He came in as an assistant
to an assistant. If he had come in as an
assistant coach with some responsibility, it
would be different." (Shaw is currently
recruiting in Southern California and could
not be reached for comment.)
But freshman receiver James Lofton said,
"I think , we recognize him [Shaw] as an
adviser."
Hill said that having a black coach is
definitely an advantage. "I didn't have a black
coach in high school. Just after talking with
Shaw, I can identify with him."
Hill chose Stanford despite the fact that
USC's black assistant coach Willie Brown,
seriously recruited him.
"Tony's a personal friend of the family but
he went to Stanford because he's a wide
receiver and Stanford throws the ball," Brown
said. "I think the players look at the situation
[how they would fit into the offense] and
decide for themselves."
Not Great For Backs
This, of course, could explain why
Stanford, with rare exceptions such as Ron
Inge, does not get the top-flight black running
backs.
"For a running back, this isn't the greatest
place to come," Inge said. "It's a
predominantly white school and unless you're
goal-oriented [lnge is a human biology major]

this isn't your first choice."
Does the fact that Stanford is a mostly
white school located in a suburban
environment adversely affect the recruiting of
blacks?
• Lofton thinks so. "When I came up here
last year [as a recruit] they told me they were
having the biggest social event of the year. I
saw it and said 'what?' "
Cal assistant coach Johnny Johnson, who
received his master's degree from Stanford,
said that social life in Southern California is
more appealing for black athletes. "Once in a
while, they [black athletes] like to go back to
the community. So they feel a little more
comfortable down there. When I was in school
we weren't as aware as today's athlete."
But USC's Brown, while admitting "the
social situation there [at Stanford] probably
has something to do with" the lack of black
athletes, thinks that isn't a major factor.
"By and large social life is probably easier
for football players because they're in the
limelight. Interracial dating is also easier," for
the football player, Brown said.
In addition to academic, social and
coaching factors, the general reputation of
Stanford among blacks is not equivalent to
that of USC.
The same source quoted earlier said high
school coaches don't recommend Stanford to
their black players.
"When I was recruiting for Stanford in
Southern California, most of the coaches
wouldn't refer players to me. I only had about
three coaches who would recommend people
to me."

Inge said that "USC has a better reputation
among blacks. It's an exposure thing. You see
USC with a lot of blacks starting and then you
see Stanford."
Trojan tailback Anthony Davis said USC's
reputation among black athletes is
"tremendous."
Successful black athletes such as Davis
recruit others to the school. For example, Hill
has said he came to Stanford and became a
wide receiver because Gene Washington talked
him into it.
Washington, like Hill, is a Long Beach
native who switched form quarterback to end
while at Stanford.
Hill said, "I really think we need more
blacks. If you see no blacks, there's a lack of
something. Having more black players gives
you something to relate to."
Some Disagree
But not all would like to see an increase in
recruiting of black athletes. One who
wouldn't is Henry Organ of the General
Secretary's Office, who in 1972-73 led a
SWOPSI workshop on varsity athletics, the
black community and Stanford.
"Since there is no effort to recruit black
students generally," Organ said, "there should
be no effort to recruit black athletes."
And results of a survey conducted by the
SWOPSI workshop would seem to bear him
out. When asked what' attention should be
given to recruiting black non-athletes as
compared with black athletes, 45 percent of
the 38 persons sampled said it should be the
same, and 18 percent said it should be less.
But most Stanford rooters would rather fly
first class.

It s a question you have to ask yourself as a
coach: Can I win without black players? It's
just like flying airplanes. If everybody is flying
jets, you can't be stuck flying props."
