# Bowl Game Picks
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Our fearful forecaster having flown the coop after finally picking
Stanford to lose (in the Big Game) and seeing the Cards win, the task
of weaning out the winners of this season's bowl festivities has fallen
to more competent hands. So here goes:
Dec. 16 Liberty Bowl—Maryland (8-3) vs. Tennessee (6-3-2):
Aren't we all tired of seeing Tennessee in post-season games?
Perhaps, but few will tire of watching exciting Condredge Hollo way,
the Vols' quarterback. Holloway's brilliance, however, won't make a
dent. The Terrapins aren't bowl regulars, they're in the midst of a
comeback year and they're by far the better team. Maryland 31
Tennessee 17.
Dec. 21 Tangerine Bowl—Miami of Ohio (9-0-1) vs. Georgia (6-5):
This could have been one of those rare opportunities to see a
powerhouse of the past, which is such no longer but is still ranked
because it goes undefeated with a patsy schedule, get its ass kicked
against a real college team. Instead, Miami O. was matched with the
Bulldogs, who shouldn't be in any bowl. Miami 28 Georgia 21.
Dec. 28 Fiesta Bowl—BYU (7-3-1) vs. Oklahoma St. (6-5):
Brigham Young's is one of two Cinderella stories among the bowl
match-ups. It began inauspiciously, then was transformed by two big
wins over the Arizona powers. And by quarterback Gary Sheide,
statistically the nation's best passer. Such a stellar individual is often
the key to a bowl win, which is why the Cougars will beat a stronger
Oklahoma St. team whose major misfortune was being in the Big
Eight. BYU 24 Oklahoma St. 21.
Dec. 28 Peach Bowl—Vanderbilt (8-3) vs. Texas Tech (6-4-1):
Vandy in a bowl? That's right fresh off wins over Louisville,
Army and Virginia Military. But this is a whole new ball game; the
Red Raiders started strong, folded early, but still beat some good
teams. They'll beat Vandy too. Texas Tech 31 Vanderbilt 10.
Dec. 28 Sun Bowl—Mississippi St. (8-3) vs. N. Carolina (7-4):
It's been a long dry spell for the Bulldogs, but they've finally
emerged from the obscurity of the Southeastern Conference. And in a
fair test with the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Deep Southerners
always will triumph. Mississippi St. 38 N. Carolina 31.
Dec. 30 Gator Bowl—Auburn (9-2) vs. Texas (8-3):
If the Longhorns can acclimate themselves to the strange
surroundings of Jacksonville, Fla., rather than the customary Cotton
Bowl, they should continue their outstanding play of late. Texas 35
Auburn 18.
Dec. 31 Sugar Bowl—Florida (8-3) vs. Nebraska (8-3):
Not exactly like last New Year's Eve, is it? Though no national
championship is at stake, one can expect a traditionally excellent
bowl game from the Cornhuskers, who are still smarting from being
second best in the Big Eight. Nebraska 45 Florida 17.
Jan. 1 Cotton Bowl—Baylor (8-3) vs. Penn St. (9-2):
It doesn't take holiday spirits to warm one's heart: just look at the
Baylor Bears. Not a Southwest Conference title in 50 years. Not a
Cotton Bowl trip ever. But the local Baptist's belief in miracles has
been confirmed. Unfortunately, they're pushing their luck against the
best bowl team in the country. Penn St. 21 Baylor 14.
Jan. 1 Rose Bowl—USC (9-1-1) vs. Ohio St. (10-1):
Starting with their 34-10 rout of Stanford, the Trojans have been
the best college team in the country. Can John McKay's defense stop
Heisman winner Archie Griffin? Well enough. Anthony Davis may
have something to prove as well, although the stiff Buckeye defense
isn't the easiest proving ground. Sorry, Woody, but you'll meet your
match. USC 17 Ohio St. 14.
Jan. 1 Orange Bowl—Alabama (11-0) vs. Notre Dame (9-2):
If you're still awake and not yet drunk again, you may want to
stick around the tube for this one last battle. Ever see a revengeful
Bear? Many parts are dangerous. And Notre Dame, after that 55-24
thrashing by USC, just won't have the heart to stop this Tide-ul wave.
Alabama 31 Notre Dame 21.
