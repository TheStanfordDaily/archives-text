# Pac-8 Runners-Up Still Go Nowhere
## 
### GLENN GARVIN Commentary 
James McAlister and Kermit Johnson had
a good time last Christmas. They lounged
around the pool, went to a couple of movies
and drank a lot of beer.
McAlister and Johnson were probably the
finest 1-2 running punch in collegiate
football in 1973. They played for a UCLA
team that, on certain Saturdays, could have
been arrested for mass murder.
Unfortunately one of those Saturdays was
not against Southern Cal. The Bruins lost
28-7, and their spectacular 9-2 season ground
to a halt a month ahead of most teams of
their caliber.
Southern Cal went on to a Rose Bowl that
made The Texas Chainsaw Massacre seem like
pretty tame stuff. And UCLA, bound by a
stupid, archaic conference rule that only the
league champion may participate in
post-season play, went home.
UCLA lost a chance to play in the Orange
or Cotton Bowls because of the rule. But the
Bruins weren't the only ones who could have
picked up some extra money and national
recognition last year. A lot of selection
committees —notably those of the Fiesta,
Gator and Astro-Bluebonnet Bowls would
have jumped at the chance to get Stanford
and Mike Boryla onto the field.
Long List
The list is nearly endless. In 1966 Gary
Beban guided UCLA to a 9-1 season and

watched USC in the Rose Bowl. Sonny
Sixkiller never played in a bowl game,
although in 1971 Washington rolled up an
8-3 record. In 1970 six other teams
conceivably could have competed in a bowl
but just Stanford was eligible under
Pacific Eight rules.
It doesn't make a lot of sense. For one
thing, the rule is particularly rough on the
northern teams because of the California
domination of the Pac-8.
Only four times in the 16* year history of
the league has someone other than USC,
UCLA or Stanford managed to win a Rose
Bowl bid. The last time that happened, if
your memory is hazy, was 1964, when Oregon
State tied Southern Cal for the conference
championship.
In fact, practically no one besides USC
gets to bowl games under the present system.
The Trojans have made the trip eight times
and except for the two Stanford appearences
Troy's reign has been uninterrupted since
1964.
Bring In Money
Not only would open bowl attendance
add a lot of incentive to the non-USC portion
of the league (in both conference and
non-conference games) it would bring in a
hell of a lot of money. Every team in the
league collected a lovely $160,000 from the
Rose Bowl last year.
Granted the Gator Bowl wouldn't hold
that sort of cash reward but a payoff of

even one-quarter that amount buys a lot of
jockstraps.
This is all brilliant analysis, right? I'll
probably win a Pulitzer Prize, right? And all
the Pac-8 athletic directors will be so
overawed that they'll vote to change it right
away, right?
Well, two out of three isn't bad.
The Pac-8 probably isn't going to go for it.
Stanford's Joe Ruetz and Cal's Dave Maggard
are dead-set against it (for illogical reasons
having to do with "cheapening" the Rose
Bowl) and those two form a powerful
alliance in league politics.
Big 10 View

The one thing that might swing it is the
Big 10, the other half of the Rose Bowl. Ohio
State and Michigan have pushed the rest of
the conference around for so long that most
of the other schools think bowls are the
things you use Sani-Flush on.
Michigan is particularly irritated, since it
assembles a fine team every year, and then
sends it to chop firewood on New Year's Day
as Woody Hayes goes to the Rose Bowl.
If the Big 10 votes to change its bowl
policies, then the Pac-8 will probably drag
itself, kicking and screaming all the way, into
the 19705. Otherwise, get out the music to
"Little Old Lady From Pasadena" again.
And hope the USC charter plane crashes
before the opener next year, because that's
the only way you'll ever get to use it.

non-conference games) it would bring in a
hell of a lot of money. Every team in the
league collected a lovely $160,000 from the
Rose Bowl last year.
Granted the Gator Bowl wouldn't hold
that sort of cash reward but a payoff of

even one-quarter that amount buys a lot of
jockstraps.
This is all brilliant analysis, right? I'll
probably win a Pulitzer Prize, right? And all
the Pac-8 athletic directors will be so
overawed that they'll vote to change it right
away, right?
Well, two out of three isn't bad.
The Pac-8 probably isn't going to go for it.
Stanford's Joe Ruetz and Cal's Dave Maggard
are dead-set against it (for illogical reasons
having to do with "cheapening" the Rose
Bowl) and those two form a powerful
alliance in league politics.
Big 10 View

The one thing that might swing it is the
Big 10, the other half of the Rose Bowl. Ohio
State and Michigan have pushed the rest of
the conference around for so long that most
of the other schools think bowls are the
things you use Sani-Flush on.
Michigan is particularly irritated, since it
assembles a fine team every year, and then
sends it to chop firewood on New Year's Day
as Woody Hayes goes to the Rose Bowl.
If the Big 10 votes to change its bowl
policies, then the Pac-8 will probably drag
itself, kicking and screaming all the way, into
the 19705. Otherwise, get out the music to
"Little Old Lady From Pasadena" again.
And hope the USC charter plane crashes
before the opener next year, because that's
the only way you'll ever get to use it.
James McAlister and Kermit Johnson had
a good time last Christmas. They lounged
around the pool, went to a couple of movies
and drank a lot of beer.
McAlister and Johnson were probably the
finest 1-2 running punch in collegiate
football in 1973. They played for a UCLA
team that, on certain Saturdays, could have
been arrested for mass murder.
Unfortunately one of those Saturdays was
not against Southern Cal. The Bruins lost
28-7, and their spectacular 9-2 season ground
to a halt a month ahead of most teams of
their caliber.
Southern Cal went on to a Rose Bowl that
made The Texas Chainsaw Massacre seem like
pretty tame stuff. And UCLA, bound by a
stupid, archaic conference rule that only the
league champion may participate in
post-season play, went home.
UCLA lost a chance to play in the Orange
or Cotton Bowls because of the rule. But the
Bruins weren't the only ones who could have
picked up some extra money and national
recognition last year. A lot of selection
committees —notably those of the Fiesta,
Gator and Astro-Bluebonnet Bowls would
have jumped at the chance to get Stanford
and Mike Boryla onto the field.
Long List
The list is nearly endless. In 1966 Gary
Beban guided UCLA to a 9-1 season and

watched USC in the Rose Bowl. Sonny
Sixkiller never played in a bowl game,
although in 1971 Washington rolled up an
8-3 record. In 1970 six other teams
conceivably could have competed in a bowl
but just Stanford was eligible under
Pacific Eight rules.
It doesn't make a lot of sense. For one
thing, the rule is particularly rough on the
northern teams because of the California
domination of the Pac-8.
Only four times in the 16* year history of
the league has someone other than USC,
UCLA or Stanford managed to win a Rose
Bowl bid. The last time that happened, if
your memory is hazy, was 1964, when Oregon
State tied Southern Cal for the conference
championship.
In fact, practically no one besides USC
gets to bowl games under the present system.
The Trojans have made the trip eight times
and except for the two Stanford appearences
Troy's reign has been uninterrupted since
1964.
