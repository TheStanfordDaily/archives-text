## Seeing Red College Football Ramblings 
### Viae Kershner 
College football rambles
on ...
Ohio State and USC again.
Alabama and Notre Dame
again.
Oklahoma (ignored again).
Michigan (edged out again).
Penn State and Texas in the
Cotton Bowl again.
What? It's not Texas but
Baylor? Fantastic! All those
cynics who think the same teams
dominate college football year
after year are wrong. And here's
proof Baylor will go to the
Cotton BowU
Why you never know. At this
rate of turnover, by the time we
enter the new millenium,
Northwestern might be playing
Washington State in the Rose
Bowl.
But I doubt it. I think the top
10 will still include at least five of
the first eight schools mentioned
in this article, along with such
other entries as Auburn, LSU and
Nebraska.

Still, of course, college football
is much more exciting than that
nasty game played by the pros.
Why, in that game, heaven forbid,
they use such dull stilted tactics.
Dull Passing
Instead of using the modern
wishbone or veer formation, they
pass. Passing, of course, is dull.
The only college teams that would
dare bore people with such
mundane tactics are academic
anachronisms like Stanford and
California that never get
278-pound offensive linemen.
And what's worse, you keep
having to learn the names of all
these new coaches in pro football.
I mean, this season, it's likely St.
Louis and Buffalo will make the
playoffs. We'd much rather see
lovable old Woody, Bear or Ara.
Actually, though, I like college
football much better than the pro
variety of the game. Look at the
pageantry, the spectacle, the
color, the homey honesty of the
college game.
That's why I think ABC-TV
does such a good job.
No matter how poor the teams,
or how boring the games, you
always know that These Two Fine
Football Teams are putting out
everything they have.
Sour Flavor
And meanwhile, ABC gives you
the true flavor of a college
campus. It shows the marching
bands (though the sound
equipment usually can't pick up
what they're playing).
It gives 30-second spot reports,
prepared by find public relations
people, of what the campus is
really like. Why, just this past
weekend, we got to hear what a
great school Texas A&M is.
This year, ABC, in its
never-ending quest for excellence,
hired two college-age reporters.
They started out with interesting
features on the moods of the
campuses they visited. Particularly
impressive was Don Tollefson's
feature on James Meredith at

Mississippi.
They ended up, as best as I can
recall, plugging the Chevrolet
scholarship program, which each
year produces thousands of fine
young Camaros.
I don't know if ABC will have
any college-age people next
season. I really think they should,
though. It's oh, so contorting for
viewers to see America's youth
promoting the same virtues as
America's mature citizenry by
praising Notre Dame's Chrome
Dome.
Imagination
Oh, I wouldn't be so rash to
suggest that mean-minded brass
squelched the imaginations of
Tollefson and Jim Lampley.
Lampley must still have a lot of
imagination to wear his hair in
what must be the ugliest style ever
created.
But enough of this. The reason
I really like ABC is that they show
lots of pretty girls. That's what
college football is really all about.
I mean, face it, the best thing
about USC has to be that blonde
cheerleader.
Not to beat a dead horse, but
ABC showed its true colors last
spring when a producer of theirs
ranked all the schools according
to the beauty of their coeds.
He didn't like Stanford girls.
That caused a panic around here.
If ABC doesn't like your
school's girls, it won't put you on
TV. If it doesn't put you on TV,
you won't get your $106,000. If
you don't get your dough, you
won't be able to afford to buy a
good football program.
I wouldn't be surprised, if
Stanford athletic officials, faced
with such a prospect, went to
Fred Hargadon and asked him to
let in more pre-season All-Miss
Americas. And if they agree to
sleep with ABC's executive
seducer... uh, producer, give
them scholarships.
Hey, maybe we've hit on a
strategy Stanford can use to get
back into the Rose Bowl.

variety of the game. Look at the
pageantry, the spectacle, the
color, the homey honesty of the
college game.
That's why I think ABC-TV
does such a good job.
No matter how poor the teams,
or how boring the games, you
always know that These Two Fine
Football Teams are putting out
everything they have.
Sour Flavor
And meanwhile, ABC gives you
the true flavor of a college
campus. It shows the marching
bands (though the sound
equipment usually can't pick up
what they're playing).
It gives 30-second spot reports,
prepared by find public relations
people, of what the campus is
really like. Why, just this past
weekend, we got to hear what a
great school Texas A&M is.
This year, ABC, in its
never-ending quest for excellence,
hired two college-age reporters.
They started out with interesting
features on the moods of the
campuses they visited. Particularly
impressive was Don Tollefson's
feature on James Meredith at

Mississippi.
They ended up, as best as I can
recall, plugging the Chevrolet
scholarship program, which each
year produces thousands of fine
young Camaros.
I don't know if ABC will have
any college-age people next
season. I really think they should,
though. It's oh, so contorting for
viewers to see America's youth
promoting the same virtues as
America's mature citizenry by
praising Notre Dame's Chrome
Dome.
Imagination
Oh, I wouldn't be so rash to
suggest that mean-minded brass
squelched the imaginations of
Tollefson and Jim Lampley.
Lampley must still have a lot of
imagination to wear his hair in
what must be the ugliest style ever
created.
But enough of this. The reason
I really like ABC is that they show
lots of pretty girls. That's what
college football is really all about.
I mean, face it, the best thing
about USC has to be that blonde
cheerleader.
Not to beat a dead horse, but
ABC showed its true colors last
spring when a producer of theirs
ranked all the schools according
to the beauty of their coeds.
He didn't like Stanford girls.
That caused a panic around here.
If ABC doesn't like your
school's girls, it won't put you on
TV. If it doesn't put you on TV,
you won't get your $106,000. If
you don't get your dough, you
won't be able to afford to buy a
good football program.
I wouldn't be surprised, if
Stanford athletic officials, faced
with such a prospect, went to
Fred Hargadon and asked him to
let in more pre-season All-Miss
Americas. And if they agree to
sleep with ABC's executive
seducer... uh, producer, give
them scholarships.
Hey, maybe we've hit on a
strategy Stanford can use to get
back into the Rose Bowl.

College football rambles
on ...
Ohio State and USC again.
Alabama and Notre Dame
again.
Oklahoma (ignored again).
Michigan (edged out again).
Penn State and Texas in the
Cotton Bowl again.
What? It's not Texas but
Baylor? Fantastic! All those
cynics who think the same teams
dominate college football year
after year are wrong. And here's
proof Baylor will go to the
Cotton BowU
Why you never know. At this
rate of turnover, by the time we
enter the new millenium,
Northwestern might be playing
Washington State in the Rose
Bowl.
But I doubt it. I think the top
10 will still include at least five of
the first eight schools mentioned
in this article, along with such
other entries as Auburn, LSU and
Nebraska.

Still, of course, college football
is much more exciting than that
nasty game played by the pros.
Why, in that game, heaven forbid,
they use such dull stilted tactics.
Dull Passing
Instead of using the modern
wishbone or veer formation, they
pass. Passing, of course, is dull.
The only college teams that would
dare bore people with such
mundane tactics are academic
anachronisms like Stanford and
California that never get
278-pound offensive linemen.
And what's worse, you keep
having to learn the names of all
these new coaches in pro football.
I mean, this season, it's likely St.
Louis and Buffalo will make the
playoffs. We'd much rather see
lovable old Woody, Bear or Ara.

Tollefson and Jim Lampley.
Lampley must still have a lot of
imagination to wear his hair in
what must be the ugliest style ever
created.
But enough of this. The reason
I really like ABC is that they show
lots of pretty girls. That's what
college football is really all about.
I mean, face it, the best thing
about USC has to be that blonde
cheerleader.
Not to beat a dead horse, but
ABC showed its true colors last
spring when a producer of theirs
ranked all the schools according
to the beauty of their coeds.
He didn't like Stanford girls.
That caused a panic around here.
If ABC doesn't like your
school's girls, it won't put you on
TV. If it doesn't put you on TV,
you won't get your $106,000. If
you don't get your dough, you
won't be able to afford to buy a
good football program.
I wouldn't be surprised, if
Stanford athletic officials, faced
with such a prospect, went to
Fred Hargadon and asked him to
let in more pre-season All-Miss
Americas. And if they agree to
sleep with ABC's executive
seducer... uh, producer, give
them scholarships.
Hey, maybe we've hit on a
strategy Stanford can use to get
back into the Rose Bowl.

College football rambles
on ...
Ohio State and USC again.
Alabama and Notre Dame
again.
Oklahoma (ignored again).
Michigan (edged out again).
Penn State and Texas in the
Cotton Bowl again.
What? It's not Texas but
Baylor? Fantastic! All those
cynics who think the same teams
dominate college football year
after year are wrong. And here's
proof Baylor will go to the
Cotton BowU
Why you never know. At this
rate of turnover, by the time we
enter the new millenium,
Northwestern might be playing
Washington State in the Rose
Bowl.
But I doubt it. I think the top
10 will still include at least five of
the first eight schools mentioned
in this article, along with such
other entries as Auburn, LSU and
Nebraska.

Still, of course, college football
is much more exciting than that
nasty game played by the pros.
Why, in that game, heaven forbid,
they use such dull stilted tactics.
Dull Passing
Instead of using the modern
wishbone or veer formation, they
pass. Passing, of course, is dull.
The only college teams that would
dare bore people with such
mundane tactics are academic
anachronisms like Stanford and
California that never get
278-pound offensive linemen.
And what's worse, you keep
having to learn the names of all
these new coaches in pro football.
I mean, this season, it's likely St.
Louis and Buffalo will make the
playoffs. We'd much rather see
lovable old Woody, Bear or Ara.
Actually, though, I like college
football much better than the pro
variety of the game. Look at the
pageantry, the spectacle, the
color, the homey honesty of the
college game.
That's why I think ABC-TV
does such a good job.
No matter how poor the teams,
or how boring the games, you
always know that These Two Fine
Football Teams are putting out
everything they have.
Sour Flavor
And meanwhile, ABC gives you
the true flavor of a college
campus. It shows the marching
bands (though the sound
equipment usually can't pick up
what they're playing).
It gives 30-second spot reports,
prepared by find public relations
people, of what the campus is
really like. Why, just this past
weekend, we got to hear what a
great school Texas A&M is.
This year, ABC, in its
never-ending quest for excellence,
hired two college-age reporters.
They started out with interesting
features on the moods of the
campuses they visited. Particularly
impressive was Don Tollefson's
feature on James Meredith at

Mississippi.
They ended up, as best as I can
recall, plugging the Chevrolet
scholarship program, which each
year produces thousands of fine
young Camaros.
I don't know if ABC will have
any college-age people next
season. I really think they should,
though. It's oh, so contorting for
viewers to see America's youth
promoting the same virtues as
America's mature citizenry by
praising Notre Dame's Chrome
Dome.
Imagination
Oh, I wouldn't be so rash to
suggest that mean-minded brass
squelched the imaginations of
Tollefson and Jim Lampley.
Lampley must still have a lot of
imagination to wear his hair in
what must be the ugliest style ever
created.
