# Who'll Be New Husky Coach?
## Devine, Rogers Head List Of Candidates 
### MARK FUNK 
About the embark on what one
source in Seattle described as
"possibly the most productive
recruiting session in quite a while
around here," the University of
Washington athletic department
has intensified its search for a
successor to retiring football
coach Jim Owens.
Owens, who for the past 18
years has guided Washington
gridiron fortunes, retired two
weeks ago under withering
criticism from university officials
and alumni after two consecutive
losing seasons, racial problems and
failure to produce a good running
back.
Word out of Seattle says that

the search for a coach could end
as soon as next week or maybe
next month.
"The situation up here is
cloudy," Donn Bernstein, Husky
Sports Information Director, said
Tuesday. "Joe [Dr. Joe Kearney,
athletic director] is handling the
whole affair. Frankly, I can't even
speculate on a new man right
now."
Early Favorites
If Bernstein isn't ready to
speculate, however, others are
more than willing. The search has
been front page news in both of
Seattle's metropolitan
newspapers. The early favorites
appear to be Dan Devine,
currently head coach of the Green

Bay Packers and rumored on his
way out, and San Jose State's
Darryl Rogers.
While the signing of a head
coach the stature of Devine would
be a coup d'etat for Washington,
realists believe the new man will
be cut in the mold of a coach like
Rogers.
San Jose State SID Wynn Cook
said that people in his department
were aware Rogers was under
consideration for the Washington
post. "He told me he would like
it, but might not be able to stand
the weather in Seattle," he
explained.
"It is fairly well known that he
is a candidate/' Cook added. "We
just have to see how serious the
people at Washington are about
him."
According to Bernstein, over
100 people have applied for the
opening, including two Husky
assistants, Jim Lambright and
Tony Kopay. Insiders say their
hats were tossed out of the ring
almost before they threw them in.
The Dogs are looking for new
blood.
"And the Pacific Coast
Athletic Conference coaches (of
whom Rogers is one)," Bernstein
said, "have all been applying. It
would be a real step up for them."
He also said that a number of top
assistant coaches on the coast
have made overtures to Kearney.
"It's a real madhouse up here," he
concluded.
But still, the selection should
come within three weeks. With a
National Football League
franchise due in Seattle during
1976, the Huskies are under
pressure to produce a winner or
lose what some people
characterize as the most loyal fans
in the Pacific Eight to the pros.
Remember what happened to
the University of Minnesota when
the Vikings moved into the Twin
Cities? Gopher athletics just ain't
what they used to be.
A good recruiting year would
help Washington compete with
the pros, but first they need a
coach.

San Jose State SID Wynn Cook
said that people in his department
were aware Rogers was under
consideration for the Washington
post. "He told me he would like
it, but might not be able to stand
the weather in Seattle," he
explained.
"It is fairly well known that he
is a candidate/' Cook added. "We
just have to see how serious the
people at Washington are about
him."
According to Bernstein, over
100 people have applied for the
opening, including two Husky
assistants, Jim Lambright and
Tony Kopay. Insiders say their
hats were tossed out of the ring
almost before they threw them in.
The Dogs are looking for new
blood.
"And the Pacific Coast
Athletic Conference coaches (of
whom Rogers is one)," Bernstein
said, "have all been applying. It
would be a real step up for them."
He also said that a number of top
assistant coaches on the coast
have made overtures to Kearney.
"It's a real madhouse up here," he
concluded.
But still, the selection should
come within three weeks. With a
National Football League
franchise due in Seattle during
1976, the Huskies are under
pressure to produce a winner or
lose what some people
characterize as the most loyal fans
in the Pacific Eight to the pros.
Remember what happened to
the University of Minnesota when
the Vikings moved into the Twin
Cities? Gopher athletics just ain't
what they used to be.
A good recruiting year would
help Washington compete with
the pros, but first they need a
coach.
About the embark on what one
source in Seattle described as
"possibly the most productive
recruiting session in quite a while
around here," the University of
Washington athletic department
has intensified its search for a
successor to retiring football
coach Jim Owens.
Owens, who for the past 18
years has guided Washington
gridiron fortunes, retired two
weeks ago under withering
criticism from university officials
and alumni after two consecutive
losing seasons, racial problems and
failure to produce a good running
back.
Word out of Seattle says that

the search for a coach could end
as soon as next week or maybe
next month.
"The situation up here is
cloudy," Donn Bernstein, Husky
Sports Information Director, said
Tuesday. "Joe [Dr. Joe Kearney,
athletic director] is handling the
whole affair. Frankly, I can't even
speculate on a new man right
now."
Early Favorites
If Bernstein isn't ready to
speculate, however, others are
more than willing. The search has
been front page news in both of
Seattle's metropolitan
newspapers. The early favorites
appear to be Dan Devine,
currently head coach of the Green

Bay Packers and rumored on his
way out, and San Jose State's
Darryl Rogers.
While the signing of a head
coach the stature of Devine would
be a coup d'etat for Washington,
realists believe the new man will
be cut in the mold of a coach like
Rogers.
