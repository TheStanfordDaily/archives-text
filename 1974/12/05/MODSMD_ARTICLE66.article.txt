# Cards Outlast LSU, 92-80
## Front Line Stars In Cage Opener 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford basketball fans have
long wondered why out of all that
talent and all that height, the
Cardinals couldn't fashion a
consistently excellent front line.
After Saturday, that question
may have become moot.
The starting trio combined for
61 points and 38 rebounds in the
Cards' 92-80 win in their opener
against Louisiana State Saturday
night.
They also combined to play
effective man-to-man defense
against the Bengals.
Their names? (Fanfare) Rich
Kelley, Ed Schweitzer and Scott
Trobbe.
Scott Trobbe? s
Well, the name does sound a
bit strange, as last season it was
most often associated with
cockeyed shots angling toward
backboard. But Saturday, Trobbe
came into his own, scoring 18
points on a variety of shots.
Unfortunate^
Asked whether it was his best
game, Trobbe said,
"Unfortunately, it probably is."
Kelley also played a good

game, as his back injury did not
noticeably hamper his
performance. The smaller Bengal
front line could not stop him
from practically playing catch
near the backboard. Kelley
finished with 24 rebounds, a
Maples record, 21 points and,
more surprisingly, only two fouls.
The third frontliner,
Schweitzer, quietly put in 22
points to lead the team.
Starting guard Mark Gilberg
also looked good, with seven
assists and eight points, which
included two baskets on the first
jump shots most fans had ever

seen him take. Only one starter,
Melvin Arterberry, had an off
night, as foul trouble kept him on
the bench.
Familiar Collapse
If the starters did so well, why
didn't Stanford win by more than
12 points (USC, by comparison,
beat LSU by 13 the previous
night.)? Well, it all has to do with a
familiar Stanford nemesis, the
collapse in the late stages of the
first half.
The Cardinal starters, with hot
shooting, built up a 34-18 lead 12
minutes into the game. Coach
Howie Dallmar sat them down,
and immediately the new lineup
forgot some fundamentals like
ballhandling and defense.
The reserves, including talented
newcomers Mike Bratz and Jay
Carter as well as veterans Mike
Simons and Tim Patterson, looked
nervous and impatient. LSU,
especially guard Kenny Higgs,
took advantage of these flaws.
Even the return of the regulars
couldn't stem the tide, and by
halftime, LSU had wiped out the
16-point advantage and the game
was tied at 45-all.
Early Lead
Hot shooting by forward Ed
Leßlanc put the Bengals in the
lead early in the second half.
But this time, Dallmar stuck

with his starting five, (putting
Simons in when Arterberry fouled
out).
The superior talent and height
of the Stanford front line
gradually wore LSU down, and by
the end of the game, only one
LSU player, Higgs, still seemed
alive and kicking.
Feisty Freshman
Higgs, you see, is this little
(5-11) freshman, who enjoys
stealing the ball, shooting, yelling
at teammates and quibbling with
refs, not necessarily in that order.
He spent most of the game
doing all four things, finishing
with a game-high 29 points. "He
looks like he's ready for the ABA
hardship draft right now," one
writer surmised in the locker
room.
Stanford's locker room wasn't
especially jubilant, as many of the
Cardinals especially Carter
seemed disappointed with their
play.
Over on the other side, LSU
mentor Dale Brown declined to
compare Stanford and USC, but
noted that "This is the best
Stanford team I've seen in
years... We did a lot of things
well Stanford's height just
finally got to us."

Cardinal Notes: Stanford had a
good opening game crowd of
5003 (which is at least in theory,
an exact count) ... The game
marked the first time in four years
that the Cardinals have won an
opener...
Several players, including
Schweitzer, expressed
disappointment that the Cardinals
wouldn't play again for two weeks
due to exams and a scheduling
quirk. But as Gilberg said, "The
two-week break is gonna be a lot
nicer since we won. When you

lose and don't play for so long it
gives you too much time to think
about it and it gives the coaches
too much time to think about it."
Some have suggested that
Gilberg's improved performance
was due to more confidence than
last season. Others think it's due
to more hair. Gilberg's now one of
the longest haired players on the
clean-shaven Cardinal team ...
Stanford's field goal percentage
of .506, compared to LSU's .426,
was a major reason for the
victory. The Cards here also shot
over 50 percent in all their
scrimmages. Another scrimmage is
set for this Saturday.

unsuccessful battle for the ball with an LSU player. Kelley recovered
in time to score 21 points and grab 24 rebounds. For his play, he was
votfed Northern California basketball player-of-the-week.

MELLOW—Scott Trobbe, long known as one of the most mellow
Stanford athletes, now shows signs of becoming one of the best as
well. Trobbe scored 18 points in the Cardinals' opening win over LSU
