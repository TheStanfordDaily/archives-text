# ASSU Proposes Bicycle Shop

### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Plans for an ASSU-run bicycle shop will crystallize over
Christmas break, Asst. Financial Manager Brendan Reidy
predicted at a press conference yesterday.
Steve Seay, a student who initiated the bike shop plans,
said that he hopes to open the shop by the beginning of
spring quarter, hopefully in Tresidder Memorial Union
(TMU).
But Tresidder General Manager Gordon Starr
emphasized that no concrete plans have been made. "It's
something that we're quite willing to look at," he said,
adding that Tresidder now has no convenient place to put a
bike shop.
If the ASSU submits a bid for space, Starr would also
solicit bids from other groups, he said. The decision will be
based on the services being offered, his confidence in the
organization and the financial returns to Tresidder, Starr
explained.
Starr will resign from Tresidder on Jan. 1, and his job
will be diffused over other Tresidder staff. But he told the
Daily when he resigned that he intends to have next year's
plans for Tresidder finalized before he leaves.
Reidy suggested that the bike shop be located at the Old
Union end of the cafeteria, which has available space.
The existing Campus Bike Shop will be moved in a few

months when construction begins on a new engineering
building next to the Women's Gym. Director of Plant
Services Jason Mavis reported that the University has been
looking for a place to move the privately-owned shop.
If the ASSU does submit a viable proposal, he said, the
University would have to make a choice between them. But
since there are not yet any concrete plans for a student-run
shop, he will continue to search for a new location for the
existing shop, Mavis said.
Campus Bike Shop Owner Fred Morse, said that he had
not heard about the ASSU proposal until Wednesday.
Morse has owned the shop since 1951, and has worked in it
since he was a Stanford student in 1948.
He described his shop as "a family business" which does
not employ students. He also owns the Campus Bike Shop
in Palo Alto.
Reidy estimated that the ASSU could set up a shop for
$6OOO to $lO,OOO. The initial investment could come from
the ASSU either as a fee assessment or as a loan, but Seay
said he would prefer a loan.
Working with a low profit margin, an ASSU bike shop
could provide bicycle repair, rentals and sales at lower costs
than a private business operation could, Reidy said. "I see it
as more of a student service than a
profit-making operation."
Unfortunately, Reidy explained,
distributors usually require shops to
sell bicycles at a set minimum price.
To reduce prices, he and Seay are
thinking of importing bicycles
directly, assembling them here and
selling them just above cost, Reidy
said. He estimated that "the ASSU
could sell good 10-speed bikes for
about $100."
Seay pointed out that the existing
Campus Bike Shop does not employ
students, although University policy is
to employ students whenever possible.
He said that a student-run bike shop
could provide 20 part-time jobs.
If the shop were to open spring
quarter, it could buy used bicycles
from students leaving in June, Seay
said. It could then have bicycles
available for rent during the summer
and sell both new and used bicycles in
the fall.
Asst. Financial Manager Jeff
Greenwald said that supporters of the
long-awaited pub will also have a more
definite proposal next month.
