# Cards To Spend Vacation On Road
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball team will
be living out of suitcases this
Christmas.
While most Pacific Eight teams
spend the bulk of their vacations
in the friendly confines of their
home arenas, the Cardinals will
embark on a holiday sojourn that
includes stops in Reno,
Minneapolis, Madison, Wis.,
Albuquerque, N.M., and Tucson,
Ariz.
When the travel-weary Cards
finally return to the Bay Area in
1975, they face another road
game this time against USF in
San Francisco on Jan. 3.
And then, to finish off a
stretch of nine road games in a
three-week period, the Cards open
their Pac-8 season Jan. 10-11 in
Oregon, of all places.
The whole experience is likely
to be very disconcerting, so
Stanford's coaches are taking
pains to avoid any sort of
over-optimism, even against the
lesser vacation foes. "We have to
anticipate being the underdog in
every game we play on the road,"

said assistant coach Bub Bowling.
"We can't regard any of these
teams lightly."
Bowling is especially worried
about Stanford's first test after
finals a Dec. 14 encounter
against Nevada-Reno at Reno. The
Wolfpack defeated Stanford in
last year's opener at Maples
Pavilion, and coach Jim Padgett
has eight lettermen returning from
that team including his
high-scoring son Pete.
The Cards head northeast from
Reno for a pair of games against
Big 10 teams. Minnesota,
Stanford's Dec. 16 opponent,
figures to be especially tough.
Fiery coach Bill Musselman
recruited several blue-chip
freshman, including 6-foot-8 Mark
Olberding, a prominent name en
over 100 coaches' shopping lists.
On Dec. 18, the Cards travel to
Madison, Wis., to play the
Badgers. Wisconsin finished 16-8
last year, but the team was
decimated by graduation and
prospects are not particularly
bright for 1975.
Stanford returns home on Dec.
21 to play Utah State. It's a good
thing. The Aggies were 14-0 at
home last year, but only 2-10 on
the road.
Florida, with 6-8, 230-pound
muscleman Chip Williams, invades

Maples two nights later.
The Cardinals then travel to
Albuquerque, N.M., for the Lobo
Invitational, which features
Stanford, Illinois, Army and the
host Lobos. As the luck of a fixed
draw would have it, the Cards
open against Illinois on Dec. 27
while New Mexico warms up
against hapless Army. The
following night's championship
game should be interesting, but 1
Friday night's Stanford-Illinois
game will probably be the best
matchup.
Stanford concludes its travels
on Dec. 30 in Tucson against
Arizona, generally picked for
second in the Western Athletic
Conference.
Right now, though, the
Cardinals are just thinking about
final exams and Nevada-Reno.
"We're really worried about
Reno," Bowling admits. "As soon
as we start thinking about
anybody other than our next
opponent, we're in trouble."
But Bowling is thinking ahead
just a little bit. "I seriously think
if we play each one as a very
meaningful game, we can win
every game in our non-league
schedule," he said. "I think it's a
realistic goal to go after all of
em.
