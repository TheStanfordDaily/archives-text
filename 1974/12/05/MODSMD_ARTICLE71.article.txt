# DeMeo Gives Wrestling ‘Hard Sell’
## 
### MARK FUNK 
When 118-pounder Malcolm
Scott took the mat to open a dual
meet with San Jose State after
Saturday's basketball game in
Maples Pavilion, he was competing
in front of one of the largest
crowds in Stanford wrestling
history. Before heavyweight
Doug Stamm recorded a decision
to end it, he was wrestling before
one of the smallest.
It's not because the wrestling
team is poor. It isn't. In fact, it
potentially is the best ever. The
Athletic Department isn't the
culprit, either. The people who
control the purse strings are
warming to the sport.
You can't even blame the fans
for leaving (after all, the match
did end at midnight). Stanford
fans just don't seem to be
wrestling-oriented.
To which head coach Joe
DeMeo responds, "yet."
He says they'll be oriented
soon.
Icing On Cake
It hasn't been easy, but DeMeo
took a program which four years
ago was all but non-existant and
elevated it to Pacific Eight calibre.
When fan support comes it will be
what DeMeo characterizes as the
icing on the cake.
"I think fan interest is coming
on now," DeMeo said. "Once
people find out that wrestling
involves athletic ability and not
brutality they'll except it."
This year he's giving Stanford

wrestling the hard sell. By
scheduling the San Jose match
after the basketball game, DeMeo
felt he could expose more people
to his sport. He did. DeMeo's also
giving away free popcorn to
attract spectators to meets.
In addition to that attraction,
spectators will also see a team
vastly improved over squads in
years past. Barring injury, as many

as eight wrestlers could place in
the Pac-B's, according to DeMeo.
Good, Knock On Wood
"Not being superstitious,"
DeMeo said, knocking on his
wooden desk, "we should be good
this year." Good paraphrases
wrestlers like Chris Horpel, an
All-American at 150 pounds two
years ago. Coming off an injury,
DeMeo expects his ace to be one
of the top grapplers in the
country this season.
"But we want people on
campus to know who he is,"
DeMeo chuckled. "Have you seen

those 'Who is Chris Horpel' signs
around White Plaza?"
John Govea is another wrestler
who could go far in the Pac-B's. He
wrestles at 190. So, too, could
Ken Krebs, 134, and Craig
Reynolds, 158.
But DeMeo warns the club is
not deep. If wrestlers get injured
in key positions Stanford could be
in for another rough haul. "We're
all hoping nothing happens," he
said.
Improved Funding
Relativelycspeaking (relative to
past-years), the wrestling team is
prospering. "When I came here,
we weren't getting the money
programs the other schools were
getting," DeMeo pointed out.
Now the Athletic Department has
stepped in and is helping fund the
sport. Their dollars still don't
meet all the team's needs, but
things are better than when
DeMeo came.
He has organized a Friends of
the Stanford Wrestling Team club
to help make ends meet. "It
involves alumni', parents and
anybody else who wants to
contribute in a fund raising
effort," DeMeo said. Most of the
money goes to recruiting.
DeMeo needs those funds. The
Athletic Department alloted just
$250 for recruiting this year.
Stamp money.
It limits recruiting to the
immediate area, but DeMeo is
counting on alumni support in
helping the program out-of-state.
But with the team's improved
record and program, recruiting is
becoming easier.
"We're doing a lot of recruit

ing this year," DeMeo said. "We
don't have many scholarships to
give out, but we're now able to
compete with schools like
Berkeley. They have 15
scholarship wrestlers this year."
'Bought' Wrestlers
"Schools like that buy
wrestlers," DeMeo asserted.
"When we had Malcolm Scott
recruited, Berkeley tried to buy
him back by offering him a
scholarship, a full ride, after he
went to a junior college for a
year."
"When we are after
somebody," DeMeo continued,
"we can't tell them that we're an
established program, but that we
are building it." He says recruits
are responding to the team's
campaign.
Interestingly, this is one
athletic organization that is not
parasitic. "The kids have earned a
lot of money for the program
themselves by cleaning the
stadium after football games and
painting bleachers in Encina. See
that mural on the wall," he said,
pointing to a painting of a

wrestler on Encina's back wall.
"Horpel painted it." Why? Team
members wanted to make the old
gym more enjoyable for
spectators.
Stanford's wrestling program is
Run on a budget that
probably wouldn't buy a
shoestring to hang it from, it is
the product of dedicated
participants and a dedicated
coach.
"Our program's growing,"
DeMeo said. "We've come a long
way and hope we can go further."

PROGRAM BUlLDER—Wrestling coach Joe DeMeo, with a
combination of aggressive salesmanship and good coaching, has built
Stanford's team into one of the best low-budget programs in the
country. He'd like to make it one of the best programs, period.

ONE MORE CHANCE—Chris Horpel was an Ail-American two years ago, but was hurt last season. A major force in rebuilding of Stanford's
wrestling program, Horpel decided to stay in school an extra year to help the team out as well as win even more personal awards.
