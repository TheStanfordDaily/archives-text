# UC-Davis Spoils JV Opener
## 
### 
Losing momentum built up
during the first 10 minutes of the
game, Stanford's JV basketball
team dropped its season opener
to UC-Davis 83-72 Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cards, paced by the 20
points of sophomore forward
Sven Walker, played
inconsistently throughout the
contest.
At times, though, they looked
very good. Spotting Davis eight
points in the early going, Stanford
rallied to take the lead midway
through the first period and
played the visiting Aggies to a
virtual stand-off in the second
half.
More often than not, however,
the club committed key
turnovers, fouls and mental errors
at crucial stages of the game.
Hitting a fatal cold spell with
five minutes to go in the first half,
the Cards allowed Davis to take a
seven-point lead into the locker
room at intermission. The Aggies
were never headed.
"We were disappointed,"
Walker said after the game. "We
just made too many mistakes to
win." These sentiments were
echoed by the rest of the JVs.
The loss spoiled the
intercollegiate coaching debut of

Percy Carr, who took over the
reigns of the JV team from Billy
Jones this fall. Carr, substituting
liberally throughout the contest,
played 11 members of the 18-man
squad.
After trailing by as much as 13
in the second half, a last-gasp
Stanford rally narrowed the gap
to five with just over two minutes
left in the game. That was as close
as the team came, as fouls and
turnovers enabled the Aggies to
boost the lead to 11 points at the
final buzzer.

For all intents and purposes,
the contest was won at the foul
line, where Davis hit 27 free
throws (for almost one-third of its
point total) to Stanford's eight.
The Cards committed 28 fouls.
Other Stanford players to
break into double figures for the
night were Scott Russell with 18
points and Warner Session, who
netted 10. Both were instrumental
in the Card's closing rally.
Next action for the JVs will be
Jan. 4, when they travel to the
state capital to take on
Sacramento State.

rallied to take the lead midway
through the first period and
played the visiting Aggies to a
virtual stand-off in the second
half.
More often than not, however,
the club committed key
turnovers, fouls and mental errors
at crucial stages of the game.
Hitting a fatal cold spell with
five minutes to go in the first half,
the Cards allowed Davis to take a
seven-point lead into the locker
room at intermission. The Aggies
were never headed.
"We were disappointed,"
Walker said after the game. "We
just made too many mistakes to
win." These sentiments were
echoed by the rest of the JVs.
The loss spoiled the
intercollegiate coaching debut of

Percy Carr, who took over the
reigns of the JV team from Billy
Jones this fall. Carr, substituting
liberally throughout the contest,
played 11 members of the 18-man
squad.
After trailing by as much as 13
in the second half, a last-gasp
Stanford rally narrowed the gap
to five with just over two minutes
left in the game. That was as close
as the team came, as fouls and
turnovers enabled the Aggies to
boost the lead to 11 points at the
final buzzer.

For all intents and purposes,
the contest was won at the foul
line, where Davis hit 27 free
throws (for almost one-third of its
point total) to Stanford's eight.
The Cards committed 28 fouls.
Other Stanford players to
break into double figures for the
night were Scott Russell with 18
points and Warner Session, who
netted 10. Both were instrumental
in the Card's closing rally.
Next action for the JVs will be
Jan. 4, when they travel to the
state capital to take on
Sacramento State.
