# Bruner Sets Two Swim Records
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
Freshman Mike Bruner
highlighted last weekend's
Stanford Invitational Swim Meet,
breaking school records in the 500-
and 1650-yard freestyle events.
Bruner's 500 free time of
4:32.2 eclipsed Steve Strong's
standard of 4:36.06, while his
15:51.6 clocking in the 1650 free
erased Strong's record of 15:57.6.
Bruner also won the 200-yard
butterfly.
The meet, which featured
Pacific Eight rival Cal along with
an assortment of AAU swim clubs
in the Bay Area, was little more
than an opportunity for the
swimmers to sharpen their
competitive skills, and no score
was kept. Stanford swimmers,
however, won all but one event.
"He's still not in shape," said
coach Jim Gaughran of, champion
breaststroker John Hencken. The
feeble Hencken was in such poor
condition that he managed only

four first place finishes, winning
both the 100 and 200-yard
breastroke (59.8 and 2:09.2,
respectively), the 50 free (21.9)
and the 200 individual medley
(1:58.9).
Another bright spot in the two
day affair was the performance of
freshman Stu Corliss, whose 2:11
in the 200 breastroke is, according
to Gaughran, "right around what
he did at the [AAU] Nationals
this summer, so we really look
forward to him having a great

year."
Gaughran was especially
pleased with the performances of
Craig Van Zandt and Paul Clark,
whose water polo commitments
had kept them from working out
with the team all season.
Obviously in good shape,
sophomore Van Zandt took the
200-yard free in the time of
1:46.4 while Clark, a junior, won
the 400 individual medley and
garnered a second behind Bruner
in the 200 fly.
