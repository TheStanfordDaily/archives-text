## Biz Completes Rout Of Cal 
### PETE BHATIA 
Fall quarter IM's are slowly grinding to a halt
this week as the quarterly horror of finals cuts into
the Stanford jock's lifestyle.
On the top if the IM news this week is the
continuing story of Stanford's domination of Cal
on the gridiron this season. In a game played Big
Game morn Stanford's champ Biz II had a little
trouble before downing Cal's response, the
Alameda Trout, 36-32.
It was a wild game, fitting with the bigger game
to follow. In the first half, there were eight
possessions and seven scores. The only time a team
did not score was when the Bizzers got the ball
back with only 30 seconds to play in the half.
It took the Cal weenies only two plays to score
at the game's beginning and after that the two
traded scores for the remainder of the half. The Biz
scores included two bombs from quarterback Gary
Steele to his favorite receivers, La wry Lieberman
and Marty O'Donaghue.
In the second stanza, Biz regained the lead with
a 30-yard toss to Lieberman, but the Trout, not to
be denied, scored on their next possession and led
32-28. It was a defensive struggle, so to speak, for
most of the game's remaining 10 minutes.
But with only five minutes to play on the
stadium clock, Steele launched a picture-perfect
toufchdown pass of 45 yards to O'Donaghue, who
made a nice over-the-shoulder catch.
The two-pointer was good and the Biz defense
dammed up the Trout for the remainder of the
game to come home a 36-32 victor.
Meanwhile, back on campus, most sports have
come to an end. Adelfa took the B football
championship an overtime 20-19 win over the

Firehouse. The Adelfa scores came on to tosses
from quarterback Jim Stephenson to Jim Winzler,
who caught two, and Dave Laxson. Adelfa also won
the mammoth 200-team tennis doubles tourney.
Other title winners included JRA's Mike
Schmidt and Tom Duralde in the two-player A
volleyball finals. Duralde and Schmidt, both
members of Stanford's volleyball team, defeated
the Hammers in the finals. They were top-seeded.
Theta Delta Chi, seeking an unprecedented
fourth consecutive IM championship, is once again
the point leader in unofficial fall totals released
today. The Theta Delts scored 291, points according
to the preliminary count. That total breaks their
own fall quarter record of 273V2 set last year.
The big sports for the Theta Delts were tennis,
volleyball, football and free throws.
In addition, they won cross country and finished
second in wrestling under the coaching of 150 lb.
champion Terry "Monterey Jacque Fro mage"
Alkana. Biz 11, winner of football and free throws,
is now in second with 277.%. JRA holds third at
220, followed in the unofficial totals by KA, (170),
Adelfa (160), Zeta Psi (150) and DU (130).

on the gridiron this season. In a game played Big
Game morn Stanford's champ Biz II had a little
trouble before downing Cal's response, the
Alameda Trout, 36-32.
It was a wild game, fitting with the bigger game
to follow. In the first half, there were eight
possessions and seven scores. The only time a team
did not score was when the Bizzers got the ball
back with only 30 seconds to play in the half.
It took the Cal weenies only two plays to score
at the game's beginning and after that the two
traded scores for the remainder of the half. The Biz
scores included two bombs from quarterback Gary
Steele to his favorite receivers, La wry Lieberman
and Marty O'Donaghue.
In the second stanza, Biz regained the lead with
a 30-yard toss to Lieberman, but the Trout, not to
be denied, scored on their next possession and led
32-28. It was a defensive struggle, so to speak, for
most of the game's remaining 10 minutes.
But with only five minutes to play on the
stadium clock, Steele launched a picture-perfect
toufchdown pass of 45 yards to O'Donaghue, who
made a nice over-the-shoulder catch.
The two-pointer was good and the Biz defense
dammed up the Trout for the remainder of the
game to come home a 36-32 victor.
Meanwhile, back on campus, most sports have
come to an end. Adelfa took the B football
championship an overtime 20-19 win over the

Firehouse. The Adelfa scores came on to tosses
from quarterback Jim Stephenson to Jim Winzler,
who caught two, and Dave Laxson. Adelfa also won
the mammoth 200-team tennis doubles tourney.
Other title winners included JRA's Mike
Schmidt and Tom Duralde in the two-player A
volleyball finals. Duralde and Schmidt, both
members of Stanford's volleyball team, defeated
the Hammers in the finals. They were top-seeded.
Theta Delta Chi, seeking an unprecedented
fourth consecutive IM championship, is once again
the point leader in unofficial fall totals released
today. The Theta Delts scored 291, points according
to the preliminary count. That total breaks their
own fall quarter record of 273V2 set last year.
The big sports for the Theta Delts were tennis,
volleyball, football and free throws.
In addition, they won cross country and finished
second in wrestling under the coaching of 150 lb.
champion Terry "Monterey Jacque Fro mage"
Alkana. Biz 11, winner of football and free throws,
is now in second with 277.%. JRA holds third at
220, followed in the unofficial totals by KA, (170),
Adelfa (160), Zeta Psi (150) and DU (130).
