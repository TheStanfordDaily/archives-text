# Italian Chickens Beat Two At Once

Special To The Daily
FLORENCEâ€”On Saturday, Nov. 23, under cloudy Italian
skies, the undefeated and untied Stanford-in-ltaly
Thunderchickens demolished the combined Florentine forces of
Gonzaga and Santa Clara universities in a hotly contested
seven-man touch football game.
Led by an inspired defense that held the Bronco-Lion attack to
a lone touchdown, the Chickens rolled up 28 points in the first
half alone. The second half was never played, and the final score
entered the record books as 28-7.
Gonzaga's first possession resulted in a four-play, 72-yard drive
for a score. The Stanford defense shook off this early setback and
adjusted its complex "pick and roll" zone to stifle the
opponents' air attack for the remainder of the game.
A strong frong line, including Arthur "Eat 'em up" James and
Tom "Bum me out" O'Toole, harassed the beleagured backfield,
with James ending up with four sacks and O'Toole three.
Their stellar line play made it a simple task for the secondary
(Art "The Flash" Sida, Nello B. Mellow Conway, Bob "3B"
Henry and Jim "Culo" Hayes) to float like a butterfly and sting
like a bee.
The blitzing of Bob "II Cappo" Allegrotti intensified the
already magnificent pass-rush, and his toughness against the run
negated any threat in that department.
On offense, the diversified Stanford attack overwhelmed the
unfortunate Gonzaga-Santa Clara defense. Quarterback Allergotti
received impenatrable blocking from the pit bosses O'Toole and
James and wisely used his time to hit Hayes with three
touchdown passes and run for another himself.
The Thunderchicken victory becomes more impressive when
one considers the brutal game-eve hot-mulled wine and roasted
chestnut party and the fact that Stanford could only field seven
men, all players having to go both ways.
In the future, Stanford-in-ltaly may take on the Fighting Irish
of Notre Dame, Rome Campus, if Earl Butz or other interested
parties appropriate funds.
