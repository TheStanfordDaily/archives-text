The Stanford Indians Hockey
Club, the last campus organization
to maintain the traditional
nickname, would have made Chief
Lightfoot proud Tuesday night, as
it defeated the Sun Valley Bears
8-5 at Belmont.
The Indians began sluggishly
and fell behind early 3-1. They
passed poorly and skated badly, as
it appeared that playing two
games in three days was having an
effect.
Sparked by outstanding
defense and fine passing, the
Indians exploded for six second
period goals. The period ended
with the Indians in command 7-3.
Jay Johnston led the Indians
with successive second period
goals. The first came with the
Indians shorthanded, as Keith
Stewart was in the penalty box
for a tripping infraction.
Johnston, after receiving a pass
from Paul Martin, circled around
the net and slipped the puck
between the pads of goalie Don
Peck.
The final goal of the period on
a picture perfect play. Donny
Stewart, scrambling for the puck
along the side boards, cleared it
and passed to an unguarded Tom
Wolff who tipped it past the
surprised Bears goalie.
Coach Pat Baldwin stated, "We
stopped giving up the puck so
much in the defensive end and
we finally started getting it to the
middle of the ice."
In the closing period the Bears
came roaring out and scored two
quick goals on breakaways as the
Stanford defense faltered.
Kim Bretoi though, clinched

the game for the Indians as he
scored with eight minutes left.
Sunday afternoon the Indians
defeated Stockton 7-5, as they
outshot their hosts 48-29 to
completely dominate the game.
Baldwin cited Dave Lougee, goalie
Mike Sexton and Danny Schley,
who broke his nose in the game,
for outstanding performances.
After finishing in second place
in the "crash, kill" senior league
last year, Stanford started off
slow, losing three out of its first
four games. Baldwin explained, "I
purposely started us off slow,
because always before we began at
the beginning of school and by
mid-season we were burned out
and had lost interest."
That situation shouldn't occur
this year though, as Stanford will
play 12 games in January and
February, with trips to Colorado
and San Diego highlighting the
schedule.

February, with trips to Colorado
and San Diego highlighting the
schedule.
The Stanford Indians Hockey
Club, the last campus organization
to maintain the traditional
nickname, would have made Chief
Lightfoot proud Tuesday night, as
it defeated the Sun Valley Bears
8-5 at Belmont.
The Indians began sluggishly
and fell behind early 3-1. They
passed poorly and skated badly, as
it appeared that playing two
games in three days was having an
effect.
Sparked by outstanding
defense and fine passing, the
Indians exploded for six second
period goals. The period ended
with the Indians in command 7-3.
Jay Johnston led the Indians
with successive second period
goals. The first came with the
Indians shorthanded, as Keith
Stewart was in the penalty box
for a tripping infraction.
Johnston, after receiving a pass
from Paul Martin, circled around
the net and slipped the puck
between the pads of goalie Don
Peck.
The final goal of the period on
a picture perfect play. Donny
Stewart, scrambling for the puck
along the side boards, cleared it
and passed to an unguarded Tom
Wolff who tipped it past the
surprised Bears goalie.
Coach Pat Baldwin stated, "We
stopped giving up the puck so
much in the defensive end and
we finally started getting it to the
middle of the ice."
In the closing period the Bears
came roaring out and scored two
quick goals on breakaways as the
Stanford defense faltered.
Kim Bretoi though, clinched

the game for the Indians as he
scored with eight minutes left.
Sunday afternoon the Indians
defeated Stockton 7-5, as they
outshot their hosts 48-29 to
completely dominate the game.
Baldwin cited Dave Lougee, goalie
Mike Sexton and Danny Schley,
who broke his nose in the game,
for outstanding performances.
After finishing in second place
in the "crash, kill" senior league
last year, Stanford started off
slow, losing three out of its first
four games. Baldwin explained, "I
purposely started us off slow,
because always before we began at
the beginning of school and by
mid-season we were burned out
and had lost interest."
That situation shouldn't occur
this year though, as Stanford will
play 12 games in January and
February, with trips to Colorado
and San Diego highlighting the
schedule.
