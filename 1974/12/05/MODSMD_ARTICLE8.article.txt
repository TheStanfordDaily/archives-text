# Pioneer 11 Heading For Saturn's Rings
## 
### ROSARIO DE LA TORRE 
Pioneer 11 is now heading for an encounter
with Saturn in 1979. The spacecraft will pass
between the surface of the ringed planet and its
innermost ring.
Dr. Charles Hall, Pioneer Project manager at
NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
said yesterday the team of Pioneer scientists had
reached a unanimous decision to send the
570-pound probe into the 15,500 mile gap
between the planet and its rings.
Scientists using radar observations from earth

believe that the safest area for a fly-by is the area
between the surface of Saturn and its innermost
ring. The rings appear to be made up of fairly large
chunks of rock.
Dr. John H. Wolfe, Pioneer Project scientist,
explained that at a certain distance from the
planet, gravitational forces break up matter and
sweep it away. "We will send Pioneer 11 through
this clear space and hopefully avoid any collision
with debris, which would be disasterous," he said.
Pioneer 11 whipped around Jupiter Monday
night and returned close-up images of the giant

planet.
The spacecraft, in making man's second Jupiter
fly-by, survived with only minor radiation effects
after passing through the most intense part of
Jupiter's radiation belts.
Wolfe said at a press conference after the
successful fly-by, "I can't believe how healthy
everything is [on the spacecraft]."
Pioneer 11 encountered Jupiter 468 million
miles from earth and it took 42 minutes for
commands to reach the probe. The spacecraft was
officially re-christened Pioneer-Saturn after it
successfully emerged from behind Jupiter at 10:24
p.m. Monday.
Pioneer 11 executed a "corkscrew" turn around
Jupiter, approaching from the planet's south pole
and emerging over the north pole. This maneuver
not only gave scientists a look at Jupiter's polar
regions, but gave the spacecraft the velocity and
direction to speed to Saturn.
The spacecraft will travel almost five years
before it reaches the ringed planet. Pioneer 11 will
encounter Saturn on about Sept. 5,1979. If all of
Pioneer's instruments are still working, it will send
back close-up pictures of Saturn and of its rings.
Jupiter's gravitational pull accelerated Pioneer
11 to 107,000 miles per hour, making it the fastest
man-made object. It also passed closer to Jupiter
than any other spacecraft 26,000 miles above
the Jovian clouds.
Pioneer 11 returned the first close-up pictures
of Jupiter's polar regions which may harbor some
form of life. The poles are not visible from
earth-bound telescopes.
Scientists at Ames said that conditions at the
poles are such that life could exist. Because Jupiter
radiates most of its heat from its interior, there
would be adequate heat for some forms of life,
they added.

this clear space and hopefully avoid any collision
with debris, which would be disasterous," he said.
Pioneer 11 whipped around Jupiter Monday
night and returned close-up images of the giant

planet.
The spacecraft, in making man's second Jupiter
fly-by, survived with only minor radiation effects
after passing through the most intense part of
Jupiter's radiation belts.
Wolfe said at a press conference after the
successful fly-by, "I can't believe how healthy
everything is [on the spacecraft]."
Pioneer 11 encountered Jupiter 468 million
miles from earth and it took 42 minutes for
commands to reach the probe. The spacecraft was
officially re-christened Pioneer-Saturn after it
successfully emerged from behind Jupiter at 10:24
p.m. Monday.
Pioneer 11 executed a "corkscrew" turn around
Jupiter, approaching from the planet's south pole
and emerging over the north pole. This maneuver
not only gave scientists a look at Jupiter's polar
regions, but gave the spacecraft the velocity and
direction to speed to Saturn.
The spacecraft will travel almost five years
before it reaches the ringed planet. Pioneer 11 will
encounter Saturn on about Sept. 5,1979. If all of
Pioneer's instruments are still working, it will send
back close-up pictures of Saturn and of its rings.
Jupiter's gravitational pull accelerated Pioneer
11 to 107,000 miles per hour, making it the fastest
man-made object. It also passed closer to Jupiter
than any other spacecraft 26,000 miles above
the Jovian clouds.
Pioneer 11 returned the first close-up pictures
of Jupiter's polar regions which may harbor some
form of life. The poles are not visible from
earth-bound telescopes.
Scientists at Ames said that conditions at the
poles are such that life could exist. Because Jupiter
radiates most of its heat from its interior, there
would be adequate heat for some forms of life,
they added.

I with Jupiter and the probe is future encounter with Saturn.
Pioneer 11 is now heading for an encounter
with Saturn in 1979. The spacecraft will pass
between the surface of the ringed planet and its
innermost ring.
Dr. Charles Hall, Pioneer Project manager at
NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
said yesterday the team of Pioneer scientists had
reached a unanimous decision to send the
570-pound probe into the 15,500 mile gap
between the planet and its rings.
Scientists using radar observations from earth

believe that the safest area for a fly-by is the area
between the surface of Saturn and its innermost
ring. The rings appear to be made up of fairly large
chunks of rock.
Dr. John H. Wolfe, Pioneer Project scientist,
explained that at a certain distance from the
planet, gravitational forces break up matter and
sweep it away. "We will send Pioneer 11 through
this clear space and hopefully avoid any collision
with debris, which would be disasterous," he said.
