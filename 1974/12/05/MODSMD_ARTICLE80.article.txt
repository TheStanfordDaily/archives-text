# BATS Wins Rugby Event
## 
### 
The perennially strong Bay Area
Touring Side (BATS), using five
former Stanford rugby players,
including JV football coach Doug
Single and former New England
Patriot Ron Kadziel, won the
Stanford 10-a-side rugby
tournament last Saturday, beating
the Peninsula Ramblers 10-6.
Although the traditional rugger
kegger after the affair was cut
short because of darkness, the
56-team event, which kicks off
the Northern California rugby
season, was termed a "great
success" by tournament organizer
and Card rugby coach Pete
Kmetovic. "We completed the
championship game just as the last
referee ran out of gas, so I guess
you could call it a success,"
Kmetovic said.
The Card ruggers tied the XO's
for third place, after losing to the
Ramblers in the semi-finals 6-4.
Although Kmetovic was too
busy rounding up officials for the
massive event to see his Cards
compete, he was able to name
some standouts. "I think our
standoff Bill Conway and Renauld
Moore played a fine game for us,"
Kmetovic said.
Kmetovic said that the Cards
need to find some "big scrum
men," before the home opener
against St. Mary's on Jan. 4.
