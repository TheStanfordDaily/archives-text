# Writer Probes ‘Phenomena’
## Yoga Linked To Sports 
### DAN PYNE 
The reporter walks in the front
to Roble Gym and realizes
**he doesn't know what the heck
he's doing. He asks the secretary
where the guy is talking on sport
and yoga and she tells him "in the
lounge," down the hall and on the
left.
Down the hall and on the left
a wall. The reporter enters
a door on the right and takes a
seat in an almost empty room.
Two sofas and a lot of wooden
folding chairs are arranged in a
semi-circle around an easy chair.
On a bookshelf in the corner are
Reader's Digest Condensed
Books volumes. y
Students filter in, mill around,
sit down and talk. The reporter
tries to look familiar.
The speaker arrives. He's
introduced as Mike Murphy,
of Golf and the Kingdom.
He's a Stanford alumnus.
Yoga and Sport
Murphy scans his audience
with calm eyes and a slow smile,
then begins. Yoga and sport. He
explains that he is trying to
the relationship
between the physical phenomena
of Eastern disciplines and the
physical phenomena in sports. He
thinks athletes unconsciously pick
up a lot of the disciplines of yoga
and other body-control
* Yogis can change their weight
or size, to become heavier or
lighter or taller or shorter.
Murphy asks whether athletes can
do the same, but it's a rhetorical

question.
He says he is looking for the
instances in sport "where athletes
do things yogis have done." Like
distance runners controlling their
metabolism to combat fatigue. Or
swimmers holding their breath for
long periods of time. Any
"extraordinary control of the
body functions," he explains.
Mystical Experience
Murphy says he has worked
with pro athletes like John Brodie
and Johnny Miller and Jack
Nicklaus, discussing these
experiences, and he says they have
indicated they have had
"mystical" experiences; perfect
concentration, mental telepathy,
super-consistency.
The problem is that most
people don't like to discuss their
experiences, Murphy says, and he
proceeds to demonstrate.
"Did any of you ever have one
of these experiences?" he asks his
audience. One hand rises timidly,
but does not elaborate.
Murphy tries again. "How
many of you have felt this way, or
experiences this type of thing?"
Two people respond.
"How many of you haven't
ever experienced anything like
this?" Two people respond.
"This is what I'm getting at,"
he says. "Two people have, and
two people haven't, and the rest
of you haven't had this type of
experience and haven't not had
this type of experience." The
audience chuckles.
"I'm sure we've all had these
experiences before, says a girl in a

blue shirt. "It's just hard to put
them in words. And we just didn't
think of it at the time."
Murphy pursues the talker. He
says that the best way to
understand the mysticism is
through the discussion of personal
experience. The girl in the blue
shirt explains how she can see a
yoga-like psychology in her
tennis.
Murphy smiles.
A guy in a white and green and
yellow jersey tells about a time he
blanked out while running a punt
return. "I remember catching the
ball, and taking a few steps, and
then I was in the end zone." The
reporter recalled Mike Langford
saying he didn't remember kicking
the winning field goal against Cal.
Surrender To Body
Murphy smiles again. The yoga
in sport lies in "surrendering to
the body. Your mind is empty."
The mind is one with the body,
both controlling it and controlled
by it.
The discovery of the
relationship between Eastern
disciplines and modern sports is
valuable, he says, because "it
would make sport much more a
character art and it would
improve the performance of
athletes. Great coaches have a
knack for tapping these
resources..."
Murphy admits that some of
the attempts at correlating
mysticism and phenomena in
sports is contrived. "There's a lot
of lore, but it gets a lot like the
flying saucer controversy. You
begin to think that in the middle
of all the reports there's going to
be some fact."
That is what he tries to clarify
in his book.
The discussion is intriguing,
then over. A lot of what
transpired seems vague and
argumentive. But Mike Murphy's
calm and confident smile fades
slowly from the back of the
reporter's mind.

where the guy is talking on sport
and yoga and she tells him "in the
lounge," down the hall and on the
left.
Down the hall and on the left
a wall. The reporter enters
a door on the right and takes a
seat in an almost empty room.
Two sofas and a lot of wooden
folding chairs are arranged in a
semi-circle around an easy chair.
On a bookshelf in the corner are
Reader's Digest Condensed
Books volumes. y
Students filter in, mill around,
sit down and talk. The reporter
tries to look familiar.
The speaker arrives. He's
introduced as Mike Murphy,
of Golf and the Kingdom.
He's a Stanford alumnus.
Yoga and Sport
Murphy scans his audience
with calm eyes and a slow smile,
then begins. Yoga and sport. He
explains that he is trying to
the relationship
between the physical phenomena
of Eastern disciplines and the
physical phenomena in sports. He
thinks athletes unconsciously pick
up a lot of the disciplines of yoga
and other body-control
* Yogis can change their weight
or size, to become heavier or
lighter or taller or shorter.
Murphy asks whether athletes can
do the same, but it's a rhetorical

question.
He says he is looking for the
instances in sport "where athletes
do things yogis have done." Like
distance runners controlling their
metabolism to combat fatigue. Or
swimmers holding their breath for
long periods of time. Any
"extraordinary control of the
body functions," he explains.
Mystical Experience
Murphy says he has worked
with pro athletes like John Brodie
and Johnny Miller and Jack
Nicklaus, discussing these
experiences, and he says they have
indicated they have had
"mystical" experiences; perfect
concentration, mental telepathy,
super-consistency.
The problem is that most
people don't like to discuss their
experiences, Murphy says, and he
proceeds to demonstrate.
"Did any of you ever have one
of these experiences?" he asks his
audience. One hand rises timidly,
but does not elaborate.
Murphy tries again. "How
many of you have felt this way, or
experiences this type of thing?"
Two people respond.
"How many of you haven't
ever experienced anything like
this?" Two people respond.
"This is what I'm getting at,"
he says. "Two people have, and
two people haven't, and the rest
of you haven't had this type of
experience and haven't not had
this type of experience." The
audience chuckles.
"I'm sure we've all had these
experiences before, says a girl in a

blue shirt. "It's just hard to put
them in words. And we just didn't
think of it at the time."
Murphy pursues the talker. He
says that the best way to
understand the mysticism is
through the discussion of personal
experience. The girl in the blue
shirt explains how she can see a
yoga-like psychology in her
tennis.
Murphy smiles.
A guy in a white and green and
yellow jersey tells about a time he
blanked out while running a punt
return. "I remember catching the
ball, and taking a few steps, and
then I was in the end zone." The
reporter recalled Mike Langford
saying he didn't remember kicking
the winning field goal against Cal.
Surrender To Body
Murphy smiles again. The yoga
in sport lies in "surrendering to
the body. Your mind is empty."
The mind is one with the body,
both controlling it and controlled
by it.
The discovery of the
relationship between Eastern
disciplines and modern sports is
valuable, he says, because "it
would make sport much more a
character art and it would
improve the performance of
athletes. Great coaches have a
knack for tapping these
resources..."
Murphy admits that some of
the attempts at correlating
mysticism and phenomena in
sports is contrived. "There's a lot
of lore, but it gets a lot like the
flying saucer controversy. You
begin to think that in the middle
of all the reports there's going to
be some fact."
That is what he tries to clarify
in his book.
The discussion is intriguing,
then over. A lot of what
transpired seems vague and
argumentive. But Mike Murphy's
calm and confident smile fades
slowly from the back of the
reporter's mind.
The reporter walks in the front

Down the hall and on the left
a wall. The reporter enters
a door on the right and takes a
seat in an almost empty room.
Two sofas and a lot of wooden
folding chairs are arranged in a
semi-circle around an easy chair.
On a bookshelf in the corner are
Reader's Digest Condensed
Books volumes. y
Students filter in, mill around,
sit down and talk. The reporter
tries to look familiar.
The speaker arrives. He's
introduced as Mike Murphy,
of Golf and the Kingdom.
He's a Stanford alumnus.
Yoga and Sport
Murphy scans his audience
with calm eyes and a slow smile,
then begins. Yoga and sport. He
explains that he is trying to
the relationship
between the physical phenomena
of Eastern disciplines and the
physical phenomena in sports. He
thinks athletes unconsciously pick
up a lot of the disciplines of yoga
and other body-control
* Yogis can change their weight
or size, to become heavier or
lighter or taller or shorter.
Murphy asks whether athletes can
do the same, but it's a rhetorical

question.
He says he is looking for the
instances in sport "where athletes
do things yogis have done." Like
distance runners controlling their
metabolism to combat fatigue. Or
swimmers holding their breath for
long periods of time. Any
"extraordinary control of the
body functions," he explains.
Mystical Experience
Murphy says he has worked
with pro athletes like John Brodie
and Johnny Miller and Jack
Nicklaus, discussing these
experiences, and he says they have
indicated they have had
"mystical" experiences; perfect
concentration, mental telepathy,
super-consistency.
The problem is that most
people don't like to discuss their
experiences, Murphy says, and he
proceeds to demonstrate.
"Did any of you ever have one
of these experiences?" he asks his
audience. One hand rises timidly,
but does not elaborate.
Murphy tries again. "How
many of you have felt this way, or
experiences this type of thing?"
Two people respond.
"How many of you haven't
ever experienced anything like
this?" Two people respond.
"This is what I'm getting at,"
he says. "Two people have, and
two people haven't, and the rest
of you haven't had this type of
experience and haven't not had
this type of experience." The
audience chuckles.
"I'm sure we've all had these
experiences before, says a girl in a

blue shirt. "It's just hard to put
them in words. And we just didn't
think of it at the time."
Murphy pursues the talker. He
says that the best way to
understand the mysticism is
through the discussion of personal
experience. The girl in the blue
shirt explains how she can see a
yoga-like psychology in her
tennis.
Murphy smiles.
A guy in a white and green and
yellow jersey tells about a time he
blanked out while running a punt
return. "I remember catching the
ball, and taking a few steps, and
then I was in the end zone." The
reporter recalled Mike Langford
saying he didn't remember kicking
the winning field goal against Cal.
Surrender To Body
Murphy smiles again. The yoga
in sport lies in "surrendering to
the body. Your mind is empty."
The mind is one with the body,
both controlling it and controlled
by it.
The discovery of the
relationship between Eastern
disciplines and modern sports is
valuable, he says, because "it
would make sport much more a
character art and it would
improve the performance of
athletes. Great coaches have a
knack for tapping these
resources..."
Murphy admits that some of
the attempts at correlating
mysticism and phenomena in
sports is contrived. "There's a lot
of lore, but it gets a lot like the
flying saucer controversy. You
begin to think that in the middle
of all the reports there's going to
be some fact."
That is what he tries to clarify
in his book.
The discussion is intriguing,
then over. A lot of what
transpired seems vague and
argumentive. But Mike Murphy's
calm and confident smile fades
slowly from the back of the
reporter's mind.
