# Fencers Display Balanced Strength
## 
### MARTIN STEVENS 
The strength of the Stanford
fencing program has been well
demonstrated this year, with all
three men's teams undefeated,
and the women's team ranking
second in their division. If early
trends continue, Stanford fencers
should make a strong showing at
the NorCal Championships in
February, as well as at the Far
Western Championships (featuring
all schools west of Colorado) and
possibly even at the NCAA
Championships.
* Thus far this season Stanford
scored a "hat trick" with all three
men's teams (foil, epee, and sabre)
placing first as a team in the
pre-season meets. In addition, the
epee and sabre teams qualified
first in the Central division for the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Championships,
which will be held in February.
The foil team qualifying meet will
be held Dec. 7, and Stanford's
chances are quite good to
complete a sweep of the men's
In the women's competition,
held only in foil, Stanford
finished second in the preseason
meet, even with team captain
Marie Fiatarone at less than top
form due to illness. Division
powerhouse San Jose State took
Inrst handily, but the women hope
to give them a battle at the
qualifying meet and again at the

Nor Gals.
This strong pre-season showing
of all the Stanford teams is
indicative of much more than
talent. It speaks well of the entire
program of fencing at Stanford,
since most team members have
received all their instruction in
fencing here. Much of the credit
must go to the leadership and
active instruction program of the
Women's PE Department and
coach Jean Helliwell.
Assessing the team's chances,
Coach Helliwell believes "we
should make an excellent showing
in all three men's weapons, both
at the Norcals and at the Far
Westerns. The women should do
well also, but they have their
work cut out for them against San
Jose."
Individual standouts on the
varsity team include: Matty
Grose and Jack Handy, first and
third respectively at the foil
pre-season meet; Stephen Walt,
fourth at the epee pre-season meet
and first in the epee qualifying
meet, Mark Eaton, second in both
epee meets. In the sabre
qualifying, all three team
members reached the finals with
Lee Vanderveld placing second,
Chris Burke fifth and Dave Moyer
sixth. In women's foil, Claudia
Temby placed third individually
and Marie Fiatarone captured
fifth in pre-season competition.
