# Card Hooters Make All-Conference List
## 
### 
It's been sort of a long season
for the Stanford soccer team, but
things brightened up recently.
Mac Taylor was selected to the
West Coast Intercollegiate Soccer
All-Conference first team, Marty
Glickfeld and Phil Wright were
named to the second team, and
Bruce Mosbacher, Jim Stokes, and
Robby Robb received honorable
mention distinctions.
Taylor played a sort of
"sweeping fullback" position for
the Cards, picking up opposing
forwards who got through the
Stanford defense, and sometimes
moving all the way up to the
forward line.
Taylor's selection came as no
surprise to coach Fred Priddle.
"At the beginning of the season
we had Â£o much confidence in
Mac we picked him as the one
member of our team most likely
to be drafted by the pros. He's
just the tops; he anchored our
whole defense."
Team Effort
Priddle, who has nothing but
kind words for Taylor, said his
selection, and the selection of the
other players to the
All-Conference team was a credit
to the entire Stanford team.
Wright played both forward
and halfback for the Cards this
season, and led all Stanford

scoring with eight goals.
Glickfeld, who added a flair to
games with his agile dribbling and
tendency to get kicked by irate
opponents, also received the
Harry Maloney trophy at the
annual soccer banquet last night.
The award is presented to "the
player who has contributed the
most towards the advancement of
soccer at Stanford.
'Pele' Cup
The "Pele" Cup, made possible
by the Stanford Club of Brazil,
was presented to Robb for
"consistently displaying
outstanding qualities of playing
ability and leadership.
Mosbacher, who spent some
trying moments in the Cardinal
goal, received the team's Most
Valuable Player award; Skip
Pfeiffer was awarded the varsity
Most Improved Player trophy.
On the junior varsity team,
Steve Arnold received the season's
MVP award and Frank Johns
received the MIP award.
Steve Timmons was awarded
the freshman MVP trophy, and
Ted Robinson the MIP award.
Next year Priddle indicated he
will have almost his entire team
back, plus forwards Brian
Bershader, who took this quarter
off, Bobby Seiger, who is
overseas, and Ric Caldwell.

Taylor, chases this Santa Clara player in a game the Cards won 2-1.
Stanford's season ended Nov. 21, but Taylor and most of the rest of
this year's booters will be back again next year.
