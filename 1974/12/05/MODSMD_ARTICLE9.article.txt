## editorials Input On Budget 
### 
With the University Administration planning major cost cuts in
response to its current financial crisis, the need for student
participation in the decision-making process is more critical than ever
before.
Too often in the past, students have not been informed of major
University decisions until after those decisions had been finalized.
Last year's unexpectedly high tuition hike and transfer of the black
theme house from Roble to Lagunita are cases in point.
Hopefully, the University will display more willingness to seek
student input when it formulates its plans for paring the budget, and
will not merely present students with a fait accompli.
The University's recent affirmation of its intentions to eliminate
weak programs altogether rather than to slice costs straight across the
board raises the question of what exactly constitutes a "weak" or
"unnecessary" program.
Many students have strong opinions about which programs should
be retained and which could be dropped in deference to Stanford's
deficit. They ought to have a chance to air their opinions during the
decision-making process.
It is a truism that the University's planning procedures are complex
especially in budgetary matters. But the Administration should
inform students in advance of what sort of cost cuts are being
considered so that students can register their opinions and give advice
before irrevocable decisions are made.
