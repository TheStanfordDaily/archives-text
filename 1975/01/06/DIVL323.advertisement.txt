While you are registering for Winter Quarter, think about this
summer.....maybe you will want to plan for it
Will you be only a few units short of graduation?
Will you be behind in distribution requirements?
Do you need to pick up a course in math, or physics, or
biology? (Bio majors and pre-meds 24S will be offered during
Summer 1975.)
Do you want to learn a language or take that studio art
course or dance class instead of being on the wait-list for it or
take the creative writing course that never seemed to fit into
your schedule or study Beckett at the Summer 1975 Samuel
Beckett Workshop?????
Maybe you will want to have time to enjoy your studies (un
dergrads may take as few as eight units) or work part time
while you take some courses?
THINK ABOUT IT and come by the Summer Session desk
in the Pavillion to see what courses are being offered.

While you are registering for Winter Quarter, think about this
summer.....maybe you will want to plan for it
Will you be only a few units short of graduation?
Will you be behind in distribution requirements?
Do you need to pick up a course in math, or physics, or
biology? (Bio majors and pre-meds 24S will be offered during
Summer 1975.)
Do you want to learn a language or take that studio art
course or dance class instead of being on the wait-list for it or
take the creative writing course that never seemed to fit into
your schedule or study Beckett at the Summer 1975 Samuel
Beckett Workshop?????
Maybe you will want to have time to enjoy your studies (un
dergrads may take as few as eight units) or work part time
while you take some courses?
THINK ABOUT IT and come by the Summer Session desk
in the Pavillion to see what courses are being offered.
