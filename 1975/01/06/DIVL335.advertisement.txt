The major interest of this international artist has been in the
colors of the rainbow. AY-O's work with these colors surveys their
emotional and graphic fascination in his own distinctive style.
It seemed only natural that The Bank of Tokyo should bring
this exhibit to the home of The Rainbow Package Plan, with its
checking, credit and banking services for a low monthly charge.
We hope you will enjoy becoming familiar with the art of
AY-0 and take this opportunity to become acquainted with our
Rainbow Package Plan.
