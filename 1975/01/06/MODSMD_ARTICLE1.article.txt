# Rosenzweig Assumes New Post As Public Affairs Vice President
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
President ""Richard Lyman
appointed Robert M. Rosenzweig last
month as the University's first vice
president for public affairs.
Rosenzweig, who had served as vice
provost and adviser to Lyman since
1971, succeeded Director of
University Relations Frank Newman.
Newman left the University last
August to assume the presidency of
the University of Rhode Island.
Lyman told the Faculty Senate last
month that the appointment of
Rosenzweig represented "a frank
recognition that Stanford's relations

with local, state and federal agencies
had increased to the point that the
new post was necessary to cope with
the crucial nature of these relations."
In addition to handling the
University's federal, state and
community relations, Rosenzweig will
supervise the News and Publications
Service, the Office of Public Events
and other public affairs activities.
Provost William F. Miller said that,
as an economy move, Rosenzweig's
position as vice provost would not be
filled.
Rosenzweig was chosen from a field
of nearly 400 applicants and was the

strong choice of an informal panel of
faculty and staff who assisted Lyman
in screening finalists.
Assistant to the President William
E. Stone, who headed the panel, said
yesterday that Lyman's selection of
Rosenzweig was "based on the
collective judgment of the people on
the staff who had met the finalists."
Lyman said Rosenzweig is "the
ideal individual for an increasingly
sensitive and significant area of
University affairs." He added that the
decision to change the University
Relations post to a vice presidency
"very simply reflects the senior level
of the assignment and Bob's
qualifications to meet its
responsibilities."
Contacted last night, Rosenzweig
said he didn't "foresee any major
changes" in the University Relations
Office under his leadership. He said
the office has been "a well-run
operation as long as I've been at
Stanford."
'Smaller Staff'
Rosenzweig did predict, however,
that "we're going to have a smaller
staff, just like every other part of the
University."
Lyman once described Rosenzweig
as his "minister without portfolio"
and the new vice president said he
expects to continue "doing many of
the same things I have been in the past
few years being available to the
president and others when they have
something they want to talk about."
Rosenzweig said he would "try to
limit my travel as much as possible
because some of the most important
things affecting the future of the
University will be happening right here
on campus."
Community Relations
On a broader level, Rosenzweig said
that he and his staff will work "to
improve our relations with the city of

Palo Alto and other nearby
communities. Also, we have to get a
feel for what the new state
administration will be like and what its
attitudes toward education will be.
There haven't been very many signs
yet," he added.
Rosenzweig, 43, received his
bachelor's and master's degrees from
the University of Michigan and then
earned a Ph.D. in political science
from Yale. After two years as a
political science instructor at Amherst,
he moved on to a four-year stint at the
U.S. Office of Education.
He came here in 1962 to become
Associate Dean of the Graduate
Division. He held that position until
1967, when Lyman appointed him
associate provost. Later that year, he
became director of the Center for
Research in International Studies.
One year after Lyman became
president, he appointed Rosenzweig as
vice provost and adviser to the
president. The new vice president is
married, has two children and lives in
Palo Alto.

University Relations Frank Newman.
Newman left the University last
August to assume the presidency of
the University of Rhode Island.
Lyman told the Faculty Senate last
month that the appointment of
Rosenzweig represented "a frank
recognition that Stanford's relations

with local, state and federal agencies
had increased to the point that the
new post was necessary to cope with
the crucial nature of these relations."
In addition to handling the
University's federal, state and
community relations, Rosenzweig will
supervise the News and Publications
Service, the Office of Public Events
and other public affairs activities.
Provost William F. Miller said that,
as an economy move, Rosenzweig's
position as vice provost would not be
filled.
Rosenzweig was chosen from a field
of nearly 400 applicants and was the

strong choice of an informal panel of
faculty and staff who assisted Lyman
in screening finalists.
Assistant to the President William
E. Stone, who headed the panel, said
yesterday that Lyman's selection of
Rosenzweig was "based on the
collective judgment of the people on
the staff who had met the finalists."
Lyman said Rosenzweig is "the
ideal individual for an increasingly
sensitive and significant area of
University affairs." He added that the
decision to change the University
Relations post to a vice presidency
"very simply reflects the senior level
of the assignment and Bob's
qualifications to meet its
responsibilities."
Contacted last night, Rosenzweig
said he didn't "foresee any major
changes" in the University Relations
Office under his leadership. He said
the office has been "a well-run
operation as long as I've been at
Stanford."
'Smaller Staff'
Rosenzweig did predict, however,
that "we're going to have a smaller
staff, just like every other part of the
University."
Lyman once described Rosenzweig
as his "minister without portfolio"
and the new vice president said he
expects to continue "doing many of
the same things I have been in the past
few years being available to the
president and others when they have
something they want to talk about."
Rosenzweig said he would "try to
limit my travel as much as possible
because some of the most important
things affecting the future of the
University will be happening right here
on campus."
Community Relations
On a broader level, Rosenzweig said
that he and his staff will work "to
improve our relations with the city of

Palo Alto and other nearby
communities. Also, we have to get a
feel for what the new state
administration will be like and what its
attitudes toward education will be.
There haven't been very many signs
yet," he added.
Rosenzweig, 43, received his
bachelor's and master's degrees from
the University of Michigan and then
earned a Ph.D. in political science
from Yale. After two years as a
political science instructor at Amherst,
he moved on to a four-year stint at the
U.S. Office of Education.
He came here in 1962 to become
Associate Dean of the Graduate
Division. He held that position until
1967, when Lyman appointed him
associate provost. Later that year, he
became director of the Center for
Research in International Studies.
One year after Lyman became
president, he appointed Rosenzweig as
vice provost and adviser to the
president. The new vice president is
married, has two children and lives in
Palo Alto.
