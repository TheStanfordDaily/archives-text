# Strong Investigation Of CIA Needed
## 
### Jim Wascher 
Well, the CIA has done it again. Spying on
American citizens, after all, is clearly a
violation of the agency's charter.
After press disclosures of CIA involvement
in both the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office and the efforts to
"destabilize" the government of Chilean
President Salvador Allende, it was hard to
imagine how the agency could possibly
manage to dirty itself any more. It managed.
What each of these scandals indicates is
that the CIA should be far more closely
scrutinized by both Congress and the civilian
panel assigned as the agency's watchdog back
in 1961.
President Ford's appointment of an
eight-member commission to investigate the
latest allegations against the agency is a step
in the right direction. His previous request
for CIA Director William E. Colby to
investigate the charges himself was ridiculous
it reminded one of Dick Nixon's decision
to have John Ehrlichman investigate the
Watergate cover-up.
Ford's Idea
Ford's commission will be chaired by Vice
President Rockefeller, and will include
numerous other "blue ribbon" members,
including former Gov. Ronald Reagan and
two former Cabinet officers.
From 1969 up until his nomination to be
vice president, Rockefeller served on the
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board (PFIAB) which was formed by
President Kennedy in the wake of the Bay of
Pigs invasion of 1961.
According to the New York Times,
Kennedy instructed the Board to advise him

"concerning the objectives, conduct
management and coordination" of the CIA
and other intelligence gathering agencies and
"to conduct a continuing review and
assessment of intelligence and related
activities.
Board 'Strangely Inactive'
Despite the flurry of charges against the
CIA in the last few years, the PFIAB has
been strangely inactive. According to a
recently published book by a former CIA
employee, the Board meets infrequently and
receives little access to the CIA information
it requires. One wonders if the Rockefeller
Commission will have any more success.
And once the commission has completed
its investigation of domestic spying which
is just one small item out of the ClA's bag of
tricks the PFIAB will remain virtually
powerless to probe other agency misconduct.
President Ford should see to it that the
Board is empowered to collect the
information it needs and to act upon that
information once it is in hand.
Beyond that, the Congress ought to play a
more active role in overseeing the conduct of
the CIA. Once again, the domestic spying
charges have proven useful in this regard. No
less than four congressional panels have
announced their intention to probe the
spying allegations.
Efforts Resisted
But conservative, military-oriented
elements in the Congress have consistently
resisted efforts to establish an on-going
review of the CIA and its activities.
Twelve years ago, in proposing that the
Congress establish a Joint Committee on the

Central Intelligence Agency, Sen. Mike
Mansfield (D-Mont.) said "an urgent need
exists for regular and responsible
congressional scrutiny of the Central
Intelligence Agency. Such scrutiny is
essential to the success of our foreign policy,
to the preservation of our domocratic
processes and to the security of the
intelligence agency itself."
Even though Mansfield has since risen to
become Senate Majority Leader, he has been
unable to overcome the opposition of such
powerhouses as the late Sen. Richard Russell
(D-Ga.) and Sen. John Stennis (D-Miss.).
Today, under Stennis' leadership, the Senate
Armed Services Committee rarely even
discusses the CIA.
Resistance In House
In the House, advocates of tighter
supervision of the CIA have met with similar
resistance. Rep. Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich.), who
heads the intelligence oversight
subcommittee of the House Armed Services
Committee, possibly knew of the ClA's
domestic surveillance activities more than
one year ago and yet did nothing.
Since then, activists in the House have set
up a new subcommittee within the Foreign
Affairs Committee to bypass what they view
as foot-dragging by Nedzi.
Renewed efforts by concerned members
of Congress, including Mansfield, coupled
with sustained concern from the Executive
Branch, may not eliminate CIA abuses but
it's worth a try.

announced their intention to probe the
spying allegations.
Efforts Resisted
But conservative, military-oriented
elements in the Congress have consistently
resisted efforts to establish an on-going
review of the CIA and its activities.
Twelve years ago, in proposing that the
Congress establish a Joint Committee on the

Central Intelligence Agency, Sen. Mike
Mansfield (D-Mont.) said "an urgent need
exists for regular and responsible
congressional scrutiny of the Central
Intelligence Agency. Such scrutiny is
essential to the success of our foreign policy,
to the preservation of our domocratic
processes and to the security of the
intelligence agency itself."
Even though Mansfield has since risen to
become Senate Majority Leader, he has been
unable to overcome the opposition of such
powerhouses as the late Sen. Richard Russell
(D-Ga.) and Sen. John Stennis (D-Miss.).
Today, under Stennis' leadership, the Senate
Armed Services Committee rarely even
discusses the CIA.
Resistance In House
In the House, advocates of tighter
supervision of the CIA have met with similar
resistance. Rep. Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich.), who
heads the intelligence oversight
subcommittee of the House Armed Services
Committee, possibly knew of the ClA's
domestic surveillance activities more than
one year ago and yet did nothing.
Since then, activists in the House have set
up a new subcommittee within the Foreign
Affairs Committee to bypass what they view
as foot-dragging by Nedzi.
Renewed efforts by concerned members
of Congress, including Mansfield, coupled
with sustained concern from the Executive
Branch, may not eliminate CIA abuses but
it's worth a try.

Well, the CIA has done it again. Spying on
American citizens, after all, is clearly a
violation of the agency's charter.
After press disclosures of CIA involvement
in both the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office and the efforts to
"destabilize" the government of Chilean
President Salvador Allende, it was hard to
imagine how the agency could possibly
manage to dirty itself any more. It managed.
What each of these scandals indicates is
that the CIA should be far more closely
scrutinized by both Congress and the civilian
panel assigned as the agency's watchdog back
in 1961.
President Ford's appointment of an
eight-member commission to investigate the
latest allegations against the agency is a step
in the right direction. His previous request
for CIA Director William E. Colby to
investigate the charges himself was ridiculous
it reminded one of Dick Nixon's decision
to have John Ehrlichman investigate the
Watergate cover-up.
Ford's Idea
Ford's commission will be chaired by Vice
President Rockefeller, and will include
numerous other "blue ribbon" members,
including former Gov. Ronald Reagan and
two former Cabinet officers.
From 1969 up until his nomination to be
vice president, Rockefeller served on the
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board (PFIAB) which was formed by
President Kennedy in the wake of the Bay of
Pigs invasion of 1961.
According to the New York Times,
Kennedy instructed the Board to advise him

"concerning the objectives, conduct
management and coordination" of the CIA
and other intelligence gathering agencies and
"to conduct a continuing review and
assessment of intelligence and related
activities.
Board 'Strangely Inactive'
Despite the flurry of charges against the
CIA in the last few years, the PFIAB has
been strangely inactive. According to a
recently published book by a former CIA
employee, the Board meets infrequently and
receives little access to the CIA information
it requires. One wonders if the Rockefeller
Commission will have any more success.
And once the commission has completed
its investigation of domestic spying which
is just one small item out of the ClA's bag of
tricks the PFIAB will remain virtually
powerless to probe other agency misconduct.
President Ford should see to it that the
Board is empowered to collect the
information it needs and to act upon that
information once it is in hand.
Beyond that, the Congress ought to play a
more active role in overseeing the conduct of
the CIA. Once again, the domestic spying
charges have proven useful in this regard. No
less than four congressional panels have
announced their intention to probe the
spying allegations.
