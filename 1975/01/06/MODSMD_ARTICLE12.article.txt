# The 						Battle For Children's Minds
## 
### John Rorick 
The controversy over textbooks in public
schools has replaced busing as a focal point
of action by parents concerned about the
quality of education received by their
children.
While the national news media have
directed public attention to the heated
situation in Kanawha County, West Virginia,
the problem is much more widespread than it
would appear. Two suburban counties near
Washington, Montgomery and Prince Georges
of Maryland, have had similar, less publicized
experiences.
Basically, concerned parents are
demanding the removal of "offensive" texts,
or at least the right to have some say in text
selection. Dignified, unrestrained violence
contained in the books have drawn continual
fire. Civil libertarians claim that the parents'
demands constitute "censorship" and restrict
"a scholar's claim to academic freedom."
Earlier this month, five members of the
Prince Georges County school board
proposed an interesting remedy to the
disruptive situation. It was called the "basic
alternative school," a kind of school system
within the existing system.
Three R's, Plus One
As a basic alternative, parents would be
offered the choice of sending their children

to a no-nonsense, traditional school, which
would stress the development of educational
skills. The three R's, plus an additional R
Respect for American values would be
taught to the children.
Some of the guidelines laid down for the
schools may sound too good to be true to
concerned parents harried over the past
destructiveness of "permissive education":
â€”Strict discipline and order necessary to
maintain an atmosphere for learning would
be maintained; respect for high moral
standards, courtesy and patriotism would be
emphasized; dress and grooming standards
for both students and faculty would be
adhered to.
Pupils who disobey the rules will be
transferred back to the regular schools.
Another interesting aspect of the proposal
is that it calls for the elimination of all
federal and state assistance programs "dealing
with educational and/or social experimental
activities." Those parents who want their
children to become social guinea pigs for the
experimenters at HEW still have the freedom
of choice to send their children to existing
schools.
Pasadena Experiment
A similar program has been tried in the
Pasadena, California, school system since last
year. Scores on standardized achievement

tests, the same ones that are used to measure
educational development of students all over
the country, indicate that the students who
had attended the "basic alternative schools"
showed a significant increase.
The county board of education is
expected to take action on the proposal later
this month. Parents across the country will
find this innovative program a fresh
alternative to the "modern education" their
children may have been subjected to.
Parents have a legitimate concern about
the social experimentation taking place in
schools nationwide. They have a right to
question the textbooks and teaching methods
their children are exposed to. Parents should
also expect the schools they support with
their taxes to respect the moral and ethical
values they have tried to teach their children.
While not ignoring the worst in our
modern society, our schools should always
strive to perpetuate the best that society has
to offer the young. The "godless, obscene,
excessively violent view of the world" that
some of the HEW-supported textbooks
provide is certainly not the best that America
has to offer its young, nor can those views
lead the way to improve our country.
