# Chinese Helped Build California
## 
### Doug Chan 
The issue of "balance" in the exercise of
free speech rights is of vital concern to
citizens who comprise the various racial
minority groups in the United States. It is
particularly acute with respect to zenophobic
pronouncements by persons of influence in
the polity.
But Anthony Harrigan, executive vice
president of the United States Industrial
Council, in his article "Against Illegal Aliens"
(Daily, Dec. 5), subtly interweaves jingoist
misconceptions and clearly propogates
white-supremacist attitudes, the nature of
which I was surprised to read in the Daily.
Harrigan declares: "America was settled
by people from many parts of the world.
Immigrants from the British Isles, Germany,
Poland, Southern and Central Europe cleared
the forests and built America's canals,
railroads and cities."
But Harrigan neglects to mentiqn that the
geographical area had already been settled by
Native Americans. He also denies, through
omission, the roles which black, brown and
yellow people have played in the building of
the United States.
This paragraph is patently offensive from

a Chinese-American historical perspective of
150 years, because the evidence clearly
indicates the crucial part played by Chinese
in the political economy of the U.S.
Chinese workers were primarily
responsible for the development of
California's agricultural industry in the
second half of the nineteenth century. They
reclaimed thousands of acres of swampland,
transforming them into the farming valleys
upon which California's economy is based.
At the time of their forcible ouster by whites
in the 1890s, Chinese comprised 75 percent
of the total rural labor force.
To claim that railroad-building was the
exclusive preserve of Europeon immigrants is
another mockery. This university was
founded on a $3O million grant from Leland
Stanford Sr.'s profits from the Central Pacific
Railroad. Four out of every five persons
hired by the Central Pacific to build the
western link of the Transcontinental Railroad
were Chinese; their average wage was $26 per
month. The loss of life in that effort has been
conservatively estimated at 1200 workers.
And more railroad work followed for the
Central Pacific, the Southern Pacific and the

Canadian Pacific—up and down the entire
West Coast, into Idaho, Montana and Nevada.

In raising the spectre of swarms of illegal
aliens (without reference to any specific
source other than former Atty. Gen. William
Saxbe and what "the U.S. Immigration
Service believes"), Harrigan has written a
thinly veiled diatribe against the whole
notion of legal, and especially non-white,
immigration.
His blatant ignorance of the contributions
of Third World peoples in the U.S. certainly
facilitates the task.
But his behavior is nothing new. On May
6, 1882, the Chinese became the first race
specifically named in the so-called "Chinese
Exclusion Acts."
Harrigan only represents the latest
generation of an American phenomenon
reknowned for its profound nonsense and
ignorance. As for us "Longtime Californ's,"
obviously the pertinent question for this
University to ask itself is why he isn't aware.

white-supremacist attitudes, the nature of
which I was surprised to read in the Daily.
Harrigan declares: "America was settled
by people from many parts of the world.
Immigrants from the British Isles, Germany,
Poland, Southern and Central Europe cleared
the forests and built America's canals,
railroads and cities."
But Harrigan neglects to mentiqn that the
geographical area had already been settled by
Native Americans. He also denies, through
omission, the roles which black, brown and
yellow people have played in the building of
the United States.
This paragraph is patently offensive from

a Chinese-American historical perspective of
150 years, because the evidence clearly
indicates the crucial part played by Chinese
in the political economy of the U.S.
Chinese workers were primarily
responsible for the development of
California's agricultural industry in the
second half of the nineteenth century. They
reclaimed thousands of acres of swampland,
transforming them into the farming valleys
upon which California's economy is based.
At the time of their forcible ouster by whites
in the 1890s, Chinese comprised 75 percent
of the total rural labor force.
To claim that railroad-building was the
exclusive preserve of Europeon immigrants is
another mockery. This university was
founded on a $3O million grant from Leland
Stanford Sr.'s profits from the Central Pacific
Railroad. Four out of every five persons
hired by the Central Pacific to build the
western link of the Transcontinental Railroad
were Chinese; their average wage was $26 per
month. The loss of life in that effort has been
conservatively estimated at 1200 workers.
And more railroad work followed for the
Central Pacific, the Southern Pacific and the

Canadian Pacific—up and down the entire
West Coast, into Idaho, Montana and Nevada.

In raising the spectre of swarms of illegal
aliens (without reference to any specific
source other than former Atty. Gen. William
Saxbe and what "the U.S. Immigration
Service believes"), Harrigan has written a
thinly veiled diatribe against the whole
notion of legal, and especially non-white,
immigration.
His blatant ignorance of the contributions
of Third World peoples in the U.S. certainly
facilitates the task.
But his behavior is nothing new. On May
6, 1882, the Chinese became the first race
specifically named in the so-called "Chinese
Exclusion Acts."
Harrigan only represents the latest
generation of an American phenomenon
reknowned for its profound nonsense and
ignorance. As for us "Longtime Californ's,"
obviously the pertinent question for this
University to ask itself is why he isn't aware.
(Doug Chan is an undergraduate and a
resident associate in Junipero, the Asian
American theme house.)
The issue of "balance" in the exercise of
free speech rights is of vital concern to
citizens who comprise the various racial
minority groups in the United States. It is
particularly acute with respect to zenophobic
pronouncements by persons of influence in
the polity.
But Anthony Harrigan, executive vice
president of the United States Industrial
Council, in his article "Against Illegal Aliens"
(Daily, Dec. 5), subtly interweaves jingoist
misconceptions and clearly propogates
white-supremacist attitudes, the nature of
which I was surprised to read in the Daily.
