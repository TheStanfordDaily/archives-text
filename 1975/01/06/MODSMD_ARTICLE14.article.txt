# To End Arms Insanity
## 
### Douglas Mattern 
The new arms agreement
outlined by President Ford is
another of the pseudo-triumphs so
typical of the Nixon-Kis
singer-Ford mold.
Rather than reducing arms, the
agreement follows the pattern of
SALT I by virtually sanctioning
current escalation and allowing
such long-term weapon programs
as the Trident submarine and
missile, the B-l bomber, and the
fu 11 deployment of multiple
warheads (MIRV) to proceed as
previously scheduled. In fact, the
agreement actually increases the
number of MIRVed missiles to
over 1300, which is more than
had been planned.
This means our nation will go -?
ahead with the program to
increase the present 7100 nuclear
weapons actually targeted, to the
10,000 range as agreed in the
SALT I Conference. Similar
increases tire, of course, allowed
the USSR.
In the real world, such
numbers are basically meaningless
as they have long exceeded the
overkill region. Most arms experts
estimate that no more than
400-500 nuclear weapons could
be used before total destruction,
With many top experts giving a
much lower figure.
Obsolescence Continues
Yet by allowing current
. astronomical overkill forces to
continue and even expand, the
agreement guarantees the arms
industry will maintain its huge
volume of business through the
well established pattern of
weapon obsolescence and
replacement.
As an example, the recent
19 74 Electronic Industries
Association meeting predicted a
Pentagon budget of $lO6 billion
by 1980, agreeing closely with the
$llO billion estimate by the
Brookings Institute. In a recent
news conference, Ford confirmed
these predictions by assuring all
Ame r i cans that the Defense
Department budget will continue
to rise over the coming years.
While the major powers have
turned our planet into a ticking
time-bomb through the
production and deployment of
tens of thousands of nuclear
weapons, many of which are
hundreds of times more powerful
than the Hiroshima bomb, they
have also turned it into a virtual
arsenal of conventional arms
beyond anything conceivable even
30 years ago.
Last Year's Sales
Last year U.S. arms sales were
$5 billion, which is more than the
entire world spent on defense in
the early 19305. This year sales
will exceed $8 billion, with most
of the weapons going to Third
World countries. In this respect it
should be noted that over 90
percent of the war waged since
World War II have been waged in
the underdeveloped areas of the
world and all with imported
weapons.
Vietnam is an example of the
effect of imported weapons. Of
course during direct U.S.
intervention an incredible supply
of weapons was brought into the
country. The bombing alone is
staggering: from 1965 through
1972, the U.S. dropped over seven
million tons, which is 3.5 times
the total bomb tonnage dropped
in World War II and almost 12
times the Korean war total.
However, when direct U.S.
military intervention stopped, the
massive supply of weapons
continued. In the first eight
months after the cease-fire, the
• U.S. sent 86,000 bombs and
180,000 tons of other munitions
to South Vietnam. Consequently,
the war continues its brutal
course. In the first year of the
cease-fire more than 50,000
combat deaths were recorded and
an estimated 15,000 civilians
killed. This is the Nixon-Kissinger
"peace with honor."
Both in the nuclear and
conventional field, the arms race
will continue until either an
ultimate global disaster, or until
the citizenry gathers enough
courage and conviction to demand
an end to this insanity and a
change of direction. Perhaps the
figure 700 million best represents
the pathetic priorities and policies
now current. This is the number
of people U.N. experts now
estimate suffer severe
malnutrition.
It is also the figure in dollars
that the world spends every day
on military programs.

had been planned.
This means our nation will go -?
ahead with the program to
increase the present 7100 nuclear
weapons actually targeted, to the
10,000 range as agreed in the
SALT I Conference. Similar
increases tire, of course, allowed
the USSR.
In the real world, such
numbers are basically meaningless
as they have long exceeded the
overkill region. Most arms experts
estimate that no more than
400-500 nuclear weapons could
be used before total destruction,
With many top experts giving a
much lower figure.
Obsolescence Continues
Yet by allowing current
. astronomical overkill forces to
continue and even expand, the
agreement guarantees the arms
industry will maintain its huge
volume of business through the
well established pattern of
weapon obsolescence and
replacement.
As an example, the recent
19 74 Electronic Industries
Association meeting predicted a
Pentagon budget of $lO6 billion
by 1980, agreeing closely with the
$llO billion estimate by the
Brookings Institute. In a recent
news conference, Ford confirmed
these predictions by assuring all
Ame r i cans that the Defense
Department budget will continue
to rise over the coming years.
While the major powers have
turned our planet into a ticking
time-bomb through the
production and deployment of
tens of thousands of nuclear
weapons, many of which are
hundreds of times more powerful
than the Hiroshima bomb, they
have also turned it into a virtual
arsenal of conventional arms
beyond anything conceivable even
30 years ago.
Last Year's Sales
Last year U.S. arms sales were
$5 billion, which is more than the
entire world spent on defense in
the early 19305. This year sales
will exceed $8 billion, with most
of the weapons going to Third
World countries. In this respect it
should be noted that over 90
percent of the war waged since
World War II have been waged in
the underdeveloped areas of the
world and all with imported
weapons.
Vietnam is an example of the
effect of imported weapons. Of
course during direct U.S.
intervention an incredible supply
of weapons was brought into the
country. The bombing alone is
staggering: from 1965 through
1972, the U.S. dropped over seven
million tons, which is 3.5 times
the total bomb tonnage dropped
in World War II and almost 12
times the Korean war total.
However, when direct U.S.
military intervention stopped, the
massive supply of weapons
continued. In the first eight
months after the cease-fire, the
• U.S. sent 86,000 bombs and
180,000 tons of other munitions
to South Vietnam. Consequently,
the war continues its brutal
course. In the first year of the
cease-fire more than 50,000
combat deaths were recorded and
an estimated 15,000 civilians
killed. This is the Nixon-Kissinger
"peace with honor."
Both in the nuclear and
conventional field, the arms race
will continue until either an
ultimate global disaster, or until
the citizenry gathers enough
courage and conviction to demand
an end to this insanity and a
change of direction. Perhaps the
figure 700 million best represents
the pathetic priorities and policies
now current. This is the number
of people U.N. experts now
estimate suffer severe
malnutrition.
It is also the figure in dollars
that the world spends every day
on military programs.
