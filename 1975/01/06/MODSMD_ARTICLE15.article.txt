## Basement Darkroom Houses A Class Students Want To Take Photographer Leo Holub: A Gentle Genius 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
You leafed through the Time
Schedule until the pages were
•'frayed. You knew what you had
to take. The problem was
choosing the class you wanted to
take the class you could still go
to and enjoy when everything else
seemed hopeless.
You kept looking at the basic
photography course, trying to
decide whether you could ever
figure out what those little
numbers and gadgets on your
camera meant. _
Your hazy image of
photography included tripods,
endless adjusting of knobs and
* doo-dads, rushing around with a
L light meter, and generally
L mastering a very complicated
process.
You checked to see where to
sign up, and already you were
Sn lost.
Then you found out where it
was . . . the basement of the art
gallery.
On The Scene
What you saw when you
arrived at the scene depended on
. what needed to be done at that*
moment.
You may have seen Art
: Department lecturer Robert
; Parker teaching a student how to
crop a print. Perhaps you saw Leo
Holub, also a lecturer in the Art
Department, teaching a class or
$ sweeping'the floor.
Holub and Parker are the
photography department. They
teach classes, sweep floors, fix
plumbing, install equipment and
stock supplies.
Holub has been teaching
photography in the basement of
' the art gallery since September,
1969. Before then there was no
photography department, and he
taught photography in evening
sessions at student's houses for
the Senior Colloquium program.
. He also worked in the Planning
Office as a designer.
Holub's interest in
photography began when he got
his first camera for Christmas in
seventh grade and started taking
pictures with it.
Baby Pictures
His interest intensified when
his first child was born. "It was
the miost beautiful baby we'd
> seen. You know how parents are.

So I just had to take pictures," he
says.
He has been taking pictures
now for about 30 years.
"He is widely known and
respected throughout the region,"
says Dr. Lorenz Eitner, head of
the Art Department.
Two of his friends reknown
photography artists Ansel Adams
and Imogen Cunningham have
visited the Stanford darkroom.
Lean And Mean?
One of Holub's students giggles
when she recalls a statement he
made about coming out of the
woods "lean and mean" after a
backpacking trip. "He couldn't be
mean if he tried," the student
points out.
With his gray hair, mild blue
eyes, bushy mustache and gentle
voice, Holub doesn't fit the image
of the hard, tough
backwoodsman.
"He's an incredibly sensitive,
warm man," says Parker. "Our

ideas on photography are as close
to opposite as you can get in two
; people, but we both believe in the
basic techniques of photography.
I guess that's why we work so well
together."
Holub says, "My philosophy is
that since we are together for such
a short time, my students should
learn the controls and discipline
of 'straight photography' to
expose and develop film for
maximum clarity to achieve the
tonal and print quality of which
photo papers are uniquely
capable."
He smiles and says, "If we can
encourage you to see things a
little better, that's our reward,
rather than having someone that
just cranks out film."
Each quarter 150 students
learn to "see things a little better.
Not Enough Space
"From the first quarter we
have always had more student
applicants than we can
■ accommodate," says Holub.

He would like to expand the
photography department
eventually. An area the same size
as the existing department is
available in the basement. Tt just
needs to have four feet of dirt
excavated and a floor laid, Holub
explains.
Once that is accomplished,
Holub will find volunteers to help
him build, paint, plumb and set
up the shop he has already
designed.
Then he would offer a course
in the history of photography,
have a large format class, (using a
view camera), add color
photography to department
course offerings and be able to
accept all the people who want to
participate.
"I'm very happy here," he
says. "I love working with the
students; I'm just thinking about
improving our offering."
Solitary Man
When he's not working with
students, Holub takes pictures on
his own.

"Taking photographs is a
solitary occupation. I don't go out
with a preconceived notion. I go
out looking for something new,
something that I hadn't noticed
before. One day it was an abalone
shell on my back porch that had
been there for 10 years. This
particular day the light. .." he
makes a movement of his hand
and smiles.
"I just photograph things that
speak to me, and do it with all the
clarity I can get with this
particular medium." He says it
very simply, and a look at his
work reveals how humble that
statement is.
In the introduction to Stanford
Seen, a book of Holub's
photographs published by the Art
Department, Eitner comments,
"The photographs which he brings
home are not handsome
set-pieces, but they have the
virtue of intimate truth. The rare
quality of Holub's portrait of the
university is that it emphasizes the
fleeting and perishable life in it,
rather than the institutional
facade."
Parker says, "I feel fortunate
to know Leo. He's an incredible
man."

take the class you could still go
to and enjoy when everything else
seemed hopeless.
You kept looking at the basic
photography course, trying to
decide whether you could ever
figure out what those little
numbers and gadgets on your
camera meant. _
Your hazy image of
photography included tripods,
endless adjusting of knobs and

You checked to see where to

Sn lost.
Then you found out where it
was . . . the basement of the art

On The Scene
What you saw when you
arrived at the scene depended on
. what needed to be done at that*
moment.
You may have seen Art
: Department lecturer Robert
; Parker teaching a student how to
crop a print. Perhaps you saw Leo
Holub, also a lecturer in the Art
Department, teaching a class or
$ sweeping'the floor.
Holub and Parker are the
photography department. They
teach classes, sweep floors, fix
plumbing, install equipment and
stock supplies.
Holub has been teaching
photography in the basement of
' the art gallery since September,
1969. Before then there was no
photography department, and he
taught photography in evening
sessions at student's houses for
the Senior Colloquium program.
. He also worked in the Planning
Office as a designer.
Holub's interest in
photography began when he got
his first camera for Christmas in
seventh grade and started taking
pictures with it.
Baby Pictures
His interest intensified when
his first child was born. "It was
the miost beautiful baby we'd
> seen. You know how parents are.

So I just had to take pictures," he
says.
He has been taking pictures
now for about 30 years.
"He is widely known and
respected throughout the region,"
says Dr. Lorenz Eitner, head of
the Art Department.
Two of his friends reknown
photography artists Ansel Adams
and Imogen Cunningham have
visited the Stanford darkroom.
Lean And Mean?
One of Holub's students giggles
when she recalls a statement he
made about coming out of the
woods "lean and mean" after a
backpacking trip. "He couldn't be
mean if he tried," the student
points out.
With his gray hair, mild blue
eyes, bushy mustache and gentle
voice, Holub doesn't fit the image
of the hard, tough
backwoodsman.
"He's an incredibly sensitive,
warm man," says Parker. "Our

ideas on photography are as close
to opposite as you can get in two
; people, but we both believe in the
basic techniques of photography.
I guess that's why we work so well
together."
Holub says, "My philosophy is
that since we are together for such
a short time, my students should
learn the controls and discipline
of 'straight photography' to
expose and develop film for
maximum clarity to achieve the
tonal and print quality of which
photo papers are uniquely
capable."
He smiles and says, "If we can
encourage you to see things a
little better, that's our reward,
rather than having someone that
just cranks out film."
Each quarter 150 students
learn to "see things a little better.
Not Enough Space
"From the first quarter we
have always had more student
applicants than we can
■ accommodate," says Holub.

He would like to expand the
photography department
eventually. An area the same size
as the existing department is
available in the basement. Tt just
needs to have four feet of dirt
excavated and a floor laid, Holub
explains.
Once that is accomplished,
Holub will find volunteers to help
him build, paint, plumb and set
up the shop he has already
designed.
Then he would offer a course
in the history of photography,
have a large format class, (using a
view camera), add color
photography to department
course offerings and be able to
accept all the people who want to
participate.
"I'm very happy here," he
says. "I love working with the
students; I'm just thinking about
improving our offering."
Solitary Man
When he's not working with
students, Holub takes pictures on
his own.

"Taking photographs is a
solitary occupation. I don't go out
with a preconceived notion. I go
out looking for something new,
something that I hadn't noticed
before. One day it was an abalone
shell on my back porch that had
been there for 10 years. This
particular day the light. .." he
makes a movement of his hand
and smiles.
"I just photograph things that
speak to me, and do it with all the
clarity I can get with this
particular medium." He says it
very simply, and a look at his
work reveals how humble that
statement is.
In the introduction to Stanford
Seen, a book of Holub's
photographs published by the Art
Department, Eitner comments,
"The photographs which he brings
home are not handsome
set-pieces, but they have the
virtue of intimate truth. The rare
quality of Holub's portrait of the
university is that it emphasizes the
fleeting and perishable life in it,
rather than the institutional
facade."
Parker says, "I feel fortunate
to know Leo. He's an incredible
man."

Your hazy image of
photography included tripods,
endless adjusting of knobs and
* doo-dads, rushing around with a
L light meter, and generally
L mastering a very complicated
process.
You checked to see where to
sign up, and already you were
Sn lost.
Then you found out where it
was . . . the basement of the art
gallery.
On The Scene
What you saw when you
arrived at the scene depended on
. what needed to be done at that*
moment.
You may have seen Art
: Department lecturer Robert
; Parker teaching a student how to
crop a print. Perhaps you saw Leo
Holub, also a lecturer in the Art
Department, teaching a class or
$ sweeping'the floor.
Holub and Parker are the
photography department. They
teach classes, sweep floors, fix
plumbing, install equipment and
stock supplies.
Holub has been teaching
photography in the basement of
' the art gallery since September,
1969. Before then there was no
photography department, and he
taught photography in evening
sessions at student's houses for
the Senior Colloquium program.
. He also worked in the Planning
Office as a designer.
Holub's interest in
photography began when he got
his first camera for Christmas in
seventh grade and started taking
pictures with it.
Baby Pictures
His interest intensified when
his first child was born. "It was
the miost beautiful baby we'd
> seen. You know how parents are.

So I just had to take pictures," he
says.
He has been taking pictures
now for about 30 years.
"He is widely known and
respected throughout the region,"
says Dr. Lorenz Eitner, head of
the Art Department.
Two of his friends reknown
photography artists Ansel Adams
and Imogen Cunningham have
visited the Stanford darkroom.
Lean And Mean?
One of Holub's students giggles
when she recalls a statement he
made about coming out of the
woods "lean and mean" after a
backpacking trip. "He couldn't be
mean if he tried," the student
points out.
With his gray hair, mild blue
eyes, bushy mustache and gentle
voice, Holub doesn't fit the image
of the hard, tough
backwoodsman.
"He's an incredibly sensitive,
warm man," says Parker. "Our

ideas on photography are as close
to opposite as you can get in two
; people, but we both believe in the
basic techniques of photography.
I guess that's why we work so well
together."
Holub says, "My philosophy is
that since we are together for such
a short time, my students should
learn the controls and discipline
of 'straight photography' to
expose and develop film for
maximum clarity to achieve the
tonal and print quality of which
photo papers are uniquely
capable."
He smiles and says, "If we can
encourage you to see things a
little better, that's our reward,
rather than having someone that
just cranks out film."
Each quarter 150 students
learn to "see things a little better.
Not Enough Space
"From the first quarter we
have always had more student
applicants than we can
■ accommodate," says Holub.

He would like to expand the
photography department
eventually. An area the same size
as the existing department is
available in the basement. Tt just
needs to have four feet of dirt
excavated and a floor laid, Holub
explains.
Once that is accomplished,
Holub will find volunteers to help
him build, paint, plumb and set
up the shop he has already
designed.
Then he would offer a course
in the history of photography,
have a large format class, (using a
view camera), add color
photography to department
course offerings and be able to
accept all the people who want to
participate.
"I'm very happy here," he
says. "I love working with the
students; I'm just thinking about
improving our offering."
Solitary Man
When he's not working with
students, Holub takes pictures on
his own.

"Taking photographs is a
solitary occupation. I don't go out
with a preconceived notion. I go
out looking for something new,
something that I hadn't noticed
before. One day it was an abalone
shell on my back porch that had
been there for 10 years. This
particular day the light. .." he
makes a movement of his hand
and smiles.
"I just photograph things that
speak to me, and do it with all the
clarity I can get with this
particular medium." He says it
very simply, and a look at his
work reveals how humble that
statement is.
In the introduction to Stanford
Seen, a book of Holub's
photographs published by the Art
Department, Eitner comments,
"The photographs which he brings
home are not handsome
set-pieces, but they have the
virtue of intimate truth. The rare
quality of Holub's portrait of the
university is that it emphasizes the
fleeting and perishable life in it,
rather than the institutional
facade."
Parker says, "I feel fortunate
to know Leo. He's an incredible
man."
