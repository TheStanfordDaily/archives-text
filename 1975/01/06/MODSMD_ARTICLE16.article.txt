# Fireman Weds Policewoman; Firetrucks Rush To Mem Chu
## 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
You would have thought there was a terrible fire
inside Memorial Church Dec. 7 when practically
every member of the Campus Fire Department was
on hand.
But why did they all start laughing when two
huge fire engines and a rescue truck stopped in
front of the church at 11:29 a.m. with a screeching
halt?
The only blazes in the church on that crisp clear
Saturday morning were the ones in the hearts of
Stanford Fireman Nick Marinaro and his bride
Debbie Whittemore.
But the groom did a double take when he saw
the heavy oak doors of the church part for his
bride, standing there in a gown that clung softly to
her hips. He couldn't take his eyes off her as she
marched, one step at a time, down that long central
aisle.
Maybe he looked twice to see if the girl in the
sumptuous white satin, dress was really his Debbie
the one usually seen with guns around her waist
his Debbie the campus police officer.

Other than the fire trucks parked at the church
door, it was a fairly traditional Christmas-time
wedding .. . considering.
Poinsettias adorned the altar. The six
bridesmaids wore blue velvet and carried bouquets
of red roses and red satin ribbon and the bride's
mother beamed over the happy couple.
Asked how it feels to be married to a female
police officer, Marinaro said, "It feels good. But it
feels good to be married to anyone."
How does a campus fireman happen to meet and
marry a campus police officer?
"They met oyer an accident," a friend explained
with delight. "Debbie was the police officer and
Nick was with the rescue squad."
Neither of the two was kidded by other
members of their departments after they began
dating.
"I think that everybody who came in contact
with them had the greatest respect for them," said
campus Police Sergeant Thomas Berubee. "They're
both outstanding individuals and they make a
beautiful couple."
