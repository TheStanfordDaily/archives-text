Former Law School Lecturer
Named To Brown's Cabinet
Gov.-elect Edmund G. Brown
Jr. last week named Rose
Elizabeth Bird, a former Law
School lecturer here, to his
cabinet.
As secretary of the Agriculture
and Services Agency, Bird is
perhaps the first woman to hold a
cabinet post in the history of the
state, Brown aides said.
Bird taught criminal defense
and consumer protection at the
Law School for three years. While
serving as a part-time faculty
member, Bird worked in the Santa
Clara County public defender's
office as senior trial deputy. She
has also worked for the chief
justice of the Nevada Supreme
Court.
She left the University last year
to work full-tipie in the Brown
campaign, and later served on
Brown's transition, staff.
Bird has refused to answer
questions about her qualifications
for an agriculture-related post.
She has referred reporters to
Brown's press office.
"I don't believe she's been an
agricultural specialist," said
Associate Law Prof. Michael Wald.
Wald, who worked closely with
Bird while she lectured at
Stanford, called her "extremely
capable, intelligent and able to
handle any post."
He believes Bird has the
organizational ability to run a
state agency and put together a
top-notch staff. "And I assume
that Brown will use his six cabinet
members as general advisors,"
Wald added.
David Scheming, who holds a
Ph.D. in soil chemistry, will assist
Bird as deputy secretary of the
agency. Schuering said he owns a
750-acre farm in Illinois with his
father.
Scheming and Bird are 38. The
average age of 36-year-old
Brown's appointees so far is 37.
While campaigning, Brown had
promised that women and
minorities would receive
important posts in his
administration.
Hospital Expansion Planned
The Stanford Hospital will
undergo an additional $lO to $l5
million worth of construction,
according to an outline Planning
Office Director Harry Sanders
sent to Palo Alto officials
recently.
The construction is the second
stage of an expansion plan that
was originally slated for $12.6
million.
Under the plan, most of the
phase II money will be used to
phase I construction.
However, about 25,000 to 45,000
square feet will be added to the
first phase I building at a location
yet to be determined, Sanders
said.
The expansion will allow for
three to five additional operating
rooms and space for 20 to 40 new
hospital beds.
A combination of private funds
and federal Hill-Burton hospital
construction funds will be used to
finance the expansion, Sanders
elaborated.
He said the project is
"considerably scaled down from
what's been discussed in the past
and what we really feel we need.
"The economic climate we find
ourselves in, however, just doesn't
make it feasible for us to attempt
more at this time," he said. "Even
the concept we're now
considering will require significant
gifts to allow us to initiate
construction."
Rhodes Scholars Named
Two students here were named
last month as recipients of
prestigious Rhodes Scholarships
for study at Oxford University in
England.
Craig H. Seligman, a senior
I English major, and Scott
Matheson, a graduate student in
| economics, were named, for
two-year scholarships.

Established in 1902 by the will
of British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes, the awards are given to
scholars from 17 countries,
including former British colonies,
Germany and the United States.
Rhodes Scholars receive a
stipend of $4700 a year and are
free to select any field of study
offered at Oxford. They must pass
several comprehensive
examinations and personal
interviews to be considered for
the scholarship.
Faculty Protest Anti-Israel
Resolution
More than 70 University
faculty members and
administrators, including
President Richard Lyman,
associated themselves with a
protest of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
confirmation of an anti-Israel
resolution previously adopted by
one of its Commissions.
The UNESCO Commission for
Social Sciences, Humanities and
Culture last month voted to
withhold all assistance from Israel,
and approved a further resolution
denying Israel the right to
participate in any of the regions
into which UNESCO has divided
its operations.
When the first of these
resolutions was adopted, it
prompted protest of a number of
leading French intellectuals who
said they would refuse to
collaborate in UNESCO so long as
it did not prove "its faithfulness
to its own goals."
The Stanford affiliates
associating themselves with the
statement included Nobel
Laureates Felix Bloch, Paul J.
Flory, Robert Hofstadter, Athur
Kornberg and Joshua Lederberg.
Fire At Synergy
Fire destroyed a storage shed
at the rear of Synergy House
shortly before midnight Dec. 29,
the Stanford fire department
reported.
The shed, a four-car garage

behind the former fraternity,
contained stored furnishings and
members' personal belongings of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Fire Chief Frank Jurian
estimated damage at $4OOO to
$5OOO, including a small foreign
car stored there during the
vacation.
Santa Clara County
investigators are still checking into
the possibility that the fire was
arson, according to a fire
department spokesman.
The shed and contents were
totally in flames by the time five
engines and 20 men arrived. It
spread to six nearby trees and at
first threatened Delta Tau Delta
fraternity, before firemen were
able to contain the blaze.
Leland Named ARLO
Co-Director
William L. Leland, former
associate dean of students here,
has been appointed co-director of
the Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) by the Office's
faculty-student advisory board.
Leland, who left the University
in 1972 to pursue private
interests, replaces Susan Deborah,
who resigned to take a position
elsewhere. Leland is a co-founder
of The Bridge, the
student-operated counseling
center, and was a draft counselor
among his other duties here.
Leland will work with ARLO
co-director Edith Eddy in
community service, providing
student research personnel and
volunteers in a wide variety of
activities where this help can be
useful.
Report On Foreign Students
Foreign students here have
become much more dependent on
their own personal resources to
provide financial support for their
education during the past year,
according to a new report from
the Bechtel International Center.
The proportion reporting
personal resources as their prime

support this fall was 41 percent
compared to only 28 percent a
year ago. Support in the form of
University teaching assistantships,
fellowships, foundation grants,
international agencies, the U.S.
government and foreign
employers all declined in
importance.
Foreign government support
rose slightly, from nine to 12
percent.
Overall, the University has
1251 foreign students this fall,
almost exactly one-tenth of its
total enrollment. Of these 897
were graduate students, 165
terminal graduate students, 151
undergraduates and 38
nonmatriculated students or on
attendance permits.
Asia was the most frequent
region of geographic origin, with
464 students. Next were the
Americas, 323; Europe, 268; the
Middle East and North Africa,
134; Africa, 41; and the Pacific
Basin, 18.
Hong Kong was the largest
national source, with 110,
followed by Taiwan, 93; Japan,
79; France, 74; Mexico, 73;
Canada, 67; Brazil, 66; and India,
60. '
The current total of 1251
compares with 1270 a year ago
and 1307 in 1972-73, the peak
year.
Classics Prof Honored
Classics Prof Antony E.
Raubitschek, 63, nationally
known classical scholar has been
appointed to the endowed Sadie
Dernham Patek professor of
humanities here, effective
immediately.
His selection was announced
last week by President Richard W.
Lyman.
An expert in Greek
inscriptions, Raubitschek is
known as a teacher of boundless
enthusiasm, often teaching 10 or
12 courses a year. Students
enrolled in his Greek course last
year unanimously rated his
speaking ability, enthusiasm and
organization as "excellent."

Report On Foreign Students
Foreign students here have
become much more dependent on
their own personal resources to
provide financial support for their
education during the past year,
according to a new report from
the Bechtel International Center.
The proportion reporting
personal resources as their prime

support this fall was 41 percent
compared to only 28 percent a
year ago. Support in the form of
University teaching assistantships,
fellowships, foundation grants,
international agencies, the U.S.
government and foreign
employers all declined in
importance.
Foreign government support
rose slightly, from nine to 12
percent.
Overall, the University has
1251 foreign students this fall,
almost exactly one-tenth of its
total enrollment. Of these 897
were graduate students, 165
terminal graduate students, 151
undergraduates and 38
nonmatriculated students or on
attendance permits.
Asia was the most frequent
region of geographic origin, with
464 students. Next were the
Americas, 323; Europe, 268; the
Middle East and North Africa,
134; Africa, 41; and the Pacific
Basin, 18.
Hong Kong was the largest
national source, with 110,
followed by Taiwan, 93; Japan,
79; France, 74; Mexico, 73;
Canada, 67; Brazil, 66; and India,
60. '
The current total of 1251
compares with 1270 a year ago
and 1307 in 1972-73, the peak
year.
Classics Prof Honored
Classics Prof Antony E.
Raubitschek, 63, nationally
known classical scholar has been
appointed to the endowed Sadie
Dernham Patek professor of
humanities here, effective
immediately.
His selection was announced
last week by President Richard W.
Lyman.
An expert in Greek
inscriptions, Raubitschek is
known as a teacher of boundless
enthusiasm, often teaching 10 or
12 courses a year. Students
enrolled in his Greek course last
year unanimously rated his
speaking ability, enthusiasm and
organization as "excellent."
Former Law School Lecturer
Named To Brown's Cabinet
Gov.-elect Edmund G. Brown
Jr. last week named Rose
Elizabeth Bird, a former Law
School lecturer here, to his
cabinet.
As secretary of the Agriculture
and Services Agency, Bird is
perhaps the first woman to hold a
cabinet post in the history of the
state, Brown aides said.
Bird taught criminal defense
and consumer protection at the
Law School for three years. While
serving as a part-time faculty
member, Bird worked in the Santa
Clara County public defender's
office as senior trial deputy. She
has also worked for the chief
justice of the Nevada Supreme
Court.
She left the University last year
to work full-tipie in the Brown
campaign, and later served on
Brown's transition, staff.
Bird has refused to answer
questions about her qualifications
for an agriculture-related post.
She has referred reporters to
Brown's press office.
"I don't believe she's been an
agricultural specialist," said
Associate Law Prof. Michael Wald.
Wald, who worked closely with
Bird while she lectured at
Stanford, called her "extremely
capable, intelligent and able to
handle any post."
He believes Bird has the
organizational ability to run a
state agency and put together a
top-notch staff. "And I assume
that Brown will use his six cabinet
members as general advisors,"
Wald added.
David Scheming, who holds a
Ph.D. in soil chemistry, will assist
Bird as deputy secretary of the
agency. Schuering said he owns a
750-acre farm in Illinois with his
father.
Scheming and Bird are 38. The
average age of 36-year-old
Brown's appointees so far is 37.
While campaigning, Brown had
promised that women and
minorities would receive
important posts in his
administration.
Hospital Expansion Planned
The Stanford Hospital will
undergo an additional $lO to $l5
million worth of construction,
according to an outline Planning
Office Director Harry Sanders
sent to Palo Alto officials
recently.
The construction is the second
stage of an expansion plan that
was originally slated for $12.6
million.
Under the plan, most of the
phase II money will be used to
phase I construction.
However, about 25,000 to 45,000
square feet will be added to the
first phase I building at a location
yet to be determined, Sanders
said.
The expansion will allow for
three to five additional operating
rooms and space for 20 to 40 new
hospital beds.
A combination of private funds
and federal Hill-Burton hospital
construction funds will be used to
finance the expansion, Sanders
elaborated.
He said the project is
"considerably scaled down from
what's been discussed in the past
and what we really feel we need.
"The economic climate we find
ourselves in, however, just doesn't
make it feasible for us to attempt
more at this time," he said. "Even
the concept we're now
considering will require significant
gifts to allow us to initiate
construction."
Rhodes Scholars Named
Two students here were named
last month as recipients of
prestigious Rhodes Scholarships
for study at Oxford University in
England.
Craig H. Seligman, a senior
I English major, and Scott
Matheson, a graduate student in
| economics, were named, for
two-year scholarships.

Established in 1902 by the will
of British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes, the awards are given to
scholars from 17 countries,
including former British colonies,
Germany and the United States.
Rhodes Scholars receive a
stipend of $4700 a year and are
free to select any field of study
offered at Oxford. They must pass
several comprehensive
examinations and personal
interviews to be considered for
the scholarship.
Faculty Protest Anti-Israel
Resolution
More than 70 University
faculty members and
administrators, including
President Richard Lyman,
associated themselves with a
protest of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
confirmation of an anti-Israel
resolution previously adopted by
one of its Commissions.
The UNESCO Commission for
Social Sciences, Humanities and
Culture last month voted to
withhold all assistance from Israel,
and approved a further resolution
denying Israel the right to
participate in any of the regions
into which UNESCO has divided
its operations.
When the first of these
resolutions was adopted, it
prompted protest of a number of
leading French intellectuals who
said they would refuse to
collaborate in UNESCO so long as
it did not prove "its faithfulness
to its own goals."
The Stanford affiliates
associating themselves with the
statement included Nobel
Laureates Felix Bloch, Paul J.
Flory, Robert Hofstadter, Athur
Kornberg and Joshua Lederberg.
Fire At Synergy
Fire destroyed a storage shed
at the rear of Synergy House
shortly before midnight Dec. 29,
the Stanford fire department
reported.
The shed, a four-car garage

behind the former fraternity,
contained stored furnishings and
members' personal belongings of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Fire Chief Frank Jurian
estimated damage at $4OOO to
$5OOO, including a small foreign
car stored there during the
vacation.
Santa Clara County
investigators are still checking into
the possibility that the fire was
arson, according to a fire
department spokesman.
The shed and contents were
totally in flames by the time five
engines and 20 men arrived. It
spread to six nearby trees and at
first threatened Delta Tau Delta
fraternity, before firemen were
able to contain the blaze.

Faculty Protest Anti-Israel
Resolution
More than 70 University
faculty members and
administrators, including
President Richard Lyman,
associated themselves with a
protest of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
confirmation of an anti-Israel
resolution previously adopted by
one of its Commissions.
The UNESCO Commission for
Social Sciences, Humanities and

the Stanford fire department
reported.
The shed, a four-car garage

behind the former fraternity,
contained stored furnishings and
members' personal belongings of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Fire Chief Frank Jurian
estimated damage at $4OOO to
$5OOO, including a small foreign
car stored there during the
vacation.
Santa Clara County
investigators are still checking into
the possibility that the fire was
arson, according to a fire
department spokesman.
The shed and contents were
totally in flames by the time five
engines and 20 men arrived. It
spread to six nearby trees and at
first threatened Delta Tau Delta
fraternity, before firemen were
able to contain the blaze.
Leland Named ARLO
Co-Director
William L. Leland, former
associate dean of students here,
has been appointed co-director of
the Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) by the Office's
faculty-student advisory board.
Leland, who left the University
in 1972 to pursue private
interests, replaces Susan Deborah,
who resigned to take a position
elsewhere. Leland is a co-founder
of The Bridge, the
student-operated counseling
center, and was a draft counselor
among his other duties here.
Leland will work with ARLO
co-director Edith Eddy in
community service, providing
student research personnel and
volunteers in a wide variety of
activities where this help can be
useful.
Report On Foreign Students
Foreign students here have
become much more dependent on
their own personal resources to
provide financial support for their
education during the past year,
according to a new report from
the Bechtel International Center.
The proportion reporting
personal resources as their prime

support this fall was 41 percent
compared to only 28 percent a
year ago. Support in the form of
University teaching assistantships,
fellowships, foundation grants,
international agencies, the U.S.
government and foreign
employers all declined in
importance.
Foreign government support
rose slightly, from nine to 12
percent.
Overall, the University has
1251 foreign students this fall,
almost exactly one-tenth of its
total enrollment. Of these 897
were graduate students, 165
terminal graduate students, 151
undergraduates and 38
nonmatriculated students or on
attendance permits.
Asia was the most frequent
region of geographic origin, with
464 students. Next were the
Americas, 323; Europe, 268; the
Middle East and North Africa,
134; Africa, 41; and the Pacific
Basin, 18.
Hong Kong was the largest
national source, with 110,
followed by Taiwan, 93; Japan,
79; France, 74; Mexico, 73;
Canada, 67; Brazil, 66; and India,
60. '
The current total of 1251
compares with 1270 a year ago
and 1307 in 1972-73, the peak
year.
Classics Prof Honored
Classics Prof Antony E.
Raubitschek, 63, nationally
known classical scholar has been
appointed to the endowed Sadie
Dernham Patek professor of
humanities here, effective
immediately.
His selection was announced
last week by President Richard W.
Lyman.
An expert in Greek
inscriptions, Raubitschek is
known as a teacher of boundless
enthusiasm, often teaching 10 or
12 courses a year. Students
enrolled in his Greek course last
year unanimously rated his
speaking ability, enthusiasm and
organization as "excellent."
Former Law School Lecturer
Named To Brown's Cabinet
Gov.-elect Edmund G. Brown
Jr. last week named Rose
Elizabeth Bird, a former Law
School lecturer here, to his
cabinet.
As secretary of the Agriculture
and Services Agency, Bird is
perhaps the first woman to hold a
cabinet post in the history of the
state, Brown aides said.
Bird taught criminal defense
and consumer protection at the
Law School for three years. While
serving as a part-time faculty
member, Bird worked in the Santa
Clara County public defender's
office as senior trial deputy. She
has also worked for the chief
justice of the Nevada Supreme
Court.
She left the University last year
to work full-tipie in the Brown
campaign, and later served on
Brown's transition, staff.
Bird has refused to answer
questions about her qualifications
for an agriculture-related post.
She has referred reporters to
Brown's press office.
"I don't believe she's been an
agricultural specialist," said
Associate Law Prof. Michael Wald.
Wald, who worked closely with
Bird while she lectured at
Stanford, called her "extremely
capable, intelligent and able to
handle any post."
He believes Bird has the
organizational ability to run a
state agency and put together a
top-notch staff. "And I assume
that Brown will use his six cabinet
members as general advisors,"
Wald added.
David Scheming, who holds a
Ph.D. in soil chemistry, will assist
Bird as deputy secretary of the
agency. Schuering said he owns a
750-acre farm in Illinois with his
father.
Scheming and Bird are 38. The
average age of 36-year-old
Brown's appointees so far is 37.
While campaigning, Brown had
promised that women and
minorities would receive
important posts in his
administration.
Hospital Expansion Planned
The Stanford Hospital will
undergo an additional $lO to $l5
million worth of construction,
according to an outline Planning
Office Director Harry Sanders
sent to Palo Alto officials
recently.
The construction is the second
stage of an expansion plan that
was originally slated for $12.6
million.
Under the plan, most of the
phase II money will be used to
phase I construction.
However, about 25,000 to 45,000
square feet will be added to the
first phase I building at a location
yet to be determined, Sanders
said.
The expansion will allow for
three to five additional operating
rooms and space for 20 to 40 new
hospital beds.
A combination of private funds
and federal Hill-Burton hospital
construction funds will be used to
finance the expansion, Sanders
elaborated.
He said the project is
"considerably scaled down from
what's been discussed in the past
and what we really feel we need.
"The economic climate we find
ourselves in, however, just doesn't
make it feasible for us to attempt
more at this time," he said. "Even
the concept we're now
considering will require significant
gifts to allow us to initiate
construction."
Rhodes Scholars Named
Two students here were named
last month as recipients of
prestigious Rhodes Scholarships
for study at Oxford University in
England.

to work full-tipie in the Brown
campaign, and later served on
Brown's transition, staff.
Bird has refused to answer
questions about her qualifications
for an agriculture-related post.
She has referred reporters to
Brown's press office.
"I don't believe she's been an
agricultural specialist," said
Associate Law Prof. Michael Wald.
Wald, who worked closely with
Bird while she lectured at
Stanford, called her "extremely
capable, intelligent and able to
handle any post."
He believes Bird has the
organizational ability to run a
state agency and put together a
top-notch staff. "And I assume
that Brown will use his six cabinet
members as general advisors,"
Wald added.
David Scheming, who holds a
Ph.D. in soil chemistry, will assist
Bird as deputy secretary of the
agency. Schuering said he owns a
750-acre farm in Illinois with his
father.
Scheming and Bird are 38. The
average age of 36-year-old
Brown's appointees so far is 37.
While campaigning, Brown had
promised that women and
minorities would receive
important posts in his
administration.
Hospital Expansion Planned
The Stanford Hospital will
undergo an additional $lO to $l5
million worth of construction,
according to an outline Planning
Office Director Harry Sanders
sent to Palo Alto officials
recently.
The construction is the second
stage of an expansion plan that
was originally slated for $12.6
million.
Under the plan, most of the
phase II money will be used to
phase I construction.
However, about 25,000 to 45,000
square feet will be added to the
first phase I building at a location
yet to be determined, Sanders
said.
The expansion will allow for
three to five additional operating
rooms and space for 20 to 40 new
hospital beds.
A combination of private funds
and federal Hill-Burton hospital
construction funds will be used to
finance the expansion, Sanders
elaborated.
He said the project is
"considerably scaled down from
what's been discussed in the past
and what we really feel we need.
"The economic climate we find
ourselves in, however, just doesn't
make it feasible for us to attempt
more at this time," he said. "Even
the concept we're now
considering will require significant
gifts to allow us to initiate
construction."
Rhodes Scholars Named
Two students here were named
last month as recipients of
prestigious Rhodes Scholarships
for study at Oxford University in
England.
Craig H. Seligman, a senior
I English major, and Scott
Matheson, a graduate student in
| economics, were named, for
two-year scholarships.

Established in 1902 by the will
of British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes, the awards are given to
scholars from 17 countries,
including former British colonies,
Germany and the United States.
Rhodes Scholars receive a
stipend of $4700 a year and are
free to select any field of study
offered at Oxford. They must pass
several comprehensive
examinations and personal
interviews to be considered for
the scholarship.
Faculty Protest Anti-Israel
Resolution
More than 70 University
faculty members and
administrators, including
President Richard Lyman,
associated themselves with a
protest of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
confirmation of an anti-Israel
resolution previously adopted by
one of its Commissions.
The UNESCO Commission for
Social Sciences, Humanities and
Culture last month voted to
withhold all assistance from Israel,
and approved a further resolution
denying Israel the right to
participate in any of the regions
into which UNESCO has divided
its operations.
When the first of these
resolutions was adopted, it
prompted protest of a number of
leading French intellectuals who
said they would refuse to
collaborate in UNESCO so long as
it did not prove "its faithfulness
to its own goals."
The Stanford affiliates
associating themselves with the
statement included Nobel
Laureates Felix Bloch, Paul J.
Flory, Robert Hofstadter, Athur
Kornberg and Joshua Lederberg.
Fire At Synergy
Fire destroyed a storage shed
at the rear of Synergy House
shortly before midnight Dec. 29,
the Stanford fire department
reported.
The shed, a four-car garage

behind the former fraternity,
contained stored furnishings and
members' personal belongings of
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.
Fire Chief Frank Jurian
estimated damage at $4OOO to
$5OOO, including a small foreign
car stored there during the
vacation.
Santa Clara County
investigators are still checking into
the possibility that the fire was
arson, according to a fire
department spokesman.
The shed and contents were
totally in flames by the time five
engines and 20 men arrived. It
spread to six nearby trees and at
first threatened Delta Tau Delta
fraternity, before firemen were
able to contain the blaze.
Leland Named ARLO
Co-Director
William L. Leland, former
associate dean of students here,
has been appointed co-director of
the Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) by the Office's

Leland will work with ARLO
co-director Edith Eddy in
community service, providing
student research personnel and
volunteers in a wide variety of
activities where this help can be
useful.
Report On Foreign Students
Foreign students here have
become much more dependent on
their own personal resources to
provide financial support for their
education during the past year,
according to a new report from
the Bechtel International Center.
The proportion reporting
personal resources as their prime

support this fall was 41 percent
compared to only 28 percent a
year ago. Support in the form of
University teaching assistantships,
fellowships, foundation grants,
international agencies, the U.S.
government and foreign
employers all declined in
importance.
Foreign government support
rose slightly, from nine to 12
percent.
Overall, the University has
1251 foreign students this fall,
almost exactly one-tenth of its
total enrollment. Of these 897
were graduate students, 165
terminal graduate students, 151
undergraduates and 38
nonmatriculated students or on
attendance permits.
Asia was the most frequent
region of geographic origin, with
464 students. Next were the
Americas, 323; Europe, 268; the
Middle East and North Africa,
134; Africa, 41; and the Pacific
Basin, 18.
Hong Kong was the largest
national source, with 110,
followed by Taiwan, 93; Japan,
79; France, 74; Mexico, 73;
Canada, 67; Brazil, 66; and India,

Former Law School Lecturer
Named To Brown's Cabinet
Gov.-elect Edmund G. Brown
Jr. last week named Rose
Elizabeth Bird, a former Law
School lecturer here, to his
cabinet.
As secretary of the Agriculture
and Services Agency, Bird is
perhaps the first woman to hold a
cabinet post in the history of the
state, Brown aides said.
Bird taught criminal defense
and consumer protection at the
Law School for three years. While
serving as a part-time faculty
member, Bird worked in the Santa
Clara County public defender's

Bird has refused to answer
questions about her qualifications
for an agriculture-related post.
She has referred reporters to
