# Escondido Residents * Boycott Parking Fees
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
A group of Escondido Village
residents have urged student car
owners who live in University
residences not to purchase a $7.50
sticker required by the University for
parking on campus for the rest of the
academic year.
In a flyer pirculated yesterday, the
Escondido Village Council also
encouraged students to refuse to pay
any citation issued by the Department
of Police Services to cars which do not
display decals after the Jan. 20
deadline.
Marvin Herrington, director of
Police Services, announced early last
fhonth that the auto registration fee,
which had not been required last fall,
would be reinstated at least until the
University acts on the
recommendations of a parking study
by Asst. Vice President for Medical
Affairs Peter Carpenter.
> Carpenter says the study is in the
fact-finding stage and should be ready
in February. He estimates that about
50 percent of students on campus own
cars.
Privilege
Faculty and staff members must
also obtain a sticker for their cars, but
will receive it for free.
Kathy Colson, president of the
Escondido Council, opposes the fee
because "we already pay for
maintenance and police enforcement
of the residence lots through our rent.
With a parking fee we'd be paying
twice for the same service."
"The $7.50 will go to maintenance
and police work for parking areas
around the academic buildings" where
only faculty and staff are permitted to
park, Colson said. "We're paying for
the staff and faculty, so they'll get the
parking strictly free."
Fee Purpose
ASSU Sen. Pieter Winsemius, who
says he will bring up the issue at
tonight's senate meeting, added that
"Nobody has been able to tell me
what the fee is for. There's no service
to students who pay the fee."
Robert Augsburger, vice president
for business and finance, contended
that car owners "are paying for vehicle
registration. They're not paying for a
service."

He said that the income from the
auto registration fees is unrestricted.
"The money isn't traceable to
anything. It goes into the general fund
just like tuition dollars."
Common Benefits
Augsburger argued that paying the
cost of parking for faculty and staff
was a common benefit given to many
employees by companies. "If we made
the faculty and staff pay, we'd
probably have to raise their salaries."
Bill Henrich, a law student, said the
fee was unfair because "the University
would be running the residences for a
profit. And they have a moral
obligation to provide reasonable
parking to members of the University
just as they provide water, heat or
garbage collection."
Both Henrich and Colson
mentioned legal action as away to
prevent the University from requiring
the fee. ColsOn said she will confront
lawyers with her case today.
