## Arterberry's Absence Fatal Style-ish USF Overpowers Cards 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
SAN FRANCISCO—It doesn't
look as if Stanford can win too
many games this season without
the presence of Melvin Arterberry.
Arterberry's absence (see
inset), without much question,
cost Stanford a win Saturday
night at the University of San
Francisco. The Cardinals lost their
third straight, 87-82, to flatten
their season record at 5-5.
Stanford desperately needed
Arterberry to stop the Dons'
Tony Styles, a hot-shooting senior
guard who scored 31 points,
including 19 in the second half
which snuffed out any hopes of a
Stanford comeback. Styles is the
classic example of the type of
guard (hard driving, relatively
undisciplined) Arterberry usually
puts in his hip pocket.
Guard Mark Gilberg was able
to take up some of the slack on
defense with aggressive plays,
typified by a play where he drew
an offensive foul by letting
himself get knocked over by a
USF player charging upcourt at
full speed. But Gilberg's efforts
weren't enough to keep USF from
hitting outside shots throughout
the contest.
Kelley Shoots
The lack of perimeter defense
marred what could have l?een the
triumphant emergence of Rich
Kelley from a shooting cocoon.
Over the vacation, Kelley
became Stanford's all-time leading
rebounder and joined the
mythical 1000-point club. But

still, his reluctance to go to the
hoop has partially negated the
huge advantage his presence gives
Stanford.
During the first half, Kelley
shot only six times, sinking three.
But early in the second half,
Kelley started taking the ball to
the basket, over or around his
defenders. In all, Kelley hit 10 of
17 second half shots to finish with
a season high of 31 points, for a
two-game total of 59.
"I was very encouraged with
the way he was taking it in
tonight," an otherwise

discouraged coach Howie Dallmar '
said.
But Kelley's efforts at one end
of the floor were negated by those
of Styles, forward Marvin
Redmond (18 points) and
freshman guard Rod Williams (16)
at the other end. The latter two
players came off the bench and
sparked a first half surge which
took USF from a 29-25 deficit to
a 40-35 halftime bulge.
Forward Ed Schweitzer,
playing well against the more
muscular USF frontliners, led the
Cards in the first half with 12
points, and was especially

effective near the backboards. He
finished the game with 16
rebounds. Kelley, often fumbling
on the defensive boards, got only
seven boards during the game.
Schweitzer finished with 22
points, and that total would have
been 24 except for a freak play
which left the few Stanford fans
in the crowd of 6742 laughing.
Schweitzer got wide open under
the basket, so guard Mike Bratz
threw him a lob pass. Much to the
amazement of Bratz, the pass
went in the hoop.
Too Many Fouls
That play tied the score at
43-all, but things soon started
going downhill. Style-ish heroics
left the Cardinals suddenly down
by eight and thereafter Stanford
fouled way too much to win.
The final margin of five points
was the closest Stanford came in
the last six minutes, and virtually
every Cardinal basket was
followed by a defensive lapse that
produced a basket or free throw.
In all, the Dons hit 23 of 39
from the line, while Stanford
connected on nine of omy 17 free
throws. This edge more than
negated Stanford's surplus of five
field goals.
But another statistic tells an
equally important story. USF got
a total of 49 points from its
, guards. The Cardinals got exactly
10.
Even superior play by a team's
big men can't make up 39 points.

by eight and thereafter Stanford
fouled way too much to win.
The final margin of five points
was the closest Stanford came in
the last six minutes, and virtually
every Cardinal basket was
followed by a defensive lapse that
produced a basket or free throw.
In all, the Dons hit 23 of 39
from the line, while Stanford
connected on nine of omy 17 free
throws. This edge more than
negated Stanford's surplus of five
field goals.
But another statistic tells an
equally important story. USF got
a total of 49 points from its
, guards. The Cardinals got exactly
10.
Even superior play by a team's
big men can't make up 39 points.

KUNG FU FIGHTING? Stanford guard Mark Gilberg avoids a kick
by a n^ Ariz° na pl a yer during the Cardinals' 80-67 loss to the Wildcats
last Monday. The Cards battled both their opponents and crowds
during their trip to the Southwest.
SAN FRANCISCO—It doesn't
look as if Stanford can win too
many games this season without
the presence of Melvin Arterberry.
Arterberry's absence (see
inset), without much question,
cost Stanford a win Saturday
night at the University of San
Francisco. The Cardinals lost their
third straight, 87-82, to flatten
their season record at 5-5.
Stanford desperately needed
Arterberry to stop the Dons'
Tony Styles, a hot-shooting senior
guard who scored 31 points,
including 19 in the second half
which snuffed out any hopes of a
Stanford comeback. Styles is the
classic example of the type of
guard (hard driving, relatively
undisciplined) Arterberry usually
puts in his hip pocket.
Guard Mark Gilberg was able
to take up some of the slack on
defense with aggressive plays,
typified by a play where he drew
an offensive foul by letting
himself get knocked over by a
USF player charging upcourt at
full speed. But Gilberg's efforts
weren't enough to keep USF from
hitting outside shots throughout
the contest.
Kelley Shoots
The lack of perimeter defense
marred what could have l?een the
triumphant emergence of Rich
Kelley from a shooting cocoon.
Over the vacation, Kelley
became Stanford's all-time leading
rebounder and joined the
mythical 1000-point club. But

still, his reluctance to go to the
hoop has partially negated the
huge advantage his presence gives
Stanford.
During the first half, Kelley
shot only six times, sinking three.
But early in the second half,
Kelley started taking the ball to
the basket, over or around his
defenders. In all, Kelley hit 10 of
17 second half shots to finish with
a season high of 31 points, for a
two-game total of 59.
"I was very encouraged with
the way he was taking it in
tonight," an otherwise

discouraged coach Howie Dallmar '
said.
But Kelley's efforts at one end
of the floor were negated by those
of Styles, forward Marvin
Redmond (18 points) and
freshman guard Rod Williams (16)
at the other end. The latter two
players came off the bench and
sparked a first half surge which
took USF from a 29-25 deficit to
a 40-35 halftime bulge.
Forward Ed Schweitzer,
playing well against the more
muscular USF frontliners, led the
Cards in the first half with 12
points, and was especially

effective near the backboards. He
finished the game with 16
rebounds. Kelley, often fumbling
on the defensive boards, got only
seven boards during the game.
Schweitzer finished with 22
points, and that total would have
been 24 except for a freak play
which left the few Stanford fans
in the crowd of 6742 laughing.
Schweitzer got wide open under
the basket, so guard Mike Bratz
threw him a lob pass. Much to the
amazement of Bratz, the pass
went in the hoop.
Too Many Fouls
That play tied the score at
43-all, but things soon started
going downhill. Style-ish heroics
left the Cardinals suddenly down
by eight and thereafter Stanford
fouled way too much to win.
The final margin of five points

a season high of 31 points, for a
two-game total of 59.
"I was very encouraged with
the way he was taking it in
tonight," an otherwise

discouraged coach Howie Dallmar '
said.
But Kelley's efforts at one end
of the floor were negated by those
of Styles, forward Marvin
Redmond (18 points) and
freshman guard Rod Williams (16)
at the other end. The latter two
players came off the bench and
sparked a first half surge which
took USF from a 29-25 deficit to
a 40-35 halftime bulge.
Forward Ed Schweitzer,
playing well against the more
muscular USF frontliners, led the
Cards in the first half with 12
points, and was especially

effective near the backboards. He
finished the game with 16
rebounds. Kelley, often fumbling
on the defensive boards, got only
seven boards during the game.
Schweitzer finished with 22
points, and that total would have
been 24 except for a freak play
which left the few Stanford fans
in the crowd of 6742 laughing.
Schweitzer got wide open under
the basket, so guard Mike Bratz
threw him a lob pass. Much to the
amazement of Bratz, the pass
went in the hoop.
Too Many Fouls
That play tied the score at
43-all, but things soon started
going downhill. Style-ish heroics
left the Cardinals suddenly down
by eight and thereafter Stanford
fouled way too much to win.
The final margin of five points
was the closest Stanford came in
the last six minutes, and virtually
every Cardinal basket was
followed by a defensive lapse that
produced a basket or free throw.
In all, the Dons hit 23 of 39
from the line, while Stanford
connected on nine of omy 17 free
throws. This edge more than
negated Stanford's surplus of five
field goals.
But another statistic tells an
equally important story. USF got
a total of 49 points from its
, guards. The Cardinals got exactly
10.
Even superior play by a team's
big men can't make up 39 points.
