# Arterberry to Play Against Oregon, OSU
## 
### 
Senior guard Melvin Arterberry apparently will return to the
Stanford lineup this weekend when the Cards open their Pacific Eight
season at Oregon and Oregon State.
Arterberry missed the last five Cardinal games when coach Howie
Dallmar was informed by the registrar's office on Dec. 23 that
Arterberry had been suspended from school for failure to complete
enough autumn quarter units. Since that time, however, Arterberry
has received credit for at least 11 and possibly 14 units, and the
suspension will apparently be revoked this week.
According to Assoc. Dean of Students Harold Boyd, one of
Arterberry's courses never appeared on his study list card and there
were mixups in two other classes. "Melvin told me that he had
completed the required work in several courses,Boyd said, "and he
then contacted the professors on his own to make sure course grades
were submitted."
Arterberry is already eligible by Pac-8 and NCAA standards, since
those rules only specify that an athlete complete 36 units in the three
quarters preceeding the season and would therefore not include
autumn quarter grades. He will become eligible by University
standards as soon as official grade change notices reach the registrar's
office from the various professors, and John Harbaugh, Stanford's
Pac-8 faculty representative, formally approves his eligibility.
