# Jeering Fans Spoil Cards Trip To Sandland
## 
### GLENN GARVIN PATTY FELS 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.—The
Pit, they call it around town,
usually with a malicious grin.
Prudent folk do not venture into
the Pit, they add, unless armed
with bazookas and their own
referees. Even so, few come out
alive.
The Pit, the University of New
Mexico's 15,000-seat basketball
arena, is a source of perverse pride
to Albuquerque. The city's
residents glory in the fact that
they can outdo anyone in the
country in terms of crude displays
and ill manners. During basketball
season they put on their show
every weekend the Lobos can
entice someone into the Pit.
"We boo everything ," one
UNM student confided gleefully.
The school's athletic
department does its best to
reciprocate: it thoughtfully
provides the fans with officials
who go into catatonic trance
when confronted with Lobo
misbehavior on the court.
Intersectional coaches regularly
leave the Pit loudly swearing
they'll never go back, while
mumbling in disbelief at foul
statistics.
Fatal
The combination of rabid
spectators, schizophrenic
officiating and, in fairness, some
pretty decent basketball on the
part of the Lobos (although, also
in fairness, it is often alleged that
most of the UNM players have not
entered a classroom since the fifth
grade) is a deadly one: the team
has compiled a 109-17 home
record since the Pit was
constructed in the mid-60s. Its
mark on the road during the same
time span is 150-74.
There is one major argument in
defense of UNM: it is probably
not much worse than the rest of
the Western Athletic Conference,
which has never been shy about
using whatever tactics are
necessary to win at home. Losing
a game on the home court is
tantamount to elimination from
the conference race.
"A couple of road wins really
clinches it in the WAC," Stanford
center Rich Kelley said last week,
lounging on a bed in a Tucson
hotel room. "It's really a goofy
conference that way. I've heard
that has to do with the officiating.
It's an accepted thing to get
homered in this league."
Kelley and his teammates were
getting ready to play their third
consecutive game in WAC
territory, this one against Arizona.
They didn't seem terribly
enthused about the prospect.
"This whole area—the Big Eight,
the Big 10, the WAC—holds a
tremendous advantage on their
courts," forward Scott Trobbe
observed. "They really turn out
and take it seriously. It's not like
the Bay Area where there's a
thousand things to do besides go
to the game."
Unfortunately True
Two days earlier, the Cardinals
had learned the bitter truth of
these words when they played in
the Lobo Invitational in

Albuquerque. On opening night,
Stanford turned back Illinois
89-76 with super shooting from
Trobbe and Tim Patterson. The
next night, though, UNM
double-teamed Stanford's big men
and the shooting touch went cold
as the Lobos won their own
tournament for the eighth time in
10 years, 78-63. And both nights
the standing-room-only crowd
sought to prove that hell hath no
fury like a drunken cow-farmer at
a Lobo game.
For some reason the fans
developed a pathological hatred of
Stanford (and Kelley in
particular) in the first-round game
against Illinois, directing an
unmerciful stream of abuse at the
Cards and the officials, whom
they fancied were not calling
things the right way.
It all made no difference. The
Cards played very well, destroying
a new Illinois zone constructed
especially for this game. Patterson
was deadly inside, hitting 10 of
12, and when the Illinois defense
sagged to the inside to stop him,
Trobbe and guard Mark Gilberg
popped away from outside.
Trobbe connected on 10 of 13

shots and Gilberg scored a season
high of 10.
Overlooked in all of this was a
very tough Stanford zone that
forced Illinois to take a lot of
poor shots—and an all-around fine
game by Kelley, who scored 19
points and tied a tournament
record for rebounds with 18.
Surprising Catcalls
Patterson admitted the boos
and catcalls of the Lobo crowd
were surprising: "I thought since
it was a neutral court, they would
just cheer the good play on either
side. But I don't think it bothered
us very much. Tomorrow night if
we play New Mexico, it's going to
be a totally different story."
The next night, as Patterson
had predicted, was a different
story. Stanford's shooting tailed
off from 63 percent against
Illinois to a very cool 40 percent
against UNM. And the Lobos
out-rebounded the Cards despite
the fact that their tallest man, Bill
Hagins, stands 6-foot-7. Hagins
killed the Cards with 21 points
and 12 rebounds; Kelley seemed
unable to stop him inside. Coach
Howie Dallmar called him "the
best big man we've run into this

year."
"They defensed us real well,"
Dallmar said after the game.
"They double-teamed the big
men. Of course, that leaves
somebody in the open. We have to
hit those open shots, which we
didn't do real well."
He also directed some mild
criticism towards Kelley. "There
are times I think Rich should take
those open shots, even when he's
two-teamed," Dallmar said. "But
he's so unselfish he always hits
that open man." Kelley finished
with 15 points and 11 rebounds,
which won him a spot on the
all-tournament team along with
Trobbe, who scored 17.
His performance was good
enough to make him a permanent
enemy of the crowd. They stood
up and cheered when Kelley
fouled out with just over two
minutes left in the game; the
cheers were not borne of
admiration. They even booed
when he went up to collect his
all-tournament team award.
"It happens most anywhere I
play,'' he shrugged
philosophically. "There's
something about me that makes

me the heavy ... I kind of enjoy
the role."
Long Hair
It went deeper than that,
though. The crowd also cheered
when Gilberg fouled out, after
taunting him all night with shouts
of "hippie!" and "faggot!" for
reasons unknown, since his hair is
no longer than that of several
UNM players.
Despite all these problems, the
game was actually pretty close,
with the Lobos holding a slim
62-59 lead with less than three
minutes to go. Then Kelley fouled
out, the Lobos took a five-point
lead and Stanford had to begin
fouling to get possession of the
ball. UNM hit 14 free throws in
the last 2 I A minutes to ice the
game.
The Cards were far from
unhappy to leave the Pit. "The
crowd makes a lot of difference,"
Trobbe said. "If the crowd's
behind you it has an effect on you
and a psychological effect on the
other team. You make a couple of
steals and layups and then you're
really rolling." But he was quick
to deny that the psychotic
behavior of the fans accounted for
the loss. "We've played in places
like this before. That's kind of an
overworked excuse," Trobbe said.
And the Cards would play in
places like the Pit again—two days
later, to be precise, when they ran
onto the floor of the University of
Arizona's McKale Memorial
Center, another 15,000-seat tomb
in the desert. In Tucson there is
little for the ranchers to do but
lurch drunkenly into their seats in
McKale once or twice a week and
shout clever invective at the
visiting team.
Amusing Antics
"Give him a kiss, coach," one
fan yelled at Stanford assistant
coach Bub Bowling when he got
up to talk to the referee. Remarks
like this are a source of great
hilarity in Tucson. Other amusing
antics include chanting
"bounce-bounce-bounce" when
opposition players dribble the ball
before a free throw, and running
out onto the court to shout at
officials. All in all, Tucson is a
beautiful city full of beautiful
people.
The game might have been
beautiful too, if the Cards could
have eliminated one nightmarish
span of three minutes when a
brawling, physical Arizona defense
produced a series of easy layups
and turned an 18-18 game into a
32-18 runaway. That was the
precise margin of defeat: Arizona
won, 80-67.
The Wildcats might not have
been able to win without some
valuable assists from the officials.
They ignored Arizona's
man-to-man defense, which
looked more like a street gang
than a basketball team. And they
made some astounding calls
against Stanford: whistling a
three-second violation on Kelley
while he was rebounding, allowing
shots that took place after fouls,
and on and on.
WAC-style defense, a
combination of switchblade
fighting and kung fu, was a source

of trouble for Stanford against
both UNM and Arizona. "That's
one of our biggest weakensses,"
Trobbe admitted after the Lobo
game. "We don't have any of that
kind of bigness. In the Pac-8 it's
more a matter of speed and
quickness. It takes us a while to
get used to getting shoved
around."
The Cards did their part to
kick the game away, shooting a
miserable 29 percent in the first
half and committing 24 turnovers.
Arizona's big men, 6-8 A1 Fleming
and 6-10 Bob Elliot, were another
major factor: they totaled 51
points and 25 rebounds.
Quickness and Muscle
After the game Dallmar
morosely toyed with a scorebook
and tried to think of something
positive to say. "They not only
have height, they have quickness
and muscle," he said absently of
the Arizona front line. "When
they went to the zone [in the
second half] that was all right
with me. I thought that we could
handle it. A lot of times we were
too impatient, we didn't work to
get it into the big men, which we
could do."
Kelley played well, with a

season high 28 points and 13
rebounds, but Bowling still felt he
didn't shoot enough. "I don't
know what's wrong," 'he
complained after the game. "It's
not like he's a bad shooter ... No
one is ever going to complain that
he shoots too much."
Losing to the 9-1 Wildcats,
ranked in the Top 20 by both
wire services, was no disgrace,
particularly in Arizona's hellhole
gym. But even though the Cards
left cactus country for good the
next morning, there won't be
much respite from bush-league
fans for a while. Stanford's Pac-8
season will open in Oregon this
weekend, and as Kelley observed:
"In Oregon the atmosphere is
more like pure hate."

still lost them both.
