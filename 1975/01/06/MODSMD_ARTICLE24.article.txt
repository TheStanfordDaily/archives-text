STANFORD 90, NEVADA-RENO 70 (Dec. 14 at
Reno)—lt didn't take long for the Cards to figure out
where Nevada-Reno was most vulnerable. After the
Wolf Pack jumped out to a 6-0 lead and stayed close
throughout the first half, Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar decided to play "power basketball," working
the ball inside to the Cards' giant trio of 7-foot Rich
Kelley, 6-11 Tim Patterson and 6-BV2 Ed Schweitzer.
The result was demoralizing for the smaller Wolf
Pack. Stanford recovered from a 34 percent shooting
performance in the first half to shoot a sizzling 67
percent from the field in the second period. Kelley
scored 24 points, Patterson 23 and Schweitzer 20—67
points in all, even though the three post men were
never in the game at the same time.
Perry Campbell led Nevada-Reno with 22 points,
most of them on long, left-handed bombs. Schweitzer
pulled down 16 rebounds to lead the Cards to a 47-31
edge in that department.
MINNESOTA 53, STANFORD 52 (Dec. 16 at
Minneapolis)—Kelley woke up with a stomach flu on
the morning of the Minnesota game, and after the
contest the entire Stanford team was sick. The
Cardinals squandered a five-point lead with 16 seconds
left in regulation and eventually lost in overtime when
the Gophers' freshman center, Chad Nelson, scored on
a seven-foot jump shot with 32 seconds remaining.
In regulation time, sophomore Mark Landsberger
ignited the crowd of 15,757 by scoring a three-point
play and then stealing the ball from Mark Gilberg on
the ensuing inbounds pass. Landsberger made a layup
with nine seconds left to send the game into overtime.
Stanford failed to convert three one-and-one
opportunities in the overtime period.
Still, the Cards had several ready-made excuses.
Kelley didn't enter the game until midway in the
second period, scoring only two points. And several
calls by the referees were questionable so
questionable, in fact, that Minnesota's sports
information director apologized to his Stanford
counterpart, Gary Cavalli. "There was some home
cookin' going on out there," he said, "and the better
team didn't win."
Kelley offered a simpler explanation. "We choked,"
he said.
Scott Trobbe led the Card scorers with 19 points,
while Schweitzer added 11. Stanford shot 52.4
percent from the field, compared to 37.7 for the
Gophers.
STANFORD 89, WISCONSIN 67 (Dec. 18 at
Madison)— The Cards stayed hot from the field against
the Badgers, and survived a shaky start to blow
Wisconsin out of its home gym. Stanford fell behind
10-2, but battled back to a 39-37 halftime advantage.

The Cards took control early in the second half,
forcing numerous Badger turnovers and scoring at will
at the other end of the court. Patterson came off the
bench to score 22 points on 10-15 from the field, and
five other Cardinals scored in double figures. Kelley
and Melvin Arterberry each contributed 14 points and
eight assists, while Trobbe scored 11 points and
Schweitzer and Mike Bratz added 10 apiece.
Stanford, once leading by an 76-63 margin, shot
58.6 from the floor.
UTAH STATE 77, STAN FORD 74 (Dec. 21 at Maples'
Pavilion)—Dallmar and Utah State coach Dutch Belnap
agreed that patience was the key factor in this one.
"Patience and ballhandling were our two biggest
assets," Belnap said after his Aggies shot a blistering
58.9 from the field to defeat the sloppy Cardinals.
"Instead of going to our strengths," said an angry
Dallmar, "we tried to make the big play every time.
We weren't able to stay with 'em defensively either
zone or man-to-man. If we have trouble with that kind
of quickness, we're going to have trouble with a lot of
teams."
The only highlight for Stanford was the
performance of Kelley, who scored 24 points and
grabbed 19 rebounds. Schweitzer added 15 points and
Arterberry scored 11 all in the first half. Four
Aggies scored in double figures, led by forward Jimmy
Moore with 17 points and 7-foot center Ed Gregg with
16.
STANFORD 80, FLORIDA 70 (Dec. 23 at Maples
Pavilion)—A crowd of 2767 fans fidgeted and yawned
for 23 1 /2 minutes while the Cardinals and Gators
displayed some amazingly dull basketball. But with
16:30 remaining in the game and Stanford leading
40-39, an official's whistle brought the crowd and the
Cards to life.
Kelley was slapped with his fourth foul on a
charging call that wasn't even questionable, and within
minutes the inspired Cards raced to a 50-43 lead.
Patterson, Bratz and freshman guard Jay Carter
provided most of the offensive punch, as Patterson
scored 22 points, Bratz added 19 and Carter
contributed 11 points, six rebounds, four assists and
several steals. *
"I just told myself before the game that I was the
best one out there," said Carter, who seemed nervous
in earlier appearances. "I stopped saying, 'Wow, I'm a
freshman,' and just told myself it was about time to
do something."
The Cards, lacking aggressiveness on the boards,
were out-rebounded 40-27 by the smaller Gators.
Kelley managed 14 points in only 24 minutes of
playing time.

STANFORD 80, FLORIDA 70 (Dec. 23 at Maples
Pavilion)—A crowd of 2767 fans fidgeted and yawned
for 23 1 /2 minutes while the Cardinals and Gators
displayed some amazingly dull basketball. But with
16:30 remaining in the game and Stanford leading
40-39, an official's whistle brought the crowd and the
Cards to life.
Kelley was slapped with his fourth foul on a
charging call that wasn't even questionable, and within
minutes the inspired Cards raced to a 50-43 lead.
Patterson, Bratz and freshman guard Jay Carter
provided most of the offensive punch, as Patterson
scored 22 points, Bratz added 19 and Carter
contributed 11 points, six rebounds, four assists and
several steals. *
"I just told myself before the game that I was the
best one out there," said Carter, who seemed nervous
in earlier appearances. "I stopped saying, 'Wow, I'm a
freshman,' and just told myself it was about time to
do something."
The Cards, lacking aggressiveness on the boards,
were out-rebounded 40-27 by the smaller Gators.
Kelley managed 14 points in only 24 minutes of
playing time.

STANFORD 90, NEVADA-RENO 70 (Dec. 14 at
Reno)—lt didn't take long for the Cards to figure out
where Nevada-Reno was most vulnerable. After the
Wolf Pack jumped out to a 6-0 lead and stayed close
throughout the first half, Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar decided to play "power basketball," working
the ball inside to the Cards' giant trio of 7-foot Rich
Kelley, 6-11 Tim Patterson and 6-BV2 Ed Schweitzer.
The result was demoralizing for the smaller Wolf
Pack. Stanford recovered from a 34 percent shooting
performance in the first half to shoot a sizzling 67
percent from the field in the second period. Kelley
scored 24 points, Patterson 23 and Schweitzer 20—67
points in all, even though the three post men were
never in the game at the same time.
Perry Campbell led Nevada-Reno with 22 points,
most of them on long, left-handed bombs. Schweitzer
pulled down 16 rebounds to lead the Cards to a 47-31
edge in that department.
MINNESOTA 53, STANFORD 52 (Dec. 16 at
Minneapolis)—Kelley woke up with a stomach flu on
the morning of the Minnesota game, and after the
contest the entire Stanford team was sick. The
Cardinals squandered a five-point lead with 16 seconds
left in regulation and eventually lost in overtime when
the Gophers' freshman center, Chad Nelson, scored on
a seven-foot jump shot with 32 seconds remaining.
In regulation time, sophomore Mark Landsberger
ignited the crowd of 15,757 by scoring a three-point
play and then stealing the ball from Mark Gilberg on
the ensuing inbounds pass. Landsberger made a layup
with nine seconds left to send the game into overtime.
Stanford failed to convert three one-and-one
opportunities in the overtime period.
Still, the Cards had several ready-made excuses.
Kelley didn't enter the game until midway in the
second period, scoring only two points. And several
calls by the referees were questionable so
questionable, in fact, that Minnesota's sports
information director apologized to his Stanford
counterpart, Gary Cavalli. "There was some home
cookin' going on out there," he said, "and the better
team didn't win."
Kelley offered a simpler explanation. "We choked,"
he said.
Scott Trobbe led the Card scorers with 19 points,
while Schweitzer added 11. Stanford shot 52.4
percent from the field, compared to 37.7 for the
Gophers.
STANFORD 89, WISCONSIN 67 (Dec. 18 at
Madison)— The Cards stayed hot from the field against
the Badgers, and survived a shaky start to blow
Wisconsin out of its home gym. Stanford fell behind
10-2, but battled back to a 39-37 halftime advantage.

The Cards took control early in the second half,
forcing numerous Badger turnovers and scoring at will
at the other end of the court. Patterson came off the
bench to score 22 points on 10-15 from the field, and
five other Cardinals scored in double figures. Kelley
and Melvin Arterberry each contributed 14 points and
eight assists, while Trobbe scored 11 points and
Schweitzer and Mike Bratz added 10 apiece.

Stanford failed to convert three one-and-one
opportunities in the overtime period.
Still, the Cards had several ready-made excuses.
Kelley didn't enter the game until midway in the
second period, scoring only two points. And several
calls by the referees were questionable so
questionable, in fact, that Minnesota's sports
information director apologized to his Stanford
counterpart, Gary Cavalli. "There was some home
cookin' going on out there," he said, "and the better
team didn't win."
Kelley offered a simpler explanation. "We choked,"
he said.
Scott Trobbe led the Card scorers with 19 points,
while Schweitzer added 11. Stanford shot 52.4
percent from the field, compared to 37.7 for the
Gophers.
STANFORD 89, WISCONSIN 67 (Dec. 18 at
Madison)— The Cards stayed hot from the field against
the Badgers, and survived a shaky start to blow
Wisconsin out of its home gym. Stanford fell behind
10-2, but battled back to a 39-37 halftime advantage.

The Cards took control early in the second half,
forcing numerous Badger turnovers and scoring at will
at the other end of the court. Patterson came off the
bench to score 22 points on 10-15 from the field, and
five other Cardinals scored in double figures. Kelley
and Melvin Arterberry each contributed 14 points and
eight assists, while Trobbe scored 11 points and
Schweitzer and Mike Bratz added 10 apiece.
Stanford, once leading by an 76-63 margin, shot
58.6 from the floor.
UTAH STATE 77, STAN FORD 74 (Dec. 21 at Maples'
Pavilion)—Dallmar and Utah State coach Dutch Belnap
agreed that patience was the key factor in this one.
"Patience and ballhandling were our two biggest
assets," Belnap said after his Aggies shot a blistering
58.9 from the field to defeat the sloppy Cardinals.
"Instead of going to our strengths," said an angry
Dallmar, "we tried to make the big play every time.
We weren't able to stay with 'em defensively either
zone or man-to-man. If we have trouble with that kind
of quickness, we're going to have trouble with a lot of
teams."
The only highlight for Stanford was the
performance of Kelley, who scored 24 points and
grabbed 19 rebounds. Schweitzer added 15 points and
Arterberry scored 11 all in the first half. Four
Aggies scored in double figures, led by forward Jimmy
Moore with 17 points and 7-foot center Ed Gregg with
16.
STANFORD 80, FLORIDA 70 (Dec. 23 at Maples
Pavilion)—A crowd of 2767 fans fidgeted and yawned
for 23 1 /2 minutes while the Cardinals and Gators
displayed some amazingly dull basketball. But with
16:30 remaining in the game and Stanford leading
40-39, an official's whistle brought the crowd and the
Cards to life.
Kelley was slapped with his fourth foul on a
charging call that wasn't even questionable, and within
minutes the inspired Cards raced to a 50-43 lead.
Patterson, Bratz and freshman guard Jay Carter
provided most of the offensive punch, as Patterson
scored 22 points, Bratz added 19 and Carter
contributed 11 points, six rebounds, four assists and
several steals. *
"I just told myself before the game that I was the
best one out there," said Carter, who seemed nervous
in earlier appearances. "I stopped saying, 'Wow, I'm a
freshman,' and just told myself it was about time to
do something."
The Cards, lacking aggressiveness on the boards,
were out-rebounded 40-27 by the smaller Gators.
Kelley managed 14 points in only 24 minutes of
playing time.

STANFORD 90, NEVADA-RENO 70 (Dec. 14 at
Reno)—lt didn't take long for the Cards to figure out
where Nevada-Reno was most vulnerable. After the
Wolf Pack jumped out to a 6-0 lead and stayed close
throughout the first half, Stanford coach Howie
Dallmar decided to play "power basketball," working
the ball inside to the Cards' giant trio of 7-foot Rich
Kelley, 6-11 Tim Patterson and 6-BV2 Ed Schweitzer.
The result was demoralizing for the smaller Wolf
Pack. Stanford recovered from a 34 percent shooting
performance in the first half to shoot a sizzling 67
percent from the field in the second period. Kelley
scored 24 points, Patterson 23 and Schweitzer 20—67
points in all, even though the three post men were
never in the game at the same time.
Perry Campbell led Nevada-Reno with 22 points,
most of them on long, left-handed bombs. Schweitzer
pulled down 16 rebounds to lead the Cards to a 47-31
edge in that department.
MINNESOTA 53, STANFORD 52 (Dec. 16 at
Minneapolis)—Kelley woke up with a stomach flu on
the morning of the Minnesota game, and after the
contest the entire Stanford team was sick. The
Cardinals squandered a five-point lead with 16 seconds
left in regulation and eventually lost in overtime when
the Gophers' freshman center, Chad Nelson, scored on
a seven-foot jump shot with 32 seconds remaining.
In regulation time, sophomore Mark Landsberger
ignited the crowd of 15,757 by scoring a three-point
play and then stealing the ball from Mark Gilberg on
the ensuing inbounds pass. Landsberger made a layup
with nine seconds left to send the game into overtime.
