f ~ "We just did a very good job,"
4 happy coach Joe DeMeo said
the tournament. "We
/ wrestled. The guys did a super job
competing with some of the best
teams and certainly the best
individual talent in California this
week.. Only UCLA was missing."
California won the day-long
, affair, which brought 12 teams
> together >East Bay. The

Bears piled up 85 points to lead
UC-Bakersfield, UC-Fullerton and
the Cards in the final standings.
"If it weren't for an injury, we
probably would have been as high
as second," DeMeo said.
Stanford's 150-pounder, Chris
Horpel, who has been DeMeo's
steadiest performer throughout
the current campaign, and John
Govea at 190 picked up blue
ribbons in the meet. Both won
their weight catagories in
impressive fashion. According to
DeMeo, Horpel was runnerup for
the "Wrestler of the Meet" award.
The injury DeMeo felt cost his
club second place at the Hayward
meet was to Malcolm Scott (118).
Scott, v/on had gotten all the way
to the semi-finals, was forced to
withdraw from a match he was
leading 2-0 because of a leg injury.
DeMeo had words of praise for
Rich DeFrancissis (134). In only
his second year of organized
wrestling, he collided with Cal
Poly's Leon lanarelly, fourth
place finisher in last year's NCAA
college division meet, and very
nearly came away with an upset.
At 142, Ken Krebs placed
second, losing only to Cal's Brent
Jacinto, 7-2. "It was a good match
for all but three seconds," DeMeo
said. "In those three seconds he
made mistakes which cost him the
match."
Horpel was taken into overtime
before taking the title at 150.
Tied at the end of regulation time
3-3 by Steve Widbey of Cal, a
wrestler who had beaten him
earlier in the year, Horpel scored
nine points in the overtime period
to win going away.
Craig Reynolds, at 158, also
drew praise. Losing his first
match, ,he wrestled his way
through the consolations and
defeated San Francisco State's
Rick Morford 7-0 to take third.
He won his other matches easily.
Govea, too, was impressive.
Competing in what DeMeo
described as "a supertough weight
division," he won the title when
Bakersfield's Steve Weisenback
was injured. The Card
190-pounder was leading 2-0 at
the time.
Stanford will be at home
Tuesday night for a match with
Hayward at Encina Gym. The
Cardinals will be protecting a 3-1
dual meet record, one of the best
starts in the school's history.
DeMeo said that the Hayward
club boasts excellent wrestlers in
the middle weight divisions and
should provide the Cardinals with
one of their toughest tests of the
season. Matches begin at 7:30

competing with some of the best
teams and certainly the best
individual talent in California this
week.. Only UCLA was missing."
California won the day-long
, affair, which brought 12 teams
> together >East Bay. The

Bears piled up 85 points to lead
UC-Bakersfield, UC-Fullerton and
the Cards in the final standings.
"If it weren't for an injury, we
probably would have been as high
as second," DeMeo said.
Stanford's 150-pounder, Chris
Horpel, who has been DeMeo's
steadiest performer throughout
the current campaign, and John
Govea at 190 picked up blue
ribbons in the meet. Both won
their weight catagories in
impressive fashion. According to
DeMeo, Horpel was runnerup for
the "Wrestler of the Meet" award.
The injury DeMeo felt cost his
club second place at the Hayward
meet was to Malcolm Scott (118).
Scott, v/on had gotten all the way
to the semi-finals, was forced to
withdraw from a match he was
leading 2-0 because of a leg injury.
DeMeo had words of praise for
Rich DeFrancissis (134). In only
his second year of organized
wrestling, he collided with Cal
Poly's Leon lanarelly, fourth
place finisher in last year's NCAA
college division meet, and very
nearly came away with an upset.
At 142, Ken Krebs placed
second, losing only to Cal's Brent
Jacinto, 7-2. "It was a good match
for all but three seconds," DeMeo
said. "In those three seconds he
made mistakes which cost him the
match."
Horpel was taken into overtime
before taking the title at 150.
Tied at the end of regulation time
3-3 by Steve Widbey of Cal, a
wrestler who had beaten him
earlier in the year, Horpel scored
nine points in the overtime period
to win going away.
Craig Reynolds, at 158, also
drew praise. Losing his first
match, ,he wrestled his way
through the consolations and
defeated San Francisco State's
Rick Morford 7-0 to take third.
He won his other matches easily.
Govea, too, was impressive.
Competing in what DeMeo
described as "a supertough weight
division," he won the title when
Bakersfield's Steve Weisenback
was injured. The Card
190-pounder was leading 2-0 at
the time.
Stanford will be at home
Tuesday night for a match with
Hayward at Encina Gym. The
Cardinals will be protecting a 3-1
dual meet record, one of the best
starts in the school's history.
DeMeo said that the Hayward
club boasts excellent wrestlers in
the middle weight divisions and
should provide the Cardinals with
one of their toughest tests of the
season. Matches begin at 7:30
