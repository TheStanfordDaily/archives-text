# Shrine Attraction 'Ugly'
## 
### ALEX HULANICKI Commentary 
Another facet of American sport on the
verge of extinction, like the World Football
League, visited Stanford last month the 50th
East-West Shrine Classic, a venerable road show
that cannot match P.T. Barnum's "Greatest
Show on Earth."
In fact, promoter Bob Murphy's production
Dec. 28, 1974 faced so many obstacles that one
question remains: "Will there be another?"
As one observer, who shivered in the press
box of Stanford Stadium hoping that it
wouldn't rain anymore, said, after yet another
misplay on the field: "God, that was ugly."
How perceptive of the fellow, one of an
estimated 42,000 in attendance. At least,
officially there were 42,000 in the stadium.
Some estimates placed the figure closer to
36,000.
Pro Scouts Present
Of those braving the elements, there were
some noteworthy characters. Professional
scouts, looking for selections in the NFL draft,
were there. The WFL doesn't know whether
there will be a draft this year. NBC's cameras
were there. The cameramen showed up
reluctantly. Charley Jones, NBC's pot-bellietf
counterpart to ABC's youthful duo, Don
Tollefson and Jim Lampley, was there. Even
the coaches and players showed up.
Oh, the East won 16-14 on "two of the
freakiest plays" ever seen and a field goal. But
who cares?
TV Doesn't Care
It doesn't look like television cares. The
present television contract shows that the
piddlingly paltry $lO,OOO was received by
Shrine officials for coverage. That was from
the richest media corporation in America. Why
can't the "strong legs" of NBC run "so weak
legs may walk"?
And the future, if there is a future, isn't
much brighter. Next game's monetary
remuneration will be $25,000 and it'll be

$35,000 in 1976. Obviously, there isn't any
money in the network contract. So ticket sales
is another answer.
But officials are reluctant to disclose the
financial solvency of the game at this time.
Either it doesn't look good or it is very bad.
Low Ticket Sales
Murphy admitted that 50,000 ticket sales
were necessary for the game to make money.
But only 42,000 showed up.
Murphy's three-ring circus wasn't confined
to the football field. For two weeks prior to the
game the players were showcased throughout
the Bay area. The Hyatt Regency, Marine World
and the Shriner's Hospital were just a few of
the stops. Of course, all this promotion cost
money.
The big event was dull and dismal in contrast
to the pre-game buildup. After the multitudes
of shriners marched into the stadium, (the
players had to warm up on a muddy practice
field) the East and West clashed in a first half
dominated by the West defense.
During that half, All-American quarterback
Steve Bartkowski of California tossed a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Morris Owens of Arizona
State. Then, small college All-American
quarterback Jim McMillan of Boise State
connected on a 10-yard pass to Oscar Roan of
Southern Methodist.
In the second half, the East defense scored
on an unusual play. Defensive end Randy
White, the Outland Trophy winner from
Maryland, hit West punter Steve Boyd of
Washington, causing Boyd's kick to be
deflected to East linebacker Terry McLowry of
Michigan, who ran 16 yards to score. Mike
Franckowiak added the conversion kick.
Fumble Recovery
In the fourth quarter, the East scored again
on a play not considered run of the mill.
Franklin fumbled the snap from center at the
West 11 yard line and Boston College's Brad
Davis alertly scooped up the ball and sprinted
over the goal line. Franckowiak's kick was
blocked.
With 4:34 left Franckowiak booted a
32-yard field goal to give the east the win. But
who cares?
Including a half-hour-long halftime which
was filled by marching shriners, the game took
nearly 3V2 hours to complete. A boring 3V2
hours to say the least.
It has been, suggested that the all-star format
of the Shrine Classic be replaced with the
second-place teams of the Pacific Eight and
Big-10 conferences meeting a runnerup bowl,
second only to the Rose Bowl.
That seems to be a very good idea but
doesn't seem likely to take place.
So we'll have to be happy with Evel Knievel
strolling along the sidelines and Nadji the Africa
U.S.A. tiger mauling its trainer Les Peterson at
halftime. Not even a two-headed lady is going
to save the East-West Shrine Game. God,
that's ugly.

to the pre-game buildup. After the multitudes
of shriners marched into the stadium, (the
players had to warm up on a muddy practice
field) the East and West clashed in a first half
dominated by the West defense.
During that half, All-American quarterback
Steve Bartkowski of California tossed a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Morris Owens of Arizona
State. Then, small college All-American
quarterback Jim McMillan of Boise State
connected on a 10-yard pass to Oscar Roan of
Southern Methodist.
In the second half, the East defense scored
on an unusual play. Defensive end Randy
White, the Outland Trophy winner from
Maryland, hit West punter Steve Boyd of
Washington, causing Boyd's kick to be
deflected to East linebacker Terry McLowry of
Michigan, who ran 16 yards to score. Mike
Franckowiak added the conversion kick.
Fumble Recovery
In the fourth quarter, the East scored again
on a play not considered run of the mill.
Franklin fumbled the snap from center at the
West 11 yard line and Boston College's Brad
Davis alertly scooped up the ball and sprinted
over the goal line. Franckowiak's kick was
blocked.
With 4:34 left Franckowiak booted a
32-yard field goal to give the east the win. But
who cares?
Including a half-hour-long halftime which
was filled by marching shriners, the game took
nearly 3V2 hours to complete. A boring 3V2
hours to say the least.
It has been, suggested that the all-star format
of the Shrine Classic be replaced with the
second-place teams of the Pacific Eight and
Big-10 conferences meeting a runnerup bowl,
second only to the Rose Bowl.
That seems to be a very good idea but
doesn't seem likely to take place.
So we'll have to be happy with Evel Knievel
strolling along the sidelines and Nadji the Africa
U.S.A. tiger mauling its trainer Les Peterson at
halftime. Not even a two-headed lady is going
to save the East-West Shrine Game. God,
that's ugly.

Another facet of American sport on the
verge of extinction, like the World Football
League, visited Stanford last month the 50th
East-West Shrine Classic, a venerable road show
that cannot match P.T. Barnum's "Greatest
Show on Earth."
In fact, promoter Bob Murphy's production
Dec. 28, 1974 faced so many obstacles that one
question remains: "Will there be another?"
As one observer, who shivered in the press
box of Stanford Stadium hoping that it
wouldn't rain anymore, said, after yet another
misplay on the field: "God, that was ugly."
How perceptive of the fellow, one of an
estimated 42,000 in attendance. At least,
officially there were 42,000 in the stadium.
Some estimates placed the figure closer to
36,000.
Pro Scouts Present
Of those braving the elements, there were
some noteworthy characters. Professional
scouts, looking for selections in the NFL draft,
were there. The WFL doesn't know whether
there will be a draft this year. NBC's cameras
were there. The cameramen showed up
reluctantly. Charley Jones, NBC's pot-bellietf
counterpart to ABC's youthful duo, Don
Tollefson and Jim Lampley, was there. Even
the coaches and players showed up.
Oh, the East won 16-14 on "two of the
freakiest plays" ever seen and a field goal. But
who cares?
TV Doesn't Care
It doesn't look like television cares. The
present television contract shows that the
piddlingly paltry $lO,OOO was received by
Shrine officials for coverage. That was from
the richest media corporation in America. Why
can't the "strong legs" of NBC run "so weak
legs may walk"?
And the future, if there is a future, isn't
much brighter. Next game's monetary
remuneration will be $25,000 and it'll be

$35,000 in 1976. Obviously, there isn't any
money in the network contract. So ticket sales
is another answer.
But officials are reluctant to disclose the
financial solvency of the game at this time.
Either it doesn't look good or it is very bad.
Low Ticket Sales
Murphy admitted that 50,000 ticket sales
were necessary for the game to make money.
But only 42,000 showed up.
Murphy's three-ring circus wasn't confined
to the football field. For two weeks prior to the
game the players were showcased throughout
the Bay area. The Hyatt Regency, Marine World
and the Shriner's Hospital were just a few of
the stops. Of course, all this promotion cost
money.

officially there were 42,000 in the stadium.
Some estimates placed the figure closer to
36,000.
Pro Scouts Present
Of those braving the elements, there were
some noteworthy characters. Professional
scouts, looking for selections in the NFL draft,
were there. The WFL doesn't know whether
there will be a draft this year. NBC's cameras
were there. The cameramen showed up
reluctantly. Charley Jones, NBC's pot-bellietf
counterpart to ABC's youthful duo, Don
Tollefson and Jim Lampley, was there. Even
the coaches and players showed up.
Oh, the East won 16-14 on "two of the
freakiest plays" ever seen and a field goal. But
who cares?
TV Doesn't Care
It doesn't look like television cares. The
present television contract shows that the
piddlingly paltry $lO,OOO was received by
Shrine officials for coverage. That was from
the richest media corporation in America. Why
can't the "strong legs" of NBC run "so weak
legs may walk"?
And the future, if there is a future, isn't
much brighter. Next game's monetary
remuneration will be $25,000 and it'll be

$35,000 in 1976. Obviously, there isn't any
money in the network contract. So ticket sales
is another answer.
But officials are reluctant to disclose the
financial solvency of the game at this time.
Either it doesn't look good or it is very bad.
Low Ticket Sales
Murphy admitted that 50,000 ticket sales
were necessary for the game to make money.
But only 42,000 showed up.
Murphy's three-ring circus wasn't confined
to the football field. For two weeks prior to the
game the players were showcased throughout
the Bay area. The Hyatt Regency, Marine World
and the Shriner's Hospital were just a few of
the stops. Of course, all this promotion cost
money.
The big event was dull and dismal in contrast
to the pre-game buildup. After the multitudes
of shriners marched into the stadium, (the
players had to warm up on a muddy practice
field) the East and West clashed in a first half
dominated by the West defense.
During that half, All-American quarterback
Steve Bartkowski of California tossed a 34-yard
touchdown pass to Morris Owens of Arizona
State. Then, small college All-American
quarterback Jim McMillan of Boise State
connected on a 10-yard pass to Oscar Roan of
Southern Methodist.
In the second half, the East defense scored
on an unusual play. Defensive end Randy
White, the Outland Trophy winner from
Maryland, hit West punter Steve Boyd of
Washington, causing Boyd's kick to be
deflected to East linebacker Terry McLowry of
Michigan, who ran 16 yards to score. Mike
Franckowiak added the conversion kick.
Fumble Recovery
In the fourth quarter, the East scored again
on a play not considered run of the mill.
Franklin fumbled the snap from center at the
West 11 yard line and Boston College's Brad
Davis alertly scooped up the ball and sprinted
over the goal line. Franckowiak's kick was
blocked.
With 4:34 left Franckowiak booted a
32-yard field goal to give the east the win. But
who cares?
Including a half-hour-long halftime which
was filled by marching shriners, the game took
nearly 3V2 hours to complete. A boring 3V2
hours to say the least.
It has been, suggested that the all-star format
of the Shrine Classic be replaced with the
second-place teams of the Pacific Eight and
Big-10 conferences meeting a runnerup bowl,
second only to the Rose Bowl.
That seems to be a very good idea but
doesn't seem likely to take place.
So we'll have to be happy with Evel Knievel
strolling along the sidelines and Nadji the Africa
U.S.A. tiger mauling its trainer Les Peterson at
halftime. Not even a two-headed lady is going
to save the East-West Shrine Game. God,
that's ugly.
