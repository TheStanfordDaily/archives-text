# Student Waivers Preserve Privacy
## Senate Amends File Disclosure 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
A Senate amendment to a controversial act forcing
universities to open student files was passed late last month.
The amendment permits students to sign waivers allowing
their schools to maintain the confidentiality of
recommendations.
Other amendments protect the confidentiality of all
letters and statements of recommendation placed in records
before Jan. 1 of this year and stipulate that general
"directory information" can be made public only if a
university announces the information to be released.
The provisions amend the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy "Buckley" Amendment to the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act of 1965.
"The provision for waivers probably is most significant,"
Admissions Dean Fred Hargadon said yesterday. "The
Senate passed it partly in response to all the universities
that wrote in protesting the bill in its original form and
partly out of embarrassment that it had never held hearings
on the matter."
Impact
The waivers affect communications received in
connection with admissions, applications for employment
and receipt of honors or honorary recognition.
In a letter sent Saturday, to deans and department
chairmen, James Siena, legal counsel to President Lyman,
explained that the administration is "loathe to dictate a
standard University form for such waivers. Rather, it seems

best to start such an effort at the school level of each
principal administrative office, so that the needs of each
such entity can be accommodated."
Siena told the Daily that if students refuse to sign the
waivers, their letters of recommendation will be returned to
the writers who can decide whether or not to allow the
student to see it.
Siena emphasized that the law forbids making a waiver
the condition for admission to a university.
"The waiver can be no more than an option," he noted.
Sealed Files
Siena said that he is particularly pleased with the Senate
amendment that allows files predating the first of the year
to remain sealed.
"This provision makes things a little easier for us," Siena
declared. He explained that the University will not now be
forced to destroy old student recommendations, as had
been suggested by leading administrators.
According to Hargadon, no problem is expected with
recommendations that will be received after the first of the
year. Potential students will receive the opportunity to sign
waivers after their acceptance, in accordance with what is
expected to become standard practice.
Siena expressed approval of the amendment to force
universities to release general information such as student
ages, addresses, telephone numbers, height and weight if
public notice is given so that students can refuse to allow to
have the information released.
In its original form, the law forbade the publication of
any such material. It would have made impossible even the
publication of a student directory, according to Siena.
Calling the amendment "right and sensible," Siena
admitted that notifying students of the planned release of
so-called general information might be somewhat
cumbersome because it could involve sending individual
letters to each student.
Siena nevertheless said he is "not troubled" by such a
prospect and doesn't expect the notification process to be
overwhelmingly difficult.
Another Senate amendment, barring universities from

making "personally identifiable information" on students
available to third parties without student consent, will not
affect Stanford because it merely conforms to a
long-standing University policy, Siens said.
Despite the amendments, University administrators are
still plainly opposed to the Buckley Amendment.
"While the changes represent some improvement, the
law remains ambiguous and almost noxiously burdensome,"
Siena stated in his memorandum to deans and department
chairmen.
Siena told the Daily that the law creates "a lot of federal
intervention in an area where it isn't needed."
He claimed that if writers of recommendations are faced
with the prospect of having them made public, "We'll start
getting a bunch of bland, innocuous, noncommittal
recommendations that will not be useful."
