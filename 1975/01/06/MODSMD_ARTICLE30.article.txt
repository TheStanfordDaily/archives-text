# Card Foes Strong In Bowl Game Play
## 
### 
Long after Mike Langford
ended Stanford's grid season on a
high note, holiday bowl games
were making the Cards' 1974 year
look even rosier.
Southern California upset Ohio
State 18-17 in the Rose Bowl to
win the n ational-champion
ship-with-an-asterisk.
It was USC which humiliated
Stanford, 34-10 in a
much-heralded showdown last
November. At the time, the
Trojans had just been tied by
California and were in the midst
of a mediocre campaign. Starting
with the Stanford contest, they
went on a rampage.
Penn State, which turned back
Stanford in a heartbreak opener,
24-20, routed Baylor in the Cotton
Bowl, 41-20. The Nittany Lions
finished seventh in the nation.

Michigan benefited from not
coming West to lose to USC,
holding on to thier 10-1 mark and
a fifth-place UPI ranking. The
Wolverines endured a spirited
Cardinal effort last October to
win, 27-16.
So Stanford „can excuse all
three of those defeats.
The final loss of the Cards'
5-4-2 record, however, is harder to
dismiss. Illinois went nowhere
after sacking Stanford, 41-7.
UCLA, who the Cards tied, got
a few votes in the final Associated
Press poll. So did California,
which Stanford beat, 22-20.

Palin was voted the North's
outstanding defensive player in
the Blue-Grey Game. Card mentor
