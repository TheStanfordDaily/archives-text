# JV Rusty After Layoff
## 
### 
The Stanford JV basketball
squad's five-week layoff showed
Saturday night, as the Cards
dropped an 87-63 contest to the
Skyline College JV's on the
Skyline court.
After a dismal first half, in
which Skyline outscored the
Cards 49-25, Stanford came back
to match Skyline's 38 second half
points.
Stanford was paced by
sophomore Sven Walker and Scott
Russell, who chipped in 14 points
each.
Stanford coach Percy Carr said
the Cards second half
performance was a good team
effort. "After a five-week layoff, I
think we played about as well as
can be expected. We came back
and tied them in the second half
on team play," Carr said.
The Cards were plagued by the
same inconsistency that marked
their 83-72 opening loss to
UC-Davis on Nov. 30, as the
out-of-shape Cards turned the ball

over nine times in the first half.
"After a five-week layoff we
were out of shape and we
probably shouldn't have been
playing a game, but it was on the
schedule," Carr said.
The first year JV coach made a
late cut to the squad this week,
dropping two players to bring the
squad down to 17.
"We have some guys coming
out from football and so we had a
surplus of players. I may make
another cut in a couple of weeks,"
Corr said.
The 0-2 Cards will have a week
to get back into shape before
taking on Santa Clara Tuesday,
Jan. 14 at 7 p.m. in Maples.
