Rocky To Head CIA Probe
WASHINGTON Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller
was appointed yesterday by President Ford to head an
eight-member presidential commission to investigate
allegations that the CIA illegally spied on American
citizens.
Rockefeller said through a spokesman that he accepted
the assignment with a sense of responsibility "for public
confidence in our governmental institutions" as well as the
need to preserve national security, freedom and human
dignity.
The spokesman said he knew of no special instructions
from the President to the vice president about how to
conduct the investigation.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger attended the
meeting, the spokesman said.
The other commission members appointed by Ford were
former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, retired Gen. Lyman
Lemnitzer, former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold,
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Joseph Lane Kirkland, retired
University of "Virginia President Edgar F. Shannon, former
Commerce Secretary John T. Connor and former Treasury
Secretary C. Douglas Dillon.
White House spokesmen said Ford sought to name
commission members without any affiliation with the CIA
to avoid any conflict of interest in the investigation.
In a telephone interview, Lemnitzer, a former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he had dealings with the
CIA before he retired from the military in 1969.
"Any person of a high position in the military has had to
have" such dealings, Lemnitzer said. Asked whether he
thought this presented a conflict, he responded: "Not that I
know of."
Brown's Team To Take Office
SACRAMENTO Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr.
reached for the reins of state government today with a
mixed message of fiscal restraint and "new spirit" liberal
philosophy.
The 36-year-old son of California's last Democratic
governor was slated to be sworn in as California's 34th
governor befqre a joint session of the state Senate and
Assembly and a statewide television audience.
Brown was secretive in advance of his inaugural message
about its contents, and aides said he was still working on it
and revising it late last night.
The address was slated for delivery at 10:15 a.m. on a
network of 20 California television stations. Immediately,
afterward, he was to leave for San Francisco and Los
Angeles for inaugural meetings with Mayors Joseph Alioto
and Tom Bradley.
In the weeks prior to his inauguration, Brown's actions
gave contradictory hints of the philosophical direction his
administration would take.
The "new spirit" team which Brown has named so far
comes to government with liberal credentials. But the
governor-elect has been talking more like a fiscal
conservative in recent weeks as the magnitude of
California's economic problems becomes clearer.
Brown's task was a difficult one. He was under pressure
to reconcile the hopes of his many liberal supporters with
his own promise of no new taxes this year and the prospect

of a dwindling, recession-squeezed surplus in the state
budget.
Cambodian Rebels Near Capitol
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Rebels launched fresh
assaults yesterday against a besieged government force on
the Mekong River two miles east of Phnom Penh in what
observers said was the possible prelude to an all-out
offensive against the capital.
Field reports said insurgents lobbed more than 200
mortar rounds and sent waves of ground troops against
government soldiers just south of Arey Khsat village on the
east bank of the Mekong, where fierce fighting has been
reported during the past five days.
Intelligence reports said an estimated 15,000 to 20,000
rebel troops are concentrated around Phnom Penh.
Insurgents have fired about 36 rounds of rockets into
Phnom Penh since New Year's day, killing or wounding 40
persons.
President Lon Nol visited a battlefield Sunday and
ordered field commanders to fight the Khmer Rouge rebels
"at all costs in order to achieve a military victory."
'Nixon Didn't Know Of Break-In'
NEW YORK The chief prosecutor in the Watergate
trial has told Time magazine he doesn't think former
President Richard M. Nixon knew in advance of the
Watergate break-in.
Time said the prosecutor, James Neal, stated flatly that
Nixon didn't authorize the bugging.
In support of his opinion, Neal noted that tapes revealed
that Nixon showed "some surprise" when told of the
break-in.
Neal, who resigned last week after the trial, said Nixon
was at least indirectly responsible for the actions of his
aides.
"Watergate goes back to the nature of the big man,"
Neal said.
Oil Negotiation Reaches Crisis Point
DENVER The oil industry is creating a crisis
atmosphere in negotiations with petroleum workers and has
failed to submit a reasonable contract proposal, the
president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
International Union said yesterday.
"This industry has always been a 'crisis bargainer,' " said
union president A.F. Grospiron. "They run down to the
deadline and then look in the sack. So far there's very little
in that sack."
The union, which claims to represent 60,000 oil workers
across the country, is negotiating with oil companies
individually. The current contracts expire at midnight
tomorrow.
Each company's contract must be approved by the
union's 12-member bargaining policy council in Denver
before the 400 locals can vote on the proposals.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy through today. Rain likely at times
tonight and tomorrow. Little temperature change. Low
both nights in the 40s. High today and tomorrow in the
50s. i

The spokesman said he knew of no special instructions
from the President to the vice president about how to
conduct the investigation.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger attended the
meeting, the spokesman said.
The other commission members appointed by Ford were
former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, retired Gen. Lyman
Lemnitzer, former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold,
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Joseph Lane Kirkland, retired
University of "Virginia President Edgar F. Shannon, former
Commerce Secretary John T. Connor and former Treasury
Secretary C. Douglas Dillon.
White House spokesmen said Ford sought to name
commission members without any affiliation with the CIA
to avoid any conflict of interest in the investigation.
In a telephone interview, Lemnitzer, a former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he had dealings with the
CIA before he retired from the military in 1969.
"Any person of a high position in the military has had to
have" such dealings, Lemnitzer said. Asked whether he
thought this presented a conflict, he responded: "Not that I
know of."
Brown's Team To Take Office
SACRAMENTO Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr.
reached for the reins of state government today with a
mixed message of fiscal restraint and "new spirit" liberal
philosophy.
The 36-year-old son of California's last Democratic
governor was slated to be sworn in as California's 34th
governor befqre a joint session of the state Senate and
Assembly and a statewide television audience.
Brown was secretive in advance of his inaugural message
about its contents, and aides said he was still working on it
and revising it late last night.
The address was slated for delivery at 10:15 a.m. on a
network of 20 California television stations. Immediately,
afterward, he was to leave for San Francisco and Los
Angeles for inaugural meetings with Mayors Joseph Alioto
and Tom Bradley.
In the weeks prior to his inauguration, Brown's actions
gave contradictory hints of the philosophical direction his
administration would take.
The "new spirit" team which Brown has named so far
comes to government with liberal credentials. But the
governor-elect has been talking more like a fiscal
conservative in recent weeks as the magnitude of
California's economic problems becomes clearer.
Brown's task was a difficult one. He was under pressure
to reconcile the hopes of his many liberal supporters with
his own promise of no new taxes this year and the prospect

of a dwindling, recession-squeezed surplus in the state
budget.
Cambodian Rebels Near Capitol
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Rebels launched fresh
assaults yesterday against a besieged government force on
the Mekong River two miles east of Phnom Penh in what
observers said was the possible prelude to an all-out
offensive against the capital.
Field reports said insurgents lobbed more than 200
mortar rounds and sent waves of ground troops against
government soldiers just south of Arey Khsat village on the
east bank of the Mekong, where fierce fighting has been
reported during the past five days.
Intelligence reports said an estimated 15,000 to 20,000
rebel troops are concentrated around Phnom Penh.
Insurgents have fired about 36 rounds of rockets into
Phnom Penh since New Year's day, killing or wounding 40
persons.
President Lon Nol visited a battlefield Sunday and
ordered field commanders to fight the Khmer Rouge rebels
"at all costs in order to achieve a military victory."
'Nixon Didn't Know Of Break-In'
NEW YORK The chief prosecutor in the Watergate
trial has told Time magazine he doesn't think former
President Richard M. Nixon knew in advance of the
Watergate break-in.
Time said the prosecutor, James Neal, stated flatly that
Nixon didn't authorize the bugging.
In support of his opinion, Neal noted that tapes revealed
that Nixon showed "some surprise" when told of the
break-in.
Neal, who resigned last week after the trial, said Nixon
was at least indirectly responsible for the actions of his
aides.
"Watergate goes back to the nature of the big man,"
Neal said.
Oil Negotiation Reaches Crisis Point
DENVER The oil industry is creating a crisis
atmosphere in negotiations with petroleum workers and has
failed to submit a reasonable contract proposal, the
president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
International Union said yesterday.
"This industry has always been a 'crisis bargainer,' " said
union president A.F. Grospiron. "They run down to the
deadline and then look in the sack. So far there's very little
in that sack."
The union, which claims to represent 60,000 oil workers
across the country, is negotiating with oil companies
individually. The current contracts expire at midnight
tomorrow.
Each company's contract must be approved by the
union's 12-member bargaining policy council in Denver
before the 400 locals can vote on the proposals.

former California Gov. Ronald Reagan, retired Gen. Lyman
Lemnitzer, former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold,
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Joseph Lane Kirkland, retired
University of "Virginia President Edgar F. Shannon, former
Commerce Secretary John T. Connor and former Treasury
Secretary C. Douglas Dillon.
White House spokesmen said Ford sought to name
commission members without any affiliation with the CIA
to avoid any conflict of interest in the investigation.
In a telephone interview, Lemnitzer, a former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he had dealings with the
CIA before he retired from the military in 1969.
"Any person of a high position in the military has had to
have" such dealings, Lemnitzer said. Asked whether he
thought this presented a conflict, he responded: "Not that I
know of."
Brown's Team To Take Office
SACRAMENTO Democrat Edmund G. Brown Jr.
reached for the reins of state government today with a
mixed message of fiscal restraint and "new spirit" liberal
philosophy.
The 36-year-old son of California's last Democratic
governor was slated to be sworn in as California's 34th
governor befqre a joint session of the state Senate and
Assembly and a statewide television audience.
Brown was secretive in advance of his inaugural message
about its contents, and aides said he was still working on it
and revising it late last night.
The address was slated for delivery at 10:15 a.m. on a
network of 20 California television stations. Immediately,
afterward, he was to leave for San Francisco and Los
Angeles for inaugural meetings with Mayors Joseph Alioto
and Tom Bradley.
In the weeks prior to his inauguration, Brown's actions
gave contradictory hints of the philosophical direction his
administration would take.
The "new spirit" team which Brown has named so far
comes to government with liberal credentials. But the
governor-elect has been talking more like a fiscal
conservative in recent weeks as the magnitude of
California's economic problems becomes clearer.
Brown's task was a difficult one. He was under pressure
to reconcile the hopes of his many liberal supporters with
his own promise of no new taxes this year and the prospect

of a dwindling, recession-squeezed surplus in the state
budget.
Cambodian Rebels Near Capitol
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Rebels launched fresh
assaults yesterday against a besieged government force on
the Mekong River two miles east of Phnom Penh in what
observers said was the possible prelude to an all-out
offensive against the capital.
Field reports said insurgents lobbed more than 200
mortar rounds and sent waves of ground troops against
government soldiers just south of Arey Khsat village on the
east bank of the Mekong, where fierce fighting has been
reported during the past five days.
Intelligence reports said an estimated 15,000 to 20,000
rebel troops are concentrated around Phnom Penh.
Insurgents have fired about 36 rounds of rockets into
Phnom Penh since New Year's day, killing or wounding 40
persons.
President Lon Nol visited a battlefield Sunday and
ordered field commanders to fight the Khmer Rouge rebels
"at all costs in order to achieve a military victory."
'Nixon Didn't Know Of Break-In'
NEW YORK The chief prosecutor in the Watergate
trial has told Time magazine he doesn't think former
President Richard M. Nixon knew in advance of the
Watergate break-in.
Time said the prosecutor, James Neal, stated flatly that
Nixon didn't authorize the bugging.
In support of his opinion, Neal noted that tapes revealed
that Nixon showed "some surprise" when told of the
break-in.
Neal, who resigned last week after the trial, said Nixon
was at least indirectly responsible for the actions of his
aides.
"Watergate goes back to the nature of the big man,"
Neal said.
Oil Negotiation Reaches Crisis Point
DENVER The oil industry is creating a crisis
atmosphere in negotiations with petroleum workers and has
failed to submit a reasonable contract proposal, the
president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
International Union said yesterday.
"This industry has always been a 'crisis bargainer,' " said
union president A.F. Grospiron. "They run down to the
deadline and then look in the sack. So far there's very little
in that sack."
The union, which claims to represent 60,000 oil workers
across the country, is negotiating with oil companies
individually. The current contracts expire at midnight
tomorrow.
Each company's contract must be approved by the
union's 12-member bargaining policy council in Denver
before the 400 locals can vote on the proposals.
Today's Weather

Rocky To Head CIA Probe
WASHINGTON Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller
was appointed yesterday by President Ford to head an
eight-member presidential commission to investigate
allegations that the CIA illegally spied on American

conduct the investigation.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger attended the
meeting, the spokesman said.
