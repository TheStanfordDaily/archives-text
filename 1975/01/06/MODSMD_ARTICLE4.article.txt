# Rift Threatens Willow Road Widening Project
## 
### MARK FUNK 
Stanford and Palo Alto officials
appear to be heading toward a
deadlock that could kill a propqsed
$6.6 million widening and
improvement project for Willow Road.
Still grappling to piece together an
alternative proposal on the
controversial Willow access, the Palo
Alto City Council will meet tonight in
â€ž another attempt to compromise on
plans for linking the road to El
Camino Real north of the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Two alternatives presented by
Council members John Berwald and
Richard Rosenbaum apparently failed
to generate support among opposing
factions of the council last week.
The center of the problem is a
grove of oak and eucalyptus trees
which stand in the path of the last few
hundred feet of a four-lane roadway
on the approach to El Camino. Debate
has centered on whether all four lanes
< should run through the grove or
whether two should be placed in the
shopping center's existing parking lot.
University officials have indicated
they may not accept the project if the
lanes are placed in the parking lot.
Latest Proposal.
The latest proposal before the
council, by Berwald, suggests that the
roadway be placed at least 70 feet
from the bank of the San Francisquito

Creek.
Rosenbaum introduced last week a
compromise alternative for the road to
run halfway through the trees and
then cutting on to the parking lot.
University officials indicated Friday
that they had begun working on some
alignment possibilities contained in the
Berwald proposal.
But the Berwald alternative, or even
the Rosenbaum compromise, has not
won the support of Council members
who oppose any clearing of trees in
the grove.
Opposition
Enid Pearson, one Council member
who has indicated she will fight
proposals which would violate the
grove, said, "I don't think the road is
necessary. This is just a prelude to a
Willow Expressway."
"I have just completed looking at
figures for the roadway," she
continued. "They estimate that
35,000 cars a month will be using it.
The next step will be an expressway."
Pearson added that she and Vice
Mayor Alan Henderson had gone over
the disputed area by foot and found
that the parking lot would be able to
accommodate the road with a
minimum loss of parking facilities.
"But the University does not want
the road in that area," she said. "They
have their eye on future expansion of


FOR DESIGN STUDY ONLY
UNIVERSITY'S FAVORITE This proposal calling for construction of the controversial four-lane Willow Road access to
El Camino Real running near the banks of the San Francisquito Creek is favored by University officials. Factions on the
Palo Alto City Council advocate saving the adjacent grove of trees and routing construction through the existing parking
lot at the Stanford Shopping Center.
the mall. That is what they want that
extra land for."
University Preference
The University strongly favors the
original proposal, a route close to the
creek bank, Robert R. Augsburger,
vice-president for business and finance,
said in a prepared statement. Stanford
officials claim that the route would
create a buffer between the road and
the center.
"If Willow Road were already in
place between Arboretum and El
Camino, and if Stanford were
proposing to build a shopping center,
good planning would dictate that the
center's frontage roads, parking lots,
access roads and buildings be well
removed from the roadway, and that
they be well buffered by trees,
shrubbery and ferns," Augsburger
pointed out.
