# Future Budget Cuts Feared
## Tuition Hikes May Exceed Inflation Rate 
### JOHN FREED 
Tuition increases ranging from one
to four percent above the rate of
inflation and budget trimmings of up
to $2 million per year loom in
Stanford's financial future, according
to the University's recently released
annual financial report.
In the report, Vice Provost William
Massy claimed that a yearly tuition
hike two percent greater than inflation
would keep constant that part of a

family's budget which flows to
Stanford.
"If this policy were implemented,"
Massy wrote, "Stanford's tuition
would increase significantly over time,
but would remain a constant fraction
of average family income. A two
percent real tuition growth
would... [be] leaving an overall
potential gap . . . [of] nearly *s2
million per year."
The report suggests that all or part
of the $2 million annual difference be
made up through budget reallocations,
in which new programs are financed at
the expense of deadweight or less
important programs.
Faculty Shift
"This would require shifting
between 15 and 30 faculty positions
among academic fields each year, and
an equivalent shift would have to take
place in the administrative and support
sectors of the budget," Massy
remarked, adding that, this becomes
"more difficult as the list of 'easy'
changes is exhausted."
Massy explained that the rate of
inflation is expected to slow down to
five or six percent a year by the end of
this decade. With a two percent tuition
growth policy, tuition would rise seven
to eight percent each year.
Another source of revenue for the
University comes from increased
reinvesting of endowment income.
According to Robert Augsburger, vice
president for business and finance, this
method will contribute greatly to the
University's current three-year $lO
million belt-tightening program.
Belt-Tightening
"This will account for about $1.5
million in the $lO million
belt-tightening program we're entering
now," Augsburger estimated. "One of
our problems in the past has been we

haven't been reinvesting enough of our
endowment income."
As part of the three-year plan,
Stanford may be forced to lay off
some of its workers, the San Jose
Mercury reported during winter break.
Augsburger commented that most
persons leaving will probably be
finding work elsewhere rather than
being fired.
"I think most of it will be done by
attrition rather than direct terminating
of contracts. I don't think we're far
enough along yet in analyzing
cutbacks to lay anyone off,"
Augsburger said.
Tax-Exempt Bonds
In yet another attempt to reduce
expenses, the University has won
approval from the California
Educational Facilities Authority to
issue nearly $l7 million in tax-exempt
bonds.
Revenue from the bonds will fund
about half of the $12.6 million cost of
hospital expansion, and will help
re-finalice other projects totaling more
than $lO million, including Escondido
IV housing and the central food
service building.
"We're expecting bids on the bonds
Tuesday morning," Augsburger
explained. "All the re-financing is
really to replace endowment which
had been financing these projects."
Issuing bonds should save the
University some $400,000 each year in
interest payments, and Augsburger
said the University may use the
method for future projects.

"In the future, we may use this
device to finance various
projects .. . such as the Florence
Moore additions," he noted.
The five-year $3OO million
Campaign for Stanford is "on
schedule" and "making satisfactory
progress" toward its goals, according
to Augsburger. Now past the half-way
mark, the Campaign has realized only
41 percent of its goal for physical
plant-improvement funds.
"The plant side has been the most
disappointing side of the Campaign
and the main component of that goal
is for the new library. We're
re-evaluating the entire program ... to
bring it down to a cost that's more
realistic and attainable," Augsburger
concluded.
