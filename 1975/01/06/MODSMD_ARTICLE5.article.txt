# Future Budget Cuts Feared
## Tuition Hikes May Exceed Inflation Rate 
### JOHN FREED 
Tuition increases ranging from one
to four percent above the rate of
inflation and budget trimmings of up
to $2 million per year loom in
Stanford's financial future, according
to the University's recently released
annual financial report.
In the report, Vice Provost William
Massy claimed that a yearly tuition
hike two percent greater than inflation
would keep constant that part of a

family's budget which flows to
Stanford.
"If this policy were implemented,"
Massy wrote, "Stanford's tuition
would increase significantly over time,
but would remain a constant fraction
of average family income. A two
percent real tuition growth
would... [be] leaving an overall
potential gap . . . [of] nearly *s2
million per year."
The report suggests that all or part
of the $2 million annual difference be
made up through budget reallocations,
in which new programs are financed at
the expense of deadweight or less
important programs.
Faculty Shift
"This would require shifting
between 15 and 30 faculty positions
among academic fields each year, and
an equivalent shift would have to take
place in the administrative and support
sectors of the budget," Massy
remarked, adding that, this becomes
"more difficult as the list of 'easy'
changes is exhausted."
Massy explained that the rate of
inflation is expected to slow down to
five or six percent a year by the end of
this decade. With a two percent tuition
growth policy, tuition would rise seven
to eight percent each year.
Another source of revenue for the
University comes from increased
reinvesting of endowment income.
According to Robert Augsburger, vice
president for business and finance, this
method will contribute greatly to the
University's current three-year $lO
million belt-tightening program.
Belt-Tightening
"This will account for about $1.5
million in the $lO million
belt-tightening program we're entering
now," Augsburger estimated. "One of
our problems in the past has been we

haven't been reinvesting enough of our
endowment income."
As part of the three-year plan,
Stanford may be forced to lay off
some of its workers, the San Jose
Mercury reported during winter break.
Augsburger commented that most
persons leaving will probably be
finding work elsewhere rather than
being fired.
"I think most of it will be done by
attrition rather than direct terminating
of contracts. I don't think we're far
enough along yet in analyzing
cutbacks to lay anyone off,"
Augsburger said.
Tax-Exempt Bonds
In yet another attempt to reduce
expenses, the University has won
approval from the California
Educational Facilities Authority to
issue nearly $l7 million in tax-exempt
