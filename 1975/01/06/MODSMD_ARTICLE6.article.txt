The Board of Trustees Dec. 10
approved an increase in general tuition
from $3375 to $3BlO, beginning next
fall quarter.

About 55 percent of the
undergraduates here currently receive
financial aid.

will give larger amounts of financial
aid to incoming freshmen under new
national guidelines from the College
Scholarship Service (CSS).
CSS last year revised its schedules
for the amount parents must
contribute to their child's tuition
costs, adding an estimated $8 million
to student financial need nationally.
Sophomores, juniors and seniors
here during 1975-76 will receive loans
and jobs, not larger scholarships,

the University will be able to use
scholarship funds to meet the
increased need resulting from the new
CSS formulas for sophomores, juniors
and seniors, it is expected that these
students will have greater access to
subsidized loans and job
opportunities," he said.
