# Trustees OK $435 Jump In Tuition
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Board of Trustees Dec. 10
approved an increase in general tuition
from $3375 to $3BlO, beginning next
fall quarter.
The 12.9 percent hike, the largest
in University history, anticipates a 9
percent inflation rate next year,
according to University officials.
Most major universities across the
nation have indicated tuition increases
of nearly 10 percent, however most
have not finalized the figure. Other
California private colleges, including
Pepperdine University, have suggested
10 percent hikes, but none has settled
on a figure as high as Stanford's.
Grants and scholarships for
undergraduates here will pass the $8
million level during the 1975-76 year,
and the University plans an additional
$2 million available in campus jobs
and loans.
About 55 percent of the
undergraduates here currently receive
financial aid.
More Financial Aid
Beginning next year, the University
will give larger amounts of financial
aid to incoming freshmen under new
national guidelines from the College
Scholarship Service (CSS).
CSS last year revised its schedules
for the amount parents must
contribute to their child's tuition
costs, adding an estimated $8 million
to student financial need nationally.
Sophomores, juniors and seniors
here during 1975-76 will receive loans
and jobs, not larger scholarships,
however, Financial Aids Director
Robert Huff said.
"While it cannot be expected that
the University will be able to use
scholarship funds to meet the
increased need resulting from the new
CSS formulas for sophomores, juniors
and seniors, it is expected that these
students will have greater access to
subsidized loans and job
opportunities," he said.
"In individual cases, where this
might produce unreasonable
indebtedness or require excessive work
during the schpol year, it is expected
that some additional scholarship help
will be made available, however," Huff
added.
The $3BlO tuition figure surfaced
in a proposal to the Trustees from a
top-level University staff committee in
November.
The proposal, drafted by the staffs
of Provost William Miller and Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger, stated that tuition
rates had not kept pace with
University costs.
Tuition accounts for about half the
University's operating budget income.
The Trustees approved a 7.6
percent tuition hike in December
1973 for the present 1974-75 year
based on a 5 percent inflation rate.

But inflation probably will exceed the
5 percent mark, and University
officials now predict a deficit of $1.6
million for the current academic year.
An ASSU Senate Select Committee
recommended in November that the
Trustees reconsider the University';
proposed $435 increase for 1975-76
because the hike was "too large an
increase."
In its report to the Trustees, the
committee proposed that the hike
correspond to but not exceed the rise
in the consumer price index or in the
amount of disposable income.
ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott, who
chaired the committee, commented
yesterday that he "felt the report was
useful" and that there would be
"further student involvement" in
tuition matters. The report was well
received by the Trustees, McDermott
added.
