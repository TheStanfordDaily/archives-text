## editorial On Rosenzweig 
### 
For better or for worse, federal, state and local
government agencies are playing an increasingly important
role in determining the future of the University. Dealing
with those agencies has been the principal function of the
University Relations Office, ably directed until last
summer by Frank Newman, now President of the University
of Rhode Island.
In searching for a replacement for Newman, President
Lyman determined that "it was necessary to give a clear
indication to™*outside bodies that the University takes
seriously the role of the office charged with the
responsibility for dealing with them."
As a result, Lyman created the Vice Presidency for Public
Affairs. The fact that there are only four other University
vice presidents made Lyman's message to governmental
agencies especially clear.
And Lyman's selection of Robert Rosenzweig to fill the
new position couldn't have been more appropriate.
Rosenzweig is a young, bright, personable administrator who
has served the University with distinction, working closely
with Lyman since the latter became provost in 1967.
Rosenzweig brings a good deal of experience into the new
job. Shortly after receiving his Ph.D. from Vale, he served
for four years on the staff of the U.S. Office of Education.
He was special assistant to the U.S. Commissioner of
Education for one of those years.
We welcome Rosenzweig's appointment. We also welcome
the University's decision to do away with his previous
position as vice provost. It seems the Administration is,
indeed, serious about economy measures.
