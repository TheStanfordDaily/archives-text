# The

### Merritt Ruhlen 
Can Robert Smith really be so
naive as to believe that "all
Palestinians in refugee camps left
Israel voluntarily" (Daily, Nov.
25)? I know of no case in the
history of mankind where a
people have "voluntarily" left
their homes, their land and their
country to settle in refugee
camps, and anyone with even a
rudimentary knowledge of the
Middle East knows that historical
reality bears no resemblance to
Smith's fairy tale.
While there was no single cause
for the flight of over 500,000
Palestinian Arabs from Israel in
1948, a major contributing factor
was terrorism against the civilian
population.
On the night of April 9, 1948,
the Jewish terrorist organization,
Irgun, slaughtered all 254 men,
women, and children in the Arab
town of Dir Yassin. The head of
the Irgun, Menachem Begin, later
bragged that the Dir Yassin
massacre had been instrumental in
"persuading" other Arabs that
they were not welcome in Israel:
"All the Jewish forces proceeded
to advance through Haifa like a
knife through butter.
The Arabs began fleeing in
panic, shouting Dir Yassin!"
(Maxime Rodinson, Israel, A
Colonial-Settler State?, p. 115) Is
it not hypocritical for Israelis to
condemn Palestinian terrorists
today when the state of Israel
itself was founded on just such
acts of terrorism?
No Inherent Right
Smith also argues that because
Jews lived in Palestine in 135 A.D.
they have an inherent right to
return, and to expel the Arabs
who have inhabited Palestine
continuously for the last 2000
years. Does Smith's largesse
extend equally to all peoples of

the world, or is it a special
privelege reserved for Jews? Does
Smith also intend to let the Native
Americans return to the lands
they inhabited in 135 A.D., that
is, all of North and South
America?
If Israel is not the imperialistic
creation of Europeans, then how
does Smith explain the increase in
the Jewish population of Palestine
from 24,000 in 1880 to over three
million today? Where does Smith
think all these people came from?
Can it be that Smith is unaware
that Israel is today nothing more
than an economic satellite of the
United States? Were we to
withdraw our financiial and
military support, Israel would
cease to be a viable political
entity.
Contrary to Smith's assertion,
the PLO does not demand the
expulsion of Jews from a secular
democratic state. As recently as
December the chief PLO
spokesman at the U.N., Shafik al
Hout, explicitly stated on
American television that not one
Jew would be expelled from
Palestine, if the Palestinian Arabs
are allowed to return to their
homes.
Many Americans believe that
the Middle East is not our
problem, and that we are basically
powerless to bring about a Middle
East settlement. Such a belief
ignores the fact that the Israeli
oppression of the Palestinian
Arabs continues only because we
Americans are willing to finance it
with our tax dollars. Will there
ever come a day when the wealth
of the United States is used to
save the starving rather than
oppress the living?
