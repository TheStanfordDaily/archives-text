The Dan Fogelbergcult.
It's small, but it includes most of the
top-notch musicians in L.A.
Either Dan has played on some of the
recent recordings of those musicians, or
they've played on Dan's new album,
"Souvenirs."
Since arriving in Los Angeles from his
home town of Peoria, Dan has been flying
up the ranks of singer/songwriters.
His guitar playing (among many other
instruments) has fused with his voice
and pen and a highly regarded talent was
formed.
Then his L.A. cult came to play on his
album and Dan came entirely into his
own, with the production of Joe Walsh.
The album is"Souvenirs"
The cult is now you.
