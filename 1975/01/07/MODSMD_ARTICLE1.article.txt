| Edmund G. Brown Jr. became
(California's 34th governor yesterday
with promises to Jjold down state
taxes and to "put CaJifornians back to
work" with government subsidized
jobs.
He asked the state legislature
long the target of his political attacks
to help him win back the confidence
of the people in government and to
help him nurse the state's ailing
economy back to good health.
Brown said he will cut spending in
his own office by seven percent as a
symbol of government austerity.
iHe told city officials later in the
day to expect cuts in state dollars as
government on all levels must tighten
\. its belt. (
Taxes, Unemployment
"Avoiding a general tax increase
; will not be easy," Brown said. "Rising
> unemployment means reduced state
revenues as well as escalating
expenditures for health and welfare.
I "But lam determined to see this
year through without asking the
people for further sacrifice in the form
of new taxes," Brown said in his
inaugural address.
The 36-year-old Democrat took the
oath of office in the packed state
Assembly chambers yesterday before a
joint session of the Senate and
Assembly, a statewide television
audience and his father, former Gov.
Edmund G. Brown.
Outlines Program
In a brief eight-minute televised
inaugural address, Brown outlined a
legislative program consisting largely
of items vetoed or opposed by former
Gov. Ronald Reagan.
His proposals included repeal of the
oil depletion allowance,
unemployment insurance for farm
workers, secret ballots for farm labor
1 elections and repeal of favored
treatment for business taxes.
For working mothers, Brown
promised to support expansion of
child care center programs.
Executive Order
He ordered all state agencies to seek
federal funds for public service jobs
and predicted later in the day that
12,500 such jobs could be created.for
California's unemployed. His first
executive order, issued two hours
later, called for immediate action on
1500 jobs.
Brown's address was praised by
Democrats as honest and practical.
Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy
(D-San Francisco) said, "I don't know
anything he mentioned that we cannot
get the votes in the Assembly to pass."
Most Republican leaders were
cautiously positive.
"I was extremely pleased by his
comment on no tax increase," said
Sen. Dennis Carpenter of Newport
Beach, GOP caucus chairman in the
upper house.
'Shades Of Reagan'
"His speech even had shades of
Ronald Reagan," Assembly

Republican leader Bob Beverly of
Manhattan Beach said approvingly.
All Republicans weren't satisfied,
of course.
Sen. H.L. Richardsoft, defeated by
Alan Cranston in the U.S. Senate race
Nov. 5, said he didn't see how Brown
could beef up the state's employment
picture and cut back on expenditures,
at the same time.
But former Gov. Brown said his
son's address "was a no-nonsense
speech. It was in tune with the times."
The inaugural was one of several
short speeches Brown gave yesterday.
In San Francisco, Brown told local
government officials that they will
have to learn to get by with fewer
state dollars.
