# New Year Offers Ambiguous Treats
## 
### Stephen Carter 
The New Year has begun, as it does
annually at about this time, but it doesn't
seem to have brought a lot of reason for good
cheer.
On the one hand, we can be confident
that there is greater honesty in government
than at this time last year. Why, just last
week the White. House admitted that the
nation is in a recession, and that
unemployment "might well" reach eight
percent. It's hard to get much more honest
than that.
Perhaps the White House, now spoken for
by Ron Nessen, late of NBC news, has
decided to take over the news media's
traditional role as the prophet of doom. This
seems a reasonable New Year's resolution;
perhaps those people who formerly got their
jollies by claiming that the news media drove
Dick Nixon from office can now set their
sights on the White House, which, they can
argue, is talking us into a depression.
Obfuscation
While Jerry obfuscates us into economic
confusion, his Sidekick, Henry the K, is being
much more straightforward or rather, he
was. Just at the turn of the New Year,
Kissinger revealed that the United States
might be willing to use military force to work
its will on the Middle East oil shiekdoms.
Now this was a resolution with a
difference it forced the White House to
abandon its resolution for honesty. The
Secretary of State's comment, Nessen
explained, was "a hypothetical answer" to "a
hypothetical question." The previous Ron,
Ziegler, couldn't have done a better job
himself.
The President stepped in, and the

White House modified its initial
announcement. Kissinger's comments, Nessen
corrected, reflected the President's own. Was
the former statement inoperative?
But while the U.S. is following its policy
of "we can threaten them, but they can't
threaten us," there is at least one man in
Washington who, unlike last year, can't
threaten anybody. That man is Wilbur Mills.
Dry and Powerless
Mills' New Year's resolution, to conquer
alcoholism, is an admirable one. It stems
from what the New York Times so aptly
referred to as "the spectacular collapse of
Rep. Mills' career." But Mills' other
resolution is not one of his own making. That
one is to give up the position, which some
newspaper invented, and the rest picked up,
as "the second most powerful man in
Washington." Wilbur Mills, just another
congressman? That is a new year.
The one-time Godfather, Marlon Brando,
has made a New Year's resolution, and just in
time, too. In his continuing fight for Native
American rights, he has given the Native
American community his Southern California
property,which has a $318,000 mortgage, and
plans to give them some other property,
which, unfortunately, is half owned by his
sister. But his heart, one can assume, is in the
right place.
From charity to chess, there is Bobby
Fischer, World Champion of chess, whose
resolution appears to be never to play chess
again. He is scheduled to defend his world
title later this year against Soviet challenger
Anatoly Karpov, who, as Bobby once did,
fought his way through Interzonal
tournaments and elimination matches to

become the challenger.
When Bobby was challenger, he protested
the match rules, which gave the champion an
advantage. This year, the International Chess
Federation (FIDE) finally adopted rules
which eliminate that advantage but Bobby
doesn't like them, and refuses to play. What
FIDE has overlooked, of course, is that
Bobby owns the bat and the ball.
Speaking of bats and balls, Charles Finley
has a New Year's resolution: to prove, for
once and for all, that a "baseball owner"
owns his players as well as his team, and that
a little thing like a breach of contract on the
owner's part shouldn't alter that neat and
convenient relationship.
While Charley O. tries in vain to catch
catfish, Charlie Goodell is after bigger game.
He hopes to round up all Vietnam Era draft
evaders, have them admit their terrible deeds
and swear never again to be so treasonous,
put them to work for two years, and thus
pronounce them reformed citizens.
The main problem with his resolution is
that so far, only four percent or so of those
eligible have actually applied for this
"clemency." But Charlie has an explanation
the other 96 percent, he says, simply are
uninformed!
Well, New Years come and go reliable
sources, in fact, claim there are no plans to
cancel the next one. And not everything is
quite so depressing why, just last week
Charlie Chaplin was knighted, and do you
know, Joe McCarthy didn't say a word!

doesn't like them, and refuses to play. What
FIDE has overlooked, of course, is that
Bobby owns the bat and the ball.
Speaking of bats and balls, Charles Finley
has a New Year's resolution: to prove, for
once and for all, that a "baseball owner"
owns his players as well as his team, and that
a little thing like a breach of contract on the
owner's part shouldn't alter that neat and
convenient relationship.
While Charley O. tries in vain to catch
catfish, Charlie Goodell is after bigger game.
He hopes to round up all Vietnam Era draft
evaders, have them admit their terrible deeds
and swear never again to be so treasonous,
put them to work for two years, and thus
pronounce them reformed citizens.
The main problem with his resolution is
that so far, only four percent or so of those
eligible have actually applied for this
"clemency." But Charlie has an explanation
the other 96 percent, he says, simply are
uninformed!
Well, New Years come and go reliable
sources, in fact, claim there are no plans to
cancel the next one. And not everything is
quite so depressing why, just last week
Charlie Chaplin was knighted, and do you
know, Joe McCarthy didn't say a word!

The New Year has begun, as it does
annually at about this time, but it doesn't
seem to have brought a lot of reason for good
cheer.
On the one hand, we can be confident
that there is greater honesty in government
than at this time last year. Why, just last
week the White. House admitted that the
nation is in a recession, and that
unemployment "might well" reach eight
percent. It's hard to get much more honest
than that.
Perhaps the White House, now spoken for
by Ron Nessen, late of NBC news, has
decided to take over the news media's
traditional role as the prophet of doom. This
seems a reasonable New Year's resolution;
perhaps those people who formerly got their
jollies by claiming that the news media drove
Dick Nixon from office can now set their
sights on the White House, which, they can
argue, is talking us into a depression.
Obfuscation
While Jerry obfuscates us into economic
confusion, his Sidekick, Henry the K, is being
much more straightforward or rather, he
was. Just at the turn of the New Year,
Kissinger revealed that the United States
might be willing to use military force to work
its will on the Middle East oil shiekdoms.
Now this was a resolution with a
difference it forced the White House to
abandon its resolution for honesty. The
Secretary of State's comment, Nessen
explained, was "a hypothetical answer" to "a
hypothetical question." The previous Ron,
Ziegler, couldn't have done a better job
himself.
The President stepped in, and the

White House modified its initial
announcement. Kissinger's comments, Nessen
corrected, reflected the President's own. Was
the former statement inoperative?
But while the U.S. is following its policy
of "we can threaten them, but they can't
threaten us," there is at least one man in
Washington who, unlike last year, can't
threaten anybody. That man is Wilbur Mills.
Dry and Powerless
Mills' New Year's resolution, to conquer
alcoholism, is an admirable one. It stems
from what the New York Times so aptly
referred to as "the spectacular collapse of
Rep. Mills' career." But Mills' other
resolution is not one of his own making. That
one is to give up the position, which some
newspaper invented, and the rest picked up,
as "the second most powerful man in
Washington." Wilbur Mills, just another
congressman? That is a new year.
The one-time Godfather, Marlon Brando,
has made a New Year's resolution, and just in
time, too. In his continuing fight for Native
American rights, he has given the Native
American community his Southern California
property,which has a $318,000 mortgage, and
plans to give them some other property,
which, unfortunately, is half owned by his
sister. But his heart, one can assume, is in the
right place.
From charity to chess, there is Bobby
Fischer, World Champion of chess, whose
resolution appears to be never to play chess
again. He is scheduled to defend his world
title later this year against Soviet challenger
Anatoly Karpov, who, as Bobby once did,
fought his way through Interzonal
tournaments and elimination matches to

become the challenger.
When Bobby was challenger, he protested
the match rules, which gave the champion an
advantage. This year, the International Chess
Federation (FIDE) finally adopted rules
which eliminate that advantage but Bobby
doesn't like them, and refuses to play. What

alcoholism, is an admirable one. It stems
from what the New York Times so aptly
referred to as "the spectacular collapse of
Rep. Mills' career." But Mills' other
resolution is not one of his own making. That
one is to give up the position, which some
newspaper invented, and the rest picked up,
as "the second most powerful man in
Washington." Wilbur Mills, just another
congressman? That is a new year.
The one-time Godfather, Marlon Brando,
has made a New Year's resolution, and just in
time, too. In his continuing fight for Native
American rights, he has given the Native
American community his Southern California
property,which has a $318,000 mortgage, and
plans to give them some other property,
which, unfortunately, is half owned by his
sister. But his heart, one can assume, is in the
right place.
From charity to chess, there is Bobby
Fischer, World Champion of chess, whose
resolution appears to be never to play chess
again. He is scheduled to defend his world
title later this year against Soviet challenger
Anatoly Karpov, who, as Bobby once did,
fought his way through Interzonal
tournaments and elimination matches to

become the challenger.
When Bobby was challenger, he protested
the match rules, which gave the champion an
advantage. This year, the International Chess
Federation (FIDE) finally adopted rules
which eliminate that advantage but Bobby
doesn't like them, and refuses to play. What
FIDE has overlooked, of course, is that
Bobby owns the bat and the ball.
Speaking of bats and balls, Charles Finley
has a New Year's resolution: to prove, for
once and for all, that a "baseball owner"
owns his players as well as his team, and that
a little thing like a breach of contract on the
owner's part shouldn't alter that neat and
convenient relationship.
While Charley O. tries in vain to catch
catfish, Charlie Goodell is after bigger game.
He hopes to round up all Vietnam Era draft
evaders, have them admit their terrible deeds
and swear never again to be so treasonous,
put them to work for two years, and thus
pronounce them reformed citizens.
The main problem with his resolution is
that so far, only four percent or so of those
eligible have actually applied for this
"clemency." But Charlie has an explanation
the other 96 percent, he says, simply are
uninformed!
Well, New Years come and go reliable
sources, in fact, claim there are no plans to
cancel the next one. And not everything is
quite so depressing why, just last week
Charlie Chaplin was knighted, and do you
know, Joe McCarthy didn't say a word!
