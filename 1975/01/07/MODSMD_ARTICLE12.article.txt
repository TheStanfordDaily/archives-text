# Sword Rattling Is Dangerous Game

Some months ago, Defense
Secretary James Schlesinger made
a highly irresponsible statement
regarding Arab oil policy. As the
Arab oil boycott came to a close,
Schlesinger declared that if the
Arab states continued their
"blackmail" tactics towards the
Western nations, the United States
might be induced to seize the
Arab oil fields by force.
Since Schlesinger's remark, the
possibility of a U.S. seizure of
Middle Eastern oil fields has
become widely discussed by
individuals of prominence and
supposed intellect. One noted
columnist actually drew up a
balance sheet on the possible
benefits and risks of such an
action. I spoke with several
American oil executives this
summer who would not rule out
the possibility if the oil problem
became extremely acute.
Now Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger has gained some
notoriety in attempting to make a
causus belli out of a hypothetical
Arab oil policy which "strangles"
the West economically.
Access To Oil Essential
The reasoning which runs
behind this policy alternative runs
as follows. The Western countries,
finding domestic oil production
insufficient for their national
needs, see continued access to
inexpensive Arab oil as essential
to the salubrious functioning of
their industrial societies. Without
an abundant supply of this cheap
vital fuel, a sharp economic
decline considerably more
pungent than the present
downward spiral could be
anticipated. Under these
circumstances, any Arab policy
which severly restricted oil
exports, or imposed prohibitive
price on oil, would threaten the
well-being of the Western

industrial states. This would then
justify Western expropriation of
Arab oil fields.
This type of thinking is not
atypical of the hubris of much of
American foreign policy
decision-making. In its barest
form it says that the United States
has an undeniable right to another
nation's resource if that resource
is deemed crucial to the economy.
Neo-Jingoism
This philosophy supercedes all
considerations of international
law, and such idealjzed principles
as national sovereignty and
self-determination. The same
jingoistic train of thought
motivated such contemporary
international tragedies as
Germany's aggressions during
World War II and Soviet
interventions in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia in 1956 and 1968,
respectively.
It would no doubt be claimed
if such an American intervention
were to take place that it would
be done in the name of national
survival. For the moment this
argument would carry little
substance. While the Arab oil
boycott of late 1973 and early
1974 has contributed to the
malaise of the American
economy, it has not been treated
as the major cause of the current
stagflation by any economist.
The situation could change in
the near future, however, as the
nation becomes more and more
dependent on oil imports for its
energy needs. The U.S. is
presently over 30. percent
dependent on oil imports and
despite Project Independence
initiatives (e.g. oil, import tariffs),
the United States is losing ground
in its effort to attain
"self-sufficiency.
Thus the pressure upon the
policy-makers to secure this

resource for America's use may
increase in the future. Even
without the explicit threat of an
oil embargo the United States
may feel too vulnerable to the
policies of Arab states. America
might then decide to intervene
without provocation.
Aside from any moral or legal
objections to ah American tour de
force in the Middle East, such a
manoevre might be unwise on
purely practical grounds. The
Soviet Union could not possibly
turn the other cheek to such a

blatantly "imperialistic" act.
This policy could precipitate a
direct military confrontation
between the two superpowers. It
has been the keystone of postwar
American foreign policy to avoid
such a confrontation. It would
seem that the United States and
her Western allies could meet this
energy crisis more intelligently
and innovatively than to threaten
the world with war.
