Most Stanford students are
well aware of the housing
shortage. There are several
proposals to deal with the
problem; constructing several
Row Houses, adding more spaces
to Florence Moore, building a new
dorm complex. However, they all
involve exorbitant construction
costs undesirable in these
inflationary times.
We have a plan that could add
one thousand spaces at a much
lower cost. In this era of the 747
jumbo jet the days of ocean-going
luxury liners seem as dated as
$5OO tuition. Many steamship
lines have gone bankrupt and their
proud liners destined to rot in the
dreary bowels of a mothball yard.
Meanwhile, an entire generation is
deprived of their splendor.
Our plan entails buying a
mothballed steamship and putting
it in Lake Lagunita. Not only
would this alleviate the shortage
by providing quality housing, but
other benefits would accrue.

Luxurious lounges would be the
focus of informal get-togethers.
Parties could be held in the Grand
Ballroom or the Sun Deck.
Shuffleboard would become
another hotly contested
intramural sport. The ship's bar
would be a popular hangout.
Kitchen and dining facilities
would rival the finest restaurant's.
Hashers would gain useful
experience as waiters, stewards,
and cabin boys. R.A.'s would get
First Class staterooms, and
Faculty residents the Presidential
suite.
Luxurious? Of Course!! But it
is well-within our financial
resources. Stanford would reassert
its â–  leadership in residential
education. The S.S. A.S.S.U.
would become another landmark
on the Farm. It would rival
Lambda Nu in the Draw for top
popularity.
