# Beware!

Undeterred by the fiasco of the
recent U.S.-Soviet grain deal, and
doubtless lured on by visions of
vending machines in Red Square
and hamburger stands along the
Great Wall of China, some of our
most prominent companies have
been falling all over each other in
their rush to put American
products and know-how into the
hands of those totalitarian
superpowers which detente or
no remain firmly committed to
our ultimate destruction.
Fortunately, not all U.S.
companies have acted in this
manner. A great many have
refused to sell equipment and
know-how to the communists,
recognizing that such sales would
be contrary to the national
interest. But there is the problem
of a foolish, eager minority of
sellers.
It is probably useless to
criticize such practices on moral
grounds particularly when our
government is subsidizing many of
these initiatives with our tax
dollars in the name of "expanding
trade relations with the East."
The grain fiasco affords an
excellent case in point, and a
recent article from the pages of
the Christian Science Monitor
offers another. According to this
particular article, two Australian
companies (at the close of a trade
fair they had held in Peking) gave
the Red Chinese $330,000 worth
of livestock as a gesture of
good-will and were promptly
slapped with a bill for $15,000.
The Monitor report concluded
by citing the grim assessment of
yet another Western trade envoy:
"The Chinese will buy only what
they cannot make for themselves
and only for as long as it takes
them to learn our techniques and
copy them."
Let us hope that those who
want to sell to the communists
will take notice of this bit of
information. That way they will
at least be forwarned when they
attempt to bargain with the Red
wheeler-dealers.
