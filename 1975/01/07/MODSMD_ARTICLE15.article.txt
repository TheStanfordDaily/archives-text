# Justice?

### Chris Gray 
On April 22, 1972 three of the
more than 200 Stanford students
who were arrested during the
march on El Camino were charged
with one or more felony counts of
assault with a deadly weapon on a
Police Officer (rock throwing). I
was one of those students.
After several months, several
hearings and $BOO the charges
against me were finally dropped. I
read arrest records that contained
outright lies about my behavior
during my arrest, I saw a Santa
Clara public relations officer lie
on the stand and I saw the judge
encourage him.
I was (and am) profoundly
disillusioned. It was only because
of my lawyer's skill in discrediting
the public relations officer and
the fact that I passed a lie
detector test at my own expense
that the charges were dropped.
One of the other accused felons
went through a similar process
while most of the other students
arrested pleaded guilty to jay
walking and received five dollar
fines.
But Paul Stutz, a senior in
mathmatics, was not so fortunate.
No one but Stutz or the police
really know whether or not he
was guilty. Judging from my own
case and the fact that the local
district attorney was under a lot
of pressure to get at least one
heavy conviction out of the mass
bust I feel that it is very likely
that the police did frame Stutz
just as they tried to frame me.
Under a great deal of pressure
Stutz pleaded guilty to one count
of assault with a deadly weapon
(throwing one rock). His sentence
was six months to life. That
sentence was suspended and he
was put on probation for four
years. This included a year's term
in the county honor camp at
Elmwood. After eight months at
Elmwood Stutz was released for
his good behavior. This month he
finally got off parole.
On May 7, 1972 a Daily
reporter saw Stanford Security
Officer Kenneth Pasquinucci,
badge number 25, throw at least
one rock at students gathered near
Meyer Library during night-time
demonstrations against the war in
Vietnam.
An investigation by Chief
Marvin L. Herrington (still Chief
today), confirmed the charge and
two months later (July 7) it was
announced that Pasquinucci had
been suspended from the force for
two days. He still works at
Stanford as a Security Officer.
This is the meaning of justice
at Stanford.
This is the meaning of justice
in America.

On May 7, 1972 a Daily
reporter saw Stanford Security
Officer Kenneth Pasquinucci,
badge number 25, throw at least
one rock at students gathered near
Meyer Library during night-time
demonstrations against the war in
Vietnam.
An investigation by Chief
Marvin L. Herrington (still Chief
today), confirmed the charge and
two months later (July 7) it was
announced that Pasquinucci had
been suspended from the force for
two days. He still works at
Stanford as a Security Officer.
This is the meaning of justice
at Stanford.
This is the meaning of justice
in America.

On April 22, 1972 three of the
more than 200 Stanford students
who were arrested during the
march on El Camino were charged
with one or more felony counts of
assault with a deadly weapon on a
Police Officer (rock throwing). I
was one of those students.
After several months, several
hearings and $BOO the charges
against me were finally dropped. I
read arrest records that contained
outright lies about my behavior
during my arrest, I saw a Santa
Clara public relations officer lie
on the stand and I saw the judge
encourage him.
I was (and am) profoundly
disillusioned. It was only because
of my lawyer's skill in discrediting
the public relations officer and
the fact that I passed a lie
detector test at my own expense
that the charges were dropped.
One of the other accused felons
went through a similar process
while most of the other students
arrested pleaded guilty to jay
walking and received five dollar
fines.
But Paul Stutz, a senior in
mathmatics, was not so fortunate.
No one but Stutz or the police
really know whether or not he
was guilty. Judging from my own
case and the fact that the local
district attorney was under a lot
of pressure to get at least one
heavy conviction out of the mass
bust I feel that it is very likely
that the police did frame Stutz
just as they tried to frame me.
Under a great deal of pressure
Stutz pleaded guilty to one count
of assault with a deadly weapon
(throwing one rock). His sentence
was six months to life. That
sentence was suspended and he
was put on probation for four
years. This included a year's term
in the county honor camp at
Elmwood. After eight months at
Elmwood Stutz was released for
his good behavior. This month he
finally got off parole.
