## Hubert Marshall—A 'Reasonable Man' Admired By Liberals And Conservatives 
### PATTY FELS 
Hubert Marshall likes to garden and
read the Palo Alto Times, according to
some of his friends.
Hearing this, you might assume that
he was a boring professor who teaches
boding classes. You would be wrong.
"The law talks about the reasonable
man," said Professor Robert Horn, a
colleague of Marshall's. "Well, it would
be hard to find a better example than
Hugh Marshall."
It is probably Marshall's
reasonableness that makes him so
interesting and so well-liked. His
friends span the political spectrum and
all of them radical or conservative
praise his open-mindedness.
"He and I are poles apart
policy-wise," said Horn, a well-known
conservative. "But that has never come
between our friendship."
Those on the other end, notably
political science graduate students, say
Marshall is "sympathetic, someone
who's worth talking to, someone
who's potentially an ally."
Activist And Critic
Marshall calls himself a liberal and a
pacifist. A conscientious objector in

World War 11, he picketed President
Lyndon Johnson in 1965, supported
McGovern is early 1971 and last year
stood outside the Placement Center to
protest military recruiting there.
Now Marshall is a harsh critic of
President Ford, calling him "either a
liar or one of the most stupid men in
America."
For many of his Political Science 1
students, Marshall's attitudes would
probably come as a surprise. The man
who lectures to them three times a
week looks more like a retired
postman than a protester.
His pants hang in sharp creases,
barely brushing the tops of his laced,
dark brown shoes; his ties are rarely
wider than an inch; and all his shirts
have button-down collars. He always
wears a coat-and-tie to class, usually a
tweedy jacket with narrow lapels.
"He dresses in a grayish wool way,"
said one freshman.
Teaching Politics
Marshall's dissatisfaction with the 1
system permeates his Political Science
I lectures, but they are restrained,
methodical and well-organized. "I
don't think that it's possible to teach

political science in a non-political
way," he said.
Thus, in a lecture he discussed
"paranoid aspects of Richard Nixon's
personality," but then added "I
did not say he is paranoid; put that in
your notes."
In a Daily column, he was more
blunt:
"Watergate' involves people who
wrap themselves in the flag while
attempting to destroy the
Constitution."
Marshall has taught Poli Sci I for 21
years voluntarily. "Our department
is run by pure anarchy; no one tells
you what to teach," he says. "Poli Sci
I is the most fun thing that I do."
Basic Questions
The course is basic, but not
elementary, he says. "There are times
when I give students in Poli Sci I the
same questions that I would give Ph.D.
candidates on an exam.
"This will kill them if it gets into
the Daily," he added with a smile.
The ASSU Course Review described
his Poli Sci I as "exceptionally good."
"It's what everyone thinks they'll be
taking when they come to Stanford to
take political science," said a senior.
"It's the stuff that makes you
interested in poli sci; it's the stuff that
makes you think you want to be a poli
sci major."
Many do decide to major in
political science after taking Marshall's
course and are then bitterly
disappointed in the rest of the political
science department.
One political science major
recalled: "The TA in my discussion
section said, 'Don't be misled by this
class. It's probably more political and
more interesting than most anything
else in the department.' I didn't really
believe it at the time but it turned out
to be very true."
"In some ways I'm more political
than other poli sci professors,"
Marshall said. "Some see the domains
of politics and economics as very
different. You could study economics
with them without even knowing that
the government exists. I'm interested
in reality in government."
This interest in reality is nothing
new for Marshall. He graduated from
Antioch, a college where students take
five years to get a B.A. that extra
year is spent working in the
community.
Practical Orientation
A biology major, Marshall worked
for the U.S. Forest Service at the camp

for conscientious objectors. Then, at
the end of the war, he decided that he
was more interested in political
science.
"When I came back after four
years, I just was unable to sustain the
kind of interest in biology that I
needed to become a professional
biologist," he said. He went on to get
his doctorate in political science from
the University of North Carolina, and
taught for two years at the University
of Florida.
Then, in 1952, Marshall worked for
the Department of the Interior on
policy and program coordination. He
came to Stanford in 1953, the same
as Horn, who taught Political
Science I one quarter while Marshall
was on leave.
In those days, according to Horn,
Marshall left foreign policy out of this
class. "I did say to him one day, 'Well,
Hugh, this is Political Science I. How
can we leave out foreign policy?' "
Horn recalls.

"He [Marshall] said, 'I know, I
know it's important. But I just find it
so offensive that I can't bring myself
to put it in,' " said Horn, shaking his
head in amusement.
Both Marshall and Horn have done
relatively little research. "I'm more of
a teacher than a researcher," Marshall
says flatly.
His students gratefully agree. "He's
genuinely concerned with students,"
said a sophomore. "When I ask him
questions after class he does more than
just explain. He's looking at me. He
wants to know I understand."
Students find his lectures both
timely and amusing. They are
peppered with anecdotes and
underplayed humor.
Sublte Humor
Discussing the bomb shelters of the
early 60s, Marshall noted that they
were more prevalent in southern
California, "where people are more
paranoid than other places." At
Stanford, there were several
well-supplied shelters on campus:
"They all had large amounts of
crackers and water," said Marshall
with a sigh. "The idea was that we
would all sit around for days, weeks,
months, eating crackers, I guess."
In another lecture, Marshall recited
the Boy Scout laws in one breath and
from memory. He was loudly
applauded.
Talking about a bomb which
exploded in the Harvard Center for
International Affairs, Marshall

observed:
"There's not an awful lot to be
gained from bombing Harvard .. .
probably."
Coherent Comments
Even after 21 years of lecturing to
critical students, Marshall still is
nervous in the limelight, according to a
Daily reporter:
"Whenever I call Marshall for
comment on some news story, he
always starts talking, and then he says
right away, 'Wait a second, wait a
second. Let me just think off the top
of my head and then you can put it in
good language.'
"And I always go ahead and write
down exactly what he says. Then at
the end he says, 'Now, can you put
that in coherent form?' I always read
it back to him exactly as he said it,
and he always says, 'Yes, that's
perfect, that's perfect. You're very
good at it.' "
Marshall's opinions are frequently
solicited by others too.
"He's always very balanced and
very objective," said Horn. "He's one
of the first persons I would turn to in
the department."
'Amused Tolerance'
It is probably this objectivity that
gives Marshall what one student called
an "amused tolerance for life."
Marshall spent one year as head of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
and loved it.

"It was a ghastly year for work I
didn't get anything done," Marshall
recalls. "But some of the arguments
between Harvey Hukari [a staunch
conservative] and Yale Braunstein [a
vocal radical] were delightful.
Occasionally, to their own great
dismay, they'd be on the same side."
Marshall remembers now-fired
English Prof. Bruce Franklin and
his wife Jane in much the same way.
One time, he talked to Jane Franklin
after a debate on Vietnam. "I didn't
agree with her position, but in that
debate our differences hadn't really
come out," said Marshall.
"As she walked away, she said
'Power to the People! Death to the
Fascist Pigs!' ... I was just speechless.
A phrase like 'Death to the Fascist
Pigs' leaves me very ill at ease since I
probably am one of what she considers
the fascist pigs."
Reasonableness
Most of his friends would disagree.
"Hugh's always right there
championing the cause of those he
feels have been subjected to injustice,"
said Professor Charles Drekmeier, a
close friend of Marshall's.
Fascist pig, objective mediator or
the reasonable man, Marshall said he is
happy with what he is doing.
"I teach exactly what I want to
teach. ... I made the right choice of
professions. ... I wouldn't alter things
very much if I could," he says.

TIMELY INVOLVEMENT—Keeping up with the issues is important to Marshall,
who continuously revises his introductory political science course. "For a while I
had a special section on race relations; this year and last it was on Watergate," he
says. Here, Marshall speaks out during an impeachment debate held in Memorial
Church, October 1973.

Teaching Politics
Marshall's dissatisfaction with the 1
system permeates his Political Science
I lectures, but they are restrained,
methodical and well-organized. "I
don't think that it's possible to teach

political science in a non-political
way," he said.
Thus, in a lecture he discussed
"paranoid aspects of Richard Nixon's
personality," but then added "I
did not say he is paranoid; put that in
your notes."
In a Daily column, he was more
blunt:
"Watergate' involves people who
wrap themselves in the flag while
attempting to destroy the
Constitution."
Marshall has taught Poli Sci I for 21
years voluntarily. "Our department
is run by pure anarchy; no one tells
you what to teach," he says. "Poli Sci
I is the most fun thing that I do."
Basic Questions
The course is basic, but not
elementary, he says. "There are times
when I give students in Poli Sci I the
same questions that I would give Ph.D.
candidates on an exam.
"This will kill them if it gets into
the Daily," he added with a smile.
The ASSU Course Review described
his Poli Sci I as "exceptionally good."
"It's what everyone thinks they'll be
taking when they come to Stanford to
take political science," said a senior.
"It's the stuff that makes you
interested in poli sci; it's the stuff that
makes you think you want to be a poli
sci major."
Many do decide to major in
political science after taking Marshall's
course and are then bitterly
disappointed in the rest of the political
science department.
One political science major
recalled: "The TA in my discussion
section said, 'Don't be misled by this
class. It's probably more political and
more interesting than most anything
else in the department.' I didn't really
believe it at the time but it turned out
to be very true."
"In some ways I'm more political
than other poli sci professors,"
Marshall said. "Some see the domains
of politics and economics as very
different. You could study economics
with them without even knowing that
the government exists. I'm interested
in reality in government."
This interest in reality is nothing
new for Marshall. He graduated from
Antioch, a college where students take
five years to get a B.A. that extra
year is spent working in the
community.
Practical Orientation
A biology major, Marshall worked
for the U.S. Forest Service at the camp

for conscientious objectors. Then, at
the end of the war, he decided that he
was more interested in political
science.
"When I came back after four
years, I just was unable to sustain the
kind of interest in biology that I
needed to become a professional
biologist," he said. He went on to get
his doctorate in political science from
the University of North Carolina, and
taught for two years at the University
of Florida.
Then, in 1952, Marshall worked for
the Department of the Interior on
policy and program coordination. He
came to Stanford in 1953, the same
as Horn, who taught Political
Science I one quarter while Marshall
was on leave.
In those days, according to Horn,
Marshall left foreign policy out of this
class. "I did say to him one day, 'Well,
Hugh, this is Political Science I. How
can we leave out foreign policy?' "
Horn recalls.

"He [Marshall] said, 'I know, I
know it's important. But I just find it
so offensive that I can't bring myself
to put it in,' " said Horn, shaking his
head in amusement.
Both Marshall and Horn have done
relatively little research. "I'm more of
a teacher than a researcher," Marshall
says flatly.
His students gratefully agree. "He's
genuinely concerned with students,"
said a sophomore. "When I ask him
questions after class he does more than
just explain. He's looking at me. He
wants to know I understand."
Students find his lectures both
timely and amusing. They are
peppered with anecdotes and
underplayed humor.
Sublte Humor
Discussing the bomb shelters of the
early 60s, Marshall noted that they
were more prevalent in southern
California, "where people are more
paranoid than other places." At
Stanford, there were several
well-supplied shelters on campus:
"They all had large amounts of
crackers and water," said Marshall
with a sigh. "The idea was that we
would all sit around for days, weeks,
months, eating crackers, I guess."
In another lecture, Marshall recited
the Boy Scout laws in one breath and
from memory. He was loudly
applauded.
Talking about a bomb which
exploded in the Harvard Center for
International Affairs, Marshall

observed:
"There's not an awful lot to be
gained from bombing Harvard .. .
probably."
Coherent Comments
Even after 21 years of lecturing to
critical students, Marshall still is
nervous in the limelight, according to a
Daily reporter:
"Whenever I call Marshall for
comment on some news story, he
always starts talking, and then he says
right away, 'Wait a second, wait a
second. Let me just think off the top
of my head and then you can put it in
good language.'
"And I always go ahead and write
down exactly what he says. Then at
the end he says, 'Now, can you put
that in coherent form?' I always read
it back to him exactly as he said it,
and he always says, 'Yes, that's
perfect, that's perfect. You're very
good at it.' "
Marshall's opinions are frequently
solicited by others too.
"He's always very balanced and
very objective," said Horn. "He's one
of the first persons I would turn to in
the department."
'Amused Tolerance'
It is probably this objectivity that
gives Marshall what one student called
an "amused tolerance for life."
Marshall spent one year as head of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
and loved it.

"It was a ghastly year for work I
didn't get anything done," Marshall
recalls. "But some of the arguments
between Harvey Hukari [a staunch
conservative] and Yale Braunstein [a
vocal radical] were delightful.
Occasionally, to their own great
dismay, they'd be on the same side."
Marshall remembers now-fired
English Prof. Bruce Franklin and
his wife Jane in much the same way.
One time, he talked to Jane Franklin
after a debate on Vietnam. "I didn't
agree with her position, but in that
debate our differences hadn't really
come out," said Marshall.
"As she walked away, she said
'Power to the People! Death to the
Fascist Pigs!' ... I was just speechless.
A phrase like 'Death to the Fascist
Pigs' leaves me very ill at ease since I
probably am one of what she considers
the fascist pigs."
Reasonableness
Most of his friends would disagree.
"Hugh's always right there
championing the cause of those he
feels have been subjected to injustice,"
said Professor Charles Drekmeier, a
close friend of Marshall's.
Fascist pig, objective mediator or
the reasonable man, Marshall said he is
happy with what he is doing.
"I teach exactly what I want to
teach. ... I made the right choice of
professions. ... I wouldn't alter things
very much if I could," he says.

TIMELY INVOLVEMENT—Keeping up with the issues is important to Marshall,
who continuously revises his introductory political science course. "For a while I
had a special section on race relations; this year and last it was on Watergate," he
says. Here, Marshall speaks out during an impeachment debate held in Memorial
Church, October 1973.

THINK TWICE—Some political science majors say Prof. Hubert Marshall's
introductory course is so interesting that it creates a misleading impression of
the rest of the department. Others praise him for his dedication to teaching and
genuine concern for his students.
Hubert Marshall likes to garden and
read the Palo Alto Times, according to
some of his friends.
Hearing this, you might assume that
he was a boring professor who teaches
boding classes. You would be wrong.
"The law talks about the reasonable
man," said Professor Robert Horn, a
colleague of Marshall's. "Well, it would
be hard to find a better example than
Hugh Marshall."
It is probably Marshall's
reasonableness that makes him so
interesting and so well-liked. His
friends span the political spectrum and
all of them radical or conservative
praise his open-mindedness.
"He and I are poles apart
policy-wise," said Horn, a well-known
conservative. "But that has never come
between our friendship."
Those on the other end, notably
political science graduate students, say
Marshall is "sympathetic, someone
who's worth talking to, someone
who's potentially an ally."
Activist And Critic
Marshall calls himself a liberal and a
pacifist. A conscientious objector in

World War 11, he picketed President
Lyndon Johnson in 1965, supported
McGovern is early 1971 and last year
stood outside the Placement Center to
protest military recruiting there.
Now Marshall is a harsh critic of
President Ford, calling him "either a
liar or one of the most stupid men in
America."
For many of his Political Science 1
students, Marshall's attitudes would
probably come as a surprise. The man
who lectures to them three times a
week looks more like a retired
postman than a protester.
His pants hang in sharp creases,
barely brushing the tops of his laced,
dark brown shoes; his ties are rarely
wider than an inch; and all his shirts
have button-down collars. He always
wears a coat-and-tie to class, usually a
tweedy jacket with narrow lapels.
"He dresses in a grayish wool way,"
said one freshman.

"In some ways I'm more political
than other poli sci professors,"
Marshall said. "Some see the domains
of politics and economics as very
different. You could study economics
with them without even knowing that
the government exists. I'm interested
in reality in government."
This interest in reality is nothing
new for Marshall. He graduated from
Antioch, a college where students take
five years to get a B.A. that extra
year is spent working in the
community.
Practical Orientation
A biology major, Marshall worked
for the U.S. Forest Service at the camp

for conscientious objectors. Then, at
the end of the war, he decided that he
was more interested in political
science.
"When I came back after four
years, I just was unable to sustain the
kind of interest in biology that I
needed to become a professional
biologist," he said. He went on to get
his doctorate in political science from
the University of North Carolina, and
taught for two years at the University
of Florida.
Then, in 1952, Marshall worked for
the Department of the Interior on
policy and program coordination. He
came to Stanford in 1953, the same
as Horn, who taught Political
Science I one quarter while Marshall
was on leave.
In those days, according to Horn,
Marshall left foreign policy out of this
class. "I did say to him one day, 'Well,
Hugh, this is Political Science I. How
can we leave out foreign policy?' "
Horn recalls.

"He [Marshall] said, 'I know, I
know it's important. But I just find it
so offensive that I can't bring myself
to put it in,' " said Horn, shaking his
head in amusement.
Both Marshall and Horn have done
relatively little research. "I'm more of
a teacher than a researcher," Marshall
says flatly.
His students gratefully agree. "He's
genuinely concerned with students,"
said a sophomore. "When I ask him
questions after class he does more than
just explain. He's looking at me. He
wants to know I understand."
Students find his lectures both
timely and amusing. They are
peppered with anecdotes and
underplayed humor.
Sublte Humor
Discussing the bomb shelters of the
early 60s, Marshall noted that they
were more prevalent in southern
California, "where people are more
paranoid than other places." At
Stanford, there were several
well-supplied shelters on campus:
"They all had large amounts of
crackers and water," said Marshall
with a sigh. "The idea was that we
would all sit around for days, weeks,
months, eating crackers, I guess."
In another lecture, Marshall recited
the Boy Scout laws in one breath and
from memory. He was loudly
applauded.
Talking about a bomb which
exploded in the Harvard Center for
International Affairs, Marshall

observed:
"There's not an awful lot to be
gained from bombing Harvard .. .
probably."
Coherent Comments
Even after 21 years of lecturing to
critical students, Marshall still is
nervous in the limelight, according to a
Daily reporter:
"Whenever I call Marshall for
comment on some news story, he
always starts talking, and then he says
right away, 'Wait a second, wait a
second. Let me just think off the top
of my head and then you can put it in
good language.'
"And I always go ahead and write
down exactly what he says. Then at
the end he says, 'Now, can you put
that in coherent form?' I always read
it back to him exactly as he said it,
and he always says, 'Yes, that's
perfect, that's perfect. You're very
good at it.' "
Marshall's opinions are frequently
solicited by others too.
"He's always very balanced and
very objective," said Horn. "He's one
of the first persons I would turn to in
the department."
'Amused Tolerance'
It is probably this objectivity that
gives Marshall what one student called
an "amused tolerance for life."
Marshall spent one year as head of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
and loved it.

"It was a ghastly year for work I
didn't get anything done," Marshall
recalls. "But some of the arguments
between Harvey Hukari [a staunch
conservative] and Yale Braunstein [a
vocal radical] were delightful.
Occasionally, to their own great
dismay, they'd be on the same side."
Marshall remembers now-fired
English Prof. Bruce Franklin and
his wife Jane in much the same way.
One time, he talked to Jane Franklin
after a debate on Vietnam. "I didn't
agree with her position, but in that
debate our differences hadn't really
come out," said Marshall.
"As she walked away, she said
'Power to the People! Death to the
Fascist Pigs!' ... I was just speechless.
A phrase like 'Death to the Fascist
Pigs' leaves me very ill at ease since I
probably am one of what she considers
the fascist pigs."
Reasonableness
Most of his friends would disagree.
"Hugh's always right there
championing the cause of those he
feels have been subjected to injustice,"
said Professor Charles Drekmeier, a
close friend of Marshall's.
Fascist pig, objective mediator or
the reasonable man, Marshall said he is
happy with what he is doing.
"I teach exactly what I want to
teach. ... I made the right choice of
professions. ... I wouldn't alter things
very much if I could," he says.

TIMELY INVOLVEMENT—Keeping up with the issues is important to Marshall,
who continuously revises his introductory political science course. "For a while I
had a special section on race relations; this year and last it was on Watergate," he
says. Here, Marshall speaks out during an impeachment debate held in Memorial
Church, October 1973.

THINK TWICE—Some political science majors say Prof. Hubert Marshall's
introductory course is so interesting that it creates a misleading impression of
the rest of the department. Others praise him for his dedication to teaching and
genuine concern for his students.
Hubert Marshall likes to garden and
read the Palo Alto Times, according to
some of his friends.
Hearing this, you might assume that
he was a boring professor who teaches
boding classes. You would be wrong.
"The law talks about the reasonable
man," said Professor Robert Horn, a
colleague of Marshall's. "Well, it would
be hard to find a better example than
Hugh Marshall."
It is probably Marshall's
reasonableness that makes him so
interesting and so well-liked. His
friends span the political spectrum and
all of them radical or conservative
praise his open-mindedness.
"He and I are poles apart
policy-wise," said Horn, a well-known
conservative. "But that has never come
between our friendship."
Those on the other end, notably
political science graduate students, say
Marshall is "sympathetic, someone
who's worth talking to, someone
who's potentially an ally."
Activist And Critic
Marshall calls himself a liberal and a
pacifist. A conscientious objector in

World War 11, he picketed President
Lyndon Johnson in 1965, supported
McGovern is early 1971 and last year
stood outside the Placement Center to
protest military recruiting there.
Now Marshall is a harsh critic of
President Ford, calling him "either a
liar or one of the most stupid men in
America."
For many of his Political Science 1
students, Marshall's attitudes would
probably come as a surprise. The man
who lectures to them three times a
week looks more like a retired
postman than a protester.
His pants hang in sharp creases,
barely brushing the tops of his laced,
dark brown shoes; his ties are rarely
wider than an inch; and all his shirts
have button-down collars. He always
wears a coat-and-tie to class, usually a
tweedy jacket with narrow lapels.
"He dresses in a grayish wool way,"
said one freshman.
Teaching Politics
Marshall's dissatisfaction with the 1
system permeates his Political Science
I lectures, but they are restrained,
methodical and well-organized. "I
don't think that it's possible to teach

political science in a non-political
way," he said.
Thus, in a lecture he discussed
"paranoid aspects of Richard Nixon's
personality," but then added "I
did not say he is paranoid; put that in
your notes."
In a Daily column, he was more
blunt:
"Watergate' involves people who
wrap themselves in the flag while
attempting to destroy the
Constitution."
Marshall has taught Poli Sci I for 21
years voluntarily. "Our department
is run by pure anarchy; no one tells
you what to teach," he says. "Poli Sci
I is the most fun thing that I do."
Basic Questions
The course is basic, but not
elementary, he says. "There are times
when I give students in Poli Sci I the
same questions that I would give Ph.D.
candidates on an exam.
"This will kill them if it gets into
the Daily," he added with a smile.
The ASSU Course Review described
his Poli Sci I as "exceptionally good."
"It's what everyone thinks they'll be
taking when they come to Stanford to
take political science," said a senior.
"It's the stuff that makes you
interested in poli sci; it's the stuff that
makes you think you want to be a poli
sci major."
Many do decide to major in
political science after taking Marshall's
course and are then bitterly
disappointed in the rest of the political
science department.
One political science major
recalled: "The TA in my discussion
section said, 'Don't be misled by this
class. It's probably more political and
more interesting than most anything
else in the department.' I didn't really
believe it at the time but it turned out
to be very true."
"In some ways I'm more political

said a sophomore. "When I ask him
questions after class he does more than
just explain. He's looking at me. He
wants to know I understand."
Students find his lectures both
timely and amusing. They are
peppered with anecdotes and
underplayed humor.
Sublte Humor
Discussing the bomb shelters of the
early 60s, Marshall noted that they
were more prevalent in southern
California, "where people are more
paranoid than other places." At
Stanford, there were several
well-supplied shelters on campus:
"They all had large amounts of
crackers and water," said Marshall
with a sigh. "The idea was that we
would all sit around for days, weeks,
months, eating crackers, I guess."
In another lecture, Marshall recited
the Boy Scout laws in one breath and
from memory. He was loudly
applauded.
Talking about a bomb which
exploded in the Harvard Center for
International Affairs, Marshall

observed:
"There's not an awful lot to be
gained from bombing Harvard .. .
probably."
Coherent Comments
Even after 21 years of lecturing to
critical students, Marshall still is
nervous in the limelight, according to a
Daily reporter:
"Whenever I call Marshall for
comment on some news story, he
always starts talking, and then he says
right away, 'Wait a second, wait a
second. Let me just think off the top
of my head and then you can put it in
good language.'
"And I always go ahead and write
down exactly what he says. Then at
the end he says, 'Now, can you put
that in coherent form?' I always read
it back to him exactly as he said it,
and he always says, 'Yes, that's
perfect, that's perfect. You're very
good at it.' "
Marshall's opinions are frequently
solicited by others too.
"He's always very balanced and
very objective," said Horn. "He's one
of the first persons I would turn to in
the department."
'Amused Tolerance'
It is probably this objectivity that
gives Marshall what one student called
an "amused tolerance for life."
Marshall spent one year as head of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
and loved it.

"It was a ghastly year for work I
didn't get anything done," Marshall
recalls. "But some of the arguments
between Harvey Hukari [a staunch
conservative] and Yale Braunstein [a
vocal radical] were delightful.
Occasionally, to their own great
dismay, they'd be on the same side."
Marshall remembers now-fired
English Prof. Bruce Franklin and
his wife Jane in much the same way.
One time, he talked to Jane Franklin
after a debate on Vietnam. "I didn't
agree with her position, but in that
debate our differences hadn't really
come out," said Marshall.
"As she walked away, she said
'Power to the People! Death to the
Fascist Pigs!' ... I was just speechless.
A phrase like 'Death to the Fascist
Pigs' leaves me very ill at ease since I
probably am one of what she considers
the fascist pigs."
Reasonableness
Most of his friends would disagree.
"Hugh's always right there
championing the cause of those he
feels have been subjected to injustice,"
said Professor Charles Drekmeier, a
close friend of Marshall's.
Fascist pig, objective mediator or
the reasonable man, Marshall said he is
happy with what he is doing.
"I teach exactly what I want to
teach. ... I made the right choice of
professions. ... I wouldn't alter things
very much if I could," he says.

TIMELY INVOLVEMENT—Keeping up with the issues is important to Marshall,
who continuously revises his introductory political science course. "For a while I
had a special section on race relations; this year and last it was on Watergate," he
says. Here, Marshall speaks out during an impeachment debate held in Memorial
Church, October 1973.

THINK TWICE—Some political science majors say Prof. Hubert Marshall's
introductory course is so interesting that it creates a misleading impression of
the rest of the department. Others praise him for his dedication to teaching and
genuine concern for his students.
Hubert Marshall likes to garden and
read the Palo Alto Times, according to
some of his friends.
Hearing this, you might assume that
he was a boring professor who teaches
boding classes. You would be wrong.
"The law talks about the reasonable
man," said Professor Robert Horn, a
colleague of Marshall's. "Well, it would
be hard to find a better example than
Hugh Marshall."
It is probably Marshall's
reasonableness that makes him so
interesting and so well-liked. His
friends span the political spectrum and
all of them radical or conservative
praise his open-mindedness.
"He and I are poles apart
policy-wise," said Horn, a well-known
conservative. "But that has never come
between our friendship."
Those on the other end, notably
political science graduate students, say
Marshall is "sympathetic, someone
who's worth talking to, someone
who's potentially an ally."
Activist And Critic
Marshall calls himself a liberal and a
pacifist. A conscientious objector in

World War 11, he picketed President
Lyndon Johnson in 1965, supported
McGovern is early 1971 and last year
stood outside the Placement Center to
protest military recruiting there.
Now Marshall is a harsh critic of
President Ford, calling him "either a
liar or one of the most stupid men in
America."
For many of his Political Science 1
students, Marshall's attitudes would
probably come as a surprise. The man
who lectures to them three times a
week looks more like a retired
postman than a protester.
His pants hang in sharp creases,
barely brushing the tops of his laced,
dark brown shoes; his ties are rarely
wider than an inch; and all his shirts
have button-down collars. He always
wears a coat-and-tie to class, usually a
tweedy jacket with narrow lapels.
"He dresses in a grayish wool way,"
said one freshman.
Teaching Politics
Marshall's dissatisfaction with the 1
system permeates his Political Science
I lectures, but they are restrained,
methodical and well-organized. "I
don't think that it's possible to teach

political science in a non-political
way," he said.
Thus, in a lecture he discussed
"paranoid aspects of Richard Nixon's
personality," but then added "I
did not say he is paranoid; put that in
your notes."
In a Daily column, he was more
blunt:
"Watergate' involves people who
wrap themselves in the flag while
attempting to destroy the
Constitution."
Marshall has taught Poli Sci I for 21
years voluntarily. "Our department
is run by pure anarchy; no one tells
you what to teach," he says. "Poli Sci
I is the most fun thing that I do."
Basic Questions
The course is basic, but not
elementary, he says. "There are times
when I give students in Poli Sci I the
same questions that I would give Ph.D.
candidates on an exam.
"This will kill them if it gets into
the Daily," he added with a smile.
The ASSU Course Review described
his Poli Sci I as "exceptionally good."
"It's what everyone thinks they'll be
taking when they come to Stanford to
take political science," said a senior.
"It's the stuff that makes you
interested in poli sci; it's the stuff that
makes you think you want to be a poli
sci major."
Many do decide to major in
political science after taking Marshall's
course and are then bitterly
disappointed in the rest of the political
science department.
One political science major
recalled: "The TA in my discussion
section said, 'Don't be misled by this
class. It's probably more political and
more interesting than most anything
else in the department.' I didn't really
believe it at the time but it turned out
to be very true."
"In some ways I'm more political
than other poli sci professors,"
Marshall said. "Some see the domains
of politics and economics as very
different. You could study economics
with them without even knowing that
the government exists. I'm interested
in reality in government."
This interest in reality is nothing
new for Marshall. He graduated from
Antioch, a college where students take
five years to get a B.A. that extra
year is spent working in the
community.
Practical Orientation
A biology major, Marshall worked
for the U.S. Forest Service at the camp

for conscientious objectors. Then, at
the end of the war, he decided that he
was more interested in political
science.
"When I came back after four
years, I just was unable to sustain the
kind of interest in biology that I
needed to become a professional
biologist," he said. He went on to get
his doctorate in political science from
the University of North Carolina, and
taught for two years at the University
of Florida.
Then, in 1952, Marshall worked for
the Department of the Interior on
policy and program coordination. He
came to Stanford in 1953, the same
as Horn, who taught Political
Science I one quarter while Marshall
was on leave.
In those days, according to Horn,
Marshall left foreign policy out of this
class. "I did say to him one day, 'Well,
Hugh, this is Political Science I. How
can we leave out foreign policy?' "
Horn recalls.

"He [Marshall] said, 'I know, I
know it's important. But I just find it
so offensive that I can't bring myself
to put it in,' " said Horn, shaking his
head in amusement.
Both Marshall and Horn have done
relatively little research. "I'm more of
a teacher than a researcher," Marshall
says flatly.
His students gratefully agree. "He's
genuinely concerned with students,"
said a sophomore. "When I ask him
questions after class he does more than
just explain. He's looking at me. He
wants to know I understand."

of the first persons I would turn to in
the department."
'Amused Tolerance'
It is probably this objectivity that
gives Marshall what one student called
an "amused tolerance for life."
Marshall spent one year as head of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
and loved it.

"It was a ghastly year for work I
didn't get anything done," Marshall
recalls. "But some of the arguments
between Harvey Hukari [a staunch
conservative] and Yale Braunstein [a
vocal radical] were delightful.
Occasionally, to their own great
dismay, they'd be on the same side."
Marshall remembers now-fired
English Prof. Bruce Franklin and
his wife Jane in much the same way.
One time, he talked to Jane Franklin
after a debate on Vietnam. "I didn't
agree with her position, but in that
debate our differences hadn't really
come out," said Marshall.
"As she walked away, she said
'Power to the People! Death to the
Fascist Pigs!' ... I was just speechless.
A phrase like 'Death to the Fascist
Pigs' leaves me very ill at ease since I
probably am one of what she considers
the fascist pigs."
Reasonableness
Most of his friends would disagree.
"Hugh's always right there
championing the cause of those he
feels have been subjected to injustice,"
said Professor Charles Drekmeier, a
close friend of Marshall's.
Fascist pig, objective mediator or
the reasonable man, Marshall said he is
happy with what he is doing.
"I teach exactly what I want to
teach. ... I made the right choice of
professions. ... I wouldn't alter things
very much if I could," he says.

TIMELY INVOLVEMENT—Keeping up with the issues is important to Marshall,
who continuously revises his introductory political science course. "For a while I
had a special section on race relations; this year and last it was on Watergate," he
says. Here, Marshall speaks out during an impeachment debate held in Memorial
Church, October 1973.

THINK TWICE—Some political science majors say Prof. Hubert Marshall's
introductory course is so interesting that it creates a misleading impression of
the rest of the department. Others praise him for his dedication to teaching and
genuine concern for his students.
Hubert Marshall likes to garden and
read the Palo Alto Times, according to
some of his friends.
Hearing this, you might assume that
he was a boring professor who teaches
boding classes. You would be wrong.
"The law talks about the reasonable
man," said Professor Robert Horn, a
colleague of Marshall's. "Well, it would
be hard to find a better example than
Hugh Marshall."
It is probably Marshall's
reasonableness that makes him so
interesting and so well-liked. His
friends span the political spectrum and
all of them radical or conservative
praise his open-mindedness.
"He and I are poles apart
policy-wise," said Horn, a well-known
conservative. "But that has never come
between our friendship."
Those on the other end, notably
political science graduate students, say
Marshall is "sympathetic, someone
who's worth talking to, someone
who's potentially an ally."
Activist And Critic
Marshall calls himself a liberal and a
pacifist. A conscientious objector in

World War 11, he picketed President
Lyndon Johnson in 1965, supported
McGovern is early 1971 and last year
stood outside the Placement Center to
protest military recruiting there.
Now Marshall is a harsh critic of
President Ford, calling him "either a
liar or one of the most stupid men in
America."
For many of his Political Science 1
students, Marshall's attitudes would
probably come as a surprise. The man
who lectures to them three times a
week looks more like a retired
postman than a protester.
His pants hang in sharp creases,
barely brushing the tops of his laced,
dark brown shoes; his ties are rarely
wider than an inch; and all his shirts
have button-down collars. He always
wears a coat-and-tie to class, usually a
tweedy jacket with narrow lapels.
"He dresses in a grayish wool way,"
said one freshman.
Teaching Politics
Marshall's dissatisfaction with the 1
system permeates his Political Science
I lectures, but they are restrained,
methodical and well-organized. "I
don't think that it's possible to teach

political science in a non-political
way," he said.
Thus, in a lecture he discussed
"paranoid aspects of Richard Nixon's
personality," but then added "I
did not say he is paranoid; put that in
your notes."
In a Daily column, he was more
blunt:
"Watergate' involves people who
wrap themselves in the flag while
attempting to destroy the
Constitution."
Marshall has taught Poli Sci I for 21
years voluntarily. "Our department
is run by pure anarchy; no one tells
you what to teach," he says. "Poli Sci
I is the most fun thing that I do."
Basic Questions
The course is basic, but not
elementary, he says. "There are times
when I give students in Poli Sci I the
same questions that I would give Ph.D.
candidates on an exam.
"This will kill them if it gets into
the Daily," he added with a smile.
The ASSU Course Review described
his Poli Sci I as "exceptionally good."
"It's what everyone thinks they'll be
taking when they come to Stanford to
take political science," said a senior.
"It's the stuff that makes you
interested in poli sci; it's the stuff that
makes you think you want to be a poli
sci major."
Many do decide to major in
political science after taking Marshall's
course and are then bitterly
disappointed in the rest of the political
science department.
One political science major
recalled: "The TA in my discussion
section said, 'Don't be misled by this
class. It's probably more political and
more interesting than most anything
else in the department.' I didn't really
believe it at the time but it turned out
to be very true."
"In some ways I'm more political
than other poli sci professors,"
Marshall said. "Some see the domains
of politics and economics as very
different. You could study economics
with them without even knowing that
the government exists. I'm interested
in reality in government."
This interest in reality is nothing
new for Marshall. He graduated from
Antioch, a college where students take
five years to get a B.A. that extra
year is spent working in the
community.
Practical Orientation
A biology major, Marshall worked
for the U.S. Forest Service at the camp

for conscientious objectors. Then, at
the end of the war, he decided that he
was more interested in political
science.
"When I came back after four
years, I just was unable to sustain the
kind of interest in biology that I
needed to become a professional
biologist," he said. He went on to get
his doctorate in political science from
the University of North Carolina, and
taught for two years at the University
of Florida.
Then, in 1952, Marshall worked for
the Department of the Interior on
policy and program coordination. He
came to Stanford in 1953, the same
as Horn, who taught Political
Science I one quarter while Marshall
was on leave.
In those days, according to Horn,
Marshall left foreign policy out of this
class. "I did say to him one day, 'Well,
Hugh, this is Political Science I. How
can we leave out foreign policy?' "
Horn recalls.

"He [Marshall] said, 'I know, I
know it's important. But I just find it
so offensive that I can't bring myself
to put it in,' " said Horn, shaking his
head in amusement.
Both Marshall and Horn have done
relatively little research. "I'm more of
a teacher than a researcher," Marshall
says flatly.
His students gratefully agree. "He's
genuinely concerned with students,"
said a sophomore. "When I ask him
questions after class he does more than
just explain. He's looking at me. He
wants to know I understand."
Students find his lectures both
timely and amusing. They are
peppered with anecdotes and
underplayed humor.
Sublte Humor
Discussing the bomb shelters of the
early 60s, Marshall noted that they
were more prevalent in southern
California, "where people are more
paranoid than other places." At
Stanford, there were several
well-supplied shelters on campus:
"They all had large amounts of
crackers and water," said Marshall
with a sigh. "The idea was that we
would all sit around for days, weeks,
months, eating crackers, I guess."
In another lecture, Marshall recited
the Boy Scout laws in one breath and
from memory. He was loudly
applauded.
Talking about a bomb which
exploded in the Harvard Center for
International Affairs, Marshall

observed:
"There's not an awful lot to be
gained from bombing Harvard .. .
probably."
Coherent Comments
Even after 21 years of lecturing to
critical students, Marshall still is
nervous in the limelight, according to a
Daily reporter:
"Whenever I call Marshall for
comment on some news story, he
always starts talking, and then he says
right away, 'Wait a second, wait a
second. Let me just think off the top
of my head and then you can put it in
good language.'
"And I always go ahead and write
down exactly what he says. Then at
the end he says, 'Now, can you put
that in coherent form?' I always read
it back to him exactly as he said it,
and he always says, 'Yes, that's
perfect, that's perfect. You're very
good at it.' "
Marshall's opinions are frequently
solicited by others too.
"He's always very balanced and
very objective," said Horn. "He's one
of the first persons I would turn to in
the department."
'Amused Tolerance'
It is probably this objectivity that
gives Marshall what one student called
an "amused tolerance for life."
Marshall spent one year as head of the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
and loved it.

"It was a ghastly year for work I
didn't get anything done," Marshall
recalls. "But some of the arguments
