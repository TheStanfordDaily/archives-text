## 'Nutcracker' Performed Well 
### TERRY ANZUR 
OAKLANDâ€”The Bwy Area
needs another Nutcracker during
the Christmas season like
McDonald's needs another
hamburger. But the Oakland
Ballet's abbreviated version has a
character all its own.

Absent from this production
are the traditional mob of guests,
the herd of mice, the battalion of
toy soldiers, the flurry of dancing
snowflakes. And the only children
in the theater are in the audience
not on stage.
Instead choreographer Ron
Guidi bypasses tradition and
freely adapts the Hoffman
fairytale set to Tchaikovsky's
music to suit the particular talents
of his own company.
Guidi makes the most of
Oakland's mature, talented
dancers by recycling the principals
in more than one part and
modifying character roles to
showcase their abilities.
Supplies Own Boos
Arthur Conrad, as the
mysterious Uncle Drosselmeyer,
adds a comic touch to his part by
joining in Christmas toasts a little
too eagerly. Whatever is magic
about this Drosselmeyer seems to
be coming from his hip flask and
corroding his liver.
The recipients of his gifts are
Louise, Fritz and Marie, portrayed
by Dana Cordova, Michael Lowe
and Stacey Swaner.
This trio of "children" enlivens
Act I with playfully danced
attempts to peek at the Christmas
tree. But don't call them kids.
They are polished, well-trained
dancers who move with mature
ease and assurance.
Changed Character
Marie, Drosselmeyer's favorite,
gets the Nutcracker. But Swaner is
hardly the cute "Clara" of most
Nutcrackers. Instead, she's a
romantic teenager who probably
is too old to be unwrapping dolls
for Christmas.
Anyway, she's more interested
in the shy nephew, who fixes her
broken Nutcracker. Jim Sohm's
smooth, solid dancing perfectly
complemented Swaner's fluid
extensions and easy grace.
That night, Marie dreams her
homely toy comes to life as a
handsome prince who looks a lot
like the nephew. In a duel at 20
paces, the prince shoots the evil
Rat King and escorts Marie
through the Land of the Snows to
the Kingdom of Sweets where the
Sugar Plum Fairy reigns.
Dual Relationships

The astute viewer may notice
that the Sugar Plum and her
Cavalier look much like Marie's
mother and father, signaling the
return of Judith Sandeweiss and
Ron Thiele in dual roles.
Conrad also returns as the
Master of Ceremonies for the
divertissement. Even sister Louise
comes back as a snowflake and
solos in the Chinese tea variation.

These interesting quirks in the
libretto may invite dream analysts
to speculate on the state of
Marie's psyche, but they don't
detract from the principals'
performances. Fatigue is only
slightly apparent near the end of
Act 11.

But some treasured traditions
are missing in the streamlined
scenario: gone is the pageantry of
the party scene, little girls dancing
with their dollies and little boys
making noise with toy trumpets;
gone is the swordfight between
the rats and the toy soldiers; gone
is the disciplined precision of a
large corps in the flower and
snowflake dances.

It's just as well. Guidi has some
trouble handling just 10
snowflakes or eight flowers all on
stage at the same time. The
choreography is downright
confusing, as he often avoids
allowing any two dancers to do
the same thing at the same time.

The sparkling technique of
Snow Queen Janet Carole was
evident in her superior
interpretation of the role. She was
solidly partnered by David
Roland, but his leaps were
earthbound.
Intrusion
The Snow Queen and cavalier
intruded in the candy
divertissement.Although the pair's
dancing was consistent, their
appearance in Act II was out of
place.
The divertissement was
excellent. As the Chinese Tea,
Cordova completed a
toe-torturing variation with a
delicate smile.
She was chased around the
stage by David McNaughton as
Russian Licorice. His astounding
leaps make him a candidate for
the next space race.
French bon-bons Mindy Berrol
and Johanna Breyer cavorted to
reed flute music in pursuit of a
narcissistic candy dandy (Lynn
Pendleton). As the girls swoon,
the dandy preens about the stage,
eliciting hoots from the audience.
Arab Highlight
The highlight was the spicy
Arabian coffee, perfectly danced
by Dianne Brock and Richard
Cook.

Combining sultry
choreography and sensuous
interpretation, made this the
finest variation this reviewer has
seen. From the moment Brock
spun out of a flowing scarf to

tempt scantily-clad Cook, the
audience held its breath.

Act II was sadly bogged down
by overuse of pas de deux. After a
haughty Spanish variation by two
couples, the liveliness of Rose
Queen Tricia Kaye and her
Cavalier, and the return of the
snow duo, the grand pas de deux
by Sandeweiss and Theile was
anticlimactic, although
well-danced.
Too Much Together
Each pas de deux was a
cohesive unit. But in sequence,
the effect was like an overdose of
Christmas candy.
The costuming and scenery of
this Nutcracker set it apart from
its better-publicized neighbors
across the Bay. The only tutu in
sight is worn by Julie Vilgus as the
ballerina doll.
Costumer Stephen K. Simmons
instead dresses the women in
flowipg empire-waist knee-length
gowns. The swirling chiffon skirts
soften the choreography in the
dance of the snowflakes and the
waltz of the flowers.
More Natural Look
Although traditionalists might
balk at a Sugar Plum Fairy dressed
in an elegant nightgown, the soft
design actually makes extensions
look more natural.
Unfortunately, the sets are less
innovative.
Even Nutcracker watchers who
don't appreciate a grand pas de
deux can usually delight in the
ballet's special effects an
on-stage snowstorm and a
magically growing Christmas tree.
But only a surrealistic
backdrop drawing signals a
transformation in Oakland's
dream Christmas tree. The Snow
and Candy Kingdom scenery is
jumbled together, detracting from
the effect of both scenes.

The Oakland Ballet retains the
spirit of the Nutcracker ballet
with steamlined production,
contemporary choreography and
delightful dancing. And if Uncle
Drosselmeyer will pass the flask,
that merits a holiday toast even
in Oakland.
