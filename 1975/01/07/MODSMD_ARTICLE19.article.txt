## 'Towering Inferno' Burns Itself Out 
### George Powell 
Inflation, a problem that's
wreaking havoc with the nation's
economy, has at last come to
disaster films as well. For The
Towering Inferno one of
everything isn't good enough, or
colossal enough, or spellbinding
enough or disastrous enough.
No, this film doubles
everything. Not one but two
major studies (Warner Brothers
and 20th Century Fox) financed
the film. It's not based on one,
but two books (The Tower and
The Glass Inferno). Not one but
two superstars (Steve McQueen
and Paul Newman). Not one but
two directors (John Guillermin
and producer Irwin Allen for the
action sequences). Not one but two
elderly stars of yesteryear (Fred
Astaire and Jennifer Jones). Not
one but two pretty faces from
television and other movies
(Robert Wagner and Richard
Chamberlain). And on and on ad

nauseum.
So inflated, The Towering
Inferno topples of its own
self-generated hype, becoming
much like a glossy kung-fu movie,
where the audience waits on the
edge of their seats for the next
exciting event. It doesn't really
matter what the characters are
saying, it's the action audiences
crave, and in that, The Towering
Inferno excels. The special effects
are excellent, if you can accept
the idea of a 136 story building
being built on the site of the Bank
of America tower in San
Francisco.

The fire in the building on its
opening night is a high-society
disaster, as a senator, the mayor
of San Francisco and other
dignitaries are trapped on the top
floors.
When all is said and done, there
haye been numerous burnings,
explosions, crashes, narrow
escapes, acts of cowardice and
courage, which all show how good
and bad any group of people
(even if they are upper class) can
be.
It's the same old format carried
over from the other disaster epics
of the holiday season, Airport 75
and Earthquake. In these two
other mind-numbing exercises in
mass hysteria, the good and bad
are spread over a broader
cross-section of the population, all
unified by Charlton Heston, who
is in both Airport 75 and
Earthquake. For actual body
count, Earthquake beats all the

The very idea that San
Franciscans would approve such a
hideous monstrosity gives the film
an air of comic-book reality from
the beginning. Secretly, Bay Area
audiences must be rooting for the
building to burn, since it's such a
disgusting blight on ther San
Francisco skyline.

other disaster epics combined,
with many thousands killed in the
wrath of God destruction of Los
Angeles.
Although not as deadly as
Earthquake , the special effects in
The Towering Inferno are more
compelling. When the earthquake
begins its "Sensurround" rumble,
you immediately know what it's
like to stick your head in a bass
speaker at a Grand Funk concert.
None of this foolishness for The
Towering Inferno.
It's all left up to Paul Newman
to sum up the whole inflated
genre after the fire has done its
damndest. "We ought to leave it
[the 136-floor tower] standing as
a monument to all the shit in the
world," he sighs in a world-weary
manner. One can only hope that
movie audiences will also leave
The Towering Inferno as a grossly
exaggerated monument to the
disaster film, and go to some
different box office craze, rather
than try to construct yet greater
disasters on a burned-out hulk.
"The Towering Inferno," rated
PG, is playing at the Guild
Theater in Menlo Park.
