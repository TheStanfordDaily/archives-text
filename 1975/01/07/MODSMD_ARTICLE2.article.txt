# Vehicle Parking Registration
## ASSU Senate Supports Fee Boycott 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The ASSU Senate last night
unanimously approved a resolution
recommending that students not
purchase the required $7.50 parking
sticker until the University "clarifies
the purpose" of the fee.
The resolution further
recommended that students who
purchased stickers at Maples Pavilion
yesterday not place the decal on their
cars.
In addition, the Senate
recommended that the faculty and
staff personnel not pick up their free
parking stickers at the Department of
Police Services.
Two Reasons
The resolution cited two possible
reasons for the imposed fee:
to identify cars owned by
Stanford students, faculty and staff.

and/or;
to provide funds for road
maintenance and police protection
services.
ASSU Sen. Pieter Winsemius, the
author of the resolution, rejected the
first reason because "it appears
extremely unlikely that such an
administrative task will cost $7.50
[or] about man-hours per
registered car."
The second reason is also not
justified, Winsemius said, because
"students living on-campus have no
advantages over visitors or off-campus
students that did not register their car
except that they have one parking
place near their apartment."
He explained that for further
parking, on-campus students have to
use the general all-permit areas. Such
parking lots "were practically

eliminated by the reassignment that
took place during the Christmas break.
'Maintenance Fee'
"Thus, essentially the registration
fee then is reduced to a parking fee for
on-campus students, paying for
maintenance, police protection and
enforcement of the residential areas."
In yesterday's Daily, Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, contended that car
owners "are paying for vehicle
registration. They're not paying for a
service."
However, Winsemius said
Augsburger told him on Jan. 2 that the
fee was levied to provide road
maintenance and police services.
Thus, the Senate asks the
University to clarify its reasons for
continuing the fee, as stated in the
resolution.

Marvin Herrington, director of
police services, said yesterday that a
portion of all parking fees goes toward
funding "the whole spectrum of police
services."
Herrington added that the parking
fee goes directly to the University's
general fund, which is, in turn,
redirected in part to police services.
ASSU Sen. William Hoke said he
was "convinced that some person in
the University is determined to
squeeze this money [for the parking
fee] from the students and won't let it
die."
Twice The Price
Winsemius also said that
"on-campus students in Escondido
Village and also in dorms and frats pay
twice for the same services." Both rent
and parking fees include charges for
police services, he said.
Herrington insisted that parked cars
without the decals will be cited after
the Jan. 20 deadline. "I hate to see us
write a lot of tickets," he said.
The present parking system is due
to end next fall. Herrington suggested
that input be directed to the longer
term program because "it's pointless
to go through all this for a program
that will be lost in a short time."
