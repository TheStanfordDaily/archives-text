Amnesty Plan Flounders
WASHINGTON With only three weeks left for
men to stign up for the amnesty program for
convicted draft evaders and deserters, the
Presidential Clemency Board launched a nationwide
radio-television campaign yesterday to get word to
those who are eligible.
Board Chairman Charles E. Goodell said only
900 have signed up with the board out of the
100,000 eligible, mainly because many don't know
they are eligible.
Goodell announced at a news conference that the
board is mailing to all the nation's radio and
television stations tapes telling about the program
and urging the stations to play them often as a
public service.
"It would be an additional service if your station
announcer could do a countdown i.e., only 14
more days left to apply to the Presidential
Clemency Board. Time is running out," said a letter
Goodell sent to each station With the tapes. The
deadline is Jan. 31.
Officials: Cities Sitting On Funds
WASHINGTON While unemployment
continues to grow, states and cities are sitting on
millions of dollars in federal funds that could
provide thousands of public service jobs, U.S.
officials say.
However, some local authorities complain that
there are too many strings attached to the money.
The federal government has granted state and
local governments about $955 million over the past
six months to create about 200,000 public service
jobs. The Labor Department allocated an additional
$787 million yesterday to provide another 100,000
jobs.
At the same time, however, the department said

that as of December, only 78,000 jobs were filled.
Department representatives planned meetings in the
next two weeks with employment officials of all 50
states in connection with job programs and local
authorities have been dirr "ted to come up with new
hiring plans.
The December unemployment rate was 7.1
percent, up from 6.5 percent in November. The
Labor Department said more than 6.5 million
Americans were without jobs last month.
Douglas' Condition Improves
WASHINGTON Supreme Court Justice
William O. Douglas has been removed from the
intensive care unit at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center, and a spokesman there said yesterday his
condition continues to improve.
Douglas, 76, spent a restful weekend and was
moved into a private room on Sunday, the
spokesman said.
The justice was admitted to the hospital
Wednesday after suffering a stroke on New Year's
Eve while vacationing in the Bahamas.
The hospital statement said Douglas spent a brief
period out of bed Sunday, sitting in a chair. It said
he is "alert and resting comfortably."
"His condition continues to improve, his appetite
remains excellent, his vital signs are stable and he is
continuing on anti-coagulants and with physical
therapy," the statement added.
According to earlier reports, Douglas has been
suffering weakness and some impairment of motion
on the left side.
The hospital spokesman declined to speculate on
how long Douglas' recovery might take. The
Supreme Court < reconvenes next Monday after a
three-week recess.
Even if Douglas is absent for any period of time,
the remaining eight justices will continue to hear
and decide cases.
Communists Shell Western Saigon
SAIGON Communist gunners yesterday
shelled the western edge of Saigon in the closest
rocket attack to the capital in over two years.
Half the rockets landed in a village, killing a
family of four and wounding eight others. rest
landed in rice paddies and did no damage.
At Phuoc Binh, government defenders were
reported under a fifth day of intense North
Vietnamese infantry and tank attacks, which Hanoi
defended in a radio broadcast as a "legitimate"
response to "repeated South Vietnamese violations
of the Paris peace agreement."
The Hanoi broadcast also charged the Ford
administration with maintaining a network of U.S.
officers in command of the Saigon army and said
the United States must bear "major responsibility"
for "crimes" committed by South Vietnamese
forces.
In Cambodia, insurgents pressed a week-long
attack on Phnom Penh the central target of what
observers say is a dry-season offensive paralleling the
Communist offensive in Vietnam.
Israeli: Syrians Aiding Guerrillas
JERUSALEM Israeli Defense Minister Shimon
Peres said yesterday that Palestinian guerrillas in
Lebanon have been reinforced by Palestinian troops
from Syria armed with sophisticated missiles.
He warned Lebanon and Syria that Israel would

see any attempt by the Syrian army "to- take a
foothold" outside Syrian borders as "the start of a
confrontation and the extension of aggression."
However, in the address to parliament, Peres did
not specify whether the Palestinians that he said
recently arrived at southern Lebanese guerrilla bases
were part of a Palestinian unit of the Syrian army.
He said they were armed with antitank and
antiaircraft missiles.
Peres spoke shortly after the commander of the
border police reported that new secret measures had
provided an early detection system against guerrilla
infiltration and had effectively halted terrorists'
raids.
Peres told the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,
that Israel had "no designs on Lebanese
sovereignty" but that the guerrillas "constitute a
threat to Israel's own security and peace along its
northern border."

Auto Industry Sales Decline
DETROIT The nation's auto companies,
plagued by inflation, energy shortages and growing
recession, reported yesterday a 23 percent sales
decline for 1974 from the year before. It was their
second worst sales performance in 11 years.
December sales of 429,198 were off 25 percent
from December 1973, when the industry began to
feel the painful effects of the energy crisis.
Although last month's sales were the second
lowest for a December in 15 years, company
executives predicted yesterday that the worst of the
14-month sales slump was behind them.
But industry spokesmen said there will be further
production cutbacks and worker layoffs if the sales
decline continues.
Because of declining output, the companies
already have scheduled massive furloughs that will
leave 280,000 of 678,000 hourly workers in the
country on layoff for at least part of this month.
New Contraceptive Developed
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. Scientists say they have
developed a self-dissolving birth control capsule that
is expected to work for a year or longer when
implanted under a woman's skin.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
researchers say the capsules, designed to eliminate
the need to remove a plastic shell after the
contraceptive is exhausted, have so far proved 100
percent effective in rats and dogs. They estimate
that testing in humans is three years away, after
more tests in dogs and tests with monkeys.
In addition to eliminating the need to take a pill
daily, the scientists say their system may have fewer
unpleasant side effects than daily contraceptives
because the total hormone dose over a long period
of time would be much less.
Older-style plastic capsules designed for
long-term contraception must be removed after
their contents are exhausted and sometimes cause
irritation under the skin.

not specify whether the Palestinians that he said
recently arrived at southern Lebanese guerrilla bases
were part of a Palestinian unit of the Syrian army.
He said they were armed with antitank and
antiaircraft missiles.
Peres spoke shortly after the commander of the
border police reported that new secret measures had
provided an early detection system against guerrilla
infiltration and had effectively halted terrorists'

Peres told the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,
that Israel had "no designs on Lebanese
sovereignty" but that the guerrillas "constitute a
threat to Israel's own security and peace along its
northern border."

However, in the address to parliament, Peres did

recently arrived at southern Lebanese guerrilla bases
were part of a Palestinian unit of the Syrian army.

Auto Industry Sales Decline
DETROIT The nation's auto companies,
plagued by inflation, energy shortages and growing
recession, reported yesterday a 23 percent sales
decline for 1974 from the year before. It was their
second worst sales performance in 11 years.
December sales of 429,198 were off 25 percent
from December 1973, when the industry began to
feel the painful effects of the energy crisis.
Although last month's sales were the second
lowest for a December in 15 years, company
executives predicted yesterday that the worst of the
14-month sales slump was behind them.
But industry spokesmen said there will be further
production cutbacks and worker layoffs if the sales
decline continues.
Because of declining output, the companies
already have scheduled massive furloughs that will
leave 280,000 of 678,000 hourly workers in the
country on layoff for at least part of this month.
New Contraceptive Developed
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. Scientists say they have
developed a self-dissolving birth control capsule that
is expected to work for a year or longer when
implanted under a woman's skin.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
researchers say the capsules, designed to eliminate
the need to remove a plastic shell after the
contraceptive is exhausted, have so far proved 100
percent effective in rats and dogs. They estimate
that testing in humans is three years away, after
more tests in dogs and tests with monkeys.
In addition to eliminating the need to take a pill
daily, the scientists say their system may have fewer
unpleasant side effects than daily contraceptives
because the total hormone dose over a long period
of time would be much less.
Older-style plastic capsules designed for
long-term contraception must be removed after
their contents are exhausted and sometimes cause
irritation under the skin.

that as of December, only 78,000 jobs were filled.
Department representatives planned meetings in the
next two weeks with employment officials of all 50
states in connection with job programs and local
authorities have been dirr "ted to come up with new

Communists Shell Western Saigon
SAIGON Communist gunners yesterday
shelled the western edge of Saigon in the closest
rocket attack to the capital in over two years.
Half the rockets landed in a village, killing a
family of four and wounding eight others. rest
landed in rice paddies and did no damage.
At Phuoc Binh, government defenders were
reported under a fifth day of intense North
Vietnamese infantry and tank attacks, which Hanoi
defended in a radio broadcast as a "legitimate"
response to "repeated South Vietnamese violations
of the Paris peace agreement."
The Hanoi broadcast also charged the Ford
administration with maintaining a network of U.S.
officers in command of the Saigon army and said
the United States must bear "major responsibility"
for "crimes" committed by South Vietnamese
forces.
In Cambodia, insurgents pressed a week-long
attack on Phnom Penh the central target of what
observers say is a dry-season offensive paralleling the
Communist offensive in Vietnam.
Israeli: Syrians Aiding Guerrillas
JERUSALEM Israeli Defense Minister Shimon
Peres said yesterday that Palestinian guerrillas in
Lebanon have been reinforced by Palestinian troops
from Syria armed with sophisticated missiles.
He warned Lebanon and Syria that Israel would

see any attempt by the Syrian army "to- take a
foothold" outside Syrian borders as "the start of a
confrontation and the extension of aggression."
However, in the address to parliament, Peres did
not specify whether the Palestinians that he said
recently arrived at southern Lebanese guerrilla bases
were part of a Palestinian unit of the Syrian army.
He said they were armed with antitank and
antiaircraft missiles.
Peres spoke shortly after the commander of the
border police reported that new secret measures had
provided an early detection system against guerrilla
infiltration and had effectively halted terrorists'
raids.
Peres told the Knesset, the Israeli parliament,
that Israel had "no designs on Lebanese
sovereignty" but that the guerrillas "constitute a
threat to Israel's own security and peace along its
northern border."

Auto Industry Sales Decline
DETROIT The nation's auto companies,
plagued by inflation, energy shortages and growing
recession, reported yesterday a 23 percent sales
decline for 1974 from the year before. It was their
second worst sales performance in 11 years.
December sales of 429,198 were off 25 percent
from December 1973, when the industry began to
feel the painful effects of the energy crisis.
Although last month's sales were the second
lowest for a December in 15 years, company
executives predicted yesterday that the worst of the
14-month sales slump was behind them.
But industry spokesmen said there will be further
production cutbacks and worker layoffs if the sales
decline continues.
Because of declining output, the companies
already have scheduled massive furloughs that will
leave 280,000 of 678,000 hourly workers in the
country on layoff for at least part of this month.
New Contraceptive Developed
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. Scientists say they have
developed a self-dissolving birth control capsule that
is expected to work for a year or longer when
implanted under a woman's skin.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
researchers say the capsules, designed to eliminate
the need to remove a plastic shell after the
contraceptive is exhausted, have so far proved 100
percent effective in rats and dogs. They estimate
that testing in humans is three years away, after
more tests in dogs and tests with monkeys.
In addition to eliminating the need to take a pill
daily, the scientists say their system may have fewer
unpleasant side effects than daily contraceptives
because the total hormone dose over a long period
of time would be much less.
Older-style plastic capsules designed for
long-term contraception must be removed after
their contents are exhausted and sometimes cause
irritation under the skin.

SACRAMENTO California's first black
lieutenant governor and its first Asian-American
secretary of state took office yesterday as

constitutional offices.

Unruh, the once powerful speaker of the California
Assembly.

Unruh said, "I've missed being in Sacramento, in the
middle of the decision making arena.

he said. "It's where I feel most comfortable."
Mervyn Dymally, a Trinidad-born Los Angeles
state senator, took office as lieutenant governor,
promising to use his post to work on the state's
economic problems.
March Fong Eu, the Democratic daughter of a
Chinese laundry man, said she would use the muscle
of the secretary of state's job to push for tough
election law enforcement.
Also taking office yesterday was Controller Ken
Cory, a Democrat who said during his campaign that
he would be tough on the oil companies.
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, the only Republican

they are eligible.
Goodell announced at a news conference that the
board is mailing to all the nation's radio and
television stations tapes telling about the program
and urging the stations to play them often as a
public service.
"It would be an additional service if your station
announcer could do a countdown i.e., only 14
more days left to apply to the Presidential
Clemency Board. Time is running out," said a letter
Goodell sent to each station With the tapes. The
deadline is Jan. 31.

there are too many strings attached to the money.

$787 million yesterday to provide another 100,000
jobs.
