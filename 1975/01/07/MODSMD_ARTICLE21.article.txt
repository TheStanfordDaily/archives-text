# PIRG Chapter Opens Tresidder Office Space
## 
### 
The Stanford chapter of the Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG) has
announced plans to release Thursday
results of a study conducted on
gasoline mileage claims of automobile
dealers.
The organization has now opened
an office in Tresidder Memorial Union.
Jack Handy, currently serving as
PIRG secretary for the mid-Peninsula
area, also said that at least two studies
were under consideration for winter
quarter.
PIRG conducted three projects
during the fall quarter, one of which
included gathering information on
local gasoline prices and truth in
lending.
Roger Telschow, a graduate of the
University of Michigan and PIRG
director in this region, used
information gathered by the local
chapter in recent Congressional
hearings on gas mileage claims in
Washington D.C.

As many as 15 student volunteers
have been involved in the PIRG studies
since the program's inception last
spring.
Handy, Telschow and Lee Jones,
project director, will meet today for
preliminary discussions on the
upcoming studies.
"We expect to do a price survey on
toiletries in the San Jose area," Handy
said. "We have found a price
differential of 38 percent on some
commodities in that area." Also on tap
is a study of business
misrepresentation of hearing aids. At
least one member of the Stanford
faculty has expressed interest in
working on the project.
The new office will be' staffed on a
half- or three-quarter basis, depending
on available funding, according to
Handy. Funded by the national
organization, the program was
established last spring when approved
by the ASSU Council of Presidents.
