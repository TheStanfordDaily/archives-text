# Ad Hoc Panel Studying Grading System Recommends 'Drop Deadline' For Classes
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
The Ad Hoc Panel to Study the
Grading System has virtually
completed its report, recommending
that the University reinstate a "drop
deadline" for classes and a "no credit"
notation on the student's transcript if
he or she drops or fails a course after
that deadline.
But the controversial proposal for a
return to the "historical record" still
faces considerable debate on the
committee and Faculty Senate levels.
The recommendations, which
squeaked through by a 5-4 panel vote,
will be sent to the parent Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA), scheduled to
meet on J*n. 15.
C-AAA Chairman, Physics Prof.
Alexander Fetter, said yesterday he
hopes the committee will be able to
report to the Faculty Senate by the
beginning of March.
The University presently utilizes a
"record of achievement" system
adopted in 1970, under which a "no
credit" notation of the student's
failure to satisfactorily complete a
course does not appear on the
transcript.
The ad hoc panel also unanimously
advised that use of the incomplete "I"
grade should be "restricted to cases
where the student has completed a
substantial portion of the course work
at a passing level."
The faculty-student-administration
panel urged that the time limit for
fulfilling the incomplete should be no
more than one calendar year from the
date of the final exam.
If the drop deadline and "no
credit" notation are reinstated, the
panel agreed that completed
incompletes should appear on the
transcript as an "I" crossed out with
the letter grade next to it.
The drop deadline date should be
the same as that currently in force for
adding courses, the report states.
Because of the close vote, the panel
will submit both majority and
minority reports along with the
recommendations to the C-AAA.
Some members fear that the five

faculty, who all come from the
math-science domain, might have
shown a bias toward the complex and
controversial issue another reason to
present both sides.
On the C-AAA, five of the seven
voting faculty members also come
from the math-science field. Chairman
Fetter indicated that the C-AAA might
thus provide a majority-minority
report to the Faculty Senate.
None of the panel members
contacted would predict whether the
Faculty Senate would vote to adopt
the recommended historical record
system. "The Senate is very
unpredictable on issues like this,"
noted Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron,
who chairs the ad hoc panel.
Efron's poll of 100 faculty
members last fall indicated they were
divided over whether to reinstate the
historical record system. Of 69 faculty
responding, 25 preferred the record of
achievement, 15 selected the historical

record, 20 were indifferent, seven
liked neither system and two did not
comment.
Moreover, 33 faculty preferred
allowing the student to drop a course
any time before the final exam, 21
favored a definite drop deadline, 12
were indifferent and three liked
neither system.
Panel members agree that the
division over the system centers
around whether the present transcript
is corqplete enough without mention
of courses the student has dropped or
failed.
Those who favor a return to the
historical record believe the student's
transcript should contain as much
information as possible for future
evaluation.
"The present Stanford transcript,
presenting as it does only positive
information, withholds data that
would ... be valuable in selection and
admission processes. Thus, omission of

negative data penalizes students witn
the best Records," the majority report
says.
It adds that the present record of
achievement system arose in an effort
to "provide the poorly prepared
student time to catch up with his
classmates without indicators of
failure appearing on his record.
'fit seems to us, however, that good
advising and the auditing option could
ameliorate the effect" of having a "no
credit" notation appear on the
transcript.
Advocates of this position also
contend that students should be
forced to make a definite choice on
whether or not to stay in a class
toward the middle of the quarter
rather than decide more casually at the
end of the term.
Assoc. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Mason Yearian, who four years
ago supported the record of
achievement system, says he has
changed his mind because he no longer
believes students should be allowed to
take courses a number of times
knowing that their failure to complete
a course will not appear on the
transcripts. .
"It's a waste of the student's time,"
Yearian said. "We should make the
student drop the course at a more
reasonable time or encourage him to
finish," Yearian said.
Supporters of the present record of
achievement system say it allows
students to attempt to pass a valuable

but difficult course without penalty
for failing it or dropping it.
The minority report emphasizes
that "increased recognition of grades
as a measure of intellectual
accomplishment rather than as a
disciplinary tool" will result in an
improvement of the teacher-student
relationship.
It continues that the present system
eliminates a large amount of academic
bookkeeping, and "of the occasional
but genuine inequities this system and
the attendant apparatus of
committees, petitions, etc.
engendered."
