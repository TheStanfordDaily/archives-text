# Only 90 Students
## Unaware Lose Housing Priorities 
### JOHN FREED 
If you spent last quarter off campus, watching
your name creep slowly toward the top of a
housing waitlist, hoping against hope that -
somehow you'd get assigned soon, then you're
out of luck.
Unless, that is, you reconfirmed your position
before last Sunday at 5 p.m. Only about 90
students did so, setting themselves up for possible
assignment to University housing this week.
Sue Espinosa of the single student housing
office says she expects a flurry of activity during
the week.
"If we have any spaces, we'll offer them as they
become available. Many spaces occur when people
don't come back or forget to notify us that they're
dropping out of the housing system," she
explained.
One Week Wait
Persons who want to switch residences within
the system will have to wait at least until next
week before assignments will be made.

"We're not looking at them until the system
calms down," remarked Espinosa. "We may start
with them by the second week of the quarter."
Off-campus students on the waitlists 56 men
(including 10 transfer students) and 31 women
(including 10 transfers) will be assigned spaces
on a daily basis, Espinosa noted. Three women
were assigned yesterday.
No 'Bump' Chains
Assignments must be confirmed by 5 p.m. on
the same day assignment is made. Otherwise, the
housing office warns, the assignee loses the space
offered, a $lO assessment for failing to confirm
the assignment, position on the waitlist and all
accumulated priorities.
When movement within the housing system
begins, Espinosa claimed, the housing office will
not seek out "bump" chains in which a series of
simultaneous reassignments would leave everyone
in the chain with spaces requested.
"We don't look for a bump chain someone in

Twain wants a space in Lathrop and someone in
Lathrop wants a space in Storey and so on. We
start with a vacancy in the system and go on from
there," Espinosa said.
Handled Separately
Graduate students are handled on waitlists
separately from undergraduates, but the same
timetable applies to them, according to Espinosa.
"Graduates are assigned to different living
units, so they're handled separately," Espinosa
explained. "We're following the same schedule
with them, however."
Students currently on the winter quarter
waitlists are allowed to postpone their chance to
get on-campus housing until spring quarter,
according to Espinosa.
Students who wish to defer their applications
until spring quarter may do so at any time without
loss of position or priority, according to housing
office notices.

accumulated priorities.
When movement within the housing system
begins, Espinosa claimed, the housing office will
not seek out "bump" chains in which a series of
simultaneous reassignments would leave everyone
in the chain with spaces requested.
"We don't look for a bump chain someone in

Twain wants a space in Lathrop and someone in
Lathrop wants a space in Storey and so on. We
start with a vacancy in the system and go on from
there," Espinosa said.
Handled Separately
Graduate students are handled on waitlists
separately from undergraduates, but the same
timetable applies to them, according to Espinosa.
"Graduates are assigned to different living
units, so they're handled separately," Espinosa
explained. "We're following the same schedule
with them, however."
Students currently on the winter quarter
waitlists are allowed to postpone their chance to
get on-campus housing until spring quarter,
according to Espinosa.
Students who wish to defer their applications
until spring quarter may do so at any time without
loss of position or priority, according to housing
office notices.
If you spent last quarter off campus, watching
your name creep slowly toward the top of a
housing waitlist, hoping against hope that -
somehow you'd get assigned soon, then you're
out of luck.
Unless, that is, you reconfirmed your position
before last Sunday at 5 p.m. Only about 90
students did so, setting themselves up for possible
assignment to University housing this week.
Sue Espinosa of the single student housing
office says she expects a flurry of activity during
the week.
"If we have any spaces, we'll offer them as they
become available. Many spaces occur when people
don't come back or forget to notify us that they're
dropping out of the housing system," she
explained.
One Week Wait
Persons who want to switch residences within
the system will have to wait at least until next
week before assignments will be made.

"We're not looking at them until the system
calms down," remarked Espinosa. "We may start
with them by the second week of the quarter."
Off-campus students on the waitlists 56 men
(including 10 transfer students) and 31 women
(including 10 transfers) will be assigned spaces
on a daily basis, Espinosa noted. Three women
were assigned yesterday.
No 'Bump' Chains
Assignments must be confirmed by 5 p.m. on
the same day assignment is made. Otherwise, the
housing office warns, the assignee loses the space
offered, a $lO assessment for failing to confirm
the assignment, position on the waitlist and all
accumulated priorities.
