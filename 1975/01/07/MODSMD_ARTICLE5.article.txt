# City Council Postpones Willow Road Decision
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
The Palo Alto City Council early
this morning failed to reach a final
decision concerning the proposed
widening of Willow Road between
Arboretum Road and El Camino Real,
tabling the matter until next week.
After 2V2 hours of late-night
discussion, eight members of the
nine-member council remained
entangled in an issue which has
spawned seven different proposals and
a minor uproar in the community.
The city proposes to widen Willow
Road to a 90-foot-wide , four-lane,
right-of-way. The issue is particularly
complicated because opposition has
appeared not only to the widening
itself, but to each of the seven
proposals.
One of the proposals, which
involves use of Stanford shopping
center property, is opposed by the
University; other proposals
encroaching on nearby San
Francisquito Creek or requiring the
destruction of numerous trees and
shrubs have drawn objections from
conservation-minded citizens.
No Council Settlement
The Council had hoped to settle the
matter last night, ending a long and

tedious battle.
Instead, it spent the night
listening to a lengthy presentation by
the city's engineering consultants, an
hour-and-a-half of private statements,
and a 17-minute speech by
councilwoman Enid Pearson, who
proposed that the matter be turned
over to the City Planning Commission.
After Pearson's speech,
Vice-Mayor Alan Henderson, presiding
over the meeting, moved to adjourn
the meeting, and after councilmembers
John Beahrs and Kirke ComstOck
expressed their impatience with
Pearson's monopolization of the last
minutes of the meetings the Council
voted the adjournment.
Sher Didn't Participate
Mayor Byron Sher did not
participate in the discussion. Sher,
who normally votes as a member of
the council, left the meeting when the
Willow Road issue was taken up
because of a conflict of interest (he is
a Stanford law school professor, and
the University has a major interest in
the matter, since it owns the property
adjacent to Willow Road).
About 20 private citizens and
representatives of civic and
environmentalist groups presented

their views during the discussion. Most
of those speaking touched on the
subject of increased traffic as a result
of widening or on the desirability of
keeping the open space along San
Francisquito Creek intact.
One of those who spoke, Joe
Carlton, cited past council policy
aimed toward the reduction of
automobile use. "More auto facilities
are an anachronism," he told the
Council.
* 'Willow Expressway'
Other Palo Alto residents added
that the proposed widening would be
only the, first in a series and that a
"Willow Expressway" would be the
end result. Ellen Fletcher told the
council, "We're opening up an anthill
here," and later added, "We're using
up funds in away that's reckless and
irresponsible."
Many stated their desire to see as
few trees as possible destroyed and as
much open space as possible preserved.
Some proposed that this be done
by adopting Alternate A, a proposal
which would encroach on the present
Stanford shopping center parking lot
but leave the greenery untouched. As
one citizen put it, "Parking spaces are
not on the list of endangered species,
but open spaces in Palo Alto certainly
are."
University Officials Intense
University officials have watched
developments in the matter with
intense interest. Their major concern is
for the well-being of Stanford
shopping center proprietors and
residents of the area who are plagued
by heavy traffic on Willow Road,
which is now only two lanes.
Andrew Doty, director of
Community Relations for the
University, said the meeting "was
disappointing. At prior meetings, there
had been substantial representation
from the shopping Center and others
concerned about the traffic problem.
But tonight it seemed to be mostly the
people who oppose widening who did
the talking."
When asked why the shopkeepers
were so poorly represented, Doty said,
"They felt the Council had reached a
decision in November to carry out the
widening. But tonight we found that
there is still a lot of opposition to the
widening itself."
