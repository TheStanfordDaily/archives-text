# Wells Fargo Cuts Service To Students
## 
### 
The Stanford branch of Wells Fargo
Bank has reduced many of its services
for students, faculty and staff in
response to experience that proved
past policy "too liberal."
Effective Dec. 9, 1974, the bank
dropped its check-cashing limit for
non-customers from $lOO to $5O,
instituted a $5 service charge on
returned checks and stopped cashing
most two-party checks for
non-customers.
Stanford Branch Manager Roger
Adams explained that "we've been in
operation two years, and our
experiepce over those two years
indicated that our policies were too
liberal. Our whole philosophy is to
accommodate the entire campus
community, but we have to mix that
With accepted banking principles."
Adams pointed out that the new
$5O check-cashing limit is still more
liberal than any student service in the
country, according to a recent survey
conducted by the Association of
College Unions International. "The
closest thing to our policy is a $25
limit with a check-cashing charge of
anywhere from 15 to 25 cents,"
Adams said.
The University mildly objected to
the change in policy, according to
Director of Finance Rodney Adams,
"but there was nothing we could do
legally to stop them. The University's
contract with the bank simply requires
that they provide a check-cashing
service for the, campus community; it
doesn't specify any details," he said.
Roger Adams said that certain
exceptions will be made to the new
policy regarding two-party checks. He
indicated that Stanford payroll checks
would be cashed, and checks from a
student's parent would "probably" be
cashed, if the student had a valid ID
card and the check was cleared
through an officer of the bank.
Rodney Adams expressed hope that
the new policy isn't "cast and concrete
with the bank. Frankly, I'd like to see
a higher limit returned in the future,"
he said, "but I respect their desire to
protect themselves."
