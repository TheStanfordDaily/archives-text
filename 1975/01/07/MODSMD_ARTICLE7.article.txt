# Food Day' Plan
## 
### Coffin, et. al 
Soaring food prices, increasing
world food shortages and
mounting evidence of the
dangerous health effects of the
overly processed and refined
American diet indicate that, if left
to its own devices, the federal
government will not take the steps
necessary to develop a responsible
food policy.
The food industry the
corporations that bring you
Cool-Whip and Twinkies have
sold Americans on a diet of
sugar-laden, fat-rich
"convenience" foods that are
contributing to a national
epidemic of heart disease,
diabetes, hypertension and
obesity.
While encouraging unhealthy
eating habits through advertising
and availability, these
corporations are also contributing
to high food prices. A Federal
Trade Commission study
estimates that consumers were
overcharged $2 billion in 1972,
because of the monopolistic
structure of several segments of
the food industry.
Recognition of Dilemma
As government and corporate
decision-makers allow the food
situation to deteriorate further, it
becomes clear that individuals and
organizations in communities and
campuses across the nation will
have to begin a massive education
effort.
This effort will be aimed at
changing personal eating habits;
improving food welfare programs;
reforming corporations that
promote the sale of billions of
dollars worth of nutritionally
empty, resource-squandering junk
foods; investigating the energy
and resource intensive practices
of agribusiness that are forcing
small farmers off the land; and
developing national policies which
recognize the needs of hungry
people at home and abroad.
National Effort Needed
This job requires a national
organizing effort. The non-profit
Center for Science in the Public
Interest, in conjunction with
dozens of other groups and
individuals, is building a
movement to take on this task, a
movement that will blossom on
Food Day, a national day of
action on the food crisis. Food
Day is set for April 17.
We hope that college and
university students will take part
in Food Day, using their campuses
as organizing focal points for both
campus- and community-oriented
activities. As a first step in
accomplishing this, we urge
students and faculty to set up
joint committees to investigate
what can be done at your campus,
such as creating a
campus-community garden or
food co-op initiating sweeping

changes in university food-buying
policies, or planning massive
teach-ins for April 17.
Students at the Universities of
Michigan and Wisconsin are
already planning teach-ins for
next spring At Yale, a
student-faculty committee has
planned a six-week
lecture-discussion series on world
food problems and has already
organized a fast in which over
2000 students participated.
Problems And Solutions
The food problems which face
the nation and the world demand
immediate action, and there are
dozens of things you can do now.
These include:
—Write to President Ford and
urge him to make additional food
aid available to needy nations as
soon as possible. Urge your
university president or student
council to do likewise.
—Find out how much fertilizer
your university uses to keep its
lawns green, and request that such
wasteful use of this
critically-needed resource be
halted.
—Request that at least half the
selections in vending machines on
campus contain wholesome snack
foods fruit, fruit juice, yogurt,
unsalted nuts and seeds, etc.
instead of junk foods.
—Contact local consumer,
environmental, or Public Interest
Research Groups (PIRG) to find
out what activities can be
undertaken in your community.
Balking At Waste
Initial Food Day actions may
not make headlines or
immediately change federal or
corporate policies, but they will
put decision-makers on notice
that the American public is no
longer willing to participate in the
wasteful use of food resources.
The rise of the environmental
movement and the end to direct
American involvement in the
Vietnam War are directly
traceable to campus activity.
The students of America can
once again make a commitment to
actions that can result in
long-overdue changes in the way
in which the federal government,
corporate America and
individuals decide how and to
whom food will be allocated.
Food Day national offices are
open at 1785 Massachusetts Ave.
NW, Room 206, Washington, D.C.
20036. If you are interested in
organizing Food Day teach-ins or
other activities, contact the office
for further information and
organizing suggestions.
