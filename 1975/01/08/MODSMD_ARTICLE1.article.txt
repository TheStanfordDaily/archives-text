# New Grade Poll: 3.4
## A's Outnumber B's, C's Combined 
### JIM WASCHER 
The average undergraduate here
compiled a 3.4 letter grade average
during the 1973-74 academic year,
according to calculations made by the
Daily based upon a computer survey
taken by the Registrar's Office. The
survey covered all grades given during
that period.
To compute the average, the Daily
only counted the letter grades A, B
and C, and did not include
I incompletes, no credits and other
! grades. Only A's, B's, C's and
incompletes currently appear on an
undergraduate's grade transcript.
Also, in order to simplify the
| calculation process, the Daily assumed
that all courses numbered 001-199
were taken only by undergraduates
and that all courses numbered 200 and
above were taken only by graduate
students. According to the Registrar's
Office, however, there is overlap
between the two fields.
Also, according to the Registrar's
Office survey, 41 percent of all grades
given during the 1973-74 academic
I year were A's, 31 percent were B's and
| eight percent were C's.
A "semi-random" survey released
i last October had indicated that the
[ typical undergraduate compiled a 3.55
Better grade average during autumn
\ quarter of 1973.
200 Grade Reports
The earlier survey was conducted
Iby Statistics Prof Bradley Efron,
; chairman of the Faculty Senate's Ad
| Hoc Panel to Study the Grading
\ System. Efron sampled 200 grade
j reports during his survey. f
Efron's panel recently
recommended that the University
reinstate a "drop deadline" for classes
and a no credit notation on a student's
transcript if he or she drops or does
not pass a course after that deadline.
Apparently, the data from the
I Registrar's Office will not have any
| impact upon the panel's
\ recommendations. When contacted
Bast night, Efron said "the panel saw
\ those figures last quarter, so they have
| already had whatever effect they're
i going to have."
Grades 'Pretty High'
Despite the disparity between his
\ survey and the one conducted by the
I Daily, Efron said grades "are still
\ pretty high any way you look at it."

He added that the Registrar's Office
survey "still indicates that C's are
hardly given at all."
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA)
is scheduled to review the Efron
panel's recommendations next week.
When asked whether the new grade
survey would have any effect upon
their deliberations, Efron said "maybe
peqple will feel better looking at a
lower figure."
History Department Chairman
Gordon A. Craig, also chairman of the
Faculty Senate, said last night that he
doubts whether the disparity between
the two surveys will have any
significant impact upon the Senate's
deliberations.
Troubled
"I don't think that that is going to
make much difference on what the
vote would have been before," Craig
commented. "Personally, I would
think that a B+ average is too high."
He said he was particularly troubled
that the total number of A's given
exceeded the total number of B's and

C's combined.
According to Craig, many members
of the Senate are concerned that
"some people who are very good
students are not being differentiated as
such."
The calculations made by the Daily
based upon the Registrar's Office's
data indicates that undergraduates
taking courses at the School of
Education received the highest grades
during the period in question,
averaging 3.76, while undergraduates
taking Law School courses received
the lowest grades, averaging only 2.96.
Undergraduates in the School of
Humanities and Sciences compiled a
3.41 letter grade average. The
Engineering School undergraduate
averaged 3.35 and Earth Sciences
undergrads averaged 3.36.
Undergraduates taking courses in the
School of Medicine averaged 3.64.
The survey also indicated that
students tended to receive their
highest grades during spring quarter,
followed by winter and autumn
quarters.

survey would have any effect upon
their deliberations, Efron said "maybe
peqple will feel better looking at a
lower figure."
History Department Chairman
Gordon A. Craig, also chairman of the
Faculty Senate, said last night that he
doubts whether the disparity between
the two surveys will have any
significant impact upon the Senate's
deliberations.
Troubled
"I don't think that that is going to
make much difference on what the
vote would have been before," Craig
commented. "Personally, I would
think that a B+ average is too high."
He said he was particularly troubled
that the total number of A's given
exceeded the total number of B's and

C's combined.
According to Craig, many members
of the Senate are concerned that
"some people who are very good
students are not being differentiated as
such."
The calculations made by the Daily
based upon the Registrar's Office's
data indicates that undergraduates
taking courses at the School of
Education received the highest grades
during the period in question,
averaging 3.76, while undergraduates
taking Law School courses received
the lowest grades, averaging only 2.96.
Undergraduates in the School of
Humanities and Sciences compiled a
3.41 letter grade average. The
Engineering School undergraduate
averaged 3.35 and Earth Sciences
undergrads averaged 3.36.
Undergraduates taking courses in the
School of Medicine averaged 3.64.
The survey also indicated that
students tended to receive their
highest grades during spring quarter,
followed by winter and autumn
quarters.

The average undergraduate here
compiled a 3.4 letter grade average
during the 1973-74 academic year,
according to calculations made by the
Daily based upon a computer survey
taken by the Registrar's Office. The
survey covered all grades given during
that period.
To compute the average, the Daily
only counted the letter grades A, B
and C, and did not include
I incompletes, no credits and other
! grades. Only A's, B's, C's and
incompletes currently appear on an
undergraduate's grade transcript.
Also, in order to simplify the
| calculation process, the Daily assumed
that all courses numbered 001-199
were taken only by undergraduates
and that all courses numbered 200 and
above were taken only by graduate
students. According to the Registrar's
Office, however, there is overlap
between the two fields.
Also, according to the Registrar's
Office survey, 41 percent of all grades
given during the 1973-74 academic
I year were A's, 31 percent were B's and
| eight percent were C's.
A "semi-random" survey released
i last October had indicated that the
[ typical undergraduate compiled a 3.55
Better grade average during autumn
\ quarter of 1973.
200 Grade Reports
The earlier survey was conducted
Iby Statistics Prof Bradley Efron,
; chairman of the Faculty Senate's Ad
| Hoc Panel to Study the Grading
\ System. Efron sampled 200 grade
j reports during his survey. f
Efron's panel recently
recommended that the University
reinstate a "drop deadline" for classes
and a no credit notation on a student's
transcript if he or she drops or does
not pass a course after that deadline.
Apparently, the data from the
I Registrar's Office will not have any
| impact upon the panel's
\ recommendations. When contacted
Bast night, Efron said "the panel saw
\ those figures last quarter, so they have
| already had whatever effect they're

only counted the letter grades A, B
and C, and did not include
I incompletes, no credits and other
! grades. Only A's, B's, C's and
incompletes currently appear on an
undergraduate's grade transcript.
Also, in order to simplify the
| calculation process, the Daily assumed
that all courses numbered 001-199
were taken only by undergraduates
and that all courses numbered 200 and
above were taken only by graduate
students. According to the Registrar's
Office, however, there is overlap
between the two fields.
Also, according to the Registrar's
Office survey, 41 percent of all grades
given during the 1973-74 academic
I year were A's, 31 percent were B's and
| eight percent were C's.
A "semi-random" survey released
i last October had indicated that the
[ typical undergraduate compiled a 3.55
Better grade average during autumn
\ quarter of 1973.
200 Grade Reports
The earlier survey was conducted
Iby Statistics Prof Bradley Efron,
; chairman of the Faculty Senate's Ad
| Hoc Panel to Study the Grading
\ System. Efron sampled 200 grade
j reports during his survey. f
Efron's panel recently
recommended that the University
reinstate a "drop deadline" for classes
and a no credit notation on a student's
transcript if he or she drops or does
not pass a course after that deadline.
Apparently, the data from the
I Registrar's Office will not have any
| impact upon the panel's
\ recommendations. When contacted
Bast night, Efron said "the panel saw
\ those figures last quarter, so they have
| already had whatever effect they're
i going to have."
Grades 'Pretty High'
Despite the disparity between his
\ survey and the one conducted by the
I Daily, Efron said grades "are still
\ pretty high any way you look at it."

He added that the Registrar's Office
survey "still indicates that C's are
hardly given at all."
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA)
is scheduled to review the Efron
panel's recommendations next week.
When asked whether the new grade
survey would have any effect upon
their deliberations, Efron said "maybe
peqple will feel better looking at a
lower figure."
History Department Chairman
Gordon A. Craig, also chairman of the
Faculty Senate, said last night that he
doubts whether the disparity between
the two surveys will have any
significant impact upon the Senate's
deliberations.
Troubled
"I don't think that that is going to
make much difference on what the
vote would have been before," Craig
commented. "Personally, I would
think that a B+ average is too high."
He said he was particularly troubled
that the total number of A's given
exceeded the total number of B's and

C's combined.
According to Craig, many members
of the Senate are concerned that
"some people who are very good
students are not being differentiated as
such."
The calculations made by the Daily
based upon the Registrar's Office's
data indicates that undergraduates
taking courses at the School of
Education received the highest grades
during the period in question,
averaging 3.76, while undergraduates
taking Law School courses received
the lowest grades, averaging only 2.96.
Undergraduates in the School of
Humanities and Sciences compiled a
3.41 letter grade average. The
Engineering School undergraduate
averaged 3.35 and Earth Sciences
undergrads averaged 3.36.
Undergraduates taking courses in the
School of Medicine averaged 3.64.
The survey also indicated that
students tended to receive their
highest grades during spring quarter,
followed by winter and autumn
quarters.
