# Buckley Measure Violates Privacy
## 
### William Ross 
Attempting to protect individual privacy
by forcing schools to open their files to
students, Congress in the Buckley Act
ironically has violated the privacy of writers
of student recommendations to universities.
The authors of such letters penned their
comments assuming that their opinions
would remain forever confidential.
In response to nearly unanimous
opposition from college administrators, the
Senate last month wisely amended the Act to
correct this abuse. Recommendations
delivered to a university before Jan. 1 will
now remain sealed.
Furthermore, students applying to college
are permitted to waive their right to see their
although no university can
make the signing of a waiver a condition for
admission.
The Buckley Act, conceived by New
York's Conservative Sen. James Buckley, and
supported such venerable groups as the
American Civil Liberties Union, is part of a
larger effort by conservatives and liberals
alike to eliminate the specter of Big Brother
bureaucracy.
While this is a legitimate concern, the act
plainly goes too far by destroying the
confidentiality of recommendations
submitted after Jan. 1. Since such letters are
used only in the admissions process, they
cannot haunt people throughout their lives.
Furthermore, one must assume that the
letters are almost entirely highly favorable.
Students usually solicit recommendations
only from those instructors who teach
subjects in which the student has excelled. If
a student has displayed mediocre talents in
front of a teacher, he probably won't request
a recommendation.
Occasionally, some instructors no doubt

write unfavorable and false
recommendations that may unfairly prevent
a person from gaining admission to a college.
But most schools require that a student
submit several recommendations, thereby
reducing the likelihood that a bad
recommendation will persuade admissions
officials to reject an applicant.
The damage done to the admissions
process by opening the files clearly outweighs
the dangers of an unfavorable
recommendation.
When students are allowed to see their
files, recommendations will lose most of their
meaning, since only the bravest writer will
dare to discuss an applicants strengths and
weaknesses in a candid manner.
Recommendations are too subjective to
occupy a major place in the admissions
process, but they rightfully carry some
weight and it would be sad to see them lose
it. Grades and test scores occupy an
increasingly important place in this process;
recommendations are one of the few chances
for university officials to receive information
on*"the' character and special talents of the
applicant.
Most of the Buckley Act's proponents see
themselves as crusaders against the cold
objectivity of a world in which people are
often treated as faceless numbers. Yet the
Buckley Act will effectively destroy the
validity of recommendations, a major
expression of individualism. Perhaps this is
the greatest irony of the act.
But although the Senate was remiss in
failing to consult university officials while
considering the legislation, the latter should
have issued their protests when the bill was
under consideration. Most of the furor
created by the matter occurred after the bill's

passage on Aug. 17.
According to the New York Times, "the
well organized higher education organizations
in Washington failed to notice its possible
consequences until after it became law."
Buckley claims he and other senators were
unaware of the attitude on university
officials and insists that the Act's worst
abuses were "unintended." Perhaps this will
teach university administrators to watch
Capitol Hill more closely.
Finally, the protests over the Act's
desecration of recommendations has
obscured its real merits. In addition to giving
parents of elementary and secondary school
children "the right to inspect and review any
and all official records," the Act provides for
a hearing in cases in which a student or
parent wishes to challenge a record.
The Act also forces parties outside an
educational institution to receive written
permission from a student in order to see a
file; previously, it was relatively simply to
obtain access to a file. Furthermore, the
legislation rightly prohibits the release of
general information on students unless a
university obtains student permission.
The director of admissions at Princeton
has compared the Buckley Act to "swatting a
fly with a steamroller." This remark,
reflecting much of higher education's
attitude toward the Act, is not only trite, but
also false.
The Buckley Act corrects many abuses. It
is unfortunate however, that even after the
passage of the amendments, it seems certain
to destroy the value of recommendations in
the admissions process.
