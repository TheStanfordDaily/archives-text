# Third World Upholds U.N. Tradition
## 
### Syed Mohammed Tariq 
Delegates of the Third World
countries have rightly taken
exception to U.N. Ambassador
John Scali's denunciation of the
Third World's role in the United
Nations. In saying that the
Americans were becoming
disenchanted with the United
Nations because of
"unenforceable, one-sided
resolutions" and "the tyranny of
the majority," Scali was merely
giving vent to the feelings of his
government over several decisions
taken by the General Assembly
which run counter to his
country's foreign policy.
American disenchantment with
the United Nations is not entirely
new; it may be traced to the entry
of so many newly-independent,
non-aligned States which greatly
eroded American chances of
usually commanding an almost
automatic majority in the world
body.
The disenchantment of some
western powers is not attributable
to the United Nation's failure to
act effectively on vital issues
concerning peace and security in
the world but to the fact that it
no longer is the forum the "Big
Powers" could manipulate at will.
The sense of frustration that this
powerful minority in the United
Nations seems now to be suffering
from can only be put down to
their refusal to come to terms
with the changed reality in the
world the emergence of the
Third World as an effective global
force. Comprising more than 100
developing countries in Asia,
Africa and Latin America, the
Third World represents the
overwhelming majority of the
world population.
But it is not the number alone
that lends strength to the Third
World; it is the spirit of unity in
its struggle against colonialism and

neo-colonialism, international
Zionism and racism that has made
it a force that can no longer be
ignored or bypassed in any major
decisions affecting the destiny of
the World community.
It is a gross distortion of fact
to say that the United Nation's
General Assembly was shackled
by "the tyranny of the majority."
An impartial study of the voting
record of the current Assembly
session would clearly disprove
such an accusation. The united
stand taken by the Third World
countries should not be
interpreted as a manifestation of
unthinking group loyalty. They -
are determined to see that the
laudable objects of the United
Nation charter do not merely
remain a pious wish but are really
translated into reality.
They have every reason to be
wary of the so-called force of

persuasion that the Big Powers
would like to use in respect of
recalcitrant members, a policy
which has miserably failed to have
any effect either on India, which
has consistently denied the right
of self-determination to the
oppressed people of Kashmir in
contradiction to the United
Nations resolutions, or Tel Aviv,
to name only two implacable
violators of United Nations
resolutions. In contrast, the
General Assembly's recent action
against South Africa has yielded
definite result in bringing a visible
change in the outlook of Pretoria.
It is the Big Powers which had
often condemned the General
Assembly as being only a debating
forum. It is indeed an ironic
reversal of that position to call it
now a tool in the hands of the
majority when it takes definitive
action on any matter, simply

because that action does not
conform to the global strategy
and ambitions of the powerful
minority.
The Big Powers will do well to
adjust themselves to the profound
change that has been taking place
in the international situation. The
world order founded at the end of
the Second World War no longer
exists. With its demise has ended
the era of domination by a small
club of big powers which must
show prudence and resist the
temptation of translating their
resentment of change into a move
to downgrade the world body.
Nobody is going to gain anything
if the United Nations meets the
fate of its predecessor, the League
of Nations.
