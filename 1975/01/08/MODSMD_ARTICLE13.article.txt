# Chinese Reject Individualism

In the Dec. 15, San Francisco
Examiner-Chronicle University
President Richard Lyman is
quoted:

"How does one interpret the
fact that one cannot get from any
[university] student [in China]
an answer to theiquestion, "What
would you like to do after you've
finished the university? What sort
of work?" other than the
statement, "I want to do whatever
the party and the revolution need
of me?' "
No doubt such a rhetorical
question is meant to hint at the
lack of "freedom" in the People's

Republic, to hint that individuals
in China are either too afraid or
too will-less to express personal
desire. There are, however,
alternative ways to "interpret"
Lyman's fact.
Perhaps it means that people
are not free to become socially
honorable and financially
comfortable professionals by
joining professions.
Perhaps it means that, at least
somewhere in the world, the
notion of happiness is being
slowly dissociated from the
fulfillment of personal desire,
especially personal desire which is

actually engendered from the
outside, from the exploiters and
the purveyors of artificial needs.
Perhaps it means that, given
the opportunity to confront a
society so different from ours as
China's is, our aim should not be
to stand with feet planted in our
basic beliefs in individual liberty
and equal opportunity (ignoring
how bankrupt these beliefs are in
practice) and ask seemingly
bewildered but implicitly critical
questions of that society.
Rather our aim should be to
try harder to understand how a
student can come to the point of

making such a reply, not out of
fear, not out of cynical knowledge
of the ideologically correct
answer, but in good faith, in the
genuine belief that his desire for
personal aggrandizement and
immortality is a relatively
unimportant one.
After looking hard at how such
a strange way of thinking can be
made to seem natural, we can
perhaps then look back at our
own feet, where they are planted,
and wonder whether we are
rooted in bedrock or only in tar
and asphalt.
