# Cards Receive No 'Rah'

In the Daily's basketball issue
of Dec. 15, reporter Stan Wilson
wrote about Home Court
Advantage (HCA) as something
Stanford does not have. With this
observation I wholeheartedly
agree, but trying to say why is
extraordinarily difficult.
Certainly Maples Pavilion is
convenient, comfortable,
attractive, and has an excellently
constructed floor, even if
acoustically it leaves a great deal
to be desired. (Those who still
believe gyms are by nature
acoustical duds are referred to the
remarks of the late Maestro Josef
Krips about the Foothill College
gym.) But HCA is more than a
well constructed, comfortable
gym, as was pointed out very
nicely by Wilson. It is, I believe,
mainly the spirit and enthusiasm
of the fans in response to the
efforts of the team.
And the team need not be a
winning one. I attended school
and was trained in the Middle
West. During the time of my
formative years I attended many
basketball games, some won, some
lost, but almost always with the
home town fans behind them to
the hilt. I'll have to admit that in
my college town in winter, that
basketball game was often the
only action in town.

During the years I have been
watching Stanford's team, mainly
since the opening of Maples, I
have often reflected, remembering
the packed houses of screaming
fans of my student days when half
a dozen uniformed policemen
were present just to escort the
referees to and from the premises,
and wondered what is it about
Stanford that generates such
minimal enthusiasm. Certainly,
Stanford basketball is not the
only action in town for there are
college and professional teams in
every major sport, and not a few
minor ones, and this may well
account for a certain lack of
interest.

The efforts of Stanford teams
have always intrigued me as a
transplanted Midwesterner.
Verily, I am impressed with the
civility of the Stanford athletic
teams who do indeed seem to
espouse the philosophy of
Grantland Rice when he wrote,
"when the one great scorer comes
to write against your name he
marks not that you won or lost
but how you played the game."
There is a certain nonchalance
probably most evident in a
football team which could beat
the likes of USC, UCLA, and
Arkansas; achieve two Conference
Championships; and win two
successive Rose Bowl games
against the best of the Big Ten;
while at the same time losing to
such football stalwarts as Air
Force, Purdue and San Jose State.
Certainly, this civility possibly
accounts for a more gentlemanly
approach to basketball, and may
contribute to a style of play that
diminishes fan interest in the
team.

However, I feel the major
reason for lack of HCA as
reflected by fan enthusiasm is that
Stanford is just not an exciting
team to watch. They are not a
well disciplined, well drilled team
(civility?) in spite of a plathora of
talented players.

They seem to me to be a bunch
of individuals playing a team
sport, and this I would lay
squarely at the feet of the coach,
who seemingly has not drilled his
team so they play basketball, win,
lose, or draw. But then even this
sort of play might not move the
fans from their lethargy.
