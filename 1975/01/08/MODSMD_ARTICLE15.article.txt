## Greek Studies Expert Anton Raubitschek: Classics Department's Own 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Like a visit from Santa Claus, Prof.
Antony Erich Raubitschek's arrival at
the Classics Department office each
morning is accompanied by
commotion, presents and good cheer.
Smiling and nodding greetings,
trailed by students waiting for a word
with him, Raubitschek ambles into the
office, opens a worn brown satchel,
and proceeds to distribute its contents.
There are papers for the secretary,
papers for students, perhaps a book to
lend. Sometimes Raubitschek also
gives away avocados from the tree in
his back yard, or roses and purple
irises from his garden.
Eventually, the 62-year-old classics
professor turns his attention to the
waiting students. He gives each
individual his undivided attention and
listens to them with almost
grandfatherly concern.
The grandfather image is enhanced
by Raubitschek's kind, friendly face,
half-head of tousled, white curly hair,
white and black streaked walrus
mustache, portly build and German
accent.
Jolly Charmer
"He's a jolly person with a keen
sense of humor and an infectious

smile," said colleague William A.
Clebsch, professor in the humanities
special program and chairman of
f religious studies.
As for personal charm, "it comes
out of his fingertips and the ends of
his hair," Clebsch said.
Students are also charmed.
"He's a grand old man who knows
millions of stories," said a student in
Raubitschek's freshman seminar.
Another student offered a different
perspective. "He looks like a Teddy
bear when he's riding his bike," she
observed.
'Adorable' Scholar
Several other students agreed,
describing Raubitschek as "cute and
adorable .. . basically a big doll."
But there is more to the professor
than surface charm.
A freshman's comment that
Raubitschek "can tell you anything

you ever wanted to know about the
Greeks and Romans" is largely
accurate.
Raubitschek is considered "a very
distinguished scholar," said Michael
Wigodsky, associate professor of
classics. Clebsch notes that
Raubitschek is "one of the world's
experts maybe the expert" on Greek
inscriptions.
Without Prejudice
The general respect for
Raubitschek's scholarship includes
admiration for his intellectual
attitudes. He has "an obvious
prejudice against prejudices," and is
impatient with ill-founded opinions,
said Clebsch.
However, Raubitschek noted that
the qualities "I admire most in other
people are sincerity and the courage of
saying what they think.
"I like to do it myself," he added
with a smile. "Maybe I don't always
do it but I like to."
"Even about things on which he has
a strong and settled conviction, it
doesn't bother him to have others
disagree," said Wigodsky. Wigodsky
added that Raubitschek never gives up
hope of persuading a person he's
arguing with.
"The question for Raubitschek is
not 'who's right?'" Clebsch said, but
'how can we pursue the truth?' "
Meaty Questions
Clebsch observed that Raubitschek
has a talent for coming up with new
ideas, insights and "questions that
always have more to them than they
seem to."
"I don't think there is anyone from
whom I have learned more on how to
be puzzled," remarked Wigodsky, one
of Raubitschek's former students.
Conversations with Raubitschek
can lead in "some damned unexpected
directions," observed Wigodsky. But
this constant flow of fresh thoughts
can have its drawbacks.
Said Wigodsky, "When you think
you've gotten something settled with
him, it can be very disconcerting to
have him come up with a whole new
set of ideas about what you should be
doing a few days later."
However, "he doesn't realize
himself how often he changes his
mind," Wigodsky observed.

Wigodsky recalled a comment by
another of Raubitschek's former
students: "Because Tony says
everything in the same tone of voice,
he thinks himself that he's always
saying the same thing."
Though deeply involved in the field
now, Raubitschek was not always
interested in classics. Eyes twinkling,
face creased in a boyish grin,
Raubitschek confesses, "I wanted to
study math."
He chuckles. "When I was in
school, I spent 80 percent of my time
in math, and I thought I was very,
very, very good."
One of his father's friends, a
mathematics professor, put a blunt
end to Raubitschek's ambition.
Decreeing that "Tony is too dumb to
study mathematics," the professor
suggested that Raubitschek might be
better suited to the study of Greek
history.
So Raubitschek went into classics
graduating from the University of
Vienna in 1935 with a doctorate.
Back In The U.S.A.
Hitler's arrival in Austria, combined
with an invitation to come to
Princeton as a research fellow, induced
Raubitschek to leave Austria in 1938.
He taught at both Yale and Princeton
before joining the Stanford faculty in
1963.
Married in 1942, father of four and
grandfather of three, Raubitschek's
family takes up much of his free time.
After his family, there is no doubt
in the minds of students and faculty
members that Raubitschek puts
students first.
"He takes a lot of extra time for his
students," said one freshman, noting
that Raubitschek had listened to her
for two hours when he might instead
have given her a perfunctory 10
minutes.
"He shows concern for the
individual," commented another
student. The student told of a friend
from Mexico who took a humanities
class although he had trouble with
English. Raubitschek spotted the
Mexican student's problem on a
midterm and invited the student to
come in for help on his paper.
Involved Teacher
Raubitschek's deep interest in his
students is further reflected in his
attitude toward teaching.

Said a humanities teaching
assistant, "He sees teaching as an
education of people." Raubitschek
tries not just to teach students facts,
but also to make them aware of their
"moral responsibilities," the TA
added.
Raubitschek makes classics relevant
by drawing parallels between the
classical and the modern world. "He
shows how the same problems arise all
the time and everywhere," said a
humanities student.
Clebsch, who has worked with
Raubitschek in graduate courses,
praised him as "the best kind of
teacher," one who "doesn't let up on
the fact that learning is hard work.
"I've heard people complain of the
pain of rigorous intellectual discipline
under Raubitschek," said Clebsch,
"and I consider that a compliment to
him. Students appreciate him even
more when they look back on it."

Undergraduates praise
Raubitschek's speaking ability,
organization and sense of humor.
"He brings you so much more than
what's available in a textbook,"
commented a student.
Lectures offer a perfect showcase
for Raubitschek's enthusiastic teaching
style. He delivers entire lectures
without using notes, all the while
swaying from one sandaled foot to the
other, moving his head slowly from
side to side as he surveys his audience.
Constantly moving, his hands have
a life of their own, whether they are
clasped together in front of him like
those of a schoolboy reciting a poem,
waving emphatically over his head, or
stabbing the air.
"He's always flailing his arms all over
the place," said a student.
At times, Raubitschek gets so
involved in speaking that he stands
precariously on the edge of the stage,
gesturing appropriately.
He sees Stanford as "careless,
carefree in atmosphere," and the
college years as a time when "you can
get interested in things ... integrate
what you know talk, think and
write about it."

SERIOUS SCHOLAR Although few students are afraid to ask Prof. Anton
Raubitschek anything they ever wanted to know about ancient Greece, he rarely
misses a chance to get to the meat of an agrument. He's a "good opinion slicer,'
says a colleague.

JAUNTY GENTLEMAN Despite his image as the Santa Claus of the Classics
Department, Prof. Anton Raubitschek is always a gentleman. He's so polite that
he refuses to call secretaries he's worked with for nine years in the department
by their first names.
