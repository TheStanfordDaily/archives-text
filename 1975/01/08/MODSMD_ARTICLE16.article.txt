# Rubbed The Wrong Way
## Citizens Blast P.A. Massage Parlors 
### PATRICK J. McCARTHY 
Susan Selig and her husband
own the Restaurant Des Alpes on
California Avenue in Palo Alto.
Lately, they have been losing
business and have even been
threatened.
"People have called us," says
Mrs. Selig, "and said really evil
things. And they have told us, not
very subtly, to raise the insurance
on our restaurant."
The reason? The Seligs work
in, what she calls, a "formerly
pleasant middle-income family"
neighborhood that has, in the last
few years, become the home of
eight massage parlors. Last fall the
Palo Alto Police Department
proposed an ordinance to
"regulate" the city's massage
parlors. The Seligs attended a
hearing of the Policy and Planning
Procedures Committee of the City
Council where they strongly
voiced their approval.
A few blocks down California
Ave. from the Seligs' restaurant is

the Christian Science Reading
Room. The chief librarian,
Carolyn Tucher, also appeared at
the committee meeting to support
the ordinance.
"Some of our patrons are older
men and women," she says, "and
they are uneasy in that
neighborhood. Both of our
evening librarians feel very uneasy
about being there at 9 at night."
According to these alarmed
residents, suggestive literature is
strewn around the streets and on
car windshields. The parlors, they
say, also attract unsavory people.
"Women stand in the doorways
and call out to men," says Mrs.
Selig. "You see drunk, dirty,
disheveled men coming out of the
places at night, people who had
never been in the neighborhood
before, and you know what is
going on."
Responding to the complaints
and increasing "indications" that
some massage parlors were
engaging in criminal activity such

as prostitution, narcotics dealing,
and theft, Chief James Zurcher of
the Palo Alto Police Department
and Assistant City Manager
Charles Walker proposed an
ordinance which would "provide
for the orderly regulation of
massage establishments and
massage technicians."
Ordinance
The original ordinance required
every massage parlor owner to
obtain a license to operate from
the police, pay a license fee of
$l5O, certify that each
"technician" has completed at
least 100 hours of instruction
from a recognized school of
massage," be photographed and
be fingerprinted. In addition, the
original ordinance would have
allowed "any and all investigating
officials of the city" to enter a
parlor at any time.
The massage parlor owners
reacted to these proposed rules
angrily. "What they want to do,"
said Don Loudon, owner of a

number of Bay Arek massage
parlors, including t% Ali Baba
Parlor in Palo Alto, "is to try to
make us feel like criminals. I'm
not a criminal. I'm a businessman.
This will mean awful things for us
and the community. We should
not be discriminated against."
In recent years, a number of
California communities (including
Redwood City and San Jose) have
established ordinances to regulate
massage parjors. During the past
year, owners fled the
regulated Communities, while
massage j&rlors in Palo Alto
increased from six to 26. Spread
throughout the community, many
of the parlors have provocative
names such as "Foxy Lady,"
"The Green Door," and "Touch
of Beauty." Some, according to
the Palo Alto Times, are owned
by men with criminal records.
At the committee hearing,
Chief Zurcher said that "most
massage parlors are active in
prostitution, either on the

premises or on an out-call basis."
Police department figures indicate
that since 1972 there have been
18 arrests at massage parlors for
soliciting for prostitution, the
most recent three weeks ago. At
the time, police rounded up nine
alleged prostitutes at local parlors.
Police captain Gary Tatum
explained that recent "undercover
activities" by the police
department have revealed
widespread drug use at the
parlors.
"Customers, on occasion,"
Tatum said, "have given pills and
joints as tips, and often the
management gives girls marijuana.
Some girls even have gone to the
extent of using Pam, the grocery
product. It is like sniffing glue.
"A girl commented that she,
and most other girls that she knew,
had to stay high in order to
maintain a healthy psychological
base for their involvement. She
went on to describe sex acts that
if she wasn't high half the time
she probably couldn't live with.
She actually advocated the use
of narcotics to perform as a
masseuse."
Lawyers Hired
Massage owners, who have
formed a Massage Parlors
Association and hired two
lawyers, noted that the police
have only a few convictions (some
cases have been dismissed, most
are still pending). The owners also
said that, just like the police
department, they cannot control
all of their employees.
The owners claimed that, except
in a few circumstances, the
charges are untrue.
"My girls are well-trained
professionals," Loudon said, "and
they just don't do those kinds of
things."

The amended version, of the
ordinance passed by the City
Council last month reduced the
fee to $5O, reduced the number of
technician training hours to 70,
allowed the operator to present
his own photo and only be
fingerprinted upon request of the
police and made any search
without a warrant subject to
permission of owners. The
compromise ordinance takes
effect Jan. 23.

"A girl commented that she,
and most other girls that she knew,
had to stay high in order to
maintain a healthy psychological

went on to describe sex acts that

She actually advocated the use
of narcotics to perform as a

Lawyers Hired
Massage owners, who have
formed a Massage Parlors
Association and hired two
lawyers, noted that the police
have only a few convictions (some
cases have been dismissed, most
are still pending). The owners also
said that, just like the police
department, they cannot control
all of their employees.
The owners claimed that, except
in a few circumstances, the
charges are untrue.
"My girls are well-trained
professionals," Loudon said, "and
they just don't do those kinds of
things."

The amended version, of the
ordinance passed by the City
Council last month reduced the
fee to $5O, reduced the number of
technician training hours to 70,
allowed the operator to present
his own photo and only be
fingerprinted upon request of the
police and made any search
without a warrant subject to
permission of owners. The
compromise ordinance takes
effect Jan. 23.
Susan Selig and her husband
own the Restaurant Des Alpes on
California Avenue in Palo Alto.
Lately, they have been losing
business and have even been
threatened.
"People have called us," says
Mrs. Selig, "and said really evil
things. And they have told us, not
very subtly, to raise the insurance
on our restaurant."
The reason? The Seligs work
in, what she calls, a "formerly
pleasant middle-income family"
neighborhood that has, in the last
few years, become the home of
eight massage parlors. Last fall the
Palo Alto Police Department
proposed an ordinance to
"regulate" the city's massage
parlors. The Seligs attended a
hearing of the Policy and Planning
Procedures Committee of the City
Council where they strongly
voiced their approval.
A few blocks down California
Ave. from the Seligs' restaurant is

the Christian Science Reading
Room. The chief librarian,
Carolyn Tucher, also appeared at
the committee meeting to support
the ordinance.
"Some of our patrons are older
men and women," she says, "and
they are uneasy in that
neighborhood. Both of our
evening librarians feel very uneasy
about being there at 9 at night."
According to these alarmed
residents, suggestive literature is
strewn around the streets and on
car windshields. The parlors, they
say, also attract unsavory people.
"Women stand in the doorways
and call out to men," says Mrs.
Selig. "You see drunk, dirty,
disheveled men coming out of the
places at night, people who had
never been in the neighborhood
before, and you know what is
going on."
Responding to the complaints
and increasing "indications" that
some massage parlors were
engaging in criminal activity such

as prostitution, narcotics dealing,
and theft, Chief James Zurcher of
the Palo Alto Police Department
and Assistant City Manager
Charles Walker proposed an
ordinance which would "provide
for the orderly regulation of
massage establishments and
massage technicians."
Ordinance
The original ordinance required
every massage parlor owner to
obtain a license to operate from
the police, pay a license fee of
$l5O, certify that each
"technician" has completed at
least 100 hours of instruction
from a recognized school of
massage," be photographed and
be fingerprinted. In addition, the
original ordinance would have
allowed "any and all investigating
officials of the city" to enter a
parlor at any time.
The massage parlor owners
reacted to these proposed rules
angrily. "What they want to do,"
said Don Loudon, owner of a

number of Bay Arek massage
parlors, including t% Ali Baba
Parlor in Palo Alto, "is to try to
make us feel like criminals. I'm
not a criminal. I'm a businessman.
This will mean awful things for us
and the community. We should
not be discriminated against."
In recent years, a number of
California communities (including
Redwood City and San Jose) have
established ordinances to regulate
massage parjors. During the past
year, owners fled the
regulated Communities, while
massage j&rlors in Palo Alto
increased from six to 26. Spread
throughout the community, many
of the parlors have provocative
names such as "Foxy Lady,"
"The Green Door," and "Touch
of Beauty." Some, according to
the Palo Alto Times, are owned
by men with criminal records.
At the committee hearing,
Chief Zurcher said that "most
massage parlors are active in
prostitution, either on the

premises or on an out-call basis."
Police department figures indicate
that since 1972 there have been
18 arrests at massage parlors for
soliciting for prostitution, the
most recent three weeks ago. At
the time, police rounded up nine
alleged prostitutes at local parlors.
Police captain Gary Tatum
explained that recent "undercover
activities" by the police
department have revealed
widespread drug use at the
parlors.
"Customers, on occasion,"
Tatum said, "have given pills and
joints as tips, and often the
management gives girls marijuana.
Some girls even have gone to the
extent of using Pam, the grocery
product. It is like sniffing glue.

Redwood City and San Jose) have
established ordinances to regulate
massage parjors. During the past
year, owners fled the
regulated Communities, while
massage j&rlors in Palo Alto
increased from six to 26. Spread
throughout the community, many
of the parlors have provocative
names such as "Foxy Lady,"
"The Green Door," and "Touch
of Beauty." Some, according to
the Palo Alto Times, are owned
by men with criminal records.
At the committee hearing,
Chief Zurcher said that "most
massage parlors are active in
prostitution, either on the

premises or on an out-call basis."
Police department figures indicate
that since 1972 there have been
18 arrests at massage parlors for
soliciting for prostitution, the
most recent three weeks ago. At
the time, police rounded up nine
alleged prostitutes at local parlors.
Police captain Gary Tatum
explained that recent "undercover
activities" by the police
department have revealed
widespread drug use at the
parlors.
"Customers, on occasion,"
Tatum said, "have given pills and
joints as tips, and often the
management gives girls marijuana.
Some girls even have gone to the
extent of using Pam, the grocery
product. It is like sniffing glue.
"A girl commented that she,
and most other girls that she knew,
had to stay high in order to
maintain a healthy psychological
base for their involvement. She
went on to describe sex acts that
if she wasn't high half the time
she probably couldn't live with.
She actually advocated the use
of narcotics to perform as a
masseuse."
Lawyers Hired
Massage owners, who have
formed a Massage Parlors
Association and hired two
lawyers, noted that the police
have only a few convictions (some
cases have been dismissed, most
are still pending). The owners also
said that, just like the police
department, they cannot control
all of their employees.
The owners claimed that, except
in a few circumstances, the
charges are untrue.
"My girls are well-trained
professionals," Loudon said, "and
they just don't do those kinds of
things."

The amended version, of the
ordinance passed by the City
Council last month reduced the
fee to $5O, reduced the number of
technician training hours to 70,
allowed the operator to present
his own photo and only be
fingerprinted upon request of the
police and made any search
without a warrant subject to
permission of owners. The
compromise ordinance takes
effect Jan. 23.
Susan Selig and her husband
own the Restaurant Des Alpes on
California Avenue in Palo Alto.
Lately, they have been losing
business and have even been
threatened.
"People have called us," says
Mrs. Selig, "and said really evil
things. And they have told us, not
very subtly, to raise the insurance
on our restaurant."
The reason? The Seligs work
in, what she calls, a "formerly
pleasant middle-income family"
neighborhood that has, in the last
few years, become the home of
eight massage parlors. Last fall the
Palo Alto Police Department
proposed an ordinance to
"regulate" the city's massage
parlors. The Seligs attended a
hearing of the Policy and Planning
Procedures Committee of the City
Council where they strongly
voiced their approval.
A few blocks down California
Ave. from the Seligs' restaurant is

the Christian Science Reading
Room. The chief librarian,
Carolyn Tucher, also appeared at
the committee meeting to support
the ordinance.
"Some of our patrons are older
men and women," she says, "and
they are uneasy in that
neighborhood. Both of our
evening librarians feel very uneasy
about being there at 9 at night."
According to these alarmed
residents, suggestive literature is
strewn around the streets and on
car windshields. The parlors, they
say, also attract unsavory people.
"Women stand in the doorways
and call out to men," says Mrs.
Selig. "You see drunk, dirty,
disheveled men coming out of the
places at night, people who had
never been in the neighborhood
before, and you know what is
going on."
Responding to the complaints
and increasing "indications" that
some massage parlors were
engaging in criminal activity such

as prostitution, narcotics dealing,
and theft, Chief James Zurcher of
the Palo Alto Police Department
and Assistant City Manager
Charles Walker proposed an
ordinance which would "provide
for the orderly regulation of
massage establishments and
massage technicians."
Ordinance
The original ordinance required
every massage parlor owner to
obtain a license to operate from
the police, pay a license fee of
$l5O, certify that each
"technician" has completed at
least 100 hours of instruction
from a recognized school of
massage," be photographed and
be fingerprinted. In addition, the
original ordinance would have
allowed "any and all investigating
officials of the city" to enter a
parlor at any time.
The massage parlor owners
reacted to these proposed rules
angrily. "What they want to do,"
said Don Loudon, owner of a

number of Bay Arek massage
parlors, including t% Ali Baba
Parlor in Palo Alto, "is to try to
make us feel like criminals. I'm
not a criminal. I'm a businessman.
This will mean awful things for us
and the community. We should
not be discriminated against."
