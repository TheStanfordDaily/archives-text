# Scribes To Lurk In Classes
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Don't be alarmed by those furious
scribblers in the back of your biology
or physics class. Chances are they're
just notetakers from the ASSU
Lecture Notes Service, which began
operation yesterday.
The semce is designed to provide
low-cost lecture notes to students
here, giving them an increased
opportunity to listen to lectures and
grasp the main points, said the
service's director, Vic Petroff.
The notes will be passed out in
classes next week, and will be free for
the first week, according to Petroff, a
sophomore in economics.
"The idea is to give students a
chance to examine the quality of the
notes," and see if the notes might help
them in their classes, Petroff said.
He said notetakers have been hired
to take notes in 14 classes ranging
from Psychology 157, "Sleep and
Dreams," to Biology 22, "Principles of
Biology."
Subscriptions
Students who decide to subscribe
to the service will â€¢ have to pay for

subscriptions in the lecture notes
section of the ASSU office.
Students must subscribe for the
entire quarter $4 for courses that
meet two hours a week, $6 for courses
that meet three hours and $8 for
courses that meet four hours.
Petroff has high hopes for the
service, which he says could net $llOO
this quarter if 70 students,
approximately 35 percent of those
enrolled in each lecture note class,
subscribe.
Correct Estimates
The estimated enrollment for each
of the courses is more than 170, and
Petroff said most of his notetakers
have told him that the estimates are
indeed correct.
He noted that even if the service
does earn $llOO, it will be far from
out of the red.
The organization already owes the
ASSU at least $2400 for a
mimeograph machine and an
electronic stencilmaker. In addition,
the service ran up expenses of $9OO
during last quarter.
Possible Success
Petroff said that if the service were
able to make enough this quarter to
pay for last quarter's costs, he would
consider the program a success.
"There may be so many people
lined up at our door that we'll have a
lot of problems, and then again, things
may go so smoothly that I'll have
people [employees] standing around,"
he said.
The program has already met with a
few minor problems. One full-time
office employee quit yesterday
because she found a better job. Petroff
said he has to find a replacement in
the next few days, but expressed
confidence that he could.
Unforeseen Cost
The service has also incurred an
unforeseen cost, Petroff disclosed.
"When they [business planners]
figured out the costs for the service,
someone forgot to figure in the 15
minutes it takes for the stencilmaker
to make one stencil," he said. This
means extra labor costs, he explained.
Petroff is currently working out a
stenciling schedule for all class notes.
He said he will finish the schedule
sometime this week, along with a

schedule of times students can pick up
the notes at the lecture notes office.
The pick-up schedule will be
distributed with the first batch of
lecture notes next week.
Most notes will be handed out on a
weekly basis except for Physics 51,
"Mechanics," for which notes will be
available daily.
