## Two Sports To Get Axe? 
### MARK FUNK 
Stanford gymnastics coach
Sadao Hamada and wrestling head
man Joe DeMeo were informed by
athletic department officials in a
two-hour meeting Friday that
pending budget cuts, increased
demands by intramural and club
sports for space, and Title IX have
forced the University to consider
withdrawing varsity status from
the programs.
Hamada and DeMeo said the
meeting was the first official work
either had heard that cuts might
be in the offing. However, they
assert that rumors have been
circulating among coaches and
officials of other Pacific Eight
schools since mid-December. The
pair speculate that news of the
cuts may have been obtained by
Pac-8 rivals at the conference's
end-of-year meeting in San
Francisco.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
was Stanford's representative at
the. meetings. Ruetz is in
Washington D.C. this week
attending an NCAA convention
and was unavailable for comment.
Both coaches cite
conversations with prospective
recruits and other league coaches
to back up their claim. Hamada
said that high school gymnasts he
had contacted Dec. 23 and 27
told him that other colleges had
tried to dissuade them from
coming to Stanford by telling
them that "our gymnastics
program which is nationally
recognized would soon be
disbanded." The schools the

athletes said talked to them were
Oregon and California.
DeMeo, too, said he had been
having recruiting problems which
had started in late December.
"Even if wrestling isn't dropped
and I am going to fight to save it
our recruiting efforts this year
have been hurt badly."
Space A Factor
At the Friday meeting, DeMeo
said Ruetz explained that renewed
requests by women's sports
programs and intramurals for
space particularly on Encina
Gym, which houses both varsity
squads and University budget
cuts are elements which might
contribute to dropping the sports.
Space seems to be an
important factor in the
arguments. Since the rise of
women's athletics on campus and
the expropriation of the Old
Pavilion by administration
officials, there has not been
enough indoor space to meet the
demands of the growing programs.
Gary Cavalli, Stanford's sports
information director, emphasized
yesterday that no decision has
been reached on the status of
either sport. He pointed out that a
panel consisting of Ruetz,
respresentatives of the women's
athletic programs and Provost's
office, and some personel from
the athletic department would
review the situation before
making a final decision.
Both DeMeo and Hamada
expressed shock and dismay at
this recent turn of events. "When
people I have been trying to

recruit told me what other schools
were saying, I told them it was
nothing but a rumor and not to
take it seriously," Hamada
commented. "Now look."
"Our program is nationally
recognized," he continued,
stressing that Stanford's
reputation as an academic
institution as well as a gymnastics
power had made recruiting
increasingly easier for his
program. "And the sport is
growing."
Another Idea
Hamada said he has been
approached by a number of
women wanting to start a
gymnastics squad. "The PE classes
I teach, which have enrollments of
60 and 100, have a number of
women in them." He feels that
the logical step would be to add
the women's team rather than cut
the men's.
DeMeo also pointed to gains
his program has made. "We're
growing, both on campus and
otherwise," he said. "It would be
a shame to cut the program now."
"I guess what I feel the worst
about is the kids they have
worked so hard to get the team
where it is today," DeMeo said.

Stanford gymnastics coach
Sadao Hamada and wrestling head
man Joe DeMeo were informed by
athletic department officials in a
two-hour meeting Friday that
pending budget cuts, increased
demands by intramural and club
sports for space, and Title IX have
forced the University to consider
withdrawing varsity status from
the programs.
Hamada and DeMeo said the
meeting was the first official work
either had heard that cuts might
be in the offing. However, they
assert that rumors have been
circulating among coaches and
officials of other Pacific Eight
schools since mid-December. The
pair speculate that news of the
cuts may have been obtained by
Pac-8 rivals at the conference's
end-of-year meeting in San
Francisco.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
was Stanford's representative at
the. meetings. Ruetz is in
Washington D.C. this week
attending an NCAA convention
and was unavailable for comment.
Both coaches cite
conversations with prospective
recruits and other league coaches
to back up their claim. Hamada
said that high school gymnasts he
had contacted Dec. 23 and 27
told him that other colleges had
tried to dissuade them from
coming to Stanford by telling
them that "our gymnastics
program which is nationally
recognized would soon be
disbanded." The schools the

athletes said talked to them were
Oregon and California.
DeMeo, too, said he had been
having recruiting problems which
had started in late December.
"Even if wrestling isn't dropped
and I am going to fight to save it
our recruiting efforts this year
have been hurt badly."
Space A Factor
At the Friday meeting, DeMeo
said Ruetz explained that renewed
requests by women's sports
programs and intramurals for
space particularly on Encina
Gym, which houses both varsity
squads and University budget
cuts are elements which might
contribute to dropping the sports.
Space seems to be an
important factor in the
arguments. Since the rise of
women's athletics on campus and
the expropriation of the Old
Pavilion by administration
officials, there has not been
enough indoor space to meet the
demands of the growing programs.
Gary Cavalli, Stanford's sports
information director, emphasized
yesterday that no decision has
been reached on the status of
either sport. He pointed out that a
panel consisting of Ruetz,
respresentatives of the women's
athletic programs and Provost's
office, and some personel from
the athletic department would
review the situation before
making a final decision.
Both DeMeo and Hamada
expressed shock and dismay at
this recent turn of events. "When
people I have been trying to

recruit told me what other schools
were saying, I told them it was
nothing but a rumor and not to
take it seriously," Hamada
commented. "Now look."
"Our program is nationally
recognized," he continued,
stressing that Stanford's
reputation as an academic
institution as well as a gymnastics
power had made recruiting
increasingly easier for his
program. "And the sport is
growing."
Another Idea
Hamada said he has been
approached by a number of
women wanting to start a
gymnastics squad. "The PE classes
I teach, which have enrollments of
60 and 100, have a number of
women in them." He feels that
the logical step would be to add
the women's team rather than cut
the men's.
DeMeo also pointed to gains
his program has made. "We're
growing, both on campus and
otherwise," he said. "It would be
a shame to cut the program now."
"I guess what I feel the worst
about is the kids they have
