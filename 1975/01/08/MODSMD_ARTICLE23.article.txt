NCAA To Offer
Women's Program
The National Collegiate
Athletic Association plans to
begin a program to offer
championships for women in up
to 11 sports within the next three
years.
The NCAA's Committee on
Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women hopes to develop a pilot
program in time for this spring's
track and tennis championships. If
successful, other championships
would be added later.
The NCAA now takes no part

in women's athletics, that being
the province by another group,
the Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women. AIAW
officials, directly threatened by
the NCAA move, expressed shock
and disappointment.
IM Meeting
There will be a meeting of all
IM managers today at 4 p.m. in
Room 350 of Encina Gym.
