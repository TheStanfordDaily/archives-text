# Woman Paces Grappler Win

### MARK FUNK 
Stanford's wrestling team
defeated Cal State-Hayward 36-5 last
night in Encina Gym to stretch its
dual meet record to 4-1, but the
biggest news of the night was a
Pioneer forfeit in the 118-pound
weight class.
The forfeit allowed the Cards'
Allison Adams to become the first
woman in NCAA history to win a
varsity wrestling match. The
referee acknowledged her
forfeit-victory to the soft whir of
television cameras and the harsh
glow of floodlights. A full house
of Bay Area media people and
fans were on hand for the event.
Adams later returned to the
mats to spar for two minutes with
teammate Gary Schmeling, also
118 pounds.
After the match, Adams said
that she "really enjoys wrestling"
but was upset by the furor her
appearance has created during the
last two days. "I was turned off
by a lot of the publicity the
match received tonight. Coach
DeMeo and the guys on the team
were great, however," she said.
And lest anyone think Adams a

publicity seeker for undertaking
the endeavor, hear this: In order
to "make weight" for the match
(which is mat lingo for qualifying
for a weight category), she has
subsisted on water for the past 36
hours. After hitting an assistant
coaches' sauna last night, she had
shed nine pounds.
That is dedication, but no
more than any wrestler normally
goes through before a match.
"Nobody knows just how tough it
is to lose weight," Adams said, "I
guess I did it to prove something
to myself."
Adams said her future is
undecided. She said she definitely

will stay with the wrestling team,
but thought she might not wrestle
competitively again at least not
until the storm dies down.
"Wrestling is a sport women
should be able to compete in
because of the variations of
weight classes," Adams
concluded. "But I won't wrestle
again until circumstances are a
little different. I don't want to be
considered a freak."
In other action, the Cards'
Craig Reynolds (158) pinned
Hayward's Mike Marleto at 4:30
of the third round to pace the 36
point effort. Only one Stanford
wrestler lost during the match.
