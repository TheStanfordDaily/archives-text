# Shuffling The Cards
## Unlikely Culprits 
### Dave Robinson 
Coaches, players and referees have often been blamed for Stanford
basketball losses, but never has the combination of culprits been as
strange as the group responsible for the latest Cardinal defeats.
Let's start with Registrar Sally Mahoney, who obviously wouldn't
have been able to stop USF's Tony Styles one-on-one Saturday night.
But Melvin Arterberry might have been able to, and it was Mahoney
who triggered an amazing series of events that prevented apparently
without just cause Arterberry from playing in the five Stanford
games between Dec. 23 and Jan. 4.
On Dec. 23, Mahoney sent a letter to Arterberry and his parents
informing them that Melvin had been suspended from school. "I sent
him the letter advising him of the record as we found it," Mahoney
said. The record at that time spoke for itself; Arterberry, according to
his transcript, successfully completed only one unit during autumn
quarter.
Now, everything has apparently been straightened out. Arterberry
says he has received credit for at least 12 units. One course never
appeared on his study list card due to a computer error, and at least
two other professors have changed grades after working out
misunderstandings with Arterberry. Mahoney will revoke the
suspension this afternoon if she receives the necessary forms from
professors, and Arterberry will be in the starting lineup Friday night
when the Cards open their Pac-8 season against Oregon in Eugene.
But events of the past few weeks remain unbelievable, and it seems
clear that Arterberry should never have been forced to sit out any
games.
According to page eight of the Pacific Eight Conference handbook,
"a student who has been declared ineligible at the end of a semester or
quarter cannot compete on an intercollegiate team on or after the first
day of classes of the following semester or quarter." The first day of
classes of the following quarter, of course, was yesterday. Yet
Arterberry was not allowed to participate in games during the
vacation.
Ostensibly, the reason for this was that Arterberry was not only
ineligible, but suspended from the University. Mahoney informed
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz on Dec. 23 that the suspension was
effective immediately. Ruetz, judging that an athlete who was
suspended from the University should not be allowed to compete,
informed coaches Howie Dallmar and Bub Bowling that Arterberry
could not dress for any games until the situation was worked out.
So what actually happened is that Arterberry's suspension, which
was under legitimate appeal, still became effective before registration
day winter quarter a ruling that would have to be considered rigid
under any circumstances.
Ruetz, Dallmar and Bowling merely accepted the ruling without
further questioning, which is where their part of the blame comes in.
They assumed Mahoney's judgment was correct and did not appeal
further, even though a suspension would logically not be effective
during a vacation period.
Various Athletic Department officials then re-directed their efforts
toward a cover-up campaign designed to prevent leaking any
information to the press. Reporters were told that Arterberry was
suffering from stretched knee ligaments (he was injured, but not
severely enough to be out of action).
The whole affair was mishandled from the start by the Registrar's
Office and the Athletic Department, at the expense of two innocent
victims Melvin Arterberry, who should have been allowed to play,
and the Stanford basketball team, which suffered greatly from his
absence.

his transcript, successfully completed only one unit during autumn
quarter.
Now, everything has apparently been straightened out. Arterberry
says he has received credit for at least 12 units. One course never
appeared on his study list card due to a computer error, and at least
two other professors have changed grades after working out
misunderstandings with Arterberry. Mahoney will revoke the
suspension this afternoon if she receives the necessary forms from
professors, and Arterberry will be in the starting lineup Friday night
when the Cards open their Pac-8 season against Oregon in Eugene.
But events of the past few weeks remain unbelievable, and it seems
clear that Arterberry should never have been forced to sit out any
games.
According to page eight of the Pacific Eight Conference handbook,
"a student who has been declared ineligible at the end of a semester or
quarter cannot compete on an intercollegiate team on or after the first
day of classes of the following semester or quarter." The first day of
classes of the following quarter, of course, was yesterday. Yet
Arterberry was not allowed to participate in games during the
vacation.
Ostensibly, the reason for this was that Arterberry was not only
ineligible, but suspended from the University. Mahoney informed
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz on Dec. 23 that the suspension was
effective immediately. Ruetz, judging that an athlete who was
suspended from the University should not be allowed to compete,
informed coaches Howie Dallmar and Bub Bowling that Arterberry
could not dress for any games until the situation was worked out.
So what actually happened is that Arterberry's suspension, which
was under legitimate appeal, still became effective before registration
day winter quarter a ruling that would have to be considered rigid
under any circumstances.
Ruetz, Dallmar and Bowling merely accepted the ruling without
further questioning, which is where their part of the blame comes in.
They assumed Mahoney's judgment was correct and did not appeal
further, even though a suspension would logically not be effective
during a vacation period.
Various Athletic Department officials then re-directed their efforts
toward a cover-up campaign designed to prevent leaking any
information to the press. Reporters were told that Arterberry was
suffering from stretched knee ligaments (he was injured, but not
severely enough to be out of action).
The whole affair was mishandled from the start by the Registrar's
Office and the Athletic Department, at the expense of two innocent
victims Melvin Arterberry, who should have been allowed to play,
and the Stanford basketball team, which suffered greatly from his
absence.
Coaches, players and referees have often been blamed for Stanford
basketball losses, but never has the combination of culprits been as
strange as the group responsible for the latest Cardinal defeats.
Let's start with Registrar Sally Mahoney, who obviously wouldn't
have been able to stop USF's Tony Styles one-on-one Saturday night.
But Melvin Arterberry might have been able to, and it was Mahoney
who triggered an amazing series of events that prevented apparently
without just cause Arterberry from playing in the five Stanford
games between Dec. 23 and Jan. 4.
On Dec. 23, Mahoney sent a letter to Arterberry and his parents
informing them that Melvin had been suspended from school. "I sent
him the letter advising him of the record as we found it," Mahoney
said. The record at that time spoke for itself; Arterberry, according to
his transcript, successfully completed only one unit during autumn
quarter.

says he has received credit for at least 12 units. One course never
