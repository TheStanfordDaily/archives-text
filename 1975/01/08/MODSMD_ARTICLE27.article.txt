### 
Economy's Worst Postwar Year?
WASHINGTON The nation's economy may
have declined overall by two percent last year,
which would be one of the worst economic
performances in postwar history, Commerce
Department officials said yesterday.
James L. Pate, assistant commerce secretary for
economic affairs, said in an interview that the Gross
National Product probably fell at an annual rate of
between six and eight percent in the final three
months of 1974, which would be the fourth straight
quarterly drop in GNP.
The information on the dismal 1974
performance of the nation's economy came as White
House Press Secretary Ron Nessen told newsmen
President Ford might speed up his timetable for
announcing his new economic program.
Administration sources have said the President is
considering a tax cut ranging from $lO billion to
$2O billion in both corporation and individual
income taxes, but that the exact amount is still
undecided.
A Commerce Department spokesman said if Pate
is correct in estimating the GNP declined between
six and eight percent in the fourth quarter, it would
mean an overall drop in economic output of slightly
more than two percent in 1974.
Prop. 9 Faces Legal Roadblocks
SACRAMENTO California's tough new
election laws Prop. 9 went into effect yesterday
and immediately faced legal roadblocks in two
lawsuits challenging the laws' constitutionality.
The laws impose strict restrictions on the
activities of lobbyists, limit the amount of money a
candidate can spend to get elected, and compel
candidates to disclose campaign finances.
Various provisions of the 20,000-word initiative
were challenged in a hearing in Sacramento Superior
Court on a suit brought by the California Bankers'
Association and Assemblyman Alan Sieroty
(D-Beverly Hills).
The other lawsuit was filed on behalf of a group

of Sacramento'" most influential lobbyists by the
law firm of the father of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
The laws of Prop. 9 were overwhelmingly
approved by voters last June Brown supported the
political reform measure, his father has said he
will not be involved in the firm's handling of the
case.
Oil Workers Still Negotiating
DENVER - The president of the oil workers
union said he would not call a strike as contracts
with the nation's oil companies expired at midnight
yesterday.
A.F. Grospiron, president of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers International Union, said
contract negotiations would continue today.
The 430 individual contracts between the union
and the oil companies expired at midnight local
time yesterday.
Grospiron is the only person authorized to call a
strike. He said no decision had been made on
whether he would exercise that power later.
Brown Begins 'Austere' Term
SACRAMENTO Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
promised an austere administration, and that's the
way it looked yesterday on his first working day in
the Capitol.
The walls were bare and most of the bookcases
were empty in the 16-by-16-foot governor's office
that Ronald Reagan moved out of last Friday.
Brown was talking about an overall approach to
state government about making a dent in a budget
of $ll billion or so when he spoke.of cost cutting
in his Monday inaugural address.
He set his own office and lifestyle as examples,
giving up Reagan's limousine and executive jet,
refusing to live in the partially constructed
governor's mansion when it is finished, and calling
for seven percent cuts in salaries of the governor's
personal staff.
Brown met yesterday individually with staff
members and then with Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy and Senate President pro tem James Mills.
New Disaster Hits Australia
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA Disaster-battered
Australia now is facing a "once in a lifetime" wave
of bushfires that has blackened vast areas of grazing
land and burned thousands of sheep alive.
The bushfire season, just two months old and
likely to last until March, has already left more land
burned than the areas of Montana, North Dakota,
Colorado and Wyoming combined.
These fires and a cyclone that wiped out most of
Darwin on Christmas Day have combined to inflict
an unusual dose of disaster on Australia. More than
half the 41,000 residents of Darwin on Australia's
northern coast have been evacuated.
Damage to land, stock and fencing from the
bushfires is expected to reach millions of dollars.
Ash and smoke have carried 1400 miles to New
Zealand.
British Foil Hijacking
LONDON An Arab hijacker took over a British
jetliner yesterday and demanded to be flown to
France. The pilot took off on pretense of flying to
Paris, but instead landed at another airport near
London and police captured the hijacker.
"There was no shooting and the hostages are
quite safe," an official spokesman said. The hostages
were the five crew members left aboard after the 46
passengers were freed at Heathrow Airport, where
the hijacking began on the ground.
The hijacker, dressed in Arab robes and armed
with a revolver and a grenade, seized the British

Airways BAClll soon after it arrived from
Manchester, Eqgland. The passengers were allowed
to disembark, but the pilot, copilot, two
stewardesses and one steward remained aboard.
North Vietnamese Forces Advance
SAIGON North Vietnamese forces widened
their territorial control yesterday in fighting less
than 100 miles north and east of Saigon. They
threatened a second provincial capital after
capturing Phuoc Binh, 75 miles north of Saigon, the
first to fall in nearly three years.
The provincial capital of Tay Ninh was menaced
after North Vietnamese forces captured the Black
Virgin Mountain base camp and communications
center 70 miles southwest of Phuoc Binh.
The Communist-led troops damaged most of the
signal equipment in the camp and forced 100
defenders to flee, the Saigon command said.
U.S. Reaffirms Paris Accords
WASHINGTON The United States still holds
North Vietnam bound to the 1973 Paris peace
accords on Vietnam despite the current Communist
capture of Phuoc Long province and its capital near
the Cambodian border, State Department
spokesman Robert Anderson said yesterday.
Anderson described the fall of the capital city of
Phuoc Binh as a "very serious matter" but
emphasized to reporters: "We do not consider this
abrogates the Paris agreement."
At the same time the Defense Department
sharply denied reports that a six-ship U.S. Navy task
force headed by the carrier Enterprise had left Subic
Bay in the Philippines for Vietnam waters.
It was learned that the task force actually is
heading for the Indian Ocean on what is described
as a routine mission of maneuvers and a number of
port calls.
President Ford was described by the White House
as watching the Vietnam situation closely. Press
Secretary Ron Nessen said the President discussed
developments at a morning conference with
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Maj. Gen.
Brent Scowcroft, deputy presidential assistant for
national security affairs.
Nuclear Plants Face Restrictions
WASHINGTON Electric utilities may have to
change the way they plan and build for the future if
other states follow Wisconsin's lead in restricting
construction of a new nuclear power plant.
The Wisconsin Public Service Commission has
ordered four utilities to limit spending and signing
contracts on the nuclear plant before the
commission decides whether to approve its
construction.
The commission also has declared that if it denies
permission to build the plant, any losses must be
absorbed by the utility stockholders and not be
passed along to customers.
Attorneys for citizens groups which have
challenged new power plants around the country
say adoption of the Wisconsin order by other
regulators would make shareholders more
responsible for their firms' expansion plans and
result in better energy planning.
Today's Weather
Showers today and partly cloudy tomorrow.
Colder today and much colder tomorrow. Lows
tonight in the 30s. Highs today lower to mid 50s
and tomorrow in the 40s. Small craft advisory for
northwest winds 20 to 35 mph today decreasing
tomorrow. Chance of rain 80 percent today.

Various provisions of the 20,000-word initiative
were challenged in a hearing in Sacramento Superior
Court on a suit brought by the California Bankers'
Association and Assemblyman Alan Sieroty
(D-Beverly Hills).
The other lawsuit was filed on behalf of a group

Oil Workers Still Negotiating
DENVER - The president of the oil workers
union said he would not call a strike as contracts
with the nation's oil companies expired at midnight
yesterday.
A.F. Grospiron, president of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers International Union, said
contract negotiations would continue today.
The 430 individual contracts between the union
and the oil companies expired at midnight local

whether he would exercise that power later.
Brown Begins 'Austere' Term
SACRAMENTO Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
promised an austere administration, and that's the
way it looked yesterday on his first working day in
the Capitol.
The walls were bare and most of the bookcases
were empty in the 16-by-16-foot governor's office
that Ronald Reagan moved out of last Friday.
Brown was talking about an overall approach to
state government about making a dent in a budget
of $ll billion or so when he spoke.of cost cutting
in his Monday inaugural address.
He set his own office and lifestyle as examples,
giving up Reagan's limousine and executive jet,
refusing to live in the partially constructed
governor's mansion when it is finished, and calling
for seven percent cuts in salaries of the governor's
personal staff.
Brown met yesterday individually with staff
members and then with Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy and Senate President pro tem James Mills.
New Disaster Hits Australia
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA Disaster-battered
Australia now is facing a "once in a lifetime" wave
of bushfires that has blackened vast areas of grazing
land and burned thousands of sheep alive.
The bushfire season, just two months old and
likely to last until March, has already left more land
burned than the areas of Montana, North Dakota,
Colorado and Wyoming combined.
These fires and a cyclone that wiped out most of
Darwin on Christmas Day have combined to inflict
an unusual dose of disaster on Australia. More than
half the 41,000 residents of Darwin on Australia's
northern coast have been evacuated.
Damage to land, stock and fencing from the
bushfires is expected to reach millions of dollars.
Ash and smoke have carried 1400 miles to New
Zealand.
British Foil Hijacking
LONDON An Arab hijacker took over a British
jetliner yesterday and demanded to be flown to
France. The pilot took off on pretense of flying to
Paris, but instead landed at another airport near
London and police captured the hijacker.
"There was no shooting and the hostages are
quite safe," an official spokesman said. The hostages
were the five crew members left aboard after the 46
passengers were freed at Heathrow Airport, where
the hijacking began on the ground.
The hijacker, dressed in Arab robes and armed
with a revolver and a grenade, seized the British

Airways BAClll soon after it arrived from
Manchester, Eqgland. The passengers were allowed
to disembark, but the pilot, copilot, two
stewardesses and one steward remained aboard.
North Vietnamese Forces Advance
SAIGON North Vietnamese forces widened
their territorial control yesterday in fighting less
than 100 miles north and east of Saigon. They
threatened a second provincial capital after
capturing Phuoc Binh, 75 miles north of Saigon, the
first to fall in nearly three years.
The provincial capital of Tay Ninh was menaced
after North Vietnamese forces captured the Black
Virgin Mountain base camp and communications
center 70 miles southwest of Phuoc Binh.
The Communist-led troops damaged most of the
signal equipment in the camp and forced 100
defenders to flee, the Saigon command said.
U.S. Reaffirms Paris Accords
WASHINGTON The United States still holds
North Vietnam bound to the 1973 Paris peace
accords on Vietnam despite the current Communist
capture of Phuoc Long province and its capital near
the Cambodian border, State Department
spokesman Robert Anderson said yesterday.
Anderson described the fall of the capital city of
Phuoc Binh as a "very serious matter" but
emphasized to reporters: "We do not consider this
abrogates the Paris agreement."
At the same time the Defense Department
sharply denied reports that a six-ship U.S. Navy task
force headed by the carrier Enterprise had left Subic
Bay in the Philippines for Vietnam waters.
It was learned that the task force actually is
heading for the Indian Ocean on what is described
as a routine mission of maneuvers and a number of
port calls.
President Ford was described by the White House
as watching the Vietnam situation closely. Press
Secretary Ron Nessen said the President discussed
developments at a morning conference with
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Maj. Gen.
Brent Scowcroft, deputy presidential assistant for
national security affairs.
Nuclear Plants Face Restrictions
WASHINGTON Electric utilities may have to
change the way they plan and build for the future if
other states follow Wisconsin's lead in restricting
construction of a new nuclear power plant.
The Wisconsin Public Service Commission has
ordered four utilities to limit spending and signing
contracts on the nuclear plant before the
commission decides whether to approve its
construction.
The commission also has declared that if it denies
permission to build the plant, any losses must be
absorbed by the utility stockholders and not be
passed along to customers.
Attorneys for citizens groups which have
challenged new power plants around the country
say adoption of the Wisconsin order by other
regulators would make shareholders more
responsible for their firms' expansion plans and
result in better energy planning.

Economy's Worst Postwar Year?
WASHINGTON The nation's economy may
have declined overall by two percent last year,
which would be one of the worst economic
performances in postwar history, Commerce
Department officials said yesterday.
James L. Pate, assistant commerce secretary for
economic affairs, said in an interview that the Gross
National Product probably fell at an annual rate of
between six and eight percent in the final three
months of 1974, which would be the fourth straight
quarterly drop in GNP.
The information on the dismal 1974
performance of the nation's economy came as White
House Press Secretary Ron Nessen told newsmen
President Ford might speed up his timetable for
announcing his new economic program.
Administration sources have said the President is
considering a tax cut ranging from $lO billion to
$2O billion in both corporation and individual
income taxes, but that the exact amount is still
undecided.
A Commerce Department spokesman said if Pate
is correct in estimating the GNP declined between
six and eight percent in the fourth quarter, it would
mean an overall drop in economic output of slightly
more than two percent in 1974.

promised an austere administration, and that's the
way it looked yesterday on his first working day in
the Capitol.
The walls were bare and most of the bookcases
were empty in the 16-by-16-foot governor's office
that Ronald Reagan moved out of last Friday.
Brown was talking about an overall approach to
state government about making a dent in a budget
of $ll billion or so when he spoke.of cost cutting
in his Monday inaugural address.
He set his own office and lifestyle as examples,
giving up Reagan's limousine and executive jet,
refusing to live in the partially constructed
governor's mansion when it is finished, and calling
for seven percent cuts in salaries of the governor's
personal staff.
Brown met yesterday individually with staff
members and then with Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy and Senate President pro tem James Mills.
New Disaster Hits Australia
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA Disaster-battered
Australia now is facing a "once in a lifetime" wave
of bushfires that has blackened vast areas of grazing
land and burned thousands of sheep alive.
The bushfire season, just two months old and
likely to last until March, has already left more land
burned than the areas of Montana, North Dakota,
Colorado and Wyoming combined.
These fires and a cyclone that wiped out most of
Darwin on Christmas Day have combined to inflict
an unusual dose of disaster on Australia. More than
half the 41,000 residents of Darwin on Australia's
northern coast have been evacuated.
Damage to land, stock and fencing from the
bushfires is expected to reach millions of dollars.
Ash and smoke have carried 1400 miles to New
Zealand.
British Foil Hijacking
LONDON An Arab hijacker took over a British
jetliner yesterday and demanded to be flown to
France. The pilot took off on pretense of flying to
Paris, but instead landed at another airport near
London and police captured the hijacker.
"There was no shooting and the hostages are
quite safe," an official spokesman said. The hostages
were the five crew members left aboard after the 46
passengers were freed at Heathrow Airport, where
the hijacking began on the ground.
The hijacker, dressed in Arab robes and armed
with a revolver and a grenade, seized the British

Airways BAClll soon after it arrived from
Manchester, Eqgland. The passengers were allowed
to disembark, but the pilot, copilot, two
stewardesses and one steward remained aboard.
North Vietnamese Forces Advance
SAIGON North Vietnamese forces widened
their territorial control yesterday in fighting less
than 100 miles north and east of Saigon. They
threatened a second provincial capital after
capturing Phuoc Binh, 75 miles north of Saigon, the
first to fall in nearly three years.
The provincial capital of Tay Ninh was menaced
after North Vietnamese forces captured the Black
Virgin Mountain base camp and communications
center 70 miles southwest of Phuoc Binh.
The Communist-led troops damaged most of the
signal equipment in the camp and forced 100
defenders to flee, the Saigon command said.
U.S. Reaffirms Paris Accords
WASHINGTON The United States still holds
North Vietnam bound to the 1973 Paris peace
accords on Vietnam despite the current Communist
capture of Phuoc Long province and its capital near
the Cambodian border, State Department
spokesman Robert Anderson said yesterday.
Anderson described the fall of the capital city of
Phuoc Binh as a "very serious matter" but
emphasized to reporters: "We do not consider this
abrogates the Paris agreement."
At the same time the Defense Department
sharply denied reports that a six-ship U.S. Navy task
force headed by the carrier Enterprise had left Subic
Bay in the Philippines for Vietnam waters.
It was learned that the task force actually is
heading for the Indian Ocean on what is described
as a routine mission of maneuvers and a number of
port calls.
President Ford was described by the White House
as watching the Vietnam situation closely. Press
Secretary Ron Nessen said the President discussed
developments at a morning conference with
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Maj. Gen.
Brent Scowcroft, deputy presidential assistant for
national security affairs.
Nuclear Plants Face Restrictions
WASHINGTON Electric utilities may have to
change the way they plan and build for the future if
other states follow Wisconsin's lead in restricting
construction of a new nuclear power plant.
The Wisconsin Public Service Commission has
ordered four utilities to limit spending and signing
contracts on the nuclear plant before the
commission decides whether to approve its
construction.
The commission also has declared that if it denies
permission to build the plant, any losses must be
absorbed by the utility stockholders and not be
passed along to customers.
Attorneys for citizens groups which have
challenged new power plants around the country
say adoption of the Wisconsin order by other
regulators would make shareholders more
responsible for their firms' expansion plans and
result in better energy planning.
Today's Weather
Showers today and partly cloudy tomorrow.
Colder today and much colder tomorrow. Lows
tonight in the 30s. Highs today lower to mid 50s
and tomorrow in the 40s. Small craft advisory for
northwest winds 20 to 35 mph today decreasing
tomorrow. Chance of rain 80 percent today.
Economy's Worst Postwar Year?
WASHINGTON The nation's economy may
have declined overall by two percent last year,
which would be one of the worst economic
performances in postwar history, Commerce
Department officials said yesterday.
James L. Pate, assistant commerce secretary for
economic affairs, said in an interview that the Gross
National Product probably fell at an annual rate of
between six and eight percent in the final three
months of 1974, which would be the fourth straight
quarterly drop in GNP.
The information on the dismal 1974
performance of the nation's economy came as White
House Press Secretary Ron Nessen told newsmen
President Ford might speed up his timetable for
announcing his new economic program.
Administration sources have said the President is
considering a tax cut ranging from $lO billion to
$2O billion in both corporation and individual
income taxes, but that the exact amount is still
undecided.
A Commerce Department spokesman said if Pate
is correct in estimating the GNP declined between
six and eight percent in the fourth quarter, it would
mean an overall drop in economic output of slightly
more than two percent in 1974.
Prop. 9 Faces Legal Roadblocks
SACRAMENTO California's tough new
election laws Prop. 9 went into effect yesterday
and immediately faced legal roadblocks in two
lawsuits challenging the laws' constitutionality.
The laws impose strict restrictions on the
activities of lobbyists, limit the amount of money a
candidate can spend to get elected, and compel
candidates to disclose campaign finances.
Various provisions of the 20,000-word initiative
were challenged in a hearing in Sacramento Superior
Court on a suit brought by the California Bankers'
Association and Assemblyman Alan Sieroty
(D-Beverly Hills).
The other lawsuit was filed on behalf of a group

of Sacramento'" most influential lobbyists by the
law firm of the father of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
The laws of Prop. 9 were overwhelmingly
approved by voters last June Brown supported the
political reform measure, his father has said he
will not be involved in the firm's handling of the
case.
Oil Workers Still Negotiating
DENVER - The president of the oil workers
union said he would not call a strike as contracts
with the nation's oil companies expired at midnight
yesterday.
A.F. Grospiron, president of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers International Union, said
contract negotiations would continue today.
The 430 individual contracts between the union
and the oil companies expired at midnight local
time yesterday.
Grospiron is the only person authorized to call a
strike. He said no decision had been made on
whether he would exercise that power later.

half the 41,000 residents of Darwin on Australia's
northern coast have been evacuated.
Damage to land, stock and fencing from the
bushfires is expected to reach millions of dollars.
Ash and smoke have carried 1400 miles to New
Zealand.
British Foil Hijacking
LONDON An Arab hijacker took over a British
jetliner yesterday and demanded to be flown to
France. The pilot took off on pretense of flying to
Paris, but instead landed at another airport near
London and police captured the hijacker.
"There was no shooting and the hostages are
quite safe," an official spokesman said. The hostages
were the five crew members left aboard after the 46
passengers were freed at Heathrow Airport, where
the hijacking began on the ground.
The hijacker, dressed in Arab robes and armed
with a revolver and a grenade, seized the British

Airways BAClll soon after it arrived from
Manchester, Eqgland. The passengers were allowed
to disembark, but the pilot, copilot, two
stewardesses and one steward remained aboard.
North Vietnamese Forces Advance
SAIGON North Vietnamese forces widened
their territorial control yesterday in fighting less
than 100 miles north and east of Saigon. They
threatened a second provincial capital after
capturing Phuoc Binh, 75 miles north of Saigon, the
first to fall in nearly three years.
The provincial capital of Tay Ninh was menaced
after North Vietnamese forces captured the Black
Virgin Mountain base camp and communications
center 70 miles southwest of Phuoc Binh.
The Communist-led troops damaged most of the
signal equipment in the camp and forced 100
defenders to flee, the Saigon command said.
U.S. Reaffirms Paris Accords
WASHINGTON The United States still holds
North Vietnam bound to the 1973 Paris peace
accords on Vietnam despite the current Communist
capture of Phuoc Long province and its capital near
the Cambodian border, State Department
spokesman Robert Anderson said yesterday.
Anderson described the fall of the capital city of
Phuoc Binh as a "very serious matter" but
emphasized to reporters: "We do not consider this
abrogates the Paris agreement."
At the same time the Defense Department
sharply denied reports that a six-ship U.S. Navy task
force headed by the carrier Enterprise had left Subic
Bay in the Philippines for Vietnam waters.
It was learned that the task force actually is
heading for the Indian Ocean on what is described
as a routine mission of maneuvers and a number of
port calls.
President Ford was described by the White House
as watching the Vietnam situation closely. Press
Secretary Ron Nessen said the President discussed
developments at a morning conference with
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Maj. Gen.
Brent Scowcroft, deputy presidential assistant for
national security affairs.
Nuclear Plants Face Restrictions
WASHINGTON Electric utilities may have to
change the way they plan and build for the future if
other states follow Wisconsin's lead in restricting
construction of a new nuclear power plant.
The Wisconsin Public Service Commission has
ordered four utilities to limit spending and signing
contracts on the nuclear plant before the
commission decides whether to approve its
construction.
The commission also has declared that if it denies
permission to build the plant, any losses must be
absorbed by the utility stockholders and not be
passed along to customers.
Attorneys for citizens groups which have
challenged new power plants around the country
say adoption of the Wisconsin order by other
regulators would make shareholders more
responsible for their firms' expansion plans and
result in better energy planning.

Economy's Worst Postwar Year?
WASHINGTON The nation's economy may
have declined overall by two percent last year,
which would be one of the worst economic
performances in postwar history, Commerce
Department officials said yesterday.
James L. Pate, assistant commerce secretary for
economic affairs, said in an interview that the Gross
National Product probably fell at an annual rate of
between six and eight percent in the final three
months of 1974, which would be the fourth straight
quarterly drop in GNP.
The information on the dismal 1974
performance of the nation's economy came as White
House Press Secretary Ron Nessen told newsmen
President Ford might speed up his timetable for
announcing his new economic program.
Administration sources have said the President is
considering a tax cut ranging from $lO billion to
$2O billion in both corporation and individual
income taxes, but that the exact amount is still
undecided.
A Commerce Department spokesman said if Pate
is correct in estimating the GNP declined between
six and eight percent in the fourth quarter, it would
mean an overall drop in economic output of slightly
more than two percent in 1974.
Prop. 9 Faces Legal Roadblocks
SACRAMENTO California's tough new
election laws Prop. 9 went into effect yesterday
and immediately faced legal roadblocks in two
lawsuits challenging the laws' constitutionality.
The laws impose strict restrictions on the
activities of lobbyists, limit the amount of money a
candidate can spend to get elected, and compel
candidates to disclose campaign finances.
Various provisions of the 20,000-word initiative
were challenged in a hearing in Sacramento Superior
Court on a suit brought by the California Bankers'
Association and Assemblyman Alan Sieroty
(D-Beverly Hills).
The other lawsuit was filed on behalf of a group

of Sacramento'" most influential lobbyists by the
law firm of the father of Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
The laws of Prop. 9 were overwhelmingly
approved by voters last June Brown supported the
political reform measure, his father has said he
will not be involved in the firm's handling of the
case.
Oil Workers Still Negotiating
DENVER - The president of the oil workers
union said he would not call a strike as contracts
with the nation's oil companies expired at midnight
yesterday.
A.F. Grospiron, president of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers International Union, said
contract negotiations would continue today.
The 430 individual contracts between the union
and the oil companies expired at midnight local
time yesterday.
Grospiron is the only person authorized to call a
strike. He said no decision had been made on
whether he would exercise that power later.
Brown Begins 'Austere' Term
SACRAMENTO Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.
promised an austere administration, and that's the
way it looked yesterday on his first working day in
the Capitol.
The walls were bare and most of the bookcases
were empty in the 16-by-16-foot governor's office
that Ronald Reagan moved out of last Friday.
Brown was talking about an overall approach to
state government about making a dent in a budget
of $ll billion or so when he spoke.of cost cutting
in his Monday inaugural address.
He set his own office and lifestyle as examples,
giving up Reagan's limousine and executive jet,
refusing to live in the partially constructed
governor's mansion when it is finished, and calling
for seven percent cuts in salaries of the governor's
personal staff.
Brown met yesterday individually with staff
members and then with Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy and Senate President pro tem James Mills.
New Disaster Hits Australia
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA Disaster-battered
Australia now is facing a "once in a lifetime" wave
of bushfires that has blackened vast areas of grazing
land and burned thousands of sheep alive.
The bushfire season, just two months old and
likely to last until March, has already left more land
burned than the areas of Montana, North Dakota,
Colorado and Wyoming combined.
These fires and a cyclone that wiped out most of
Darwin on Christmas Day have combined to inflict
an unusual dose of disaster on Australia. More than
half the 41,000 residents of Darwin on Australia's
northern coast have been evacuated.
Damage to land, stock and fencing from the
bushfires is expected to reach millions of dollars.
Ash and smoke have carried 1400 miles to New
Zealand.
