# Student Panel Given Row House Sketches
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The architects for the three
proposed Row houses have submitted
preliminary sketches to the Student
Advisory Committee on Row Houses,
committee co-chairperson Ann Carter
said yesterday.
The $3.6 million project is "right
on schedule," according to Assoc.
Dean of Students Larry Horton.
At its December meeting, the Board
of Trustees approved both the site
(Mayfield Avenue) and the size (150
beds) of the plan. The Trustees also
ratified the $1.3 million project to
convert breezeways on the ground
floor of Florence Moore Hall into
living spaces for approximately 100
students.
Financing
The Row house project will be
financed with money from a fund
raising campaign. The University will
obtain loans for both projects, which
will be paid back with income from
rents.
The committee will consider the
sketches next week before it submits
more finalized drawings to the
Trustees' Committee on Land and
Building, Senior University Planner
Robert Nerrie remarked.
The sketches depict three unique
and autonomous three-story buildings
constructed of wood with a stucco
finish. Each house provides space for
student rooms on the first floor,
bicycle storage and a small study room
that can be converted to a game room,
Carter said.
Generally Pleased
The committee members who saw
the sketches during Christmas vacation
were generally pleased with the plans,
Carter remarked. However, a two-story

well above the living room in one of
the proposed houses has prompted
some controversy, she noted.
Director of University Housing
Edward Scoles, an ex-officio
committee member, stated, In
general I'm very pleased with the
architectural planning. However, I've
got some doubts about the well."
He explained that the well, like the
one in Meyer Library, could become a
haven for frisbee and paper airplane
enthusiasts and that the noise would
disturb students in their rooms.
Quiet
Nerrie remarked that the architects
Bull, Field, Volkmann and
Stockwel'l do not consider the
allusion to Meyer "a fair comparison."
He said the architects contend that the
rooms are far enough away from the
well to preserve quiet.
Nerrie emphasized that the sketches
are not the final drawings. He
mentioned that the architects already
have had to alter two of the buildings
because they are "quite a bit
oversized." Also they are considering
abolishing a partial basement in one of
the houses.
Carter remarked that the plans
would be "more or less finalized by
Jan. 15," the date of the committee's
final meeting, before they are
submitted to the Land and Buildings
Committee. She expects her
committee to have little influence
after that date.
Nerrie retorted that if any
substantial changes are requested
during the committee meeting, the
meeting with the Land and Building
Committee could be postponed.

Generally Pleased
The committee members who saw
the sketches during Christmas vacation
were generally pleased with the plans,
Carter remarked. However, a two-story

well above the living room in one of
the proposed houses has prompted
some controversy, she noted.
Director of University Housing
Edward Scoles, an ex-officio
committee member, stated, In
general I'm very pleased with the
architectural planning. However, I've
got some doubts about the well."
He explained that the well, like the
one in Meyer Library, could become a
haven for frisbee and paper airplane
enthusiasts and that the noise would
disturb students in their rooms.
Quiet
Nerrie remarked that the architects
Bull, Field, Volkmann and
Stockwel'l do not consider the
allusion to Meyer "a fair comparison."
He said the architects contend that the
rooms are far enough away from the
well to preserve quiet.
Nerrie emphasized that the sketches
are not the final drawings. He
mentioned that the architects already
have had to alter two of the buildings
because they are "quite a bit
oversized." Also they are considering
abolishing a partial basement in one of
the houses.
Carter remarked that the plans
would be "more or less finalized by
Jan. 15," the date of the committee's
final meeting, before they are
submitted to the Land and Buildings
Committee. She expects her
committee to have little influence
after that date.
Nerrie retorted that if any
substantial changes are requested
during the committee meeting, the
meeting with the Land and Building
Committee could be postponed.
The architects for the three
proposed Row houses have submitted
preliminary sketches to the Student
Advisory Committee on Row Houses,
committee co-chairperson Ann Carter
said yesterday.
The $3.6 million project is "right
on schedule," according to Assoc.
Dean of Students Larry Horton.
At its December meeting, the Board
of Trustees approved both the site
(Mayfield Avenue) and the size (150
beds) of the plan. The Trustees also
ratified the $1.3 million project to
convert breezeways on the ground
floor of Florence Moore Hall into
living spaces for approximately 100
students.
Financing
The Row house project will be
financed with money from a fund
raising campaign. The University will
obtain loans for both projects, which
will be paid back with income from
rents.
The committee will consider the
sketches next week before it submits
more finalized drawings to the
Trustees' Committee on Land and
Building, Senior University Planner
Robert Nerrie remarked.
The sketches depict three unique
and autonomous three-story buildings
constructed of wood with a stucco
finish. Each house provides space for
student rooms on the first floor,
bicycle storage and a small study room
that can be converted to a game room,
Carter said.
