# Budget Slash Wipes Out Some Custodial Services
## 
### 
University office areas may not be
as spic and span as they once were
because yet another special service
daily vacuum cleaning of floors bit
A the dust recently.
* Jason Mavis, director of plant
services, announced last month that
some custodial services have been cut
by half.
"We maintain full services to
essential areas such as building
entrances, bathrooms and eating areas
* - and have curtailed services for
vacuuming and sweeping floors and
wastepaper basket emptying on
alternate days," Mavis explained.
"Higher traffic areas are done on
Monday-Wednesday-Friday and other
areas are done Tuesday-Thursday."
4 Dormitories are unaffected by the
cutbacks. "Dorms are handled by
student housing and by food services,
Mavis said.
Two independent contractmg firms,

American Building Maintenance
(ABM) and Pacific Maintenance,
handle all custodial work in office
areas, Mavis noted.
"All of our maintenance work is
farmed out, to ABM and to Pacific
Maintenance. They've gone to 'skip'
cleaning," Mavis observed, adding that
"about 10 contracted employees were
laid off from here" as part of an
economy move.
The savings will amount to about
$176,000 a year, according to
University figures. The total reduction
is 12 percent of the old custodial
budget.
The first week of reduced service
went fairly smoothly, according to
Mavis, although there were minor
difficulties and adjustments.
"The University community's
patience and help are needed to make
this budget reduction work," Mavis
said.
