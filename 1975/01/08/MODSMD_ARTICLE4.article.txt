# Budget Committee Confirms University Economic Woes
## 
### DON COX 
Following a review of the economic
forecast for the University and the
basic premises behind the projection
of the growing budgetary crisis, the
University Budget Priorities Advisory
Commission has confirmed the serious
dimensions of the economic squeeze
gripping Stanford.
The basic assumptions underlying
the University's planned $lO million
budget-cutting program are
"reasonable," the Commission said in
a report to President Lyman
yesterday.
"There is no question but that
there will be less money available than
can sustain all existing programs,
academic and non-academic, at their
current levels, and therefore there
must over the years 1975-78 be
substantial cuts in programs and
operations throughout the
University," the report said.
Some members of the commission
felt that the economic problem facing
Stanford "might turn out to be
larger."

In addition to confirming the
magnitude of the belt-tightening
program needed, the commission felt a
period of "three years to reach a point
of financial equilibrium seems
reasonable. A longer interval would
extend the period of uncertainty and
delay the taking of necessary action."
Stabilization
However, the commission
recognized the need to lengthen this
time interval for financial adjustments
that would result in further
stabilization. University Press Director
Leon Seltzer, chairman of the
commission, explained that changes in
some current programs might take
some time in light of anticipated
opposition to such changes.
Changing the direction of these
programs is "like trying to turn the
Queen Mary with a paddle" and might
require additional time, Seltzer said.
Because of the serious nature of
budget-cutting decisions affecting,
academic programs, the commission
observed there might be a predictable
increase in the tension between
segments of the University.
Vice Provost for Budget and
Planning Raymond Bacchetti, a
member of the commission, said this

tension might not materialize due to
the great attention paid to the
economic problem by members of the
academic community and the
increased candor of the University
administration.
"Tension is generally the product
of people not knowing what is
happening," he said.
Suggestions for budget-cutting
measures have come not only from the
principal administrators involved, but
also from other interested persons,
Bacchetti said. The commission has
received 10 to 20 letters with such
ideas, he said.
'Fundamental Problem'
Ten University department heads
concerned that the budget crisis is "a
fundamental problem impinging on
the educational goals, quality, and
viability of the University" have
drafted a statement outlining
questions they feel the Faculty Senate

should consider in light of this
problem.
The questions relate to
participation by the faculty in overall
planning and budget reduction
decisions, development of a new
educational philosophy to guide
budget decisions, the possibility of
making cuts in non-teaching support
services before actually cutting into
academic programs, and concern over
faculty salaries.
The questions will be discussed in a
special Faculty Senate meeting Jan.
16.
The commission had spent the last
months gathering information and
"getting a sense of the situation"
Seltzer said. He said it would be a
while before the commission actually
began to establish any specific
priorities or make any decisions
concerning the fate of specific
academic programs.
