# Federal Bill May Fund New Hoover Building
## 
### 
President Gerald Ford last week
signed a bill that will provide $7
million in federal funds, on a
one-to-one matching basis, for the
construction and equipping of a third
building at the Hoover Institution.
The purpose of the bill, passed by
Congress Dec. 19 and signed by the
President Jan. 2, is "to recognize the
50 years of extraordinary and selfless
public service of Herbert
Hoover . .. and in commemoration of
the 100 th anniversary of his birth on
Aug. 10,1974."
The new building will be located
behind the Lou Henry Hoover
Building and will have six stories,
including two beneath ground level,
. according to preliminary plans.
The plan calls for offices and space
for the Hoover Institution archives and
special collections. In addition, the
building could house the Center for
International Studies here.
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell expressed confidence
that the University would be able to
raise enough money to match the
federal funds.
Contributions
He said he based his judgment on
the amount of contributions made to
the Hoover Institution in the last 15
years. The Institution received more
than $2 million last year.
University President Richard W.
Lyman said, "We are delighted at the
passage of this bill. I can think of no
more appropriate memorial to such an
outstanding Stanford alumnus. The

new Hoover building will be a most
useful addition to the University
community."
Campbell added, "It is very fitting
that Congress' tribute to Herbert
Hoover should be in the form of a
living memorial. Many of the
progressive ideas and policies
advocated by Herbert Hoover
regarding international
humanitarianism, labor, the
environment and reorganization of the
government are as relevant today as
ever.
Education
"In particular, Mr. Hoover was
always interested in education as
demonstrated by his key role in the
founding of the Stanford Business
School and the Food Research
Institute at Stanford, as well as the
Hoover Institution," Campbell said.
"In these trying times for the
academic community, we should all be
inspired by Herbert Hoover's lifelong
dedication to higher education," he
said.
Congress passed the bill just one
day after the House of Representatives
passed a $3O million Truman Memorial
Scholarship program.
Congress gave grants serving as
Presidential memorials to three other
institutions in recent years: the
Eisenhower College in Seneca Falls,
N.Y.; the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars in
Washington D.C.; and the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts, also in
Washington, D.C.

more appropriate memorial to such an
outstanding Stanford alumnus. The

new Hoover building will be a most
useful addition to the University
community."
Campbell added, "It is very fitting
that Congress' tribute to Herbert
Hoover should be in the form of a
living memorial. Many of the
progressive ideas and policies
advocated by Herbert Hoover
regarding international
humanitarianism, labor, the
environment and reorganization of the
government are as relevant today as
ever.
Education
"In particular, Mr. Hoover was
always interested in education as
demonstrated by his key role in the
founding of the Stanford Business
School and the Food Research
Institute at Stanford, as well as the
Hoover Institution," Campbell said.
"In these trying times for the
academic community, we should all be
inspired by Herbert Hoover's lifelong
dedication to higher education," he
said.
Congress passed the bill just one
day after the House of Representatives
passed a $3O million Truman Memorial
Scholarship program.
Congress gave grants serving as
Presidential memorials to three other
institutions in recent years: the
Eisenhower College in Seneca Falls,
N.Y.; the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars in
Washington D.C.; and the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts, also in
Washington, D.C.
President Gerald Ford last week
signed a bill that will provide $7
million in federal funds, on a
one-to-one matching basis, for the
construction and equipping of a third
building at the Hoover Institution.
The purpose of the bill, passed by
Congress Dec. 19 and signed by the
President Jan. 2, is "to recognize the
50 years of extraordinary and selfless
public service of Herbert
Hoover . .. and in commemoration of
the 100 th anniversary of his birth on
Aug. 10,1974."
The new building will be located
behind the Lou Henry Hoover
Building and will have six stories,
including two beneath ground level,
. according to preliminary plans.
The plan calls for offices and space
for the Hoover Institution archives and
special collections. In addition, the
building could house the Center for
International Studies here.
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell expressed confidence
that the University would be able to
raise enough money to match the
federal funds.
Contributions
He said he based his judgment on
the amount of contributions made to
the Hoover Institution in the last 15
years. The Institution received more
than $2 million last year.
University President Richard W.
Lyman said, "We are delighted at the
passage of this bill. I can think of no
more appropriate memorial to such an
outstanding Stanford alumnus. The

new Hoover building will be a most
useful addition to the University
community."
