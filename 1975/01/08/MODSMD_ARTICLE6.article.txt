# Lymphoma Study To Aid Research
## Scientists Grow Cancer Cells 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Medical School researchers have made an important
advance in the study of lymphomas, or cancers of the
lymph glands, by growing tumor cells from patients in the
laboratory, it was announced yesterday.
The researchers, medical and graduate student Alan
Epstein and Radiology Prof. Henry Kaplan, used new lab
techniques to raise the cells, the first of their kind to be
grown in culture.
Cells from solid tumors, such as lung cancer tumors,
have been grown outside of the human body for 20 to 30
years, according to Epstein. But, with one specific
exception, lymphoma and leukemia cells have not survived

and grown in the laboratory, he added.
Epstein said the results with lymphoma cells will aid
research of all cancers of the immune system, including
leukemia. Lymphoma and leukemia together account for
roughly 10 percent of all cancer cases, he explained.
Treatment Study Now Possible
Epstein and Kaplan's advance with lymphoma cells will
open the door for studies of drugs for chemical therapy and
radiation treatment of the disease as well as improve
diagnostic techniques.
Once lymphoma is diagnosed in a patient, doctors will
be able to test the effectiveness of various chemical and
radiation therapies on the patient's own tumor cells
removed and grown in the laboratory. Doctors will then
save time and keep the patient off deleterious drugs by
experimenting on the lab cells to find the most effective
treatment.
Previous treatment has been "random guess," according
to Epstein.
The lymphoma cells grown came from three patients
with histiocytic lymphoma, one of the most malignant
lymph system cancers. Patients suffering from this type of

lymphoma are seldom given more than
six months to live, the researcher
explained.
Only Burkitt's lymphoma, a cancer
found in African children, has been
grown successfully in culture before.
These cells, however, are almost
always infected with a virus which
gives them the ability to grow
continuously outside of the body.
Normal lymphoma cells do not carry
this virus, and hence die in the
laboratory.
Besides aiding treatment, the new
cells can be used in the search for
cancer growth factors and in
immunotherapy research, finding
natural body immunity against cancer.
"This part of the research is
extremely valuable," Epstein
commented. "For the first time we
will be able to conduct genetic type
studies on these cells."
The cultured cells were remarkably
similar to the actual body-grown cells,
the researchers reported in the
December issue of Cancer , the journal
of the American Cancer Society.
The malignant cells had the human

chromosomes and the same
chromosomal abnormalities that the
original cells had, even when injected
into the bodies of animals.
The cells were examined by two
doctors in Philadelphia, who
confirmed the absence of the
herpes-like virus that infects Burkitt's
lymphoma.
Epstein said he has been working
on the project for two and a half years
now and plans to continue work on
immune cell cancer, perhaps even
working on establishing a leukemia cell
strain in culture.
He complimented Kaplan as being
an excellent preceptor, an individual
who not only sought the project's
funds, but who advised and backed the
student "all the way."
Epstein and Kaplan suggested that
most of their success hinged upon the
development of new cell culture
methods that enabled the rapid testing
of a large number of factors.
The dividing tumor cell requires a
critical balance of nutrients, growth
factors and environmental conditions
to survive in the laboratory,
