# Lymphoma Study To Aid Research
## Scientists Grow Cancer Cells 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Medical School researchers have made an important
advance in the study of lymphomas, or cancers of the
lymph glands, by growing tumor cells from patients in the
laboratory, it was announced yesterday.
The researchers, medical and graduate student Alan
Epstein and Radiology Prof. Henry Kaplan, used new lab
techniques to raise the cells, the first of their kind to be
grown in culture.
Cells from solid tumors, such as lung cancer tumors,
have been grown outside of the human body for 20 to 30
years, according to Epstein. But, with one specific
exception, lymphoma and leukemia cells have not survived

and grown in the laboratory, he added.
Epstein said the results with lymphoma cells will aid
research of all cancers of the immune system, including
leukemia. Lymphoma and leukemia together account for
roughly 10 percent of all cancer cases, he explained.
Treatment Study Now Possible
Epstein and Kaplan's advance with lymphoma cells will
open the door for studies of drugs for chemical therapy and
radiation treatment of the disease as well as improve
diagnostic techniques.
Once lymphoma is diagnosed in a patient, doctors will
be able to test the effectiveness of various chemical and
radiation therapies on the patient's own tumor cells
removed and grown in the laboratory. Doctors will then
save time and keep the patient off deleterious drugs by
experimenting on the lab cells to find the most effective
treatment.
Previous treatment has been "random guess," according
to Epstein.
The lymphoma cells grown came from three patients
with histiocytic lymphoma, one of the most malignant
lymph system cancers. Patients suffering from this type of
