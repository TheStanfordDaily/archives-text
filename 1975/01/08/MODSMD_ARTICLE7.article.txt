# Difficult Decisions

### John Freed 
Shortly after the University
announced next year's 12.9
percent tuition hike nearly four
percent above next year's
anticipated inflation rate
Stanford issued more grim news.
We should expect tuition hikes
"significantly" above the rate of
inflation into the indefinite
future.
This depressing announcement
came in the University's annual
financial report a series of
essays explaining numerous pie
charts and tables of statistics.
Pieced together, however, the
various sections of the report
point to one conclusion: Stanford
as we now know it could be in big
financial trouble on the long haul.
". .. institutions like Stanford
have passed from an era of robust
financial growth to one of
determined and systematic
belt-tightening. The pleasant state
of affairs which characterized our
development in the 1950s and
1960s has largely vanished.. ."
President Richard Lyman
declared.
Assuming that the University
does not radically restructure
itself, and assuming that Stanford
continues to support new
programs which have merit, then
the following undesirable choices
are on the road ahead:
—raising tuition at incredibly
high rates. The diversity of the
student body would go down the
drain, and with it, the quality of
the University.
back on outdated or
less important programs. The
problem here is that there are
only so many programs that can
be cut back before the diversity of
course offerings vanishes. Further,
large numbers of faculty and staff
positions would have to shift a
difficult task tending to create
departmental chaos.
—spending more endowment
income on operating expenses.
University administrators
correctly point out that less , not
mqre endowment income should
be spent on expenses. The money
would be better spent by
reinvesting for a larger return
thus, by spending a constant
percentage of endowment income,
the amount (in dollars) spent
would rise from year to year.
—receiving miraculous gifts or
government grants. Not only is
this unlikely, given the present
state of the economy and federal
attitudes toward higher education,
but such hopes can actually be

self-defeating.
Administrators who are trying
to find a goose that lays golden
eggs aren't the ones coming up
with intelligent solutions to the
difficult problems the University
faces.
There are two other options
left open to the University.
Stanford can either go through a
massive restructuring with
changes in the number of faculty,
staff and students or it can
refuse to support any new
programs.
By refusing to support new
programs, of course, the course
offerings here would immediately
stagnate; the best students would
desert the place in droves; and
once again the quality of the
University would dramatically
diminish.
On the other hand, a shift in
the numbers of persons hired by
or enrolled at Stanford could
prove beneficial or disastrous.
A sudden (or even planned)
increase in the number of students
would be a monetary bonus to the
school since costs-per-student
would decrease while presumably
tuition would increase. But future
over-enrollment is not a pleasant
thought witness today's housing
crunch and the side effects
thereby created, such as possible
abolition of independent
on-campus fraternities.
Another possibility would be a
decrease in faculty. The
University could get rid of
non-tenured teachers (and, of
course, the University hasn't
extended tenure to anyone in
years how convenient). The
concomitant rise in
student-faculty ratios and
probable decrease in teaching
effectiveness seem to argue against
this plan of action.
So we are left with staff
reductions. This could accurately
be read as student-services
reductions. The University took a
needed step in this direction
recently by consolidating two
administrative posts when Robert
Rosenzweig was named vice
president for public affairs.
In the last decade, Stanford
added some 900 students, 300
faculty members and 1400
staffers. The possibility of staff
layoffs exists, but remains
unlikely in the near future,
according to University officials.
Maybe they should think
twice.
