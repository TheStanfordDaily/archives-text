Kepler's
is a Store for
Students
and
Scholars
There are few bookstores
where you can find serious
and scholarly books pub
lished more than two or
three years ago. For the
most part you'll find
Bestsellers and current
fiction and nonfiction.
But at Kepler's we stock
a permanent inventory
of paperbacks on almost
every subject known to
human kind. If it's in
print, we try to have it.
Browse through a
Kepler's store this week
