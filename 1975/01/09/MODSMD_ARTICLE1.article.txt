# Sirica Frees Three Nixon Assistants
## 
### 
t WASHINGTON (AP) - John W.
Dean 111 and Jeb Stuart Magruder,
whose disclosures to prosecutors broke
apart the Watergate cover-up, were
freed from prison yesterday after
having served only part of their terms.
Herbert W. Kalmbach, one-time
%>ersonal lawyer to former President
Richard M. Nixon, also was freed.
"Thank God, I'm free," said
Magruder as he was released from Ft.
Holabird, Md., a few hours after U.S.
District Judge John J. Sirica issued his
order.
# Dean drove away in his own car,
avoiding waiting newsmen.
Kalmbach was the first released. He
was in the special Watergate
prosecutor's office at the time of the
Sirica announcement and was freed
from custody immediately.
4| 'Profound Gratitude'
Shortly after, he appeared in the
office of his Washington attorney and
read a prepared statement expressing
"profound gratitude for the
compassion of Judge Sirica and
renewed appreciation and confidence
the essential fairness of American
justice."
In another Watergate-related
development, U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell turned down
applications by the three broadcast
networks and others who wanted to
copy some White House Watergate
Tapes for public broadcast and
phonograph recordings.
Gesell ruled the applicants had
failed to come up with a plan to
prevent commercialization or
undignified use of the recent
Watergate cover-up trial. He dismissed
%ie application "without prejudice"
meaning the matter can be raised
again, but next time before Sirica.
'Time Served'
Sirica ordered the prison terms of
Dean, Magruder and Kalmbach
reduced to "time served." Dean had
■#>een in prison slightly more than four
months, Magruder seven months and
Kalmbach six.
Asked whether the pardon of
Nixon played any part in his action,
Sirica said he took a number of
matters under consideration. He
to comment further with
regard to the Nixon pardon.
Sirica acted under section 35 of the
federal rules of criminal procedure,
which provides for reduction of
sentence at the judge's discretion in
some instances.
m All three men had applied to Sirica
for reduction of sentence.
Pleaded Guilty
The three had pleaded guilty to
felonies; Dean and Magruder to one
count each of obstructing justice and
Kalmbach to violating the Federal
Practice Act, as well as to a
misdemeanor charge of promising an
ambassadorship in return for a
campaign contribution.
Dean, who had been legal counsel
to President Richard M. Nixon, began
serving a one to four year term on
Sept. 3. Magrurier, the deputy director
of Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign,
entered prison on June 4 to begin a
10-month to four year term.
Kalmbach had served six months of a
six to 18 month term.
Their release leaves only one major
Watergate figure, former presidential
counsel Charles W. Colson, still in
prison. But many others including
the four Nixon lieutenants convicted
New Year's Day are under sentence
or awaiting outcome of appeals to
begin or resume prison terms.
In yet another development,
attorneys for Ehrlichman filed papers
Tuesday asking Sirica to overturn the
Jan. 1 verdict or to order a new trial.

Sirica acted under section 35 of the
federal rules of criminal procedure,

Kalmbach to violating the Federal
Practice Act, as well as to a
misdemeanor charge of promising an
ambassadorship in return for a
campaign contribution.
