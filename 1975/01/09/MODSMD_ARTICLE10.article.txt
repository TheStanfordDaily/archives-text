# Failure Of Ford's Clemency Plan
## 
### Bill Evers 
President Ford's "earned re-entry"
clemency program has apparently been
rejected by the vast bulk of draft resisters
and military deserters. The program ends on
Jan. 31, and the response so far from exile
groups, from their supporters in the U.S. and
from individual resisters and deserters has
been one of political rejection.
The New York Times has reported that
one key processing body in the clemency
program the Presidential Clemency Board
has received only 890 applications out of a
potential of 100,000 applicants. The seeming
failure of Ford's plan now reopens the
political possibility of universal and
unconditional amnesty for all those who
resisted the military or the draft system
during the Viet Nam war.
Now with a new Congress, grass-roots
pressure and a display of intensity of popular
interest in amnesty could alter the political
considerations of decision-makers in
Washington. The barriers to full amnesty will
crack only in the face of substantial public
pressure. So what is needed are letters to
editors of local newspapers, letters to
political officials, rallies and exposures of
what the injustices of the military and the
draft have been.
'Escaped Slaves'
Central to the Ford earned re-entry plan
has been the concept that the government
somehow owned the lives of its subjects and
that the "escaped slaves" would acknowledge

the authority of their masters by bedpan
service in a manner designated by the
government. As a token of this lord-subject
relationship, those processed under Ford's
plan had to take a loyalty oath in which they
affirmed their obligations to labor for the
U.S. government.
Instead of America's glorious liberal
heritage which proclaims that every person
has a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, we find in Ford's program the
language of feudal obligation reminiscent of
the Dark Ages. Some opponents of amnesty
even speak about a supposed debt that draft
resisters and deserters owe.
What is the origin of this debt? Do persons
who have fled involuntary servitude (draft
resisters) or those who have simply quit or
retired from jobs they were engaged in
(deserters) owe a debt to the government
that has tried to enslave them? If anything, it
.is they who are the victims and the
government officials who owe them
compensation.
Victimizers •
Opponents of amnesty sometimes deploy
an emotionally charged argument that
attempts to turn the victims who deserve
justice (the resisters and deserters) into
victimizers who deserve punishment. This
argument contends that those who resisted
conscription or deserted made it necessary
for others to take their place. Undoubtedly
many of those who took the places of the

reisisters were killed or suffered as prisoners
of war.
But we must look behind this
emotion-laden sleight of hand. The whole
argument rests on the false assumption that,
in the words of Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown, "it was the resisters
and deserters who sent American troops to
Viet Nam, not the policies of Rogers, Nixon,
Agnew, Humphrey, Johnson, Rusk and all
the others who issued the orders."
Resisting the draft and deserting the
military are political crimes. They are not of
the same kind or quality as stealing or
committing assault. They are political
offenses that challenged U.S. government
policies government policies which were by
nature attacks upon American liberties and
threats to the freedom of peoples in other
lands. The legal status of these political
crimes should be changed simply by
abolishing their formally criminal character
through a blanket amnesty.
What is needed is not forgiveness by the
government of those who mistakenly
opposed governmental policy (which is what
Ford's clemency program implies). What is
•needed is a righting of a wrong done by the
government, a moral step that will only be
taken if the government receives major
pressure from the people.

crack only in the face of substantial public

'Escaped Slaves'
Central to the Ford earned re-entry plan
has been the concept that the government
somehow owned the lives of its subjects and
that the "escaped slaves" would acknowledge

the authority of their masters by bedpan
service in a manner designated by the
government. As a token of this lord-subject
relationship, those processed under Ford's
plan had to take a loyalty oath in which they
affirmed their obligations to labor for the
U.S. government.
Instead of America's glorious liberal
heritage which proclaims that every person
has a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, we find in Ford's program the
language of feudal obligation reminiscent of
the Dark Ages. Some opponents of amnesty
even speak about a supposed debt that draft
resisters and deserters owe.
What is the origin of this debt? Do persons
who have fled involuntary servitude (draft
resisters) or those who have simply quit or
retired from jobs they were engaged in
(deserters) owe a debt to the government
that has tried to enslave them? If anything, it
.is they who are the victims and the
government officials who owe them
compensation.
Victimizers •
Opponents of amnesty sometimes deploy
an emotionally charged argument that
attempts to turn the victims who deserve
justice (the resisters and deserters) into
victimizers who deserve punishment. This
argument contends that those who resisted
conscription or deserted made it necessary
for others to take their place. Undoubtedly
many of those who took the places of the

reisisters were killed or suffered as prisoners
of war.
But we must look behind this
emotion-laden sleight of hand. The whole
argument rests on the false assumption that,
in the words of Religious Studies Prof.
Robert McAfee Brown, "it was the resisters
and deserters who sent American troops to
Viet Nam, not the policies of Rogers, Nixon,
Agnew, Humphrey, Johnson, Rusk and all
the others who issued the orders."
Resisting the draft and deserting the
military are political crimes. They are not of
the same kind or quality as stealing or
committing assault. They are political
offenses that challenged U.S. government
policies government policies which were by
nature attacks upon American liberties and
threats to the freedom of peoples in other
lands. The legal status of these political
crimes should be changed simply by
abolishing their formally criminal character
through a blanket amnesty.
What is needed is not forgiveness by the
government of those who mistakenly
opposed governmental policy (which is what
Ford's clemency program implies). What is
•needed is a righting of a wrong done by the
government, a moral step that will only be
taken if the government receives major
pressure from the people.

President Ford's "earned re-entry"
clemency program has apparently been
rejected by the vast bulk of draft resisters
and military deserters. The program ends on
Jan. 31, and the response so far from exile
groups, from their supporters in the U.S. and
from individual resisters and deserters has
been one of political rejection.
The New York Times has reported that
one key processing body in the clemency
program the Presidential Clemency Board
has received only 890 applications out of a
potential of 100,000 applicants. The seeming
failure of Ford's plan now reopens the
political possibility of universal and
unconditional amnesty for all those who
resisted the military or the draft system
during the Viet Nam war.
Now with a new Congress, grass-roots
pressure and a display of intensity of popular
interest in amnesty could alter the political
considerations of decision-makers in
Washington. The barriers to full amnesty will
crack only in the face of substantial public
pressure. So what is needed are letters to
