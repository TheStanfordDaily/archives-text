# Cuba: Time To Delete The Expletive
## 
### Mark Patton 
The presence of Communist
Cuba off the Florida coast has
sent chills down the spines of
many Americans.
During the Soviet missile crisis
and the Bay of Pigs incident of
the early 19605, most Americans
spent their free time digging bomb
shelters. They weren't exactly the
happy days.
But now, more than a decade
later, we have the opportunity to
defuse that powder keg to the
southeast. Detente with Cuba is
apparently there for the asking.
The two essential questions the
United States must consider are
what we would have to do to
improve relations with Cuba, and
whether such measures would be
worth it.
There are six main ingredients
of the Cuban Resolution of 1962
that would have to be changed.
These points all revolve around
what the Cubans call "the
blockade."
No U.S.-Cuban Trade
First of all, the U.S. does not
allow direct or indirect trade
between itself and Cuba. Not only
is selling goods to Cuba
disallowed, but selling to a third
buyer who would then ship the
merchandise to Cuba is also
forbidden.
Additionally, no country that
receives economic aid or credit
from the U.S. may trade with
Cuba, and no ship which has
called at a Cuban port may then
call at an American port.
At the insistance of the U.S.,
Cuba is also excluded from the
Organization of American States
(OAS) and other hemispheric
groups, and is no longer a
participant in the U.S. sugar
quota.
The final segment of the
present Cuban policy disallows
diplomatic ties between the U.S.
and Cuba. Therefore, there is no
direct travel between Havana and
American cities, and U.S. citizens
in Cuba must be represented by
the Swiss embassy.
Who Hates Whom?
These policies have been set
because revolutionary
governments particularly those
of Communistic flavors are not
looked upon fondly by our
leaders. Thanks to the CIA, our
disgusting role in the bloody
overthrow of the elected Chilean
socialistic government provided

that.
The fears of Communism, so
devilishly implanted into the
American mentality by Joe
McCarthy and John Foster Dulles,
are still very real to some people.
They believe that it will not be
long before Red Chinese guerillas
land in Santa Monica and the
Soviets take the eastern front
somewhere around Hyannis Port,
Mass. The obvious move by Cuba
would be to attack from the rear.
Right?
(Expletive Deleted)
It's no wonder then that Cuba
has become a four-letter word of
the most vile sort.
But even though most
Americans dislike aggressive
Communism, Castro and what the
revolution did to Cuba's
governmental structure,
maintaining negative policies
toward Cuba serves no useful
purpose. Cuba certainly hasn't
sunk into the Atlantic because of
them.
Before the revolution, the U.S.
accounted for 80 percent of
Cuban trade. After the revolution,
when the U.S. severed its trade
relations with Cuba, the Soviet

Union picked up the slack. The
Russians now account for 80
percent of Cuban trade.
But what has happened to the
soul of Cuba? Has the acid of
socialism scorched the liberties of
the Cuban people?
Unexotic Existence
Sen. Clairborne Pell (D-R.1.),
who is a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee,
recently visited Cuba with Sen.
Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.). What
they didn't find was the exotic
Cuba of a decade and a half ago.
There are no more luxury shops,
bright lights, American advertising
and traffic jams. Cuba's exciting
night life is a thing of the past.
On the other hand, they did
find provincial towns and the
countryside buzzing with
construction. New schools,
hospitals, clinics and housing
complexes spring up every day.
The fruits of Castro's
government include the best
psychiatric hospital in Latin
America. Cuba also has the lowest
infant mortality rate of all Latin
America and illiteracy has almost
been wiped out.

Frank Mankiewicz, author and
former press secretary for Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy, recently
visited Cuba to film a television
documentary. He came back
without finding one child with the
classic signs of malnutrition or a
ghetto surrounding Havana as in
almost every other Latin capital.
Castro, Si!
There is also almost unanimous
support of the Castro government
in Cuba. This is primarily because
domestic opposition left Cuba
after the revolution.
Aside from these points, it
would be in America's best
interests to establish a detente
with Cuba. With a growing Soviet
influence in Cuba, soaring sugar
prices and increasing Cuban
agricultural and industrial
production, the Cuban quarantine
is self-defeating and useless.
Negotiation is certainly a
better policy than confrontation.
We don't need a hostile enemy on
our back porch.
