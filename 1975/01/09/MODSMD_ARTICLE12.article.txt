# Perhaps They Will Perish

### Clem Droz 
There was a time when cultural
diversity in the United States did
not mean deliberate divisiveness
and the glorification of terror, nor
did it call for the tyranny of
quota representation.
We who thought of ourselves as
citizens of the world had a low
opinion of anyone who put
nationality or religion above all
else, and we would have had the
same opinion regarding any
fist-clenching "power" seeker who
felt likewise about his or her race,
gender, generation or lifestyle in
order to resole some personal
"identity" problem.
Now, however, as a result of
the so-called revolutionary
movements that came out of the
19605, "the world's melting pot"
is turning to ancestor worship in
the form of a pluralistic society.
We are living in a country that
no longer even aspires to be a

melting pot in the finest sense,
and this at a time when the entire
world must become precisely that
a crucible that will* make a
civilized human being out of a
superpatriot, out of a religious
zealot, out of an ethnic
supremacist, out of a male or
female chauvinist, and so on.
Either we will become one
human race, and we will relegate
the past to its proper place, or
sooner or later the symbiotic
combat forces of the United
States and the Other members of
the nuclear terror society will be
running amok trying to "protect"
you, an innocent bystander on the
planet Earth, from your
"enemies." This paranoid,
well-armed, political clique could
be symbolized at this stage by a
cobra with six heads, each with
nuclear striking power.
These six sovereign members of

the proliferating club, dedicated
as they are to the liberation of
mankind, all have beautiful ideals,
but the way they are going about
trying to realize them, as a law
unto themselves, is sheer,
self-destructing madness. (They
don't want you to know or say
that, and you will be condemned
if you do.)
The best minds in the world
will not find away for these
powers to feed even their own
surplus mouths and still maintain
anti-planetary "national defense"
systems. Alas, the "third world"
wants to get into the act, too.
Perhaps our nuclear
"liberators" will all perish
together one day in a global
holocaust, because there was no
place to hide.
