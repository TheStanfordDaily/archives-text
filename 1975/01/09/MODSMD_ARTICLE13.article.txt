# ASSU Charter vs. CAB
## 
### Quinn Mayer 
The Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB), a five-member board
appointed by the President, is ,
currently attempting to eliminate
affinity group charter flights by .
the end of 1975.
An affinity group for purposes
of travel is defined by the CAB as
an educational, social, fraternal,
religious, labor, professional or
ethnic organization that was not
created for the purpose of travel.
These groups account for
approximately 70 percent of all
charter traffic. Affinity charters
are also the only type of flight
service available through the
ASSU Travel Service, and their
elimination would directly affect
the nearly 5000 clients currently
served by this office.
The CAB is not unaware of the
great public demand for affinity
charters or the fact that charter
traffic has tripled in the last five
years. In California alone,
200,000 passengers were able to
take advantage of this service
while incidentally contributing
$39 million to the state's
economy and employing 3500
individuals who work for the air
carriers.
New Option Proposed.
To replace the affinity group
charter option, the CAB proposes
a non-competitive pricing system
for "One-Stop Inclusive Tour
Charters." At a time when high
inflation and fuel costs have
already driven up fares
considerably, the minimum
charter price would only serve to
further aggravate the inflationary
spiral.
The CAB's move to fix prices
for charter services may add
"many millions of dollars to the
cost of air travel," charged Sen.'
Edward M. Kennedy (D- Mass.),
chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee's administrative
practices and procedures
subcommittee.
A Ralph Nader group in
Washington, the Aviation
Consumer Action Project,
contends that any such action
would be illegal because Congress
did not grant the Board authority
to set fares. The Justice
Department has concurred with
this opinion and is considering
legal action itself. In addition, the
Department's Anti-Trust division
is examining the claim that such
action might serve to eliminate
competition and thus may be in
violation of anti-trust laws.
Petitions Circulated
Petitions were circulated at the
end of last quarter to students
flying on ASSU charter flights,
and inquiries have been made with
the offices of Senators Alan
Cranston (D-Cal.) and John
Tunney (D-Cal.), along with Rep.
Paul McCloskey(R-Menlo Park).
The response has been virtually
unanimous in opposition to the
proposed suspension of travel
charter service. Apparently, it
may be having an effect on the
CAB, as the deadline for receipt
of comments and petitions on this
revision has been moved back to
the first week in February.
In light of the fact that the
International Student Fare was
dropped in August, 1973, the
International Youth Fare
eliminated a year ago and
domestic youth standby scrapped
in June of 1974, it will take no
small effort to stop the CAB's
increasing disregard for the needs
of America's young travelers.
If you wish to make your views
known on the CAB's proposal to
eliminate affinity group charter
flights, you must act now ! You
needn't say much, but be sure to
include comments about the need
for low-cost air travel for yourself
as a student traveler. The claim
that charter service is a form of
financial aid can also be
substantiated. Correspondence
should be addressed to: Civil
Aeronautics Board, Washington,
D.C. 20428, and the envelope
should be marked "Docket No.
24908," regarding the termination
of affinity charters, and Office of
the Consumer Advocate, Civil
Aeronautics Board, Washington,
D.C., 20428.
Your United States Senators
and Congress representatives will
also be interested in your
comments. Any other suggestions
or inquiries would be appreciated
by Bob Beach, manager of the
ASSU Travel Service or myself
at the ASSU Office.

subcommittee.
A Ralph Nader group in
Washington, the Aviation
Consumer Action Project,
contends that any such action
would be illegal because Congress
did not grant the Board authority
to set fares. The Justice
Department has concurred with
this opinion and is considering
legal action itself. In addition, the
Department's Anti-Trust division
is examining the claim that such
action might serve to eliminate
competition and thus may be in
violation of anti-trust laws.
Petitions Circulated
Petitions were circulated at the
end of last quarter to students
flying on ASSU charter flights,
and inquiries have been made with
the offices of Senators Alan
Cranston (D-Cal.) and John
Tunney (D-Cal.), along with Rep.
Paul McCloskey(R-Menlo Park).
The response has been virtually
unanimous in opposition to the
proposed suspension of travel
charter service. Apparently, it
may be having an effect on the
CAB, as the deadline for receipt
of comments and petitions on this
revision has been moved back to
the first week in February.
In light of the fact that the
International Student Fare was
dropped in August, 1973, the
International Youth Fare
eliminated a year ago and
domestic youth standby scrapped
in June of 1974, it will take no
small effort to stop the CAB's
increasing disregard for the needs
of America's young travelers.
If you wish to make your views
known on the CAB's proposal to
eliminate affinity group charter
flights, you must act now ! You
needn't say much, but be sure to
include comments about the need
for low-cost air travel for yourself
as a student traveler. The claim
that charter service is a form of
financial aid can also be
substantiated. Correspondence
should be addressed to: Civil
Aeronautics Board, Washington,
D.C. 20428, and the envelope
should be marked "Docket No.
24908," regarding the termination
of affinity charters, and Office of
the Consumer Advocate, Civil
Aeronautics Board, Washington,
D.C., 20428.
Your United States Senators
and Congress representatives will
also be interested in your
comments. Any other suggestions
or inquiries would be appreciated
by Bob Beach, manager of the
ASSU Travel Service or myself

The Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB), a five-member board
appointed by the President, is ,
currently attempting to eliminate
affinity group charter flights by .
the end of 1975.
An affinity group for purposes
of travel is defined by the CAB as
an educational, social, fraternal,
religious, labor, professional or
ethnic organization that was not
created for the purpose of travel.
These groups account for
approximately 70 percent of all
charter traffic. Affinity charters
are also the only type of flight
service available through the
ASSU Travel Service, and their
elimination would directly affect
the nearly 5000 clients currently
served by this office.
The CAB is not unaware of the
great public demand for affinity
charters or the fact that charter
traffic has tripled in the last five
years. In California alone,
200,000 passengers were able to
take advantage of this service
while incidentally contributing
$39 million to the state's
economy and employing 3500
individuals who work for the air
carriers.
New Option Proposed.
To replace the affinity group
charter option, the CAB proposes
a non-competitive pricing system
for "One-Stop Inclusive Tour
Charters." At a time when high
inflation and fuel costs have
already driven up fares
considerably, the minimum
charter price would only serve to
further aggravate the inflationary
spiral.
The CAB's move to fix prices
for charter services may add
"many millions of dollars to the
cost of air travel," charged Sen.'
Edward M. Kennedy (D- Mass.),
chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee's administrative
practices and procedures
