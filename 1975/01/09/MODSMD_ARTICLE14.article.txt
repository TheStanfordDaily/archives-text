## Parental Stress Hotline Combats Child Abuse The 						First Call: 20 Minutes Of Uncontrolled Anger 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
In a nondescript office building
behind an unmarked brown door, the
tiny office reverberates with the
p sounds of life and death.
It's the headquarters of Palo Alto's
parental stress hotline a grass roots
effort founded on shaky financial
support. But its phone lines are open
long enough to save lives.
"Of course you love your
, children," reads a hotline poster, "but
do you frequently 'lose control and
hate yourself afterwards?"
The hotline is billed as a vent for
steamed-up parents who are urged to
call 327-3333 when "the kids are
getting to you" or "when you think a
child is being abused or neglected."
► That's the clincher. Hotline
volunteers hear everything from
changing diapers through divorce and
violence, but they focus ultimately on
the child or children caught in the
middle.
When an adult has nowhere to turn
t with his problems, "kids have ended
up in the hospital, dead," says hotline
director Tracy Madden.
Children's Rights
Madden, 28, is a quiet advocate of
children's rights. She has provided
temporary foster homes to 12
* children. Her care helped them
readjust and return to their natural
parents.
People shouldn't be afraid to butt
in, she believes and that's the
philosophy behind the hotline.
"If you think you hear someone
* harming a child next door, you should
intervene. You don't have to say,
'You're beating your kid, you child
abuser.'

"But you can say tactfully that
perhaps the parent is having a hard
time with Johnny and ask, 'Can I take
him for a while and give you a rest?' "
Madden advises.
"The object is to have Johnny's
hand in yours when you walk back
down the street or hall," she says.
"And if you're afraid to go over you
should call someone even the

police."
The hotline, born over coffee and
conversations between Madden and
author Shirley Radl, is premised on
personal understanding of child abuse.
Radl has written Mother's Day is Over,
a treatise on the trials of child-rearing,
in which she admits that "sometimes I
hate my children."
Both Radl and Madden agree it's
normal to feel occasional hate for
loved ones.

"Every day," Madden says, "we get
calls from tearful young marrieds
steeped in pablum and an infant's
incessant wailing who say, 'But I don't
understand it. I thought babies were
supposed to be such a joy!' "
She attributes their frustrations to
"sick, cruddy TV values. Show me a
brother and sister who don't hit each
other every day and I'll show you.. ."
starts Madden, but she can't finish.
She's fuming.
With inspiration from similar
hotline operations, the Palo Alto stress
line was opened Sept. 15, 1973. One
week later the first "stress call" came
in.
"I had a premonition I'd get the
first call," Madden remembers. "And I
knew it would be an angry caller. It
was 20 minutes of uncontrolled anger.
It was beautiful. All I could do was
listen. When the caller had put it all
out there, we talked about it."
Varied Volunteers
About 40 lay counsellors take turns
manning the office's two phones from
9 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. The
volunteer hunched over a desk and
waiting to help with a crisis could be
male or female, aged 22 to 54,
married, single or divorced, a parent or
childless.
When there are no calls, they keep
busy by reading books. When the
phone rings they reveal only a first
name. The hotline keeps only a first
name file on clients and all
information is confidential.
The caller's voice may
tremble: "What sorts of things do
you talk about?"; or "You've got to

help me I almost killed my baby."
One caller began talking about his
wish to find his daughter's pet alligator
a new home. The listener learned later
in the call that the client was really
angry with an uncontrollable teenage
son.
A women called from a
phonebooth, after her drunken
husband had beaten her, fearful for
her children asleep at home. Would £he
baby's cries set her husband off again?
The woman cooled at the
counselor's suggestion that she call
police. The volunteer persuaded her to
reveal her location, met her at the
phone booth, calmed her and called
authorities.
Slashed Wrists
One voice asked plaintively if a
doctor could be found who "won't
send me away." It belonged to a
young woman alone in a large
apartment with one small baby and a
husband at work. Mad with inactivity,
she'd nicked up her wrists with a
carving knife in a trance. The blood
had coagulated, but the volunteer on
duty got the woman's address and
drove her to the hospital.
Another caller feared she might
turn a revolver kept loaded in a bureau
drawer on herself and her child. She
reluctantly told a hotline volunteer her
name and phone number.

For three weeks, the volunteer who
first talked to hpr "held the woman's
hand by telephone," Madden reveals.
When the volunteer made a call at
an appointed time, the client said,
"I'm so glad you called. I just knew
you would. Waiting for your call was
the only thing that kept me from
hurting anyone, that kept me hanging
on."
Volunteers learn that phrasing and
tone often tell more than the caller's
words. A client may tell of a
"neighbor's" problem f and really be
talking about his or her own anxiety.
"My parents' help?" questions a
caller. "They're thousands of miles

away. They wouldn't care anyway."
According to Madden, this kind of
caller resents his or her own
upbringing and the isolationism of
modern transient society.
When there's feces all over the
floor, maggots in three-week-old food
and diapers stopping up the toilet,
police will take a child out of the
home and place it in a shelter, pending
court action, says Palo Alto policeman
William Butler.
But threats unsubstantiated by
proof of physical harm leave the
hotline and police powerless to
extricate a potential victim.
However, laws don't shackle hotline
efforts. "If a mother screams to me
over the phone at midnight, 'Get this
kid out of my sight before I kill him,'
I'm going to get that kid out of her
sight before she kills him," Madden
states.
The hotline's organization is casual,
a loosely organized non-profit
corporation. Distant future plans
include a drop-in center for parents
and children.
Encouragement
Volunteers handle decisions
democratically at monthly meetings.
They pool tips on how to handle
certain kinds of callers and offer
encouragement if a volunteer feels he's
let a client down.
It is estimated that 100,000 to one
million child abuse cases occur
nationally every year but no one
may ever know the exact figure.
Incidents occur at all socio-economic
levels.
Stanford's police department has
handled three incidents in the past
three years but Menlo Park and Palo
Alto police report 10-15 annually.
"That's average for a community our
size," says Menlo Park policeman
Charles Aubuchon.
He adds, "There are a lot of times
we never hear about."
The exchange receives about 30
stress calls per week, 75 percent from
women. A few come from concerned
neighbors and bystanders or from
teenagers upset with their parents.
Official Help
When volunteers encounter highly
charged situations involving violence,
they turn to the protective services
agencies in San Mateo and Santa Clara
counties, juvenile probation
departments and the police. San Jose
has a team of officers especially
equipped to quiet family feuds which

rank as the most frightening of police
encounters, Madden notes.
Relatively few crises the hotline
handles carry an immediate threat of
death. In emergencies,, volunteers
provide day care or babysitting.
Madden says calling the hotline
isn't the same as being a childbeater.
Even if a client has harmed a child, the
hotline aims for relief, not retribution.
Madden points out that abusing a
youngster implies something about the
offender's self he or she hates very
much.
Like Madden, most volunteers view
abuse as a symptom of unhappiness
that can be identified and dealt with.

Seasonal training sessions for new
.'ides often reach encounter session
dimensions during telephone
roleplaying. Some acting becomes real
when volunteers, in the parts of
callers, use material from their own
pasts, times when they've resented
their children, neglected them,
whipped them.
"You feel like you're just a terrible
person," says Madden, "but when it's
all over, you find everybody loves you
just as much as before if not more."
"We may not always condone what
our callers do," she says meditatively,
"but we almost always like them as
people. They're hurting, they're
needing and they're trying."

ON THE LlNE—Parental stress hotline director' Tracy Madden champions
children's rights by listening and advising. One client who feared she might turn
a loaded revolver kept in a bureau drawer on herself and her child was calmed by
a pre-arranged call from a volunteer. "It was the only thin£ that kept me hanging
on," the client said.
