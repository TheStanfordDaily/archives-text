# Mavis: Energy Plentiful, But Costly
## 
### DAN PYNE 
The University energy crisis has
not gone away, Plant Services
Director Jason Mavis warned
Wednesday, but it has changed a
little.
"What we face now is not so
much a shortage of energy but
continual price increases for
natural gas and electricity," he
said. "There is no cheap energy
any more."
In November the University
reduced natural gas consumption
by 16 percent and electricity use
by 12 percent over last year, yet
overall expenses rose $15,000.
Last month, although natural
gas use was cut 11 percent over
December 1973, and electrical
consumption dropped 8 percent,
Stanford's total energy bill was up
$lB,OOO.
Worst To Gome
And Mavis indicated the worst
is yet to come. "Our rates went
up on Jan. I an average of 23
percent for natural gas and 8.7
percent for electricity.
"We've been lucky so far,
because the long range weather
forcast was way off. November
and December were much dryer
and warmer than anticipated. So

even with the rate increases we've
been able to hold down our
costs," he said.
Mavis said plant services
continues to look for ways to cut
down energy waste, but admitted
that the job is getting more
difficult.
Cooperation
"Generally, we've had just
tremendous co-operation on
campus," Mavis said.
"Much of the December
savings resulted from, the housing
shutdown and the co-operation of
the food service and housing
people. Co-operation is needed
more than ever now that the basic
rates have risen sp sharply [and
the major energy leaks
eliminated!he said.
"Last year's program was the
original 'brute force' effort. We
cut back wherever we could, and
the effort was 'unrefined' because
it took only the quickly effective
measures," Mavis explained.
Subtle Savings
"But now that the pure wastes
have been eliminated, the job of
saving energy becomes more
subtle. We do a lot of thinking for
a lot less significant cuts."
Mavis added that one of the

major problems now is that many
of the University buildings are old
and energy-inefficient built "in
the days when everyone thought
natural gas was every man's
God-given right."
He said each campus building is
being analyzed to see that it is
heated in the most efficient
manner. The fountains are on
timed circuits now, underground
steam pipes are being insulated,
anc a computer is being used to
coordinate much of the campus
heating.
Storage Tanks
Mavis also mentioned that the
fuel oil storage tanks on campus
are almost completed.

Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) indicated earlier this year
that it may interrupt natural gas
service up to 21 days this year.
The University burns fuel oil
when service is halted, and the
new tanks insure that the campus
will have enough oil on reserve to
carry over those 21 days.
Service has only been
interrupted one day, Nov. 12,
during this current school year.
At that time, Mavis said the
University had 500,000 gallons of
reserve fuel oil which would easily
cover such short range cut-offs.
The new tanks are necessary,
however, to guard against gas
service interruptions lasting more
than a few days, he said.

coming to campus now that the University has begun enforcing its ordinance preventing vendors from
driving in the White Plaza area. Kurtz said he would not be able to transport all of his goods to White
Plaza if he had to carry them from the nearest parking lot. ♦

been able to hold down our
costs," he said.
Mavis said plant services
continues to look for ways to cut
down energy waste, but admitted
that the job is getting more
difficult.
Cooperation
"Generally, we've had just
tremendous co-operation on
campus," Mavis said.
"Much of the December
savings resulted from, the housing
shutdown and the co-operation of
the food service and housing
people. Co-operation is needed
more than ever now that the basic
rates have risen sp sharply [and
the major energy leaks
eliminated!he said.
"Last year's program was the
original 'brute force' effort. We
cut back wherever we could, and
the effort was 'unrefined' because
it took only the quickly effective
measures," Mavis explained.
Subtle Savings
"But now that the pure wastes
have been eliminated, the job of
saving energy becomes more
subtle. We do a lot of thinking for
a lot less significant cuts."
Mavis added that one of the

major problems now is that many
of the University buildings are old
and energy-inefficient built "in
the days when everyone thought
natural gas was every man's
God-given right."
He said each campus building is
being analyzed to see that it is
heated in the most efficient
manner. The fountains are on
timed circuits now, underground
steam pipes are being insulated,
anc a computer is being used to
coordinate much of the campus
heating.
Storage Tanks
Mavis also mentioned that the
fuel oil storage tanks on campus
are almost completed.

Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) indicated earlier this year
that it may interrupt natural gas
service up to 21 days this year.
The University burns fuel oil
when service is halted, and the
new tanks insure that the campus
will have enough oil on reserve to
carry over those 21 days.
Service has only been
interrupted one day, Nov. 12,
during this current school year.
At that time, Mavis said the
University had 500,000 gallons of
reserve fuel oil which would easily
cover such short range cut-offs.
The new tanks are necessary,
however, to guard against gas
service interruptions lasting more
than a few days, he said.

BLOWN OUT Les Kurtz, the glass-blower who set up shop in White Plaza for over a year, has stopped
coming to campus now that the University has begun enforcing its ordinance preventing vendors from
driving in the White Plaza area. Kurtz said he would not be able to transport all of his goods to White
Plaza if he had to carry them from the nearest parking lot. ♦

The University energy crisis has
not gone away, Plant Services
Director Jason Mavis warned
Wednesday, but it has changed a
little.
"What we face now is not so
much a shortage of energy but
continual price increases for
natural gas and electricity," he
said. "There is no cheap energy
any more."
In November the University
reduced natural gas consumption
by 16 percent and electricity use
by 12 percent over last year, yet
overall expenses rose $15,000.
Last month, although natural
gas use was cut 11 percent over
December 1973, and electrical
consumption dropped 8 percent,
Stanford's total energy bill was up
$lB,OOO.
Worst To Gome
And Mavis indicated the worst
is yet to come. "Our rates went
up on Jan. I an average of 23
percent for natural gas and 8.7
percent for electricity.
"We've been lucky so far,
because the long range weather
forcast was way off. November
and December were much dryer
and warmer than anticipated. So

even with the rate increases we've
been able to hold down our
costs," he said.
