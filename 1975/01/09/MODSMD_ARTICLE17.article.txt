# Law Discourages Plaza Vendors
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Campus police have begun to
enforce an ordinance preventing
White Plaza vendors from driving
onto the plaza to deposit their
wares. Although this has caused
minor attrition of the vendors and
major inconvenience, the
craftspeople seem to accept the
provision.
According to Police Services
Director Marvin Herrington, the
vendors were warned "from time

to time" in the past against
driving on the plaza.
As a result of complaints filed
with then-ombudsman Harvey
Hall last spring, Herrington said,
"In the fall we decided to warn
them on a regular basis. My men
say most are complying," he
added.
Herrington emphasized
potential danger to pedestrians
and bicyclists as the major
concern of the police department.
"That is not a roadway," he said.
"It wasn't set up for traffic."
The vendors recognize the need
for safety, adding however that
the ordinance has made selling
"very hard. Especially yesterday
when it was raining," added one
craftsman.

Another explained that he now
must make many trips from the
parking lot to the plaza "which
has made it hard on me. I only
come three days a week now
instead of five because it's too
much trouble . . . The glass man
stopped coming altogether."
This vendor was quick to add,
"I like working here. I don't want
to raise a fuss."
The man at the stand next to
his agreed that "The law is the
law. We appreciate being here."
He suggested as did a woman
selling earrings, that the vendors
be allotted a specific, brief time
before classes begin and after they
end to load and unload their
goods.
