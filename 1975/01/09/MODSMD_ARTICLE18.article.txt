# Early Sales Dim ‘Quad’ Optimism
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
With a Jan. 15 sales deadline
quickly approaching for the Quad,
some of the staff's early fall
quarter optimism has not calmed
down to more realistic
expectations for this year.
So far, 1100 yearbooks have
been sold. "With that, we'll just
break even," editor Rick Everist
said.
Last year, in the Quad's first
appearance in three years, 1200
books had been sold by Jan. 15.
Eight hundred additional books
were ordered, and they were all
eventually sold. However, the
1974 Quad proved to be a
disappointment to most students.
"I think a lot of people are
wondering if this year's book will
be as bad as last year's," Everist
explained. "But from what I've
seen of it so far, I'd have to say it
is a 150 percent improvement
over last year."
Thirty-five percent of the
Quad's pages are finished and at
the publisher's.
"It's still a traditional type
yearbook," Everist said. "But you
really can't compare it to past
books. We will be a little different
less emphasis on frats and

football and more on other
aspects of university life.
"We're even putting in a grad
student section this year. It'll be
about 20 pages covering several
different departments."
Professional senior portraits
will also appear this year. (Last
year's senior section contained
only 1.D.-type pictures.)
Currently, 800 seniors have had
their pictures taken, out of a class
of 15000. Everist said he expects
maybe 50 more to have their
pictures taken.
Advertising sales are off this
year, causing budget cutbacks.
"We're not getting near as jnany
ads as we thought." Everist said.
"Live Oak has really cut into our
advertising."
The Quad staff is considerably
smaller than past volumes; only
28 are working on this year's
book.
"We have a real problem with
staff continuity," Everist said.
"And that's really too bad. Many
of the problems and mistakes with
the '74 book were due to an
inexperienced staff. Probably our
best recruitment for next year will
be to turn out a really good
yearbook this year.

"I think a lot of people are
wondering if this year's book will
be as bad as last year's," Everist
explained. "But from what I've
seen of it so far, I'd have to say it
is a 150 percent improvement
over last year."
Thirty-five percent of the
Quad's pages are finished and at
the publisher's.
"It's still a traditional type
yearbook," Everist said. "But you
really can't compare it to past
books. We will be a little different
less emphasis on frats and

football and more on other
aspects of university life.
"We're even putting in a grad
student section this year. It'll be
about 20 pages covering several
different departments."
Professional senior portraits
will also appear this year. (Last
year's senior section contained
only 1.D.-type pictures.)
Currently, 800 seniors have had
their pictures taken, out of a class
of 15000. Everist said he expects
maybe 50 more to have their
pictures taken.
Advertising sales are off this
year, causing budget cutbacks.
"We're not getting near as jnany
ads as we thought." Everist said.
"Live Oak has really cut into our
advertising."
The Quad staff is considerably
smaller than past volumes; only
28 are working on this year's
book.
"We have a real problem with
staff continuity," Everist said.
"And that's really too bad. Many
of the problems and mistakes with
the '74 book were due to an
inexperienced staff. Probably our
best recruitment for next year will
be to turn out a really good
yearbook this year.
