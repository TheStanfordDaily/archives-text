## The 						Reel World Front Page, Lenny Deserve Acclaim 
### George Powell 
The Front Page and Lenny are two of the holiday season's more
ballyhooed releases, and for good reason. They both are well put
together examples of two different genres of the film craft. But both
also exhibit flaws that make both less than totally satisfying
experiences.
First, though, here's what's good about both of them. The Front
Page, as interpreted by director Billy Wilder from the well-known play
by Ben Hecht and Charles Mac Arthur, rushes through the zany antics
of Chicago newsmen covering the hanging of a "radical" inT929 with
all the rapidity of a gigantic press operating at full speed.
The laugh lines are spewed out faster than a press run of special
editions, aided by a top-notch cast that milks each scene for every last
drop of snappy patter. The roles of reporter Hildy Johnson and
managing editor Walter Burns are handled by Jack Lemmon and
Walter Matthau respectively in this third film incarnation of the play..
It's also the pair's third film together (others were The Fortune
Cookie and The Odd Couple) so their comedic talents are finely 4
honed if somewhat predictable. Lemmon as the loveable bon-vivant
who effortlessly can get on top of any story, and Matthau as his
managing editor„urging him on ever greater scoops and more flowery
prose. Reporters whose job it is to bring readers the news of death and
destruction never had it so good, and making the mayor of Chicago
look foolish and corrupt was never easier.
Lenny A Harbinger
Lenny Bruce was also a bringer of bad news to a large audience,
but all he got for his monologues about the painful side of American
life and mores was arrests, court fights and the media label of "sick
comedian."
There was some sick, self-destructive impulse in Bruce, but the
movie Lenny concentrates instead on his martyrdom in the cause of
free expression.
The film is artfully put together by director Bob Fosse', and
evocatively photographed by Bruce Surtees in black and white. What
really makes the film, though, is Dustin Hoffman's success in
recreating at least a facet of the person that was Lenny Bruce.
The role of Bruce's wife, Honey, is no less artfully portrayed by
Valerie Perrine.. Honey is overwhelmed by Lenny's insistent demands
to experience everything while constantly being reassured of her
loyalty to him. At least, that's the way it comes out in the movie.
Hoffman's Bruce becomes obsessed with his court cases after a
series of arrests for "obscenity," starting in San Francisco for
mentioning "cocksuckin" in his act. So Bruce begins to devote his
entire performances to reading from the trial transcripts, driving
people away who come to be entertained and titillated.
No actor handles obsessive behav.ior better than Hoffman, and the
scenes with Bruce raging at his lawyers, his judges and lecturing his
audience are riveting and real enough to make one uncomfortable,
even if it's not the way the real Bruce may have reacted.
Sharp Format
Fosse wraps up the whole package in a razzle-dazzle format, with
three narrative threads all merging at the film's end. The first is the
linear story of Bruce's rise and fall, the second is a long monologue by
Bruce that is in reality a combination of many of his best bits, and the
third is reminiscences in documentary fashion by the actors who play
his family and friends.
It's all interesting, but the structure raises more questions than it
answers, and superficially glosses over many facets of Bruce's
personality in order to as the publicity material for the film says
show "... that he was a genius who was way ahead of his time and
was ultimately destroyed by his reactionary opponents."
Bruce's involvement with drugs and his attitudes just before his
death in 1966 may have had something to do with his destruction,
too, and these factors are glossed oyer in the movie, as is his eventual
split with Honey.
Couldn't Keep Up
Honey, it seems, was just not "hip" enough to keep up with Bruce,
although he and certain unspecified drugs lured her into lesbianism.
"Drugs make you do things you normally wouldn't think of doing,"

she says at one point, and the movie seems to verify that contention.
One minute Bruce is muttering in Honey's ear, and the next minute
she's caressing a naked female, while Bruce watched avidly. It's a
rather superficial handling of some complex factor's in Bruce's life.
Essentially, excessive simplification of many complex factors
makes Lenny a lesser movie. Director Fosse, who won an Emmy,
Oscar and Tony award in 1973, took the theory of Bruce as martyr to
a cause too seriously and produced an arresting piece of propaganda
that is no more a real account of Lenny Bruce's career than Years of
Lightening, Day of Drums was of John Kennedy's presidency.
Too Serious
Over-serious interpretation is also the rut in the otherwise simply
road The Front Page travels. The culprit is Carol Burnett, a
comedienne of note who portrays Mollie Malloy, the proverbial whore
with the heart of gold.
She brings such a seriousness of purpose with her every time she
appears on the screen that it's like a big, seriously wet blanket. Molly
talks, or rather stridently lectures about big issues, such as newsmen's
ethics, free press and fair trial and media stereotypes. Her milk of
human kindness curdles the genial cynicism that pervades the film,
leaving viewers wondering why she's playing her role so straight. In
the hyped-up hurly burly, that question is left unanswered at The
Front Page's end.
Overseriousness doesn't spoil both films, though. It only makes
them less rewarding, as toast with imitation margarine tastes opposed
to toast with butter.
"The Front Page," rated PG, is currently playing at the Aquarius lin
Palo Alto. "Lenny," rated R, is showing at the Regency I in San
Francisco.

IT'S ALL MINE AND IT'S REAL—Valerie Perrine appears to be
happy, perhaps in anticipation of an Oscar nomination which many
reviews have said she deserved for her portrayal in Lenny , Perrine
portrayed Lenny Bruce's wife in the motion picture history of Bruce's
life.
