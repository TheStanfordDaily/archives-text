# Aims For Cohesive Course Program
## New Panel To Study Curriculum 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Halsey Royden
appointed a ten-member committee to study
how to provide a sound and compelling curriculum
of undergraduate liberal studies under conditions of
sever? financial constraint."
The new Committee on Reform and Renewal of
Liberal Education at Stanford will also consider
"the planning of a larger number of carefully
designed sequential courses rather than numerous
courses which currently satisfy general
requirements for graduation."
Royden yesterday criticized the current "menu
system of choices facing undergraduates who have
no real guidance" in designing a liberal education
program other than that which they receive from
their advisers.
# He also expressed concern over the increased
emphasis upon pre-professionalism in undergraduate
course selection, at the expense of a liberal
education program, under the current system.
'No Results Yet'
The new committee will also investigate
developments in undergraduate education since the
of the Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) in 1969, according to several members.
However, Religious Studies Prof. Lee Yearley, t£e
committee's chairman, cautioned that "we don't
have results yet; we have questions."
The faculty-student-Administration committee,
which conducted the 1969 study, devoted one
to undergraduate education and nine to
other topics.
The study revealed that undergraduates wanted
more freedom in selecting their courses, and this
finding led to the adoption of the present
distribution requirement system of two courses in
each of three broad areas of study.
The intention of the 1969 committee was that
#"the distribution requirement should be kept to the
absolute minimum necessary to prevent educational
lopsidedness," and generally favored more latitude
for undergraduates in selecting their courses.

When interviewed last autumn, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs said that the
SES "dismantled a curriculum but did not propose a
new one in its place." Gibbs is a member of the new
committee.
Other committee members expressed similar
sentiments.
Assistant Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Atkinson, who was active in the early
planning of the new committee, said yesterday that
part of his concern had been sparked by contacts

with students who had been out a few years and
who were unhappy about their undergraduate
education at Stanford."
Humanities Prof. Lawrence Ryan yesterday
described the "fragmentation of our undergraduate
offerings into little bits and pieces." At the same
time, he pointed out that there is a lack of money
for academic experimentation in trying to correct
this.
Roy den also said this is a major concern, and his

channels" for instituting curriculum changes. He
said that any proposals of the new committee,
expected to operate for six to nine months, would
go to the Committee on Undergraduate Studies and
the Academic Senate for evaluation.
Of the 15 members of the new committee, only
one Engineering Professor James Gibbons was a
member of the SES steering committee of five years
ago.

appointed a ten-member committee to study
how to provide a sound and compelling curriculum
of undergraduate liberal studies under conditions of
sever? financial constraint."
The new Committee on Reform and Renewal of
Liberal Education at Stanford will also consider
"the planning of a larger number of carefully
designed sequential courses rather than numerous
courses which currently satisfy general
requirements for graduation."
Royden yesterday criticized the current "menu
system of choices facing undergraduates who have
no real guidance" in designing a liberal education
program other than that which they receive from
their advisers.
# He also expressed concern over the increased
emphasis upon pre-professionalism in undergraduate
course selection, at the expense of a liberal
education program, under the current system.
'No Results Yet'
The new committee will also investigate
developments in undergraduate education since the
of the Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) in 1969, according to several members.
However, Religious Studies Prof. Lee Yearley, t£e
committee's chairman, cautioned that "we don't
have results yet; we have questions."
The faculty-student-Administration committee,
which conducted the 1969 study, devoted one
to undergraduate education and nine to
other topics.
The study revealed that undergraduates wanted
more freedom in selecting their courses, and this
finding led to the adoption of the present
distribution requirement system of two courses in
each of three broad areas of study.
The intention of the 1969 committee was that
#"the distribution requirement should be kept to the
absolute minimum necessary to prevent educational
lopsidedness," and generally favored more latitude
for undergraduates in selecting their courses.

When interviewed last autumn, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs said that the
SES "dismantled a curriculum but did not propose a
new one in its place." Gibbs is a member of the new
committee.
Other committee members expressed similar
sentiments.
Assistant Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Atkinson, who was active in the early
planning of the new committee, said yesterday that
part of his concern had been sparked by contacts

with students who had been out a few years and
who were unhappy about their undergraduate
education at Stanford."
Humanities Prof. Lawrence Ryan yesterday
described the "fragmentation of our undergraduate
offerings into little bits and pieces." At the same
time, he pointed out that there is a lack of money
for academic experimentation in trying to correct
this.
Roy den also said this is a major concern, and his
