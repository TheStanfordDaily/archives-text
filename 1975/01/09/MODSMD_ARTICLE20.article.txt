## Davis Brings Style To S.F. 
### Dave Smith 
A visit by Miles Davis is always
among the highlights of San
Francisco's musical year, for
throughout his 25-year career as a
bandleader there has been no
more consistently exciting and
influential jazz musician than
Miles. He will bring his eight-man
electric band to the Keystone
Korner in the City next Tuesday
for a five-day stay.
Jazz has few instantly
recognizable solo voices, but
Miles' electrified, wah-wah
pedaled trumpet is perhaps the
most distinctive of all. After five
years of experimenting with
electric music, Miles is capable of
coaxing some amazing sounds
from his horn.
Miles' current band may not be
one of his all-time best, but it
illustrates his uncanny ability to
choose the right players for his
music. The exceptional number of
creative musicians who have
emerged from his bands, from
John Coltrane to Keith Jarret and
Herbie Hancock, pays tribute to
Miles' ability as a judge of
exceptional talent.
Sonny Fortune, on soprano
and alto saxes and flute, is among
the stars of the 1975 Miles Davis
group: his soaring flute provides
the most lyrical moments of the
music, and his work on electric
alto sax is particularly
outstanding.
Other Gems
Mtume, the virtuoso African
percussionist, and three guitarists
led by the teenage Bahian
Dominique Gaumont, also sparkle
in the band, but Miles is always
the premier attraction.
Miles' appearance here
coincides with the release of his
new album, Get Up With It
(Columbia KG 33236), dedicated
to the late. Duke Ellington. As
well as anything could, it
illustrates the successes and
pitfalls of Miles' current style.
Like many of his recent

albums, Get Up is something of a
hodgepodge, encompassing one
track from 1971 and two by the
group that appeared on the In
Concert 1972 recording. Four
other numbers are more recent;
two of these are over 30 minutes
long.
Success In Length
These two long numbers are by
far the most successful examples
of Miles' masterful ability to build
rhythmically fascinating
compositions around his electric
trumpet figures.
"Calypso Frelimo" begins
alluringly with a dark tangle of
rhythms and a simple "calypso"
organ figure. Miles' trumpet darts
through the tangle and the organ
phrase reappears several times,
creating an exotic feeling
enhanced by Mtume's congas and
A1 Foster's symbals.
Dave Liebman's primitive,
breathy flute and John
Stubblefield's wailing soprano sax
continue the feeling, and then,
after a perfectly-placed rest, bass
player Mike Henderson takes up a
thunderous, murky line that is
joined later by the guitars of Pete
Cosey and Reggie Lucas. Miles
builds two solos over the
sweltering guitar-and-bass riffs:
the first riding smoothly over the
waves of percussion, the second
climbing and whirling with them.
The other long number, "He

Loved Him Madly," is a
Spanish-flavored dirge that
features some excellent snare
playing by drummer Foster to
create a somber opening mood.
Liebman's echoing flute states the
first theme, aided by Gaumont,
Cosey and Lucas on guitars.
Miles' solo on this track is an
example of his mastery of
electronics: echo and wah-wah
devices are used to create a
beautifully subdued, mournful
statement.
Of the other tracks, "Red
China Blues" is the most
interesting. Miles' screaming
trumpet over a harmonica and
horn section transforms the
ordinary blues into an
exceptional, personal number.
Miles' organ playing, effective
on the two long numbers, is
unpleasant and grating on "Rated
X," and some of the other cuts
are aggravatingly dull, showing no
inventiveness at all, merely
competent background music.
"Mtume," with Cosey's sputtering
fuzz-guitar sounds, is almost
incomprehensible.
For all his failures, however,
Miles is a superbly creative
musician, obviously a man deeply
concerned with his music. Even at
his worst, he is an enormously
charismatic performer whose
unpredictability is one of his most
fascinating aspects.
