# Marshall Tucker Provides Relief
## 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
SAN FRANCISCO—One might
summarize Bill Graham's
presentation of foot-stompin'
country western music last month
with the tried but true adage
"Too Much of a Good Thing:"
too many bands from the South,
too many songs about women and
whiskey, too much of the same
boogie music.
By the time Charlie Daniels
and Little Feat finished their sets,
The Marshall Tucker Band
provided a welcome change of
pace featuring the unique
resources of Doug Gray's strong,
clear vocals, tight harmony and
innovative sax, flute and guitar
solos highlighting their songs.

Marshall Tucker's material is
written by Toy Caldwell, a
cowboy whose lightning-quick
fingers pick out awe-inspiring
guitar leads some fast and sharp
as on "Hillbilly Band" and
"Ramblin' " others quiet and
wandering as in "Take the
Highway" and "Can't You See."
Toy is intriguing to watch: he
stands quietly except for an
occasional grimace when he hits
an outstanding note, his eyes
always focused intently on his
agile hands. Hi§ behavior typifies
group performance as a whole:
The Marshall Tucker Band plays
novel yet solid country western
tunes without being flashy or
imitative.
A new selection entitled "24
Hours Anytime" featured Jerry
Eubanks on sax closely following
Toy's pulsating riffs and a
reverberating bass solo by Tom
Caldwell.
Tennessean Charlie Daniels

plays the fiddle and lead guitar
and looks much like Santa Claus
in a cowboy hat. His act is fairly
unimaginative, the sameness
broken occasionally by dueling
lead guitars and split-second
tempo changes as in "Ain't No
Place Left To Go." The set wound
up with three run-of-the-mill
tunes dominated by Daniel's
fiddling.
Little Feat's best numbers
were predominately country
western style, the most notable
being "Willin' ", written by lead
singer Lowell George.
George has a deep, gravelly
voice, and both he and bass player
Roy Estrada formerly performed
with The Mothers of Invention.
Little Feat's Bill King, using
multi-level keyboards, provided
shining background and solo
accompaniment. Their vocal
harmony needs some work, and as
a result some of their set sounded
a little flat.

Perrine), to a nightclub audience early in his career. Both Hoffman and Perrine have garnered tremendous
praise for their portrayals in the film, Lenny. The film traces comedian Bruce's career from his start to his
untimely death.

guitar leads some fast and sharp
as on "Hillbilly Band" and
"Ramblin' " others quiet and
wandering as in "Take the
Highway" and "Can't You See."
Toy is intriguing to watch: he
stands quietly except for an
occasional grimace when he hits
an outstanding note, his eyes
always focused intently on his
agile hands. Hi§ behavior typifies
group performance as a whole:
The Marshall Tucker Band plays
novel yet solid country western
tunes without being flashy or
imitative.
A new selection entitled "24
Hours Anytime" featured Jerry
Eubanks on sax closely following
Toy's pulsating riffs and a
reverberating bass solo by Tom
Caldwell.
Tennessean Charlie Daniels

plays the fiddle and lead guitar
and looks much like Santa Claus
in a cowboy hat. His act is fairly
unimaginative, the sameness
broken occasionally by dueling
lead guitars and split-second
tempo changes as in "Ain't No
Place Left To Go." The set wound
up with three run-of-the-mill
tunes dominated by Daniel's
fiddling.
Little Feat's best numbers
were predominately country
western style, the most notable
being "Willin' ", written by lead
singer Lowell George.
George has a deep, gravelly
voice, and both he and bass player
Roy Estrada formerly performed
with The Mothers of Invention.
Little Feat's Bill King, using
multi-level keyboards, provided
shining background and solo
accompaniment. Their vocal
harmony needs some work, and as
a result some of their set sounded
a little flat.

WINNER BY A KNOCKOUT—Lenny Bruce (Dustin Hoffman) introduces his wife, Honey (Valerie
Perrine), to a nightclub audience early in his career. Both Hoffman and Perrine have garnered tremendous
praise for their portrayals in the film, Lenny. The film traces comedian Bruce's career from his start to his
untimely death.
SAN FRANCISCO—One might
summarize Bill Graham's
presentation of foot-stompin'
country western music last month
with the tried but true adage
"Too Much of a Good Thing:"
too many bands from the South,
too many songs about women and
whiskey, too much of the same
boogie music.
By the time Charlie Daniels
and Little Feat finished their sets,
The Marshall Tucker Band
provided a welcome change of
pace featuring the unique
resources of Doug Gray's strong,
clear vocals, tight harmony and
innovative sax, flute and guitar
solos highlighting their songs.

Marshall Tucker's material is
written by Toy Caldwell, a
cowboy whose lightning-quick
fingers pick out awe-inspiring
guitar leads some fast and sharp
as on "Hillbilly Band" and
"Ramblin' " others quiet and
wandering as in "Take the
Highway" and "Can't You See."
