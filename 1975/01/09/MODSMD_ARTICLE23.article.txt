Ford Vows Toujih Economic Plan
WASHINGTON President Ford promised a
tough, confidence-restoring economic program
yesterday, but his chief economic adviser suggested
Americans may get no major relief from high
unemployment until 1976.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen quoted
Ford as telling a morning Cabinet meeting: "Ours is
a good program. It is tough. It is fully defendable. It
will give us the restoration of confidence that is
essential for recovery."
Ford will unveil his blueprint in his State of the
Union Address to the new Congress, possibly next
week.
But Nessen quoted chairman Alan Greenspan of
the Council of Economic Advisers as telling the
Cabinet, "We expect to see unemployment coming
down in 1976."
Nessen said, however, that Greenspan did not
forecast that the jobless rate, now topping seven
percent of the work force, would continue its recent
sharp upsurge throughout the current year. He
indicated that Greenspan expects unemployment
will begin flattening out this year, before declining
in 1976.
Greenspan's rather gloomy assessment of job
outlook came as the Labor Department reported
new claims for unemployment insurance benefits hit
a record 813,600 in the week ended Dec. 28.
It was the highest one-week total recorded since
the unemployment compensation program began in
1937, during the last years of the Great Depression.
FIA Screened Citizens" Mail?
LA JOLLA, Calif. A former research specialist
for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said
yesterday that the CIA and FBI screened the mail of
American citizens who wrote letters to persons in
Soviet-bloc nations with full cooperation from
the U.S. Postal Service.
Melvin Crain, 53, now a political science
instructor at San Diego State University, said that
the three agencies began in 1958 to monitor the
mail of U.S. citizens from post offices in New York
and New Orleans.

"Using sophisticated technology, we could open,
reproduce the mail and send it on its way without
interrupting the flow of mail and without being
detected in any way," said Dr. Crain from his home
here.
"What we were doing, in effect, was keeping
dossiers on U.S. citizens.
"The officer who briefed us admitted that it was
unconstitutional, illegal and a violation of the
agency charter, hut said it was necessary to carry
out our mission and in the interest of the country to
do so."
Crain said he still has a copy of one of the
intercepted letters to support his claims.
Meanwhile in Washington, the chairman of a
House subcommittee investigating the CIA asked
Time magazine and The New York Times yesterday
for the names of persons who might be willing to
testify about alleged domestic surveillance by the
intelligence agency.
Chairman Lucien N. Nedzi (D- Mich.) of the
special subcommittee on intelligence sent similar
telegrams to Hedley Donovan, editor-in-chief of
Time , and A.M. Rosenthal, managing editor of The
Times, saying he planned to schedule hearings soon
after Congress reassembles next week.
Vietnamese Bomb Loe Ninh
SAIGON South Vietnam sent waves of
U.S.-supplied fighter-bombers against Viet Cong
headquarters and Communist positions north of
Saigon yesterday and the Viet Cong claimed heavy
civilian casualties.
In Cambodia, field reports said government
forces retook a strategic hill outside Phnom Penh
and the Cambodian command said 16 Buddhist
nuns were found in a nearby pagoda raped and
murdered by Khmer Rouge troops.
The South Vietnamese planes hit the Viet Cong
headquarters compound at Loc Ninh and the newly
captured provincial capital of Phuoc Binh City, the
Saigon command reported. A spokesman said the
strikes set off explosions that sent smoke curling
more than 3000 feet into the air.
Associated Press newsmen watched waves of
supersonic F5 fighter-bombers supplied by the
United States take off from the Bien Hoa air base,
15 miles northeast of Saigon, to attack what the
command described as North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong troop concentrations, antiaircraft gun sites
and supply and ammunition depots along the
Cambodian border.
South Boston School Reopens
BOSTON Students returned to school in South
Boston for the first time in four weeks yesterday as
more than 400 policemen kept watch on the arrival
and departure of bused students.
No trouble was reported as classes resumed in the
four school buildings which had been the focal
point of racial violence since a school integration
plan took effect last September.
Officials said class attendance was low.
After school had closed for the day, U.S. District
Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. said three
members of the Boston School Committee have
purged themselves of contempt of court when they
voted Tuesday to draw up a new city-wide
integration plan which would avoid forced busing.

But he said they must submit the proposal by
Jan. 20, commenting that the chances of such a plan
working "are remote in the extreme."
Last month, Garrity found John J. Kerrigan,
John J. McDonough, the new chairman, and Paul
Ellison in contempt for failing to meet a deadline
for submitting a new integration plan.
If they had not purged themselves of contempt,
Garrity said they would have been deprived of their
council votes on integration and would have to pay
daily fines.
Ford To Reveal Energy Poliey
WASHINGTON President Ford is expected to
announce soon a national energy policy relying on
oil taxes and tariffs to cut demand, and on opening
new federal oilfields to increase supply.
An informed administration source said Tuesday
the President accepted recommendations centered
on deliberately increasing oil prices $3 per barrel
but was still pondering how to compensate for the
resulting economic impact.
The oil price increase could raise gasoline prices
7% cents a gallon and draw some $18.6 billion a
year from the economy at present demand levels.
The source said this would be offset by a proposal
for general tax reductions.
The energy policy would reject direct limits on
oil imports, reduction of fuel allocations and
gasoline rationing.
Massive stockpiling of oil for emergencies would
not be proposed, the source said, but would be
studied by the National Petroleum Council, an
industry advisory group.
Ford also was not expected to propose
automobile efficiency standards or a horsepower
tax. But the source said auto makers have agreed to
improve vehicle mileage 4.0 percent, so their 1980
models would average about 20 miles per gallon.
Postmaster Klassen To Resign
WASHINGTON Elmer T. Klassen, the first
postmaster general not appointed by a President,
said yesterday he is resigning Feb. 15.
A short while later, the agency's board of
governors named Deputy Postmaster General
Benjamin F. Bailar to the $60,0C0-a-year position.
During his tenure, Klassen had been criticized for
the agency's alleged continuing inefficiency and
rising postal rates.
In a statement accompanying his resignation,
Klassem said, "My only reservation in stepping aside
is that it may appear I am yielding the battle to the
critics of the Postal Service. Nothing could be less
justified."
Bailar, 40, had been named deputy postmaster
general just last Dec. 3. He joined the agency in
April 1972 and served as senior assistant postmaster
general, first as the chief financial officer and then
as head of administration.
