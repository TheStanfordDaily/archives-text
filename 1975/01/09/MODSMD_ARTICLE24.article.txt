# Pub Board Gives $1950 To Campus Publications
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
A total of $1950 was allocated to
eight campus publications by the
ASSU Publications Board yesterday.
A subcommittee on funding,
headed by Tim Portwood of the Quad,
submitted its recommendations to the
Board after considering the proposals
of nine publications.
The Escondido Village Bulletin did
not receive any funding after the
subcommittee determined that the
publication could publish without a
Pub Board contribution. The Bulletin
had originally requested $240.
The Board approved $450 for Live
Oak after the subcommittee had
rejected the paper's proposal for
$l5OO. The subcommittee said it
originally rejected Live Oak's proposal
because the money was only needed to
"ease cashflow problems and to make
improvements in its paper" and
because the weekly publication "did
not show a real need."
In the ensuing discussion, Bill
Weinstein, editor of Live Oak,
modified his request to $5OO for basic
supplies such as "typewriters and art
gum erasers."
Pub Board Property
The $450 grant was finally made to
Live Oak with the stipulation that,
should Live Oak cease to publish
under the rules of the Publications
Board, the materials purchased with
the grant would become the property
of the Pub Board.
Other major publications on
campus, including the Daily, operate
under the same condition.
Since a definition of "cease to
publish" has yet to be agreed upon by
the Pub Board, despite the fact that

the ruling was used in the recent
dispute over control of the Chaparral,
a committee to explore the issue will
be established at the Board's next
meeting.
Other publications which received
funding include The Catalyst â€ž which
will be a quarterly magazine discussing
a different topic of social change in
each issue, and The Journal of the
International Metaphysical Cartel, a
philosophy humor magazine.' They
received $250 and $5O respectively.
'Outstanding' Proposal
The Gay People's Union newsletter
received $3OO for a proposal which
Portwood called "outstanding," while
the Chinese Students Association
newsletter and Min, an Asian students
newsletter, each received $2OO. The
Sequoia and Stanford Review were
each granted $250 to continue their
publications. .
All of these publications are no
longer eligible to receive funds from
the Publications Board for the rest of
the academic year. The main criteria
used to judge funding requests were
whether or not the money was
absolutely essential for the publication
to continue, and whether or not
another source was available.
The Publications Board will again
consider proposals for the funding of
publications some time late in Winter
Quarter or early in the Spring Quarter.
The exact time will be made public
when it is decided.
