# Seeks Parking Compromise
## Village Council Threatens Suit 
### PHILIP FEDER 
ihe fciscondido village council last
night decided to file a class action suit
against the University unless both
groups settle on a parking fee
assessment compromise.
JKathy Colson, head of the Council,
said, "We [the Council] have beep
advised that this is a classic class action
suit," because the Escondido Village
rental agreement specifies the
availability of parking spaces.
Colson and ASSU Sen. Pieter
Winsemius have discussed possible
compromises with Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape. Snape has
promised to discuss the matter .with
Robert Augsburger, vice president for
business and finance, Colson said.
'Out Of Action'
However, Augsburger told the Daily
last night that he will not consider the
matter "until later this week," because
members of his staff are "out of action
for medical reasons."
The ASSU Senate Monday
unanimously supported the Escondido
Village Council's boycott of the $7.50
parking fee assessment. The Senate
called on students not to purchase the
decals until the University clarified its
reasons for leveling the fee.
If there is no compromise by the
Jan. 20 deadline, the ASSU, pending
agreement by the Senate, will pay the
$2 parking citation, according to
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri.

Olivieri said yesterday, "I will
propose that the ASSU bail fund be
used [to pay parking violations] at the
next Senate meeting. The residents of
Escondido Village have a legitimate
gripe."
The next Senate meeting is
scheduled for next Wednesday night.
One possible compromise is that
Escondido Village residents buy
off-campus stickers in exchange for
free E. V. (Escondido Village) decals.
Those students who already bought
the E. V. stickers would be given a
refund if they choose, Colson said.
"We've put this [the compromise]
to the Administration, but we've had
no response as of yet," she said. "We
just want our rights. The
Administration's nickle and diming of
the students is ridiculous."
Marvin Herrington, director of
police services, said the parking system
here is one of the most equitable in
California. "I don't know of any place
[university] with free parking in the
country."
Already Paying
The Escondido Village Council told
residents that, "You are already
paying for the maintenance and police
enforcement of the residence lots in
your rent or room payment. None of
the $7.50 fee goes to the residence
lots."
Meanwhile, the Council is disputing
the University's $20 late fee on
payment of rent. Colson claimed the
fee was "illegal."

The Council asked the Legal
Counselling Office (LCO) here for help
in possible litigation against the
University. However, the LCO
declined because it cannot deal with
intra-University cases, Colson said.
"The big question now," she said,
"is how much money we will be
willing to spend."
Olivieri added that the ASSU has
been "trying to talk it out, resolve the
problem and right the wrong," of the
parking fee assessment. 'The
University is instituting an
adversary-type environment."
