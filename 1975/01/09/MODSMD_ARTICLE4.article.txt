# Woman Files Complaints Calling University Sexist
## 
### JOHN FREED 
A woman lecturer in the
Communication Department has filed
formal complaints with three federal
agencies responsible for enforcing civil
rights laws, charging the University
with three counts of sex
discrimination.
In a Jan. 3 letter to the three
agencies, Matilda Butler-Paisley of the
Institute for Communication Research
charged that the University denies
women equal employment
opportunity, equal opportunity to
participate in federally sponsored
programs and equal educational
opportunity.
The University has not prepared a
response.
"I just received [the complaint]
and haven't had time to study it,"
commented Provost William F. Miller.
"It's a little premature for us to make
any comment.... One of the first
things we're going to have to do is get
together and talk about this."

Butler-Paisley confirmed that the
Administration has not yet contacted
her about her allegations.
'Continued . . . Discrimination'
"They have not talked to me about
the matter," Butler-Paisley remarked.
"But there has been a continued
history of sex discrimination by this
University, so I assume they will take a
side."
Butler-Paisley said she hopes her
action will encourage others to relate
instances of sex discrimination here.
"I've included only complaints
about things I've seen around me," she
observed. "There are several groups
that have been meeting on this issue. I
hope that others will use this vehicle
to voice complaints."
Complaints Called Important
Anne Miner, the University
Affirmative Action Officer, said the
complaints were fairly important.
"Some of the charges are pretty
serious. It's a complicated document. I
can't say 'Gee, I think it's great' or
'lt's a bunch of garbage.' The
questions she does raise are useful; it's
good to have these issues dramatized,"
Miner commented.
In supporting documents,
Butler-Paisley's written complaint
alleges that only seven out of 207
positions of "administrative and
academic leadership" including
deans, department chairpersons and
endowed professorships are
occupied by women. The lecturer
specifically challenged the most recent
appointment to the Communication
Department faculty.
'Only White Males'
"This department has had only
white males appointed since it was
started in 1921," Butler-Paisley noted,
though she didn't specifically
condemn Communication Department
selection personnel. "One can argue

that the University Administration
. . . has not relayed the message that
[administrators] are committed to
affirmative action . . . and hence the
Communication Department is only
reflecting this attitude," she
concluded.
Arthur Bienenstock, faculty
affirmative action officer, disagreed
with Butler-Paisley's assessment of
alleged sexism in filling the upper
echelons of the Administration.
"I feel we've tried to run an
institution as free as possible from
sexism. We will probably file a
response to the complaint I think
we are obligated. At this point, I
would welcome a [federal] review,"
Bienenstock declared. "If they find
any faults, of course we'll try and
correct them."
Educational Opportunity
Butler-Paisley also alleged that
sexism permeating the University
inhibits equal educational opportunity
for women here.
"The machismo in Stanford's
self-image... is nowhere better
exemplified than in ... A Stanford
Education, [which] consists primarily
of essays, or personal philosophies of
undergraduate education .... I cannot
use it effectively with women students
because 18 of its 20 authors are men
and concerns of women students are
simply not addressed," Butler-Paisley
contended.
The final complaint registered
involves discrimination against persons
already on the instructional and
research staff attempting to participate
in federally sponsored research.
Butler-Paisley cites statistics showing
that 14 percent of research staff
members are women, while only eight
percent of Academic Council members
are female.

SEX DISCRIMINATION Anne Miner, the University Affirmative Action
Officer, concurs that charges filed against the University for sex discrimination
"are pretty serious."
A woman lecturer in the
Communication Department has filed
formal complaints with three federal
agencies responsible for enforcing civil
rights laws, charging the University
with three counts of sex
discrimination.
In a Jan. 3 letter to the three
agencies, Matilda Butler-Paisley of the
Institute for Communication Research
charged that the University denies
women equal employment
opportunity, equal opportunity to
participate in federally sponsored
programs and equal educational
opportunity.
The University has not prepared a
response.
"I just received [the complaint]
and haven't had time to study it,"
commented Provost William F. Miller.
"It's a little premature for us to make
any comment.... One of the first
things we're going to have to do is get
together and talk about this."

Butler-Paisley confirmed that the
Administration has not yet contacted
her about her allegations.
'Continued . . . Discrimination'
"They have not talked to me about
the matter," Butler-Paisley remarked.
"But there has been a continued
history of sex discrimination by this
University, so I assume they will take a
side."
Butler-Paisley said she hopes her
action will encourage others to relate
instances of sex discrimination here.
"I've included only complaints
about things I've seen around me," she
observed. "There are several groups
that have been meeting on this issue. I
hope that others will use this vehicle
to voice complaints."
Complaints Called Important
Anne Miner, the University
Affirmative Action Officer, said the
complaints were fairly important.
"Some of the charges are pretty
serious. It's a complicated document. I
can't say 'Gee, I think it's great' or
'lt's a bunch of garbage.' The
questions she does raise are useful; it's
good to have these issues dramatized,"
Miner commented.
In supporting documents,
Butler-Paisley's written complaint
alleges that only seven out of 207
positions of "administrative and
academic leadership" including
deans, department chairpersons and
endowed professorships are
occupied by women. The lecturer
specifically challenged the most recent
appointment to the Communication
Department faculty.
'Only White Males'
"This department has had only
white males appointed since it was
started in 1921," Butler-Paisley noted,
though she didn't specifically
condemn Communication Department
selection personnel. "One can argue

that the University Administration
. . . has not relayed the message that
[administrators] are committed to
affirmative action . . . and hence the
Communication Department is only
reflecting this attitude," she
concluded.
Arthur Bienenstock, faculty
affirmative action officer, disagreed
with Butler-Paisley's assessment of
alleged sexism in filling the upper
echelons of the Administration.
"I feel we've tried to run an
institution as free as possible from
sexism. We will probably file a
response to the complaint I think
we are obligated. At this point, I
would welcome a [federal] review,"
Bienenstock declared. "If they find
any faults, of course we'll try and
correct them."
Educational Opportunity
Butler-Paisley also alleged that
sexism permeating the University
inhibits equal educational opportunity
for women here.
"The machismo in Stanford's
self-image... is nowhere better
exemplified than in ... A Stanford
Education, [which] consists primarily
of essays, or personal philosophies of
undergraduate education .... I cannot
use it effectively with women students
because 18 of its 20 authors are men
and concerns of women students are
simply not addressed," Butler-Paisley
contended.
The final complaint registered
involves discrimination against persons
already on the instructional and
research staff attempting to participate
in federally sponsored research.

percent of Academic Council members
