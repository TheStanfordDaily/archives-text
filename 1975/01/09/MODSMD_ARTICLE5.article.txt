# Financial Aid Plan Recommends Equal Treatment For All Races
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Proposed new procedures for
University financial aid decisions call
for all students from low income
families to be treated the same,
regardless of race.
The "Draft Report on Minority
Financial Aid Packaging" recommends
that all students from low income
families seeking financial aid be
expected to provide $7OO in self help,
either through loans or assigned
campus jobs, during their first year
here. Aid for subsequent years would
come in the form of gift aid, either as

scholarships or grants, according to the
proposal.
The report was drafted by Financial
Aids Director Robert Huff, Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon and
Biology Prof. Paul Green, chairman of.
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA).
In the past, the University has met
demonstrated financial need of blacks,
native Americans and chicanos entirely
through scholarships and grants during
the freshman yeaf.. In subsequent
years, these minorities were then
expected to provide at least $5OO of
self help per year.
Existing Practice
The report states that "the existing
practice of exempting freshman
minority students [blacks, chicanos
and native American] from loans and
jobs is very much rooted in ' the
circumstances of the late 1960s when
virtually all minority students came
from economically and educationally
disadvantaged circumstances."
These "circumstances" have
changed since then and this is the
major reason for the procedure
changes, the report says.
The current basing of financial aid
policies exclusively on race may not be
entirely legal, the report also states.
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, said that admissions
procedures based on race have already
been challenged at the UC- Davis
Medical School.
Legal Challenge
The Superior Court in Yolo County
ruled against such procedures, Siena
said, "and the logic behind it [the
ruling] could be extended to financial
aids programs."
Other court cases on the issue in
California are pending, Siena said.
Huff and Green both termed the
proposed policy changes "reasonable"
but others still have reservations.
Cecilia Burciaga, assistant to the
president for chicano affairs, said,
"I'm not sure that the proposed
procedures have been given enough
thought. I'm not sure enough research
has been done on the internal Stanford
situation."
'Economically Disadvantaged'
While the report recommends that
aid go to those who are "economically
disadvantaged," Burciaga cautioned
that the term would have to be
defined very carefully.
David Asai, a senior majoring in
chemistry and also a CUAFA member,
said, he is willing to go along with the
report's proposal simply because,

under the current system, "some
minorities are not considered
minorities."
For example, the current policy
makes no distinctions for Asian
American and other Latin American
groups besides chicanos, he said.
However, he said, "I'm worried
about the phasing out of any people of
color, any minorities, at Stanford in
the next 10 years." He added that the
new proposal makes no guarantees of
funds to any minorities.
Amendment
He said he would only support the
proposal if an amendment is added,
"guaranteeing money to some
minorities, and thereby guaranteeing a
certain percentage of minorities on
campus."
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel,
another CUAFA member, agreed,
saying that "It's a little unfortunate
that we can't do something for
minorities."
The new proposed level of self-help
is about 40 percent below the average
expected from disadvantaged students
by Ivy League and other institutions
with whom Stanford competes for
students, according to a survey
conducted by the CUAFA.
Copies of the report are available to
all interested persons at the Financial
Aids Office, Old Union 214.
The committee will meet to discuss
the proposals at an open meeting
scheduled at 7:30 p.m., Jan. 21 at
Junipero House in Wilbur Hall.

expected to provide $7OO in self help,
either through loans or assigned
campus jobs, during their first year
here. Aid for subsequent years would
come in the form of gift aid, either as

scholarships or grants, according to the
proposal.
The report was drafted by Financial
Aids Director Robert Huff, Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon and
Biology Prof. Paul Green, chairman of.
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA).
In the past, the University has met
demonstrated financial need of blacks,
native Americans and chicanos entirely
through scholarships and grants during
the freshman yeaf.. In subsequent
years, these minorities were then
expected to provide at least $5OO of
self help per year.
Existing Practice
The report states that "the existing
practice of exempting freshman
minority students [blacks, chicanos
and native American] from loans and
jobs is very much rooted in ' the
circumstances of the late 1960s when
virtually all minority students came
from economically and educationally
disadvantaged circumstances."
These "circumstances" have
changed since then and this is the
major reason for the procedure
changes, the report says.
The current basing of financial aid
policies exclusively on race may not be
entirely legal, the report also states.
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, said that admissions
procedures based on race have already
been challenged at the UC- Davis
Medical School.
Legal Challenge
The Superior Court in Yolo County
ruled against such procedures, Siena
said, "and the logic behind it [the
ruling] could be extended to financial
aids programs."
Other court cases on the issue in
California are pending, Siena said.
Huff and Green both termed the
proposed policy changes "reasonable"
but others still have reservations.
Cecilia Burciaga, assistant to the
president for chicano affairs, said,
"I'm not sure that the proposed
procedures have been given enough
thought. I'm not sure enough research
has been done on the internal Stanford
situation."
'Economically Disadvantaged'
While the report recommends that
aid go to those who are "economically
disadvantaged," Burciaga cautioned
that the term would have to be
defined very carefully.
David Asai, a senior majoring in
chemistry and also a CUAFA member,
said, he is willing to go along with the
report's proposal simply because,

under the current system, "some
minorities are not considered
minorities."
For example, the current policy
makes no distinctions for Asian
American and other Latin American
groups besides chicanos, he said.
However, he said, "I'm worried
about the phasing out of any people of
color, any minorities, at Stanford in
the next 10 years." He added that the
new proposal makes no guarantees of
funds to any minorities.
Amendment
He said he would only support the
proposal if an amendment is added,
"guaranteeing money to some
minorities, and thereby guaranteeing a
certain percentage of minorities on
campus."
Anthropology Prof. Bernard Siegel,
another CUAFA member, agreed,
saying that "It's a little unfortunate
that we can't do something for
minorities."
The new proposed level of self-help
is about 40 percent below the average
expected from disadvantaged students
by Ivy League and other institutions
with whom Stanford competes for
students, according to a survey
conducted by the CUAFA.
Copies of the report are available to
all interested persons at the Financial
Aids Office, Old Union 214.
The committee will meet to discuss
the proposals at an open meeting
scheduled at 7:30 p.m., Jan. 21 at
Junipero House in Wilbur Hall.
