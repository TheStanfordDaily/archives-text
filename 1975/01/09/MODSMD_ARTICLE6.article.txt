## editorial Parking Fee 
### 
In the year of an announced tuition increase of $435, it
would be improper to blow out of proportion the
significance of a $7.50 auto registration fee.
Yet students can justly feel that the reinstatement of
such a fee for winter and spring quarters is unfair unless the
University can better justify it by explaining where the
dollars go.
The University is obligated to provide a rationale for how
it arrived at the $7.50 figure, which car-owning students are
required to pay by jan. 20.
Vice President for Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger explained that the $7.50 would cover the
acftninistrative cost of the registration process and would
provide some additional income besides. Such an
explanation raises the question of whether the University is
making money at the expense of student automobile
owners.
Moreover, faculty and staff are permitted to park free of
charge in better-located lots, an unfair arrangement to
students who feel these people can more easily afford to
dole out a registration fee than themselves.
As more victims of the housing draw are forced to live off
campus and subsequently purchase automobiles just so they
can make it to class on time, a reasonable explanation
defending a registration fee becomes even more important.
We support a student boycott of the purchase of parking
decals at least until the University provides a fuller
explanation of why it has levied this fee.
