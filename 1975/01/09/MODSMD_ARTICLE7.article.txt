# An Awful Crime?
## 
### Al Schwartz 
Maintaining the glorious
example set by business magnate,
Senator and robber baron Leland
Stanford Sr. is a task made most
difficult in these times of equal
protection under the law. It i§
with consummate skill that
Leland Stanford Jr. University
attempts the rip-off.
And succeeds.
Where else on earth could a
person be assessed for parking
spaces, parking privileges, car
registration, police protection and
road improvement, automatically
in the rent, even if that person
does not own a car*? Where else on
earth could that same person, if a
bar is indeed in his possession, be
reassessed at registration? If you
do not know, you deserve to pay
it.
I ride a bike. My total
consumption of petroleum
products last year, required while
covering over 2500 miles,
amounted to a half can of
"three-in-one" oil and four
counces of molybdenum grease.
Damn good economy, right? How
am I rewarded? Where did all
those fees for road improvement
go?
'Horrendous Expense'
Campus Drive and Mayfield
were built at horrendous expense.
To&wbad the expense was not
horrendous enough to include a
single painted stripe along the
side of the road for a bike lane.
Remember a certain fatal bike
accident not too long ago?
Serra Street, the main road up
the center of campus, is not
merely an atrocity, it appears to
me that its condition indicates

purposeful, malicious neglect by
the University.
I find it utterly impossible to
believe that a competently built
road whose major traffic consists
of bicycles (the area by the Quad,
for example) would crumble. I
find it utterly impossible to
believe that such a crumbled road,
a possibly fatal hazard for the
narrow tires of a bicycle, would
not be repaired. The neglect must
certainly be willful and directed.
Whiteraway, Fees?
So where do all these doubly
assessed fees go? Where have the
paid improvements been installed?
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger traces
these twice assessed fees to the
general fund, never to be seen
again.
Please do not misunderstand
me. Faculty are not assessed.
Remember, if the faculty were to
be charged $7.50 for a parking
space, road improvement, police
protection, and so on, ". . . we'd
probably have to raise their
salaries." Robert Augsburger,
Daily, Jan. 6.
As a graduate student and a
National Science Foundation
Fellowship holder, I am paid a
grand total of $3600 yearly,
before taxes. Who would raise my
salary? Who will pay the
undergraduates who have no
salary?
An awful crime, you say? No, a
very profitable one for the
University, for the general fund
and for Robert Augsburger, but
not for us.

An awful crime, you say? No, a
very profitable one for the
University, for the general fund
and for Robert Augsburger, but
not for us.
(Al Schwartz is a graduate student
in chemistry.)
Maintaining the glorious
example set by business magnate,
Senator and robber baron Leland
Stanford Sr. is a task made most
difficult in these times of equal
protection under the law. It i§
with consummate skill that
Leland Stanford Jr. University
attempts the rip-off.
And succeeds.
Where else on earth could a
person be assessed for parking
spaces, parking privileges, car
registration, police protection and
road improvement, automatically
in the rent, even if that person
does not own a car*? Where else on
earth could that same person, if a
bar is indeed in his possession, be
reassessed at registration? If you
do not know, you deserve to pay
it.
I ride a bike. My total
consumption of petroleum
products last year, required while
covering over 2500 miles,
amounted to a half can of
"three-in-one" oil and four
counces of molybdenum grease.
Damn good economy, right? How
am I rewarded? Where did all
those fees for road improvement
go?
'Horrendous Expense'
Campus Drive and Mayfield
were built at horrendous expense.
To&wbad the expense was not
horrendous enough to include a
single painted stripe along the
side of the road for a bike lane.
Remember a certain fatal bike
accident not too long ago?
Serra Street, the main road up
the center of campus, is not
merely an atrocity, it appears to
me that its condition indicates

purposeful, malicious neglect by
the University.
I find it utterly impossible to
believe that a competently built
road whose major traffic consists
of bicycles (the area by the Quad,
for example) would crumble. I
find it utterly impossible to
believe that such a crumbled road,
a possibly fatal hazard for the
narrow tires of a bicycle, would
not be repaired. The neglect must
certainly be willful and directed.
Whiteraway, Fees?
So where do all these doubly
assessed fees go? Where have the
paid improvements been installed?
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger traces
these twice assessed fees to the
general fund, never to be seen
again.
Please do not misunderstand
me. Faculty are not assessed.
Remember, if the faculty were to
be charged $7.50 for a parking
space, road improvement, police
protection, and so on, ". . . we'd
probably have to raise their
salaries." Robert Augsburger,
Daily, Jan. 6.
As a graduate student and a
National Science Foundation
Fellowship holder, I am paid a
grand total of $3600 yearly,
before taxes. Who would raise my
salary? Who will pay the
undergraduates who have no
salary?

very profitable one for the
University, for the general fund
and for Robert Augsburger, but
not for us.
