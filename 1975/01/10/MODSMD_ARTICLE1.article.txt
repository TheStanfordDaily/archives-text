# Theologist Brown Combines Activism With Religion
## 
### JANET BAILEY 
Want to talk to a man who has rubbed shoulders
with Niebuhr and Tillich, was a Protestant observer
by special invitation at Vatican 11, spent five days in
jail for aiding draft resisters and campaigned for
Eugene McCarthy in 1952 before most people knew
who McCarthy was?
Robert McAfee Brown professor of religious
studies, ordained Presbyterian minister and social
activist keeps his office hours faithfully.
Regardless of demands on his time, Brown remains
easily accessible to undergraduates and he is
concerned about them.
Students have difficulty reconciling Brown's
* image as social crusader and a widely published
scholar who is frequently in the national limelight,
with the unassuming man of 54, white-haired and
bespectacled, to whom they talk after class.
"He's so homey," says one student.
Emotional Expression
As Brown lectures, his hands shape invisible
► forms, point and beckon. His words burst out of
him, as though he is working to restrain emotions
too powerful for expression.
In his office he rests his feet on the desk as he
explains that his engagement in social issues is a
natural part of taking his Christian faith seriously.
"The church has been involved in politics all
} along," Brown asserts. "But it's tended to stay on
the side of the status quo."
Social Involvement
Brown's social involvement has extended from
the civil rights movement to anti-war
demonstrations to a personal association with Cesar
Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers.
"Brown does all the things most people only
preach about," comments a student.

During the period of escalation in Vietnam,
Brown received draft cards publicly and helped
draft resisters escape to Canada. In 1967 his article
in Look magazine, "In Conscience I Must Break the
Law," brought his actions to national attention.
Harsh Judgments
The following year, as a delegate to the World
Council of Churches, Brown appealed to the global
community to make harsh judgments against his
country for its actions in Vietnam.
"He just gives himself completely to the needs of
the world," says Brown's colleague, Jerry Irish,
assistant professor of religious studies.
Paralleling Brown's concern for political change
is his work to open up communication between
different branches of Christianity. Until
Congressman Eugene McCarthy's 1952 campaign, "I
held the typical Protestant anti-Catholic bias,"
Brown says. "I saw Catholicism as a big power grab,
a great menace."
But he became good friends with the Catholic
McCarthy family and realized that there were
Catholic lay people working in the political scene
"not to gain greater power for parochial schools but
to bring about human justice."
Undergrads Important
Undergraduate education is so important to
Brown that he gave up the prestige of a full
professorship at New York's Union Theological
Seminary where he was a colleague of
theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich —to
teach at Stanford.
"Everybody I respected thought I was crazy to
leave," Brown says of his decision. "It was a very
painful time. But I didn't want my professional
focus to get narrower and narrower. I needed the
wider sphere of an undergraduate classroom the

whole range of points of view."
"He's excited about what students are capable of
doing," says Irish. "He expects them to engage with
the material."
"He never makes you feel you have nothing to
contribute," says a freshman. "I found myself
speaking up in class about things I never dreamed I
would."
To Brown,"teaching and doing are interrelated,"
says Irish. In 1965 racial tensions were building
feverishly in Selma, Alabama, at the time that
Brown was preparing to discuss race relations in his
Christian Ethics course. So Brown took several days
off and went to Selma himself to gain deeper insight
into the racial problem.
His mid-quarter departure met with disapproval.
But Brown believes that the impact of the course
material "came much more vividly home" to his
students as a result.
Many Demands
Demands on Professor Brown's time are many.
And much of that time he spends doing favors.
"He doesn't just meet you he goes out and gets
you," says a student. "I told him I'd drop by his
house so he could sign a card for me. That day he
came to my dorm to sign it."
"If you even imply a request, he meets it," Irish
says. "And if you ask him to do something, it's
done.
"He's so open that he's perhaps vulnerable to
being used," says Irish, who has worked with Brown
for seven years. "He's honest with people and trusts
that they're honest with him. Well, he doesn't take
Gerald Ford at his word. But if the two were face to
face, Bob would assume Ford was telling him the
truth."

the world," says Brown's colleague, Jerry Irish,
assistant professor of religious studies.
Paralleling Brown's concern for political change
is his work to open up communication between
different branches of Christianity. Until
Congressman Eugene McCarthy's 1952 campaign, "I
held the typical Protestant anti-Catholic bias,"
Brown says. "I saw Catholicism as a big power grab,
a great menace."
But he became good friends with the Catholic
McCarthy family and realized that there were
Catholic lay people working in the political scene
"not to gain greater power for parochial schools but
to bring about human justice."
Undergrads Important
Undergraduate education is so important to
Brown that he gave up the prestige of a full
professorship at New York's Union Theological
Seminary where he was a colleague of
theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich —to
teach at Stanford.
"Everybody I respected thought I was crazy to
leave," Brown says of his decision. "It was a very
painful time. But I didn't want my professional
focus to get narrower and narrower. I needed the
wider sphere of an undergraduate classroom the

whole range of points of view."
"He's excited about what students are capable of
doing," says Irish. "He expects them to engage with
the material."
"He never makes you feel you have nothing to
contribute," says a freshman. "I found myself
speaking up in class about things I never dreamed I
would."
To Brown,"teaching and doing are interrelated,"
says Irish. In 1965 racial tensions were building
feverishly in Selma, Alabama, at the time that
Brown was preparing to discuss race relations in his
Christian Ethics course. So Brown took several days
off and went to Selma himself to gain deeper insight
into the racial problem.
His mid-quarter departure met with disapproval.
But Brown believes that the impact of the course
material "came much more vividly home" to his
students as a result.
Many Demands
Demands on Professor Brown's time are many.
And much of that time he spends doing favors.
"He doesn't just meet you he goes out and gets
you," says a student. "I told him I'd drop by his
house so he could sign a card for me. That day he
came to my dorm to sign it."
"If you even imply a request, he meets it," Irish
says. "And if you ask him to do something, it's
done.
"He's so open that he's perhaps vulnerable to
being used," says Irish, who has worked with Brown
for seven years. "He's honest with people and trusts
that they're honest with him. Well, he doesn't take
Gerald Ford at his word. But if the two were face to
face, Bob would assume Ford was telling him the
truth."

SOCIAL CRUSADER Religious Studies Prof. Robert McAfee Brown, pictured
here at a 1972 White Plaza rally protesting the intensified bombing of North
Vietnam, has involved himself in social causes ranging from civil rights to draft
resistance. Brown said he sees his engagement in social issues as a natural part of
taking his Christian faith seriously.
Want to talk to a man who has rubbed shoulders
with Niebuhr and Tillich, was a Protestant observer
by special invitation at Vatican 11, spent five days in
jail for aiding draft resisters and campaigned for
Eugene McCarthy in 1952 before most people knew
who McCarthy was?
Robert McAfee Brown professor of religious
studies, ordained Presbyterian minister and social
activist keeps his office hours faithfully.
Regardless of demands on his time, Brown remains
easily accessible to undergraduates and he is
concerned about them.
Students have difficulty reconciling Brown's
* image as social crusader and a widely published
scholar who is frequently in the national limelight,
with the unassuming man of 54, white-haired and
bespectacled, to whom they talk after class.
"He's so homey," says one student.
Emotional Expression
As Brown lectures, his hands shape invisible
► forms, point and beckon. His words burst out of
him, as though he is working to restrain emotions
too powerful for expression.
In his office he rests his feet on the desk as he
explains that his engagement in social issues is a
natural part of taking his Christian faith seriously.
"The church has been involved in politics all
} along," Brown asserts. "But it's tended to stay on
the side of the status quo."
Social Involvement
Brown's social involvement has extended from
the civil rights movement to anti-war
demonstrations to a personal association with Cesar
Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers.
"Brown does all the things most people only
preach about," comments a student.

During the period of escalation in Vietnam,
Brown received draft cards publicly and helped
draft resisters escape to Canada. In 1967 his article
in Look magazine, "In Conscience I Must Break the
Law," brought his actions to national attention.
Harsh Judgments
The following year, as a delegate to the World
Council of Churches, Brown appealed to the global
community to make harsh judgments against his
country for its actions in Vietnam.
"He just gives himself completely to the needs of
the world," says Brown's colleague, Jerry Irish,
assistant professor of religious studies.

you," says a student. "I told him I'd drop by his
house so he could sign a card for me. That day he
came to my dorm to sign it."
"If you even imply a request, he meets it," Irish
says. "And if you ask him to do something, it's
done.
"He's so open that he's perhaps vulnerable to
being used," says Irish, who has worked with Brown
for seven years. "He's honest with people and trusts
that they're honest with him. Well, he doesn't take
Gerald Ford at his word. But if the two were face to
face, Bob would assume Ford was telling him the
truth."

SOCIAL CRUSADER Religious Studies Prof. Robert McAfee Brown, pictured
here at a 1972 White Plaza rally protesting the intensified bombing of North
Vietnam, has involved himself in social causes ranging from civil rights to draft
resistance. Brown said he sees his engagement in social issues as a natural part of
taking his Christian faith seriously.
Want to talk to a man who has rubbed shoulders
with Niebuhr and Tillich, was a Protestant observer
by special invitation at Vatican 11, spent five days in
jail for aiding draft resisters and campaigned for
Eugene McCarthy in 1952 before most people knew
who McCarthy was?
Robert McAfee Brown professor of religious
studies, ordained Presbyterian minister and social
activist keeps his office hours faithfully.
Regardless of demands on his time, Brown remains
easily accessible to undergraduates and he is
concerned about them.
Students have difficulty reconciling Brown's
* image as social crusader and a widely published
scholar who is frequently in the national limelight,
with the unassuming man of 54, white-haired and
bespectacled, to whom they talk after class.
"He's so homey," says one student.
Emotional Expression
As Brown lectures, his hands shape invisible
► forms, point and beckon. His words burst out of
him, as though he is working to restrain emotions
too powerful for expression.
In his office he rests his feet on the desk as he
explains that his engagement in social issues is a
natural part of taking his Christian faith seriously.
"The church has been involved in politics all
} along," Brown asserts. "But it's tended to stay on
the side of the status quo."
Social Involvement
Brown's social involvement has extended from
the civil rights movement to anti-war
demonstrations to a personal association with Cesar
Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers.
"Brown does all the things most people only
preach about," comments a student.

During the period of escalation in Vietnam,
Brown received draft cards publicly and helped
draft resisters escape to Canada. In 1967 his article
in Look magazine, "In Conscience I Must Break the
Law," brought his actions to national attention.
Harsh Judgments
The following year, as a delegate to the World
Council of Churches, Brown appealed to the global
community to make harsh judgments against his
country for its actions in Vietnam.
"He just gives himself completely to the needs of
the world," says Brown's colleague, Jerry Irish,
assistant professor of religious studies.
Paralleling Brown's concern for political change
is his work to open up communication between
different branches of Christianity. Until
Congressman Eugene McCarthy's 1952 campaign, "I
held the typical Protestant anti-Catholic bias,"
Brown says. "I saw Catholicism as a big power grab,
a great menace."
But he became good friends with the Catholic
McCarthy family and realized that there were
Catholic lay people working in the political scene
"not to gain greater power for parochial schools but
to bring about human justice."
Undergrads Important
Undergraduate education is so important to
Brown that he gave up the prestige of a full
professorship at New York's Union Theological
Seminary where he was a colleague of
theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich —to
teach at Stanford.
"Everybody I respected thought I was crazy to
leave," Brown says of his decision. "It was a very
painful time. But I didn't want my professional
focus to get narrower and narrower. I needed the
wider sphere of an undergraduate classroom the

whole range of points of view."
"He's excited about what students are capable of
doing," says Irish. "He expects them to engage with
the material."
"He never makes you feel you have nothing to
contribute," says a freshman. "I found myself
speaking up in class about things I never dreamed I
would."
To Brown,"teaching and doing are interrelated,"
says Irish. In 1965 racial tensions were building
feverishly in Selma, Alabama, at the time that
Brown was preparing to discuss race relations in his
Christian Ethics course. So Brown took several days
off and went to Selma himself to gain deeper insight
into the racial problem.
His mid-quarter departure met with disapproval.
But Brown believes that the impact of the course
material "came much more vividly home" to his
students as a result.
Many Demands
Demands on Professor Brown's time are many.
And much of that time he spends doing favors.
"He doesn't just meet you he goes out and gets
you," says a student. "I told him I'd drop by his
house so he could sign a card for me. That day he
came to my dorm to sign it."
"If you even imply a request, he meets it," Irish
says. "And if you ask him to do something, it's
done.
"He's so open that he's perhaps vulnerable to
being used," says Irish, who has worked with Brown
for seven years. "He's honest with people and trusts
that they're honest with him. Well, he doesn't take
Gerald Ford at his word. But if the two were face to
face, Bob would assume Ford was telling him the
truth."
