# Pentagon Arms Race Ridiculous

### Steven Lewis 
The B-l supersonic bomber is the latest
contraption unveiled by the Pentagon in its
pursuit of world peace. According to one
Pentagon spokesman, the B-l can "fly rings
around the B-52." At a projected cost of
$76.4 million a plane, the B-l should fly
rings around Saturn.
Instead, the B-l has a range of 6100 miles,
a speed two times that of sound and the
ability to attack from treetop level to above
50,000 feet. The Pentagon wants 244 of
these bombers.
In addition to the B-l, the Pentagon is
developing the F-15 Eagle, AV-8A Harrier,
AWACS, Minuteman 111, etc., etc., etc.
Onward our insanity marches. We mustn't
let the Russians catch us, so we pump more
money into new weapons systems.
Lately, many member of Congress have
been talking much of "cutting the fat" from
the defense budget. Don't be fooled. There is
more "fat" in the defense budget than most
of these scissor-happy public officials would
admit. Nevertheless, they are staggering in
the right direction and we should encourage
them onward.
'Entangling Alliance'
There is an entangling alliance between
the Pentagon and industry that drains
valuable resources, and fuels inflation as few
areas of government spending can. Defense
spending does not provide goods that satisfy
Americans' real needs.
Indeed, defense spending is an abyss: as
soon as one weapons system is developed, it
is obsolete.

The government is spending an incredible
sum of money to create things Americans
cannot consume and to pay wages to workers
who cannot use the money to help consume
what they produce. As a result, inflation is
aggravated.
In reaction to those who are calling for
defense cuts, the Pentagon is sounding the
"Red alert." Pentagon strategists are warning
that the Russians will be able to knock out
the entire U.S. land-based missile force in a
single blow in the 1980s.
'Second Class' Force
These strategists also are warning against
the psychological effects that a "second
class" American military force might have on
our allies.
There's nothing like an all-expenses paid
trip to Cloudcuckooland courtesy of
Pentagon scare tactics. Napoleon would feel
right at home with our Pentagon strategists,
whose minds remain mired in conventional
warfare.
The significance today of being the most
powerful nation in the world is a paper one.
Clearly the tremendous costs of being "No.
1" far outweigh the imagined penalties of
being "No. 2."
The "overkill" feature of U.S.-Soviet
defense systems is both curious and ominous.
Our "overkill" mentality presumes the
Russians have at least nine lives. I don't
understand why an ability to wipe Russia off
the map once is not sufficient.
Of course, if we could wipe Russian off
the map only once, we would be the second

most powerful nation in the world! A lot of
good this would do the Russians.
Submarine Deterrent
The only major deterrent force the United
States needs is a fleet of nuclear submarines.
At the present time, we have nuclear
submarines equipped with Poseidon missiles
that have a 3000 mile range. We are currently
building the Trident submarine, which will
eventually carry missiles that have a 6000
mile range.
The Trident submarine is one of the few
areas of defense spending that makes any
sense at all. Submarines can hide beneath the
ocean until the need for action is clear.
Land-based missiles must be fired before
their silos are hit.
Dependence on a submarine-based
deterrent force would cost much less than
what we are now spending on deterrence.
The B-l bomber, anti-ballistic missile systems
and most other weapons systems are excess
baggage. They are signs of a paranoid
country.
We are not making ourselves any safer by
piling weapons system upon weapons system.
Defense today is as impossible as overkill is
useless. The Russians, of course, are just as
deluded as we.
When will our minds catch up with our
technology?
