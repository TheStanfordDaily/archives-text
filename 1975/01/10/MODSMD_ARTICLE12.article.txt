# Daily' Needs More Minority Input
## 
### Kathy Alcala 
A number of people have
complained to me that the Daily
pays little attention to the
minorities on campus.
As a reporter for the Daily and
a chicana, I assume they expect
me to justify, deny or change this
situation. I would like to change
it.
The news editors give the
following reasons for not running
more stories on minority affairs:
Stories in the Daily should be
of interest to most of the students
on campus.
Stories which have been
submitted in the past by minority
students have been too poorly
written for publication.
'Daily' Policy
One of the opinions editors,
who recently received two letters
signed "MEChA," will not run a
column which is not signed by a
specific person or people, in
accordance with Daily policy.
Several problems are apparent.
First of all, the nebulous entity
which makes the decisions for the
Daily feels that minority affairs
do not interest enough people to
warrant coverage. I haven't talked
to most of the people on campus,
but the people I have talked to,
Anglos and "Joe Stanford" types
included, give me a different
impression.
The students here are not so
narrow-minded that they are not
interested in groups or cultures of
which they are not members.
Adds To Anonymity
By not covering minority
events, the Daily is simply adding
to the anonymity which is already
quite prevalent on a campus of
12,000 students.
Second, it seems as though
many people here belong to a
minority group of some sort,
whether ethnic, religious or
whatever. I'm not sure exactly
whom the Daily is written for, but

one would think that at least
some of these people must read it.
Maybe not.
The quality of articles which
have been submitted is another
problem. Since the Daily seems to
consider its standards so high, I
would be willing to give a
workshop on writing if anyone is
interested. Of course, my own
ability is probably questionable
by such an exclusive publication,
but maybe someone can learn
from my mistakes.
Finally, there seems to be a
general lack of knowledge as to

the Daily's policies. With the case
of MEChA, maybe someone
should have asked why the articles
were not printed, or the opinions
editor should have told them.
In any case, people who are
interested in seeing things in the
Daily should not be afraid to go
the offices and ask questions, or
make suggestions. Many of the
people who work for it seldom
leave the building, and could use a
few new ideas.
Also, a Daily stylebook, which
shows the rules by which articles

are supposed to be written, is
always available. There's no
special magic to it. The Daily can
always use more reporters.
Your input is important. The
Daily cannot cover events which it
doesn't know about. The Daily
cannot write about people it
doesn't know about.
The Daily can keep ignoring
minority affairs and plod along in
its established routine if no one
cares enough to change it.
