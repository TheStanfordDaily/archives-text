# At 3.41, Problems Remain
## 
### Brian Farrell 
I am quite sure many students
who are now in the process of
applying to graduate and
professional schools will now
breathe a little easier knowing
that the average undergraduate
GPA is now computed at 3.41
rather than 3.55.
The real shame of the situation
lies, however, in the fact that
many of the graduate and
professional schools to which they
are applying, will never be able to
contrast the new figure with the
one that was reported in Time and
elsewhere.
My complaint is not that these
surveys are compiled or made
available. The real harm in these
computations is found when one
examines the manner in which
these surveys are taken and the
methods used to obtain proper
results.
The "semi-random" survey
released last October may or may
not prove to be detrimental to the
applications of many Stanford
seniors. What we must note is that

this misrepresentative sample was
taken and released to one of the
most widely read magazines in the
country.
The new survey does break
down the averages to the varying
schools, but I submit that a more
accurate way of reporting
statistics such as this would be
reporting by department. This, of
course, would be a more
cumbersome process, but it would
also be more valid to students and
admissions committees. These,
not Time and its audience, are the
people for whom the statistics are
important in the first place.
Secondly, I suggest that even
the more recent figure of 3.41 is
still misleading. The fact that
no-credit grades are not computed
is a grave mistake if the object of
such a survey is accuracy.
No-credits should be computed as
zero on a 4.0 scale. This should
not include classes dropped for
which a grade of no-credit is
reported, but a class which is
pursued and failed should be

reported as such if we are striving
for validity in the statistic.
I am not propounding that all
grades or grade point averages be
reported individually by the
Registrar's Office. I am merely
calling for an accurate figure to be
published if one is to be published
at all. If grades are "too high"
here at Stanford, that is a problem
that might possibly be looked
into.
In any case, however, we
should be more than wary of
misleading and inaccurate surveys
that are published—and attempt
to insure that no further invalid
statistics are compiled or made
available.

one that was reported in Time and
elsewhere.
My complaint is not that these
surveys are compiled or made
available. The real harm in these
computations is found when one
examines the manner in which
these surveys are taken and the
methods used to obtain proper
results.
The "semi-random" survey
released last October may or may
not prove to be detrimental to the
applications of many Stanford
seniors. What we must note is that

this misrepresentative sample was
taken and released to one of the
most widely read magazines in the
country.
The new survey does break
down the averages to the varying
schools, but I submit that a more
accurate way of reporting
statistics such as this would be
reporting by department. This, of
course, would be a more
cumbersome process, but it would
also be more valid to students and
admissions committees. These,
not Time and its audience, are the
people for whom the statistics are
important in the first place.
Secondly, I suggest that even
the more recent figure of 3.41 is
still misleading. The fact that
no-credit grades are not computed
is a grave mistake if the object of
such a survey is accuracy.
No-credits should be computed as
zero on a 4.0 scale. This should
not include classes dropped for
which a grade of no-credit is
reported, but a class which is
pursued and failed should be

reported as such if we are striving
for validity in the statistic.
I am not propounding that all
grades or grade point averages be
reported individually by the
Registrar's Office. I am merely
calling for an accurate figure to be
published if one is to be published
at all. If grades are "too high"
here at Stanford, that is a problem
that might possibly be looked
into.
In any case, however, we
should be more than wary of
misleading and inaccurate surveys
that are published—and attempt
to insure that no further invalid
statistics are compiled or made
available.

I am quite sure many students
who are now in the process of
applying to graduate and
professional schools will now
breathe a little easier knowing
that the average undergraduate
GPA is now computed at 3.41
rather than 3.55.
The real shame of the situation
lies, however, in the fact that
many of the graduate and
professional schools to which they
are applying, will never be able to
contrast the new figure with the
one that was reported in Time and
elsewhere.
