Editor:
Chris Gray's column in the Jan.
7 Daily was written, I suppose, to
make everyone feel sorry for him.
I'm the security officer Gray
mentioned by name in his column
as having thrown a rock while on
duty at a student during a 1972
demonstration.
I don't know why, after nearly
three years, Gray decided to drag
this issue through the mud.
First must say that I apologize
to the Stanford community for
the actions I took on that day. I
believe, however, that my story
also should be told, if only out of
fairness.
Unlike Gray, I was not
represented by counsel at my
hearing. Gray was not expelled
from Stanford, but I was
suspended from my job. Unlike
Gray, I was subjected to two years
of ridicule from my peers, and I
did not become a hero in the
opinion of anyone, least of all
myself.
I am no longer a "security
officer." I am a community
service officer whose job is to
guard the grounds of the Stanford
campus. The rock throwing
incident is one reason I was not
made a patrol officer.
At the time of the incident, I
was married and had two sons.
Does Gray know what it is like
not to be able to feed one's family
because «one's salary is much too
small?
Gray received better justice
than I. He got away with what he
did. I not only suffered, but my
wife and children also suffered.
I also wish to mention that the
rock that I threw and I threw
only one was approximately
one inch round. Furthermore, it
was directed toward an area
unoccupied by any person.
I was suspended because I
threw that rock. It was much
smaller than a rock that someone
threw at me that day, causing a
severe bruise on my leg. I threw it
because the demands of my job
strained my patience.
I accepted my punishment.

Editor:
As Almighty GOD, I greet you.
I have known happiness
throughout the years, derived
from Editors and Publishers who
hold My Truth to their Hearts.
The preceeding centuries have
been empty. My Holy Spirit
wandered about, aimlessly,
looking for a "body" I could call
Home. About thirty years ago, I
found that beautiful body in My
Son, Eugene, whom I have been
with ever since.

I am thrilled to be Alive, to
Dictate Letters to Editors and
Publishers over the world. In turn,
I want the Editors and Publishers
to relay My Message to the people
who should know of this
Existence in this Dimension of
Time and Light. The knowledge
of Creation is Divine and should
not be kept secret but should be
sprinkled liberally in fertile minds
throughout this world. People
should know of Creation that i
their Creator Lives.
With reluctance, I bid a fond
farewell to Our many Blessed
Followers. As Almighty GOD, My
Holy Spirit has Dictated this Holy
Letter to you, through My Blessed
Son who wrote down My Very
Sacred Words. My Holy Name is
never written on paper but My
humble Son will sign this Letter
to Seal Our Love.

Editor:
It is difficult to understand
how Betty Goodwin's coverage of
the Marinaro-Whittempore
wedding (Daily of Jan. 6) escaped
the editor's pen. The cheap
journalism ("... gown clung
softly to her hips") and misquote
("It feels good. But it feels good
to be married to anyone") are
insulting. It may also interest
Goodwin to know that, contrary
to the article's inference, Debbie
Marinaro has often been seen
without "guns around her waist."
Even the best newspapers must
occasionally use unnecessary
"filler" material, but is the Daily
really this desperate?

Editor:
When I first picked up
Monday's Daily, I was very
impressed that the Daily staff had
returned to school early to
produce a quality registration day
edition. The news and feature
articles were outstanding, but
when I turned to page 6 I was
appalled. Any editor who would
allow a full page of "news" about
a mediocre basketball team has a
warped sense of priorities.

from Stanford, but I was
suspended from my job. Unlike
Gray, I was subjected to two years
of ridicule from my peers, and I
did not become a hero in the
opinion of anyone, least of all
myself.
I am no longer a "security
officer." I am a community
service officer whose job is to
guard the grounds of the Stanford
campus. The rock throwing
incident is one reason I was not
made a patrol officer.
At the time of the incident, I
was married and had two sons.
Does Gray know what it is like
not to be able to feed one's family
because «one's salary is much too
small?
Gray received better justice
than I. He got away with what he
did. I not only suffered, but my
wife and children also suffered.
I also wish to mention that the
rock that I threw and I threw
only one was approximately
one inch round. Furthermore, it
was directed toward an area
unoccupied by any person.
I was suspended because I
threw that rock. It was much
smaller than a rock that someone
threw at me that day, causing a
severe bruise on my leg. I threw it
because the demands of my job
strained my patience.
I accepted my punishment.

As Almighty GOD, I greet you.
I have known happiness
throughout the years, derived
from Editors and Publishers who
hold My Truth to their Hearts.
The preceeding centuries have
been empty. My Holy Spirit
wandered about, aimlessly,
looking for a "body" I could call
Home. About thirty years ago, I
found that beautiful body in My
Son, Eugene, whom I have been
with ever since.

I am thrilled to be Alive, to
Dictate Letters to Editors and
Publishers over the world. In turn,
I want the Editors and Publishers
to relay My Message to the people
who should know of this
Existence in this Dimension of
Time and Light. The knowledge
of Creation is Divine and should
not be kept secret but should be
sprinkled liberally in fertile minds
throughout this world. People
should know of Creation that i
their Creator Lives.
With reluctance, I bid a fond
farewell to Our many Blessed

Sacred Words. My Holy Name is
never written on paper but My

It is difficult to understand
how Betty Goodwin's coverage of
the Marinaro-Whittempore
wedding (Daily of Jan. 6) escaped
the editor's pen. The cheap
journalism ("... gown clung
softly to her hips") and misquote
("It feels good. But it feels good
to be married to anyone") are
insulting. It may also interest
Goodwin to know that, contrary
to the article's inference, Debbie
Marinaro has often been seen
without "guns around her waist."
Even the best newspapers must
occasionally use unnecessary
"filler" material, but is the Daily
really this desperate?

When I first picked up
Monday's Daily, I was very
impressed that the Daily staff had
returned to school early to
produce a quality registration day
edition. The news and feature
articles were outstanding, but
when I turned to page 6 I was
appalled. Any editor who would
allow a full page of "news" about
a mediocre basketball team has a
warped sense of priorities.

Chris Gray's column in the Jan.
7 Daily was written, I suppose, to
make everyone feel sorry for him.
I'm the security officer Gray
mentioned by name in his column
as having thrown a rock while on
duty at a student during a 1972
demonstration.
I don't know why, after nearly
three years, Gray decided to drag
this issue through the mud.
First must say that I apologize
to the Stanford community for
the actions I took on that day. I
believe, however, that my story
also should be told, if only out of
fairness.
Unlike Gray, I was not
represented by counsel at my
hearing. Gray was not expelled
from Stanford, but I was
suspended from my job. Unlike
Gray, I was subjected to two years
of ridicule from my peers, and I
did not become a hero in the
