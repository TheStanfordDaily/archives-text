# 3.4 or 3.55--Does It Really Make A Difference?
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
It's very likely that most undergraduates
here did something unusual this week: they
cheered when they learned that their grades
weren't as high as they had thought.
Last October, most students were surprised
~ and concerned when a "semi-random"
survey indicated that their average letter grade
during autumn quarter of 1973 was 3.55. A
more comprehensive survey released this week
found that the average for the academic year
1973-74 was closer to 3.4.
This small decrease may make students feel
more secure about their own position relative
to their peers, and about their prospects for
admission to professional or graduate schools,
but it appears that a significant portion of the
faculty is less than satisfied with the new

figure.
For instance, the Faculty Senate's Ad Hoc
Panel to Study the Grading System had the
new survey results in hand when it
recommended sweeping changes in the current
grading system. Taken as a whole, these
changes clearly are intended to bring the
average grade figure down even further.
The Panel recommended that the
University reinstate a "drop deadline" for
classes and a no credit notation on a student's
transcript if he or she drops or does not pass a
course after that deadline.
Two Major Effects
If approved by the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(C-AAA) and the full Senate, these
recommendations would have two major

effects.
First, it would be far more difficult for
students doing poorly in a class to "duck" a C
by either dropping the course or intentially
taking a no credit in it.
Second, by adding a new, lower grade
option the recorded no credit the panel's
recommendations would probably encourage
professors to give more C's than they are now.
'Barely Any C's Given'
Last autumn, Statistics Prof. Bradley
Efron, who chairs the ad hoc panel, pointed
out that "barely any C's are given any more
because that's the worst grade now and
professors feel bad about giving it." Indeed,
the survey released this week found that C's
accounted for only eight percent of the grades
given to undergraduates during the 1973-74
academic year.
In addition, if the no credit notation is
assigned a zero value on a four-point grade
scale, then the average letter grade would drop
still lower. Using this formula, the average
letter grade for the 1973-74 academic year
would have been 3.2 instead of 3.4
So the ad hoc panel's recommendations
could have quite pronounced effects. But
whether those recommendations will ever be
approved is very much open to question. The
first hurdle they must clear is the C-AAA,
the parent committee of the panel.
Narrow Margin Possible
While C-AAA Chairman Alexander Fetter
doesn't believe the committee "will alter the
recommendations substantially," he pointed
to the narrow 5-4 margin by which the ad hoc
panel approved its proposals, and said the vote
could be similarly close in C-AAA. Fetter is.
physics professor.

Assuming that the panel's - plan passes
through the C-AAA unscathed, it must still
clear the full Faculty Senate. Matters are
similarly clouded there, particularly because
the Senate probably won't even consider the
grading controversy until spring quarter.
History Department Chairman Gordon A.
Craig, who chairs the Senate this year,
predicted that the vote there "can go either
way."
He said that opponents of the current

grading system might be "a little easier of
mind" after the survey released this week
revealed that the average letter grade was 3.4
rather than 3.55, but added that this would
probably have little effect upon how they
would ultimately vote.
So, while it's definitely premature to start
panicking about the future of your grade
average, it might not be a bad idea to start
planning for some rougher academic weather
ahead.
