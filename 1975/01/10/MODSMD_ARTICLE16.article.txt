# Look For Stanford To Win Out
## City Council Nears Decision On Willow Road 
### MARK FUNK 
The controversial $6.6 million Willow
Road widening and improvement project,
which has been weighing heavily on the minds
of Stanford administrators and Palo Alto city
fathers of late, appears headed for a final
settlement Monday night when the City
Council convenes tc consider seven alternative
plans placed before it.
Speculation in most quarters is that the
Council's decision, which has been delayed for
over two months because of opposition to
each of the alternatives, will likely favor the
University.
The problem centers on a grove of oak and
eucalyptus trees which stand in the path of a
proposed four-lane roadway on the approach
to El Camino Real, north of the Stanford
Shopping Center.
One faction on the Council is outspokenly
in favor of preserving the cluster of trees,
which borders the banks of the San
Francisquito Creek.
The University, on the other hand, has
suggested that the road be routed through the
trees rather than through a Stanford-owned
parking lot which is leased by the Shopping
Center.
May Veto Project
In fact, University officials support this
plan so strongly that they may veto the
project if the final decision is contrary to the
University's position.
Any roadway on the parking lot would
effectively hinder future Shopping Center
expansion. And if the mall can't expand,
Stanford gains no new sorely needed
revenue.
Mind you, Administration officials have
been careful not to catagorically state that
there will be expansion (they choose instead
to say shop owners are opposed to losing the
parking space and want better access to their
store). Nonetheless, expansion is on their
minds.

The problem that has forced the Council to
repeatedly postpone any decision on Willow
Road is opposition, not only to the widening
itself, but to each of the seven proposals
before the Council.
The eight-member Council (the ninth,
Mayor Byron Sher, has disqualified himself
from voting because he is a Stanford faculty
member) is expected to pass an alternative
favorable to the University by a 5-3 or 6-2
margin.
John Beahrs, a fiscal conservative, is
expected to cast a "yes" vote. So, too, is
Council member Roy Clay. Both have been
pro-Stanford on issues in the past.
Alan Henderson, vice mayor and normally
a supporter of most University-related
positions, is strongly in the camp of a
conservation-minded citizens group which has

banded together to save the grove. A "no"
vote.
Council member John Berwald, who has
been moderately pro-University, should
remain so, but Kirke Comstock may be the
only person on the Council who might cast a
swing vote.
Doubt Over Comstock
People are hedging their bets on which way
Comstock will go.
Two more "yes" votes should be delivered
by Richard Rosenbaum, who introduced the
compromise alternative, and Stanley Norton,
a Stanford graduate.
And that leaves Enid Pearson a vehement
opponent of the road widening. She was at
one time characterized by a writer as the
person who continually demands flesh (at
least a pound) from the University. Nothing's

changed, but she is a capable spokesman for
her cause.
In past fights with the University, a
number of the allegations Pearson has made
about Stanford's plans have indeed come true.
Judging from a recent statement, credited to
Robert R. Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,and printed
in a recent Stanford news release, she may be
close to the truth again.
"If Willow Road were already in place
between Arboretum and El Camino, and if
Stanford were proposing to build a shopping
center, good planning would dictate that the
center's frontage roads, parking lots, access
roads and buildings be well removed from the
roadway, and that they be well buffered by
trees, shrubbery and berms," Augsburger said.
It all boils down to dollars and cents.
