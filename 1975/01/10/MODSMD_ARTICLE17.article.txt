# Promises Put Brown On Budget Tightrope
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
For Edmund G. Brown Jr., it's put-up or
shut-up time.
The 36-year-old attorney and secretary of
state was sworn in Monday morning as
California's 34th governor in a ceremony best
characterized as austere. In an eight-minute
inaugural address, Brown pledged to
undertake what will undoubtedly be the
toughest task of his brief political career: an
attempt to stimulate the sluggish state
economy while cutting back state spending
and not raising taxes.
If the face wasn't familiar, at least some of
the rhetoric was. Interesting enough, much of
it sounded suspiciously similar to that of
former Gov. Ronald Reagan: "cut, squeeze
and trim." But at the same time Brown was
invoking the memory of his conservative
predecessor, he was also serving notice that

things wouldn't be the same in Sacramento.
On the conservative side of the ledger,
Brown reiterated his campaign pledge of no
new taxes this year, and said he would cut
spending in his own office by seven percent as
an example to other arms of the state
bureaucracy. And, in speeches to
local-government officials in San Francisco
and Los Angeles, he warned them there will
be less state money to help fund their
programs.
But at the same time, Brown was also
proposing moves that would have been
anathema to Reagan: elimination of the oil
depletion allowance, repeal of certain tax
breaks for business, expanded child day care
programs, establishment of state-subsidized
jobs for unemployed Californians, and
unemployment insurance for farm laborers.
The big question, of course, is whether
Brown can accomplish his fiscal stability goals

without putting the knife to the state's social
programs. In eight years under Reagan, an
increasing share of the welfare and mental
health burden was returned to the local
governments, and when they could not be
met,the programs were often cut back. But for
the liberal Brown to adopt that course could
be as politically unfeasible for him as it would
be unexpected.
In any event, the new governor will have to
tread carefully. For all the shows of joy at
returning to power after eight years of
Reagan, many powerful and ambitious
Democrats remain wary of Brown and will be
waiting for a false step on his part.
These include Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy, traditionally the second most
powerful man in state government after the
governor, Treasurer Jess Unruh, former
assembly speaker and 1970 gubernatorial
nominee who may still possess dreams of

higher office, and maybe even Lt. Gov.
Mervyn Dymally, who promptly after his
election blasted the state Democratic Party
machinery that helped mastermind the Brown
election.
For now, though, it's time for Brown to
show Californians just what he can
accomplish. Above his campaign promises, the
new governor placed an even higher priority in
his Monday address. Noting that more than
half the people who could have voted in
November did not, he said, "the biggest vote
of all in November was a vote of no
confidence.
"So our first order of business is to regain
the trust of confidence of the people we
serve." To a Watergate-weary inflation- and
recession-buffeted state, it remains to be seen
whether Brown can restore that
confidence... or whether anyone can.

state was sworn in Monday morning as
California's 34th governor in a ceremony best
characterized as austere. In an eight-minute
inaugural address, Brown pledged to
undertake what will undoubtedly be the
toughest task of his brief political career: an
attempt to stimulate the sluggish state
economy while cutting back state spending
and not raising taxes.
If the face wasn't familiar, at least some of
the rhetoric was. Interesting enough, much of
it sounded suspiciously similar to that of
former Gov. Ronald Reagan: "cut, squeeze
and trim." But at the same time Brown was
invoking the memory of his conservative
predecessor, he was also serving notice that

things wouldn't be the same in Sacramento.
On the conservative side of the ledger,
Brown reiterated his campaign pledge of no
new taxes this year, and said he would cut
spending in his own office by seven percent as
an example to other arms of the state
bureaucracy. And, in speeches to
local-government officials in San Francisco
and Los Angeles, he warned them there will
be less state money to help fund their
programs.
But at the same time, Brown was also
proposing moves that would have been
anathema to Reagan: elimination of the oil
depletion allowance, repeal of certain tax
breaks for business, expanded child day care
programs, establishment of state-subsidized
jobs for unemployed Californians, and
unemployment insurance for farm laborers.
The big question, of course, is whether
Brown can accomplish his fiscal stability goals

without putting the knife to the state's social
programs. In eight years under Reagan, an
increasing share of the welfare and mental
health burden was returned to the local
governments, and when they could not be
met,the programs were often cut back. But for
the liberal Brown to adopt that course could
be as politically unfeasible for him as it would
be unexpected.
In any event, the new governor will have to
tread carefully. For all the shows of joy at
returning to power after eight years of
Reagan, many powerful and ambitious
Democrats remain wary of Brown and will be
waiting for a false step on his part.
These include Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy, traditionally the second most
powerful man in state government after the
governor, Treasurer Jess Unruh, former
assembly speaker and 1970 gubernatorial
nominee who may still possess dreams of

higher office, and maybe even Lt. Gov.
Mervyn Dymally, who promptly after his
election blasted the state Democratic Party
machinery that helped mastermind the Brown
election.
For now, though, it's time for Brown to
show Californians just what he can
accomplish. Above his campaign promises, the
new governor placed an even higher priority in
his Monday address. Noting that more than
half the people who could have voted in
November did not, he said, "the biggest vote
of all in November was a vote of no
confidence.
"So our first order of business is to regain
the trust of confidence of the people we
serve." To a Watergate-weary inflation- and
recession-buffeted state, it remains to be seen
whether Brown can restore that
confidence... or whether anyone can.
For Edmund G. Brown Jr., it's put-up or
shut-up time.
