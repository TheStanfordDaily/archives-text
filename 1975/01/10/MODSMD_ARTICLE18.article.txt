# Escondido Dwellers, ASSU Join Forces Over Parking
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The clash between Administration officials
and two student groups the ASSU Senate
and the Escondido Village Council reached
a critical stage this week over the $7.50
parking fee assessment.
The Council decided to file a class action
suit against the University if no compromise is
reached. It appears that the Council will have
the support of the ASSU Senate in its dealings
with the University.
Possible compromises were discussed
informally, but no substantial progress has
been made toward an agreement. Police
officials have insisted that cars without the
parking decal will be cited after the Jan. 20
deadline.
If no compromise is reached, ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri will propose
to the ASSU Senate next Wednesday that the
Association's bail fund be used to reimburse

any student cited for the $2 violation.
Earlier in the week, the ASSU Senate
unanimously supported the Escondido Village
Council's boycott of the parking fee
assessment. The Senate called on students not
to purchase the decals until the University
clarified its reasons for levying the fee.
The Council claims that Escondido Village
residents are already paying for the
maintenance and police enforcement of the
residence lots in rent and room payments.
"None of the $7.50 fee goes to the residence
lots," a Council newsletter said.
One compromise being suggested by the
Council is that Escondido Village residents
buy off-campus stickers at the regular price in
exchange for free E. V. (Escondido Village)
decals. Those who already bought E. V.
stickers would be given a refund if they so
choose.
The ASSU Senate unanimously approved a
resolution this week authored by Sen. Pieter
Winsemius, an Escondido Village resident.
While asking the University to clarify its
position, the resolution also proposed that:
—if the parking fee is for registration
purposes only, then no student should be
required to pay "more than the associated
administrative expenses;" and
—if the parking fee is for services provided,
such as road maintenance and police
protection, then "those students on the
Stanford campus should not be required to
pay such a fee."
The only Administration official who has
broached the issue is police services director
Marvin Herrington. He contended that the
parking system here is more "equitable" than
that of any other university in California.
The Council is seeking legal advice for what
Chairperson Kathy Colson called "a classic
class action suit," which she expects the
University will lose.
The final decision is now in the
University's hands. It opposes two influential
student groups in a battle that both sides hope
can be settled out of court.

resolution this week authored by Sen. Pieter
Winsemius, an Escondido Village resident.
While asking the University to clarify its
position, the resolution also proposed that:
—if the parking fee is for registration
purposes only, then no student should be
required to pay "more than the associated
administrative expenses;" and
—if the parking fee is for services provided,
such as road maintenance and police
protection, then "those students on the
Stanford campus should not be required to
pay such a fee."
The only Administration official who has
broached the issue is police services director
Marvin Herrington. He contended that the
parking system here is more "equitable" than
that of any other university in California.
The Council is seeking legal advice for what
Chairperson Kathy Colson called "a classic
class action suit," which she expects the
University will lose.
The final decision is now in the
University's hands. It opposes two influential
student groups in a battle that both sides hope
can be settled out of court.
The clash between Administration officials
and two student groups the ASSU Senate
and the Escondido Village Council reached
a critical stage this week over the $7.50
parking fee assessment.
The Council decided to file a class action
suit against the University if no compromise is
reached. It appears that the Council will have
the support of the ASSU Senate in its dealings
with the University.
Possible compromises were discussed
informally, but no substantial progress has
been made toward an agreement. Police
officials have insisted that cars without the
parking decal will be cited after the Jan. 20
deadline.
If no compromise is reached, ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri will propose
to the ASSU Senate next Wednesday that the
Association's bail fund be used to reimburse

any student cited for the $2 violation.
Earlier in the week, the ASSU Senate
unanimously supported the Escondido Village
Council's boycott of the parking fee
assessment. The Senate called on students not
to purchase the decals until the University
clarified its reasons for levying the fee.
The Council claims that Escondido Village
residents are already paying for the
maintenance and police enforcement of the
residence lots in rent and room payments.
"None of the $7.50 fee goes to the residence
lots," a Council newsletter said.
One compromise being suggested by the
Council is that Escondido Village residents
buy off-campus stickers at the regular price in
exchange for free E. V. (Escondido Village)
decals. Those who already bought E. V.
stickers would be given a refund if they so
choose.
