# Volunteers Experience Asian Cultures
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
"Just basic living was different
waking up to chickens in the
backyard, taking an Indonesian
bath, having an Indonesian
breakfast. There's nothing in
common with living in the United
States."
An undergraduate participant
in the Volunteers In Asia (VIA)
program, senior Brad Palmquist
lived in Central Java for six
months where he taught English
at a technical school for high
school graduates.
Each year 25 or 30 volunteers
undergraduates and recent
graduates are posted in
Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan and the
Phillipines. While living with local
families, they teach English, work
on regional planning for the

United Nations or work with
basic village technology.
"This is an unusually good way
for Westerners to begin to come
to some understanding of the
Asian culture," explained VIA
director Dwight Clark. He added
that this belief is basic to the
format of the program.
Equal Exchange
Clark emphasized, "We know
volunteers will learn as much as
they teach. We're very frank
about this with institutions in
Asia. Then we're not Westerners
popping in with good gifts to
bring."
The program, begun in 1963 as
a one-time summer-work program
located in Hong Kong, is
funded by small family
foundations, small corporations
and organizations such as

Volunteers for International
Development.
"It is completely private," said
Clark. "The volunteers are seen as
individual human beings not as
representatives of certain
organization."
Leadership
The program, governed by a
seven-member board of directors,
is mainly run by former
volunteers. According to Clark,
"They're the ones who really
share our plans for the future."
Clark has recently returned
from Indonesia where he spoke
with volunteers at VlA's annual
conference, and institution leaders
on an individual basis in order to
finalize available posts for this
year.
Former volunteer Mary Pat
o'Connell,who taught science and
math in the Phillipines for nine
months,explained that VIA "tries
hard not to have someone [from
VIA] doing something that
someone from the area could do
as well."
A recent returnee from the
Phillipines, Laurie Hedden, added

that taking a job away from a
local person would perpetuate
"the type of imperialism we're
trying to avoid."
Both Hedden and O'Connell
praised the rewards of establishing
close relationships with members
of their communities. "You feel
you've crossed some barriers,"
said Hedden.
After nine months in the
Phillipines, O'Connell felt she was
"just beginning." Hedden decided
to extend her stay for another six
months.
"I definitely would like to go
back someday," said O'Connell.
"I don't know when or in what
circumstances, but I would want
to live day by day without a time
limit."
Selection and training
procedures for VIA take place at
Stanford, Pomona and UC-Santa
Cruz. Applications due by
January 20 of each year are not
limited to students at those
universities. Graduates usually
spend two years at their posts;
undergraduates stay for six, nine
or 12 months.

bath, having an Indonesian
breakfast. There's nothing in
common with living in the United
States."
An undergraduate participant
in the Volunteers In Asia (VIA)
program, senior Brad Palmquist
lived in Central Java for six
months where he taught English
at a technical school for high
school graduates.
Each year 25 or 30 volunteers
undergraduates and recent
graduates are posted in
Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan and the
Phillipines. While living with local
families, they teach English, work
on regional planning for the

United Nations or work with
basic village technology.
"This is an unusually good way
for Westerners to begin to come
to some understanding of the
Asian culture," explained VIA
director Dwight Clark. He added
that this belief is basic to the
format of the program.
Equal Exchange
Clark emphasized, "We know
volunteers will learn as much as
they teach. We're very frank
about this with institutions in
Asia. Then we're not Westerners
popping in with good gifts to
bring."
The program, begun in 1963 as
a one-time summer-work program
located in Hong Kong, is
funded by small family
foundations, small corporations
and organizations such as

Volunteers for International
Development.
"It is completely private," said
Clark. "The volunteers are seen as
individual human beings not as
representatives of certain
organization."
Leadership
The program, governed by a
seven-member board of directors,
is mainly run by former
volunteers. According to Clark,
"They're the ones who really
share our plans for the future."
Clark has recently returned
from Indonesia where he spoke
with volunteers at VlA's annual
conference, and institution leaders
on an individual basis in order to
finalize available posts for this
year.
Former volunteer Mary Pat
o'Connell,who taught science and
math in the Phillipines for nine
months,explained that VIA "tries
hard not to have someone [from
VIA] doing something that
someone from the area could do
as well."
A recent returnee from the
Phillipines, Laurie Hedden, added

that taking a job away from a
local person would perpetuate
"the type of imperialism we're
trying to avoid."
Both Hedden and O'Connell
praised the rewards of establishing
close relationships with members
of their communities. "You feel
you've crossed some barriers,"
said Hedden.
After nine months in the
Phillipines, O'Connell felt she was
"just beginning." Hedden decided
to extend her stay for another six
months.
"I definitely would like to go
back someday," said O'Connell.
"I don't know when or in what
circumstances, but I would want
to live day by day without a time
limit."
Selection and training
procedures for VIA take place at
Stanford, Pomona and UC-Santa
Cruz. Applications due by
January 20 of each year are not
limited to students at those
universities. Graduates usually
spend two years at their posts;
undergraduates stay for six, nine
or 12 months.
"Just basic living was different
waking up to chickens in the
backyard, taking an Indonesian
bath, having an Indonesian
breakfast. There's nothing in
common with living in the United
States."
