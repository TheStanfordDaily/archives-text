# Tax-Exempt Bond Sale To Aid Building Plans
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
The University has sold a $16.9
million tax-exempt bond issue through
the California Educational Facilities
Authority (CEFA), a state agency
established in 1972 to help private
colleges gain tax-exempt status for
their bonds.
The bond, bought at 7.18 percent
* by the Bank of America, was the first
ever sold under the auspices of the
CEFA. The CEFA assumes no liability
for the debt but only "seeks to
encumber or otherwise secure assets
for private institutions of higher
learning," according to University
f Director of Finances Rod Adams.
"Stanford cannot, by itself, issue a
tax-exempt bond," said Adams.
"Some form of state agency, or
municipality, must do the actual
selling, and that's where the CEFA
comes in. The bondholder, though, is
% buying as a creditor of Stanford, not
of the state."
Funds from the bond have been
earmarked for various construction
projects, including refinancing the
already-completed Escondido IV
apartments, and the University central
â€¢ food service facility. Funds were also
earmarked for financing general plant
improvements and construction at the
Stanford Hospital.
Useful Vehicle
"We feel that bonds like this will be
a very useful vehicle to help us plan
out our needs," Adams stated. "It

often happens that someone offers us
a large amount of money for new
construction, but not enough for the
entire project.
"In those cases, especially new
housing when we can count on
revenue from the building when we're
finished, we can easily justify
borrowing to raise more money."
Adams estimated that the bond's
tax-exempt status would save the
school over $400,000 in interest costs,
since the going rate for loans that are
not tax exempt is usually about two
percent higher.
Outside Financing
"We were ordered by the Board of
Trustees to seek outside financing for
construction, so if we couldn't get this
bond issue we would have had to turn
to the much more expensive means of
funding," Adams noted.
Adams said that $l3 million of the
bond would mature in 25 years, with
the remainder due during the first 10
years of the loan. He called the time
terms of the bond "very favorable"
and said he doubted that such a
long-term loan could have been
obtained if it were subject to tax.
State Treasurer Jess Unruh, who
unveiled the terms of the loan
Wednesday, said the bond was a
significant step in state aid to higher
education.
"At no time in the nation's history
have our private institutions of higher
learning been more in need of public
support," he said.
