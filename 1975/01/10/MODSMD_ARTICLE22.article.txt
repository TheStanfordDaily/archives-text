# The 						Search For Life On Mars Helps Treat Disease On Earth
## 
### 
A search for life on Mars will
begin this year and Stanford
scientists are actively involved.
Dr. Joshua Lederberg,
chairman of the Stanford
Department of Genetics, and Dr.
Elliott Levinthal, director of the
Instrumentation Research
Laboratory at Stanford Medical
School, are now involved in the
camera system and life-detection
experiments to be carried out on
the planet during the Viking
mission in mid-1976.
Both scientists were involved
with the Mariner 9 mission of
1972, the satellite which mapped
more than 85 percent of the
surface of Mars.
Mariner 9 also revealed huge
rifts that suggest the planet's
interior may be geologically alive.
Photos showed volcanoes larger
than any on earth, giant basins
and channels extending for
hundreds of miles with small
tributaries and high "walls"
suggesting water erosion.
During the Viking mission, the
scientists will seek answers to such
questions as whether the
wandering channels are beds of
ancient rivers, how much free
water is available to possible living
systems, and how thick the polar
caps might be.
The biology experiments
devised at Stanford are based on
the assumption that life on Mars

would depend upon the same
basic carbon chemistry that
supports life on earth. Dr.
Levinthal says, "We have no
reason to think that there are
people like us on Mars now. ..
The search for intelligent life
elsewhere in the universe is
another ballgame."
Dr. Lederberg agrees that the
likelihood of finding living
organisms during the Viking
mission are not great. "We know
so little about the habitat of Mars
that Martian bugs would be
adapted to," says Lederberg.
"With the limited weight we have
for the biology package, and the
limited options, it is a big
gamble."
He notes that there is no single,
unambiguous "life detector."
Tests based on what constitutes
life on earth may not hold true
for another planet.
As a result of technology
learned from the NASA missions,
Stanford has furthered medical
research. SUMEX, a nationally
shared facility for medical
research, is an example. Its
purpose is to employ the
computer to reach decisions and
solve medical research problems
by symbolic analysis.
Other instruments are being
used in analyzing unknown
organic compounds, or

determining molecular structure,
with applications in treating
infectious diseases.
Another instrument which
came from NASA work is the cell
separator. Developed by Dr.
Leonard Herzenberg of the
Genetics Department, it is aiding
the study of the body's immune
system and helping determine the
chemical and biological
characteristics of different cells.
This could lead to possible
prevention of organ transplant
rejection, and more effective
treatment of diseases such as
leukemia and hemophilia.
