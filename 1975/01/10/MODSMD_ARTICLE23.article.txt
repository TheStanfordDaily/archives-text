# Demos Aim For 'Unity, Hope'

### WILLIAM ROSS 
The affirmative action rules
adopted at last month's
Democratic national convention
in Kansas City will greatly
encourage minority participation
in the political process, Santa
Clara's County's three delegates
agree.
But although the delegates
consistently voted together at the
convention, they returned home
with differing reactions to the
events at the gathering.
William Gould, a Stanford Law
professor,and Joshua Goldstein, a
political science researcher,
expressed disappointment that the
convention's affirmative action
ruling wasn't worded more
strongly. Thomas Skornia, a Palo
Alto attorney, emphasized that
the measure was the best that
could have been expected.
Gould explained that he is
pleased that the convention voted
to force the burden of proof
regarding racial discrimination
onto the offending party, but is
disappointed that the convention
forbade the use of statistics to
prove the existence of
discrimination in delegations to
future conventions.
Minority Representation
According to Gould, the
convention stopped short of
setting quotas for minority groups
but set up rigorous standards for
the composition of future
convention delegations in order to
ensure strong minority
representation.
Skornia called the affirmative
action ruling "the best
compromise that could have come
out of a gathering of people so
diverse in outlook." He added
that it was only hard work and
"skillful brinkmanship by
minorities" that brought about
such a rigorous affirmative action
measure.

All three delegates circulated a
petition calling for expansion of
the caucus system of choosing
convention delegates. They
blamed its failure on what they
termed the manipulation of the
convention by Democratic
National Chairman Robert
Strauss.
Their measure proposed that at
least three-fourths of all
convention delegates be selected
at local caucuses such as the one
at which they themselves were
chosen in November.
Act Like Sheep
Gould, Goldstein and Skornia
were given only 24 hours to
collect 200 signatures. They
collected 175, so their measure
failed to reach the convention
floor.
Complaining that the National
Committee discouraged proposals
with which Strauss disagreed,
Gould said that the convention
was designed to get us to act like
sheep. Most issues that didn't have
Strauss' support failed. Many
events were well orchestrated.
Skornia said he could
understand why the convention's
leaders didn't want to burden the
schedule with too many issues,
but said that the method for
introducing new proposals should
have been made at least somewhat
easier.

The three delegates praised the
convention for establishing a
judicial council to enforce
affirmative action rules for
minorities. But they complained
that the council, appointed by a
majority vote of the national
committee, may prove insensitive
to minority needs. They all
supported a losing proposal to
make a two-thirds vote necessary
for appointment to the
committee.
Superficial Unity
Goldstein said that Strauss
spent too much time telling the
convention delegates to work
together in future months to
create the kind of unity necessary
to capture the White House in
1976.
"I don't believe in compromise
if it means sacrificing one's
principles," Goldstein
commented.
He added that the delegates to
the convention exhibited
considerable unity, but that it
might be somewhat superficial.
The real inner-party divisions
won't manifest themselves until

the presidential nomination is at
stake.
But Skornia disagreed, claiming
that the party is likely to display
even greater unity in 1976.
"The unity was quite real; it
wasn't superficial," Skornia said.
They'll be more pressured for
unity in 1976 when we are faced
with the need to cooperate in
order to win elections. If the
party were going to split, last .
months convention would have
been the time."
Unity and Hope
Skornia forecast the emergence
of a new Democratic coalition
based on the power of blacks,
latinos and women.
Gould said there was much
"unity and hope" at the
convention, but said that the
party could find itself in trouble
in 1976 if no strong candidate
presents himself for the
nomination.
Gould, Skornia and Goldstein
all agreed that much presidential
politiking was conducted at the
convention.
