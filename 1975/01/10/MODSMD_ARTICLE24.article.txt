## Kind Of Blue Top Jazz Albums Of The Year Considered 
### Dave Smith 
Like every other art form in
America, jazz music can be a
matter of all style and no
substances: as soon as one
musician discovers a commercially
successful formula, other
performers, talented or not, join
in the rush to cash in on it.
As long as music is considered
just another thing to sell, record
companies will keep promoting
dull, compromising albums like
Billy Cobham's Total Eclipse and
keep encouraging talented
musicians like Cobham to make

their music more saleable at any
artistic cost.
It is highly refreshing, then,
that the sell-out is hardly a
universal jazz phenomenon; there
are still plenty of guitarists who
don't try to imitate John
McLaughlin and pianists who
don't feel compelled to take up
the synthesizer just because it's
the current fad.
Experiential Means
About the only way to
experience the creative jazzmen
"out there" is on records, since

many don't make concert tours.
Some of the best records of the
past year include the following,
listed in no particular order.
David Holland: Conference of
the Birds (ECM Records).
Virtuoso bassist Holland, best
known for his brilliant work with
Miles Davis, is joined by two rising
saxophone stars, Anthony
Braxton and Sam Rivers. Braxton,
who has also recorded a whole
record of alto sax solos, is one of
the few musicians whose sheer
originality alone is fascinating.

Gato Barbieri: Yesterdays
(Flying Dutchman). For those
who aren't familiar with Gato's
fusion of John Coltrane
inspired jazz and South American
music— this album is a fine
introduction. Tenor saxophonist
Barbieri's horn sings and screams
over a sympathetic rhythm
section which includes bassist Ron
Carter.
Four's A Charm
Weather Report: Mysterious
Traveler (Columbia). The fourth
album of Wayne Shorter, Joe
Zawinul and company is as good
as all the others: warm, vibrant,
pulsating, the finest electronic
music being made anywhere.
Dave Liebman: Lookout Farm
(ECM). Liebman, superb on
soprano and tenor saves and
flutes, plays everything from
electric rock to Spanish music on
his debut album. It all works fine,
with help from guitarist John
Abercrombie and strong
percussion by Charles Alias on
congas and Badal Roy on tablas.
McCoy Tyner: Sama Layuca
(Milestone). Since his days in the
early sixties as Coltrane's pianist,
Tyner has consistently been
among the vanguard of jazz
innovators, but as a piano stylist
and as a composer. Sama Layuca
could be the most perfectly
conceived album of the year. The
lush rhythmic texture of the
compositions forms a perfect base
for Tyner's percussive solos; Gary
Bartz's alto sax solo on "Paradox"
is one of the finest ever recorded.
Georgian Tribute
Marion Brown: Sweet Earth
Flying (Impulse). Brown's tribute
to his Georgia childhood is a work
of quiet, introspective beauty.
Brown, whose mentors include
Ornette Coleman and John
Coltrane, is heard here on alto and
soprano saxophones, with Paul
Bley and Muhal Richard Abrams

on keyboards, providing a
delicately interwoven background.
Keith Jarrett: Solo Concerts
(ECM). A three-record set that has
been widely (and deservedly)
praised as a masterpiece of piano
technique. Jarrett's skill at
improvisation and his wide range
of musical sources are remarkable.
Horacee Arnold: Tales of the
Exonerated Flea (Columbia) An
ensemble album, featuring many
fine solos by Art Webb on flute,
Ralph Towner and John
Abercrombie, guitars, and the
brilliant Sonny Fortune on
soprano sax. Jan Hammer's highly
musical playing on synthesizer
and Arnold's drumming also stand
out.

LATE NIGHT FACULTY POOL ACTIVITIES?—Nope, this is one of
approximately 600 original prints from woodcuts that is on exhibit at
Tresidder through Sunday. This particular woodcut by Aristide
Maillol sells for $12.
Like every other art form in
America, jazz music can be a
matter of all style and no
substances: as soon as one
musician discovers a commercially
successful formula, other
performers, talented or not, join
in the rush to cash in on it.
As long as music is considered
just another thing to sell, record
companies will keep promoting
dull, compromising albums like
Billy Cobham's Total Eclipse and
keep encouraging talented
musicians like Cobham to make

their music more saleable at any
artistic cost.
It is highly refreshing, then,
that the sell-out is hardly a
universal jazz phenomenon; there
are still plenty of guitarists who
don't try to imitate John
McLaughlin and pianists who
don't feel compelled to take up
the synthesizer just because it's
the current fad.
Experiential Means
About the only way to
experience the creative jazzmen
"out there" is on records, since

many don't make concert tours.
Some of the best records of the
past year include the following,
listed in no particular order.
David Holland: Conference of
the Birds (ECM Records).
Virtuoso bassist Holland, best
known for his brilliant work with
Miles Davis, is joined by two rising
saxophone stars, Anthony
Braxton and Sam Rivers. Braxton,
who has also recorded a whole
record of alto sax solos, is one of
the few musicians whose sheer
originality alone is fascinating.

Gato Barbieri: Yesterdays
(Flying Dutchman). For those
who aren't familiar with Gato's
fusion of John Coltrane
inspired jazz and South American
music— this album is a fine
introduction. Tenor saxophonist
Barbieri's horn sings and screams
over a sympathetic rhythm
section which includes bassist Ron
Carter.
Four's A Charm
Weather Report: Mysterious
Traveler (Columbia). The fourth
album of Wayne Shorter, Joe
Zawinul and company is as good
as all the others: warm, vibrant,
pulsating, the finest electronic
music being made anywhere.
Dave Liebman: Lookout Farm
(ECM). Liebman, superb on
soprano and tenor saves and
flutes, plays everything from
electric rock to Spanish music on
his debut album. It all works fine,
with help from guitarist John
Abercrombie and strong
percussion by Charles Alias on
congas and Badal Roy on tablas.
McCoy Tyner: Sama Layuca
(Milestone). Since his days in the
early sixties as Coltrane's pianist,
Tyner has consistently been
among the vanguard of jazz
innovators, but as a piano stylist
and as a composer. Sama Layuca
could be the most perfectly
conceived album of the year. The
lush rhythmic texture of the
compositions forms a perfect base
for Tyner's percussive solos; Gary
Bartz's alto sax solo on "Paradox"
is one of the finest ever recorded.
Georgian Tribute
Marion Brown: Sweet Earth
Flying (Impulse). Brown's tribute
to his Georgia childhood is a work
of quiet, introspective beauty.
Brown, whose mentors include
Ornette Coleman and John
Coltrane, is heard here on alto and
soprano saxophones, with Paul
Bley and Muhal Richard Abrams

on keyboards, providing a
delicately interwoven background.
Keith Jarrett: Solo Concerts
(ECM). A three-record set that has
been widely (and deservedly)
praised as a masterpiece of piano
technique. Jarrett's skill at
improvisation and his wide range
of musical sources are remarkable.
Horacee Arnold: Tales of the
Exonerated Flea (Columbia) An
ensemble album, featuring many
fine solos by Art Webb on flute,
Ralph Towner and John
Abercrombie, guitars, and the
brilliant Sonny Fortune on
soprano sax. Jan Hammer's highly
musical playing on synthesizer
and Arnold's drumming also stand
out.
