# Creative Duo To Appear Here
## 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
In 1974, the average American
produced 5.3 pounds of garbage
each day. This seems to be a lot,
but bear in mind that average
Americans in the White House and
the music industry pulled that
figure way up.
This last year won't be
remembered as a year of great
creative energies in the popular
music scene. Rolling Stone's end
of the year rock awards were
mostly digs and Esquire's "Heavy
100 of Rock," feature that has
run for five years failed to
materialize.
As the smoke cleared from the
autumn concerts of high-voltage
circus acts like Elton John, Deep
Purple and Lou Reed, the
survivors began to poke around in
the ashes for something to soothe
our sense and our sensibilities.
At one point, I was ushered off
to San Francisco in a clanging old
VW bus to hear, or rather,
experience Don and Pilar. Even
before the first song had ended, it
was clear to me that here, in a
small concert room, I was
enjoying an honest and vital
creative source Don and Pilar.
Theatrical Events
Don and Pilar are, on the
surface, singers who perform

original material while
accompahied by Paul Petzold, an
excellent pianist. Ultimately, their
shows are fully engaging theatrical
events.

Don and Pilar got together first
as members of the Gestalt Fool, a
S.F theatre group. As the group
began to dissipate, Don, who had
little musical training, began to
write songs.
Pilar, whose training is in music
especially flute wrote
harmonies and accompanied Don
as an experiment. The experiment
sounded good, so they decided to
try to find a job as a singing act.
For three years they have done
the bar scene. But their act
doesn't lend itself to bar scenes
very well. Their songs range from
outrageous social commentary
and comedy with stage-musical
vibrancy to deep, far-reaching
lyrical odes of passion. All of their
act requires devoted attention.
Recently, they auditioned at a
Palo Alto singles bar/restaurant.
The kind of place where corn-fed
young men off the commuter
have a couple drinks before dinner
and talk importantly about
themselves over the general din.
After a couple songs, no one
responded in any way to Don and

Pilar, except maybe by talking a
little louder. Don and Pilar had
just sung "Norma Jean," a
haunting ballad about Marilyn
Monroe.
Despite the current rumor that
Monroe may have been murdered,
the song is simple and moving. It
is the song of the defiant voice
behind suicide's veil.
"I'm Norma Jean the beauty
queen
and I'll run through the edges of
your dreams;
I'll be the legend of your wishing
screen
but I'll be damned if I'll let you
hear my screams."
Anyway, Pilar, who wears long,
lusty dark gowns, was the target
of a lot of flak from a tableful of
middle-aged executives,
hair-thinning stylishly. She
dedicated a song to them, a song
called "Let's Eat Out Often."
"This one," she said, "is right
up your alley." The audience
inevitably joins in on the chorus
of this rowdy song that is not
about trips to the Sizzler Steak
House.
"Let's eat out often
let's stay home and cook
tonight. . ."
Don and Pilar have been
playing successfully at the
Elysseum in Boulder Creek as well
as gaining popularity gradually
throughout the Bay Area.
Recently they have been putting
on small concerts. The small
concerts are a real bonus since
much of their theatrical influence,
a big part of their act, is lost in a
bar show.
Don and Pilar will perform
Sunday night, Jan. 12, at 8 p.m.
in the Tresidder Large Lounge.
This concert is sponsored by the
Bridge and there will be no
charge.
