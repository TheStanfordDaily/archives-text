# Journey Dazzles Once Again

### JOAN E. HINMAN 
DALY CITY-Leave it for The
Big City Reviewers to point out
the Bill Graham's New Year's
Even show at the Cow Palace
featured the Doobie Brothers, a
group scarcely up to the high
musical caliber that Graham has
billed to welcome other years.
The Dooßros fought their way
out of San Jose with a string of
albums led by a longer string of
AM hits, and the majority of the
New Year's crowd at the Cow
Palace paid their bread to hear
those AM hits played one right
after the other.
Whatever turns you on.. .
The Big City Reviewers
concluded that Bill Graham had
ripped-off The People by
headlining the likes of the
Dooßros, but the truth is that,
Dooßros aside, Graham presented
an astounding array of talent.
Journey, Bonaroo and
Yesterday and Today provided
the musical excellence and
ingenuity that the Dooßros
somehow lacked, and the crowd
was more than grateful.
Journey's Finest Set
What Billy Preston was to the
ill-fated George Harrison tour,
Journey was to the Graham New
Year's show. San Francisco's
premier band of 1974 played by
far their finest set to date, led by
the searing guitar of Neal Schon
and the brilliant drumming of
Aynsley Dunbar.
In previous appearances,
Dunbar has been the weak link in
Journey's sound, but he put it all
together to provide the tight

rhythmic framework for the New
Year's set.
It seemed impossible that Neal
Schon could improve his guitar
riffs, but his improvisations on
Journey's concert material
sparkled beyond his past best
efforts. His work on "Of A
Lifetime" was simply incredible,
bringing thunderous applause
from the crowd.
Gregg Rollie's voice and
keyboard work were, for the first
time in a large concert, clearly
audible above Dunbar and bassist
Ross Valory; and so Journey, the
Bay's best band, got their sound
balanced and their drums
synchronized and brought down
the house.
Bonaroo, the second band on

the program, offered a more
mellow sound than Journey, a
sound quite identifiably
influenced by the bands from
which Bonaroo has drawn
members Seals and Crofts, the
Boobie Brothers, Edgar Winter
Group, and the Steve Miller Band.
Bonaroo's vocal talent is
exceptional, featuring full
harmonies and rich solos. With
material that ranges from ballads
to heavy rock, Bonaroo draws
from diversified talents and styles
to give a fascinating concert set.
Yesterday and Today, yet
another local band, kicked off the
evening with a strong set which
was unfortunately plagued by the
idiosyncracies of the Doobie
Brothers sound equipment.

bringing thunderous applause
from the crowd.
Gregg Rollie's voice and
keyboard work were, for the first
time in a large concert, clearly
audible above Dunbar and bassist
Ross Valory; and so Journey, the
Bay's best band, got their sound
balanced and their drums
synchronized and brought down
the house.
Bonaroo, the second band on

the program, offered a more
mellow sound than Journey, a
sound quite identifiably
influenced by the bands from
which Bonaroo has drawn
members Seals and Crofts, the
Boobie Brothers, Edgar Winter
Group, and the Steve Miller Band.
Bonaroo's vocal talent is
exceptional, featuring full
harmonies and rich solos. With
material that ranges from ballads
to heavy rock, Bonaroo draws
from diversified talents and styles
to give a fascinating concert set.
Yesterday and Today, yet
another local band, kicked off the
evening with a strong set which
was unfortunately plagued by the
idiosyncracies of the Doobie
Brothers sound equipment.
DALY CITY-Leave it for The
Big City Reviewers to point out
the Bill Graham's New Year's
Even show at the Cow Palace
featured the Doobie Brothers, a
group scarcely up to the high
musical caliber that Graham has
billed to welcome other years.
The Dooßros fought their way
out of San Jose with a string of
albums led by a longer string of
AM hits, and the majority of the
New Year's crowd at the Cow
Palace paid their bread to hear
those AM hits played one right
after the other.
Whatever turns you on.. .
The Big City Reviewers
concluded that Bill Graham had
ripped-off The People by
headlining the likes of the
Dooßros, but the truth is that,
Dooßros aside, Graham presented
an astounding array of talent.
Journey, Bonaroo and
Yesterday and Today provided
the musical excellence and
ingenuity that the Dooßros
somehow lacked, and the crowd
was more than grateful.
Journey's Finest Set
What Billy Preston was to the
ill-fated George Harrison tour,
Journey was to the Graham New
Year's show. San Francisco's
premier band of 1974 played by
far their finest set to date, led by
the searing guitar of Neal Schon
and the brilliant drumming of
Aynsley Dunbar.
In previous appearances,
Dunbar has been the weak link in
Journey's sound, but he put it all
together to provide the tight

rhythmic framework for the New
Year's set.
It seemed impossible that Neal
Schon could improve his guitar
riffs, but his improvisations on
Journey's concert material
sparkled beyond his past best
efforts. His work on "Of A
Lifetime" was simply incredible,
bringing thunderous applause
from the crowd.
