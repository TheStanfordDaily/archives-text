# 'Dr. Rock' Kicks Off Black History Week
## 
### JUDY LITTLE 
Dr. Rock is known to his
friends and family as Eric Isralow,
but the general public is becoming
aware of him as a personage very
familiar with the History of Rock
'n Roll. He will complement his
title and his fame with three
performances of the History of
Rock 'n Roll at Stanford's Little
Theater, Jan. 10, 11 and 12 at 8
p.m. Dr. Rock's show is the first
presentation of the Committee on
Black Performing Arts' Black
History Week celebration.
The show elaborates the social,
cultural and historical development

of rock with a juxtaposition of
black and white music from the
mid-20th century to the present.
There are performances by black
and white Stanford students
showing differences in the musical
styles of the respective groups.
The History of Rock 'n Roll
evolves out of Dr. Rock's interest
in the reciprocity between music
and culture. From the time of his
adolescence in New York, Dr.
Rock has been aware that music
makes statements about the
people's consciousness. The music
of the 'sos, particularly rock 'n
roll, a music of alienation,
articulated many of Isralow's
feelings.
Dr. Rock considers himself a
social commentator and critic
who tries, through music, to
understand and evaluate what is
happening and what is going to
happen. He says, for example,
that the depression of the '3os
was predictable from the tenor of
the music with songs like "Brother
Can You Spare a Dime?" The
current economic, political and
social conditions, Isralow
contends, are evidenced in songs
like Billy Swans' "I Can Help."
The general tendency toward
nostalgia, the longing for the good
ol' days of the 'sos, is also
reflected in music and the revival
of songs from the 'sos era.
