The Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
Custom Fidelity, CF53657
What words do you associate
with the Stanford Band?
Obscene? Insane? Spontaneous?
Organic? Probably all of these.
And yet, you must also use the
word "musicians." With all the
hoopla surrounding the band, that
is a word that often gets lost or
subordinated to the others. But
this album, its third in the last five
years, proves that the band can
play music and play it well.
Although it lacks the presence
of a live performance except for
a brief shouting of "E—M—B—O"
during "Tell Mama" it certainly
is the closest thing to one that the
band has yet recorded.
Remembering that the last two
albums featured tinny recordings,
older songs and, in some cases,
off-beat tempos, this reviewer
recommends that if you must own
a Stanford Band Album, this is
the best.

In it, the band plays most of
the songs we all know and enjoy,
including: "Then Came You,"
"Feelin' Stronger Every Day,"
"Saturday Night's Alright For
Fighting" and "Everybody's
Everything," featuring a superb
drum performance. Laudits go to
the Red Vest Band (the smaller
activities band that plays for
basketball games) for their
renditions of "Just You and Me"
and "The William Tell Overture."
This album does not contain
every song the band plays well;
notably absent are "You Are The
Sunshine Of My Life" and the
band's theme song, "Alright
Now," which is on the previous
album but might also have been

appropriate here. No doubt there
I are others.
But the album is a
' conglomeration of rhythm that
will allow every student to
remember that, yes, pure fun is
also supposed to be part of a
Stanford education.

Yes ickick-k
Relayer
Atlantic 18122
Relayer is the latest album by
Yes. The first thing a veteran Yes
freak will notice is that it is only a
single record, with one song on

one side and two shorter (about 9
minute) songs on the other side,
sort of unambitious compared to
the 4-song, 4-sided Tales From
Topographic Oceans or the
3-record Yessongs. Ah, but the
music is the best I have heard this
side of Close to the Edge or The
Yes Album , and that is saying
quite a lot.
Side 1 is made up of a longish
piece, a la Tales, titled "The Gates
of Delerium," but sounds better
than any of the songs on Tales. It
is a masterfully crafted blend of
the dichotomous Stravinsky-like
cacophony and tender-but
piercing mellowness that comprise
much of Yes's unique sound. As
with much of their music, it can
sound pretty strange during the

first few listenings, especially one
portion which sounds like the
record is being speeded up.
However, after awhile it all falls
into place (especially after one has
realized that this is meant to be a
sound portrait of a battle).
On side 2, it is good to see Yes
going back to the shorter song
format, even if it only means two
nine-minute songs rather than one
18-minute song.
Opener
The side's opener, "Sound
Chaser," is the most exciting and
intriguing song on the album. It is
a good example of the changing
moods of a Yes song, shifting

effortlessly from the magical
opening jazz-styled riff to a
driving rocker, then to a superb
piece of guitar work by Steve
Howe that fades into a mellotron
segment of symphonic grandeur
which leads into a segment of
ultra tenderness that brings us
back to the opening riff, which
leads into a steaming ending
replete with double time coda and
a very strange chorus that sounds
like "Cha Cha Cha."

The final piece, "To Be Over!"
is one of the most beautiful
melodies Yes has ever recorded.
Most mellow Yes features Jon
Anderson singing to sparse
accompaniment, often only a
guitar, but "To Be Over" features
a full deliberate sound with group
vocals and superb guitar and
mellotron breaks. The middle has
a refreshingly funky guitar riff,
and the ending features a
beautiful interplay of two
separate themes.
Wakeman's Successor
Yes, of course, presents a new
keyboard man on this album,
Patrick Moraz, to replace Rick
Wakeman. Moraz certainly has big
shoes to fill, especially in concert,
where his £tage presence and
overall effectiveness did not come
close to that of Wakeman's in a
Chicago appearance on Dec. 16.
However, I have no complaints
about his performance on
Relayer, and, on record at least,
he should be able to fill
Wakeman's shoes. After all,
Wakeman was not very taxed by
his parts on Tales, seldom
bothering to use more than one
hand during live performances of
it. Even if it takes Moraz two
hands to play what Wakeman can
with one, he should be able to do
the job.
Overall, Relayer is a very
satisfying album. It is especially
refreshing to see Yes move ahead
and change their sound from what
it was on their earlier album of
1974. Tales From Topographic

Oceans.
Though also masterfully done,
Tales always left me somewhat
disturbed and vaguely unsatisfied.
Perhaps this is because it might
have reflected the internal
problems within the group, with
Wakeman pulling one way and the
other four members pulling the
other way.
With Relayer, Yes once more
has a unified overview. Though
this return was achieved only
through the loss of a master
keyboardman and dynamic
performer, in the end it may be
the best thing for the group.

Firesign Theatre -kickrk
Everything You Know Is Wrong
Columbia KC 33141
Strange things have been going
on in Curio, Arizona, where the
world is rapidly learning
everything you know is wrong.
Dr. Harry Cox exposes it all, with
the help of Art Wholeflaffer, Nino
Savatte and Gary the Seeker.

It's brought to you by Bear
Whiz Beer and Magog Brothers
Carpet Reclaimers among others,
but actually it's all thought up by
Philip Austin, Peter Bergman,
Davis Ossman and Philip Proctor.
These four certified crazies are
known to millions as the Firesign
Theatre, and Everything You
Know Is Wrong is their latest
album.
Aside from the very apt title,
the frolicsome foursome manages
to capture the insane, inane
essence of America in 1974 in
about 42 minutes of continuous
comedy.
There's less going on in the
background of the current album,
and the narrator, Dr. Harry Cox,
acts as editor as well, giving his
frame of reference to the entire
presentation. Cox is an Erik Con
Daniken type, who has assorted
theories about dogs that come
from the dog star, Indians that
can turn into animals and invent
the wire recorder and founding
fathers that took drugs.
Convincing Others
The Cox character has put
together the record in an attempt
to convince other seekers
("There's a seeker born every
minute!") that he's right.
As if anyone would need
convincing that everything you
know is wrong, by the time the
record is over the listener is
convinced that this album is one
of the Firesign's best and funniest.
If anyone needs further
convincing, Phil Proctor seems to
be in charge of that.
The Firesign Theatre, fans, is
branching out and diversifying. In
addition to eight albums, the
group has authored two books
and numerous radio shows. Each
member also has his own
individual projects.
Proctor is in charge of making
the potential audience aware of
what the Firesign Theatre is
doing, and in a telephone
conversation, he revealed a less
zany side of himself than he does

in a performance.
He explained that he had a lot
of respect for the various psychics
and para-psychological theories
and theorists that are parodied on
the album. "We parrot the form as
well as parody the content,"
Proctor said, which is one reason
why the albums are so funny yet
familiar.
It's easy to recognize Uri
Geller, Carlos Casteneda and
various flying saucer freaks, but
the funniest yet most strikingly
realistic parody of all is the Evel
Knevil character, Rebus Knebus,
who jumps to the center of the
earth in a large and strange hole
just outside Curio, Arizona.
Happy With Work
Obviously, Proctor was pleased
at the way the album captured the
atmosphere of the real jump at
Twin Falls, Idaho, although it was
recorded months before Knevil
actually made the abortive but
profitable leap. Proctor said this
sort of ability to capture the
essence of an event months before
it happens is "predictive writing,"
and the Firesign Theatre has done
it to a certain extent previously.
Never, though, has the Firesign
Theatre done an album that's as
straightforward and graspable as
this latest effort. Buy cutting
down on the double and triple
layers of sound and meaning, the
album is simplified without losing
any comic vitality, and is a good
starting point for anyone who is
unfamiliar with the group's
previous work.

Monk Montgomery ★★★
Reality
Phila. International KZ 33153
Fender bass player Monk
Montgomery is the newest
addition to the Philadelphia
International label's impressive
soul congreagation, and while his
new Reality doesn't provide too
much raw excitement, it is a
well-conceived and well-played
collection of mellow soul.

Monk plays the lead on all the
tunes with his soft but agile bass,
gliding through numbers like "Me
and Mrs. Jones" and the title
track, which features a female
chorus for added color. He
receives some fine instrumental
help throughout from
pianist-producer Bobby Martin
and organist Ron Feuer, whose
"Little C's" is the prettiest tune
on the album.
Nothing here is really jazz,
with the possible exception of
Monk's only composition, "Close
Your Face," an electric funk piece
styled after Herbie Hancock's
recent releases. Certainly Monk is
not the important musician his
late guitarist brother Wes was, but
that hasn't prevented him from
turning out a very pleasant album.

Helen Reddy***
Free and Easy
Capitol ST-11348

Hollywood's Walk of Fame
recently added a new (cement)
star . . . Helen Reddy. The top
female vocalist of 1973 has made
herself another hit single, "Angie
Baby" which is included in her
newest album, Free and Easy.
The album title depicts a new
life style for Reddy, as well as a
new dimenstion in her singing.
Free and Easy is clearly atypical
of her five previous albums. She
has a whole new staff of writers,
including Alan O'Day (composer
of her hit single), Tom Hans (who
has a new single of his own in the
top 30 market) and Dennis Tracy
(with a rag rendition of
"Showbiz").
Her usual writers pitch in for
three songs on the album,
including a somewhat nebbish
piece by Don McLean entitled
"You Have Lived" and a much
more moving creation by Paul
Williams and Yen Asher called
"Loneliness." A final ounce of
help comes from her good friend
Peter Allen, who often

accompanies Reddy on tours. He
lends musical score to "I Think
I'll Write a Song" a lively one,
indeed!
The difference in this album
compared to all the rest is that the
music has funkier rhythms and
the lyrics are more natural and
colorful. Reddy demonstrates a
less dramatic attempt to maintain
what Alice Cooper labeled as the
"heavy metal housework rock."
Her tones are softer, warmer and
more emotional; far removed
from the cold, calculated cry of "I
Am Woman."
The themes naturally aid in the
tonal transformation, however,
it's still surprising to find Reddy
so adaptable to new dimensions in
vocals. In "Free and Easy" she
proves herself to the non-libbers
as well as the rest of her
surmountable fans. So, it's
suggestable to check this alubm
out, even if her "norm" doesn't
appeal to you. The difference is
that great.

FIVE STARS WITHOUT HIM-Although Rick Wakeman, above, left
Yes without a superstar keyboard man, their new album doesn't
suffer. Adequately picking up the keyboard chores is Patrick Moraz.
Wakeman left the popular group to pursue his own musical interests.

EAST MICHIGAN BUFFALO ORPHANAGE—Pictured above is the Band during one of its recording
sessions for its new album now available at the Bookstore. Considered by some to be the band's best
album ever, the record includes such hits as "The William Tell Overture," and "Tell Mama."
