# Disaster Predictions Questioned
## Panel Explores Media Overplay 
### RICHARD FEARON 
"I was totally astonished by the
number of disasters predicted" in
newspapers and on television, Hans
Mark, director of the NASA-Ames
Research Center, commented last
' night.
Speaking to fewer than 100 persons
in Bishop Auditorium, Mark said he
conducted a small personal survey to
determine how frequently predictions
of disasters appear in the news media.
Also appearing on the program with
Mark were Genetics Prof. Joshua
' Lederberg, Economics Prof. Joseph
Stiglitz and Communication Prof.
William Rivers.
Dealing with the communications
aspect of the issue, Rivers explained
that many journalists do not have a
firm background in science and so lack
the ability to judge the merits of
scientific issues. This, along with the
"filtering" results of the editorial
screening process, may be responsible
for some of the distorted stories that
appear, he indicated.
Merited
> Lederberg, noting that in some
cases these "disaster" warnings are
merited, expressed "concern
that. .. we'll end up looking for a few
scapegoats and not do a very good job.
To suggest that there is no reality at all

behind these concerns" is misleading.
He noted, for example, that recent
warnings about the harms of chlorine
in public water systems may not be so
unwarranted, because a comprehensive
survey of chlorine's effects has yet to
be undertaken.
Stiglitz emphasized that a large part
of the problem is a "question of

whether the experts are really
experts." Because of a lack of
understanding of statistical procedures
and other lack of technical
understanding, he feels that most
citizens find it very difficult to
evaluate expertise.
Common Sense
As a personal conviction, Mark
advocated that people need to "ask
some questions that common sense
dictate. I think that we need to have
some ground rules for judging whether
an expert is to be believed.
"Whenever we listen to an expert,
we should try to judge him as a man
you need to make up your mind on
the grounds of your own good
judgment as an individual. Take with
some grain of salt what experts say."
Addressing himself to the question
of enacting regulations to remedy
some of the problems brought up in
such disaster articles, Stiglitz said that
"I think that we need to separate out
the problems of investigation from
regulation. We need to obtain more
information about the reasonableness
of the hazard."
Whatever information is uncovered,
Stiglitz harbored some misgivings in
using regulations to solve the
problems, as many articles seem to
suggest.

experts." Because of a lack of
understanding of statistical procedures
and other lack of technical
understanding, he feels that most
citizens find it very difficult to
evaluate expertise.
Common Sense
As a personal conviction, Mark
advocated that people need to "ask
some questions that common sense
dictate. I think that we need to have
some ground rules for judging whether
an expert is to be believed.
"Whenever we listen to an expert,
we should try to judge him as a man
you need to make up your mind on
the grounds of your own good
judgment as an individual. Take with
some grain of salt what experts say."
Addressing himself to the question
of enacting regulations to remedy
some of the problems brought up in
such disaster articles, Stiglitz said that
"I think that we need to separate out
the problems of investigation from
regulation. We need to obtain more
information about the reasonableness
of the hazard."
Whatever information is uncovered,
Stiglitz harbored some misgivings in
using regulations to solve the
problems, as many articles seem to
suggest.

"I was totally astonished by the
number of disasters predicted" in
newspapers and on television, Hans
Mark, director of the NASA-Ames
Research Center, commented last
' night.
Speaking to fewer than 100 persons
in Bishop Auditorium, Mark said he
conducted a small personal survey to
determine how frequently predictions
of disasters appear in the news media.
Also appearing on the program with
Mark were Genetics Prof. Joshua
' Lederberg, Economics Prof. Joseph
Stiglitz and Communication Prof.
William Rivers.
Dealing with the communications
aspect of the issue, Rivers explained
that many journalists do not have a
firm background in science and so lack
the ability to judge the merits of
scientific issues. This, along with the
"filtering" results of the editorial
screening process, may be responsible
for some of the distorted stories that
appear, he indicated.
Merited
> Lederberg, noting that in some
cases these "disaster" warnings are
merited, expressed "concern
that. .. we'll end up looking for a few
scapegoats and not do a very good job.
To suggest that there is no reality at all

behind these concerns" is misleading.
He noted, for example, that recent
warnings about the harms of chlorine
in public water systems may not be so
unwarranted, because a comprehensive
survey of chlorine's effects has yet to
be undertaken.
Stiglitz emphasized that a large part
of the problem is a "question of

whether the experts are really
experts." Because of a lack of
understanding of statistical procedures
and other lack of technical
understanding, he feels that most
citizens find it very difficult to
evaluate expertise.
