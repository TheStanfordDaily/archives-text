## Pac-8 Basketball: Not A Weak Team In The Loop 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Here are some facts for Pacific Eight
basketball coaches to digest before the
conference begins its first weekend of
blood-letting:
The Pac-B's intersectional record during
preseason play was 63-16 for a winning
percentage of 79.7, best in the league's
history. Pac-8 teams have won five
tournaments, and eight opponents have been
knocked from the undefeated ranks by a
Pac-8 team. Three of the eight conference
teams are currently ranked in the top 10 by
both wire services, and the Associated Press
lists six Pac-8 teams either in the top 20 or
"receiving votes."
Those facts have all been neatly
summarized by USC coach Bob Boyd. "There
are truly no weak teams in the conference,"
Boyd said. "The thing that makes the league
so difficult is that for the first time in my nine
years as USC coach every team is capable of
winning a key game. In the past there were
always teams that couldn't beat the top
ones."
So who's going to emerge as champion?
Boyd's thoughts changed in midsentence.
"We're in good position to be one of the
contenders, but UCLA is again the team fo
beat, however, both off their unbeaten record
so far and their status as [eight-time]
defending champions. And don't forget
Oregon, which is 9-0. In fact, don't forget
anybody."
In football, seven conference teams are
automatically forgotten at the conclusion of
the regular season, but the 1975 basketball
season offers the opportunity for as many as
four conference teams to advance to
post-season tournaments. The league
champion qualifies for the NCAA's, and the
runner-up is eligible for an at-large invitation
to the nationals. One conference team will

definitely participate in the Commissioner's
Cuptourney, and another squad would be
eligible for an invitation to the NIT in New
York.
Here is a look at the teams vying for those'
various honors, listed in alphabetical order.
For more subjective rankings by the Daily's
basketball writers, see inset.
CALIFORNIA— The Bears have played a
questionable early-season schedule, and are
still a mystery team despite their 7-2 record.
Rickie Hawthorne is averaging 17.3 points per
game and junior college transfers Connie
White (15.8 points) and Jay Young (9.8
rebounds) are solid performers, but any team
that beats Arizona one night and loses to Old
Dominion the next has to be analyzed with
skepticism.
Cal is the coldest shooting team in the
league (42.6 percent), and hasn't been a
conference contender for a long time. Still,
coach Dick Edwards has a balanced scoring
attack and a fairly deep bench.
OREGON— The cover of last year's
Oregon press book was a picture of all five
Duck players diving for a loose ball. It was the
epitome of "Kamikaze Basketball," a style of
play taught with great intensity and little
regard for humanity by fiery coach Dick
Harter.

But no one can argue that Harter's tactics
aren't effective; as of this moment Oregon is
9-0 and ranked seventh nationally by United
Press International. Harter has several
adequate players, one excellent player (Greg
Ballard) and junior guard Ron Lee,
unquestionably the most talented amateur
performer west of David Thompson.
Lee is in the midst of a shooting slump
(37.6 percent), but each game he comes up
with a move nobody's ever seen before. His
mere presence makes Oregon a title
contender.
OREGON STATE— Last year Oregon State
was young and inconsistent, and this season
the Beavers are a little older and still
inconsistent. OSU is 8-5 at this point, thanks
largely to the efforts of Lonnie Shelton, a
6-foot-8, 235-pound mass of humanity
averaging 18.1 points, 10.1 rebounds and
about 23 evil stares per game.
Guards George Tucker and Charlie Neal
start in the backcourt, while Don Smith and
Paul Miller flank Shelton on the front line.
"We have a little more quickness and speed
than last year," said coach Ralph Miller,
whose Beavers played a patsy early schedule.
SOUTHERN CAL-The Trojans won 24
games last season, but most fans only
remember USC's first-half performance

against UCLA, which was about as bungling as
James McCord's efforts at the Watergate
Hotel. Inconsistency has plagued the Trojans
in the past, and USC must avoid similar
problems to win the title this year.
The Trojans, fifth-ranked nationally, have
averaged 93.1 points per game while
compiling a 10-1 preseason record. All five
starters Gus Williams, Biff Burrell, Clint
Chapman, John Lambert and Bob Trowbridge
are scoring in double figures.
STANFORD— The Cardinals have proven
over the last two years that they can challenge
the best teams in the nation, but Stanford has
yet to show that it can win consistently
against the nation's worst.
Two-time All-Conference center Rich
Kelley joins Ed Schweitzer and Scott Trobbe
on one of the league's best front lines, but
Stanford's guards haven't been able to carry
their weight offensively.
If Melvin Arterberry, Mark Gilberg, Mike
Bratz or Jay Carter can begin contributing to
the offense, Stanford can compete. If not, it
will be another long season for Howie Dallmar
and the Cardinals.
UCLA— Bruin coach John Wooden says he
has more fun coaching young, unproven
teams, so this season should be enjoyable for
the Wizard of Westwood. There is no Lew
Alcindor, Sidney Wicks or Bill Walton to
intimidate opponents, and most names on the
Bruin roster are relatively obscure. "Still," a
* Sports Illustrated writer observed, "UCLA is
UCLA. That might be enough."
It's unclear whether Bruin tradition or
Bruin talent was responsible for the first 10
UCLA wins (including impressive triumphs
over Notre Dame and Maryland), but it seems
obvious that the Bruins have plenty of both.
Versatile forward Dave Meyers was brilliant
against Maryland, and he's averaging 17.5
points per game.

Ralph Drollinger has performed adequately
if not spectacularly at center, and Rich
Washington, Marques Johnson, Jim Spillane,
Andre McCarter and even Pete Trgovich have
contributed to the balanced Bruin attack.
UCLA is quick and has the best bench in the
conference. And oh yes, the team happens to
be fairly well-coached.
WASHINGTON— Veteran coach Marv
Harshman has been starting a giant front line,
with either 6-101/2 Lars Hansen or 6-11 James
Edwards at center, and 6-7 Larry Pounds and
6-9 Larry Jackson at the forward spots.
But the key to Husky success so far is 6-4
guard Clarence Ramsey, scoring at a 17.9 clip.
Jackson and Hansen are also in double figures,
but Pounds, a second team All-League
selection last year, has been struggling thus
far, scoring only 8.8 a game.
"Larry's the heart of our ballclub,"
Harshman said at the start of the season, and
unless the heart starts beating at last year's
rate, Washington's 9-2 record won't hold up in
Pac-8 play.
WASHINGTON STATE-The big man on
the Pullman campus literally is 6-I IV2,
246-pound sophomore center Steve Puidokas,
who leads Pac-8 scorers with a 25.4 average.
He's also second to Kelley in rebounding with
an 11.8 mark, and even ranks fourth in free
throw percentage.
George Raveling, a one-man publicity
office who doubles as Cougar head coach, says
his staff "spent four days this fall locked up in
a room evaluating our film from last year and
deciding what adjustments we needed to make
for the coming season." »
Raveling came up with what he calls
"ambush strategy," designed to take
advantage of his contention that "no team in
the conference has better overall speed than
us."

BACK IN ACTION Melvin Arterberry, shown driving against LSU
in this season's opener, will be in the lineup and guarding Ronny
Lee—when Stanford's basketball team opens Pac-8 action at Oregon
tonight. Arterberry has missed the last five games due to an eligibility
mix-up.
