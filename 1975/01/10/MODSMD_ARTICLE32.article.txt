# Cards Face Oregon Fans

### VLAE KERSHNER 
It's very probable, or at least likely, that
Stanford will play its best basketball of the season
tonight and tomorrow at Oregon and Oregon State.
Why? Well, for one thing, Melvin Arterberry will
be back in the lineup, and both he and Rich Kelley
are in good health, for the first time this season.
For another, Stanford's grueling on-the-road
non-league schedule was tailor-made to prepare a
team for these two tough league openers in hostile
territory.

But, regardless of how well the Cardinals play, it
just might not be good enough tonight. More likely
is a semi-repeat of last season's game at Eugene.
Then, the Cardinals split the nets with a .683

shooting percentage, highest in Mac Arthur Court
history, but still lost, 72-71, on a last-second
30-footer by superduck Ron Lee.
The loss can be attributed to factors such as
referees intimidated by the Mac Court crazies. Both
Rich Kelley and Tim Patterson fouled out of that
game somewhat earlier than they would have if the
game was videotaped and sent to officiating school.
Anyhow, this season the seventh-ranked Ducks
are even better and the Cardinals will need to be
almost superhuman to win.
Tomorrow night, the outlook is brighter. Fans in
Corvallis, scenic location of Oregon State, are much
calmer than their Eugene counterparts. They're
only maybe three times as loud as Stanford rooters.
And OSU doesn't quite have the team Oregon
does. The Beavers (8-5) are owners of a four-game
loss streak against unformidable competition. For
example, they lost 75-74 to Nevada-Reno, a team
which Stanford beat 90-70.
The battle between Lonnie Shelton and Rich
Kelley should be a hard-fought, physical one that
will provide a clue to how well Kelley will do
against the heavies of the NBA.
Despite some problems, the Beavers should be
rated no more than a slight underdog. They did,
after all, defeat UCLA In Corvallis last season.
