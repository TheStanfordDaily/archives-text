# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Making basketball
predictions isn't eactly our
fearful forecasters forte, so
we're sufficiently fearful going
into this first week of Pacific
Eight play.
Our final football
percentage was around .750, so
we'll use that figure as the
break-even point to determine
whether our forecaster should
be given a raise or sent back to
Siberia (on this paper, the news
department).
Here goes. Both Stanford
and Cat, teams with different
talent but similar overall
ability, face the howling hordes
of Oregon tonight and
tomorrow night.
Neither Oregon nor Oregon
State's lineup looks
unbeatable. But the Ducks'
home-court advantage ought to
prevail, whereas the Beavers

don't have enough talent to
win.
The other games are down
in L.A. We won't predict the
Washington-UCLA game which
took place last night, though
that would be a sure-fire
method of improving our final
record. Tomorrow night's
UCLA- Washington State
meetihg doesn't look
particularly exciting, either.
USC also ought to get by
WSU fairly easily tonight, but
then faces a tough time with
Washington tomorrow. But the
Trojans have enough offense to
prevail.
