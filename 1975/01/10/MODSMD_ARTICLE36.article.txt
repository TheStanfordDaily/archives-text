# Gymnasts' First Foes USC, Cal
## 
### 
All-round Ail-American Steve
Hug isn't around at all anymore,
but Stanford should still have an
exciting gymnastics team.
Coach Sadao Hamada, though
minus his graduated superstar,
thinks that Stanford may be
stronger this year than last
because of more depth. Fans will
get an opportunity to see if this is
true tonight at 7:30 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion, when the
gymnasts begin their season
against perennial power Cal and
use.
The individual star of this
year's team will probably be
defending NCAA side horse
champion Ted Marcy. "No one
can come close to Ted's
performance on the side horse,"
Hamada says.
Marcy is joined by four other
lettermen: all-around competitors
Bob Anderson, Leo Holberg and
Hector Neff, as well as Bill
Madsen, who specializes in floor
exercise.
Another top point-getter
should be freshman Bobby Farb,
who won the New York State
High School all-around
championship last season.
Tonight's tentative lineup is as
follows: All-around, Neff, Holberg
and Farb; floor exercise, Madsen,
Anderson; side horse, Marcy,
Anderson; rings, Mike Tanaka;
vaulting, Todd Hutcheon, Ken
Gorman or A1 Nemcek; parallel
bars, Anderson, Tanaka; high bar,
Anderson, Tanaka.
