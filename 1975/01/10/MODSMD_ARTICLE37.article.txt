# Ruggers Favored In Opener
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Although Stanford rugby
coach Pete Kmetovic says
v tomorrow's 1:30 p.m. opener
against St. Mary's on Harry
Maloney field won't be an
exhibition match, it shouldn't be
a contest that will leave the rugger
huggers hugging each other.
The small Catholic institution
located in Moraga is hardly a
rugby power; hell, it's hardly any
kind of power. St. Mary's has
been playing the role of opening
round fall guy to the Cards for 10
years. The last time they beat
Stanford was 1970.
Last year, the Cards had little
trouble disposing of St. Mary's in
the opener, 14-0, on a field that
should have been auctioned off as
Bay Area marsh land.
St. Mary's lost both its games
in the Stanford 10-a-side
\ tournament last month, losing in
the first round to San Jose State
6-0 and to the XO's by a 10-0
count in the second round. But,
although Kmetovic is predicting a
win in the opener, he isn't
chalking it up, either.
"St. Mary's isn't a power, but
they usually have at least one big
man and a really fast guy. They
usually give us a good game."
O.K. But the postgame party still
figures to be more exciting than
the scrum.
Reunion
Kmetovic didn't get a chance
5 to see his team compete in the
10-a-side tournament becuase he
was too busy running the 57-team
event, so this week has been

somewhat of a reunion for him, as
he prepares the ruggers for the
opener.
"We've had over 50 players out
for the first couple of days and
we've gotten in some real good
days of practice," Kmetovic said.
Junior fullback Rich McDonald
has been a surprise on the practice
fields, filling the shoes of the
departed Eric Test, who is now
playing his rugby for the
BATS.
A trouble spot for the Cards
last season was the kicking
position, as Kmetovic spent the
entire season searching for a
booter. Chris Speiller finally won
the job at the end of the season
for the Monterey Tournament,
but he'll have to prove himself
again in the early going. Kmetovic
will look at Speiller, captain
Lawry Lieberman and Bob
Hertenstein and go with "whoever
has the hot day."
Tough Schedule
The Cards will be hoping to
improve upon last year's 7-3-1
record, but the schedule won't be
any help to the Cards. Stanford
will face five of the top rugby
powers in the country (for rugby
the country is California) the
BATS, USC, UCLA, the Santa
Monica Rugby Club and
California. But they do have one

i advantage, since they play
everyone except USC at home.
Last year, the Stanford scrum
; resembled the football Cards,
starring such familiar names as
Test, Gordy Riegel and John
Snider, all since graduated.
And rugby will have the same
flavor again this year as linebacker
Geb Church steps into the second
line along with defensive tackle A1
Ten√üruggencate, who'll be a prop,
and former defensive back Charles
i McCloud, who is now attending
; Business School.
The Cards will again use
Kmetovic's fast break offense.
"We'll play a wide open game on
offense, but our defense will have
; to improve," Kmetovic said.
