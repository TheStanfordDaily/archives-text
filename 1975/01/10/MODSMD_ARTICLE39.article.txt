# Swim Team Team Hosts Relays
## Now It's Aloha To The Season 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The Stanford swim team,
properly trained and tanned after
a two-week stay in Hawaii, moves
into action today in the 14th
Annual Stanford Relays.
The meet, which gets
underway at 2:30 p.m., features a
talented array of swimmers from
the Canadian National Team,
Chico St., the 1974 NCAA
Division 2 Champions, Cal,
UOP, the Santa Clara Swim Club
and Pennsylvania's Suburban
Swim Club.
Stanford enters the meet as the
definite favorite, although the
Cards will be hampered by the
loss of distance-man Steve Strong
(mononucleosis) and sprinter
Jphn Powell (broken leg). The
Cards are also naturally looking
forward to their big dual meet
with Washington next Friday in
Seattle.
The swimmers overcame the
burden of an interrupted workout
schedule caused by the Christmas
break by traveling to Hawaii for
two weeks of practice in the warm
climate.
"We've done this about every
other year since 1973," says
Gaughran, noting that many other
schools follow a similar course.
For example, Cal worked out all
vacation in San Diego, Indiana in
Florida and Utah in Hawaii.
Although the excursion to the
Islands (it is financed exclusively
by the swim team members, either
privately or through the sale of
seat-backs at the football games)
is intended as a means of
preparing for the season, the trip
naturally evolves into a pleasant
vacation.
The less-than-greuling schedule
included only a morning workout
(the team usually works out in
both the morning and afternoon),
leaving ample time for the
swimmers to enjoy such activities
as scuba diving, snorkeling, and
body-surfing (with Gaughran
leading the way at the famed
"Pipeline"). Needless to say,
Stanford's swimmers were
well-represented in Waikiki's
numerous nightclubs.
A highlight of the vacation
occurred in Maui, where the
swimmers feasted on their catch
of 15 lobsters.

the help of anyone interested in
timing for the meet would be
greatly appreciated.

with Washington next Friday in
Seattle.
The swimmers overcame the
burden of an interrupted workout
schedule caused by the Christmas
break by traveling to Hawaii for
two weeks of practice in the warm
climate.
"We've done this about every
other year since 1973," says
Gaughran, noting that many other
schools follow a similar course.
For example, Cal worked out all
vacation in San Diego, Indiana in
Florida and Utah in Hawaii.
Although the excursion to the
Islands (it is financed exclusively
by the swim team members, either
privately or through the sale of
seat-backs at the football games)
is intended as a means of
preparing for the season, the trip
naturally evolves into a pleasant
vacation.
The less-than-greuling schedule
included only a morning workout
(the team usually works out in
both the morning and afternoon),
leaving ample time for the
swimmers to enjoy such activities
as scuba diving, snorkeling, and
body-surfing (with Gaughran
leading the way at the famed
"Pipeline"). Needless to say,
Stanford's swimmers were
well-represented in Waikiki's
numerous nightclubs.
A highlight of the vacation
occurred in Maui, where the
swimmers feasted on their catch
of 15 lobsters.

Splashes: Gaughran says that
the help of anyone interested in
timing for the meet would be
greatly appreciated.

WANNA ARM WRESTLE? Senior Dean Anderson, a three-year letterman, returns for his final season,
beginning today. Asst. coach Jeff Hammett (left) is probably congratulating him for staying with it so long.
