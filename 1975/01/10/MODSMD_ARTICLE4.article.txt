# Research Group Claims Fraud In Auto Dealers' MPG Reports
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Consumers are being misled,
" confused or deceived about how much
gas mileage new 1975 cars will receive,
according to a study released
yesterday by Stanford Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG) director Jack
Handy.
The study, conducted by the
Northern California chapter of PIRG,
involved students from Stanford and
Santa Clara, who posed as prospective
car buyers.
These surveyors visited 50 dealers
and looked at 62 new cars during the

period of Nov. 1 through Nov. 7 last
year.
The results of their investigations
showed that some of the dealerships
quoted miles-per-gallon (mpg) for
highway driving exceeding California's
Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) data by as much as 85 percent.
For example, the survey said, a
NorCal PIRG surveyor visited Lutz
Ford in Palo Alto and was told that a
1975 Ford Granada with a 302 cubic
inch engine would get "18-26
miles-per-gallon for highway driving."
The corresponding EPA data

indicated only 14 mpg could be
expected.
The investigation showed that on
the average, the 48 dealers quoting
"city driving" mpg statistics quoted
figures 20.8 percent above the
California EPA city driving statistics
for the same car.
Similarly, the 49 dealers quoting
"highway driving" statistics quoted
mpg figures that averaged 10.5 percent
higher than the California EPA.
Only 14 percent, or seven of the 50
cars checked, had so far posted
California EPA gas mileage stickers in
voluntary cooperation with the
EPA/Federal Energy Administration
(FEA) program, PIRG investigators
found.
Salespeople admitted in about half
the surveyor visits that their mpg
claims were made without reference to
any standardized testing procedure
whatsoever, but were based on
"personal experience" or "what most
people told us they get."
Of 48 "city" quotations, half cited
a specific source for their
miles-per-gallon information such as
Consumer Reports, Motor Trend or
the EPA, the survey reported.
Although 16 specifically cited the
EPA test results as the basis for their
claim, only one correctly quoted the
EPA data.
Similarly, of 49 "highway"
quotations, 24 cited some source for
their data and 16 cited the EPA
directly. Only six of those referring to
the EPA quoted it correctly.
Salespersons claiming to quote EPA
statistics still quoted them
inaccurately in those four instances in
which the EPA miles-per-gallon sticker
was posted on the automobile right in
front of the salesperson, the PIRG
report said.
Lee Jones, NorCal PIRG's Projects
Director said. "If consumers want to
know what the comparative gas
mileage is between various car models,
they shouldn't ask a car salesperson.
"The information provided by
them is oft confusing, inaccurate and
misleading. It's difficult to say whether
or not salespeople are purposely
deceiving consumers by making such
claims, but the absence of such
regulations requiring uniform
quotation of standardized data
provides an opportunity for
deception," he said.
Late last November NorCal PIRG
Executive Director Roger Telschow
testified before the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) in Washington D.C.
and proposed exactly such a rule.
Telschow urged the FTC to adopt a
five-point plan including:

That the EPA's fuel economy
testing procedure and results be
accepted as a standard for purposes of
gas mileage comparisons between new
cars;
Mandatory posting of EPA gas
mileage stickers should be required on
all new cars at the point of display for
sale beginning in the 1976 model year.
These stickers should use only
statistics certified by the EPA;
The EPA "Gas Mileage Guide for
the New Car Buyer" should be
displayed in the showrooms of all car

dealers in such away that it will
provide easy reference for shoppers;
Any printed or electronic media
advertising that refers to fuel economy
must mention the EPA gas mileage
statistics, but cannot mention figures
or results from any other tests.
The FTC and the FEA should
conduct a widespread public education
program including public service
announcements and other publicity to
inform consumers and salespersons
about the existence and the use of the
EPA stickers.
