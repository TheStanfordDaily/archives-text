### PETE BHATIA 
Intercollegiate volleyball
returns to Stanford in a big way
Sunday when a team composed of
Stanford's best meets USVBA
national champion and NCAA
runnerup UC-Santa Barbara at
3:30 in Maples Pavilion.
The Stanford squad will be a
mixture of recent alums and
current members of the undergrad
volleyball team. Stanford will be
led by 1974 alumnus Jim lams, a
former volleyball All-American
and member of the United States
World team in 1974.
Also joining Stanford will be
Tom Krause, another grad and
member of the 1972 World team.
Undergrads for the Cards include
Willie Mannon, \ George McPheeters,
Richard Rand, Tom Duralde, Brad
Power, Bill Whiting and Mike
Watt.
The Gauchos have lost only

one player from their national
championship team of last year.
That was Dave DeGroot, who
received MVP honors at last
summer's nationals. However,
lams says, UCSB will be "just as
strong... if not stronger this
year."
The Gauchos top returning
player is Jon Roberts, a teammate
of lams' on the World team.
Roberts had the best hitting
percentage (kills per spike) on
that U.S. team this past summer.
UCSB is coached by first-year
mentor Gus Mea, who replaced
volleyball legend Rudy Sawara as
coach, when the latter decided to
return to the playing ranks this
fall.
While on paper Santa Barbara
figures to be the stronger squad.
McPheeters said "We vow we'll
beat them in five games ... may

be four if we are lucky."
Mannon said that even though
UCSB dumped Stanford in four
games last year the Cards should
do much better this year with the
addition of lams and Krause.
He said, "This will be the best
volleyball in terms of talent ever
at Stanford. Santa Barbara is the
best team anyone at Stanford
could ever hope to see. They have '
an amazing quick offense, and
their team defense and quickness
make it very difficult to put a hit
down."
The match is officially slated
to begin at 3:30, but will not
begin until the conclusion of the
Super Bowl. Admission is 50 cents
for students and children and $1
for adults.

be four if we are lucky."
Mannon said that even though
UCSB dumped Stanford in four
games last year the Cards should
do much better this year with the
addition of lams and Krause.
He said, "This will be the best
volleyball in terms of talent ever
at Stanford. Santa Barbara is the
best team anyone at Stanford
could ever hope to see. They have '
an amazing quick offense, and
their team defense and quickness
make it very difficult to put a hit
down."
The match is officially slated
to begin at 3:30, but will not
begin until the conclusion of the
Super Bowl. Admission is 50 cents
for students and children and $1
for adults.
