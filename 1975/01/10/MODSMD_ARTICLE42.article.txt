Ford Considers Tax Cut
WASHINGTON Administration sources reported
yesterday that President Ford is moving toward a proposed
$l5-billion income tax cut as a rapid way to strengthen the
purchasing power of Americans.
And in a Detroit speech, Treasury Secretary William E.
Simon said last night that the administration's new
economic program will be "guided by compassion and
understanding for those who have been hit the hardest by
our economic troubles."
Amid mounting pressure for a tax cut from key
congressional Democrats, several sources said that in White
House meetings some consideration has been given to
putting spendable cash in the hands of consumers by
returning money already withheld for income taxes.
Another possible way to implement the tax cut, they
said, would be by lowering the income tax withholding
rate.
Deadline Passes; No Oil Strike Called
DENVER The deadline for a strike against the
nation's oil companies passed last night with no word from
the man who had threatened to call the walkout.
Negotiations between the oil companies and 430 local
bargaining units continued around the country.
A.F. Grospiron, president of the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Worker Union, had threatened to call a strike at
5:30 p.m. PDT yesterday, but the deadline passed with no
word from Grospiron or the union.
Grospiron issued the ultimatum Wednesday night and
said he was giving the oil companies 24 hours to come up
with a better offer for the 60,000 oil workers represented
by the union.
Officials Question Illegal CIA Spying
WASHINGTON Information received by Justice
Department officials provides no indication that the CIA
conducted any spying within the United States, a former
assistant attorney general said yesterday.
Jerris Leonard, former assistant attorney general for civil
rights, acknowledged that the Justice Department gave the
CIA the names of American dissidents as potential targets
of surveillance on their trips abroad.
But, he added, "If the CIA was doing something on the
domestic side it was not getting to us."
Meanwhile, it was announced that former CIA Director
Richard Helms has agreed to undergo questioning Jan. 22
by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the
allegations that the CIA engaged in domestic spying during
his tenure. Helms' testimony will be in a closed hearing.
In another development, The Washington Post reported
last night that the CIA secretly read the mail of AFL-CIO
President George Meany and two senior international aides
during the 19505.
The tactic was undertaken to monitor the flow of covert
U.S. funds to anti-Communist trade unions in Europe, the
Post said.
Fighting Continues In Vietnam
SAIGON - Heavy fighting broke out 300 miles
northeast of Saigon yesterday as South Vietnamese forces
sought to block a North Vietnamese push into the rice-rich
Bong Son coastal plain, field officers said.

The Viet Cong charged that South Vietnamese planes
bombed their headquarters at Loc Ninh, 75 miles north of
Saigon, for the third straight day, causing heavy casualties
and destroying hundreds of homes, the town's market
place, the Catholic church and two pagodas. There was no
immediate comment from the Saigon command.
Meanwhile in Washington, the White House announced
that President Ford may seek more military aid for South
Vietnam and Cambodia.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron Nessen told newsmen
yesterday that the President finds aid to both countries
insufficient.
In response, Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield
of Montana vowed that Congress would resist any move to
increase aid to the countries, stating, "Additional aid means
more killing, more fighting. This has got to stop sometime."
France Revalues Gold Reserves
PARIS France revalued its gold reserves yesterday to
$170.40 an ounce, close to the free market price, in a move
designed to improve its credit abroad.
The increase gave France a paper profit of $12.32
billion.
Wednesday Algerian Finance Minister Ismail Mahroug
warned that oil producers might refuse to be paid in
currencies they consider to be devalued because of the hike
in the price of official gold.
There was no French reaction to the Algerian statement
but the government earlier took pains to assure some oil
producing countries that it was not trying to push the free
market value of gold upwards.
Arabs Buy U.S. Jets
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia In another escalation of the
Mideast arms buildup, Saudi Arabia announced yesterday
the purchase of $756 million worth of jet fighters from the
United States. Authoritative sources in Washington said
about 60 planes were involved and Saudi Arabia said the
jets "will consolidate the kingdom's ability to defend its
territory."
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, said the
desert kingdom is to get "several squadrons" of Northrop
FSE Tigers, a single-seater built primarily for export
Richardson: New British Ambassador
WASHINGTON President Ford yesterday named
former Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson Ambassador to Great
Britain.
Richardson's appointment is subject to Senate approval,
and if confirmed, he would replace Nixon confidant Walter
Annenberg.
Ford said Richardson's career has been "one of
extraordinary achievement," adding that he believed
Richardson would represent the U.S. "with the highest
distinction."
Richardson resigned his Justice Department post in
October 1973 rather than carry out then-President Richard
Nixon's order to fire Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox.

understanding for those who have been hit the hardest by
our economic troubles."
Amid mounting pressure for a tax cut from key
congressional Democrats, several sources said that in White
House meetings some consideration has been given to
putting spendable cash in the hands of consumers by
returning money already withheld for income taxes.
Another possible way to implement the tax cut, they
said, would be by lowering the income tax withholding
rate.
Deadline Passes; No Oil Strike Called
DENVER The deadline for a strike against the
nation's oil companies passed last night with no word from
the man who had threatened to call the walkout.
Negotiations between the oil companies and 430 local
bargaining units continued around the country.
A.F. Grospiron, president of the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Worker Union, had threatened to call a strike at
5:30 p.m. PDT yesterday, but the deadline passed with no
word from Grospiron or the union.
Grospiron issued the ultimatum Wednesday night and
said he was giving the oil companies 24 hours to come up
with a better offer for the 60,000 oil workers represented
by the union.
Officials Question Illegal CIA Spying
WASHINGTON Information received by Justice
Department officials provides no indication that the CIA
conducted any spying within the United States, a former
assistant attorney general said yesterday.
Jerris Leonard, former assistant attorney general for civil
rights, acknowledged that the Justice Department gave the
CIA the names of American dissidents as potential targets
of surveillance on their trips abroad.
But, he added, "If the CIA was doing something on the
domestic side it was not getting to us."
Meanwhile, it was announced that former CIA Director
Richard Helms has agreed to undergo questioning Jan. 22
by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the
allegations that the CIA engaged in domestic spying during
his tenure. Helms' testimony will be in a closed hearing.
In another development, The Washington Post reported
last night that the CIA secretly read the mail of AFL-CIO
President George Meany and two senior international aides
during the 19505.
The tactic was undertaken to monitor the flow of covert
U.S. funds to anti-Communist trade unions in Europe, the
Post said.
Fighting Continues In Vietnam
SAIGON - Heavy fighting broke out 300 miles
northeast of Saigon yesterday as South Vietnamese forces
sought to block a North Vietnamese push into the rice-rich
Bong Son coastal plain, field officers said.

The Viet Cong charged that South Vietnamese planes
bombed their headquarters at Loc Ninh, 75 miles north of
Saigon, for the third straight day, causing heavy casualties
and destroying hundreds of homes, the town's market
place, the Catholic church and two pagodas. There was no
immediate comment from the Saigon command.
Meanwhile in Washington, the White House announced
that President Ford may seek more military aid for South
Vietnam and Cambodia.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron Nessen told newsmen
yesterday that the President finds aid to both countries
insufficient.
In response, Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield
of Montana vowed that Congress would resist any move to
increase aid to the countries, stating, "Additional aid means
more killing, more fighting. This has got to stop sometime."
France Revalues Gold Reserves
PARIS France revalued its gold reserves yesterday to
$170.40 an ounce, close to the free market price, in a move
designed to improve its credit abroad.
The increase gave France a paper profit of $12.32
billion.
Wednesday Algerian Finance Minister Ismail Mahroug
warned that oil producers might refuse to be paid in
currencies they consider to be devalued because of the hike
in the price of official gold.
There was no French reaction to the Algerian statement
but the government earlier took pains to assure some oil
producing countries that it was not trying to push the free
market value of gold upwards.
Arabs Buy U.S. Jets
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia In another escalation of the
Mideast arms buildup, Saudi Arabia announced yesterday
the purchase of $756 million worth of jet fighters from the
United States. Authoritative sources in Washington said
about 60 planes were involved and Saudi Arabia said the
jets "will consolidate the kingdom's ability to defend its
territory."
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, said the
desert kingdom is to get "several squadrons" of Northrop
FSE Tigers, a single-seater built primarily for export
Richardson: New British Ambassador
WASHINGTON President Ford yesterday named
former Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson Ambassador to Great
Britain.
Richardson's appointment is subject to Senate approval,
and if confirmed, he would replace Nixon confidant Walter
Annenberg.
Ford said Richardson's career has been "one of
extraordinary achievement," adding that he believed
Richardson would represent the U.S. "with the highest
distinction."
Richardson resigned his Justice Department post in
October 1973 rather than carry out then-President Richard
Nixon's order to fire Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox.

Another possible way to implement the tax cut, they
said, would be by lowering the income tax withholding
rate.
Deadline Passes; No Oil Strike Called
DENVER The deadline for a strike against the
nation's oil companies passed last night with no word from
the man who had threatened to call the walkout.
Negotiations between the oil companies and 430 local
bargaining units continued around the country.
A.F. Grospiron, president of the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Worker Union, had threatened to call a strike at
5:30 p.m. PDT yesterday, but the deadline passed with no
word from Grospiron or the union.
Grospiron issued the ultimatum Wednesday night and
said he was giving the oil companies 24 hours to come up
with a better offer for the 60,000 oil workers represented
by the union.
Officials Question Illegal CIA Spying
WASHINGTON Information received by Justice
Department officials provides no indication that the CIA
conducted any spying within the United States, a former
assistant attorney general said yesterday.
Jerris Leonard, former assistant attorney general for civil
rights, acknowledged that the Justice Department gave the
CIA the names of American dissidents as potential targets
of surveillance on their trips abroad.
But, he added, "If the CIA was doing something on the
domestic side it was not getting to us."
Meanwhile, it was announced that former CIA Director
Richard Helms has agreed to undergo questioning Jan. 22
by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the
allegations that the CIA engaged in domestic spying during
his tenure. Helms' testimony will be in a closed hearing.
In another development, The Washington Post reported
last night that the CIA secretly read the mail of AFL-CIO
President George Meany and two senior international aides
during the 19505.
The tactic was undertaken to monitor the flow of covert
U.S. funds to anti-Communist trade unions in Europe, the
Post said.
Fighting Continues In Vietnam
SAIGON - Heavy fighting broke out 300 miles
northeast of Saigon yesterday as South Vietnamese forces
sought to block a North Vietnamese push into the rice-rich
Bong Son coastal plain, field officers said.

The Viet Cong charged that South Vietnamese planes
bombed their headquarters at Loc Ninh, 75 miles north of
Saigon, for the third straight day, causing heavy casualties
and destroying hundreds of homes, the town's market
place, the Catholic church and two pagodas. There was no
immediate comment from the Saigon command.
Meanwhile in Washington, the White House announced
that President Ford may seek more military aid for South
Vietnam and Cambodia.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron Nessen told newsmen
yesterday that the President finds aid to both countries
insufficient.
In response, Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield
of Montana vowed that Congress would resist any move to
increase aid to the countries, stating, "Additional aid means
more killing, more fighting. This has got to stop sometime."
France Revalues Gold Reserves
PARIS France revalued its gold reserves yesterday to
$170.40 an ounce, close to the free market price, in a move
designed to improve its credit abroad.
The increase gave France a paper profit of $12.32
billion.
Wednesday Algerian Finance Minister Ismail Mahroug
warned that oil producers might refuse to be paid in
currencies they consider to be devalued because of the hike
in the price of official gold.
There was no French reaction to the Algerian statement
but the government earlier took pains to assure some oil
producing countries that it was not trying to push the free
market value of gold upwards.
Arabs Buy U.S. Jets
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia In another escalation of the
Mideast arms buildup, Saudi Arabia announced yesterday
the purchase of $756 million worth of jet fighters from the
United States. Authoritative sources in Washington said
about 60 planes were involved and Saudi Arabia said the
jets "will consolidate the kingdom's ability to defend its
territory."
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, said the
desert kingdom is to get "several squadrons" of Northrop
FSE Tigers, a single-seater built primarily for export
Richardson: New British Ambassador
WASHINGTON President Ford yesterday named
former Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson Ambassador to Great
Britain.
Richardson's appointment is subject to Senate approval,
and if confirmed, he would replace Nixon confidant Walter
Annenberg.
Ford said Richardson's career has been "one of
extraordinary achievement," adding that he believed
Richardson would represent the U.S. "with the highest
distinction."
Richardson resigned his Justice Department post in
October 1973 rather than carry out then-President Richard
Nixon's order to fire Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox.
Today's Weather

Ford Considers Tax Cut
WASHINGTON Administration sources reported
yesterday that President Ford is moving toward a proposed
$l5-billion income tax cut as a rapid way to strengthen the
purchasing power of Americans.
And in a Detroit speech, Treasury Secretary William E.
Simon said last night that the administration's new
economic program will be "guided by compassion and
understanding for those who have been hit the hardest by
our economic troubles."
Amid mounting pressure for a tax cut from key
congressional Democrats, several sources said that in White
House meetings some consideration has been given to
putting spendable cash in the hands of consumers by
returning money already withheld for income taxes.
Another possible way to implement the tax cut, they
said, would be by lowering the income tax withholding
rate.
