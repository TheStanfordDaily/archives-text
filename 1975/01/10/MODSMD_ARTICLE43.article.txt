Goldstein To Speak
Joshua Goldstein, local delegate to
the Democratic Interim Convention
held last month in Kansas City, will
talk about what happened at the
meeting tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. in
the main lounge of Columbae.
CORRECTIONS
The Daily incorrectly reported
yesterday that the present University
distribution requirement is two
courses in each of three broad areas of
study. The requirement is actually
three courses.
Yesterday's article on the ASSU
Publications Board funding allocations
reported that if Live Oak ceases to
publish, materials purchased with Pub
Board funds would become property
of the board. Actually, all Live Oak
materials would become Pub Board
property if the newspaper ceased to
publish.
Due to a typographical error, the
first paragraph of yesterday's article
on Quad sales read: "With a Jan. 15
sales deadline quickly approaching for
the Quad, some of the staff's early fall
quarter optimism has not calmed
down to more realistic expectations
for this year." The word now was
intended instead of not.
