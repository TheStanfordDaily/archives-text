# Estimates Called 'Conservative'
## Senate Discusses Budget Cuts 
### JOHN FREED 
Anxious Faculty Senate members
received news yesterday that the
University's three-year $lO million
belt-tightening program is based on
conservative figures, and that major
cost-cutting decisions for 1974-75 will
probably be made within the month.
Members of the University Budget
Priorities Advisory Commission
dominated the quarter's first meeting,
explaining the process of budget
monitoring to the attentive senators.
Commission member Wolfgang
Panofsky explained why
commissioners felt that the $lO
million budget-cutting estimate was

probably low.
"The main thing we thought was
that inflation rate estimates were
conservative, and the other was that
some administrative cutbacks wouldn't
stick," said Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
Inflation was estimated at five to
six percent for the next three years
when the belt-tightening program was
revealed.
Commission Chairman Leon Seltzer
explained why major decisions for the
1974-75 budget must be made soon.
Extremely Critical
"The academic budget... has to be
approved formally by the Trustees in
March. So, I would say ... this next
month is extremely critical for the
exercises [of budget-cutting],"
Seltzer, director of the University
Press, noted.
"Certainly, by the end of February,
many decisions will have reached the
point that there's no turning back," he
added.
Seltzer assured the senators that the
commission served purely as a
monitoring advisory service, rather
than an administrative one.
"The commission is not in a
position to tinker with the
[budgeting] process," he declared.
"What we have, now, is a
decision-making process probably no
different from what we've always
had."
Commissioners have received wildly
varying suggestions on how to cut
costs here, according to Robert White,
an electrical engineering professor and
commission member.
"There are those who say that
Stanford should get out of
undergraduate education and
concentrate on graduate education;
there are others who say that our
troubles began by going into graduate
education .. . and we should stick to
undergraduate education," White said.
Responding to criticisms that no
black commissioners were appointed
and that the only woman appointed
was also the only undergraduate
named, White noted, "There are lots
of people who don't have a


Leon Seltzer
representative" on the commission.
"All of us certainly have some
built-in biases," he said, "but certainly
each of us is trying not to represent
some particular point of view."
Much Diversity
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs concurred.
"There are many types of diversity.
I think that the most important type
of diversity on a commission like this
should involve larger issues ... such as
the conflict between undergraduate
and graduate education," Gibbs said.
Other senators expressed concern
that faculty members would be
excluded from consideration when the
commission reports to President
Richard Lyman.
"The process . . . begins with the
faculty in the departments," Seltzer
claimed. "I don't see it as one that
excludes the faculty at any stage."
Human Biology Prof. Colin
Pittendrigh heatedly disputed Seltzer's
argument.
"The budgeting process ... ends
with the departments," he declared.
"Saying that the process begins with
the department faculty is an inversion
of the facts."
Seltzer concluded that there will be
no simple solutions to budgeting
problems facing the University.
"The chance of some miraculous
and happy solution appearing is just so
remote that it would be irresponsible
to hold that view," Seltzer charged.
