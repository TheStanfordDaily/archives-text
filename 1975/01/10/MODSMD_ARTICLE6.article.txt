# C-15 Schedules Meeting; No Decision Yet On CJP
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The Committee of Fifteen (C-15),
the panel charged with studying the
University judicial system for the last
three years, will meet for the first time
this quarter sometime next week,
Kathy Cunningham, one committee
member, disclosed yesterday.
Cunningham, a senior majoring in
Communication, said the committee
will meet to "finish up the hearing end
of our job," adding that the
committee's goal is to submit a report
to University President Richard
Lyman before the end of this quarter.
By that time, the committee will
decide either to support the current
judicial system, the Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) or propose a new system,
said Cunningham, the official
spokeswoman for the committee.
Composed of three students, three
faculty members and the faculty
chairman from the law school who
only votes in case of a tie, the CJP has
never received student approval.
'Closed Door' Policy
Early last quarter, the committee
voted to maintain a "closed door"
policy for meetings. At that time,

Cunningham became the
spokeswoman.
"The majority of the committee
felt that, for reasons of expediency,
and to make it easier to get the full
information from people testifying
before them, the meetings should be
closed," Cunningham explained.
She said that all meetings in the
past had been closed.
The C- 15, which consists of six
students, six faculty members and
three administrators, met five times
last quarter with former CJP members,
according to Cunningham.
Shared 'Experiences'
At two of these meetings, Law
Profs. John Kaplan, William Keogh
and William Cohen, all former CJP
chairmen, shared their "past
experiences" on the CJP, Cunningham
said.
"They told us what they thought
were the strengths and weaknesses of
the current system," she explained.
Kaplan, who advised Lyman when
the CJP was first designed about four
years ago, gave the committee
"specific historical background,"
Cunningham said.
Cunningham said she could not be
more specific about the statements,
because they had given the C-15 their
information confidentially.
Cunningham maintained, however,
that all the information the C-15
gathers will be made public
"eventually."
University Counsel John Schwartz
and University Legal Assistant Carole
Price, both prosecutors for the CJP
also spoke to the CJP on their "past
experiences," Cunningham said.
Others who spoke to the committee
last quarter include Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons; James Siena,
legal adviser to the president, and a
former faculty member of the CJP,
Aeronomics and Astronomies Prof.
Daniel Bershader.
Four Students
Only four former student CJP
members spoke at C- 15 meetings last
quarter, according to Cunningham.
She said, "The difficulty in getting
students was because so many have
graduated already, and the problem
with getting faculty was they were
usually too busy to make it at times
meetings were scheduled."
In fact, one C-15 member resigned
last November because she could not
make the meetings, Cunningham
added.
History Prof. Frederick Bowser
replaced English Prof. Anne Mellor on
the committee last November,
Cunningham said.
At the next meeting, the committee
will discuss letters from students who
went through CJP procedures.
Before the committee examines the
letters, Lyons will remove the names
of the students, Cunningham said.
Lyman reconvened the C- 15 this

year at the request of ASSU President
Mike Herman. Earlier, he expressed
doubt that a new proposal for a
different type of university judicial
system would be accepted by the
committee.
