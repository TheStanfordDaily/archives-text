# Vote For...Smith!
## 
### Art Conto 
Does your vote count
anymore?
Are you experiencing the
problem of picking "the lesser of
two evils?" Finding yourself not
wanting to vote either for the
Democrat or the Republican,
feeling that he or she does not
reflect your point of view or
cannot do the job or has a bad
record in office is this at least
unsatisfactory to you?
A lot of us are in that same
predicament. We want to be good
citizens, we want to vote ... but
for whom, when both opposing
candidates are unacceptable to us?
There is a solution. One so
simple that it has been ignored. It
costs you nothing. Yet it will give
you a voice an active voice
in government, be it local, state or
federal.
Still better, there is no axe to
grind, no special interest involved
here except your own whether
you are a Republican, a
Democrat, an independent or a
new voter. Because first you are a
citizen with your rights ... and
your duties.
Solution: Dissent
The solution is to dissent. To
disagree with the choice offered
you. For example, during the last
Presidential election did you want
either of the candidates, or did
you with a bothered conscience
vote "against" one of the men?
We must agree to disagree as
a group. Yet, without giving
anyone or any group or party
leverage that we are unwilling for
them to have. We don't want to
be ripped off anymore, by
political hacks or do-gooders or
even those who "believe" in
compromise.
What would happen if
everyone of us who finds himself
or herself in the "I don't want
either one" voting conflict wrote
in Joe Smith USA? All of us
writing on our ballot, Joe Smith
USA. Or in the case of state
elections, Joe Smith California,
or locally, Joe Smith L.A. But
always Joe Smith.
Joe Smith would be our voice
of dissent. As a large group joined
to disagree. Making your vote, my
vote, all of our votes count!
The Silent Give In
Currently, many silent voters
just give in, vote for the ticket.
Others write in any name as a
protest. There is no way to judge
how many are dissenting. No way
to make our "no" count.
Joe Smith USA is a general
name. There are a lot of Joe
Smiths in our nation. And there
are a lot of us who want people to
represent us. Perhaps we can't get

our elected officials to respond to
what we want but by Joe Smith
USA we will be able to stop
them from what we do not want!
All it takes is for you and me
to agree to disagree .. . with
them! Joe Smith USA will
prove that.
If our numbers grow large
enough then the politicians will
notice there is a large minority
out there, a group that can swing
an election perhaps, and they will
court our votes. They'll have to
dig to find what we want but
then we are only too happy to tell
them that.
'lmmediate Redress'
Hopefully, somewhere down
the line in the future, we can also
go a step further, so that the
common man, the middle
America voter, the dissenter for
whatever the cause can have some
immediate redress. To misquote a
line: government of the people is
too important to leave it to the
politicians.
Hopefully, in the future we
might see legislation passed that
says if less than half the people
vote (and that's counting both
parties, the GOP and the
Democrats together) that the
election will have to be held again.
Perhaps they could say the
election was called off for lack of
interest by the voters ... we the
dissenters might be able to bring
that about. But that is future
legislation, working within the
system, having the system also
work for us.
I repeat, there is no axe to
grind. It costs nothing. It means
acting in concert.
If you agree with this premise,
then I request that we begin in a
simple grass roots way. Chain
letters, pyramid letters, letters to
the editor. Copy this and mail it
to all your friends, acquaintances.
A Citizen's Duty!
Simply, if you disagree with
the way things are being run in
your government don't you think
it is a citizen's duty to rectify it,
legally, using the system, with
your peers?
I call it Conto's Coefficient
because, hopefully again, it will
equalize influence in government,
equalize it for all of us. If bigness
is heard most or loudest then
this is away for us to band
together temporarily and be heard
in a big way.
If we can make our voices
heard as a dissenting group
even in one city, or one state, it
may be the second loudest shot
heard since Concord.

Smiths in our nation. And there
are a lot of us who want people to
represent us. Perhaps we can't get

our elected officials to respond to
what we want but by Joe Smith
USA we will be able to stop
them from what we do not want!
All it takes is for you and me
to agree to disagree .. . with
them! Joe Smith USA will
prove that.
If our numbers grow large
enough then the politicians will
notice there is a large minority
out there, a group that can swing
an election perhaps, and they will
court our votes. They'll have to
dig to find what we want but
then we are only too happy to tell
them that.
'lmmediate Redress'
Hopefully, somewhere down
the line in the future, we can also
go a step further, so that the
common man, the middle
America voter, the dissenter for
whatever the cause can have some
immediate redress. To misquote a
line: government of the people is
too important to leave it to the
politicians.
Hopefully, in the future we
might see legislation passed that
says if less than half the people
vote (and that's counting both
parties, the GOP and the
Democrats together) that the
election will have to be held again.
Perhaps they could say the
election was called off for lack of
interest by the voters ... we the
dissenters might be able to bring
that about. But that is future
legislation, working within the
system, having the system also
work for us.
I repeat, there is no axe to
grind. It costs nothing. It means
acting in concert.
If you agree with this premise,
then I request that we begin in a
simple grass roots way. Chain
letters, pyramid letters, letters to
the editor. Copy this and mail it
to all your friends, acquaintances.
A Citizen's Duty!
Simply, if you disagree with
the way things are being run in
your government don't you think
it is a citizen's duty to rectify it,
legally, using the system, with
your peers?
I call it Conto's Coefficient
because, hopefully again, it will
equalize influence in government,
equalize it for all of us. If bigness
is heard most or loudest then
this is away for us to band
together temporarily and be heard
in a big way.
If we can make our voices
heard as a dissenting group
even in one city, or one state, it
may be the second loudest shot
heard since Concord.

Does your vote count
anymore?
Are you experiencing the
problem of picking "the lesser of
two evils?" Finding yourself not
wanting to vote either for the
Democrat or the Republican,
feeling that he or she does not
reflect your point of view or
cannot do the job or has a bad
record in office is this at least
unsatisfactory to you?
A lot of us are in that same
predicament. We want to be good
citizens, we want to vote ... but
for whom, when both opposing
candidates are unacceptable to us?
There is a solution. One so
simple that it has been ignored. It
costs you nothing. Yet it will give
you a voice an active voice
in government, be it local, state or
federal.
Still better, there is no axe to
grind, no special interest involved
here except your own whether
you are a Republican, a
Democrat, an independent or a
new voter. Because first you are a
citizen with your rights ... and
your duties.
Solution: Dissent
The solution is to dissent. To
disagree with the choice offered
you. For example, during the last
Presidential election did you want
either of the candidates, or did
you with a bothered conscience
vote "against" one of the men?
We must agree to disagree as
a group. Yet, without giving
anyone or any group or party
leverage that we are unwilling for
them to have. We don't want to
be ripped off anymore, by
political hacks or do-gooders or
even those who "believe" in
compromise.
What would happen if
everyone of us who finds himself
or herself in the "I don't want
either one" voting conflict wrote
in Joe Smith USA? All of us
writing on our ballot, Joe Smith
USA. Or in the case of state
elections, Joe Smith California,
or locally, Joe Smith L.A. But
always Joe Smith.
Joe Smith would be our voice
of dissent. As a large group joined
to disagree. Making your vote, my
vote, all of our votes count!
The Silent Give In
Currently, many silent voters
just give in, vote for the ticket.
Others write in any name as a
protest. There is no way to judge
how many are dissenting. No way
to make our "no" count.

If we can make our voices
heard as a dissenting group
even in one city, or one state, it
may be the second loudest shot
heard since Concord.

Does your vote count
anymore?
Are you experiencing the
problem of picking "the lesser of
two evils?" Finding yourself not
wanting to vote either for the
Democrat or the Republican,
feeling that he or she does not
reflect your point of view or
cannot do the job or has a bad
record in office is this at least
unsatisfactory to you?
A lot of us are in that same
predicament. We want to be good
citizens, we want to vote ... but
for whom, when both opposing
candidates are unacceptable to us?
There is a solution. One so
simple that it has been ignored. It
costs you nothing. Yet it will give
you a voice an active voice
in government, be it local, state or
federal.
Still better, there is no axe to
grind, no special interest involved
here except your own whether
you are a Republican, a
Democrat, an independent or a
new voter. Because first you are a
citizen with your rights ... and
your duties.
Solution: Dissent
The solution is to dissent. To
disagree with the choice offered
you. For example, during the last
Presidential election did you want
either of the candidates, or did
you with a bothered conscience
vote "against" one of the men?
We must agree to disagree as
a group. Yet, without giving
anyone or any group or party
leverage that we are unwilling for
them to have. We don't want to
be ripped off anymore, by
political hacks or do-gooders or
even those who "believe" in
compromise.
What would happen if
everyone of us who finds himself
or herself in the "I don't want
either one" voting conflict wrote
in Joe Smith USA? All of us
writing on our ballot, Joe Smith
USA. Or in the case of state
elections, Joe Smith California,
or locally, Joe Smith L.A. But
always Joe Smith.
Joe Smith would be our voice
of dissent. As a large group joined
to disagree. Making your vote, my
vote, all of our votes count!
The Silent Give In
Currently, many silent voters
just give in, vote for the ticket.
Others write in any name as a
protest. There is no way to judge
how many are dissenting. No way
to make our "no" count.
Joe Smith USA is a general
name. There are a lot of Joe
Smiths in our nation. And there
are a lot of us who want people to
represent us. Perhaps we can't get

our elected officials to respond to
what we want but by Joe Smith
USA we will be able to stop
them from what we do not want!
All it takes is for you and me
to agree to disagree .. . with
them! Joe Smith USA will
prove that.
If our numbers grow large
enough then the politicians will
notice there is a large minority
out there, a group that can swing
an election perhaps, and they will
court our votes. They'll have to
dig to find what we want but
then we are only too happy to tell
them that.
'lmmediate Redress'
Hopefully, somewhere down
the line in the future, we can also
go a step further, so that the
common man, the middle
America voter, the dissenter for
whatever the cause can have some
immediate redress. To misquote a
line: government of the people is
too important to leave it to the
politicians.
Hopefully, in the future we
might see legislation passed that
says if less than half the people
vote (and that's counting both
parties, the GOP and the
Democrats together) that the
election will have to be held again.
Perhaps they could say the
election was called off for lack of
interest by the voters ... we the
dissenters might be able to bring
that about. But that is future
legislation, working within the
system, having the system also
work for us.
I repeat, there is no axe to
grind. It costs nothing. It means
acting in concert.
If you agree with this premise,
then I request that we begin in a
simple grass roots way. Chain
letters, pyramid letters, letters to
the editor. Copy this and mail it
to all your friends, acquaintances.
A Citizen's Duty!
Simply, if you disagree with
the way things are being run in
your government don't you think
it is a citizen's duty to rectify it,
legally, using the system, with
your peers?
I call it Conto's Coefficient
because, hopefully again, it will
equalize influence in government,
equalize it for all of us. If bigness
is heard most or loudest then
this is away for us to band
together temporarily and be heard
in a big way.
If we can make our voices
heard as a dissenting group
even in one city, or one state, it
may be the second loudest shot
heard since Concord.
