# Judge Jeopardizes Dial-A-Bus Service
## 
### LONNIE ROSENWALD 
• Santa Clara County's innovative
Dial-A-Ride bus service, in operation
for less than two months, is suddenly
facing a threat to its existence.
The threat is in the form of a Santa
Clara Superior Court ruling handed
down by Judge Marshall S. Hall last
► Thursday ordering the county either
to discontinue Dial-A-Ride or to buy
out eight private taxicab companies.
The ruling came in response to a
suit filed by the cab companies against
the county on Nov. 18 charging that
the new demand-response bus service
1 was taking away the taxicabs' business.
The County Transit District Board
of Directors has been given two weeks
to decide whether to discontinue
Dial-A-Ride, to purchase the cab
companies or to appeal the ruling. The
County Transportation Commission,
It which acts as adviser to the Board of
Directors, will meet this Wednesday
evening to decide the issue.
"I lean towards purchasing of the
cabs," Supervisor Sig Sanchez, a
member of the Transit Board, said.
Refering to the fledgling Dial-A-Ride
I service he added, "We're not about to
abandon it at this time."
Strong Opposition
However, Jack Ybarra, chairman of
the County Transportation
Commission, voiced strong opposition
to the ruling, avowing to appeal the
I decision all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court if necessary.
Cost of purchasing the cab
companies is the major deterrent in
regard to the proposed takeover.
Sanchez noted that federal funds
might be secured to finance the
I transaction, but Ybarra fears that the
burden will fall upon the taxpayer. "I
want a definitive ruling from the
Supreme Court before we invest
millions of taxpayers' dollars buying
out the cabs," he said.
Sanchez sees acquisition of the
9 taxicabs as potentially advantageous to
the county's transit operations. "We
could use taxis in the Dial-A-Ride
system," he said.

If the county were to purchase the
cabs, the vehicles might replace the
large buses in the Dial-A-Ride system.
The buses would instead then be used
in expanded arterial service, as well as
in commuter carpools.
Sanchez believes that taxicabs
would be capable of maintaining the
system's present capacity rate of 10
passengers per hour. He added, '"The
taxicab can provide service at a lot less
cost."
In a related development, the
critical shortage of reservationists,
those persons who answer
service-request calls in the Dial-A-Ride
system, will soon be eased by the
hiring of 70 additional workers, it was
announced last week.
This additional hiring will be made
possible by a new federal manpower
grant which allocates funds for the
creation of 105 new jobs in the
county.
Despite all of its problems, the
leaders of the county's transit
operations feel that Dial-A-Ride has
been successful. Sanchez pointed out
that on Friday 4800 passengers were
accomodated by the system. This
figure represents almost 50 percent of
the projected goal of 10,000 set for
July 1.

predictions of pending economic doom for the Unviersity were probably
exaggerated.
