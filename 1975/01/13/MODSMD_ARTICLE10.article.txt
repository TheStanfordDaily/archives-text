# Bungling Bureaucracy Strikes Again
## 
### Rich Jaroslovsky 
Any bureaucracy is rife with tales of
incompetence, incoherence and just plain
stupidity. Stanford is certainly no exception.
We recall several poignant moments from this
still-young school year. There was, for
example, the scheduling of a major address
by Dr. Lyman directly opposite a speech by
R. Sargent Shriver.
Then there was the delay in repair of the
Tresidder air conditioning system that lasted
until autumn and then it was fixed so well
that the occupants of the Dean's office there
had to wear coats indoors to keep warm. And
of course, for sheer brilliance, who can forget
the staff of Roble Hall that had all the dorm
rooms rekeyed without warning the
inhabitants? I discovered that one at 2:30
one morning.
The latest beauty comes from poor Marvin
Herrington, the campus chief of police. (I call
him "poor Marvin" because I have the feeling
he's going to get dumped on for this, even
though it's probably not his own idea.) It's a
circular that went up in dorms and on the
kiosks recently. I quote relevant portions:
"The Stanford University parking program
has been under review for several months. We
had expected that a new program would be
ready for implementation by January 1975.
However, due to the complexity of the task,
it will not be completed until fall quarter
1975. Therefore, the existing program will be
reinstituted in January 1975."
The flyer goes on to state that all students
with motor vehicles must purchase a
validation decall for $7.50 (faculty and staff
get theirs free), and closes with a subtly
worded reminder that "all Stanford
students, faculty and staff motor vehicles will
be subject to citation for failure to display a
valid 1975 parking decal after January 20,
1975."

Student reaction to the circular, God help
us, has been as close to unanimity as most of
us can remember. Escondido Village
residents, exercised because they feel they're
already paying for parking and maintenance
services in their rent, say they'll boycott the
plan. The ASSU Senate passed a resolution
without dissent supporting a boycott at least
until the University clarifies its reasons for
collecting the fee.
August campus journals at least, the
Daily and Live Oak have joined in the
boycott call, and it's reported that ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri will suggest
using ASSU funds to reimburse any student
cited for the $2 violation. (The concurrence
of Live Oak and Frank Olivieri, by the way,
marks the first time this year that those two
worthies have agreed on anything.) There
have even been ugly mumblings about
lawsuits and similar nasty doings.
Enigmatic Phrasing
So far, it seems, no one has really offered
a coherent reason for why the clampdown.
Chief Herrington's circular speaks of
"reinstituting the existing program
something faintly puzzling about that
wording but that still leaves some things
unanswered.
For example, I assume the circular means
we student motorists have to continue doing
what we've been doing. But I've had a car on
this campus for upwards of four years, have
never bought a sticker, and have somehow
avoided being cited for it. Could it be that
the rule is, shall we say, unevenly enforced?
Now if Chief Herrington's circular means a
continuation of this apparently largely
honored-in-the-breach tradition, why, then,
I'm all for it. But I have a theory that it
means something else.

I call my theory the Boris Badenov
Theorem. It runs as follows: the University is
in financial straits. It's looking about for, oh,
a few extra thousand. It can't raise tuition in
midyear. What does it do? It hits upon a
seldom-enforced rule, due to be changed
imminently anyway, and sees dollar signs. It
can't charge faculty and staff, since they
work here and would undoubtedly raise a big
stink. It can't charge administrators, since
they make the rules in the first place. Who's
left? You guessed it.
Afficianados of Rocky and his friends
will recognize this instantly as the familiar
litany of the poor spy: "I give bomb to
Moose. Moose give bomb to squirrel. Squirrel
pass bomb to lady spy. Who gets blown up?
Me."
Opposing Principles
Unfortunately, the University ignores two
opposing principles.
One is the Screwer-Screwee Theorem. This
states that in any situation, the screwee
screams in direct proportion to the
callousness, clumsiness, and tactlessness of
the screwer. The result is obvious.
The other is the Blood-From-A-Turnip
Hypothesis. (You can call it the Jaroslovsky
Hypothesis, but that's kind of a mouthful.) I
discovered this one after adding my bank
balance to my expected income for the
quarter, and then comparing that sum to the
amount of tuition I still owe. This hypothesis
holds that if I have no money, I can't be hurt
by a fine. Or as Bob Dylan phrased it so
elegantly, "when you ain't got nothin' you
got nothin' to lose."
And so, organized boycott or no, I shall
not buy a parking sticker.
