# CIA Foxes Guarding Chicken Coop?
## 
### Jean Jerome 
Recently on a radio talk show I
again heard from that handful of
people who, ever since 1963, have
been investigating the
assassination of President John F.
Kennedy. Their research points to
the CIA as the organizer of the
assassination, in collusion with the
military (which under Johnson
and Nixon got such a boost with
the escalation of the Vietnam War
and with an 80 percent share of
the U.S. Government's budget)
and with big business (such as the
oil companies).
The researchers also believe
that this same CIA-military
business group of men killed
Robert Kennedy and Martin King,
and were responsible for
Chappaquidick and Watergate.
So when the Jan. 6 New York
Times carried two articles about
Ford's commission to investigate
the CIA, I decided to try
rearranging the Times' data.
Inner Connections
First, some members of the
commission are connected with
one another. C. Douglas Dillion,
for example, was named in 1971
to serve as chairman of the board
of trustees of the Rockefeller
Foundation; Vice President
Nelson Rockefeller is chairman of
the commission to investigate the
CIA. Another member, Lane
Kirkland, in 1974 was named to
one of the study panels of
Rockefeller's Commission on
Critical Choices for Americans.
Furthermore, Henry Kissinger,
a longtime Rockefeller associate
and recipient of a large monetary
gift from him, met with Ford on
Jan. 5 to discuss setting up the
commission.
Ford also met with Richard
Helms, who was accused by the
New York Times last Dec. 22 of
having authorized massive
domestic spying operations under

the Johnson and Nixon
Administrations.
Earlier Investigating
Rockerfeller and Dillon have
also been connected with previous
CIA investigations. Rockefeller
from 1969 until 1974 served on
the President's Foreign
Intelligence Adivsory Board, set
up by President Kennedy after the
Bay of Pigs fiasco to watch the
CIA.
Dillon, as acting secretary of
state in 1970, released the report
that a CIA U-2 plane that crashed
in Russia was just another weather
plane. In 1968, he presided over
off-the-record meetings of the
Council on foreign policy and CIA
relations to private institutions.
Military Connections
Many of the members of the
commission also have connections

with the military. Rockefeller
during the Eisenhower
Administration established top
secret seminars at the Marine
Corps School in Quantico,
Virginia to develop cold war
tactics and strategy.
Edwin N. Griswold, another
member, once served as solicitor
general under President Nixon.
During his tenure, he argued
before the Supreme Court that
army surveillance of civilians
taking place in 1967-70 didn't
violate federal law or the U.S.
Constitution.
Ronald Reagan, California's
own contribution to the
commission, was an adamant
hawk during the Vietnam War.
Gen. Lyman N. Lemnitzer, a
commission member, was

chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff during the Bay of Bigs
invasion. He also is former
supreme commander of NATO.
Big Business
John T. Connor, also on the
commission, is a wealthy
industrialist who raised millions of
dollars to ransom Cubans
captured during the Bay of Pigs
invasion. A former secretary of
commerce under President
Johnson, Connor is now chairman
of the Allied Chemical Corp.
Using just the data available in
the New York Times, nearly all
commission members are shown
to have connections to the CIA,
big business or the military, if not
all three.

Many of the members of the
commission also have connections

with the military. Rockefeller
during the Eisenhower
Administration established top
secret seminars at the Marine
Corps School in Quantico,
Virginia to develop cold war
tactics and strategy.
Edwin N. Griswold, another
member, once served as solicitor
general under President Nixon.
During his tenure, he argued
before the Supreme Court that
army surveillance of civilians
taking place in 1967-70 didn't
violate federal law or the U.S.
Constitution.
Ronald Reagan, California's
own contribution to the
commission, was an adamant
hawk during the Vietnam War.
Gen. Lyman N. Lemnitzer, a
commission member, was

chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff during the Bay of Bigs
invasion. He also is former
supreme commander of NATO.
Big Business
John T. Connor, also on the
commission, is a wealthy
industrialist who raised millions of
dollars to ransom Cubans
captured during the Bay of Pigs
invasion. A former secretary of
commerce under President
Johnson, Connor is now chairman
of the Allied Chemical Corp.
Using just the data available in
the New York Times, nearly all
commission members are shown
to have connections to the CIA,
big business or the military, if not
all three.

Recently on a radio talk show I
again heard from that handful of
people who, ever since 1963, have
been investigating the
assassination of President John F.
Kennedy. Their research points to
the CIA as the organizer of the
assassination, in collusion with the
military (which under Johnson
and Nixon got such a boost with
the escalation of the Vietnam War
and with an 80 percent share of
the U.S. Government's budget)
and with big business (such as the
oil companies).
The researchers also believe
that this same CIA-military
business group of men killed
Robert Kennedy and Martin King,
and were responsible for
Chappaquidick and Watergate.
So when the Jan. 6 New York
Times carried two articles about
Ford's commission to investigate
the CIA, I decided to try
rearranging the Times' data.
Inner Connections
First, some members of the
commission are connected with
one another. C. Douglas Dillion,
for example, was named in 1971
to serve as chairman of the board
of trustees of the Rockefeller
Foundation; Vice President
Nelson Rockefeller is chairman of
the commission to investigate the
CIA. Another member, Lane
Kirkland, in 1974 was named to
one of the study panels of
Rockefeller's Commission on
Critical Choices for Americans.
Furthermore, Henry Kissinger,
a longtime Rockefeller associate
and recipient of a large monetary
gift from him, met with Ford on
Jan. 5 to discuss setting up the
commission.
Ford also met with Richard
Helms, who was accused by the
New York Times last Dec. 22 of
having authorized massive
domestic spying operations under

the Johnson and Nixon
Administrations.
Earlier Investigating
Rockerfeller and Dillon have
also been connected with previous
CIA investigations. Rockefeller
from 1969 until 1974 served on
the President's Foreign
Intelligence Adivsory Board, set
up by President Kennedy after the
Bay of Pigs fiasco to watch the
CIA.
Dillon, as acting secretary of
state in 1970, released the report
that a CIA U-2 plane that crashed
in Russia was just another weather
plane. In 1968, he presided over
off-the-record meetings of the
Council on foreign policy and CIA
relations to private institutions.
