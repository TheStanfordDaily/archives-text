# China Encourages Schools
## 
### Bardacke, et. al 
We, members of a delegation of
students and faculty from the
University of California at Santa
Cruz, have just returned from a 21
day tour of the People's Republic
of China. Being from a university,
we were quite interested in
visiting educational institutions of
all levels.

We returned with great
enthusiasm towards China's
approach to education contrary
to the San Francisco Examiner
article, of Dec. 6, entitled "Dim
View of China's Universities"
which was based on a talk given
by Stanford's President Richard
Lyman.
It is important to view China as
a developing socialist country

with needs different from those of
the United States, a highly
developed capitalist country.
Workers As Students
The concept of the "extended
university" is being put into
practice in China where workers
and peasants are brought into the
university not only as students
(for short and long term courses)
but as teachers and guest lecturers
as well. People from such
backgrounds would never have
had such opportunities before
1949.
Students As Teachers
Faculty members of China's
universities, instead of suffering
from the "publish or perish"
syndrome, work on increasing the

relevance of education to fit the
needs of China's development.
Students now have important
contributions to make in planning
the teaching program, in preparing
texts, in determining the teaching
methods and in evaluating them.
Perhaps our university students
and faculty could benefit in
learning how productive
experimentation can combine
theory and practice, make the
learning process more meaningful
and exciting and contribute to the
betterment of society.

Cynthia Bell, Luch Ostrander and
Terry Shorrock are students and
faculty members at the University
of California at Santa Cruz.)
