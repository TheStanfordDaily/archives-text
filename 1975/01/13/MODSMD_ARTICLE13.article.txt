Reply To Pasquinucci
Editor:
After reading Officer
Pasquinucci's reply to my column
about the different types of i
justice meted out to police rock
throwers and student rock
throwers, I have decided that he
lacks either the honesty or the
intelligence to hold such an
important position as Community
Service Officer. >
Pasquinucci was a police rock
thrower and in his letter he
complains about his treatment as
compared to mine. Unfortunately
for Pasquinucci the comparison I
made in my column was not
between him and me but rather (
between him and Paul Stutz.
The reason I told about my
own experience is because I was
innocent and yet it seemed the
police were trying to frame me
anyway. So in my mind there is a
strong likelihood that Stutz was
innocent as well and just wasn't
blessed with my good fortune.
But even if Stutz was guilty the
comparison is remarkable.
Pasquinucci was never even
charged in the American courts.
He was dealt with by internal
Stanford Police administrative
procedures. In his letter he
complains about a lack of counsel
at his hearing. I'm sure that at the
time he was most grateful to be
involved in a suspension hearing at
the Police Department instead of
a felony trial down at the
courthouse in San Jose.
Pasquinucci was punished by a
suspension of only two days.
Stutz was sentenced to six months
to life at San Quentin. Even
though that sentence was
suspended and he was put on ,
probation for four years the terms
of that probation was a year in
the county honor camp at
Elmwood. After eight months at
Elmwood he was released for his
good behavior.
The reason I have decided to
drag this "through the mud" now '
after all these years (really only
three) is because Stutz has just
gotten off parole. It wouldn't
have been safe to write about him
any earlier.
What Pasquinucci did in his
letter was use the old debating I
trick known as the "Straw Man."
One attributes something to your
adversary that he never said and
proceeds to demolish it. Although
it isn't as violent as rock throwing,
it is violence against the truth. I
am a pacifist and am opposed to j
violence against people and the
truth. Pasquinucci seems to me to
be a very violent man. I don't
want him guarding me.

Disappointing Turnout
Editor:
As participants in SWOPSI's
Age Discrimination course, we
were deeply disappointed about
the small number of students who
attended the first meeting. This
course is designed to confront and
explode the destructive myths of
aging. Contrary to popular
thought, old people can and do
have sex. And senility is the
exception rather than the rule.
This course should have special
appeal because unlike
discrimination against racial
minorities or women,
discrimination against older
persons is an issue all of us must
eventually face. Each of us
therefore has a personal stake in #
confronting and challenging the
devaluation of the aged.
Old age is certainly just as
relevant to Stanford students as
are their dating patterns. Yet
SWOPSI 105 (Dating and
Courtship Patterns of Stanford 4
Students) had more than ten
times more students than we did
at the first meeting!
The course will be a learning
experience of intense personal
involvement. It will deal with
relevant laws forbidding age '<&
discrimination as well as examine
laws and policies that adversely
affect older people.
If scheduling prevented
anyone's involvement, pleaise
contact SWOPSI and it will be
worked out. We hope to see more
people at the next meeting on
Wed., Jan. 15 at 7 p.m. in UGLY
room 144.

Harding-Style Wording
Editor:
C omfortably seated at
breakfast with my morning paper,
my tired eyes were affronted by
your headline "Theologist Brown
Combines Activism with
Religion."
Mind you, I hold nothing
against Robert McAfee Brown
it's the wording I'm quarreling
with. "Theologist" doesn't appear
in my dictionary. I think
"theologian" is the word
intended. Pass it on to night staff,
along with a cup of coffee and a
copy of Webster's.
