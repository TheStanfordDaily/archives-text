## World Champion Marathon Swimmer Pays Tuition With Racing Prize Money 
### TERRI YAVITZ 
The starting signal sounds, the
swimmers are off. But this race is
hardly a typical meter run. It's a
24-mile swim marathon that tests
a swimmer's strength and
endurance.
Sandra Bucha is a pro—the
world champion in professional
women's marathon swimming.
Her accomplishments in this
little-publicized sport were
featured in Sports Illustrated,
Aug. 5,1974. ».
Competing in five international
swim marathon meets during the
past two summers, Bucha holds
one first-place title, has placed
second three times and third
once. These wins have brought her
about $lO,OOO in prize money.

Bucha, now a junior at
Stanford, began her swimming
career at age 7. At the Ladue
Swim Club in St. Louis, Mo.
Coach Steve Nielson, "really made
my involvement a fun
experience," Bucha recalls.
Three years later her father
retired from the military, and her
family moved to the Chicago area.
There Bucha attended Hinsdale
High, nationally known for
excellent men's swim teams.
With The Boys
The fact that Hinsdale didn't
have a women's team didn't
prevent Bucha from training
under the guidance of Coach Don
Watson. "Coach Watson saved my
career in swimming by allowing
me to continue practicing," Bucha

says. "Without that training I
would have had a crucial cut-off
(from the sport) and would
probably have been left with no
other alternative than to drop
out."

Swimming with the men's
team, her training schedule was
rigorous. "I began vigorous
workouts twice a day for four to
five hours at each session," she
recalls. She thrived on Watson's
demanding training techniques:
"I've continued to train under his
guidance even after turning pro,"
Bucha says.
A strong competitor in 100
meter butterfly and 100, 200 and
400 meter freestyle events, Bucha
finished high in Amateur Athletic
Union (AAU) national meets.
Rewarding Results
In 1970 she captured first
place in three-mile National
AAU Long Distance race held in
Indiana. "My first attempt at
long-distance racing proved quite
rewarding," she understates.
She continued to compete in
traditional swim events, achieving
a competitive and personal goal in
1972. "I'd always wanted to place
in Olympic tryouts and finally in
Chicago I did it," she says. She
placed seventh in 100 meter
freestyle trials and eighth in the
200 meter freestyle. "I never
thought I'd get this far in the
competitive world," she states,
disbelieving.
After entering Stanford in
1972, she became involved in
professional swimming "by
accident."
Explains Bucha, "At the time I
had achieved all I wanted out of
amateur competition. While on
life guard duty one summer I
noticed an advertisement in
Swimming World for a
professional 10-mile meet in
Chicago. It was so close to home
that I just couldn't pass it up."
Training Technique
Relying on Coach Watson's
"quick swim" training formula,

Bucha prepared her
cardio-vascular system for the rigors
of marathon racing in just two
weeks.
She explains, "Unlike amateur
racing, [professional marathon
swimming] requires endurance,-
and 99 percent mental discipline,
rather than speed."
Marathon swimming, says
Bucha, is the only sport where
men and women compete on an
equal basis for the same prize
money.

Of a four-woman, 41-man
field, Bucha edged out everyone
but Johan Schans, known as the
"Flying Dutchman" to pick up a
second-place purse of $2OOO. Last
summer she joined the marathon
swimming professional circuit.
The difference between
amateur and professional racing,
says Bucha, is like the difference
between eating cooked squash and
corn on the cob: taking a bite of
the latter is much more strenous.
Bucha participated in three

grueling professional long distance
events last summer, one 24-hour
event and other races of 10-25
miles each. During 25-, 24-, and
10-mile races swimmers are
allowed to make "pit stops" for
frantic feedings of quick energy
foods. Bucha's revitalization
packet generally consists of
honey, hot tea and fructose
tablets.
But fast food alone doesn't
always relieve a swimmer's
exhaustion. Asked how he felt
during a 24-hour race, Bucha's
team partner John Kinsella, a
double medalist in the 1968 and
1972 Olympics, replied, "I was in
' too much pain to think about it.
Fatigue can be dangerous. One
marathon swimmer was rushed to
the hospital where she "lay
unconscious with glucose
intravenously dripping into one
limp arm and injections of
vitamins eneering the other,"
according to Sports Illustrated.
Close To Quitting
Bucha recalls the fatigue and
frustration of one 25-mile race. "I
came the closest that I've ever
been to drowning and began
getting ideas of quitting."
But she didn't give up. Her
brother, serving as her trainer for
the race, supplied her with energy
food and encouragement and
strategic suggestions from a
nearby platform.
"When I felt ready to die, he
told me I only had one more mile
to go," Bucha remembers.
"Actually I had five more, but I
picked up a lot of speed that
way."

Swimming alternate laps as a
team, Bucha and Kinsella placed
first in the La Tuque marathon,
winning $3500 in prize money.
Not Only Money
Some benefits of the racing
circuit are not financial, Bucha
observes. "The international
flavor I've tasted through traveling
and the friendships I've made can
never be acquired in school or

when leading a casual lifestyle.
Pressures and harsh discipline are
part of the responsibilities, but I
grow so much in knowledge about
myself, in my relation to others."
Bucha refuses to accept
excessive praise for her success.
She says she "owes everything to
everyone" and never talks about a
race without adding to whom a
win should be credited."
Bucha's goals extend beyond
the swimming world. "I approach
my studies the same way I would
prepare for a meet. Fortunately,
swimming has taught me
self-discipline ~and has built my

confidence to meet greater
challenges." She is presently
working on a history/psychology
major and is applying to law
schools.
Bucha forcasts, "It is quite
possible that I'll compete again
this summer. This time, however,
it would be primarily to win the
prize money to take care of
school expenses."
As Stanford tuition increases,
Bucha may have to think more
about the slogan on a poster
hanging in her room. "The secret
to success," it reads, "is constancy
of purpose."

THRILL OF VlCTORY—Champion marathon swimmer Sandra Bucha
and teammate John Kinsella don't look like they've just finished
swimming for 24 hours but they have. Shown here after their win in
the La Tuque marathon race, they probably are smiling about their
winnings $3500.
