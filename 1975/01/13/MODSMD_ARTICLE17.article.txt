## Cards Split, Out-Kamikaze Oregon, OSU 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
CORVALLIS, Ore.—Up here,
they call it Kamikaze Basketball.
Intimidate. Hit the floor like
it's a trampoline, if that's the best
way to draw a foul or grab a loose
ball. Hand check, muscle in.
Scream at the refs. Do anything to
win.
And happily, Stanford's
normally staid basketball team
quickly adapted to the art form
that dominates this hoop-crazed
state. They out-kamikazied their
hosts in splitting their first two
Pacific Eight games, beating
Oregon State 71-64 Saturday
night after losing 84-83 to Oregon
on Friday.
In fact, the only reason
Stanford didn't end up with a
phenomenal pair of wins instead
of a perfectly respectable split was
that it didn't master a most
fundamental tenet of K.B.
Don't get caught.
Stanford out-hustled Dick
Harter's "Kamikaze Kids" in the
opener at the Eugene nuthouse,
otherwise called McArthur Court.
But the Cardinals overdid it.
With eight minutes remaining
in the games, all four Card starters
had four fouls on them and Scott
Trobbe had already fouled out.
The referees' incessant whistle
thereafter shot down three more
starters (all but Ed Schweitzer),
enabling the Ducks to hang on for
the win against the Stanford
bench.
The turning point of the game
was typically Kamikaze.
With 12:32 to go and the score
tied at 59, Rich Kelley patted
Oregon's super-pugnacious guard,
Mark Barwig, on the stomach as
Kelley ran downcourt.
Barwig, who'd been bugging
the Cardinals all evening, fell as if
hit by a Muhummad Ali right.
Whistle. Flagrant foul on Kelley,
his fourth. Barwig, quickly
recovered, sank two free throws.
With Kelley's effectiveness
reduced, Stanford stalled, but
turned the ball over twice against
a pressure defense, and never
again really threatened.
Stanford had taken a 47-41
halftime lead on Schweitzer's hot
shooting and Kelley's numerous

free throws. With both post men
dominating on offense, there
wasn't much Oregon could do to
stop Stanford. Schweitzer finished
the game with 11 of 13 from the
floor, for a total of 27 points,
while Kelley added 24.
Stanford would have been in
command after the first half had
it not been for forward Greg
Ballard, who got 19 en route to a
26-point game.
Meanwhile, Card guard Melvin
Arterberry, back in the lineup
after an administrative Bay of Pigs
cost him five games, guarded
superduck Ron Lee well for a
half, but Lee's exciting jumpers
broke the game wide open in the
second half, after Arterberry was
in foul trouble.
All Stanford could do was
absorb its third straight one-point
loss to the Ducks (though this one
wasn't quite that close), get out of
Eugene as fast as possible, and bus
to Corvallis.
Here, Schweitzer played his
second straight fantastic game,
hitting 11 of 14 (for a two-game
total of 22 for 27) and scoring
another 27 points.
In addition to his usual role as
a close-in scavenger, he extended
his range against OSU, hitting a
couple 15-footers.
There was another difference.
This time, Schweitzer's offensive
heroics were enough to win the
game.
Reason: Stanford, untypically,
played great defense throughout.
Guards Arterberry and Mark
Gil berg put great perimeter
pressure on the Beavers' guards,
negating an on-paper outside

shooting advantage. The pair of
seniors also had little trouble
getting the ball upcourt against
OSU's press.
While Arterberry played
smoothly and Gilberg kamikazied
like a friendly Barwig, Stanford's
postmen got the required points.
Centers Kelley and Patterson
matched Schweitzer's total with
17 and 10 points, respectively. In
all, over 3/4 of Stanford's points
(54 of 71) were scored from the
two post positions.
The teams played nip-and-tuck
for most of the game, but
Stanford took the lead to stay
with eight straight points in the
last three minutes, Schweitzer
getting two key buckets.
Stanford's last-minute play was
especially surprising because
coach Howie Dailmar didn't make
a single substitution during the

entire second half. But
Arterberry, Gilberg, Kelley,
Schweitzer and Trobbe (who
didn't get a point all night but was
good defensively) never tired.
Gilberg summed it up: "You
don't get tired if you don't think
about it. The team's playing
harder now we're much more
together than the last two years."
OSU coach Ralph Miller
agreed. "Stanford held together
and played together much better
than we did." Miller also drew
muffled laughs when he said his
team committed the "Cardinal
sin" of not playing good defense.
If the Cardinals can avoid what
is indeed their primary sin,
complacent defense, and keep on
playing like they're the Kalifornia
Kamikazes this will be a most
exciting season.

Cardinal Notes: Some measures
of how basketball crazy Oregon
fans are about their teams: There
were 10,000 fans jammed into
Mac Court Friday night; 10,147 at
Gill Coliseum in Corvallis the
next night. The big pre-game sport
at Mac is throwing frisbees around
the gym. . . All Oregon games are
televised state-wide, and since
many students can't get tickets
(they're sold by lottery) they
eagerly watch the tape-delay
without first learning the score. ..
At Oregon State, the halftime
show was a game between
9-year-olds whose team nicknames
were "Beavers" and "Ducks." The
fans hate Oregon so much they
wouldn't applaud when the little
Ducks scored but went wild when
the Beavers did.

MIDGET AMONG GIANTS —Oregon's Greg Graham, hardly an
intimidating rebounder at 6-foot-2,153 pounds, tries to get out of the
way as Stanford's Scott Trobbe battles for the ball with Oregon's
Gerald Willett (50) and Stu Jackson. The Ducks edged the Cards
84-83 Friday night in Eugene, but Stanford came back Saturday for a
71-63 victory over Oregon State in Corvallis.
