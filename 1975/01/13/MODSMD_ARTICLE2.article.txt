# Hospital Seeks More Federal Funds
## High Costs May Close Kidney Center 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Federal regulations may force
Stanford Hospital to close the doors of
its newly opened artificial kidney
treatment center within several
months, Peter Carpenter, vice
president for medical affairs, disclosed
Friday.
The center's kidney dialysis
treatment is mandatory for the
survival of patients who would
otherwise die of renal failure.

It is the expense of the treatment
which could force the University to
close the new center, according to
Carpenter. He said that the current
average cost for a dialysis session is
$lBB or about $30,000 per patient per
year.
Under the federal government's
Medicare program, patients over 65 are
for 80 percent of the cost
after the first three months.
In addition, the government pays

"reasonable costs" to hospitals
providing dialysis, but only up to $145
for a typical treatment, Carpenter said,
adding that hospitals end up absorbing
a $43 loss per treatment on the
average.
"We've tried to make what we
considered a reasonable effort to
reduce costs," he added, "but we can
only do so much."
Medicare regulations prohibit the
hospital from passing on the extra
costs to patients, he said. "Unless the
government is willing to pay what we
consider reasonable costs, we can't
provide the service.
"Right now hospitals are being put
in the middle because the government
is saying they're not going to pay for
all of it," he added.
Stanford Hospital is
"philosophically against making up the
loss by charging higher rates to their
patients," Carpenter said.
Exception
The Hospital is currently applying
to be given an exception to the
limitation, said Carpenter. He hopes
the federal government will make a
decision within the next few months.
"There's some debate internally as
to how much we've lost in the past
year," he said. "But the range of
figures is between $lOO,OOO and
$300,000."
Hospital administrators plan to
review the financial picture in the next
three months to decide whether to
continue dialysis experimentally or
permanently or to curtail the service.

Carpenter, former number-two man
on Nixon's price commission, made his
ominous statement on the same day
the University held dedication
ceremonies for the seven-bed
hemodialysis (artificial kidney
treatment) center, housed in a new
$lBO,OOO structure.
The center has seven dialysis chairs,
including one in a special isolation
room. The chairs will provide places
for patients whose kidneys have failed.
A kidney-failure victim must
receive dialysis treatment generally
three times per week. The treatment
involves purification of waste materials
in the blood, a process which takes
several hours.
Carpenter stressed that the hospital
officials "would never turn their backs
on patients already admitted into the
dialysis program."
Alternatives
However, he did say some other
alternatives to Stanford Hospital
dialysis treatment might become
necessary if the administrators chose
to phase out the new center.
Carpenter said patients could be
forced to transfer to other facilities or
learn to use new "home dialysis"
machines. The new machinery, which
is installed in a patient's home, is a less
complicated and less expensive process
of dialysis, Carpenter said.
However he admitted that data on
the new machines is not entirely up to
medical standards, and the new
machinery could mean a higher rate of
complication of illness for patients.

"philosophically against making up the
loss by charging higher rates to their
patients," Carpenter said.
Exception
The Hospital is currently applying
to be given an exception to the
limitation, said Carpenter. He hopes
the federal government will make a
decision within the next few months.
"There's some debate internally as
to how much we've lost in the past
year," he said. "But the range of
figures is between $lOO,OOO and
$300,000."
Hospital administrators plan to
review the financial picture in the next
three months to decide whether to
continue dialysis experimentally or
permanently or to curtail the service.

Carpenter, former number-two man
on Nixon's price commission, made his
ominous statement on the same day
the University held dedication
ceremonies for the seven-bed
hemodialysis (artificial kidney
treatment) center, housed in a new
$lBO,OOO structure.
The center has seven dialysis chairs,
including one in a special isolation
room. The chairs will provide places
for patients whose kidneys have failed.
A kidney-failure victim must
receive dialysis treatment generally
three times per week. The treatment
involves purification of waste materials
in the blood, a process which takes
several hours.
Carpenter stressed that the hospital
officials "would never turn their backs
on patients already admitted into the
dialysis program."
Alternatives
However, he did say some other
alternatives to Stanford Hospital
dialysis treatment might become
necessary if the administrators chose
to phase out the new center.
Carpenter said patients could be
forced to transfer to other facilities or
learn to use new "home dialysis"
machines. The new machinery, which
is installed in a patient's home, is a less
complicated and less expensive process
of dialysis, Carpenter said.
However he admitted that data on
the new machines is not entirely up to
medical standards, and the new
machinery could mean a higher rate of
complication of illness for patients.
Federal regulations may force
Stanford Hospital to close the doors of
its newly opened artificial kidney
treatment center within several
months, Peter Carpenter, vice
president for medical affairs, disclosed
Friday.
The center's kidney dialysis
treatment is mandatory for the
survival of patients who would
otherwise die of renal failure.

It is the expense of the treatment
which could force the University to
close the new center, according to
Carpenter. He said that the current
average cost for a dialysis session is
$lBB or about $30,000 per patient per
year.
Under the federal government's
Medicare program, patients over 65 are
for 80 percent of the cost
after the first three months.
In addition, the government pays

"reasonable costs" to hospitals
providing dialysis, but only up to $145
for a typical treatment, Carpenter said,
adding that hospitals end up absorbing
a $43 loss per treatment on the
average.
"We've tried to make what we
considered a reasonable effort to
reduce costs," he added, "but we can
only do so much."
Medicare regulations prohibit the
hospital from passing on the extra
costs to patients, he said. "Unless the
government is willing to pay what we
consider reasonable costs, we can't
provide the service.
"Right now hospitals are being put
in the middle because the government
is saying they're not going to pay for
all of it," he added.
