# New Scrum Pulls Through
## Ruggers Score 'Easy" Win 
### CHRIS BAKER 
In a home opener that
Stanford rugby coach Pete
Kmetovic described as "almost
too easy," the Card ruggers
decimated a hapless St. Mary's
squad, 33-4, Saturday, on Harry
Maloney field. The 29-point
margin was the largest opening
day total ever recorded by the
ruggers.
Going into Saturday's opener,
Kmetovic knew that his backfield
was "pretty strong," the only
question mark was the scrum,
where the graduation losses of
Gordy Riegel, Eric Test and John
Snider were expected to leave a
big dent in his plans.
The backfield's combined 20
years of rugby experience did
dominate play, as center Marty
O'Donahue scored four tries and
Ist 5/8 Lawrie Lieberman added
another try to go along with his
penalty kick and five conversions.
But the scrum of John Carrojf,

Geb Church, Chris Speilier and
Dave Morrison completely shut
down St. Mary's meagre offense.

Lieberman said the scrum
realized they had to take up the
slack because of the graduation
losses. "The fact that we lost all
those big guys from last year's
football team really made us go to
work. This was a grreat scrum
effort out there today," he said.

Just two minutes into the first
half the Cards displayed the
backfield precision that they were
to use all afternoon, as Lieberman
dazzled fans and St. Mary's alike
to start a break after Stanford
controlled the opening scrum.
Lawrie passed to 2nd 5/8 Bill

Conway, who faked back to
Lieberman, then passed to
fullback Rich McDonald, who
then tossed to O'Donahue for the
first of his four tries.
Another o'Donahue try and a
30-yard Lieberman penalty kick
gave the Cards a 15-0 half time
buldge.
But while the ruggers and
huggers were celebrating the
opening game victory at the
rugger kegger, one fan seemed to
put it all in prspective as he left
Harry Maloney field.
"Great win?" someone asked
him.
"When they play a real team
I'll say that."
