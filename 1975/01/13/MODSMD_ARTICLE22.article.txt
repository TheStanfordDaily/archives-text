# Swimmers Sparkle In Home Meet
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
It was obvious that someone
forgot to tell the Stanford
swimmers that they were
supposed to be the host of last
Friday's Relay meet, as they
rudely splashed to a victory over
five other teams.
The Cards, with a total of 149
points, captured first place in
eight of 12 events, and never
finished worse than third in any
relay. The swimmers were led by
freshman Mike Bruner, who
particularly sparkled in his anchor
of the 1600-yard freestyle relay.
Sprinter Dave Fairbank also
turned in a fine performance,
clocking a 45.5 in the 100-yard
freestyle.
In addition to Bruner and
Fairbank, Card coach Jim
Gaughran praised the efforts of
Breaststroker John Hencken,
Butterflyer Brian Roux, and
Freestylers Craig Van Zandt and
Ron Longinotti.
The stage is now set for
Friday's big dual meet with the
University of Washington in
Seattle. The Huskies, bolstered by
Olympians Rick Demont and
Robin Backhouse, will be seeking
vengeance for last year's loss to
Stanford.
