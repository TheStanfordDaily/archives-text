# Crowd Boosts Card Gymnasts

### 
Stanford's own endangered
species, the gymnastics team, lost
its season opener last Friday
night, but received much moral
support from spectators.
A crowd of 800 watched the
Cards finish third in a close
three-way meet with Cal and USC.
The Bears took first with 209.6
points, followed by the Trojans
with 199.3 and Stanford with

192.8.
A petition was circulated in the
lobby of Maples, asking that
gymnastics not be eliminated
from the University varsity
intercollegiate program.
It read, "If using Encina Gym as
a recreational facility for
basketball, volleyball and
badminton means dropping
gymnastics and wrestling from the
varsity, club, and even physical
education levels, I do not want
Encina Gym to be used for
recreational facilities."
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
informed gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada, as well as wrestling
coach Joe DeMeo, that increased
demands by intramural and club
sports for facilities may force an
end to varsity status for their
respective sports.
Hamada said he hoped
gymnastics will remain here. "Our
program is nationally recognized,
and the sport is growing."

The Cards collected two firsts
during the meet. Bob Anderson
won the opening floor exercise,
and Ted Marcy, who won the
NCAA side horse championship
last year, took that event with a
crowd-pleasing performance.
