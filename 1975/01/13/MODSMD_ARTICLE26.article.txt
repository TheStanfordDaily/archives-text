Dan DeGroot to record a
cleansweep 15-9, 15-7, 16-14
victory over a Stanford All-Star
team yesterday afternoon in
Maples Pavilion.
UCSB led from the start,
totally controlled the better
portion of the first two games and
then made a furious comeback to
seal victory in the third game.
Stanford, under the leadership of
alumni All-Stars Paul Krause and
Jim lams, surged to an early 7-3
lead in that final game before the
awesome combination of DeGroot
and Gregory reasserted itself
on a series of high and short sets
to bring UCSB back to an 8-6

deficit.
Later, after Stanford moved to
game point at 14-11 on a series of
clever dinks and spikes by Krause,
UCSB's U.S. World team member
Jon Roberst went to work,
blocking two attempted hits by
Stanford and then serving an ace
to tie the count at 14-all. A bad
Stanford pass and a long hit ended
the match quickly.
Stanford led at one point in
the second game, 5-0, before
mental lapses and the hitting of
DeGroot and Eric Pavels earned
the Gauchos 15 of the next 17
points and the easy victory.
The initial game was a see-saw
affair in the early going, tied at
5-all before Santa Barbara went
on an eight-out-of-nine point tear
for a 13-6 lead and the eventual
15-9 advantage.
