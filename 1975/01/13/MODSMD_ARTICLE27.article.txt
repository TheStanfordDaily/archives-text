McCarthy To Seek Presidency
MADISON, Wis. Former U.S. Sen. Eugene
McCarthy, declaring the Democratic party has
begun to "hedge and compromise" too much,
announced last night his candidacy as an
independent for the presidency of the United
States.
McCarthy issued his formal announcement
before some 400 well wishers at a theater in
downtown Madison, a city in which he drew solid
support in his unsuccessful 1968 bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
McCarthy's candidacy was boosted by the
Wisconsin Committee for a Constitutional
Presidency.
Soviet Cosmonauts, Satellite Dock
MOSCOW Two Soviet cosmonauts set up
housekeeping yesterday in a space research station
after their Soyuz 17 vehicle hooked up with the
orbiting Salyut 4, Tass reported.
Then they went to sleep, preparing for a
"strenuous work day" today, their third day in
space, the Soviet news agency said.
Commander Alexei Gubarv and flight engineer
Georgy Grechko, both first-timers in space,
accomplished the docking maneuver "brilliantly,"
having taken over control from the Soyuz's
automatic pilot 390 feet from the Salyut station,
according to the report from Moscow's flight
control center.
Soyuz 17 blasted off Saturday from Baikonur

space center in Central Asia. The Salyut 4 space
laboratory was put into orbit two weeks earlier.
Israel: Troops Battle In Lebanon
TEL AVIV Israeli forces crossed into southern
Lebanon early today for the second night in
succession. The Israeli military command said the
raiders destroyed five houses including one from
which a guerilla fired on them.
One Israeli soldier was injured, the command
said. It gave no report on Arab casualties.
The Israelis said their forces destroyed four
houses in the village of Halqa that it was believed
were used by Palestinian guerrillas.
In the village of Shuba, the Israeli command said,
the raiders came under fire from a guerrilla in a
house, and the house was destroyed by Israeli fire.
Both villages were in the southeast corner of
Lebanon, the area where guerrillas wounded four
members of an Israeli patrol on Mt. Hermon
Saturday and where the Israeli command said its
raiders blew up three bridges and two water
conduits and killed one guerrilla in a brief skirmish
early yesterday.
The Israeli command said its forces suffered no
casualties in the raid yesterday.
A Palestinaian guerrilla communique said the
"enemy force [of 200] was repulsed and barred
from entering Kfar Chouba" with heavy Israeli
losses. Guerrilla casualties were reported as three
wounded and two missing.
Rebels Tie Up Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Insurgents attacked
the key Mekong River town of Neak Luong from
three sides yesterday in an apparent effort to choke
off Phnom Penh's major remaining lifeline.
Military sources said the last government enclave
on the river bank opposite the town had been
abandoned, giving the rebels uncontested control of
a large stretch of Highway 1.
But the sources said more important was the
attempt to cut off permanently the Mekong as the
last major supply line to the capital. All roads to the
capital have long been cut off and most of the
supplies from South Vietnam and Thailand arrived
by river.
There has been no traffic along the Mekong since
the rebels began their offensive New Year's day and
seized sections of Highway 1.
In South Vietnam, government troops backed by
heavy air strikes reportedly breached a Communist
siege of Hoai Due, a district town 75 miles northeast
of Saigon.

Nixon's Taxes Remain Unpaid
WASHINGTON Former President Nixon has
not paid the back taxes he agreed to pay for 1969, a
spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service said
yesterday.
The IRS ruled last April that Nixon owed
$432,787 in back taxes, including a 5 percent
negligence penalty, for the years 1969 through
1972, as well as interest for 1970-72.
The President agreed to pay without a contest,
including $148,081 for 1969, on which the statute
of limitations had expired.
The President has paid what he owed for the
years 1970 through 1972, the spokesman said. But
he quoted IRS Commissioner Donald C. Alexander
as saying Nixon has not paid the 1969 sum.

Soviet Cosmonauts, Satellite Dock
MOSCOW Two Soviet cosmonauts set up
housekeeping yesterday in a space research station
after their Soyuz 17 vehicle hooked up with the
orbiting Salyut 4, Tass reported.
Then they went to sleep, preparing for a
"strenuous work day" today, their third day in
space, the Soviet news agency said.
Commander Alexei Gubarv and flight engineer
Georgy Grechko, both first-timers in space,
accomplished the docking maneuver "brilliantly,"
having taken over control from the Soyuz's
automatic pilot 390 feet from the Salyut station,
according to the report from Moscow's flight
control center.
Soyuz 17 blasted off Saturday from Baikonur

space center in Central Asia. The Salyut 4 space
laboratory was put into orbit two weeks earlier.
Israel: Troops Battle In Lebanon
TEL AVIV Israeli forces crossed into southern
Lebanon early today for the second night in
succession. The Israeli military command said the
raiders destroyed five houses including one from
which a guerilla fired on them.
One Israeli soldier was injured, the command
said. It gave no report on Arab casualties.
The Israelis said their forces destroyed four
houses in the village of Halqa that it was believed
were used by Palestinian guerrillas.
In the village of Shuba, the Israeli command said,
the raiders came under fire from a guerrilla in a
house, and the house was destroyed by Israeli fire.
Both villages were in the southeast corner of
Lebanon, the area where guerrillas wounded four
members of an Israeli patrol on Mt. Hermon
Saturday and where the Israeli command said its
raiders blew up three bridges and two water
conduits and killed one guerrilla in a brief skirmish
early yesterday.
The Israeli command said its forces suffered no
casualties in the raid yesterday.
A Palestinaian guerrilla communique said the
"enemy force [of 200] was repulsed and barred
from entering Kfar Chouba" with heavy Israeli
losses. Guerrilla casualties were reported as three
wounded and two missing.
Rebels Tie Up Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Insurgents attacked
the key Mekong River town of Neak Luong from
three sides yesterday in an apparent effort to choke
off Phnom Penh's major remaining lifeline.
Military sources said the last government enclave
on the river bank opposite the town had been
abandoned, giving the rebels uncontested control of
a large stretch of Highway 1.
But the sources said more important was the
attempt to cut off permanently the Mekong as the
last major supply line to the capital. All roads to the
capital have long been cut off and most of the
supplies from South Vietnam and Thailand arrived
by river.
There has been no traffic along the Mekong since
the rebels began their offensive New Year's day and
seized sections of Highway 1.
In South Vietnam, government troops backed by
heavy air strikes reportedly breached a Communist
siege of Hoai Due, a district town 75 miles northeast
of Saigon.

Nixon's Taxes Remain Unpaid

McCarthy To Seek Presidency
MADISON, Wis. Former U.S. Sen. Eugene
McCarthy, declaring the Democratic party has
begun to "hedge and compromise" too much,
announced last night his candidacy as an
independent for the presidency of the United
States.
McCarthy issued his formal announcement
before some 400 well wishers at a theater in
downtown Madison, a city in which he drew solid
support in his unsuccessful 1968 bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
McCarthy's candidacy was boosted by the
Wisconsin Committee for a Constitutional
Presidency.
Soviet Cosmonauts, Satellite Dock
MOSCOW Two Soviet cosmonauts set up
housekeeping yesterday in a space research station
after their Soyuz 17 vehicle hooked up with the
orbiting Salyut 4, Tass reported.
Then they went to sleep, preparing for a
"strenuous work day" today, their third day in
space, the Soviet news agency said.
Commander Alexei Gubarv and flight engineer
Georgy Grechko, both first-timers in space,
accomplished the docking maneuver "brilliantly,"
having taken over control from the Soyuz's
automatic pilot 390 feet from the Salyut station,
according to the report from Moscow's flight
control center.
Soyuz 17 blasted off Saturday from Baikonur

space center in Central Asia. The Salyut 4 space
laboratory was put into orbit two weeks earlier.
Israel: Troops Battle In Lebanon
TEL AVIV Israeli forces crossed into southern
Lebanon early today for the second night in
succession. The Israeli military command said the
raiders destroyed five houses including one from
which a guerilla fired on them.
One Israeli soldier was injured, the command
said. It gave no report on Arab casualties.
The Israelis said their forces destroyed four
houses in the village of Halqa that it was believed
were used by Palestinian guerrillas.
In the village of Shuba, the Israeli command said,
the raiders came under fire from a guerrilla in a
house, and the house was destroyed by Israeli fire.
Both villages were in the southeast corner of
Lebanon, the area where guerrillas wounded four
members of an Israeli patrol on Mt. Hermon
Saturday and where the Israeli command said its
raiders blew up three bridges and two water
conduits and killed one guerrilla in a brief skirmish
early yesterday.
The Israeli command said its forces suffered no
casualties in the raid yesterday.
A Palestinaian guerrilla communique said the
"enemy force [of 200] was repulsed and barred
from entering Kfar Chouba" with heavy Israeli
losses. Guerrilla casualties were reported as three
wounded and two missing.
Rebels Tie Up Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Insurgents attacked
the key Mekong River town of Neak Luong from
three sides yesterday in an apparent effort to choke
off Phnom Penh's major remaining lifeline.
Military sources said the last government enclave
on the river bank opposite the town had been
abandoned, giving the rebels uncontested control of
a large stretch of Highway 1.
But the sources said more important was the
attempt to cut off permanently the Mekong as the
last major supply line to the capital. All roads to the
capital have long been cut off and most of the
supplies from South Vietnam and Thailand arrived
by river.
There has been no traffic along the Mekong since
the rebels began their offensive New Year's day and
seized sections of Highway 1.
In South Vietnam, government troops backed by
heavy air strikes reportedly breached a Communist
siege of Hoai Due, a district town 75 miles northeast
of Saigon.
