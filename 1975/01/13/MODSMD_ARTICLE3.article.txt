## Oil Funds Aid Energy Institute

The TV commercial resembles a
continuation of the evening news;
as the camera pans across busy
research laboratories and offshore
oil drilling platform construction
sites, the narrator-reporter explains
how oil companies are combining
efforts to produce more energy
with consumer efforts to save
energy.
"We're interested in the total
energy picture," says Robert J.
Randolph, counsel for public
relations in education at Stanford
Oil of California. "We are looking
for ways to assist the Campaign for
Stanford [the University's ongoing
$3OO million fundraising drive] and
at the same time do something of
direct benefit to our own
interests."
The interests of Standard Oil
and other major oil-producers are
reflected in substantial gifts and
pledges to the Stanford Institute
for Energy Studies.

The Institute is an
interdisciplinary center for the
development of research and
teaching related to energy problems
and policies. It was founded less
than one year ago with $lO,OOO in
"seed money" from annual alumni
gifts to the Engineering
Department.
The initial grant catalyzed
$135,000 in corporate support
during the 1973-74 academic year.
"It has practically all been
corporate oil," says William M.
Kays, dean of the Engineering
School.
Gifts from non-corporate
sources last year totalled only
$l2OO. And corporate backers have
pledged at least $550,000 in
donations to the Institute over the
next five years.
The Institute's first annual
report, prepared by Prof. William C.
Reynolds, chairman of Mechanical
Engineering, acknowledges
"corporate supporters who provide
the financial resources that really

enable the program to have an
impact at Stanford ... The
Institute's success is truly theirs to
share."
According to the report, last
year's major contributions came
from Union Oil, Standard Oil,
Mobil Oil, Gulf Oil, General
Electric and the Pacific Gas and
Electric Company.
Standard Oil of California, based
in San Francisco, has contributed
more than anyone else, notes Kays.
"We're also working with Exxon.
They're not a local company, but
they're awfully big," he adds.
Contributions to the Institute
support a new campus energy
information center, energy systems
studies by students in Engineering
235, and a program of energy
seminars.
Featuring talks by visiting
experts, last year's seminar program
included "The U.S. Oil Supply in
the Light of the International
Situation" by Shell Oil
Vice-President Keith Doig, and
"World Energy Futures" by
Thomas Paine, senior vice-president
at General Electric.
But nearly half of the Institute's
income last year was spent for
research initiation, the report
reveals. "A good number of
universities have established similar
programs," Reynolds points out.
"Ours wasn't the first and it won't
be the last."
Reynolds |f||says Stanford's
interdepartmental approach to
energy is unique: "We use a system
that reinforces faculty in their own
departments. We won't pull anyone
out of his department interest for
research."
Like many energy-related
industries, Standard Oil "sponsors
general research that is of specific
interest to the company," explains
Randolph. "Our people in
fundamental research keep their
hands in what's happening, and we
want to support the people who do
well in the field."
But quality research capabilities
alone are not always enough to
induce a major corporate
commitment. "In the case of
Stanford's energy institute we were
approached and we tried to design a
program that was of mutual
interest," Randolph says.

EUCALYPTUS ENERGY—Students in Engineering 235, an advanced
energy systems class, have devised a method for producing energy from
eucalyptus trees. The class project is one of many energy activities funded
by substantial oil company gifts to the Stanford Institute for Energy
Studies.
