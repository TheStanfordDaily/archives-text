## Oil Funds Aid Energy Institute 
### TERRY ANZUR First of two parts 
The TV commercial resembles a
continuation of the evening news;
as the camera pans across busy
research laboratories and offshore
oil drilling platform construction
sites, the narrator-reporter explains
how oil companies are combining
efforts to produce more energy
with consumer efforts to save
energy.
"We're interested in the total
energy picture," says Robert J.
Randolph, counsel for public
relations in education at Stanford
Oil of California. "We are looking
for ways to assist the Campaign for
Stanford [the University's ongoing
$3OO million fundraising drive] and
at the same time do something of
direct benefit to our own
interests."
The interests of Standard Oil
and other major oil-producers are
reflected in substantial gifts and
pledges to the Stanford Institute
for Energy Studies.

The Institute is an
interdisciplinary center for the
development of research and
teaching related to energy problems
and policies. It was founded less
than one year ago with $lO,OOO in
"seed money" from annual alumni
gifts to the Engineering
Department.
The initial grant catalyzed
$135,000 in corporate support
during the 1973-74 academic year.
"It has practically all been
corporate oil," says William M.
Kays, dean of the Engineering
School.
Gifts from non-corporate
sources last year totalled only
$l2OO. And corporate backers have
pledged at least $550,000 in
donations to the Institute over the
next five years.
The Institute's first annual
report, prepared by Prof. William C.
Reynolds, chairman of Mechanical
Engineering, acknowledges
"corporate supporters who provide
the financial resources that really

enable the program to have an
impact at Stanford ... The
Institute's success is truly theirs to
share."
According to the report, last
year's major contributions came
from Union Oil, Standard Oil,
Mobil Oil, Gulf Oil, General
Electric and the Pacific Gas and
Electric Company.
Standard Oil of California, based
in San Francisco, has contributed
more than anyone else, notes Kays.
"We're also working with Exxon.
They're not a local company, but
they're awfully big," he adds.
Contributions to the Institute
support a new campus energy
information center, energy systems
studies by students in Engineering
235, and a program of energy
seminars.
Featuring talks by visiting
experts, last year's seminar program
included "The U.S. Oil Supply in
the Light of the International
Situation" by Shell Oil
Vice-President Keith Doig, and
"World Energy Futures" by
Thomas Paine, senior vice-president
at General Electric.
But nearly half of the Institute's
income last year was spent for
research initiation, the report
reveals. "A good number of
universities have established similar
programs," Reynolds points out.
"Ours wasn't the first and it won't
be the last."
Reynolds |f||says Stanford's
interdepartmental approach to
energy is unique: "We use a system
that reinforces faculty in their own
departments. We won't pull anyone
out of his department interest for
research."
Like many energy-related
industries, Standard Oil "sponsors
general research that is of specific
interest to the company," explains
Randolph. "Our people in
fundamental research keep their
hands in what's happening, and we
want to support the people who do
well in the field."
But quality research capabilities
alone are not always enough to
induce a major corporate
commitment. "In the case of
Stanford's energy institute we were
approached and we tried to design a
program that was of mutual
interest," Randolph says.

EUCALYPTUS ENERGYâ€”Students in Engineering 235, an advanced
energy systems class, have devised a method for producing energy from
eucalyptus trees. The class project is one of many energy activities funded
by substantial oil company gifts to the Stanford Institute for Energy
Studies.
Much of the force behind the
Institute's momentum comes from
an aggressive fundraising strategy.
"The trick is matching the interest
of the company with the interest of
Stanford," comments Assoc.
General Secretary Dwain Fullerton.
"We've had a continuous effort
with the GSO [General Secretary's
Office]," Kays elaborates. "They
decide how much a company ought
to give. Then an approach is made
by the president or the provost.
The next step is bringing corporate
people here for a visit. That's where
we come in."
When oil company
representatives visit Stanford "we
set them up to see energy activities
that will be of interest to them,"
continues Reynolds. Among the
main attractions are projects
developing solar energy, MHD
energy conversion and the
stratocharge engine, Reynolds says.
Corporate visitors also meet
students in Engineering 235, an
advanced energy systems class that
has devised a method for producing
energy from eucalyptus trees.
"We try to make sure that the

visitor is a scientist in his own right
both a scientist and a
businessman," Fullerton points out.
Keeping in mind the necessity of
reducing the University's operating
budget deficit, fundraisers "are
looking for ways to raise more
money at less cost," says Fullerton.
However, corporate fundraising
efforts "were already stepped up to
the limit when the Campaign for
Stanford began," argues Kays.
"Businessmen aren't responding
to our $lO million cry of alarm,"
agrees Fullerton. They don't believe
Stanford is going broke. They live
with the ups and downs of business
cycles daily and they expect us to
do the same."
Fullerton claims Stanford's
fundraising efforts are successful
because "our faculty is so good.
Visitors pay their own way, and
when they see the quality of what's
going on here, we do very well."
This fundraising formula has
been so successful that "any
company who's got a problem feels
the responsibility to give money,"
notes William F. Massy, vice
provost for research.
