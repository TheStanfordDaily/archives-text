# Lyman Criticizes Drastic Cutbacks
## 
### JOHN FREED 
President Richard Lyman warned
faculty members Friday against
"cutthroat" activities during upcoming
budget trimmings, claiming University
financial woes have sometimes been
overplayed.
"I have heard and read statements
that seem to me very serious
exaggerations of the likely
consequences of budget reductions,"
Lyman told listeners at the winter
quarter meeting of the Academic
Council.
"If we keep our wits about us,
there is no reason to believe that we
are about to be captured by
mediocrity or worse," he added.
Lyman advised about 150 faculty
members against succumbing to
divisive forces during budget cutting.
"The atmosphere created by
predictions of impending doom
contributes to a set of destructive
pressures that inevitably accompany
financial bad news," Lyman stated.
"There develops ... [an] every man
for himself attitude; competition in
heading for the lifeboats is notoriously
cutthroat."
'Reasonably Soon'
However, major fiscal decisions
must be made "reasonably soon,"

Lyman continued.
"There is no reason to think that
time is on our side in this matter.
There is reason to believe that it is
not," Lyman remarked.
In a meeting last Thursday, some
members of the Faculty Senate had
expressed concern that they were not
being fully consulted on
budget-cutting decisions. Lyman
acknowledged the Administration's
responsibility in keeping the
University community informed on
money matters.
'Clear And Open'
"It is incumbent upon us to be as
clear and open as possible in
explaining where we are, how we got
there, and how we propose to get
out," Lyman admitted.
But he cut off hopes of some
Senate members that they might have
final review of budgeting actions.
"The budgeting process depends on
a prolonged and often fast-moving
process of continuous negotiation,"
Lyman noted. "It does not provide
convenient stopping places at which
the whole thing can be lined up and
presented to a representative body, be
it the Senate or any other, for
conclusive comment and review."
Hamstrung
Lyman claimed that the Univeristy
Budget Priorities Advisory
Commission was created to "make
some inroads on this problem." But
the commissioners, as Lyman
conceded, have been hamstrung by
lack of time and complexity of the
issues they face.
"Perhaps put a little too simply, the
commission has been wrestling with
the problem of how to assure that it
will in fact be adequately involved and
consulted about the major questions,
without becoming bogged down in the
details of lesser ones," Lyman
explained.
Lyman condemned as "suicidal"
recent actions by certain colleges
which increased competition among
higher educational institutions.
Impact
"We have the example ... of a
major state system of higher education
seeking to reduce its tuition by 50
percent so as to improve , its
competitive position in seeking to
maintain enrollments. Apparently this
recommendation was made without
regard for the impact of such a move
upon the private sector," Lyman
related.
"We have nothing to gain, and a
very great deal to lose, if we follow
our baser instincts and tear each other
apart over these money matters," he
elaborated.
Lyman defended inclusion of a one
percent annual allocation for "funded
improvements"â€”support for new
programs or for old ones which lost
outside funding. In recent years, about
2.7 percent of the budget has gone for
such improvements, Lyman noted.
"We simply doubt that we can press
this entire element in the annual
budget down to zero without seriously
harming the adaptability of the
institution," Lyman concluded.
