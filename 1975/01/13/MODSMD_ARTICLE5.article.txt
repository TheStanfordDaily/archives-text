# Halliburton To Head New Center For Study Of Educational Issues
## 
### RANDY PHILLIPS 
Assoc. English Prof. David Halliburton will direct the
new Center for Teaching and Learning established by a
grant of $246,000 from the Danforth Foundation, it was
announced last week.
Halliburton said the Center will take "an introspective
look" at a wide spectrum of issues concerning
contemporary education. These include graduate student
teaching and guidance for young faculty as well as
mid-career renewal and reorientation.
The Center also plans to collaborate with faculty at
other Bay Area colleges and universities to improve
teaching and learning.
In an interview Friday, Halliburton stressed Stanford's
enormous wealth of teaching talent as its greatest
contribution to the Center. In addition to hosting lectures
throughout the academic year, the Center will sponsor two
summer conferences.
These conferences will consist of workshops where a
colloquium atmosphere will bring gifted teachers from
other institutions together for "open and frank
discussions," he said.
The Stanford Center is one of several organizations being
established nationally by the Danforth Foundation, which
has sought to improve the quality of teaching and learning
since it was created by the late Mr. and Mrs. William H.
Danforth in 1927.
Principal Supporter
Each center will have its own approach and the Stanford
Center will be the principal supporter of a Bay Area
conference on teaching women's history planned for Jan.
25.
Halliburton emphasized that the Center will be
especially concerned with foreign language studies, the

college level writing dilemma as recently publicized by
UC-Berkeley, ethnic studies, mathematics, performing arts,
instruction, the problems faced by the newly matriculated
and older undergraduates and the transition from high
school to college.
In light of the ongoing debate about the conflict
between the teaching and research functions of universities,
Halliburton said, "We hope to receive strong administrative
support of teaching as a career in itself... We want to
legitimize teaching by arousing the liberal consciousness."
Analogy
He drew an analogy between the Center and "the back
to nature movement, the idea of trimming to principal
resources." According to Halliburton, this means "getting
more from our teachers."
Halliburton sees "the first signs of groundswell" of
faculty interest in improved teaching.
This is not only aimed at teaching assistants, he said, but
also "at tenured professors who may suffer from a state of
accidial," which he described as flatness of intellect, a loss
of enthusiasm, which affects teaching even more critically
than research, since the negative mood is communicated
personally and immediately to students."
Having received his B.A. and Ph.D. from UC-Riverside,
Halliburton has been a member of the faculty here since
1966. He has worked extensively with undergraduates in
honors programs and served as acting chairman of the
interdisciplinary program in Modern Thought and
Literature and in the Comparative Literature Program.
When asked if he plans to continue teaching while
directing the Center, Halliburton said he is planning a
colloquium for Autumn 1976, entitled "National and
International Identity." Paraphrasing Seneca, "People learn
while they teach," he said.

faculty interest in improved teaching.
This is not only aimed at teaching assistants, he said, but
also "at tenured professors who may suffer from a state of
accidial," which he described as flatness of intellect, a loss
of enthusiasm, which affects teaching even more critically
than research, since the negative mood is communicated
personally and immediately to students."
Having received his B.A. and Ph.D. from UC-Riverside,
Halliburton has been a member of the faculty here since
1966. He has worked extensively with undergraduates in
honors programs and served as acting chairman of the
interdisciplinary program in Modern Thought and
Literature and in the Comparative Literature Program.
When asked if he plans to continue teaching while
directing the Center, Halliburton said he is planning a
colloquium for Autumn 1976, entitled "National and
International Identity." Paraphrasing Seneca, "People learn
while they teach," he said.
Assoc. English Prof. David Halliburton will direct the
new Center for Teaching and Learning established by a
grant of $246,000 from the Danforth Foundation, it was
announced last week.
Halliburton said the Center will take "an introspective
look" at a wide spectrum of issues concerning
contemporary education. These include graduate student
teaching and guidance for young faculty as well as
mid-career renewal and reorientation.
The Center also plans to collaborate with faculty at
other Bay Area colleges and universities to improve
teaching and learning.
In an interview Friday, Halliburton stressed Stanford's
enormous wealth of teaching talent as its greatest
contribution to the Center. In addition to hosting lectures
throughout the academic year, the Center will sponsor two
summer conferences.
These conferences will consist of workshops where a
colloquium atmosphere will bring gifted teachers from
other institutions together for "open and frank
discussions," he said.
The Stanford Center is one of several organizations being
established nationally by the Danforth Foundation, which
has sought to improve the quality of teaching and learning
since it was created by the late Mr. and Mrs. William H.
Danforth in 1927.
Principal Supporter
Each center will have its own approach and the Stanford
Center will be the principal supporter of a Bay Area
conference on teaching women's history planned for Jan.
25.
Halliburton emphasized that the Center will be
especially concerned with foreign language studies, the

college level writing dilemma as recently publicized by
UC-Berkeley, ethnic studies, mathematics, performing arts,
instruction, the problems faced by the newly matriculated
and older undergraduates and the transition from high
school to college.
In light of the ongoing debate about the conflict
between the teaching and research functions of universities,
Halliburton said, "We hope to receive strong administrative
support of teaching as a career in itself... We want to
legitimize teaching by arousing the liberal consciousness."
Analogy
He drew an analogy between the Center and "the back
to nature movement, the idea of trimming to principal
resources." According to Halliburton, this means "getting
more from our teachers."
Halliburton sees "the first signs of groundswell" of
faculty interest in improved teaching.
This is not only aimed at teaching assistants, he said, but
also "at tenured professors who may suffer from a state of
