# False Impression
## 
### Azike Ntephe 
Until I read Kathy Alcala's call
for more minority input, (Daily,
Jan 10), I was under the
impression that the lack of
minority news was due to lack of
cooperation from the minorities.
For a paper that prides itself on
being professional, I had thought
the Daily and its staff are
dedicated to ferreting out all
events in and near the campus for
the information and
entertainment of its readers.
Now I know I am wrong.
Alcala has just confirmed I had
been laboring under wrong
impressions. I am grateful to her.
"The news editors give the
following reasons for not running
more stories on minority affairs:
"Stories in the Daily should be
of interest to most of the students
on campus."
I don't know where the editors
got that cant, but stories have
always tended to interest different
minority groups. Hence, editors
publish different stories. Even the
sports page, which is one of the
widely read pages, appeals to
small segments of readers
football, tennis and basketball
fans go to stories of their interest.
Poorly Written Stories
"Stories which have been
submitted in the past by minority
students have been too poorly
written for publication,"
according to Alcala.
I do not expect news editors to
publish poorly written articles;
but such pieces, at their worst, do
often have some merit and a staff
writer could rewrite them.
Suggestions could be made to the
original writer to help him in
rewriting. Working for a campus
newspaper either as a staff or
guest writer is supposed to be a
learning experience and the Daily
could be of tremendous help in
this regard.
The insinuation here is that
minority students are poor
writers. This is distasteful. But
even if all minority writers cannot
write clearly and provocatively,
they deserve to be read.

So long have others spoken for
us that we are bursting at the
seams to be heard. The fact that
some of us pluck the courage to
write in our 'crude' style only to
be charged with poor writing
simply shows how long it is taking
this nation to translate civil rights
victories into actual conditions for
all minorities.
But, if all articles were
superbly written,what would most
of the editors be doing?
"One of the opinion editors,
who recently received two letters
signed 'MEChA,' will not run a
column which is not signed by a
specific person or people, in
accordance with Daily policy."
The policy regarding signed
articles is 'prominently' displayed
on the editorial page in small
print. But MEChA must have
meant something to one of the
editors, something that could have
led him to a group that wants to
be heard but was unaware of
that small print.
Unsigned Articles
Policies are for guidance. I
would hope that unsigned articles
with some verifiable facts would
be further investigated and
published for its content. A lot of
good stuff comes to the
newspaper offices unsigned.
Everything notwithstanding,
Alcala's call for more input is in
order. The Daily, like most
campus papers, need the
cooperation of the college
community. Staff reporters
cannot be at all places at all times
and the paper's readers should be
its eyes and ears.
Readers cannot cooperate,
however, if their attempt at
expressing themselves are met
with scorn. If they were
professional writers they would
have other avenues at their disposal.
Nobody expects the Daily to
publish trash or everything that
comes its way, but crude writings
could be made more readable.
And space and time permitting, all
that is fit to print should be.
