Your coverage of the
controversial $6.6 million Willow
Road widening and improvement
project has been particularly
depressing to me, both personally
and as a member of the Stanford
and Palo Alto community.
The final statement of Mark
Funk's article (Daily, Jan. 10)
summarizes the inadequacies in
your reporting as well as the
shortcomings of Stanford's
position with respect to this
project: "It all boils down to
dollars and cents."

If there is one thing clear about
the controversy surrounding this
project, it is that the issue is not
solely economic. Rather, the
Willow Road project involves
plans for a regional linear park
(Midpeninsula Regional Park
District), increased traffic
congestion that could ultimately
lead to the even more
controversial Willow Road
Expressway, as well as one of the
final remaining natural ecosystems
in Palo Alto.
The University's position, as
stated by James Nelson, director
of facilities and properties, is that
any alternative that does not go
through the grove of trees and,
thus, infringes in any degree on
the parking lot is unacceptable.
Funk's article states that this
position is likely to be upheld by

the City Council by a "5-3 or 6-2
margin."
This is a classical example of an
approach to decision-making that
is not willing to consider the
environmental or social effects of
its economic decisions. This
mentality has produced the
large-scale environmental and
social problems of today's society.

It has also lead to legislation
requiring public decision makers to
consider the environmental effects
of their decisions most notably
the California Environmental
Quality Act and the National
Environmental Policy Act. Thus,
the City Council must consider
environmental factors in its
decision.

As a consultant in urban and
environmental planning, and a
graduate student in environmental
planning at Stanford, I sincerely
hope that the City Council
seriously considers the
environmental and social
implications of their decision on
the Willow Road project.
If the Council considers only
the economic implications, like
Stanford University, then its
decision will be an easy one and it
will surely support Funk's
prediction.
