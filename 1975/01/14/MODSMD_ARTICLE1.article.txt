# Ford Plans Tax Cut To Fight Recession
## 
### 
"WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford proposed a $l6-billion
anti-recession tax cut last night, asking
Congress to vote cash rebates of up to
$lOOO for individual taxpayers.
Ford outlined a $46-billion
economic and energy package in a
nationally broadcast address, calling
for higher taxes on oil and natural gas
that experts said could increase retail
gasoline prices by about a nickle a
gallon.
As Ford was telling Americans "we
are in trouble" with a deepening
recession, White House officials were
spelling out details of proposals he will
present to Congress in his State of the
Union message tomorrow.
That address to Congress, the
officials said, will call for permanent
reductions in the tax rates for
individuals, a cut from 48 percent to
42 percent in the corporate tax rate, a
doubling of the low-income tax
allowance and a $l5O tax credit for
homeowners who insulate their houses
or take other energy-saving steps.
'We Have No Choice'
In his 20-minute television and
radio address, Ford declared "we have
no choice" but to put "our domestic
house in order." The program he
outlined to the public included these
major points:
—The immediate tax cut
implemented by giving 12 percent cash
rebates, up to a maximum of $lOOO
per tax return, to individuals based on
their 1974 tax payments.
—Higher taxes on foreign and
domestic oil, natural gas and windfall
profits of oil producers, to bring in
$3O billion, which would be returned
to the economy under procedures.
Tax Credit
Ford did not describe in detail in
his speech:
—A one-year increase in the
investment tax credit to 12 percent,
this giving industry a $4-billion tax

break to spur plant expansion and
create more jobs.
—A one-year moratorium on new
federal spending programs to hold
down the budget deficit, and a 5
percent limit on increases in federal
salaries and pension benefits paid frpm
the U.S. Treasury.
—An oil allocation program to
insure such areas as New England of
adequate fuel, a five-year delay on
stiffer auto pollution standards and
stepped-up energy conservation efforts
to cut foreign oil imports by one
million barrels a day this year.
'May Get Rougher'
Speaking from the White House
library, Ford declared that "right now
the going is rough and it may get
rougher." But he said that "if we do
what must be done" to lift the nation
out of a deepening recession "we will
be on our way to better days."
Ford was not specific in his speech
on how the $3O billion in "energy tax
revenues" would be raised and how it
then would be returned to the
economy.
But White House officials gave
newsmen an outline of the detailed
program the President will present to
Congress tomorrow. They said the
steps he would propose included:
Crude Oil Tariff
—An immediate tariff on foreign
crude oil, starting at $1 and going to
$3 a barrel in three months. This
would be done by executive order,
without congressional action.
—A recommendation that Congress
place a $2-per-barrel excise tax on
domestic oil and an equivalent tax on
natural gas amounting to 37 cents per
1000 cubic feet. When these taxes go
into effect, the tariff on foreign oil
would then be reduced to $2 a barrel.
—A windfall profits tax on oil
producers which officials estimated

combat what he called "a deepening recession." The package includes a $16
billion tax rebate on 1974 taxes and increased taxes on crude oil imports. Ford

would bring in more than $l2 billion.
Coupled with the $lB billion they said
would be raised by the levies on oil
and natural gas, this would give the
federal Treasury $3O billion which
then would be redistributed.
Under Ford's plan, officials said
there would be permanent downward
adjustments in the tax rates on
individuals. They refused to give
specifics, but did say the corporate tax
rate would be cut from 48 percent to
42 percent for 1975 under the Ford
plan, thus reducing corporate taxes by
$6 billion.
They said Ford also will ask that
individuals who pay no income taxes
because of low earnings be granted
cash payments of about $BO per
person, and that the current $l3OO
low incopie allowance for couples be
increased to $2600. Families earning
less than this amount would not be
required to file annual returns.

and natural gas, this would give the
federal Treasury $3O billion which
then would be redistributed.
Under Ford's plan, officials said
there would be permanent downward
adjustments in the tax rates on
individuals. They refused to give
specifics, but did say the corporate tax
rate would be cut from 48 percent to
42 percent for 1975 under the Ford
plan, thus reducing corporate taxes by
$6 billion.
They said Ford also will ask that
individuals who pay no income taxes
because of low earnings be granted
cash payments of about $BO per
person, and that the current $l3OO
low incopie allowance for couples be
increased to $2600. Families earning
less than this amount would not be
required to file annual returns.
"WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford proposed a $l6-billion
anti-recession tax cut last night, asking
Congress to vote cash rebates of up to
$lOOO for individual taxpayers.
Ford outlined a $46-billion
economic and energy package in a
nationally broadcast address, calling
for higher taxes on oil and natural gas
that experts said could increase retail
gasoline prices by about a nickle a
gallon.
As Ford was telling Americans "we
are in trouble" with a deepening
recession, White House officials were
spelling out details of proposals he will
present to Congress in his State of the
Union message tomorrow.
That address to Congress, the
officials said, will call for permanent
reductions in the tax rates for
individuals, a cut from 48 percent to
42 percent in the corporate tax rate, a
doubling of the low-income tax
allowance and a $l5O tax credit for
homeowners who insulate their houses
or take other energy-saving steps.
'We Have No Choice'
In his 20-minute television and
radio address, Ford declared "we have
no choice" but to put "our domestic
house in order." The program he
outlined to the public included these
major points:
—The immediate tax cut
implemented by giving 12 percent cash
rebates, up to a maximum of $lOOO
per tax return, to individuals based on
their 1974 tax payments.
—Higher taxes on foreign and
domestic oil, natural gas and windfall
profits of oil producers, to bring in
$3O billion, which would be returned
to the economy under procedures.
Tax Credit
Ford did not describe in detail in
his speech:
—A one-year increase in the
investment tax credit to 12 percent,
this giving industry a $4-billion tax

break to spur plant expansion and
create more jobs.
—A one-year moratorium on new
federal spending programs to hold
down the budget deficit, and a 5
percent limit on increases in federal
salaries and pension benefits paid frpm
the U.S. Treasury.
—An oil allocation program to
insure such areas as New England of
adequate fuel, a five-year delay on
stiffer auto pollution standards and
stepped-up energy conservation efforts
to cut foreign oil imports by one
million barrels a day this year.
'May Get Rougher'
Speaking from the White House
library, Ford declared that "right now
the going is rough and it may get
rougher." But he said that "if we do
what must be done" to lift the nation
out of a deepening recession "we will
be on our way to better days."
Ford was not specific in his speech
on how the $3O billion in "energy tax
revenues" would be raised and how it
then would be returned to the
economy.
But White House officials gave
newsmen an outline of the detailed
program the President will present to
Congress tomorrow. They said the
steps he would propose included:
Crude Oil Tariff
—An immediate tariff on foreign
crude oil, starting at $1 and going to
$3 a barrel in three months. This
would be done by executive order,
without congressional action.
—A recommendation that Congress
place a $2-per-barrel excise tax on
domestic oil and an equivalent tax on
natural gas amounting to 37 cents per
1000 cubic feet. When these taxes go
into effect, the tariff on foreign oil
would then be reduced to $2 a barrel.
—A windfall profits tax on oil
producers which officials estimated

NEW GAME PLAN—President Ford announced last night his new plan to
combat what he called "a deepening recession." The package includes a $16
billion tax rebate on 1974 taxes and increased taxes on crude oil imports. Ford

would bring in more than $l2 billion.
Coupled with the $lB billion they said
would be raised by the levies on oil
and natural gas, this would give the
federal Treasury $3O billion which
then would be redistributed.
Under Ford's plan, officials said
there would be permanent downward
adjustments in the tax rates on
individuals. They refused to give
specifics, but did say the corporate tax
rate would be cut from 48 percent to
42 percent for 1975 under the Ford
plan, thus reducing corporate taxes by
$6 billion.
They said Ford also will ask that
individuals who pay no income taxes
because of low earnings be granted
cash payments of about $BO per
person, and that the current $l3OO
low incopie allowance for couples be
increased to $2600. Families earning
less than this amount would not be
required to file annual returns.
