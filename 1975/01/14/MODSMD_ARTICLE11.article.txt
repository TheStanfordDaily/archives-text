# Kissinger Inherits Violent Legacy
## 
### Stephen Carter 
When Richard Nixon's resignation as
President became imminent last August, at
least one major radio network quickly
reported with obvious approval that
Gerald Ford had already persuaded Henry
Kissinger to remain as secretary of state.
With the man usually described as
"skillful" and "dynamic" in his diplomacy,
Kissinger was the key to the Nixonian "peace
with honor." That policy, of course, simply
meant that instead of spending billions of
dollars to pay Americans to kill with
American weapons, we spend billions of
dollars to pay Vietnamese to kill with
American weapons.
And Kissinger seems still to feel that
maintaining that "peace" is necessary. So it
shouldn't have surprised anyone when the
New York Times reported this weekend that
Kissinger had informed the Pentagon of his
"regret" that a naval task force that left the
Philippines did not initially head toward
Vietnam.
This, he reportedly explained, would have
demonstrated to the North Vietnamese (and
the world) the United States' willingness to
intercede, if necessary, on South Vietnam's
behalf.
War Dragged Out
This was in keeping with the character of
a man who was willing to drag out the
longest war in American history into an
election year, and who urged the bombing of
North Vietnam in Christmas of 1972,
ostensibly in order to "force" the North
Vietnamese to sign a treaty, the terms of

which they had agreed to months before!
Ted Szulc, writing in Foreign Affairs,
suggested the real reason: that the South
Vietnamese had to be shown that America
would defend them. The only convincing
way to demonstrate this, apparently, was to
kill a few thousand more civilians. (A legacy,
one can suppose, handed down from the days
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.)
Attack Canada?
But Kissinger's moral insensitivity is really
above reproach. He has refused to rule out
the use of military force in the Middle East,
should the oil producing nations try to
"strangle" the West, which is all well and
good. But he neglected at the time to
mention that Canada has already decided to
phase out all oil exports to the U.S. As one
radio commentator pointed out, why not
declare war on Canada instead? It would
probably be cheaper.
This former Time Magazine "Man of the
Year" an honor, incidentally, which he
now shares with Saudi Arabia's King Faisal
has made a career out of refusing to retract
even the most outrageous statements.
Early in the revelations of the "White
House horrors" (a much better phrase than
the "Watergate affairs," and one for which
we are forever indebted to convicted felon
John Mitchell), there were reports that
members of the National Security Council
had had their phones illegally tapped.
Kissinger, true to form, denied any
knowledge of the matter.
Then came the allegations that he had

ordered taps, and that he had received
transcripts of conversations. One result of
this was a civil suit by a former aide, Morton
Halperin. Curiously, one result was not a
weakening of the Secretary's credibility.
Kissinger debunked all the rumors with
one swift, irrelevant gesture when, last year,
he threatened to resign if his good name was
not cleared. Unfortunately, perhaps, no one
took him up on his offer.
Still In Power
As a result, Kissinger has remained in
office, and has brought to the United States
its second Strategic Arms Limitation
agreement. This pact has been attacked from
both the left and the right.
One major fault is that it doesn't appear
to do much limiting. In fact, Secretary of
Defense Schlesinger explained, the U.S. must
build more submarines than it had originally
planned, in order to comply with the accord.
But then, nobody's perfect.
Anyway, Kissinger's apparent failings
the misstatements, the insensitivity aren't
really his fault. They are in the
well-established tradition of American
government and American foreign policy.
The tenets of the policy are simple:
America is always right (the usual misquote),
and, of course, killing in perpetuation of this
myth is justified as long as the dead are not
Americans.

he threatened to resign if his good name was
not cleared. Unfortunately, perhaps, no one
took him up on his offer.
Still In Power
As a result, Kissinger has remained in
office, and has brought to the United States
its second Strategic Arms Limitation
agreement. This pact has been attacked from
both the left and the right.
One major fault is that it doesn't appear
to do much limiting. In fact, Secretary of
Defense Schlesinger explained, the U.S. must
build more submarines than it had originally
planned, in order to comply with the accord.
But then, nobody's perfect.
Anyway, Kissinger's apparent failings
the misstatements, the insensitivity aren't
really his fault. They are in the
well-established tradition of American
government and American foreign policy.
The tenets of the policy are simple:
America is always right (the usual misquote),
and, of course, killing in perpetuation of this
myth is justified as long as the dead are not
Americans.

editorial board. His column appears every

When Richard Nixon's resignation as
President became imminent last August, at
least one major radio network quickly
reported with obvious approval that
Gerald Ford had already persuaded Henry
Kissinger to remain as secretary of state.
With the man usually described as
"skillful" and "dynamic" in his diplomacy,
Kissinger was the key to the Nixonian "peace
with honor." That policy, of course, simply
meant that instead of spending billions of
dollars to pay Americans to kill with
American weapons, we spend billions of
dollars to pay Vietnamese to kill with
American weapons.
And Kissinger seems still to feel that
maintaining that "peace" is necessary. So it
shouldn't have surprised anyone when the
New York Times reported this weekend that
Kissinger had informed the Pentagon of his
"regret" that a naval task force that left the
Philippines did not initially head toward
Vietnam.
This, he reportedly explained, would have
demonstrated to the North Vietnamese (and
the world) the United States' willingness to
intercede, if necessary, on South Vietnam's
behalf.
War Dragged Out
This was in keeping with the character of
a man who was willing to drag out the
longest war in American history into an
election year, and who urged the bombing of
North Vietnam in Christmas of 1972,
ostensibly in order to "force" the North
Vietnamese to sign a treaty, the terms of

which they had agreed to months before!
Ted Szulc, writing in Foreign Affairs,
suggested the real reason: that the South
Vietnamese had to be shown that America
would defend them. The only convincing
way to demonstrate this, apparently, was to
kill a few thousand more civilians. (A legacy,
one can suppose, handed down from the days
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.)
Attack Canada?
But Kissinger's moral insensitivity is really
above reproach. He has refused to rule out
the use of military force in the Middle East,
should the oil producing nations try to
"strangle" the West, which is all well and
good. But he neglected at the time to
mention that Canada has already decided to
phase out all oil exports to the U.S. As one
radio commentator pointed out, why not
declare war on Canada instead? It would
probably be cheaper.
This former Time Magazine "Man of the
Year" an honor, incidentally, which he
now shares with Saudi Arabia's King Faisal
has made a career out of refusing to retract
even the most outrageous statements.
Early in the revelations of the "White
House horrors" (a much better phrase than
the "Watergate affairs," and one for which
we are forever indebted to convicted felon
John Mitchell), there were reports that
members of the National Security Council
had had their phones illegally tapped.
Kissinger, true to form, denied any
knowledge of the matter.
Then came the allegations that he had

ordered taps, and that he had received
transcripts of conversations. One result of
this was a civil suit by a former aide, Morton
Halperin. Curiously, one result was not a
weakening of the Secretary's credibility.
Kissinger debunked all the rumors with
one swift, irrelevant gesture when, last year,
he threatened to resign if his good name was
not cleared. Unfortunately, perhaps, no one
took him up on his offer.
