# Portugal Fears Possible CIA Coup
## 
### Jonathan Marshall 
The efficient and brutal
CIA-backed coup in Chile stands
as a powerful object lesson to
foreign gpvernments which
threaten American interests.
Already, the Portuguese people,
with less than a year's experience
with liberal government, fear
another such CIA operation will
return them to totalitarian rule.
On April 25, 1974, the Armed
Forces Movement overthrew the
right-wing Caetano government
and installed the conservative but
popular General Antonio de
Spinola as President. Spinola
promised free elections and an
end to Portugal's bloody and
fruitless colonial wars. He brought
into the Cabinet one Communist,
and a Socialist as Foreign
Minister.
While the Cabinet, overall, was
conservative, the American
government registered its
disapproval with the liberalization
by denying aid to the regime.
Even worse, in Henry Kissinger's
eyes, Spinola was forced to resign
on Sept. 30 to make way for more
liberal and left-wing forces.
Why is Kissinger reported in
the press as viewing these
developments with such alarm?
First, he is impressed by the
organizing ability of the
Communists, who are now the
dominant minority party in
Portugal; he believes that in
upcoming elections they will win
if they are not suppressed now.
The example of a Communist
victory at the polls would
strengthen the already powerful
Communist parties of Italy and
France, and might "destabilize"
Spain, Greece and Turkey.
This fear of a southern
European "domino" effect was in
fact one reason behind the U.S.
destruction of the freely elected
Allende government in Chile.
Azores Base Needed
Secondly, the United States
wants continued access to its
military base on the Azores.
Without this base, the United
States could not have airlifted
arms to Israel during the Yom
Kippur war.
Finally, Kissinger worries that
Portugal may allow leftist
liberation movements in southern
Africa to take power. The United
States has a huge stake to protect
in investments and strategic raw
materials, Kissinger points out.
These considerations have not

escaped Portuguese officials, who
suspect the United States of
planning to "Chileanize" their
country. "It is impossible to
exaggerate the fear . .. Portuguese
liberals have of the CIA," writes
Jane Kramer in the New Yorker.
"The fear is pervasive, and it is
compounded by rage and a sense
of helplessness."
Portugal's chief of military
security, General Otelo Carvalho,
told an interviewer that after the
April coup in Lisbon, the CIA
"immediately focused [its]
attention on us." Significantly, he
pointed to the example of Chile as
a possible'scenario for Portugal.
Rightists Bolstered
Already, the United States is
moving to bolster anti-Communist
elements in Portugal in
preparation for upcoming
elections. Last December, the
United States suddenly came

through with an offer of
economic aid. The decision was
openly called an effort to
maintain in power moderates like
President Francisco de Costa
Gomes and the liberal,
anti-Communist Socialist Foreign
Minister, Mario Soares.
Meanwhile, the U.S. appears to
be heavily financing the
conservative Christian Democratic
Socialist Party backed by the right
wing in Portugal's military.
Kissinger reportedly predicts the 1
army will intervene to prevent a
Communist victory, if it has
enough support.
CIA Role
The CIA is also playing a major
role. Last August, CIA deputy
director and Portugal-expert
Vernon Walters secretly went to
Lisbon to appraise the situation
and contact influential
conservatives. Walters and CIA

head William Colby also visited
Spain for high-level talks, possibly
aimed at preparing for Spanish
intervention.
Finally, the new American
ambassador to Portugal is Frank
Carcucci, who served for several
years in the Congo when the CIA
mounted its massive anti-rebel
campaign there. Portuguese
officials claim that a total of 100
CIA agents are already at work in
their country.
Democracy may yet survive in
Portugal. Much will depend on
whether Congress takes decisive
action to curb the CIA, or
whether, it lamely accepts the
ClA's word that "it won't happen
again." Congress must legislate
out of existence the President's
ability to wage covert warfare
against foreign peoples.

wants continued access to its
military base on the Azores.
Without this base, the United
States could not have airlifted
arms to Israel during the Yom
Kippur war.
Finally, Kissinger worries that
Portugal may allow leftist
liberation movements in southern
Africa to take power. The United
States has a huge stake to protect
in investments and strategic raw
materials, Kissinger points out.
These considerations have not

escaped Portuguese officials, who
suspect the United States of
planning to "Chileanize" their
country. "It is impossible to
exaggerate the fear . .. Portuguese
liberals have of the CIA," writes
Jane Kramer in the New Yorker.
"The fear is pervasive, and it is
compounded by rage and a sense
of helplessness."
Portugal's chief of military
security, General Otelo Carvalho,
told an interviewer that after the
April coup in Lisbon, the CIA
"immediately focused [its]
attention on us." Significantly, he
pointed to the example of Chile as
a possible'scenario for Portugal.
Rightists Bolstered
Already, the United States is
moving to bolster anti-Communist
elements in Portugal in
preparation for upcoming
elections. Last December, the
United States suddenly came

through with an offer of
economic aid. The decision was
openly called an effort to
maintain in power moderates like
President Francisco de Costa
Gomes and the liberal,
anti-Communist Socialist Foreign
Minister, Mario Soares.
Meanwhile, the U.S. appears to
be heavily financing the
conservative Christian Democratic
Socialist Party backed by the right
wing in Portugal's military.
Kissinger reportedly predicts the 1
army will intervene to prevent a
Communist victory, if it has
enough support.
CIA Role
The CIA is also playing a major
role. Last August, CIA deputy
director and Portugal-expert
Vernon Walters secretly went to
Lisbon to appraise the situation
and contact influential
conservatives. Walters and CIA

head William Colby also visited
Spain for high-level talks, possibly
aimed at preparing for Spanish
intervention.
Finally, the new American
ambassador to Portugal is Frank
Carcucci, who served for several
years in the Congo when the CIA
mounted its massive anti-rebel
campaign there. Portuguese
officials claim that a total of 100
CIA agents are already at work in
their country.
Democracy may yet survive in
Portugal. Much will depend on
whether Congress takes decisive
action to curb the CIA, or
whether, it lamely accepts the
ClA's word that "it won't happen
again." Congress must legislate
out of existence the President's
ability to wage covert warfare
against foreign peoples.

The efficient and brutal
CIA-backed coup in Chile stands
as a powerful object lesson to
foreign gpvernments which
threaten American interests.
Already, the Portuguese people,
with less than a year's experience
with liberal government, fear
another such CIA operation will
return them to totalitarian rule.
On April 25, 1974, the Armed
Forces Movement overthrew the
right-wing Caetano government
and installed the conservative but
popular General Antonio de
Spinola as President. Spinola
promised free elections and an
end to Portugal's bloody and
fruitless colonial wars. He brought
into the Cabinet one Communist,
and a Socialist as Foreign
Minister.
While the Cabinet, overall, was
conservative, the American
government registered its
disapproval with the liberalization
by denying aid to the regime.
Even worse, in Henry Kissinger's
eyes, Spinola was forced to resign
on Sept. 30 to make way for more
liberal and left-wing forces.
Why is Kissinger reported in
the press as viewing these
developments with such alarm?
First, he is impressed by the
organizing ability of the
Communists, who are now the
dominant minority party in
Portugal; he believes that in
upcoming elections they will win
if they are not suppressed now.
The example of a Communist
victory at the polls would
strengthen the already powerful
Communist parties of Italy and
France, and might "destabilize"
Spain, Greece and Turkey.
This fear of a southern
European "domino" effect was in
fact one reason behind the U.S.
destruction of the freely elected
Allende government in Chile.

military base on the Azores.
