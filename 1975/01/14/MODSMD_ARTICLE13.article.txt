# Rhetorical Question Asked
## 
### Richard W. Lyman 
Thomas Eoyang, commenting in the Jan. 8 Daily
upon a newspaper report of a talk I gave last month
about the People's Republic of China, has
unintentionally given a magnificent instance of the
tendency to use China, or what one imagines to be
China, as a stick with which to beat those aspects
of the United States that one doesn't like. He takes
issue with me for having asked:
"How does one interpret the fact that one
cannot get from any [university] student [in
China] an answer to the question, 'What would you
like to do after you've finished the university?
What sort of work?' other than the statement,'l
want to do what-, er the party and the revolution
need of me?'"
He believes that my sole purpose in raising the
issue was "to hint that individuals in China are
either too afraid or too will-less to express personal
desire."
To this there are two things that must be said
and indeed were said in portions of my talk which
the Chronicle-Examiner on which Eoyang relies,
did not fully report.
First, one has to wear ideological blinders of a
singularly opaque kind not to see the element of
enforced conformity that runs throughout life in
the People's Republic. There is no point in ducking
this, and I did not resort to the advice of asking
rhetorical questions as a means of calling attention
to it; I discussed it directly.
On the other hand, it is equally unrealistic, and
only possible by the aid of another and opposite set
of ideological blinders, to see fear and social
coercion as the beginning and the end of wisdom
about contemporary China and its enormous and

continuing achievements.
Further and more specifically to Eoyang's point,
a visit to China does raise very sharply the kinds of
questions he would like to ask. It is too bad, in
fact, that Eoyang did not read the very next
sentence that followed the one to which he takes
such exception. It went as follows:
"Does one come away contrasting, unfavorably
to ourselves, the obvious social and political
solidarity and sense of purpose of these young
people with the high degree of self-interestedness,
not to say self-indulgence, and the lack of
overriding social consensus that appear to exist
among our own?"
Frankly, I had expected that it would be this
"rhetorical question" and not the one objected to
by Eoyang that would arouse criticism.
Where I think Eoyang and I part company is
that I'm trying to raise questions whereas he is only
interested in offering answers. Lack of evidence,
argument or fair quotation of his opponents seems
not to trouble him. Does he think that belief in
these, like belief "in individual liberty and equal
opportunity," is "bankrupt"?
