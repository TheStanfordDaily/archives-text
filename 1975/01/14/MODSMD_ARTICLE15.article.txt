The Marshalls
Editor:
In a time when it is so easy
journalistically to put people
down, your article on Hugh
Marshall comes as a pleasant
antidote. I don't know when I
have read a piece that seemed to
me more faithfully and
delightfully to capture the spirit
of a man I admire very much.
There have been a lot of rugged
moments at Stanford in the last
decade, and Hugh Marshall has
never backed away from them.
His remarkable independence has
frequently made him the target of
the right and of the left which
indicates he must be getting
through pretty directly.
I have only one fault to find
with your reporter's excellent
profile. One cannot really talk
about Hugh Marshall apart from
Rachelle, his wife. Both on the
campus and in Palo Alto, she has
probably been more consistently
"the conscience of the
community" than anyone I know.
Whether the issue is racism,
foreign policy, the CIA, amnesty,
military recruitment on campus,
Or whatever, Rachelle is in there
with her presence, her
persuasiveness and her pen. (The
Palo Alto Times now restricts her
to one letter a month.) She is my
perennial candidate for the Nobel
Peace Prize and someday she'll get
it.
Neither is really definable
without the other, and yet each is
totally an individual. It's nice to
see that now and then these days.

Cuba Is Oppressed
Editor:
In reference to Mark Patton's
column (Daily, Jan. 9), I fail to
recall the early 1960s as
particularly uphappy or
worrisome days. If "most
Americans spent their free time
digging bomb shelters" then I am
a left-handed cranberry.
About the worst things to
happen in this hemisphere were
the replacement of an
authoritarian regime by a
totalitarian one in Cuba and the
loss of a young president to
assassination by a Marxist.
What has happened in the
meanwhile to the soul of Cuba is
moot. The soul may be enobled in
deprivation of every basic human
right. What is known is that
political repression is more severe
in Cuba than in any other Latin
American country.
Outsiders will see no
demonstrations of anti-Castro
sentiment while local police
informers are likely to be present.
Those who would vote against
Castro have, to a large extent, left
Cuba (minus their possessions,
since a man's produce ceases to be
his if he wants to change
locations, right?).
It is through the thousands of
migrants from communist
countries each year that the fears
of communism have been
implanted into the American
mentality. Talk to a Cuban today.
Read Solzhenitsyn's Gulag
Archipelago.
Then ask what civil liberties we
might force Castro to grant to the
Cuban people in exchange for
diplomatic recognition and an end
to the blockade.

Vulgarity Denied
Editor:
In response to a letter written
by two members of the Stanford
Fire Department about my
coverage of the Marinaro-
Whittemore wedding, I have this
to say:
The story was obviously
written in a light vein. I can't
believe anyone would take too
seriously a story beginning with,
"the only, blazes in the church
were the ones in the hearts of
Nick Marinaro and his bride
Debbie Whittemore."
So what's "cheap" about
saying "the gown clung softly to
her hips"? after all it did cling
to her hips. I was covering a
wedding, where it is traditional to
describe the bride's outfit.
And the allegation that I
misquoted the groom as saying,
"It feels good to be married to
anyone," is simply false.
Finally, I didn't infer that
Whittemore always wears "guns
around her waist," I said she
usually does.

My congratulations on your
feature series on Stanford
professors.
Please continue the profiles, as jft
