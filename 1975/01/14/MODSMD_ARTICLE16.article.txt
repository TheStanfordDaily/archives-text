## Native American Storyteller And Poet: English Professor Shares His Heritage 
### MELISSA BAUMANN 
Last week Scott Momaday
stalked Billy the Kid through
White Plaza.
Or so he said.
Scott Momaday, above all, is a
storyteller. Professor of English
and Comparative Literature at
Stanford since 1972, Momaday
has been passing on the oral
tradition of his American Indian
heritage to his fascinated students.
> Billy the Kid is part of that
heritage. "The Kid captured my
imagination," Momaday
reminisced in a soothing voice
that has lulled children to sleep.
He required little encouragement
to narrate the episodes of his
Kiowa childhood.
Momaday is the size of a bear
and as wise as an eagle, and only
his voice hints that he was once a
child. "I grew up on the back of a
horse," he began, smiling at his
memories. Born in Oklahoma in
1934, he spent his youth
exploring the deserts and canyons
on the Navajo Reservation in New
Mexico.
Momaday spoke simply,
choosing his words thoughtfully
and shaping them with the
strength of his hands. "Although I
wasn't conscious of it at the time,
it was a very good thing that I
could ride," he reflected. "It
taught me a sense of landscape,
and allowed my imagination to
run free."
Imagination
Imagination was young
Momaday's only reliable
companion. Being the only child
of an artist and a writer cultured
Momaday's temperament, in his
words, "one that demands to be
left alone."
Momaday's grandmother,
however, is one person whose
presence was cherished and
indispensable. He spent his
childhood summers with her,
returning to his native Oklahoma
and the traditions of Kiowa

culture.
"There was great feasting, and
people would always come around
to talk, to gossip, to laugh,"
Momaday recalled, dark eyes
seizing the memory. "It was then
I learned it is a privilege to be an
Indian."
Momaday digressed and spoke
with pride of "the vision that
informs the Indian world." The
Indian's experience "is closer to
nature; he sees farther into the
real world than the ordinary
person. He knows and he knows
he knows he is at peace."
Broader Views
Although the past is as potent
as the present for Momaday and
the tribal voice is his own, he
relinquishes his ethnicity for a
broader, artistic identity. "I am
not at Stanford to represent the
Indian point of view," he said.
"Writing is my first interest,
though I do write out of my racial
experience."
Humility and reserve disguise
Momaday's literary achievements:
in 1969 he won the Pulitzer Prize
for his first and only novel, House
Made of Dawn, a book concerning
an Indian's "traumatic dislocation
of the self" in contemporary
American society.
He was honored again in the
same year, receiving the
"Outstanding Indian of the Year
Award" from the Kiowa and
Comanche tribes.
Momaday, who considers
himself "primarily a poet," writes
as smoothly and lyrically as he
speaks. The author says his book,
The Way to Rainy Mountain, a
collection of folktales depicting a
Kiowa migration, is the best
showcase for his talent.
Evoking A Spirit
"That book is closest to what I
want to do," he said, "that is, to
evoke a landscape, to evoke the
spirit of a people as it developed

in the course of the migration and
place myself in that journey."
Momaday abandoned the
subject of his own writing to
reveal his "idiosyncratic" literary
tastes. "I like literature that
disturbs me," he said, and listed
Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens
and Isak Dinesen as three of his
favorite writers, though he doubts
his work shows their influence.
Faith in "the power of
language" is not confined to
Momaday's written work.
Students in his American poetry
class and his course on American
Indian mythology, legend and lore
see Momaday as a benevolent
shaman who, in one student's
words, "leads the class into a
hypnotic trance."
"I find the classroom a highly
charged and stimulating place.
Teaching forces me to think
clearly," Momaday said. Since
receiving his Ph.D. from Stanford
in 1963, Momaday has thought
clearly in the classrooms of UC
Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley and
New Mexico State University.
Gentle Prodding
Momaday's poetry writing class
at Stanford is an "intimate
experience," according to one
class member. With the patience
of a good parent, Momaday gently
prods his academic children into
criticism of each others' work.
Looking like a businessman in
a navy suit with a leather briefcase
at his feet, Momadaysits at the
side of the table with his students.
They hold communion with a
feast of dried fruits and nuts and
apple juice.
A student reads her poem and
Momaday eases the ensuing
silence with his melodic voice.
The poem is exhaustive, and
Momaday tells her, softening his
criticism with the upturned
corners of his dimpled mouth and
jesting: "Maybe someday I'll type
out the whole thing."

One student voiced the class's
reverence for Momaday: "He has
the wonderful, rare talent of
criticizing your poetry without
making you feel like a fool," she
said. "He's everyone's hero."
Many of Momaday's colleagues
reiterate that sentiment. Creative
Writing Prof, poet Ken Fields, one
of Momaday's closest friends and
a former classmate, admires his
"eyes and ears," his talent "for
description and storytelling."
Fields related an anecdote
concerning the late Yvor Winters,
Stanford poet and Momaday's
teacher in the early '6os, who

priased Momaday as a "great
poet" in their poetry class one
day when he was absent. Most
students acknowledged their
classmate's ability, but a thin,
nervous young man twitched in
competitive discomfort.
"Scott is so strong he could lift
this table," Winters said, tapping
the table around which they were
gathered. The thin man, Fields
noted, had surreptitiously slipped
his hands underneath the table
and was trying to raise it.
Fields' conclusion: "If you
compete with Scott, you're
competing on a number of levels."

Fields related an anecdote
concerning the late Yvor Winters,
Stanford poet and Momaday's
teacher in the early '6os, who

priased Momaday as a "great
poet" in their poetry class one
day when he was absent. Most
students acknowledged their

nervous young man twitched in
competitive discomfort.

his hands underneath the table

compete with Scott, you're
competing on a number of levels."

THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST —Some Stanford grads smile a little
brighter during commencement—perhaps because they are among the
lucky group honored each year with Phi Beta Kappa membership. Will
you be one of them? The Daily's "Bug" tells how you can qualify.
Last week Scott Momaday
stalked Billy the Kid through
White Plaza.
Or so he said.
Scott Momaday, above all, is a
storyteller. Professor of English
and Comparative Literature at
Stanford since 1972, Momaday
has been passing on the oral
tradition of his American Indian
heritage to his fascinated students.
> Billy the Kid is part of that
heritage. "The Kid captured my
imagination," Momaday
reminisced in a soothing voice
that has lulled children to sleep.
He required little encouragement
to narrate the episodes of his
Kiowa childhood.
Momaday is the size of a bear
and as wise as an eagle, and only
his voice hints that he was once a
child. "I grew up on the back of a
horse," he began, smiling at his
memories. Born in Oklahoma in
1934, he spent his youth
exploring the deserts and canyons
on the Navajo Reservation in New
Mexico.
Momaday spoke simply,
choosing his words thoughtfully
and shaping them with the
strength of his hands. "Although I
wasn't conscious of it at the time,
it was a very good thing that I
could ride," he reflected. "It
taught me a sense of landscape,
and allowed my imagination to
run free."
Imagination
Imagination was young
Momaday's only reliable
companion. Being the only child
of an artist and a writer cultured
Momaday's temperament, in his
words, "one that demands to be
left alone."
Momaday's grandmother,
however, is one person whose
presence was cherished and
indispensable. He spent his
childhood summers with her,
returning to his native Oklahoma
and the traditions of Kiowa

culture.
"There was great feasting, and
people would always come around
to talk, to gossip, to laugh,"
Momaday recalled, dark eyes
seizing the memory. "It was then
I learned it is a privilege to be an
Indian."
Momaday digressed and spoke
with pride of "the vision that
informs the Indian world." The
Indian's experience "is closer to
nature; he sees farther into the
real world than the ordinary
person. He knows and he knows
he knows he is at peace."
Broader Views
Although the past is as potent
as the present for Momaday and
the tribal voice is his own, he
relinquishes his ethnicity for a
broader, artistic identity. "I am
not at Stanford to represent the
Indian point of view," he said.
"Writing is my first interest,
though I do write out of my racial
experience."
Humility and reserve disguise
Momaday's literary achievements:
in 1969 he won the Pulitzer Prize
for his first and only novel, House
Made of Dawn, a book concerning
an Indian's "traumatic dislocation
of the self" in contemporary
American society.
He was honored again in the
same year, receiving the
"Outstanding Indian of the Year
Award" from the Kiowa and
Comanche tribes.
Momaday, who considers
himself "primarily a poet," writes
as smoothly and lyrically as he
speaks. The author says his book,
The Way to Rainy Mountain, a
collection of folktales depicting a
Kiowa migration, is the best
showcase for his talent.
Evoking A Spirit
"That book is closest to what I
want to do," he said, "that is, to
evoke a landscape, to evoke the
spirit of a people as it developed

in the course of the migration and
place myself in that journey."
Momaday abandoned the
subject of his own writing to
reveal his "idiosyncratic" literary
tastes. "I like literature that
disturbs me," he said, and listed
Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens
and Isak Dinesen as three of his
favorite writers, though he doubts
his work shows their influence.
Faith in "the power of
language" is not confined to
Momaday's written work.
Students in his American poetry
class and his course on American
Indian mythology, legend and lore
see Momaday as a benevolent
shaman who, in one student's
words, "leads the class into a
hypnotic trance."
"I find the classroom a highly
charged and stimulating place.
Teaching forces me to think
clearly," Momaday said. Since
receiving his Ph.D. from Stanford
in 1963, Momaday has thought
clearly in the classrooms of UC
Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley and
New Mexico State University.
Gentle Prodding
Momaday's poetry writing class
at Stanford is an "intimate
experience," according to one
class member. With the patience
of a good parent, Momaday gently
prods his academic children into
criticism of each others' work.

He was honored again in the
same year, receiving the
"Outstanding Indian of the Year
Award" from the Kiowa and
Comanche tribes.
Momaday, who considers
himself "primarily a poet," writes
as smoothly and lyrically as he
speaks. The author says his book,
The Way to Rainy Mountain, a
collection of folktales depicting a
Kiowa migration, is the best
showcase for his talent.
Evoking A Spirit
"That book is closest to what I
want to do," he said, "that is, to
evoke a landscape, to evoke the
spirit of a people as it developed

in the course of the migration and
place myself in that journey."
Momaday abandoned the
subject of his own writing to
reveal his "idiosyncratic" literary
tastes. "I like literature that
disturbs me," he said, and listed
Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens
and Isak Dinesen as three of his
favorite writers, though he doubts
his work shows their influence.
Faith in "the power of
language" is not confined to
Momaday's written work.
Students in his American poetry
class and his course on American
Indian mythology, legend and lore
see Momaday as a benevolent
shaman who, in one student's
words, "leads the class into a
hypnotic trance."
"I find the classroom a highly
charged and stimulating place.
Teaching forces me to think
clearly," Momaday said. Since
receiving his Ph.D. from Stanford
in 1963, Momaday has thought
clearly in the classrooms of UC
Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley and
New Mexico State University.
Gentle Prodding
Momaday's poetry writing class
at Stanford is an "intimate
experience," according to one
class member. With the patience
of a good parent, Momaday gently
prods his academic children into
criticism of each others' work.
Looking like a businessman in
a navy suit with a leather briefcase
at his feet, Momadaysits at the
side of the table with his students.
They hold communion with a
feast of dried fruits and nuts and
apple juice.
A student reads her poem and
Momaday eases the ensuing
silence with his melodic voice.
The poem is exhaustive, and
Momaday tells her, softening his
criticism with the upturned
corners of his dimpled mouth and
jesting: "Maybe someday I'll type
out the whole thing."

One student voiced the class's
reverence for Momaday: "He has
the wonderful, rare talent of
criticizing your poetry without
making you feel like a fool," she
said. "He's everyone's hero."
Many of Momaday's colleagues
reiterate that sentiment. Creative
Writing Prof, poet Ken Fields, one
of Momaday's closest friends and
a former classmate, admires his
"eyes and ears," his talent "for
description and storytelling."
Fields related an anecdote
concerning the late Yvor Winters,
Stanford poet and Momaday's
teacher in the early '6os, who

priased Momaday as a "great
poet" in their poetry class one
day when he was absent. Most
students acknowledged their
classmate's ability, but a thin,
nervous young man twitched in
competitive discomfort.
"Scott is so strong he could lift
this table," Winters said, tapping
the table around which they were
gathered. The thin man, Fields
noted, had surreptitiously slipped
his hands underneath the table
and was trying to raise it.
Fields' conclusion: "If you
compete with Scott, you're
competing on a number of levels."

THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST —Some Stanford grads smile a little
brighter during commencement—perhaps because they are among the
lucky group honored each year with Phi Beta Kappa membership. Will
you be one of them? The Daily's "Bug" tells how you can qualify.
Last week Scott Momaday
stalked Billy the Kid through
White Plaza.
Or so he said.
Scott Momaday, above all, is a
storyteller. Professor of English
and Comparative Literature at
Stanford since 1972, Momaday
has been passing on the oral
tradition of his American Indian
heritage to his fascinated students.
> Billy the Kid is part of that
heritage. "The Kid captured my
imagination," Momaday
reminisced in a soothing voice
that has lulled children to sleep.
He required little encouragement
to narrate the episodes of his
Kiowa childhood.
Momaday is the size of a bear
and as wise as an eagle, and only
his voice hints that he was once a
child. "I grew up on the back of a
horse," he began, smiling at his
memories. Born in Oklahoma in
1934, he spent his youth
exploring the deserts and canyons
on the Navajo Reservation in New
Mexico.
Momaday spoke simply,
choosing his words thoughtfully
and shaping them with the
strength of his hands. "Although I
wasn't conscious of it at the time,
it was a very good thing that I
could ride," he reflected. "It
taught me a sense of landscape,
and allowed my imagination to
run free."
Imagination
Imagination was young
Momaday's only reliable
companion. Being the only child
of an artist and a writer cultured
Momaday's temperament, in his
words, "one that demands to be
left alone."
Momaday's grandmother,
however, is one person whose
presence was cherished and
indispensable. He spent his
childhood summers with her,
returning to his native Oklahoma
and the traditions of Kiowa

culture.
"There was great feasting, and
people would always come around
to talk, to gossip, to laugh,"
Momaday recalled, dark eyes
seizing the memory. "It was then
I learned it is a privilege to be an
Indian."
Momaday digressed and spoke
with pride of "the vision that
informs the Indian world." The
Indian's experience "is closer to
nature; he sees farther into the
real world than the ordinary
person. He knows and he knows
he knows he is at peace."
Broader Views
Although the past is as potent
as the present for Momaday and
the tribal voice is his own, he
relinquishes his ethnicity for a
broader, artistic identity. "I am
not at Stanford to represent the
Indian point of view," he said.
"Writing is my first interest,
though I do write out of my racial
experience."
Humility and reserve disguise
Momaday's literary achievements:
in 1969 he won the Pulitzer Prize
for his first and only novel, House
Made of Dawn, a book concerning
an Indian's "traumatic dislocation
of the self" in contemporary
American society.
He was honored again in the
