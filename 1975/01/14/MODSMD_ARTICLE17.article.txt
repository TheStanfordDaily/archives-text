What are the criteria for membership in
Phi Beta Kappa? In particular, I would like to
know whether transfer students are
disfavored in the process? S.J.
Brilliant students who've taken "Sleep and
Dreams" and "Human Sexuality" to fulfill
their distribution requirement should forget
about Phi Beta Kappa, according to Don
Price, the organization's secretary.
Students must have "substantive courses"
in the humanities, the social sciences and the
natural sciences. And to make sure that no
prospective Phi Beta Kappan is sneaking
through the University taking the standard
micks, a committee of students in the
organization painstakingly scrutinizes each
transcript.
But this is only part of a long and
laborious process to ferret out the so-called
"cream of the crop" of each Stanford class.
The search begins after winter quarter when a
computer list identifies those students in
each department with a grade average of 3.40
or higher, and the number of expected
degrees in each department.
Only 12 percent of any class can be in Phi
Beta Kappa. A few are elected as juniors
(those "obviously superior") and the rest as

seniors. Therefore, a committee reviews the
list and knocks off those elected as juniors.
After that the top 12 percent of, each
department (by grade average) is determined.
Occasionally, one department has slightly
more or less than 12 percent.
From here, the 3.40 list goes to a
department representative, chosen by his
department, who identifies those students
considered most outstanding (up to 12
percent of the department). The
representative may solicit letters from faculty
if he feels that he cannot evaluate certain
students.
But this isn't the end. Within each
department the top transcripts of 20 percent
of its students are pulled. Here's where the
mick-checking comes in. The student
committee reviews the anonymous
transcripts and submits its recommendations
for the top 12 percent.
The various recommendations 'finally
arrive at their hallowed destination the
officers of Phi Beta Kappa, a committee of
nine including three faculty members. They
review everything, and make their choices.
Price admits that the whole process is
extremely subjective. Courses like sculpture,

painting or music are eliminated because
they are "talent courses." And there
apparently isn't a consensus on what a
"talent course" is. Price said that he might
classify a creative writing course this way,
although others on the committees might
not. "We're getting into very thin ice here,"
he admitted.
The committees also "get into great
trouble with special seminars, SCIRE courses
and even honors essays. And transfer
students may well be out of luck.
"If they're transferring from Harvard, we
can say 'Well, that's kind of good.' But if
they transfer from Oklahoma State, we don't
know," said Price.
Activities play no part in selection of Phi
Beta Kappa members. And, interestingly
enough, neither does a 4.0 grade average
unless the course selection is well-rounded.
"Let's face it. It's pretty easy to get straight
A's at Stanford now," Price said.
If you were somehow overlooked by this
magjcal, mystical process, what can you do?
If you're a junior, you can spend your next
two quarters frantically taking "substantive
courses" outside your department. If you're
a senior, you can petition for reconsideration
as 17 unfortunates did last year.

list and knocks off those elected as juniors.
After that the top 12 percent of, each
department (by grade average) is determined.
Occasionally, one department has slightly
more or less than 12 percent.
From here, the 3.40 list goes to a
department representative, chosen by his
department, who identifies those students
considered most outstanding (up to 12
percent of the department). The
representative may solicit letters from faculty
if he feels that he cannot evaluate certain
students.
But this isn't the end. Within each
department the top transcripts of 20 percent
of its students are pulled. Here's where the
mick-checking comes in. The student
committee reviews the anonymous
transcripts and submits its recommendations
for the top 12 percent.
The various recommendations 'finally
arrive at their hallowed destination the
officers of Phi Beta Kappa, a committee of
nine including three faculty members. They
review everything, and make their choices.
Price admits that the whole process is
extremely subjective. Courses like sculpture,

painting or music are eliminated because
they are "talent courses." And there
apparently isn't a consensus on what a
"talent course" is. Price said that he might
classify a creative writing course this way,
although others on the committees might
not. "We're getting into very thin ice here,"
he admitted.
The committees also "get into great
trouble with special seminars, SCIRE courses
and even honors essays. And transfer
students may well be out of luck.
"If they're transferring from Harvard, we
can say 'Well, that's kind of good.' But if
they transfer from Oklahoma State, we don't
know," said Price.
Activities play no part in selection of Phi
Beta Kappa members. And, interestingly
enough, neither does a 4.0 grade average
unless the course selection is well-rounded.
"Let's face it. It's pretty easy to get straight
A's at Stanford now," Price said.
If you were somehow overlooked by this
magjcal, mystical process, what can you do?
If you're a junior, you can spend your next
two quarters frantically taking "substantive
courses" outside your department. If you're
a senior, you can petition for reconsideration
as 17 unfortunates did last year.

What are the criteria for membership in
Phi Beta Kappa? In particular, I would like to
know whether transfer students are
disfavored in the process? S.J.
Brilliant students who've taken "Sleep and
Dreams" and "Human Sexuality" to fulfill
their distribution requirement should forget
about Phi Beta Kappa, according to Don
Price, the organization's secretary.
Students must have "substantive courses"
in the humanities, the social sciences and the
natural sciences. And to make sure that no
prospective Phi Beta Kappan is sneaking
through the University taking the standard
micks, a committee of students in the
organization painstakingly scrutinizes each
transcript.
But this is only part of a long and
laborious process to ferret out the so-called
"cream of the crop" of each Stanford class.
The search begins after winter quarter when a
computer list identifies those students in
each department with a grade average of 3.40
or higher, and the number of expected
degrees in each department.
Only 12 percent of any class can be in Phi
Beta Kappa. A few are elected as juniors
(those "obviously superior") and the rest as

seniors. Therefore, a committee reviews the
