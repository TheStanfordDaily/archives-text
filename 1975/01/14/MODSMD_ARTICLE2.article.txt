# Budget Requires Outside Funding
## University Courts Oilmen's Gifts 
### TERRY ANZUR Second of two parts 
Corporate gifts to Stanford, increasingly important
during a time of rising University budget deficits,
totalled a record $5 million last year. Whether the total
continues to rise depends on how deeply the current
recession cuts corporate profits and how effective
Stanford is in soliciting contributions.
Fundraisers have observed a high correlation between
a corporation's pre-tax profit levels and its willingness to
support higher education and research. And, using this
criterion, oil companies have recently become a more
obvious target.
"We're tough competitors," says Dwain Fullerton,
associate general secretary and director of corporate
relations.
Fullerton cites the examples of Harvard and MIT,
where corporations have established a tradition of
support. Although Stanford collected a record amount
of corporate funds last year, massive efforts are needed
to bring corporate giving here to the same level Eastern
universities enjoy. "We've got to be greedy, get more
than our share," Fullerton says.
"In the past we approached companies with a history
of giving to Stanford," Fullerton explains. "There was
no predominant industry sector in the past. Economic
realities may dictate that we direct our efforts toward
different industry sectors."
I "The key lies in the cooperation of people like

[Mechanical Engineering Dept. Chairman] Bill Reynolds
and [Graduate School of Business Dean] Arjay Miller,"
Fullerton says.
According to Robert W. Simon, corporate relations
director for the GSB, the Business School is "currently
working on a very large proposal with the largest oil
company in the nation."
The GSB is proposing that Exxon back its public
management program, - says William F. Massy, vice
provost for research. "But there is a business school
policy against developing programs for specific
companies. We don't feed anybody's research results on
the sly."
"We're preying on the idea that corporations have to
support higher education," says William M. Kays, dean
of the Engineering School. "But they want more than
that."
But if corporate stockholders make increased
demands for bigger dividends and less philanthropy,
corporations may be least able to supply what the
University needs most unrestricted money.
"The big effort across the board is to bring in money
for the general operating budget," Kays observes. "The
Institute does it by picking up general department
costs."
The side effects of corporate oil support for the
Institute will allow the Engineering Department to trim
$4O-50,000 from its operating budget, estimates Kays.
"Of course, we don't tell the oil companies that."
Standard Oil consultant Robert J. Randolph, counsel
for public relation in education, maintains that
Standard's $1 million, five-year pledge to Stanford
involves both restricted and unrestricted funds. Part
provides scholarships restricted to department areas, part
funds a visiting professorship and part supports general
studies at the Hoover Institute on War, Revolution and
Peace, he says.
"Certainly our interest in the Middle East situation is
part of it," Randolph comments. "But we have a
tradition of supporting Hoover and didn't specify
support for any one program."
Standard Oil of California gives $2 rpillion to higher
education annually, says Randolph.
"We've had some moves by our stockholders to stop
us from doing this sort of thing at all," he continues.
Engineering Department Chairman Reynolds notes
that oil companies like to support research that is "far
out. Gulf Oil, for example, is supporting our research in
solar energy, but they're not in the field themselves."
He also notes that "big money comes from
corporation presidents." Smaller subscriptions to the
energy affiliates program involve "a commitment of
about $5OOO from lower officials in the operating
divisions who decide to establish a close working
relationship with University researchers."
The affiliate program rewards corporations who give

unrestricted money by inviting their representatives to
participate in research seminars. "They also get an edge
in recruiting our graduates by establishing a close
working relationship with talented students before they
graduate," Reynolds explains.
"Most corporations are enlightened about giving
money sufficiently unrestricted so it is of use to the
departments," Fullerton says. "In the few cases where
the gift is overly restricted it's our fault for not getting
the message across."
He cites Exxon's donation decisions as an example of
"enlightened self-interest." Exxon was willing to set up
energy centers across the nation for the study of energy
alternatives useful in national policy-making, says
Fullerton. "They wanted to support them but not
appear to control them. They wanted to preserve
objectivity."
"But the Energy Institute is the plum, the big apple,"
Fullerton emphasizes. Says Kays, "It's something that
catches an oil company's eye."
Adds Reynolds, "We've deliberately sought a broad
base of support. We have never approached any
company with a request to fund the whole thing. We
need more money than any one company could give us."
At the same time, "there has been no support from
non-energy companies, nor have we sought any,"
Reynolds says. "There are other places in the University
that need support. If the company isn't interested
specifically in energy, they're approached with a
different angle."
