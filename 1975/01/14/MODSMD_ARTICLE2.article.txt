# Budget Requires Outside Funding
## University Courts Oilmen's Gifts 
### TERRY ANZUR Second of two parts 
Corporate gifts to Stanford, increasingly important
during a time of rising University budget deficits,
totalled a record $5 million last year. Whether the total
continues to rise depends on how deeply the current
recession cuts corporate profits and how effective
Stanford is in soliciting contributions.
Fundraisers have observed a high correlation between
a corporation's pre-tax profit levels and its willingness to
support higher education and research. And, using this
criterion, oil companies have recently become a more
obvious target.
"We're tough competitors," says Dwain Fullerton,
associate general secretary and director of corporate
relations.
Fullerton cites the examples of Harvard and MIT,
where corporations have established a tradition of
support. Although Stanford collected a record amount
of corporate funds last year, massive efforts are needed
to bring corporate giving here to the same level Eastern
universities enjoy. "We've got to be greedy, get more
than our share," Fullerton says.
"In the past we approached companies with a history
of giving to Stanford," Fullerton explains. "There was
no predominant industry sector in the past. Economic
realities may dictate that we direct our efforts toward
different industry sectors."
I "The key lies in the cooperation of people like

[Mechanical Engineering Dept. Chairman] Bill Reynolds
and [Graduate School of Business Dean] Arjay Miller,"
Fullerton says.
According to Robert W. Simon, corporate relations
director for the GSB, the Business School is "currently
working on a very large proposal with the largest oil
company in the nation."
The GSB is proposing that Exxon back its public
management program, - says William F. Massy, vice
provost for research. "But there is a business school
policy against developing programs for specific
companies. We don't feed anybody's research results on
the sly."
"We're preying on the idea that corporations have to
support higher education," says William M. Kays, dean
of the Engineering School. "But they want more than
that."
But if corporate stockholders make increased
demands for bigger dividends and less philanthropy,
corporations may be least able to supply what the
University needs most unrestricted money.
"The big effort across the board is to bring in money
for the general operating budget," Kays observes. "The
Institute does it by picking up general department
costs."
The side effects of corporate oil support for the
Institute will allow the Engineering Department to trim
