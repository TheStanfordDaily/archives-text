## The 						TV People America's Morning Needs Improvement 
### George Dobbins 
Getting up at 7 a.m. is indeed
an ungodly act. It is even more
ungodly when done solely to
watch television. Yet, ABC
executives are putting millions of
dollars into a new show called AM
America (which premiered last
week), with the belief that people
will do just that.
ABC's determination is
commendable, but we wish the
commercials for this program
would stop asking "How do you
wake up America?" until someone
comes up with a better answer.
Not that this show is terrible
but we already have a Today
program. Like that show, this one
attempts to keep America
informed. It even runs two hours
and has the familiar clock without
an hour hand. As opposed to
Today, it features fabulous
photographs and superb musical
interludes. But when these
become the focal point of the
show, you know something's
wrong.
What's wrong in this program is
that it falls flat when it attempts
to differentiate itself from Today.
It falls flat by becoming soporific
instead of energetic. The reasons
are twofold: dull personalities and
superficial stories. Only if it
corrects these flaws will this show
stand a chance.
Dull Hosts
Its dullness comes mainly in
the form of the hosts Stephanie
Edwards, Bill Beutel' and Peter
Jennings. We believe they can be
warm, interesting people. But,
currently, they seem as human as
Barbie, Ken and Brad dolls.
Edwards, a former actress who
worked in Los Angeles on Ralph
Story's AM, spends most of her

time giggling in a silly manner,
talking about trivia and reporting
the weather. She even has
problems doing that. Last
Monday, she commented, "The
only bright spot [in the nation] is
in central California" and then
went on to say that it would be
"clear throughout the
Southwest." Did our ears deceive
us? She even commented that
New York is "insulated from
rain." Wouldn't any good English
TA mark that as awkward usage?
It didn't deter Edwards.
Bad Interview
Not even her non-ability to
conduct an interview slowed her
down. She actually told Dustin
Hoffman, "It's a pleasure to see
you and hear you and smell you
and hopefully touch you." He
looked at her as strangely as we
did.
Beutel is not as silly as
Edwards but his personality seems
restricted to one word: nice.
Formerly an ABC weekend
newscaster, he is now the
personification of "nice." To
paraphrase a comment made by
Cleveland Amory, a fellow critic,
ABC seems to be allowing Beutel
two expressions: one is a smile
and one isn't.
His predicament is not all his
fault. Much of his less than human
image stems from the inane
activities he must perform. Last
Monday, he saluted "national pun
week" with such gems as:
"summer scholarships summer
paid for, summer not" and "I fed
my cat a lemon and now I've got a
sour puss." This made us want to
ask how many ABC newsmen it
takes to screw in a lightbulb.
The only person on this show

who comes off less than screwy is
Jennings. He is a competent,
dedicated newsman as evidenced
by his superb coverage of the
Arab terrorism during the '72
Olympics. He also delivers news
well on this show, but he should
participate in more serious and
in-depth interviews.
This show must change its
superficial, speedy pace and
convert to more thoughtful
features. Right now, AM America
reminds us of AM radio, not
because it features an endless
supply of cameoregulars
(including John Lindsay and
Ralph Story) but because it
provides us with a literal air raid, a
bombardment of segment after
segment, most of which are
shoddy.
Some ideas have been good.
The interviews with Sam Ervin
and Elliot Richardson concerning
CIA domestic spying, the
Meninger Brothers about the
fiftieth anniversary of their clinic
and Tom Corcoran, FDR's New
Deal economic advisor, had
potential.
But as soon as they approached
depth, either Edwards or Beutel
would say, "Well, that's all the
time we have" and then cut to a
commercial.
Improved Depth
Last Friday, we saw an
improvement in this trend.
Interviews with Ronald Reagan
and even Roy Rodgers actually
contained some depth. And that is
exactly what AM America needs.
At this moment, Today has
nothing to fear. It has mastered
the secret of how to present
interviews and information in an
interesting manner. But this does
not mean that we discourage AM
America from trying.
On the contrary, we encourage
it to be different, to experiment,
to be creative. If it makes the
attempt to distinguish itself from
Today and allows its hbsts to
show their personalities while
conducting worthwhile interviews,
then these airwaves may not be
too small for the both of them.
And who knows there may even
be a decent reason to get up at 7
a.m., though our eyelids very
much doubt that.

NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE—Beyond being the top woman tennis
player in the world, Chris Evert is an entertainer. The thousands of
people who saw her win the Virginia Slims tennis tourney in San
Francisco last weekend saw more than just a sports personality. Her
good nature and off-court antics have entertained millions. In the
picture above, she is seen unleashing her two fisted backhand in the
finals of the doubles.

Interviews with Ronald Reagan
and even Roy Rodgers actually
contained some depth. And that is
exactly what AM America needs.
At this moment, Today has
nothing to fear. It has mastered
the secret of how to present
interviews and information in an
interesting manner. But this does
not mean that we discourage AM
America from trying.
On the contrary, we encourage
it to be different, to experiment,
to be creative. If it makes the
attempt to distinguish itself from
Today and allows its hbsts to
show their personalities while
conducting worthwhile interviews,
then these airwaves may not be
too small for the both of them.
And who knows there may even
be a decent reason to get up at 7
a.m., though our eyelids very
much doubt that.

NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE—Beyond being the top woman tennis
player in the world, Chris Evert is an entertainer. The thousands of
people who saw her win the Virginia Slims tennis tourney in San
Francisco last weekend saw more than just a sports personality. Her
good nature and off-court antics have entertained millions. In the
picture above, she is seen unleashing her two fisted backhand in the
finals of the doubles.
Getting up at 7 a.m. is indeed
an ungodly act. It is even more
ungodly when done solely to
watch television. Yet, ABC
executives are putting millions of
dollars into a new show called AM
America (which premiered last
week), with the belief that people
will do just that.
ABC's determination is
commendable, but we wish the
commercials for this program
would stop asking "How do you
wake up America?" until someone
comes up with a better answer.
Not that this show is terrible
but we already have a Today
program. Like that show, this one
attempts to keep America
informed. It even runs two hours
and has the familiar clock without
an hour hand. As opposed to
Today, it features fabulous
photographs and superb musical
interludes. But when these
become the focal point of the
show, you know something's
wrong.
What's wrong in this program is
that it falls flat when it attempts
to differentiate itself from Today.
It falls flat by becoming soporific
instead of energetic. The reasons
are twofold: dull personalities and
superficial stories. Only if it
corrects these flaws will this show
stand a chance.
Dull Hosts
Its dullness comes mainly in
the form of the hosts Stephanie
Edwards, Bill Beutel' and Peter
Jennings. We believe they can be
warm, interesting people. But,
currently, they seem as human as
Barbie, Ken and Brad dolls.
Edwards, a former actress who
worked in Los Angeles on Ralph
Story's AM, spends most of her

time giggling in a silly manner,
talking about trivia and reporting
the weather. She even has
problems doing that. Last
Monday, she commented, "The
only bright spot [in the nation] is
in central California" and then
went on to say that it would be
"clear throughout the
Southwest." Did our ears deceive
us? She even commented that
New York is "insulated from
rain." Wouldn't any good English
TA mark that as awkward usage?
It didn't deter Edwards.
Bad Interview
Not even her non-ability to
conduct an interview slowed her
down. She actually told Dustin
Hoffman, "It's a pleasure to see
you and hear you and smell you
and hopefully touch you." He
looked at her as strangely as we
did.
Beutel is not as silly as
Edwards but his personality seems
restricted to one word: nice.
Formerly an ABC weekend
newscaster, he is now the
personification of "nice." To
paraphrase a comment made by
Cleveland Amory, a fellow critic,
ABC seems to be allowing Beutel
two expressions: one is a smile
and one isn't.
His predicament is not all his
fault. Much of his less than human
image stems from the inane
activities he must perform. Last
Monday, he saluted "national pun
week" with such gems as:
"summer scholarships summer
paid for, summer not" and "I fed
my cat a lemon and now I've got a
sour puss." This made us want to
ask how many ABC newsmen it
takes to screw in a lightbulb.
The only person on this show

who comes off less than screwy is
Jennings. He is a competent,
dedicated newsman as evidenced
by his superb coverage of the
Arab terrorism during the '72
Olympics. He also delivers news
well on this show, but he should
participate in more serious and
in-depth interviews.
This show must change its
superficial, speedy pace and
convert to more thoughtful
features. Right now, AM America
reminds us of AM radio, not
because it features an endless
supply of cameoregulars
(including John Lindsay and
Ralph Story) but because it
provides us with a literal air raid, a
bombardment of segment after
segment, most of which are
shoddy.
Some ideas have been good.
The interviews with Sam Ervin
and Elliot Richardson concerning
CIA domestic spying, the
Meninger Brothers about the
fiftieth anniversary of their clinic
and Tom Corcoran, FDR's New
Deal economic advisor, had
potential.
But as soon as they approached
depth, either Edwards or Beutel
would say, "Well, that's all the
time we have" and then cut to a
commercial.

Jennings. He is a competent,
dedicated newsman as evidenced
by his superb coverage of the
Arab terrorism during the '72
Olympics. He also delivers news
well on this show, but he should
participate in more serious and
in-depth interviews.
This show must change its
superficial, speedy pace and
convert to more thoughtful
features. Right now, AM America
reminds us of AM radio, not
because it features an endless
supply of cameoregulars
(including John Lindsay and
Ralph Story) but because it
provides us with a literal air raid, a
bombardment of segment after
segment, most of which are
shoddy.
Some ideas have been good.
The interviews with Sam Ervin
and Elliot Richardson concerning
CIA domestic spying, the
Meninger Brothers about the
fiftieth anniversary of their clinic
and Tom Corcoran, FDR's New
Deal economic advisor, had
potential.
But as soon as they approached
depth, either Edwards or Beutel
would say, "Well, that's all the
time we have" and then cut to a
commercial.
Improved Depth
Last Friday, we saw an
improvement in this trend.
Interviews with Ronald Reagan
and even Roy Rodgers actually
contained some depth. And that is
exactly what AM America needs.
At this moment, Today has
nothing to fear. It has mastered
the secret of how to present
interviews and information in an
interesting manner. But this does
not mean that we discourage AM
America from trying.
On the contrary, we encourage
it to be different, to experiment,
to be creative. If it makes the
attempt to distinguish itself from
Today and allows its hbsts to
show their personalities while
conducting worthwhile interviews,
then these airwaves may not be
too small for the both of them.
And who knows there may even
be a decent reason to get up at 7
a.m., though our eyelids very
much doubt that.

NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE—Beyond being the top woman tennis
player in the world, Chris Evert is an entertainer. The thousands of
people who saw her win the Virginia Slims tennis tourney in San
Francisco last weekend saw more than just a sports personality. Her
good nature and off-court antics have entertained millions. In the
picture above, she is seen unleashing her two fisted backhand in the
finals of the doubles.
Getting up at 7 a.m. is indeed
an ungodly act. It is even more
ungodly when done solely to
watch television. Yet, ABC
executives are putting millions of
dollars into a new show called AM
America (which premiered last
week), with the belief that people
will do just that.
ABC's determination is
commendable, but we wish the
commercials for this program
would stop asking "How do you
wake up America?" until someone
comes up with a better answer.
Not that this show is terrible
but we already have a Today
program. Like that show, this one
attempts to keep America
informed. It even runs two hours
and has the familiar clock without
an hour hand. As opposed to
Today, it features fabulous
photographs and superb musical
interludes. But when these
become the focal point of the
show, you know something's
wrong.
What's wrong in this program is
that it falls flat when it attempts
to differentiate itself from Today.
It falls flat by becoming soporific
instead of energetic. The reasons
are twofold: dull personalities and
superficial stories. Only if it
corrects these flaws will this show
stand a chance.
Dull Hosts
Its dullness comes mainly in
the form of the hosts Stephanie
Edwards, Bill Beutel' and Peter
Jennings. We believe they can be
warm, interesting people. But,
currently, they seem as human as
Barbie, Ken and Brad dolls.
Edwards, a former actress who
worked in Los Angeles on Ralph
Story's AM, spends most of her

time giggling in a silly manner,
talking about trivia and reporting
the weather. She even has
problems doing that. Last
Monday, she commented, "The
only bright spot [in the nation] is
in central California" and then
went on to say that it would be
"clear throughout the
Southwest." Did our ears deceive
us? She even commented that
New York is "insulated from
rain." Wouldn't any good English
TA mark that as awkward usage?
It didn't deter Edwards.
Bad Interview
Not even her non-ability to
conduct an interview slowed her
down. She actually told Dustin
Hoffman, "It's a pleasure to see
you and hear you and smell you
and hopefully touch you." He
looked at her as strangely as we
did.
Beutel is not as silly as
Edwards but his personality seems
restricted to one word: nice.
Formerly an ABC weekend
newscaster, he is now the
personification of "nice." To
paraphrase a comment made by
Cleveland Amory, a fellow critic,
ABC seems to be allowing Beutel
two expressions: one is a smile
and one isn't.
His predicament is not all his
fault. Much of his less than human
image stems from the inane
activities he must perform. Last
Monday, he saluted "national pun
week" with such gems as:
"summer scholarships summer
paid for, summer not" and "I fed
my cat a lemon and now I've got a
sour puss." This made us want to
ask how many ABC newsmen it
takes to screw in a lightbulb.
