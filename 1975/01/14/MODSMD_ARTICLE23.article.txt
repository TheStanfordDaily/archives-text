# S.F. Symphony
## Season Opens Well 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
The San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra opened its 60th year
last week with a varied and
unusual program.
The Orchestra opened with
Haydn's Symphony No. 31 in D
Major (Horn Signal). One of
Haydn's early symphonies, this
work is not characteristic of his
historical reputation as a
"classical" composer, but is a
unique cross between a concerto
grosso and a symphony. The
horns, violin, cello and bass have
thematic solo passages while a
tutti orchestra contrasts, making
this a beautiful work.
The horns, having most of the
solos in this piece, displayed their
excellence and virtuosity by
near-perfect entrances and clear
intonation. Because of its range
and delicacy the horn is one of
the most difficult instruments to
play, but the soloists were
obviously well-prepared.
Good Bass
The bassist also played
excellently a part that requires a
skillful use of the upper register.
The bassist was able to
overcome the hazards of the
absurdly difficult passages and
create a very musical and soloistic
interpretation.
The violinist and cellist did n6t
fare so well. Both had intonation
problems. The violinist was a bit
shaky in some passages, and the
cellist sounded as though he
simply hadn't practiced a part
that isn't all that difficult.
The Orchestra premiered a

work by Gyorgy Ligeti, entitled
San Francisco Polyphony,
commissioned by the San
Francisco Symphony Association
in honor of the Symphony's 60th
birthday.
First Recognition
Ligeti first attained public
recognition by the unauthorized
use of his music in the film 2001;
since then he has become more in
demand as a composer and
lecturer.
The work is a radical departure
from the known or expected, and
is difficult to relate to with any
traditional musical background. It
is a very futuristic, "outer limits"
composition of neatly organized
sounds, from the heavy
mechanical timpani to the
delicately light and ethereal string
tones. Congratulations should be
given the Orchestra for playing so
difficult a piece so well. Some
birthday present.
The final work was Brahms'
Symphony No. 1 in C Minor,
Opus 68.
This symphony is a perfect
example of his genius. It is a very
romantic, personally
communicative and sensitive
work, with a uniquely dramatic
flavor. Here the Orchestra was the
most expressive, evoking the
emotions that Brahms had in
mind. Except for a few breaks in
continuity in the second
movement, the Orchestra finished
with an exciting and powerful
brilliance that generally
characterizes these fine musicians.
