# New Shakespeare Wastes Energy
## 
### ANN HOFFMAN 
Like a persistent TV
commercial, the New Shakespeare
Company, now performing in San
Francisco, is over-anxious to tell
us what is new and improved
about its product.
Margrit Roma, the company's
director maintains that what
makes her interpretations of
Shakespeare "new" is her "search
for truth."
According to Roma,
"Shakespeare hits you only when
you come to him naked."
However, it is the actors and not
the viewers that are immodestly
exposed. In attempting to give
Shakespeare a supposedly new
and upbeat meaning, filled with
social significance, Roma has
stretched the dramatic structure
to its limit, forcing the actors to
strain their performances, and in
many cases to falsify the
characterizations.
Roma's unfortunate search for
truth is a mere catch-all for
pretense and self-indulgence.
Through Shakespeare, she states,
the actor "will reveal the truth of
the human condition as he, as an
individual, experiences and lives
it." Consequently Roma's actors
look like wayward performers
from Hair, who are still searching
for self-identity.
All Bad Points
Last Friday night's
performance of the Merchant of
Venice demonstrated clearly all
that can go wrong with the
dramatic embodiment of Roma's
philosophy. She has chosen to
present the play against a
"background" of Venetian
anti-Semitism, a background that
supposedly gives the play a "new
meaning" and makes the
characters "real." This annoying
interpretation assumes that
Shakespeare did not really
understand his own work.
Roma's production of the play
could justly be subtitled Shylock's
Revenge. Here, the greedy
moneylender is portrayed as a
persecuted, solemn, almost tragic
figure, who looks like a Jewish
patriarch. We seem to be expected
to forget that Shylock did
demand a pound of flesh and
instead we are encouraged to
sympathize with him.

In the trial scene the other
characters spit on Shylock to the
point of ridiculousness, but are we
really supposed to accept this as
adequate justification for
Shylock's mode of revenge?
To accommodate this
interpretation of Shylock, all the
other characters must be falsely
and disastrously realigned,
Antonio consequently appears to
be an arrogant bigot. Portia looks
like a pouty model for a teen
magazine and shows only slightly
more depth of character.
Frenetic Pace
In order to maintain this
"background" of persecution,
Roma has chosen to conduct the
performance at a frenzied pace.
There was no intermission. Since
all the scenes were played to
exhaustion, the climactic
moments, such as Shylock's
monologue or the trial, were
indistinguishable from the rest of
the unrelieved madness. The
actors often spoke so fast that the
dialogue was incomprehensible.
The entire performance
produced a sense of forced
spontaneity, as though the actors
had mistaken intensity for good
acting.
Roma started* the new
Shakespeare Company in 1966,
after trying for 20 years to
establish a permanent professional
company. The group is now
supported by the city of San
Francisco through a yearly grant
and tours throughout the country.
The Company will be performing
different Shakespearean works at
the Civic Center until Jan. 25.
At the close of Friday's
performance one of the players
cited the group's continued
persistence in attempting to gain
legitimacy. The Company
originally performed free of
charge in parks and public places.
It is unfortunate however, in the
case of the New Shakespeare
Company, that persistence and
enthusiasm are so misguided.

after trying for 20 years to
establish a permanent professional
company. The group is now
supported by the city of San
Francisco through a yearly grant
and tours throughout the country.
The Company will be performing
different Shakespearean works at
the Civic Center until Jan. 25.
At the close of Friday's
performance one of the players
cited the group's continued
persistence in attempting to gain
legitimacy. The Company
originally performed free of
charge in parks and public places.
It is unfortunate however, in the
case of the New Shakespeare
Company, that persistence and
enthusiasm are so misguided.
Like a persistent TV
commercial, the New Shakespeare
Company, now performing in San
Francisco, is over-anxious to tell
us what is new and improved
about its product.
Margrit Roma, the company's
director maintains that what
makes her interpretations of
Shakespeare "new" is her "search
for truth."
According to Roma,
"Shakespeare hits you only when
you come to him naked."
However, it is the actors and not
the viewers that are immodestly
exposed. In attempting to give
Shakespeare a supposedly new
and upbeat meaning, filled with
social significance, Roma has
stretched the dramatic structure
to its limit, forcing the actors to
strain their performances, and in
many cases to falsify the
characterizations.
Roma's unfortunate search for
truth is a mere catch-all for
pretense and self-indulgence.
Through Shakespeare, she states,
the actor "will reveal the truth of
the human condition as he, as an
individual, experiences and lives
it." Consequently Roma's actors
look like wayward performers
from Hair, who are still searching
for self-identity.
All Bad Points
Last Friday night's
performance of the Merchant of
Venice demonstrated clearly all
that can go wrong with the
dramatic embodiment of Roma's
philosophy. She has chosen to
present the play against a
"background" of Venetian
anti-Semitism, a background that
supposedly gives the play a "new
meaning" and makes the
characters "real." This annoying
interpretation assumes that
Shakespeare did not really
understand his own work.
Roma's production of the play
could justly be subtitled Shylock's
Revenge. Here, the greedy
moneylender is portrayed as a
persecuted, solemn, almost tragic
figure, who looks like a Jewish
patriarch. We seem to be expected
to forget that Shylock did
demand a pound of flesh and
instead we are encouraged to
sympathize with him.

In the trial scene the other
characters spit on Shylock to the
point of ridiculousness, but are we
really supposed to accept this as
adequate justification for
Shylock's mode of revenge?
To accommodate this
interpretation of Shylock, all the
other characters must be falsely
and disastrously realigned,
Antonio consequently appears to
be an arrogant bigot. Portia looks
like a pouty model for a teen
magazine and shows only slightly
more depth of character.
Frenetic Pace
In order to maintain this
"background" of persecution,
Roma has chosen to conduct the
performance at a frenzied pace.
There was no intermission. Since
all the scenes were played to
exhaustion, the climactic
moments, such as Shylock's
monologue or the trial, were
indistinguishable from the rest of
the unrelieved madness. The
actors often spoke so fast that the
dialogue was incomprehensible.
The entire performance
produced a sense of forced
spontaneity, as though the actors
had mistaken intensity for good
acting.

Shakespeare Company in 1966,
