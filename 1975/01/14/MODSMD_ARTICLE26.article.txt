Democrats Outline Economic Plan
WASHINGTON House Democratic leaders set out
economic relief policies yesterday with priority on a tax cut
and more jobs just hours before President Ford disclosed
his economic program in a prime-time television speech.
Speaker Carl Albert said he expected House action
within 60 days on legislation to cut taxes from between
$lO billion and $2O billion for low and moderate income
persons.
All legislation will be analyzed for its impact on
unemployment, he said, and speedy consideration will be
given bills to create new jobs.
"We mean business. We intend to act," Albert told a
news conference where a Democratic task force unveiled its
urgent economic relief package.
He said he had assured Ford that "we will cooperate
wherever we could."
It had been expected that Ford would announce his
economic program in his State of the Union address to
Congress tomorrow.
Ford To Pick Black Cabinet Member
WASHINGTON President Ford plans to nominate a
Philadelphia lawyer with a background in civil rights
litigation as his new secretary of transportation, a White
House official confirmed yesterday.
William T. Coleman Jr., a former president of the
NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund, would
become the second black Cabinet officer in the nation's
history if confirmed by the Senate.
Coleman, 54, is a Harvard Law School graduate and a
Republican. He has little background in transportation
although he currently is a member of the board of directors
of Pan American World Airways a company whose
financial problems have taken up a large amount of the
Transportation Department's time this past year.
Terrorists Fire At Israeli Airliner
PARIS Two terrorists drove into Orly Airport with
bazookas yesterday and fired armor-piercing rockets,
apparently aiming at an Israeli airliner taxiing for take off
to New York with scores of Americans aboard, police said.
The rockets shot past the El A1 Boeing 707 and struck a
parked Yugoslav jetliner and the airport administration
building.
Three persons were injured, a Yugoslav steward, a
policeman and a baggage handler, but damage was slight.
"I think the terrorists aimed too high," said El A1
spokesman Paul Jiniewski.
He said there were 136 passengers about 80 percent
Americans and 12 crewmen aboard El Al's Tel Aviv-New
York flight. He said they remained unaware of the attack
until the flight was called back to its gate. The flight left
two hours later.
No terrorist organization claimed responsibility for the
attack and the police reported no clues to the identity of
the assailants.
Former CIA Directors Testify
WASHINGTON Former CIA Director James R.
Schlesinger said yesterday that a review of agency activities
shortly after he took over uncovered a small number of
"misdemeanors."
Schlesinger, now secretary of defense, was interviewed
by a blue-ribbon panel appointed by President Ford to
investigate allegations the / Central Intelligence Agency
engaged in illegal domestic spying.
In its first session, the eight-man panel heard in closed
session from CIA Director William E. Colby and two of his
predecessors, Schlesinger and Richard Helms.
Colby, who was expected to tell the panel what he
learned from his own investigation of the allegations,
entered the meeting shortly after the chairman, Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller, said, "this commission has
but one purpose, we're going to get to the bottom of this
problem."
Schlesinger, who headed the spy agency for six months

in 1973, told reporters that the panel asked him about "the
necessity for an effective intelligence organization and some
of my experiences in it."
Hijacking Attempt Foiled
WASHINGTON A passenger tried to divert an Eastern
Air Lines 727 jetliner to San Juan, Puerto Rico, yesterday
but was captured without injury after the plane made an
emergency refueling stop at nearby Dulles International
Airport, authorities said.
Federal Aviation Administration Police said the man
made known his intentions as the plane, Flight 140, was
over Lynchburg, Va., en route from Atlanta to
Philadelphia. The flight originated in Melbourne, Fla.
The tall, heavyset suspect, identified as Leighton Wright,
46, of Atlanta, was unarmed, police said.
He was taken before a U.S. magistrate in Alexandria,
Va., and arraigned on charges of air piracy and interfering
with an airline crew.
Authorities in Georgia said Wright had been furloughed
from a state mental institution a week ago.
Analyst: Brown Budget Unrealistic
SACRAMENTO Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s
pennypinching $11.3 billion state budget is "somewhat
unrealistic," legislative anlayst A. Alan Post said yesterday.
The nonpartisan analyst told the Senate Finance
Committee that Brown attempted to present a balanced
budget to the legislature, but "he didn't quite make it."
Post said Brown's budget proposal for the 1975-76 fiscal
year may overestimate state revenues and underestimate
spending, particularly for welfare and education.
"All of that makes it somewhat unrealistic," he said. He
added that the governor's economic projections may be
over optimistic.
"There is only a slim possibility that economic
conditions will be more favorable than forecasted, while
there is a stronger possibility they could be worse," Post
said.
Post said neither the 4.6 percent total growth figure
calculated for Brown's budget nor the 5.9 percent increase
calculated for all funds except bonds is an accurate estimate
of budget growth.
NAACP To Elect Woman Leader?
NEW YORK The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People was expected yesterday to
elect its first black woman board chairman.
Margaret Bush Wilson, 55, a lawyer from St. Louis, was
expected to defeat three other candidates to head the
400,000 member civil rights organization.
She would be the second woman chairman. Mary White
Ovington, a white woman who was a founder of the
NAACP, served as acting chairman and then chairman from
1917 to 1932.
High Court Revokes Liddy's Bail

for former President Richard M. Nixon's 1973 re-election
committee, was one of seven men convicted of burglarizing

Terrorists Fire At Israeli Airliner
PARIS Two terrorists drove into Orly Airport with
bazookas yesterday and fired armor-piercing rockets,
apparently aiming at an Israeli airliner taxiing for take off
to New York with scores of Americans aboard, police said.
The rockets shot past the El A1 Boeing 707 and struck a
parked Yugoslav jetliner and the airport administration
building.
Three persons were injured, a Yugoslav steward, a
policeman and a baggage handler, but damage was slight.
"I think the terrorists aimed too high," said El A1
spokesman Paul Jiniewski.
He said there were 136 passengers about 80 percent
Americans and 12 crewmen aboard El Al's Tel Aviv-New
York flight. He said they remained unaware of the attack
until the flight was called back to its gate. The flight left
two hours later.
No terrorist organization claimed responsibility for the
attack and the police reported no clues to the identity of
the assailants.
Former CIA Directors Testify
WASHINGTON Former CIA Director James R.
Schlesinger said yesterday that a review of agency activities
shortly after he took over uncovered a small number of
"misdemeanors."
Schlesinger, now secretary of defense, was interviewed
by a blue-ribbon panel appointed by President Ford to
investigate allegations the / Central Intelligence Agency
engaged in illegal domestic spying.
In its first session, the eight-man panel heard in closed
session from CIA Director William E. Colby and two of his
predecessors, Schlesinger and Richard Helms.
Colby, who was expected to tell the panel what he
learned from his own investigation of the allegations,
entered the meeting shortly after the chairman, Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller, said, "this commission has
but one purpose, we're going to get to the bottom of this
problem."
Schlesinger, who headed the spy agency for six months

in 1973, told reporters that the panel asked him about "the
necessity for an effective intelligence organization and some
of my experiences in it."
Hijacking Attempt Foiled
WASHINGTON A passenger tried to divert an Eastern
Air Lines 727 jetliner to San Juan, Puerto Rico, yesterday
but was captured without injury after the plane made an
emergency refueling stop at nearby Dulles International
Airport, authorities said.
Federal Aviation Administration Police said the man
made known his intentions as the plane, Flight 140, was
over Lynchburg, Va., en route from Atlanta to
Philadelphia. The flight originated in Melbourne, Fla.
The tall, heavyset suspect, identified as Leighton Wright,
46, of Atlanta, was unarmed, police said.
He was taken before a U.S. magistrate in Alexandria,
Va., and arraigned on charges of air piracy and interfering
with an airline crew.
Authorities in Georgia said Wright had been furloughed
from a state mental institution a week ago.
Analyst: Brown Budget Unrealistic
SACRAMENTO Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s
pennypinching $11.3 billion state budget is "somewhat
unrealistic," legislative anlayst A. Alan Post said yesterday.
The nonpartisan analyst told the Senate Finance
Committee that Brown attempted to present a balanced
budget to the legislature, but "he didn't quite make it."
Post said Brown's budget proposal for the 1975-76 fiscal
year may overestimate state revenues and underestimate
spending, particularly for welfare and education.
"All of that makes it somewhat unrealistic," he said. He
added that the governor's economic projections may be
over optimistic.
"There is only a slim possibility that economic
conditions will be more favorable than forecasted, while
there is a stronger possibility they could be worse," Post
said.
Post said neither the 4.6 percent total growth figure
calculated for Brown's budget nor the 5.9 percent increase
calculated for all funds except bonds is an accurate estimate
of budget growth.

Analyst: Brown Budget Unrealistic
SACRAMENTO Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.'s
pennypinching $11.3 billion state budget is "somewhat
unrealistic," legislative anlayst A. Alan Post said yesterday.
The nonpartisan analyst told the Senate Finance
Committee that Brown attempted to present a balanced
budget to the legislature, but "he didn't quite make it."
Post said Brown's budget proposal for the 1975-76 fiscal
year may overestimate state revenues and underestimate
spending, particularly for welfare and education.
"All of that makes it somewhat unrealistic," he said. He
added that the governor's economic projections may be
over optimistic.
"There is only a slim possibility that economic
conditions will be more favorable than forecasted, while
there is a stronger possibility they could be worse," Post
said.
Post said neither the 4.6 percent total growth figure
calculated for Brown's budget nor the 5.9 percent increase
calculated for all funds except bonds is an accurate estimate
of budget growth.

predecessors, Schlesinger and Richard Helms.
Colby, who was expected to tell the panel what he
learned from his own investigation of the allegations,
entered the meeting shortly after the chairman, Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller, said, "this commission has
but one purpose, we're going to get to the bottom of this
problem."
Schlesinger, who headed the spy agency for six months

in 1973, told reporters that the panel asked him about "the
necessity for an effective intelligence organization and some
of my experiences in it."
