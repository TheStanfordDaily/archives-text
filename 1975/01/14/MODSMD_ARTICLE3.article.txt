# Gibbs Recommends Elimination Of SWOPSI, SCIRE Programs
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs will recommend to
Provost William F. Miller today that
SCIRE and the Undergraduate Writing
Program (UWP) end this June and that
SWOPSI and Urban Studies end in
June 1976.
"From now on, our policy should
be to support 'innovative' or
'experimental' programs only for a
fixed period of time, regardless of the
interest or support that remains at the
end of this period," Gibbs says in the
recommendation.
"If a program is to continue, it
should then be absorbed elsewhere in
the University."
Gibbs released the statement last
night after the Daily learned of the
impending cutbacks.
ASSU Sen. William Hoke, chairman
of the Senate's budget priorities
subcommittee, says, "The ASSU will
issue a report on this. Certainly we are
concerned and we just won't let it go
by."
Student Voice
"I will help get the student voice on
this issue, which has not been heard,"
says ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton, a
member of Hoke's subcommittee. "I
couldn't believe it when I heard it.
Innovative education has to be
represented [here] because of the
higher tuition rates."
Silton adds that with the increased
education costs, programs like
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues) and SCIRE
(the Stanford Center for Innovation
and Research in Education) help
attract good students to the
University.
However, Gibbs emphasizes that
other undergraduate studies programs
will continue in 1975-76. These
include! the Academic Information
Center (AIC), the program of seminars
for entering students, the freshman
honors tutorial program, the Learning
Assistance Center and the

Undergraduate Special Program.
Nevertheless, each continuing
program, he says, will face cuts in
budget and staff.
The programs that Gibbs
recommends be phased out would be
given "highest priority" consideration
to operate in academic departments.
"Given the current fiscal
constraints," he says, "existing
experimental programs should be
terminated when it is clear their
functions could be performed
elsewhere or where the University has
had adequate time to learn all it can
about what they [the programs] can
contribute to undergraduate education

and how these contributions may be
incorporated into its regular
programs."
Budgets Total $lOB,OOO
The Undergraduate Writing
Program operates with a $58,000
yearly budget. SCIRE and SWOPSI are
given $25,000 annually, a source said,
listing approximate figures.
Ellen Nold, director of the UWP,
explains that the decision to cut the
program was her own. "Given the
budget presented for next year, I
would have had a skeletal program,"
she said.
The English Department will be
asked to take over some of the tutorial
writing programs, Nold said. All the

courses in the program are well
received and the "upper division
writing classes are super popular," she
maintains.
In the recommendation to the
Provost, Gibbs says that "several UWP
courses would be taught by the
Department of English under the
freshman writing program.
Cloudy Future
"Prof. Wilfred Stone, director of
freshman writing, has promised to
continue some of the innovations
pioneered by UWP." The fate of the
upper division courses, however,
remains in doubt.
Gibbs recommends that the
functions of SCIRE "be absorbed
elsewhere in the dean's office, with
SCIRE Director Alice Supton
replacing an assistant to the dean. In
this position, Supton would spend
half-time coordinating student projects
and programs."
Both SWOPSI and Urban Studies
would use 1975-76 as a transitional
year to see how their functions could
also be absorbed in the University.
"SWOPSI would work actively to
prepare materials that would help
faculty who wish to use a workshop
format or field learning in their
courses," Gibbs says.
An ad hoc committee would be
appointed, under Gibbs' plan, to
determine the future of the Urban
Studies program. The committee
might explore the feasibility of the
program's becoming a part of a school
or department.
Gibbs approves of more student
input into budget cutting decisions.
"Whatever forum students are in, they
should speak up," he says.

The Undergraduate Writing
Program operates with a $58,000
yearly budget. SCIRE and SWOPSI are
given $25,000 annually, a source said,
listing approximate figures.
Ellen Nold, director of the UWP,
explains that the decision to cut the
program was her own. "Given the
budget presented for next year, I
would have had a skeletal program,"
she said.
The English Department will be
asked to take over some of the tutorial
writing programs, Nold said. All the

courses in the program are well
received and the "upper division
writing classes are super popular," she
maintains.
In the recommendation to the
Provost, Gibbs says that "several UWP
courses would be taught by the
Department of English under the
freshman writing program.
Cloudy Future
"Prof. Wilfred Stone, director of
freshman writing, has promised to
continue some of the innovations
pioneered by UWP." The fate of the
upper division courses, however,
remains in doubt.
Gibbs recommends that the
functions of SCIRE "be absorbed
elsewhere in the dean's office, with
SCIRE Director Alice Supton
replacing an assistant to the dean. In
this position, Supton would spend
half-time coordinating student projects
and programs."
Both SWOPSI and Urban Studies
would use 1975-76 as a transitional
year to see how their functions could
also be absorbed in the University.
"SWOPSI would work actively to
prepare materials that would help
faculty who wish to use a workshop
format or field learning in their
courses," Gibbs says.
An ad hoc committee would be
appointed, under Gibbs' plan, to
determine the future of the Urban
Studies program. The committee
might explore the feasibility of the
program's becoming a part of a school
or department.
Gibbs approves of more student
input into budget cutting decisions.
"Whatever forum students are in, they
should speak up," he says.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs will recommend to
Provost William F. Miller today that
SCIRE and the Undergraduate Writing
Program (UWP) end this June and that
SWOPSI and Urban Studies end in
June 1976.
"From now on, our policy should
be to support 'innovative' or
'experimental' programs only for a
fixed period of time, regardless of the
interest or support that remains at the
end of this period," Gibbs says in the
recommendation.
"If a program is to continue, it
should then be absorbed elsewhere in
the University."
Gibbs released the statement last
night after the Daily learned of the
impending cutbacks.
ASSU Sen. William Hoke, chairman
of the Senate's budget priorities
subcommittee, says, "The ASSU will
issue a report on this. Certainly we are
concerned and we just won't let it go
by."
Student Voice
"I will help get the student voice on
this issue, which has not been heard,"
says ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton, a
member of Hoke's subcommittee. "I
couldn't believe it when I heard it.
Innovative education has to be
represented [here] because of the
higher tuition rates."
Silton adds that with the increased
education costs, programs like
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues) and SCIRE
(the Stanford Center for Innovation
and Research in Education) help
attract good students to the
University.
However, Gibbs emphasizes that
other undergraduate studies programs
will continue in 1975-76. These
include! the Academic Information
Center (AIC), the program of seminars
for entering students, the freshman
honors tutorial program, the Learning
Assistance Center and the

Undergraduate Special Program.
Nevertheless, each continuing
program, he says, will face cuts in
budget and staff.
The programs that Gibbs
recommends be phased out would be
given "highest priority" consideration
to operate in academic departments.
"Given the current fiscal
