# Council Wants Environmental Study
## No Decision On Willow Road 
### JON BIGELOW 
In its regular meeting last night, the
Palo Alto City Council once again
deferred final action on the proposed
Willow Road widening and extension.
A motion by Councilwoman Enid
Pearson, providing for the Willow
Road question to pass first before the
City Planning Commission and for that
body to make recommendations to the
Council, passed 8-0. The ninth
member of the Council, Mayor Byron
Sher, has not participated in discussion
of the Willow Road issue because of a
conflict of interest. Sher is a Stanford
law professor.
Pearson's motion also authorized
the city to hire a planning consultant
to prepare an environmental impact
report (EIR), to be used by the
Planning Commission and by the
Council.
This action by the Council could
delay resolution of the matter for
some time to come.
The city has for some time
considered the widening of Willow

Road and its extension through a
grove of eucalyptus and oak trees to El
Camino Real. It has received a great
deal of encouragement from the
University concerning the widening,
but has been unable to decide on the
exact nature of the project.
A total of nine proposals, including
"Alternate N" (no widening or
extension) and a proposal to re-route
Willow Road traffic onto Arboretum
and Quarry Roads, have appeared over
the past few months. Ther6 seems to
be growing citizen sentiment against
any widening whatsoever.
Last night's public testimony
concerning the issue was in marked
contrast to that of last week's meeting,
when the topic was originally brought
up. The great bulk of testimony last
week was vehemently opposed to the
widening itself; last night, however,
those speaking before the Council gave
their support, citing the congestion on
the present Willow Road.
One speaker, Scott Carey, was wary
of what he termed the "political" tone

of the issue. "Are we really talking
about strangling the University, which
has given so much to this
community?" he asked, "or about
choking off the shopping center?"
If some were skeptical of the
Council's motives, others were
unhappy about the heavy emphasis
which environmentalists have placed
on blocking the widening. In response
to the allegation that the proposed
improvements might result in a
"Willow Expressway," one speaker,
Elsie Beagle, said, "The Willow
Expressway issue is a paper tiger."
She went on to state that the need
to relieve traffic was more important
than the few trees which would be
sacrificed by the widening. "Public
interest should override the
environmental position," she told the
Council, and added, "the public is
dominated by an implacable green
thumb."
Robert Augsburger, University vice
president for business and finance,
called the future of Willow Road "an
issue of public policy." He added,
"Facilities that are of substantial
importance to the public lie along that
road; access to those facilities is now
poor, and if nothing is done, will get
worse, to the disadvantage of those
who own, operate and work in them
and to those who use them." These
facilities "are important to the people
of Palo Alto," Augsburger said.
Augsburger denied that the
widening would be only to the
University's private advantage, saying
"almost all actions of this Council
with respect to land use can be made
to appear to be for the purpose of
someone's private advantage."
In reply to fears voiced over the
"Willow Expressway," Augsburger
said, "Let me categorically state that
the University has no interest in such a
road. In fact, why would we?"
