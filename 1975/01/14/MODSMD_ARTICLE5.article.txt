# CAB May Rescind Anti-Charter Decision
## 
### MARK FUNK 
Pressure is mounting on the
five-member Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB) to rescind a ruling which would
effectively eliminate affinity group
charter flights, such as those currently
available to Stanford students through
the ASSU Travel Service.
Quinn Mayer, a vice president of
the ASSU, is coordinating efforts at
the University to inform students of
the possible cuts and lobbying
members of the California ,
congressional delegation, including
Democratic Senators Alan Cranston
and John Tunney and Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), for
support in the struggle with the CAB.
Apparently, Mayer and other
parties with a stake in the final CAB
decision are having some influence.
"We are making some headway," he
said. "A deadline for receipt of
comments and petitions, which was
originally set for mid-December, has
been moved back to the first week in
February.
"We feel that the ASSU Travel

Service is easily the most justifiable
student service we have," Mayer
continued. "Its popularity is reflected
in the number of seats we sell for our
flights." He said the new ruling would
affect 5000 clients here.
Mayer estimated that the student
charters gross over one-half million
dollars in revenue.
"We feel that this is a form of
financial aid for Stanford students that
we cannot afford to lose," Mayer
commented. He said that cheap
charter flights, which cost almost 50
percent less than most commercial
flights, have been positive inducements
for prospective students from the
Midwest and the East.
Bob Beach, manager of the travel
service, supported Mayer's claim. "We
served 1650 Stanford students, faculty
and staff over the Christmas holidays,"
he said. "This cut could seriously
affect the financial ability of some
people to return home for Christmas,
go back East for a job during the
summer or take a trip to Europe."
Accusing the CAB of callousness in
dealing with the needs of students,
Mayer said that the move would, in
essence, be price-setting on a
non-competitive basis.
A Ralph Nader-backed organization
in Washington, D.C., the Aviation
Consumer Action Project, contends
that any such move would be contrary
to the powers which Congress granted
the Board. Officially, it cannot set
prices.
The Justice Department has
concurred with the Project's opinion
and two branches of the department,
including the Anti-Trust Division, are
weighing the possibility of filing suit
against the CAB.
Mayer pointed out that the CAB
has proposed alternatives to the
affinity group charter, which is
defined by the Board as any
educational, social, fraternal, religious,
labor, professional or ethnic
organization not created for the
purpose of travel.
The one toward which the CAB is
seemingly leaning, travel group
charters, would require inclusion of
hotel accomodations upon destination
definitely unsuitable for needs of
Stanford students advance booking
and high cancellation payments.
"Also, under the current plan,"
Mayer added, "we can book a one-way
flight to Europe. Under the new one
this would be impossible."

for prospective students from the
Midwest and the East.
Bob Beach, manager of the travel
service, supported Mayer's claim. "We
served 1650 Stanford students, faculty
and staff over the Christmas holidays,"
he said. "This cut could seriously
affect the financial ability of some
people to return home for Christmas,
go back East for a job during the
summer or take a trip to Europe."
Accusing the CAB of callousness in
dealing with the needs of students,
Mayer said that the move would, in
essence, be price-setting on a
non-competitive basis.
A Ralph Nader-backed organization
in Washington, D.C., the Aviation
Consumer Action Project, contends
that any such move would be contrary
to the powers which Congress granted
the Board. Officially, it cannot set
prices.
The Justice Department has
concurred with the Project's opinion
and two branches of the department,
including the Anti-Trust Division, are
weighing the possibility of filing suit
against the CAB.
Mayer pointed out that the CAB
has proposed alternatives to the
affinity group charter, which is
defined by the Board as any
educational, social, fraternal, religious,
labor, professional or ethnic
organization not created for the
purpose of travel.
The one toward which the CAB is
seemingly leaning, travel group
charters, would require inclusion of
hotel accomodations upon destination
definitely unsuitable for needs of
Stanford students advance booking
and high cancellation payments.
"Also, under the current plan,"
Mayer added, "we can book a one-way
flight to Europe. Under the new one
this would be impossible."
Pressure is mounting on the
five-member Civil Aeronautics Board
(CAB) to rescind a ruling which would
effectively eliminate affinity group
charter flights, such as those currently
available to Stanford students through
the ASSU Travel Service.
Quinn Mayer, a vice president of
the ASSU, is coordinating efforts at
the University to inform students of
the possible cuts and lobbying
members of the California ,
congressional delegation, including
Democratic Senators Alan Cranston
and John Tunney and Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), for
support in the struggle with the CAB.
Apparently, Mayer and other
parties with a stake in the final CAB
decision are having some influence.
"We are making some headway," he
said. "A deadline for receipt of
comments and petitions, which was
originally set for mid-December, has
been moved back to the first week in
February.
"We feel that the ASSU Travel

Service is easily the most justifiable
student service we have," Mayer
continued. "Its popularity is reflected
in the number of seats we sell for our
flights." He said the new ruling would
affect 5000 clients here.
Mayer estimated that the student
charters gross over one-half million
dollars in revenue.
"We feel that this is a form of
financial aid for Stanford students that
we cannot afford to lose," Mayer
commented. He said that cheap
charter flights, which cost almost 50
percent less than most commercial
flights, have been positive inducements
for prospective students from the
Midwest and the East.
