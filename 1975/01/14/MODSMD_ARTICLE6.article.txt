# Guest Professorship To Chilean Scholar?
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
A Chilean scholar has been invited
here as a guest professor for spring
quarter, but his chances of filling the
post are "up in the air," Political
Science Prof. Richard Fagen disclosed
yesterday.
The ASSU Guest Professorship
Board offered the post to Hermann
Schwember, a former vice president
and professor at Chile's Catholic
University, after the Board's first
nominee, South Vietnamese journalist
Nguyen Huu Thai, was denied an exit
visa from Saigon this fall.
Schwember accepted the position
but was arrested last week as he was in
the process of leaving Chile, Fagen
elaborated.
The chances of getting a guest
professor here at all this year are "not
good," board member Kevin O'Grady
lamented. "We've had crummy luck."
Sit And Wait
Because of Schwember's current jail
plight, "there's not a whole lot we can
do but sit around and wait," O'Grady
said.
Fagen said Schwember had been
arrested before when police found his
name in the address book of a woman
arrested for leftist activities.
However, Fagen could only
speculate on Schwember's latest arrest.
"As they make arrests, interrogation
and torture, names of other persons
sometimes come up," he said.
Schwember held positions in the
Allende Administration in 1972-73 as
manager for engineering and
development of the Chilean Copper
Corporation and as secretary for the
food industry in the government's

development corporation, but he was
fired during the military coup last
year.
University Experience
In the early '7os, Schwember held
the positions of professor of
engineering, dean of students and vice
president for business affairs at
Catholic University. O'Grady said he
considers Schwember even more
qualified than Thai for the guest
professorship because Schwember
actually has been a faculty member at
a university.
O'Grady suggested that Schwember
would be most useful in the Values,
Technology and Society program here
because of his knowledge of
technological resources for human
devleopment and the role of
technology in a socialist society.
Yet the Political Science
Department is also willing to sponsor
the scholar, O'Grady continued.
Schwember has not been consulted as
to his preference, O'Grady said.
Students voted for a $1 fee
assessment to finance the guest
professorship last fall. About $BOOO of
the $lO,OOO collected will be used to
fund Schwember's professorship,
according to Jim Regan, a member of
the committee to invite Thai to
Stanford.
The additional $2OOO will be
reserved for Thai in the event he is
permitted to leave South Vietnam.
Although the Board no longer plans
to officially consider Thai as the guest
professor, Regan will continue to
lobby for Thai's release. The money
will be used to "fly him here and to
put him up," Regan said.

Schwember, a former vice president
and professor at Chile's Catholic
University, after the Board's first
nominee, South Vietnamese journalist
Nguyen Huu Thai, was denied an exit
visa from Saigon this fall.
Schwember accepted the position
but was arrested last week as he was in
the process of leaving Chile, Fagen
elaborated.
The chances of getting a guest
professor here at all this year are "not
good," board member Kevin O'Grady
lamented. "We've had crummy luck."
Sit And Wait
Because of Schwember's current jail
plight, "there's not a whole lot we can
do but sit around and wait," O'Grady
said.
Fagen said Schwember had been
arrested before when police found his
name in the address book of a woman
arrested for leftist activities.
However, Fagen could only
speculate on Schwember's latest arrest.
"As they make arrests, interrogation
and torture, names of other persons
sometimes come up," he said.
Schwember held positions in the
Allende Administration in 1972-73 as
manager for engineering and
development of the Chilean Copper
Corporation and as secretary for the
food industry in the government's

development corporation, but he was
fired during the military coup last
year.
University Experience
In the early '7os, Schwember held
the positions of professor of
engineering, dean of students and vice
president for business affairs at
Catholic University. O'Grady said he
considers Schwember even more
qualified than Thai for the guest
professorship because Schwember
actually has been a faculty member at
a university.
O'Grady suggested that Schwember
would be most useful in the Values,
Technology and Society program here
because of his knowledge of
technological resources for human
devleopment and the role of
technology in a socialist society.
Yet the Political Science
Department is also willing to sponsor
the scholar, O'Grady continued.
Schwember has not been consulted as
to his preference, O'Grady said.
Students voted for a $1 fee
assessment to finance the guest
professorship last fall. About $BOOO of
the $lO,OOO collected will be used to
fund Schwember's professorship,
according to Jim Regan, a member of
the committee to invite Thai to
Stanford.
The additional $2OOO will be
reserved for Thai in the event he is
permitted to leave South Vietnam.
Although the Board no longer plans
to officially consider Thai as the guest
professor, Regan will continue to
lobby for Thai's release. The money
will be used to "fly him here and to
put him up," Regan said.
A Chilean scholar has been invited
here as a guest professor for spring
quarter, but his chances of filling the
post are "up in the air," Political
Science Prof. Richard Fagen disclosed
yesterday.
