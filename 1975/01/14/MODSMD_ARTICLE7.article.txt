## CIA--Yes Or No? 
### 
Most of the current flap over accustations against the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is probably beside the
point. It may well be, when the smoke finally clears, that
the CIA has done very little in violation of its charter.
The charter is a fuzzily written document, and it does not
prohibit all CIA activity within the United States, as many
commentators have claimed. And the CIA can legally
expand operations if secretly authorized to do so by the
National Security Council. Thus much of the so-called
spying against the radical left may ultimately turn out to be
legal, if it indeed occurred.
What disturbs us more is that so many people are upset
merely because the CIA may have extended its operations
inside the United States. The real question we ought to be
asking is whether the CIA should be permitted to operate
outside of the U.S.
What is it the agency is up to that is so abhorrent when
practiced on Americans yet permissable when used against
citizens of other countries? It seems most Americans don't
mind if the CIA topples governments, opens mail and taps
phones as long as it happens somewhere else.
Military intelligence is fundamental to the security of any
nation, but most of this information is already gathered
electronically by the military itself. And the task of
combatting foreign intelligence within this country is
already committed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Just what purpose a super-secret agency with a budget of
millions of dollars serves is a subject that merits much
discussion.
Critics contend this question is unlikely to surface before
President Ford's newly appointed commission to investigate
the CIA. Probably not but then, the commission is not
evaluating the role of secret agencies in free society. It has
convened for the sole purpose of investigating the current
charges against the CIA and determining if the agency
overstepped its authority.
Because the commission is conducting an investigation
and not a trial, we are not as dismayed as some by the fact
that several commission members have peripheral ties to the
CIA. Their knowledge of the normal operating procedures of
an intelligence agency should be valuable to their inquiry.
However, we do believe President Ford should add three
or four more members to the panel. Its present composition
neglects the political left, and there are no confirmed critics
of the agency sitting on the panel. Certainly the public
would worry much less about a potential cover-up if Ford
.would include some members unsympathetic to the CIA.
: Congress could do its part to help the investigation by
"calling off the plethora of committees currently planning to
investigate the CIA. One joint congressional committee
should go ahead and conduct a probe of the agency; the
others they number four at this moment should desist.
If both Congress and Ford are investigating the CIA, we can
<be confident that most of the truth will eventually come to
light, but the present multitude of investigations can only
cloud the issue further.
Meanwhile, though, we hope Americans will be
considering the central question: should we keep the CIA?
