You can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other people have done it. People who
have different jobs, different IQs, different interests, different educations have
completed the course. Our graduates are people from all walks of life. These
people have all taken a course developed by Evelyn Wood, a promipent
educator. Practically all of them at least tripled their reading speed with equal or
better comprehension. Most have increased it even more.
Think for a moment what that means. All of them-even the slowest—now read
an average novel in less than two hours. They read an entire issue of Time or
Newsweek in 35 minutes. They don't skip or skim. They read every word. They
use no machines. Instead, they let the material they're reading determine how
fast they read. And mark this well: they actually understand more, remember
more, and enjoy, more than when they read slowly. That's right! They
understand more. They remember more. They enjoy more. You can do the same
thing—the place to learn more about it is at a free speed reading lesson.
This is the same course President Kennedy had his Joint Chiefs of Staff take.
The staff of' President Nixon completed this course in June 1970. The same one
Senators and Congressmen have taken.
Come to a Mini-Lesson and find out. It is free to you and you will leave with a
better understanding of why it works. One thing that might bother you about
your reading speed is that somepne might find out how slow it is. The
instructors at the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Free Speed Reading lesson
will let you keep your secret. It's true we practice the first step to improved
reading at a Mini-Lesson and we will increase your reading speed on the spot, but
the results will remain your secret. Plan to attend a free Mini-Lesson and learn
that it is possible to read 3-4-5 times faster, with comparable comprehension.
