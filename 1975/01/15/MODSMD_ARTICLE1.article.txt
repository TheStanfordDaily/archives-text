# Augsburger Says Car Fee Needed
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert R. Augsburger
yesterday said the University's
controversial $7.50 parking fee for
students is necfessary for "ready
identification of Stanford-related
vehicles," for easier administration of
scarce parking space and for
"generation of income."
Augsburger presented his rationale
in a letter to ASSU Senate Chairman
Lee Rosenbaum. The letter appeared
to be the Administration's response to
a unanimous Senate resolution urging
that students refuse to buy parking
stickers until the University clarifies
the purpose" of the fee.
The boycott was originally
suggested by the Escondido Village
Council in a Jan. 5 flyer. The Council
also urged students not to pay any
fines assessed for refusal to display the
parking stickers.
Police have insisted all along that
cars without the parking stickers will
be cited beginning Monday, when the
regulations become effective.
Augsburger explained that the
income from the stickers will go into
general University funds. He compared
the fee to a tax which "bears little or
no relationship to specific benefits
received by those individuals who pay
the tax."
Traffic-Related
The vice president also supported
the fee by noting the numerous
traffic-related expenses incurred by
the University.
"Traffic (not parking) enforcement
is estimated to cost between $BO,OOO
and $100,000." The letter says, "the
fire department estimates that they
had over 100 emergency-first aid calls
last year involving bicycles, autos or
pedestrians. All kinds of miscellaneous
items ranging from traffic signals to
public meetings cost money," the
letter continued. "And as everyone
knows, we have a huge backlog of road
repairs which have been deferred
during this period of limited financial

resources."
Augsburger admitted finding "some
merit to the argument that it is unfair
to limit parking availability for
on-campus student residents to the
lots adjacent to their place of
residence." But because of a "critical
shortage" of parking spaces caused by
construction, central campus spaces
must be reserved for students residing
off campus.
Escondido Village Council
President Kathy Colson called
Augsburger's statement "the same
story they were giving us before."
Colson claimed the fee is unfair to
Village residents, because they do not
have to use University roads to gain
access to their residences. Also,
because central campus parking is not
open to Village residents, Escondido
drivers do not need to use University
roads at all, she said.
She also objected to exempting
faculty and staff members from paying
the fee. Augsburger countered that
free parking for faculty and staff is a
benefit often given to employees by
the companies. "If we made the
faculty and staff pay, we'd probably
have to raise their salaries," he said.
ASSU Sen. Pieter Winsemius,
author of the Senate boycott
resolution, objected to Augsburger's
comparison of the fee to a tax, saying,
"I don't see any similarity." The fee
seems to discriminate between
on-campus and off-campus residents,
he added.
Both the ASSU Senate and the
Escondido Village Council are meeting
tonight and may take further action
on the parking fee. The Council has
been considering a class-action suit
against the University, but according
to Colson, it has also been exploring
other options.
