# Don't Waste Your Time On 'Time'
## 
### William Ross 
Does anyone at Stanford care what such
an inane publication as Time publishes?
Apparently many people here care very
much.
For example, I've heard several students
express alarm because Time published an
article last autumn about the supposed 3.55
grade point average (GPA) of the average
Stanford student.
In his Daily column on Jan. 10, Brian
Farrell predicted that graduate school deans,
having read the Time article, will now hold in
lower regard applications from students here.
Farrell lamented the unlikelihood of Time
ever publishing the revised, 3.41 figure.
Last week in his address to the Academic
Council, President Lyman noted with
pleasure that Time had published an article
about a survey in which Stanford graduate
schools received high rankings. Lyman
seemed to imply that favorable publicity
could encourage better qualified applicants
to apply to Stanford graduate schools.
In response to Farrell and Lyman, I say
that any graduate school whose deans rely on
Time for their knowledge of the other
schools' academic standards isn't worth
attending. Any student who allows Time to
influence his choice of graduate schools
probably isn't smart enough to attend any
one, except those whose deans learn about
the world through Time.
Serious 'Time'?
Unfortunately, all too many people take
Time seriously. It doesn't deserve the honor.
Many people wrongly believe that it is
generally accurate in its coverage, and for
some unknown reason many also consider it
a "liberal" publication. These assumptions
while not necessarily concommitant are
both wrong.

One must consider the two together,
however, because Time has often distorted
facts to promote its political views.
Henry Luce, co-founder of Time and its
sole publisher for 38 years, first used his
magazine as an instrument to attack the New
Deal. During the 19305, Time was fulsome in
its praise of fascism and was notoriously
anti-semitic, often using "Jew" as a
pejorative adjective preceding names.
Although Luce failed to force GOP
candidates on the public during those years,
he successfully projected the corrupt Chinese
Kuomintang as a virtuous political
organization, and he portrayed Chiang
Kai-Shek as a hero. Time's influence helped
turn American opinion and policy
bitterly against the Red Chinese, causing an
estrangement that lasted two decades. Luce
also fueled the Cold War against the Russians,
presenting them as unregenerate barbarians.
Stevenson 'Pink'?
Although Luce was an early foe of Joseph
McCarthy's, this didn't stop Luce from
implying that Adlai Stevenson was nearly a
communist. Time's shameful attacks on
Stevenson helped to sink his presidential bids
in 1952 and 1956.
Luce died in 1967, but Time hasn't
mellowed much. The magazine was late to
disparage American participation in the
Indochina War and has treated the last two
Democratic presidential nominees as though
they were virtual incompetents.
The magazine has always maintained a
pretense of objectivity. This has made Time
far more dangerous than if it had frankly
admitted its advocacy. Countless people have
childlessly accepted the loaded adjectives,
subtle headlines ("Adlai's Pitch" and
"Eisenhower's Promise" are 1956 examples)

and highly interpretive reporting as absolute
fact.
Even my own limited first-hand
knowledge of Time substantiates the
magazine's unreliability. Working last
summer in the office of a congressional
leader, I was consistently disturbed by Time's
altogether inaccurate coverage of events in
the office. Throughout most of the summer,
Time misrepresented the congressman's stand
on impeachment and once even published an
inaccurate ratio of the pro- and
anti-impeachment mail reaching the office.
Finely, although Time scatters its
correspondents throughout the world, its
reporters have done little investigative work.
The Pentagon Papers, Watergate, CIA and
other major stories in recent years have been
investigated by publications other than Time.
In fact, the magazine still somewhat
resembles the rewrite sheet that it once was.
Many people might argue that Time tends
to employ literate people to write, research
and edit it. This seems to me to be an
example of the ad hominem fallacy.
Certainly, many of Time's writers are
brilliant, but then so are some authors of pulp
novels.
I suppose Time is worth a glance each
week. The magazine has a few interesting
features, rehashes the week's news in an
entertaining fashion and publishes a few facts
that one mighfhave missed elsewhere.
But I'm appalled that so many people
dignify Time by quivering over whether it
will present news contrary to their interests.
Time simply isn't worth taking seriously.

investigated by publications other than Time.
In fact, the magazine still somewhat
resembles the rewrite sheet that it once was.
Many people might argue that Time tends
to employ literate people to write, research
and edit it. This seems to me to be an
example of the ad hominem fallacy.
Certainly, many of Time's writers are
brilliant, but then so are some authors of pulp
novels.
I suppose Time is worth a glance each
week. The magazine has a few interesting
features, rehashes the week's news in an
entertaining fashion and publishes a few facts
that one mighfhave missed elsewhere.
But I'm appalled that so many people
dignify Time by quivering over whether it
will present news contrary to their interests.
Time simply isn't worth taking seriously.

Does anyone at Stanford care what such
an inane publication as Time publishes?
Apparently many people here care very
much.
For example, I've heard several students
express alarm because Time published an
article last autumn about the supposed 3.55
grade point average (GPA) of the average
Stanford student.
In his Daily column on Jan. 10, Brian
Farrell predicted that graduate school deans,
having read the Time article, will now hold in
lower regard applications from students here.
Farrell lamented the unlikelihood of Time
ever publishing the revised, 3.41 figure.
Last week in his address to the Academic
Council, President Lyman noted with
pleasure that Time had published an article
about a survey in which Stanford graduate
schools received high rankings. Lyman
seemed to imply that favorable publicity
could encourage better qualified applicants
to apply to Stanford graduate schools.
In response to Farrell and Lyman, I say
that any graduate school whose deans rely on
Time for their knowledge of the other
schools' academic standards isn't worth
attending. Any student who allows Time to
influence his choice of graduate schools
probably isn't smart enough to attend any
one, except those whose deans learn about
the world through Time.
Serious 'Time'?
Unfortunately, all too many people take
Time seriously. It doesn't deserve the honor.
Many people wrongly believe that it is
generally accurate in its coverage, and for
some unknown reason many also consider it
a "liberal" publication. These assumptions
while not necessarily concommitant are
both wrong.

One must consider the two together,
however, because Time has often distorted
facts to promote its political views.
Henry Luce, co-founder of Time and its
sole publisher for 38 years, first used his
magazine as an instrument to attack the New
Deal. During the 19305, Time was fulsome in
its praise of fascism and was notoriously
anti-semitic, often using "Jew" as a
pejorative adjective preceding names.
Although Luce failed to force GOP
candidates on the public during those years,
he successfully projected the corrupt Chinese
Kuomintang as a virtuous political
organization, and he portrayed Chiang
Kai-Shek as a hero. Time's influence helped
turn American opinion and policy
bitterly against the Red Chinese, causing an
estrangement that lasted two decades. Luce
also fueled the Cold War against the Russians,
presenting them as unregenerate barbarians.
Stevenson 'Pink'?
Although Luce was an early foe of Joseph
McCarthy's, this didn't stop Luce from
implying that Adlai Stevenson was nearly a
communist. Time's shameful attacks on
Stevenson helped to sink his presidential bids
in 1952 and 1956.
Luce died in 1967, but Time hasn't
mellowed much. The magazine was late to
disparage American participation in the
Indochina War and has treated the last two
Democratic presidential nominees as though
they were virtual incompetents.
The magazine has always maintained a
pretense of objectivity. This has made Time
far more dangerous than if it had frankly
admitted its advocacy. Countless people have
childlessly accepted the loaded adjectives,
subtle headlines ("Adlai's Pitch" and
"Eisenhower's Promise" are 1956 examples)

and highly interpretive reporting as absolute
fact.
Even my own limited first-hand
knowledge of Time substantiates the
magazine's unreliability. Working last
summer in the office of a congressional
leader, I was consistently disturbed by Time's
altogether inaccurate coverage of events in
the office. Throughout most of the summer,
Time misrepresented the congressman's stand
on impeachment and once even published an
inaccurate ratio of the pro- and
anti-impeachment mail reaching the office.
Finely, although Time scatters its
correspondents throughout the world, its
reporters have done little investigative work.

admitted its advocacy. Countless people have
childlessly accepted the loaded adjectives,
subtle headlines ("Adlai's Pitch" and
"Eisenhower's Promise" are 1956 examples)

and highly interpretive reporting as absolute
fact.
Even my own limited first-hand
knowledge of Time substantiates the
magazine's unreliability. Working last
summer in the office of a congressional
leader, I was consistently disturbed by Time's
altogether inaccurate coverage of events in
the office. Throughout most of the summer,
Time misrepresented the congressman's stand
on impeachment and once even published an
inaccurate ratio of the pro- and
anti-impeachment mail reaching the office.
Finely, although Time scatters its
correspondents throughout the world, its
reporters have done little investigative work.
The Pentagon Papers, Watergate, CIA and
other major stories in recent years have been
investigated by publications other than Time.
In fact, the magazine still somewhat
resembles the rewrite sheet that it once was.
Many people might argue that Time tends
to employ literate people to write, research
and edit it. This seems to me to be an
example of the ad hominem fallacy.
Certainly, many of Time's writers are
brilliant, but then so are some authors of pulp
novels.
I suppose Time is worth a glance each
week. The magazine has a few interesting
features, rehashes the week's news in an
entertaining fashion and publishes a few facts
that one mighfhave missed elsewhere.
But I'm appalled that so many people
dignify Time by quivering over whether it
will present news contrary to their interests.
Time simply isn't worth taking seriously.
