# Walter Lippman: Voice Of Reason
## 
### Philip Feder 
Walter Lippmann a great
American journalist died in
December.
Lippmann had a close rapport
with Presidents, skeiks and kings.
But many observers of Lippmann
neglect to mention the
philosopher-journalist's Cold War
views that opposed those of cold
warriors Harry Truman, Dwight
Eisenhower and John Kennedy.
Throughout his post-World War
II writings, Lippmann attacked
the Cold War and the bellicose
containment policies of the
United States. He wrote that
America was panic-stricken at the
idea of a Soviet sphere of
influence in Eastern Europe and
was driving itself into a fury to
halt the so-called monolithic
behemoth of Communism.
The attacks were initially
directed towards President
Truman, whom Lippmann
thought reacted too impulsively
with the Truman Doctrine.
Instead of strengthening the
Western European alliance and
negotiating with the Russians,
Truman moved to stop
Communist aggression, Lippmann
said.
At a time when Americans
experienced Communist
witch-hunting at home and a
movement toward a position as
world policeman on the
international front, |Lippmann's
was a voice of restraint and
conciliation.
Insisted On Free World
However, he continually
insisted upon the maintenance of
the free world as a competing
economic force against
Communism. Rehabilitation of
western Europe would lead to a
restoration of the balance of
power, he said, and such an
achievement would preclude
Soviet world hegemony.
After 1947, it was abundantly
clear that Lippmann's views on
containment were unheeded in
the State Department.
Containment became standard
policy. With the advent of the
Vietnam "police action,"
Lippmann called for "rational
restraint" and negotiation.
Lippmann extended the notion
of rational restraint to become a
necessary cohdition for
co-existence.

"The kind of strength we have
and kind of resourcefulness we are
capable of showing are peculiarly
unsuited to operating a policy of
containment," Lippmann said.
Policy Continued
Containment continued into
the 1960s when Lippmann
commented on the Bay of Pigs
invasion: "I think success for the
Cuban adventure was impossible.
In a free society like ours a policy
is bound to fail which deliberately
violates our pledges and our
principles, our treaties and our
laws."
Lippmann counselled a policy
of patience and fortitude with the
ultimate end of negotiation.
In 1962, Lippmann warned,
"We have to be talking [with the
Russians], so that in case some
trouble comes, we can always
explain it to each other."
On the China question, he
supported the entrance of the
People's Republic into the United
Nations in 1960 well before the

ouster of Taiwan.
Lippmann was constantly
vulnerable to being branded as
"soft on communism" or as an
"appeaser." He opposed unilateral
action in Cuba while his plan for
negotiation during the Berlin crisis
might have involved concessions
to the Russians. To those
criticisms he answered, "You
can't decide these questions of life
and death for the world by
epithets like appeasement."
When he wrote on how to deal
with Communism, Lippmann
stressed the need for co-existence
with the Russians and with their
accompanying ideology. Still, the
United States should remain
strong and capable: "The real
issue is to keep the balance of
power between ourselves and the
Soviet Union intact."
This whole question of power
in the new post-war world order
was vital to America's well-being,
he said. The philosopher

Lippmann aptly pointed out: "It
was Aristotle who said that the
finest attribute of power is
restraint, and that there's nothing
so impressive as to have great
power and to use it
magnanimously, patiently and
with restraint."
In this manner, Lippmann
dealt with the Cold War era. He
constantly affirmed that the
troubles and disorders in the
world were too large for America
herself to solve.
Lippmann sought a negotiated
peace with the Soviets a modus
vivendi wherein the United
States and Russia could find a
way of living together.
In an epoch of containment
and witch-hunting, Walter
Lippmann was a rebel among the
establishment in the post war
world.
