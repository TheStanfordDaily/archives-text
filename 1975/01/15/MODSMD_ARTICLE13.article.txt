# Save Encina P.E. Facilities
## 
### Brian Boyd 
The University is planning to
close Encina Gym facilities to the
gymnasts, wrestlers, physical
education classes and club sports.
It plans to quietly reconvert
Encina to indoor basketball courts
in order to meet growing student
demand while disenfranchising its
present occupants. Although
basketball is permitted in Maples
Pavilion, demand is greater than
available space.
Unfortunately the athletic
facilities at the University are
limited during a real money
crunch with no alternatives to
alleviate them. Maples Pavilion
now caters to basketball,
volleyball, club sports and
exhibitions. Encina currently
services the wrestlers, gymnasts
and martial arts classes.
Both these facilities serve the
community in order to offer a
variety of physical outlets. By
changing Encina Gym, Stanford is
also changing its curriculum.
Students take these classes,

which will no longer be offered,
for credit. By eliminating this
variety the University not only
hurts the hundreds of present
student users, but it also deprives
the entire community of diverse
creative outlets.
Among the rumors echoing in
Encina Gym is "Title IX does it
again!" Many students believe
that the new federal government
regulation requiring colleges and
universities to offer women and
men the same opportunities in
sports is behind this latest
University plan. Since the
gymnasts and wrestlers do not
have coaches for women (though
one has offered) the
Administration will eliminate its
suability by eliminating the
sports.
The need for basketball courts
may be very real. The need for
indoor basketball courts is
questionable. Only during the few
rainy winter months is there an
indoor need. Maples Pavilion

satisfies that need. The gymnasts,
wrestlers, and martial arts
practitioners use the mats and
other equipment which cannot be
used outdoors.
All these expensive materials
will go unused in the planned
storage. The present users are less
of a drain on school resources.
They meet during the day, don't
use night lights, use no heat, don't
require refurbishing the gym and
new equipment and even clean the
gym after use.
It is unfair for the University
to create more space for a sport
they already provide for, while
annih dating other sports
completely.
* Anyone interested in voicing
their opinions should attend the
Jan. 15 meeting of the Athletic
Board Advisory Council at 7:30
p.m. in Room 215 of the Law
School.

to create more space for a sport

completely.

The University is planning to
close Encina Gym facilities to the
gymnasts, wrestlers, physical
education classes and club sports.
It plans to quietly reconvert
Encina to indoor basketball courts
in order to meet growing student
demand while disenfranchising its
present occupants. Although
basketball is permitted in Maples
Pavilion, demand is greater than
available space.
Unfortunately the athletic
facilities at the University are
limited during a real money
crunch with no alternatives to
alleviate them. Maples Pavilion
now caters to basketball,
volleyball, club sports and
exhibitions. Encina currently
services the wrestlers, gymnasts
and martial arts classes.
Both these facilities serve the
community in order to offer a
variety of physical outlets. By
changing Encina Gym, Stanford is
also changing its curriculum.
Students take these classes,

which will no longer be offered,
for credit. By eliminating this
variety the University not only
hurts the hundreds of present
student users, but it also deprives
the entire community of diverse
creative outlets.
Among the rumors echoing in
Encina Gym is "Title IX does it
again!" Many students believe
that the new federal government
regulation requiring colleges and
universities to offer women and
men the same opportunities in
sports is behind this latest
University plan. Since the
gymnasts and wrestlers do not
have coaches for women (though
one has offered) the
Administration will eliminate its
suability by eliminating the
sports.
The need for basketball courts
may be very real. The need for
indoor basketball courts is
questionable. Only during the few
rainy winter months is there an
indoor need. Maples Pavilion

satisfies that need. The gymnasts,
wrestlers, and martial arts
practitioners use the mats and
other equipment which cannot be
used outdoors.
All these expensive materials
will go unused in the planned
storage. The present users are less
of a drain on school resources.
