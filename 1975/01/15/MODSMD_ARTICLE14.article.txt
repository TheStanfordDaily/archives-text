Writing Program Gone

Editor:
Unknown to most of
academic community, the
University has silently abolished
the invaluable Undergraduate
Writing Program. In its necessary
effort to economize, Stanford has
chosen to cut the "superfluous"
programs in favor of the
departments.
The tutorials and classes within
the Writing Program provide an
essential service to both the
students who find written
expression difficult (and suffer
academically because of their
deficiency), and to the proficienT
students who need occasional
advice and support in writing
essays and term papers.
Effective skills in
self-expression have been
demonstrated to be the essence of
academic -■ success, and the#
University and the faculty have
emphasized this fact repeatedly.
The Writing Program is the only
readily available aid in this skill
and would certainly appear to be
at least as basic and essential as
most other departments. £
The University correctly has
chosen not to "weaken" programs
in favor of others.
If the University would impress
its "belt-tightening" policy on the
individual departments, a large
amount of expense could b(v
eliminated without any damage tcr
current research or education, and
the smaller new programs would
be allowed to survive.
I urge Stanford to reassess the
value of the Undergraduate
Writing Program, and also to
consider the possibility of cutting!
or at least stabilizing the budgets
of all departments, since the
effect could be minimal.

Lowered Standards £

Editor:
According to the opening
remarks of its chairman, Prof. Lee
Yearley, the Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal
Education at Stanford is reluctanL
ever to consider meaningful
options such as Sidney Hook's
proposals concerning a core
curriculum.
It is difficult to appreciate this
blinkered attitude at a time of
profound crisis, when the,
optimistic and permissive*
assumptions of our recent
academic experience have been
put into grace question by icy
realities.
"I don't think of coherence in
terms of a highly prescribed
curriculum. Pragmatically that's#
impossible. Intellectually it's not
very attractive, given the pluralism
of the times," Yearley is quoted
in the Jan. 8 Campus Report.
Brushing past the strawman
"highly prescribed" (who
suggested that?), I find
"pragmatically impossible"
startling in a religionist, both for
its centrifugality and its
disingenuousness.
Loath to cite his own tradition
to him, I prefer the example of
the Seabees. At most it is a matters
of time: the core curriculum
always returns. It is the civilized
norm. Faith, anyone?
"Intellectually attractive" to
whom? Again, I find the words
unfortunate, the sentiment more
so. As for the pluralism of the
times, another term for that
Babel. Or as Rene Girard puts, a
"festival turning bad," citing
Fellini. A certain inner
directedness at the helm (even in a
contemporary university) seems
called for as we head for the
shoals. #
It is a time for thinking things
through, not crowd-pleasing,
press-agentry and abrupt
dismissals of serious
considerations aborigine. The
Navy was handsome but Rickover
was right. -
So I put this to the
Committee: given the fact, by
now apparent even to the silliest,
that our civilization is gravely
imperilled, do you believe we
should assist it to its doom, as
some Marxists did, encouraging
Hitler whom they called "the#
locomotive of history"? Or would
you rather be counted among
those who stood tall?
