## Bookstore Woes: Empty , Empty Shelves 
### CECILE HEROLD 
It's expensive and sometimes
frustrating.
"My last four checks have been to
the Stanford Bookstore," said Amy
Tada, a junior math-science major. "In
all, I've spent $6O there this past
week." For one economics course,
Tada bought five inch-thick
paperbacks costing $25 total.
"And you ask yourself how some
books can possibly cost so much,"
Tada said, holding up a thin, innocent
text which looked more like a book of
sonnets than an Introduction to
Computer Organization. "This little
book cost $12.95," she said
incredulously.
The campus bookstore its prices,
its book selection and frequent
shortages, its early-quarter confusion
is an inescapable part of the student
life.
Last week, during winter quarter
registration and the first two days of
elasses, the bookstore handled about
14,300 customers, according to
General Manager Eldon Speed. That
count represents a number greater
than the university's entire
undergraduate population. Speed
added that the average price of a single
textbook ring-up was close to $11.50.
'Too Much'
The general student feeling is that
the price of texts is "too much. It
kills me to go buy them," moaned
freshman Frankie Oleson while
standing in the greeting cards aisle.
"And it's so different from last year
when all our books were supplied to /
my school by the state."
Larry Olson, a sophomore majoring
in electrical engineering, said, "This
quarter, at $7O, has been the most
expensive ever. Previously, my average
has been $35 or $4O, but I spent that
amount on a single history class
Modern Europe this quarter. The
course requires ten paperbacks and a
text." Olson said that the purchase of
a circuit engineering book at $l9
nearly accounted for the remainder of
his bookbill.
Jay Pollard, a junior, gave a
different student viewpoint. "I have
no compulsion about spending money
on good books," he remarked. "The
ordering of books is all a function of
the professors on campus. Professors

here, to teach better, may require
more books. As for prices, I've
shopped in a lot of bookstores, and
they're the same all over." %
Pollard's complaint, however, lay
out of the realm of the textbook
department. "The remaining selection
of goods here is mundane and boring.
The California guru books and posters
have the pragmatic appeal of mass
mediocrity. Here you find things
you'd think would rank lowest in
appealing to students," Pollard stated.
Need For Book Bargains
He admitted that the hardcover
selection of books in the store was
"good" but added, "There should be a
more studied attempt to bring in a
greater selection of high quality
paperbacks that students can afford."
Other students are concerned with
finding textbooks they can more
readily afford. "At so large a
university, why is the used book
selection so small?" asked junior Bill
Cortes, a political science major with a
current $7O bookbill this quarter.
Jim Arnold, book manager, said the
bookstore will undertake a more
rigorous program to "recruit" and
resell a larger quantity of used books.
"I would like to see the store
buying students' used books
continually throughout the quarter
instead of during a strict three-week
period at the end of each quarter,"
Arnold said.
"Rather than our buying used
books at the customer service desk,
this transaction should take place in an
area of its own that is uncongested,"
he continued.
Information, Please
Arnold explained that "the
bookstore's ability to buy used books
is dictated by information coming in
from the faculty. We cannot speculate
on which books will be used by
professors the following quarter
especially when so many titles are
subject to revision or come out as
entirely new editions."
Arnold said the bookstore now
carries more used texts than ever
before, and will offer an increased
selection in spring because "the staff
has concentrated on it."
The bookstore does not offer
student discounts on books. Arnold
explained that "the operating margin

makes it impossible."
Speed, the general manager, added
that .the bookstore used to pay a
rebate to students at the end of the
year. "Students would save all their
register receipts and receive a
percentage of the total back, maybe
10 percent. We operated like a
co-op," Speed explained. "Yoii'd
come in and shop and after it was
determined how much the bookstore
made that year, you'd receive a
portion of the profit."
No More Refunds
Speed said the policy of rebates
stopped about three or four years ago
when "the bookstore dropped into the
red. Since then, we've begun
discounting other merchandise such as
records, stationery, and supplies."
"We're not in the business to make
money," Arnold concluded. "We just
want to meet our costs as a service."
Since its foundation in 1897, the
bookstore has been a non-profit
service association now made up of 30
faculty, student and staff members
who set the policies of the store. Its

former location, relates one booklet,
was the building currently used as the
Placement Center.
"Operation was formerly one of
clerk service," the booklet continues,
"since all the books and merchandise
were behind counters. The pile-up
lines at school openings were measured
in 'blocks.' "
Pile-Ups
Students experience a phenomenal
pile-up line today, too. "The opening
days of the quarter were real back
breakers," Arnold said, "but all in all,
students realize the pressure we're
under." The 12 computer cash
registers, recently acquired at a cost of
$5OOO each, "make the lines go
faster," Speed added. "Although when
you're waiting in those lines you
wonder."
The "invisible ink" prices must be
checked beneath a highlighter by each
sales clerk. According to Arnold, this
system of highlighting prices saves
time later "so we don't have to erase
or rewrite prices and codes when
books are returned by the student and

sent back to the publisher."
The inconvenience of the crowds
and lines are a small bother compared
with the hassle of some bookstore
ordering foul-ups.
"Most of the difficulties can be
traced to simple human error," Arnold
said. "This week, a wrong title was
punched out on a computer. Once, a
professor didn't know the different
between a 'required' and
'recommended' book and the students
were burdened with an added expense
they may or may not have chosen.
Often in cases of under-ordering, class
enrollments have climbed since the
time of pre-registration 15 students
sign up and 50 show up for books."
Arnold said that most publishing
companies are swamped with new or
changed book orders resulting from
foul-ups, but Stanford has "a little
leverage because we are Stanford and
because we have so many authors on
the campus."
One such author, Economics Prof.
George Bach, wishes the bookstore
would use some leverage. The

background readings book he ordered
for his Elementary Economics class
arrived as the wrong edition.
"It's very aggravating," commented
Bach, "especially since I put a special
note on the order. And the fourth
edition has been out for over a year."
This likelihood of error seems
concentrated in an order from
Communication Prof. Don Dodson.
For the class Mass Communications
and Society, which Dodson
co-instructs with Prof. Donald
Roberts, he received a book which has
a different title, even a different
publisher from the one he ordered.
"The book itself is entirely
dissimiliar. In fact, the only common
ground between this book and the
book I requested is that it bears the
single name of one of the joint
authors," Dodson complained.
Students often wonder if professors
take expense into consideration when
selecting books to accompany their
classes. Dodson said that Roberts and
he had wanted to experiment this
quarter with texts, but that requiring
many paperbacks would have cost
more than the books previously
required.
Hardback Profits
They also considered adopting a
new third text, hoping to find it in
paperback. "But the publisher was still
making too much money from it as a
hardback," Dodson explained. ,"X&is
policy of waiting for sales to drop
before releasing a book as a paperback
hurts students and hinders flexibility
when professors wish to select new
books."
Arnold, reviewing book costs by
department, estimates that engineering
is the most expensive major on
campus.
Is there away to decrease the
bookbills, short of dropping out of
school altogether? At least one
student, says yes. Fred Bruloy, t a
second year graduate student in
mathematics, said he spent "zero
, dollars" on books this quarter,
explaining that all his courses are
continuing from the fall. Bruloy said
his book total last fall was $6O.
It seems, then, that as long as books
are essential to studies, registration
day paths from bookstore to bank
or vice-versa will remain welbwprn.

GOING, GOING, GONE—Textbook prices like so many other student expenses are on the rise, but the early quarter
rush still empties the shelves of requested books. Bookstore management blames text shortages on a lack of information
from professors. Professors cite the bookstore's clerical mistakes. In any case, these students will pay larger bookbills this

area of its own that is uncongested,"
he continued.
Information, Please
Arnold explained that "the
bookstore's ability to buy used books
is dictated by information coming in
from the faculty. We cannot speculate
on which books will be used by
professors the following quarter
especially when so many titles are
subject to revision or come out as
entirely new editions."
Arnold said the bookstore now
carries more used texts than ever
before, and will offer an increased
selection in spring because "the staff
has concentrated on it."
The bookstore does not offer
student discounts on books. Arnold
explained that "the operating margin

makes it impossible."
Speed, the general manager, added
that .the bookstore used to pay a
rebate to students at the end of the
year. "Students would save all their
register receipts and receive a
percentage of the total back, maybe
10 percent. We operated like a
co-op," Speed explained. "Yoii'd
come in and shop and after it was
determined how much the bookstore
made that year, you'd receive a
portion of the profit."
No More Refunds
Speed said the policy of rebates
stopped about three or four years ago
when "the bookstore dropped into the
red. Since then, we've begun
discounting other merchandise such as
records, stationery, and supplies."
"We're not in the business to make
money," Arnold concluded. "We just
want to meet our costs as a service."
Since its foundation in 1897, the
bookstore has been a non-profit
service association now made up of 30
faculty, student and staff members
who set the policies of the store. Its

former location, relates one booklet,
was the building currently used as the
Placement Center.
"Operation was formerly one of
clerk service," the booklet continues,
"since all the books and merchandise
were behind counters. The pile-up
lines at school openings were measured
in 'blocks.' "
Pile-Ups
Students experience a phenomenal
pile-up line today, too. "The opening
days of the quarter were real back
breakers," Arnold said, "but all in all,
students realize the pressure we're
under." The 12 computer cash
registers, recently acquired at a cost of
$5OOO each, "make the lines go
faster," Speed added. "Although when
you're waiting in those lines you
wonder."
The "invisible ink" prices must be
checked beneath a highlighter by each
sales clerk. According to Arnold, this
system of highlighting prices saves
time later "so we don't have to erase
or rewrite prices and codes when
books are returned by the student and

sent back to the publisher."
The inconvenience of the crowds
and lines are a small bother compared
with the hassle of some bookstore
ordering foul-ups.
"Most of the difficulties can be
traced to simple human error," Arnold
said. "This week, a wrong title was
punched out on a computer. Once, a
professor didn't know the different
between a 'required' and
'recommended' book and the students
were burdened with an added expense
they may or may not have chosen.
Often in cases of under-ordering, class
enrollments have climbed since the
time of pre-registration 15 students
sign up and 50 show up for books."
Arnold said that most publishing
companies are swamped with new or
changed book orders resulting from
foul-ups, but Stanford has "a little
leverage because we are Stanford and
because we have so many authors on
the campus."
One such author, Economics Prof.
George Bach, wishes the bookstore
would use some leverage. The

background readings book he ordered
for his Elementary Economics class
arrived as the wrong edition.
"It's very aggravating," commented
Bach, "especially since I put a special
note on the order. And the fourth
edition has been out for over a year."
This likelihood of error seems
concentrated in an order from
Communication Prof. Don Dodson.
For the class Mass Communications
and Society, which Dodson
co-instructs with Prof. Donald
Roberts, he received a book which has
a different title, even a different
publisher from the one he ordered.
"The book itself is entirely
dissimiliar. In fact, the only common
ground between this book and the
book I requested is that it bears the
single name of one of the joint
authors," Dodson complained.
Students often wonder if professors
take expense into consideration when
selecting books to accompany their
classes. Dodson said that Roberts and
he had wanted to experiment this
quarter with texts, but that requiring
many paperbacks would have cost
more than the books previously
required.
Hardback Profits
They also considered adopting a
new third text, hoping to find it in
paperback. "But the publisher was still
making too much money from it as a
hardback," Dodson explained. ,"X&is
policy of waiting for sales to drop
before releasing a book as a paperback
hurts students and hinders flexibility
when professors wish to select new
books."
Arnold, reviewing book costs by
department, estimates that engineering
is the most expensive major on
campus.
Is there away to decrease the
bookbills, short of dropping out of
school altogether? At least one
student, says yes. Fred Bruloy, t a
second year graduate student in
mathematics, said he spent "zero
, dollars" on books this quarter,
explaining that all his courses are
continuing from the fall. Bruloy said
his book total last fall was $6O.
It seems, then, that as long as books
are essential to studies, registration
day paths from bookstore to bank
or vice-versa will remain welbwprn.

GOING, GOING, GONE—Textbook prices like so many other student expenses are on the rise, but the early quarter
rush still empties the shelves of requested books. Bookstore management blames text shortages on a lack of information
from professors. Professors cite the bookstore's clerical mistakes. In any case, these students will pay larger bookbills this
year if their books are in stock.
It's expensive and sometimes
frustrating.
"My last four checks have been to
the Stanford Bookstore," said Amy
Tada, a junior math-science major. "In
all, I've spent $6O there this past
week." For one economics course,
Tada bought five inch-thick
paperbacks costing $25 total.
"And you ask yourself how some
books can possibly cost so much,"
Tada said, holding up a thin, innocent
text which looked more like a book of
sonnets than an Introduction to
Computer Organization. "This little
book cost $12.95," she said
incredulously.
The campus bookstore its prices,
its book selection and frequent
shortages, its early-quarter confusion
is an inescapable part of the student
life.
Last week, during winter quarter
registration and the first two days of
elasses, the bookstore handled about
14,300 customers, according to
General Manager Eldon Speed. That
count represents a number greater
than the university's entire
undergraduate population. Speed
added that the average price of a single
textbook ring-up was close to $11.50.
'Too Much'
The general student feeling is that
the price of texts is "too much. It
kills me to go buy them," moaned
freshman Frankie Oleson while
standing in the greeting cards aisle.
"And it's so different from last year
when all our books were supplied to /
my school by the state."
Larry Olson, a sophomore majoring
in electrical engineering, said, "This
quarter, at $7O, has been the most
expensive ever. Previously, my average
has been $35 or $4O, but I spent that
amount on a single history class
Modern Europe this quarter. The
course requires ten paperbacks and a
text." Olson said that the purchase of
a circuit engineering book at $l9
nearly accounted for the remainder of
his bookbill.
Jay Pollard, a junior, gave a
different student viewpoint. "I have
no compulsion about spending money
on good books," he remarked. "The
ordering of books is all a function of
the professors on campus. Professors

here, to teach better, may require
more books. As for prices, I've
shopped in a lot of bookstores, and
they're the same all over." %
Pollard's complaint, however, lay
out of the realm of the textbook
department. "The remaining selection
of goods here is mundane and boring.
The California guru books and posters
have the pragmatic appeal of mass
mediocrity. Here you find things
you'd think would rank lowest in
appealing to students," Pollard stated.
Need For Book Bargains
He admitted that the hardcover
selection of books in the store was
"good" but added, "There should be a
more studied attempt to bring in a
greater selection of high quality
paperbacks that students can afford."
Other students are concerned with
finding textbooks they can more
readily afford. "At so large a
university, why is the used book
selection so small?" asked junior Bill
Cortes, a political science major with a
current $7O bookbill this quarter.
Jim Arnold, book manager, said the
bookstore will undertake a more
rigorous program to "recruit" and
resell a larger quantity of used books.
"I would like to see the store
buying students' used books
continually throughout the quarter
instead of during a strict three-week
period at the end of each quarter,"
Arnold said.
"Rather than our buying used
books at the customer service desk,
this transaction should take place in an
area of its own that is uncongested,"
he continued.

Arnold explained that "the
bookstore's ability to buy used books

George Bach, wishes the bookstore
would use some leverage. The

background readings book he ordered
for his Elementary Economics class
arrived as the wrong edition.
"It's very aggravating," commented
Bach, "especially since I put a special
note on the order. And the fourth
edition has been out for over a year."
This likelihood of error seems
concentrated in an order from
Communication Prof. Don Dodson.
For the class Mass Communications
and Society, which Dodson
co-instructs with Prof. Donald
Roberts, he received a book which has
a different title, even a different
publisher from the one he ordered.
"The book itself is entirely
dissimiliar. In fact, the only common
ground between this book and the
book I requested is that it bears the
single name of one of the joint
authors," Dodson complained.
Students often wonder if professors
take expense into consideration when
selecting books to accompany their
classes. Dodson said that Roberts and
he had wanted to experiment this
quarter with texts, but that requiring
many paperbacks would have cost
more than the books previously
required.
Hardback Profits
They also considered adopting a
new third text, hoping to find it in
paperback. "But the publisher was still
making too much money from it as a
hardback," Dodson explained. ,"X&is
policy of waiting for sales to drop
before releasing a book as a paperback
hurts students and hinders flexibility
when professors wish to select new
books."
Arnold, reviewing book costs by
department, estimates that engineering
is the most expensive major on
campus.
Is there away to decrease the
bookbills, short of dropping out of
school altogether? At least one
student, says yes. Fred Bruloy, t a
second year graduate student in
mathematics, said he spent "zero
, dollars" on books this quarter,
explaining that all his courses are
continuing from the fall. Bruloy said
his book total last fall was $6O.
It seems, then, that as long as books
are essential to studies, registration
day paths from bookstore to bank
or vice-versa will remain welbwprn.

GOING, GOING, GONE—Textbook prices like so many other student expenses are on the rise, but the early quarter
rush still empties the shelves of requested books. Bookstore management blames text shortages on a lack of information
from professors. Professors cite the bookstore's clerical mistakes. In any case, these students will pay larger bookbills this
year if their books are in stock.
It's expensive and sometimes
frustrating.
"My last four checks have been to
the Stanford Bookstore," said Amy
Tada, a junior math-science major. "In
all, I've spent $6O there this past
week." For one economics course,
Tada bought five inch-thick
paperbacks costing $25 total.
"And you ask yourself how some
books can possibly cost so much,"
Tada said, holding up a thin, innocent
text which looked more like a book of
sonnets than an Introduction to
Computer Organization. "This little
book cost $12.95," she said
incredulously.
The campus bookstore its prices,
its book selection and frequent
shortages, its early-quarter confusion
is an inescapable part of the student
life.
Last week, during winter quarter
registration and the first two days of
elasses, the bookstore handled about
14,300 customers, according to
General Manager Eldon Speed. That
count represents a number greater
than the university's entire
undergraduate population. Speed
added that the average price of a single
textbook ring-up was close to $11.50.
'Too Much'
The general student feeling is that
the price of texts is "too much. It
kills me to go buy them," moaned
freshman Frankie Oleson while
standing in the greeting cards aisle.
"And it's so different from last year
when all our books were supplied to /
my school by the state."
Larry Olson, a sophomore majoring
in electrical engineering, said, "This
quarter, at $7O, has been the most
expensive ever. Previously, my average
has been $35 or $4O, but I spent that
amount on a single history class
Modern Europe this quarter. The
course requires ten paperbacks and a
text." Olson said that the purchase of
a circuit engineering book at $l9
nearly accounted for the remainder of
his bookbill.
Jay Pollard, a junior, gave a
different student viewpoint. "I have
no compulsion about spending money
on good books," he remarked. "The
ordering of books is all a function of
the professors on campus. Professors

here, to teach better, may require
more books. As for prices, I've
shopped in a lot of bookstores, and
they're the same all over." %
Pollard's complaint, however, lay
out of the realm of the textbook
department. "The remaining selection
of goods here is mundane and boring.
The California guru books and posters
have the pragmatic appeal of mass
mediocrity. Here you find things
you'd think would rank lowest in
appealing to students," Pollard stated.
Need For Book Bargains
He admitted that the hardcover
selection of books in the store was
"good" but added, "There should be a
more studied attempt to bring in a
greater selection of high quality
paperbacks that students can afford."
Other students are concerned with
finding textbooks they can more
readily afford. "At so large a
university, why is the used book
selection so small?" asked junior Bill
Cortes, a political science major with a
current $7O bookbill this quarter.
Jim Arnold, book manager, said the
bookstore will undertake a more
rigorous program to "recruit" and
resell a larger quantity of used books.
"I would like to see the store
buying students' used books
continually throughout the quarter
instead of during a strict three-week
period at the end of each quarter,"
Arnold said.
"Rather than our buying used
books at the customer service desk,
this transaction should take place in an
area of its own that is uncongested,"
he continued.
Information, Please
Arnold explained that "the
bookstore's ability to buy used books
is dictated by information coming in
from the faculty. We cannot speculate
on which books will be used by
professors the following quarter
especially when so many titles are
subject to revision or come out as
entirely new editions."
Arnold said the bookstore now
carries more used texts than ever
before, and will offer an increased
selection in spring because "the staff
has concentrated on it."
The bookstore does not offer
student discounts on books. Arnold
explained that "the operating margin

makes it impossible."
Speed, the general manager, added
that .the bookstore used to pay a
rebate to students at the end of the
year. "Students would save all their
register receipts and receive a
percentage of the total back, maybe
10 percent. We operated like a
co-op," Speed explained. "Yoii'd
come in and shop and after it was
determined how much the bookstore
made that year, you'd receive a
portion of the profit."
No More Refunds
Speed said the policy of rebates
stopped about three or four years ago
when "the bookstore dropped into the
red. Since then, we've begun
discounting other merchandise such as
records, stationery, and supplies."
"We're not in the business to make
money," Arnold concluded. "We just
want to meet our costs as a service."
Since its foundation in 1897, the
bookstore has been a non-profit
service association now made up of 30
faculty, student and staff members
who set the policies of the store. Its

former location, relates one booklet,
was the building currently used as the
Placement Center.
"Operation was formerly one of
clerk service," the booklet continues,
"since all the books and merchandise
were behind counters. The pile-up
lines at school openings were measured
in 'blocks.' "
Pile-Ups
Students experience a phenomenal
pile-up line today, too. "The opening
days of the quarter were real back
breakers," Arnold said, "but all in all,
students realize the pressure we're
under." The 12 computer cash
registers, recently acquired at a cost of
$5OOO each, "make the lines go
faster," Speed added. "Although when
you're waiting in those lines you
wonder."
The "invisible ink" prices must be
checked beneath a highlighter by each
sales clerk. According to Arnold, this
system of highlighting prices saves
time later "so we don't have to erase
or rewrite prices and codes when
books are returned by the student and

sent back to the publisher."
The inconvenience of the crowds
and lines are a small bother compared
with the hassle of some bookstore
ordering foul-ups.
"Most of the difficulties can be
traced to simple human error," Arnold
said. "This week, a wrong title was
punched out on a computer. Once, a
professor didn't know the different
between a 'required' and
'recommended' book and the students
were burdened with an added expense
they may or may not have chosen.
Often in cases of under-ordering, class
enrollments have climbed since the
time of pre-registration 15 students
sign up and 50 show up for books."
Arnold said that most publishing
companies are swamped with new or
changed book orders resulting from
foul-ups, but Stanford has "a little
leverage because we are Stanford and
because we have so many authors on
the campus."
One such author, Economics Prof.
George Bach, wishes the bookstore
would use some leverage. The

background readings book he ordered
for his Elementary Economics class
arrived as the wrong edition.
"It's very aggravating," commented
Bach, "especially since I put a special

The general student feeling is that
the price of texts is "too much. It
kills me to go buy them," moaned
freshman Frankie Oleson while
standing in the greeting cards aisle.
"And it's so different from last year
when all our books were supplied to /
my school by the state."
Larry Olson, a sophomore majoring
in electrical engineering, said, "This
quarter, at $7O, has been the most
expensive ever. Previously, my average
has been $35 or $4O, but I spent that
amount on a single history class
Modern Europe this quarter. The
course requires ten paperbacks and a
text." Olson said that the purchase of
a circuit engineering book at $l9
nearly accounted for the remainder of
his bookbill.
Jay Pollard, a junior, gave a
different student viewpoint. "I have
no compulsion about spending money
on good books," he remarked. "The
ordering of books is all a function of
the professors on campus. Professors

here, to teach better, may require
more books. As for prices, I've
shopped in a lot of bookstores, and
they're the same all over." %
Pollard's complaint, however, lay
out of the realm of the textbook
department. "The remaining selection
of goods here is mundane and boring.
The California guru books and posters
have the pragmatic appeal of mass
mediocrity. Here you find things
you'd think would rank lowest in
appealing to students," Pollard stated.
Need For Book Bargains
He admitted that the hardcover
selection of books in the store was
"good" but added, "There should be a
more studied attempt to bring in a
greater selection of high quality
paperbacks that students can afford."
Other students are concerned with
finding textbooks they can more
readily afford. "At so large a
university, why is the used book
selection so small?" asked junior Bill
Cortes, a political science major with a
current $7O bookbill this quarter.
Jim Arnold, book manager, said the
bookstore will undertake a more
rigorous program to "recruit" and
resell a larger quantity of used books.
"I would like to see the store
buying students' used books
continually throughout the quarter
instead of during a strict three-week
period at the end of each quarter,"
Arnold said.
"Rather than our buying used
books at the customer service desk,
this transaction should take place in an
area of its own that is uncongested,"
he continued.
Information, Please
Arnold explained that "the
bookstore's ability to buy used books
is dictated by information coming in
from the faculty. We cannot speculate
on which books will be used by
professors the following quarter
especially when so many titles are
subject to revision or come out as
entirely new editions."
Arnold said the bookstore now
carries more used texts than ever
before, and will offer an increased
selection in spring because "the staff
has concentrated on it."
The bookstore does not offer
student discounts on books. Arnold
explained that "the operating margin

makes it impossible."
Speed, the general manager, added
that .the bookstore used to pay a
rebate to students at the end of the
year. "Students would save all their
register receipts and receive a
percentage of the total back, maybe
10 percent. We operated like a
co-op," Speed explained. "Yoii'd
come in and shop and after it was
determined how much the bookstore
made that year, you'd receive a
portion of the profit."
No More Refunds
Speed said the policy of rebates
stopped about three or four years ago
when "the bookstore dropped into the
red. Since then, we've begun
discounting other merchandise such as
records, stationery, and supplies."
"We're not in the business to make
money," Arnold concluded. "We just
want to meet our costs as a service."
Since its foundation in 1897, the
bookstore has been a non-profit
service association now made up of 30
faculty, student and staff members
who set the policies of the store. Its

former location, relates one booklet,
was the building currently used as the
Placement Center.
"Operation was formerly one of
clerk service," the booklet continues,
"since all the books and merchandise
were behind counters. The pile-up
lines at school openings were measured
in 'blocks.' "
Pile-Ups
Students experience a phenomenal
pile-up line today, too. "The opening
days of the quarter were real back
breakers," Arnold said, "but all in all,
students realize the pressure we're
under." The 12 computer cash
registers, recently acquired at a cost of
$5OOO each, "make the lines go
faster," Speed added. "Although when
you're waiting in those lines you
wonder."
The "invisible ink" prices must be
checked beneath a highlighter by each
sales clerk. According to Arnold, this
system of highlighting prices saves
time later "so we don't have to erase
or rewrite prices and codes when
books are returned by the student and

sent back to the publisher."
The inconvenience of the crowds
and lines are a small bother compared
with the hassle of some bookstore
ordering foul-ups.
"Most of the difficulties can be
traced to simple human error," Arnold
said. "This week, a wrong title was
punched out on a computer. Once, a
professor didn't know the different
between a 'required' and
'recommended' book and the students
were burdened with an added expense
they may or may not have chosen.
Often in cases of under-ordering, class
enrollments have climbed since the
time of pre-registration 15 students
sign up and 50 show up for books."
Arnold said that most publishing
companies are swamped with new or
changed book orders resulting from
foul-ups, but Stanford has "a little
leverage because we are Stanford and
because we have so many authors on
the campus."
One such author, Economics Prof.
George Bach, wishes the bookstore
would use some leverage. The

background readings book he ordered
for his Elementary Economics class
arrived as the wrong edition.
"It's very aggravating," commented
Bach, "especially since I put a special
note on the order. And the fourth
edition has been out for over a year."
This likelihood of error seems
concentrated in an order from
Communication Prof. Don Dodson.
For the class Mass Communications
and Society, which Dodson
co-instructs with Prof. Donald
Roberts, he received a book which has
a different title, even a different
publisher from the one he ordered.
"The book itself is entirely
dissimiliar. In fact, the only common
ground between this book and the
book I requested is that it bears the
single name of one of the joint
authors," Dodson complained.
Students often wonder if professors
take expense into consideration when
selecting books to accompany their
classes. Dodson said that Roberts and
he had wanted to experiment this
quarter with texts, but that requiring
many paperbacks would have cost
more than the books previously
required.
Hardback Profits
They also considered adopting a
new third text, hoping to find it in
paperback. "But the publisher was still
making too much money from it as a
hardback," Dodson explained. ,"X&is
policy of waiting for sales to drop
before releasing a book as a paperback
hurts students and hinders flexibility
when professors wish to select new
books."
Arnold, reviewing book costs by
department, estimates that engineering
is the most expensive major on
campus.
Is there away to decrease the
bookbills, short of dropping out of
school altogether? At least one
student, says yes. Fred Bruloy, t a
second year graduate student in
mathematics, said he spent "zero
, dollars" on books this quarter,
explaining that all his courses are
continuing from the fall. Bruloy said
his book total last fall was $6O.
It seems, then, that as long as books
are essential to studies, registration
day paths from bookstore to bank
or vice-versa will remain welbwprn.

GOING, GOING, GONE—Textbook prices like so many other student expenses are on the rise, but the early quarter
rush still empties the shelves of requested books. Bookstore management blames text shortages on a lack of information
from professors. Professors cite the bookstore's clerical mistakes. In any case, these students will pay larger bookbills this
year if their books are in stock.
It's expensive and sometimes
frustrating.
"My last four checks have been to
the Stanford Bookstore," said Amy
Tada, a junior math-science major. "In
all, I've spent $6O there this past
week." For one economics course,
Tada bought five inch-thick
paperbacks costing $25 total.
"And you ask yourself how some
books can possibly cost so much,"
Tada said, holding up a thin, innocent
text which looked more like a book of
sonnets than an Introduction to
Computer Organization. "This little
book cost $12.95," she said
incredulously.
The campus bookstore its prices,
its book selection and frequent
shortages, its early-quarter confusion
is an inescapable part of the student
life.
Last week, during winter quarter
registration and the first two days of
elasses, the bookstore handled about
14,300 customers, according to
General Manager Eldon Speed. That
count represents a number greater
than the university's entire
undergraduate population. Speed
added that the average price of a single
textbook ring-up was close to $11.50.

when "the bookstore dropped into the
red. Since then, we've begun
discounting other merchandise such as
records, stationery, and supplies."
"We're not in the business to make
money," Arnold concluded. "We just
want to meet our costs as a service."
Since its foundation in 1897, the
bookstore has been a non-profit
service association now made up of 30
faculty, student and staff members
who set the policies of the store. Its

former location, relates one booklet,
was the building currently used as the
Placement Center.
"Operation was formerly one of
clerk service," the booklet continues,
"since all the books and merchandise
were behind counters. The pile-up
lines at school openings were measured
in 'blocks.' "
Pile-Ups
Students experience a phenomenal
pile-up line today, too. "The opening
days of the quarter were real back
breakers," Arnold said, "but all in all,
students realize the pressure we're
under." The 12 computer cash
registers, recently acquired at a cost of
$5OOO each, "make the lines go
faster," Speed added. "Although when
you're waiting in those lines you
wonder."
The "invisible ink" prices must be
checked beneath a highlighter by each
sales clerk. According to Arnold, this
system of highlighting prices saves
time later "so we don't have to erase
or rewrite prices and codes when
books are returned by the student and

sent back to the publisher."
The inconvenience of the crowds
and lines are a small bother compared
with the hassle of some bookstore
ordering foul-ups.
"Most of the difficulties can be
traced to simple human error," Arnold
said. "This week, a wrong title was
punched out on a computer. Once, a
professor didn't know the different
between a 'required' and
'recommended' book and the students
were burdened with an added expense
they may or may not have chosen.
Often in cases of under-ordering, class
enrollments have climbed since the
time of pre-registration 15 students
sign up and 50 show up for books."
Arnold said that most publishing
companies are swamped with new or
changed book orders resulting from
foul-ups, but Stanford has "a little
leverage because we are Stanford and
because we have so many authors on
the campus."
One such author, Economics Prof.
George Bach, wishes the bookstore
would use some leverage. The

background readings book he ordered
for his Elementary Economics class
arrived as the wrong edition.
"It's very aggravating," commented
Bach, "especially since I put a special
note on the order. And the fourth
edition has been out for over a year."
This likelihood of error seems
concentrated in an order from
Communication Prof. Don Dodson.
For the class Mass Communications
and Society, which Dodson
co-instructs with Prof. Donald
Roberts, he received a book which has
a different title, even a different
publisher from the one he ordered.
"The book itself is entirely
dissimiliar. In fact, the only common
ground between this book and the
book I requested is that it bears the
single name of one of the joint
authors," Dodson complained.
Students often wonder if professors
take expense into consideration when
selecting books to accompany their
classes. Dodson said that Roberts and
he had wanted to experiment this
quarter with texts, but that requiring
many paperbacks would have cost
more than the books previously
required.
Hardback Profits
They also considered adopting a
new third text, hoping to find it in
paperback. "But the publisher was still
making too much money from it as a
hardback," Dodson explained. ,"X&is
policy of waiting for sales to drop
before releasing a book as a paperback
hurts students and hinders flexibility
when professors wish to select new
books."
Arnold, reviewing book costs by
department, estimates that engineering
is the most expensive major on
campus.
Is there away to decrease the
bookbills, short of dropping out of
school altogether? At least one
student, says yes. Fred Bruloy, t a
second year graduate student in
mathematics, said he spent "zero
, dollars" on books this quarter,
explaining that all his courses are
continuing from the fall. Bruloy said
his book total last fall was $6O.
It seems, then, that as long as books
are essential to studies, registration
day paths from bookstore to bank
or vice-versa will remain welbwprn.

GOING, GOING, GONE—Textbook prices like so many other student expenses are on the rise, but the early quarter
rush still empties the shelves of requested books. Bookstore management blames text shortages on a lack of information
from professors. Professors cite the bookstore's clerical mistakes. In any case, these students will pay larger bookbills this
year if their books are in stock.
