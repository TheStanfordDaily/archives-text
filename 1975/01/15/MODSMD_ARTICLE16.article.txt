The University has requested
bids on the projects from both

companies: TDS, ARA Slater and
SAGA.

requested separate bids for the
entire University food service
from the companies.

requested bids from nine food
service companies for a "total
package," including both the food
services and the pub. No
companies returned an acceptable
package, according to Starr.
Williams also refused to make a
prediction on when small clothes
shops or other businesses might be
added to Tresidder possibilities
Starr has mentioned in the past.

added to Tresidder possibilities
Starr has mentioned in the past.
Assoc. Dean of Students Dan
Williams announced in a letter to
Tresidder employees yesterday a
number of organizational changes
in Tresidder Memorial Union
(TMU).
In the letter, Williams the new
TMU director, formalized his
previous declaration that former
TMU General Manager Gordon
Starr will not be replaced. Instead,
Williams said he will assume
"direct responsibility for the
management of Tresidder, in
addition to my other duties .. .
' 'Because of Gordon's
successful implementation of
many important procedures and
policies these past two years,"

Williams' letter stated, "and in
recognition of the overall financial
difficulties in the University, I
have decided not to fill the
position of General Manager."
Starr Resignation
Williams' letter came two
weeks after Starr's resignation
became effective. Starr resigned to
take a position with EST, a
personal growth center in San
Francisco.
Williams also delegated some of
Starr's previous responsibilities.
Tresidder Store manager Gary
Ding wijl be "responsible with the
continued assistance of [Tresidder
official] John Buckmaster for the
Bowling Center," Williams said.
Diane Conklin, assistant to the

TMU director, will oversee all
office management problems. She
will also be in charge of Tresidder
advertising and "personnel
matters," according to Williams.
Asst. Dean of Students Alan
Strain will "be the primary
coordinator of the daily business
involving the student activities
and student organizations
component of the organization,
which you know as Campus
Affairs."
Ding will also be in charge of
implementing any special TMU
projects, "the first of which will
be the inclusion of an ice cream
shop in the Union," Williams said.
Ice Cream?
Williams said, "I'm hoping we
can get an ice cream franchise into
the Union as early as spring
quarter."
The University has requested
bids on the projects from both
Swehsen's and Baskin-Robbins.
In addition, Conklin currently

is directing a "rough" survey of
100 people: 75 students and 25
University staff to find out
whether there is a demand for an
ice cream parlor on campus.
No Pub Prediction
Williams refused to make a
prediction on when a pub serving
beer and wine might open on
campus, saying the University has
requested separate bids on the
project from three food service
companies: TDS, ARA Slater and
SAGA.
The University has also
requested separate bids for the
entire University food service
from the companies.
Originally, the University
requested bids from nine food
service companies for a "total
package," including both the food
services and the pub. No
companies returned an acceptable
package, according to Starr.
Williams also refused to make a
prediction on when small clothes
shops or other businesses might be
added to Tresidder possibilities
Starr has mentioned in the past.
