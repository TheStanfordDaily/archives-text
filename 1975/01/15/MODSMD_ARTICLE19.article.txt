## Pro Prognosis Billie Makes Way For Real Queen 
### Glenn Garvin 
Bye bye Billie Jean. The bellicose tennis
bum who became leader of the jock wing of
women's lib despite the fact that she
endorsed hair dryers says she'll retire after
this weekend's Virginia Slims tournament in
Florida.
She's about a year too late, and that's a
charitable estimate. Chris Evert is the greatest
woman tennis player in the world, and Billie
Jean dejectedly conceded defeat Saturday
after Chris demolished her 6-1, 6-1 in the
Slims finals in San Francisco.
"Chris beat my bazongas off," admitted King
(or Ms. Superstar, as she's known to some of
the more hysterical San Francisco sports
writers). Truer words never spoken. Chris was
in complete control from the opening serve,
and her play should silence forever the few
crazed libbers who disputed her top ranking.
How on earth anyone could have believed
otherwise is a subject of almost occult
dimensions. Consider the awesome array of'
statistics Chris produced last year: a 53-5
record, 56 consecutive victories, 10
consecutive tournament wins and the top
money winnings of all time by a female
tennis player. Perhaps most amazing is the
fact that she lost only 16 sets all year while
winning 104.
"I'm getting too old for this," King
apologized after Chris took her apart. Since
she's only 31, it's hard to take that very
seriously. What Billie Jean means is that she
just isn't that good.
Scruffy Fans
Billie Jean's departure must inspire mixed
feelings. No one will miss her fans, a scruffy
group who like to prove their independence

by screaming when opposition players try to
serve. San Francisco is Billie Jean's personal
stomping ground, and her wolves were out in
force when she played Chris Saturday,
howling and booing even some of the obvious
line calls.
On the other hand, it was so glorious tp
listen to the anguished screeches from the
libbies when she lost to someone like Chris
Evert. How could one as right on as Billie
Jean lose to a girl who actually has been
known to speak in favor of marriage and
children?
It horrified them; many lost touch with
reality every time Billie Jean lost, and
returned to earth only when she returned to
form and trounced Julie Heldman or Tory
Fretz.
Chris Evert's number one ranking, painful
as it has been to King's minions, was overdue.
She has long been unfairly maligned in
women's tennis simply because she doesn't
go into a frothing rage at the mention of
marriage. "Little Chrissie" is a cue for gales
of derisive laughter among female tennis fans.
Unliberated
Would you like a sample of what it is
Chris says inspires these hyena-like fits of
giggles? "This is great playing in all these
tournaments, going all over the world and
getting all the money I want, but I don't
know, you feel empty with only one thing,"
she said recently. How outrageous. Chris
Evert says there's more to life than playing
tennis. How unliberated can you get?
Actually Billie Jean said much the same
thing recently. "I want to be more than just a

tennis player," she explained to newsmen
when she announced her retirement to join
ABC Sports. So Chris Evert's idea of fulfillment
is to have children. Billie Jean King's is to sit
in a booth with Howard Cosell. Whose values
are sick?
But it doesn't really matter. Billie Jean's
libbers will simply have to get used to Chris,
because she's going to be around an awfully
long time. Her performance Saturday night
was typical. She rarely makes the spectacular
play, but simply keeps on returning every
shot from the baseline until her opponent
makes a dumb mistake.
She Still Wins
Some observers have called
her machine-like which is not a bad way to
describe her play, although she's certainly
not perfect. Her overhead shot is nothing to
write home about, and many of her lobs
come rocketing back in her face. It's an
impressive tribute to her that everybody
knows those weaknesses, and they still can't
beat her.
Others have called her boring, and
suggested she imitate more spectacular (and
less successful) players like Virginia Wade and
Rosie Casals. This borders on the imbecilic:
the best strategy is the one that wins, and
Chris has proven her style wins.
So accept it: homebody Chris Evert is
number one. In fairness, it should be
mentioned that Evert is not entirely satisfied
with her public image. No one ever calls her
sexy, she once complained to Time magazine.
All right. You read it here first. This is a
salute to Chris Evert, the sexy new queen of
women's tennis.
