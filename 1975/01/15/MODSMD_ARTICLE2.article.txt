# Lyman Calls 'Drop' Policy Economical
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
President Richard Lyman last night
expressed approval for a proposal to
reinstate an earlier"drop"deadline for
classes, claiming that it would cut
costs while helping to solve the
dilemma of grade inflation.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference , Lyman tentatively
endorsed the recommendation for an
earlier deadline made by the Faculty
Senate's Ad Hoc Panel to Study the
Grading System.
"We can't afford the luxury of
allowing students to take a course
until the eve of an examination and
then drop it like a hot potato," Lyman
said. "The system needs revision if
only for budget reasons." v
Lyman explained that the
administrative costs involved in last
minute drops, together with the
uncertainty it throws into allocation
of staff time, make the last minute
drop deadline a costly system.
Lyman added that the earlier
deadline might also help to lower the
undergraduate's average letter grade,
which is currently 3.4.
"Under the present system,
superior performance is
disadvantaged," Lyman stated. "If
everyone has an A, then no one has an
A."
Lyman discussed the Office of
Undergraduate Studies' recent
recommendation to terminate
SWOPSI, SCIRE and the Directed
Writing Program.
Noting that the annual budget for
these programs is relatively small
only $lOB,OOO Lyman said that
even such small cuts help the
University solve its financial problems.
General Cost Cuts
"We can't concentrate ... on big
savings any more than we can
concentrate entirely on small savings,"
Lyman declared. "We must cut costs
up and down the scale."
Lyman acknowledged that many
people will defend SWOPSI in the
weeks ahead and commented on the
difficulties involved in "calibrating
benefits and savings."
When asked why SWOPSI couldn't
retain its current structure at a
reduced budget rather than having
segments of it filtered through existing
departments as is planned, Lyman
cited the need to cut staff costs.
"The departments will have to do a
lot of hard thinking," Lyman
observed. •
Since most SWOPSI expenses
involve staffing, Lyman said that many
of its elements could be funded more
cheaply within the regular
departments.
Lyman said that it is too early to
predict whether or not financially £
hard-pressed department chairmen will
find the funds to incorporate
SWOPSI-SCIRE-style courses into
their departments.
