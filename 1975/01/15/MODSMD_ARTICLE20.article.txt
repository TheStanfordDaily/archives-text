## Ruetz Justifies Cutback Leak 
### MARK FUNK 
Stanford Athletic Director
Joseph H. Ruetz responded
yesterday to allegations that
information concerning proposed
cutbacks in the intercollegiate
wrestling and gymnastics
programs was broken prematurely
at the mid-December meetings of
the Pacific Eight Conference in
San Francisco.
Gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada and wrestling mentor Joe
DeMeo, who levelled the charges
last week, claim they were
informed that the athletic
department was considering
dropping their sports through
official channels only after they
had heard rumors of the cuts from
other sources.
Specifically, Hamada and
DeMeo had been told by
other Pac-8 coaches, whose
athletic directors all attended the
San Francisco meetings, and a
number of athletes whom those
coaches were attempting to
recruit, that word of the proposed
cuts was out as early as Dec. 23.
That was fully 18 days before
official notification by Ruetz in a
Jan. 10 meeting.
Both say the rumors damaged
their recruiting.
Ruetz acknowledged that he

had told the other athletic
directors that some cuts in
Stanford's athletic program might
be forthcoming. "Of course I
talked about it," he said, "but my
statements were confidential."
Apparently, a number of
Ruetz's colleagues violated that
confidentiality. "You know how
that can go, though," Ruetz said.
Ruetz said that it was
necessary to inform the other
athletic directors of the possible
cuts so they could weigh its
effects on scheduling and travel at
their schools.
"We were engaged in the
possibility that we might have to
make some changes in our
[Stanford's] athletic program,"
he pointed out. "It was kind of
out of courtesy that they were
told."
Asked if a decision on the
status of wrestling and gymnastics
was imminent, Ruetz said maybe.
The Committee on Athletics,
Physical Education and
Recreation (CAPER) will meet
tonight at 7:30 to review
recommendations to drop the
sports. Jack H. Friedenthal,
chairman of the committee, said
the possibility of the group
reaching a decision on the
controversy was slim, but.he did

not rule it out.
"I favor retaining the two
sports if at all possible," Ruetz said.
"During the late fall and winter,
however, we need more indoor
space for sports such as volleyball,
women's basketball and an
expanding intramural program."
A number of wrestlers have
been in to talk to Ruetz and
present their case for retaining the
sport. Ruetz said he expected
to see representatives from the
gymnastics team shortly.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
wrestling team, sporting the best
win-loss record in the school's
history and fresh off a successful
road trip to Southern California,
returns to Maples Pavilion tonight
at 7:30 p.m., to face its stiffest
challenge of the year against
highly regarded Oregon.
The Ducks, currently ranked
sixth in the nation, are undefeated
and odds-on favorite to win the
Pac-8 wrestling title. They boast
Ail-American Dwain Stutzman at
167 and potential All-Americans
at four other spots.
The Cards will counter with
Chris Horpel at 150. Horpel,
another All-American, pinned all
three opponents he wrestled down
south to lead Stanford to wins
over Claremont-Mudd and Los
Angeles State. The Cards lost only
to UCLA. . 4
DeMeo also announced today
that the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University band
would be on hand for the match
and that free popcorn would be
given away to all spectators.

Stanford Athletic Director
Joseph H. Ruetz responded
yesterday to allegations that
information concerning proposed
cutbacks in the intercollegiate
wrestling and gymnastics
programs was broken prematurely
at the mid-December meetings of
the Pacific Eight Conference in
San Francisco.
Gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada and wrestling mentor Joe
DeMeo, who levelled the charges
last week, claim they were
informed that the athletic
department was considering
dropping their sports through
official channels only after they
had heard rumors of the cuts from
other sources.
Specifically, Hamada and
DeMeo had been told by
other Pac-8 coaches, whose
athletic directors all attended the
San Francisco meetings, and a
number of athletes whom those
coaches were attempting to
recruit, that word of the proposed
cuts was out as early as Dec. 23.
That was fully 18 days before
official notification by Ruetz in a
Jan. 10 meeting.
Both say the rumors damaged
their recruiting.
Ruetz acknowledged that he

had told the other athletic
directors that some cuts in
Stanford's athletic program might
be forthcoming. "Of course I
talked about it," he said, "but my
statements were confidential."
Apparently, a number of
Ruetz's colleagues violated that
confidentiality. "You know how
that can go, though," Ruetz said.
Ruetz said that it was
necessary to inform the other
athletic directors of the possible
cuts so they could weigh its
effects on scheduling and travel at
their schools.
"We were engaged in the
possibility that we might have to
make some changes in our
[Stanford's] athletic program,"
he pointed out. "It was kind of
out of courtesy that they were
told."
Asked if a decision on the
status of wrestling and gymnastics
was imminent, Ruetz said maybe.
The Committee on Athletics,
Physical Education and
Recreation (CAPER) will meet
tonight at 7:30 to review
recommendations to drop the
sports. Jack H. Friedenthal,
chairman of the committee, said
the possibility of the group
reaching a decision on the
controversy was slim, but.he did

not rule it out.
"I favor retaining the two
sports if at all possible," Ruetz said.
"During the late fall and winter,
however, we need more indoor
space for sports such as volleyball,
women's basketball and an
expanding intramural program."
A number of wrestlers have
been in to talk to Ruetz and
present their case for retaining the
sport. Ruetz said he expected
to see representatives from the
gymnastics team shortly.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
wrestling team, sporting the best
win-loss record in the school's
history and fresh off a successful
road trip to Southern California,
returns to Maples Pavilion tonight
at 7:30 p.m., to face its stiffest
challenge of the year against
highly regarded Oregon.
The Ducks, currently ranked
sixth in the nation, are undefeated
and odds-on favorite to win the
Pac-8 wrestling title. They boast
Ail-American Dwain Stutzman at
167 and potential All-Americans
