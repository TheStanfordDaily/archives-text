Soviets Renounce Trade Pact
WASHINGTON The Soviet Union has
renounced its 1972 trade agreement with the United
States an,d nullified an apparent understanding to
step up Jewish emigration, Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger said last night.
In a far-reaching series of actions, President Ford
has decided he is now unable to grant the Soviets
nondiscriminatory tariff treatment under the new
Trade Reform Act, Kissinger said.
The break-up of a carefully nurtured commercial
agreement could have a major impact on
U.S.—Soviet relations, although Kissinger said "all
the communications we have received from the
Soviet government seem to suggest that the political
orientation is unchanged."
Kissinger said in a statement that Moscow views
provisions in the new trade act as interference in
Soviet domestic affairs.
"The administration regrets this turn of events,"
said Kissinger, whose detente policy has dominated
foreign affairs for several years.
He said the administration "has regarded and
continues to regard an orderly and mutually
beneficial trade relationship with the Soviet Union
as in important element in the over-all improvement
of relations."
Ford Proposes More Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON President Ford, already
seeking a one-shot $l6 billion tax reduction to
counter the recession, let it be known yesterday he
will ask Congress for $22.5 billion in additional
permanent tax cuts.
And, administration sources said the President
also plans to seek postponement of clean air
standards for power plants to help them convert
quickly from oil-burning to coal-burning boilers.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said the proposed
$2-a-barref tax on crude oil and taxes on windfall
profits of oil companies would add some $3O billion
to federal revenues. This money, he said, would
offset the income lost because of the tax reductions.
Ford will spell out his entire energy policy
package in his broadcast State of the Union address
to Congress this morning.
Although Ford himself and Nessen disclosed
much of the program in advance, the press secretary
promised there will be other surprises in the Capitol
Hill speech.

Oil Union May Strike Amoco
DENVER, Colo. The Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Union said last night it will strike
Amoco, the nation's third largest refinery, if a new
contract is not settled by 12:01 a.m. tomorrow.
The union also threatened strike action against
other major oil companies unless agreement was
reached soon on new contracts.
At the same time, the union announced it had
reached a settlement with Atlantic Richfield Co.
(ARCO)on a new contract. The contract is equal in
value to the earlier settlement with Gulf Oil Corp.,
the union said.
Cambodian Rebels Bomb Convoy
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Communist-led
rebel gunners unleashed a deadly barrage on a
Mekong River convoy yesterday, killing 26 refugees
and wounding 42, Cambodian navy sources
reported. Government forces immediately launched
counterattacks north and east of Phnom Penh.
In South Vietnam, heavy fighting flared along
the Cambodian border 55 miles west of Saigon and
along the central coastal plain 300 miles farther
north.
Several attacks also were reported in the Saigon
region.
One South Vietnamese military official said,
"Hostile acts between the opposing forces have
reached what is believed to be the highest intensity
since the cease-fire nearly two years ago."
In New York, U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim expressed "gravest concern" at "the
increased scale of the fighting in recent weeks" in
Indochina.
CIA Actions Called Inappropriate
WASHINGTON Former CIA Director James
R. Schlesinger said yesterday the Central
Intelligence Agency engaged in inappropriate
activities but he called reports it conducted massive
domestic surveillance "overblown."
Schlesinger, who headed the spy agency for six
months in 1973, is now secretary of defense. His
comments on the CIA came during a Pentagon news
conference.
Schlesinger said the CIA domestic operations he
discovered when he became director of the agency
"were not activities in such number or so surprising
as to be a source of national turmoil."
He said they were activities "which, indeed, in
retrospect, are to be regretted."
But whether they violated any laws were
questions lawyers should decide, he said.
Schlesinger was one of three witnesses to appear
Monday before a blue-ribbon panel headed by Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller which President
Ford named to investigate allegations the CIA
engaged in widespread spying on Americans.
Faisal Launches Arab Tour
DAMASCUS, Syria King Faisal of Saudi
Arabia, launching a tour of Arab countries he
bankrolls, declared yesterday he will put all his
oilrich nation's resources at their disposal in the
struggle against Israel. But he gave no figures.
"Arab unity is realized," a Syrian radio
announcer shouted over and over as Faisal made a
triumphant entrance into Damascus through
hundreds of thousands of cheering Syrians.
Syrian President Hafez Assad told Faisal their
meeting will strengthen Arab solidarity, which he
called "the only way to get what we want liberation
of the occupied lands and restoration of usurped
Palestinian rights."
The two leaders exchanged their countries'
highest decorations after meeting at Damascus
airport, where doves of peace released in the

ceremonies flew through puffs of white smoke from
a 21-gun salute.
Auto Chiefs Hail Standards' End
DETROIT Top executives of the troubled auto
industry are hailing President Ford's new economic
program, especially his proposed five-year
moratorium on present auto emissions standards.
"The President's program sounds good to me,"
Henry Ford II said yesterday.
"It is aimed at the main problem areas
recession, inflation, energy and unemployment
and if it is put into effect promptly, it should begin
to pull us out of our present difficulties," said the
chairman of the company that bears his name.
The President proposed the moratorium on
emission standards in his address to the nation
Monday night. He indicated it would enable
American auto makers to achieve 40 percent savings
in gasoline consumption, one of the administration's
energy conservation goals.
The President's proposal falls short of the freeze
on new safety standards the industry has been
seeking.
But his call for an immediate federal income tax
cut of $l6 billion is seen in the Motor City as a
possible incentive step to help stimulate sagging
auto sales.
Nixon Confident In Tapes Suit?
NEW YORK Former White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 said yesterday he was told Richard
Mi Nixon was confident after talking with Chief
Justice Warren Burger that the Supreme Court
would rule in the former president's favor in the suit
over the White House tapes.
Dean said he was told about the alleged
conversations by Charles Colson, a former White
House aide.
The interview with Dean was aired yesterday on
the NBC Nightly News Spokesmen for both
Burger and Nixon denied Dean's assertions, NBC
said.
NBC Correspondent Carl Stern asked Dean how
Nixon thought he would win the court fight.
"... He seemed to have confidence," Dean
replied. "And I'm told he had some conversations
with the chief justice, Chief Justice Burger, shortly
after this suit was filed or somewhere along the line
and it gave him confidence that he was going to win
the lawsuit.
"That was some time in the spring of 1974?"
Stern asked.
"I don't know the precise time," Dean said. "But
I do know that from those calls he had a confidence
he was going to win the lawsuit."
In another development, the mortgage on
Nixon's portion of his beachfront San Clemente
estate is being paid off, but Nixon is not the
purchaser a source close to the former president said
yesterday.
Nixon will have to pay interest and the principal
to the new holder of the mortgage, the source said.
Arrangements were made through Nixon's
personal attorney, Dean S. Butler, for payment of
the $506,000 in principal and about $17,000 in
interest before the six-month extension for
payments expires this week.
The Nixon source declined to say who had
purchased the mortgage on behalf of the 62-year-old
former president.

Soviets Renounce Trade Pact
WASHINGTON The Soviet Union has
renounced its 1972 trade agreement with the United
States an,d nullified an apparent understanding to
step up Jewish emigration, Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger said last night.
In a far-reaching series of actions, President Ford
has decided he is now unable to grant the Soviets
nondiscriminatory tariff treatment under the new
Trade Reform Act, Kissinger said.
The break-up of a carefully nurtured commercial
agreement could have a major impact on
U.S.—Soviet relations, although Kissinger said "all
the communications we have received from the
Soviet government seem to suggest that the political
orientation is unchanged."
Kissinger said in a statement that Moscow views
provisions in the new trade act as interference in
Soviet domestic affairs.
"The administration regrets this turn of events,"
said Kissinger, whose detente policy has dominated
foreign affairs for several years.
He said the administration "has regarded and
continues to regard an orderly and mutually
beneficial trade relationship with the Soviet Union
as in important element in the over-all improvement
of relations."
Ford Proposes More Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON President Ford, already
seeking a one-shot $l6 billion tax reduction to
counter the recession, let it be known yesterday he
will ask Congress for $22.5 billion in additional
permanent tax cuts.
And, administration sources said the President
also plans to seek postponement of clean air
standards for power plants to help them convert
quickly from oil-burning to coal-burning boilers.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said the proposed
$2-a-barref tax on crude oil and taxes on windfall
profits of oil companies would add some $3O billion
to federal revenues. This money, he said, would
offset the income lost because of the tax reductions.
Ford will spell out his entire energy policy
package in his broadcast State of the Union address
to Congress this morning.
Although Ford himself and Nessen disclosed
much of the program in advance, the press secretary
promised there will be other surprises in the Capitol
Hill speech.

Oil Union May Strike Amoco
DENVER, Colo. The Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Union said last night it will strike
Amoco, the nation's third largest refinery, if a new
contract is not settled by 12:01 a.m. tomorrow.
The union also threatened strike action against
other major oil companies unless agreement was
reached soon on new contracts.
At the same time, the union announced it had
reached a settlement with Atlantic Richfield Co.
(ARCO)on a new contract. The contract is equal in
value to the earlier settlement with Gulf Oil Corp.,
the union said.
Cambodian Rebels Bomb Convoy
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Communist-led
rebel gunners unleashed a deadly barrage on a
Mekong River convoy yesterday, killing 26 refugees
and wounding 42, Cambodian navy sources
reported. Government forces immediately launched
counterattacks north and east of Phnom Penh.
In South Vietnam, heavy fighting flared along
the Cambodian border 55 miles west of Saigon and
along the central coastal plain 300 miles farther
north.
Several attacks also were reported in the Saigon
region.
One South Vietnamese military official said,
"Hostile acts between the opposing forces have
reached what is believed to be the highest intensity
since the cease-fire nearly two years ago."
In New York, U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim expressed "gravest concern" at "the
increased scale of the fighting in recent weeks" in
Indochina.
CIA Actions Called Inappropriate
WASHINGTON Former CIA Director James
R. Schlesinger said yesterday the Central
Intelligence Agency engaged in inappropriate
activities but he called reports it conducted massive
domestic surveillance "overblown."
Schlesinger, who headed the spy agency for six
months in 1973, is now secretary of defense. His
comments on the CIA came during a Pentagon news
conference.
Schlesinger said the CIA domestic operations he
discovered when he became director of the agency
"were not activities in such number or so surprising
as to be a source of national turmoil."
He said they were activities "which, indeed, in
retrospect, are to be regretted."
But whether they violated any laws were
questions lawyers should decide, he said.
Schlesinger was one of three witnesses to appear
Monday before a blue-ribbon panel headed by Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller which President
Ford named to investigate allegations the CIA
engaged in widespread spying on Americans.
Faisal Launches Arab Tour
DAMASCUS, Syria King Faisal of Saudi
Arabia, launching a tour of Arab countries he
bankrolls, declared yesterday he will put all his
oilrich nation's resources at their disposal in the
struggle against Israel. But he gave no figures.
"Arab unity is realized," a Syrian radio
announcer shouted over and over as Faisal made a
triumphant entrance into Damascus through
hundreds of thousands of cheering Syrians.
Syrian President Hafez Assad told Faisal their
meeting will strengthen Arab solidarity, which he
called "the only way to get what we want liberation
of the occupied lands and restoration of usurped
Palestinian rights."
The two leaders exchanged their countries'
highest decorations after meeting at Damascus
airport, where doves of peace released in the

ceremonies flew through puffs of white smoke from
a 21-gun salute.
Auto Chiefs Hail Standards' End
DETROIT Top executives of the troubled auto
industry are hailing President Ford's new economic
program, especially his proposed five-year
moratorium on present auto emissions standards.
"The President's program sounds good to me,"
Henry Ford II said yesterday.
"It is aimed at the main problem areas
recession, inflation, energy and unemployment
and if it is put into effect promptly, it should begin
to pull us out of our present difficulties," said the
chairman of the company that bears his name.
The President proposed the moratorium on
emission standards in his address to the nation
Monday night. He indicated it would enable
American auto makers to achieve 40 percent savings
in gasoline consumption, one of the administration's
energy conservation goals.
The President's proposal falls short of the freeze
on new safety standards the industry has been
seeking.
But his call for an immediate federal income tax
cut of $l6 billion is seen in the Motor City as a
possible incentive step to help stimulate sagging
auto sales.
Nixon Confident In Tapes Suit?
NEW YORK Former White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 said yesterday he was told Richard
Mi Nixon was confident after talking with Chief
Justice Warren Burger that the Supreme Court
would rule in the former president's favor in the suit
over the White House tapes.
Dean said he was told about the alleged
conversations by Charles Colson, a former White
House aide.
The interview with Dean was aired yesterday on
the NBC Nightly News Spokesmen for both
Burger and Nixon denied Dean's assertions, NBC
said.
NBC Correspondent Carl Stern asked Dean how

Stern asked.
"I don't know the precise time," Dean said. "But
I do know that from those calls he had a confidence
he was going to win the lawsuit."
In another development, the mortgage on
Nixon's portion of his beachfront San Clemente
estate is being paid off, but Nixon is not the
purchaser a source close to the former president said
yesterday.
Nixon will have to pay interest and the principal
to the new holder of the mortgage, the source said.
Arrangements were made through Nixon's
personal attorney, Dean S. Butler, for payment of
the $506,000 in principal and about $17,000 in
interest before the six-month extension for
payments expires this week.
The Nixon source declined to say who had
purchased the mortgage on behalf of the 62-year-old

personal attorney, Dean S. Butler, for payment of
the $506,000 in principal and about $17,000 in
interest before the six-month extension for
payments expires this week.
The Nixon source declined to say who had
purchased the mortgage on behalf of the 62-year-old
former president.

Soviets Renounce Trade Pact
WASHINGTON The Soviet Union has
renounced its 1972 trade agreement with the United
States an,d nullified an apparent understanding to
step up Jewish emigration, Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger said last night.
In a far-reaching series of actions, President Ford
has decided he is now unable to grant the Soviets
nondiscriminatory tariff treatment under the new
Trade Reform Act, Kissinger said.
The break-up of a carefully nurtured commercial
agreement could have a major impact on
U.S.—Soviet relations, although Kissinger said "all
the communications we have received from the
Soviet government seem to suggest that the political
orientation is unchanged."
Kissinger said in a statement that Moscow views
provisions in the new trade act as interference in
Soviet domestic affairs.
"The administration regrets this turn of events,"
said Kissinger, whose detente policy has dominated
foreign affairs for several years.
He said the administration "has regarded and
continues to regard an orderly and mutually
beneficial trade relationship with the Soviet Union
as in important element in the over-all improvement
of relations."
Ford Proposes More Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON President Ford, already
seeking a one-shot $l6 billion tax reduction to
counter the recession, let it be known yesterday he
will ask Congress for $22.5 billion in additional
permanent tax cuts.
And, administration sources said the President
also plans to seek postponement of clean air
standards for power plants to help them convert
quickly from oil-burning to coal-burning boilers.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said the proposed
$2-a-barref tax on crude oil and taxes on windfall
profits of oil companies would add some $3O billion
to federal revenues. This money, he said, would
offset the income lost because of the tax reductions.
Ford will spell out his entire energy policy
package in his broadcast State of the Union address
to Congress this morning.
Although Ford himself and Nessen disclosed
much of the program in advance, the press secretary
promised there will be other surprises in the Capitol
Hill speech.

Oil Union May Strike Amoco
DENVER, Colo. The Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Union said last night it will strike
Amoco, the nation's third largest refinery, if a new
contract is not settled by 12:01 a.m. tomorrow.
The union also threatened strike action against
other major oil companies unless agreement was
reached soon on new contracts.
At the same time, the union announced it had
reached a settlement with Atlantic Richfield Co.
(ARCO)on a new contract. The contract is equal in
value to the earlier settlement with Gulf Oil Corp.,
the union said.
Cambodian Rebels Bomb Convoy
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Communist-led
rebel gunners unleashed a deadly barrage on a
Mekong River convoy yesterday, killing 26 refugees
and wounding 42, Cambodian navy sources
reported. Government forces immediately launched
counterattacks north and east of Phnom Penh.
In South Vietnam, heavy fighting flared along
the Cambodian border 55 miles west of Saigon and
along the central coastal plain 300 miles farther
north.
Several attacks also were reported in the Saigon
region.
One South Vietnamese military official said,
"Hostile acts between the opposing forces have
reached what is believed to be the highest intensity
since the cease-fire nearly two years ago."
In New York, U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim expressed "gravest concern" at "the
increased scale of the fighting in recent weeks" in
Indochina.
CIA Actions Called Inappropriate
WASHINGTON Former CIA Director James
R. Schlesinger said yesterday the Central
Intelligence Agency engaged in inappropriate
activities but he called reports it conducted massive
domestic surveillance "overblown."
Schlesinger, who headed the spy agency for six
months in 1973, is now secretary of defense. His
comments on the CIA came during a Pentagon news
conference.
Schlesinger said the CIA domestic operations he
discovered when he became director of the agency
"were not activities in such number or so surprising
as to be a source of national turmoil."
He said they were activities "which, indeed, in
retrospect, are to be regretted."
But whether they violated any laws were
questions lawyers should decide, he said.
Schlesinger was one of three witnesses to appear
Monday before a blue-ribbon panel headed by Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller which President
Ford named to investigate allegations the CIA
engaged in widespread spying on Americans.
Faisal Launches Arab Tour
DAMASCUS, Syria King Faisal of Saudi
Arabia, launching a tour of Arab countries he
bankrolls, declared yesterday he will put all his
oilrich nation's resources at their disposal in the
struggle against Israel. But he gave no figures.
"Arab unity is realized," a Syrian radio
announcer shouted over and over as Faisal made a
triumphant entrance into Damascus through
hundreds of thousands of cheering Syrians.
Syrian President Hafez Assad told Faisal their
meeting will strengthen Arab solidarity, which he
called "the only way to get what we want liberation
of the occupied lands and restoration of usurped
Palestinian rights."
The two leaders exchanged their countries'
highest decorations after meeting at Damascus
airport, where doves of peace released in the

ceremonies flew through puffs of white smoke from
a 21-gun salute.
Auto Chiefs Hail Standards' End
DETROIT Top executives of the troubled auto
industry are hailing President Ford's new economic
program, especially his proposed five-year
moratorium on present auto emissions standards.
"The President's program sounds good to me,"
Henry Ford II said yesterday.
"It is aimed at the main problem areas
recession, inflation, energy and unemployment
and if it is put into effect promptly, it should begin
to pull us out of our present difficulties," said the
chairman of the company that bears his name.
The President proposed the moratorium on
emission standards in his address to the nation
Monday night. He indicated it would enable
American auto makers to achieve 40 percent savings
in gasoline consumption, one of the administration's
energy conservation goals.
The President's proposal falls short of the freeze
on new safety standards the industry has been
seeking.
But his call for an immediate federal income tax
cut of $l6 billion is seen in the Motor City as a
possible incentive step to help stimulate sagging
auto sales.
Nixon Confident In Tapes Suit?
NEW YORK Former White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 said yesterday he was told Richard

over the White House tapes.
Dean said he was told about the alleged
conversations by Charles Colson, a former White
House aide.
The interview with Dean was aired yesterday on

In another development, the mortgage on
Nixon's portion of his beachfront San Clemente
estate is being paid off, but Nixon is not the

yesterday.
Nixon will have to pay interest and the principal

In another development, the mortgage on
Nixon's portion of his beachfront San Clemente
estate is being paid off, but Nixon is not the
purchaser a source close to the former president said
yesterday.
Nixon will have to pay interest and the principal
to the new holder of the mortgage, the source said.
Arrangements were made through Nixon's
personal attorney, Dean S. Butler, for payment of
the $506,000 in principal and about $17,000 in
interest before the six-month extension for
payments expires this week.
The Nixon source declined to say who had
purchased the mortgage on behalf of the 62-year-old
former president.

Soviets Renounce Trade Pact
WASHINGTON The Soviet Union has
renounced its 1972 trade agreement with the United
States an,d nullified an apparent understanding to
step up Jewish emigration, Secretary of State Henry
A. Kissinger said last night.
In a far-reaching series of actions, President Ford
has decided he is now unable to grant the Soviets
nondiscriminatory tariff treatment under the new
Trade Reform Act, Kissinger said.
The break-up of a carefully nurtured commercial
agreement could have a major impact on
U.S.—Soviet relations, although Kissinger said "all
the communications we have received from the
Soviet government seem to suggest that the political
orientation is unchanged."
Kissinger said in a statement that Moscow views
provisions in the new trade act as interference in
Soviet domestic affairs.
"The administration regrets this turn of events,"
said Kissinger, whose detente policy has dominated
foreign affairs for several years.
He said the administration "has regarded and
continues to regard an orderly and mutually
beneficial trade relationship with the Soviet Union
as in important element in the over-all improvement
of relations."
Ford Proposes More Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON President Ford, already
seeking a one-shot $l6 billion tax reduction to
counter the recession, let it be known yesterday he
will ask Congress for $22.5 billion in additional
permanent tax cuts.
And, administration sources said the President
also plans to seek postponement of clean air
standards for power plants to help them convert
quickly from oil-burning to coal-burning boilers.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said the proposed
$2-a-barref tax on crude oil and taxes on windfall
profits of oil companies would add some $3O billion
to federal revenues. This money, he said, would
offset the income lost because of the tax reductions.
Ford will spell out his entire energy policy
package in his broadcast State of the Union address
to Congress this morning.
Although Ford himself and Nessen disclosed
much of the program in advance, the press secretary
promised there will be other surprises in the Capitol
Hill speech.

Oil Union May Strike Amoco
DENVER, Colo. The Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Union said last night it will strike
Amoco, the nation's third largest refinery, if a new
contract is not settled by 12:01 a.m. tomorrow.
The union also threatened strike action against
other major oil companies unless agreement was
reached soon on new contracts.
At the same time, the union announced it had
reached a settlement with Atlantic Richfield Co.
(ARCO)on a new contract. The contract is equal in
value to the earlier settlement with Gulf Oil Corp.,
the union said.
Cambodian Rebels Bomb Convoy
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Communist-led
rebel gunners unleashed a deadly barrage on a
Mekong River convoy yesterday, killing 26 refugees
and wounding 42, Cambodian navy sources
reported. Government forces immediately launched
counterattacks north and east of Phnom Penh.
In South Vietnam, heavy fighting flared along
the Cambodian border 55 miles west of Saigon and
along the central coastal plain 300 miles farther
north.
Several attacks also were reported in the Saigon
region.
One South Vietnamese military official said,
"Hostile acts between the opposing forces have
reached what is believed to be the highest intensity
since the cease-fire nearly two years ago."
In New York, U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim expressed "gravest concern" at "the
increased scale of the fighting in recent weeks" in
Indochina.
CIA Actions Called Inappropriate
WASHINGTON Former CIA Director James
R. Schlesinger said yesterday the Central
Intelligence Agency engaged in inappropriate
activities but he called reports it conducted massive
domestic surveillance "overblown."
Schlesinger, who headed the spy agency for six
months in 1973, is now secretary of defense. His
comments on the CIA came during a Pentagon news
conference.
Schlesinger said the CIA domestic operations he
discovered when he became director of the agency
"were not activities in such number or so surprising
as to be a source of national turmoil."
He said they were activities "which, indeed, in
retrospect, are to be regretted."
But whether they violated any laws were
questions lawyers should decide, he said.
Schlesinger was one of three witnesses to appear
Monday before a blue-ribbon panel headed by Vice
President Nelson A. Rockefeller which President
Ford named to investigate allegations the CIA
engaged in widespread spying on Americans.
Faisal Launches Arab Tour
DAMASCUS, Syria King Faisal of Saudi
Arabia, launching a tour of Arab countries he
bankrolls, declared yesterday he will put all his
oilrich nation's resources at their disposal in the
struggle against Israel. But he gave no figures.
"Arab unity is realized," a Syrian radio
announcer shouted over and over as Faisal made a
triumphant entrance into Damascus through
hundreds of thousands of cheering Syrians.
Syrian President Hafez Assad told Faisal their
meeting will strengthen Arab solidarity, which he
called "the only way to get what we want liberation
of the occupied lands and restoration of usurped
Palestinian rights."
The two leaders exchanged their countries'
highest decorations after meeting at Damascus
airport, where doves of peace released in the

ceremonies flew through puffs of white smoke from
a 21-gun salute.
Auto Chiefs Hail Standards' End
DETROIT Top executives of the troubled auto
industry are hailing President Ford's new economic
program, especially his proposed five-year
moratorium on present auto emissions standards.
"The President's program sounds good to me,"
Henry Ford II said yesterday.
"It is aimed at the main problem areas
recession, inflation, energy and unemployment
and if it is put into effect promptly, it should begin
to pull us out of our present difficulties," said the
chairman of the company that bears his name.
The President proposed the moratorium on
emission standards in his address to the nation
Monday night. He indicated it would enable
American auto makers to achieve 40 percent savings
in gasoline consumption, one of the administration's
energy conservation goals.
The President's proposal falls short of the freeze
on new safety standards the industry has been
seeking.
But his call for an immediate federal income tax
cut of $l6 billion is seen in the Motor City as a
possible incentive step to help stimulate sagging
auto sales.
Nixon Confident In Tapes Suit?
NEW YORK Former White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 said yesterday he was told Richard
Mi Nixon was confident after talking with Chief
Justice Warren Burger that the Supreme Court
would rule in the former president's favor in the suit
over the White House tapes.
Dean said he was told about the alleged
conversations by Charles Colson, a former White
House aide.
The interview with Dean was aired yesterday on
the NBC Nightly News Spokesmen for both
Burger and Nixon denied Dean's assertions, NBC
said.
NBC Correspondent Carl Stern asked Dean how
Nixon thought he would win the court fight.
"... He seemed to have confidence," Dean
replied. "And I'm told he had some conversations
with the chief justice, Chief Justice Burger, shortly
after this suit was filed or somewhere along the line
and it gave him confidence that he was going to win
the lawsuit.
"That was some time in the spring of 1974?"
Stern asked.
"I don't know the precise time," Dean said. "But
I do know that from those calls he had a confidence
he was going to win the lawsuit."
