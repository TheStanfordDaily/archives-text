### MICHAEL TESTA 
"The absence of war has had a
formative effect in the shaping of the
American character" said Assoc.
History Prof. David Kennedy in his
speech last night before a nearly full
house in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The fourth speaker in this year's
Tuesday Evening Lecture Series,
Kennedy spoke of "War and the
American Character."

"America's peculiarly happy
experience with war prior to Vietnam"
contributed heavily to the shaping of
American attitudes and strategies
towards war, he said.
According to Kennedy, geographic
isolation gave 19th Century America
the advantage of "free security"
making large standing armies
unnecessary. Between 1815 and 1917,
America did not fight a single war with
a major power, he pointed out.
Alluding to the American Civil War,
World War I and Vietnam, Kennedy
said, "Americans think security should
be total and unconditional."
Americans regard "the total
destruction of the enemy's military
power" as the object of warfare.
Kennedy said, the history of the
American Civil War confirms the
American [Northern] belief ih the
"total victory, total security" strategy.
He said that from the standpoint of
Northerners "the war was
distant... fought on foreign soil."
He explained that, while' Gen.
William T. Sherman's cut a path of fire
and destruction through the South, the
war meant "adventure and escape
from routine for young Northerners."

Kennedy called the Civil War "the
greatest war of thr 19th Century"
terms of its destruction and duration.
"The Civil War became a model for
all wars to follow," and "America's
ideas of romantic chivalric wars were
reaffirmed again in the First World
War."
Although America's gallant g
"doughboys" of World War I
transformed into World War ll's "Willy
and Joe, two dirty, tired guys bearing
up under a dirty job," Kennedy
maintained that America's war
experience remained basically happy
and "victorious." g
Kennedy said that while America
no longer enjoys the "free security" of
the 19th Century, some pre-Cold War
"traits have persisted after the
objective period."
"In this century of total war,"
America still followed a strategy of
"total annihilation" in Korea and in +
Vietnam.
Citing expenditures of nine and
12 percent of the Gross National
Product on defense since World War 11,
Kennedy said, "We can no longer
consider ourselves free of war
preparedness and militarism." ' #

Kennedy said that while America
no longer enjoys the "free security" of
the 19th Century, some pre-Cold War

objective period."
"In this century of total war,"

"The absence of war has had a
formative effect in the shaping of the
American character" said Assoc.
History Prof. David Kennedy in his
speech last night before a nearly full
house in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The fourth speaker in this year's
Tuesday Evening Lecture Series,
Kennedy spoke of "War and the
American Character."

"America's peculiarly happy
experience with war prior to Vietnam"
contributed heavily to the shaping of
American attitudes and strategies
towards war, he said.
According to Kennedy, geographic
isolation gave 19th Century America
the advantage of "free security"
making large standing armies
unnecessary. Between 1815 and 1917,
America did not fight a single war with
a major power, he pointed out.
Alluding to the American Civil War,
World War I and Vietnam, Kennedy
said, "Americans think security should
be total and unconditional."
Americans regard "the total
destruction of the enemy's military
power" as the object of warfare.
Kennedy said, the history of the
American Civil War confirms the
American [Northern] belief ih the
"total victory, total security" strategy.
He said that from the standpoint of
Northerners "the war was
distant... fought on foreign soil."
He explained that, while' Gen.
William T. Sherman's cut a path of fire
and destruction through the South, the
war meant "adventure and escape
from routine for young Northerners."

Kennedy called the Civil War "the
greatest war of thr 19th Century"
terms of its destruction and duration.
"The Civil War became a model for
all wars to follow," and "America's
ideas of romantic chivalric wars were
reaffirmed again in the First World
War."
