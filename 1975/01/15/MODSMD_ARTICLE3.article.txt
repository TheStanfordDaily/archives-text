# SWOPSI Policy Board Opposes Program Cut
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
The SWOPSI Policy Board sent a
letter to Provost William F. Miller
yesterday saying that it opposed Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs' recommendation to Miller
"about the elimination of the SWOPSI
program."
Gibbs has recommended that
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops On
Political and Social Issues) and
Program in Urban Studies end in June
1976, and that SCIRE (the Stanford
Center for Innovation and Research in
Education) and the Undergraduate

Writing Program (UWP) end this June.
Miller received the
recommendations yesterday. Gibbs
told the Daily that the provost had not
yet responded to his suggestions.
The letter to Miller, signed by eight
members of the SWOPSI Policy Board,
explained that SWOPSI was "not an
experimental program; currently in its
sixth year of successful operation, it is
a regular component of the University
curriculum."
In Gibbs' memorandum to Miller,
he said, "From now on our [the
University's] policy should be to
support 'innovative' or 'experimental'
programs only for a fixed period of
time, regardless of the interest or
support that remains at the end of this
period."
'Systematically Eliminate It'
Chris Elms, a Policy Board member,
said he was "frustrated" because
"Gibbs says it's not going to make any
difference" whether a program is
beneficial or not, since the University
will systematically eliminate it.
Meanwhile, doubts were expressed
about the future of the Undergraduate
Studies Office and of Gibbs' position
as head of the office.
Ellen Nold, director of the UWP,
said there was "something in the air:"
that Administration officials were
considering the elimination of the
Office of Undergraduate Studies.
'Reorganize His Activities'
"He [Gibbs] will have to reorganize
his activities," Nold said. "He may be
reorganized out of the University."
Gibbs confirmed yesterday that he

will present a report to the provost
outlining possible reorganization
schemes for his office.
"Whether it [the reorganization
plan] gets to the Faculty Senate
remains to be seen," Gibbs said. "The
role of the office and its future has
been discussed."
General Budget Reductions
However, Gibbs noted that the
University considers "any new
administrative component" to be
subject to budget reductions. The
Undergraduate Studies Office has been
in existence for six years.
"I'm the last person to say it [the
office] should be eliminated," Gibbs
said.
Gibbs is also a professor of
anthropology.
Herman: 'Unfortunate'
ASSU President Mike Herman said
it would be "unfortunate" if the
Undergraduate Studies Office is
phased out. Nold added, "It would be
a real degradation to undergraduate
education."
Nold said Gibbs' office "has done
many beneficial things" for the UWP.
She emphasized that elimination of
the UWP does not mean the end of
writing tutorials here.
'Not Totally Bleak'
"It's not totally bleak," she said.
"The English Department may teach
the writing courses. I'm working on it.
I think we'll be successful."
The only way for students to
express their concerns on the cutting
of programs is "by writing letters to

the provost," Nold said.
While Nold insisted that the UWP _
can be absorbed by an academic
department, the,SWOPSI Policy Board
maintained in its letter that "the
SWOPSI program serves unique
functions in the University which
cannot be carried out by regular
academic departments.
SWOPSI Director Andrew Parnes #
said, "The issue goes beyond just the
dollars. It goes to the functions of
SWOPSI and whether those functions
could be performed without an
independent SWOPSI."
Herman suggested that "SWOPSI
programs may find themselves under Â£
the ASSU banner" if the University
decides to cut off their budgets.
Elms welcomed Herman's
suggestion but said that SWOPSI
courses taught under ASSU
sponsorship could no longer be taken
for credit. 0
