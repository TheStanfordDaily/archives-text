# Academic, Financial Problems Cited
## Peru Program Suspended 
### DON COX 
The newly created overseas
program in Peru will be suspended
next year while administrators
reevaluate the program in light of
serious questions about its academic
quality and unforseen financial
problems, officials in the Overseas
Studies Office confirmed yesterday.
Many of the students in the
program's first session have returned
to the United States or are studying or
traveling independently in Peru after
becoming disillusioned with what they
believe is the unsatisfactory academic
quality of La Cattolica University- in
Lima.
Of the 12 students who enrolled in
the program autumn quarter, seven
were supposed to stay on a second
quarter. Only one student did,
according to Donald R. Price, associate
director of the Oversees Studies Office.
While some of the students were
obligated by contract to stay, Price
said he "felt that because of the
unanswered questions and uncertainty
about the program, we should release
the students from their commitment."
The original intention of the
program's administrators was to have
the students take classes at t the
university in Lima for a semester and
then spend the second quarter engaged
in independent study projects, Price
said. However, since many of the
classes turned out to be "no good" in
the fall, students were actually
engaged in independent work during
the first quarter.
Additional Fees Questioned
Senior Susan McGinnis returned
from Peru Saturday. She considered
her time in Peru "a valuable cultural
experience" but that the program was
"disorganized" and that the university
was "terrible."
Senior Rob Woods also found
economics courses at the university
unsatisfactory and was unwilling to
pay for another quarter of
independent study.
Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall said the reports about the
university "raise serious questions

about whether to put students in
there, though the group was by
necessity an experimental group."
Mancall said the selection of the
program site and the university had
been made after careful research, "but
if that's the best one, that may say
something about the problems of the
country. Lima is not Paris, Florence or
Berlin but rather in a developing
country."
"You just can't find a university in
Latin America that's a Latin American
Stanford," agreed Woods. "They have
a somewhat more casual approach to
education that is typical of the
Peruvian culture. They don't have a
fixation with time and so classes don't
always start or stop as scheduled," he
said.
'Quality Of Education'
"It's not Europe; it's not the U.S.
The quality of education is just not
the same," said McGinnis. She said she
found the transition between here and
Peru a "rude shock."
A shutdown of the university by
the government in December during a
period of internal unrest in the
country added to the group's
problems. Prices of goods were
climbing rapidly and the students were
also rattled by a severe earthquake.
Inadequate preparation for what
they were to experience was part of
the problem, McGinnis and Woods
said.
Things Changed So Fast'
'The Overseas Office sent a
professor down in May to look at the
place but things changed so fast
prices went up so fast. A tense
political situation developed that made
it hard to do research there,"
McGinnis said.
Woods agreed that "it is necessary
to go down there with the right set of
expectations and knowing the culture
better."
Despite the problems with the
university, both students agreed that
the experience was valuable. "It was a
totally non-academic experience as far
as formal studies in the

university but academics became a
really small part of the total
experience which was valuable," said
McGinnis.
Mancall said that although the
Overseas Office was committed to a
program in Latin America, it "may
have to seek out the best place for
students in Latin America" if a review
of the Peru program indicates the
Lima location is inadequate.
Latin America Studies Director
Bernard Siegel said he
would undertake a review of the
program. He said the Peru location
may have to be abandoned due to
financial problems alone, "but it's still
too early to say."
