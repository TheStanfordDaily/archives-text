# First Offer In Eight Years
## Prof Rejects CIA Research Grant 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has offered to
fund a faculty research project in the Psychology
Department, eight years after the last known
CIA-sponsored work was done on campus.
Assoc. Psychology Prof. Daryl Bern turned down an
offer from the CIA last quarter to fund research on
handwriting analysis, with emphasis on studying cardiac
patients. His handwriting research has not dealt with
cardiac patients.
Bern waited until he could hear the opinions of his
colleagues at a department meeting before he made a
definite decision. The Psychology Department decided the
question of CIA funding should be up to the individual, and
Bern chose to reject the offer.
"It's partly that I disapprove so strongly of things the
agency does" beyond its legal boundaries, Bern explained.
He said he also hesitated to work with the CIA because of
the "foot-in-the-door" effect.
Political Projects
If he started working with CIA researchers and
representatives on this study he could be drawn more easily
into projects with political implications, Bern said.
Bern's offer from the CIA placed no restrictions on the
publication of his results. It would have allowed him access
to unpublished, but unclassified, research done by the CIA
and to a larger data-gathering system.
Those considerations, plus the chance to work with a
psychologist who was familiar with current handwriting
research, were even more tempting than the funding, he

added.
Bern said the CIA representative told him he would send
Bern copies of the unpublished research whether or not he
accepted the grant. But Bern said he hasn't received the
material yet.
Students Say No
After he rejected the offer, Bern presented the problem
to his Psychology 1 class, asking for student opinions.
Although he didn't take an exact count, he estimated that a
slight majority of the students indicated they would not
have accepted the funds. Most of them agreed that moral
disapproval of the CIA would prompt their choice, Bern
said.
Robert Simmons, manager of Sponsored Projects Office,
reported that University policy places no prohibitions
against using CIA funds, but added he knew of no recent
CIA-funded work on campus.
Research projects are reviewed by the University, but
the source of sponsorship is "an individual decision by the
faculty member," Simmons said.
Although University policy permits unclassified research
of the kind Bern was offered, researchers cannot accept
grants or contracts for classified work.
This policy was developed in 1969 by the Committee on
Research Policy, after what a 1971 SWOPSI report called
"a mild uproar" over classified and CIA-funded research.
In 1966, the Daily revealed the CIA was sponsoring two
contracts at the University, both masked by dummy budget
entries.
