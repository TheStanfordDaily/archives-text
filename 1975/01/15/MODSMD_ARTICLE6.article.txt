# Examine Federal Tax Cuts
## Economists Here Approve Ford Plan 
### DAN PYNE 
George Bernard Shaw once said, "If all
economists were laid end to end they would not
reach a conclusion."
Two of three University economists
surveyed, however, seem to conclude that
President Gerald Ford's recent economic
proposals are basically sound. And even the
third, a Marxist, thinks the moves will help Ford
fulfill his economic plan.
Ford outlined his program, which includes a
federal income tax cut of $l6 billion in
recyclable revenue into the government, and a
one-year increase in the business investment tax
credit, last night in a "pre-State of the
Union" address.
"All in all it's a pretty sensible program,"
George Leland Bach, professor of economics
and business, commented yesterday afternoon.
"President Ford has got a tough problem in
trying to deal with both unemployment and
inflation, and he can't afford to over-stimulate
the economy."
Bach, who participated in one of Ford's
economic summit meetings last year, said the
economy has suffered "a very sharp down-turn,"
that could become serious "unless something is
done to check the drop." He added that while
the income tax cuts are "not very much for a
big economy like ours, perhaps one percent of
the total output," the moderate measure would
stimulate the economy without causing inflation
to flare up again.
Too large a stimulus, he said, would put the
economy right back where it was, with high
unemployment and inflation.
Thomas G. Moore, a senior fellow in
economics at the Hoover Institution, who also

took part in Ford's summit meetings agreed
generally with Bach's analysis.
"The proposals are certainly a step in the
right direction," he said, "hnd they will
probably have a modest effect on the
economy."
Moore expressed doubts, however, about
whether the tax cuts will be effective when
coupled with oil-price increases caused by taxes
on oil imports.
'An Appropriate Stimulus'
"The move to cut income taxes is an
appropriate stimulus, but he's offsetting this to
some extent with increased petroleum taxes.
Ford said he would return the money to the
public, but did not explain in detail how he
plans to do so," Moore said.
"And unless the money is recycled into the
economy, it probably won't be stimulated by
the measures."
Bach also mentioned that how and when the
President redistributes the oil tax income will
the effectiveness of the program. "If
he spreads out the rebates properly between
corporations, individual taxpayers and the poor,
the program will help."
Gurley States Opinions
Economics Prof. John Gurley, who is
teaching a course in Marxian and radical
economics this quarter, explained that the
proposals are appropriate for what the Ford
Administration is trying to do.
"It's a well thought-out program designed to
prevent any further deepening of the recession,
but also to prolong unemployment." Gurley
said "they want to whip the inflation, but they
are concerned about complete collapse."
He explained further that he thinks the Ford

Administration "wants to break the back of
labor. One way to do it is to keep
unemployment at a relatively high level."
Wage Demands Cause Inflation
Gurley said excessive wage demands have
caused the current inflation. This "wage-pull"
inflation shows a deterioration in the capitalistic
system, he said, and "to prevent further
deterioration, they [Ford's Administration]
have to strengthen capital relative to labor."
The increase in business investment tax credit
will aid this shift of power, he said.
Moore and Bach agreed that the credit would
stimulate new business investment, but Moore
said he believes businesses expand when demand
for their products increases.
Inflation Rooted In Demand
He claimed the current inflation was rooted
in aggregate demand, and the most beneficial
effect of Ford's proposal would be to indirectly
cause the Federal Reserve to increase the supply
of money in the economy, which would
stimulate more demand.
Moore also said that, in some ways, the
proposals were unnecessary because, "by the
time they have much effect the economy will be
pulling out of the recession somewhat."
He doubted Congress would act on the oil
tax increase before the summer, but thought
it would probably push the income tax
reduction through.
Bach added that Ford probably proposed an
income tax cut more modest than the one he
wanted because, "he must expect that Congress
will cut taxes more than he has recommended.
They'll want to get most of the credit for a
popular move like this."


ECONOMY NOW—Economics and Business
Prof. George Leland Bach said he realized the
dangers of over-stimulating the economy with
federal income tax cuts. He said, however, in a
big economy like that of the U.S., the measure
shouldn't cause problems.

dangers of over-stimulating the economy with
federal income tax cuts. He said, however, in a
big economy like that of the U.S., the measure
shouldn't cause problems.
George Bernard Shaw once said, "If all
economists were laid end to end they would not
reach a conclusion."
Two of three University economists
surveyed, however, seem to conclude that
President Gerald Ford's recent economic
proposals are basically sound. And even the
third, a Marxist, thinks the moves will help Ford
fulfill his economic plan.
Ford outlined his program, which includes a
federal income tax cut of $l6 billion in
recyclable revenue into the government, and a
one-year increase in the business investment tax
credit, last night in a "pre-State of the
Union" address.
"All in all it's a pretty sensible program,"
George Leland Bach, professor of economics
and business, commented yesterday afternoon.
"President Ford has got a tough problem in
trying to deal with both unemployment and
inflation, and he can't afford to over-stimulate
the economy."
Bach, who participated in one of Ford's
economic summit meetings last year, said the
economy has suffered "a very sharp down-turn,"
that could become serious "unless something is
done to check the drop." He added that while
the income tax cuts are "not very much for a
big economy like ours, perhaps one percent of
the total output," the moderate measure would
stimulate the economy without causing inflation
to flare up again.
Too large a stimulus, he said, would put the
economy right back where it was, with high
unemployment and inflation.
Thomas G. Moore, a senior fellow in
economics at the Hoover Institution, who also

took part in Ford's summit meetings agreed
generally with Bach's analysis.
"The proposals are certainly a step in the
right direction," he said, "hnd they will
probably have a modest effect on the
economy."
Moore expressed doubts, however, about
whether the tax cuts will be effective when
coupled with oil-price increases caused by taxes
on oil imports.
'An Appropriate Stimulus'
"The move to cut income taxes is an
appropriate stimulus, but he's offsetting this to
some extent with increased petroleum taxes.
Ford said he would return the money to the
public, but did not explain in detail how he
plans to do so," Moore said.
"And unless the money is recycled into the
economy, it probably won't be stimulated by
the measures."
Bach also mentioned that how and when the
President redistributes the oil tax income will
the effectiveness of the program. "If
he spreads out the rebates properly between
corporations, individual taxpayers and the poor,
the program will help."
Gurley States Opinions
Economics Prof. John Gurley, who is
teaching a course in Marxian and radical
economics this quarter, explained that the
proposals are appropriate for what the Ford
Administration is trying to do.
"It's a well thought-out program designed to
prevent any further deepening of the recession,
but also to prolong unemployment." Gurley
said "they want to whip the inflation, but they
are concerned about complete collapse."
He explained further that he thinks the Ford

Administration "wants to break the back of
labor. One way to do it is to keep
unemployment at a relatively high level."
Wage Demands Cause Inflation
Gurley said excessive wage demands have
caused the current inflation. This "wage-pull"
inflation shows a deterioration in the capitalistic
system, he said, and "to prevent further
deterioration, they [Ford's Administration]
have to strengthen capital relative to labor."
The increase in business investment tax credit
will aid this shift of power, he said.
Moore and Bach agreed that the credit would
stimulate new business investment, but Moore
said he believes businesses expand when demand
for their products increases.
Inflation Rooted In Demand
He claimed the current inflation was rooted
in aggregate demand, and the most beneficial
effect of Ford's proposal would be to indirectly
cause the Federal Reserve to increase the supply
of money in the economy, which would
stimulate more demand.
Moore also said that, in some ways, the
proposals were unnecessary because, "by the
time they have much effect the economy will be
pulling out of the recession somewhat."
He doubted Congress would act on the oil
tax increase before the summer, but thought
it would probably push the income tax
reduction through.
Bach added that Ford probably proposed an
income tax cut more modest than the one he
wanted because, "he must expect that Congress
will cut taxes more than he has recommended.
They'll want to get most of the credit for a
popular move like this."
