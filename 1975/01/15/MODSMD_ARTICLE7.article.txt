## Grading Flap 
### 
an We are strongly opposed, to the recommendation by the Ad Hoc
"Panel to Study the Grading System to reinstate a drop deadline for
and a negative notation on student transcripts for those
2f not successfully completed after that deadline.
f!f 8 W? ur 8 e t ' ie Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achievement
' (C : AAA), which begins discussing the Panel's report today, and the
Senate to overturn the Panel's recommendations and keep the
present grading system intact.
.. As much as we try to understand the rationale for bringing back
tfee more "historical" transcript, we are still not convinced that the
changes suggested by the Panel would benefit anyone.
It has never been made clear what harm there is in allowing
to drop courses at the end of a quarter. If a student decides
at the end of a course that he isn't prepared enough to take die final,
ra#ffy r should the option of dropping the course be taken away from
n t¥frf{?'Who would benefit from forcing that student to either take the
' ! ffnal or have a black mark on his record? /
'' Proponents of the change back to the "historical record" system
' argue that (1) it is misleading to leave failing grades off of a transcript,
1(2) that an earlier drop deadline would encourage students to be more
responsible about their courses and (3) that outstanding students are
penalized if other students are permitted to drop difficult courses late
1 in the quarter without penalty.
6 ; We find none of these arguments persuasive. First, it seems no
"mdre misleading to leave failing grades off a transcript than to omit
-'many other student accomplishments both in and out of the
s classroom which never appear on a transcript. It seems even more
to include late drops and failures under a single notation.
5' Second, instead of encouraging student responsibility, we believe
"that reinstatement of the drop deadline will discourage student
initiative. We feel that students who find themselves behind in their
work at the time of the drop deadline will tend to panic and drop one
•or more of their courses, even though those courses could be
% successfully completed with a final push. In addition, we believe
"students will be more reluctant to experiment with difficult courses.
Third, we believe that outstanding students can usually distinguish
themselves sufficiently without suffering detrimental effects from
who drop courses.
9niJ Even the Panel's report acknowledged that reinstating the drop
tdeidline will not have much effect on Stanford's widely publicized
! grade inflation. The real source of this problem, we feel, is increased
,leni?ncy on the part of professors.
|n a survey taken in 1968-1969, 29 percent of the grades given
were A's while 35 percent were B's. The figures are now reversed. A
survey taken of grades given autumn quarter 1973 indicates that 39
percent were A's while only 26 percent were B's.
w xiWhile we strongly oppose the notion that there should be a
standardized grading curve, we do feel that professors ought to be a
stringent in handing out high grades.
We are also somewhat alarmed by the heavy
bias on the two committees studying the
jpssue. None of the faculty members on the Ad Hoc Panel are from the
humanities or social sciences, and only two members of the C-AAA
H come from outside the "hard" sciences. This is important because
|| several Panel members declared they were fed up by students who
•| took courses several times, each time dropping out just before the
E final. This happens much more frequently in "hard" science courses
than in other areas.
