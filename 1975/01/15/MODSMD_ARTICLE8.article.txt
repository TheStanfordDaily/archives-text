# Willow (Part II)
## 
### Mark Funk 
Randy Broderson makes a
number of strong points in his
i column on the Willow Road
controversy (Daily, Jan. 13).
He misses the overriding thrust
of the analysis. It was not a rehash
; of the arguments (on either side)
( or problems which have muddled
' the issue. The analysis dealt with
e the demographics of the Palo Alto
| City Council and how it would
i probably vote on the Willow Road
) affair.
When characterizing the article
t> as having "inadequacies," he
\ seemed intent on attacking the
messenger as well as the message.
, Apparently, I left myself open to
1 criticism when I failed to mount a
soapbox and scold the City
; Council for lacking (in
| Broderson's opinion) any sort of
\ an ecological conscience.
Mine was not an editorial, but
| a news analysis. In spite of that, I
1 felt the ecological concerns facing
the Council and the faction
j representing them there should be
\ looked at. This I did.
Broderson said that nothing
appeared on it, but the stances of
I Vice Mayor Alan Henderson and

Enid Pearson were included in the
story. Also, a Daily story
published on Jan. 6 articulated
the fears of that faction on the
Council.
Finally, Broderson objected to
the statement that the
University's final position on
Willow Road "... boils down to
dollars and cents." Obviously he
felt the statement was a snap
summary.
It was not. That statement was
preceded by a quote from Vice
President for Business and
Finance Robert R. Augsburger. It
dealt with that.
"It all boils down to dollars
and cents," is a summary of the
feeling I got from a quote
defending University policy. In an
offhand fashion, it might even
support Broderson's claim that
Stanford is callous to the
ecological concerns of the area.
But he should not consider it my
final judgement (or the Daily's)
on the entire Willow Road affair.
That is not correct.

covered the Willow Road
controversy.)
