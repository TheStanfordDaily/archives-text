Subscriptions sales for the ASSU
Lecture Note Service have netted over
$900, according to Vic Petroff, the
j service's director.
"We're not even close to being
finished," said Petroff. "I suspect it
will continue until the end of next
week and then taper off." Petroff
added, "Our major concern is getting
good notes to the students. If we do
t that, subscriptions should stay up."
This week, free notes are being
passed out in the 14 classes serviced by
the lecture service "as a way of letting
students see what is going on," said
ASSU President Mike Herman. He
commented that "people have been
% impressed with the comprehensiveness
of the notes," adding that the best
way of determining student reaction
"is to look at how many buy the
notes."
"Student reaction has been pretty
favorable," said Kathy Tuttle, assistant
k director of the service. She said that
r some notes have been sold for classes
that haven't even been given the free
notes.
One student commented, "In some
ways I'd like to take my own notes
because I understand them better. But
U, Physics 51 is too large a class — I can't
always get a seat and therefore I can't
see the board ... The notes are pretty
complete."
Another student who transferred
from UC-Irvine, where he fell in the
habit of buying lecture notes said,
k"I'm not used to taking notes. It's
worth $6."
Classes covered by the service
include Chemistry 33, Physics 23 and
51, Economics 1, Biology 22 and 108,
Psychology 157 and 130 and Human
Biology 3A and 3B.
9 The fees will be used to pay off
debts incurred last quarter, according
to Petroff. These debts include
"advertising, letters, postage, the staff
— operating costs," explained Petroff.
The break-even point for this
quarter will be reached if 70 people

said. "We expect between now and the

end of next week to have a majority of
subscriptions sold," he added.
Lists Filling
The subscription lists "are filling
up," according to Petroff. "There are
an average of 12-15 people on each
list," he added.
With 75 people subscribing, Physics
51 has "paid for itself," according to
Petroff. He explained that it is the
only class so far "that has started on a
subscription basis." Because of a
textbook shortage, the professor
requested that the notes be distributed
in advance to serve as a guide to the
class.
Petroff said that if any class was
"anemic if the subscriptions were
10-15 I would consider canceling
the service for that class and refunding
the money."
His only regret up to this point, he
said, is not including Psychology 60 in
the program. "Students have come up
to me and said notes would be really
good for that class."
Machinery
The service is also working to pay
off $2300 worth of machinery. "We
will not be posting any gains toward

that debt until probably the end of
spring quarter," said Petroff.
According to Herman, the service
agreed to pay for the machinery
"within the next two years." He said
the service is splitting the cost and use
of a mimeograph machine and an
electronic stencilmaker with the ASSU
office.
Herman said that the service will be
"one of the biggest profit makers for
ASSU," adding that extra funding is
greatly needed in light of pending
budget cuts.
