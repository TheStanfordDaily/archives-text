Subscriptions sales for the ASSU
Lecture Note Service have netted over
$900, according to Vic Petroff, the
j service's director.
"We're not even close to being
finished," said Petroff. "I suspect it
will continue until the end of next
week and then taper off." Petroff
added, "Our major concern is getting
good notes to the students. If we do
t that, subscriptions should stay up."
This week, free notes are being
passed out in the 14 classes serviced by
the lecture service "as a way of letting
students see what is going on," said
ASSU President Mike Herman. He
commented that "people have been
% impressed with the comprehensiveness
of the notes," adding that the best
way of determining student reaction
"is to look at how many buy the
notes."
"Student reaction has been pretty
favorable," said Kathy Tuttle, assistant
k director of the service. She said that
r some notes have been sold for classes
that haven't even been given the free
notes.
One student commented, "In some
ways I'd like to take my own notes
because I understand them better. But
U, Physics 51 is too large a class — I can't
always get a seat and therefore I can't
see the board ... The notes are pretty
complete."
Another student who transferred
from UC-Irvine, where he fell in the
habit of buying lecture notes said,
k"I'm not used to taking notes. It's
worth $6."
Classes covered by the service
include Chemistry 33, Physics 23 and
51, Economics 1, Biology 22 and 108,
Psychology 157 and 130 and Human
Biology 3A and 3B.
9 The fees will be used to pay off
debts incurred last quarter, according
to Petroff. These debts include
"advertising, letters, postage, the staff
— operating costs," explained Petroff.
The break-even point for this
quarter will be reached if 70 people

said. "We expect between now and the
