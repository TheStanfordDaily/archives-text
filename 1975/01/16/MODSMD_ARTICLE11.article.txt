# Third World' Action At The U.N.
## 
### Jeffrey Druckman 
Syed Mohammed Tariq's column in the
Jan. 8 Daily ("Third World Upholds U.N.
Tradition") raises a few questions about the
motives of some countries in the U.N.
Tariq attributes the "disenchantment of
some Western powers" to the fact that they
can no longer "manipulate" the U.N. To
which powers is he referring? If he means the
Western European nations in addition to the
U.S., when were the former ever in a position
to control the body? Further, have they ever
been consistently united, or are they now, so
that they could be classified as a "powerful
minority?"
The various Western European nations'
inconsistent voting behavior on issues related
to Israel's culpability in certain
confrontations seems to indicate otherwise.
More significantly, Tariq discovers a
"sense of frustration" on the part of this
perceived "minority" alliance of power. He
ascribes this to "their refusal to come to
terms with the changed reality of the world."
What is this new reality?
The emergence of oil as a coercive
economic weapon?
'Changed Reality?'
No, we are told it is that "the Third World
represents the overwhelming majority of the
world population." Is that a "changed
reality" or simply a long extant fact?
Alas, we are lead beyond the superficial to
the heart of the matter "it is the spirit of
unity in its struggle against colonialism
and .. . international Zionism . . . that has

made the Third World a force."
What is international Zionism? Is it a
conspiracy to spread Zionism throughout
Asia, Africa and Latin America? Should
Botswana be warned that Israel has designs
on her territory? Maybe Tanzanians should
be told to check under their beds for
Zionists.
Let us examine this spirit of unity. The
Arab nations have the wealth, while"'the
Asian and African nations have the need
poverty, famine, illiteracy, natural disasters.
According to 1973 U.N. Statistical Yearbook
(the most recent year available for figures),
no commitments of capital were made from
Arab nations to developing countries.
U.S. Contributions
By contrast, the U.S. contributed $73
million in 1970 and 1971 to African nations
in food and technical assistance programs,
and a total of $718,669,000 from 1955-1971
(1971 Operations Report Agency for
International Development latest
available).
It would seem that if the Third World
countries wanted to lift the yoke of
dependency on Western powers from their
fellow oppressed, they would offer economic
assistance. Apparently this "spirit of unity"
does not extend to matters of finance.
Tariq disposes of the notion that the
"General Assembly was shackled by 'the
tyranny of the majority' " by suggesting an
"impartial study of the voting record of the

current Assembly session." One gets the
impression that the Third World nations
therefore exhibited independence from each
other. Yet Tariq soon admits they took
"united stands" and asks us not to interpret
this as "unthinking group loyalty."
What Motivation?
Perhaps the implication is that one should
accept the U.N. decision to recognize the
Palestinian Liberation Organization as an
across-the-board goal, because some
European nations voted with the Third
World. The obvious question, though, is what
motivated these oil-consuming countries to
so vote?
Just as Tariq claims Third World countries
should "be wary of the. .. force of
persuasion" of the Big Powers, so should the
observer of U.N. proceedings be wary of
another force of persuasion (oil) and its
ramifications.
Finally, we learn that the real motive of
the Third World is to "see the laudable
objects of the U.N. Charter . . . translated
into reality." Has anyone read this document
lately? The very first sentence reaffirms
"faith in fundamental human rights and in
the dignity and worth of the human person."
Are these the kind of ideals being
translated into reality when the leader of a
group of self-proclaimed murderers is cheered
on the floor of the U.N., while exhibiting a
gun and spewing out threats of annihilation?
