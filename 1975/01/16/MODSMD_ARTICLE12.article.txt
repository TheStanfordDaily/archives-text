# We Need The Men Who Said 'No'
## 
### Terrence Kenny 
As the Jan. 31,1975, deadline
for President Ford's earned
re-entry clemency program
approaches, the Stanford
Amnesty Coalition (SAC) will be
sponsoring several lectures,
debates and other presentations in
an effort to encourage discussion
of and action toward a universal
and unconditional amnesty for
U.S. war resisters.
The President's offer of
conditional clemency has met
with an extremely poor response,
only a small number of those
eligible under various headings
applying for a clemency decision.
These men are being asked to
admit wrongdoing, and to accept
what amounts to a two year
paroled status performing
government designated tasks, for
having followed their consciences
in opposing an unjust war effort
on the part of the U.S.

government.
The present clemency program
spares the government from
taking the large and embarassing
step of admitting that a relatively
small number of courageous men
were right in having said no to the
Johnson and Nixon
administrations. The war in
Vietnam continues, supported by
U.S. arms and dollars.
This country needs the minds,
the voices, of those men who said
no. The Ford Administration will
not take that large step unless
pressured by a large number of
Americans.
In recognition of this, the SAC
will cosponsor two lectures this
week. On Friday, Jan. 17 at 7p.m.
in Bishop Auditorium, Don Luce
will speak about his recent trip to
North Vietnam with a delegation
from Clergy and Laity Concerned.

He will focus on the continuing
war in Vietnam and the
relationship between United
States action in Asia and the need
for amnesty at home.
Luce is well-known to Stanford
students as a speaker, journalist
and voice for peace. He is an
expert in Vietnamese affairs,
perhaps best known for his
discovery and denunciation of
South Vietnam's "tiger cages."
His lecture is co-sponsored by the
SAC, the Committee to Invite
Nguyen Huu Thai to Stanford and
Stanford Memorial Church.
On Saturday, Jan. 18, at 8 pm
in Memorial Church, David Harris,
former ASSU president, radical
activist and critic of American
society, will present his views on
the issue of amnesty. Joining him
will be Jeanne Friedman, member
of the National Council for a
Universal and Unconditional

Amnesty and representative of the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
Winter Soldiers Organization,
who will discuss the shortcomings
of President Ford's clemency
program. Both lectures are free.
We ask all members of the
Stanford Community to take part
in our concern for men of
conscience, by attending these
two presentations and the others
which will be occurring in the
next couple of weeks, but more
importantly by writing your
senators, congressmen and
President Ford, urging them to
declare an unconditional amnesty
for all draft resisters and deserters.
Do not allow this forced exile of
exceptional men to fade into an
uncomfortable memory.

week. On Friday, Jan. 17 at 7p.m.
in Bishop Auditorium, Don Luce
will speak about his recent trip to
North Vietnam with a delegation
from Clergy and Laity Concerned.

He will focus on the continuing
war in Vietnam and the
relationship between United
States action in Asia and the need
for amnesty at home.
Luce is well-known to Stanford
students as a speaker, journalist
and voice for peace. He is an
expert in Vietnamese affairs,
perhaps best known for his
discovery and denunciation of
South Vietnam's "tiger cages."
His lecture is co-sponsored by the
SAC, the Committee to Invite
Nguyen Huu Thai to Stanford and
Stanford Memorial Church.
On Saturday, Jan. 18, at 8 pm
in Memorial Church, David Harris,
former ASSU president, radical
activist and critic of American
society, will present his views on
the issue of amnesty. Joining him
will be Jeanne Friedman, member
of the National Council for a
Universal and Unconditional

Amnesty and representative of the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
Winter Soldiers Organization,
who will discuss the shortcomings
of President Ford's clemency
program. Both lectures are free.
We ask all members of the
Stanford Community to take part
in our concern for men of
conscience, by attending these
two presentations and the others
which will be occurring in the
next couple of weeks, but more
importantly by writing your
senators, congressmen and
President Ford, urging them to
declare an unconditional amnesty
for all draft resisters and deserters.
Do not allow this forced exile of
exceptional men to fade into an
uncomfortable memory.

undergraduate and a member of
the Stanford Amnesty Coalition.)
As the Jan. 31,1975, deadline
for President Ford's earned
re-entry clemency program
approaches, the Stanford
Amnesty Coalition (SAC) will be
sponsoring several lectures,
debates and other presentations in
an effort to encourage discussion
of and action toward a universal
and unconditional amnesty for
U.S. war resisters.
The President's offer of
conditional clemency has met
with an extremely poor response,
only a small number of those
eligible under various headings
applying for a clemency decision.
These men are being asked to
admit wrongdoing, and to accept
what amounts to a two year
paroled status performing
government designated tasks, for
having followed their consciences
in opposing an unjust war effort
on the part of the U.S.

government.
The present clemency program
spares the government from
taking the large and embarassing
step of admitting that a relatively
small number of courageous men
were right in having said no to the
Johnson and Nixon
administrations. The war in
Vietnam continues, supported by
U.S. arms and dollars.
This country needs the minds,
the voices, of those men who said
no. The Ford Administration will
not take that large step unless
pressured by a large number of
Americans.
In recognition of this, the SAC
will cosponsor two lectures this
week. On Friday, Jan. 17 at 7p.m.
