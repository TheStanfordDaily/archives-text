# OK, Smokers, Let's Make A Deal!
## 
### Azike Ntephe 
The Surgeon General has determined that
cigarette smoking is dangerous to your
health!
Those who smoke are already aware of
this warning by the chief medical officer of
the U.S. Public Health Service.
I am not the Surgeon General and know
nothing about smoking and your health.
Even if I do, like the medical officer, I can
only advise and not deter you from smoking.
My first principle is and has always been
tolerance. If anyone wants to gamble with his
health (admitting the Surgeon General is
right,) I can only be sorry but I have no right
to object.
That is, I have no right to object unless it
bothers me. Smoking bothers me especially
when confined in seminar rooms (such as
Building 420 Room 147) with little or no
ventilation.
I have tried to live up to my principle of
being tolerant. This, however, is a free
country and everyone is said to have a right
to be heard.
Can I exercise my right by raising some

objective objections? I cannot deny the rights
of smokers (student and faculty alike) to
smoke in air-tight seminar rooms. On the
other hand, I cannot deny the non-classroom
smokers their rights to a fair share of smoggy
but smokeless rooms.
If I were Monty Hall, I would have said,
"Let's make a deal." I am not, but I am going
to say it anyway. There ought to be a
compromise between the rights of smokers
and that of non-smokers.
The first deal that comes to mind is the
smoking and non-smoking compartments in
planes and trains. To have this type of
division would be tedious and expensive. An
alternative would be for the administration
(with the blessing of the Fire Chief) to
declare all classrooms non-smoking. But for a
people who believe in their constitutional
rights, this would be a denial of such rights. I
would hesitate to recommend it.
Our Constitution works because it
upholds the freedom of the individual. But
the individual is free to the extent his
freedom does not interfer with that of

others. Our constitution works because this is
a democracy. And one of the facets of
democracy is that the rights of the majority
must prevail in most issues.
Since one out of every five people smokes
in classrooms, I think a more democratic,
more mature approach, would be for the
smoking minority to abstain from smoking in
class that is for at least 50 minutes, at most
120. This compromise would allow those
who cannot do without smoking within the
period to step out for a puff without making
others uncomfortable.
Can we make a deal? For just a couple of
hours, at most?
