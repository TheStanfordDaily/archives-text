# Egypt A Nuclear Risk
## 
### M. Waterman 
The U.S. is apparently willing
to follow through on its promise
to offer to sell Egypt a nuclear
power plant.
Former President Nixon's
announcement of that offer
during his July "hegira" to the
Middle East had evoked some
controversy on the propriety of
such action. This controversy was
centered primarily on two points.
First, because of the volatile
military-political environment in
the Middle East it was feared that
Egypt might decide to convert its
peaceful nuclear capability to
military purposes.
Secondly, the memory of
India's detonation of a nuclear
device was but two months old.
The Indians had been receiving
nuclear assistance intended for
peaceful uses from Canada since
1956.
In response to these fears, the
Joint Congressional Committee on
Atomic Energy passed a
resolution shortly after Nixon's
visit which would subject future
nuclear aid programs to
Congressional approval. But a
State Department spokesman
recently announced that the U.S.
was still prepared to sell Egypt an
atomic reactor.
The appropriateness of the
Egyptian offer is certainly open to
question on both technical and
political grounds. To begin with,
the process of diverting the
peaceful atom to the military
atom is not an insuperable one for
a country which has such a
diversion as a political objective.
Chief Technical Obstacle
The chief technical obstacle to
developing an atomic bomb is
coming into possession of one of
the fissionable materials,
plutonium or uranium-235, which
are used in nuclear weapons.
Quite unfortunately, it is these
same two materials that are the
essential ingredients in the civilian
nuclear fuel cycle which produces
electricity.
While the quality of these two
substances employed in today's
power plants is not sufficient to
produce a dependable A-bomb,
inexpensive refinement
technology is being rapidly
developed and dispersed around
the world. India developed the
plutonium enrichment technology
it needed to construct a bomb
independently of Canada.
Thus from a technical
standpoint, the possibility of
Egypt developing its own nuclear
force is not difficult to envision.
Many small powers could have a
nuclear weapon potential in a
short time if they so chose.
It is strongly suspected that
Israel presently possesses a
nuclear-weapon capability. Israel
has purportedly rejected the U.S.
offer of a companion sale of an
atomic power plant because it is
unwilling to bare existing atomic
facilities at Dimona, built with
French assistance, to international
inspection. All three countries,
India, Egypt and Israel, have, as
yet, failed to sign the 1970 Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons.
'Stringent Safeguards'
It is true that Egypt would
have to accept stringent U.S.
safeguards in addition to
international inspection. However
it must be realized that at any
moment, the Egyptians could
decide to suspend such
monitoring by an act of national
will and proceed with a military
diversion of its nuclear power
capability. With the possibility of
an Israeli nuclear force Egypt may
be induced to achieve some degree
of nuclear parity with its
neighboring foe. '
Setting aside all such
conjectures, it is certainly unwise
to assist the nuclear development
of a nation which has engaged in
war four times over the last thirty
years and lies in the middle of the
most intense political struggle of 1
today's world.
Whatever quid, pro quo
arrangement the U.S. had "in mind
when it made its nuclear offer is
not clear. Kissinger-Nixon inspired
foreign policies have rarely been
characterized by their *
munificence. If the offer was
made with the intention of
improving U.S.-Egyptian relations
and furthering peace in the Middle
East, then these gains are no
longer visible. U.S.-Egyptian
relations have cooled considerably 4
since the Nixon trip and talk of
war in the Middle East is now
centered on when, not whether, it
will occur.
What is clear is that the U.S. is
taking an unnecessary risk in
offering nuclear technology to 4
Egypt at this time.
