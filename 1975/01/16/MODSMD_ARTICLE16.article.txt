## World Campus Afloat Offers Students Learning Experiences In Every Port 
### STEVE HEFTER 
At 19 I had never seen the
world. I had been stuffed into a
series of four-walled classrooms
with four-eyed professors
lecturing about people and places
I had never seen.
I Wanted to travel but knew I
should stay in school. I was just
the instrument doing the work.
Why? Because it \vas there.
Then came World Campus
Afloat.
That's one student's reaction
to World Campus Afloat, a
university with the world as the
classroom.
Classes. are taught aboard an
18,000 ton ocean liner which
circumnavigates the globe,
bringing students direct
knowledge from ports around the
world.
It is not four months in
Beulelsbach, Florence, Tours
Clivedon or Palo Alto. It is a
chance to see all sides of the
world aboard a ship equipped
with classrooms, a 200-seat
theater, library, bookstore,
swimming pool, cafeteria, student
union, basketball and volleyball
courts and a 3 to 1 ratio of
females to males.
Classes range from
oceanography to Asian art
history, with lots of variety in
between. They're taught by
visiting professors from U.S.
universities, and supplemented
with lectures by distinguished
professors and statesmen from
countries around the globe.
Between Hong Kong and
Indonesia, for instance, Sutan
Takir Alisjhabana, "the architect
of the Indonesian language,"
spoke about the restructurization
of philosophical thinking on the
basis of new value concepts free
from any kind of dogmatism.

The professors and their
families live, eat, dance and even
drink with students at the bar
which remains open day and
night. With the student union as
the central meeting place,
students 550 from all 50 states
get to know professors and each
other on an informal basis.
The cost of the semester
program which is available to
Stanford students is the same as
two Stanford quarters. By taking
20 units aboard ship 30 quarter
units can be granted to a Stanford

student.
The program also accepts
graduate students, post-graduates,
and adults.
The ship's 200-men crew is
Chinese. In Taiwain, many
students were invited to the
homes of crew members or were
free to venture off on their own.
As is the case in every port
students also have the option of
attending school planned
activities such as a geology climb
up Table Mountain in South
Africa or a performance of

Kabuki theater in Japan.
Optional trips are available for
an additional fee, East African
safaris or tours including the Taj
Mahal in India.
Chapman College, which runs
the program, sets up fairly flexible
entrance requirements and
Stanford students should have no
difficulty getting accepted to the
program. An organizational
meeting will be held Monday at 5
p.m. in the Twain East lounge for
interested students.
As a veteran of last Spring's
voyage I remember nights aboard
ship where an early swim was
followed by a quiet stroll along
the deck and then a night's sleep
on the top deck beneath every
star in the universe.

Editor's note: Steve Hefter spent
one year aboard World Campus
Afloat. His personal experiences
provided the basis for both

As a veteran of last Spring's

followed by a quiet stroll along
the deck and then a night's sleep
on the top deck beneath every
star in the universe.

LAND WITHOUT HOPE—The brittle bones of an old man, the
hunger-swollen belly of a child one World Campus Afloat student
witnessed hunger and death in Bangladesh. But the program with a
campus in every port offers participants a glimpse of the world's
beauty as well as its horror.
At 19 I had never seen the
world. I had been stuffed into a
series of four-walled classrooms
with four-eyed professors
lecturing about people and places
I had never seen.
I Wanted to travel but knew I
should stay in school. I was just
the instrument doing the work.
Why? Because it \vas there.
Then came World Campus
Afloat.
That's one student's reaction
to World Campus Afloat, a
university with the world as the
classroom.
Classes. are taught aboard an
18,000 ton ocean liner which
circumnavigates the globe,
bringing students direct
knowledge from ports around the
world.
It is not four months in
Beulelsbach, Florence, Tours
Clivedon or Palo Alto. It is a
chance to see all sides of the
world aboard a ship equipped
with classrooms, a 200-seat
theater, library, bookstore,
swimming pool, cafeteria, student
union, basketball and volleyball
courts and a 3 to 1 ratio of
females to males.
Classes range from
oceanography to Asian art
history, with lots of variety in
between. They're taught by
visiting professors from U.S.
universities, and supplemented
with lectures by distinguished
professors and statesmen from
countries around the globe.
Between Hong Kong and
Indonesia, for instance, Sutan
Takir Alisjhabana, "the architect
of the Indonesian language,"
spoke about the restructurization
of philosophical thinking on the
basis of new value concepts free
from any kind of dogmatism.

The professors and their
families live, eat, dance and even
drink with students at the bar
which remains open day and
night. With the student union as
the central meeting place,
students 550 from all 50 states
get to know professors and each
other on an informal basis.
The cost of the semester
program which is available to
Stanford students is the same as
two Stanford quarters. By taking
20 units aboard ship 30 quarter
units can be granted to a Stanford

student.
The program also accepts
graduate students, post-graduates,
and adults.
The ship's 200-men crew is
Chinese. In Taiwain, many
students were invited to the
homes of crew members or were
free to venture off on their own.
As is the case in every port
students also have the option of
attending school planned
activities such as a geology climb
up Table Mountain in South
Africa or a performance of

Kabuki theater in Japan.
Optional trips are available for
an additional fee, East African
safaris or tours including the Taj
Mahal in India.
Chapman College, which runs
the program, sets up fairly flexible
entrance requirements and
Stanford students should have no
difficulty getting accepted to the
program. An organizational
meeting will be held Monday at 5
p.m. in the Twain East lounge for
interested students.
