Okay, Bug Me did a pretty funny job on Phi
Beta Kappa in Tuesday's paper. But if you people
are really any good, answer this: the other night I
saw an absolutely horrible old movie entitled The
Terror, with Boris Karloff and, of all people, Jack
Nicholson. The question is how did Nicholson ever
get mixed up in such a stupid, third-rate horror
~movie?—D.P;
The Terror was made by American International
Pictures in 1963 when Nicholson was still pretty
small in movies. And this is one of the smallest—
director Roger Corman actually made it in three
days.
It seems he had Boris Karloff under contract for
another picture and finished it three days early.
And Corman, never one to waste time or money,
decided to take advantage of the spare days. He had
an assistant write a script over night, and the
picture was filmed on the sets still standing from
the other movie. In three days.

Nicholson, who got his first good reviews for
Easy Rider (1969), didn't exactly win raves for his
performance as a deserter from Napoleon's army
who gets mixed up with witches, lunatics, and a
hawk that eats people's eyes.

If the purpose of "rotation " in the schedule for
pre-reg is to ensure fairness in being able to sign
class lists, why is it that some letters, for instance
LMNO, are never at the bottom, while others, like
ABCD, are there for two quarters?—G.W.C.
You're too paranoid. Look carefully at the Time
Schedules for the last four quarters. The summer
schedule begins with S-Z, the fall with A-B, the
winter with E-G, and the spring with L-M.
This means that no matter what your name
begins with you pre-register first or second at least
once, near the bottom at least once, and
somewhere in the middle the other two times.
