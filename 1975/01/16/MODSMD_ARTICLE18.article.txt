# Student Views Death In Bangladesh
## 
### STEVE HEFTER 
As my days pass in the crowded market
of this world and my hands grow full with
the daily profits let me ever feel that I
have gained nothing let me not forget for
a moment let me carry the pangs of this
sorrow in my dreams and in my wakeful
hours.
â€”Rabinbindranath Tagore
I walked by the hungry faces and
disease-swelled bellies of the children in
Bangladesh. I tried to make them smile but
they would not; they had nothing to smile
about.
Flesh clinging desperately to bone, empty
eyes of brown staring into dark clouds hung
low overhead it would soon rain again and
more of the precious crops would be washed
away.
In the capital city of Dacca, burnt-out
buildings corroded from the war and bare
concrete columns lined rooftops like stalks
of some strange growth.
For two weeks I walked alone among the
starving millions in Bangladesh. I had left
World Campus Afloat in Sri Lanka and
would rejoin it three weeks later in Bombay.
UNICEF officials informed me that 83

percent of the population is illiterate. They
told me that the country is the size of
Wisconsin and by the year 2000 will have
over 170 million people. And they told me
that foreign food aid is decreasing.
They didn't need to say a thing. The
absence of laughter was loud enough. The
dead infant on the river bank in Faridpur
said it all. Only the faint smell of mutton
broiled on a skewer before an open fire culd
bring back any hope. But even then, the
monsoons would surely fall again.
Schools in Bangladesh spend less than $4
per year on a child's education. The children
do little more than stare at each other's
protruding stomachs or dream of the rice
they might eat tomorrow. But they don't
play. And they can't learn.
On my last night in Bangladesh, I slept on
a wooden board in a cramped room at the
University of Dacca. Rahman, a 23 year-old
Dacca student lay near me on the floor.
At 4 a.m. a rumbling of voices rose from
the outside corridor. I knocked over the
clock as I reached for my jeans but grabbed
only old kleenex and hurled it across the
room.
We rushed outside to the corridor that
overhung the grassless courtyard. From all

directions, barefoot and undressed students
ran to the overhang to see what had
happened.
They watched.
They watched and refused to watch as
seven fellow students were dragged through
the dirt at gunpoint by fifty masked
assailants.
We ran down the corridor to the edge of a
stairway. Plaster hung from the musty grey
walls as we hurried down, the wooden steps.
We reached the first floor and made a
right and heard a shot. And then another.
And another.
Down two black corridors we ran. And
then we stopped. On the floor, a pool of
blood swam around the seven dead students.
They had been friends of Rahman's. They
all opposed the corrupt government officials
who smuggled portions of Bangladesh's small
harvest into India for personal profit. It was
this opposition which prompted the murder.
I left Rahman that same day and walked
through the downpour towards the market
section of Dacca. For mile after mile I heard
thunder and saw broken glass. I breathed
death and ate fish bones. The faces of the
seven dead students and the faces of the
hungry merged together in my mind like rain
with wet mud.
