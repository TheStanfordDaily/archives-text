# ASSU Senate Funds Parking Boycott
## 
### MARK LICKER FRANK MARKOWITZ 
The ASSU Senate voted last night
to allocate $2OOO for the Escondido
Village Legal Fund to oppose
University parking fees. The resolution
followed a presentation by Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri of the
quarterly financial report which shows
the ASSU holding investments and
interest of $944,640.14 as of Jan. 2,
1975.
Seeking support for the Escondido
Village boycott of "parking fees,
Escondido Village Council President
Kathy Colson claimed that last year
approximately 5000 faculty and staff
received 10,000 free parking stickers.
Amidst complaints by ASSU Sen.
Peter Winsemius that the University
unfairly discriminates against students,
the Senate voted $5OO of its
Discretionary Fund, and $l5OO from
the ASSU Bail Fund to the Escondido
boycott fund.
Boycott Funding
Colson appeared at the Senate
meeting after the Escondido Village
Council last night allocated "up to
$1000" to pay legal fees and fines
resulting from its boycott of the $7.50
parking fee.
Part of the funds may be used to
reimburse Village residents cited for
not displaying the sticker on their cars
after Jan. 29, as required by the
Department of Police Services.
Although vehicle registration fees go
into the University general funds, fines
are paid to Santa Clara County.
At the Escondido meeting, Colson
said she has consulted three lawyers
about the possibility of a class action
suit against the University.
Illegal Fee?
She maintained the fee is illegal
because Escondido residents already
pay for road maintenance, fire and
police services and other traffic-related
expenses of the University in their
rent. Colson suggested that residents
who are fined have the option of

either paying the fine with ASSU
funds or appealing the fine.
Sen. Bill Hoke called University
parking levies "taxation without
representation," asking "are we so
subservient that when the University
says 'jump' or 'pay', we do it?"
He was referring to a letter from
University Vice President for Business
and Finance Robert Augsburger to the
ASSU Senate which called the fee
"comparable to a tax." Winsemsius
praised Augsburger for his candor.
'Mistake'
Hoke said it is "a bad mistake to set
up a bail fund." The [parking
fees]simply shouldn't be paid."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape said that if parking fees are
continued, "I think the same reasoning
[of a user's fee] will be applied
towards faculty and staff in the
future." Snape added "I don't think
anyone in the Administration is that
happy about the situation."
The possibility of an injunction
against the University was also
discussed. Hoke criticized
Augsburger's statement that an
analogy could be drawn between
parking fees and tuition because
neither can be tied to specific benefits.
"Students will begin to consider
themselves as clients of an institution,
and expect upgrading of services. They
are going to see their bills going up,
and services going down," Hoke said.
Finances
Olivieri's financial report showed
that ASSU holds $921,749.64 in
principal and $22,890.50 in interest.
The money is in treasury notes,
bankers' acceptances and certificates
of deposit, obtained through Wells
Fargo Bank.
One of the most profitable
operations, ASSU Special Events,
earned $33,788.62 over summer and
autumn 1974. The ASSU Travel
Service showed an autumn profit of
$18,128.29, and the Typesetting Shop

ran $4866 in the black for the sam
period, the report said.
A report by the Finance Committee
on the feasibility of further ASSU
fund investment was also presented to
the Senate.
The committee suggested that
investing ASSU monies in common
and preferred stocks and bonds could
allow use of capital gains and interest
above that required to replenish the
original capital reduced by inflation.
Proposal Backed
Committee Chairwoman Maria
Echaveste defended the proposal on
grounds of possible reduction of

University funds to ASSU and the
present investment of ASSU funds.
An advisory board composed of
Business School professors, University
finance officers and ASSU Senate
members was also proposed, to
approve any specific investments. No
action was taken on the report
pending written submission.
In other action the Senate passed a
resolution urging the University
Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation (CAPER) to
gather student opinion on cutbacks of
athletic and club sports programs.

LULLEDâ€”ASSU Sen. Peter Winsemius seems to have hit a slow spot during
debates at last night's marathon Senate meeting. Later, Winsemius spoke against
the University's plan to begin enforcement in earnest of a rule requiring students
to purchase a $7.50 parking sticker.
