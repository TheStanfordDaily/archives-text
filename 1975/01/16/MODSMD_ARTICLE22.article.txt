CIA Admits Domestic Spying

WASHINGTON The Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) acknowledged for the first time
yesterday that its agents infiltrated dissident groups
inside the United States and established files on
about 10,000 U.S. citizens.
But Director William E. Colby told senators he
flatly denies "the press allegation that CIA engaged
in a 'massive illegal domestic intelligence
operation.'
"Whether we strayed over the edge of our
authority on a few occasions over the past 27 years
is a question for those authorized to investigate
those matters to judge," Colby said.
The Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
intelligence operations cross-examined Colby and
former CIA Director Richard Helms for more than
three hours in a closed-door session. It then
recommended unanimously the immediate start of a
full and in-depth probe of all allegations against the
spy agency.
Meanwhile, Atty. Gen. William B. Saxbe called
for a high-level inquiry to determine whether the
nation gets its money's worth from the Central
Intelligence Agency and other government spy
operations.
President Ford and Congress should launch a
wide-ranging joint investigation focusing on the
effectiveness of all intelligence agencies rather than
on recent charges that the CIA has conducted illegal
domestic operations, Saxbe suggested.
Wholesale Prices Drop Sharply
WASHINGTON Wholesale prices plunged
sharply in December, marking the first decline in 14
months, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
The government's Wholesale Price Index fell
five-tenths of one percent as declining farm and
food prices more than offset a slight increase in
industrial commodities.
Despite last month's drop, wholesale prices for
all of 1974 soared 20.9 percent, the most in any
year since prices rose 31.1 percent in 1946 when
World War II price controls ended.
The report came as President Ford presented
Congress with economic proposals designed to shift
the administration's focus from fighting inflation to
combating recession and energy problems.
Government analysts said the December price
decline the first since wholesale prices dropped
one-tenth of a percent in October 1973 reflected
both an easing of the nation's high inflation rate and
the spreading effect of the recession.
Wholesale prices have moderated in recent
months, and the trend is expected to be reflected at
retail in the coming months, particularly in the
non-food area.
Democrats May Oust 2 Leaders
WASHINGTON A House Democratic panel
recommended dumping two committee chairmen
yesterday, including Rep. Wright Patman (D-Texas)
in what one Democrat called a revolution against
the seniority system.
By identical 13 to 11 votes, the Steering and
Policy Committee recommended deposing Patman
as chairman of the House Banking and Currency
Committee and Rep. Wayne Hays (D-Ohio) as
chairman of the House Administration Committee.
The panel's recommendations will be voted on

today by the full caucus. The caucus is considered
by many observers to be more liberal than the
steering committee.
The committee nominated Rep. Henry Reuss
(D-Wis.) to succeed Patman and Rep. Frank
Thompson (D-N.J.) to replace Hays.
Ford Suggests Fuel Bill Rise
WASHINGTON President Ford proposed
policies yesterday to increase the average family's
fuel bills about $250 a year, a 26 percent increase,
to discourage energy use.
Ford proposed to return the added energy costs,
some $3O billion a year, to the public through
payments and tax credits. But economic adviser
William Seidman said the proposals would "change
the center of gravity of spending" away from
unnecessary energy purchases.
Ford promised new oil import fees within three
months that would increase the price of gasoline and
other petroleum fuels about 5 cents per gallon, and
proposed oil excise taxes and free-market pricing
that would add another 5-cent price hike.
He proposed to raise natural gas prices by ending
federal regulation and by imposing an excise tax of
37 cents per thousand cubic feet.
Congress Reacts To Ford Speech
WASHINGTON President Ford's proposal to
cut taxes won quick support from members of
Congress yesterday but they were less enthusiastic
about his gas price increase and his vow against new
spending.
"My thought is that we will pass the tax cut at
about the amount the President is recommending,"
said Senate Finance Chairman Russell Long (D-La.).
"But we'll probably couple it with amendments to
put the cut on the poor."
Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.) said he is pleased
Ford is abandoning the voluntary WIN program but
doesn't like the idea of allowing crude oil prices to
rise and natural gas to become unregulated.
"That's going to have a tremendous inflationary
impact upon the economy it will probably cause
two percent inflation all by itself, and I just can't
agree with that," Tunney said.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said he thinks
Ford's attempts to reduce fuel consumption by
inflating gasoline prices will prove harmful to people
in the lower income brackets. Cranston also
suggested using a sliding scale on the tax rebate, so
that the poor would get more money back than the
wealthy.
Soviet Trade Rebuff Played Down
WASHINGTON Soviet rejection of U.S. trade
terms was brushed off yesterday by key senators,
who promised to continue the fight to tie trade
concessions to free emigration of Russian Jews.
"We in the Congress remain committed to the
view that a broadening of trade relations must be
accompanied by progress in the area of human
rights," Senators Henry M. Jackson (D-Wash.) and
Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.) said in a joint statement.
Meanwhile, President Ford referred in his State
of the Union speech to restrictions written into the
newly passed Trade Reform Act.
"The conduct of negotiations is ill-suited to such
limitations," Ford said. "Legislative restrictions,
intended for the best motives and purposes, can
have the opposite results, as we have seen most

recently in our trade relations with the Soviet
Union."
In Jerusalem, Israeli Information Minister
Aharon Yariv told Parliament that the collapse of
the agreement could "have a negative effect on
emigration from the Soviet Union." But he said
Israel would continue its struggle for free Jewish
emigration by appealing to other governments and
international organizations and staging protests.
Court Rules On Education Act
SAN FRANCISCO The California Supreme
Court yesterday declared unconstitutional part of a
1972 initiativeâ€”Prop. 21 which bars the
assignment of students to schools on the basis of
race.
But it held valid other provisions of the initiative
which repealed sections of the state Education Code
declaring a state policy of eliminating racial
imbalance and providing guidelines for achieving
racial balance.
The 64-page unanimous decision said the
repealed code sections went beyond the
constitutional mandate.
It rejected the contention that passage of Prop.
21 constituted such state involvement in racial
discrimination as to require its complete
invalidation as a violation of the 14th Amendment.
The court said the remaining portions of the
proposition could be interpreted as expressing the
peoples' preference for a neighborhood school
policy.
Cambodian Rebels Tighten Noose'
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Communist-led
rebels tightened their noose around Neak Luong
yesterday, heavily shelling the besieged Mekong
River town, sinking a barge carrying much needed
ammunition and forcing a seven-ship convoy to
return to South Vietnamese waters under
machine-gun fire, military sources reported.
Casualties were not immediately known.
Khmer Rouge guns now dominate more than 40
miles of the Mekong channel to Phnom Penh. No
supply convoys from Saigon have come up the river
for 26 days.
Neak Luong, a naval base town on the river 32
miles southeast of Phnom Penh, has been under
siege since New Year's Eve.
Martin Luther King Center Opens
ATLANTA, Ga. With the turn of a spade of
earth, Coretta Scott King broke ground for the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social Change
yesterday the day that would have been King's
46th birthday.
Standing in bright sunlight amid a crowd of
several thousand persons, Mrs. King said the center
is "of great moral value for the nation."
Mrs. King established the Center her dream for
her husband's legacy soon after the civil rights
leader was slain in April 1968. Its purpose is to
teach nonviolence, she said.'
