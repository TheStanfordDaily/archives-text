# Grading Report Awaits Student, Faculty Input
## 
### 
The Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA)
yesterday decided to delay action on
approving a final report on the grading
system here until students and faculty
are given a chance to respond to their
preliminary report.
The C-AAA will make "no
decisions until February," probably
not until the middle of the month,
according to Physics Prof. Alexander
Fetter, committee chairman.
The preliminary report, which
recommended a reinstatement of a
deadline for dropping classes, will be
printed in its entirety in the Daily for
general response, he noted.
"We're going to invite written
comments," from faculty and
students, said Fetter. These comments
will be considered before any further
decisions are made.
Registrar Sally Mahoney said that
the published report will contain
several appendices which give different
perspectives on the committee report.
One appendix is a summary of a
survey of faculty, students and deans
of the graduate professional schools
here.
The others are brief "working
papers," she said, which present
minority and majority opinions" on
the committee report.
Written responses to the report will
be accepted until Feb. 5. They should
be sent or given to Sandra Traversa,
secretary of the C-AAA, in room 131
of the Old Union.
