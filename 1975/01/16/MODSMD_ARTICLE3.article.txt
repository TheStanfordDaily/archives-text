# State Of Union Address: National Outlook Bleak
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford submitted the bleakest State of
the Union message in decades
yesterday to a somber Congress that
received with reservations his
proposals for tax cuts and higher fuel
costs.
"The State of the Union is not
good ... I've got bad news and I don't
expect applause," Ford told a
nationally broadcast joint session of
Congress.
He got, in fact, less applause than a
president usually does on such
occasions nine interruptions in a
41-minute speech, with most of the
clapping on the Republican side. There
was no audible Democratic approval of
his pledge to veto "any new spending
program adopted by the Congress."
Ford prefaced his proposals with a
grim picture of the economy.
"Millions of Americans are out of
work. Recession and inflation are
eroding the money of millions more.
Prices are too high and sales are too
slow."
'New Partnership'
He called for a "new partnership"
with the Democratic Congress as he
outlined details of the recovery plan
he had sketched in a broadcast address
Monday night.

The major elements of Ford's plan:
—A one-shot tax cut for individuals
totaling $l2 billion and a longer term
tax reduction of $16.5 billion. The
one-time tax cut of 12 percent would
be based on last year's taxes and
would be accomplished through
rebates of up to $l,OOO to individual
taxpayers.
—The long-term tax reduction
would be carried out during 1975
through reduced withholding, with the
largest cuts going to low-income
individuals.
Tax Break
—A quick $4 billion tax break for
industry by raising the investment tax
credit to 12 percent. This would be
coupled with a $6 billion per year cut
in the corporate tax rate.
—A broad-ranging series of taxes
and levies on oil and natural gas
intended to increase prices and thus
reduce consumption. The $3O billion
in revenues raised would be channeled
back into the economy, mainly
through the tax cuts.
—A federal budget that will contain
a deficit of about $3O billion this year
and more than $45 billion for next
year, sending the national debt above
$5OO billion.
"The emphasis of our economic

efforts must now shift from inflation
to jobs," Ford said in his first State of
the Union message.
"Progress and solutions can be
achieved," he added. "And they will
be achieved."
White House officials, briefing
newsmen in advance of Ford's address,
acknowledged the proposed fuel taxes
would cause a one-time two percent
increase in the consumer price index.
The levies on crude oil will translate
into a 10 cent per gallon increase in
retail gasoline prices, the officials
estimated.
Action Needed
In his midday appearance yesterday
in the crowded House chamber, Ford
called for congressional action by
April 1 on his cash rebate plan.
He also proposed direct payments
of $BO to every person 18 years of age
and older whose incomes are so small
they don't file tax returns. And he said
an additional $2 billion would be given
cities and states through revenue
sharing.
Ford asked for standby authority
to ration gasoline if higher costs fail to
meet his goal of cutting oil imports by
a million barrels a day this year and
two million in 1976. But he told
Congress he had rejected rationing for
now because it "would produce
unacceptable inequities."
As part of his energy plan, Ford
urged quick legislation to allow
commercial production at the Elk
Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in
California.
AFL-CIO chief George Meany
denounced President Ford's economic
proposals and said organized labor will
fight them in Congress. The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce promised to do
what it can to help achieve Ford's
objectives.
Meany called Ford's plan to
stimulate the economy with tax cuts
and higher oil prices "clearly
unsupportable," saying it will fuel
inflation and do nothing to curb
recession.

stimulate the economy with tax cuts
and higher oil prices "clearly
unsupportable," saying it will fuel
inflation and do nothing to curb
recession.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford submitted the bleakest State of
the Union message in decades
yesterday to a somber Congress that
received with reservations his
proposals for tax cuts and higher fuel
costs.
"The State of the Union is not
good ... I've got bad news and I don't
expect applause," Ford told a
nationally broadcast joint session of
Congress.
He got, in fact, less applause than a
president usually does on such
occasions nine interruptions in a
41-minute speech, with most of the
clapping on the Republican side. There
was no audible Democratic approval of
his pledge to veto "any new spending
program adopted by the Congress."
Ford prefaced his proposals with a
grim picture of the economy.
"Millions of Americans are out of
work. Recession and inflation are
eroding the money of millions more.
Prices are too high and sales are too
slow."
'New Partnership'
He called for a "new partnership"
with the Democratic Congress as he
outlined details of the recovery plan
he had sketched in a broadcast address
Monday night.

The major elements of Ford's plan:
—A one-shot tax cut for individuals
totaling $l2 billion and a longer term
tax reduction of $16.5 billion. The
one-time tax cut of 12 percent would
be based on last year's taxes and
would be accomplished through
rebates of up to $l,OOO to individual
taxpayers.
—The long-term tax reduction
would be carried out during 1975
through reduced withholding, with the
largest cuts going to low-income
individuals.
Tax Break
—A quick $4 billion tax break for
industry by raising the investment tax
credit to 12 percent. This would be
coupled with a $6 billion per year cut
in the corporate tax rate.
—A broad-ranging series of taxes
and levies on oil and natural gas
intended to increase prices and thus
reduce consumption. The $3O billion
in revenues raised would be channeled
back into the economy, mainly
through the tax cuts.
—A federal budget that will contain
a deficit of about $3O billion this year
and more than $45 billion for next
year, sending the national debt above
$5OO billion.
"The emphasis of our economic

efforts must now shift from inflation
to jobs," Ford said in his first State of
the Union message.
"Progress and solutions can be
achieved," he added. "And they will
be achieved."
White House officials, briefing
newsmen in advance of Ford's address,
acknowledged the proposed fuel taxes
would cause a one-time two percent
increase in the consumer price index.
The levies on crude oil will translate
into a 10 cent per gallon increase in
retail gasoline prices, the officials
estimated.
Action Needed
In his midday appearance yesterday
in the crowded House chamber, Ford
called for congressional action by
April 1 on his cash rebate plan.
He also proposed direct payments
of $BO to every person 18 years of age
and older whose incomes are so small
they don't file tax returns. And he said
an additional $2 billion would be given
cities and states through revenue
sharing.
Ford asked for standby authority
to ration gasoline if higher costs fail to
meet his goal of cutting oil imports by
a million barrels a day this year and
two million in 1976. But he told
Congress he had rejected rationing for
now because it "would produce
unacceptable inequities."
As part of his energy plan, Ford
urged quick legislation to allow
commercial production at the Elk
Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in
California.
AFL-CIO chief George Meany
denounced President Ford's economic
proposals and said organized labor will
fight them in Congress. The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce promised to do
what it can to help achieve Ford's
objectives.
Meany called Ford's plan to
stimulate the economy with tax cuts

unsupportable," saying it will fuel
