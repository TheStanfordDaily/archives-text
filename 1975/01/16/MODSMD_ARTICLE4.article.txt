# Asks Ballot Initiative
## Group Seeks A-Power Control 
### PAIGE CHERNO 
Since the beginning of the qtiarter, representatives of a
• citizen's group called "People for Proof" have been
soliciting signatures to put an initiative to control atomic
power plants on the state ballot.
Power companies would become completely liable for all
damages resulting from the manufacture, transportation or
storage of radioactive fuel and waste, under provisions of
the proposed initiative. It calls for close government
£ supervision of the safety systems of California's commercial
atomic power plants.
"We are not calling for a ban or moratorium to stop
plant growth," said Dwight Cocke, Northern California
director of People for Proof.
"We are simply calling for the state legislature and a
body of experts to supervise tests of the safety systems to
see whether or not they are effective," he said.
• Names Needed
Phil Kuranz, a People for Proof representative working
in White Plaza, said 312,000 names are needed on the
group's petition in order for the proposal to appear on the
next general election ballot in June 1976. About 200,000
people have already signed, he added.
Under the Price-Anderson Act, the power companies are
• currently liable for damages up to $560 million for each
accident per plant each year. According to Cocke, it was
estimated in the mid-sixties that actual environmental and
health damages would run between $l7-20 billion in the
event of a "major accident." And, he added, private

insurance companies will not cover the power plants.
The greatest fear, Cocke said, is that a reactor's core
cooling systerti might fail, which would result in a
"melt-down" of the components of the reactor. A "molten
blob of metal" would then sink into the earth, releasing
dangerous, long-lived , radioactive materials, such as
plutonium, into the atmosphere.
Diseases
Plutonium can cause lung cancer and heart diseases
Kuranz said, adding that it has been proven to cause
leukemia. Cocke called it "the most carcinogenic element
in existence." A major concern of People for Proof is that
plutonium, which remains in the environment for hundreds
of thousands of years, is properly transported and stored
with a minimum of leakage.
Power companies point out, and Cocke admits, that
there has never been a complete melt-down. He said there
was a partial melt-down outside Detroit in 1965 which
fortunately was contained by plant workers who were able
to get the cooling system working again.
The initiative proposes that a 15-member panel be
established to work with the state legislature, setting safety
standards and testing safety features of the existing plants.
One-third of the panel members would be representatives of
the power companies.
