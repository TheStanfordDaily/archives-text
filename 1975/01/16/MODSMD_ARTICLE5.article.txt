# 'Kennedy Victim Of Conspiracy'
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
President John F. Kennedy "was
killed because he was honestly seeking
peace in a corrupt world," according
to Rusty Rhodes, executive director of
the Committee to Research Political
Assassinations.
Speaking last night before a crowd
of 350 in Annenberg Auditorium,
Rhodes depicted the Kennedy
assassination as the result of continued
tensions in the early 1960s between
Kennedy, the Central Intelligence
Agency, and the military
establishment.
"No American president was ever
more at sword's point with his military
establishment than John F. Kennedy,"
said Rhodes. He described the
Pentagon in the spring of 1961 as
being engaged in "a sort of guerrilla
warfare" with the Kennedy
administration. *
In October 1963, Kennedy made
what Rhodes called, "what would be
his last executive order, and that was
to pull all United States military forces
out of Vietnam." The first troops
withdrawn were already in Honolulu
when Kennedy was shot on Nov. 22,
1963.
False Claims
According to Rhodes, nearly all of
the accepted facts reported by the
Warren Commission are false Lee
Harvey Oswald did not act alone, more
than three shots were fired, Jack Ruby
was paid to kill Oswald, and Oswald,
rather than being a Marxist, was in fact
a CIA operative.
In disclaiming Oswald's role as the
lone assassin, Rhodes explained that
Oswald's alleged weapon was never
linked to the suspect through
fingerprints. Further, tests performed
on Oswald after his arrest proved that
he had not fired a gun on Nov. 22.
"An indication of the quality of the
rifle would be the cost," said Rhodes
of the supposed murder weapon which
had a faulty sight and trigger. "The
rifle cost $12.78."
Three Shot Theory
"We also have to question the three
shot theory," said Rhodes, explaining
that comparative photographic
evidence proved that all three shots
would have been fired by a single
gunman within 5.6 seconds.
Following the assassination, top
marksmen across the country tried to
duplicate the three shots using
stationary targets at a range of 25 feet.
"After several weeks of practice,
one fellow got his time down to 6.7
seconds," said Rhodes, "but he missed
the target."

Rhodes showed many slides
supporting his claims, including the
controversial film by Abraham
Zapruder which shows Kennedy's head
thrown violently backward and
essentially blown apart by what
Rhodes claims is the fourth or fifth
shot fired.
Fired Shot
If the final shot had been fired
from the Texas School Book
Depository as is claimed in the Warren
Report, "Newtonian physics would
demand that the president's head fly
forward," said Rhodes.
Because the National Archives
containing the material evidence used'
by the Warren Commission were
closed until the year 2039 by an
executive order by President Lyndon
B. Johnson, Rhodes is hopeful that a
congressional subpoena from Rep.
Henry B. Gonzales (D-Texas) will open
the records this year.
"Rumor and innuendo," concluded
Rhodes, "ruin the very fiber of
democracy. We must insist on our
citizens' right to know."
