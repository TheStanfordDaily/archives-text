# French Campus Moving To 'More Modest Villa'
## 
### DON COX 
The overseas studies center in
Tours, France will be moved to a
smaller, more modest villa after
program administrators determined it
would be prohibitively expensive to
continue to maintain the center in its
present building.
The Overseas Studies Office
announced yesterday that the present
academic program would be retained
in its present form and staffed by the
same personnel. Administrators plan a
"smooth" transition to the new
facilities in June.
While some students will live in the
three-story villa, most will be housed
in dormitories of the University of
Tours. "This new program will provide
many more opportunities for our
students to participate in the student
life of the University of Tours, and to
become better acquainted with the
French way of life than has been
possible in our present residential
system," program administrators said
in a statement.
"I think with this arrangement,
we've found about exactly what we
wanted to find," said Overseas Studies
Director Mark Mancall. "To put
students with two quarters of French

into the dorms there will force them
to learn more quickly," he said.
The new villa is six to eight blocks
from the present center and about two
blocks from the Place Nationale in the
center of Tours. All students will be
provided with meal allowances
enabling them to purchase meals at
restaurants of their choosing.
Mancall noted that the meal
allowances will continue during
weekends and mid-quarter academic
breaks, which will facilitate
exploratory trips. "This is a major
improvement, since in the past
students were stuck for the full cost of
meals when they were traveling," said
Associate Director Don Price.
Mancall confirmed that the
overseas office has also considered
moving the center to Paris, but this
option became too expensive.
Price noted that the decision to
move the Tours campus is still
tentative, pending final resolution of
the contract terms and approval by the
University business office. He did not
see any real difficulty, though.
The summer program at the Tours
center will be eight weeks long and
there will be no mid-quarter break.
