'lrreplaceable Debt'

Editor:
I was shocked and
disappointed to read in the Daily
Jan. 14 that innovative programs
like SCIRE, SWOPSI and Urban
Studies face termination or severe
cutbacks. The article's indication
that these programs might be
absorbed into academic
departments is not reassuring, for
the very nature of innovative
programs requires independent
budgeting and freedom from more
traditional educational
approaches.
With a competent staff,
student and faculty enthusiasm
and administrative support,
SCIRE, SWOPSI and Urban
Studies have provided a unique
educational service, a service that
has produced tangible writings,
course plans, classes and field
work/study programs.
This kind of educational
opportunity was a primary reason
that I transferred to Stanford, and
I have talked to many students
who likewise feel that these
programs make Stanford unusual.
In my opinion, cutting back or
phasing out these programs in the
name of economy will leave
Stanford with an irreplaceable
debt.

On March 4,1975, there will be
local elections all over California.
In order to vote in them you must
register by the last day of
January. (There are always
registrars at Columbae House, 549
Lasuen, and registrars will be
going through the dorms and
sitting in White Plaza in the last
weeks of January.)
Many Stanford students don't
vote in local elections because
they don't realize how great their
stake is.
For example, on the ballots of
students this March 4 will be
four seats on important local
boards and a revenue measure.
The most important race will be
for a seat on the Palo Alto School
Board. The University is the
largest taxpayer to the school
district and those taxes are passed
directly on to the students.
Last year, Joshua Goldstein, a
Stanford staff researcher, ran a
surprisingly strong second in a
afield of five that was topped by
■"the well known incumbent. This
year there is no incumbent
running and Joshua is given fair
odds on picking up the vacant
seat. But in an election where
only 7000 votes are needed to
win, every ballot cast is crucial.
The other races are for three of
the five seats on the Foothill

College Board of Trustees. In this
race two young progressive
professionals (a lawyer and a
teacher respectively), Andrew
Cohen and Tom Frankum, are
running in a large field that
includes all three of the
incumbents.
The ballot measure is a
three-year override for school
district property tax levels. It
allows for a gradual reduction of
tax levels to a state mandated
level. This prevents drastic budget
slashing and mass layoffs of new
teachers. A similar measure passed
last year but it was only good for
one year.
In last year's election many
students refused to vote. They
gave many reasons: not registered,
no interest, no information, no
right to interfere locally, local
elections are meaningless.
None of these excuses will hold
water. A lack of interest is only
the voter's fault. Not to vote
on the flimsy fiction that students
have nothing to do with the
school district (when after all they
are taxed for it) and are just sort
of "passing through" Stanford
and Palo Alto on their way to
wherever is to cop out on the
most basic duty of a citizen in a
representative democracy
voting. Without it, the whole
system won't make it. And it's
not making it.
Local elections are important.
School districts affect everyone.
The only question is, do you
affect them?

I want to congratulate Patty
Fels for her excellent feature
article on Prof. Hubert Marshall.
She has perceptibly captured the
gentle and extraordinarily rare
qualities of the man, who remains
in my memory as one of the finest
teachers I have known.
Years ago I used to teach
Political Science 1 at Stanford as a
kind of relief pitcher for Marshall
so that he could have one quarter
off. Students would rearrange
their schedules to wait until
Marshall was back the next
quarter and properly so. It was
his course, and no one could
replace him. He was simply superb
15 years ago and it is not
surprising to learn that he has
improved over the years.
There are men and women in
the academic world who have
devoted their lives to teaching
because they genuinely like and
learn from the intellectual combat
with students. Marshall is one of
the best. The pity is that there are
not more like him.

I want to congratulate Patty
Fels for her excellent feature
article on Prof. Hubert Marshall.
She has perceptibly captured the
gentle and extraordinarily rare
qualities of the man, who remains
in my memory as one of the finest
teachers I have known.
Years ago I used to teach
Political Science 1 at Stanford as a
kind of relief pitcher for Marshall
so that he could have one quarter
off. Students would rearrange
their schedules to wait until
Marshall was back the next
quarter and properly so. It was
his course, and no one could
replace him. He was simply superb
15 years ago and it is not
surprising to learn that he has
improved over the years.
There are men and women in
the academic world who have
devoted their lives to teaching
because they genuinely like and
learn from the intellectual combat
with students. Marshall is one of
the best. The pity is that there are
not more like him.

Editor:
I was shocked and
disappointed to read in the Daily
Jan. 14 that innovative programs
like SCIRE, SWOPSI and Urban
Studies face termination or severe
cutbacks. The article's indication
that these programs might be
absorbed into academic
departments is not reassuring, for
the very nature of innovative
programs requires independent
budgeting and freedom from more
traditional educational
approaches.
With a competent staff,
student and faculty enthusiasm
and administrative support,
SCIRE, SWOPSI and Urban
Studies have provided a unique
educational service, a service that
has produced tangible writings,
course plans, classes and field
work/study programs.
This kind of educational
opportunity was a primary reason
that I transferred to Stanford, and
I have talked to many students
who likewise feel that these
programs make Stanford unusual.
In my opinion, cutting back or
phasing out these programs in the
name of economy will leave
Stanford with an irreplaceable
debt.

On March 4,1975, there will be
local elections all over California.
In order to vote in them you must
register by the last day of
January. (There are always
registrars at Columbae House, 549
Lasuen, and registrars will be
going through the dorms and
sitting in White Plaza in the last
weeks of January.)
Many Stanford students don't
vote in local elections because
they don't realize how great their
stake is.
For example, on the ballots of
students this March 4 will be
four seats on important local
boards and a revenue measure.
The most important race will be
for a seat on the Palo Alto School
Board. The University is the
largest taxpayer to the school
district and those taxes are passed
directly on to the students.
Last year, Joshua Goldstein, a
Stanford staff researcher, ran a
surprisingly strong second in a
afield of five that was topped by
■"the well known incumbent. This
year there is no incumbent
running and Joshua is given fair
odds on picking up the vacant
seat. But in an election where
only 7000 votes are needed to
win, every ballot cast is crucial.
The other races are for three of
the five seats on the Foothill

College Board of Trustees. In this
race two young progressive
professionals (a lawyer and a
teacher respectively), Andrew
Cohen and Tom Frankum, are
running in a large field that
includes all three of the
incumbents.
The ballot measure is a
three-year override for school
district property tax levels. It
allows for a gradual reduction of
tax levels to a state mandated
level. This prevents drastic budget
slashing and mass layoffs of new
teachers. A similar measure passed
last year but it was only good for
one year.
In last year's election many
students refused to vote. They
gave many reasons: not registered,
no interest, no information, no
right to interfere locally, local
elections are meaningless.
None of these excuses will hold
water. A lack of interest is only
the voter's fault. Not to vote
on the flimsy fiction that students
have nothing to do with the
school district (when after all they
are taxed for it) and are just sort
of "passing through" Stanford
and Palo Alto on their way to
wherever is to cop out on the
most basic duty of a citizen in a
representative democracy
voting. Without it, the whole
system won't make it. And it's
not making it.

only 7000 votes are needed to
win, every ballot cast is crucial.
The other races are for three of
the five seats on the Foothill

College Board of Trustees. In this
race two young progressive
professionals (a lawyer and a
teacher respectively), Andrew
Cohen and Tom Frankum, are
running in a large field that
includes all three of the
incumbents.
The ballot measure is a
three-year override for school
district property tax levels. It
allows for a gradual reduction of
tax levels to a state mandated
level. This prevents drastic budget
slashing and mass layoffs of new
teachers. A similar measure passed
last year but it was only good for
one year.
In last year's election many
students refused to vote. They
gave many reasons: not registered,
no interest, no information, no
right to interfere locally, local
elections are meaningless.
None of these excuses will hold
water. A lack of interest is only
the voter's fault. Not to vote
on the flimsy fiction that students
have nothing to do with the
school district (when after all they
are taxed for it) and are just sort
of "passing through" Stanford
and Palo Alto on their way to
wherever is to cop out on the
most basic duty of a citizen in a
representative democracy
voting. Without it, the whole
system won't make it. And it's
not making it.
Local elections are important.
School districts affect everyone.
The only question is, do you
affect them?

Too Few Marshalls

Editor:
I want to congratulate Patty
Fels for her excellent feature
article on Prof. Hubert Marshall.
She has perceptibly captured the
gentle and extraordinarily rare
qualities of the man, who remains
in my memory as one of the finest
teachers I have known.
Years ago I used to teach
Political Science 1 at Stanford as a
kind of relief pitcher for Marshall
so that he could have one quarter
off. Students would rearrange
their schedules to wait until
Marshall was back the next
quarter and properly so. It was
his course, and no one could
replace him. He was simply superb
15 years ago and it is not
surprising to learn that he has
improved over the years.
There are men and women in
the academic world who have
devoted their lives to teaching
because they genuinely like and
learn from the intellectual combat
with students. Marshall is one of
the best. The pity is that there are
not more like him.
