We appreciate all the
contributions, folks, but you
seem to be forgetting that we
do need your name and phone
number and some
identification. Also, keep your
columns and letters short. Just
because the limit is 70 lines,
doesn't mean that length has
the best chance of publication.
The shorter, the better; 40-50
lines is best. Those should be,
of course, 62-space lines.
And please, no publicity
releases or trivial ramblings
let's keep those columns
interesting. Call us if you wish
at 497-4632 with questions.
But if you have a column,
bring it by the Daily office, or
mail it to the Daily, Storke
Building, Stanford, California
94305.
Many thanks.
