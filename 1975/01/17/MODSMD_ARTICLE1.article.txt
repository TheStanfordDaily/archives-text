# Mayer Calls Bus Survey Encouraging
## 
### JAN PEPPER 
Almost two-thirds of the students
here would pay 25 cents a ride for bus
service that comes to within a block of
• their residence hall, an ASSU Campus
Bus Service Survey released yesterday
shows.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer,
encouraged by the results, expressed
hopes that the Santa Clara County Bus
District would schedule an arterial
II route that would go by University
residences.
Mayer also noted that the Santa
Clara County Transportation
Commission voted 10-8 Wednesday
night to recommend to the county
Board of Supervisors the termination
I of Dial-A-Ride bus operations.
If approved by the county
supervisors, the "time would be ripe to
make an effort to get scheduled routes
to go by Stanford residences," Mayer
noted, because about 90 buses would
be available.
However, early reaction from the
supervisors to the Commission's
recommendation indicated they would
oppose eliminating the service.
The Commission's recommendation
came in response to a ruling last
Thursday by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Marshall S. Hall
* that the county must either
discontinue the Dial-A-Ride service or
buy out eight competing taxicab firms.
The county must decide by Jan. 24.
The vote to recommend scrapping
the Dial-A-Ride program followed an
11-7 vote not to purchase the cab
•companies.
Either way the Dial-A-Ride decision
turns out, Mayer said that he hopes a
mass transportation system, in the
form of bus service, can be instituted
on campus.
He noted that Stanford is the single
|> biggest taxpayer in Santa Clara County
as one of the reasons the county
Dial-A-Ride program should be
extended to campus if continued.
Mayer also cited the massive
