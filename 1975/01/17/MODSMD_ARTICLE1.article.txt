# Mayer Calls Bus Survey Encouraging
## 
### JAN PEPPER 
Almost two-thirds of the students
here would pay 25 cents a ride for bus
service that comes to within a block of
• their residence hall, an ASSU Campus
Bus Service Survey released yesterday
shows.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer,
encouraged by the results, expressed
hopes that the Santa Clara County Bus
District would schedule an arterial
II route that would go by University
residences.
Mayer also noted that the Santa
Clara County Transportation
Commission voted 10-8 Wednesday
night to recommend to the county
Board of Supervisors the termination
I of Dial-A-Ride bus operations.
If approved by the county
supervisors, the "time would be ripe to
make an effort to get scheduled routes
to go by Stanford residences," Mayer
noted, because about 90 buses would
be available.
However, early reaction from the
supervisors to the Commission's
recommendation indicated they would
oppose eliminating the service.
The Commission's recommendation
came in response to a ruling last
Thursday by Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Marshall S. Hall
* that the county must either
discontinue the Dial-A-Ride service or
buy out eight competing taxicab firms.
The county must decide by Jan. 24.
The vote to recommend scrapping
the Dial-A-Ride program followed an
11-7 vote not to purchase the cab
•companies.
Either way the Dial-A-Ride decision
turns out, Mayer said that he hopes a
mass transportation system, in the
form of bus service, can be instituted
on campus.
He noted that Stanford is the single
|> biggest taxpayer in Santa Clara County
as one of the reasons the county
Dial-A-Ride program should be
extended to campus if continued.
Mayer also cited the massive

LEAVING CAMPUS—Four out of 10 students who answered a recent survey
said they leave campus between one and three times weekly, graduate student
Jeff Schutt said yesterday. The survey was conducted by the ASSU.

parking problem in the central campus
area due to construction on former
lots. With a bus service, commuters to
campus could rely on mass
transportation and thereby save
themselves the problem of finding a
parking space, he continued.
The survey also showed that about
28 percent use bicycles for
transportation.
Jeff Schutt, a graduate student in
industrial engineering who evaluated
the results as part of the Palo
Alto-Menlo Park Transportation
Project, emphasized that 31 percent of
the students said they leave campus
between one and three times weekly.
And almost 30 percent said they went
off campus three or more times.
Schutt admitted that the results
may not represent a random sample
because of "a pretty good element of

self-selection" which was involved in
who returned the surveys.
Mostly Undergraduates
Most of the students responding to
the survey were undergraduates. Only
25 graduate students submitted
surveys, but Mayer noted that because
more than three-fourths of them
owned cars, the figures could be
considered insignificant.
The survey did show that those
students who owned cars were less
willing to pay for bus service than
those who did not own cars, Schutt
noted.
However, ownership of a bicycle
apparently did not affect whether a
person said he woudl pay for the
service. In fact, a slightly greater
percentage of people (67 to 66)
indicated they would use the service
on the proposed route, which virtually
encircles the central campus.
