U.S. Embargo?

Most of Western Europe, Japan and the
United States are now in the grasp of
unstoppable inflation and seemingly on the
road to serious depression.
And part of the reason for this dire
economic condition can be traced to the
Arab oil embargo of last fall.
Considering that 11 percent of the oil
used in the U.S. comes from the Arab
countries, the embargo had a drastic effect
on the economy.
It was an inconvenience for most people
and it caused gasoline and heating oil prices
to rise, but its greatest impact came in the
industrial sector of the economy. ,
The embargo caused industry to shut
down some plants, which increased
unemployment, and to increase prices
drastically, furthering inflation.
Embargo An Instigator
The em.bargo was an instigator and
accelerator of the inflation that already
existed in the fall of 1973.
The realities of a shortage of energy are
still with us. In effect, the energy crisis has
become a permanent fixture of American
life.
The embargo was used by the Arab oil
producing nations as a means to achieve
political ends. It was economic blackmail
intended to further the Arab cause — the
fight against Israel.
Lifting the embargo changed things very
little. Extremely high prices and cuts in
production kept the oil situation almost
exactly the same.
And the threat of another embargo is still

evident. The Arabs achieved what they
wanted with the first embargo and will use
that method again if need be.
Threat Of War?
The threat of armed conflict in the Middle
East is again on the rise. If war does occur,
the United States will likely suffer reprisals in
the form of oil restrictions.
The United States must take drastic steps
to ensure the continued flow of Arab oil.
One step that should be taken is for the
countries affected by the Arab oil restrictions
to band together and economically blackmail
the Arab oil producers.
Economic blackmail isn't a desirable
method to achieve the continued flow of oil,
but if the United States is to continue to
function as a leading economic power it
might be necessary.

War And Peace
It was nearly two years ago Jan. 28,
1973 that Dr. Henry Kissinger, Man of
Peace, flew home from the bargaining table
with the Paris Peace Agreement, a document
"ending," as he said, "the war in Vietnam,"
and, at the same time, guaranteeing for
America the only kind of peace its
freedom-loving citizens would accept: an
honorable one.
With the long-sought settlement finally at
hand, the Man of Peace was free to jaunt
about the volatile globe, searching of course
for more peace, averting war and finally
popping up with a new Nobel Peace Prize and
an old Richard Nixon on the cover of Time
magazine.

Since Kissinger engineered the Paris
Agreement, more than six billion American
dollars have bought death in Southeast Asia.
This, according to figures released recently
by Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wisc.), is a "rock
bottom figure."
But it seems cold to protest war and death
in terms of dollars lost even when it works
out to $ll million a day. The loss to
Southeast Asians, in terms of agony,
repression and thousands of deaths, to
Americans, in terms of hungry families, the
jobless, the exploited is sick and, at least
marginally, psychotic.
Napalm Benefits
Few Americans benefit from jellied
gasoline sticking to the side of a screaming
Vietnamese child, fleshless and bonebare,
who stumbles into a rice paddy to drown
pain.
But that's getting off the subject a little;
this is an essay, after all, about the Man of
Peace, a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize,
Rockefeller's Rasputin, America's Secretary
of State. Yes, Henry Kissinger has now told
the oil producing nations of the Middle East
that this government would consider sending
troops to the oil fields if the Arab states
didn't keep the price right. America, he said
deliberately, might invade the Middle East.
The Man of Peace reasoned that high Arab
oil prices would be construed as an act of war
against the United States economy, hence the
United States. Wise and noble of him.
Who better than a Man of Peace can
determine what constitutes an act of war?

Washington Daily, from which it is
