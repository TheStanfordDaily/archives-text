# SWOPSI Cannot Be 'Absorbed'
## 
### Dave Galligan, Ernest Gundling 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs announced Tuesday
that he would recommend to
Provost William Miller the
elimination of SWOPSI (Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social
Issues) by June, 1976.
The Dean's decision was
prompted by increasing budgetary
constraints, and his contention is
that the innovative functions of
the SWOPSI program could be
absorbed elsewhere in the
University, specifically through
departmental use of the workshop
format.
In forming his recommenda
tions, which if carried out would
also spell the end of the SCIRE
(Stanford Center for Research and
Innovation in Education), Urban
Studies and Undergraduate
Writing programs as they now
exist, Gibbs seems to have made
several errors in judgement. To
begin with, the real budgetary
importance of the elimination of a
program such as SWOPSI can be
called into question.
SWOPSI costs a mere $25,000
per year, an amount comparable
to that-which a single professor or
administrator might receive. This
quarter alone, the program is
offering about 25 courses with a
total enrollment of around 300
students: Yet through its use of
members of the faculty, student
body and general community as
volunteer instructors, SWOPSI is
able to provide a very personal
form of education. For the money,
SWOPSI is clearly a bargain.
In spite of SWOPSI's low cost,
the staff took its responsibility to
hold down spending seriously and
sent Gibbs a set of budget-cutting
recommendations. These
recommendations have been
largely ignored.
One-Year Transition
Byway of softening the blow
to undergraduate education which
the death of SWOPSI would most
certainly be, Gibbs envisions a one
year transition period, during
which the functions of the
program would be integrated into
other, already existing parts of the
University.
SWOPSI ideals, he says,
"should" be absorbed elsewhere
and will be given "highest
priority" consideration to operate
in academic departments.
The nebulous nature of these

statements provides a clue to the
real fate of SWOPSI if its official
elimination in June, 1976, occurs
as recommended. It is unrealistic
to believe that SWOPSI could be
absorbed by the traditional
departments of this University.
The courses now provided by
the program exist precisely
because they fulfill needs which
are not met by the regular
academic departments. There is a
fundamental difference between
the orientations of the traditional
academic departments and
SWOPSI. In addition to filling
gaps in the regular academic fare
of the University, the program
makes available a valuable
practical dimension to educational
experience. Its raison d'etre is in
fact this action component.
With its different orientation,

SWOPSI could not easily be
digested by the traditional
departments. There can be little
incentive for the departments to
expand their course offerings and
alter their methods of instruction
especially at this particular time,
when budget cuts of 10 to 20
percent will be taking their toll of
existing programs.
And with the present SWOPSI
staff and central office gone, who
will encourage and facilitate the
development of the new courses
the program has continually given
birth to?
In conclusion, we can only
comment that Gibbs, whose
position was originally designed to
champion the cause of a balanced
undergraduate education, solicited
no direct input from students in

making his decisions. He was
quoted in the Daily as approving
of more student input into budget
cutting deliberations and
commented, "Whatever forum
students are in, they should speak
up."
This misses the point entirely.
Students do not have a
meaningful forum. There is no
regularly utilized mechanism for
student contributions to decisions
such as these. Students
increasingly resent the setting of
major University policies without
serious provision being made for
constructive input on their part.
Once again students are placed in
the position of reacting, and we
can only react vigorously.
