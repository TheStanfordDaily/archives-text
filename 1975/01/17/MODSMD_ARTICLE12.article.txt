# A 						Future ASSU Scenario
## 
### Tim Ferguson 
Extrapolating somewhat on the
latest troubles of the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board in securing a
Third World scholar to lecture on
the exploitation of his country
(Daily, Jan. 14), we might come
up with this future scenario:
The ASSU Guest Prisoner
Board today announced it will
seek an additional $1 fee
assessment to fund an endowed
imprisonment for an "exceptional
scholar" in some exploited
country of the world.
Board members refused to
release either the name or the
country of the scholar, for fear he
will be boiled in oil as soon as
word of Stanford's offer reached
his native land.
Addition of the new scholar
would bring to eight the number
of political prisoners around the
globe currently subsidized by the
ASSU.
The program grew out of the
ASSU Guest Professorship, which
was disbanded in* the late 1970s
when its governing board was
unable to acquire the services of
any of its desired professors.
Instead, the scholars were
consistently locked up by their
governments rather than given
exit visas.

Emphasis of the original
program began to shift in early
1975 when Jim Regan, then a
member of the Committee to
Invite Nguyen Huu Thai to
Stanford (which fought for
creation of the gufest
professorship) disclosed a shift in
plans. ;
Regan said the Guest
Professorship Board had
abandoned its original professorial
plans for Thai in favor of a
Chilean scholar (who also
subsequently was arrested), but
would appropriate $2OOO of its
original $lO,OOO budget to Thai
nevertheless, to "fly him here and
to put him up."
Thai was later released by
South Vietnamese authorities,
flown to the United States at
ASSU expense, and placed under
house arrest at Rickey's Hyatt
House in Palo Alto by members of
the CIA.
He remains at the Hyatt House
to this day, collecting a $lO-a-day
honorarium from the Guest
Prisoner Board. Seven other
scholars were later adopted by the
ASSU, immediately imprisoned in
their home countries, and sent'
paychecks by the Board. One of
the prisoners was later
electrocuted in an endowed chair.

Current budget of the Guest
Prisoner Board is $210,000 per
year, obtained through 28
refundable fee assessments. The
newly requested assessment would
boost the budget to $220,000, or
about twice the operating
expenses of the much-cut back
Engineering Department.
