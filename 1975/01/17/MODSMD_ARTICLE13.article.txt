Garvin Is ... (Part I)
Editor: /
Move Over, Glenn Garvin, and
make way for the new generation
of sportswriters. They're quick
and efficient, they whip out
hundreds of words on almost
nothing, they meet every deadline
and they never miss a statistic. So
what if some frustrated gossip
hound calls them boring, and
suggests that they inject a little
interest into their stories. How
imbecilic; the best story is the one
that gets in on time and covers all
the facts!
No one will miss Glenn's fans,
those irrepressible, fun-loving
fellows who write in letters to the
editor proclaiming that Glenn
deserves the Pulitzer prize, and
should be given Howard Cosell's
job.
On the other hand, it will be
fun to read what they have to say
when Glenn is demoted to
assistant copy-boy. All Glenn
himself could say is, "I'm getting
too old for this." Since he's a
little young for arthritis, what he
must mean is that he just isn't
that efficient.
The new breed of sportswriters
has been unfairly ' maligned,
simply because they don't seem to
have anything to say once the
reader gets beyond the statistics.
"Tedious Little B s" is a cue
for uncontrollable fits of
chortling, and all because they say
things like, "Journalism is a job,
sports is a job, and reading a story
should be like going to work."
How unfair can you get?
The new journalist's idea of
fulfillment (so far every one of
the 37 polled has given the same
answer) is to be sports editor for
the Wall Street Journal. Glenn
wants to write the great American
novel on the great American
pastime. Whose ideals are sick?
So accept it: the new
generation is here to stay. And let
this be the first letter to salute the
sexy new wielders of the pen that
is mightier than the baseball bat.

The Arab Forum
Editor:
Over the past year, we have
become aware of growing
self-confidence and optimism
among Arab students at Stanford,
concerning the future of Arab
societies. The frustrations of
military humiliation and poverty,
which bred pre-occupation with
individual affairs and a low public
profile, have been altered by the
October War and the vastly
increased oil revenues. Yesterday's
challenges have become today's
opportunities.
We believe that Arab students
at Stanford (and those non-Arabs
with sincere interest in the Middle
East), as future scholars and
technocrats, must accept
responsibilities equal to the
exceptional opportunities which
they enjoy.
Accordingly, at the suggestion
of several friends and colleagues,
we request the support of
interested members of the
Stanford community in organizing
"The Arab Forum," which will
bring together Arab students and
scholars to discuss social and
economic problems of Arab
peoples, their training and
research in the U.S., and most
importantly, the relation between
that research and those problems.
In this manner, we hope to
raise our awareness of the variety
of problems facing Arabs, various
approaches to their solution, and
how we can best direct our work
to prepare ourselves to address
those problems.
The Arab Forum will not
concern itself with the
Arab-Israeli confrontation.
Preoccupation with that one issue
has diverted too much attention
for too long from other important
issues.
The first meeting of the Arab
Forum will be held Thursday, Jan.
23, at 7 p.m. in Room 270 of
Tresidder Memorial Union. All
members of the Stanford
Community are welcome to
participate in discussion of our
plans for the Winter Quarter.

A Friendly Warning
Editor:
If bicycle riders insist on riding
on the left-hand side of the road
at night, they should use a light.
And if they must ride at night
without a light, they should ride
on the right-hand side of the
street. Either one is dangerous
enough, but doing both at once is
sheer madness!
