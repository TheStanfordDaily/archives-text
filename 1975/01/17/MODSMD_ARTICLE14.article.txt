# Lawsuit May Force County To Buy Taxis

During the next two weeks the fate of
Santa Clara County's imperiled Dial-A-Ride
service will be determined while the federal
government watches closely.
The Dial-A-Ride system, an innovative
transit experiment begun on November 1
which is supposed to provide door-to-door
transportation for the 1.2 million residents of
Santa : Clara county, has operated clumsily,
though successfully, during its infancy.
Last week Dial-A-Ride received a major
setback when Superior Court Judge Marshall
S. Hall ordered the transit board either to
purchase the county's eight private taxicab
companies, or to discontinue service. The
ruling came in response to a cab company suit
charging that Dial-A-Ride had cut into their
business.
Transit leaders say they were not surprised
by the ruling. County Supervisor Dominic
Cortese said Dial-A-Ride's charter legislation
"required us to buy out any competing
transportation systems."
Alternatives
Both the Transit District Board of
Directors and its advisory, the Transit
Commission, met on Wednesday to discuss a
response to the ruling. There are two
alternatives to purchasing the cab companies:
an appeal of the ruling, or discontinuing
Dial-A-Ride.
Clearly the founding fathers oppose this
latter drastic step. Not surprisingly, the
federal government is lurking in the
background, anxious to prevent the end of a
promising experiment which it has helped
finance with allocations totaling over $3
million.
"They frown heavily upon any thought of
discontinuing Dial-A-Ride," said Cortese,
referring to government sources which have
been communicating with Howard Wattkings,
the transit district's lobbyist in Washington.
'Leaving'
Members of the Transit board have hinted
that they would not necessarily mind
acquiring the cab companies, since the
taxicabs could be utilized in the Dial-A-Ride
system. "There's a leaning toward buying
out," conceded Cortese. But "I don't want to
encourage the cab companies," he added
hastily.
If the county purchases the cab companies,
the taxis would probably replace the large
buses in the Dial-A-Ride system. The buses
would instead be used for expanded arterial
service, as well as in commuter carpools.
Transit officials believe the taxis could
maintain present Dial-A-Bus workloads at a
lower cost.
The federal government will not pay for
the cab companies directly, although the
county is slated to receive more than $4
million later this year through a new $ll
billion transit bill. Instead, money for the
purchase would be drawn from operating
capital, at the expense of a large budget
deficit.
A final decision regarding the fate of
Dial-A-Ride will be made at today's transit
board meeting. It is a safe bet that the Board
will elect to buy the cab companies. After all,
secure in strong government endorsement and
financial support, the transit officials are eager
to promote the triumph of their nationally
prominent experiment.
