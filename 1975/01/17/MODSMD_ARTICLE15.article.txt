# CAB Weighs Proposal
## Charter Flights May Be Doomed 
### MARK FUNK 
While the Civil Aeronautics Board weighs
the effects of a proposed ban on affinity
group charters, Stanford students are almost
unanimous in their opposition to the measure.
They should be. Students, especially those
from the East and parts of the Midwest,; stand
to lose much if the proposal is not dropped. A
New York Christmas flight which cost $l6O
through the ASSU Travel Service would
skyrocket to $360 on a commercial carrier.
The affinity group charters, which the
Travel Service currently books for all flights,
will end Dec. 1 unless a pressure campaign
directed at the CAB is successful.
Co-ordinating the drive at Stanford is
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer. He said
student groups and other organizations with a
stake in the final decision are "making some
headway. A deadline for receipt of comments
and petitions, which was originally set for
mid-December, has been moved back to the
first week in February."
Mayer claimed the travel service was the
most justifiable student service the ASSU
currently offers. He said the ruling would
affect as many as 5000 clients on the campus.
Already enlisted in the struggle to save
affinity flights are Democratic Senators Alan
Cranston and John Tunney and Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park).
But that is of little solace to Stanford
students who face the possibility of increased
costs (over 50 percent) for commercial airfare.
Some have indicated that they may cut back
on travel plans, particularly flights home
during the holidays, if the measure passed.
"I feel the CAB is cutting the throats of
students," complained student John Topping,
who lives in Cincinnati. "First they dropped
International Student Fare, then International
Youth Fare was cut out and then youth
standby was eliminated. What next?"

David Fogelman, who took a Christmas
charter to Dallas-Ft. Worth, said that the
cheap flights were a contributing factor in his
decision to come West.
"I don't know if I would have attended
Stanford if the charters had been discontinued
earlier," Fogelman commented. "And with
the new ruling, I think I'll be traveling
between Palo Alto and Texas a lot less."
Even if the proposal passes the CAB, it
could be in for some rough going. A Ralph
Nader-backed organization in Washington

D.C., the Aviation Consumer Action Project,
has threatened legal action if it passes.
They contend that the move to end
affinity flights, in essence, is price-setting on a
non-competitive basis and contrary to the
powers Congress granted the Board. The
Justice Department has concurred with the
Project's opinion and two branches, including
the Anti-Trust Division, are also
contemplating the possibility of a suit.
And students will be watching fearfully.
