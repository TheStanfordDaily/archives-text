# CIA Research Issue Resurfaces On Campus

The issue of Department of Defense
(DoD) and Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) research on campus re-emerged
briefly this week with the news that
Psychology Prof. Daryl Bern turned down
CIA research funds.
In the late 60s, defense work at the
University was a focus for anti-war
activities.
Military contracts at Stanford started
during World War 11, and continued
during the "Cold War" years, when
national defense was a lucrative and
popular pursuit. As popular sentiment
changed, some students and faculty began
publicly questioning the University's
involvement with the Vietnam war and
national security.
So, when the Daily revealed the
presence of at least one classified CIA
contract on campus in 1966, "a mild
uproar" followed, according to a 1971
SWOPSI report
At the time, Hubert Heffner,
associated provost for research, told the
Daily that the University held 13
classified contracts worth a total of $3.4
million. He also said that the classified
work "differed very little" from usual
Stanford research, and that all of the
contracts had been reviewed for their
academic value.
But in April 1969, after three years of
debate, the Faculty Senate concluded
that classified research was not consistent
with "the principle of openness in
research the principle of freedom of
access by all interested persons to the
underlying data, to the processes, and to
the final results of research."

So, the decision to prohibit classified
research was made on the basis of this
academic principle; the University offered
no moral or political judgment on the
DoD or the CIA.
One of the most significant aspects of
CIA research on campus was lost in this
concern with classified research; the two
contracts uncovered by the Daily in 1966
had been masked with the names of
non-existent funding organizations.
According to a 1971 Chaparral article,
one of these contracts was actually
initiated at Harvard. Emeritus Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Rambo brought
the contract with him when he came to
Stanford in 1951. The project was
completed several years before the CIA
sponsorship was discovered.
Then-President Wallace Sterling told
the Daily that the other contract came
"from a cover which we had no reason at
the time to think was a cover for the
CIA."
The Committee on Research Policy
considered the problem of how to avoid
these masked funds, but reached no
operational solution, according to the
SWOPSI report.
So, the last two known CIA contracts
on campus were masked. There is no
mechanism for monitoring possible CIA
covers, and at least one offer of CIA
sponsorship has been made public. Since
the CIA is a clandestine organization,
which tends to cover up its activities
whenever possible, it is certainly possible
that the CIA is now conducting research
through Stanford.
