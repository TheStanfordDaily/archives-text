# Where Do You Put A New SWOPSI?
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Provost William F. Miller has a lot of
reading to do.
He received a memorandum from Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs. That
memorandum outlined Gibbs'
recommendations for budget cuts in
undergraduate studies.
Gibbs recommended that SCIRE and the
Undergraduate Writing Program (UWP) end
this June and that SWOPSI and Urban Studies
end in June 1976. The functions of the
affected programs would be absorbed by
other units of the University, but on a

reduced scale, Gibbs said.
The UWP can probably be absorbed most
easily. Prof. Wilfred Stone, director of
freshman writing, has already promised to
continue some of the innovations begun by
Ellen Nold, director of UWP.
Urban Studies has a fairly good chance of
being absorbed by other departments. Gibbs
recommended that an ad hoc committee be
appointed to decide the future of the
remaining courses.
So it appears that UWP and Urban Studies
may survive in one form or another. However,
the future of SCIRE and SWOPSI remains in
doubt.
Andrew Parnes, director of SWOPSI, has
maintained that his program offers classes
dealing with current social and political issues
that many departments would be unwilling to
absorb.
SCIRE faces a similar problem of
acceptance in the regular departments.
Before arriving at a decision based on
Gibbs' recommendations, Miller also has on
his desk a letter from the SWOPSI policy
board. It details SWOPSI's opposition to
Gibbs' suggestions, saying, "SWOPSI is not an
experimental program; currently in its sixth
year of successful operation, it is a regular
component of the University curriculum."
Miller has not only budget priorities with
which to deal but also academic concerns. The
elimination of the programs may diminish the
opportunity for a broad liberal undergraduate
education here.
President Richard Lyman has continually
advocated a broad liberal education. However,
another memorandum soon to appear on the
provost's desk may have a detrimental effect
on Lyman's academic views.
The provost asked Gibbs to draw up a list
of possible reorganization plans for his own
undergraduate studies office. At least one
of the plans may be elimination of the office.
Nold said, "He [Gibbs] may be reorganized
out of the Universitv."
First, it was the Gibbs recommendations
calling for the elimination of
extra-departmental programs. Now there is
talk of ending the activities of the office of
undergraduate studies. What next?
Some observers believe that undergraduate
education is in jeopardy. After all, the -
biggest contributors to University funds
including the government are interested in
research and development. That kind of study
is done almost exclusively on the graduate or
post-graduate level.
The adage that "a University is judged by
the strength of its graduate schools" may
become painfully clear in the next few years.
In an era of budget crises, continued financial
support will certainly go to the top-rated
professional schools here.
Provost Miller has a lot of reading to do.
And a lot of thinking.

Some observers believe that undergraduate
education is in jeopardy. After all, the -
biggest contributors to University funds

research and development. That kind of study

post-graduate level.
The adage that "a University is judged by

In an era of budget crises, continued financial
support will certainly go to the top-rated
professional schools here.
Provost Miller has a lot of reading to do.
And a lot of thinking.

Provost William F. Miller has a lot of
reading to do.
He received a memorandum from Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs. That
memorandum outlined Gibbs'
recommendations for budget cuts in
undergraduate studies.
Gibbs recommended that SCIRE and the
Undergraduate Writing Program (UWP) end
this June and that SWOPSI and Urban Studies
end in June 1976. The functions of the
affected programs would be absorbed by
other units of the University, but on a

reduced scale, Gibbs said.
The UWP can probably be absorbed most
easily. Prof. Wilfred Stone, director of
freshman writing, has already promised to
continue some of the innovations begun by
Ellen Nold, director of UWP.
Urban Studies has a fairly good chance of
being absorbed by other departments. Gibbs
recommended that an ad hoc committee be
appointed to decide the future of the
remaining courses.
So it appears that UWP and Urban Studies
may survive in one form or another. However,
the future of SCIRE and SWOPSI remains in
doubt.
Andrew Parnes, director of SWOPSI, has
maintained that his program offers classes
dealing with current social and political issues
that many departments would be unwilling to
absorb.
SCIRE faces a similar problem of
acceptance in the regular departments.
Before arriving at a decision based on
Gibbs' recommendations, Miller also has on
his desk a letter from the SWOPSI policy
board. It details SWOPSI's opposition to
Gibbs' suggestions, saying, "SWOPSI is not an
experimental program; currently in its sixth
year of successful operation, it is a regular
component of the University curriculum."
Miller has not only budget priorities with
which to deal but also academic concerns. The
elimination of the programs may diminish the
opportunity for a broad liberal undergraduate
education here.
President Richard Lyman has continually
advocated a broad liberal education. However,
another memorandum soon to appear on the
provost's desk may have a detrimental effect
on Lyman's academic views.
The provost asked Gibbs to draw up a list
of possible reorganization plans for his own
undergraduate studies office. At least one
of the plans may be elimination of the office.
Nold said, "He [Gibbs] may be reorganized
out of the Universitv."
First, it was the Gibbs recommendations
calling for the elimination of
extra-departmental programs. Now there is
talk of ending the activities of the office of
undergraduate studies. What next?
