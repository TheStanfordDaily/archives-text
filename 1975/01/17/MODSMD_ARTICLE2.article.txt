## Profs Critique Ford's Programs 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
President Ford's state of the union
address offered some novel
anti-recessionary plans while steering
clear of dangerously inflationary
nostrums, according to Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall.
"Ford's program would help end
the recession by increasing the
* spending power of Americans, but his
suggestions are not substantially
inflationary," Marshall declared.
Marshall praised Ford's proposal to
pay $BO to every person 18 years of
age and older whose incomes are too
small to file tax returns, calling it one
• of the better parts of his program.
"This proposal sets a precedent for
a negative income tax," Marshall said.
"It is a backdoor beginning."
'Very Progressive
Marshall also commended Ford's
proposed 1975 tax reduction, calling it
• a "very progressive' tax" since it will
benefit most lower income families.
For example, a family of four with
an income of $5600 now paying $lB5
in taxes wouldn't pay any taxes under
Ford's plan, while families earning
$40,000 will receive a 1.6 percent
# reduction, Marshall explained.
According to Marshall, low income
families are more inclined to spend
money saved from taxes than are
higher income families. Therefore,
Ford's proposed tax cuts would
particularly serve to pump more
Q money into the ailing economy, he
said.
But Marshall castigated Ford's
proposed refunds on 1974 taxes,
noting that while no refund will
exceed $lOOO, the bulk of the refunds
will go to middle and income
taxpayers who paid more taxes.
* Equal
Marshall suggested distributing the
$l2 billion in rebates equally among
all Americans, granting each citizen
$6O.
Business Prof. Paul H. Cootner,
however, said he wasn't bothered by
• the rebate plan, explaining that since
no payment will exceed $lOOO, the
proposal is reasonably progressive.
Cootner criticized Ford's plan to
impose levies on crude oil to increase
gasoline prices by 20 percent.
Since Ford proposes to increase
consumer spending power through his
tax plans, it is unrealistic to expect
people to purchase less gasoline,
Cootner explained.
When taken together with the tax

cutting proposals, the levy doesn't
make any sense at all," Cootner
commented. "The two will cancel each
other out."
'lnjured'
"The American economy has been
injured by the high price of fuel. The
theory is to reduce consumption and
pay less to foreign producers. But you
can't say you're helping yourself and
hurting foreigners when you raise the
prices."
But Marshall disagreed with
Cootner, claiming that most
Americans will spend their extra
money on staple commodities such as
food and clothing rather than on
gasoline.
Marshall also praised Ford's plan to
reduce corporation taxes from 48
percent to 42 percent.
According to Marshall, the tax
reductions will stimulate investment,
thereby easing unemployment.
Too Late
Cootner disparaged the
effectiveness of all of Ford's
anti-recessionary tax plans, insisting
they won't reach the public until May,
by which time the nation should be
emerging from the recession.
"That is the trouble with all fiscal
policy," Cootner said. "It takes so
long for its effects to be felt on
economy."
Cootner said one of Ford's most
constructive suggestions was his
proposal to study the possibility of
building storage facilities for oil. Such
installations would accomodate one
year's supply of oil and could be used
in the event of an Arab oil embargo,
Cootner said explained.
Marshall said one of the most
extraordinary aspects of Ford's
address was its lack of emphasis on
foreign affairs.
"I'm quite pleased with this,"
Marshall said. "Sometimes foreign
affairs can take care of themselves.
When we become excessively activist,
we often do the wrong thing."
But Political Science Prof. Gabriel
Almond said that by ignoring
international affairs in his address, the
President took a "narrow perspective"
of the nation's problems.
"The United States can't solve its
problems alone," Almond said. "Our
inflationary and recessionary policies
affect the international economy,
especially our relations with Europe.
Ford's bypassing of this dimension was
a real oversight."

Ford's plan, while families earning
$40,000 will receive a 1.6 percent
# reduction, Marshall explained.
According to Marshall, low income
families are more inclined to spend
money saved from taxes than are
higher income families. Therefore,
Ford's proposed tax cuts would
particularly serve to pump more
Q money into the ailing economy, he
said.
But Marshall castigated Ford's
proposed refunds on 1974 taxes,
noting that while no refund will
exceed $lOOO, the bulk of the refunds
will go to middle and income
taxpayers who paid more taxes.
* Equal
Marshall suggested distributing the
$l2 billion in rebates equally among
all Americans, granting each citizen
$6O.
Business Prof. Paul H. Cootner,
however, said he wasn't bothered by
• the rebate plan, explaining that since
no payment will exceed $lOOO, the
proposal is reasonably progressive.
Cootner criticized Ford's plan to
impose levies on crude oil to increase
gasoline prices by 20 percent.
Since Ford proposes to increase
consumer spending power through his
tax plans, it is unrealistic to expect
people to purchase less gasoline,
Cootner explained.
When taken together with the tax

cutting proposals, the levy doesn't
make any sense at all," Cootner
commented. "The two will cancel each
other out."
'lnjured'
"The American economy has been
injured by the high price of fuel. The
theory is to reduce consumption and
pay less to foreign producers. But you
can't say you're helping yourself and
hurting foreigners when you raise the
prices."
But Marshall disagreed with
Cootner, claiming that most
Americans will spend their extra
money on staple commodities such as
food and clothing rather than on
gasoline.
Marshall also praised Ford's plan to
reduce corporation taxes from 48
percent to 42 percent.
According to Marshall, the tax
reductions will stimulate investment,
thereby easing unemployment.
Too Late
Cootner disparaged the
effectiveness of all of Ford's
anti-recessionary tax plans, insisting
they won't reach the public until May,
by which time the nation should be
emerging from the recession.
"That is the trouble with all fiscal
policy," Cootner said. "It takes so
long for its effects to be felt on
economy."
Cootner said one of Ford's most
constructive suggestions was his
proposal to study the possibility of
building storage facilities for oil. Such
installations would accomodate one
year's supply of oil and could be used
in the event of an Arab oil embargo,
Cootner said explained.
Marshall said one of the most
extraordinary aspects of Ford's
address was its lack of emphasis on
foreign affairs.
"I'm quite pleased with this,"
Marshall said. "Sometimes foreign
affairs can take care of themselves.
When we become excessively activist,
we often do the wrong thing."
But Political Science Prof. Gabriel
Almond said that by ignoring
international affairs in his address, the
President took a "narrow perspective"
of the nation's problems.
"The United States can't solve its
problems alone," Almond said. "Our
inflationary and recessionary policies
affect the international economy,
especially our relations with Europe.
Ford's bypassing of this dimension was
a real oversight."

President Ford's state of the union
address offered some novel
anti-recessionary plans while steering
clear of dangerously inflationary
nostrums, according to Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall.
"Ford's program would help end
the recession by increasing the
* spending power of Americans, but his
suggestions are not substantially
inflationary," Marshall declared.
Marshall praised Ford's proposal to
pay $BO to every person 18 years of
age and older whose incomes are too
small to file tax returns, calling it one
• of the better parts of his program.
"This proposal sets a precedent for
a negative income tax," Marshall said.
"It is a backdoor beginning."
'Very Progressive
Marshall also commended Ford's
proposed 1975 tax reduction, calling it
• a "very progressive' tax" since it will
benefit most lower income families.
For example, a family of four with
an income of $5600 now paying $lB5
in taxes wouldn't pay any taxes under
Ford's plan, while families earning
$40,000 will receive a 1.6 percent
# reduction, Marshall explained.

families are more inclined to spend
money saved from taxes than are
higher income families. Therefore,
