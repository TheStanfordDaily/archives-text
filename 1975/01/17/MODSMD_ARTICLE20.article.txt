## Taj Mahal At Mem Aud Blues Singer Expands Musical Style 
### DAVE SMITH 
There was once a blues singer
with the unlikely name of Taj
Mahal who used old country blues
standards and his own
compositions in a warm, personal
style that was almost irresistable.
Then he started to expand his
music. He added a bit of reggae,
some rock, a trace of Mexican
music, some dubious French and
Spanish vocal lines and a little of a
lot of other things and he hasn't

been quite as good since.
Taj is still capable of putting
on a good show, as he
demonstrated before a sellout
Mem Aud crowd Wednesday
night. But Taj's vocals, which have
always been his greatest appeal,
were often sloppy and usually not
up to his best performances.
Taj opened his show with solo
performances of three numbers,
including two of his very best
songs, "Fishin' Blues" and "Ain't

Nobody's Business But My Own."
Perhaps Taj is tired of singing
these after all, he's been using
them as his mainstays for about
five years but for whatever
reason they lacked the appeal of
the original versions.
Talked And Growled
Mahal more talked (and
growled) than sang on "Fishin'
Blues." And while 'Ain't
Nobody's Business" will always be
a great pleasure-seekers' anthem,
Taj left out the most fun part of

all: the rap about the car "wit'
windows you can see out can't
nobody see in."
Taj brought out his six-man
backup band (guitar, bass, drums,
percussion, keyboards and
saxophones) and launched into a
couple of reggae numbers.
Although he does reggae with
considerably more style than most
rock groups that have dabbled in
the Jamaican form, he is simply
not a great reggae singer.
Part of the problem might have

been Taj's tendency to slur his
words and sing in a generally lazy
style, something that the best
Jamaican singers, like Jimmy Cliff
and Bob Marley, do not do. At
any rate, reggae is not Mahal's
forte.

His harmonica playing on
"Going Up to the Country and
Paint My Mailbox Blue," though,
was as spirited as ever. Taj has a
very distinctive style on the
mouth harp and it fits his singing
well: at best, both are infectiously
happy.
Many of his newer numbers are
rather mixed-up compositions.
For example, Taj and his band
performed a song called "Cajun
Waltz" that wasn't really a
cajun-styled tune, sung in French
that wasn't really French, and in
general lacking the verve that
made his work on Sounder and
the album The Real Thing such a
joy.
The highlight of the show, in
fact, was a revamped version of
Taj's exquisite older tune "Ain't
Gwine to Whistle Dixie Any Mo'),
to which he has added a vocal
line. The song and Taj's soft vocal
enveloped the audience in a very
peaceful mood.
Capable Band
Mahal's present band is
capable, especially reedman Ray
Cosrick, who added several good
solos, particularly on soprano
saxophone. But it doesn't push
Taj the way Howard Johnson's
tuba and his fine horn section did
on The Real Thing.
Someone, too, ought to push
Taj away from his current style of
collecting all sorts of musical
influences. Anyone capable of
writing the beautiful blues that he
has done doesn't need all the
other musical frills Taj has added.
Opening the show were a
talented a capella singing group,
the Street Corner Symphony,
composed of five Watts residents.
Their best item saw them putting
'sos music in proper perspective,
as they sang a number of those
horrible songs with a fine sense of
humor.
