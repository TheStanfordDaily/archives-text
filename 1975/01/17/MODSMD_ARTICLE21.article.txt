# Adventurous Blues Succeed At Cal
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
A single man, dressed in
African costume and his face
painted red and green enters the
stage and walks slowly around the
collection of musical instruments
there. He picks up a conch shell and
blows a few tentative notes on it,

then begins to pound out rhythms
on a pair of conga drums.
Two others appear, the first
his face also painted dancing to
the drummer's music, the second
walking crouched, concealed by a
huge aluminum sheet he carries.
As the three turn to small
marimbas and play repeating
percussive patterns, a fourth man
enters, clad in ordinary city attire
but with an absurdly large bow
tie. He listens, puzzled, to the
rhythms around him, then spots a
tambourine, tests its sound, and
starts to beat it gently.
The fifth to enter walks on
somberly and, after a brief look at
the stage, begins to play long
notes on the> saxophone he has
carried on. The bow-tied man
picks up a trumpet and blows on
it.

As his horn hisses and sputters,
the percussion patterns die down.
One of the marimba players
readies a string bass, another
mounts a drum kit. The third
beats lightly on a gong. Suddenly
he picks up a tenor sax.
As the two saxaphonists begin
to play blues, the drummer hits
his cymbals, the bass player
thumps authoritatively and the
trumpeter blasts off on a searing
solo.

They are the Art Ensemble of
Chicago, as they opened their
performance at Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium last
Saturday. Combining outstanding
musicianship with sometimes
engaging, sometimes exasperating
theatrics, the Art Ensemble
proved that, if nothing else, they
are a uniquely creative element of
the jazz avant-garde.
The roots of the Ensemble's
music are far-reaching indeed: the
free jazz of John Coltrane and
Ornette Coleman and the much
older blues tradition can be heard

clearly in the playing of
saxophonists Roscoe Mitchell and
Joseph Jarman and trumpeter
Lester Bowie, and the
expertly-played battery of
percussion instruments, from
oriental gongs to inner-city brake
drums, give the music a constantly
changing base.
Their music also contains
frequent passages of the
unexpected: Mitchell's atonal alto
sax excursion interrupted as the
other musicians enter, dressed as
New Year's Eve revelers and
blowing party horns; drummer
Don Moye, during a solo, beating
the air furiously with his brushes,
failing at an imaginary cymbal;
Bowie screaming through a
trumpet and a flugelhorn at the
same time.
Bowie is one of the strongest
trumpeters in jazz; he is capable
over an amazing range, from
scorching high-register yells to
delicate muted purrs. On an
instrument that has proved
difficult for free-jazz players.
Bowie vents his musical ideas with
considerable force.
Jarman and Mitchell are an
impressive duo: rarely do two
such gifted saxophonists perform
together, and even more rarely do
they interact so well. They

explore the full range of reed
instruments (between them, they
play nine different woodwinds)
without ever sounding like
dilletantes.
Jarman's solo performance,
backed only by bassist Malachi
Favors, was the work of a
virtuoso. He started on tenor sax,
blowing short bursts with Favors
pounding behind. His solo grew
more intense until it became a
steady stream of stacatto notes,
highs following lows in furious
progression.
After he had explored
seemingly to the limits of he
tenor's possibilities, Jarman
turned to the bass clarinet. With
Favors bowing long notes on his
bass, Jarman wound down his
performance with deep, eerie
clarinet tones.
That is not to say, however,
that the Art Ensemble's musical
conceptions always succeed. When
Bowie ends a brilliant solo with a
collection of non-musical sounds
from his horn, is he putting the
audience on? At its most
pretentious, the music is a sort of
intellectual game that is more
baffling than enlightening.
The group's collective
improvisations, with each musician
playing furiously on his
instrument, were undeniably
forceful but hard to listen to: the
closest thing to them is John
Coltrane's almost frenzied
recording, Ascension.
I wish, though, that all groups
were as adventurous about their
music as the Art Ensemble. To
them, music is not a formula or
something to pacify an audience,
but a personal means of
expression that, when it succeeds,
catches the listener with the
power that only a master
craftsman with a great idea can
muster.

collection of non-musical sounds
from his horn, is he putting the
audience on? At its most
pretentious, the music is a sort of
intellectual game that is more
baffling than enlightening.
The group's collective
improvisations, with each musician
playing furiously on his
instrument, were undeniably
forceful but hard to listen to: the
closest thing to them is John
Coltrane's almost frenzied
recording, Ascension.
I wish, though, that all groups
were as adventurous about their
music as the Art Ensemble. To
them, music is not a formula or
something to pacify an audience,
but a personal means of
expression that, when it succeeds,
catches the listener with the
power that only a master
craftsman with a great idea can
muster.
A single man, dressed in
African costume and his face
painted red and green enters the
stage and walks slowly around the
collection of musical instruments
there. He picks up a conch shell and
blows a few tentative notes on it,

then begins to pound out rhythms
on a pair of conga drums.
Two others appear, the first
his face also painted dancing to
the drummer's music, the second
walking crouched, concealed by a
huge aluminum sheet he carries.
As the three turn to small
marimbas and play repeating
percussive patterns, a fourth man
enters, clad in ordinary city attire
but with an absurdly large bow
tie. He listens, puzzled, to the
rhythms around him, then spots a
tambourine, tests its sound, and
starts to beat it gently.
The fifth to enter walks on
somberly and, after a brief look at
the stage, begins to play long
notes on the> saxophone he has
carried on. The bow-tied man
picks up a trumpet and blows on
it.

As his horn hisses and sputters,
the percussion patterns die down.
One of the marimba players
readies a string bass, another
mounts a drum kit. The third
beats lightly on a gong. Suddenly
he picks up a tenor sax.
As the two saxaphonists begin
to play blues, the drummer hits
his cymbals, the bass player
thumps authoritatively and the
trumpeter blasts off on a searing
solo.

They are the Art Ensemble of
Chicago, as they opened their
performance at Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium last
Saturday. Combining outstanding
musicianship with sometimes
engaging, sometimes exasperating
theatrics, the Art Ensemble
proved that, if nothing else, they
are a uniquely creative element of
the jazz avant-garde.
The roots of the Ensemble's
music are far-reaching indeed: the
free jazz of John Coltrane and
Ornette Coleman and the much
older blues tradition can be heard

clearly in the playing of
saxophonists Roscoe Mitchell and
Joseph Jarman and trumpeter
Lester Bowie, and the
expertly-played battery of
percussion instruments, from
oriental gongs to inner-city brake
drums, give the music a constantly
changing base.
Their music also contains
frequent passages of the
unexpected: Mitchell's atonal alto
sax excursion interrupted as the
other musicians enter, dressed as
New Year's Eve revelers and
blowing party horns; drummer
Don Moye, during a solo, beating
the air furiously with his brushes,
failing at an imaginary cymbal;
Bowie screaming through a
trumpet and a flugelhorn at the
same time.
Bowie is one of the strongest
trumpeters in jazz; he is capable
over an amazing range, from
scorching high-register yells to
delicate muted purrs. On an
instrument that has proved
difficult for free-jazz players.
Bowie vents his musical ideas with
considerable force.
Jarman and Mitchell are an
impressive duo: rarely do two
such gifted saxophonists perform
together, and even more rarely do
they interact so well. They

explore the full range of reed
instruments (between them, they
play nine different woodwinds)
without ever sounding like
dilletantes.
Jarman's solo performance,
backed only by bassist Malachi
Favors, was the work of a
virtuoso. He started on tenor sax,
blowing short bursts with Favors
pounding behind. His solo grew
more intense until it became a
steady stream of stacatto notes,
highs following lows in furious
progression.
After he had explored
seemingly to the limits of he
tenor's possibilities, Jarman
turned to the bass clarinet. With
Favors bowing long notes on his
bass, Jarman wound down his
performance with deep, eerie
clarinet tones.

dilletantes.
Jarman's solo performance,
backed only by bassist Malachi
Favors, was the work of a
virtuoso. He started on tenor sax,
blowing short bursts with Favors
pounding behind. His solo grew
more intense until it became a
steady stream of stacatto notes,
highs following lows in furious
progression.
After he had explored
seemingly to the limits of he
tenor's possibilities, Jarman
turned to the bass clarinet. With
Favors bowing long notes on his
bass, Jarman wound down his
performance with deep, eerie
clarinet tones.
That is not to say, however,
that the Art Ensemble's musical
conceptions always succeed. When
Bowie ends a brilliant solo with a
collection of non-musical sounds
from his horn, is he putting the
audience on? At its most
pretentious, the music is a sort of
intellectual game that is more
baffling than enlightening.
The group's collective
improvisations, with each musician
playing furiously on his
instrument, were undeniably
forceful but hard to listen to: the
closest thing to them is John
Coltrane's almost frenzied
recording, Ascension.
I wish, though, that all groups
were as adventurous about their
music as the Art Ensemble. To
them, music is not a formula or
something to pacify an audience,
but a personal means of
expression that, when it succeeds,
catches the listener with the
power that only a master
craftsman with a great idea can
muster.
