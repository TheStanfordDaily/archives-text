duds from the previous year's films.

At the start of the new year, it's traditional for
reviewers both great and small to pick favorites and
duds from the previous year's films.
But this little treatise won't be like the others,
because I think readers are tired of having the 10
best, the five worst, the 13 most banal or the 22
most disaster-prone films written and rewritten
about. Instead, I'm going to make great sweeping
generalizations about the past year's trends, and
what can be expected in 1975, besides platitudes
about inflation and recession.
There was no recession in films in 1974. Box
office receipts were way up in the vicinity of 25
percent over 1973 but whether this was because
of increased quality of product, slightly increased
prices or the relative inexpensiveness of movies over
live entertainment is hard to pinpoint.
The Exorcist had a lot to do with box office
profits at the first of the year, with disasters and
violence taking over in the second half.
But there also seemed to be a trend toward a
revival of the "B" movie, a cheaply produced
feature film shown mainly at drive-ins, rural areas
and short runs in downtown theaters. Not too
many critics saw Truck Stop Women, who did "a
lot of heavy truckin' " by night, or Captain Kronos,
Vampire Hunter (nordic superman meets Dracula)
or The Teacher (she corrupted the morality of an
entire school).
The list could go on with titles such as
Policewoman, Big Bad Mama, Open Season and
Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry. In case anyone is curious
abut the fate of the youth movie craze and such
superstars of its brief period of box office
ascendence, Peter Fonda has now become Crazy
Larry, and even William Holden took the plunge in
Open Season, a film about hunting people rather
than animals.
These and many other similiar films came and
went at drive-ins all over the nation, and while not
racking up large grosses, were no flops either.
Which brings me around to The Texas Chainsaw

Massacre, the most notorious of the cheapies, at
least in the Bay Area. People go to see such films
out of curiosity, because you're never going to see
something like that on TV, which is basically why
these inexpensive films can make money.
People want to see a little sex and nudity, and a
dab of violence, all enough for a good strong R
rating. Add a dash of expletives that have been
sanctioned in the Oval Office and you have a little
money maker, whether it's called Rampaging
Nurses, Savage Sisters or Macon County Line.
The Black film seems to have settled into this
grade "B" format, with a few notable exceptions in
1974, like Uptown Saturday Night It followed the
other road to success, packing the cast with big
name stars, even if they have minor parts.
The list of disaster movies with all star casts is as
endless as the earthquakes, collisions, fires and
kidnappings that he cast has to overcome. Richard
Lester's Juggernaut was the only one of the genre
that kept all elements under control, and receives
my nomination for best disaster of the year.
While talking about bests, I'll name the movie
that was overall the most satisfying to me in 1974,
Chinatown. The ambience of Los Angeles in the
19305, the performances the editing all were
first-rate, a technical and aesthetic triumph for
Roman Polanski.
The worst film of 1974 had to be The
Klansman, a distorted piece of cinematic trash with
attempted to be based on the William Bradford
Huie novel of the same name. Lee Marvin was
puzzled and Richard Burton was so drunk he
slurred most of his lines, and its portrait of the
modern south, to borrow from Randy Newman's
song "Rednecks," "didn't know its ass from a hole
in the ground."
That's the best and the worst, but remaining are
the state of hard-core pron, and what to expect in
1975, which looks to be the year of the sequel.
Those topics will be discussed in part two of the
treatise.
