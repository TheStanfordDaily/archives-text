## It's The Cage Weekend 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The weekend comes early this
year. Maybe too early.
For when the Cards take the
floor against second-ranked UCLA
at 8 p.m. tonight, they will have
only played together as a full
team for six. games this year,
Rich Kelley's flu and Melvin
Arterberry's misfortune having
crimped the rest.
And the Cards will be playing
their first real home games. Oh
sure, a magnificent three of

Stanford's first 12 contests have
been played at Maples Pavilion.
But one of them was during
Thanksgiving weekend, two
during Christmas break, and none
had the kind of student support
needed to make them real home
games.
Tonight, a sellout crowd will
watch the Cards play the
second-ranked Bruins. If you
don't have a ticket, well, there's
always Don Klein, who will
announce the game on KSFO

(560).
Tomorrow, the Cards host
fifth-ranked USC. Some reserved
seats remain on sale.
Stanford matches up
remarkably well with UCLA. The
teams are especially similar at
guard, where Andre McCarter and
Pete Trgovich don't usually score
much, but handle the ball well
and play good defense, just like
Arberberry and Mark Gilberg.
At center, Rich Kelley, for one
of the rare times in his life, will be
the little guy. UCLA's Ralph
Drollinger is listed at 7-1 and may
be taller. Drollinger is a good
rebounding center who does not
shoot as much as the average
Pac-8 big man.
The Bruins' points come from
the forwards. Senior Dave Meyers
(17.8) could be the best at his
position in the Pac-8. Meyers
shoots well, can rebound, play
defense and force turnovers.
The Bruins' other two forwards
are nearly as good, and are the
team's second and third highest
scorers. Richard Washington (13.8)
has been starting, but when
Marques Johnson (11.5) comes
off the bench, look out.
Wooden's wonders also have
especially good depth, and if
tonight's referees are
whistle-happy, Stanford will
suffer by the loss of its
first-stringers far more than
UCLA.
Once-beaten USC is quicker
than either Stanford or UCLA.
The Trojans are led by a hotshot
guard, Gus Williams, who averages

18.1. Williams can both drive well
and shoot from outside.
The other four Trojan starters,
forwards John Lambert and Bob
Trowbridge, center Clint
Chapman, and guard Biff Burrell,
all average over 10 points per
game. USC as a team averages a
phenomenal 92.1 points. If the
aggressive Trojans have a
weakness, it is defense. In two
games against common foes, USC
has outscored Stanford both
times— but the opponents have

also scored more against USC.
Should Stanford lose the
UCLA game, it will enter the USC
game knowing it must win to stay
alive in the Pac-8 race. It would be
nearly impossible for the team to
come back from a three-game
deficit to win the league crown.
So perhaps this weekend comes
too early.
But if at least one upset
doesn't happen now, whatever
Stanford does from here on in, it
may be too late.
