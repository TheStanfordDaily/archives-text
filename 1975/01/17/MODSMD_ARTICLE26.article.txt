# Pac-8 Predictions

Ah, may we be permitted to
dream a bit...
Our fearful forecaster
fearlessly predicts that Stanford
will defeat UCLA tonight before
a roaring Maples Pavilion crowd.
The Cardinals do so, by the
exact score we predict.
It sounds almost too good to
be true. It is too good to be true.
As of right now, we haven't
figured out whether it's worth
probably looking dumb to do it.
Stanford and UCLA have
about equal guards, and for
defense, we think Gilberg and
Arterberry might even have
McCarter and Trigonometry, or
whatever his name is, beat.
We'll take Kelley over

Drollinger at the post. At one
forward, Schweitzer is about
equal to Meyers. But at the
other forward, Johnson and
Washington have Trobbe and
blank beat all to hell.
Oh well. Stanford's starters
are almost a good match. And
maybe a rare Maples Pavilion
sellout crowd will do it for us.
Of course, if the Cardinals
beat UCLA, there's no way
they'll beat SC. Too much to
hope for from an inconsistently
consistent team.
Predictions
Stanford 78, UCLA 77
USC 91, Stanford 84
USC 83, Cat 81
UCLA 90, Cat 72
WSU 67, Oregon St. 65
Washington 68, Oregon 66
