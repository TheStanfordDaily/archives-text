# Swimming, Polo: Different Strokes
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
In what is annually one of the
most interesting meets of the
year, Stanford's swim team takes
on Washington in Seattle today.
The Huskies, who last week fell
to both USC and UCLA, promise
to be a major obstacle in
Stanford's path, "particularly if
their times are close to what they
did against SC and UCLA," Card
coach Jim Gaughran said.
The prospects of freshman ace
Mike Bruner pitted against
Washington's Olympian Robin
Backhouse, possibly in the 500
freestyle, should make the meet
an interesting one.
Oddly enough, just as Stanford
heads into the bulk of its tough
dual meet schedule, water polo
coach Art Lambert is getting
ready to start winter workouts
with his squad.
In the past, the swimmers and
the water polo players were
virtually the same individuals,
whereas today, the two sports
attract almost entirely different
people.
Specialization
Why this separation? "I think a
lot of the reason behind it is the
increased specialization of today's
athlete," speculates Gaughran,
"and this is largely because of the
increased number of summer
water polo programs.
"Ten years ago, a swimmer
could work out all summer and
still play water polo, but today, a
water polo player and swimmer
almost have to play their sport
in the summer."
Lambert agrees, pointing out
that the most successful West
Coast polo schools, such as USC,
Cal and San Jose State, usually
play together in the summer.
What about Stanford? "Things are
really looking great for our
summer program," he says.
Both coaches have at one time
or another coached both sports
(Gaughran at Stanford and
Lambert at DeAnza JC). "As a
player and a coach," notes
Gaughran, "I always liked both
equally well, and the change in
the season made it feel like a fresh
start for me."
Lambert, who prefers water
polo, points out that coaching the
sports require different talents.
"A swimming coach must be a

little more concerned with the
psychological and motivational
aspects of his sport," he says.
What about the
themselves? Most of them have at
one time or another participated
in both sports, but have generally
gravitated to either one or the
other, depending on their
preference and success.
There are, of course, notable .
exceptions, such as Dean*
Anderson, Craig Van Zandt, and
Paul Clark, but even they are
generally considered to have a
"best" sport. "The two sports
really don't have much in
common," says Lambert, "other
than the fact that they're both •
played in the water and you have
to know how to swim."
Monotonous, But...
Despite the unglamorous
aspect of the monotonous and
grueling workouts, Gaughran feels
that swimming's attraction rests 0
partly on the fact that "an
individual is able to see his
improvement from day to day."
Reflecting on the self-inflicted
punishment of the agonizing
workouts, distance man Steve
Strong philosophizes that one g
"can get pleasure out of
accomplishing any difficult
thing."
Water polo, on the other hand,
is particularly attractive because
of the variety of workouts, and
because, according to Brian Roux
(a butterfly specialist who played
water polo last year), "It's a team
sport."
Athletic Creativity
Lambert also brought up the
"team" aspect of the sport,
pointing out that team sports
require a certain amount of
"athletic creativity."
Both Roux and Lambert allude
to the cut-and-dry certainties of
swimming. "In polo," says Roux,
"you know that you can make a
mistake early in the game and still
be able to make up for it."
"In swimming," elaborates
Lambert, "if my guy can swim
100 yards in 51 seconds and yours
can do it in 48 seconds, there's
not much doubt who will win.
But in water polo, I know thatS
there's always a chance that my
team, even if it's not as good as
the other team, can still win."

played in the water and you have
to know how to swim."
Monotonous, But...
Despite the unglamorous
aspect of the monotonous and
grueling workouts, Gaughran feels
that swimming's attraction rests 0
partly on the fact that "an
individual is able to see his
improvement from day to day."
Reflecting on the self-inflicted
punishment of the agonizing
workouts, distance man Steve
Strong philosophizes that one g
"can get pleasure out of
accomplishing any difficult
thing."
Water polo, on the other hand,
is particularly attractive because
of the variety of workouts, and
because, according to Brian Roux
(a butterfly specialist who played
water polo last year), "It's a team
sport."
Athletic Creativity
Lambert also brought up the
"team" aspect of the sport,
pointing out that team sports
require a certain amount of
"athletic creativity."
Both Roux and Lambert allude
to the cut-and-dry certainties of
swimming. "In polo," says Roux,
"you know that you can make a
mistake early in the game and still
be able to make up for it."
"In swimming," elaborates
Lambert, "if my guy can swim
100 yards in 51 seconds and yours
can do it in 48 seconds, there's
not much doubt who will win.
But in water polo, I know thatS
there's always a chance that my
team, even if it's not as good as
the other team, can still win."
In what is annually one of the
most interesting meets of the
year, Stanford's swim team takes
on Washington in Seattle today.
The Huskies, who last week fell
to both USC and UCLA, promise
to be a major obstacle in
Stanford's path, "particularly if
their times are close to what they
did against SC and UCLA," Card
coach Jim Gaughran said.
The prospects of freshman ace
Mike Bruner pitted against
Washington's Olympian Robin
Backhouse, possibly in the 500
freestyle, should make the meet
an interesting one.
Oddly enough, just as Stanford
heads into the bulk of its tough
dual meet schedule, water polo
coach Art Lambert is getting
ready to start winter workouts
with his squad.
In the past, the swimmers and
the water polo players were
virtually the same individuals,
whereas today, the two sports
attract almost entirely different
people.
Specialization
Why this separation? "I think a
lot of the reason behind it is the
increased specialization of today's
athlete," speculates Gaughran,
"and this is largely because of the
increased number of summer
water polo programs.
"Ten years ago, a swimmer
could work out all summer and
still play water polo, but today, a
water polo player and swimmer
almost have to play their sport
in the summer."
Lambert agrees, pointing out
that the most successful West
Coast polo schools, such as USC,
Cal and San Jose State, usually
play together in the summer.
What about Stanford? "Things are
really looking great for our
summer program," he says.
Both coaches have at one time
or another coached both sports
(Gaughran at Stanford and
Lambert at DeAnza JC). "As a
player and a coach," notes
Gaughran, "I always liked both
equally well, and the change in
the season made it feel like a fresh
start for me."
Lambert, who prefers water
polo, points out that coaching the
sports require different talents.
"A swimming coach must be a

little more concerned with the
psychological and motivational
aspects of his sport," he says.
What about the
themselves? Most of them have at
one time or another participated
in both sports, but have generally
gravitated to either one or the
other, depending on their
preference and success.
There are, of course, notable .
exceptions, such as Dean*
Anderson, Craig Van Zandt, and
Paul Clark, but even they are
generally considered to have a
"best" sport. "The two sports
really don't have much in
common," says Lambert, "other
than the fact that they're both •
played in the water and you have
to know how to swim."
