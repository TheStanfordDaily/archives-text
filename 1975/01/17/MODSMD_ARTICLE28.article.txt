# Oregon Outclasses Cardinal Wrestlers
## 
### MARK FUNK 
Stanford ran into wrestling's version of the kamikaze kids when it
gfell to sixth-ranked Oregon 36-3 Wednesday night in Maples Pavilion.
The Cards were simply destroyed. Oregon proved worthy of its
high national ranking.
Frankly, Wednesday's match was a contest that Stanford could not
win. The Ducks, a good bet to capture the Pacific Eight championship
tournament in late February, out-experienced, out-manned and in
general out-everythinged the Cards.
And although his presence in the Stanford lineup wouldn't have
changed the final results, the loss of Ail-American Chris Horpel to a
minor injury seemed to demoralize an already injury-plagued and
depleted squad. Two other front liners, Malcolm Scott and Bob

Keating, also sat out the match.
Only a superior effort by
142-pounder Ken Krebs prevented
a repeat of the shutout the Ducks
handed Stanford last year.
"Oregon's just a super team,"
head coach Joe DeMeo said after
the match, "They have a real good
shot at the Pac-B's." And as an
afterthought he added, "They
beat Berkeley worse then they
beat us."
The Krebs win was the high
point of the night. Gaining three
takedowns in the early going and
a near fall in the third period, he
simply overpowered Oregon's Paul
Keinonen, The final score was 9-3.
A pair of freshmen, Dave
Schmeling and Lester Yoshida,
also put on good shows before
succumbing to older, more
experienced, wrestlers.
Schmeling extended the Duck's
Susuma Haighihara into the third
period before running out of gas
and falling 13-6. DeMeo said it
was easily the 118 pounder's best
match of the year.
Yoshida, too, looked strong as
he wrestled two-time AAU
champion Joe Sade even for most
of their contest. He was defeated
7-2.
Tonight and Saturday, two of
the better matches of the year will
be held in Encina Gym.
This evening Southern Oregon,
a Northwest small-college power,
will be in town. The Cards will be
trying to boost their duel meet
record to 7-3 at the visitor's
expense. The match starts at 7:30
p.m. in Encina.
New Mexico, Cal
State-Bakersfield and Oregon
Tech gather in Encina Saturday at
2:00 p.m. for the first annual
Stanford Invitational.

gfell to sixth-ranked Oregon 36-3 Wednesday night in Maples Pavilion.
The Cards were simply destroyed. Oregon proved worthy of its
high national ranking.
Frankly, Wednesday's match was a contest that Stanford could not
win. The Ducks, a good bet to capture the Pacific Eight championship
tournament in late February, out-experienced, out-manned and in
general out-everythinged the Cards.
And although his presence in the Stanford lineup wouldn't have
changed the final results, the loss of Ail-American Chris Horpel to a
minor injury seemed to demoralize an already injury-plagued and
depleted squad. Two other front liners, Malcolm Scott and Bob

Keating, also sat out the match.
Only a superior effort by
142-pounder Ken Krebs prevented
a repeat of the shutout the Ducks
handed Stanford last year.
"Oregon's just a super team,"
head coach Joe DeMeo said after
the match, "They have a real good
shot at the Pac-B's." And as an
afterthought he added, "They
beat Berkeley worse then they
beat us."
The Krebs win was the high
point of the night. Gaining three
takedowns in the early going and
a near fall in the third period, he
simply overpowered Oregon's Paul
Keinonen, The final score was 9-3.
A pair of freshmen, Dave
Schmeling and Lester Yoshida,
also put on good shows before
succumbing to older, more
experienced, wrestlers.
Schmeling extended the Duck's
Susuma Haighihara into the third
period before running out of gas
and falling 13-6. DeMeo said it
was easily the 118 pounder's best
match of the year.
Yoshida, too, looked strong as
he wrestled two-time AAU
champion Joe Sade even for most
of their contest. He was defeated
7-2.
Tonight and Saturday, two of
the better matches of the year will
be held in Encina Gym.
This evening Southern Oregon,
a Northwest small-college power,
will be in town. The Cards will be
trying to boost their duel meet
record to 7-3 at the visitor's
expense. The match starts at 7:30
p.m. in Encina.
New Mexico, Cal
State-Bakersfield and Oregon
Tech gather in Encina Saturday at
2:00 p.m. for the first annual
Stanford Invitational.
