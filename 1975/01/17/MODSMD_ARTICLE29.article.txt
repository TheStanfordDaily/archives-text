# 'Hooker-less' Ruggers Play At UC-Davis
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
If you see Stanford rugby
coach Pete Kmetovic looking for a
1 hooker tonight, don't stop him.
Kmetovic needs one tomorrow at
1 p.m., when his Cards travel to
UC-Davis to face the Aggies.
No, the rugger huggers haven't
deserted the Cards. Kmetovic
needs a hooker to replace the
I injured Geb Church. Church was
sidelined for the remainder of the
year with a separated shoulder,
which required surgery.
In last weeks 33-4 home
opener victory over St. Mary's,
Church's defense made it possible
> for the Card backs to have one of
the wildest scoring parties in
Stanford rugby history.
"The losS of Church will hurt
us," Kmetovic said. "This was his
first season of rugby and he was
just great against St. Mary's."
. Kmetovic added that he'll use
either 2nd row John Carroll or
prop Bob Hertenstein to replace
Church.
After the Cards demolished St.
Mary's last Saturday, many fans
and ruggers were thinking about
the possibility of the first
1 undefeated rugby season in six
years. The timing couldn't be
better. Thanks to a quirk in the
schedule, the Cards play only two
road games all season (Davis and
USC) and both are contests that
the ruggers figure to win.
But Kmetovic isn't overlooking
the Aggies. "Davis usually has
some experienced people," he said
