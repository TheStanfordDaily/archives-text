# 'Replace Welfare Program'
## Shultz Urges Negative Income Tax 
### DAVE SMITH 
A negative income tax system,
administered in the same way as the
present federal income tax, should
replace existing social welfare
programs, former Treasury Secretary
George Shultz declared yesterday.
"Many of the present welfare
programs should be cashed
out—eliminated and replaced by direct
cash payments to the poor," Shultz
told a Bishop Auditorium audience.
"Those programs cashed out should
include at least federal aid for
dependent children, food stamps and

any new categorical programs, such as
the proposed 'transportation stamps,'
that Congress may pass," he said.
Shultz said the government should
establish a "break even point," an
income level that will determine
"where you pay the government and
where the government pays you." He
said that personal cost-of-living
deductions should be "revised upward
sharply" to reflect the rate of
inflation. .
Formula
According to Shultz, the
government should determine the

amount paid in negative income tax by
subtracting annual income from the
total of personal deductions. The
government should then pay half the
difference to the citizen.
This system would "make it
sensible for a person to get off welfare
and get to work," Shultz said. For every
additional $2 he made, he would lose
only $1 in negative income tax
benefits.
"A sweeping change in income
maintenance would make it possible
for the market system to work its
wonders," the former Treasury
Secretary stated. "If our welfare
programs are continued as they are
now, they will break the budget
without doing what they were
intended to do help the poor."
Shultz said many present assistance
programs are unfair because they
dictate to the poor how to spend their
money. "We ought to give the benefits
in direct cash payments to the poor,
and let them determine what they
spend it on," he added.
Opposition to the negative income
tax is likely to be strong from the
special-interest groups that now
support programs like food stamps,
Shultz declared.

"An interest group in housing or
food can base their campaign for
federal spending in the name of
welfare, using a few well-chosen
statistics," Shultz said.
"But we don't have to support
home builders or food producers in
the name of aid to the poor," he
added. "If the poor want to buy their
products, under the proposed program
they will be able to."
Shultz noted that the most
consistent supporters of food stamp
programs are congressmen from farm
districts.
Shultz said that total costs from all

federal social welfare programs could
reach $2O billion this year. "At the
same time, social insurance programs
like Social Security are hurting for
funds, and they'll soon be relying on
Treasury revenues."
"The negative income tax program,
if it's incorporated part and parcel into
the tax system, will not cost any more
than our present welfare system and
it will actually use far fewer employees
to make it run," he said.
The former cabinet member
criticized those who oppose the
negative income tax proposals because
of their fiscal conservatism. "You go
to endless sessions where people sit
around and criticize the government,
but that's not enough," he said.
"Economists have to realize that
politicians march to a different tune
their highest concern is equity, not a
sound market."

spend it on," he added.
Opposition to the negative income
tax is likely to be strong from the
special-interest groups that now
support programs like food stamps,
Shultz declared.
Well-Chosen Statistics
"An interest group in housing or
food can base their campaign for
federal spending in the name of
welfare, using a few well-chosen
statistics," Shultz said.
"But we don't have to support
home builders or food producers in
the name of aid to the poor," he
added. "If the poor want to buy their
products, under the proposed program
they will be able to."
Shultz noted that the most
consistent supporters of food stamp
programs are congressmen from farm
districts.
Shultz said that total costs from all

federal social welfare programs could
reach $2O billion this year. "At the
same time, social insurance programs
like Social Security are hurting for
funds, and they'll soon be relying on
Treasury revenues."
"The negative income tax program,
if it's incorporated part and parcel into
the tax system, will not cost any more
than our present welfare system and
it will actually use far fewer employees
to make it run," he said.
The former cabinet member
criticized those who oppose the
negative income tax proposals because
of their fiscal conservatism. "You go
to endless sessions where people sit
around and criticize the government,
but that's not enough," he said.
"Economists have to realize that
politicians march to a different tune
their highest concern is equity, not a
sound market."


George P. Shultz
A negative income tax system,
administered in the same way as the
present federal income tax, should
replace existing social welfare
programs, former Treasury Secretary
George Shultz declared yesterday.
"Many of the present welfare
programs should be cashed
out—eliminated and replaced by direct
cash payments to the poor," Shultz
told a Bishop Auditorium audience.
"Those programs cashed out should
include at least federal aid for
dependent children, food stamps and

any new categorical programs, such as
the proposed 'transportation stamps,'
that Congress may pass," he said.
Shultz said the government should
establish a "break even point," an
income level that will determine
"where you pay the government and
where the government pays you." He
said that personal cost-of-living
deductions should be "revised upward
sharply" to reflect the rate of
inflation. .
Formula
According to Shultz, the
government should determine the

amount paid in negative income tax by
subtracting annual income from the
total of personal deductions. The
government should then pay half the
difference to the citizen.
This system would "make it
sensible for a person to get off welfare
and get to work," Shultz said. For every
additional $2 he made, he would lose
only $1 in negative income tax
benefits.
"A sweeping change in income
maintenance would make it possible
for the market system to work its
wonders," the former Treasury
Secretary stated. "If our welfare
programs are continued as they are
now, they will break the budget
without doing what they were
intended to do help the poor."
Shultz said many present assistance
programs are unfair because they
dictate to the poor how to spend their
money. "We ought to give the benefits
in direct cash payments to the poor,
and let them determine what they
spend it on," he added.
