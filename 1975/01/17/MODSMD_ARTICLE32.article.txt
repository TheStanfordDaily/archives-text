# Third Period Outburst Tops Hockey Team
## 
### JEFF BOOTHE 
A carbon copy of the
third-period onslaught which
paced the Stanford Hockey Club's
7-2 win over Stockton Sunday
proved fatal to the team Tuesday
night at Belmont against San
Diego State.
The Cardinals were buried 7-2
after the Aztecs scored six
third-period goals.
For two periods Stanford
outplayed the physical Aztecs in a
game marred by 30 penalty
minutes, 20 of which were
whistled against San Diego. But
Stanford failed to cash in on any
of its numerous power-play
opportunities, and at the end of
two periods the team led only 2-1,
on goals by Danny Schley and
Tom Heckler.
In the third period, Cardinal
fortunes diminished when the
Aztecs decided to play hockey
instead of participate in a street
brawl.
Only 26 seconds after the
period began, Dan Coxe flipped a
soft shot at Stanford goalie Mike
Sexton. The puck took a freak
bounce over his stick and into the
net to tie the game. Five minutes
later, the Aztecs scored again on a
breakaway goal by Dan Zukaitis
and thereafter never looked back.
Stanford coach Pat Baldwin
explained, "I don't think we were
motivated to play a physical
game. We weren't aggressive in the
closing period and they beat us to
the puck every time.
"Our power play was inept.
Any time a team is shorthanded
for a total of 20 minutes (one
period) and you don't score,
something is wrong," Baldwin
said.
The Cards will play Santa Rosa
Feb. 2 in the Oakland Coliseum.
Santa Rosa is coached by Charles
Schultz's son, Monty.
The game will start at 4 p.m.
