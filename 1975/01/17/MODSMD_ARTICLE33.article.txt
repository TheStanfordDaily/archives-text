Ex-CIA Leader Blasts Critieism
WASHINGTON - The Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) opened an office to evaluate
information on American radical groups "only when
evidence appeared of their involvement with
subversive elements abroad," former CIA Director
Richard Helms said yesterday.
Helms said recent attacks against the agency are
irresponsible apd have distorted the facts.
He denied the agency, while under his direction,
ever engaged in any massive illegal domestic spying.
Sources on the Senate Armed Services
intelligence subcommittee said Helms minimized the
extent of CIA infiltration of dissident groups inside
the United States to a far greater extent than
William Colby, the agency's current director.
In testimony made public Wednesday, Colby said
the CIA inserted about 12 agents into various
"dissident" groups and created files on some 10,000
Americans as part of the operation.

The source quoted Helms as saying some of the
penetration consisted merely of sending CIA
employees to a rally or demonstration.
Helms and Colby testified in private. But in a
prepared and publicly released statement, Helms
said the current controversy is endangering national
security and is based on "ruinous
misunderstandings" by some in the press.
"In normal few Americans would ever
come within the purview of our foreign intelligence
operations," Helms said.
"That happened only when evidence appeared of
their involvement with subversive elements abroad,"
he said.
U.S. Supplies Lebanon With Arms
WASHINGTON - The United States has
supplied Lebanon with a handful of highly
sophisticated antitank missiles and has under
consideration a Beirut request for antiaircraft guns,
it was learned yesterday.
According to administration and diplomatic
sources, "a very small number" of TOW missiles
have been sent to Lebanon over the past few
months.
The TOW is an extremely accurate and mobile
weapon which has been provided to Israel since the
middle of the 1973 Middle East war.
One source said fewer than two dozen TOW
launchers are in Lebanese hands.
He denied that this represented a major
departure from American policy not to upset the
military balance in the Middle East. It is not a
massive arms deal, the source said.
IRA Ends Cease-Fire
BELFAST, Northern Ireland The outlawed
Irish Republican Army (IRA) ended its 25-day-old
cease-fire at midnight last night. Shots were heard in
northern Belfast minutes before the truce expired,
but no outburst of violence was reported.
British soldiers in downtown Belfast said they
seized three men in a panel truck containing 47
pounds of explosives, a shotgun and 30 cartridges.
When the IRA announced earlier yesterday it
would not extend the cease-fire, authorities in
London alerted police and special bomb squads
throughout England and increased guards at public
buildings.
Government officials said they expected the IRA
to unleash a bomb attack in England rather than
Northern Ireland, and Scotland Yard has drafted
new plans to meet the anticipated onslaught.
A leader of the Ulster Defense Association said
the IRA decision to end the truce would reunify
Protestant militants.

"The IRA says their campaign is against the
British government and army," he said, "but if
bombing and shooting return to Protestant areas, .we
shall take effective action."
Sectarian violence has claimed well over 140 lives
in the past five and a half years in Northern Ireland.
Fifty-one persons have been killed by operations in
England attributed to the IRA.
Nations Welcome Ford Plan
LONDON The world's industrial nations have
welcomed President Ford's bid to halt economic
recession as a step in the right direction but there
are doubts whether his measures go far enough.
The British treasury in London declined to
comment officially on Ford's proposed tax cuts but
one government official said privately, "It is a start
anyway in the right direction.
"It will take some time before we see any effect
and it's never too late to make a start," he added.
Ford's measures were particularly welcome to
Britain's Laborite government. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Dennis Healey has long advocated
policies of putting more money back into people's
pockets to enable them to spend and thus stave off
recession and unemployment.
Demos Remove Two Chairmen
WASHINGTON Democrats voted to depose
two powerful House committee chairmen
yesterday, and one—Armed Services Chairman F.
Edward Hebert— vowed to carry an unprecedented
fight to save his job to the House floor.
In a major assault on the House seniority system,
the Democrats rejected Hebert's renomination 152
to 135 and that of House Agriculture chairman
W.R. Poage by a vote of 144 to 141.
But after rejecting two chairmen, they also
rejected a recommendation from the steering
committee that two other chairmen be dumped:
Wayne L. Hays of the Administration Committee
and Wright Patman of the Banking Committee.
Hebert, 73, from Louisiana, said he was the
victim of "a propaganda show" engineered by
Common Cause, a self-described citizens lobby, and
said he would carry his fight to the full House.
Poage, 75, from Texas, said he will not fight the
Democrats' action to remove him as chairman of the
Agriculture Committee.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with variable high clouds through
tomorrow but areas of night and morning fog with
local dense fog. Little temperature change. Lows in
the upper 30s and 40s. Highs both days in the 50s.
Light winds.

"dissident" groups and created files on some 10,000
Americans as part of the operation.

The source quoted Helms as saying some of the
penetration consisted merely of sending CIA
employees to a rally or demonstration.
Helms and Colby testified in private. But in a
prepared and publicly released statement, Helms
said the current controversy is endangering national
security and is based on "ruinous
misunderstandings" by some in the press.
"In normal few Americans would ever
come within the purview of our foreign intelligence
operations," Helms said.
"That happened only when evidence appeared of
their involvement with subversive elements abroad,"
he said.
U.S. Supplies Lebanon With Arms
WASHINGTON - The United States has
supplied Lebanon with a handful of highly
sophisticated antitank missiles and has under
consideration a Beirut request for antiaircraft guns,
it was learned yesterday.
According to administration and diplomatic
sources, "a very small number" of TOW missiles
have been sent to Lebanon over the past few
months.
The TOW is an extremely accurate and mobile
weapon which has been provided to Israel since the
middle of the 1973 Middle East war.
One source said fewer than two dozen TOW
launchers are in Lebanese hands.
He denied that this represented a major
departure from American policy not to upset the
military balance in the Middle East. It is not a
massive arms deal, the source said.
IRA Ends Cease-Fire
BELFAST, Northern Ireland The outlawed
Irish Republican Army (IRA) ended its 25-day-old
cease-fire at midnight last night. Shots were heard in
northern Belfast minutes before the truce expired,
but no outburst of violence was reported.
British soldiers in downtown Belfast said they
seized three men in a panel truck containing 47
pounds of explosives, a shotgun and 30 cartridges.
When the IRA announced earlier yesterday it
would not extend the cease-fire, authorities in
London alerted police and special bomb squads
throughout England and increased guards at public
buildings.
Government officials said they expected the IRA
to unleash a bomb attack in England rather than
Northern Ireland, and Scotland Yard has drafted
new plans to meet the anticipated onslaught.
A leader of the Ulster Defense Association said
the IRA decision to end the truce would reunify
Protestant militants.

"The IRA says their campaign is against the
British government and army," he said, "but if
bombing and shooting return to Protestant areas, .we
shall take effective action."
Sectarian violence has claimed well over 140 lives
in the past five and a half years in Northern Ireland.
Fifty-one persons have been killed by operations in
England attributed to the IRA.
Nations Welcome Ford Plan
LONDON The world's industrial nations have
welcomed President Ford's bid to halt economic
recession as a step in the right direction but there
are doubts whether his measures go far enough.
The British treasury in London declined to
comment officially on Ford's proposed tax cuts but
one government official said privately, "It is a start
anyway in the right direction.
"It will take some time before we see any effect
and it's never too late to make a start," he added.
Ford's measures were particularly welcome to
Britain's Laborite government. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Dennis Healey has long advocated
policies of putting more money back into people's
pockets to enable them to spend and thus stave off
recession and unemployment.
Demos Remove Two Chairmen
WASHINGTON Democrats voted to depose
two powerful House committee chairmen
yesterday, and one—Armed Services Chairman F.
Edward Hebert— vowed to carry an unprecedented
fight to save his job to the House floor.
In a major assault on the House seniority system,
the Democrats rejected Hebert's renomination 152
to 135 and that of House Agriculture chairman
W.R. Poage by a vote of 144 to 141.
But after rejecting two chairmen, they also
rejected a recommendation from the steering
committee that two other chairmen be dumped:
Wayne L. Hays of the Administration Committee
and Wright Patman of the Banking Committee.
Hebert, 73, from Louisiana, said he was the
victim of "a propaganda show" engineered by
Common Cause, a self-described citizens lobby, and
said he would carry his fight to the full House.
Poage, 75, from Texas, said he will not fight the
Democrats' action to remove him as chairman of the
Agriculture Committee.

WASHINGTON - The Central Intelligence

supplied Lebanon with a handful of highly
sophisticated antitank missiles and has under
consideration a Beirut request for antiaircraft guns,
it was learned yesterday.
According to administration and diplomatic
sources, "a very small number" of TOW missiles
have been sent to Lebanon over the past few
months.
The TOW is an extremely accurate and mobile
weapon which has been provided to Israel since the
middle of the 1973 Middle East war.
One source said fewer than two dozen TOW
launchers are in Lebanese hands.
He denied that this represented a major
departure from American policy not to upset the
military balance in the Middle East. It is not a
massive arms deal, the source said.
IRA Ends Cease-Fire
BELFAST, Northern Ireland The outlawed
Irish Republican Army (IRA) ended its 25-day-old
cease-fire at midnight last night. Shots were heard in
northern Belfast minutes before the truce expired,
but no outburst of violence was reported.
British soldiers in downtown Belfast said they
seized three men in a panel truck containing 47
pounds of explosives, a shotgun and 30 cartridges.
When the IRA announced earlier yesterday it
would not extend the cease-fire, authorities in
London alerted police and special bomb squads
throughout England and increased guards at public
buildings.
Government officials said they expected the IRA
to unleash a bomb attack in England rather than
Northern Ireland, and Scotland Yard has drafted
new plans to meet the anticipated onslaught.
A leader of the Ulster Defense Association said
the IRA decision to end the truce would reunify
Protestant militants.

"The IRA says their campaign is against the
British government and army," he said, "but if
bombing and shooting return to Protestant areas, .we
shall take effective action."
Sectarian violence has claimed well over 140 lives
in the past five and a half years in Northern Ireland.
Fifty-one persons have been killed by operations in
England attributed to the IRA.
Nations Welcome Ford Plan
LONDON The world's industrial nations have
welcomed President Ford's bid to halt economic
recession as a step in the right direction but there
are doubts whether his measures go far enough.
The British treasury in London declined to
comment officially on Ford's proposed tax cuts but
one government official said privately, "It is a start
anyway in the right direction.
"It will take some time before we see any effect
and it's never too late to make a start," he added.
Ford's measures were particularly welcome to
Britain's Laborite government. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Dennis Healey has long advocated
policies of putting more money back into people's
pockets to enable them to spend and thus stave off
recession and unemployment.
Demos Remove Two Chairmen
WASHINGTON Democrats voted to depose
two powerful House committee chairmen
yesterday, and one—Armed Services Chairman F.
Edward Hebert— vowed to carry an unprecedented
fight to save his job to the House floor.
In a major assault on the House seniority system,
the Democrats rejected Hebert's renomination 152
to 135 and that of House Agriculture chairman
W.R. Poage by a vote of 144 to 141.
But after rejecting two chairmen, they also
rejected a recommendation from the steering
committee that two other chairmen be dumped:
Wayne L. Hays of the Administration Committee
and Wright Patman of the Banking Committee.
Hebert, 73, from Louisiana, said he was the
victim of "a propaganda show" engineered by
Common Cause, a self-described citizens lobby, and
said he would carry his fight to the full House.
Poage, 75, from Texas, said he will not fight the
Democrats' action to remove him as chairman of the
Agriculture Committee.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with variable high clouds through
tomorrow but areas of night and morning fog with
local dense fog. Little temperature change. Lows in
the upper 30s and 40s. Highs both days in the 50s.
Light winds.
Ex-CIA Leader Blasts Critieism
WASHINGTON - The Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) opened an office to evaluate
information on American radical groups "only when
evidence appeared of their involvement with
subversive elements abroad," former CIA Director
Richard Helms said yesterday.
Helms said recent attacks against the agency are
irresponsible apd have distorted the facts.
He denied the agency, while under his direction,
ever engaged in any massive illegal domestic spying.
Sources on the Senate Armed Services
intelligence subcommittee said Helms minimized the
extent of CIA infiltration of dissident groups inside
the United States to a far greater extent than
William Colby, the agency's current director.
In testimony made public Wednesday, Colby said
the CIA inserted about 12 agents into various
"dissident" groups and created files on some 10,000
Americans as part of the operation.

The source quoted Helms as saying some of the
penetration consisted merely of sending CIA
employees to a rally or demonstration.
Helms and Colby testified in private. But in a
prepared and publicly released statement, Helms
said the current controversy is endangering national
security and is based on "ruinous
misunderstandings" by some in the press.
"In normal few Americans would ever
come within the purview of our foreign intelligence
operations," Helms said.
"That happened only when evidence appeared of
their involvement with subversive elements abroad,"
he said.
