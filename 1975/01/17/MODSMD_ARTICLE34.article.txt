# No New Leads In Perry Killing
## 
### 
Three months after Arlis Perry was murdered in
Memorial Church, the only news is that there's
nothing to report.
"We're at more or less a standstill," Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Capt. Frank Mosunic told the
Daily yesterday. He said two sergeants in his
Detective Division are still working on the case
part-time, but that "nothing significant" has been
turned up since immediately after the Oct. 12
slaying.
Perry, the 19-year-old wife of a Stanford student,
was found by a security guard opening the church
for Sunday worship services. She had been stabbed,
strangled and sexually assaulted.
Evidence from the murder site was analyzed by
FBI labs in Washington, and Mosunic says this could
prove important in determining the guilt of a
suspect. But, he said, "we have no good, firm
suspects at this time."
Stanford Police Lt. Walt Konar, also involved in
the investigation, said a more detailed analysis is still
expected from the FBI, including a possible set of
fingerprints taken from the murder scene. .
At the moment, though, "we're keeping our eyes
peeled" and re-examining details of the case.
Despite the time lapsed since the murder, he said,
"I still think it's just a matter of time. It's going to
be good, solid police work that cracks this case."
