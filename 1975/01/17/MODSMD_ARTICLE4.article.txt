# Faculty Senate Ponders Rules For Budget Cuts
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
settled down to discuss basic principles
they felt should be followed during
upcoming budget-trimming decisions.
Two and a half hours later, the only
matter they could formally agree upon
was to adjourn.
But during the lengthy session there
were some somber and hilarious
statements, and confusion frequently
surfaced.
Human Biology Prof. Colin
Pittendrigh proposed five resolutions
to the Senate in an attempt to focus
faculty sentiment.
'Responsibility'
"There is uneasiness [among the
faculty] not at the slomillion figure
- 1 - but at how immediate
administrative decisions will be made,"
Pittendrigh reported. "I think it would
be useful for the faculty to recognize
its responsibility in this matter .. . and
realize that it cannot discharge that
responsibility" to voice its opinions on
cutbacks.

Pittendrigh cited limitations on
time and organization as reasons that
faculty members could not make
thoughtful budget-cutting
recommendations.
"The crisis is such that time is a
luxury. We have been mistaken in
assuming that we could have any input
at all on the immediate crisis,"
Pittendrigh said.
Pittendrigh said he proposed the
resolutions to prevent a discussion of
"what we think life will be like in 10
years" instead of "substantive
matters."
Task Force
One of the resolutions would
establish a task force to study
University resource allocations and to
recommend appropriate action to the
Senate. I
"One of the task force's
recommendations could be to set up,
say, a Committee On .. . Resource
Allocation," Pittendrigh explained.
"Or, they could say that the existing
committee structure is sufficient."

President Richard Lyman then
suggested that such a move could put a
strain on administrators who should be
spending full time on budgeting
decisions.
"It does not seem possible that the
administration will be able to
shrink . . . and yet continue to support
increasing demands by the faculty,"
Lyman commented.
Misconstrued?
This prompted Senate Chairman
Gordon Craig to accuse Lyman of
misconstruing the purpose of the
proposed task force.
Lyman responded: "I did not
intend to say that the task force will
put this burden on the
administration ... I merely meant to
say that if it created such burdens, I
would consider it unwise."
On another matter, Classics Prof.
Ronald Mellor questioned
"unthinking" support for graduate
education programs.
Need For Review
"A committee might recommend
that perhaps there will be no graduate
education in the humanities in
1990... We are now assuming that
graduate education will be running
from now until doomsday," Mellor
commented.
Mellor also added that he had heard
that one department in the humanities
would not be allowed to admit
graduate students for 1975-76. Halsey
Royden, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, disputed the
statement.
"Rumors are circulating in the
faculty; I heard a new one from Mr.
Mellor," Royden commented. "It's
true that a decision of that sort is up
to the graduate dean, but I have not
heard any talk like that in my office."
Dean of Graduate Studies Lincoln
Moses could not be reached for
comment.
Chairman Statement
The Senate also discussed a
statement signed by 10 department
chairmen in the humanities and
sciences which urged rethinking of
budget priorities on a long-range basis.
"Is it time to announce that
Stanford can no longer serve the
'whole person,' but instead must be
primarily concerned with meeting the
intellectual needs of students?" the
chairmen asked.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs thought not.
"It seems to me that the business of
educating the_ 'whole person' has
always been a feature of private
universities ... and I hope it always
will be. It seems to me to be a false
dichotomy to say either 'you educate
the whole person' or 'you educate the
intellect,'" Gibbs remarked.
Political Science ( Prof. David
Abernethy questioned whether
campaign for Stanford goals will be
met, a basic assumption behind the
University's previously announced
three-year $lO million belt-tightening
program.
"I would like to see a university
which attempts to do well with
[diminishing] resources, Abernethy
maintained. "We cannot assume that
revenues will increase dramatically. I
wonder, therefore... if it is
reasonable to assume that the
University's $3OO million campaign
will be met."
