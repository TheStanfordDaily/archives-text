# Lag Less Than Five Feet Deep
## Low Rainfall Keeps Lake From Filling 
### BILL KNOKE 
Students who plodded out to Lake Lagunita for
their first sailing lesson this quarter beheld a
shocking sight: the lake was not brimming as it
usually is each year at this time.
In fact, the water is less than five feet deep. The
San Francisquito Creek flume opened for the first
time only last week, allowing water to spill into the
lake.
Usually Lake Lag, with a 100-million gallon
capacity, is half-full by Christmas day and reaches
its maximum depth of 15 feet by the beginning of
winter quarter.
The problem, said Jason Mavis, director of Plant
Services, is the unusually low rainfall this year. So
far there has been only 3.76 inches compared to
12.65 at this time last year. Searsville Lake normally
has 200 million gallons by this time, which permits
some of its water to be diverted to Lagunita.
Searsville Water
However, Searsville currently has only 135
million gallons. The Searsville water is critical for
irrigation and fire fighting on the Stanford campus,
as a backup system for neighboring communities, as
well as for the developer who leases the lake from
Stanford for recreational purposes.

As a result of the lack of rain, the water that is
currently entering Lake Lag is not the usual
Searsville overflow, but rather runoff that enters
San Francisquito Creek below both Felt and
Searsville Lakes that can be captured in no other
way. Even then, however, much of this runoff is not
captured because downstream residents have legal
rights to the water as well.
In addition, if the flow is too great, the 24-inch
flume under the Stanford golf course may get
clogged with debris or even wash out altogether. For
these reasons, Orvie P. Anderson, grounds manager,
said the gate is currently open only six inches.
"Unless it rains some more, Lagunita will not fill
up," predicted water technician Joe R. Carrington.
"At the present rate we would need six to eight
inches to fill the lake." Carrington said one and a
half to two inches would fill Searsville up to its 250
million gallon capacity and allow its spillover to be
diverted to Lag.
More Problems
Even when the lake is full the problem is still not
solved. This unusually dry season may make it
tough to keep the lake filled once it is full.
"Lagunita loses over one million gallons per day

due to natural seepage and evaporation so we have
to replace that amount to keep the lake full," Mavis
said.
The University uses an average of two and a half
million gallons a day of chlorinated water from the
Hetch Hetchey river and about one million a day
from Searsville for normal University operations,
including Lake Lagunita. But if the lakes are not
sufficiently full to allow water for Lagunita, it
would be the first to suffer.
Wells Abandoned
In the past, wells were used to supplement
Stanford's water supply in the dry season. However,
they've been gradually abandoned over the years in
the face of a $9O per-million-gallon water table
depletion tax.
Despite these apparent problems, many believe
that Lagunita will be filled to capacity this year.
Perry Hackett, environmental protection manager,
won't speculate on the future, but observed that
"I'Ve been here since the fall of 1961, and I've seen
Lagunita fill every year Maybe it does not fill as
fast as you like it to, but it's always been filled."
The lowest rainfall since World War II was only
7.15 inches in 1971-72 and Lagunita filled then.
Rainfall this year is already over half that so there
may be sailing yet.

depletion tax.
Despite these apparent problems, many believe
that Lagunita will be filled to capacity this year.
Perry Hackett, environmental protection manager,
won't speculate on the future, but observed that
"I'Ve been here since the fall of 1961, and I've seen
Lagunita fill every year Maybe it does not fill as
fast as you like it to, but it's always been filled."
The lowest rainfall since World War II was only
7.15 inches in 1971-72 and Lagunita filled then.
Rainfall this year is already over half that so there
may be sailing yet.
Students who plodded out to Lake Lagunita for
their first sailing lesson this quarter beheld a
shocking sight: the lake was not brimming as it
usually is each year at this time.
In fact, the water is less than five feet deep. The
San Francisquito Creek flume opened for the first
time only last week, allowing water to spill into the
lake.
Usually Lake Lag, with a 100-million gallon
capacity, is half-full by Christmas day and reaches
its maximum depth of 15 feet by the beginning of
winter quarter.
The problem, said Jason Mavis, director of Plant
Services, is the unusually low rainfall this year. So
far there has been only 3.76 inches compared to
12.65 at this time last year. Searsville Lake normally
has 200 million gallons by this time, which permits
some of its water to be diverted to Lagunita.
Searsville Water
However, Searsville currently has only 135
million gallons. The Searsville water is critical for
irrigation and fire fighting on the Stanford campus,
as a backup system for neighboring communities, as
well as for the developer who leases the lake from
Stanford for recreational purposes.

As a result of the lack of rain, the water that is
currently entering Lake Lag is not the usual
Searsville overflow, but rather runoff that enters
San Francisquito Creek below both Felt and
Searsville Lakes that can be captured in no other
way. Even then, however, much of this runoff is not
captured because downstream residents have legal
rights to the water as well.
In addition, if the flow is too great, the 24-inch
flume under the Stanford golf course may get
clogged with debris or even wash out altogether. For
these reasons, Orvie P. Anderson, grounds manager,
said the gate is currently open only six inches.
"Unless it rains some more, Lagunita will not fill
up," predicted water technician Joe R. Carrington.
"At the present rate we would need six to eight
inches to fill the lake." Carrington said one and a
half to two inches would fill Searsville up to its 250
million gallon capacity and allow its spillover to be
diverted to Lag.
More Problems
Even when the lake is full the problem is still not
solved. This unusually dry season may make it
tough to keep the lake filled once it is full.
"Lagunita loses over one million gallons per day

due to natural seepage and evaporation so we have
to replace that amount to keep the lake full," Mavis
said.
The University uses an average of two and a half
million gallons a day of chlorinated water from the
Hetch Hetchey river and about one million a day
from Searsville for normal University operations,
including Lake Lagunita. But if the lakes are not
sufficiently full to allow water for Lagunita, it
would be the first to suffer.
Wells Abandoned
In the past, wells were used to supplement
Stanford's water supply in the dry season. However,
they've been gradually abandoned over the years in
the face of a $9O per-million-gallon water table
depletion tax.
