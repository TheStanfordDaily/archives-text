## Save SWOPSI 
### 
The Daily opposes the recommendation by Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James L. Gibbs that the SWOPSI
program be discontinued in June.
We of course recognize that if the University is to avoid
disaster in the next few years, it must economize wherever it
is reasonably able to do so. But we also believe that doing
away with SWOPSI is the wrong way to start.
As SWOPSI Director Andrew Parnes put it Tuesday, "the
issue goes beyond just the dollars. It goes to the functions of
SWOPSI and whether J:hose functions could be performed
without an independent SWOPSI." We are inclined to
believe that the functions' Parnes spoke of would disappear if
SWOPSI is assimilated into various academic departments, as
Gibbs proposes.
And, because we favor the general principle of having
autonomous, innovative educational programs available to as
many students as possible, we would also urge an immediate,
extensive review of SCIRE and the Undergraduate Writing
Program before any decision is made to phase them out.
We are fearful that the elimination of programs such as
SWOPSI would tend to make Stanford more like any other
university a good one, of course but somehow less
appealing than it is today.
Students at most state-supported schools have never had
the chance to participate in programs like these, but they
don't pay nearly as much tuition as Stanford students do.
And if students here are going to have to pay $5500 in
tuition five years from now, then it would seem reasonable
to offer them the opportunity to design courese which they
want. SWOPSI offers this opportunity.
We recognize that some courses offered by SWOPSI have
been less than challenging and that others have had little, if
any, academic worth whatsoever. But this indicates that the
courses offered by Stanford's innovative education programs
should be more carefully reviewed, rather than done away
with completely.
In addition, a number of SWOPSI workshops have been
quite productive. For instance, one workshop wrote The
Other Stanford, an excellent study of the quality of
undergraduate education here. Another workshop published
a sweeping study of the impact of defense-related industries
in the Midpeninsula. Yet another laid the groundwork for
the financial and legal independence of the Daily.
Finally, some might contend that assimilating SWOPSI
workshops into academic departments wouldn't necessarily
kill the program. Baloney.
says the departments will have to take in these
workshops without receiving any additional funds to help
administer them. It's not very reasonable to expect that a
department would do away with one or more of its own
courses in order to free funds for a new, outside program.
So, goodbye workshops.
