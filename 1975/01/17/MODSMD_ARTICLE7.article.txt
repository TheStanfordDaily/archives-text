# More On Energy

### William Reynolds 
Terry Anzur's two articles on
the Institute for Energy Studies
(Daily, Jan. 12 and Jan. 13) were
most interesting but
unfortunately quite misleading
and contained important
misconceptions.
One could be led to think that
the function of the Institute is to
extract funds from oil companies.
In fact, the function of the
Institute is to focus and assist in
the development of energy-related
academic and research programs
here at Stanford, programs of
Stanford's design.
Oil companies, and other
energy companies that support
the Institute from their corporate
offices and foundations, such as
General Electric and Pacific Gas
and Electric, have a natural
interest in energy and therefore
we sought their assistance.
Assistance from mousetrap firms
would be sought if we thought
that they would help us do what
we want to do, but that would
not lead us to study mousetraps.
All of the corporations that
support the Institute have

long-standing traditions of
support for education. Standard
Oil of California, a principal
patron of the Institute, designated
all of its support for the Institute
for graduate and undergraduate
fellowships and a visiting
professor fund.
Contrary to the article, we do
not use Institute funds to support
the budget. The point of the
Institute is not to solve the
University's budget problems but
to build at Stanford an
intellectual base in energy science,
technology and policy that can
contribute to the solution of
national and world energy
problems.
We have taken over support of
Engineering 235 and directed its
projects toward energy problems.
The Institute's supporters are
fully aware of this, and we are not
secretly supporting the budget
base with their funds as the gross
misquotation of Dean Kays
suggests.
