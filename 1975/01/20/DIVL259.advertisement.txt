â€¢ Sausage Rossini
The renowned operatic composer Gioacchino Rossini was
an excellent cook as well; several dishes in the standard
repertory are his creations, and some of these retain his
name.
The story is told that one morning in his Paris flat, Rossini,
upon examining his larder, discovered that it held only a
humble Italian sausage and a tomato. None disconsoled, the
composer set to work, toasting some french bread, cooking
the sausage on a grill, and making up some tomato sauce
after his own recipe. Soon he was ready for his repast. But
something seemed to be missing. The great Rossini pon
dered.
A light of inspiration struck him. He bolted across the hall
and rapped at the door of Hector Berlioz, his neighbor at the
time, and a famous composer as well. The two are thought to
have not been speaking at the time (this was frequent), but
Berlioz suggested that Rossini might want to avail himself of
a brick of fine mozzarella cheese that Berlioz had brought
back from Italy. This seemed propituous to the composer; he
grated some of the cheese over his plate and dug in. (He
pointedjy did not invite Berlioz to join him.)
"Una bella forma!" Rossini exclaimed;
"Une jeu artifice," Berlioz muttered, wrong again.
?. Today at the Drone's Club you may have a sandwich very
> similar to the one Rossini and Berlioz came up with that
Parisian morning. And why not have with it a glass (or even
two) of some nice red Mne, of which we think Signor Rossini,
y - at least, would have much approved.
We have 4 special sandwiches along with our regular
meals and daily specials serving continuously from 11 am
v select beers and wines
