# Maples Miracle: Cards Down UCLA, USC
## Teamwork Produces Wins Over 'Top Five' Powers 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
And suddenly, the Maples floor whinged like a
trampoline as hundreds of crazed fans swarmed on
it and jumped on it to an inspired rendition of "All
Right Now."
And if one of those fans had gotten as high
physically as he or she was mentally, and actually
flown to the roof, it wouldn't have been as
surprising as the events which had just taken place.
Stanford 64, second-ranked UCLA 60.
Stanford 67, fifth-ranked USC 66.
The Cardinals might not have matched up
one-on-one with either of those talent banks, but
they formed the better team. They out-hustled and
out-disciplined their foes. Howie Dallmar even
out-coached John Wooden and Bob Boyd.
Stanford actually didn't play quite as well as it
did when losing to Oregon 78-77 last week. But
unlike past games, this time it was the opponents
who fell apart in the last minutes while Stanford
remained in control.
Take UCLA. (Stanford hadn't taken them since
1966). The Bruins stood around on offense like

Wooden's Indians, while Stanford moved the ball
around, properly working its offense.
During the first half of this game Friday night, it
didn't appear that the Bruins were in Stanford's
class. Rich Kelley made Ralph Drollinger look like
Jack Loomis, burning him for 16, while Ed
Schweitzer added 13.
The Bruins offense, meanwhile, did nothing
against the Cardinals' man-to-man. At the half,
Stanford led 37-24, and the score would have been
higher if the Cards hadn't committed 10 turnovers,
mostly on ill-advised and unnecessary fast breaks.
The Stanford band played "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing." Which was wishful thinking. UCLA
came back. UCLA always comes back.
With 15 minutes to play, the Bruins' zone press
began rattling the Cards. Stanford couldn't get the
ball across the time line, not because the press was
so good, but because the Cards began choking, just
like everyone does against UCLA.
UCLA scored 11 unanswered points to bring the
game to within four, at 45-41. Timeout Dallmar. "I
just reminded them that the press was the exact

same one we'd been beating in the first half."
End of choke. The two teams pretty much
traded baskets for the remainder, but UCLA never
broke the barrier of a four-point deficit.
Wooden, showing DeGaulle-like stubbornness,
refused to call a time out, never, not even when his
young Wonders desperately needed one to put their
offense back together.
With Ed Schweitzer blanketing top scorer Dave
Meyers, the only guy UCLA went to late in the
game was Rich Washington. He wasn't enough.
Dallmar's gamble, putting his taller forward
(Schweitzer) on UCLA's smaller one (Meyers) paid
off. As Kelley said, "Washington is good, but we
didn't think he could beat us. Only Meyers could
beat us.
Washington finished with 17, Meyers only 15. In
contrast, Kelley and Schweitzer netted 22 each.
Stanford The Team
Except for that one brief stretch when UCLA
was UCLA, Stanford had the class team; UCLA had
a bunch of talented individuals who didn't know

SWEEPING THE BOARDS—Stanford center Rich Kelley proved to the sports
world this weekend what hands on the Farm have been saying ever since he came
here: the big seven footer is of All-American calibre. USC center Steve Malovic
(42) found out when Kelley ripped this rebound from him (one of 28 he got
over the weekend plus 52 points) in the Card's 67-66 win over the Trojans
Saturday night.
