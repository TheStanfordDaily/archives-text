# Maples Miracle: Cards Down UCLA, USC
## Teamwork Produces Wins Over 'Top Five' Powers 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
And suddenly, the Maples floor whinged like a
trampoline as hundreds of crazed fans swarmed on
it and jumped on it to an inspired rendition of "All
Right Now."
And if one of those fans had gotten as high
physically as he or she was mentally, and actually
flown to the roof, it wouldn't have been as
surprising as the events which had just taken place.
Stanford 64, second-ranked UCLA 60.
Stanford 67, fifth-ranked USC 66.
The Cardinals might not have matched up
one-on-one with either of those talent banks, but
they formed the better team. They out-hustled and
out-disciplined their foes. Howie Dallmar even
out-coached John Wooden and Bob Boyd.
Stanford actually didn't play quite as well as it
did when losing to Oregon 78-77 last week. But
unlike past games, this time it was the opponents
who fell apart in the last minutes while Stanford
remained in control.
Take UCLA. (Stanford hadn't taken them since
1966). The Bruins stood around on offense like

Wooden's Indians, while Stanford moved the ball
around, properly working its offense.
During the first half of this game Friday night, it
didn't appear that the Bruins were in Stanford's
class. Rich Kelley made Ralph Drollinger look like
Jack Loomis, burning him for 16, while Ed
Schweitzer added 13.
The Bruins offense, meanwhile, did nothing
against the Cardinals' man-to-man. At the half,
Stanford led 37-24, and the score would have been
higher if the Cards hadn't committed 10 turnovers,
mostly on ill-advised and unnecessary fast breaks.
The Stanford band played "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing." Which was wishful thinking. UCLA
came back. UCLA always comes back.
With 15 minutes to play, the Bruins' zone press
began rattling the Cards. Stanford couldn't get the
ball across the time line, not because the press was
so good, but because the Cards began choking, just
like everyone does against UCLA.
UCLA scored 11 unanswered points to bring the
game to within four, at 45-41. Timeout Dallmar. "I
just reminded them that the press was the exact

same one we'd been beating in the first half."
End of choke. The two teams pretty much
traded baskets for the remainder, but UCLA never
broke the barrier of a four-point deficit.
Wooden, showing DeGaulle-like stubbornness,
refused to call a time out, never, not even when his
young Wonders desperately needed one to put their
offense back together.
With Ed Schweitzer blanketing top scorer Dave
Meyers, the only guy UCLA went to late in the
game was Rich Washington. He wasn't enough.
Dallmar's gamble, putting his taller forward
(Schweitzer) on UCLA's smaller one (Meyers) paid
off. As Kelley said, "Washington is good, but we
didn't think he could beat us. Only Meyers could
beat us.
Washington finished with 17, Meyers only 15. In
contrast, Kelley and Schweitzer netted 22 each.

was UCLA, Stanford had the class team; UCLA had

SWEEPING THE BOARDS—Stanford center Rich Kelley proved to the sports
world this weekend what hands on the Farm have been saying ever since he came
here: the big seven footer is of All-American calibre. USC center Steve Malovic
(42) found out when Kelley ripped this rebound from him (one of 28 he got
over the weekend plus 52 points) in the Card's 67-66 win over the Trojans
Saturday night.
what to do in a close game.
Perhaps because the Bruins
weren't invincible, Stanford's
locker room wasn't that joyous.
Mark Gilberg, best guard on the
floor all night, was especially
restrained.
"If we don't win tomorrow,"
he said, "this one doesn't mean a
thing."
The next night, 70 fewer fans
("only" 7843) showed up, but
they acted like a far bigger throng.
Those fat cats who only show up
for UCLA were gone; students
who stood in line for an hour or
more Saturday afternoon for
expensive seats took their places.
The SC game was an even
match throughout. The Trojans
couldn't stop Rich Kelley (30
points), but the Cards were
equally powerless against the
driving, passing and shooting of
guard Gus Williams.
USC's superfast break often
zoomed past the Stanford
defense. But if the break failed, if
someone stopped Williams, it was
over.

Stanford's man-to-man, as
usual, prevented its adversary
from getting good shots, and, not
as usual, the Cardinal zone
defense proved equally stingy.
Jay Carter, a 6-3 freshman,
looked especially great. Replacing

6-6 Scott Trobbe at forward for
most of the game, Carter stopped
6-8 Bob Trowbridge cold, while
hitting the only five shots he took
Carter suffered a cramp with
1:21 to play, one which outlasted
even the patient Dallmar, who
called a double time-out to give it
time to vanish.
So, after that pause, Stanford
inbounded the ball, leading 63-62,
and held it for awhile. At :39,
Stanford tried THE play, the one
where someone zooms through to
the backdoor and gets a lob pass
for a cripple. The ball got into
Trobbe, but Williams made a
superhuman leap to block the
shot against the boards, got down
faster than gravity to get the
rebound and began running
downcourt.
Williams, though, had
obviously stepped on the baseline.

The refs didn't call it at first. The
Stanford crowd did.
Stanford basketball fans had
arrived.
Ten seconds later, Kelley was
fouled. He calmly consummated a
one-and-one to give the Cards a
three point edge. USC got a quick
basket, but fouled Kelley again.
Rich calmly sank another
one-and-one.
It was over.
A bit more noise, this time,
eminated from the locker room,
especially from the friends of
frosh hero Carter. Kelley calmly
explained that to shoot free
throws as well as he does (he's hit
25 in a row) you "have to put
your mind in a fog."
Even their Eminences Lyman
and Hargadon trekked to the
locker room. Ah yes, Stanford
basketball has indeed arrived.

flown to the roof, it wouldn't have been as
surprising as the events which had just taken place.
Stanford 64, second-ranked UCLA 60.
Stanford 67, fifth-ranked USC 66.
The Cardinals might not have matched up
one-on-one with either of those talent banks, but
they formed the better team. They out-hustled and
out-disciplined their foes. Howie Dallmar even
out-coached John Wooden and Bob Boyd.
Stanford actually didn't play quite as well as it
did when losing to Oregon 78-77 last week. But
unlike past games, this time it was the opponents
who fell apart in the last minutes while Stanford
remained in control.
Take UCLA. (Stanford hadn't taken them since
1966). The Bruins stood around on offense like

Wooden's Indians, while Stanford moved the ball
around, properly working its offense.
During the first half of this game Friday night, it
didn't appear that the Bruins were in Stanford's
class. Rich Kelley made Ralph Drollinger look like
Jack Loomis, burning him for 16, while Ed
Schweitzer added 13.
The Bruins offense, meanwhile, did nothing
against the Cardinals' man-to-man. At the half,
Stanford led 37-24, and the score would have been
higher if the Cards hadn't committed 10 turnovers,
mostly on ill-advised and unnecessary fast breaks.
The Stanford band played "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing." Which was wishful thinking. UCLA
came back. UCLA always comes back.
With 15 minutes to play, the Bruins' zone press
began rattling the Cards. Stanford couldn't get the
ball across the time line, not because the press was
so good, but because the Cards began choking, just
like everyone does against UCLA.
UCLA scored 11 unanswered points to bring the
game to within four, at 45-41. Timeout Dallmar. "I
just reminded them that the press was the exact

same one we'd been beating in the first half."
End of choke. The two teams pretty much
traded baskets for the remainder, but UCLA never
broke the barrier of a four-point deficit.
Wooden, showing DeGaulle-like stubbornness,
refused to call a time out, never, not even when his
young Wonders desperately needed one to put their
offense back together.
With Ed Schweitzer blanketing top scorer Dave
Meyers, the only guy UCLA went to late in the
game was Rich Washington. He wasn't enough.
Dallmar's gamble, putting his taller forward
(Schweitzer) on UCLA's smaller one (Meyers) paid
off. As Kelley said, "Washington is good, but we
didn't think he could beat us. Only Meyers could
beat us.
Washington finished with 17, Meyers only 15. In
contrast, Kelley and Schweitzer netted 22 each.

SWEEPING THE BOARDS—Stanford center Rich Kelley proved to the sports
world this weekend what hands on the Farm have been saying ever since he came
here: the big seven footer is of All-American calibre. USC center Steve Malovic
(42) found out when Kelley ripped this rebound from him (one of 28 he got
over the weekend plus 52 points) in the Card's 67-66 win over the Trojans
Saturday night.
what to do in a close game.
Perhaps because the Bruins
weren't invincible, Stanford's
locker room wasn't that joyous.
Mark Gilberg, best guard on the
floor all night, was especially
restrained.
"If we don't win tomorrow,"
he said, "this one doesn't mean a
thing."
The next night, 70 fewer fans
("only" 7843) showed up, but
they acted like a far bigger throng.
Those fat cats who only show up
for UCLA were gone; students
who stood in line for an hour or
more Saturday afternoon for
expensive seats took their places.
The SC game was an even
match throughout. The Trojans
couldn't stop Rich Kelley (30
points), but the Cards were
equally powerless against the
driving, passing and shooting of
guard Gus Williams.
USC's superfast break often
zoomed past the Stanford
defense. But if the break failed, if
someone stopped Williams, it was
over.

Stanford's man-to-man, as
usual, prevented its adversary
from getting good shots, and, not
as usual, the Cardinal zone
defense proved equally stingy.
Jay Carter, a 6-3 freshman,
looked especially great. Replacing

6-6 Scott Trobbe at forward for
most of the game, Carter stopped
6-8 Bob Trowbridge cold, while
hitting the only five shots he took
Carter suffered a cramp with
1:21 to play, one which outlasted
even the patient Dallmar, who
called a double time-out to give it
time to vanish.
So, after that pause, Stanford
inbounded the ball, leading 63-62,
and held it for awhile. At :39,
Stanford tried THE play, the one
where someone zooms through to
the backdoor and gets a lob pass
for a cripple. The ball got into
Trobbe, but Williams made a
superhuman leap to block the
shot against the boards, got down
faster than gravity to get the
rebound and began running
downcourt.
Williams, though, had
obviously stepped on the baseline.

The refs didn't call it at first. The
Stanford crowd did.
Stanford basketball fans had
arrived.
Ten seconds later, Kelley was
fouled. He calmly consummated a
one-and-one to give the Cards a
three point edge. USC got a quick
basket, but fouled Kelley again.
Rich calmly sank another
one-and-one.
It was over.
A bit more noise, this time,
eminated from the locker room,
especially from the friends of
frosh hero Carter. Kelley calmly
explained that to shoot free
throws as well as he does (he's hit
25 in a row) you "have to put
your mind in a fog."
Even their Eminences Lyman
and Hargadon trekked to the
locker room. Ah yes, Stanford
basketball has indeed arrived.

MORE CROWDED THAN REG DAY—Fans swarmed over the floor of Maples Pavilion Saturday night, jumping up and down and noting
exactly who was, for this weekend at least, Number One. Why? The scoreboard (plus one the previous night) tells the story.

it and jumped on it to an inspired rendition of "All

they formed the better team. They out-hustled and
out-disciplined their foes. Howie Dallmar even
out-coached John Wooden and Bob Boyd.
Stanford actually didn't play quite as well as it
did when losing to Oregon 78-77 last week. But
unlike past games, this time it was the opponents
who fell apart in the last minutes while Stanford
remained in control.
Take UCLA. (Stanford hadn't taken them since
1966). The Bruins stood around on offense like

Wooden's Indians, while Stanford moved the ball
around, properly working its offense.
During the first half of this game Friday night, it
didn't appear that the Bruins were in Stanford's
class. Rich Kelley made Ralph Drollinger look like
Jack Loomis, burning him for 16, while Ed
Schweitzer added 13.
The Bruins offense, meanwhile, did nothing
against the Cardinals' man-to-man. At the half,
Stanford led 37-24, and the score would have been
higher if the Cards hadn't committed 10 turnovers,
mostly on ill-advised and unnecessary fast breaks.
The Stanford band played "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing." Which was wishful thinking. UCLA
came back. UCLA always comes back.
With 15 minutes to play, the Bruins' zone press
began rattling the Cards. Stanford couldn't get the
ball across the time line, not because the press was
so good, but because the Cards began choking, just
like everyone does against UCLA.
UCLA scored 11 unanswered points to bring the
game to within four, at 45-41. Timeout Dallmar. "I
just reminded them that the press was the exact

same one we'd been beating in the first half."
End of choke. The two teams pretty much
traded baskets for the remainder, but UCLA never
broke the barrier of a four-point deficit.
Wooden, showing DeGaulle-like stubbornness,
refused to call a time out, never, not even when his
young Wonders desperately needed one to put their
offense back together.
With Ed Schweitzer blanketing top scorer Dave
Meyers, the only guy UCLA went to late in the
game was Rich Washington. He wasn't enough.
Dallmar's gamble, putting his taller forward
(Schweitzer) on UCLA's smaller one (Meyers) paid
off. As Kelley said, "Washington is good, but we
didn't think he could beat us. Only Meyers could
beat us.
Washington finished with 17, Meyers only 15. In
contrast, Kelley and Schweitzer netted 22 each.

SWEEPING THE BOARDS—Stanford center Rich Kelley proved to the sports
world this weekend what hands on the Farm have been saying ever since he came
here: the big seven footer is of All-American calibre. USC center Steve Malovic
(42) found out when Kelley ripped this rebound from him (one of 28 he got
over the weekend plus 52 points) in the Card's 67-66 win over the Trojans
Saturday night.
what to do in a close game.
Perhaps because the Bruins
weren't invincible, Stanford's
locker room wasn't that joyous.
Mark Gilberg, best guard on the
floor all night, was especially
restrained.
"If we don't win tomorrow,"
he said, "this one doesn't mean a
thing."
The next night, 70 fewer fans
("only" 7843) showed up, but
they acted like a far bigger throng.
Those fat cats who only show up
for UCLA were gone; students
who stood in line for an hour or
more Saturday afternoon for
expensive seats took their places.
The SC game was an even
match throughout. The Trojans
couldn't stop Rich Kelley (30
points), but the Cards were
equally powerless against the
driving, passing and shooting of
guard Gus Williams.
USC's superfast break often
zoomed past the Stanford
defense. But if the break failed, if
someone stopped Williams, it was
over.

Stanford's man-to-man, as
usual, prevented its adversary
from getting good shots, and, not
as usual, the Cardinal zone
defense proved equally stingy.
Jay Carter, a 6-3 freshman,
looked especially great. Replacing

6-6 Scott Trobbe at forward for
most of the game, Carter stopped
6-8 Bob Trowbridge cold, while
hitting the only five shots he took
Carter suffered a cramp with
1:21 to play, one which outlasted
even the patient Dallmar, who
called a double time-out to give it
time to vanish.
So, after that pause, Stanford
inbounded the ball, leading 63-62,
and held it for awhile. At :39,
Stanford tried THE play, the one
where someone zooms through to
the backdoor and gets a lob pass
for a cripple. The ball got into
Trobbe, but Williams made a
superhuman leap to block the
shot against the boards, got down
faster than gravity to get the
rebound and began running
downcourt.
Williams, though, had
obviously stepped on the baseline.

The refs didn't call it at first. The
Stanford crowd did.
Stanford basketball fans had
arrived.
Ten seconds later, Kelley was
fouled. He calmly consummated a
one-and-one to give the Cards a
three point edge. USC got a quick
basket, but fouled Kelley again.
Rich calmly sank another
one-and-one.
It was over.
A bit more noise, this time,
eminated from the locker room,
especially from the friends of
frosh hero Carter. Kelley calmly
explained that to shoot free
throws as well as he does (he's hit
25 in a row) you "have to put
your mind in a fog."
Even their Eminences Lyman
and Hargadon trekked to the
locker room. Ah yes, Stanford
basketball has indeed arrived.

MORE CROWDED THAN REG DAY—Fans swarmed over the floor of Maples Pavilion Saturday night, jumping up and down and noting
exactly who was, for this weekend at least, Number One. Why? The scoreboard (plus one the previous night) tells the story.
And suddenly, the Maples floor whinged like a
trampoline as hundreds of crazed fans swarmed on
it and jumped on it to an inspired rendition of "All
Right Now."
And if one of those fans had gotten as high
physically as he or she was mentally, and actually
flown to the roof, it wouldn't have been as
surprising as the events which had just taken place.

who fell apart in the last minutes while Stanford
remained in control.
Take UCLA. (Stanford hadn't taken them since
1966). The Bruins stood around on offense like

Wooden's Indians, while Stanford moved the ball
around, properly working its offense.
During the first half of this game Friday night, it
didn't appear that the Bruins were in Stanford's
class. Rich Kelley made Ralph Drollinger look like
Jack Loomis, burning him for 16, while Ed
Schweitzer added 13.
The Bruins offense, meanwhile, did nothing
against the Cardinals' man-to-man. At the half,
Stanford led 37-24, and the score would have been
higher if the Cards hadn't committed 10 turnovers,
mostly on ill-advised and unnecessary fast breaks.
The Stanford band played "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing." Which was wishful thinking. UCLA
came back. UCLA always comes back.
With 15 minutes to play, the Bruins' zone press
began rattling the Cards. Stanford couldn't get the
ball across the time line, not because the press was
so good, but because the Cards began choking, just
like everyone does against UCLA.
UCLA scored 11 unanswered points to bring the
game to within four, at 45-41. Timeout Dallmar. "I
just reminded them that the press was the exact

same one we'd been beating in the first half."
End of choke. The two teams pretty much
traded baskets for the remainder, but UCLA never
broke the barrier of a four-point deficit.
Wooden, showing DeGaulle-like stubbornness,
refused to call a time out, never, not even when his
young Wonders desperately needed one to put their
offense back together.
With Ed Schweitzer blanketing top scorer Dave
Meyers, the only guy UCLA went to late in the
game was Rich Washington. He wasn't enough.
Dallmar's gamble, putting his taller forward
(Schweitzer) on UCLA's smaller one (Meyers) paid
off. As Kelley said, "Washington is good, but we
didn't think he could beat us. Only Meyers could
beat us.
Washington finished with 17, Meyers only 15. In
contrast, Kelley and Schweitzer netted 22 each.

SWEEPING THE BOARDS—Stanford center Rich Kelley proved to the sports
world this weekend what hands on the Farm have been saying ever since he came
here: the big seven footer is of All-American calibre. USC center Steve Malovic
(42) found out when Kelley ripped this rebound from him (one of 28 he got
over the weekend plus 52 points) in the Card's 67-66 win over the Trojans
Saturday night.
what to do in a close game.
Perhaps because the Bruins
weren't invincible, Stanford's
locker room wasn't that joyous.
Mark Gilberg, best guard on the
floor all night, was especially
restrained.
"If we don't win tomorrow,"
he said, "this one doesn't mean a
thing."
The next night, 70 fewer fans
("only" 7843) showed up, but
they acted like a far bigger throng.
Those fat cats who only show up
for UCLA were gone; students
who stood in line for an hour or
more Saturday afternoon for
expensive seats took their places.
The SC game was an even
match throughout. The Trojans
couldn't stop Rich Kelley (30
points), but the Cards were
equally powerless against the
driving, passing and shooting of
guard Gus Williams.
USC's superfast break often
zoomed past the Stanford
defense. But if the break failed, if
someone stopped Williams, it was
over.

Stanford's man-to-man, as
usual, prevented its adversary
from getting good shots, and, not
as usual, the Cardinal zone
defense proved equally stingy.
Jay Carter, a 6-3 freshman,
looked especially great. Replacing

6-6 Scott Trobbe at forward for
most of the game, Carter stopped
6-8 Bob Trowbridge cold, while
hitting the only five shots he took
Carter suffered a cramp with
1:21 to play, one which outlasted
even the patient Dallmar, who
called a double time-out to give it
time to vanish.
So, after that pause, Stanford
inbounded the ball, leading 63-62,
and held it for awhile. At :39,
Stanford tried THE play, the one
where someone zooms through to
the backdoor and gets a lob pass
for a cripple. The ball got into
Trobbe, but Williams made a
superhuman leap to block the
shot against the boards, got down
faster than gravity to get the
rebound and began running
downcourt.
Williams, though, had
obviously stepped on the baseline.

The refs didn't call it at first. The
Stanford crowd did.
Stanford basketball fans had
arrived.
Ten seconds later, Kelley was
fouled. He calmly consummated a
one-and-one to give the Cards a
three point edge. USC got a quick
basket, but fouled Kelley again.
Rich calmly sank another
one-and-one.
It was over.
A bit more noise, this time,
eminated from the locker room,
especially from the friends of
frosh hero Carter. Kelley calmly
explained that to shoot free
throws as well as he does (he's hit
25 in a row) you "have to put
your mind in a fog."
Even their Eminences Lyman
and Hargadon trekked to the
locker room. Ah yes, Stanford
basketball has indeed arrived.

MORE CROWDED THAN REG DAY—Fans swarmed over the floor of Maples Pavilion Saturday night, jumping up and down and noting
exactly who was, for this weekend at least, Number One. Why? The scoreboard (plus one the previous night) tells the story.
And suddenly, the Maples floor whinged like a
trampoline as hundreds of crazed fans swarmed on
it and jumped on it to an inspired rendition of "All
Right Now."
And if one of those fans had gotten as high
physically as he or she was mentally, and actually
flown to the roof, it wouldn't have been as
surprising as the events which had just taken place.
Stanford 64, second-ranked UCLA 60.
Stanford 67, fifth-ranked USC 66.
The Cardinals might not have matched up
one-on-one with either of those talent banks, but
they formed the better team. They out-hustled and
out-disciplined their foes. Howie Dallmar even
out-coached John Wooden and Bob Boyd.

didn't appear that the Bruins were in Stanford's
class. Rich Kelley made Ralph Drollinger look like
Jack Loomis, burning him for 16, while Ed
Schweitzer added 13.
The Bruins offense, meanwhile, did nothing
against the Cardinals' man-to-man. At the half,
Stanford led 37-24, and the score would have been
higher if the Cards hadn't committed 10 turnovers,
mostly on ill-advised and unnecessary fast breaks.
The Stanford band played "Don't You Worry
'Bout A Thing." Which was wishful thinking. UCLA
came back. UCLA always comes back.
With 15 minutes to play, the Bruins' zone press
began rattling the Cards. Stanford couldn't get the
ball across the time line, not because the press was
so good, but because the Cards began choking, just
like everyone does against UCLA.
UCLA scored 11 unanswered points to bring the
game to within four, at 45-41. Timeout Dallmar. "I
just reminded them that the press was the exact

same one we'd been beating in the first half."
End of choke. The two teams pretty much
traded baskets for the remainder, but UCLA never
broke the barrier of a four-point deficit.
Wooden, showing DeGaulle-like stubbornness,
refused to call a time out, never, not even when his
young Wonders desperately needed one to put their
offense back together.
With Ed Schweitzer blanketing top scorer Dave
Meyers, the only guy UCLA went to late in the
game was Rich Washington. He wasn't enough.
Dallmar's gamble, putting his taller forward
(Schweitzer) on UCLA's smaller one (Meyers) paid
off. As Kelley said, "Washington is good, but we
didn't think he could beat us. Only Meyers could
beat us.
Washington finished with 17, Meyers only 15. In
contrast, Kelley and Schweitzer netted 22 each.

SWEEPING THE BOARDS—Stanford center Rich Kelley proved to the sports
world this weekend what hands on the Farm have been saying ever since he came
here: the big seven footer is of All-American calibre. USC center Steve Malovic
(42) found out when Kelley ripped this rebound from him (one of 28 he got
over the weekend plus 52 points) in the Card's 67-66 win over the Trojans
Saturday night.
what to do in a close game.
Perhaps because the Bruins
weren't invincible, Stanford's
locker room wasn't that joyous.
Mark Gilberg, best guard on the
floor all night, was especially
restrained.
"If we don't win tomorrow,"
he said, "this one doesn't mean a
thing."
The next night, 70 fewer fans
("only" 7843) showed up, but
they acted like a far bigger throng.
Those fat cats who only show up
for UCLA were gone; students
who stood in line for an hour or
more Saturday afternoon for
expensive seats took their places.
The SC game was an even
match throughout. The Trojans
couldn't stop Rich Kelley (30
points), but the Cards were
equally powerless against the
driving, passing and shooting of
guard Gus Williams.
USC's superfast break often
zoomed past the Stanford
defense. But if the break failed, if
someone stopped Williams, it was
over.

Stanford's man-to-man, as
usual, prevented its adversary
from getting good shots, and, not
as usual, the Cardinal zone
defense proved equally stingy.
Jay Carter, a 6-3 freshman,
looked especially great. Replacing

6-6 Scott Trobbe at forward for
most of the game, Carter stopped
6-8 Bob Trowbridge cold, while
hitting the only five shots he took
Carter suffered a cramp with
1:21 to play, one which outlasted
even the patient Dallmar, who
called a double time-out to give it
time to vanish.
So, after that pause, Stanford
inbounded the ball, leading 63-62,
and held it for awhile. At :39,
Stanford tried THE play, the one
where someone zooms through to
the backdoor and gets a lob pass
for a cripple. The ball got into
Trobbe, but Williams made a
superhuman leap to block the
shot against the boards, got down
faster than gravity to get the
rebound and began running
downcourt.
Williams, though, had
obviously stepped on the baseline.

The refs didn't call it at first. The
Stanford crowd did.
Stanford basketball fans had
arrived.
Ten seconds later, Kelley was
fouled. He calmly consummated a
one-and-one to give the Cards a
three point edge. USC got a quick
basket, but fouled Kelley again.
Rich calmly sank another
one-and-one.
It was over.
A bit more noise, this time,
eminated from the locker room,
especially from the friends of
frosh hero Carter. Kelley calmly
explained that to shoot free
throws as well as he does (he's hit
25 in a row) you "have to put
your mind in a fog."
Even their Eminences Lyman
and Hargadon trekked to the
locker room. Ah yes, Stanford
basketball has indeed arrived.

MORE CROWDED THAN REG DAY—Fans swarmed over the floor of Maples Pavilion Saturday night, jumping up and down and noting
exactly who was, for this weekend at least, Number One. Why? The scoreboard (plus one the previous night) tells the story.
And suddenly, the Maples floor whinged like a
trampoline as hundreds of crazed fans swarmed on
it and jumped on it to an inspired rendition of "All
Right Now."
And if one of those fans had gotten as high
physically as he or she was mentally, and actually
flown to the roof, it wouldn't have been as
surprising as the events which had just taken place.
Stanford 64, second-ranked UCLA 60.
Stanford 67, fifth-ranked USC 66.
The Cardinals might not have matched up
one-on-one with either of those talent banks, but
they formed the better team. They out-hustled and
out-disciplined their foes. Howie Dallmar even
out-coached John Wooden and Bob Boyd.
Stanford actually didn't play quite as well as it
did when losing to Oregon 78-77 last week. But
unlike past games, this time it was the opponents
who fell apart in the last minutes while Stanford
remained in control.
Take UCLA. (Stanford hadn't taken them since
1966). The Bruins stood around on offense like

Wooden's Indians, while Stanford moved the ball
around, properly working its offense.
During the first half of this game Friday night, it
didn't appear that the Bruins were in Stanford's
class. Rich Kelley made Ralph Drollinger look like
Jack Loomis, burning him for 16, while Ed
Schweitzer added 13.
