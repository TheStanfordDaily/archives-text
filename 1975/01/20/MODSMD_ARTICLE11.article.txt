# AT&T Subtly Battles Anti-Trust Suit
## 
### Jim Wascher 
Poor AT&T. Late last fall, the Justice
Department filed its largest anti-trust suit
ever against Ma Bell, accusing the company
of conspiring to monopolize the nation's
telecommunications services.
In a letter mailed to corporation
shareholders less than a week after the suit
was filed, AT&T Board Chairman John D.
deßutts took pains to "assure you without
equivocation that we are confident that we
are not in violation of the anti-trust laws."
Deßutts claimed that the company's
record of efficiency and "performance"
should excuse AT&T from any
restraint-of-trade charges. "National policy
has recognized that in certain industries, ours
among them, the public interest is best
assured through regulation rather than
competition," deßutts wrote.
If you think about it, that last point is
rather interesting. Deßutts is arguing, not
that AT&T is clean, but that it has a good
reason for being dirty. A more careful
consideration of the facts is necessary to
determine whom AT&T serves more the
public or itself.
Increased Profits
In the company's fourth quarter 1974
"Share Owners Newsletter," deßutts
bragged: "That we have been able to improve
earnings despite slowed growth and sharply
increased expenses speaks well for the
management capabilities" of the company. I
hope deßutts didn't break his arm patting
himself on the back.
But the income statement published in the

same newsletter seems to sustain deßutts'
boast. For the 12 months ending on Nov. 30,
1974, AT&T had a net income of $3.2
billion, an increase of $220 million or
seven percent in one year.
During that same period, the dividend
which the company's 3.6 million
shareholders receive four times a year rose
from 70 cents to 85 cents a 21 percent
increase.
The AT&T management must be doing
something right. And both they and the
shareholders are being amply rewarded for
their success. But just what is it that deßutts
and his colleagues have done?
Clue In Letter
A clue might have appeared in the
chairman's special letter to the shareholders,
in which he pointed to the management's
record of seeing to it that the company's
structure has "repeatedly ... withstood the
most searching examination" by government
officials.
If AT&T had failed to survive these
investigations, and had been broken up into
its various service components, the financial
picture for management and shareholders
alike would not have been nearly as rosy as it
is today.
The increased earnings which deßutts
mentioned in the quarterly report are due
primarily to the fact that AT&T has virtually
no competition from other companies.
Hence, it may charge any amount it wishes
for the services it dispenses subject only to
some government regulation.

With competition, AT&T would obviously
have to provide better, cheaper service in
order to stay in business. Profits might drop
off a bit and dividends might not increase as
rapidly any more, but that's private
enterprise for you.
Regrettably, though, it was unrestrained
private enterprise which allowed AT&T to
reach the position it has. But that's another
question.
Even though deßutts is outwardly
confident that AT&T will defeat the Justice
Department's suit in the courts, he has not
hesitated to add another front to the battle.
Very gently, deßutts suggested in his
letter to the shareholders that they apply
pressure on the government. "While we do
not urge it," deßutts wrote, "obviously you
are free to express your views about the
public interest impact of the government's
action to your elected representatives, if you
so desire."
Deßutts again mentioned letter writing in
the quarterly report mailed to shareholders
last month. And he even had some
shareholder letters published in the
newsletter.
Let's just hope that AT&T can't throw its
influence around quite as much as ITT did a
few years back. And let's hope that Atty.
Gen.-designate Edward Levi is made of
stronger moral fiber than John Mitchell and
Richard Kleindienst.

Clue In Letter
A clue might have appeared in the
chairman's special letter to the shareholders,
in which he pointed to the management's
record of seeing to it that the company's
structure has "repeatedly ... withstood the
most searching examination" by government
officials.
If AT&T had failed to survive these
investigations, and had been broken up into
its various service components, the financial
picture for management and shareholders
alike would not have been nearly as rosy as it
is today.
The increased earnings which deßutts
mentioned in the quarterly report are due
primarily to the fact that AT&T has virtually
no competition from other companies.
Hence, it may charge any amount it wishes
for the services it dispenses subject only to
some government regulation.

With competition, AT&T would obviously
have to provide better, cheaper service in
order to stay in business. Profits might drop
off a bit and dividends might not increase as
rapidly any more, but that's private
enterprise for you.
Regrettably, though, it was unrestrained
private enterprise which allowed AT&T to
reach the position it has. But that's another
question.
Even though deßutts is outwardly
confident that AT&T will defeat the Justice
Department's suit in the courts, he has not
hesitated to add another front to the battle.
Very gently, deßutts suggested in his
letter to the shareholders that they apply
pressure on the government. "While we do
not urge it," deßutts wrote, "obviously you
are free to express your views about the
public interest impact of the government's
action to your elected representatives, if you
so desire."
Deßutts again mentioned letter writing in
the quarterly report mailed to shareholders
last month. And he even had some
shareholder letters published in the
newsletter.
Let's just hope that AT&T can't throw its
influence around quite as much as ITT did a
few years back. And let's hope that Atty.
Gen.-designate Edward Levi is made of
stronger moral fiber than John Mitchell and
Richard Kleindienst.

Poor AT&T. Late last fall, the Justice
Department filed its largest anti-trust suit
ever against Ma Bell, accusing the company
of conspiring to monopolize the nation's
telecommunications services.
In a letter mailed to corporation
shareholders less than a week after the suit
was filed, AT&T Board Chairman John D.
deßutts took pains to "assure you without
equivocation that we are confident that we
are not in violation of the anti-trust laws."
Deßutts claimed that the company's
record of efficiency and "performance"
should excuse AT&T from any
restraint-of-trade charges. "National policy
has recognized that in certain industries, ours
among them, the public interest is best
assured through regulation rather than
competition," deßutts wrote.
If you think about it, that last point is
rather interesting. Deßutts is arguing, not
that AT&T is clean, but that it has a good
reason for being dirty. A more careful
consideration of the facts is necessary to
determine whom AT&T serves more the
public or itself.
Increased Profits
In the company's fourth quarter 1974
"Share Owners Newsletter," deßutts
bragged: "That we have been able to improve
earnings despite slowed growth and sharply
increased expenses speaks well for the
management capabilities" of the company. I
hope deßutts didn't break his arm patting
himself on the back.
But the income statement published in the

same newsletter seems to sustain deßutts'
boast. For the 12 months ending on Nov. 30,
1974, AT&T had a net income of $3.2
billion, an increase of $220 million or
seven percent in one year.
During that same period, the dividend
which the company's 3.6 million
shareholders receive four times a year rose
from 70 cents to 85 cents a 21 percent
increase.
The AT&T management must be doing
something right. And both they and the
shareholders are being amply rewarded for
their success. But just what is it that deßutts
and his colleagues have done?
