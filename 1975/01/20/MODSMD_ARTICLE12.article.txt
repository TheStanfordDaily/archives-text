# Time' Merits Its Readers' Respect
## 
### Glenn Garvin 
Time magazine was born in
1923, and it's been producing
schizoid behavior ever since.
Typical was the opinions column
in the Jan. 15 Daily by William
Ross, in which he labeled the
magazine "inane" and declared it
"simply isn't worth taking
seriously."
All right. That's pretty
straightforward. Except Ross will
admit, if you ask him, that he
owns every copy of Time
published since the spring of 1971.
That's an awful lot of money
to spend on an inane, frivolous
magazine.
It's just as well. For the
evidence Ross presented to prove
his assertion was inadequate, to
put it as kindly as possible. Time
is not inane, and to suggest that a
news magazine that reaches six
million homes each week
shouldn't be taken seriously is
pretty silly.
One might even say inane.
First: Ross writes that "the
magazine has always maintained a
pretense of objectivity. This has
made Time far more dangerous
than if it had frankly admitted its
advocacy." Nothing could be
further from the truth. Time has
never pretended to be objective.
Henry Luce's original
prospectus for the magazine
frankly said "the editors recognize
that complete neutrality on public
questions and important news is
probably as undesirable as it is
impossible, and are therefore
ready to acknowledge certain
prejudices.. ." It then listed
eight, but concluded: "this
magazine is not founded to
promulgate prejudices, liberal or
conservative."
In other words, the magazine
had a viewpoint, but it was not
intended to be a political journal.
That description holds true today.
Right-Wing Magazine?
This brings us to Ross' second
contention that Time is a
right-wing publication. To support
this charge he notes that the

magazine attacked the New Deal,
supported Chiang Kai-Shek over
Mao and denounced Adlai
Stevenson.
But every one of those
examples is drawn from the
distant past, when Time was much
more a vehicle for Luce's personal
views. He died in 1967, and while
it would be naive to assume his
influence is no longer present, it is
even more so to say Time is
currently a conservative magazine.
Ross maintains Time treated
George McGovern as a "virtual
incompetent" in his 1972 bid for
the presidency. But the fact is
that McGovern did run his
campaign incompetently, which
contributed a great deal to his
disastrous loss, and many other
news media have agreed with that
assessment.

It is also worth pointing out
that Time pursued Watergate
tenaciously once the coverup
started to unfold and that it was
among the first of the national
media to call for Nixon's
resignation.
No Consistent Position
Since Time so frequently lashes
out at those on both sides of the
political spectrum, it's almost
stretching a point to attribute it a
consistent position. To the extent,
though, that Time has a political
view it is probably slightly to the
left of center.
Most astonishing is Ross'
argument that Time is not even
"generally accurate." I've worked
for Time's San Francisco bureau
for two years, and I've always
found the reporters and writers
obsessed with accuracy to a
much greater extent than most
other news media, including the
Daily. This preoccupation with
accuracy is undoubtedly due to
the fact that an error made in
front of six million readers is
pretty embarrassing.
Time's reporters "have done
little investigative work," Ross
continues. Again, this is simply
untrue. Many disclosures in both

the Watergate and Patty Hearst
investigations appeared in Time's
pages; and the magazine almost
single-handedly uncovered the
great Clifford Irving-Howard
Hughes hoax of a few years ago.
Perhaps Time does less
investigation than some of the
larger Eastern newspapers, but
then it's supposed to function
primarily as a systematic review of
the news, an account of what
happened in the past week and
why, and what national trends are
developing and why.
Admired Concept
This is a widely-admired
concept among most news media,
and many have tried to imitate it
in one way or another. In fact, the
Daily's "This Week" page, which

appears every Friday and for
which Ross often writes was
originally set up to provide
"Time-style coverage without
some of the excesses of Time," in
the words of then-Editor Rich
Jaroslovsky.
None of this is to argue that
Time is perfect. Its concept of
"group journalism" with one
set of people gathering the news
and another writing it
inevitably leads to some errors.
And of course anyone who
believes every word he reads in
Time each week is a fool, just as
anyone who believes every word
he reads in the New York Times,
the National Lampoon or the
Daily.

views. He died in 1967, and while
it would be naive to assume his
influence is no longer present, it is
even more so to say Time is
currently a conservative magazine.
Ross maintains Time treated
George McGovern as a "virtual
incompetent" in his 1972 bid for
the presidency. But the fact is
that McGovern did run his
campaign incompetently, which
contributed a great deal to his
disastrous loss, and many other
news media have agreed with that
assessment.

It is also worth pointing out
that Time pursued Watergate
tenaciously once the coverup
started to unfold and that it was
among the first of the national
media to call for Nixon's
resignation.
No Consistent Position
Since Time so frequently lashes
out at those on both sides of the
political spectrum, it's almost
stretching a point to attribute it a
consistent position. To the extent,
though, that Time has a political
view it is probably slightly to the
left of center.
Most astonishing is Ross'
argument that Time is not even
"generally accurate." I've worked
for Time's San Francisco bureau
for two years, and I've always
found the reporters and writers
obsessed with accuracy to a
much greater extent than most
other news media, including the
Daily. This preoccupation with
accuracy is undoubtedly due to
the fact that an error made in
front of six million readers is
pretty embarrassing.
Time's reporters "have done
little investigative work," Ross
continues. Again, this is simply
untrue. Many disclosures in both

the Watergate and Patty Hearst
investigations appeared in Time's
pages; and the magazine almost
single-handedly uncovered the
great Clifford Irving-Howard
Hughes hoax of a few years ago.
Perhaps Time does less
investigation than some of the
larger Eastern newspapers, but
then it's supposed to function
primarily as a systematic review of
the news, an account of what
happened in the past week and
why, and what national trends are
developing and why.
Admired Concept
This is a widely-admired
concept among most news media,
and many have tried to imitate it
in one way or another. In fact, the
Daily's "This Week" page, which

appears every Friday and for
which Ross often writes was
originally set up to provide
"Time-style coverage without
some of the excesses of Time," in
the words of then-Editor Rich
Jaroslovsky.
None of this is to argue that
Time is perfect. Its concept of
"group journalism" with one
set of people gathering the news
and another writing it
inevitably leads to some errors.
And of course anyone who
believes every word he reads in
Time each week is a fool, just as
anyone who believes every word
he reads in the New York Times,
the National Lampoon or the
Daily.
(Glenn Garvin is a member of the
Daily Editorial Board.)
Time magazine was born in
1923, and it's been producing
schizoid behavior ever since.
Typical was the opinions column
in the Jan. 15 Daily by William
Ross, in which he labeled the
magazine "inane" and declared it
"simply isn't worth taking
seriously."
All right. That's pretty
straightforward. Except Ross will
admit, if you ask him, that he
owns every copy of Time
published since the spring of 1971.
That's an awful lot of money
to spend on an inane, frivolous
magazine.
It's just as well. For the
evidence Ross presented to prove
his assertion was inadequate, to
put it as kindly as possible. Time
is not inane, and to suggest that a
news magazine that reaches six
million homes each week
shouldn't be taken seriously is
pretty silly.
One might even say inane.
First: Ross writes that "the
magazine has always maintained a
pretense of objectivity. This has
made Time far more dangerous
than if it had frankly admitted its
advocacy." Nothing could be
further from the truth. Time has
never pretended to be objective.
Henry Luce's original
prospectus for the magazine
frankly said "the editors recognize
that complete neutrality on public
questions and important news is
probably as undesirable as it is
impossible, and are therefore
ready to acknowledge certain
prejudices.. ." It then listed
eight, but concluded: "this
magazine is not founded to
promulgate prejudices, liberal or
conservative."
In other words, the magazine
had a viewpoint, but it was not
intended to be a political journal.
That description holds true today.
Right-Wing Magazine?
This brings us to Ross' second
contention that Time is a
right-wing publication. To support
this charge he notes that the

magazine attacked the New Deal,
supported Chiang Kai-Shek over
Mao and denounced Adlai
Stevenson.
But every one of those
examples is drawn from the
distant past, when Time was much
more a vehicle for Luce's personal
views. He died in 1967, and while
it would be naive to assume his
influence is no longer present, it is
even more so to say Time is

and many have tried to imitate it
in one way or another. In fact, the
Daily's "This Week" page, which

appears every Friday and for
which Ross often writes was
originally set up to provide
"Time-style coverage without
some of the excesses of Time," in
the words of then-Editor Rich
Jaroslovsky.
None of this is to argue that
Time is perfect. Its concept of
"group journalism" with one
set of people gathering the news
and another writing it
inevitably leads to some errors.
And of course anyone who
believes every word he reads in
Time each week is a fool, just as
anyone who believes every word
he reads in the New York Times,
the National Lampoon or the
Daily.

Time magazine was born in
1923, and it's been producing
schizoid behavior ever since.
Typical was the opinions column
in the Jan. 15 Daily by William
Ross, in which he labeled the
magazine "inane" and declared it
"simply isn't worth taking
seriously."
All right. That's pretty
straightforward. Except Ross will
admit, if you ask him, that he
owns every copy of Time
published since the spring of 1971.
That's an awful lot of money
to spend on an inane, frivolous
magazine.
It's just as well. For the
evidence Ross presented to prove
his assertion was inadequate, to
put it as kindly as possible. Time
is not inane, and to suggest that a
news magazine that reaches six
million homes each week
shouldn't be taken seriously is
pretty silly.
One might even say inane.
First: Ross writes that "the
magazine has always maintained a
pretense of objectivity. This has
made Time far more dangerous
than if it had frankly admitted its
advocacy." Nothing could be
further from the truth. Time has
never pretended to be objective.
Henry Luce's original
prospectus for the magazine
frankly said "the editors recognize
that complete neutrality on public
questions and important news is
probably as undesirable as it is
impossible, and are therefore
ready to acknowledge certain
prejudices.. ." It then listed
eight, but concluded: "this
magazine is not founded to
promulgate prejudices, liberal or
conservative."
In other words, the magazine
had a viewpoint, but it was not
intended to be a political journal.
That description holds true today.
Right-Wing Magazine?
This brings us to Ross' second
contention that Time is a
right-wing publication. To support
this charge he notes that the

magazine attacked the New Deal,
supported Chiang Kai-Shek over
Mao and denounced Adlai
Stevenson.
But every one of those
examples is drawn from the
distant past, when Time was much
more a vehicle for Luce's personal
views. He died in 1967, and while
it would be naive to assume his
influence is no longer present, it is
even more so to say Time is
currently a conservative magazine.
Ross maintains Time treated
George McGovern as a "virtual
incompetent" in his 1972 bid for
the presidency. But the fact is
that McGovern did run his
campaign incompetently, which
contributed a great deal to his
disastrous loss, and many other
news media have agreed with that
assessment.

It is also worth pointing out
that Time pursued Watergate
tenaciously once the coverup
started to unfold and that it was
among the first of the national
media to call for Nixon's
resignation.
No Consistent Position
Since Time so frequently lashes
out at those on both sides of the
political spectrum, it's almost
stretching a point to attribute it a
consistent position. To the extent,
though, that Time has a political
view it is probably slightly to the
left of center.
Most astonishing is Ross'
argument that Time is not even
"generally accurate." I've worked
for Time's San Francisco bureau
for two years, and I've always
found the reporters and writers
obsessed with accuracy to a
much greater extent than most
other news media, including the
Daily. This preoccupation with
accuracy is undoubtedly due to
the fact that an error made in
front of six million readers is
pretty embarrassing.
Time's reporters "have done
little investigative work," Ross
continues. Again, this is simply
untrue. Many disclosures in both

the Watergate and Patty Hearst
investigations appeared in Time's
pages; and the magazine almost
single-handedly uncovered the
great Clifford Irving-Howard
Hughes hoax of a few years ago.
Perhaps Time does less
investigation than some of the
larger Eastern newspapers, but
then it's supposed to function
primarily as a systematic review of
the news, an account of what
happened in the past week and
why, and what national trends are
developing and why.
Admired Concept
This is a widely-admired
concept among most news media,
and many have tried to imitate it
in one way or another. In fact, the
Daily's "This Week" page, which

appears every Friday and for
which Ross often writes was
