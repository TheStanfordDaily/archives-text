# Viet War Protest Over?
## 
### Herb Borock 
While anti-war organizations
struggle to get people to notice
that the Indochina War is not
over, the Ford-Rockefeller-
Kissinger administration is making
noises about re-escalating the war.
Meanwhile, the local chapter of
electronic warfare experts plans to
review their contribution to the
air war against North Vietnam.
On Thursday evening, Jan. 23,
the Association of Old Crows will
meet in Mountain View to discuss
"Electronic Countermeasures
Effectiveness for B-52 Penetration
in North Vietnam." The Old
Crows is an organization of
scientists, engineers and military
men dedicated to the furtherance
of electronic warfare.
The Ad Hoc Coalition of
Scarecrows has formed to protest
the Jan. 23 meeting. We will
gather at Sylvania on Whisman
Road in Mountain View at 7:15
p.m., Jan. 23, to picket the Old
Crows.
Such an expression is
important for two reasons. First,
it will remind local residents of
the Peninsula's military contracts
for modern warfare. Second, it
will signal to Washington that we
will not tolerate extended or
escalated American commitments
to the Thieu regime.
Indochina War Continues
The Pentagon has already
admitted that American
reconnaissance planes are being
used again over Indochina.
Previously, such flights have
preceded raids by South
Vietnamese and American
bombers. The Old Crows' meeting
is thus particularly ominous, since
they are the group whose work
enables American bombers to
evade North Vietnamese radar.
Meanwhile, in San Jose, the
FMC Corporation continues to
build Armored Personnel Carriers
(APCs) for South Vietnam. APCs
spearheaded the Laos invasion in
1971; and this fiscal year the US.
Army asked Congress for 194
APCs for South Vietnam.
Stanford's War Work

The Stanford community first
learned of the Old Crows in 1969,
when students protesting
classified military research
discovered that a leading Stanford
engineering professor, William R.
Rambo, was a founding member
of the Old Crows.
In 1966 Rambo was exposed as
the recipient of a secret CIA
contract. The anti-war
movement's opposition to the Old
Crows was part of a broader effort
to expose and oppose the
concentration of military
research, development and
production in the Stanford area.
For many years the Peninsula
military contractors have received
over $1 billion annually from the
Pentagon. Stanford, even after
banning secret research, remains
the core of a community of
technical scholars who realize that
the Pentagon is the chief sponsor
of new electronic technologies.
Many of these scholars, such as
the Old Crows, actually glorify
among themselves their military
work.
The meeting of the Old Crows
and the production of APCs for
South Vietnam are just two
examples of the Peninsula's
complicity in the continuing
Indochina War. We can end that
complicity when we unite to
express our outrage against
military work in our community.
That is why we are going to
Sylvania on Jan. 23.
