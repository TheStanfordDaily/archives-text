# Review Maligns Taj Mahal
## 
### Penny Sorrell 
I disagree with Dave Smith's
review (Daily, Jan. 17) of Taj
Mahal's concert at Stanford last
Wednesday night. He made several
incorrect assumptions which
invalidate his criticism.
First, he assumed Taj Mahal
was trying to speak French as it is
spoken in France. In Louisiana,
patois a dialect of French is
spoken. As with most European
languages adopted by black
people, they are inadequate for
expressing black thoughts and
feelings so variations are formed
consistent with the lifestyle.
A similar effect occurs with
Spanish as many black Puerto
Ricans don't speak the same
Spanish as Mexicans.
Also, I believe Cajuns are white
so it is probably true that "Taj
and his band performed a song
called 'Cajun Waltz' that wasn't
really a Cajun-styled tune." To be
more accurate, black Louisianians

refer to themselves as "Creoles."
There is a message in "Cajun
Waltz," but not, perhaps, for
Smith.
Secondly, Smith assumes Taj
Mahal identifies with his audience
of "pleasure-seekers" instead of
being a conscientious musician
who continually strives for
improvement not only in his
music, but, in his personal life as
well.
Several of Smith's other
statements are inaccurate. Jimmy
Cliff is not among the best of
Jamaican singers. Cliff is known
only because of his role in a movie
about reggae singers. He is,
primarily, an actor. There are
hundreds of reggae singers in the
islands who are "better" than Cliff.
Also, the reedman is not called
Ray Cosrick. His name is Rudy
Costa.
I don't agree with Smith's

criticism because I've never heard
Taj Mahal claim to be a Jamaican
reggae singer. He was born in the
United States. Naturally, his
music will assume a different
character.

Neither do I understand why
Smith insists on confining him to
the blues. It seems as if he is
saying, "I like Taj Mahal as long as
he stays in his place." And what
happens to black singers who
succumb to that line? Ray
Charles, Diana Ross and Sly Stone
have all but disappeared.
The only critical statement
that should be made is about the
engineers on the board who
garbled the sound and ruined the
harmony.
Speaking for myself, as a black,
I was quite satisfied with Taj's
performance. His back-up men are
great, each one a talented entity.

Neither do I understand why
Smith insists on confining him to
the blues. It seems as if he is
saying, "I like Taj Mahal as long as
he stays in his place." And what
happens to black singers who
succumb to that line? Ray
Charles, Diana Ross and Sly Stone
have all but disappeared.
The only critical statement
that should be made is about the
engineers on the board who
garbled the sound and ruined the
harmony.
Speaking for myself, as a black,
I was quite satisfied with Taj's
performance. His back-up men are
great, each one a talented entity.

I disagree with Dave Smith's
review (Daily, Jan. 17) of Taj
Mahal's concert at Stanford last
Wednesday night. He made several
incorrect assumptions which
invalidate his criticism.
First, he assumed Taj Mahal
was trying to speak French as it is
spoken in France. In Louisiana,
patois a dialect of French is
spoken. As with most European
languages adopted by black
people, they are inadequate for
expressing black thoughts and
feelings so variations are formed
consistent with the lifestyle.
A similar effect occurs with
Spanish as many black Puerto
Ricans don't speak the same
Spanish as Mexicans.
Also, I believe Cajuns are white
so it is probably true that "Taj
and his band performed a song
called 'Cajun Waltz' that wasn't
really a Cajun-styled tune." To be
more accurate, black Louisianians

refer to themselves as "Creoles."
There is a message in "Cajun
Waltz," but not, perhaps, for
Smith.
Secondly, Smith assumes Taj
Mahal identifies with his audience
of "pleasure-seekers" instead of
being a conscientious musician
who continually strives for
improvement not only in his
music, but, in his personal life as
well.
Several of Smith's other
statements are inaccurate. Jimmy
Cliff is not among the best of
Jamaican singers. Cliff is known
only because of his role in a movie
about reggae singers. He is,
primarily, an actor. There are
hundreds of reggae singers in the
islands who are "better" than Cliff.
Also, the reedman is not called
Ray Cosrick. His name is Rudy
Costa.
I don't agree with Smith's

criticism because I've never heard
Taj Mahal claim to be a Jamaican
reggae singer. He was born in the
United States. Naturally, his
music will assume a different
character.
