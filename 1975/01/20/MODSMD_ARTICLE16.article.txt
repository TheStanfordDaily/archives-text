# Visitor Calls Chinese Students Optimistic Despite Tensions

Despite the current ideological tensions and
unglamorous facilities, university students in the
Peoples' Republic of China are cheerful, optimistic
and confident of their prospects to effect changes
for the good of society, according to Erica Jen,
Yale University student who spent more than a
year and a half in mainland China beginning in June
1972.
Jen, in an informal question-and-answer session
before about 75 people in Junipero lounge,
expressed enthusiasm for many aspects of life in
the Peoples' Republic, where she divided her time
between being a student at Peking University,
working in a Peking machine tool factory and
participating in the life of a rural commune.
Asked to respond to a remark made recently by
President Richard Lyman concerning the "massive
cheerfulness and eagerness of Chinese university
students" greeting visitors in plain-looking
dormitories, Jen said, "First of all, the dorms are
not bad or uncomfortable. And the students really
are cheerful because they feel that their work is
meaningful."
Jen, who studied politicall economy and Party
history at the university, said that Western

European history and philosophy are generally not
emphasized, since they are not considered
conducive to social action. Chinese students are
"critical of the eclecticism in American universities,
where people can study anything they want," she
said.

"Students there realize that the revolution in
education has to be a permanent one," Jen said,
but noted that there is still some tension of workers
versus intellectuals who are jealous of their control
of university policies and admissions. "Revisionist
professors are still there, but students are wary and
critical of their teachings," she added.
Since the Cultural Revolution, criticism is
directed more at policies than personalities, and
persuasion is replacing coercion, she said.
Many people are involved in politics, she said,
"but this may mean nothing more than wanting to
be involved in decision-making processes that are
connected with daily life. Those who want to
become Party members work hard to avoid special
privileges, and often live in less desirable houses
than other people."
Jen stressed that the Chinese family "is still very
strong in China; they cannot understand why U.S.
kids want to go away to school."
