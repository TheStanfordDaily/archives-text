Huskies Edge Swimmers
Stanford's swimmers took a
heartbreaking 38-55 loss from
Washington last Friday night, in a
meet that was even closer than the
score indicated.
"We got touched out right
down the line," lamented Coach
Jim Gaughran, noting that "all we
needed was one more second
place."
The Cards should have realized
that they were in for a long
evening when, following a win in
the medley relay, Mike Bruner
was edged by Husky Robin
Backhouse in the 1000 yard free
by six-one-thousandths of a
second.
That's an amazing margin of
victory, considering that the race
covers 40 lengths of the pool.
Bruner, however, did come back
to win the 200 fly (1:52.8) and
500 free (4:29.2).
Bruner was not the only Card
swimmer to get touched out. John
Hencken, who won the 200
breast, missed second place in the
200 individual medley by
one-tenth of a second.
Bruce Goodwin was edged for
second in the 50 free by
two-hundredths of a second, and
Craig Van Zandt missed second
place in the 200 free by a similar
margin. Even the diving went
down to the wire, as Wayne Wager
missed his very last dive in the
3-meter event, dropping him to
second place.
"Their times were quite a bit

faster than they were last week
against UCLA and USC," said
Gaughran, attributing the Huskies'
improvement to their home pool.
There were some bright spots
for the Cards, however. Sprinter
Dave Fairbanks sparkled in his
100 free win and in the free relay.
Dean Anderson also performed
well, winning the 50 free.
The Cards meet UOP Friday at
Stanford this Friday in a
non-league encounter.

Lieberman Leads Ruggers
The Stanford rugby team, led
by team captain Lawrie
Lieberman's 14 second half
points, posted a 37-15 victory
Saturday over UC-Davis at Davis.
But the contest was closer than
the final score indicates.
Leading 15-3 with three
minutes left in the first half, the
Card scrum collapsed, as the
Aggies scored 12 points, to knot
the halftime score at 15 apiece.
Card coach Pete Kmetovic said,
"When we got the ball in the first
half our backs were able to score,
but Davis kept it away from us
with a good kicking game."
It was an inspired Stanford
team that dominated the second
half j however. The Card backfield,
led by Lieberman and Marty
O'Donahue, tallied 22 points,
while the scrum shut out the
Aggies. "Davis ran out of gas in
the second half, but they were a
good team," Kmetovic said.
The win upped the ruggers
season mafk to 2-0. Next week
the Cards open a five game
homestand, when they take on
the X O's Saturday on Harry
Maloney Field at 1:30 p.m.

JV Cagers Split
Stanford's
down-the-next junior varsity
basketball team blew a nine-point
halftime lead Friday night and
overcame a ten-point deficit
Saturday night, thereby splitting
the weekend series and pushing its
record to 2-3.
The Cardinals, coached by
Percy Carr, lost to Merritt
College's junior varsity (14-4),
72-71, and then defeated the
Santa Clara jayvees (5-3), 65-63 in
overtime.
After scoring a measley 14
points in the first half against
Santa Clara, Stanford came back
with 46 points in the second to tie
the game at 60-all, and then won
it in the three-minute overtime
period. Bill Christopher scored
only three baskets on the night,
but two came in the overtime
period.
Sven Walker scored 17 points
and little Terry McCartin netted
15 in what Carr called "the best
team effort of the year."

Even an outstanding
performance by Walker (29 points
on 14 of 22 from the field and 12
rebounds) couldn't lift Stanford
past Merritt Friday night. The
reason? The Cards shot better
from the field than from the foul
line, hitting just 36 percent of
their free throws.
Outside of that, Stanford
played well against a team that
had previously played 17 games to
the Cards' three. Carr told his
team after the game: "If you can
play this well against a team that's
been playing that long, you
should be expected to win a lot of
games this season."

Wrestlers Split
Led by seniors Ken Krebs and
Chris Horpel, the Cardinal
wrestling team won two out of
three matches in the Stanford
Invitational defeating New Mexico
23-19 and Oregon Tech 37-3
while losing to Cal State
Bakersfield 30-8 Saturday
afterfioon.
Krebs, who head coach Joe
DeMeo said has been wrestling
superbly the past two weeks,
recorded two pins and an
eight-point decision in the
Invitational while Horpel, just off
an injury, duplicated Krebs' feat.
In other weekend action, the
Cards were defeated by Southern
Oregon 21-12 Friday night. The
four matches moved Stanford's
season record to 8-5.
