## Shuffling The Cards Changing Times 
### Dave Robinson 
You remember the Stanford Cardinals. They're the team with all
those big giants who can't run or jump or defend very well, at least
according to Sports Illustrated, the Los Angeles Times and all those
cjther bastions of sporting expertise.

Last season the New York Daily News called the Cardinals "some
very tall, very slow trees." The biggest tree, 7-foot center Rich Kelley,
"lived down to his press clippings," the newspaper continued.
This year Los Angeles Times columnist John Hall predicted that
Stanford would finish last in the Pacific Eight. Sports Illustrated
devoted exactly one sentence to the Cardinals in an otherwise verbose
college basketball issue. USC coach Bob Boyd confidently predicted
that invincible UCLA might finally be knocked off its Pac-8 pedestal
in 1975. "We could do it," he said, "or Washington, Oregon or Oregon
State."
And Friday night Pac-8 publicity director Dave Price questioned
the sanity of a reporter who was foolish enough to pick Stanford first
in the league. "You've got to be crazy," he said, shaking his head in
disbelief.
Dream Team
After all, the Cards were an opposing coach's dream. A coach could
inject some legitimate fear into his players' minds the week before a
game against Stanford. "They're tall, and they've played great games
against some of the best teams in the nations," coaches would say,
knowing full well that the Cards would play well again, but find away
to lose in the final minutes.
Stanford was the most human team in college basketball. The
Cards would fight, hustle, scrap and often outplay highly ranked
opponents for 35 minutes or so, and then almost apologize for their
efforts before the game ended. The Cardinals weren't supposed to
win, so they didn't.
Until this weekend, when Stanford broke out of its shell against
two of the top five teams in the country. This time, there were no
apologies.
Freshman Jay Carter, who hadn't suffered through the indignities
of past seasons, epitomized the newfound Cardinal confidence. "All
day long I had to calm myself down," he said after Stanford had upset
UCLA. "When you see 'em on TV you say 'Wow!' But out there they
look like regular dudes."
Re-enactment Of Wilkes
Friday night against the Bruins, Carter contributed 20 minutes of
solid basketball, handling the ball cleanly, grabbing a few rebounds
and sinking a 20-foot jumper. Saturday night against USC, he was the
re-enactment of Keith Wilkes, using his awkward shooting form to hit
five of five field goal attempts while playing with uncommon poise for
a freshman.
Like Wilkes, Carter's shooting form makes purists cringe at first
glance. He brings the ball behind his head, elbows flailing. But as he
hangs in mid-air just before release, everything straightens out. He
transforms forced shots into amazing baskets faster than his coaches
can change their expressions from grimaces to smiles.
"Freshmen are supposed to fold in situations like this," said Card
coach Howie Dallmar. "But Jay didn't."
Kelley Superhuman
More importantly, neither did the Cardinal veterans. Rich Kelley,
who said after Friday's game that "this was the first time I've faced a
UCLA team that we knew was human," showed few signs of mortality
himself over the weekend, including 18 for 18 from the free throw
line. Ed Schweitzer continued his phenomenal shooting from the
field, and Mark Gilberg played two superb floor games. Even Dallmar,
long an enemy of Stanford's student section, failed to draw a boo
from the fickle Cardinal fans.
At least for a weekend, the skeptics had been silenced.
From here, Stanford might win the Pac-8 title, advance to the Far
Western Regionals in Portland maybe even make it to the NCAA
semifinals at San Diego. Or the Cards might revert to the dismal form
of seasons past.
But whatever happens, as assistant coach Bub Bowling said
Saturday night, "they can't take this weekend away from us."
