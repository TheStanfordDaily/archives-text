# Police To Begin Citing Parking Fee Violators
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
As the new campus parking policy
goes into effect today, an attorney for
the Escondido Village Council is
negotiating with the University's
attorney, in an attempt to reach a
compromise on the parking sticker
controversy.
Beginning today, any student,
faculty, or staff vehicle ' parked on
campus must display a parking sticker.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington had
announced early last month that those
without the parking decals would be
issued a citation.
The Escondido Village Council,
objecting to the $7.50 fee for student
stickers, has asked that students not
purchase the decals. Should students
be cited, the Council is asking that
they refuse to pay the citation.
Kathy Colson, president of the
Council, said she believed the boycott
had been successful so far.
"I don't have any figures on how
many students have bought decals
she said, "but I haven't seen very
many stickers displayed in the
Escondido parking lots."
Palo Alto Lawyer Hired

The Council has retained attorney
Dent Hand, of Robertson and Hand, a
Palo Alto law firm. He will be
negotiating with Michael H. Hudnall,
associated staff counsel in the office of
the University's vice president for
business and finance.
"I think we're coming close to an
agreement," Colson said. "What we
would prefer to do is to try a test case
in court, where just one student would
be cited for not having a parking
sticker. This would be better than the
police blitzing the entire University,
ticketing every car without a sticker."
Cars in several parking lots were
leafletted Thursday and Friday, with a
notice, warning of the Monday
deadline for purchasing and displaying
parking stickers. Policemen last week
were also reported to have been taking
down license numbers of those cars
without decals.
Director of Police Services Marvin
Herrington was unavailable for

comment on any police action.
A $3OOO bail fund has been set up
jointly by the Escondido Village
Council and the ASSU. Colson said
some of the $lOOO put up by the
Council may be used to pay for
citations, although she said they hoped
it could all contribute to legal fees,
should a student challenge a citation.
The $2OOO from the ASSU may only
be used for legal fees, not to pay for
citations.
Should a student be cited for not
displaying a parking sticker, he or she
has 10 days to decide whether to pay
the ticket, or to challenge it, Colson
said. Students may go to the Legal
Counseling Office for advice, she said,
although that office cannot represent
them in an intra-University dispute.
Long-Term Study
As the sticker controversy
continues, Peter F. Carpenter, assistant
to the vice president for medical
affairs, has begun a study to assess the
long-term parking needs of the
University. Carpenter said he had met
with the parking subcommittee three
times and organized an opinion survey
to be conducted by business school
students.
He said Lance Friedmann is
currently updating a three-year-old
parking study done by SWOPSI and
another done by University Master
Planner Oscar Nelson. Friedmann is
also contacting other schools to see
how they have dealt with parking
problems.

Carpenter said he plans to hold
public hearings after the current
parking sticker problem is solved.
"If we held hearings now, people
wouldn't have the same perspective
they might have after everything has
calmed down," he said.
Carpenter said the hearings will be
held for specific groups of people, "to
get a representative viewpoint." One
hearing may be for persons living off
campus, several for on campus
residents, and another for non-drivers.
"We have to take everything into
account," he said. "Although we're
not running an opinion referendum, it
would be foolish to recommend
something that doesn't meet the
University's and the students' needs."
Carpenter said he hopes to have his
recommendations ready to submit to
the University by late February.
However, he added, if the current
situation continues, the public
hearings will have to be delayed, until
everything "cools down a little." Until
then, he said, he would "just have to
play it by ear."
