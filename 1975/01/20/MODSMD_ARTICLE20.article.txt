Arab Terrorists Attack Israeli Jet
PARIS Two Arab terrorists made an unsuccessful
attack on an Israeli airliner at Orly airport yesterday,
battled police with grenades and shots and holed up in an
airport restroom with an estimated six hostages.
Officials said 20 people were wounded, eight of them
seriously. They said they believed one of the terrorists also
was wounded.
The Arabs demanded a Boeing 707 jetliner to fly them to
an unknown destination, officials reported.
An official spokesman said the police used electronic
listening devices to monitor conversations in the
windowless restroom and concluded six persons were being
held.
The terrorists described themselves in a note as the
"Mohammed Boudia Squad," named after an Algerian
assassinated in Paris last year.
Meanwhile in London, gunmen in speeding cars raked
two downtown London hotels with machine-gun fire last
night, injuring seven persons, police said.
Jewish functions were being held at both hotels when
the gunmen struck, officials reported.
Police said it was too early to speculate on who was to
blame, but one official source said he believed it was likely
to be the work of Arab extremists.
Congressman Calls For Probe Of FBI
WASHINGTON - Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier (D-Wis.),
chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, said
yesterday he will call current and former FBI officials to
testify on charges that the agency kept personal files on
members of Congress.
Kastenmeier called the practice as "insidious as
Watergate" and said he will call on such witnesses as FBI
Director Clarence J. Kelley and former acting Director L.
Patrick Gray 111 to testify under oath within the next three
weeks.
The Washington Post yesterday quoted two former

high-ranking FBI officials as saying that while the late J.
Edgar Hoover was director, the FBI put together files which
included data on the girl friends and drinking problems of
members of Congress.
Four Cambodian Civilians Killed
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Four rockets fired into the
heart of this beleaguered capital early today killed four
civilians and wounded eight others, police reported.
One of the 107 mm rockets exploded in the compound
of the vacant French-Descarte secondary school and
authorities cancelled today's classes in fear of further
attacks.
The rockets fell in Phnom Penh hours after 15 of the
Chinese-built missiles peppered the city's airport and
surrounding villages, leaving a toll of five dead and 16
wounded.
Simon: Ready To Fight For Ford Plan
WASHINGTON The push for President Ford's
economic program intensified yesterday with two
administration officials making television appearances to
urge prompt congressional approval.
"I most certainly am," responded Treasury Secretary
William E. Simon when asked if he was ready to fight for
Ford's proposals despite reports that he dislikes the large
deficits included in them.
Simon, appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, said he
doesn't like large deficits but they are a necessary part of
the program. Reminded he once indicated he would resign
if the budget deficit reached $4O billion, Simon said that no
longer is the case.
On ABC's Issues and Answers, Interior Secretary Rogers
C.B. Morton also strongly backed Ford.
Mobil, Oil Union Reach Accord
DENVER The oil workers union announced
agreement yesterday on two-year national contracts with
the Mobil and Cities Service oil companies.
The settlements averted a walkout by 6700 workers,
but left more than 3100 other members of the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union still on
strike at Continental and Union oil company refineries in
seven states.
More than 9300 workers also continued to strike over
local issues at Mobil, Gulf and Texaco refineries in
Beaumont and Port Arthur, Tex., despite national
settlements with Gulf and Texaco last week and the Mobil
settlement yesterday.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with variable high clouds through tomorrow
with patchy morning fog. Little temperature change. Lows
mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in 50s to

Congressman Calls For Probe Of FBI
WASHINGTON - Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier (D-Wis.),
chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, said
yesterday he will call current and former FBI officials to
testify on charges that the agency kept personal files on
members of Congress.
Kastenmeier called the practice as "insidious as
Watergate" and said he will call on such witnesses as FBI
Director Clarence J. Kelley and former acting Director L.
Patrick Gray 111 to testify under oath within the next three
weeks.
The Washington Post yesterday quoted two former

high-ranking FBI officials as saying that while the late J.
Edgar Hoover was director, the FBI put together files which
included data on the girl friends and drinking problems of
members of Congress.
Four Cambodian Civilians Killed
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Four rockets fired into the
heart of this beleaguered capital early today killed four
civilians and wounded eight others, police reported.
One of the 107 mm rockets exploded in the compound
of the vacant French-Descarte secondary school and
authorities cancelled today's classes in fear of further
attacks.
The rockets fell in Phnom Penh hours after 15 of the
Chinese-built missiles peppered the city's airport and
surrounding villages, leaving a toll of five dead and 16
wounded.
Simon: Ready To Fight For Ford Plan
WASHINGTON The push for President Ford's
economic program intensified yesterday with two
administration officials making television appearances to
urge prompt congressional approval.
"I most certainly am," responded Treasury Secretary
William E. Simon when asked if he was ready to fight for
Ford's proposals despite reports that he dislikes the large
deficits included in them.
Simon, appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, said he
doesn't like large deficits but they are a necessary part of
the program. Reminded he once indicated he would resign
if the budget deficit reached $4O billion, Simon said that no
longer is the case.
On ABC's Issues and Answers, Interior Secretary Rogers
C.B. Morton also strongly backed Ford.
Mobil, Oil Union Reach Accord
DENVER The oil workers union announced
agreement yesterday on two-year national contracts with
the Mobil and Cities Service oil companies.
The settlements averted a walkout by 6700 workers,
but left more than 3100 other members of the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union still on
strike at Continental and Union oil company refineries in
seven states.
More than 9300 workers also continued to strike over
local issues at Mobil, Gulf and Texaco refineries in
Beaumont and Port Arthur, Tex., despite national
settlements with Gulf and Texaco last week and the Mobil
settlement yesterday.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with variable high clouds through tomorrow
with patchy morning fog. Little temperature change. Lows
mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in 50s to
mid 60s.
Arab Terrorists Attack Israeli Jet
PARIS Two Arab terrorists made an unsuccessful
attack on an Israeli airliner at Orly airport yesterday,
battled police with grenades and shots and holed up in an
airport restroom with an estimated six hostages.
Officials said 20 people were wounded, eight of them
seriously. They said they believed one of the terrorists also
was wounded.
The Arabs demanded a Boeing 707 jetliner to fly them to
an unknown destination, officials reported.
An official spokesman said the police used electronic
listening devices to monitor conversations in the
windowless restroom and concluded six persons were being
held.
The terrorists described themselves in a note as the
"Mohammed Boudia Squad," named after an Algerian
assassinated in Paris last year.
Meanwhile in London, gunmen in speeding cars raked
two downtown London hotels with machine-gun fire last
night, injuring seven persons, police said.
Jewish functions were being held at both hotels when
the gunmen struck, officials reported.
Police said it was too early to speculate on who was to
blame, but one official source said he believed it was likely
to be the work of Arab extremists.
