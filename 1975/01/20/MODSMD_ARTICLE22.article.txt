# Former ASSU President Harris Calls For Unconditional Amnesty
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Former Stanford student body
president David Harris recommended
Saturday that draft evaders and
deserters from the armed forces
"should be allowed to re-enter the
country without having to face any
alternative service," as they do under

President Ford's amnesty proposal.
Harris spoke at an evening program
in Memorial Church with Vietnam
Veterans Against the War Director
Jeanne Friedman. Journalist Don Luce
and Bui Van Dao, a South Vietnamese
studying at Long Beach State, spoke at
a similar program Friday night in
Bishop Auditorium.
Both programs were sponsored
jointly by the Stanford Amnesty
Committee and Memorial Church.
Harris called it "a real service to
democracy to refuse to go and serve in
the tyranny of Southeast Asia."
Harris himself spent 20 months in a
federal prison in Texas for refusing
induction into the armed services.
Friedman, formerly a graduate
student here, had harsher words for
Ford's program. "I think that the
Clemency Board was a slap in the face
of everyone who thought that war was
wrong," she'said. "The best term we
ever came up with for President Ford's
amnesty proposal was "shamnesty.'"
500,000 Veterans Ineligible
Under the proposal, Friedman said,
approximately 500,000 veterans who
received less than honorable discharges
would not be eligible for some form of
amnesty. "It touched very few of the
people who needed it," she charged.
Luce, who just has returned from a
visit to North Vietnam, also attacked
the amnesty program.

"This is how we have thanked the
people for opposing a war that we all
have said is wrong," he declared.
"We have more heroes from the
Vietnam War than from any other war
that we have fought," he said,
applauding those who refused to fight
and those who protested the war.
Luce was highly critical of the
effectiveness of the peace accord
signed in Paris nearly two years ago,
and noted that "we have been
violating it for the last two years."
Accord Violations Alleged
He observed that the United States
has neither dismantled its military
bases in the region, nor stopped
re-equipping the South Vietnamese
army. In both cases, the U.S. is

violating provisions of the Paris Peace
Accord.
Dao is one of several South
Vietnamese students in the United
States fighting to keep from being
deported back to South Vietnam.
"There are numerous cases of
Vietnamese students facing this kind
of repression," Dao noted. "In the
courts we are asking for political
asylum. However, we are not seeking
to stay in this country forever. We just
don't want to go home when our
democratic liberties are stripped and
we don't want to go to jail."

"There are numerous cases of
Vietnamese students facing this kind
of repression," Dao noted. "In the
courts we are asking for political
asylum. However, we are not seeking
to stay in this country forever. We just
don't want to go home when our
democratic liberties are stripped and
we don't want to go to jail."
Former Stanford student body
president David Harris recommended
Saturday that draft evaders and
deserters from the armed forces
"should be allowed to re-enter the
country without having to face any
alternative service," as they do under

President Ford's amnesty proposal.
Harris spoke at an evening program
in Memorial Church with Vietnam
Veterans Against the War Director
Jeanne Friedman. Journalist Don Luce
and Bui Van Dao, a South Vietnamese
studying at Long Beach State, spoke at
a similar program Friday night in
Bishop Auditorium.
Both programs were sponsored
jointly by the Stanford Amnesty
Committee and Memorial Church.
Harris called it "a real service to
democracy to refuse to go and serve in
the tyranny of Southeast Asia."
Harris himself spent 20 months in a
federal prison in Texas for refusing
induction into the armed services.
Friedman, formerly a graduate
student here, had harsher words for
Ford's program. "I think that the
Clemency Board was a slap in the face
of everyone who thought that war was
wrong," she'said. "The best term we
ever came up with for President Ford's
amnesty proposal was "shamnesty.'"
500,000 Veterans Ineligible
Under the proposal, Friedman said,
approximately 500,000 veterans who
received less than honorable discharges
would not be eligible for some form of
amnesty. "It touched very few of the
people who needed it," she charged.
Luce, who just has returned from a
visit to North Vietnam, also attacked
the amnesty program.

"This is how we have thanked the
people for opposing a war that we all
have said is wrong," he declared.
"We have more heroes from the
Vietnam War than from any other war
that we have fought," he said,
applauding those who refused to fight
and those who protested the war.
Luce was highly critical of the
effectiveness of the peace accord
signed in Paris nearly two years ago,
and noted that "we have been
violating it for the last two years."
Accord Violations Alleged
He observed that the United States
has neither dismantled its military
bases in the region, nor stopped
re-equipping the South Vietnamese
army. In both cases, the U.S. is

violating provisions of the Paris Peace
Accord.
Dao is one of several South
Vietnamese students in the United
States fighting to keep from being
deported back to South Vietnam.
"There are numerous cases of
Vietnamese students facing this kind
of repression," Dao noted. "In the
courts we are asking for political
asylum. However, we are not seeking
to stay in this country forever. We just
