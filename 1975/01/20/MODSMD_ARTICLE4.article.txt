# Horton's Staff Proposal Assures Three Years Campus Housing
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
On-campus housing will be
guaranteed to all entering freshmen for
three of four years here, according to a
Housing Office proposal for a revised
residential system. But under the
proposal, the chances for staying on
campus all four years will be even
slimmer than they are now.
The proposal, submitted to the
Committee On Student Services
(COSS) housing subcommittee,
establishes a system in which all
students, including transfers, will be
guaranteed housing their first year
here.
Freshmen will be able to choose
which subsequent years they may
spend off-campus.
The proposal provides for two
University-housing systems all-male
fraternities and the draw. The annual
housing draw will determine where a
student resides within the University
system during his guaranteed years.
Students on their off year may enter
the draw for any remaining spaces.
Frats Draw-Exempt

Fraternities will remain exempt
from the draw, but they will be forced
to fulfill a quota proportional to the
demand of on-campus housing.
Inter-Fraternity Council President
Mike Nilsson explained that if the
quota exceeded the rated occupancy
of the house, fraternity members
would be forced to either crowd their
house or establish an off-campus
annex for the additional residents.
Subcommittee co-chairperson A1
Tomaszcsuk said although not all
details of the proposal have been
finalized, "a lot of subcommittee
members" are planning to accept the
basic outline at this point.
"It's a magnificent solution to a
very difficult problem too many
students for two few spaces," Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons
exclaimed.

Tomaszczuk echoed Lyons words,
stating that the proposal solved the
problem of equal access to on-campus
housing.
Lyons will review the proposal if
COSS approves it. The final decision
rests with President Richard Lyman.
From initial impressions, Lyman
said he favors the proposal. "From
what I've heard about it, it is an
imaginative way of diminishing the
pain of the annual draw."
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton, whose staff formulated
the proposal, said he was not ready to
comment on it.
However, not everyone favors the
plan. One student complained the
proposal does not solve the problem of
alloting housing regardless of a
student's sex.
Co-Ed Fraternities
Co-educational fraternities do not
fall under the same terms as all-male
fraternities, according to the proposal.
Co-ed fraternities are considered part
of the draw system, while fraternities
remain autonomous.
Lyons denied that the plans contain
any "significant privileges" specifically
for men. He said he considered
crowding a burden, rather than a
privilege.
Some fraternity members will
probably have to live off campus,
because "there are limits to the
number of people you can stuff," he
continued.
Students in the draw actually have
a "great advantage," Lyons declared,
because the proposal leaves the
decision of the actual year a student
will spend off campus to the individual
instead of to a social group or the
University.
Predictability
He praised the proposal for
establishing predictability in a
student's residential life here.

"Students will be able to develop and
maintain small social communities off
campus," he remarked, explaining that
friends could plan to rent a house
together during the same year off."
He admitted that there would be a
"lack of predictability" for students
vying for housing spaces during their
off year. However, he said he could
not determine the extent of the
unpredictability because "I don't
know what the odds [of securing the
remaining spaces] are."
Nilsson criticized the proposal
because it "has provisions for attrition
but not for expansion" for fraternities.
The proposal levies a
two-consecutive-year grace period on

fraternities that cannot fulfill their
quotas. After that period the
fraternity will be incorporated into the
draw system.
Nilsson suggested that the
fraternity system as a whole be forced
to maintain the quota instead of
delivering an ultimatum to an
individual house.
As to expansion, Nilsson explained
the proposal sets no criteria for
organizations wishing to establish a
fraternity on campus.
He announced that Theta Delta Chi
alumni have launched an $ll million
fund raising campaign to build more
houses here.
