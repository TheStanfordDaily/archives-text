# Police Need Campus Statistics
## Women Told To Report Crimes 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
History graduate student Gloria
Guth said Friday that women on
campus should report any "harassing
incident, not necessarily
life-threatening" so that police could
compile statistics on what types of
crime occur most often at different
campus locations.
Guth told the 50 persons attending
a meeting in the Meyer Library Forum
Room that many women do not
report crimes of abuse against them
"because they feel it wouldn't do any
good." The gathering was one in a
series sponsored by a group of
graduate women in the humanities.
Director of Police Services Marvin
Herrington attended the meeting and
heard Guth say the crime statistics are
necessary because "we felt Stanford
was not fulfilling its responsibility to
make the campus safer."
Guth said she recalled receiving
numerous complaints from women
who had been harassed in the Main
Library stacks and stressed the
importance of reporting the incident
and a description of the perpetrator to
police.
Ron Blankenhorn, self-defense
instructor at the Roble gym, who was
also present Friday, reiterated the
problem of unreported attacks.
"I've received a number of
anonymous letters from women who

have been attacked in some way saying
'this is the way he did this or that'
and asking what they could have done
to defend themselves. Usually they
haven't reported it to the police," he
said.
Both Blankenhorn and Herrington
are working on self-defense
information pamphlets for campus
residents. The principal obstacle for
both is the lack of University funds
available for printing and distribution.
A petition circulated Friday called
upon the University to fund a mini-bus
service on campus for students who
must be out late working in labs,
libraries or offices.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs for Women Leah
Kaplan, the Office of the Dean has
been looking into the problem for
some time, and agreed that the
restraining factor is money.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape proposed at Friday's meeting
that interested students request
matching funds from the
Administration and the ASSU for a
trial run of a bus service.
Other suggestions for greater
security on campus included: the
creation of a well-lit bicycle path from
the central campus into Palo Alto for
students who must ride at night; the
formation of a "buddy" system for
persons who will be alone in campus

buildings late at night and who would
like to be escorted back to their
residence; and the improvement of
phone access to the Department of
Police Services.
Kaplan and Snape are scheduled to
present their findings on University
financing of some of the safety
proposals at a meeting scheduled for
Friday, Feb. 7.
