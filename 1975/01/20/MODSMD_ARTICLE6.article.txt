# Dial-A-Ride Officials Decide To Buy Cabs
## 
### LONNIE ROSENWALD 
It seems that Santa Clara County is
not yet ready to abandon Dial-A-Ride.
Despite Thursday's 10-8 vote by
the Transportation Commission
recommending that the County
discontinue the bus service, the Transit
District's Board of Directors voted
unanimously Friday afternoon to
purchase the county's eight privately
owned taxicab companies in order to
save Dial-A-Ride.

County Superior Court Judge
Marshall S. Hall had ruled Jan. 9 that
the Transit District Board must either
discontinue the Dial-A-Ride system or
buy out the cab companies.
The Board of Directors Friday
authorized the County Council, a
group of 20 lawyers from throughout
the county, to begin negotiations with
the cab companies to arrange details of
the purchase.
$l-1.5 Million Cost
County Administrative Assistant
Frank Darien estimated the cost of the
transaction, including the sale price
and operating expenses such as cab
driver salaries, would run between $1
million and $1.5 million. If it is drawn
from the operating budget, this sum
would leave the transit district office
in much steeper debt for the year than
anticipated, Darien said.
However, Darien noted, "There's
no transportation system in the United
States that's in the black."

In addition, members of the
County Board of Supervisors expected
incorporation of the cabs in the
Dial-A-Ride system to increase
efficiency and ridership capacity,
presumably increasing revenue from
fares. County officials hope this will
partially offset the financial
disadvantages of the purchase of the
cab companies.
In fact, acquisition of the cabs
would hasten the realization of an
explicit part of the original
Dial-A-Ride concept, Supervisor Don
Cortese explained last week.
Three Types Of Vehicles
This plan called for the eventual
operation of three different types of
vehicles for the various types of
Dial-A-Ride service. While the large
buses presently being utilized by
Dial-A-Ride would be relegated to
their former arterial routes, smaller
vehicles, such as taxicabs, would
provide the system's
demand-responsive service. In addition
transit district aides would like to
introduce limousines to provide
airport and commuter carpool service.
Return of the Dial-A-Ride buses to

the arterial system would allow for
considerable expansion of that phase
of service, both in terms of frequency
and number of routes. This situation
would provide concerned members of
the Stanford community an ideal
opportunity to pressure the County
into providing service within the
campus.
At present, the arterial buses
venture no further than the Quad
entrance at the end of Palm Drive,
while the entire campus, except small
portions of the faculty residence area:,
is excluded from the zone of
Dial-A-Ride service.
