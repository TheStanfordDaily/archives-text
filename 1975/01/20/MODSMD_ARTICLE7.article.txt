# ASSU May Not Offer Financing For Bike Shop
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The ASSU probably will not go
through with plans to finance a
student-run bicycle shop on campus,
Asst. ASSU Financial Manager
Brendan Reidy has announced.
Reidy said that he will submit a
recommendation this week to
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri,
suggesting that the ASSU not start the
shop. Last quarter, Olivieri had
assigned Reidy to investigate the
feasibility of the project.
Reidy said the proposed shop
probably would attract enough
business to require a full-time
manager. That expense would mean
the shop could not keep prices
significantly lower than a privately
owned business could, Reidy
explained.
Steve Seay, the student who first
proposed the bicycle shop, agreed that
the project would probably require a
full-time manager, but said he still
favors the plan. He also pointed out
that there are reasons other than lower
prices for starting a student-run shop.
"The principal reason I saw for
setting up the show was to recycle
student money," Seay said.
Under the proposal he submitted
last autumn, the shop would employ
students instead of outside workers,
and any profits from the operation
would revert to the ASSU.

The existing Campus Bike Shop has
been owned and run since 1951 by
Fred Morse, a former student here.
Morse described his shop as "a family
business" which does not employ
students. He also owns the Campus
Bike Shop in Palo Alto.
Morse's on-campus shop will have
to be moved this spring when
construction begins on a new
engineering building next to the
Women's Gym.
Director of Plant Services Jason
Mavis reported that the University has
been looking for a new location for
this shop. So far the search has been
unsuccessful.
Reidy at one time suggested that
the student-run shop be set up in
Tresidder because of its central
location. Mavis said the University has
not considered Tresidder as a possible
new site for the existing shop.
Seay said he originally took his idea
for a student-run bicycle shop to
Mavis, who directed him to the ASSU
for funding.
Seay then approached Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Dale Snape, who
encouraged him to submit the
proposal to Olivieri, Seay said. So, he
researched prices and demand, and
prepared a concrete plan.
In an interview in November, Snape
told the Daily that a student-run
bicycle shop in Tresidder would help
the ASSU "pay more of its own way."
He said he would like to see a
self-supporting ASSU that could
survive cuts in University support.
The ASSU currently occupies its
offices in Tresidder essentially without
charge. The University also pays the
salaries of two full-time ASSU clerical
employees, the financial managers and
the Council of Presidents.

been owned and run since 1951 by
Fred Morse, a former student here.
Morse described his shop as "a family
business" which does not employ
students. He also owns the Campus
Bike Shop in Palo Alto.
Morse's on-campus shop will have
to be moved this spring when
construction begins on a new
engineering building next to the
Women's Gym.
Director of Plant Services Jason
Mavis reported that the University has
been looking for a new location for
this shop. So far the search has been
unsuccessful.
Reidy at one time suggested that
the student-run shop be set up in
Tresidder because of its central
location. Mavis said the University has
not considered Tresidder as a possible
new site for the existing shop.
Seay said he originally took his idea
for a student-run bicycle shop to
Mavis, who directed him to the ASSU
for funding.
Seay then approached Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Dale Snape, who
encouraged him to submit the
proposal to Olivieri, Seay said. So, he
researched prices and demand, and
prepared a concrete plan.
In an interview in November, Snape
told the Daily that a student-run
bicycle shop in Tresidder would help
the ASSU "pay more of its own way."
He said he would like to see a
self-supporting ASSU that could
survive cuts in University support.
The ASSU currently occupies its
offices in Tresidder essentially without
charge. The University also pays the
salaries of two full-time ASSU clerical
employees, the financial managers and
the Council of Presidents.
The ASSU probably will not go
through with plans to finance a
student-run bicycle shop on campus,
Asst. ASSU Financial Manager
Brendan Reidy has announced.
Reidy said that he will submit a
recommendation this week to
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri,
suggesting that the ASSU not start the
shop. Last quarter, Olivieri had
assigned Reidy to investigate the
feasibility of the project.
Reidy said the proposed shop
probably would attract enough
business to require a full-time
manager. That expense would mean
the shop could not keep prices
significantly lower than a privately
owned business could, Reidy
explained.
Steve Seay, the student who first
proposed the bicycle shop, agreed that
the project would probably require a
full-time manager, but said he still
favors the plan. He also pointed out
that there are reasons other than lower
prices for starting a student-run shop.
"The principal reason I saw for
setting up the show was to recycle
student money," Seay said.
Under the proposal he submitted
last autumn, the shop would employ
students instead of outside workers,
and any profits from the operation
would revert to the ASSU.
