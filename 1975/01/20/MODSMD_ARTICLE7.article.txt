# ASSU May Not Offer Financing For Bike Shop

The ASSU probably will not go
through with plans to finance a
student-run bicycle shop on campus,
Asst. ASSU Financial Manager
Brendan Reidy has announced.
Reidy said that he will submit a
recommendation this week to
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri,
suggesting that the ASSU not start the
shop. Last quarter, Olivieri had
assigned Reidy to investigate the
feasibility of the project.
Reidy said the proposed shop
probably would attract enough
business to require a full-time
manager. That expense would mean
the shop could not keep prices
significantly lower than a privately
owned business could, Reidy
explained.
Steve Seay, the student who first
proposed the bicycle shop, agreed that
the project would probably require a
full-time manager, but said he still
favors the plan. He also pointed out
that there are reasons other than lower
prices for starting a student-run shop.
"The principal reason I saw for
setting up the show was to recycle
student money," Seay said.
Under the proposal he submitted
last autumn, the shop would employ
students instead of outside workers,
and any profits from the operation
would revert to the ASSU.

The existing Campus Bike Shop has
been owned and run since 1951 by
