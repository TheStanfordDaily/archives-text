Garvin Is...(Part II)
Editor:
Rarely have I encountered
anything so blatantly distasteful
as Glenn Garvin's article, "Billie
Makes Way for Real Queen"
(Daily, Jan. 15).
Garvin's feet should remain
firmly implanted in his mouth, in
an obviously forlorn hope that
they would help to muffle him.
I do not dispute Chris Evert's
ability as a tennis player, but I do
take issue with Garvin's
questionable characterizations of
those who do not cheer her on to
victory as a "scruffy group" of
"crazed libbers" who indulge in
"hyena-like fits of giggles" and
"anguished screeches."
"Libbies," a term which Garvin
appears to find entirely acceptable
as a characterization of those
women he does not like, is a term
which should remain confined to
the labels of tomato juice
containers.

Had Garvin simply wished to
compose a paean in honor of
Evert, that "sexy homebody" of a
girl, I would have done no more
than silently remark on the
apparent lapse of judgement by
the editors of the Daily.
Inasmuch, however, as he, by
implication, describes all "female
tennis fans" as being subject to
"gales of laughter" at the mere
mention of "Little Chrissie,"
objects to or is ignorant of the
meaning of the women's
liberation movement, and gives
vent to his feelings by writing
inanities and insults, I wish
someone would toss a couple of
tennis balls down his throat.
But, on second thought, it
probably wouldn't do any good,
anyway.

Editor:
Glenn Garvin has used a sports
analysis to depict his own
distorted, highly emotional,
pathetic attitude toward the
women's liberation movement.
Why must Chris Evert and
Billie Jean King and women
everywhere be typed? In
Garvin's words, King is bellicose, a
jock, a "libber" and sick because
she chooses a career in
broadcasting over a family. And
he types Evert as a homebody, a
"real queen" who is upset because
she has never been called "sexy."
And with what vindictive glee he
labels her "sexy" in the end of his
analysis.
These are two individuals, who
just because they are women, have
their personal beliefs smeared and
maligned in a strangely frentic
attempt by a man to condemn
something he does not understand
and obviously fears.

The women's movement is not
out to create hysterical, crazed,
wolfish, obnoxious women as
Garvin describes the "libbers" he
associates with King. Instead, it is
simply to give women a support
and guide in creating fulfilling
lives for themselves on a uniquely
individual level.

I was very disappointed with
Glenn Garvin when I read his
column about Billie Jean King and
Chris Evert. Overlooking his
off-base comments on King's
ability and fans, I would hope he
would accurately report the views
of Chris Evert, Billie Jean King
and other women players.
Until recently, Evert was under
the strong influence of her
father-coach, who has said his
highest goal for Chris would be
for her to have a "husband and

babies." Evert made statements to
the press such as, "I would never
fall down for a shot. It's so
unfeminine."
Lately, though, she has been
thinking more about her place in
society as a woman. She has
postponed her marriage to fellow
tennis star Jimmy Connors as she
has decided that she does not have
to be married at age 20 and wants
to make her own decisions for the
first time in her life.
Evert, who no longer wants to
be called "Chrissie," credits much
of the progress she has made in
finding herself to King, who
listened to and encouraged her.
The message King wants to give
to Evert and the public and
what Garvin evidentally has
missed is that one does not have
to be a star tennis player or a wife
or a mother but what one's self
really wants to be. She is her own
best example: star tennis player,
wife, head of a corporation,
magazine publisher and sports
commentator.
One final remark on the
headline on Garvin's piece. If it
was not for King, would anyone
care who was the queen of
women's tennis?

Innovation Not Costly
Editor:
We would like to respond to
President Lyman's assertion in the
Jan. 15 Daily that many of
SWOPSI's elements "could be
funded more cheaply within the
regular departments."
SWOPSI has a staff of one and
a half people: a full-time director
and a half-time assistant. The
program offers approximately 60
workshops a year with 900
students enrolled for about 3000
units of credit. The entire
teaching staff serves on a
volunteer basis; each workshop
receives a budget of $5O for
expenses. The total SWOPSI
budget for 1974-75 is $26,000.
We estimate that for regular
departments to offer similar small
workshop classes would cost
approximately $300,000 a
year in faculty time. Of course,
were the departments to allow
para-faculty (community people
and students) to teach these
departmentally-credited courses
the teaching costs would be
reduced.
We doubt that an equal
number of workshops could be
administered more cheaply by
departments than by the current
SWOPSI structure operating at a
reduced budget.
We agree that departments
should adopt SWOPSI-SCIRE
type courses. However, we think
that the programs serve vital
functions in addition to offering
individual courses and that these
functions can only be maintained
by <1; . independent, non
departmental programs.
SWOPSI has the willingness to
offer topical courses on
controversial issues and the ability
to provide learning experiences
that integrate theoretical
knowledge with action.
We think the elimination of
these programs goes beyond
budget considerations. The issue is
not the need to cut staff costs but
the cost to the University of
eliminating real educational
options like SWOPSI and SCIRE.
SWOPSI staff costs can be cut and
the program maintained. We think
the University should state clearly
the educational priorities that
dictate the end of this highly
successful program.
