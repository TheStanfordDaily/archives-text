It has happened that way often in the past. Many of the col
lege graduates who join us decide to build satisfying life
time careers in our organization.
Why this decision?
□ Perhaps because of the relative stability of Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft over the years. This has resulted from
a talent for providing continually more powerful engines
for the majority of commercial aircraft operated by air
lines of the free-world.
□ Perhaps a significant factor has been the planned diver
sification into non-aircraft fields. For example, we have
developed jet engines that now provide power for
utilities, high-speed trains, marine vessels, chemical
complexes and other applications.
□ Perhaps the emphasis on new products with exceptional
growth potential. Fuel cell powerplants that do not pol
lute the atmosphere and are far-more efficient in produc
ing energy from scarce fuel typify this aspect.
□ Perhaps an important plus has been a competitive salary
structure ancl increasingly more important assignments
that lead to attractive futures in management.
□ Perhaps most important, for many, has been the chal
lenge of working at the frontiers of the art in virtually
every technical and scientific field. Certainly, ability is
tested to the utmost in improving powerplants that can
lift their own weight plus additional thousands of pounds
of plane, passengers and cargo. This ability is tested,
too, in the development of new and better ways to utilize
the world's energy resources.
We have attractive career opportunities for engineers, sci
entists and graduates in a variety of
other specialities such as account- H
ing and business administration. So ynLITtV
