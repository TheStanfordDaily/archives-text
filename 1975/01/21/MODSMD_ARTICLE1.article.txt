# Up To 30 Positions Endangered By Cuts
## 
### DON COX 
Up to 30 faculty positions can be
cut out of the School of Humanities
and Sciences through attrition as part
of the budget-cutting
campaign, said Halsey Royden, the
school's dean.
If position cuts of this magnitude
are necessary, however, hiring rates for
the next three years would have to be
halved, Royden told 30 of the school's
faculty members yesterday in
Annenberg Auditorium.
Royden emphasized that even the
worst cuts could be made without
"yanking a position out from under a
faculty member.
"We have tried to make cuts which
we believe will have a marginal impact
on the program. We made none, or very
few, that will cripple or even badly
lame any programs," he said.
The position cuts could be made
through retirement and resignations,
Royden said, based on an estimate he
had made. Replacing retired senior
faculty members with junior faculty
* could also "result in significant
savings.
"However, we have not planned on
elimination of any assistant professor
position inhabited by an assistant
professor under consideration for
promotion. We may also be in the
position that promotion decisions will
not and should not be strongly
affected by budget decisions," Royden
said.
While the projected cuts are "not
nearly as drastic as we feared,"
Royden said he plans to negotiate with
administrators to minimize the size of
the cuts for his school.
He added that he felt the School of
Humanities and Sciences should bear
less of the budget cuts since it was
"responsible for 85 to 90 percent of
undergraduate education."
"We're unlike the Law School.
Their solution is simple. Just admit
more students to raise funds. Their
situation is not even comparable to
ours, which is much more complex,"
Royden said.
He admitted, however, that there
was a legitimate question of
equitability involved with making one
school bear a disproportionate share of

the financial burden.
Royden said that he naturally
preferred not to eliminate faculty
positions. "We are trying to make the
argument to the president and the
provost that it's more important to cut
support services rather than
personnel."
Prof. William Clebsch, chairman of
the Religious Studies Department,
agreed with Royden. "A University
without faculty and students doesn't
need any administrators. A University
with faculty and students could use
fewer administrators than in the past,"
Clebsch said. •
A number of faculty members at
the meeting expressed their
apprehension about the size of the
cuts and the feeling that even at the
end of the three-year budget-cutting
program, more cuts would be
necessary as new financial problems
arose. Many said they thought the
faculty was being left out of the
budget-cutting decision process.
"This whole thing is fantastically
depressing. What if it happens again? "
said Classics Prof. Ronald Mellor.
He was also disturbed by "the
terrible inability to find that point in
time after which information has been
gathered to make a decision, but
before the immutable decisions have
been made."
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs
Arthur Bienenstock said he shared the
apprehension of the faculty members
but noted that "the magnitude of the
faculty cuts will take us back to a
faculty size greater than it was during
the 1968-69 school year."
Clebsch foresaw the possible need
of an emergency slush fund for
acquiring extraordinary faculty
members or unusual programs that
might become available unexpectedly.
He also said he thought it was a
"scandal" that there was no
democratic faculty body representing
faculty interests in the budget
decisions.
Royden said he would give this
problem some attention and hopefully
create a proper body after the current
budget crisis subsides somewhat.

argument to the president and the
provost that it's more important to cut
support services rather than
personnel."
Prof. William Clebsch, chairman of
the Religious Studies Department,
agreed with Royden. "A University
without faculty and students doesn't
need any administrators. A University
with faculty and students could use
fewer administrators than in the past,"
Clebsch said. •
A number of faculty members at
the meeting expressed their
apprehension about the size of the
cuts and the feeling that even at the
end of the three-year budget-cutting
program, more cuts would be
necessary as new financial problems
arose. Many said they thought the
faculty was being left out of the
budget-cutting decision process.
"This whole thing is fantastically
depressing. What if it happens again? "
said Classics Prof. Ronald Mellor.
He was also disturbed by "the
terrible inability to find that point in
time after which information has been
gathered to make a decision, but
before the immutable decisions have
been made."
Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs
Arthur Bienenstock said he shared the
apprehension of the faculty members
but noted that "the magnitude of the
faculty cuts will take us back to a
faculty size greater than it was during
the 1968-69 school year."
Clebsch foresaw the possible need
of an emergency slush fund for
acquiring extraordinary faculty
members or unusual programs that
might become available unexpectedly.
He also said he thought it was a
"scandal" that there was no
democratic faculty body representing
faculty interests in the budget
decisions.
Royden said he would give this
problem some attention and hopefully
create a proper body after the current
budget crisis subsides somewhat.
Up to 30 faculty positions can be
cut out of the School of Humanities
and Sciences through attrition as part
of the budget-cutting
campaign, said Halsey Royden, the
school's dean.
If position cuts of this magnitude
are necessary, however, hiring rates for
the next three years would have to be
halved, Royden told 30 of the school's
faculty members yesterday in
Annenberg Auditorium.
Royden emphasized that even the
worst cuts could be made without
"yanking a position out from under a
faculty member.
"We have tried to make cuts which
we believe will have a marginal impact
on the program. We made none, or very
few, that will cripple or even badly
lame any programs," he said.
The position cuts could be made
through retirement and resignations,
Royden said, based on an estimate he
had made. Replacing retired senior
faculty members with junior faculty
* could also "result in significant
savings.
"However, we have not planned on
elimination of any assistant professor
position inhabited by an assistant
professor under consideration for
promotion. We may also be in the
position that promotion decisions will
not and should not be strongly
affected by budget decisions," Royden
said.
While the projected cuts are "not
nearly as drastic as we feared,"
Royden said he plans to negotiate with
administrators to minimize the size of
the cuts for his school.
He added that he felt the School of
Humanities and Sciences should bear
less of the budget cuts since it was
"responsible for 85 to 90 percent of
undergraduate education."
"We're unlike the Law School.
Their solution is simple. Just admit
more students to raise funds. Their
situation is not even comparable to
ours, which is much more complex,"
Royden said.
He admitted, however, that there
was a legitimate question of
equitability involved with making one
school bear a disproportionate share of

the financial burden.
Royden said that he naturally
preferred not to eliminate faculty
positions. "We are trying to make the
argument to the president and the
provost that it's more important to cut
