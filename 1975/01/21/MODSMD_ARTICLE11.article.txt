# Parking Fee Breeds Gross Inequity
## 
### Stephen Carter 
Imagine a country in which one group of
citizens, poor and heavily taxed, is required
to pay a sum of money for privileges they
often cannot or do not use.
In this same imaginary country, another
group of citizens, paid by the government
with the taxes paid by the poorer citizens, is
extended the same privileges for free.
More than one traditional liberal would
lament the fate of the poorer citizens of that
country, perhaps call upon the United States
to cease all aid to it until conditions got
better. Perhaps the United States could be
persuaded to withhold "most favored
nation" trading status until the other country
changed its discriminatory policies.
Unfortunately, the same administration
which has for years run this University as an
undemocratic feifdom has, once again, forced
its insensitive and illogical whims upon the
University community.
Generation Of Income?
The problem, of course, is that students
are now required to purchase "parking"
stickers for $7.50 in order to operate a motor
vehicle on campus. The money, according to
Vice President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger, really goes to
"generation of income."

Of course, students alone must pay the
tax. (The analogy of the tax is a crude one,
certainly, but it's one that the University
insists on drawing.) Faculty members,

Augsburger has "explained," cannot be
taxed, because the University would then
have to raise their salaries.

What do students get for this payment.
Well, explains the University nothing,
really. But that's all right, Augsburger hastens
to add, because the fee may be considered a
tax which "bears little or no relationship to
specific benefits received by those individuals
who pay the tax."
Strange Requirements
Let's look briefly at this train of thought.
First, the University calls it a "parking" fee.
That's odd to begin with, since, for example,
students who live on campus, but not within
the housing system (e.g., with a professor)
must pay the tax, but cannot legally park
anywhere on campus.
Students who live in Escondido Village
can reach their homes without using
University roads, anyway, but are forced to
pay simply to leave their cars at home.
Similarly, students who live in dorms must
pay to have a car on campus, even though
they must park next to their dorms, and
nowhere else.
What sort of nonsense is this, anyway?
- But that isn't enough, the University
continues magnanimously. Professors and
other employees will not be charged.
Students shell out in excess of $4OOO
annually to attend Stanford. Staff members,
in turn, are paid by the University.

Consequently, the students, who can ill
afford the investment, are charged, whereas
the faculty members, who at least receive a
livable wage, are not.

Is the University afraid of a general strike
were they to charge other employees? Does it
think, perhaps, United Stanford Employees
would protest? Would economics professors
refuse to hold classes?
Apathetic Students
And if the University is afraid of its
employees, does it then hold students in
lower esteem. Does it assume that the
students are powerless to fight back, and thus
charging them is a better risk?
Unfortunately or perhaps, fortunately,
because the answer might be terrifying no
administrator has offered a cohesive
argument on these points. But then, since the
decline of the "good ol' days" of campus
activism, the University has increasingly seen
no need or at least, acted as though there
were none for student input on major
decisions.

The University, as aforementioned, seems
to assume it can freely abuse students and
the student rights because students don't
fight back. The awful part is, that for all its
apparent insensitivity, the administration is
probably right.

What do students get for this payment.
Well, explains the University nothing,
really. But that's all right, Augsburger hastens
to add, because the fee may be considered a
tax which "bears little or no relationship to
specific benefits received by those individuals
who pay the tax."
Strange Requirements
Let's look briefly at this train of thought.
First, the University calls it a "parking" fee.
That's odd to begin with, since, for example,
students who live on campus, but not within
the housing system (e.g., with a professor)
must pay the tax, but cannot legally park
anywhere on campus.
Students who live in Escondido Village
can reach their homes without using
University roads, anyway, but are forced to
pay simply to leave their cars at home.
Similarly, students who live in dorms must
pay to have a car on campus, even though
they must park next to their dorms, and
nowhere else.
What sort of nonsense is this, anyway?
- But that isn't enough, the University
continues magnanimously. Professors and
other employees will not be charged.
Students shell out in excess of $4OOO
annually to attend Stanford. Staff members,
in turn, are paid by the University.

Consequently, the students, who can ill
afford the investment, are charged, whereas
the faculty members, who at least receive a
livable wage, are not.

Is the University afraid of a general strike
were they to charge other employees? Does it
think, perhaps, United Stanford Employees
would protest? Would economics professors
refuse to hold classes?
Apathetic Students
And if the University is afraid of its
employees, does it then hold students in
lower esteem. Does it assume that the
students are powerless to fight back, and thus
charging them is a better risk?
Unfortunately or perhaps, fortunately,
because the answer might be terrifying no
administrator has offered a cohesive
argument on these points. But then, since the
decline of the "good ol' days" of campus
activism, the University has increasingly seen
no need or at least, acted as though there
were none for student input on major
decisions.

The University, as aforementioned, seems
to assume it can freely abuse students and
the student rights because students don't
fight back. The awful part is, that for all its
apparent insensitivity, the administration is
probably right.

editorial board. His column appears every

Imagine a country in which one group of
citizens, poor and heavily taxed, is required
to pay a sum of money for privileges they
often cannot or do not use.
In this same imaginary country, another
group of citizens, paid by the government
with the taxes paid by the poorer citizens, is
extended the same privileges for free.
More than one traditional liberal would
lament the fate of the poorer citizens of that
country, perhaps call upon the United States
to cease all aid to it until conditions got
better. Perhaps the United States could be
persuaded to withhold "most favored
nation" trading status until the other country
changed its discriminatory policies.
Unfortunately, the same administration
which has for years run this University as an
undemocratic feifdom has, once again, forced
its insensitive and illogical whims upon the
University community.
Generation Of Income?
The problem, of course, is that students
are now required to purchase "parking"
stickers for $7.50 in order to operate a motor
vehicle on campus. The money, according to
Vice President for Business and Finance
Robert Augsburger, really goes to
"generation of income."

Of course, students alone must pay the
tax. (The analogy of the tax is a crude one,
certainly, but it's one that the University
insists on drawing.) Faculty members,

Augsburger has "explained," cannot be
taxed, because the University would then
have to raise their salaries.

What do students get for this payment.
Well, explains the University nothing,
really. But that's all right, Augsburger hastens
to add, because the fee may be considered a
tax which "bears little or no relationship to
specific benefits received by those individuals
