More On SWOPSI
Editor:
Even though it seems to be
open season on administrators
these days, fair is fair, and Dean
Gibbs' decision to phase down
SCIRE and SWOPSI makes sense.
I yield to no one in support and
interest in student-initiated
programs, and it's time to declare
SCIRE and SWOPSI successes and
get on with things.
On balance, the
student-initiated programs have
been successful, and they have
proven the point that the
combination of student initative
and rigorous supervision by
qualified personnel can lead to a
useful and gratifying teaching and
learning experience.
Rather than keeping the
student-initiated programs in their
own often ambiguous and
sometimes isolated position,
perhaps it is best for the academic
departments to take on the full
job of being responsive to
students' legitimate learning
objectives, and for the SCIRE and
SWOPSI administrative and review
apparatus to be dismantled.
The message of SCIRE's and
SWOPSI's success is clear enough
to the departments, and I would
hope that even in these days of
fiscal stringency they can
continue what is now a tradition
of responsiveness to students and
innovative approach to learning
and teaching.

Trouncing the extra
departmental programs completes
the final step in clinching
Stanford as a "research
university." If this action is
effected, what does that say about
the importance of undergraduate
"liberal education" at this
university?
When Dean James Gibbs
announced SWOPSI's demise last
week, he catalyzed a startled and
angry reaction from the student
community. Obviously students
realize SWOPSI's importance in
providing undergraduates with
creative, relevant educational
alternatives. This student concern
must be channelled into a
well-organized effort that will
demonstrate to Provost Miller the
strength of SWOPSI's community

support.
A student meeting held in
Wilbur last Friday decided to
focus their energy toward a
petition drive. The more
signatures that Provost William
Miller and the Trustees can be
shown, the more they will be
forced to recognize SWOPSI's
place in undergraduate education.
(Petitions may be signed and
picked up for circulation in the
SWOPSI office.)
SWOPSI is by definition
controversial and often at odds
with departmental structure and
goals; this is exactly why SWOPSI
can only remain separate and
independent. SWOPSI should be
preserved; its contribution has
been too great for it to become
lost in the blender of
administrative rationality.

Garvin 15... (Part III)
Editor:
I was saddened by Glenn
Garvin's article (Daily, Jan. 15) on
Billie Jean King and Chris Evert. I
found it unreasonably vindictive
and snotty, and was surprised to
read such an informationless,
uncalled for, immature column in
the Daily.
What possible value can
material like this have for your
readers; certainly most of them
will not take it seriously. I am
sorry Garvin feels so badly about
women. That, if nothing else, is
communicated by the article.
In his attempt to degrade King,
he does Evert no favor. I'm sure
both women would be embarassed
to see themselves portrayed in
such a ridiculous and unkind way.
Garvin implies that King's values
are sick. I have to question his.

Editor:
The Daily, in an ad asking for
new staff members, claims that
"no one cares if you know how to
write headlines we can teach
y0u..." Apparently no one
cares either if sports writers are
idiotic, juvenile and frustrated,
illustrated by the fact that Glenn
Garvin is allowed to rant in the
Daily.

Scattered through Garvin's Jan.
15 article, one may detect one or
two valid points which deal with
tennis, but for the most part, he
simply wishes to show his ecstasy
at the fact that Billie Jean King is
finally losing her leading position.
Garvin is full of venom (and that's
not all) when it comes to all
"libbies" those who, in his
distorted view of things, are
apparently rabid men-haters
simply because they choose
careers and alternative values to
the traditional mother and wife
role.
Therefore, we have Garvin
blasting King for aspiring to
become a sportscaster, while
bestowing the title of "sexy"
upon "homebody" Chris Evert.
He seems to consider this the
supreme compliment. That is
enough to make one sick.
I personally am not too
interested in the sport of tennis,
but do admire both women for
their amazing skill. It disgusts me
though, to read so-called sports
articles written by boys like
Garvin who obviously feel so
threatened by strong women that
they border on hysteria.

Had Glenn Garvin wished to
write a criticism of the feminist
movement, it would seem that a
more appropriate setting than the
Daily could have been found.
Comprehensive tennis coverage
should fill the sports section with
detailed information of the
play-by-play action of the game.
Garvin's article certainly fails
to do this, while simultaneously
demonstrating his ignornace of
the feminist movement.

Wallowing in misguided
chauvinism, Garvin begins his
supposed "coverage" of the match
by stating the incompatibility of
feminism and hair dryers. But
Garvin's insult to our intelligence
is only the beginning.
Is it really so incomprehensible
that those "anguished screeches
from the libbies" had no
association with feminism
whatsoever? I imagine King still
has a few fans around somewhere
even without Garvin to rally them
together.
Throughout the article, readers
follow Garvin's transformation
from pseudo-sportswriter to

feminist opponent and wonder
what could possible be next.
Miraculously, he leads us to the
divinely inspired answer to the
question "whose values are sick?"
Although Garvin claims King
to be the recipient of this
allocation, his ridiculous article
cinches his own candidacy.

Scalping
Editor:
Since I was unable to buy a
ticket to the UCLA-Stanford
basketball game in advance, I
decided to go early and purchase
one from somebody at the gate.
I expected the prices to be a
little higher than the Athletic
Department's and they indeed
were. Reserved tickets normally
$3, were being sold for from $5
to $lO.
In front of one gate alone,
there must have been close to 10
"scalpers", some with at least
20 tickets.
I was approached by someone
who played tennis with me on my
high school team last year who
offered me a $3 reserved ticket
for $5, which I refused. He
proceeded to sell several for $6.
I recognized a senior from my
high school who was showing his
approving father the handful of
tickets he was going to sell for
$lO apiece.
I even spotted two "pros" who
were actually selling tickets to
fellow scalpers and any other
interested customers. I overheard
one "pro" say, "Look, I got to
make a living."
"Scalping", the act of buying a
large quantity of tickets and
selling them at two, three or four
times their value, happens to be
illegal in California.
I'm sure quite a few people
were prevented from seeing their
dream of witnessing Stanford
defeat UCLA come true by a few
greedy and disgusting characters
out to make a fast buck.
A couple of sheriff's deputies
or ticket takers should circulate
outside the gates to discourage the
illegal and unethical practice of
scalping. It is simply unfair and
intolerable to allow a few
individuals to "rip off" a large
group of people when stopping
them would be relatively easy.
