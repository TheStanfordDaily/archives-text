# Ford Defies Courts
## 
### James Lobsenz 
President Ford apparently
cares as little for the rule of law as
did his predecessor Richard
Nixon. The solicitor general of the
United States, Robert Bork, has
announced that the President
intends neither to appeal a recent
ruling of the United States
Appeals Court for the District of
Columbia, nor to observe the rule
handed down in that court's
decision.
Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) took Nixon to court
and won a Federal District Court
ruling that Nixon's pocket-veto of
a 1970 congressional law was
unconstitutional. Kennedy
claimed that a pocket veto can be
used only after Congress adjourns
permanently at the end of one of
its two-year sessions.
Nixon contended that a pocket
veto could be used during any
congressional recess.
Ordinarily a bill passed by
Congress automatically becomes
law when a President does not
return the bill to Congress within
10 days of his receiving it.
But Article I, Section 7 of the
Constitution states that if "the
Congress, by their adjournment
prevent its [the bill's]
return ... it shall not be a law."
Center Of Controversy
The center of this legal
controversy, then, concerns the
question of whether or not a
temporary recess of Congress
prevents a President from
returning a bill. The District Court
for the District of Columbia ruled
that a temporary recess does not
"prevent" the President from
returning a bill. Recently the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia upheld this view.
But Ford has continued to use
the pocket veto in this manner
and has stated his intention to
continue pocket veto bills that
displease him through temporary
congressional recesses.
Bork has maintained that he
cannot "in good conscience"
make an appeal to the Supreme
Court concerning the U.S. Court
of Appeals ruling because he does
not believe that Kennedy has any
legal standing to bring a suit
against the President. Both the
District Court and the Court of
Appeals ruled, however, ruled that
he did have this right.
Honest Image Needed

It would appear to me that the 5 :
Ford Administration must do one
of two things in order to
demonstrate a respect for the law
and to create an image of honest
cooperation with the courts.
Either the U.S. Court of
Appeals ruling must be obeyed, or
it must be appealed to the
Supreme Court. Perhaps Ford
fears, as Nixon did, that the
Supreme Court will rule against
him. Perhaps he sincerely believes
that the presidency is being
assailed and that its powers are
systematically being curtailed.
But in any event, I find that I
agree with Kennedy, who argues
that Ford is "trying to have it
both ways." Ford "wants to
ignore the court's decision and
also wants to have continue to use
the pocket-veto."
But in the most strictly legal
sense, Ford has the right to
continue to use the pocket veto in
the manner that he and Nixon
have used it in the past.
Extended Logic

A court ruling applies in the
strictest legal sense only to the
two parties in the case at hand,
and only to the one situation
reviewed by the court. But
arguing that Ford can thus ignore
the court's ruling in all other cases
would be about as absurd as
arguing that no public school in
the country except those in
Topeka, Kansas, has to obey the
historic 1954 desegregation ruling
set forth in Brown v. Topeka
Board of Education.
Ford's actions can only be
viewed as betraying a flagrant
disrespect for the courts. Kennedy
has promised that he will take
further legal action and won't let
the issue die. One of the options
open to him is to ask Congress to
appropriate a small amount of
money for one of the bills that
Ford pocket vetoed in an
allegedly unconstitutional
manner. Then he can ask the
courts to rule that the money
must be spent.
Kennedy has stated that the
Ford Administration, "by its act,
defies the rule of law and
disregards the court. I had hoped
that this Nixonian attitude
towards the law was vanishing
with Watergate, but obviously it is
not."
I concur with Kennedy.
