## Toyon's 'Momma' Shares Candy, Advice, Jokes 
### J. KELLY BUFTON 
"Do you know how God made
Italians?" grinned the woman
behind the desk. "He put a pizza
in this hand and a pizza in this
hand and went 'Wop!' " The two
"pizzas" flew together.
Norma Vannucci Meloling
rocked with laughter in her office
chair. It was the third time she'd
told the joke that day. She would
tell it twice more before the day
was out.

Most of the people in the
Toyon office just looked at each
other and shrugged. This
joke-teller was the dorm secretary
that they loved and cherished
even if the jokes vtere pretty bad.
Toyonites have endured
Meloling's jokes for five years. In
that time "Momma Toy" has
become a tradition, something as
integral to Toyon's character as its
distinctive towers or cavernous
lounge.
"Norma is no longer a dorm
secretary," said Gioia Kelley,
Toyon's director and a three-year
resident. "She's become a dorm
mother someone to help you
when you've got problems real
or imagined."
'Mother Hen'
Meloling looks and acts like a
cross between a mother and a
grandmother. Her salt-and-pepper
hair betrays her age but the rest of
her body hasn't gotten the
message and moves at the same
pace as the "children" she cares
for.

"She acts just like one of the
kids," said Lois Carroll, a
freshman. Unlike » some
grandmothers, her advice is
sensible and up-to-date. Unlike
some mothers, she chastises or
punishes no one for shortcomings
or wrongdoings.
"She's always one who'll listen
to you and hold your hand when
you need it," said Joe Karger,
senior and three-year Toyon
resident. Kelley characterized her
as "a mother hen."
"I've tried to become
somebody to talk to who doesn't

just listen, but hears what people
are saying," Meloling explained.
"I'm a shoulder to cry on." As she
chatted she stapled programs
together for Toyon's fall play
more or less one of her secretarial
duties.
"She's not exactly efficient,"
Kelley said. A student sitting in
the office laughed at that. "Yea,
just look at her desk."
It is difficult to find anything
pertaining to secretarial duties on
her desk. Buried in a sheaf of
programs is Course Abstracts,
while a few memos from Assoc.
Dean of Students Larry Horton
peek from beneath a poster for A
Christmas Carol. Along one edge
are a few small puzzles to keep
idle hands and minds busy.
Functional Clutter
The phone and a pair of
cluttered boxes marked "IN" and
"OUT" are placed on the far
corner of the desk as an
afterthought. Miscellaneous
papers, books, ashtrays and a
candy jar manage to obscure the
rest of the desk top. The drawers
are a jumble of rubber bands,
string, paper clips and other daily
necessities.

"She gets the things done that
have to be done, though, besides
doing a log of things not required
of any dorm secretary," Kelley
pointed out.
One of those "things" involves
learning all the incoming
freshmen's names and faces. "I
walked up to the office the first
day and she goes 'You're Lois
Carroll, aren't you? Here's your
R.A.' I about fainted," Lois
remembered. "She knows
everything," marveled another
freshman, Diana Hu.

"I've done that every year I've
been here," Meloling related. "I
feel like I should be able to say
'Kelly, this is Steve, he's a
freshman in Room 212.' People
should know each other. That's
why I encourage people to go to
the theater and why we have

organized trips there. It's an
icebreaker. Besides, I love the
theater any theater."
Toyon Attraction
j Meloling's presence makes her
cluttered office one of Toyon's
social centers. The candy jar on
her desk brings in people like a
flower attracts bees. They swarm
to it and consume eight to 10
pounds of sweets a week, "I
discovered she had candy and
coffee in her office when I was a
freshman," said Karger, "and I
used to spend part of every day in
there."

"It all started when this sweet,
Jewish boy from Chicago was
here," said Meloling in a
contrived Bronx-Jewish accent.
"He was really broken-hearted at
not being able to go home for
Thanksgiving, so I baked him
some cookies. A couple weeks
later, it was Hanukkah and he was
feeling bad again so I gave him
some candy. He brought it down
to the office to share it. It was so
popular I decided to continue
buying it and there's been candy
on my desk ever since."
She shifted from stapling to
smoking, occasionally interrupting
herself to answer the phone or tell
her pizza joke to an unsuspecting
student.
Open Door Policy
"I think my office should be
open. I shouldn't be someone to
just sit here and dispense forms
and write memos and answer the
phone," she continued. "There's a
lot of unfriendliness at Stanford
and people like to be able to come
here and sit and just chat, eat
candy, or whatever.
Five years ago, when her
friends had pulled her into an
interview to fill a vacancy in
Toyon's office, she had protested
vehemently. "A couple of my
friends had had the job earlier,
and when the last one left, she
told me to try to get it. I said I'd
think about it. A couple days later
Mary called and said she'd made
an appointment for me to be
interviewed.

"I kept telling them how
terrible I was and they kept saying
'Oh, that's all right.' The next day
they called and said I had the job.
'Nitty-Gritty
"The first day I was scared to
death. I thought of all those
brilliant, brilliant people who'd
look down on me. It wasn't that
way at all. I found they had a lot
of things I could learn and vice
versa. I learned a lot of naughty,
naughty words, too, and at first I
was appalled. I'm basically very
straight when you get down to the
nitty-gritty."
She continued, "I'm so straight
I thought The Happy Hooker was
about drug addicts. A guy was
talking about the book and I said
that and he cracked up. I went
home, pulled down the shades
and read it—alone."

Meloling is constantly reading
books and articles directed her
way by students, especially during
the summer. "My favorite reading
is the New Yorker. I send them
my short stories and they send me
their rejection notices. We carry
on quite a correspondence."
Meloling draws on "my own
experiences for the subjects for
my stories." Those experiences
started August 22,1923, on San
Francisco's Filbert Street, where
she was born. She graduated from
San Jose State "in the 40s" and
became an occupational therapist.
She later married and had two
daughters, Denise, now 24; and
Yvonne, 19.
Treasured Trips
Although she has never lived
outside the Bay Area, she travels
frequently including trips to
Europe, Hawaii and Mexico. "I
went to Italy and saw where my
people came from and I just broke
down and cried. It just did that to
me.
Some students believe that the
recipe for her infamous punch was
discovered on one of her trips.
Usually served at parties for the
casts of Toyon plays, the punch
includes orange-juice, wine, some

sort of hard liquor and unknown
other ingredients. She usually
ferments it from three to five days
before serving it. It's very good,
students say, but tends to catch
unwary freshmen by surprise.
Besides the cast parties,
Meloling keeps her home open at
all times to help her "children."
"I suppose about 200 people a
year come here it's somewhere
to go when they need help, want
to talk, want to crash or just
want to get away."
Meloling rarely gets in anyone
else's bad graces. She pulls tricks
on her "children" but none are
malicious and it seems impossible
to hold a grudge against her.

One of her favorite ruses
involves dittos. "People come and
ask if they can buy some dittos,
and I go through the whole thing
about getting them from their
departments and all. They give me
a sob story and I say 'O.K., they
cost 10 cents apiece or two for a
quarter.' Nine out of 10 take the
two." She lapsed into
uncontrolled laughter over that, as
did everyone in the office.

ON ONE HAND—Toyon residents say Norma Meloling is their
"mother hen." On the other hand, her penchant for joke-telling and
practical jokes makes her "just one of the kids."
