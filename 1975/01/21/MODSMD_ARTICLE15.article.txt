Why is Financial Aids, the Academic
Information Center, etc., closed from 12-1?
Couldn't they stay open when most students are
free to visit them?—G.N.
Both Robert Huff, the director of financial aids,
and Elizabeth Meyer, assistant director of the AIC,
seemed rather surprised by your question. They
said they've had few, if any, requests to stay open
during lunchtime. Huff said that he would be
willing to consider it if he received a large
number of student requests. However, both said
that this time is usually reserved for administrative
meetings.
How many bicyclists have been ticketed in the
last year?—R.J.
TTie Department of Public Safety didn't start
ticketing bicyclists until the second week of

November 1974, but since then has apparently
been very diligent in bringing criminal bikers to
justice. According to the secretary of the
department, 75 tickets were given between then
and the last week of December.
Who 's smarter, Raquel Welch or Spiro
Agnew?—J.D.W.
What do you mean by "smarter"? Raquel Welch
has never been vice president. But then, she hasn't
ever been convicted of tax evasion either.
At any rate, Raquel has listed her IQ as 152.
And Spiro Agnew once said his IQ was 135 (both
scores are based on the Stanford-Bine t test). So if
IQ scores are what you mean by "smart," well
then, there's your answer.
Hope you won your bet. Or whatever it was.
