## Tom Sawyer's 'State of Man' Actor Handles Tough Job 
### ANN HOFFMAN 
Actor Tom Sawyer, during his
Friday night performance, "State
of Man", inadvertently defined
the inherent problem in
presenting a one-man evening with
Shakespeare.
"Like TV dinners and Reader's
Digest ," he noted between two
selections, "it's an American
custom to condense everything."
Sawyer's medium, that of
performing short selections from
Shakespeare's most, noteworthy
plays, turns on the question of
legitimate artistic condensation.
His medium straddles a tenuous
line between unity of
interpretation and dilettant
hodge-podge.

"An evening with
Shakespeare" could have easily
become three hours of
"Shadespeare's Greatest Hits."
Though Sawyer, a skilled
Shakespearean actor, did manage
to avoid the pitfall of tasteless
mixing, his mode of solo
presentation created several
unsettling and basically
unavoidable problems.
The selections, anthologized
not by Sawyer but by George
Rylands, were divided into three
parts. Part one dealt with "Youth,
Fantasy and Love;" the second
section was broadly titled
"Kingship, War and Civil Strife,
Passion and Character," and the
third centered on "Sleep, Death
and Dreams."
The three categories were so
broad that they only loosely tied
together Sawyer's various
characterizations. After each
division the audience was left with
no sense of thematic
development. Perhaps this was not
Ry land's intention, but such
categories raised expectations for
a coherent set of themes.

Though there was no real unity
of content within the three
sections, the tone of each was
pleasantly consistent. The first
was composed mainly of comic
sequences from such works as "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" and
"The Merchant of Venice."
Passages from the history plays
comprised the second section and
the third dealt with speeches from
such tragedies as "Macbeth" and
"Hamlet."
Sawyer proved by the end of
the evening that he was equally
adept at handling both comic and
serious roles. His performance of
Polonius' "to thine own self be
true" monologue was delivered no
less perceptively or forcefully
than Mark Antony's "Brutus is an
honorable man" speech.
The difficulties in Sawyer's
performance came not from his
individual characterizations, but
with the transition periods in
between. Like a stand-up
comedian, Sawyer felt obliged to
assure us continually that there
really was a connection between
each piece.
Consequently, he used his
loose, caustic style to push us
from one presentation into the

next. This worked quite well
during the beginning of the
performance, but tended later,
during the more serious pieces, to
cheapen his fine characterizations.
After a thoughtful rendition
from "Henry VI," Sawyer broke
through the audience's quiet
admiration by quipping, "Upset,
wasn't he?"
Such jarring inconsistencies
between Sawyer the narrator and
Sawyer the actor occurred several
times throughout the evening,
seemingly indicating the actor's
understandable discomfort in
performing over half-a-dozen of
Shakespeare's heaviest speeches in
one show.
Sawyer presented 30 pieces
from 21 plays and five poems. For
the Shakespearean purist, the
continual transition from one
character to another may have
been rather unsettling, like
flipping through the pages of

Shakespeare's complete works,
rather than reading each play in
its entirety. Sawyer himself was
sometimes confused about which
number he was going to perform
next, and in one instance left a
piece out completely.
The absence of clear-cut
breaks between presentations,
such as blackouts or change of
costume, only complicated the
many characterizations. Sawyer
was forced to play yet another
role, that of the self-conscious
entertaining narrator.
Sawyer insisted that
Shakespeare, not he, was the star
of the show. Yet, in playing both
actor and narrator the
professional actor was constantly
interjecting himself between the
audience and the presentations.
Sawyer's interjections were not
offensive, merely disconcerting at
times. The viewer could not ask
for a more amiable and capable

guide for an evening with
Shakespeare. Having acted for 35
years both in the United States and
England, Sawyer was able to liven
his introductions with amusing
anecdotes and witty
interpretations.
Born in Missouri, Sawyer
studied drama at Oxford. After
performing professionally with
several companies, he began his
solo tour in 1968.
During intermissions, he
gratuitously announced the score
of the Stanford-UCLA basketball
game. "You haven't missed a
thing," he assured his audience.
At one point he offered a new
Riverside volume of the complete
works of Shakespeare to anyone
who could remember the first
names of the Andrews Sisters.
Sawyer quite naturally
concluded his performance with
Prospero's last speech from the
"Tempest," Now my charms are
all o'erthrown ..."
Though Sawyer was often a
disconcerting element throughout
his own performance, his
individual interpretations were
certainly no discredit to
Shakespeare's works. Like
Prospero, Sawyer may have
attempted the unfeasible, but
nonetheless, he was deserving of
our applause.
