# Symphony Highlights Messiaen

SAN FRANCISCO- Olivier
Messiaen may be unfamiliar to
some audiences, but he is rapidly
gaining recognition as one of the
great composers of the twentieth
century.
The San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra devoted its entire
evening program last week to
the performance of Messiaen's
"Turangalila-Symphonie,"
completed in 1948 and originally
commissioned for the Boston
Symphony Orchestra.
The "Symphonie" stands alone
in the contemporary music genre
because of its distinct

romanticism that is so rarely
found in works of this period.
Love and nature are the themes
explored by the 10 movements,
as expressed by titles such as
"Garden of the Sleep of Love,"
"Love Song" and "Joy in the
Blood of the Stars." The name
"Turangalila" itself is a poetic and
( rhythmical interpretation of a
i Hindu love song,
i Yvonne Loriod, piano, and
' Jeanne Loriod, Les
Ondes-Martenot, were soloists,
i They are sisters and come from a
very musical family, but each is an
outstanding musician in her own
right.
The difficult piano part carries

much of the orchestra, using the
entire range of the keyboard to
express the delicate "birdsongs"
and crashing dissonant chords.
Yvonne Loriod performed
flawlessly a part that must be
perfectly in rhythm and that is
physically exuberant. *
Jeanne Loriod is the world's
most accomplished musician on
the rather curious
Ondes-Martenot. An early
electronic instrument, its sounds
resemble an eerie slithering
glissando, an electric violin or a
classy kazoo. At the miniature
"keyboard" of the
Ondes-Martenot, Jeanne Loriod
played with a precise and
expressive tone that illustrated the
distinctive and unusual
capabilities of the instrument.
Because the piece portrays
such a range of emotion, from a
heavy, rhythmical strength to a
melodic, delicate sensuality, the
other instruments were no less
noteworthy. Messiaen highlights
nearly every instrumental section
in this piece, and the orchestra
obviously understood and
appreciated the work. Particularly
good were the strings and
percussion in setting the ranges of
mood, and the horns in the
"Finale," which helped to end the
piece in a magnificent fortissimo
that is Messiaen's brilliant
pronouncement of love.
If a piece of music is judged on
the intensity of the emotional
response it evokes from the
audience, then this is
unquestionably a great work.
Messiaen can look forward to a
greater, much deserved notoriety.
