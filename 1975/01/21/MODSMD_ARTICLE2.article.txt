# Taxis' Role In Transit System Unclear

Santa Clara County's new
Dial-A-Ride system may complement
taxi cabs, but it can never replace
them, said Sandy Sanger, a cab
company president who will soon
become a consultant to dial-a-ride
systems.
"It is inconceivable to me that in
Santa Clara County California, with
1.2 million people, that you couldn't
get a taxicab," he said.
Sanger is president of Cabs
Unlimited, Inc., one of eight privately
owned cab companies slated for
county purchase later this year.
"Dial-a-ride is a mode that with the
proper vehicles and energy source, and
proper communicatiohs, can be a
useful mode to the public," Sanger
said. "However, it can never be
profitable."

"If it is run in conjunction with a
regulated cab company it will be run
much more efficiently and for much
less cost," he said, adding the county's
Dial-A-Ride was "a tremendous Utopian
situation, but unrealistic."
Sanger siad he was unsure about
just what the county intended to do
with the cab systems after it bought
them. "They may conceivably run taxi
cabs per se, or they may take their
propane-powered buses and put them
on arterial routes ... this is something
only the county could say," he
explained.
But 170,000 taxis carried 3.8
million passengers in the U.S. last year,
Sanger said, which means they're still a
popular form of transportation. "I
have never been anyplace you couldn't
get a taxi cab ... we would be unique
if we had no taxis," he said.

Sanger indicated that some of
Dial-A-Ride's problems stem from its
impersonal computer dispatching
system. "The purchase of
transportation for hire is an emotional
thing," he said. "There are computer
freaks who have devised this thing.
This is something that's very
repugnant to the public."
County officials handling the cab
purchase say it will take several
months. When it finally happens
"we're finished," Sanger said of
himself and other managerial and
supervisory employees in the
companies.
"It's possible that some of the
management may go to the county,"
Sanger agreed, but he doesn't plan to.
"I have other business interests."
Sanger said hiring will be up to the
county's board of supervisors.
