Arab Hijackers Give Up In Iraq
PARIS Three Arab terrorists who flew a
French jetliner around the Mideast for hours in a
fruitless search for sanctuary landed at Baghdad
early today and surrendered to Iraqi authorities, an
Air France spokesman in Paris reported.
The Air France Boeing 707 with a volunteer crew
of three had been placed at the disposal of the
terrorists yesterday when they agreed to release 10
hostages held overnight after a bloody gunfight in
Paris' Orly Airport terminal. The Air France
spokesman said the crew was not harmed.
Arab governments in Kuwait, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and Lebanon refused to let the terrorists
land in their countries, the Air France spokesman
said, and the big jet criss-crossed the Middle East
with fuel running low.
The jet made a landing yesterday afternoon in
Baghdad, took on enough fuel for eight flying
hours, and then was ordered to leave. The Iraqi
news agency said it was permitted to land only
because the pilot used a ruse, saying the plane was
"a French cargo plane headed for Kuwait and that it
had to land in Baghdad to continue its journey."
Chou En-lai Forecasts World War
TOKYO Chinese Premier Chou En-lai, in a
major policy speech made public on Peking radio
last night, declared that U.S.-Soviet rivalry "is
bound to lead to world war some day."
In the address to the fourth National People's
Congress Jan. 13, Chou also declared that China
aims to become a world economic power before the
end of the century.

"The two superpowers, the United States and the
Soviet Union, are the biggest international
oppressors and exploiters today, and they are the
source of a new world war," Chou said in the speech
reported by the Chinese news agency Hsinhua.
"Their fierce contention is bound to lead to
world war some day. The people of all countries
must get prepared," Chou said in his report to the
congress China's first in 10 years.
He said relations with the United States had
"improved to some extent" while the dispute with
the Soviet Union had worsened.
Demos Vote To Check CIA, FBI
WASHINGTON Democratic senators voted
45-7 yesterday to create a bipartisan special
committee to investigate the entire U.S. intelligence
establishment, including the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

The Senate's Democratic caucus placed no
restrictions on the selection of panel members, a
move that represents a sharp defeat for the small
cluster of senior senators who traditionally have
overseen CIA activities.
Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield said he
would be very flexible in naming Democrats to serve
on the Watergate-type committee and that some
young senators will be named.
Mansfield said he will confer soon with Senate
Republican leader Hugh Scott, who would name the
GOP members. The resolution calls for a committee
of either seven or 11 senators with the decision on
size left to Mansfield and Scott.
Convoy To Supply Phnom Penh?
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia A 12-ship resupply
convoy was forming on the Mekong River near the
South Vietnamese border yesterday and shipping
sources said it might attempt a 60-mile night run to
isolated Phnom Penh.
Communist-led forces control 45 miles of the
river and a resupply convoy with much-needed
food, fuel and ammunition has not arrived in
Phnom Penh since Dec. 24.
Meanwhile, Viet Cong terrorists blew up a bridge
on a secondary road six miles southeast of Saigon
and a larger bridge 95 miles southeast of the South
Vietnamese capital on the main highway from the
Mekong Delta. Traffic was suspended on the
secondary road near the city but continued over a
parallel bridge on the other route.
U.S. Seeks Use Of Strategic Base
LONDON The United States is seeking
occasional use of airfield facilities on Masirah Island,
a British-run air base commanding the entrance of
the Persian Gulf, and Britain is considering the
request, the Foreign Office said yesterday.
Masirah belongs to Sultan Qabous of Oman. It
lies within 400 miles of the Hormuz Strait, the
25-mile bottleneck entrance to the Gulf.

Qualified informants reported that U.S. Air
Force traffic around the Gulf area and to the Indian
Ocean has been increasing steadily lately and is
likely to go on mounting.
The request for use of the airfield was confirmed
in Washington by Maj. Gen. Winant Sidle, a
Pentagon spokesman, who stressed that the United
States is not seeking a full-fledged base.
GM Jumps On Rebate Bandwagon
DETROIT General Motors has announced a
program of rebates of up to, $5OO to buyers of
specified models of the firm's small cars. The

rebates, retroactive from Jan. 13, will extend to
Feb. 28.

GM became the last of the Big Three'auto makers
to announce the rebate policy. Chrysler and Ford
announced similar programs earlier this month in an
attempt to clear out huge stocks of cars.
GM said yesterday that rebates of $2OO will be
paid to buyers of Chevrolet Vega and Nova, Pontiac
Astre and Ventura, Oldesmobile Omega and Buick
Apollo and Skylark models.
Buyers of Chevrolet Monza 2 plus 2, Oldsmobile
Starfire and Buick Skyhawk will get $5OO, GM said.
On Jan. 12, Chrysler became the first auto maker
to announce a rebate program. Ford's
announcement came four days later.
FBI To Turn Over Secret Files
WASHINGTON The FBI agreed yesterday to
provide Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence H. Silberman
with all the material the agency has compiled on at
least 10 members of Congress, a Justice Department
spokesman said.
Silberman "asked the FBI to turn over all
material on the congressmen mentioned" in a
Washington Post report describing the FBI practice
of maintaining files on members of Congress, said
Robert Havel, the department's public information
director.
The FBI agreed to Silberman's request, Havel
said.
Meanwhile, two former FBI officials confirmed
in interviews that the agency routinely collected and
filed information about members of Congress. But
both said the data usually was gathered as part of
other investigations, rather than a specific effort to
amass files on congressmen.
Albert: Tax Rebate Favors Rich'
WASHINGTON President Ford's proposal to
rebate some of 1974 income taxes would put 43
percent of the refund into the hands of the richest
17 percent of taxpayers, House Speaker Carl Albert
said last night. <
"The Democratic leadership has asked the House
to pass a substantial tax reduction bill for middle
and lower income persons only by the end of
March," Albert said in a broadcast reply to the
speech in which Ford detailed his economic
proposals a week ago.

WASHINGTON The FBI agreed yesterday to
provide Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence H. Silberman
with all the material the agency has compiled on at
least 10 members of Congress, a Justice Department
spokesman said.
Silberman "asked the FBI to turn over all
material on the congressmen mentioned" in a
Washington Post report describing the FBI practice
of maintaining files on members of Congress, said
Robert Havel, the department's public information
director.
The FBI agreed to Silberman's request, Havel
said.
Meanwhile, two former FBI officials confirmed
in interviews that the agency routinely collected and
filed information about members of Congress. But
both said the data usually was gathered as part of
other investigations, rather than a specific effort to
amass files on congressmen.
Albert: Tax Rebate Favors Rich'
WASHINGTON President Ford's proposal to
rebate some of 1974 income taxes would put 43
percent of the refund into the hands of the richest
17 percent of taxpayers, House Speaker Carl Albert
said last night. <
"The Democratic leadership has asked the House
to pass a substantial tax reduction bill for middle
and lower income persons only by the end of
March," Albert said in a broadcast reply to the
speech in which Ford detailed his economic
proposals a week ago.
Today's Weather

Arab Hijackers Give Up In Iraq
PARIS Three Arab terrorists who flew a
French jetliner around the Mideast for hours in a
fruitless search for sanctuary landed at Baghdad
early today and surrendered to Iraqi authorities, an
Air France spokesman in Paris reported.
The Air France Boeing 707 with a volunteer crew
of three had been placed at the disposal of the
terrorists yesterday when they agreed to release 10
hostages held overnight after a bloody gunfight in
Paris' Orly Airport terminal. The Air France
spokesman said the crew was not harmed.
Arab governments in Kuwait, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and Lebanon refused to let the terrorists
land in their countries, the Air France spokesman
said, and the big jet criss-crossed the Middle East
with fuel running low.
The jet made a landing yesterday afternoon in
Baghdad, took on enough fuel for eight flying
hours, and then was ordered to leave. The Iraqi
news agency said it was permitted to land only
because the pilot used a ruse, saying the plane was
"a French cargo plane headed for Kuwait and that it
had to land in Baghdad to continue its journey."
Chou En-lai Forecasts World War
TOKYO Chinese Premier Chou En-lai, in a
major policy speech made public on Peking radio
last night, declared that U.S.-Soviet rivalry "is
bound to lead to world war some day."
In the address to the fourth National People's
Congress Jan. 13, Chou also declared that China
aims to become a world economic power before the
end of the century.

"The two superpowers, the United States and the
Soviet Union, are the biggest international
oppressors and exploiters today, and they are the
source of a new world war," Chou said in the speech
reported by the Chinese news agency Hsinhua.
"Their fierce contention is bound to lead to
world war some day. The people of all countries
must get prepared," Chou said in his report to the
congress China's first in 10 years.
He said relations with the United States had
"improved to some extent" while the dispute with
the Soviet Union had worsened.
Demos Vote To Check CIA, FBI
WASHINGTON Democratic senators voted
45-7 yesterday to create a bipartisan special
committee to investigate the entire U.S. intelligence
establishment, including the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

The Senate's Democratic caucus placed no
restrictions on the selection of panel members, a
move that represents a sharp defeat for the small
cluster of senior senators who traditionally have
overseen CIA activities.
Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield said he
would be very flexible in naming Democrats to serve
on the Watergate-type committee and that some
young senators will be named.
Mansfield said he will confer soon with Senate
Republican leader Hugh Scott, who would name the
GOP members. The resolution calls for a committee
of either seven or 11 senators with the decision on
size left to Mansfield and Scott.
Convoy To Supply Phnom Penh?
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia A 12-ship resupply
convoy was forming on the Mekong River near the
South Vietnamese border yesterday and shipping
sources said it might attempt a 60-mile night run to
isolated Phnom Penh.
Communist-led forces control 45 miles of the
river and a resupply convoy with much-needed
food, fuel and ammunition has not arrived in
Phnom Penh since Dec. 24.
Meanwhile, Viet Cong terrorists blew up a bridge
on a secondary road six miles southeast of Saigon
and a larger bridge 95 miles southeast of the South
Vietnamese capital on the main highway from the
Mekong Delta. Traffic was suspended on the
secondary road near the city but continued over a
parallel bridge on the other route.
U.S. Seeks Use Of Strategic Base
LONDON The United States is seeking
occasional use of airfield facilities on Masirah Island,
a British-run air base commanding the entrance of
the Persian Gulf, and Britain is considering the
request, the Foreign Office said yesterday.
Masirah belongs to Sultan Qabous of Oman. It
lies within 400 miles of the Hormuz Strait, the
25-mile bottleneck entrance to the Gulf.

Qualified informants reported that U.S. Air
Force traffic around the Gulf area and to the Indian
Ocean has been increasing steadily lately and is
likely to go on mounting.
The request for use of the airfield was confirmed
in Washington by Maj. Gen. Winant Sidle, a
Pentagon spokesman, who stressed that the United
States is not seeking a full-fledged base.
GM Jumps On Rebate Bandwagon
DETROIT General Motors has announced a
program of rebates of up to, $5OO to buyers of

GM became the last of the Big Three'auto makers
to announce the rebate policy. Chrysler and Ford
announced similar programs earlier this month in an
attempt to clear out huge stocks of cars.
GM said yesterday that rebates of $2OO will be
paid to buyers of Chevrolet Vega and Nova, Pontiac
Astre and Ventura, Oldesmobile Omega and Buick
Apollo and Skylark models.
Buyers of Chevrolet Monza 2 plus 2, Oldsmobile

the Persian Gulf, and Britain is considering the
request, the Foreign Office said yesterday.
Masirah belongs to Sultan Qabous of Oman. It
lies within 400 miles of the Hormuz Strait, the
25-mile bottleneck entrance to the Gulf.

Qualified informants reported that U.S. Air
Force traffic around the Gulf area and to the Indian
Ocean has been increasing steadily lately and is
likely to go on mounting.
The request for use of the airfield was confirmed
in Washington by Maj. Gen. Winant Sidle, a
Pentagon spokesman, who stressed that the United
States is not seeking a full-fledged base.
GM Jumps On Rebate Bandwagon
DETROIT General Motors has announced a
program of rebates of up to, $5OO to buyers of
specified models of the firm's small cars. The

rebates, retroactive from Jan. 13, will extend to
Feb. 28.

GM became the last of the Big Three'auto makers
to announce the rebate policy. Chrysler and Ford
announced similar programs earlier this month in an
attempt to clear out huge stocks of cars.
GM said yesterday that rebates of $2OO will be
paid to buyers of Chevrolet Vega and Nova, Pontiac
Astre and Ventura, Oldesmobile Omega and Buick
Apollo and Skylark models.
Buyers of Chevrolet Monza 2 plus 2, Oldsmobile
Starfire and Buick Skyhawk will get $5OO, GM said.
On Jan. 12, Chrysler became the first auto maker
to announce a rebate program. Ford's
announcement came four days later.
FBI To Turn Over Secret Files
WASHINGTON The FBI agreed yesterday to
provide Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence H. Silberman
with all the material the agency has compiled on at
least 10 members of Congress, a Justice Department
spokesman said.
Silberman "asked the FBI to turn over all
material on the congressmen mentioned" in a
Washington Post report describing the FBI practice
of maintaining files on members of Congress, said
Robert Havel, the department's public information
director.
The FBI agreed to Silberman's request, Havel
said.
Meanwhile, two former FBI officials confirmed
in interviews that the agency routinely collected and
filed information about members of Congress. But
both said the data usually was gathered as part of
other investigations, rather than a specific effort to
amass files on congressmen.
Albert: Tax Rebate Favors Rich'
WASHINGTON President Ford's proposal to
rebate some of 1974 income taxes would put 43
percent of the refund into the hands of the richest
17 percent of taxpayers, House Speaker Carl Albert
said last night. <
"The Democratic leadership has asked the House
to pass a substantial tax reduction bill for middle
and lower income persons only by the end of
March," Albert said in a broadcast reply to the
speech in which Ford detailed his economic
proposals a week ago.

Arab Hijackers Give Up In Iraq
PARIS Three Arab terrorists who flew a
French jetliner around the Mideast for hours in a
fruitless search for sanctuary landed at Baghdad
early today and surrendered to Iraqi authorities, an
Air France spokesman in Paris reported.
The Air France Boeing 707 with a volunteer crew
of three had been placed at the disposal of the
terrorists yesterday when they agreed to release 10
hostages held overnight after a bloody gunfight in
Paris' Orly Airport terminal. The Air France
spokesman said the crew was not harmed.
Arab governments in Kuwait, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and Lebanon refused to let the terrorists
land in their countries, the Air France spokesman
said, and the big jet criss-crossed the Middle East
with fuel running low.
The jet made a landing yesterday afternoon in
Baghdad, took on enough fuel for eight flying
hours, and then was ordered to leave. The Iraqi
news agency said it was permitted to land only
because the pilot used a ruse, saying the plane was
"a French cargo plane headed for Kuwait and that it
had to land in Baghdad to continue its journey."
Chou En-lai Forecasts World War
TOKYO Chinese Premier Chou En-lai, in a
major policy speech made public on Peking radio
last night, declared that U.S.-Soviet rivalry "is
bound to lead to world war some day."
In the address to the fourth National People's
Congress Jan. 13, Chou also declared that China
aims to become a world economic power before the
end of the century.

"The two superpowers, the United States and the
Soviet Union, are the biggest international
oppressors and exploiters today, and they are the
source of a new world war," Chou said in the speech
reported by the Chinese news agency Hsinhua.
"Their fierce contention is bound to lead to
world war some day. The people of all countries
must get prepared," Chou said in his report to the
congress China's first in 10 years.
He said relations with the United States had
"improved to some extent" while the dispute with
the Soviet Union had worsened.
Demos Vote To Check CIA, FBI
WASHINGTON Democratic senators voted
45-7 yesterday to create a bipartisan special
committee to investigate the entire U.S. intelligence
establishment, including the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

The Senate's Democratic caucus placed no
restrictions on the selection of panel members, a
move that represents a sharp defeat for the small
cluster of senior senators who traditionally have
overseen CIA activities.
Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield said he
would be very flexible in naming Democrats to serve
on the Watergate-type committee and that some
young senators will be named.
Mansfield said he will confer soon with Senate
Republican leader Hugh Scott, who would name the
GOP members. The resolution calls for a committee
of either seven or 11 senators with the decision on
size left to Mansfield and Scott.
Convoy To Supply Phnom Penh?
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia A 12-ship resupply
convoy was forming on the Mekong River near the
South Vietnamese border yesterday and shipping
sources said it might attempt a 60-mile night run to
isolated Phnom Penh.
Communist-led forces control 45 miles of the
river and a resupply convoy with much-needed
food, fuel and ammunition has not arrived in
Phnom Penh since Dec. 24.
Meanwhile, Viet Cong terrorists blew up a bridge
on a secondary road six miles southeast of Saigon
and a larger bridge 95 miles southeast of the South
Vietnamese capital on the main highway from the
Mekong Delta. Traffic was suspended on the
secondary road near the city but continued over a
parallel bridge on the other route.
