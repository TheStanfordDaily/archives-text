# ASSU 'Making Lots Of Bucks'
## 
### DON COX 
Though the University may be in
the throes of a budget crisis, the ASSU
has finally climbed out of the financial
hole in which it has long languished,
according to Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri.
"We're making lots of bucks,"
Olivieri said as he outlined record
high-level operating profits for autumn
quarter.
In addition to the record profits
garnered by ASSU projects, the ASSU
also realized high rates of return on its
investments. The returns were so high,
in fact, that the ASSU assumed
control of an ASSU "endowment"
fund previously managed by the
University.
"The University got only a seven
percent rate of return on the invested
endowment funds. Why, you can do as
well as that by putting the money in a
Wells Fargo bank savings account,"
said Olivieri. He said he did not know

why the University has done such a
"poor" job managing the endowment
funds.
Short-Term Certificates
In September, Olivieri pried the
$115,000 endowment loose from the
University and immediately invested it
in short-term certificates of deposits
with an interest rate of 11.75 percent.
"We should be able to get a higher
than average rate of return," he said.
University Director of Finance
Rodney Adams said that while higher
yields might well have been possible in
the high-interest-rate times of the past,
the rate of return will be better in the
long run if the funds are part' of a
diversified pool.
When the ASSU funds were under
University management, they were
pooled with other University funds.
By having a large, diversified pool to
invest, Adams said he could take
advantage of high-yield investment
opportunities at much lower risk.
Future Savvy
Adams noted that having the funds
under ASSU management was fine as
long as the financial manager was
competent. "Olivieri feels future
financial managers will be as savvy as
he is. But if they aren't, the ASSU will
suffer financial reversals, and we worry
about that.
"It's a worthwhile educational
endeavor to have someone manage it,
but you have to make sure of the risks
you take with different forms of
investment," Adams continued. For
this reason, Adams has spelled out a
list of authorized investments that
Olivieri can make.
Adams noted that the funds have
been managed by ASSU in the past
and that there has been a lack of
consistency with regard to the
management of funds.
The funds turned over to the ASSU
by the University constitute just one
part of a sum of almost $1 million
invested last quarter generating

interest income for the ASSU. Olivieri
noted that the ASSU didn't actually
have a million dollars on hand to
invest at once, but that this sum
represented all of the short-term
investments made.
Most of the ASSU projects have
large amoujnts of cash on hand that
will not be spent immediately that are
invested to produce income. ASSU
Special Events has reserves of about
$50,000, the Sunday Flicks $lO,OOO
and the Travel Service about $35,000.
These reserves are used for short-term
investments.
The investments are usually for
periods of about three months, with
interest rates ranging from 7.5 to
11.75 percent. Using this method of
short-term investments, the ASSU
made about $23,000 last quarter.

Most of the ASSU projects have
large amoujnts of cash on hand that
will not be spent immediately that are
invested to produce income. ASSU
Special Events has reserves of about
$50,000, the Sunday Flicks $lO,OOO
and the Travel Service about $35,000.
These reserves are used for short-term
investments.
The investments are usually for
periods of about three months, with
interest rates ranging from 7.5 to
11.75 percent. Using this method of
short-term investments, the ASSU
made about $23,000 last quarter.

HERMAN PROPOSAL—ASSU President Mike Herman yesterday revealed his
new, improved version of the "Stanford-in-Stanford" plan for a residential
college.
Though the University may be in
the throes of a budget crisis, the ASSU
has finally climbed out of the financial
hole in which it has long languished,
according to Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri.
"We're making lots of bucks,"
Olivieri said as he outlined record
high-level operating profits for autumn
quarter.
In addition to the record profits
garnered by ASSU projects, the ASSU
also realized high rates of return on its
investments. The returns were so high,
in fact, that the ASSU assumed
control of an ASSU "endowment"
fund previously managed by the
University.
"The University got only a seven
percent rate of return on the invested
endowment funds. Why, you can do as
well as that by putting the money in a
Wells Fargo bank savings account,"
said Olivieri. He said he did not know

why the University has done such a
"poor" job managing the endowment
funds.
Short-Term Certificates
In September, Olivieri pried the
$115,000 endowment loose from the
University and immediately invested it
in short-term certificates of deposits
with an interest rate of 11.75 percent.
"We should be able to get a higher
than average rate of return," he said.
University Director of Finance
Rodney Adams said that while higher
yields might well have been possible in
the high-interest-rate times of the past,
the rate of return will be better in the
long run if the funds are part' of a
diversified pool.
When the ASSU funds were under
University management, they were
pooled with other University funds.
By having a large, diversified pool to
invest, Adams said he could take
advantage of high-yield investment
opportunities at much lower risk.
Future Savvy
Adams noted that having the funds
under ASSU management was fine as
long as the financial manager was
competent. "Olivieri feels future
financial managers will be as savvy as
he is. But if they aren't, the ASSU will
suffer financial reversals, and we worry
about that.
"It's a worthwhile educational
endeavor to have someone manage it,
but you have to make sure of the risks
you take with different forms of
investment," Adams continued. For
this reason, Adams has spelled out a
list of authorized investments that
Olivieri can make.
Adams noted that the funds have
been managed by ASSU in the past
and that there has been a lack of
consistency with regard to the
management of funds.
The funds turned over to the ASSU
by the University constitute just one
part of a sum of almost $1 million
invested last quarter generating

interest income for the ASSU. Olivieri
noted that the ASSU didn't actually
have a million dollars on hand to
invest at once, but that this sum
represented all of the short-term
investments made.

large amoujnts of cash on hand that
will not be spent immediately that are
