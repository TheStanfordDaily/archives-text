# Plans Revised For Residential College
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
ASSU President Mike Herman and
Tom Glenn, a graduate student in
anthropology, yesterday presented
revised plans for a "Stanford-in-
Stanford" residential college program
focusing on Arms Control and
Disarmament.
The new program, slated to begin in
September 1975, would allow
interested students the opportunity
for intensive study of arms control,
yet would not isolate them from the
University community by prohibiting
them from taking any regular classes,
the two authors said. As of now, no
limit has been set on the number of
participants.
A Herman and Glenn outlined the
new program in a taped press
conference at KZSU radio.
Explaining their reasons for
choosing arms control as a suitable
topic, Herman said that the basic
program already exists, it is an
interdisciplinary subject that involves
several fields, and the faculty members
involved have shown great enthusiasm.

If sufficient student interest is
shown and the program meets the
approval of the advisory panel on the
residence configuration and the Office
of Residential Education, an
appropriate residence will be selected,
Herman said. A final decision on the
program is expected later this quarter.
Funded through the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies with assistance
from the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences and the Office of Residential
Education, a $7500 "restricted gift"
will provide necessary monies. No cuts
in existing programs need be made to
accommodate the new proposal.
Law Prof. John Barton will direct
the program and Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler will act as
co-ordinator, Herman said.
Weiler plans to schedule 10 office
hours per week in the residence during
autumn and winter quarters, Herman
said. During spring quarter Barton will
schedule four to five hours per week in
the residence, he added.
List
The curriculum consists of three
courses required for all students in the
program and two other related courses
to be chosen from a list drawn up by
the program director. Other than these
commitments, each student is free to
take any other University course
offering, Herman said.
Classes will be open to the entire
student body, he said.
In autumn quarter, participants will
take Political Science 135, "How
Nations Deal With Each Other."
Although the lectures will be presented
in the Quad, special discussion
sections will meet in the residence. In
winter quarter, the residential college
participants will enroll in Political
Science 138A, "Arms Control and
Disarmament." Again, special
residence sections will meet.
Culmination
As the culmination pf the program,
spring quarter will consist of a
simulated arms control negotiation. It
will be offered in the residence.
Students participating in the
program who already have taken one
of the required courses must choose a
substitute course in consultation with
the director.

Culminating some three months of
"close negotiations with all those
concerned," the present proposal is
the end result of a plan first proposed
by Herman and Glenn last September.
Two meetings will be held next
week for those interested in

"Stanford-in-Stanford," and Barton,
Weiler, Horton, Glenn and Herman
will answer any questions.
Students will be asked to sign a
statement committing themselves to
the program. They will be cut off from
the draw and forced to forfeit their
$5O housing deposit if they drop out,
Herman said.
The first meeting will be held next
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. in Tresidder
Small Lounge.

Education, a $7500 "restricted gift"
will provide necessary monies. No cuts
in existing programs need be made to
accommodate the new proposal.
Law Prof. John Barton will direct
the program and Political Science Prof.
Lawrence Weiler will act as
co-ordinator, Herman said.
Weiler plans to schedule 10 office
hours per week in the residence during
autumn and winter quarters, Herman
said. During spring quarter Barton will
schedule four to five hours per week in
the residence, he added.
List
The curriculum consists of three
courses required for all students in the
program and two other related courses
to be chosen from a list drawn up by
the program director. Other than these
commitments, each student is free to
take any other University course
offering, Herman said.
Classes will be open to the entire
student body, he said.
In autumn quarter, participants will
take Political Science 135, "How
Nations Deal With Each Other."
Although the lectures will be presented
in the Quad, special discussion
sections will meet in the residence. In
winter quarter, the residential college
participants will enroll in Political
Science 138A, "Arms Control and
Disarmament." Again, special
residence sections will meet.
Culmination
As the culmination pf the program,
spring quarter will consist of a
simulated arms control negotiation. It
will be offered in the residence.
Students participating in the
program who already have taken one
of the required courses must choose a
substitute course in consultation with
the director.

Culminating some three months of
"close negotiations with all those
concerned," the present proposal is
the end result of a plan first proposed
by Herman and Glenn last September.
Two meetings will be held next
week for those interested in

"Stanford-in-Stanford," and Barton,
Weiler, Horton, Glenn and Herman
will answer any questions.
Students will be asked to sign a
statement committing themselves to
the program. They will be cut off from
the draw and forced to forfeit their
$5O housing deposit if they drop out,
Herman said.
The first meeting will be held next
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. in Tresidder
Small Lounge.
ASSU President Mike Herman and
Tom Glenn, a graduate student in
anthropology, yesterday presented
revised plans for a "Stanford-in-
Stanford" residential college program
focusing on Arms Control and
Disarmament.
The new program, slated to begin in
September 1975, would allow
interested students the opportunity
for intensive study of arms control,
yet would not isolate them from the
University community by prohibiting
them from taking any regular classes,
the two authors said. As of now, no
limit has been set on the number of
participants.
A Herman and Glenn outlined the
new program in a taped press
conference at KZSU radio.
Explaining their reasons for
choosing arms control as a suitable
topic, Herman said that the basic
program already exists, it is an
interdisciplinary subject that involves
several fields, and the faculty members
involved have shown great enthusiasm.

If sufficient student interest is
shown and the program meets the
approval of the advisory panel on the
residence configuration and the Office
of Residential Education, an
appropriate residence will be selected,
Herman said. A final decision on the
program is expected later this quarter.
Funded through the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies with assistance
from the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences and the Office of Residential
Education, a $7500 "restricted gift"
will provide necessary monies. No cuts
in existing programs need be made to
accommodate the new proposal.
