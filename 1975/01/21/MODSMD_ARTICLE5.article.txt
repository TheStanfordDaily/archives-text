# Survey Investigates Unwanted Pregnancies
## 
### AARON WEINER 
Few women want to get pregnant
while they're still single, but the
growing lines at abortion clinics
around the country are ample evidence
that it still happens.
Why?
A recent study headed by
Psychiatry Prof. Warren Miller shows
several psychological and behavioral
factors play an integral role in the case
of an unwanted pregnancy.
The study, which appears in the
January issue of the "Western Journal
of Medicine," was performed
survey-style, with 642 Stanford
Hospital abortion patients responding
to a questionnaire and private
interviews. The questionnaire
consisted of 53 psychological

circumstances that might have played
a role in the occurrence of unwanted
pregnancy.
Several Factors
Most women checked off more
than one item, proving that several
influences were usually present. The
most popular response on the
questionnaire was: "I thought it was
during the safe period" and was
marked by 35 percent. The second
most frequently checked item (33
percent) was contraceptive failure.
Third (29 percent) was fear of
contraceptive side effects.
Other common responses implied
conscious and sub-conscious blocking
out of the possible consequences;
women often subconsciously rely on
the probability of not getting pregnant
to occur in their favor, the survey
showed.

All of the respondents were asked
what method of contraception they
used at or around the time of
conception: 54 percent indicated that
they had used nothing and the
remainder indicated that they had
used rhythm (14 percent), foam (nine
percent), withdrawal (five percent),
oral contraception (five percent),
diaphragm (five percent), intrauterine
contraceptive device (three percent)
or some other method (two percent).
Planning
The study noted that while
premarital intercourse is generally
spontaneous, contraception requires a
rational and planned approach:
making a decision to engage in sexual
activity, deciding to obtain a
contraceptives and then using them
regularly.
Miller said that since abortion laws
in California were liberalized in 1967,
social and psychological pressures
upon the abortion recipient have eased
greatly. The psychological liberation
of contraceptive use lags behind
because of the social stereotypes
which are related most often by
peer groups to a contraceptive user,
Miller said.
Miller said if doctors and educators
pay considerably more attention to
individualized psychological factors,
the frequency of unwanted pregnancy
might be considerably reduced. "I
don't advocate premarital sex," he said,
"but with gradually changing norms,
we're moving toward greater freedom
of choice: whether or not a woman
wants to get pregnant.'^'
