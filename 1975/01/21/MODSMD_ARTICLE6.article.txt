# Franklin Autobiography Calls Stanford 'Repressive'
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Former Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin has written a political
autobiography which Harper's Magazine
Press will release in April.
In a Daily interview last week, Franklin
noted that the book, Back Where You Came
From, will also include a critical history of
the University.
Franklin, currently a visiting instructor at
Wesley an University, also revealed that he is
teaching a course at Yale this semester as a
visiting assistant professor.
Dismissed from Stanford in 1972 for
allegedly inciting students to violence,
Franklin was unemployed until last autumn
when he received the appointment at
Wesley an.

According to Franklin, his book will
"reveal the University for what it really is
the center of the Pacific Empire's
military-industrial complex."
Repressive Education

Franklin said that the book will start with
"the first spade of dirt turned over by
Leland Stanford in the [lBB7]
ground-breaking ceremony" and go on to
tell of the "repression that always has
characterized education at Stanford."
The main part of the book will relate
Franklin's political development into a
professed Marxist-Leninist and present his
opinion of why the United States needs to
undergo revolutionary changes in its political
and economic structure.

Franklin emphasized that his book will
also relate in detail the controversial
hearings that led to his dismissal here.
"Back Where You Came From shows how
the Stanford Administration framed me
because it couldn't stand to hear what I had
to say," he elaborated.
Book's Title
Franklin explained that he chose the
book's title when he recalled that his
opponents at Stanford used to ask, "Why
don't you go back where you came from?"
Franklin predicted that the book will
damage Stanford's reputation as an eminent
university.
"When I tell people at Wesleyan and Yale
about my experiences at Stanford, they are
appalled," Franklin exclaimed. "They can
hardly believe that a school like Stanford
would fire a tenured professor merely
because he criticized the American invasion
of Indochina."
Franklin said that "many bright
undergraduates " at Wesleyan and Yale who
had planned to take their graduate study at
Stanford decided not even to apply after
hearing about his dismissal.
Ties To 'Big Business'
Also, his discussions about Stanford's ties
to "big business" deterred students from
annlving to the University, Franklin
said.
A spokesman for Harper's Magazine Press
agreed with Franklin that the book is
unfavorable toward the University.

When asked whether the book is biased,
the source, who refused to be named, stated
that "it depends upon how one looks at it.
We think that it is accurate, but we don't
expect people at Stanford to like it."
Advance Copies
Although the book will not reach
bookstores until April, advance copies
should be available late this winter,
according to an official at the publisher's
office.
In the same interview, Franklin said
he is enjoying his stay in Connecticut and is
hopeful of receiving a permanent
appointment at one of the many schools to
which he is applying.
Although Franklin originally was hired to
work only autumn semester at Wesleyan, he
was later asked to remain for the spring.
Franklin, a noted Melville scholar, said he
is teaching courses in science fiction at
Wesleyan and Yale.
"When I first taught science fiction
courses at Stanford in 1961, the subject was
considered bizarre," Franklin said. "But by
1968, science fiction was recognized as
worthwhile literature and competent
instructors in it are much in demand."
Franklin said he has encountered no
hostility at Wesleyan and Yale because of his
political views.
"The tolerance with which I have been
received [at Yale and Wesleyan] shows again
how repressive the atmosphere is at
Stanford."
