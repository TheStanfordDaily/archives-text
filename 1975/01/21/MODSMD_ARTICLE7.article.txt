Thank You

Rarely does the Daily deal with basketball in an editorial.
And until recently, it was probably just as well. Stanford's
fortunes in that area have generally been painful, to say the
least.
But after the Maples Madness of last weekend, it's time
for us to say a word, or two words, to Howie Dallmar and
the Cardinal basketball team. The words are "thank you."
Like nearly everyone on campus, we're quick to criticize
and complain when things aren't going right, and it seems
like they haven't been going right for a long time now.
But the miraculous, marvelous defeats of Southern Cal
and UCLA more than make up for it. Not many schools can
boast of back-to-back defeats of the second and fifth ranked
teams in the country.
And we're happy to be one of the few.
Likewise, Stanford fans deserve a vote of congratulations.
For people that had little to cheer about for so long, they
conducted themselves with real class over the weekend.
They let the team know where they stood from the opening
tip, and even when it seemed that the Los Angeles teams
were going to somehow extend the curse, the fans hung in
there.
So thank you: to the fans who showed their class and
to the team that made it possible.
