# Amnesty: A Farce
## 
### Halliday, Mickelson 
On Sept. 16, amid talk of
binding the nation's wounds,
President Ford announced his
plan for allowing some 50,000
Vietnam era draft resisters and
military absentees to "earn"
re-entry by performing up to 24
months of alternative service.
Basically, the Ford program
Constitutes little more than
■ continued punishment for war
resisters.
Of slightly Tewer than 200,000
cases of draft resistance reported
to the Justice Department, less
than 20,000 resulted in
prosecution. Past experience has
shown that only 20 percent of
those prosecuted have been
! convicted. Thus, the estimated
of conviction outside the
Ford plan is two percent.
However, draft resisters who
agree to the Ford program are
required to perform the
alternative service whether or not
they were facing prosecution.
Similarly, several military
installations around the country
continue to give discharges to
military absentees by a relatively
simple administrative procedure.
This process takes two weeks and
results in an undesirable discharge
but none of the other
complications of the "earned
re-entry" program.
In contrast, military absentees
who participate in the Ford plan,
after completing up to 24 months
of alternative service, receive a
clemency discharge, which denies
them all veterans' benefits (an
undesirable discharge does not)
and readily identifies them as a
"deserter."

The advantages of submitting
to the program for convicted draft
resisters and military absentees are
even less obvious. Any executive
clemency which the Presidential
Clemency Board might
recommend, contingent on
completion of up to two years of
alternative service, may neither
expunge their criminal record nor
remove federal or state
disabilities.
Finally, 588,000 veterans
received stigmatizing
less-than-honorable discharges in
the Vietnam era. Only the 40,000
charged solely with going AWOL
qualify for the program. For
example, refusal of a direct order
e.g., to go to Vietnam or to
murder civilian Vietnamese is

not one of the "crimes" covered
by the Ford plan.
The "earned re-entry" program
does not claim to be an amnesty.
Offenses covered by an amnesty
are not forgiven, but forgotten.
Thus amnesty differs from pardon,
which implies guilt. The Ford
program is in fact an elaborate
scheme of conditional pardon.
Therefore it is not surprising that
the program should include an
"acknowledgement of obligation"
and a "reaffirmation of loyalty."
The oath provision assumes
that those who resisted the
Indochina War were being
disloyal, while many resisters
regard their actions as indicating a
higher loyalty both to the U.S.
and to humanity.

The alternative service
provisions require war resisters,
whose lives have already been
disrupted, to suffer further
interruptions to plans and
commitments.

Inevitably, too, any system of
case-by-case review discriminates
against the poor, the minorities
and the inarticulate.
The Selective Service System
demonstrates conclusively that
any patchwork program benefits
with the financial means to hire
lawyers to figure out its
loopholes.
The amnesty issue raises
uncomfortable questions about
America's involvement in
Indochina which might lead to
calls for major policy changes. A
successful "earned re-entry"
program would help to stifle a full
discussion of amnesty.
It is clear that the "earned
re-entry" program excludes many,
insults most and ignores the very
issues it purports to resolve. As
shown, the legal options are
generally better outside the
program than within it. The
serious possibility exists that the
American people may be misled
into believing that the "earned
re-entry" program was a humane
and generous act that has ended
the victimization of those who
resisted the catastropic war in
Southeast Asia. For that reason
alone, the program deserves to
fail.

On Sept. 16, amid talk of
binding the nation's wounds,
President Ford announced his
plan for allowing some 50,000
Vietnam era draft resisters and
military absentees to "earn"
re-entry by performing up to 24
months of alternative service.
Basically, the Ford program
Constitutes little more than
■ continued punishment for war
resisters.
Of slightly Tewer than 200,000
cases of draft resistance reported
to the Justice Department, less
than 20,000 resulted in
prosecution. Past experience has
shown that only 20 percent of
those prosecuted have been
! convicted. Thus, the estimated
of conviction outside the
Ford plan is two percent.
However, draft resisters who
agree to the Ford program are
required to perform the
alternative service whether or not
they were facing prosecution.
Similarly, several military
installations around the country
continue to give discharges to
military absentees by a relatively
simple administrative procedure.
This process takes two weeks and
results in an undesirable discharge
but none of the other
complications of the "earned
re-entry" program.
In contrast, military absentees
who participate in the Ford plan,
after completing up to 24 months
of alternative service, receive a
clemency discharge, which denies
them all veterans' benefits (an
undesirable discharge does not)
and readily identifies them as a
"deserter."

The advantages of submitting
to the program for convicted draft
resisters and military absentees are
even less obvious. Any executive
clemency which the Presidential
Clemency Board might
recommend, contingent on
completion of up to two years of
alternative service, may neither
expunge their criminal record nor
remove federal or state
disabilities.
Finally, 588,000 veterans
received stigmatizing
less-than-honorable discharges in
the Vietnam era. Only the 40,000
charged solely with going AWOL
qualify for the program. For
example, refusal of a direct order
e.g., to go to Vietnam or to
murder civilian Vietnamese is

not one of the "crimes" covered
by the Ford plan.
The "earned re-entry" program
does not claim to be an amnesty.
Offenses covered by an amnesty
are not forgiven, but forgotten.
Thus amnesty differs from pardon,
which implies guilt. The Ford
program is in fact an elaborate
scheme of conditional pardon.
Therefore it is not surprising that
the program should include an
"acknowledgement of obligation"
and a "reaffirmation of loyalty."
The oath provision assumes
that those who resisted the
Indochina War were being
disloyal, while many resisters
regard their actions as indicating a
higher loyalty both to the U.S.
and to humanity.

The alternative service
provisions require war resisters,
whose lives have already been
disrupted, to suffer further
interruptions to plans and
commitments.

Inevitably, too, any system of
case-by-case review discriminates
against the poor, the minorities
and the inarticulate.
