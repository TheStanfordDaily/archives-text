# State Dept. Halts Three Speakers

### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Three neutralist ex-prisoners of the
Saigon regime were prevented from
giving a talk in Tresidder last night,
because their visas bave not yet been
approved by the State Department,
David and Jane Barton explained in a
substitute presentation.
The Bartons, who work with the
American Friends Service Committee
(AFSC), helped arrange the prisoners'
visit to the Bay Area.
The former prisoners, a lawyer and
two students, are still in Canada,
where they have been on a speaking
tour for several weeks, David said. Last
night was to be their first appearance
in this country.
Jane said that the men applied for
their visas two weeks ago through the
Canadian embassy, and they were told
by the State Department that their
visas would be approved. They did not
realize until yesterday that the United
States would not let them into the
country, she explained.
Arrest
The lawyer, Nguyen Long, was
arrested for defending a political
prisoner in Vietnam, according to the
Bartons. He was adopted as a
"prisoner of Conscience" by Amnesty
International, which ultimately led to
his release by the Saigon government.
The students, Ton That Lap and Vo
Nhu Lanh were released by the Saigon
regime to the Provisional
Revolutionary Government (PRG) in
1973, the Bartons said. They declared
themselves neutral and asked the PRG
to send them to France, explained
Jane. They have been in France until
this speaking tour.
All three former prisoners have
been scheduled to appear in
Washington this weekend for a Peace
Convocation to Save the Peace
Agreements. David explained that this
assembly was called partly as a
religious effort to impress on the new
Congress that Vietnam is in violation
of the agreement.
Delay
He said that the U.S. has not really
denied the men entry into the
country, but the government is
delaying their visit, "which is really a
good strategy for them."
"I guess the government has
realized that it does not want former
political prisoners in the country on
the second anniversary of the peace
agreement," Jane speculated.
The Bartons said that they have
contacted the office of Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.), asking for help in
getting the ex-prisoners into this
