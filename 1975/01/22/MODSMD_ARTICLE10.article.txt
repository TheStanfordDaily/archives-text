# Second Thoughts On Franklin Case?
## 
### William Ross 
Like the bad penny, former Stanford
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin just won't go
away.
Ever since the University fired Franklin,
he has periodically popped up in the news by
filing lawsuits, applying imaginative epithets
to Stanford administrators, blasting the
Trustees and hatching new conspiracy
theories.

Franklin was fired despite his tenure
in 1972 after a long and controversial
investigation showed that he had incited
students to violence during anti-war
demonstrations early in 1972.
For the first two years after his dismissal,
Franklin, an avowed Marxist-Leninist, sulked
in the Bay Area, initiating a (thus far)
unsuccessful lawsuit against the Univesersity.
Franklin claimed that the University received
so much federal money that it was, in fact, a
public institution and therefore should have
referred his case to a civil court.

Franklin at first failed to receive any
teaching position. In the days following the
often violent student protests of the late
1960s and early 19705, no university wanted
to add a professor to its faculty who was so
radical that a liberal university took the well
nigh unprecedented step of firing him.
But as schools throughout the nation
lapsed into political apathy or at least
abandoned the more explosive forms of
protest many colleges began to lose their
fear of professors who held highly
unorthodox political views.
Token Revolutionary
Indeed, many universities now welcome
the chance to hire a token radical
revolutionary. In the politically bland

atmosphere that prevails, many college
officials reason that a man like Bruce
Franklin won't pose a threat to their peace.
Consequently, job offers to Franklin
began to trickle in last year. In April, the
University of Colorado English Department
voted unanimously to hire Franklin.
Although the Colorado Board of Regents
voted 8-1 to reject Franklin, his support from
the faculty and the University president
showed that Franklin would not forever be
consigned to the status of academic pariah.
Franklin claimed that a smear campaign
conducted by the Stanford administrators
kept him from receiving employment and
would continue to prevent any school from
hiring him.
But Franklin's argument fell apart when
he received a temporary appointment at
Wesleyan University, and later a one-semester
job teaching at Yale.
Vendetta
Franklin however, has chosen to carry on
his vendetta against the Stanford
administration and the University itself. He
continues to repeat his pledge to make the
University rue the day it fired him.
His latest attempt to embarrass the
University is his authorship of a political
biography which will also include a jaundiced
view of the University's history.
In a Daily interview last week, Franklin
expressed unrestrained, childish delight in the
trouble he believes it will cause the
University.
While it would be rash to take Franklin's
predictions very seriously, one can't help but
wonder whether perhaps the University is
reconsidering the wisdom of dismissing

Franklin now that he is a living example of
Stanford's supposed intolerance.
In interviews with administrators both at
the University of Colorado and at Wesleyan, I
have been told that those schools supported
Franklin because they are more open minded
than is Stanford.
One student government leader even told
me that a school founded by Methodists
(Wesleyan) or to train Puritan clergy
(Yale) just has to be more tolerant than one
that was founded by a railroad baron.
Hypocrisy
Aside from the historical ignorance and
irrevelance of such a statement, it is blatantly
false.
Stanford dismissed Franklin at a time
when the nation's universities were reeling
under the student protests of the past few
years. Rightly or wrongly, faculty
investigators and leading administrators
regarded Franklin as a distinct threat to the
political stability of.the University.
Other universities no doubt would have
done the same had radicals who active
revolutionaries served on their faculties.
Harvard, for example, did not hesitate to
dismiss Timothy Leary.
If Yale, Wesleyan and the University of
Colorado were still in the throes of violent
protest, they would not have invited a
Franklin to teach. As I stated in a column
about Franklin last spring, "Anyone who
denies this is a hypocrite."
