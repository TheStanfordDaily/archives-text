# Israel, The PLO And History
## 
### Aharon Shenhar 
The appearance of Yassir
Arafat (the Palestine Liberation
Organization's leader) in the U.N.
last November had caused some
people to request that Israel
recognize the PLO and negotiate
with it about the Palestinians'
rights.
It is a natural tendency for any
open minded western world
citizen to support words like
"liberation," "self-definition" and
"independence." I think this
automatic support becomes very
dangerous these days, since the
PLO accepts it as a support for
the elimination of Israel.
Consider some facts. In 1947
the U.N. decided to divide
Palestine into two countries,
Arabic and Jewish. The Jews
accepted the decision and
declared independence in 1948.
This was a renewal of Jewish
independence after 2000 years.
The Arabs did not accept the
decision and attacked the new
state with the clear goal of
destroying it. This goal, and not
the creation of the Jewish state,
was the cause of the refugee
problem. The Arab governments
asked all the Arabs who lived
within the borders of the Jewish
state to leave their homes for a
few weeks until the liquidation of
the Jews.
Full Security Promised
It may be surprising, but the
Israeli government asked them to
stay and promised them full
security. The result was that the
Arabs who left are now occupying
the refugee camps and cannot
accept any citizenship, but those
who stayed (90 percent of them
were illiterate) are now 400,000
Israeli Arab citizens, and have the
highest average level of education
and standard of living among all
the Arabs today. Moreover, they
prefer to stay Israelis, even if a

Palestinian state is created.
The refugee camps were kept
for years and were used as a
political weapon by the Arabic
governments. Many people forget
that 800,000 Jewish refugees
came to Israel from Arabic
countries while forced to leave all
their wealth and property behind.
However, not one of these people
today is condidered a refugee and
no one even mentions their rights
for the left property.
When considering the PLO's
request for restoring the
Palestinian's rights, we must look
at the situation today. According
to UNRWA, there are 2.8 million
Palestinians. Out of them 600,000
are in refugee camps. These
people, and not the 2.8 million
that Arafat wants to bring to Tel

Aviv, are the problem.
The Arab states could easily
solve the problem, their huge area
is the least densely populated in
the world, they have 60 percent
of the world's oil, and within this
nation live some of the poorest
people in the world.
A Cruel Joke
It may sound like a joke, but
the Arabs spent only $600,000 on
their refugees in 1973. At the
same time they have an annual
budget of $250 million for
propaganda which tells how poor
the refugees are, and they have
spent $l5 billion for attacking
Israel in four wars.
A Palestinian state will only be
another Russian supported threat
to the existence of Israel. Looking
at the third point of the 10-point
program of the PLO from June,
1974, we find: "The PLO will
struggle against any plan for the
establishment of a Palestinian
entity if this would require
recognition of Israel and
conciliation with it." Point eight

speaks of "completing the
liberation of all Palestinian soil."
If this state is not intended to be a
part of Israel's territory, then it is
unclear why the Arabs did not
establish it before 1967 when all
the refugee camps were outside
Israel's territory. .
The PLO represents only
murder and terror. Its leaders are
all self-appointed, and they have
maintained themselves in power
by using the terror weapon against
their own people.
History shows many successful
cases of much larger population
exchange. Examples are Poland
and Germany, Greece and Turkey
or India and Pakistan. This case
should be the same; the 600,000

refugees must be accepted as
citizens in Arabic states, perhaps
in Jordan, since it is actually a
Palestinian state with Palestinian
majority.

We may expect that Israel will
support this solution with money
and even territory. As for
individuals in the western world
who are not limited by political
commitment, they should create
world wide public opinion that
will force the Arabs to accept
their responsibility for their
people and at the same time will
reject any recognition for terror
and murder.

all self-appointed, and they have
maintained themselves in power
by using the terror weapon against
their own people.
History shows many successful
cases of much larger population
exchange. Examples are Poland
and Germany, Greece and Turkey
or India and Pakistan. This case
should be the same; the 600,000

refugees must be accepted as
citizens in Arabic states, perhaps
in Jordan, since it is actually a
Palestinian state with Palestinian
majority.

We may expect that Israel will
support this solution with money
and even territory. As for
individuals in the western world
who are not limited by political
commitment, they should create
world wide public opinion that
will force the Arabs to accept
their responsibility for their
people and at the same time will
reject any recognition for terror
and murder.

The appearance of Yassir
Arafat (the Palestine Liberation
Organization's leader) in the U.N.
last November had caused some
people to request that Israel
recognize the PLO and negotiate
with it about the Palestinians'
rights.
It is a natural tendency for any
open minded western world
citizen to support words like
"liberation," "self-definition" and
"independence." I think this
automatic support becomes very
dangerous these days, since the
PLO accepts it as a support for
the elimination of Israel.
Consider some facts. In 1947
the U.N. decided to divide
Palestine into two countries,
Arabic and Jewish. The Jews
accepted the decision and
declared independence in 1948.
This was a renewal of Jewish
independence after 2000 years.
The Arabs did not accept the
decision and attacked the new
state with the clear goal of
destroying it. This goal, and not
the creation of the Jewish state,
was the cause of the refugee
problem. The Arab governments
asked all the Arabs who lived
within the borders of the Jewish
state to leave their homes for a
few weeks until the liquidation of
the Jews.
Full Security Promised
It may be surprising, but the
Israeli government asked them to
stay and promised them full
security. The result was that the
Arabs who left are now occupying
the refugee camps and cannot
accept any citizenship, but those
who stayed (90 percent of them
were illiterate) are now 400,000
Israeli Arab citizens, and have the
highest average level of education
and standard of living among all
the Arabs today. Moreover, they
prefer to stay Israelis, even if a

Palestinian state is created.
The refugee camps were kept
for years and were used as a
political weapon by the Arabic
governments. Many people forget
that 800,000 Jewish refugees
came to Israel from Arabic
countries while forced to leave all
their wealth and property behind.
However, not one of these people
today is condidered a refugee and
no one even mentions their rights
for the left property.
When considering the PLO's
request for restoring the
Palestinian's rights, we must look
at the situation today. According
to UNRWA, there are 2.8 million
Palestinians. Out of them 600,000
are in refugee camps. These
people, and not the 2.8 million
that Arafat wants to bring to Tel

Aviv, are the problem.
The Arab states could easily
solve the problem, their huge area
is the least densely populated in
the world, they have 60 percent
of the world's oil, and within this
nation live some of the poorest
people in the world.
A Cruel Joke
It may sound like a joke, but
the Arabs spent only $600,000 on
their refugees in 1973. At the
same time they have an annual
budget of $250 million for
propaganda which tells how poor
the refugees are, and they have
spent $l5 billion for attacking
Israel in four wars.
A Palestinian state will only be
another Russian supported threat
to the existence of Israel. Looking
at the third point of the 10-point
program of the PLO from June,
1974, we find: "The PLO will
struggle against any plan for the
establishment of a Palestinian
entity if this would require
recognition of Israel and
conciliation with it." Point eight

speaks of "completing the
liberation of all Palestinian soil."
If this state is not intended to be a
part of Israel's territory, then it is
unclear why the Arabs did not
establish it before 1967 when all
the refugee camps were outside
Israel's territory. .

propaganda which tells how poor
the refugees are, and they have
spent $l5 billion for attacking
Israel in four wars.
A Palestinian state will only be
another Russian supported threat
to the existence of Israel. Looking
at the third point of the 10-point
program of the PLO from June,
1974, we find: "The PLO will
struggle against any plan for the
establishment of a Palestinian
entity if this would require
recognition of Israel and
conciliation with it." Point eight

speaks of "completing the
liberation of all Palestinian soil."
If this state is not intended to be a
part of Israel's territory, then it is
unclear why the Arabs did not
establish it before 1967 when all
the refugee camps were outside
Israel's territory. .
The PLO represents only
murder and terror. Its leaders are
all self-appointed, and they have
maintained themselves in power
by using the terror weapon against
their own people.
History shows many successful
cases of much larger population
exchange. Examples are Poland
and Germany, Greece and Turkey
or India and Pakistan. This case
should be the same; the 600,000

refugees must be accepted as
citizens in Arabic states, perhaps
in Jordan, since it is actually a
Palestinian state with Palestinian
majority.

We may expect that Israel will
support this solution with money
and even territory. As for
individuals in the western world
who are not limited by political
commitment, they should create
world wide public opinion that
will force the Arabs to accept
their responsibility for their
people and at the same time will
reject any recognition for terror
and murder.
