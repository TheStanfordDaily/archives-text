# Vietnam: Still An Issue
## 
### Kit Worfield 
WASHINGTON—One month ago,
the young and brilliant Frances
Fitzgerald, winner of a Pulitzer
Prize for her powerful Vietnam
book, Fire In The Lake, sat in a
dark little restaurant behind the
Senate Office Buildings and
quietly insisted that what the
South Vietnamese people want
more than anything now is a
complete cut in United States aid
to the Thieu regime so that the
war may finally come to an end
and the beginnings of real peace
develop.
"With the exception of a few
Saigon generals and profiteers the
non-Communist South
Vietnamese now favor an end to
the war through a political
settlement," explained Fitzgerald,
who was last in Vietnam in May,
1974, and spent years there doing
research for her book after an
initial assignment to Indochina as
a news correspondent in the
mid-19605.
"The poor and the country
people have always wanted such a
peace. But now even those city
people who have benefitted from
the war see a continuation of the
military conflict as the greatest
threat to their future. Believing
that the present war policy will
lead only to disaster, they look to
negotiations with the North
Vietnamese and to the
organization of a non-Communist
political force to wage a political
struggle.
"What they fear most is that
the United States will betray them
by continuing to support the
Thieu regime, which opposes such
organization."
The next day, Congress cut in
half the amount requested by the
Administration for Indochina, a
dubiously admirable move,
appropriating only $7OO million
in so-called Postwar
Reconstruction Aid.
Label A Laugh
This label is a laugh, of course,
since "all but a tiny fraction of
the money goes straight into the
Saigon budget to pay the salaries
of soldiers and to finance
war-related projects," according
to Fitzgerald.
The eventual collapse of South
Vietnam has been inevitable since
the signing of the Paris Peace
Agreement in January, 1973. The
North Vietnamese have continued
to strengthen their military
position.

American analysts agree that
even a vast increase in American
aid would not avert Saigon's
collapse in the event of a major
military offensive from the North.
The war is a virtual time bomb, to
be defused only by bringing both
parties to the negotiating table as
soon as possible.
"In fact, only by cutting all aid
to the present Saigon regime can
the Congress prevent complete
disaster and carry out its
responsibility to the Vietnamese,"
declared the Vietnam expert over
stuffed flounder and California
wine.
"This would force the Thieu
regime into negotiations and
would not cause the North
Vietnamese to take advantage of a
weakened Saigon and pursue a
military victory," she said. "Why
seize absolute control by force of
a country already so politically
and economically shattered by
war? What the North Viets most
want is to peacefully implement
the accords they wrote into the
Paris agreements.
U.S. Aid Key Factor
"It is only the continued high
level of U.S. aid that is pushing
the North Vietnamese to the
point where they will feel
compelled to end it by a military
victory on the battlefield."
One month later, the province
capital Phuoc Binh has fallen in
the beginning of what western
analysts are viewing as the start of
a six-month Communist military
offensive designed to gain political
concessions from Saigon.
At the same time, it is reported
that U.S. planes have begun flying
reconnaissance missions over
North Vietnam, that stockpiles of
U.S. ammunition are being moved
from Thailand to South Vietnam
and that President Ford will "live
up to the law" barring U.S.
military activity in Indochina
but hopes to get Congressional
approval for an additional $3OO
million "emergency aid"
appropriation for South Vietnam.

Ford probably regrets that one
of his first approaches to the new
Congress will take the form of a
pitched battle over aid to
Vietnam.

I regret that Ford did not have
dinner with Frances Fitzgerald
when she was in Washington last
month.
And the war goes on.

American analysts agree that
even a vast increase in American
aid would not avert Saigon's
collapse in the event of a major
military offensive from the North.
The war is a virtual time bomb, to
be defused only by bringing both
parties to the negotiating table as
soon as possible.
"In fact, only by cutting all aid
to the present Saigon regime can
the Congress prevent complete
disaster and carry out its
responsibility to the Vietnamese,"
declared the Vietnam expert over
stuffed flounder and California
wine.
"This would force the Thieu
regime into negotiations and
would not cause the North
Vietnamese to take advantage of a
weakened Saigon and pursue a
military victory," she said. "Why
seize absolute control by force of
a country already so politically
and economically shattered by
war? What the North Viets most
want is to peacefully implement
the accords they wrote into the
Paris agreements.
U.S. Aid Key Factor
"It is only the continued high
level of U.S. aid that is pushing
the North Vietnamese to the
point where they will feel
compelled to end it by a military
victory on the battlefield."
One month later, the province
capital Phuoc Binh has fallen in
the beginning of what western
analysts are viewing as the start of
a six-month Communist military
offensive designed to gain political
concessions from Saigon.
At the same time, it is reported
that U.S. planes have begun flying
reconnaissance missions over
North Vietnam, that stockpiles of
U.S. ammunition are being moved
from Thailand to South Vietnam
and that President Ford will "live
up to the law" barring U.S.
military activity in Indochina
but hopes to get Congressional
approval for an additional $3OO
million "emergency aid"
appropriation for South Vietnam.

Ford probably regrets that one
of his first approaches to the new
Congress will take the form of a
pitched battle over aid to
Vietnam.

I regret that Ford did not have
dinner with Frances Fitzgerald
when she was in Washington last
month.
And the war goes on.

WASHINGTON—One month ago,
the young and brilliant Frances
Fitzgerald, winner of a Pulitzer
Prize for her powerful Vietnam
book, Fire In The Lake, sat in a
dark little restaurant behind the
Senate Office Buildings and
quietly insisted that what the
South Vietnamese people want
more than anything now is a
complete cut in United States aid
to the Thieu regime so that the
war may finally come to an end
and the beginnings of real peace
develop.
"With the exception of a few
Saigon generals and profiteers the
non-Communist South
Vietnamese now favor an end to
the war through a political
settlement," explained Fitzgerald,
who was last in Vietnam in May,
1974, and spent years there doing
research for her book after an
initial assignment to Indochina as
a news correspondent in the
mid-19605.
"The poor and the country
people have always wanted such a
peace. But now even those city
people who have benefitted from
the war see a continuation of the
military conflict as the greatest
threat to their future. Believing
that the present war policy will
lead only to disaster, they look to
negotiations with the North
Vietnamese and to the
organization of a non-Communist
political force to wage a political
struggle.
"What they fear most is that
the United States will betray them
by continuing to support the
Thieu regime, which opposes such
organization."
The next day, Congress cut in
half the amount requested by the
Administration for Indochina, a
dubiously admirable move,
appropriating only $7OO million
in so-called Postwar
Reconstruction Aid.
Label A Laugh
This label is a laugh, of course,
since "all but a tiny fraction of
the money goes straight into the
Saigon budget to pay the salaries
of soldiers and to finance
war-related projects," according
to Fitzgerald.
The eventual collapse of South
Vietnam has been inevitable since
the signing of the Paris Peace
Agreement in January, 1973. The
North Vietnamese have continued
