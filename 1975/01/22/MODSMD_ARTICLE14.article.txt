## Self Help Group Mends Broken Families; Confronts Society's Most Infamous Crime 
### KAREN LACHENAUER First of Two Parts 
Ralph 's second wife had been
chronically ill for three years and
doctors expected her to die
momentarily. Ralph worked at a good
I paying job that did not really test his
skills. He felt the burden of supporting
three children not his own..
One day Ralph came home to find
his 13-year-old stepdaughter lying on
the sofa; his wife was out
buying medicine. The TV was on but
the girl appeared to be asleep. Ralph
knelt down beside her, unbuttoned her
blouse and began to stroke her breasts.

John and his wife had been married
16 years and had a good sexual
relationship but ''after that long, what
is there to discover about a woman?"
he asks. To heighten their experience,
he read racy books the stuff
everybody reads, " x about affairs,
orgies, incest. "7 began to fantasize,"
he recalls. For a long time I held off,
but there was a fantasy partner right
there in the next bedroom."
One evening he entered his
12-year-old daughter's room and
fondled her through the covers,
through her nightclothes.
This behavior continued, once
every other week, sometimes twice a
week, for two years, until his daughter
told a friend.

Tom's marriage was dissolving over
intellectual differences. He thought his
wife preferred her career to him, and
that she feared his touch. At the same
time, he had to give a handicapped
daughter therapeutic spongebaths.
She was nubile, maturing. Almost
without realizing it, Tom started
bathing her behind locked doors.
Though I was charged with it, I never
had intercourse with her," he said
"but I did everything else I could
think of."

Incest has long been considered
society's most scabrous crime, but a
unique program is confronting that
' view. Santa Clara County's Child
Sexual Abuse Treatment Program is
making it possible for affected family
members to see the reasons behind
incest. . . and to love each other again.
"Incest is just another symptom of
a marital dysfunction, or problem,"
says Henry Giarretto, a marriage and
family counsellor who helped initiate
the project. "A lot of other things are
'wrong,' too: drinking, smoking,
extramarital sex.
"Most of these fathers involved
were never too social, so they looked
for something in the home. But it was
* all very spontaneous," he emphasizes.
"It just happened.
"Our view is that the 50 minute
hour in counseling these families is
insufficient. We try to marshal all the
•resources therapist, juvenile and
adult probation officers, lawyers and
i rehabilitation officers —in an intensive
treatment effort. We usually see clients
twice a week, but they feel they can
call us anytime."

Since July, 1971, Giarretto and a
team of counsellors, administrators
and aides in Santa Clara's juvenile
probation department has seen 200
families, 60 pf them presently in
therapy. There's been no recidivism
(repeat of the offense) and he says the
homes have three quarters of the
husbands and wives decide to stay
together.
Self help group parents United is
"central to the idea," Giarretto points
out. "It's very important to break
down the artificial professional facade.
I build them up. I tell them, 'You can
counsel me, too. You know more
about mechanics or computers than I
do.' We aim for self-awareness,
self-management and a good feeling
about 'me'.
"Usually, the offense occurs during
a time of low self esteem," he adds.
"We try to order the environment for
each person so he or she can take
charge again."

They look like people you'd meet
at a cocktail party, or have move in
next door. They are.
They are 37 men and women,
sitting in a large circle in a conference
room on the fourth floor of Santa
Clara County's Juvenile Center. They
represent a wide variety of income and
occupational groups a truck flriver, a
'waitress, the vice president of a
company. It's the first night of a new
year of weekly Parents United
meetings.
One man leans affectionately on
the back of his wife's chair and lights a
cigarette for her. A woman goes to the
urn at a sideboard and pours coffee for
herself and her husband. Taking a
handful of oreos, she takes a seat next
to him.
San Jose State graduate student and
helper Barbara Wilson leads off. She
asks everyone to close their eyes, go
inside themselves. Her words trace a
path for consciousness until it ends up
"behind your face."
After the refreshing exercise, a man
with salt-and-pepper hair speaks up.
"That's basically another way of
saying you have control," he imparts.
It's Giarretto, but you wouldn't know
he was the leader to look at him. Four
more staff people lose themselves in
the ring.
"Why are you here?" he challenges.
Someone across the room chuckles,
"We may not know why we're here,
but we know how we got here."
"No, we know why we're 'here,"
answers another. Spry frizzy-headed;
he presses his sneakers to the floor and
leans forward. "We're all.people whose
lives have been touched by incest and

we're here to help each other."
They count off by fours, breaking
into smaller sets and pulling their
chairs together so knees almost touch.
Sometimes Giarretto will divide
members according to sex, men and
women having rap sessions. A women's
group under the guidance of
Giarretto's wife,. Anna Einfeld, has
been holding discussions Wednesdays
two ranch groups, one for victims
under ten and one for teenagers, meet
occasionally.
Darkhaired Lyn mentions that
when she first discovered incest in her
home, she and her husband tried to
solve it themselves. "But psychiatrists
get expensive at 50 dollars an hour,"
she says. "And they stuck him in with
other people who couldn't relate to his
trouble.
"In Parents United, that much is
immediately settled. Everyone's here
for the same reason." /
"The best thing," another woman
sighs, "is knowing you're not alone."

Anyone can attend Parents United
meetings, and most people who do

have pretty good reason: women still
traumatized by childhood experiences;
"offenders" (in legal terms) laboring
to regain their family status as
breadwinners and fathers of their
daughters; wives coping with the
shock of realization. (Mother/son cases
rarely crop up.)
"Victims" live with guilt and
shattered egos, says Giarretto. Loving
their fathers, they go along with the
powerful influence figure until they
learn how taboo their actions are.
Then they feel guilty when they turn
their fathers in. And they feel their
bodies are up for grabs.
Annette has soft blond curls and
large blue eyes. At first, she appears
aloof, withdrawn into herself in as
small a space as she can occupy. But
when she gets to know you, her whole
face smiles and her blue eyes sparkle.
Like everyone at Parents United,
she has learned to talk about her past
openly, even gladly.
"It started when I was four,"- she
relates, working through bitterness.
"Late at night or when my mother was

gone, my father would enter the room
I shared with my older sisters and take
one of us by the hand, gently but
firmly. You knew you had to go."
Though they never discussed it, the
remaining girls cried as the chosen
sister was led into a shade-drawn living
room.
"I only remember about five
incidents I guess I repressed the
others so I don't know if we ever
had intercourse." But the guilt came
because her father was secretive and
because "sometimes I enjoyed it," a
fact she can now face.
Eight years passed before Annette
told her mother. That night her father
went to a mental institution. When he
came back, her parents moved their
double beds apart. The incidents were
never discussed.
Annette feels her history led to a
reckless adolescence. "On dates, I felt
obligated to make love to a guy"
which inverted to frigidity. Age 25,
married to an engineer, she is slowly
piecing together herself esteem. But
when she and her husband make love,
she has repulsive visions of her father.
She has never reached climax.

Promiscuity and anorgasmia are the
classic obstacles victims encounter. A
Washington University poll of deviant
women prostitutes and drug addicts
revealed that one quarter had
experienced sex with close relatives
when young. The same proportion of
preorgasmic women studied at
Berkeley had been sexually abused as
minors.
Molestation at the hands of fathers,
uncles, grandfathers, is as pervasive at
all socioeconomic levels in league with
child abuse (at least 100,000 cases per
year). Whether or not the children
have been raped "depends on how you
define rape," cautions Giarretto. "It
might include psychological
persuasion. A youngster is no match
for the wordly lover, especially when
the partner is a significant person in
her life. Kids want to 'make it' with
their parents in terms of esteem."
Early on, victims "act out" their
feelings. John's daughter Kathi lives at
a girl's ranch and goes home every
chance she gets and on weekends. But
for a while, the reverse was true
she'd run away from home, then
volunteer to go to Juvenile Hall.
Giarretto placed her in a girls' group
led by Administrator Bob Carroll.
She learned to control her impulses
when guilt, fear and fights with
younger brotners nagged her to flee.
Now when to she leaves the ranch, she
plans to stay home. How does she feel
about her father? "All right. I'm not

mad at him anymore for what went
on. I know he loves me as a daughter,
and I'm not afraid of him."
Annette says the next victim's
greatest hardship is not having anyone
to confide in. When she was 15, after
her father had returned from the
institution she nearly tore the house
apart in a mindless rage. "Dad
whacked me to break [the hysteria],
but later he told me he was
sorry ... for anything he might have
done. That's as close as we ever got to
discussing it."
Her parents' beds have been pushed
together again and since joining
Parents United, her own marital
problems have eased. At last, she looks
forward to her husband's arrival from
work. For the first two and a half
years of their three-year marriage she
dreaded it.

While pedophiles people who
compulsively seek relations with
children may have a typical
personality profile, incest offenders
don't, according to Giarretto. Texts on
the subject say they're
"psychologically unextraordinary."
"I don't think they rationalize it,"
says the counselor. "But some have
been studs from age five. Or there's an
illicit aspect that's exciting. Our
society's sociopathic anyway.
"They're family men, they love
their wives. Usually their marriages
aren't going too well and there's this
cute other woman in the house,
physically developing and dressed to
attract boys. Maybe she wiggles on
your lap while you're watching TV
and you get an erection."
"I didn't wake up in the morning
and say, 'Hey, this is what I'm gonna
do today,' " muses Tom about the
"maybe four" episodes with his
handicapped duagbter in a year.
"At the time, it felt great. I knew it
was a crappy thing to do to Jane I
thought, 'What the hell am I doing to
my daughter?' but there was
something I needed very much and I
didn't know what it was."
Tom, who's appeared on radio and
TV and submitted to questioning at
Giarretto's conventions, says "it" is
closeness. "I'd say that's the essense of
the problem. I'm writing a book on
the subject. Most men just miss that
closeness they had or were looking for
and never found."
His daughter's diary had fallen into
school officials' hands. They called the
authorities; Tom lost his job, went to
prison, and was forbidden to see Jane
for five years a harsh penalty later
dropped.
Tom had communicated his guilt to
his daughter by urging her not to tell
her mother. But Jane really hadn't
known anything her dad had done was
considered bad until the police
interrogated her and jailed Tom. Her
screams pierced the station. "You
can't do that to my Daddy!" she
wailed.
(Tomorrow: the legal and marital
penalties for incest.)
