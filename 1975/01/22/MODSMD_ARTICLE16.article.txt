### Cards Ranked 15th 
A week ago, one couldn't have
found Stanford listed, even among
the "others," in the national
basketball polls.
This week, one UCLA and one
USC win later, the Cardinals have
catapulted to 15th in the
Associated Press rankings and
18th in the United Press
International poll.
Members of the Athletic
Department staff racked their
brains yesterday trying to figure
out when Stanford last cracked
the top 20. To the best of their
knowledge, 1962-63 (when
Stanford tied UCLA for first in
the Pacific Eight) was the last
such season.
In another honor, the Pac-8 has
announced that Rich Kelley is its
player-of-the-week. Kelley scored
a total of 52 points and grabbed
38 rebounds last weekend.
Last week, junior forward Ed
Schweitzer won player-of-the
week mention.

AVOIDING THE COUNTâ€”Stanford wrestler Craig Reynolds struggles to free himself from the hold of an
Oregon grappler in a recent match here. Reynolds, at 167, was instrumental in leading the Cards to a
record-tying ninth victory in Sacramento yesterday, defeating Rod Harvey 8-5.
