# Pizza Paucity
## 
### 
Stanford basketball fans
apparently aren't eating enough
pizza or eating it at the right
place. In case you really care
about such things, Rich Kelley
ranks only 16th and Mel
Arterberry 46th in balloting for the
West team in the fourth annual
Pizza Hut Basketball Classic.
UCLA's Dave Meyers leads the
votegetters, with Tulsa's
Grasshopper Smith second. Guess
they must have grasshopper pizza
in Oklahoma.
