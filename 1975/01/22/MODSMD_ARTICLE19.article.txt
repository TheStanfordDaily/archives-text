# Try For Record Tomorrow
## Wrestlers Beat Sac State 
### MARK FUNK 
Stanford's wrestling team,
which racked up its ninth win of
the year with a 25-18 victory over
Sacramento State yesterday, will
be out to break a school record
when it entertains UC-Santa
Barbara tomorrow afternoon in
Encina Gym.
The mark most wins in a
single season was set at nine in
1974. Head coach Joe DeMeo
feels his charges have an excellent
shot at picking up their 10th win
and the record tomorrow.
"This is probably the strongest
team! UCSB has ever put on the
mats," DeMeo said. "But I think
we have a good chance to set the
record if we wrestle smart."
The Gauchos, coached by Ed
Schwartz, have been building a
reputable program for some time.
Under the tutelage of former
Olympian Bobby Douglas, who
has since moved on to Arizona,
UCSB recruited one of the better

small college outfits on the coast.
"We expect to be about 90
percent healthy for this match,"
DeMeo said of his
injury-plagued Cardinals.
"Malcolm Scott, who wrestles at
118, might be out and Gary Lynn
is still hurting, but other than
those people we should be ready
to go Thursday."
The first match gets underway
at 4 p.m.
In Sacramento, Stanford
domination of the middle weight
categories keyed the record-tying
win.
"We got some good efforts out
of the guys in the middle
weights," a please DeMeo pointed
out. "If we keep that up we will
be tough in the remainder of our
schedule."
Ken Krebs again turned in a
fine performance to highlight the
Sacramento match. He defeated
Gary Hubble at 142 to extend a
personal win streak to nine. The

final score was 8-4.
Mark Yancey, subbing for
Ail-American Chris Horpel at the
150 weight category, defeated
Rudy Padilla 8-4. "Mark just did
an outstanding job for us
yesterday," DeMeo said. "I felt
going into the match that the 150
pound weight class was going to
be pivotal."
Craig Reynolds also picked up
a crucial win at 167 when he
nipped Rod Harvey in a tight 8-5
decision.
Two other Cards looked good
in defeat. Roy Tolles dropped a
2-0 squeaker to his opponent on a
series of questionable stall tactics
and even more questionable
officiating. DeMeo said that loss
was "just a shame. Roy chased
that guy for five minutes and the
referee would only warn him
about stalling."
Charlie Nash was tagged with a
12-11 loss in a wild match at the
158 division.

categories keyed the record-tying
win.
"We got some good efforts out
of the guys in the middle
weights," a please DeMeo pointed
out. "If we keep that up we will
be tough in the remainder of our
schedule."
Ken Krebs again turned in a
fine performance to highlight the
Sacramento match. He defeated
Gary Hubble at 142 to extend a
personal win streak to nine. The

final score was 8-4.
Mark Yancey, subbing for
Ail-American Chris Horpel at the
150 weight category, defeated
Rudy Padilla 8-4. "Mark just did
an outstanding job for us
yesterday," DeMeo said. "I felt
going into the match that the 150
pound weight class was going to
be pivotal."
Craig Reynolds also picked up
a crucial win at 167 when he
nipped Rod Harvey in a tight 8-5
decision.
Two other Cards looked good
in defeat. Roy Tolles dropped a
2-0 squeaker to his opponent on a
series of questionable stall tactics
and even more questionable
officiating. DeMeo said that loss
was "just a shame. Roy chased
that guy for five minutes and the
referee would only warn him
about stalling."
Charlie Nash was tagged with a
12-11 loss in a wild match at the
158 division.
Stanford's wrestling team,
which racked up its ninth win of
the year with a 25-18 victory over
Sacramento State yesterday, will
be out to break a school record
when it entertains UC-Santa
Barbara tomorrow afternoon in
Encina Gym.
The mark most wins in a
single season was set at nine in
1974. Head coach Joe DeMeo
feels his charges have an excellent
shot at picking up their 10th win
and the record tomorrow.
"This is probably the strongest
team! UCSB has ever put on the
mats," DeMeo said. "But I think
we have a good chance to set the
record if we wrestle smart."
The Gauchos, coached by Ed
Schwartz, have been building a
reputable program for some time.
Under the tutelage of former
Olympian Bobby Douglas, who
has since moved on to Arizona,
UCSB recruited one of the better

small college outfits on the coast.
"We expect to be about 90
percent healthy for this match,"
DeMeo said of his
injury-plagued Cardinals.
"Malcolm Scott, who wrestles at
118, might be out and Gary Lynn
is still hurting, but other than
those people we should be ready
to go Thursday."
The first match gets underway
at 4 p.m.
In Sacramento, Stanford
