# Ford Vows To Veto Mandatory Rationing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford vowed yesterday to veto any
mandatory gasoline rationing
plan voted by Congress and rejected
Democratic demands that he delay
imposing tariffs on imported oil.
"I will not sit by and watch the
nation continue to talk about an
energy crisis and do nothing about it,"
Ford declared in a nationally
broadcast news conference, his first in
six weeks.
He urged prompt congressional
action on the package of economic
and energy proposals he outlined last
week. "By the late summer we ought
to see a turnaround both as to
economic activity and I hope in the
unemployment figure," Ford said.
Proclamation
Reading an opening statement,
Ford said he would sign a presidential
proclamation this week to impose the
tariffs on crude oil imports starting
at $1 on Feb. 1, going to $2 a barrel
March 1 and to $3 per barrel April 1.
"It is the first step toward regaining
our energy freedom," Ford said of the
proclamation.
With the disclosure of his planned
action, Ford rejected Democratic
demands that he delay the tariff plan
until Congress can act.
Chairman A1 Ullman of the House
Ways and Means Committee joined
Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and
Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) in pressing
for the delay.
Proposal
Ford announced the tariff plan last
week, and said it would be rescinded if
Congress follows his proposal that a
permanent $2 per barrel levy be placed
on both domestic and foreign crude
oil. These fees, combined with other
energy proposals, would increase retail
gasoline prices by about 10 cents per
gallon.

Ullman said Ford has agreed to a
congressional plan for splitting the
permanent levy and a quick
antirecession tax cut into two separate
legislative packages.
In defending his energy proposals
against Democratic criticism, Ford said
the revenues raised by the levies on
fuel will be channeled back into the
economy.
Rationing Unfair
He declared this approach is far
preferable to gasoline rationing, which
he denounced as inequitable, unfair
and a superficial answer to the energy
crunch.
During the mid-afternoon question
and answer session in an Executive
Office auditorium, the President also
disclosed he would ask Congress for
another $3OO million in military aid
for South Vietnam, but twice
sidestepped questions on whether
bombing raids would be resumed
against Communist insurgents.

"I don't think it's appropriate for
me to speculate on a matter of that
kind," Ford said.
Danger In Mideast
Ford also reiterated that the danger
of war in the Middle East is very
serious and that is why the
administration is maximizing its
diplomatic efforts with Israel and
some of the Arab states.
He also voiced disappointment with
Soviet rejection of the 1972 trade
agreement with the United States but
said detente will be continued,
broadened and expanded because it is
in the best interest of both countries.
Ford said he will seek deferral of
action on national health insurance
proposals because projected budget
deficits of $3O billion this year and
$45 billion next year should prohibit
any new spending programs.

Proposal
Ford announced the tariff plan last
week, and said it would be rescinded if
Congress follows his proposal that a
permanent $2 per barrel levy be placed
on both domestic and foreign crude
oil. These fees, combined with other
energy proposals, would increase retail
gasoline prices by about 10 cents per
gallon.

Ullman said Ford has agreed to a
congressional plan for splitting the
permanent levy and a quick
antirecession tax cut into two separate
legislative packages.
In defending his energy proposals
against Democratic criticism, Ford said
the revenues raised by the levies on
fuel will be channeled back into the
economy.
Rationing Unfair
He declared this approach is far
preferable to gasoline rationing, which
he denounced as inequitable, unfair
and a superficial answer to the energy
crunch.
During the mid-afternoon question
and answer session in an Executive
Office auditorium, the President also
disclosed he would ask Congress for
another $3OO million in military aid
for South Vietnam, but twice
sidestepped questions on whether
bombing raids would be resumed
against Communist insurgents.

"I don't think it's appropriate for
me to speculate on a matter of that
kind," Ford said.
Danger In Mideast
Ford also reiterated that the danger
of war in the Middle East is very
serious and that is why the
administration is maximizing its
diplomatic efforts with Israel and
some of the Arab states.
He also voiced disappointment with
Soviet rejection of the 1972 trade
agreement with the United States but
said detente will be continued,
broadened and expanded because it is
in the best interest of both countries.
Ford said he will seek deferral of
action on national health insurance
proposals because projected budget
deficits of $3O billion this year and
$45 billion next year should prohibit
any new spending programs.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Ford vowed yesterday to veto any
mandatory gasoline rationing
plan voted by Congress and rejected
Democratic demands that he delay
imposing tariffs on imported oil.
"I will not sit by and watch the
nation continue to talk about an
energy crisis and do nothing about it,"
Ford declared in a nationally
broadcast news conference, his first in
six weeks.
He urged prompt congressional
action on the package of economic
and energy proposals he outlined last
week. "By the late summer we ought
to see a turnaround both as to
economic activity and I hope in the
unemployment figure," Ford said.
Proclamation
Reading an opening statement,
Ford said he would sign a presidential
proclamation this week to impose the
tariffs on crude oil imports starting
at $1 on Feb. 1, going to $2 a barrel
March 1 and to $3 per barrel April 1.
"It is the first step toward regaining
our energy freedom," Ford said of the
proclamation.
With the disclosure of his planned
action, Ford rejected Democratic
demands that he delay the tariff plan
until Congress can act.
Chairman A1 Ullman of the House
Ways and Means Committee joined
Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and
Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) in pressing
for the delay.
