# Pro Prognosis
## Kareem Dines On Alfalfa-Eating Kid 
### Glenn Garvin 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton met
for the first time during pro basketball's
season Sunday. The result was one you
wouldn't wish on John McKay: Abdul-Jabbar
beat the big red rookie's head in.
Count them: Abdul-Jabbar had 50 points,
Walton five; Abdul-Jabbar had 15 rebounds,
Walton six; Abdul-Jabbar 11 assists, Walton
seven. It was the worst defeat for the
counter-culture since Proposition 19 got
wiped out a few years ago.
It wasn't particularly surprising, although
a lot of people who should know better (as
well as the San Francisco Chronicle) seemed
pretty astonished. To start with, Walton is
just coming off an 18-game layoff due to a
bone spur in his foot. It wasn't realistic to
expect him to be at his best.
For another, Abdul-Jabbar is by any
account one of the finest players in the NBA,
and to go with his superb physical skills he's
got a cunning and wisdom that go with five
years of pro ball.
Walton has the cunning that goes with
four months of pro basketball. Walton,
basketball's version of Euell Gibbons, is also
apparently having troubles making the
adjustment from the pampered, protected

life that UCLA basketball players enjoy
under John Wooden to the cruel realities of
life outside academia although Walton's
cruel realities, which he suffers through the
protective shell of a $2 million contract, are a
lot different than the ones most of the rest of
us have to deal with.
At UCLA, Walton was a college student,
and he could eat alfalfa and make silly
statements to his heart's content without
bothering anybody. People are generally
willing to put up with a lot from college kids
on the theory (probably incorrect) that some
day they'll amount to something that's at
least halfway worthwhile.
"I wouldn't blame if they took up arms
and went into open revolt," Walton once
said. "If a black man drove by and gunned
me down right now, I'd figure it was all right
because of what whites have done to blacks."
Normally this sort of statement is prima facie
evidence of mental incompetence, but no one
said much about it. And fortunately at
least for Walton no one ever tried to test
his sincerity.
Now, when Walton says something like
"I'm trying to become a nonconsumer"
which he did last week he's finding the

fans get a little bit impatient. After all, he
hasn't sent any of Portland's cash back. (He
also attacked the news media, particularly
Sports Illustrated , for "making money off
other people's labor." Apparently he thinks
brilliant columns like this one get written by
magic.)
Statements like these have made him a
more inviting target than he might otherwise
have been, and many sportswriters built up
the first meeting with Abdul-Jabbar far in
excess of what it could reasonably have been
expected to be. When Walton got clobbered,
there seemed to be more than a bit of
gloating.
Of course, a lot of knowledgeable people
don't think Walton is everything he's cracked
up to be on the basketball court. "I have
serious doubts he'll ever help them
offensively," said ex-all everything Oscar
Robertson after Sunday's game. "And he's
not the least bit overpowering on defense."
Perhaps. But Sunday's game was by no
means the final word. In fact, Abdul-Jabbar's
comment of last October, after he first
outplayed Walton in an exhibition game,
seems more appropriate: "Big deal."
