# Personalities On A Happy Weekend

### 
Overlooked in the splendor of Stanford's phenomenal pair of
basketball victories this weekend were the emotions of the 16,000
people who witnessed the games.
Saturday night, many fans (especially our photographers) gazed at
the most often-photographed cheerleader in the country (bottom

looks out (Daily program in hand) at his beaten Bruins.
After the games, most younger Stanford fans (like the one below)
go absolutely crazy. The older ones, like Rep. Pete McCloskey
(right), merely look bemused.
