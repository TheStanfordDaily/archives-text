Cambodian Troops Suffer Heavy Losses
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Government troops sent
to guard narrow sections of the Mekong River suffered
heavy losses yesterday, shipping sources said, and an
ammunition convoy scheduled to try to run to Phnom Penh
was still in South Vietnamese waters.
Diplomatic sources also reported the convoy of tug
boats pulling seven ammunition barges did not attempt to
run through the 45-mile gauntlet of Cambodian Communist
fire to the capital.
Government, marine and army units launched an
operation three days ago to secure five narrow strategic
points along the river. The troops landed from boats and
helicopters at three points late Monday night, and military
sources reported the insurgents suffered "very heavy
casualties," forcing them to evacuate two key positions.
However, one position manned by 200 Cambodian
marines just six miles from the South Vietnamese border
was overrun, sources said.
Some of the marines managed to reach South
Vietnamese territory and others were picked up by
Cambodian navy patrol craft, reports said.
A convoy has not reached the capital since Christmas
Eve. *
In South Vietnam, heavy fighting was reported south of
Da Nang for the first time in six months. The Saigon
command claimed 141 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
were killed, while two South Vietnamese soldiers were
killed and 16 injured.
Cost Of Living Up 12 Percent
WASHINGTON Inflation clipped more than 12 cents
off the dollar's purchasing power in 1974 as the cost of
living rose over 12 percent highest since World War II
price controls were lifted.
The bad news was offset somewhat by the Labor
Department's report yesterday that while the Consumer
Price Index jumped another seven-tenths of a percent in
December, it was the slowest rate since a similar increase
last July.
And, the department said, the purchasing power of the
average worker's paycheck increased in December after five
months of declines.
Real spendable earnings weekly pay adjusted for taxes
and inflation for the average married worker with three
dependents rose four-tenths of a percent last month, but
were still 5.4 percent below a year earlier as wages failed to
keep pace with inflation.
Director Albert Rees of the Council on Wage and Price
Stability announced that his panel would urge business and
labor to hold down prices and wage settlements in the
coming months.
Rees said the current rise in prices is no longer due to
the shortages and strong demand which pushed prices up
through most of 1974. "The leading elements in the process
are now the rising price of energy and rising unit labor
costs," he said in a speech to economists.
Palestinian Troops Move Into Lebanon
TEL AVIV Thousands of Syrian-trained Palestinian
soldiers have moved into southern Lebanon where Israel is
fighting a running war with Arab guerrillas, Israeli security
sources claimed yesterday.
The Palestinian troops from three units, probably under
direct command of the Syrian general headquarters, are
reinforcing the guerrillas, the sources charged.
The size of the reinforcements was not given but the
sources said they number several thousand. Intelligence
sources estimated 7000 guerrillas were in the Arkoub
region of Lebanon â€”known in Israel as Fatahland before
the reports of the arrival of the soldiers.
Defense Minister Shimon Peres has accused Syria of
planning to take over the region from which it could open a
second front against Israeli settlements in the Galilee area in
time of war.
Nader Appears At EPA Hearings
WASHINGTON Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said
yesterday the Ford administration's own analysis showed
automobile fuel economy could be raised 40 percent by
1980 without relaxing tighter auto emission standards set
for 1977 and 1978.
Nader released copies of a previously secret Federal
Energy Administration (FEA) analysis as the

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) opened hearings
on a request by the automakers to postpone for one year
the standards scheduled to go into effect in 1977.
President Ford has proposed slightly tightening up
current standards and then imposing a five year freeze.
Nader released what he said was an executive summary
which showed that the course chosen by Ford was not
favored by any of the government agencies that were at an
energy briefing at Camp David, Md. Nader did not testify at
the EPA hearings, but distributed his papers to newsmen
there.
The 1977 standards would reduce hydrocarbon
emissions to .41 grams per mile, carbon monoxide limits to
3.4 grams and nitrogen oxide to 2 grams.
Chrysler Vice President Sid Terry told the hearings that
those requirements would increase new car prices by $2OO
and set back the nation's drive for fuel economy while
having little beneficial effect on air quality.
Colson: Hunt Gave CIA Information
WASHINGTON Former White House counsel Charles
W. Colson has said that convicted Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt frequently passed information to the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) after the time the agency says it
severed its relations with Hunt, two sources said last night.
Colson told Sens. Howard H. Baker, Jr. (R-Tenn.), and
Lowell P. Weicker (R-Conn.), that Hunt delivered sealed
envelopes and packages to Richard Ober, a CIA
counterintelligence officer, who forwarded them to then
CIA Director Richard Helms, the sources said.
Colson said he suspected that the envelopes contained
tapes and other material relating to operations of the White
House Plumbers' unit, the sources said.
Three Year Study Finds SST Safe
WASHINGTON A three-year study dispels fear that
the present fleet of supersonic transports will damage the
earth's protective blanket of ozone, the Department of
Transportation said yesterday.
Dr. Alan J. Grobecker, who directed the study, said a
U.S. fleet of the high-flying planes would not have
weakened the ozone shield either. Plans for a U.S. fleet of
supersonic transports SSTs were scrapped in 1971 during
debate about possible health and environmental damage.
The ozone blanket protects the earth from radiation that
could cause skin cancer and from excessively high
temperatures from the sun.
High Court Rules For Women Jurors
WASHINGTON The Supreme Court ruled 8 to 1
yesterday that women cannot be automatically excused
from jury duty. It was another victory for the women's
rights movement.
The court's decision reversed a ruling 13 years ago in
which it said a state could require that women volunteer in
order to serve as jurors.
Since then, two-thirds of the membership of the court
has changed and the justices have ruled favorably on a
number of women's rights cases.
"It is untenable to suggest these days that it would be a
special hardship for each and every woman to perform jury
service or that society cannot spare any women from their
present duties," Justice Byron W. White said for the court.
The lone dissenter, Justice William H. Rehnquist, said
some of the reasoning relied on by the majority "smacks
more of mysticism than of law."
AMC To Offer Cash Rebates
DETROIT The American Motors Corp. (AMC) joined
other American auto makers yesterday in giving cash
rebates to buyers, and Chrysler Corp. said it may consider
expanding its rebate program due to competition.
American announced it would offer rebates of up to
$6OO on some of its small cars, becoming the last of the
four major U.S. automakers to institute a rebate program.
Chrysler began the parade of rebates on Jan. 12 in an
effort to battle the sagging sales that have left the auto
industry with massive backlogs of unsold vehicles and large
numbers of workers laid off.
Today's Weather
