# Professor Nur Protests UNESCO Israeli Policy
## 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Assoc. Geophysics Prof. Amos Nur
has refused an invitation to speak at a
scientific meeting this September, in
Banff, Canada, because it will be
partially funded by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
Nur, whose "dilatency" theory is
vital for predicting earthquakes, would
have delivered a major paper on
earthquakes.
Last month, UNESCO voted to
withhold all assistance form Israel, and
to exclude it from regional activities.
Nur, a native of Israel, wrote to the
organizing committee chairman for the
International Symposium on Induced
Seismicity, stating that "as a matter of
principle," he could not take part.
"I feel particularly strong about
this issue," his letter continued,
"because the members of UNESCO

chose, out of disagreement with the
policies of the Israeli government, to
reject the entire cultural and scientific
content of the Israeli society.
"But there's more involved than
reaccepting Israel," he said. "We're
dealing with the basic principle of
whether we recognize our cultural
values are greater than our political
system."
Nur said he hopes this decision,
coupled with the protests of "quite a
few very famous scientists," will make
people aware that UNESCO operates
"under a cloak of respectability given
by science, and under this cover, it's
controlled by political decisions.
"This is the only way to put
pressure on UNESCO," he added.
"Attempts to control science have
always existed, but so has resistance to
these attempts. It's a tough game for
us, but I really believe it's very
important."
