# Campus Hit By Flu Strain
## 
### 
A "mini" flu epidemic has broken
out on campus according to Dr. Beth
Dow of the Cowell Student Health
Center.
"We don't have accurate
information on the exact number of
flu cases reported this week," Dow
said. "But there is a viral-like illpess
that students seem to be coming down
with."
This particular strain of flu, which

as yet is unnamed, is characterized by
high fevers, muscular discomfort and
some cold-like symptoms. Dow said
that the strain was not particularly
serious, adding that fevers could reach
104 degrees.
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
the health center, pointed out that this
strain was "not the real influenza.
We've had a few cases of the Asian flu
reported, but it has been a mild
winter."
The infirmary, which McClenahan
said was the center's bell-wether, has
not admitted any more flu patients
than normal for this time of year.
Dow said that most flu victims
could expect the fever to break after
two or three days, but said that
students should probably stay off their
feet for about five days. "I know that
can be rough, though," she added.
"People witji the flu should avoid,
if possible, eating with others who
have not been infected, get plenty of
rest and not go to class," Dow said.
She also advised drinking fluids and
taking aspirin for the fever.
McClenahan concurred with Dow's
advice.
But personnel at Cowell do not
consider the outbreak especially
serious. "If you feel achy and have a
sore throat you might be coming down
with it," McClenahan warned. "But it
will not cause great discomfort."
Dow said that there were no
vaccines or medications other than
simple aspirin that Cowell was offering
patients.
