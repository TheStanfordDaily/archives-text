# Police To Issue Parking Tickets
## 
### 
Campus police plan to start issuing parking citations today to all student
vehicles not displaying 1975 parking stickers, according to Director of Police
Services Marvin Herri ngton.
The deadline for purchasing the $7.50 stickers was Monday. Herrington
said police decided to wait a few days after the deadline to begin ticketing.
The fine for a parking citation is $2.
Herrington said there was a big rush to buy the stickers just before the
deadline. He estimated that between 1000 and 1200 stickers had been bought
on Registration Day, but there were between 2000 and 3000 sold by
Monday.
"My guess is that there are still a lot of violations out there," Herrington
said. "We can't ticket everyone in one day we haven't the manpower. But
we will continue to enforce the parking policy. I think we'll get to everyone
in about a week."
