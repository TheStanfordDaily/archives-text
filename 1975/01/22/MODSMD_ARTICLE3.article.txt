# Other Agency To Absorb SWOPSI, SCIRE?
## Gibbs Defends Program Cut 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs last night suggested that
another program, possibly the
Undergraduate Special Program, direct
courses previously taught under
SWOPSI and SCIRE.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference , Gibbs said there is "a
need to have some agency with limited
scale experiments" like those offered
by SWOPSI and SCIRE.
Gibbs recommended last week to
Provost William F. Miller that SCIRE
end this June and that SWOPSI end by
June, 1976.
The SWOPSI Policy Board "is
skeptical that departments can absorb
what SWOPSI does," Gibbs said. "All
of what it does will not have to be
done by various departments. Maybe
another agency could offer
workshops."
"It is important to reserve [an
experimental component] within a
changing University," Gibbs
maintained.
No Adverse Effects
Undergraduate education here will
not suffer as a result of the proposed
cutbacks, Gibbs contended.
In addition, other programs will
continue to benefit undergraduates.
"People come from all over the
country to look at AIC" (Academic
Information Center;, Gibbs said.
"That, the Learning Assistance Center

and undergraduate specials will
continue."
An ad hoc committee will "explore
the feasibility" of adjunct courses
taught by para-faculty in Urban
Studies. Because University faculty
cannot grow on account of budget
limitations, Gibbs encouraged
"community participation" in
programs like Urban Studies.
Other Innovations
Gibbs emphasized that SWOPSI is
not the only "unique" program here.
He mentioned Human Biology,
Values, Technology and Society and
the new International Relations major
as innovative programs. There is also
deliberation now on distribution
requirements and the whole structure
of a liberal education, Gibbs said.
Also, he pointed out that the
Committee on Liberal Education is
studying how to make undergraduate
education "effective" during a time of
depleted financial resources.
Meanwhile, Gibbs called the new
Stnaford-in-Stanford proposal "one of
the most exciting programs yet" in his
tenure here.
Endorsement
He endorsed the program as revised
by ASSU President Mike Herman and
graduate student Tom Glenn in
yesterday's Daily, saying it was newly
refined and now fully operational.
"There are good reasons," Gibbs said,
"to have a residence with an academic
theme.

"This is the fastest development of
a program that has been
student-initiated. It's a credit to
Herman and Glenn," said Gibbs.
Gibbs agreed with the program's
founders that Stanford-in-Stanford
"will not be isolated" from the rest of
the University. Other courses, in
addition to those concerned with the
residence's theme Arms Control and

Disarmament can be taken by
program participants.
ASSU Praised
"The ASSU is a complement to the
University," Gibbs said. He added that
Stanford-in-Stanford will be financed
through the University as a result of
ASSU initiative.
The program's curriculum consists
of three required courses and two
other related courses to be chosen
from a list determined by the director.
Gibbs applauded the idea of a
simulated arms control negotiation in
the residence during spring quarter.

James Gibbs last night suggested that
another program, possibly the
Undergraduate Special Program, direct
courses previously taught under
SWOPSI and SCIRE.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference , Gibbs said there is "a
need to have some agency with limited
scale experiments" like those offered
by SWOPSI and SCIRE.
Gibbs recommended last week to
Provost William F. Miller that SCIRE
end this June and that SWOPSI end by
June, 1976.
The SWOPSI Policy Board "is
skeptical that departments can absorb
what SWOPSI does," Gibbs said. "All
of what it does will not have to be
done by various departments. Maybe
another agency could offer
workshops."
"It is important to reserve [an
experimental component] within a
changing University," Gibbs
maintained.
No Adverse Effects
Undergraduate education here will
not suffer as a result of the proposed
cutbacks, Gibbs contended.
In addition, other programs will
continue to benefit undergraduates.
"People come from all over the
country to look at AIC" (Academic
Information Center;, Gibbs said.
"That, the Learning Assistance Center

and undergraduate specials will
continue."
An ad hoc committee will "explore
the feasibility" of adjunct courses
taught by para-faculty in Urban
Studies. Because University faculty
cannot grow on account of budget
limitations, Gibbs encouraged
"community participation" in
programs like Urban Studies.
Other Innovations
Gibbs emphasized that SWOPSI is
not the only "unique" program here.
He mentioned Human Biology,
Values, Technology and Society and
the new International Relations major
as innovative programs. There is also
deliberation now on distribution
requirements and the whole structure
of a liberal education, Gibbs said.
Also, he pointed out that the
Committee on Liberal Education is
studying how to make undergraduate
education "effective" during a time of
depleted financial resources.
Meanwhile, Gibbs called the new
Stnaford-in-Stanford proposal "one of
the most exciting programs yet" in his
tenure here.
Endorsement
He endorsed the program as revised
by ASSU President Mike Herman and
graduate student Tom Glenn in
yesterday's Daily, saying it was newly
refined and now fully operational.
"There are good reasons," Gibbs said,
"to have a residence with an academic
theme.

"This is the fastest development of
a program that has been
student-initiated. It's a credit to
Herman and Glenn," said Gibbs.
Gibbs agreed with the program's
founders that Stanford-in-Stanford
"will not be isolated" from the rest of
the University. Other courses, in
addition to those concerned with the
residence's theme Arms Control and

Disarmament can be taken by
program participants.
ASSU Praised
"The ASSU is a complement to the
University," Gibbs said. He added that
Stanford-in-Stanford will be financed
through the University as a result of
ASSU initiative.
The program's curriculum consists
of three required courses and two
other related courses to be chosen
from a list determined by the director.
Gibbs applauded the idea of a
simulated arms control negotiation in
the residence during spring quarter.

FINANCIAL AID DEBATE—Nearly 200 minority students jammed Junipero lounge last night to discuss a Committee for
Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aids (CUAFA) proposal that need, not race by the determining criteria in the
