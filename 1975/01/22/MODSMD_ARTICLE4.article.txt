# Minorities Criticize Proposed Aid Policy
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Students from several minority
groups last night criticized new
procedures for University financial aid
decisions proposed by members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA).
Nearly 200 students packed
Junipero Lounge to participate in the
discussions.
The report, drafted by Financial
Aids Director Robert Huff, Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon and
Biology Prof. Paul Green, chairman of
CUAFA, recommends that all students
from low income families be treated
equally, regardless of race.
One student labeled the proposal
"absurd," and many others said it
lacked factual support.
Ricardo Reyna, a junior, said the
committee "has not had enough time
to form a basis for any policy change.
Nor has there been sufficient input
[from students] into the proposed
policy changes."
Denial
Green denied the latter charge,
saying, "The committee is only in the
early stages of the input-gathering
process."
One female student blasted the
committee for not beginning that
process sooner.
The proposal was submitted to the
committee last November. Copies were
not made available to other interested
parties until this month.
Recommendations
The report recommends that all
freshmen in the lowest income groups
seeking financial aid be expected to
provide $7OO in self-help during their
first year here, either through loans or
assigned campus jobs.
According to the proposal, aid for
subsequent years would be provided
by scholarships or grants.

In the past, the University has met
all demonstrated financial need of
blacks, native Americans and chicanos
in the lowest income groups through
scholarships and grants during the
freshman year. In subsequent years,
these groups were then expected to
provide at least $5OO of self-help per
year.
Current Policy Roots
The proposal states that the current
policy "is very much rooted jn the
circumstances of the late 1960s when
virtually all minority students [blacks,
native Americans and chicanos] came
from economically and educationally

EXCITED?—Dean of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs explains the need to
"have some agency with limited scale experiments," like those offered by
3WOPSI and SCIRE. Gibbs appeared last night on KZSU's Campus Conference.
