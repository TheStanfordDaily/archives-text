# Minorities Criticize Proposed Aid Policy
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Students from several minority
groups last night criticized new
procedures for University financial aid
decisions proposed by members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA).
Nearly 200 students packed
Junipero Lounge to participate in the
discussions.
The report, drafted by Financial
Aids Director Robert Huff, Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon and
Biology Prof. Paul Green, chairman of
CUAFA, recommends that all students
from low income families be treated
equally, regardless of race.
One student labeled the proposal
"absurd," and many others said it
lacked factual support.
Ricardo Reyna, a junior, said the
committee "has not had enough time
to form a basis for any policy change.
Nor has there been sufficient input
[from students] into the proposed
policy changes."
Denial
Green denied the latter charge,
saying, "The committee is only in the
early stages of the input-gathering
process."
One female student blasted the
committee for not beginning that
process sooner.
The proposal was submitted to the
committee last November. Copies were
not made available to other interested
parties until this month.
Recommendations
The report recommends that all
freshmen in the lowest income groups
seeking financial aid be expected to
provide $7OO in self-help during their
first year here, either through loans or
assigned campus jobs.
According to the proposal, aid for
subsequent years would be provided
by scholarships or grants.

In the past, the University has met
all demonstrated financial need of
blacks, native Americans and chicanos
in the lowest income groups through
scholarships and grants during the
freshman year. In subsequent years,
these groups were then expected to
provide at least $5OO of self-help per
year.
Current Policy Roots
The proposal states that the current
policy "is very much rooted jn the
circumstances of the late 1960s when
virtually all minority students [blacks,
native Americans and chicanos] came
from economically and educationally

disadvantages circumstances."
These "circumstances" have
changed since then, according to the
proposal, and this, the proposal says, is
the major reason for the procedural
change.
Several students charged that
circumstances have not changed
sufficiently to warrant the policy
change. One student claimed that "the
data the committee used to design the
proposal is irrelevant."
Committee Findings
Hargadon said that although the
University provides "a better financial
aid package" than other comparable
institutions such as Harvard, Yale or
Princeton the committee has found
in the past that many blacks, chicanos
and native Americans decided to go to
the other schools.
"The committee should not be
looking at minorities that are going
elsewhere, but rather at those going
here," one female student responded.
The committee, she added, should
be looking at minorities here in order
to determine whether or not these
people would have come to Stanford if
such a good financial aids program had
not been offered.
The committee will make a
recommendation to the Faculty
Senate in the next month on whether
or not the University should change its
current financial aids policy, Green
said.
The Faculty Senate must decide the
issue before March 1, Green, stated,
adding that if the issue is not decided
by that time, the current policy will
remain in effect.

Biology Prof. Paul Green, chairman of
CUAFA, recommends that all students
from low income families be treated
equally, regardless of race.
One student labeled the proposal
"absurd," and many others said it
lacked factual support.
Ricardo Reyna, a junior, said the
committee "has not had enough time
to form a basis for any policy change.
Nor has there been sufficient input
[from students] into the proposed
policy changes."
Denial
Green denied the latter charge,
saying, "The committee is only in the
early stages of the input-gathering
process."
One female student blasted the
committee for not beginning that
process sooner.
The proposal was submitted to the
committee last November. Copies were
not made available to other interested
parties until this month.
Recommendations
The report recommends that all
freshmen in the lowest income groups
seeking financial aid be expected to
provide $7OO in self-help during their
first year here, either through loans or
assigned campus jobs.
According to the proposal, aid for
subsequent years would be provided
by scholarships or grants.

In the past, the University has met
all demonstrated financial need of
blacks, native Americans and chicanos
in the lowest income groups through
scholarships and grants during the
freshman year. In subsequent years,
these groups were then expected to
provide at least $5OO of self-help per
year.
Current Policy Roots
The proposal states that the current
policy "is very much rooted jn the
circumstances of the late 1960s when
virtually all minority students [blacks,
native Americans and chicanos] came
from economically and educationally

disadvantages circumstances."
These "circumstances" have
changed since then, according to the
proposal, and this, the proposal says, is
the major reason for the procedural
change.
Several students charged that
circumstances have not changed
sufficiently to warrant the policy
change. One student claimed that "the
data the committee used to design the
proposal is irrelevant."
Committee Findings
Hargadon said that although the
University provides "a better financial
aid package" than other comparable
institutions such as Harvard, Yale or
Princeton the committee has found
in the past that many blacks, chicanos
and native Americans decided to go to
the other schools.
"The committee should not be
looking at minorities that are going
elsewhere, but rather at those going
here," one female student responded.
The committee, she added, should
be looking at minorities here in order
to determine whether or not these
people would have come to Stanford if
such a good financial aids program had
not been offered.
The committee will make a
recommendation to the Faculty
Senate in the next month on whether
or not the University should change its
current financial aids policy, Green
said.
The Faculty Senate must decide the
issue before March 1, Green, stated,
adding that if the issue is not decided
by that time, the current policy will
remain in effect.
Students from several minority
groups last night criticized new
procedures for University financial aid
decisions proposed by members of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA).
Nearly 200 students packed
Junipero Lounge to participate in the
discussions.
