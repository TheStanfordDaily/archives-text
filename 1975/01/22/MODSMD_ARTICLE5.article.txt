# $1.8 Million Deficit Projected
## Med School Begins Budget Cuts 
### JOHN FREED 
The Medical School is implementing a five-year
budget cutting program to ward off projected
annual deficits of up to $l.B million, Medical
School Dean Clayton Rich has announced.
Under the program, similar to the recently
completed University-wide Budget Adjustment
Program, the Medical School will show slight
surpluses for the years 1975-76 through 1979-80, if
forecasts prove correct.
"Our [income] forecast .. . would support a
zero percent growth in faculty and staff," Rich
explained. "But, we're in the process of developing
several basic science programs ... for which we'll
need a three percent increase in the number of
faculty and staff each year."
He said that the needed increase in the number
of salaried positions will be met by cuts in
administrative and other areas.
Program Supports Growth
"It [the program] will support the growth we
feel is necessary," Rich commented. "We will show
no loss. We will reduce the administrative and
support series first . . . then later we will look at
academic programs."
Without corrective action, losses over the next
five years would total more than $4 million, Medical
School figures show.
"If we did nothing other than what we've been
doing, that figure would be correct. But it's
absolutely unrealistic," Rich stated. "It's unrealistic
for the University [to take no action], and it's
unrealistic for the Medical Center."
According to Rich, the budget cutting program
titled Budget Review and Revision (BURR)
should be fully operative by Febraury.

"We're being careful to get it underway in away
in which it will be effective. In the hospital, it's
already under way," Rich noted. "In the Medical
School, we're just getting on with the administrative
process. It's getting along well. We expected to put
it into operation by the end of January."
Faculty salaries could be affected by BURR,
Rich conceded. A previous financial forecast had
estimated that faculty salaries would increase 10
percent a year.

"This rate of increase is considered necessary
because the salary structure in the Medical School is
significantly behind that of the rest of the
University, being at the 60th percentile for medical
schools nationally, except in the basic science
departments which are approximately at the 75th
percentile," Rich related.
Med School Comparison
He stressed that faculty salaries are figured by
comparison with medical school faculties at other
universities, rather than contrasted with faculty
members in other departments.
"We don't compare salaries, say, with the
Economics Department at Princeton. Rather, we
would compare them with Harvard Medical School
or Yale Medical School," Rich explained.
Rich could not confirm what impact BURR
would have on the salaries.
"Our plan is to bring the faculty salaries into line
with other medical schools," Rich said.
"Unfortunately, I do not have the final say on
salaries."
i Outgrowth Of Revisions
BURR was the outgrowth of revisions in earlier
financial forecasts, according to Rich. When the
University revised its financial estimates, the

Medical Center, which operates under a separate
budget, followed suit.
"What we did is very similar to what the
University did," Rich commented. "In fact, we used
.. . a whole host of assumptions made by the
University. Of course, in some areas the hospital,
for example we make our own assumptions.
"The University's assumptions caused a
considerable change in [its] five-year-forecast,"
Rich concluded. "The same type of changes
occurred in the Medical School projection."

forecasts prove correct.
"Our [income] forecast .. . would support a
zero percent growth in faculty and staff," Rich
explained. "But, we're in the process of developing
several basic science programs ... for which we'll
need a three percent increase in the number of
faculty and staff each year."
He said that the needed increase in the number
of salaried positions will be met by cuts in
administrative and other areas.
Program Supports Growth
"It [the program] will support the growth we
feel is necessary," Rich commented. "We will show
no loss. We will reduce the administrative and
support series first . . . then later we will look at
academic programs."
Without corrective action, losses over the next
five years would total more than $4 million, Medical
School figures show.
"If we did nothing other than what we've been
doing, that figure would be correct. But it's
absolutely unrealistic," Rich stated. "It's unrealistic
for the University [to take no action], and it's
unrealistic for the Medical Center."
According to Rich, the budget cutting program
titled Budget Review and Revision (BURR)
should be fully operative by Febraury.

"We're being careful to get it underway in away
in which it will be effective. In the hospital, it's
already under way," Rich noted. "In the Medical
School, we're just getting on with the administrative
process. It's getting along well. We expected to put
it into operation by the end of January."
Faculty salaries could be affected by BURR,
Rich conceded. A previous financial forecast had
estimated that faculty salaries would increase 10
percent a year.

"This rate of increase is considered necessary
because the salary structure in the Medical School is
significantly behind that of the rest of the
University, being at the 60th percentile for medical
schools nationally, except in the basic science
departments which are approximately at the 75th
percentile," Rich related.
Med School Comparison
He stressed that faculty salaries are figured by
comparison with medical school faculties at other
universities, rather than contrasted with faculty
members in other departments.
"We don't compare salaries, say, with the
Economics Department at Princeton. Rather, we
would compare them with Harvard Medical School
or Yale Medical School," Rich explained.
Rich could not confirm what impact BURR
would have on the salaries.
"Our plan is to bring the faculty salaries into line
with other medical schools," Rich said.
"Unfortunately, I do not have the final say on
salaries."
i Outgrowth Of Revisions
BURR was the outgrowth of revisions in earlier
financial forecasts, according to Rich. When the
University revised its financial estimates, the

Medical Center, which operates under a separate
budget, followed suit.
"What we did is very similar to what the
University did," Rich commented. "In fact, we used
.. . a whole host of assumptions made by the
University. Of course, in some areas the hospital,
for example we make our own assumptions.
"The University's assumptions caused a
considerable change in [its] five-year-forecast,"
Rich concluded. "The same type of changes
occurred in the Medical School projection."

The Medical School is implementing a five-year
budget cutting program to ward off projected
annual deficits of up to $l.B million, Medical
School Dean Clayton Rich has announced.
Under the program, similar to the recently
completed University-wide Budget Adjustment
Program, the Medical School will show slight
surpluses for the years 1975-76 through 1979-80, if
forecasts prove correct.
