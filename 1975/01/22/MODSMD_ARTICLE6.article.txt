# Open Filing Available To Job Hunters

### KATHY BATTS 
Students and alumni, planning to
establish a file at the Career Planning
and Placement Center, now have the
option of establishing either open or
confidential files, according to the
office of Ralph Keller, director of
Career Planning and Placement.
The option, effective Jan. 1, was
created in response to a request by
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president, for solutions to problems
arising from the controversial Buckley
Amendment. The amendment
establishes the right of students to
look into their confidential files.
Should a student wish to establish
an open file, he or she is required to
fill out a form for the placement
office. All letters of recommendation
then written for the student will be
written with the understanding that
the student has access to the file.
Should a student prefer a closed
file, he or she must sign a waiver,
foregoing the right to inspect his or
her file. All confidential letters of
recommendation will then be withheld
from the student.
In explaining the advantages of the
two types of files, a spokesman at the
placement center noted that "some
prospective employers consider
confidential files more objective and
more valid and therefore choose for
final consideration from among those
candidates who submitted confidential
files."
The spokesman added that student
and alumni files submitted to the
placement center before Jan. 1, were
confidential. Should anyone with a
formerly closed file wish to open it,
the confidential letters of
recommendation would be removed
from the file and new letters would
have to be solicited, the spokesman
said.
A secretary at the placement center
said several forms have already been
returned to the office, stating whether
students preferred open or
confidential files. "However, we're not
counting them," she added.
