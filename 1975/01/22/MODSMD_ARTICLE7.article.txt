SWOPSI Clarification
Editor:
Certain aspects of Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs' and President Richard
Lyman's position on the demise
of SWOPSI require clarification.
SWOPSI courses are student
initiated few departments have
shown the inclination to accept
student input on curriculum or
have the intellectual breadth to
feel comfortable with the broad
interdisciplinary approach of
SWOPSI. Needless to say, most
departments are not prepared to
deal with applied studies with
the possible exception of the
School of Engineering.
SWOPSI incorporates low cost
outside sources for leaders, and
perhaps in our impending budget
crunch this constitutes a threat to
our all too comfortable
administrators. We seem to have a
real conflict of class interests here,
where our massive bureaucracy is
finding it necessary to chop
academically worthwhile
programs to save their own jobs
witness Gibbs' and Lyman's
willingness to chop programs but
not to reduce their own very
adequate salaries. They will no
doubt succeed, and I find that
very frustrating.
There are two groups at
Stanford who should be interested
in quality education, as opposed
to the quantity of administration.
I obviously mean the faculty and
students. The faculty holds real
power here, up to and including
the power to depose top (in
salary) administrators.
Unfortunately the faculty, under
the pressure of budget cuts, will
find it all too easy to defend only
their own departments at the
expense of the University as a
whole.

Students at Stanford have
previously taken action only
under extreme duress, that action
taking the form of such innocuous
actions as petitions, Senate
resolutions, ASSU presidential
pronouncements and the like. Of
course such things as mass sit-ins,
office occupations and picketing
have found support in past years.
Lyman has in the past
advanced the doctrine of rational
dialogue, while in essence ruling
by decree. The University's
posture on student input through
the budget priorities commission
has been shown to be clearly
illusory and a strong student
reaction is the only possible
response.

Official Ripoff
Editor:
The recent resurgence of
suspicion concerning political
assasinations in the United States
has arrived appropriately timed
with revelations about widespread
illegal CIA activity.
Great. How long will it take
before the citizens of this nation
are able to comprehend the extent
to which they are being ripped off
by government "intelligence
agencies" and "investigation
bureaus"?

Truly Watergate may be only
the beginning of a mass movement
to reveal "behind the scenes"
activities. The many controversial
theories surrounding
assassinations have only so-far
served to generate a national,
unfocused curiosity.
A channeling of this growing
curiosity and sense of betrayal
into directed movements is needed
to expose the truth more
effectively. After all, the CIA
has just openly admitted to having
spied on 10,000 of us. What might
they admit to having committed
next?

Open files to the Kennedy
assassination which have been
closed until 2039 we may find
that one coverup leads to another.
Maybe Johnson did close that case
in "better public interest," that is,
to prevent truths from reaching
the American public which might
have caused frantic outrage.
Demand rigorous action against
the CIA.
If the movies, lectures and
literature concerning these issues
serve only to enthrall and
entertain us, we have wasted
energy. I am hopeful American
citizens will be able to demand
action immediately. As a
"self-governing" people, we must
gain a knowledge of what occurs,
and has been occuring daily,
behind our backs.

Spectator Sport?
Editor:
Graduate Student, Electrical
Engineering, in referring (Daily,
Jan. 17,) to certain
undesirable aspects of riding
bicycles on the left-hand side of
the road and on the right-hand
side of the street, concluded with
the statement that "either one is
dangerous enough, but doing both
at once is sheer madness," and the
editor commented that "it is also
illegal." I hereby volunteer to sell
tickets to view this mad, illegal
and so far as I know impossible
feat.

Diminishing Returns
Editor:
At a time when tuition costs
are steeply climbing, the benefits
and services rendered students are
being diminished. We are expected
to expend another $435 a year for
tuition, yet the very programs
that most benefit the students and
distinguish Stanford from other
universities are being deleted.

One of the reasons I
transferred here from a state
supported university was
Stanford's approach to education;
here, I understood, were programs
designed to facilitate learning in a
non-classroom type setting.
Now SCIRE, Which has
recognized the needs of transfer
students, is going to be terminated
in June. Who is going to take over
the service that Alice Supton and
her staff have provided?
When accepted here as a
transfer student, I received a copy
of Approaching Stanford,
written by and for incoming
freshmen. But I was not a
freshmen. A two and a half page
"Supplement for Transfer
Students" was included, but it did
little to warn or prepare the
transfers for the problems they
would face.
This year SCIRE, has organized
a task force to examine the
problems and difficulties transfers
face and to compile an
Approaching Stanford type book
especially for them. This is
something that has been needed
for years, as any transfer can
testify, but has never been done.
Yet this is only one of SCIRE's
projects. The many other services
that SCIRE provides are likewise
important. Will these services
really be "absorbed elsewhere in
the University?" The education
for which many students selected
Stanford will be severely
diminished if they are not.
