# Terman Center Problems Foreseen
## Building To Force Road Closures 
### MARK LICKER 
Construction of the new Terman
Engineering Center will result in the
closing of portions of Lomita Drive
and Panama Street to traffic beginning
in early 1977, according to the
University Planning Office.
The present Lomita Drive will
become a mall between the Mitchell
Earth Sciences Building and Santa
Teresa Street. Panama Street will be
closed to traffic between Roble Gym
and Lomita, with the present parking
facilities on Santa Teresa and near the
Computation Center to be used by
Engineering, Roble Gym, and Storke
Student Publications Building traffic.
The closed stretch of Lomita will
be replaced by the road now under
construction next to Roble Gym from
Santa Teresa to Panama.
Executive Assistant to the Vice
President and Provost Ed Shaw and
University Master Planner Oscar
Nelson met with staff frojn Roble
Gym and the Daily last week to
resolve problems of delivery access and
employee security in the area occupied
by the new buildings.

Typesetters at the ASSU
Typesetting Shop must frequently stay
at the Storke Building until 2 a.m. and
would have to walk several blocks to
the nearest parking areas. Deliveries of
the Daily and transportation of
printing material in bad weather also
pose a difficulty.
"The security problem is not easily
addressed by parking facilities near the
Computation Center it's too far
away," Shaw said. "Some better way
of handling parking will have to be
found."
Nelson noted that closing the area
to regular traffic "does not preclude
emergency, delivery and other
vehicles. We have to work out
something feasible."
Women's Physical Education
Department Chairperson Pamela
Strathairn feels that the new street and
lighting adjacent to Roble Gym "will
be a real improvement." Strathairn
indicated that there is ample parking
in the area, but that heavy traffic on
the new road so close to Lagunita and
Roble Halls "h&s to be watched."
Shaw explained that a mall

stretching from the Mitchell Building
to the Terman center "would be
exceptionally nice if we can resolve
delivery and security questions. We
don't want Terman Center isolated
from the rest of Engineering by a
major thoroughfare."
The $lO million center, by
a gift from Hewlett-Packard, will
house the School of Engineering
offices now situated in the Quad.

"The security problem is not easily
addressed by parking facilities near the
Computation Center it's too far
away," Shaw said. "Some better way
of handling parking will have to be
found."
Nelson noted that closing the area
to regular traffic "does not preclude
emergency, delivery and other
vehicles. We have to work out
something feasible."
Women's Physical Education
Department Chairperson Pamela
Strathairn feels that the new street and
lighting adjacent to Roble Gym "will
be a real improvement." Strathairn
indicated that there is ample parking
in the area, but that heavy traffic on
the new road so close to Lagunita and
Roble Halls "h&s to be watched."
Shaw explained that a mall

stretching from the Mitchell Building
to the Terman center "would be
exceptionally nice if we can resolve
delivery and security questions. We
don't want Terman Center isolated
from the rest of Engineering by a
major thoroughfare."
The $lO million center, by
a gift from Hewlett-Packard, will
house the School of Engineering
offices now situated in the Quad.

CHANGES UNDERWAY—As a result of the upcoming construction of the new Terman Engineering Center, traffic will be
closed on a stretch of Lomita Drive, and work has begun on a new road as a replacement. The road will be located near
Roble Gym, extending from Santa Teresa to Panama.
Construction of the new Terman
Engineering Center will result in the
closing of portions of Lomita Drive
and Panama Street to traffic beginning
in early 1977, according to the
University Planning Office.
The present Lomita Drive will
become a mall between the Mitchell
Earth Sciences Building and Santa
Teresa Street. Panama Street will be
closed to traffic between Roble Gym
and Lomita, with the present parking
facilities on Santa Teresa and near the
Computation Center to be used by
Engineering, Roble Gym, and Storke
Student Publications Building traffic.
The closed stretch of Lomita will
be replaced by the road now under
construction next to Roble Gym from
Santa Teresa to Panama.
Executive Assistant to the Vice
President and Provost Ed Shaw and
University Master Planner Oscar
Nelson met with staff frojn Roble
Gym and the Daily last week to
resolve problems of delivery access and
employee security in the area occupied
by the new buildings.

Typesetters at the ASSU
Typesetting Shop must frequently stay
at the Storke Building until 2 a.m. and
would have to walk several blocks to
the nearest parking areas. Deliveries of
the Daily and transportation of
printing material in bad weather also
pose a difficulty.
