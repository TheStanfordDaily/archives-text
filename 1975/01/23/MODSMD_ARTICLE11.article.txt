# Campaign Laws Anti-Libertarian?
## 
### Bill Evers 
Lately the country has been afflicted with
numerous election campaign reform laws. A
coalition of corporate liberals centered in the
Common Cause organization believes (like
the corporate liberal municipal reformers of
the Progressive era) that reform of electoral
procedures will advance their interests.
The campaign practices reforms will have
the effect of aiding the Establishment liberal
politicians who favor flexible revamping and
streamlining of the existing system. But the
reforms freeze out ideological or radically
reformist third parties.
In addition, the reforms place purported
"public interest" (but really special interest)
groups like Common Cause and the
Committee for Economic Development in a
good position to lobby for corporate liberal
interests while denying to victims of the
corporate liberal policies the right to organize
or publish effectively in self-defense.
The election reforms are a direct attack, as
well, upon such fundamental human rights as
freedom of the press, freedom of speech,
freedom of association and the right to
privacy. Fortunately, in several recent law
suits, defenders of civil liberties are
challenging this flood of anti-libertarian
regulations clothed in mealy-mouthed
"progressive" language.
The national American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), the Southern California
ACLU, and the Washington State ACLU have
joined with the Trotskyist Socialist Workers
Party in attempting to overturn the
requirement that the names of campaign
contributors be disclosed.

"These requirements are outrageous," the
co-chairman of the Socialist Workers' 1974
national campaign committee said at an
ACLU press conference last September. "For
us to turn over names of our contributors
means to supply the government with
ready-made lists of individuals who will only
become new targets for harassment."
The Socialist Workers maintain that they
can document invasions of privacy and other
government harassment as a result of the
forced disclosure of the names and
occupations of their contributors. The FBI,
which recently went to court to defend its
practice of surveillance at Socialist Workers'
political conventions, has already admitted to
conducting an "SWP Disruption Program"
that included attempts at infiltration and the
use of electronic bugging and the
interception of mail.
Like the efforts by Southern states to
obtain the membership list of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People during the time of civil rights
activism, the forced disclosure of
contributors destroys the individual's right to
freely associate with whomever he pleases.
In another case, the ACLU had tried to
place an ad in the New York Times stating
the organization's opposition to several
anti-busing bills before Congress at the time.
The ad listed the 103 representatives who
had already declared their opposition to the
bills.
As a result, the ACLU was considered to
be a political committee, which required
disclosure of its membership, and the ACLU

was ordered to supply evidence to the Times
that the expense of the ad would not cause
any of the 103 representatives to exceed
their campaign limits. The case is now before
the U.S. Supreme Court.
In addition, a suit mounted by a diverse
coalition of political groups attacks the
constitutionality of the Federal Campaign
Practices Act of 1971 as violating the First,
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Amendments.
Joined in this coalition are former Sen.
Eugene McCarthy, Sen. James Buckley, Rep.
William Steiger, the New York ACLU, the
New York State Conservative Party, the
American Conservative Union, Human Events
v newsletter and the national Libertarian Party.
The suit challenges most aspects of the
act: limits on contribution size, limits on
campaign expenses, limits on activities of
volunteers, limits on expenditures of national
committees, and requirements of reporting
and disclosure. The suit also questions
government financing of campaigns noting
that the Libertarian Party's philosophy
prevents them from accepting money from
the government.
In the words of the San Francisco
Chronicle what we need is less, nor more,
limiting of individuals "putting their money
where their political interest, emotions,
aspirations lie." Contributions to help battle
this new onslaught of tyranny can be sent to
the ACLU, 22 E. 40th St., New York City
10016.

Lately the country has been afflicted with
numerous election campaign reform laws. A
coalition of corporate liberals centered in the
Common Cause organization believes (like
the corporate liberal municipal reformers of
the Progressive era) that reform of electoral
procedures will advance their interests.
The campaign practices reforms will have
the effect of aiding the Establishment liberal
politicians who favor flexible revamping and
streamlining of the existing system. But the
reforms freeze out ideological or radically
reformist third parties.
In addition, the reforms place purported
"public interest" (but really special interest)
groups like Common Cause and the
Committee for Economic Development in a
good position to lobby for corporate liberal
interests while denying to victims of the
corporate liberal policies the right to organize
or publish effectively in self-defense.
The election reforms are a direct attack, as
well, upon such fundamental human rights as
freedom of the press, freedom of speech,
freedom of association and the right to
privacy. Fortunately, in several recent law
suits, defenders of civil liberties are
challenging this flood of anti-libertarian
regulations clothed in mealy-mouthed
"progressive" language.
The national American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), the Southern California
ACLU, and the Washington State ACLU have
joined with the Trotskyist Socialist Workers
Party in attempting to overturn the
requirement that the names of campaign
contributors be disclosed.

"These requirements are outrageous," the
co-chairman of the Socialist Workers' 1974
national campaign committee said at an
ACLU press conference last September. "For
us to turn over names of our contributors
means to supply the government with
ready-made lists of individuals who will only
become new targets for harassment."
The Socialist Workers maintain that they
can document invasions of privacy and other
government harassment as a result of the
forced disclosure of the names and
occupations of their contributors. The FBI,
which recently went to court to defend its
practice of surveillance at Socialist Workers'
political conventions, has already admitted to
conducting an "SWP Disruption Program"
that included attempts at infiltration and the
use of electronic bugging and the
interception of mail.
Like the efforts by Southern states to
obtain the membership list of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People during the time of civil rights
activism, the forced disclosure of
contributors destroys the individual's right to
freely associate with whomever he pleases.
In another case, the ACLU had tried to
place an ad in the New York Times stating
the organization's opposition to several
anti-busing bills before Congress at the time.
The ad listed the 103 representatives who
had already declared their opposition to the
bills.
As a result, the ACLU was considered to
be a political committee, which required
disclosure of its membership, and the ACLU

was ordered to supply evidence to the Times
that the expense of the ad would not cause
any of the 103 representatives to exceed
their campaign limits. The case is now before
the U.S. Supreme Court.
In addition, a suit mounted by a diverse
coalition of political groups attacks the
constitutionality of the Federal Campaign
Practices Act of 1971 as violating the First,
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Amendments.
Joined in this coalition are former Sen.
