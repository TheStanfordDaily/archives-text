# Dropping Irish: A Grave Mistake
## 
### Robert McAfee Brown 
I hope this is only one of many
protests the Daily will receive over
the University's decision not to
give tenure to Religious Studies
Prof. Jerry Irish. I am filled
with such a sense of outrage and
disbelief at this decision, that it is
still difficult to summon any kind
of rational response that might be
communicable to someone else.
But let me try.
That Irish is a superb teacher is
contested by no one. First winner
of Stanford's Walter A. Gores
Award for Excellence in Teaching
several years ago, he has
continued to be one of the truly
outstanding teachers in this
University. I have team-taught
with him and I have talked with
scored of his students, so I know
whereof I speak.
He has a dedication to the
classroom and to exacting
performance on the part of both
himself and his students that is a
model for all of us. His
commitment to students as
persons, and his willingness to give
them lavish amounts of his time,
is known throughout the student
body.
Irish's sin is that he has
published too little and too late.
A book is coming out this spring,
an essay will shortly appear in a
prestigious symposium The
Library of Living Philosophers,
two articles have been accepted in
scholarly journals and there have
been four or five book reviews
all of this done within the last
year and a half.
'Scholarly Attainment'
Not only his colleagues in
religious studies at Stanford, but
eminent outside referees, have
testified to the scholarly
attainment of the main materials.
As his friends know, within the
last four years Irish and his wife
have lost two sons, which might in
some quarters have been
considered a significant reason for
not having much literary
production during that period.
But the publication is too little
and too late.
The only message I can draw
out of the University's decision is
that superior teaching really does not
count here. What counts is literary
production, and any slightest
presumed deficiency in the latter
area negates superior performance

in the former area.
If I were junior member of the
Stanford faculty, hoping some
day to attain tenure, the word
that would come through to me
loud and clear would be: "Do not
invest yourself in students. Do not
concentrate on excellence in the
classroom. Lock that office door
and write. Otherwise, you have no
future at Stanford."
Setting Goals
Stanford is in process of setting
its goals for the future. I had
hoped that those goals would
inspire new dedication on the part
of the various components of the

Stanford faculty. And I must
express the gravest concern that
Stanford has no place in its future
for professors of Irish's quality
and caliber. I am bitter over what
the University decision means for
him, and I am deeply disturbed
over what his loss means for the
University.
I hope that other members of
the University community who
feel as I do will voice their
concern, through letters to the
Daily and also through letters to
the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences (in whose office the
decision was made), the President

and the Chairman of the Board of
Trustees.
Such actions will not salvage a
future at Stanford for Irish, but
they might lead the University to
reconsider policies that eventuate
in the dropping of future
professors of h»s caliber. And they
might give Irish at least the ironic
satisfaction of knowing that many
people affirm his importance to
this institution, even if the few
people with power to keep him
here do not.

in the dropping of future
professors of h»s caliber. And they
might give Irish at least the ironic
satisfaction of knowing that many
people affirm his importance to
this institution, even if the few
people with power to keep him
here do not.
(Robert McAfee Brown is a
professor of religious studies.)
I hope this is only one of many
protests the Daily will receive over
the University's decision not to
give tenure to Religious Studies
Prof. Jerry Irish. I am filled
with such a sense of outrage and
disbelief at this decision, that it is
still difficult to summon any kind
of rational response that might be
communicable to someone else.
But let me try.
That Irish is a superb teacher is
contested by no one. First winner
of Stanford's Walter A. Gores
Award for Excellence in Teaching
several years ago, he has
continued to be one of the truly
outstanding teachers in this
University. I have team-taught
with him and I have talked with
scored of his students, so I know
whereof I speak.
He has a dedication to the
classroom and to exacting
performance on the part of both
himself and his students that is a
model for all of us. His
commitment to students as
persons, and his willingness to give
them lavish amounts of his time,
is known throughout the student
body.
Irish's sin is that he has
published too little and too late.
A book is coming out this spring,
an essay will shortly appear in a
prestigious symposium The
Library of Living Philosophers,
two articles have been accepted in
scholarly journals and there have
been four or five book reviews
all of this done within the last
year and a half.
'Scholarly Attainment'
Not only his colleagues in
religious studies at Stanford, but
eminent outside referees, have
testified to the scholarly
attainment of the main materials.
As his friends know, within the
last four years Irish and his wife
have lost two sons, which might in
some quarters have been
considered a significant reason for
not having much literary
production during that period.
But the publication is too little
and too late.
The only message I can draw
out of the University's decision is
that superior teaching really does not
count here. What counts is literary
production, and any slightest
presumed deficiency in the latter
area negates superior performance

in the former area.
If I were junior member of the
Stanford faculty, hoping some
day to attain tenure, the word
that would come through to me
loud and clear would be: "Do not
invest yourself in students. Do not
concentrate on excellence in the
classroom. Lock that office door
and write. Otherwise, you have no
future at Stanford."
Setting Goals
Stanford is in process of setting
its goals for the future. I had
hoped that those goals would
inspire new dedication on the part
of the various components of the

Stanford faculty. And I must
express the gravest concern that
Stanford has no place in its future
for professors of Irish's quality
and caliber. I am bitter over what
the University decision means for
him, and I am deeply disturbed
over what his loss means for the
University.
I hope that other members of
the University community who
feel as I do will voice their
concern, through letters to the
Daily and also through letters to
the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences (in whose office the
decision was made), the President

and the Chairman of the Board of
Trustees.
Such actions will not salvage a
future at Stanford for Irish, but
they might lead the University to
reconsider policies that eventuate
in the dropping of future
professors of h»s caliber. And they
might give Irish at least the ironic
satisfaction of knowing that many
people affirm his importance to
this institution, even if the few
people with power to keep him
here do not.
