# Imperialism Caused Crisis
## 
### Evaristo Garza 
Last Oct. 31, Atty. Gen.
William Saxbe publicly proposed a
number of solutions to the
"undocumented workers crises."
Two of those solutions were
(1) to increase the budget of the
Immigration and Naturalization
Service by 30 percent and to
increase the border patrol
personnel by 140 percent, and (2)
legislative action to help identify
the "illegal." Both solutions will
supposedly speed up the rounding
up of illegals and thus alleviate the
present U.S. economic crisis.
These two proposed solutions
are both erroneous and
irresponsible. They are erroneous
in that they seek to eliminate the
victim rather than the disease.
The cause of the present U.S.
and world economic crisis is
imperialism. Without these
economic and political practices
we would not be facing the so
called "undocumented workers
crisis."
These proposed solutions are
irresponsible in the context of the
national economic front. Instead
of suggesting fiscal responsibility
by creating jobs that will help ease
the present unemployment crisis,
they suggest fiscal irresponsibility
by increasing unproductive
expenditures.
The plea for enacting
legislation to reduce the number
of illegals undoubtedly refers to
the so-called Rodino Bill. This bill
if enacted will turn employers

into federal law enforcement
agents legal gestapo.
It will legalize repression
against Chicanos and other ethnic
minorities.
We believe that Saxbe's
statements and proposals are
simplistic as well as deceptive.
Historically, Mexicans and
other third world groups have
been encouraged to immigrate
the U.S. during periods of
economic prosperity e.g., the
(Bracero Program and
immigration of Filipinos) and
forcibly removed during economic
crisis.
The Chinese, imported as a
cheap source of labor, were the
first victims of "alien hysteria"
after their usefulness as laborers
had ended. Blame for economic
ills and subsequent deportation of
Mexicans characterized the
depression of the 1930s and later
the recession of the 19505.
Today we are witnessing the
reapplication of these tactics for
the dual purpose of diverting
attention from factors which
caused the economic crisis and
provoking the hysteria necessary
to permit the legalization of
repressive measures against the
Mejicano-Chicano and other
ethnic minorities.
The current period of ethnic
indictment for economic woes is a
result of the recurrance of
periodic economic cycles inherent
in the capitalist system. Need for

immigration and subsequent
deportations are manifestations of
a changing labor market. These
changes in the labor market are
determined by the expansive and
contractive nature of the U.S.
economy. Records of
deportations support this
assertion by their correlations
with the economic conditions of
their respective years.
In the four year period
beginning in 1930, there were
four times as many deportations
as in the equal period beginning in
1924. The period of economic
expansion produced by World War
II caused a decline in deportations
to less than half of those in the
1930-33 period. The recession of
the early 1950s saw an
astronomical increase in
deportations reaching 1.2 million
in 1954 alone.
Perhaps, instead of making a
scapegoat of a sector of the
working class, the solution is the
abolition of capitalism through
the democratization of the
economy, that is, through
socializing the ownership of the
means of production. This would
require the unification of the
working class, and force it to lead
the struggle to change the
imperialistic practices of the
countries controlling today's
world.
