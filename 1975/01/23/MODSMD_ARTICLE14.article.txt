Cyclists And Rapists
Editor:
I was recently apprehended in
Palo Alto by an Officer of the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department and issued a citation
for alleged failure to stop for a
stop sign on the Stanford campus.
What makes this case interesting is
that I was apprehended under
somewhat arbitrary and unusual
circumstances approximately one
and one half miles from the scene
of the alleged violation. What
makes this even more interesting
is that I was riding a bicycle.
Being unsophisticated in
matters of law, I presume my best
course is to pay the fine, which in
this case amounts to one-half the
purchase price of my bicycle.
(The Motor Vehicle Code does
not discriminate between
automobiles and bicycles
regarding punishment for
infractions.)
The Tieal displayed by the
police must be commended. It is
this dogged determination in
attempting to bring wrongdoers to
justice which marks these
guardians of the people. The
warning for the unwary bicyclist
is obvious. The lesson for a
murderer or rapist is just as clear.

Irish And Tenure
Editor:
Concerned students should be
disillusioned to learn that Jerry
Irish, assistant professor of
religious studies, was denied
tenure this week. For those of us
who have had the privilege if
studying with him, this action
constitutes an appalling example
of insensitivity and poor
judgement on the part of
University officials.
Moreover, it casts serious
doubt- upon the viability of the
tenuring process and the criteria
by which these decisions are
made. One can only mourn the
loss of one of the University's
most promising and capable
teachers acknowledging,
ultimately, that Stanford students
will be paying the price.

More On SWOPSI, SCIRE
Editor:
I am deeply disappointed by
Dean Gibbs' recommendation to
eliminate SWOPSI and SCIRE. I
cannot forsee the important
functions they perform ever being
absorbed into other departments,
while preserving their powerful
enthusiasm and directive force.
The loss of the unique educational
experiences SWOPSI and SCIRE
represent, surely cannot be
justified by budget cuts of such
minimal amounts.

SCIRE has been a particular
help to me in establishing Edge,
which will start publishing this
quarter. SCIRE was the only
organization or department that
would even begin to talk to me
because we were starting from
scratch. Our magazine would be
far from a reality if it wasn't for
SCIRE, and we are deeply
indebted to Alice Supton for her
support and expert guidance.
The death of SWOPSI and
SCIRE not only means the loss of
unstilted innovative education,
but also a loss of student output
that has been one of the few
visible products of the Stanford
community. I urge the
administration to fully consider
the immense value of SWOPSI and
SCIRE before it takes any rash
action, something it seems to have
neglected so far.
A man who finds he has less to
eat, does not cut off an arm to
conserve his energy, but finds it
more reasonable to grow thinner.
This University does need to grow
thinner, but it can hardly afford
to cripple itself.
