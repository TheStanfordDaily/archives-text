What happened to the cheerleaders? And what
happened to the rest of the $llOO they got from
the Athletic Department? —L. W.
The era of the cheerleaders is over, according to
the group's organizer Jane Ivy. They decided at the
e nd of last quarter not to cheer at basketball or
I baseball games as originally planned, she said.
"As a group we decided that we had gotten a
mixed reaction and it seemed that the negative part
of the reaction was much stronger than the
positive," Ivy said. "We decided that Stanford
didn't want or need cheerleaders."
Squad member Toni Allen put it more simply.
I "Why did we quit?" she asked. "We got smart!"
Allen recalled the USC game, where a full beer
can hurled by a disgruntled fan went sailing by her
head. "You'd be surprised how mean people are,"
she said. "It turned out to be that I dreaded
Saturdays."
Why were the cheerleaders such a colossal failure
k at Stanford? Arlene Womack thinks that their
uniforms were part of the problem: "One band
member told me that our uniforms looked like JV
uniforms next to the Dollies." Allen had a different
explanation "Stanford students just don't like to
be told what to do."
Interestingly enough, "Bug Me" readers are
learning about the cheerleaders' decision before the
' Athletic Department. They want to go tell the
department as a group and haven't managed to get
together yet. Therefore, some of the $llOO still
remains enough to send all eight of them to Los

Angeles for the two basketball games there.
All the cheerleaders seemed disappointed but
relieved that their ordeal was finally over. "I come
from a very, very small town and people chipped in
money to send me back to the Penn State game,"
Allen said wistfully. "People chipped in $2O each."
"I told my parents and all my friends," Womack

remembered. "Evieryone was behind us at the
beginning."
But unpleasant memories of being booed by
80,000 fans are apparently fading slowly. "Ten to
20 years from now, maybe I'll look back at it and
say it wasn't too bad," Allen mused. "Two months
later, I say it was bad."
