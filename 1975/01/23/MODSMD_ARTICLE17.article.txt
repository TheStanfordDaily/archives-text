# Group Fights Incest, Heals Family Wounds
## 
### KAREN LACHENAUER Last of Two Parts 
Tom spent nine months on work
furlough as a gas station attendant.
Currently a mechanic, he's trying to
regain a white collar job, but he can't
explain away four counts of incest and
one count of lewd and lacivious
conduct.

Nor does he try. He tells
interviewers the nature of his felony.
"They take a few deep breaths and
assure me, 'Oh, that's not important,'
but later they phone to say I'm
overqualified. It seems really doubtful
that I'll get into anything more
substantial."
The Child Sexual Abuse Program
has succeeded in getting the normal
three year sentences reduced to one,
or nine months with good behavior.
On probation, men are able to return
to their families unheard of in 1971,
says Giarretto. "The judicial system
has had to adjust to some things all its
logic can't explain, like couples
wanting to remain together," notes
administrator Dorothy Ross. "Judges
are beginning to see incest as a family
difficulty, not a maniac's doing."
Tom speaks for his confederates
when he says, "What I got out of
Parents United was a lot of
self-respect. I think a lot of myself
now: I'm self-sufficient, I know what I
want. I did something really [terrible]
but it's okay and I can handle it now."
But there's a third party, as integral
to the action as the principals but
usually the last to know. Almost by
definition, incest implies hostility
toward the mother, Giarretto observes.
The pain of finding incest in their
homes overwhelms women, he says.
Some despair, some get mad at a
daughter, but they've gotten as much
out of the weekly meetings as their

mates. Even those separated or
divorced joined their husbands at meetings.
If women look deeply into
themselves, says jovial, maternal
Hannah, they'll find they're as much
to "blame" as anyone.
"Before this happened, I couldn't
care less if I slept with my husband,"
Hannah declares.
Why did better than half of Parents
United's wives stay with their
husbands?
Hannah: "If this had happened to
me, I'd want my husband to stick by
me.
Lyn; "The marriage vows say 'for
better or ...' There could have been
alcohol or drugs. It hurts, but after a
while, it begins to seem like any
problem that you can make go away."
John's wife, Shirley: "Immediately,
we became closer. I realized I mustn't
have been giving him something and
we started to talk like never before.
Why did I stay with him? Because I
love the guy."
Tom's wife Joan will never go back
to him. They learned their family trial
was only a sign of an inevitable drift.
But John and Shirley will reweave
the old bond. They sit together at the
first meeting of a new year. Their
daughter has come, too, expecting a
girls' meeting. She has been
disappointed her group won't
reconvene for a week so she and her
younger brother zoom around.
At meeting's end, Shirley takes
Kathi's hand. "Come on, hon, we
gotta get you back to the ranch on
time," she reminds her. Kathi will
leave the ranch in a month. She
expects everything will be "a-okay" at
home by then and that shell stay
there. Mother and brother are
escorting Kathi to her temporary
residence tonight. They leave, the two
kids punching each other and giggling.

Tom spent nine months on work
furlough as a gas station attendant.
Currently a mechanic, he's trying to
regain a white collar job, but he can't
explain away four counts of incest and
one count of lewd and lacivious
conduct.

Nor does he try. He tells
interviewers the nature of his felony.
"They take a few deep breaths and
assure me, 'Oh, that's not important,'
but later they phone to say I'm
overqualified. It seems really doubtful
that I'll get into anything more
substantial."
The Child Sexual Abuse Program
has succeeded in getting the normal
three year sentences reduced to one,
or nine months with good behavior.
On probation, men are able to return
to their families unheard of in 1971,
says Giarretto. "The judicial system
has had to adjust to some things all its
logic can't explain, like couples
wanting to remain together," notes
administrator Dorothy Ross. "Judges
are beginning to see incest as a family
difficulty, not a maniac's doing."
Tom speaks for his confederates
when he says, "What I got out of
Parents United was a lot of
self-respect. I think a lot of myself
now: I'm self-sufficient, I know what I
want. I did something really [terrible]
but it's okay and I can handle it now."
But there's a third party, as integral
to the action as the principals but
usually the last to know. Almost by
definition, incest implies hostility
toward the mother, Giarretto observes.
The pain of finding incest in their
homes overwhelms women, he says.
Some despair, some get mad at a
daughter, but they've gotten as much
out of the weekly meetings as their

mates. Even those separated or
divorced joined their husbands at meetings.
If women look deeply into
themselves, says jovial, maternal
Hannah, they'll find they're as much
to "blame" as anyone.
"Before this happened, I couldn't
care less if I slept with my husband,"
Hannah declares.
Why did better than half of Parents
United's wives stay with their
husbands?
Hannah: "If this had happened to
me, I'd want my husband to stick by
me.
Lyn; "The marriage vows say 'for
better or ...' There could have been
alcohol or drugs. It hurts, but after a
while, it begins to seem like any
problem that you can make go away."
John's wife, Shirley: "Immediately,
we became closer. I realized I mustn't
have been giving him something and
we started to talk like never before.
Why did I stay with him? Because I
love the guy."
Tom's wife Joan will never go back
to him. They learned their family trial
was only a sign of an inevitable drift.
But John and Shirley will reweave
the old bond. They sit together at the
first meeting of a new year. Their
daughter has come, too, expecting a
girls' meeting. She has been
disappointed her group won't
reconvene for a week so she and her
younger brother zoom around.
At meeting's end, Shirley takes
Kathi's hand. "Come on, hon, we
gotta get you back to the ranch on
time," she reminds her. Kathi will
leave the ranch in a month. She
expects everything will be "a-okay" at
home by then and that shell stay
there. Mother and brother are
escorting Kathi to her temporary
residence tonight. They leave, the two
kids punching each other and giggling.
