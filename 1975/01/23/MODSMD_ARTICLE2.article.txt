# No Big Changes To Affect College Terrace Traffic
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
Only one change lies in the
immediate future for College Terrace
traffic patterns, despite suggestions
that several existing traffic barriers in
the area be removed or relocated.
In its regular meeting last week, the
Palo Alto City Council rejected a City
Planning Department proposal to
make extensive modifications in traffic
patterns between Stanford and
California Avenues west of El Camino
Real.
The only approved change was a
relocation of the concrete traffic
barrier on Bowdoin Street closer to
Stanford Avenue.
Some area residents attending the

meeting urged the Council to retain
the existing barricade setup, first
established last year. Calling changes in
the present pattern "futile," one
resident likened groping for adequate
solutions to "playing checkers."
Mayor Byron Sher agreed.
"There's no perfect solution to that
problem," Sher said yesterday. "But
this is probably the best one under the
circumstances."
Council member Enid Pearson felt
the present plan would be equitable in
the long run, but sympathized with
those residents of the Terrace who
objected.
"I went through the same thing
when they put barriers in our area,"
she said. "Traffic on our street
increased 25 percent. I've been taking
my share and I've hated it," Pearson
said, but added that "people will settle
down eventually, once they get used
to it."
Most of those opposing the present
arrangements (Plan Y) and supporting
the Planning Department's proposal
(Plan Z) are from parts of the
community closer to El Camino Real.
This part of the neighborhood has
experienced a rising volume of traffic
because of Plan Y's "spreading" effect,
residents complained.
