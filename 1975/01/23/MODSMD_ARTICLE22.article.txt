Ford To Order Higher Oil Tariffs
WASHINGTON - In a direct challenge to Congress,
President Ford declared last night that he will sign a
proclamation today ordering higher tariffs on imported oil
in an effort to reduce the nation's oil consumption.
Earlier, Chairman A1 Ullman (D-Ore.) of the House Ways
and Means Committee predicted that Congress will
overwhelmingly pass legislation to prevent the President's
action for at least 90 days.
Ullman said Ford had turned down a direct appeal to
voluntarily delay the oil import tariffs. They are scheduled
to go into effect on Feb. 1 and, according to administration
officials, will drive up prices of gasoline and home heating
oil by several cents a gallon.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, who
indicated in testimony yesterday that the Ford
administration believes permanent changes in individual
income tax rates can be justified independently of the
energy tax proposal, later said he did not mean that.
Ford's tax package proposes increasing energy costs by
about $3O billion, with the money to be refunded to the
economy in various ways, including a permanent
$16.5-billion reduction in income taxes.
Simon said his position was that taxes could not be cut
without offsetting higher energy taxes. He told the
committee the tax reductions would more than offset the
higher energy costs for persons with yearly incomes of
$15,000 or less.
"The President made the decision, which is a correct
decision, not to move the route of more government,
rationing and allocation, which would be an absolute
nightmare for the American people," he told reporters.
Meantime, five of the six New England governors
decided Wednesday to seek a federal court order to block
Ford's tariff action. Some of the governors were scheduled
to meet with Ford today to press their view that tariffs will
cause particular hardships in their regions because oil is
used extensively for home heating.
Railroads Negotiate New Labor Pacts
WASHINGTON The nation's railroads and three
unions have reached tentative agreement on new contracts
boosting wages and benefits 40 percent over three years,
union sources said yesterday.
Negotiations continued, meanwhile, with the Sheet
Metal Workers union in an effort to avert strikes threatened
tomorrow against the Union Pacific railroad and four other
major carriers.
The initial contract agreements may eventually set the
wage pattern for all 17 unions involved in the bargaining
and could also have some impact on the sheet metal talks,
which involve separate issues. The 17 unions represent
about 560,000 railroad workers nationwide.
Swiss Announce Monetary Moves
BERN, Switzerland Swiss authorities, in a move to

protect Swiss export business and tourism, raised to 40
percent yesterday the annual penalty charge on new foreign
deposits in Switzerland.
The Swiss National Bank also announced that payment
of interest will Tase immediately on all foreign-controlled
Swiss franc fur!s exceeding $20,000, no matter when
deposited.
The action was taken to calm a rush for Swiss francs.
The demand for francs threatened to drive up their value
and make Swiss products too expensive to sell abroad.
The national bank announced the measures after the
dollar sank to a record low of 2.48 francs. Holders of
dollars and other foreign currencies had converted their
money to francs in anticipation of an increase in value or
desire for the security they felt the franc offered.
Jackson May Announce Candidacy
WASHINGTON Sen. Henry M. Jackson will probably
announce his candidacy for president on Feb. 6, a
spokesman for the senator said yesterday.
The spokesman said Jackson (D-Wash.) "has blocked
out" television time on that date. '
The senator is understood to have purchased five
minutes of time on CBS-TV for Feb. 6 to make his
announcement. Jackson would become the fourth
announced candidate for the Democratic nomination,
following Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona, former Sen. Fred
Harris of Oklahoma, and former Gov. Jimmie Carter of
Georgia.

Ford To Order Higher Oil Tariffs
WASHINGTON - In a direct challenge to Congress,
President Ford declared last night that he will sign a
proclamation today ordering higher tariffs on imported oil
in an effort to reduce the nation's oil consumption.
Earlier, Chairman A1 Ullman (D-Ore.) of the House Ways
and Means Committee predicted that Congress will
overwhelmingly pass legislation to prevent the President's
action for at least 90 days.
Ullman said Ford had turned down a direct appeal to
voluntarily delay the oil import tariffs. They are scheduled
to go into effect on Feb. 1 and, according to administration
officials, will drive up prices of gasoline and home heating
oil by several cents a gallon.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, who
indicated in testimony yesterday that the Ford
administration believes permanent changes in individual
income tax rates can be justified independently of the
energy tax proposal, later said he did not mean that.
Ford's tax package proposes increasing energy costs by
about $3O billion, with the money to be refunded to the
economy in various ways, including a permanent
$16.5-billion reduction in income taxes.
Simon said his position was that taxes could not be cut
without offsetting higher energy taxes. He told the
committee the tax reductions would more than offset the
higher energy costs for persons with yearly incomes of
$15,000 or less.
"The President made the decision, which is a correct
decision, not to move the route of more government,
rationing and allocation, which would be an absolute
nightmare for the American people," he told reporters.
Meantime, five of the six New England governors
decided Wednesday to seek a federal court order to block
Ford's tariff action. Some of the governors were scheduled
to meet with Ford today to press their view that tariffs will
cause particular hardships in their regions because oil is
used extensively for home heating.
Railroads Negotiate New Labor Pacts
WASHINGTON The nation's railroads and three
unions have reached tentative agreement on new contracts
boosting wages and benefits 40 percent over three years,
union sources said yesterday.
Negotiations continued, meanwhile, with the Sheet
Metal Workers union in an effort to avert strikes threatened
tomorrow against the Union Pacific railroad and four other
major carriers.
The initial contract agreements may eventually set the
wage pattern for all 17 unions involved in the bargaining
and could also have some impact on the sheet metal talks,
which involve separate issues. The 17 unions represent
about 560,000 railroad workers nationwide.
Swiss Announce Monetary Moves
BERN, Switzerland Swiss authorities, in a move to

protect Swiss export business and tourism, raised to 40
percent yesterday the annual penalty charge on new foreign
deposits in Switzerland.
The Swiss National Bank also announced that payment
of interest will Tase immediately on all foreign-controlled
Swiss franc fur!s exceeding $20,000, no matter when
deposited.
The action was taken to calm a rush for Swiss francs.
The demand for francs threatened to drive up their value
and make Swiss products too expensive to sell abroad.
The national bank announced the measures after the
dollar sank to a record low of 2.48 francs. Holders of
dollars and other foreign currencies had converted their
money to francs in anticipation of an increase in value or
desire for the security they felt the franc offered.
