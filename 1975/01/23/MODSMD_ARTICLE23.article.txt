Ford Congratulates Panofsky
President Gerald R. Ford early this
month sent a letter of congratulations
to Wolfgang Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
for the joint discovery of a new
sub-atomic particle here and at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory in
November.
In the letter, a response to an
explanatory letter sent to the
President by Panofsky, Ford said "It
continues to be my hope that
important advances in basic knowledge
of this type may lead to a better
scientific understanding that
ultimately benefits all mankind."
Ford called the discovery a "highly
technical achievement" and expressed
confidence that "new experiments
dealing with these discoveries will be
attacked with vigor, enthusiasm and
excitement."
