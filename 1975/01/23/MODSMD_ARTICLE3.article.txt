# ASSU Senate Advises Saving SWOPSI, SCIRE
## 
### DAN PYNE PATRICIA CLAPPISON 
The ASSU Senate voted
unanimously last night to recommend
that the University retain SWOPSI and
SCIRE as independent programs, but
admitted in a report that budget cuts
within the programs will be necessary.
The recommendation was part of a
five-page study by the Committee on
Budget Priorities which concluded
"these programs are so valuable and
cost-effective, any substantial change
in their organization would not serve
either the students' needs or the
University's."
ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton, who
submitted the report to the Senate,
explained that SWOPSI and SCIRE
will lose their innovative nature if they
are incorporated into already existing
departments.
ASSU Sen. Maria Echaveste
supported the conclusion of the
report, and said, "perhaps budget cuts
are being made as an excuse to do
away with valuable but controversial
programs which tend to embarrass the
Administration."
The Report also proposed that
"Urban Studies, in its entirety,
becomes a part of a department," and
"that the Undergraduate Writing
Program becomes a part of the English
Department."

In what one senator called an
unusually short meeting, the Senate
also voted to urge the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
to reject the recent proposal to
institute course drop deadlines and to
record "no credit" marks on student
transcripts.
. The Senate also recommended
"that the Administration investigate
alternative tuition structures."
Symposium Sponsored
After some debate, the Senate
decided to co-sponsor the Women in
Politics Symposium, making an
appropriation of $lOO to the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. Other sponsors are

the Committee for Research On
Women and the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
The allocation of this money to the
Speakers Bureau increases the
possibility of bringing U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations
John Scali to speak here in the spring.
Andrew Leuchter, chairman of the
Speakers Bureau, explained that
according to current estimates, the
Bureau will overshoot its budget if
Scali appears. The additional funds
will enable his organization to pay
Scali and still co-sponsor the Women
in Politics Seminar.
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri mentioned that some students
have come to the ASSU office with
parking tickets they wanted paid. He
stressed that the fund set aside last
week for "parking fees" was
designated to be used to help students
fighting parking tickets meet legal
costs.
In a subsequent discussion of the
parking issue Sen. Tom "Tuna" Price
suggested that ASSU print parking
stickers identical to present permits,
and distribute them to students at no
charge.
Price said he could not foresee any
legal repercussions, and said that
officials would have "a hell of a time
telling which stickers are the real
ones." His proposal was tabled until
the result of the probable legal action
is known.

alternative tuition structures."
Symposium Sponsored
After some debate, the Senate
decided to co-sponsor the Women in
Politics Symposium, making an
appropriation of $lOO to the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. Other sponsors are

the Committee for Research On
Women and the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
The allocation of this money to the
Speakers Bureau increases the
possibility of bringing U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations
John Scali to speak here in the spring.
Andrew Leuchter, chairman of the
Speakers Bureau, explained that
according to current estimates, the
Bureau will overshoot its budget if
Scali appears. The additional funds
will enable his organization to pay
Scali and still co-sponsor the Women
in Politics Seminar.
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri mentioned that some students
have come to the ASSU office with
parking tickets they wanted paid. He
stressed that the fund set aside last
week for "parking fees" was
designated to be used to help students
fighting parking tickets meet legal
costs.
In a subsequent discussion of the
parking issue Sen. Tom "Tuna" Price
suggested that ASSU print parking
stickers identical to present permits,
and distribute them to students at no
charge.
Price said he could not foresee any
legal repercussions, and said that
officials would have "a hell of a time
telling which stickers are the real
ones." His proposal was tabled until
the result of the probable legal action
is known.
The ASSU Senate voted
unanimously last night to recommend
that the University retain SWOPSI and
SCIRE as independent programs, but
admitted in a report that budget cuts
within the programs will be necessary.
The recommendation was part of a
five-page study by the Committee on
Budget Priorities which concluded
"these programs are so valuable and
cost-effective, any substantial change
in their organization would not serve
either the students' needs or the
University's."
ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton, who
submitted the report to the Senate,
explained that SWOPSI and SCIRE
will lose their innovative nature if they
are incorporated into already existing
departments.
ASSU Sen. Maria Echaveste
supported the conclusion of the
report, and said, "perhaps budget cuts
are being made as an excuse to do
away with valuable but controversial
programs which tend to embarrass the
Administration."
The Report also proposed that
"Urban Studies, in its entirety,
becomes a part of a department," and
"that the Undergraduate Writing
Program becomes a part of the English
Department."

In what one senator called an
unusually short meeting, the Senate
also voted to urge the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
to reject the recent proposal to
institute course drop deadlines and to
record "no credit" marks on student
transcripts.
. The Senate also recommended
"that the Administration investigate
alternative tuition structures."
