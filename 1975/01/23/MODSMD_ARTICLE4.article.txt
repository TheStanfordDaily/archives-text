# 'Santa' Gives Tickets Too
## 
### 
Someone identifying himself as
"Santa" yesterday presented the Daily
with 36 parking tickets dated Jan. 22,
1975.
The tickets, calling for $2 fines,
were placed on cars parked in the
Crothers Memorial lot near Escondido
Road between 11:45 a.m. and 2:05
p.m.
The tickets were inadvertently
discovered in a manila envelope on a
desk in the Daily business office. The
envelope was addressed: "To the
editor: Ho! Ho! Ho!" Inside the
envelope were the 36 tickets and a

note which read: "President Lyman-
Let's have some action taken on the
parking ticket question. Signed,
Santa."
It appears likely that the tickets
were removed from the vehicles
without knowledge or consent of the
owners. Last night the Daily returned
the tickets to the police.
Sgt. Anthony Navarra indicated
that if the stolen tickets had never
been discovered or returned, the
individuals who were ticketed would
have been subject to warrants of arrest
after 11 days.
Yesterday was the first day campus
police issued citations to student
vehicles not displaying 1975 parking
stickers. The deadline for purchasing
the controversial $7.50 stickers was
Monday.
Navarra said that police will
continue ticketing on orders from
Director of Police Services Marvin
Herrington. Herrington predicted
Tuesday that "we'll get to everyone in
about a week."
