# Verbal SAT Scores Decline

### RICHARD FEARON 
The "television revolution" has
produced many college students who
are not "reading types," according to
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon.
He points to declining verbal
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores
to back his statement.
Data recently published show that
the number of high school graduates
scoring 700 or more on the SAT verbal
section dropped from 32,800 to
16,200 between 1966-67 and 1973-74.
, The number of those achieving 600
or more dropped from 168,000 to
134,000.
Less Reading
Hargadon attributed much of the
decline to a lessened reliance on
reading by the incoming generation of
college students.
"This is the generation of students
affected most by the media
revolution," he noted. "Many of our
students are 'viewing and listening' as
contrasted with 'reading' types.
"What students read outside of
class and apart from class assignments
does not seem to be terribly
impressive. Perhaps they quite
realistically have less reason to gain
vicariously what they can more readily
experience than could their
predecessors."
Influence Of Television
Robert Cameron, regional director
of the College Entrance Examination
Board, the branch of the Educational
Testing Service that supervises SAT

and achievement tests, voiced similar
speculations.
''The influence of
telecommunications on learning style
and also on delivery is immense.
Television is a major influence on
verbal skills ... exercising a greater
influence on speaking [than on]
writing skills," Cameron said.
He also noted that the entire
approach to teaching language skills
has been altered in the past 10 years to
place less reliance on such abilities. 1
Cameron pointed out that the mean
SAT figures for 1972-73 and 1973-74
were the same, possibly indicating a
bottoming out of the decline in scores.
And he added that "means for the
achievement tests are up."
More Minority Students
Cameron feels the SAT is "a
measure of aptitude regardless of any
curriculum or mode of preparation.
They measure abilities developed over
a student's entire educational
background ... [their] validity has
not diminished."
Reasons for the decline in scores
may partly be due to the changing test
population, he explained.
"There has been a rapid increase in
the number of minority student? who
have taken the test. Their cultural
background and language is different,"
Cameron remarked.
Correspondingly, "there has been a
decline in the number of white
middle-class students taking the SAT.
This radically can affect the mean

scores."
The student's outlook is another
factor influencing the tests, Cameron
added.
"Student attitude about the tests
has changed. In an open atmosphere,
students are more relaxed about the
