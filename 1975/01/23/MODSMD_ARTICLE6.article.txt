# Architects Offer Sketches Of Unique Row Houses
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Finalized preliminary drawings of three unique
houses, designed to complete the Mayfield Row, were
submitted to the Student Advisory Committee on Row
Houses yesterday.
Although the Committee approved the drawings of
the actual buildings in the $3.6 million project, bicycle
and automobile parking still remain controversial
subjects.
Unless the Committee hears any major objections to
the plans from students at an open meeting tonight at 7
in Lathrop Lounge or from University administrators,
the architects will begin more detailed drawings next
week, Senior University Planner Robert Nerrie
explained.
The Committee will submit the preliminary schematic
sketches to the Board of Trustees in March so the houses

can be erected before the suggested completion date,
September 1975.
Sketches for the project depict the houses' facades,
placement on the site and individual floor plans.
John Field, from the San Francisco architecture firm
of Bull, Field, Volkmann and Stockwell which is
designing the project, characterized the first house (on
the right in the picture below) as a "flowing variety of
spaces."
Most of the first floor communal rooms open on to
one another, producing the "flowing" effect. The plans
for this house call for a lounge with a fireplace tucked
behind an open central staircase.
The V-shaped house cradles a pine tree which towers
above the house's three stories. The front facade of the
house does not readily blend into the landscape, some
members criticized. They described the front as austere

and modernistic.
The rectangular second house focuses on a central
well as its dominant element. Former opponents of the
well conceded yesterday that the open space would not
initiate noise which could disturb the residents. The
three floors in this house open onto the well at split
intervals.
Director of University Housing Ed Scoles described
the split-level area as "one of the most exciting spaces in
the whole project."
Plans of the house provide for a sundeck on the third
level and a group of rooms on the ground floor which
can be converted into a faculty suite.
The third house, more spread out than the other two,
is designed with wings shooting off in both directions
from a central lobby.
Different architects from the firm separately designed

each of the houses in order to preserve the individuality
of each design. However, the lack of continuity among
the three houses troubled some members of the
University's Land and Buildings Committee when the
plans were presented to them last week.
Members of both the University and Student
Advisory Committees objected to the parking plan.
Some thought there should be one major parking lot
near the third house with a single-road access from
Campus Drive.
Others preferred a smaller main lot near the third
house with an additional parking area behind the first
house.
The amount of space to be allotted to bicycle storage
has also yet to be decided. However, the Student
Advisory Committee plans to conduct a survey soon on
how many students actually use bikes.

intervals.
Director of University Housing Ed Scoles described
the split-level area as "one of the most exciting spaces in
the whole project."
Plans of the house provide for a sundeck on the third
level and a group of rooms on the ground floor which
can be converted into a faculty suite.
The third house, more spread out than the other two,
is designed with wings shooting off in both directions
from a central lobby.
Different architects from the firm separately designed

each of the houses in order to preserve the individuality
of each design. However, the lack of continuity among
the three houses troubled some members of the
University's Land and Buildings Committee when the
plans were presented to them last week.
Members of both the University and Student
Advisory Committees objected to the parking plan.
Some thought there should be one major parking lot
near the third house with a single-road access from
Campus Drive.
Others preferred a smaller main lot near the third
house with an additional parking area behind the first
house.
The amount of space to be allotted to bicycle storage
has also yet to be decided. However, the Student
Advisory Committee plans to conduct a survey soon on
how many students actually use bikes.

Finalized preliminary drawings of three unique
houses, designed to complete the Mayfield Row, were
submitted to the Student Advisory Committee on Row
Houses yesterday.
Although the Committee approved the drawings of
the actual buildings in the $3.6 million project, bicycle
and automobile parking still remain controversial
subjects.
Unless the Committee hears any major objections to
the plans from students at an open meeting tonight at 7
in Lathrop Lounge or from University administrators,
the architects will begin more detailed drawings next
week, Senior University Planner Robert Nerrie
explained.
The Committee will submit the preliminary schematic
sketches to the Board of Trustees in March so the houses

can be erected before the suggested completion date,
September 1975.
Sketches for the project depict the houses' facades,
placement on the site and individual floor plans.
John Field, from the San Francisco architecture firm
of Bull, Field, Volkmann and Stockwell which is
designing the project, characterized the first house (on
the right in the picture below) as a "flowing variety of
spaces."
Most of the first floor communal rooms open on to
one another, producing the "flowing" effect. The plans
for this house call for a lounge with a fireplace tucked
behind an open central staircase.
The V-shaped house cradles a pine tree which towers
above the house's three stories. The front facade of the
house does not readily blend into the landscape, some
members criticized. They described the front as austere

and modernistic.
The rectangular second house focuses on a central
well as its dominant element. Former opponents of the
well conceded yesterday that the open space would not
initiate noise which could disturb the residents. The
three floors in this house open onto the well at split
intervals.
