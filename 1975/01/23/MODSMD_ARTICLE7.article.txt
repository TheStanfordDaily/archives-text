## Housing Change 
### 
Larry Horton's Housing Office has finally formulated a
housing proposal which allows every undergraduate equal
access to on-campus housing.
All entering freshmen will be guaranteed on-campus
housing for three years, and all entering freshmen, even
future fraternity members, will be subject to the possibility
of living off campus for one year, under the proposal.
This proposal also assures all transfers, a group currently
unduly persecuted, housing during their first year here.
We support the basic concepts of this proposal. However,
if the Univeristy decides to accept this plan (which seems
inevitable since a major decision maker, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, has already termed the plan
"magnificent"), we would like to make some suggestions
before the draft is finalized.
Primarily, we think the proposal unnecessarily forces
students to choose the year their chances for living on
campus will be greatly reduced. We do not consider this
"predictability" a benefit, but a detriment.
Why should a student have to decide in his or her early
years here where and with whom he or she will live two or
three years later? The Stanford experience allows flexibility
in one's academic career; why not in one's social career?
Besides, allowing students to enter the draw for
remaining spaces during their off year destroys the idea of
predictability.
We suggest that the draw system remain the same, but
that students who live off campus one year have first
priority to on-campus spaces. Under this method, the longer
a person stays on campus, the less chance he or she has of
remaining on campus during the subsequent draws.
If a student finds the suspense unendurable he or she
could live a year off campus and be assured high priority his
or her remaining years here.
We also support the idea that fraternities should bear part
of the housing shortage burden. According to the proposal,
all-male fraternities will have to fulfill a quota to
accomodate part of the demand for housing. This quota will
force fraternities to crowd their houses o s r establish annexes
off campus for the extra students.
However, we disapprove of forcing an individual house to
fulfill its quota within two years to avoid entering the draw.
This provision puts an unnecessary burden on weak
fraternities; fulfilling the quota should be left up to the
fraternity system as a whole.
If this plan is actually implemented, greater consideration
should be given to the needs of students living off-campus.
Both transportation and communication between
surrounding areas and the campus should be improved. Such
additions as Dial-A-Ride, or a similar service, should be
explored.
High school students applying for admission should be
informed that on-campus housing can only be guaranteed
for three of four years. The idea of warning transfer
applicants what to expect is a step in the right direction.
This proposal has a number of weak points, not the least
of which is that women are still discriminated against in an
abstract sense. This is doubly important, because if not for
the anti-sex discrimination provisions of Title IX, the entire
issue might not have arisen.
Women in fraternities cannot choose to live in a crowded
house as this proposal allows men to do. However, we realize
that proposal cannot please everyone.
This one seems to be about the best we can hope for.

could live a year off campus and be assured high priority his
or her remaining years here.
We also support the idea that fraternities should bear part
of the housing shortage burden. According to the proposal,
all-male fraternities will have to fulfill a quota to
accomodate part of the demand for housing. This quota will
force fraternities to crowd their houses o s r establish annexes
off campus for the extra students.
However, we disapprove of forcing an individual house to
fulfill its quota within two years to avoid entering the draw.
This provision puts an unnecessary burden on weak
fraternities; fulfilling the quota should be left up to the
fraternity system as a whole.
If this plan is actually implemented, greater consideration
should be given to the needs of students living off-campus.
Both transportation and communication between
surrounding areas and the campus should be improved. Such
additions as Dial-A-Ride, or a similar service, should be
explored.
High school students applying for admission should be
informed that on-campus housing can only be guaranteed
for three of four years. The idea of warning transfer
applicants what to expect is a step in the right direction.
This proposal has a number of weak points, not the least
of which is that women are still discriminated against in an
abstract sense. This is doubly important, because if not for
the anti-sex discrimination provisions of Title IX, the entire
issue might not have arisen.
Women in fraternities cannot choose to live in a crowded
house as this proposal allows men to do. However, we realize
that proposal cannot please everyone.
This one seems to be about the best we can hope for.
Larry Horton's Housing Office has finally formulated a
housing proposal which allows every undergraduate equal
access to on-campus housing.
All entering freshmen will be guaranteed on-campus
housing for three years, and all entering freshmen, even
future fraternity members, will be subject to the possibility
of living off campus for one year, under the proposal.
This proposal also assures all transfers, a group currently
unduly persecuted, housing during their first year here.
We support the basic concepts of this proposal. However,
if the Univeristy decides to accept this plan (which seems
inevitable since a major decision maker, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, has already termed the plan
"magnificent"), we would like to make some suggestions
before the draft is finalized.
Primarily, we think the proposal unnecessarily forces
students to choose the year their chances for living on
campus will be greatly reduced. We do not consider this
"predictability" a benefit, but a detriment.
Why should a student have to decide in his or her early
years here where and with whom he or she will live two or
three years later? The Stanford experience allows flexibility
in one's academic career; why not in one's social career?
Besides, allowing students to enter the draw for
remaining spaces during their off year destroys the idea of
predictability.
We suggest that the draw system remain the same, but
that students who live off campus one year have first
priority to on-campus spaces. Under this method, the longer
a person stays on campus, the less chance he or she has of
remaining on campus during the subsequent draws.
If a student finds the suspense unendurable he or she
could live a year off campus and be assured high priority his
or her remaining years here.
