Agnekolor assures even, uniform processing without agita
tion. Laminar Flow process automatically keeps entire sur
face of color or other print material in constant contact
with each chemical solution. Chemicals can be replenished
and used over and over, reducing costs to a fraction of
that with other processors. Agnekolor is easy to use. Unit
fits into less than 2-foot space; no running water needed.
Works with all color processes so it won't become obsolete.
