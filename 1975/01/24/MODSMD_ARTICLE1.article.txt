# Cowell To Cut Budget By Almost 20 Percent
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Cowell Health Center will cut its costs by nearly 20 percent during the next
three years, but administrators hope to maintain services at their current level,
according to James B. McClenahan, director of the student health service.
Rather than curtail any segment of the' center's services, the University has
dismissed several Cowell employees and is leaving most new vacancies unfilled,
McClenahan said.
McClenahan emphasized that the Administration doesn't plan to finance
Cowell by charging students specialized service fees, although such a possibility
has been discussed.
Students currently pay no fees for Cowell's services, but pay an average of
$4O a quarter in tuition to finance the health service.
"Students seem to prefer the existing insurance-type system through which
they can receive medical treatment free of charge if they need it," McClenahan
said.
Costs Rise
Cowell's budget $1.4 million for 1975 will be trimmed 17 percent by
1978, but absolute cost expenses may actually rise due to inflation, McClenahan
noted. He said that Cowell has been cutting its costs ever since the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP) was introduced in 1969.

Cowell has already dismissed one
secretary, half of a doctor's service and
half of a psychiatrist's service.
Furthermore, some staff members are
now working only nine months a year.
During the next year, Cowell will
eliminate one and a half of eight and a
half remaining doctors through
attrition and will allow one nurse's and
two clerical workers' positions to
remain vacant.
McClenahan said Cowell is hiring
two nurse practitioners who can
perform minor medical tasks formerly
executed by doctors.
Nurse Practitioners
"Under a California statute that
became effective this month, medical
institutions are permitted to hire nurse
practitioners to take over the smaller
duties of doctors," McClenahan said,
adding that this practice is less
expensive than to hire doctors.
Costs are also being cut out in
many small ways, McClenahan
observed. For example, a few years
ago, Cowell purchased an X-ray
processing machine for $6OOO.
Consequently, Cowell was able to
dismiss the woman who previously had
processed X-rays by hand.
The Administration currently is
considering allowing non-students to
occupy at a cost extra beds in the
infirmary, McClenahan said.
Charging Students
McClenahan said that at one point,
the University considered charging
students for use of the infirmary
and/or for referral services to other
medical centers.
The University rejected the plan,
McClenahan explained, because "the
people in the infirmary and those who
need specialized services away from
Cowell are the very ones who need
free health care the most."
McClenahan said he feared that
charging for use of the infirmary might
discourage ill students from using it.
Plan Rejected
Cowell has also considered charging
students at cost for office visits, but
said that the plan was rejected for
many reasons.
First, it might be difficult to collect
on the bills, and the paperwork
involved in collection might actually
exceed the cost of the medical care,
McClenahan said.
Second, some students might be
short of money and the University
doesn't want to penalize them,
McClenahan said.
Current System
Third, the current system protects
students from high emergency medical
bills. For example, a broken ankle
involves hundreds of dollars of medical
