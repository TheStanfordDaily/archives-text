# Washington State On Watergate

Injustice . ..
In a recent New York Times column, Tom
Wicker compared the imprisonment and
eventual return to society of the convicted
Watergate conspirators to the rougher times
usually experienced by those our culture calls
"common criminals."
Wicker writes, "It is true enough that all
three men (John Dean, Herbert Kalmbach
and Jeb Magruder) ultimately helped the
government crack the Watergate case and
convict the other culprits; but it is also true
that they could have blown the whistle at
any time, but never did until faced with the
necessity to save their skins as best they
could. "To the millions of low-income,
disadvantaged, unskilled and uneducated
Americans, so many of whom have good
reason to view the law with fear and distrust,
the whole episode is likely to be another
demonstration that there is one kind of
justice for them, and another for affluent,
educated persons with good lawyers and
'standing' in their communities ..."
The "common criminal" upon release
from prison often faces social stigma,
unemployment and estrangement from the
community. But the Watergate culprits, after
spending a few months' lull in the
country-club atmosphere of such prisons as
Allenwood and Fort Holabird, have better
chances to re-enter society with promising
futures to complement all their social graces.
The convicted bank robber might live to
rob again and be returned to prison for
another term. Statistics show a high number
of criminals returning to prison for the same
crimes that put them into prison the first
time. Methods for socially rehabilitating the
criminal are being examined as alternatives to
the mere detention of bodies for a specified
period of time with only token concern for
altering the criminal's behavior.
If the bank robber does not become a
better citizen after a harsh prison term, what
can be expected from white collar criminals

after a few months in minimum security
prisons?
The conspirators' futures are tainted by
scandal and aided by their national fame.
Celebrities of just about any type, even
famous criminals, have bright futures as long
as they remain bankable people. But the
future of H.R. Haldeman as a political
commentator for a major radio network
seems to be as promising as the future of
Sonny Bono as an entertainer.
Who wants the likes of John Dean and Jeb
Magruder now? After the many firsthand
accounts of the Watergate affair hit the
bookshelves, the Watergate figures will
probably locate jobs in fields in which some
air of roguishness is required, excluding jobs
concerning politics or the law. True justice
might not have been meted in the
punishment of the Watergate conspirators,
but the men have legally paid their debt to
society.
What kind of people the convicted
conspirators were before their imprisonment
should have little effect on their future if
imprisonment shows them their mistakes in
judgment. Their futures after prison should
center upon whether or not the lessons of
Watergate have been learned by the
participants. Their places in society rest
entirely on their revelations.

Conspiracy...
The new year opened with the conviction
of four of the key men involved in the
Watergate cover-up, and it seemed to signal
that the "national nightmare" was over and
1975 was getting a fresh start. Watergate was
finally behind us.
But there are still a lot of unanswered
questions which unfortunately remain just
that and will continue to haunt this nation's
conscience. The Jan. 2 issue of Rolling Stone
magazine brings to light some of these

unsolved items such as:
—A slip of the tongue by Haldeman on the
April 25th tape where he and Nixon were
discussing the cash paid to the Watergate
burglars. "Some of it went to Hunt's
lawyer," Haldeman tells the president. "His
wife was taking money to a Cuban when her
plane was shot down." Why does Haldeman
use the term "shot down" when "crashed"
would have sufficed?
—The fact that Nixon and Howard Hunt
knew each other personally since the 50s and
that they were involved in the planning of
the ClA's Bay of Pigs invasion. At that time
Nixon was vice president and Hunt was the
ClA's political action chief. Both were
obviously well-acquainted with the
procedures used to disrupt another country's
political stability before Nixon moved into
the White House. In view of this it is highly
possible that both were deeply involved in
President Allende's death. It is doubtful we
will ever know the true answer to this.
—The strange circumstance that a man
looking like Hunt was arrested by the Dallas
police only a few blocks from the textbook
depository the morning Kennedy was
assassinated. Couple this with the fact that
Nixon himself was in Dallas from Nov. 20 to
Nov. 23,1963, and the conspiratorial aspect
of the mind goes wild.
I realize that all of this sounds a little
farfetched and there is probably no way to
either prove or disprove these items. Few
people would be willing to believe that Nixon
had anything to do with JFK's death
myself included.
But when Watergate first broke few
people believed it was much more than a
third rate burglary. Finally the President was
discovered to be a liar and had to leave the
White House hounded out not by the press,
but by his own taped voice.
Now it is possible to believe almost
anything about Nixon no matter how
horrible it may sound.
