# On Undermining Property Rights
## 
### Anthony Horrigon 
It is a virtual certainty that the
new Congress will make a fresh
attempt to pass a
federal land use control law.
Everyone who is concerned
about the safeguarding of
property rights, which are
fundamental to personal liberties,
should be aware of how land use
control legislation undermines
those rights.
A case in point is the land use
control law in force on the
California seacoast. I refer to the
coastal zone law passed by the
initiative system on Nov. 7,1972,
and referred to as Prop. 20.
Under provisions of the
California law, a coastal land use
control zone was established,
extending from Oregon to the
Mexican border. Within this zone,
development, construction or
modifications to property may
proceed only after a permit has
been obtained from one of six
Regional Coastal Commissions.
The limitation of individual
property rights is clearly spelled
out in this law which declares that
"the California coastal zone is a
distinct and valuable natural
resource belonging to all the
people." There isn't any provision
in the law for compensation to
owners for expropriation of
private property rights.
'High-Handed Manner.?
The coastal commissioners
have operated in a high-handed
manner. In the case of one
property owner, who sought to
erect a building on a four acre
parcel of coastal land, the
Commission denied use of the

land for housing.
The Commission staff said that
the four acre tract might be used
for a golf course or a cattle ranch.
It is a bit difficult to have a
one-hole golf course or a four acre
cattle ranch.
Dr. M. Bruce Johnson,
professor of economics at the
University of California, Santa
Barbara, has served on the
Regional Coastline Commission
and outlined the ways in which
property rights have been
undermined. In an article in
Reason Magazine , Johnson notes:
"The expropriation of private
property rights in this manner, the
state-wide election and public
hearings notwithstanding, can
only be regarded as rank theft.
Prop. 20 violates the spirit and the
letter of the Fifth Amendment
guarantee that private property
shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation.
"The Constitution was- once
regarded as both a guarantee of
individual rights of action and a
limitation on the acts of the state.
The contemporary situation is
almost the reverse; under its
police powers, the state has
arrogated to itself the right to do
virtually anything it pleases while
individuals may act only be
permission. According to Prop.
20, 'the applicant (individual land
owner) shall have the burden of
proof on all issues.'
Resource Allocation
"Even if a case could be made
for state rather than individual

resource allocation, I find
compensation. Why doesn't the
state buy the land it wishes to use,
modify or preserve?
"The environmentalists
answer: The cost of purchasing
the land that society wants to save
is far greater than the amount
society can pay (i.e., wants to
pay). No doubt that is correct,
but it is also evident that society
gives higher ranking and priority
to alternative uses of its public
funds.
"In other words the public
wants the environmental
preservation of private land, but

only if it is free!"
What we find in California's
Coastal Zone Conservation Act is
a major violation of the
constitutional rights of those
individuals who own property on
the seacoast.
Hopefully, the American
people will familiarize themselves
with Prop. 20 and learn from it. It
would be tragic if a federal land
use control law were passed that
extended expropriation of
property rights to all 50 states.

Prop. 20 violates the spirit and the
letter of the Fifth Amendment
guarantee that private property
shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation.
"The Constitution was- once
regarded as both a guarantee of
individual rights of action and a
limitation on the acts of the state.
The contemporary situation is
almost the reverse; under its

virtually anything it pleases while

permission. According to Prop.

owner) shall have the burden of

Resource Allocation
"Even if a case could be made

resource allocation, I find
compensation. Why doesn't the
state buy the land it wishes to use,

"The environmentalists
answer: The cost of purchasing
the land that society wants to save

society can pay (i.e., wants to

What we find in California's
Coastal Zone Conservation Act is
a major violation of the
constitutional rights of those
individuals who own property on
the seacoast.
Hopefully, the American
people will familiarize themselves
with Prop. 20 and learn from it. It
would be tragic if a federal land
use control law were passed that
extended expropriation of
property rights to all 50 states.

vice president of the United States
Industrial Council.)
It is a virtual certainty that the
new Congress will make a fresh
attempt to pass a
federal land use control law.
Everyone who is concerned
about the safeguarding of
property rights, which are
fundamental to personal liberties,
should be aware of how land use
control legislation undermines
those rights.
A case in point is the land use
control law in force on the
California seacoast. I refer to the
coastal zone law passed by the
initiative system on Nov. 7,1972,
and referred to as Prop. 20.
Under provisions of the
California law, a coastal land use
control zone was established,
extending from Oregon to the
Mexican border. Within this zone,
development, construction or
modifications to property may
proceed only after a permit has
been obtained from one of six
Regional Coastal Commissions.
The limitation of individual
property rights is clearly spelled
out in this law which declares that
"the California coastal zone is a
distinct and valuable natural
resource belonging to all the
people." There isn't any provision
in the law for compensation to
owners for expropriation of
private property rights.
'High-Handed Manner.?
The coastal commissioners
have operated in a high-handed
manner. In the case of one
property owner, who sought to
erect a building on a four acre
parcel of coastal land, the
Commission denied use of the

land for housing.
The Commission staff said that
the four acre tract might be used
for a golf course or a cattle ranch.
It is a bit difficult to have a
one-hole golf course or a four acre
cattle ranch.
