# Jones Grows Radical

### Don Jones 
The current controversy over
the proposed elimination of
SWOPSI, SCIRE and the
Undergraduate Writing Program
(UWP) is only another
manifestation of a malady which
is slowly strangling Stanford due
to less than creative solutions to
the budget crisis it faces.
The ideals of a liberal
education are publicly espoused,
but behind the scenes it's a
different matter. The Stanford to
which I came is not the Stanford I
expected and the difference is
definitely not for the
better. Incidents have been
bludgeoning my sensibilities since
my return this fall. First, a group
of civil engineering students was
told it was in danger of losing its
ECPD accreditation due to a lack
of design oriented coursework.
The implication was that the,
students wouldn't be able to find
jobs if the school lost its
accreditation. Baloney!
If several studies have shown
the Stanford School of
Engineering among the top three
in the country, then let's exercise
our position of leadership and
stand behind our commitment to
a "liberal education."
I have seen the results of
bowing to ECPD pressure as an
undergraduate at the University of
Detroit, and I came to Stanford to
escape the "pipe-fitting,
metal-bending" mentality it had
produced.
Summed Up
Tim Noonan of Stanford
summed it up only last year in an
essay on the value of liberal
culturization for engineers which
received a national award from
the Tau Beta Pi Association.
In a time when students are
pictured as cutthroat gradgrubbers
shouldn't we learn the lesson that
little regard for people as human
beings can go a long way?
Furthermore, those who would
espouse this humanistic approach
to education are in danger of
extinction. One undergraduate
course which I audited last fall
(Civil Engineering 170) certainly
not without a touch of bias, but it
was informative and enjoyable.
Latest word has it the
professor will not be asked to
return after next fall, yet the
department and indeed the School
of Engineering state that they
have "a commitment to
excellence in teaching." Ptui!
Audit Attempted
This winter I tried to audit a
language course because of its
potential usefulness to me in
job-hunting, a planned trip to
Europe and on account of my
ancestry. Apparently, my first
error in judgment was being
honest with the professor and
explaining my desires and
reasoning for wanting to take the
course.
As a halftime research
assistant, I can take only nine
units per quarter, or else I face the
double jeopardy of losing a
percentage of my aid for the
quarter, and having to pay extra
tuition (even up to the full rate),
according to new rules issued by
the Office of Graduate Studies.
One rule says that graduate
students can't audit language
courses unless they're Terminal
Graduate Students (although
faculty wives can take them). Deja
vu ' This reminds me of my
incursion into the bureaucracy of
Washington, D.C., last summer.
Heaven forbid that I might learn
something without paying for it.
Are we at Stanford dedicated to
the principle that diplomas must
be ransomed, not earned? Are we
doomed to mindless enforcement
of rules because they're there?
And University officials wonder
why and how young people
especially students become
radicalized.
