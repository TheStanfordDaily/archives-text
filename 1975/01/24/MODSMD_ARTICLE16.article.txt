# Is The 'Movement' Dead? Well, Not Exactly

The press has announced the passing of
what it called the "radical 605," the
all-but-forgotten days of student anti-war
activism.
And incoming students have accepted this
verdict. Only one class of current Stanford
students remembers first-hand a large
anti-war demonstration, with hundreds of
students marching down Palm Drive and
blocking El Camino.
Last year, even demonstrations against
Richard Nixon failed to bring out the large
crowds which lesser villains used to draw.
But radical student activity may be waking
from its years of sluggishness. Campus groups
such as Columbae, the "social change through
non-violence" theme house, have kept
activities going at least within their own
groups. And these efforts are now reaching a
larger segment of the Stanford community.
Although a demonstration fall quarter

against Marine recruitment on campus,
organized by the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC), was dubbed "not quite what it used to
be" by the Daily, its organizers declared it a
success.
At the time one of the organizers said that
the crowd was large for a Stanford protest,
adding, "If we have this many people out in
the fall, think what we can have by spring
quarter."
Columbae and ARC also successfully
provided radical input to established political
bodies this fall from the ASSU Senate to
the Democratic Convention in Kansas City.
The last two scholars invited by the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board have represented
Third World interests, although neither of
them have been able to leave their countries
to accept the invitations.
Within the past week, at least four anti-war
meetings and speeches have been organized by
several different local groups.

Th# Committee to Invite Thai to Stanford,
together with the Stanford Amnesty
Committee (SAC), sponsored journalist Don
Luce and Bui Van Dao, a South Vietnamese
studying in the U.S., in a presentation in
Bishop Auditorium. The speakers criticized
U.S. involvement in Vietnam and denounced
the Paris Peace Agreement of 1973.
SAC also invited former student body
president and draft resister David Harris to
speak in Memorial Church on Saturday with
Jeanne Friedman, a former Stanford student
and director of Vietnam Veterans Against the
War.
At the talk, Friedman told the audience
that anti-war sentiment in the country is at
least as strong as it was in the 60s. She said
that the 50 listeners represented
approximately the same size audience that
similar presentations drew during the days of
"student activism."
The anti-war movement is merely suffering
from a campaign to discredit its success and
existence, Friedman said.
At least 30 members of the Stanford
community met in Tresidder Tuesday to hear
a presentation by three ex-prisoners of the
present saigon regime. When a State
Department ban prevented their speeches, the
audience stayed to hear a substitute
presentation by representatives of the
American Friends Service Committee (AFSC).
Wednesday night Columbae House showed
a British Broadcasting Corporation film
entitled "Vietnam: Still America's War." And
Thursday, the Pacific Studies Center in Palo
Alto organized what it called "a good
old-fashioned picket" against the Association
of Old Crows, an electronic warfare fraternity.
In view of the activity generated this year
by these student groups, the "radical
movement" may not be on the verge of
victory, but it is not over, either.
