# Lyons: Issue Not 'Significant
## Housing Plan Ignores Sex Discrimination 
### BONNY ROODEN 
The Committee On Student Services
(COSS) housing subcommittee is finally
considering a proposal for a new residential
system which has won glowing acclaim from
many people, including the term
"magnificent" from a high-ranking University
administrator.
Incredibly enough, though, the elaborate
plan completely sidesteps the Alpha Signa Phi
issue of discrimination on the basis of sex
the issue which catalyzed the initial search for
a new residential system.

Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
described the proposal as a "magnificent
solution to a very difficult problem too
many students for too few spaces."
Lyons' remark is somewhat justified
because the proposal does address one type of
inequity. Now everyone will bear the burden
of the housing shortage, not merely students
in the draw. All entering freshmen will be
guaranteed only three years campus housing
whether they live in a University house or a
fraternity.
However, students will suffer in separate

ways depending on which of the two systems
they choose. Students in the draw must
choose which year their chances for
on-campus housing will be minimal.
All-male fraternities, on the other hand,
will be forced to accomodate more students,
compelling the fraternities to either crowd
their house or establish an off-campus annex
for the extra members. '
But co-educational fraternities are
considered in the draw while all-male
fraternities are autonomous. Here lies the
discrimination. Under the proposal a woman
could not live in a crowded house to avoid
living off campus, a man could.
The subcommittee and a number of
University officials have chosen to ignore this
sort of discrimination.
Lyons denied that the plans contain any
"significant privileges" specifically for men.
He said he considers the crowding a burden
whether rather than a privilege. At any rate,
men and women do not share the same
burdens.
The proposal does solve one problem that
has troubled the Admissions Office and, more
directly, transfers. Transfers will be
guaranteed housing their first year here. This
is probably the best received provision of the
entire proposal.
Because the proposal is still in draft form, a
number of issues still remain to be clarified
before the proposal is fully accepted or
rejected.
Inter-Fraternity Council President Mike
Nilsson objected to the ultimatum delivered
by the University to individual fraternities.

Under the proposal, each fraternity must
accept a set number of members in two
subsequent years or be incorporated into the
draw. Nilsson would prefer that the entire
fraternity system be forced to accomodate the
extra students, instead of the individual
houses.
Nilsson also urged a stabilization in the
number of admissions to prevent the housing
shortage from becoming intolerable.
The proposal still has some questions left
unanswered, but it looks as if the University is
going to accept it.

rejected.
Inter-Fraternity Council President Mike
Nilsson objected to the ultimatum delivered
by the University to individual fraternities.

Under the proposal, each fraternity must
accept a set number of members in two
subsequent years or be incorporated into the
draw. Nilsson would prefer that the entire
fraternity system be forced to accomodate the
extra students, instead of the individual
houses.
Nilsson also urged a stabilization in the
number of admissions to prevent the housing
shortage from becoming intolerable.
The proposal still has some questions left
unanswered, but it looks as if the University is
going to accept it.

The Committee On Student Services
(COSS) housing subcommittee is finally
considering a proposal for a new residential
system which has won glowing acclaim from
many people, including the term
"magnificent" from a high-ranking University
administrator.
Incredibly enough, though, the elaborate
plan completely sidesteps the Alpha Signa Phi
issue of discrimination on the basis of sex
the issue which catalyzed the initial search for
a new residential system.

Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
described the proposal as a "magnificent
solution to a very difficult problem too
many students for too few spaces."
Lyons' remark is somewhat justified
because the proposal does address one type of
inequity. Now everyone will bear the burden
of the housing shortage, not merely students
in the draw. All entering freshmen will be
guaranteed only three years campus housing
whether they live in a University house or a
fraternity.
However, students will suffer in separate

ways depending on which of the two systems
they choose. Students in the draw must
choose which year their chances for
on-campus housing will be minimal.
All-male fraternities, on the other hand,
will be forced to accomodate more students,
compelling the fraternities to either crowd
their house or establish an off-campus annex
for the extra members. '
But co-educational fraternities are
considered in the draw while all-male
fraternities are autonomous. Here lies the
discrimination. Under the proposal a woman
could not live in a crowded house to avoid
living off campus, a man could.
The subcommittee and a number of
University officials have chosen to ignore this
sort of discrimination.
Lyons denied that the plans contain any
"significant privileges" specifically for men.
He said he considers the crowding a burden
whether rather than a privilege. At any rate,
men and women do not share the same
burdens.
The proposal does solve one problem that
has troubled the Admissions Office and, more
directly, transfers. Transfers will be
guaranteed housing their first year here. This
is probably the best received provision of the
entire proposal.
Because the proposal is still in draft form, a
number of issues still remain to be clarified
before the proposal is fully accepted or
rejected.
