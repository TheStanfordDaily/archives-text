# Placement Center Policy May Finish File Squabble
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
The Career Planning and Placement
Center's recent decision to establish both
open and closed files for student and alumni
job hunters seems to have provided a solution
for administrators in dealing with the
controversial Buckley Amendment.
The amendment, effective January 1,
provides for student access to previously
confidential files. Drafted by Sen. James
Buckley (C-NY), it was originally intended to
protect students who felt that certain
notations in their files were misleading or
unfair, perhaps barring them from college
entrance or job acceptance. Under the
amendment, those who want to see their files
while challenging a decision may do so.
Before its revision the amendment
provoked problems for University officials in
dealing with confidential letters of
recommendation. Administrators argued that
opening letters to student inspection
constituted a breach of confidence.
Revised last November, the law now
exempts all letters of recommendation written
before January 1 and permits students to sign
waivers to forego the right to inspect their
files.
The decision is now left up to the student
whether to sign a waiver to close his
placement file or to keep it open. Should he
or she wish to keep it open, all letters of
recommendation will be written with the
understanding by the author that the letter

may be viewed at any time by the student.
Administrators have previously voiced the fear
that this could bias the letters the author
may be more inclined to only point out the
positive qualities of an applicant.
A student who waives right of access to his
or her file is barred from ever reading his
letters of recommendation. A secretary at the
Placement Center explained "this is for the
protection of the writers. If we guarantee
confidentiality, we have to keep our word."
There are certain advantages to having
confidential file when applying for a job, the
Placement Center contends. When files are
submitted to prospective employers, a file
labeled confidential is considered to be more
objective and valid. Employers may be more
inclined to choose among those with
confidential files for final consideration to a
position.
The Placement Center's policy was
implemented in response to a request made
earlier by James Siena, legal advisor to the
office of the president. Siena has asked all
affected departments of the University to
submit their policy guidelines for dealing with
the Buckley Amendment. The Placement
Center was the first to comply, Siena noted.
Other departments have yet to respond to
Siena's request. Graduate and undergraduate
admissions offices here may choose to opt for
two files, as may the personnel office. But
they will all have to decide soon. January 1
was over three weeks ago.

they will all have to decide soon. January 1
was over three weeks ago.
The Career Planning and Placement
Center's recent decision to establish both
open and closed files for student and alumni
job hunters seems to have provided a solution
for administrators in dealing with the
controversial Buckley Amendment.
The amendment, effective January 1,
provides for student access to previously
confidential files. Drafted by Sen. James
Buckley (C-NY), it was originally intended to
protect students who felt that certain
notations in their files were misleading or
unfair, perhaps barring them from college
entrance or job acceptance. Under the
amendment, those who want to see their files
while challenging a decision may do so.
Before its revision the amendment
provoked problems for University officials in
dealing with confidential letters of
recommendation. Administrators argued that
opening letters to student inspection
constituted a breach of confidence.
Revised last November, the law now
exempts all letters of recommendation written
before January 1 and permits students to sign
waivers to forego the right to inspect their
files.
The decision is now left up to the student
whether to sign a waiver to close his
placement file or to keep it open. Should he
or she wish to keep it open, all letters of
recommendation will be written with the
understanding by the author that the letter

may be viewed at any time by the student.
Administrators have previously voiced the fear
that this could bias the letters the author
may be more inclined to only point out the
positive qualities of an applicant.
A student who waives right of access to his
or her file is barred from ever reading his
letters of recommendation. A secretary at the
Placement Center explained "this is for the
protection of the writers. If we guarantee
confidentiality, we have to keep our word."
There are certain advantages to having
confidential file when applying for a job, the
Placement Center contends. When files are
submitted to prospective employers, a file
labeled confidential is considered to be more
objective and valid. Employers may be more
inclined to choose among those with
confidential files for final consideration to a
position.
The Placement Center's policy was
implemented in response to a request made
earlier by James Siena, legal advisor to the
office of the president. Siena has asked all
affected departments of the University to
submit their policy guidelines for dealing with
the Buckley Amendment. The Placement
Center was the first to comply, Siena noted.
Other departments have yet to respond to
Siena's request. Graduate and undergraduate
admissions offices here may choose to opt for
two files, as may the personnel office. But
they will all have to decide soon. January 1
was over three weeks ago.
