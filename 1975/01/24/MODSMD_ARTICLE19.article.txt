# ASSU Makes 'Big Bucks' But Is It Going To Last?

Student governments are usually up to
their ears in debt because the young
visionaries who run them have a tendency to
spend more money than they have on their
pet projects which will, of course, clear up
the problems of all the students, if not all the
world.
But following the release of the ASSU's fall
quarter financial report, it appears the tide of
red ink has been at least temporarily stemmed
at Stanford in fact, the ASSU is well into
the black.
The news may not all be good. When told
of the "big bucks" rolling into the Tresidder
office, the first thing ASSU senators asked
about was how to spend the money. Even so,
there have been no hordes of student
politicians beating on the financial manager's
door for a share of the dough to enhance their
newest scheme.
There is usually a lack of far-sightedness on
the part of student politicians and they often
neglect to consider what will happen after
they leave with their sheepskin. ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri is trying to
establish more long range financial
equilibrium by using the new profits to
increase cash reserves for ASSU projects.
Because of the lack of consistency in the
financial condition of the ASSU and its
projects due to the high turnover in
management personnel projects can do well
one year and yet lose their shirt in the next.

By fattening the financial cushion the projects
have to fall back upon, Olivieri hopes to ease
this bumpy financial situation.
Of course, this is all contingent upon a
fairly constant influx of money into the
ASSU from investments in order to back up
the projects.
Olivieri has done fairly well in realizing
good returns on invested funds: about
$23,000 last quarter. Confident he could do
better, Olivieri also took over financial
management of an investment account of
some $120,000 previously under University
direction.
Most of the $23,000 was made by
investments in so-called "paper equivalents"
such as short-term certificates of deposits and
treasury bonds. Olivieri has obtained interest
rates on these investments running between
7.5 and 11.75 percent, much higher than the
"awful" seven percent rate of return the
University made on the $120,000.
But University Director of Finance Rodney
Adams warned that the high interest rates
might not last and that if they fall much
more, the ASSU could realize lower yields
than if the funds were invested in a diversified
and more balanced investment portfolio like
the University maintains.
Olivieri isn't going to be around forever,
Adams also notes, and if his successor is any
less competent, the ASSU's newly found
financial equilibrium could disintegrate.
