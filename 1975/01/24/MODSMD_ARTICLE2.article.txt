# Ford Raises Tariffs On Oil
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) President Ford signed a
proclamation yesterday boosting tariffs on imported oil and
said later that failing to act "would have been a sign of
weakness around the world."
The higher tariffs will hike retail gasoline prices by an
estimated three cents a gallon by summer, a White House
spokesman said.
"The time for action had come," Ford said in an
interview broadcast on NBC television and radio. "That's
why I took the rather stern action.. .
"If I had backed off, there would have been two adverse
impacts . .. Congress would have delayed longer . .. and it
would have been a sign of weakness around the world . ..
that we couldn't make up our mind, couldn't find a
remedy," Ford said.
"We've diddled and dawdled long enough," Ford told
the newsmen. "We've got to have a national energy policy."
Asked for his reaction to moves by key congressional
Democrats to void the higher tariffs through legislation,
Ford declared: "To take a backward step is not in my
opinion a very wise way to solve the energy problem."
In a wide-ranging, sometimes philosophical nationally
televised interview with two NBC correspondents, Ford
defended his imposition of tariffs, repeated his opposition
to gasoline rationing and again urged rapid congressional
action on his economic proposals.
The hour-long interview conducted in the White House
living quarters produced the stiffest warning yet from Ford
against any attempt to strangle the United States
economically.
"... In the case of economic strangulation," Ford said,

the nation has "to be prepared ... to take the necessary
action for our self-preservation."
"When you are being strangled it is a case ofeither dying
or living," he said, adding that he believed the "public has
to have the reassurance that we are not going to permit
America to be strangled to death..."
One of Ford's interviewers, NBC anchorman John
Chancellor, mentioned reports that three U.S. divisions
were ready for possible action in the Middle East. Ford
responded he didn't think he should "talk about any
particular military contingency plans," and later, a
Pentagon spokesman declared: "We have no plan to send
any divisions to the Middle East."
Ford said a new oil embargo would produce a very
serious situation because the oil cartel might present a more
solid front than during the 1973 embargo when the United
States continued to receive shipments from non-Arab oil
producers.
A tougher embargo, he said, would require "more drastic
action." But he said gasoline rationing would be a last
resort in such a case.
The questioning ranged from the domestic economy to
foreign policy to Ford's intellectual qualifications to be
president. On that point, he noted that he had always
finished in the upper one-third of his class in college and
that thus "there must be an awful lot of people who are
dumber than I."
In discussing the Middle East, Ford said he was hopeful
that Kissinger's step-by-step approach would reach a
negotiated settlement.
"If we don't try to move in this direction at this time,"
he said, "I think we might lose a unique opportunity."

producers.
A tougher embargo, he said, would require "more drastic
action." But he said gasoline rationing would be a last
resort in such a case.
The questioning ranged from the domestic economy to
foreign policy to Ford's intellectual qualifications to be
president. On that point, he noted that he had always
finished in the upper one-third of his class in college and
that thus "there must be an awful lot of people who are
dumber than I."
In discussing the Middle East, Ford said he was hopeful
that Kissinger's step-by-step approach would reach a
negotiated settlement.
"If we don't try to move in this direction at this time,"
he said, "I think we might lose a unique opportunity."
WASHINGTON (AP) President Ford signed a
proclamation yesterday boosting tariffs on imported oil and
said later that failing to act "would have been a sign of
weakness around the world."
The higher tariffs will hike retail gasoline prices by an
estimated three cents a gallon by summer, a White House
spokesman said.
"The time for action had come," Ford said in an
interview broadcast on NBC television and radio. "That's
why I took the rather stern action.. .
"If I had backed off, there would have been two adverse
impacts . .. Congress would have delayed longer . .. and it
would have been a sign of weakness around the world . ..
that we couldn't make up our mind, couldn't find a
remedy," Ford said.
"We've diddled and dawdled long enough," Ford told
the newsmen. "We've got to have a national energy policy."
Asked for his reaction to moves by key congressional
Democrats to void the higher tariffs through legislation,
Ford declared: "To take a backward step is not in my
opinion a very wise way to solve the energy problem."
In a wide-ranging, sometimes philosophical nationally
televised interview with two NBC correspondents, Ford
defended his imposition of tariffs, repeated his opposition
to gasoline rationing and again urged rapid congressional
action on his economic proposals.
The hour-long interview conducted in the White House
living quarters produced the stiffest warning yet from Ford
against any attempt to strangle the United States
economically.
"... In the case of economic strangulation," Ford said,

the nation has "to be prepared ... to take the necessary
action for our self-preservation."
"When you are being strangled it is a case ofeither dying
or living," he said, adding that he believed the "public has
to have the reassurance that we are not going to permit
America to be strangled to death..."
One of Ford's interviewers, NBC anchorman John
Chancellor, mentioned reports that three U.S. divisions
were ready for possible action in the Middle East. Ford
responded he didn't think he should "talk about any
particular military contingency plans," and later, a
Pentagon spokesman declared: "We have no plan to send
any divisions to the Middle East."
Ford said a new oil embargo would produce a very
serious situation because the oil cartel might present a more
solid front than during the 1973 embargo when the United
States continued to receive shipments from non-Arab oil
producers.
A tougher embargo, he said, would require "more drastic
action." But he said gasoline rationing would be a last
resort in such a case.
