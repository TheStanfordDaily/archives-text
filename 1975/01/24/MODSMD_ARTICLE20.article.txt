# Court Backs Students On Suspension Rights
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
sharply divided Supreme Court
ruled Wednesday that pupils
suspended from public schools
have a constitutional right to
know and answer the charges
against them.
Dealing specifically with
suspensions of from one to 10
days, the court said the pupils
must be given notice of the
charges and "at least an informal
give-and-take between student and
disciplinarian."
The court withheld judgment
on how much of a hearing is
required for longer suspensions or
for expulsions, but suggested that
these "may require more formal
procedures."
It also said that "something
more than the rudimentary
procedures" might be required for
short suspensions in unusual cases.
Dissenting in the 5-4 decision
were all of the justices appointed
to the court by former President
Richard M. Nixon: Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger and Justices
Harry A. Blackmun, William H.
Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr.
The court said the informal

hearing which need only be a
discussion with the student
immediately after the alleged
misbehavior should generally be
held before the student is sent
home.
The decision is expected to
have a major impact on schools.
Statistics presented to the court
showed that at least 10 percent of
junior and senior high school
students in a five-state survey
were suspended one or more times
in the 1972-73 school year.
The school decision extends to
public school pupils essentially
the kind of procedural rights
which the court has granted in
recent years to prisoners, parolees
and welfare recipients.
Powell, in the dissent, said the
relationship of teachers and pupils
is "manifestly different" from
those involved in those situations.
Justice Byron R. White,
speaking for the majority, said
even a brief suspension from
school "is a serious event in the
life of the suspended child" which
could damage his reputation and
make it harder for him to get a
job after he graduates.
