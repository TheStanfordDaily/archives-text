## 'Shrew' Tamed Brilliantly 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
The American Conservatory
Theatre's revival of The Taming of
the Shrew is brilliantly conceived
and superbly realized on the
Geary stage. ACT has nurtured an
imaginative directorial approach
to Shakespeare with vibrance,
energy and elan, creating the most
exciting piece of theatre in the
Bay Area and comparing quite
favorably with the best of New
York, London and even
Stratford-Upon-Avon. This jewel
from last year's season has grown
even richer and more sparkling.
Director William Ball's
delightful coup is a commedia
delVarte approach. Commedia
delTarte was a form of popular
Italian comedy which had its
greatest vogue in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. It was
performed by specially trained
troups of actors who improvised
on prearranged synopses involving
a group of caricatures and a series
of stock situations.
Shrew is a natural for the
commedia delTarte style. Written
in the early 1590s when
Shakespeare was but a fledging
dramatist, Shrew has many
elements of caricature in its
dramatis personae.
Farcical
The fact that Shrew must be
classified as a farce rather than a
comedy lends credence to the
slapstick buffoonery of a
commedia delTarte interpretation.
Certainly the Italian setting of
Padua compliments this as well. In
Petruchio we see a perfect
example of the delTarte
"facchini ," witty rogues who
projected greed and shrewdness as
their staple characteristics. In
Grumio and in the other servants,
one glimpses the delTarte "dei
zanni acrobatic and impudent
servants.
Ball pulls no punches in his
imitation of Italian Renaissance
troupes. Not only is the action
sprinkled with pratfalls, to the
accompaniment of drums, bells
and slide whistles, but there is
actually a "slapstick" that's
right, the clap-board that makes
the noise which finds its way on
the stage to punctuate the farce
from time to time.
Fair Suitors

The fair if dull suitors of
Bianca, Gremio and Hortensio, are
played up as the ridiculous
caricatures they are, complete
with oversized shoes a la Ringling
Brothers clowns. The acrobatic
stunts add to the mood of circus
frivolity.
The cast plunges into Ball's
ideas with great vigor and
enthusiasm. All its members are
on stage throughout the entire
play, sitting around the very
simple central canvas platform on
which all the action takes place
and sharing in its moods.
Whenever Padua is mentioned

the entire troupe bursts out with a
glorious cheer of "PADUA!"
When Bianca sighs there is a
sympathetic chorus of "aaahhh"
from one and all, reminding us
that a repertory company is still
very much like its Italian
renaissance counterpart. The
company's splendiferous
exuberance is contagious enough
to make the most cynical of
sophisticates grin and guffaw at its
slapstick farce.
As in any good company, the
whole of the production is a great
deal more than the sum of its
parts. The subtleties of
"ensemble," that closeness that
makes for impeccable timing, are
precisely what puts a repertoire
company on a plane of its own.
Nevertheless, the parts were
quite good and deserve some
mention. Fredi Olster's Katherina
has grown in the last year. She
was absolutely beautiful as lusty
shrew and loving wife (although
the former was a bit more fun)
and made the difficult transition
marvelously. The interpretation
was correct; she was not defeated
by Petruchio, but sought to please
him out of love.

It is overly facile to label
Shrew as an unliberated play.
Kate's final speech is not of
domestic servility but of the
overpowering force of love.
Robust Petruchio
Anthony S. Teague's Petruchio
is warm and robust. Ronald
Boussom fills Grumio to the brim
with an incredible abundance of
business. Raye Birk and James R.
Winker are wonderfully wacky as
Bianca's unlikely suitors and
Randall Duk Kim is once again a
master of Shakespearean verse,
this time as Tranio.
Costumes were of a uniform
off-white for the entire cast with
red trim on the main characters to
spice things up. The simplicity of
both costumes and set enhanced
the sense of a travelling commedia
delVarte troupe and, importantly,
balanced the extravagances of
slapstick.
The Shakespearean world
stands on its own; the Elizabethan
stage had little or no scenery.
William Ball has chosen to
enhance it with a complimentary
style rather than abuse it with the
extravagances of costume and set
which are so often responsible for
the petrification of Shakespeare.
Ball's innovative approach is
hugely successful because it is in
keeping with, and enhances the
spirit of the text, unlike the
abuses of this year's Richard 111.
Indeed, Shakespeare should not
be tampered with arbitrarily;
there should be a specified purpose
for any innovation of style or
interpretation which is offered.
But the supreme beauty of
Shakespeare's works is that they
lend themselves to an infinite

variety of interpretations and
offer such a limitless reservoir of
rewards.
The ultimate test of any
interpretation is whether it
enhances the play or adds some
flash or insight to the work.
Judging from the ebullient
electricity which fills the Geary
Theatre when Shrew is on stage,
one can only conclude: this is the
way Shakespeare is supposed to
be.
