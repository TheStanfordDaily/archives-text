# The 						Reel World
## Movies To Look For In '75 
### George Powell 
If movie goers tried to exercise
reality in 1974 by attending films
about imaginary disasters in
record numbers, 1975 shapes up
as the year of the sequel, with
formulas that attracted audiences
in the past recycled across the
silver screen.
1975 will bring French
Connection II to the screen, with

Gene Hackman repeating his role
as Popeye Doyle. Funny Girl fans
will get Funny Lady, with Barbara
Streisand repeating her Academy
Award-winning performance. And
if you loved Westworld,
Future World will take the tale of
an adult Disneyland of the future
to even more absurd conclusions.
MGM, the company that used

to make movies before they went
into the hotel business, saw they
had a hit in That's Entertainment,
so why not repackage more clips
from old films and call it That's
Entertainment, Too!? Finally, for
special effects fans who are tired
of seeing natural disasters, Sinbad
and a host of weird monsters will
be back in Sinbad at the World's
End, a reprise of the successful
The Golden Voyage of Sinbad.
Oral Enjoyment
There's also a sequel of sorts
that's really hard to swallow
follow-up to the long running
Deep Throat 11. That's Linda
Lovelace for President, and it's
being finished off three separate
ways, PG, R and X. Consult your
local court for the version allowed
to play in your region.

Seriously, 1974 wasn't a
banner year for hard-core porn.
With Linda Lovelace and Marilyn
Chambers busy posing for
Playboy and trying out nightclub
acts, only Georgina Spelvin (of
Devil in Miss Jones fame) was
seen erotically emoting on screen
last year. The top star of gay
hard-core-films , Casey Donovan,
even took a turn on stage. Only
Flesh Gordon, a soft-core spoof of
Flash Gordon serials, was a box
office smash.
But hard-core porn isn't dead
by any means. In addition to
Linda Lovelace for President, look
for Sometime Sweet Susan, the
first hard-core movie to be

authorized by the Screen Actors
Guild, and featuring Harry Reams,
whose tool taught Lovelace her
trade in Deep Throat.
Can a serious movie with actual
intercourse scenes succeed? In
view of the Supreme Court
decision giving localities the right
to determine obscenity, will it be
shown anywhere but the more
liberal states? 1975 will tell the
tale.
Reynold's Chance
1975 should also show whether
Burt Reynolds can sing and dance
(in Peter Bogdanovich's At Long
Last Love), if a movie about a
man-eating shark can be big box
office (Jews) and if it's too soon
for a serious movie to be made
about Tricky Dick and the
Watergate caper ( All the
President's Men).
The two biggest films of 1975
may be about decadence, past and
present The Day of the Locust
and Shampoo. For Arthur Penn
fans, his latest film, The Dark
Tower, should be released
sometime this year, as well as The
Luck of Barry Lyndon, Stanley
Kubrick's first since A Clockwork
Orange.
Clint Eastwood will be back as
both director and star, and even
that Billy Jack mah, Tom
Laughlin, will be up again in 1975
with The Master Gunfighter,
which he will play. Shades of The
Magnificent Seven, it's based on a
Japanese samurai movie.
Eventually all these ideas will
trickle down to television,
suitably sanitized for the lowest
common denominator
mass-audience. Even now,
according to Variety, CBS is
considering a daytime serial
version of Rosemary's Baby and
has bought the film to the book
Helter Skelter, about the maniacal
Manson "family."
So in the race to turn the most
unsavory events into
entertainment, television may
come out ahead in the end, after
all. In any case, 1975 promises to
be a very good year, at least
financially, for movies.
