# Jazz Quartet 'Collectively Improvises'
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
There is a class of jazz
musicians, very much in
prominence now, who allow their
listeners no preconceptions except
that they will hear inspired
musicianship and heady
improvisation.
Such performers as Miles Davis,
McCoy Tyner, Gato Barbieri and
the Art Ensemble of Chicago
usually play long, uninterrupted
sets of music that rely more on
the improvisers' skill than on
familiar melodies to make its
impact.
In the same class belongs the
Jack DeJohnette Quartet, a new
group that had its debut last
weekend at San Francisco's
Keystone Korner. Alex Foster on
saxophones, Peter Warren on
bass, John Abercrombie on guitar
and leader DeJohnette on piano,
tenor sax and drums proved last
night how effective the collective
improvisation format can be.
The quartet's first set began
with a mournful duet between
Foster's alto sax and DeJohnette's
tenor, and the music didn't let up
for an hour and a half. In
between, the title tune from
DeJohnette's forthcoming album
Sorcery, a soft piano-guitar duet
written by Abercrombie for his
first album, and a driving
rock-based melody led by Foster's
powerful alto were set off by
impressive solos from all the
musicians and several periods of
no-holds-barred blowing by the
whole band.
The second set was even longer

and, if anything, more inspired.
Hearing the music move so
beautifully from group
improvisation to a slow ballad
underscored by Abercrombie's
echoplex chords, then to a warm
modal melody played by
DeJohnette on piano with Warren
supplying the bass line with
feeling, then to a spirited
half-sung, half-chanted
DeJohnette vocal and on to a
Foster blues solo, with
DeJohnette's clapping backing
himâ€”if that sounds like a moving
musical trip for the audience, it's
because it certainly was.
Of course, it takes skilled and
open-minded musicians to make a
two-hour set compelling
throughout, but all the members
of the DeJohnette band fit that
description. Warren is far from a
mere time-keeper on bass: in his
hands the instrument is capable of
many different tones, from the
pounding of his most powerful
pizzicato accompaniments to the
sound, like the distant roar of a
waterfall, of his echoplexed
bowed chords.

Few jazz bassists, too, can play
as well with the bow as Warren:
he has the full intonation of a
good classical-music bass player
during his solos.
Fine Alto Sax
Foster is a very young musician
and, I believe, one of the finest
alto saxophonists to emerge in a
long time. He has absorbed the
gigantic influence of John
Coltrane without ever sounding
mimicking. As befits a member of

a band that covers so much
musical ground, his range is
outstanding, and he is quite
capable of following a series of
lightning-fast runs and high
screams with subdued balled
playing that shows perfect
control. He is also fine on tenor
and soprano saxes, and as Foster
develops his own style, he'll be
playing some very important
things.
Abercrombie's story is one of
continued improvement over the
last five years, so that he now
ranks among the very most
capable (and most imitated)
electric guitarists in any field of
music. A recent refugee from Billy
Cobham's band and his tightly
charted arrangements,
Abercrombie is not getting his
first extended chance to vent his
improvising ideas and he does
marvelous things when he plays.
Musical Dialogues
Besides soloing in a highly
personal style, firing out short
phrases and using choppy chords
for stinging effect, Abercrombie is
particularly adept when others are
soloing instead of merely
accompanying, Abercrombie takes
chances, answering the soloist and
engaging him in a musical dialogue
that is the essence of group
interaction.

DeJohnette's drumming, of
course, is familiar to those who
have heard the recordings of Miles
Davis' great 1970-71 band. He is a
soloist of seemingly boundless
energy, and like the handful of

drummers that qualify as his peers
players like Cobham and
Alphonze Mouzon he uses every
piece of his drum kit to
advantage.
His work on piano and tenor
sax, though, was new to me, and a
very pleasant surprise. He uses the
piano in the softer portions of the
music; his solos provide
introspective contrasts to the
sometimes violent surges of his
drummings.
As a bandleader, DeJohnette
has an exceptional sense of
musical direction, and he's taking
his quartet to some great places. If
the group's debut was a good
indication of the paths they're
going to be taking (as I'm sure it
was) this is going to be a great
band, a joy to listen to because
they are so capable, so inventive
and so totally uncompromising.
