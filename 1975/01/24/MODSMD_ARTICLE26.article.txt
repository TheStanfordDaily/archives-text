## Cards May Push Air Force Into The Wild Blue Yonder 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If it really wants to, Stanford's
basketball team will probably be
able to push the scoreboard into
the wild blue yonder of a 30-point
win tonight against the Air Force
Academy.
The Cards might not really
want to. After all, this will be one
of the few games this year when
they can shoot poorly, play
sloppily and still win.
Oh, not that it's a sure thing.
After all, the Falcons, aided by
homer refereeing, actually beat
Stanford in Colorado last year by
a comfortable 75-58 score.
But tonight's 8 p.m. tussle at
Maples (KSFO, 560) represents
about the closest thing to a
breather Stanford has on its
schedule this season.
Consider this: Air Force
doesn't have a man over 6-foot-6.
Not only on the basketball team,
but in school. They don't want
you there, Rich Kelley or Ed
Schweitzer. Too tall for the grand
tradition of American officers.
Not that Rich, Ed or Tim
Patterson ever put bricks on their
heads to keep from growing to an
un-military height. Air Force,
featuring short hair, uniforms,
discipline, just doesn't seem to be
their kind of place.
The basketball team Major
Hank Egan coaches reflects the
school. Despite its Lilliputian
status, the team plays a fighting
defense which last year only
allowed 64.6 points per game.
Will that defense be able to

stop Stanford's tall players? Egan
seems a bit awed. "A main
problem is that Kelley is
remarkably tall, and Schweitzer is
not much shorter from our
perspective." The coach indicated
his team would play a, tight
man-to-man defense.
On offense, the Falcons "will
have to move our people around,
and use sharp passing and
quickness to combat their
[Stanford's] size."
The Falcon hotshot is 6-1
guard Dan Kraft, who averages
19.4 points. A lot of those points
have been picked up against foes
who weren't exactly Melvin
Arterberry on defense. A lot of

Air Force's eight wins (against
four losses) have been picked up
against opponents who weren't
exactly Stanford.
Other Falcon starters include
ballhandling guard Jeff Graves
(6-2) and leading rebounder Jim
Eken (6-4). Eken is a good 6-4
forward. Unfortunately for the
Falcons, the other forwards are
also 6-4.
So that's Air Force, the team
that beat Stanford last season "by
hustling and scrapping all over the
court," Card coach Howie
Dallmar says.
All that scrap, all that hustle,
Won't be enough against
Stanford's muscle.

JAYBlRDâ€”Freshman Jay Carter's shooting form may not be exactly
classic, but it worked Saturday night, as Carter hit all five shots he
took in helping Stanford beat USC 67-66. The 6-3 Carter, well-liked
by Cardinal fans, can play either forward or guard, and will almost
certainly see action tonight against Air Force.
