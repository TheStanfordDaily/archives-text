# Pac-8 Predictions

### 
Our fearful forecaster has
been getting a lot of kidding
this week. Sure, he correctly
picked our Cardinals over
UCLA, but why didn't he
know that USC, too, would fall
to super-smooth Stanford?
Well, uh... no excuse.
This week, there's only one
conference game on tap, an
interesting Saturday afternoon
TV special with Oregon at
Oregon State.
We've seen both teams on
their home grounds and there's
little doubt Oregon is a lot
better - so we'll pick them
despite the fact they'll be
playing in Corvallis.
Stanford, meanwhile, plays
a couple ho-hummers. We
suppose that superior talent and

a home crowd will be enough
to lead the Cardinals over tiny
Air Force. Even with talent,
the Air Force couldn't beat
North Vietnam.
Houston is something of an
enigma. The team is woefully
inconsistent, with a strong
offense and no defense. We'll
pick Houston, in part as a
protest against Stanford ever
scheduling this dumb Monday
night game which for little
reason, forces the players to
miss classes.
Predictions
Stanford 96, Air Force 71

Oregon 67, Oregon St. 63
Notre Dame 78, UCLA 75
