# Ski Team Enjoys Best Of Both Worlds
## 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
Spring seems to have arrived
early in the Bay Area this year,
but to the 45 members of the
Stanford ski team the winter ski
season is just beginning.
The team enjoys the best of
both seasons, staying on campus
during the week and using the
weekends to train on the slopes of
Slide Mountain, located near
Reno.
The first meet of the season for
the skiers is the Nevada Carnival
Feb. 1 at Mount Rose, Nevada.
Nevada-Reno will host the
meet.
The Nevada school is the
defending conference champion in
a league consisting of three other
Universities— Stanford, UC-Davis
and California; as well as five
two-year colleges— Sierra, Feather
River, Columbia, Menlo and
College of the Siskiyous.
Competition will be held in
two alpine events, slalom and
giant slalom, and in two Nordic
events, the nine-kilometer
cross-country race and the
50-meter ski jump.
Stanford coach Skip Stritter
has dependable junior Mark

Colville returning. The team's
leading point winner last year and
the best all-around performer on
the team, Colville consistently
places well in the alpine, •
cross-country and ski jumping
events.
In the alpine events, Stritter
can count on co-captains Tom
Hutton, a sophomore, and Dave
Horth, a junior.
In 1974, the ski team did not *
have varsity standing, and so the
team and its members were
ineligible for NCAA championship
competition. This season,
however, the team has been
granted associate varsity ranking,
which makes Stanford eligible for i
the national meet.
Freshman Dave Herbert has
also made the varsity squad and
"shows real promise" according to
Stritter.
Sophomore Steve Lindbeck
will add depth in the Nordic
events, while another sophomore,
Tom Merchant, also should help
the team. Two promising
freshmen Kit Weld and Rusty
Schwartz.
Frosh Missy Taylor has earned
a spot on the men's squad of 10
competitors. The past two seasons
she has skied on the women's
Can-Am squad, which is only
several classifications down from
the U.S. women's national ski
team.
She is taking advantage of a <
recent NCAA rule change that
now allows women to compete on
men's teams. Taylor has a good
chance of winning a few men's
races this season.
"The program seems to be
looking up from past years," says {
Stritter. "We've been able to get
our older racers to stay on longer.
Both Dave Horth and Mark
Colville are third-year men on the
team. Although we don't have any,
seniors on the team, I'm still very
hopeful for a very good season." ,
Assistant coach "Wild" Bill
Gibson adds that "seven years
ago, the team consisted of about
10 members whereas today we
have 45. The team seems to be
getting better each year."
After the Nevada Carnival, 1
Stanford will compete in the
Cal-sponsored Vanderbilt Cup at
Squaw Valley Feb. 8, the Pacific
Coast Championships (PCC's)
Feb. 22 at Squaw and the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Invitational
(NCII's) March 1.
The PCC's teams and
individuals will qualify for the
NCAA skiing championships at
Purgatory, Colo., to be held
March 5-9. Stanford must finish
first or second in the PCC's to
earn a trip to Purgatory.
Gibson says that the Stanford
ski team has been around for a
long time and that "Stanford even
won the PCC's way back in
1951."
