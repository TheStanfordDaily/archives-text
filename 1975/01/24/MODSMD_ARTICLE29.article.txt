# Card Spikers At Examiner Games
## 
### 
Stanford's 1975 track season
unofficially gets underway
tonight, when Payton Jordan
leads a contingent of 10 Cards in
the 12th Annual San Francisco
Examiner Indoor Games at the
Cow Palace.
But the Cards have their work
cut out for them, as all three
world record breakers from last
week's Sunkist Games in Los
Angeles will compete in the meet.
Junior college transfer Bob
Flint faces a loaded Cow Palace
pole vault field. Flint (16-6%) will
be competing against Dan Ripley
of San Jose State, who last week

vaulted 18-1 to set a new indoor
record.
Others in the field include
former indoor (17-10V4) and
outdoor (18-4%) world record
holder Kjell Isaksson, last year's
leading indoor winner and former
Stanford vaulter Casey Carrigan
(17-8%) and reigning National
AAU indoor champ Bob Richards
Jr. (17-6).
Freshman James Lofton, last
year's California High School
Long Jump champion (24-4%)
will compete against a field which
includes seven men who have
cleared 25-0. 1972 Olympian

Tommy Haynes (26-8 1 /2), now of
the U.S. Army, leads the field.
Stanford will also enter a team
of Alan Sheets, Reggie Mason,
Lofton and Scott Wingo in the
Invitational mile relay. The Cards
had won two consecutive mile
relays until California upset them
last year.
"We're ready to run," said
Jordan. "They're excited. They'll
be in the best type of competition
possible."
Jordan himself will go for his
fourth consecutive seniors 60-yard
dash victory tonight.
