# Suit To Be Filed Today In Parking Fee Dispute
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
The Escondido Village Council and
the ASSU will seek an injunction
today to prevent campus police from
ticketing student vehicles without
parking stickers, Council President
Kathy Colson said yesterday.
She added that a suit will be filed in
court on behalf of all students who
wish to challenge their parking
citations.
After meeting with Palo Alto
attorney Dent Hand yesterday, Colson
said he had advised the two student
groups to collect parking citations
from each student who wishes to be
represented in court.

Students may either bring their
tickets to the ASSU office or to
Colson's apartment, Escondido 62C. A
record will be kept of every citation
received.
Colson said attorneys have not
decided whether to file individual suits
or one class action suit.
"For every suit we file," Colson
explained, "there has to be a Stanford
policeman there to respond to the
charges. If we file individual suits, the
proceedings would take a lot of time
for the police force. It saves time and
trouble if we file a class action suit.
Massive Numbers
"I don't think the Santa Clara
County courts are going to be too
pleased if they are suddenly presented
with these massive numbers of parking
tickets," she added. "After a while it's
just going to get ridiculous."
Colson reiterated that the ASSU
funds are for legal costs only. Neither
the ASSU or the Council will pay any
student's parking fines. She also
emphasized that court action was only
on behalf of citations for parking
stickers.
"If students also get cited for
parking in a red zone or something,
that's their problem. We're only
fighting these stickers," she said.
Wide Range
Police issued 239 parking citations
Wednesday, Director of Police Services
Marvin Herrington said. Of those, 185
were for cars not having parking
stickers. During the high traffic
months of fall and winter quarter last
year, Herrington said a daily average of
only 100 citations were issued,
covering a wide range of violations.
Herrington said police would still
continue to ticket all cars without
parking stickers. "We're trying to
cover the entire campus. Then we'll
just start over again."
Cars in some parking lots, including
Storey, were ticketed both Wednesday
and again yesterday. .
Owners' Knowledge
Herrington cautioned that students
should not take it upon themselves to
remove parking tickets from vehicles
without the owners' knowledge, such
as someone calling himself "Santa" did
Wednesday, delivering 36 parking

tickets to the Daily office.
"Whoever did that may think
they're making our job harder, but
actually they're only jeopardizing the
students," he explained. "By the time
the violators are notifed by mail, the
fine will have already doubled."
Colson maintained yesterday that
"Santa" was not acting on behalf of
the Escondido Village Council or the
ASSU.
Increased Fine
Herrington added that students
who just ignore the citation will face
an increased fine and a bench warrant
will be issued for their arrest. "The
fine will just keep doubling," he said.
Should a student be stopped later
for another violation, he or she may be
taken into custody until the parking
fine is paid. If a student doesn't get
stopped, his or her California license
renewal will be held until the fine is
paid.
"If you want to fight it,"
Herrington said, "challenge it in court.
Don't ignore it."
Public Hearings
Meanwhile, Peter Carpenter,
assistant vice president for medical
affairs, has announced plans for eight
public hearings between Jan. 30 and
Feb. 13, designed to get public input
into his study of parking problems and
alternatives.
The one-hour meetings are
scheduled as follows: Jan. 30, 4 p.m.,
Bishop Auditorium (faculty); Jan. 31,
noon, Room 214 (staff); Feb. 3, 7
p.m., Donner Lounge (on-campus
students); Feb. 4, 7 p.m., place to be
arranged (Escondido Village residents);
Feb. 5, 7 p.m., Florence Moore main
lounge (on-campus students); Feb. 6, 7
p.m., Meyer Forum Room
(non-drivers); Feb. 11, 7 p.m. Meyer
Forum Room (off-campus students);
and Feb. 13, time and place to be
arranged (Stanford homeowners).
Carpenter is also asking for written
statements from the Stanford
community. They may be sent to him
at M-121 in the Medical Center.
Carpenter said some possible
alternatives to the current situation
include: abolition of all parking
regulations; parking meters; and a
fixed, universal parking fee.

renewal will be held until the fine is
paid.
"If you want to fight it,"
Herrington said, "challenge it in court.
Don't ignore it."
Public Hearings
Meanwhile, Peter Carpenter,
assistant vice president for medical
affairs, has announced plans for eight
public hearings between Jan. 30 and
Feb. 13, designed to get public input
into his study of parking problems and
alternatives.
The one-hour meetings are
scheduled as follows: Jan. 30, 4 p.m.,
Bishop Auditorium (faculty); Jan. 31,
noon, Room 214 (staff); Feb. 3, 7
p.m., Donner Lounge (on-campus
students); Feb. 4, 7 p.m., place to be
arranged (Escondido Village residents);
Feb. 5, 7 p.m., Florence Moore main
lounge (on-campus students); Feb. 6, 7
p.m., Meyer Forum Room
(non-drivers); Feb. 11, 7 p.m. Meyer
Forum Room (off-campus students);
and Feb. 13, time and place to be
arranged (Stanford homeowners).
Carpenter is also asking for written
statements from the Stanford
community. They may be sent to him
at M-121 in the Medical Center.
Carpenter said some possible
alternatives to the current situation
include: abolition of all parking
regulations; parking meters; and a
fixed, universal parking fee.
The Escondido Village Council and
the ASSU will seek an injunction
today to prevent campus police from
ticketing student vehicles without
parking stickers, Council President
Kathy Colson said yesterday.
She added that a suit will be filed in
court on behalf of all students who
wish to challenge their parking
citations.
After meeting with Palo Alto
attorney Dent Hand yesterday, Colson
said he had advised the two student
groups to collect parking citations
from each student who wishes to be
represented in court.

Students may either bring their
tickets to the ASSU office or to
Colson's apartment, Escondido 62C. A
record will be kept of every citation
received.
Colson said attorneys have not
decided whether to file individual suits
or one class action suit.
"For every suit we file," Colson
explained, "there has to be a Stanford
policeman there to respond to the
charges. If we file individual suits, the
proceedings would take a lot of time
for the police force. It saves time and
trouble if we file a class action suit.
Massive Numbers
"I don't think the Santa Clara
County courts are going to be too
pleased if they are suddenly presented
with these massive numbers of parking
tickets," she added. "After a while it's
just going to get ridiculous."
Colson reiterated that the ASSU
funds are for legal costs only. Neither
the ASSU or the Council will pay any
student's parking fines. She also
emphasized that court action was only
on behalf of citations for parking
stickers.
"If students also get cited for
parking in a red zone or something,
that's their problem. We're only
fighting these stickers," she said.
Wide Range
Police issued 239 parking citations
Wednesday, Director of Police Services
Marvin Herrington said. Of those, 185
were for cars not having parking
stickers. During the high traffic
months of fall and winter quarter last
year, Herrington said a daily average of
only 100 citations were issued,
covering a wide range of violations.
Herrington said police would still
continue to ticket all cars without
parking stickers. "We're trying to
cover the entire campus. Then we'll
just start over again."
Cars in some parking lots, including
Storey, were ticketed both Wednesday
and again yesterday. .
Owners' Knowledge
Herrington cautioned that students
should not take it upon themselves to
remove parking tickets from vehicles
without the owners' knowledge, such
as someone calling himself "Santa" did
Wednesday, delivering 36 parking

tickets to the Daily office.
"Whoever did that may think
they're making our job harder, but
actually they're only jeopardizing the
students," he explained. "By the time
the violators are notifed by mail, the
fine will have already doubled."
Colson maintained yesterday that
"Santa" was not acting on behalf of
the Escondido Village Council or the
ASSU.
Increased Fine
Herrington added that students
who just ignore the citation will face
an increased fine and a bench warrant
will be issued for their arrest. "The
fine will just keep doubling," he said.
Should a student be stopped later
for another violation, he or she may be
taken into custody until the parking
fine is paid. If a student doesn't get
stopped, his or her California license
renewal will be held until the fine is
paid.

Herrington said, "challenge it in court.

months of fall and winter quarter last
year, Herrington said a daily average of
only 100 citations were issued,
covering a wide range of violations.
Herrington said police would still
continue to ticket all cars without
parking stickers. "We're trying to
cover the entire campus. Then we'll
just start over again."
Cars in some parking lots, including
Storey, were ticketed both Wednesday
and again yesterday. .
Owners' Knowledge
Herrington cautioned that students
should not take it upon themselves to
remove parking tickets from vehicles
without the owners' knowledge, such
as someone calling himself "Santa" did
Wednesday, delivering 36 parking

tickets to the Daily office.
"Whoever did that may think
they're making our job harder, but
actually they're only jeopardizing the
students," he explained. "By the time
the violators are notifed by mail, the
fine will have already doubled."
Colson maintained yesterday that
"Santa" was not acting on behalf of
the Escondido Village Council or the
ASSU.
Increased Fine
Herrington added that students
who just ignore the citation will face
an increased fine and a bench warrant
will be issued for their arrest. "The
fine will just keep doubling," he said.
Should a student be stopped later
for another violation, he or she may be
taken into custody until the parking
fine is paid. If a student doesn't get
stopped, his or her California license
renewal will be held until the fine is
paid.
"If you want to fight it,"
Herrington said, "challenge it in court.
Don't ignore it."
Public Hearings
Meanwhile, Peter Carpenter,
assistant vice president for medical
affairs, has announced plans for eight
public hearings between Jan. 30 and
Feb. 13, designed to get public input
into his study of parking problems and
alternatives.
The one-hour meetings are
scheduled as follows: Jan. 30, 4 p.m.,
Bishop Auditorium (faculty); Jan. 31,
noon, Room 214 (staff); Feb. 3, 7
p.m., Donner Lounge (on-campus
students); Feb. 4, 7 p.m., place to be
arranged (Escondido Village residents);
Feb. 5, 7 p.m., Florence Moore main
lounge (on-campus students); Feb. 6, 7
p.m., Meyer Forum Room
(non-drivers); Feb. 11, 7 p.m. Meyer
Forum Room (off-campus students);
and Feb. 13, time and place to be
arranged (Stanford homeowners).
Carpenter is also asking for written
statements from the Stanford
community. They may be sent to him
at M-121 in the Medical Center.
Carpenter said some possible
alternatives to the current situation
include: abolition of all parking
regulations; parking meters; and a
fixed, universal parking fee.
