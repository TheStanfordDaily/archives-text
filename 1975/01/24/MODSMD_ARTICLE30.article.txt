# Ruggers Face Tough XO's
## 
### 
Stanford's ruggers face their
toughest match of the season
tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 p.m.,
when they take on the XO's on
Harry Maloney Field.
The Cards have run wild the
last two weeks, scoring over 30
points against relatively easy
teams. Tomorrow's game kicks off
a five-week stretch against the
toughest teams in the Northern
California Rugby Union and
coach Pete Kmetovic sees a rough
road ahead. "Without a doubt,
tomorrow's game will be the
toughest of the season. The XO's
are one of the toughest teams
because of their experience."
Three XO ruggers have

international playing experience.
Prop Mike Ording played on two
U.S. touring teams with teammate
Jack Alustiza. Ex-Stanford rugger
Gene Moffet also played on one
U.S. touring team.
Kmetovic says that the Cards
are going to have to make better
use of their scoring opportunities,
because they won't have the ball
as much. "We're going to have to
follow up much more and play
better defense, because we won't
be dominating the ball like we did
the past couple of games.
"They scored 40 points against
Davis while we scored 37 so it
should be a fairly close contest,"
Kmetovic predicts.
