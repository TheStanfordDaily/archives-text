# Swimmers Host Improving UOP
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
It won't be the biggest meet of
the year, but the races will still be
good when Stanford's swimmers
move into action tomorrow
against non-league rival UOP at 1
p.m. at DeGuerre Pool.
The Tigers, though not really
# in Stanford's class, are nonetheless
"a pretty good team," swim coach
Jim Gaughran says. "We'll have
some pretty good races here, and
I'd say that just about everyone
will have to swim in their usual
event." He notes that the Tigers
_are just coming off a good
performance against Long Beach
State.
The Cards, on the other hand,
are just coming off a
heartbreaking 58-55 loss at the
hands of Washington, and one
might expect them to be
# somewhat flat.
"I don't think we'll be down,"
says Gaughran, "mainly because
nearly all of the swimmers had
real good times against
Washington, and they know that
they only lost by a little bit."
Gaughran also pointed out that
* "it's no disgrace to lose to
Washington, especially in our first
dual meet, which is always a
tough one."
Sacrifices
The loss to Washington does
not bother Gaughran too much.
• "We really mainly try to look
forward to the NCAA's," he says,
which means that something must
be sacrificed during the dual meet
season.
The psychological aspect of
swimming is perhaps the most
intriguing component of the
♦ sport, for it is doubtful that any
other sport features the grueling
monotony of lap after lap in an
unchanging blue-tinted world.
How does Gaughran, as a coach,
attempt to cope with the
problem?
0 "Variety is basically the way I
try to break it up," he says. "We
very seldom do the same workout.

I usually try and do the yardage in
as many different combinations as
possible."
Interesting Workouts
Gaughran also tries "to keep
the workouts interesting by giving
the swimmers something to think
about during workout." That
"something" to think about is
usually the swimmer's time,
stroke, timing, etc.
One way to accomplish variety
is to use such tactics as "negative
splits" (swimming the second half
of the yardage faster than the
first) and "broken sets" (for
example, instead of swimming
200 yards, the swimmer breaks it
into four 50-yard sprints).
No matter what Gaughran
does, however, he is still faced
with the problem familiar to all
swim coaches. As one swimmer
put it, "10,000 meters is 10,000
meters."
