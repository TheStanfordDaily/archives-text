# IM Roundup: Soccer Has New Look
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
More and more women are
competing in intramurals this
year, particularly in non-contact
sports such as tennis, volleyball
and table tennis. However, this
winter, for the first time, an
all-woman team is competing in
the unlikely sport of soccer.
IM soccer is hardly the
disciplined game played by varsity
squads around the country and
world. Rather, it is a rougher, less
formal game which can often
deteriorate into football with
goals instead of touchdowns.
Into this previously all-male
world comes a team dubbed the
Women's Center, captained by
Allison Brown. This hardy band
of Stanford women made its
debut last Saturday morning
against a surprised bunch of

fellows from El Tigre eating club.
Unfortunately for the ladies, the
gentlemep, who were quite
gentlemanly, regained their
composure and prevailed 3-0.
This week, the Women's Center
team will try to regroup its
defense and improve its offense
before they tackle, so to speak,
Faisan, a 5-0 winner over Harvard
last week. Game time for the
affair is 11 a.m. tomorrow on
soccer field five.
Pete the Greek refuses to
predict this one because he
doesn't want to be called sexist.
In other IM soccer news, last

year's champions, the Bachacs,
returned in grand style, winning
their first two games by shutouts.
The opener was a 12-0 rout over
the Zetes (12-0 in soccer is about
equivalent to 108-62 in basketball
Stanford vs. Denver, 1974).
The Bachacs followed with a
3-0 whitewash of the KA-Delt
combine.
Elsewhere, Twain took the Ski
Team 6-0 and last year's
runner-up Education was forced
to forfeit its first game. Though
the Ski Team won it in regular
time, it was caught using a former
Stanford soccer letterman and the

game was forfeited.
In basketball news, a team
entitled "Search and Destroy,"
composed of former varsity player
Marty Moroski and several other
players who turned out for the
varsity and didn't make it, appears
to be the early odds-on favorite to
win the A basketball
championship.
Last year's winners, the
Plumbers, are all in jail and won't
be able to compete. Several other
teams look like they'll be tough,
including the DU's (featuring the
entire Stanford football team),
the Phi Delts and the Theta Delts.

returned in grand style, winning
their first two games by shutouts.
The opener was a 12-0 rout over
the Zetes (12-0 in soccer is about
equivalent to 108-62 in basketball
Stanford vs. Denver, 1974).
The Bachacs followed with a
3-0 whitewash of the KA-Delt
combine.
Elsewhere, Twain took the Ski
Team 6-0 and last year's
runner-up Education was forced
to forfeit its first game. Though
the Ski Team won it in regular
time, it was caught using a former
Stanford soccer letterman and the

game was forfeited.
In basketball news, a team
entitled "Search and Destroy,"
composed of former varsity player
Marty Moroski and several other
players who turned out for the
varsity and didn't make it, appears
to be the early odds-on favorite to
win the A basketball
championship.
Last year's winners, the
Plumbers, are all in jail and won't
be able to compete. Several other
teams look like they'll be tough,
including the DU's (featuring the
entire Stanford football team),
the Phi Delts and the Theta Delts.
More and more women are
competing in intramurals this
year, particularly in non-contact
sports such as tennis, volleyball
and table tennis. However, this
winter, for the first time, an
all-woman team is competing in
the unlikely sport of soccer.
IM soccer is hardly the
disciplined game played by varsity
squads around the country and
world. Rather, it is a rougher, less
formal game which can often
deteriorate into football with
goals instead of touchdowns.
Into this previously all-male
world comes a team dubbed the
Women's Center, captained by
Allison Brown. This hardy band
of Stanford women made its
debut last Saturday morning
against a surprised bunch of

fellows from El Tigre eating club.
Unfortunately for the ladies, the
gentlemep, who were quite
gentlemanly, regained their
composure and prevailed 3-0.
This week, the Women's Center
team will try to regroup its
defense and improve its offense
before they tackle, so to speak,
Faisan, a 5-0 winner over Harvard
last week. Game time for the
affair is 11 a.m. tomorrow on
soccer field five.
Pete the Greek refuses to
predict this one because he
doesn't want to be called sexist.
