# Superb In UCSB Match
## Wrestlers Set Win Record 
### MARK FUNK 
Led by Craig Reynolds, Mark
Yancey and John Govea, the
Stanford wrestling team picked up
its 10th win of the year yesterday
and established a new single
season win mark as it upended
Barbara 29-18 in Encina
Gym.
And for head coach Joe
DeMeo, the record setter was one
to savor.
"The whole team wrestled
extremely well," DeMeo lauded
after the match. "UCSB has some
excellent talent, but the guys
really wanted this one bad."
Tlie coach is prone to roaring
Roman understatement. They
wanted it worse than that.
Reynolds set Stanford mat
enthusiasts buzzing with a
convincing second-round pin of
the Gauchos' Jay Lawson. He set
the tone of the match. "This
Lawson kid is a good wrestler,"
DeMeo said. "He came into the
match with a 9-2 record."
But Reynolds, who weighs in

at 167, proved just how much
records can mean out on the mat.
Very little. He had Lawson in
trouble the entire match, playing
with his opponent until the fall.
Reynolds has improved
tremendously since the start of
the season and has been
instrumental in the Cards' drive
for the win record.
Another key Stanford wrestler,
Ken Krebs, sat out the match at
the 142-pound weight division,
but the Cards didn't lose a thing.
Yancey, who won last year's
Outstanding Stanford Wrestler
award, stepped in ably and scored
a major decision over UCSB's
Gary Fenzle. The final score was
13-1.
"Mark moved well today,"
DeMeo commented. "We don't
lose a thing with him in the
lineup."
Well indeed. The win over
Fenzle was one of the Stanford
sophomore's best performances of
the year.
And if Cardinal fans who filled
Encina Gym were buzzing after
those two wins, they went
absolutely berserk after Roy Tolles
and John Govea finished off their
opponents. Let it be said that the
Cards captured the new record in
style.

On the strength of a strong
second period, Tolles moved to a
5-0 lead midway through the
match and held on to defeat the
Gauchos* John McNally 6-1.
Tolles, too, has looked good of
late. Except for a disappointing
loss against Oregon, the
177-pounder looks like he is
beginning to round into shape for
the upcoming Pacific Eight
tournament in February.
And so are some of the other
Cards, particularly John Govea,
who has looked good at 190
pounds all season. He didn't let
anybody down yesterday, either,
as he slapped UCSB's Craig
Eubank to the mat in 6:24 of the
third round. Govea had built up a
good lead before ending the
contest.
By that time, the Stanford
victory was salted away. But Art
Estrada and Gaucho heavyweight
George Menten put on an
entertaining match. It almost
ended at :12 seconds of the first
round when Estrada, a Stanford
football player in the off-season,
threw Menten into the cheap
seats.
But Menten recovered and
pinned the Stanford heavy at 7:59
of the third round. There are eight
minutes in a regulation match.
