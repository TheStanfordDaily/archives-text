Simon Asks Increase In Federal Debt
WASHINGTON Treasury Secretary William E. Simon
asked Congress yesterday for an increase in the federal debt
limit to $604 billion to help finance federal budget deficits
of $35 billion this year and $5O billion next year.
The increase would amount to $lO9 billion, or 22
percent, above the current temporary debt ceiling of $495
billion, which is scheduled to expire on March 31.
In asking for the higher debt ceiling Simon also spoke of
dangers in continued heavy government borrowing.
Simon testified before the House Ways and Means
Committee.
Committee Chairman A1 Ullman (D-Ore.), called the
debt limit request a "shocking figure ... It looks like a
fiscal system out of control."
Rebates Spur Auto Sales Rise
DETROIT Auto sales in mid-January were 41 percent
higher than in the first 10 days of the month, apparently
because of rebate sales schemes instituted to help unload a
backlog of unsold vehicles.
However, sales in the Jan. 11-20 period remained 15.4
percent below those 10 days last year and were the lowest
for that period in 14 years. Sales for the first 10 days in
January had been the lowest for the period in more than
two decades.
The four major car companies reported yesterday that
sales in mid-January were 131,132, compared with 155,004
in the same 1974 span and 93,235 in the first 10 days of
1975. The daily selling rate of 16,391 was the worst since
1961, when the daily rate was 14,851.
Oil Exporting Countries Meet
ALGIERS - Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum

Exporting Countries meet here today to reassess their
long-range objectives in light of the industrialized nations'
growing economic problems.
Algeria's government newspaper said the session also
comes at a time when Western financial policies are
threatening to turn Arab dollar reserves into "so much
monkey money."
Some sources said Algerian President Houari
Boumedienne is likely to urge the ministers to expand
OPEC into a vast cartel of raw material producing nations.
Such a step could ultimately give the world's poor
nations a potential stranglehold over the economies of the
non-Communist industrialized countries.
Meany Proposes Aid Cut-Off To Arabs
WASHINGTON Blaming much of America's economic
woes on high oil prices, AFL-CIO President George Meany
proposed yesterday that the U.S. cut off Arab aid and
embargo Middle East oil imports until prices drop.
"No tribute, no foreign aid, no trade, no jet fighters
nothing, until the blackmail stops," Meany declared at a
summit meeting of AFL-CIO leaders representing all 110
affiliated unions.
He said that while such a move would require the nation
to adopt strict fuel allocation and rationing programs, it
would be "a small price to pay to avoid total economic
collapse and take America's economic destiny out of the
hands of the Arab sheiks."
Guerrillas Crackdown On Extremists
BEIRUT, Lebanon Palestinian guerrillas have
announced a crackdown on their extremist fringe to avert a
confrontation with the Lebanese army and stem criticism
of their disciplinary problems.
Yasir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization said
yesterday it had arrested five guerrilla renegades who fired
rockets at the Lebanese army garrison in Tyre. It did not
say what punishment was planned.
Assassination Tools Offered
WASHINGTON - - A Virginia electronics firm attempted
to sell the U.S. government a variety of assassination
devices for use in covert operations overseas, according to
documents obtained by Sen. Lowell P. Weicker (R-Conn.).
The devices, designed to carry explosives in such
unlikely places as cigarette packs, flashlights and cameras,
were displayed on at least one occasion to Lucien Conein, a
former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official who is
now with the Drug Envorcement Administration (DEA),
Weicker said yesterday.
