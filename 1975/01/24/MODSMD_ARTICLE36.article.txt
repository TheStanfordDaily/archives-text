# Franklin Suit Survives Challenge
## 
### 
Fired English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin won an initial
fight against the University of Colorado Board of Regents
Wednesday when a federal judge refused to dismiss a suit
against the school for its refusal to hire him as an
instructor.
U.S. District Court Judge Alfred A. Arraj rejected a
motion by the regents to dismiss the suit filed by a group of
university students who wanted Franklin hired.
The regents twice rejected Franklin as an English
instructor at the Boulder campus by identical 8-1 votes in
April and June last year.
Franklin, an avowed Maoist, was fired by Stanford in
1972 for allegedly inciting students to violence during
campus disturbances in 1971. He is considered an expert on
author Herman Melville and on science fiction.
The lawsuit charges that he was refused the post at
Colorado because of his political beliefs. Franklin is
teaching at Yale and Wesleyan Universities this semester
under a fellowship.
