# Senate OK's Budget Study
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Creation of a task force to study
long-term Financial problems facing
the University was approved
unanimously yesterday by the Faculty
Senate.
The task force has the option of
recommending that a committee be set
up to supplement work of the Budget
Priorities Advisory Commission
(BPAC).
It is not, however, intended to
replace the commission, said Human
Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh, who
originally recommended creating the
task force.
"There was never any intention ...
[to] show any lack of confidence in

the president's commission. The
Senate should mobilize itself ... [in]
an unhurried examination of long-term
problems. I sincerely believe the
Senate should become involved
formally in the decisions that lie
ahead," Pittendrigh noted.
Senate Chairman Gordon Craig
agreed.
'Operations Research'
"The Senate must begin a sort of
operations research job on what the
problems will be in the future," Craig,
a history professor, remarked.
Sociology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch
earlier had presented an amendment to
the Senate's charge to the task force,
which would request the BPAC to

report regularly on its activities to the
Senate.
"[lt] commits neither the ...
commission nor the Senate to do
anything to act" Dornbusch
asserted. "But it does place the Senate
closer to the flow of information."
Relevant Information
President Richard Lyman then
assured senators that providing
relevant information from the BPAC
would not place an undue burden on
the Administration, and that he would
help keep lines of communication
open between the commission and the
Senate.
"I would be glad to commit myself
... to remove any inhibitions or
frustrations in the way of members of
the Senate's getting information from
the commission," Lyman pledged.
Pittendrigh said he hoped the
resolutions he introduced supporting
creation of the task force would put
budgeting priorities in perspective.
Fiscal Crisis
"They constitute nothing but what
the faculty .. . believes should not be
lost sight of in the fiscal crisis ahead,"
he argued.
Also at the Senate meeting, Provost
William Miller revealed that severe
budget cuts may be forthcoming for
the Overseas Campus Program.
