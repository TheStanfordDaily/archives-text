# Moses Will Resign Post As Dean Of Grad Studies
## 
### 
Lincoln Moses will resign his
position .as dean of graduate studies
effective at the end of summer
quarter, Provost William Miller
announced yesterday/
Moses, who was appointed dean in
spring of 1969, will be on leave next
year, then will resume his teaching
duties. â€¢
"In September of 1965,1 first went
into administration, as associate dean
[of Humanities and Science] . . . but
deep down inside, I'm a professor,"
Moses remarked last night.
He will spend 1975-76 working at
Stanford's Center for Advanced Study

in the Behavioral Sciences, then will
return to teach in the Statistics and
Family, Community and Preventive
Medicine Departments. i
In his tenure as dean, one of the
most controversial issues involving
Moses concerned possible
authorization of a genetics course to
be taught by Electrical Engineering
Prof. William Shockley.
Shockley, a Nobel laureate, has
sparked debate because of his claims
that race and intelligence are related.
He attempted to debate his views last
year while on a nationwide speaking
tour, but was shouted down or
prevented from speaking at several
Eastern colleges.
In June 1971, Shockley requested
permission to teach a graduate special
course, to be called "The Dysgenic
Question: New Research Methodology
on Human Behavior, Genetics, and
Racial Differences."
After nearly a year of discussing
possible reasons for allowing the
course, Moses announced that he
would refuse to authorize it. Chairmen
of the Departments of Genetics,
Psychology and Biology had refused to
include the course in their offerings,
and advisers to Moses had
unanimously opposed giving the
course credit.
Miller said the Committee on
Graduate Studies will probably also
act as the search committee to find a
replacement for Moses.
