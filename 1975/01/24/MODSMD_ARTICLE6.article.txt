# Sher Supports Chamber Plan
## City Backs Commuting Cut 
### JON BIGELOW 
The City of Palo Alto and the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce have
announced the start of a new "Leave
Your Car at Home" program intended
to encourage more people to walk,
organize carpools or ride bicycles to
work instead of driving alone.
"With both a significant population
and a multitude of activity centers
concentrated in a relatively small area,
satisfactory transportation for each
individual in his own vehicle is
becoming seriously constrained," said
Mayor Byron Sher, a Stanford law
professor.
He added that "although our
expectations have been that freeways,
streets and parking facilities will
expand to meet our needs, traffic
demand is now exceeding the space
available."
"The switch to alternative
transportation modes I am proposing
now on a voluntary basis will
undoubtedly become necessary or
mandatory in the very near future
because of energy and air quality
problems," Sher said.
Sher and his colleagues on the City
Council have repeatedly gone on
record to support "disincentives" to
automobile use and to encourage
improved mass transit. "The
improvement in, and significant public
use of, public transportation is of vital
importance to the program's success,"
said Sher.
The mayor said he will ask major
employers to provide information for
their employees concerning bus routes,
and to install bulletin boards in an
effort to encourage the organization of
car pools. He will also ask such
employers to "re-evaluate their
parking requirements and to start to
develop plans to reduce the space
required for long-term parking."
Sher continued, "Serious
commitments to alternative types of
transportation will be required in the
future by all segments of the
community presently using large areas
for all-day parking."
"All of us must begin to change our
total dependency upon the private
vehicle," said Sher.
