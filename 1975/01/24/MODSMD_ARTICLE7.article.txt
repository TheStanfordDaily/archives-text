SAN JOSE As officers arrested
dozens of his supporters, convict
Ruchell Magee was sentenced
yesterday to life imprisonment in
connection with the 1970 Marin
County Courthouse escape attempt
which left four men dead.
Once sentenced, Magee shook his
shackled arms and cried, "Angela
Davis is a pig, a rat, a snitch, a dirty,
snitching rat." He did not explain his
outburst.
But Davis, a black Communist
militant who was originally slated to
be Magee's co-defendant, had her case
severed and was acquitted of murder,
kidnap and conspiracy in a 1972 trial
here.
Twenty-nine protesters picketed
the Santa Clara County Courthouse
shouting, "Free Ruchell. It's right to
rebel."
Twice sheriff's deputies requested
the generally peaceful gathering to
disperse, and then about 40

club-carrying officers arrested them on
misdemeanor charges of demonstrating
within sight or sound of a court house.
No violence or injuries were reported.
Three Stanford students and a 1974
graduate were among those arrested.
Students Cynthia Elliott, Katherine
Brady and Ann Schwartz and graduate
Carl Wingo were released on bail early
last evening.
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge William A. Ingram imposed a
life sentence on the 35-year-old black
convict for the aggravated kidnaping
charge which Magee pleaded guilty to
last May.
Magee serving a life prison
sentence at San Quentin for a $lO Los
Angeles kidnap-robbery in 1963 had
tried unsuccessfully to withdraw his
guilty plea.
"He will be in prison forever, unless
the prison system changes," deputy
public defender Richard Such told
reporters after the sentencing. He said
Magee would be eligible for parole in
seven years.
