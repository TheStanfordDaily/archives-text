### 
Another Reason?
Editor:
In the Jan. 21 Daily,
Bruce Franklin said that he was
fired from Stanford "merely
because he criticized the
American invasion of Indochina."
However, during the period in
question the vast majority of the
faculty also "criticized the
American invasion of Indochina";
yet nobody else was fired. So it
must have been something else.
That "something else" was that
Franklin, alone among his peers,
sought to deny to others the
freedoms which he claimed for
himself, and urged illegal acts and
violence within the University
community as means to achieve
his end. The Advisory Board
which conducted extensive
hearings on the Franklin case
agreed unanimously on these
facts, even though the members
split five to two on the issue of
what penalty to impose.

The Journalistic Mark'
Editor:
In this age of journalistic
objectivity bolstered by the
Watergate-inspired ethic for truth
in reporting, I find the Jan. 16
article by Terrance Kenny to be
astounding, if not objectionable.
While I do not quibble with his
idealism, I do take issue with his
sophomoric attempts to sway
opinion by substituting saccharine
emotionalism for some credible
documentation.
I find it hard to believe his
implications that all who are
deserters and draft evaders did so
"in opposing an unjust war on the
part of the United States
government." I'd like to know
how many voted with their feet
for reasons other than the United
States' involvement in Indochina.
The rigors and uncertainties of
military life, family separation,
criminal charges, unfavorable
orders all may be plausible
alternative explanations for why
someone dropped out of the
system.
Show me some convincing
data. I am only amused when I am
advised, "Do not allow this forced
exile of exceptional men to fade
into uncomfortable memory,"
when I consider that this exile
may have been self-imposed
because someone could not get
used to the idea of saluting.

I note that the Daily persists in
making no mention of the men
who said "yes." Veterans' Day
went unnoticed, even though
there was apt coverage of a
carnival-atmosphere
demonstration against the two
Marines who happened to be
interviewing candidates at the
Placement Center. Surely the
decision for many who served was
just as trying and the
consequences as uncomfortable.
I feel that the Daily through
Kenny has once more missed the
journalistic mark. Perhaps next
time there will be more to aid a
critical evaluation of the amnesty
question than in calling wolf.

Disfunding's Effect
Editor:
Disfunding SCIRE and
SWOPSI will have but a small
effect on the University's budget
crisis, but the elimination of these
programs will have a major effect
on the quality of undergraduate
education at Stanford.
Increased tuition combined
with the elimination of these
exciting, innovative programs will
leave students in the position of
paying more while getting less.
SWOPSI and SCIRE were
begun in the 1960s as a result of a
massive demonstration of student
power. Only a similar outpouring
of student support will save these
programs now.
It's really up to the students.

Wishy Wascher?
Editor:
Lack of time prohibits me
from discussing the various
falsehoods contained in Jim
Wascher's column on AT&T
(Daily, Jan. 20.)
I would like to suggest,
however, that anyone wishing an
accurate analysis of the likely
results of a break-up of that
company (specifically, higher net
profits, higher prices and the
dissolution of Bell Labs) read the
articles in the Wall Street Journal
on the two days immediately
following the filing of the suit.
I would further suggest that
Wascher confine himself to
subjects about which he knows
something, or which he is willing
to research.
