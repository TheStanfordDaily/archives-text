Oh, the tribulations of
Dial-A-Ride.
Under order of Superior Court
Judge Marshall S. Hall, the Santa
Clara County Transit District
must now purchase the county's
eight privately owned taxi
companies if it wishes to keep its
"demand-responsive" bus service.
And the district is going to do
it.
County official Frank Darien
estimates the cost of the decision
will run $l-1.5 million. Never
mind, though. "There's no
transportation system in the
United States that's in the
black," Darien says.
Don't ask what business a
Santa Clara County bureaucrat
has making an outlandish
statement like that. He's wrong,
of course.
But we must assume that
Darien is referring to
government-run transportation
systems. Most of them are in the
red. A few, mainly commuter
lines in densely populated Eastern
areas, are not. There is a reason
why they are solvent and the
others aren't. It's the same reason
why Dial-A-Ride is and will
remain a drain on the resources of
Santa Clara County taxpayers.
The market cannot support the

costs of Dial-A-Ride. So the
Transit District shall loot the
taxpayers of a few million dollars
to make up the difference. And
the federal government, which
just loves Dial-A-Ride because it
looks innovative and is therefore
politically valuable, will throw in
a large chunk (also care of
taxpayers).
Private taxi companies, whose
survival depended upon their
efficiency, will not be bought out.
In their place will step the
government, which has no need to
be efficient because it has
unlimited resources to pillage.
Yet, according to the Jan. 20
Daily, county supervisors expect
that the expropriation of the
cabs will "increase efficiency."
What a cruel illusion—like the
depiction of Dial-A-Ride as an
innovation. In reality, it is merely
the assumption of a profit-making
industry by a non-profit (but
self-perpetuating) governmental
unit, and the lowering of fares to
an artificial minimum by the
introduction of tax subsidies.
Not a novel idea. And neither
is the end result: an inefficient,
money-eating (but non-profit)
boondoggle.

remain a drain on the resources of
Santa Clara County taxpayers.
The market cannot support the

costs of Dial-A-Ride. So the
Transit District shall loot the
taxpayers of a few million dollars
to make up the difference. And
the federal government, which
just loves Dial-A-Ride because it
looks innovative and is therefore
politically valuable, will throw in
a large chunk (also care of
taxpayers).
Private taxi companies, whose
survival depended upon their
efficiency, will not be bought out.
In their place will step the
government, which has no need to
be efficient because it has
unlimited resources to pillage.
Yet, according to the Jan. 20
Daily, county supervisors expect
that the expropriation of the
cabs will "increase efficiency."
What a cruel illusion—like the
depiction of Dial-A-Ride as an
innovation. In reality, it is merely
the assumption of a profit-making
industry by a non-profit (but
self-perpetuating) governmental
unit, and the lowering of fares to
an artificial minimum by the
introduction of tax subsidies.
Not a novel idea. And neither
is the end result: an inefficient,
money-eating (but non-profit)
boondoggle.
