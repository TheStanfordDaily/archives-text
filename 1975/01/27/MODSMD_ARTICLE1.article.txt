# Employees To Select Six Hospital Unions
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
* An election in April will determine
the union representation for six
categories of workers at Stanford
Hospital.
University staff lawyer Douglas
Barton said that agreements have been
ivorked out with the National Labor
Board (NLRB) for five of
the job categories, and that an
agreement for the sixth category,
Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) will
be finalized next week.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
Jim Berk said that the
agreements on the other five elections
are contingent on approval of the LVN
election by next week.
A few more thkn 50 LVNs working
at the hospital and clinics are now

represented by the California Licensed
Vocational Nurse Association
(CLVNA), Berk said.
But he explained that the
University is slowly replacing the
LVNs by registered nurses, so that
their bargaining unit is growing smaller
and less viable. The LVNs will have a
choice between continuing their
CLVNA affiliation or joining USE.
About 15 pharmacists at the
hospital will decide whether to be
represented as professional or
non-professional workers, and they
will also choose between two unions in
each category. Berk said that several of
the pharmacists, not specifically
represented by the bargaining unit, are
now dues-paying members of USE.
Service, technical, patient care and
plant clerical employees about 1000
workers in all will choose among
USE, no union and the Engineers and
Scientists of California.
Eighty employees now represented
by the Stanford University Medical
Center Engineering Department
Association (SUMCEDA) will decide
whether to continue with the
association, join USE or have no union
at all.
Berk predicted that this vote will
turn SUMCEDA into "an honest
union," by forcing its supporters to
campaign for representation. He
described SUMCEDA as an association
that "doesn't want to be a union," but
said that most of the people in the
association believe they need some
kind of union.
Professional employees, except for
registered nurses and doctors, will
decide whether they want to join the
Stanford United Medical
Technologists, affiliate with USE or
reject union representation.
