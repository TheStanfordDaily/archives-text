# On The Edge Of An Abyss
## 
### Rich Jaroslovsky 
To most readers of the New York Times,
it probably didn't appear unusual. There was
a full-page ad, informing the customers of
Long Island's Security National Bank that for
them," 'YES' is now a Chemical reaction."
But the event behind the ad was hardly
usual. What had rfcally happened was a
deathbed marriage between the failing
Security National and the huge Chemical
Bank of New York. And scenes like that one
are becoming more and more a sign of the
country's troubled economic times.
The collapse of Security National was the
third major bank failure in the last two years.
First came the demise of San Diego's U.S.
National Bank, run by Nixon crony C.
Arnholt Smith. That was followed by the
death this summer of New York's Franklin
National Bank, whose assets were acquired
by a foreign financial combine now doing
business as European-American Bank.
In each case, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and the U.S.
Comptroller of the Currency were forced
into some fancy footwork to see that
depositers weren't burned. But in at least two
of the cases, investors with stock in the banks
ended up holding little more than the
proverbial bag.
Failures Aren't Anachronisms
One generally thinks of bank closings as
belonging to that long-ago era of the
Waltons, fireside chats and Frank Capra
comedies. But the Security National failure,
combined with the others, ought to be raising
a lot of red flags in a lot of people's minds.

The economists particularly government
economists have been telling us that the
current recession has about bottomed out,
that things are bound to get better and that
another 19305-style depression is almost out
of the question. Now I'm certainly not
economist enough to argue theories with
them but it still seems to me that we may
just be on the edge of an abyss. If events
don't go beyond control, the economists
might be right. But if they do ...
What could push us over the edge is
energy. Current predictions ruling out the
possibility of a depression are based on the
tacit assumption that the status remains quo
that the United States will continue to
have access to Arab oil, albeit at a high price.
And that in turn points up the fact that
we've placed all our eggs in Henry Kissinger's
basket, hoping he can find a solution to the
Middle East problem.
But we can't forget that Kissinger has
failed before in Pakistan and Cyprus, to
name a couple of instances. Another, more
effective, oil boycott will be the automatic
price of failure this time. And that could be
the thing to push us into the abyss.
Threats Of Intervention
Then there's the calculated Ford-Kissinger
saber-rattling of recent weeks, that we might
fight for energy. A large measure of those
threats are clearly diplomatic. But I've
learned enough of the lessons of Vietnam,
Chile, et al. to believe a good portion is also
serious. And a U.S.-Arab oil war, with all its
geo-political implications, could be enough to
push us into the abyss too.

Perhaps most frustrating of all is the
thought that the same people who ought to
be most worried about the abyss the large
corporations, especially in oil could help
push us into it through their own greed. I
recently got into a mild argument with a T.A.
who told us how the oil companies were
generally getting a bum rap, and how most of
their soaring profits were really going right
back into research and development. This is
so much bull, as even a cursory reader of the
business pages can see. Most of the
companies are too busy using their megabuck
profits from sky-high prices to fatten
corporate coffers and I need only point to
Mobil's proposed $2OO million takeover of
Marcor (Montgomery Wards' parent
corporation) as an example. You and I, dear
friends, are paying for that merger.
My own personal version of the
apocalypse combines elements of all these.
First a period of general economic shakiness,
as already weak financial institutions are
shaken out (a business term for "fold"). This
combined with skyrocketing prices and
rampant inflation. Then a Kissinger failure
and another Arab-Israeli war. An oil boycott
and U.S. military intervention. From there,
let your imagination go wild. The abyss.
The economists may say that another
collapse like the 30s or worse is out of
the question. But from where I sit, my
friends, we're already half way there.
