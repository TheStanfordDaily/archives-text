# Contract Represses Iranians
## 
### Elliot, et. al 
The Communication and
Electrical Engineering (EE)
departments at Stanford are in the
final phases of closing a $1 million
contract with National Iranian
Radio and Television (NIRT) to
help design Iran's planned
domestic communications
satellite.
The EE department will be
responsible for the
"hardware"—an evaluation of
Iran's projected communications
needs and a design for the
components, installation,
operation, and maintenance of a
telecommunications satellite
system.
The "software" the
expansion of educational services
via television to major cities and
small, isolated towns will be
directed by the Communication
department. By the terms of the
contract, the Educational
Television (ETV) models which
have been developed and
perfected in the U.S. are to be
applied directly to the Iranian
context.
In order to understand the
implications of this contract, one
must know something about Iran
itself and the relationship between
that country and the U.S. Iran is
one of the most politically
repressive countries in the world.
Although nominally a democracy,
Iran is in fact a police state. Both
political parties were created, and
are maintained by the Shah. The
secret police (SAVAK), is
omnipresent. Amnesty
International estimates that there
are 20,000 political prisoners
among Iran's 35 million people.
How does Stanford's satellite
contract fit into Iran's pattern of
political repression, and economic
and military buildup? The satellite
system will bring 10 to 20
thousand isolated Iranian villages
into a national communications
system for the first time. These
villages will have both television

reception and telephone
connections through the satellite.
This single system, run by the
Shah's government, will dominate
all interaction between rural and
urban Iran.
According to the proponents
of the contract in the
Communication department, mass
education and information
systems are potentially liberating
forces. That all depends, however,
on what kind of information and
education are being provided.
Education, in this case, is most
likely to be used for continuous
dissemination of an ideology
which supports the existing
political regime.

What are Stanford's motives
for being involved in this project?
The first is to provide technical
assistance to the Iranians
clearly, another case of the U.S.
producing dependent
"development" in Third World
countries. The second motive
involves the academic research
value of the venture. It has been
openly admitted that this project
is an "exploratory" case which
will help in refining theories of
.the role of communications
technology in national
development.
The Stanford—lran contract
has been a source of great concern
among students and faculty

throughout the University. In the
Communication department some
meetings were held, and a
student-faculty committee was
established to review research
proposals in terms of their ethical
implications.
The committee's
recommendation was to reject this
particular contract. The first
stages of the fulfillment of this
contract are underway, so it
appears that the recommendation
has been ignored.

particular contract. The first
stages of the fulfillment of this
contract are underway, so it
appears that the recommendation
has been ignored.

The Communication and
Electrical Engineering (EE)
departments at Stanford are in the
final phases of closing a $1 million
contract with National Iranian
Radio and Television (NIRT) to
help design Iran's planned
domestic communications
satellite.
The EE department will be
responsible for the
"hardware"—an evaluation of
Iran's projected communications
needs and a design for the
components, installation,
operation, and maintenance of a
telecommunications satellite
system.
The "software" the
expansion of educational services
via television to major cities and
small, isolated towns will be
directed by the Communication
department. By the terms of the
contract, the Educational
Television (ETV) models which
have been developed and
perfected in the U.S. are to be
applied directly to the Iranian
context.
In order to understand the
implications of this contract, one
must know something about Iran
itself and the relationship between
that country and the U.S. Iran is
one of the most politically
repressive countries in the world.
Although nominally a democracy,
Iran is in fact a police state. Both
political parties were created, and
are maintained by the Shah. The
secret police (SAVAK), is
omnipresent. Amnesty
International estimates that there
are 20,000 political prisoners
among Iran's 35 million people.
How does Stanford's satellite
contract fit into Iran's pattern of
political repression, and economic
and military buildup? The satellite
system will bring 10 to 20
thousand isolated Iranian villages
into a national communications
system for the first time. These
villages will have both television

reception and telephone
connections through the satellite.
This single system, run by the
Shah's government, will dominate
all interaction between rural and
urban Iran.
According to the proponents
of the contract in the
Communication department, mass
education and information
systems are potentially liberating
forces. That all depends, however,
on what kind of information and
education are being provided.
Education, in this case, is most
likely to be used for continuous
dissemination of an ideology
which supports the existing
political regime.

What are Stanford's motives
for being involved in this project?
The first is to provide technical
assistance to the Iranians
clearly, another case of the U.S.
producing dependent
"development" in Third World
countries. The second motive
involves the academic research
value of the venture. It has been
openly admitted that this project
is an "exploratory" case which
will help in refining theories of
.the role of communications
technology in national
development.
The Stanford—lran contract
has been a source of great concern
among students and faculty

throughout the University. In the
Communication department some
meetings were held, and a
student-faculty committee was
established to review research
proposals in terms of their ethical
implications.
The committee's
recommendation was to reject this
particular contract. The first
stages of the fulfillment of this
contract are underway, so it
appears that the recommendation
has been ignored.
