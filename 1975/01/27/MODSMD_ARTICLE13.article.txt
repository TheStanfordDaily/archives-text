# Protest Phony Viet Peace
## 
### Leavitt, et. al 
More than two years ago, we at Stanford spoke
in condemnation of the Christmas bombings of
Hanoi, of the invasion of Cambodia, of the
slaughter of civilians; we called for an end to an
immoral war. On Jan. 27, 1973, the Paris Peace
Agreement was signed, which was intended to bring
this unconscionable war to an end. We hailed a new
era of peace ...
But there is no peace; the war goes on. American
bombs are still being dropped by American planes
on Vietnamese targets, and American pilots fly
reconnaissance over North Vietnam. Our
government still places more stress on providing
planes than on making peace.
There is no peace; the war goes on. American
funds continue to support the dictatorial Thieu
regime, which arrests and tortures its political
opponents.
There is no peace; the war goes on. We supply
the dollars, the guns, the ammunition everything
but the corpses.
Two years ago, the United States government
pledged "to respect the independence, sovereignty ,
unity and territorial integrity of Vietnam" (Article
1). We have not done so.
Two years ago, we pledged: "The United States
will not continue its military involvement or
interfere in the internal affairs of South Vietnam"

(Article 4). We are still militarily involved, and we
interfere daily, providing over 80 percent of the
Saigon government's budget.
Last week, we heard our government request
300 million more dollars in military aid for the
Thieu government. We heard our government
renounce its obligation to the Paris Peace
Agreement. We heard our president refuse to rule
out the return of United States forces to Indochina.
Today is the second anniversary of the signing of
the Paris Peace Agreement. We call upon all
members of the Stanford community to come
together to honor or mourn the Peace Agreement,
by joining to learn about the agreement and the
ongoing war, and to demand the cessation of U.S.
support for war in Vietnam.
We invite everyone to participate in an all-day
vigil in White Plaza to share in talk, song or quiet
contemplation. Please join us for as much of the
day as you can. We invite everyone to join today in
a fast of solidarity with the Vietnamese. And, we
invite you to a teach-in tonight at 7 p.m. in
Cubberley Auditorium.

interfere in the internal affairs of South Vietnam"

(Article 4). We are still militarily involved, and we
interfere daily, providing over 80 percent of the
Saigon government's budget.
Last week, we heard our government request
300 million more dollars in military aid for the
Thieu government. We heard our government
renounce its obligation to the Paris Peace
Agreement. We heard our president refuse to rule
out the return of United States forces to Indochina.
Today is the second anniversary of the signing of
the Paris Peace Agreement. We call upon all
members of the Stanford community to come
together to honor or mourn the Peace Agreement,
by joining to learn about the agreement and the
ongoing war, and to demand the cessation of U.S.
support for war in Vietnam.
We invite everyone to participate in an all-day
vigil in White Plaza to share in talk, song or quiet
contemplation. Please join us for as much of the
day as you can. We invite everyone to join today in
a fast of solidarity with the Vietnamese. And, we
invite you to a teach-in tonight at 7 p.m. in
Cubberley Auditorium.

Weigan, Ralph Silber and Chris Coleman are
