Students Aren't Serfs
Editor:
Stephen Carter's column
(Daily, Jan. 21) concerning
parking fees insults , the entire
student body of Stanford. In one
childish pout, Carter reduces the
important issue into an obnoxious
whine.
I will pass over Carter's ending
suggestion that the student body
express itself once again as it did
over the Vietnam War. Even he
would probably recognize the
difference in the severity of the
complaints.
The implication, however, that
the fee would be tolerable if also
charged to the staff is such a gross
example of selfish ignorance that
it cannot pass without remark.
Aside from the rather dubious
idea that the student fee would be
less painful if accompanied by a
charge to the staff, Carter makes
several significant errors.
The analogy of the staff as a
privileged group set above the
poor suffering students is a
distortion of reality bordering on
total fabrication. I would like to
remind Carter that most of the
staff spend their working day for
the direct benefit of the student
doing everything from providing
clean lecture halls and replacing
burned-out lights to doing the
paper work required to correct a
mistake in a transcript.
Carter's implication that,
through the generosity of the
University's pay scale, a staff fee
would be little noticed by the
employees needs no further
remark. I do suggest, however,
that in the future Carter not put
"professors and other employees"
into one financial category, and
that he discontinue using
"faculty" and "staff"
interchangeably.
The University may be "an
undemocratic feifdom", but I am
not sure that it is the students
who are the serfs.

Humor Can Backfire
Editor:
Esoteric humor has away of
backfiring. For example, the
recent article (Daily, Jan. 16) on
Phi Beta Kappa requirements
might strike uninformed people
(or at least those not familiar with
local campus humor) as a serious
discussion on the selection of
Stanford's honor graduates.
They might actually and
naively—beleive that a major
university would rely on name
and status (Harvard vs. Oklahoma
State), rather than the fact that a
senior had accomplished enough
at Stanford to merit Phi Beta
Kappa consideration.
We personally did not catch on
to the light, humorous and
absurd nature of the article until
the line "It's pretty easy to get
straight A's at Stanford now."
The unexpected and outlandish is
a trademark of Woody Allen's
humor, too.
Therefore, for future reference,
shouldn't you agree that such
articles should be placed in a
campus humor magazine, or at
least located near the Oliphant
cartoon? We wouldn't want
people to get more wrong ideas
about Stanford.

Editor:
I'm amused by the opinion of
Prof. Henry Breitrose supporting
the scuttling of SWOPSI and
SCIRE (Daily, Jan. 22.) He argues
that, now that the
student-initiated programs have
proven that they can be
"responsive to students' legitimate
learning objectives" —now that
"the message of SCIRE's and
SWOPSI's success is clear enough"
the programs should be
dismantled and their functions
absorbed by the academic
departments. Successful
experiments should be ended, in
short.
By the same logic, we might
argue that Stanford is an excellent
educational institution; the
message of its success is clear to
the surrounding community; thus,
it should be closed down.

L. can no longer listen to that
impassionate voice within me
which says, "Be rational. Be
realistic. You're too busy to
become concerned about other's
affairs." The outrageous decision
not to give tenure to Jerry Irish
angers me too much.
I will not sit idly while
University officials proceed to
exile a truly outstanding person
who taught me one of the most
inspiring and stimulating courses I
have ever taken. Excellence in
teaching must be rewarded, not
just awarded, starting here and
now!

They might actually and

State), rather than the fact that a
senior had accomplished enough
at Stanford to merit Phi Beta

We personally did not catch on
to the light, humorous and
absurd nature of the article until
the line "It's pretty easy to get

The unexpected and outlandish is

I'm amused by the opinion of
Prof. Henry Breitrose supporting
the scuttling of SWOPSI and
SCIRE (Daily, Jan. 22.) He argues
that, now that the
student-initiated programs have
proven that they can be
"responsive to students' legitimate
learning objectives" —now that
"the message of SCIRE's and
SWOPSI's success is clear enough"
the programs should be
dismantled and their functions
absorbed by the academic
departments. Successful
experiments should be ended, in
short.
By the same logic, we might
argue that Stanford is an excellent
educational institution; the
message of its success is clear to
the surrounding community; thus,
it should be closed down.

Students Aren't Serfs
Editor:
Stephen Carter's column
(Daily, Jan. 21) concerning
parking fees insults , the entire
student body of Stanford. In one
childish pout, Carter reduces the
important issue into an obnoxious
whine.
I will pass over Carter's ending
suggestion that the student body
express itself once again as it did
over the Vietnam War. Even he
would probably recognize the
difference in the severity of the
complaints.
The implication, however, that
the fee would be tolerable if also
charged to the staff is such a gross
example of selfish ignorance that
it cannot pass without remark.
Aside from the rather dubious
idea that the student fee would be
less painful if accompanied by a
charge to the staff, Carter makes
several significant errors.
The analogy of the staff as a
privileged group set above the
poor suffering students is a
distortion of reality bordering on
total fabrication. I would like to
remind Carter that most of the
staff spend their working day for
the direct benefit of the student
doing everything from providing
clean lecture halls and replacing
burned-out lights to doing the
paper work required to correct a
mistake in a transcript.
Carter's implication that,
through the generosity of the
University's pay scale, a staff fee
would be little noticed by the
employees needs no further
remark. I do suggest, however,
that in the future Carter not put
"professors and other employees"
into one financial category, and
that he discontinue using
"faculty" and "staff"
interchangeably.
The University may be "an
undemocratic feifdom", but I am
not sure that it is the students
who are the serfs.
