## Sky Cycle Inventor Gets a Blast Out Of Life 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Robert C. Truax is a
56-year-old dreamer who has a
way of making his dreams come
true.
Recently he dreamed up the
Super X-2 Sky Cycle that Robert
Craig "Evel" Knievel used in his
ill-fated jump across the Snake
River Canyon.
But the X-2 is hardly Truax's
greatest accomplishment. Many of
his other dreams for rockets and
missiles have become realities, and
these realities have blasted him
into prominence in the
engineering world.
Now Truax has enrolled at
Stanford to fulfill another dream.
"I'm interested in not aging,"
he says with a whimsical smile. "I
want to discover a cause and a
cure for old age.
"Probably ever since I looked
in the mirror five or six years ago
and saw those changes, I've
wanted to do something about
it," Truax says. He says he has
read all the books he could find
on the causes and theoretical
cures of old age.
New Approach
In his old red sweatshirt and
his dirty workpants, he doesn't
look senile, but sometimes the
things Truax says give some
people that impression.
"Actually, he's really very
youthful," says Howard Seifert,
professor of aeronautics and
astronautics and long-time friend
of Truax. "I'm not sure how far
he'll get with his new idea, but
there's nothing wrong with his
approach."
Currently, Truax says he is
trying to learn "the basics" of
how the human body works. As a
non-matriculated graduate
student, he is taking Biology 22,
"Principles of Biology," and
Biology 24, "Experimental
Biology." His wife, Sally, says he
studies more than four hours a
day.
Truax admits he has a long way
> to go before he'll be doing his
own research, but that doesn't
phase him.
Setting His Sights
"I've carved myself out a goal
that'll keep me occupied for the
rest of my life," he says with a
mystical pride.
Unusual goals are nothing new
to Truax.
During the last five years,

Truax has spent most of his free
time developing a "subsonic
rocket" so Knievel could attempt
a jump across a
canyon.
"It doesn't surprise me," says
Seifert, who did rocket research
with Truax in the late 40s. Truax
"was always the adventurous
type. He liked things with a little
dash of excitement. I'm not too
impressed with stunts like that
[the canyon jump]. They don't
have any real higher goals. But
Bob tends to go along with things
like that from time to time."
Steamed Up
Truax became involved in the
Sky Cycle project in a roundabout
way. In Maryland during the late
50s, he began building a
steam-powered rocket for his
daughter's boyfriend.
"The kid was wrapping
matchheads in aluminum foil and
stuffing them into pipes and
cans," Truax recalls.
The youth wanted to build a
rocket that would be propelled in
the same way a lit firecracker
propels a tin can, Truax says. "I
tried to get him interested in a

steam rocket because it doesn't
involve such a big explosion," and
is therefore less dangerous.
The boy moved away before
the steam rocket was finished, but
Truax kept working on it. Later,
when he and his family wife,
three sons and two daughters
moved to California, Truax began
experimenting with 10-foot-high
steam rockets.
Knievel Connection
In 1969, Knievel's men came
looking for Truax and his steam
rocket.
Originally, they wanted him to
help build a motorcycle that
could jump the Grand Canyon.
However, the Arizona officials
turned down Knievel's request for
permission for the jump, and the
Snake River Canyon span became
his goal., Later, Truax convinced
Knievel that a rocket rather than a
motorcycle would be needed.
In June 1973, Truax took over
the Sky Cycle project. He says
most of the actual building of the
X-2 didn't begin until three
months before the jump. The
reason: money.
"Originally, when I was first

contacted by Knievel, we were
only considering making one
machine, without any of the
automatic devices or testing, and
we estimated the cost at
$20,000," Truax says.
The actual cost for building the
two sky cycles was near
$150,000, he adds.
Cycle Stunt
Knievel told Truax that he
signed a contract for the jump in
June 1974. That's when Knievel
supposedly got a $250,000
advance from a close-circuit
television company, according to
Truax.
At the time, Knievel received a
check for $6 million from the
company in a grandiose publicity
stunt. The check later turned out
to be phony. But the stunt didn't
fool TVuax.
"It wasn't until we began
seeing some of the money, that
we began pulling all the stops out
[started building]," he says.
In less than three months, 12
people put together two Sky
Cycles in the garage of the Truax
home in Saratoga, Calif.
Truax says the workers

included automatic pilot
engineers, sheet metal workers,
electrical engineers and
technicians from Lockheed
Missiles and Space Co., all
working, "whenever they had a
chance," until the unsuccessful
launch.
Newsweek sharply criticized
Truax's Sky Cycle, calling it a
possible "tin coffin" and saying it
was inadequately tested.
"Except for the chute
mechanism," says Truax, "there is
no part of the cycle that we
haven't computed and tested
thoroughly.
"All we needed was one more
day for tests. We just didn't have
it.... We had a deadline ... and
the jump had to happen on the
day stipulated."
Truax's crew did manage to
test the engine and other systems
including the parachutes
more than 20 times, he says.
In addition, two weeks before
the final shot, a test rocket was
fired. The first X-2, equipped with
a plastic dummy and controlled
electronically from the ground,
landed in the river.j
Apparently, the automatic
pilot system failed, and the
automatic parachute system
deployed prematurely, Truax
says.
Last Minute Adjustments
Because his crew couldn't find
the problem in the automatic
systems, "we tore them out and
made the ship manual," he recalls.
The crew installed a deadman's
handle for the parachute system
and two foot pedals designed so
that Knievel could keep the cycle
from spinning.
Although many speculated that
during the final launch Knievel
released the parachute handle too
early, Truax claims the parachute
opened prematurely by itself.
"An uncalculated blast of
suction at take-off, or the inertia
effect of the parachute in its
cannister, or a combination of the
two may have forced the chute
out before the X-2 left the
ground," he says.
As for the foot pedals, Truax
adds, "I think Knievel forgot what
the damn things were for."
000p5...
Whatever the reasons, Knievel
and the Sky Cycle blasted off
with the parachute open and,
after spinning wildly for a few

moments, came floating silently
down into the canyon while a
crowd of more than 20,000
watched.
Later, there was speculation
that the second jump had been
staged, and credence was added to
the claims when Knievel stepped
out of the Sky Cycle virtually
unharmed. Truax laughs and says,
"It's just not true."
If fired again, the rocket would
work, Truax insists. However,
chances for another jump seem
slim.
Knievel told Truax he turned
down $500,000 from some
Japanese businessmen who
wanted him to jump across the
volcano crater on Mt. Fuji in
Japan.
In addition, Truax says that he,
himself, turned down an offer
from the businessmen. "They
wanted me to build another
rocket, this time with Japanese
technicians. I had a hard enough
time communicating with people
who spoke my own language."
Up Again?
Knievel has said he will never
jump again, anyway. But Truax
has his own ideas.
"I could make him [Knievel]
the world's first private
astronaut," he insists.
"To become an astronaut, you
only have to go up 50 miles ... I
have a bunch of Atlas vernier
engines right in my garage.
They're the little engines that
steer the Atlas with 1000 pounds
of thrust apiece. I think with four
or possibly five of them, I could
boost a payload the size of the
X-2 up 50 miles."
According to Truax, Knievel
has said he likes the idea. "I'm
just waiting for the money,"
Truax says.
Ever since he was a kid, Truax
says, "I used to think man would
go to the moon in my lifetime,
long before it seemed possible."
But not many agreed with him,
and it wasn't until he left college
and joined the Navy in 1939 that
Truax got a chance to help his
vision become reality.
Rocket Research
In 1941, the government hired
him to do rocket research.
"In those days, 'rocket' was a
nasty word," he recalls. "And
everybody thought that, if you
were interested in them, you were

a crackpot."
Undaunted by criticism, Truax
developed 15 patents on rocket
devices and wrote and published
more than 20 technical papers on
rockets during his 20 years with
â€¢the Navy.
He was awarded the Legion of
Merit for his contributions and
initiation of the Polaris Rocket
Program. He won the R.H.
Goddard Medal in 1951 for
outstanding contributions to
rocketry, and in 1957, he was
elected president of the American
Rocket Society. He retired from
the Navy as a captain.
His contributions include early
work on J.A.T.O. (Jet Assisted
Take Off) units, and his most
recent work for the government
on an experimental navy ship
that, like a hydrofoil, moves on a
cushion of air.
Now his most famous
accomplishment, the X-2 Sky
Cycle, lies in a special red, white
and blue van on his driveway.
Knievel plans to take it on a
national exhibition tour.
The first X-2, the one that
carried the plastic dummy into
the river, is now sitting on its own
trailer in Truax's garage.
And Truax? With bachelor's
degrees in mechanical engineering
and aeronautical engineering and a
master's in nuclear engineering, he
is going back to school to learn
the secrets of the aging process. If
he has his way, he will live
forever.
