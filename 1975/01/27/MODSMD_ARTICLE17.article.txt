# New Book Advises Women Returning To Job Market
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Concerned with the lack of guidance for older
women re-entering the job market, a group of
volunteers has published a second volume of
Second Careers For Women.
The book deals with the unique problems and
opportunities of women returning to work after an
interruption of several years, drawing on the
research of 13 professionals in seven fields.
The "Second Careers For Women" project was
begun in 1968 by the Job Opportunities and
Continuing Education Section of the Stanford
Faculty Wives Club.
At a press conference Saturday, the authors and
editors summarized their findings, concluding that
women can re-enter even today's tight job market.
Because employers are reducing the number of
employees, they want the best they can find,
according to Constance Golden, author of the
chapter on Engineering and Physical Sciences. But
for a competent woman willing to look, "The jobs
are there," she said.
Affirmative Action Goals
Golden added that women graduating with
engineering degrees will probably have more job
opportunities than men, since employers are trying
to fulfill affirmative action goals.
Most of the authors suggested that women
"keep a hand in their fields," while rearing a family
or pursuing another job, so that re-entry will be
easier.
Voy Wiederhold, a computer programmer here
and co-author of the chapter on Computer Science
and Data Processing, said that keeping up in the
field is especially important for women in the

developing sciences. If a woman does not follow
new developments for several years, she becomes
obsolete, Wiederhold explained.
Susan Bell, co-author of the chapter on Writing
and Editing, suggested that women re-entering this
field take a refresher course. A class will not only
refresh writing skills, but also get a woman back in
touch with job contacts, Bell said.
Martha White, a social and developmental
psychologist at San Francisco State, said that
women in Health Sciences might do better to leave
the job market entirely for a few years while
pursuing family interests.
'Listen To The Voice'
Women who try to work in health sciences while
also rearing a family may find themselves
under-achieving relative to their male competitors,
White explained. But mature women who re-enter
the field may find that they move up quickly when
they can devote themselves full-time to their jobs,
she said.
Women faced with a choice between family and
career should "listen to the voice" of their hearts,
White advised, saying "Your life is your career."
The author of the chapter on Perspectives on
Starting a Small Business, Marion Lewenstein,
warned potential businesswomen that half of the
businesses started every year fail. Another 40
percent are "marginally successful" and only 10
percent actually succeed, Lewenstein said.
However, women trying to start a business find
it easier to get a loan now than they did even a few
years ago, Lewenstein added. She said that bankers
she talked to while researching her chapter "have
become much more conscious of wotnen."
