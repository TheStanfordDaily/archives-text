# Women's History 'Depressing' When Viewed From Traditional Perspective
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
Women's history viewed in the
context of traditional political
and economic history is "so
overwhelmingly depressing it
appears insurmountable,"
according to Sonoma State Prof.
Alice Wexler.
Wexler's remarks came in an
academic debate Saturday at a
conference on "Teaching the
History of Women" at the
Graduate School of Business.
Wexler argued for the need to
separate women's history from
traditional classes in history, and
for the use of unusual source
materials such as folklore, myth,
paintings, popular fiction and
photography to compensate for
what she termed the "dearth of
conventional sources on women."
The debate was part of a
day-long program organized by a
group of graduate students in
history. The program was chaired
by History Prof. Carl Degler.

Over 100 educators and
graduate students from California
universities and colleges heard the
debate between Wexler and
UC-Davis Prof. S. Barbara Kanner,
who argued for the integration of
women's history into existing
courses.
"The history of women is part
of the history of society; it should
not be ripped away," said Kanner.
However, she stressed the
importance of challenging the
traditional emphasis on political
and economic history, saying,
"We must ask social questions
which cover a wider range. The
course curricula in history should
be broadened to include social
questions. Women become visible
immediately in this context, often
in roles of leadership."
Kanner spoke of the need to
deal with cultural, social and
regional peculiarities in the study
of women's history as a part of
social history.

The conference also featured
speakers Susan Groag Bell,
Renaissance and Reformation
scholar at Santa Clara, and Sondra
Herman, instructor at DeAnza
College, who spoke on teaching
women's history in the
community college.
Herman reiterated Degler's
introductory comment that "the
history of women is not yet
recognized by many traditional
historians."
"Neither students nor faculty
find it possible to be neutral
about women's history," said
Herman. "People either say to me
'keep fighting' or they say 'still
recruiting for women's lib, heh?' "
Herman explained that some
persons automatically perceive
women's history courses as

feminist consciousness-raising
sessions rather than simply
academic endeavors.
She cautioned against trying to
turn women's studies courses into
"recruiting stations," when many
students, especially older married
women coming to the community
college for the first time, already
have an attitude of "wistful
apprehension" towards women's
history courses.
Bell, demonstrating the use of
unusual sources in the study of
women's history, used a
photo-slide presentation of
paintings to illustrate what she
termed the change in relative
occupational status of men and
women from a domestic,
pre-industrial society to an
industrial economy.

Alice Wexler.
Wexler's remarks came in an
academic debate Saturday at a
conference on "Teaching the
History of Women" at the
Graduate School of Business.
Wexler argued for the need to
separate women's history from
traditional classes in history, and
for the use of unusual source
materials such as folklore, myth,
paintings, popular fiction and
photography to compensate for
what she termed the "dearth of
conventional sources on women."
The debate was part of a
day-long program organized by a
group of graduate students in
history. The program was chaired
by History Prof. Carl Degler.

Over 100 educators and
graduate students from California
universities and colleges heard the
debate between Wexler and
UC-Davis Prof. S. Barbara Kanner,
who argued for the integration of
women's history into existing
courses.
"The history of women is part
of the history of society; it should
not be ripped away," said Kanner.
However, she stressed the
importance of challenging the
traditional emphasis on political
and economic history, saying,
"We must ask social questions
which cover a wider range. The
course curricula in history should
be broadened to include social
questions. Women become visible
immediately in this context, often
in roles of leadership."
Kanner spoke of the need to
deal with cultural, social and
regional peculiarities in the study
of women's history as a part of
social history.

The conference also featured
speakers Susan Groag Bell,
Renaissance and Reformation
scholar at Santa Clara, and Sondra
Herman, instructor at DeAnza
College, who spoke on teaching
women's history in the
community college.
Herman reiterated Degler's
introductory comment that "the
history of women is not yet
recognized by many traditional
historians."
"Neither students nor faculty
find it possible to be neutral
about women's history," said
Herman. "People either say to me
'keep fighting' or they say 'still
recruiting for women's lib, heh?' "
Herman explained that some
persons automatically perceive
women's history courses as

feminist consciousness-raising
sessions rather than simply
academic endeavors.
She cautioned against trying to
turn women's studies courses into
"recruiting stations," when many
students, especially older married
women coming to the community
college for the first time, already
have an attitude of "wistful
apprehension" towards women's
history courses.
Bell, demonstrating the use of
unusual sources in the study of
women's history, used a
photo-slide presentation of
paintings to illustrate what she
termed the change in relative
occupational status of men and
women from a domestic,
pre-industrial society to an
industrial economy.
