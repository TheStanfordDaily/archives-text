# Vietnam Peace Vigil Scheduled
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
An all-day vigil in White Plaza and
an informal teach-in in Cubberley
Auditorium are planned today to
commemorate the second anniversary
of the signing of the Paris Peace
* Agreement with North and South
Vietnam.
Sponsored by Some Concerned
People At Stanford, the day is
scheduled as a protest to the 1973
"peace with honor" decree.
"There is no peace," a leaflet from
*the group said. "The war goes on. We
are supplying the dollars, the guns and
the ammunition; everything but the
corpses."
The vigil will begin around 8 a.m.
Members of the Stanford community
are invited to join in the fasting,
'•talking, singing and contemplation for
all or part of the day.
The teach-in, at 7 p.m., will explore
"Vietnam: Still America's War?"
Moderated by French Prof. Raymond
Giraud and English undergraduate
Emily Leavitt, the eight-person panel
•will explore the various aspects of the
Vietnamese War and the possibilities
of continuing U.S. involvement in
Southeast Asia.
Involvement
Giraud will present a slide show,
"The Post-War War," and give a short
of Vietnamese involvement
and of the protest movement.
Other members of thp panel include
Religious Studies Prof. Robert McAfee

Drekmeier, Economics Prof. John
rf Gurley, Music Lecturer Martin
Bresnick, history undergraduate
Jonathan Marshall, Pacific Studies
Center Director Lenny Siegel and Cao
Thi My Loc of the Union of
Vietnamese in the United States.
Happening
Marshall and Siegal will speak on
*what has been happening in Vietnam
since the signing of the peace
agreement.
Brown will discuss the problems of
reconstruction in Vietnam, a topic he
will deal with in an upcoming visit to
South Vietnam and Laos. He said he
will spend a lot of his time at the
conference listening to Southeast
Asians, getting their ideas on what
should be done.
Brown noted that the panel was an
effort at re-education of the problems
involved in Southeast Asia.
"When I think that we could
possibly slide back into that mess
again, the way we were involved
before, it scares me. Everyone thought
that the Vietnamese War was behind
us, but it's still a very serious
possibility," Brown said. .
