# Rubinstein Calls Life 'A Miracle' At 88
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
"My life is a miracle," said
Maestro Artur Rubinstein in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Friday
night. "At 88, I consider myself a
survivor."
• Speaking in a panel discussion
on "The Majesty of Man,"
Rubinstein said, "Nobody can
complain at my age. But my
happiness is more than just
smiling. It might become very
boring to remain smiling we
• need contrast in everything I
learn that from music, too."
The office of postgraduate
medical education sponsored the

symposium. The program focused
on the "celebration" of mankind's
humanity and creativity.
Nobel laureates Linus Pauling
and Joshua Lederberg also took
part in the discussion before more
than 700 people. Pauling is an
emeritus professor of chemistry
and Lederberg is the chairman of
the Genetics Department.
They were joined by Prof.
Edward Rubinstein, associate
dean of postgraduate medical
education; Physiology Prof. John
G. Nicholls; and Dr. Gilbert
Omenn, associate professor of
medicine at the University of

Washington.
Psychiatry Prof. David
Hamburg served as the panel's
moderator.
At the outset, the panel
discussion focused on the concept
of happiness. Maestro Rubinstein
spoke first.
Happiness, Rubinstein
explained, was not always present
in his life. He recounted the
moments when his career was at
its lowest ebb.
At 22 or 23, "I can't remember
which," Rubinstein said he was
lonely. "I decided that I had to
kill myself. I found a bathrobe

with a belt around it."
He said he tied the belt around
his neck at one end and onto a
hook on the other. He stood on a
chair and then "pushed the chair
away, but the belt burst and I fell
on the floor stupidly."
After that, he "discovered a
new world. I was resurrected in a
way. I became in love with
life ... I learned that happiness
cannot be success, health or
money those are by-products of
happiness. I began to passionately
love life," he said earnestly.
Rubinstein said he reached
stardom at age 50. "I could well

have been dead before then. So
now I give advice to my young
colleagues not to overwork at age
20. After three hours of very
concentrated work, the brain
needs a rest, and the fingers
become mechanical tools," he
warned with a shake of his
out-stretched finger.
"I ask you for the meaning of
the sou/," he Rubinstein
repeated the word in French,
German, Russian and Polish. "I
must give the audience some
emotion, some contact."
Hamburg replied that scientists
had studied the subject, but the
results were inconclusive. The soul
remains a mystery, he said.
Rubinstein would not be put
off: "How Eve came from the rib
of Adam was not discovered by
science, but millions still believe
in it," he said.
The scientists just shook their
heads and the audience cheered.

Nicholls and Omenn also
presented new findings on how
the human brain is put together,
how it functions and how its
performance is modified by
experience.
Nicholls, a neurophysiologist,
told how nerve cells work
together to produce organized
behavior. He also discussed the
structure and function of the
nervous system.
Omenn, involved in research in
genetics and DNA, reported on his
findings indicating the
biochemical uniqueness of the
brain.
"We're living in a cyclone of
change," said Prof. Rubinstein,
whose office organized the
symposium. "We're endowed with
the power to change the course of
our individual lives.
"I think people have heard
enough about the world's
problems. We should end this era
of misanthropy. Despite the
problems, man has been
extraordinarily constructive."
