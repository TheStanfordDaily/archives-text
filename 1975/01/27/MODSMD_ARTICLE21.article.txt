# Supports Undergraduate Degree
## Prof Probes Merit Of Engineering 
### LINDA GRIBBIN 
Anyone who wants to go to
9 medical, business or law school
would do well to get an
undergraduate degree in
engineering, according to Assoc.
Electrical Engineering-Prof. Louis
Padulo.
Padulo recently headed the
Planning Commission for
Expanding Minority
Opportunities in Engineering,
which made recommendations for
increased minority representation

in engineering.
The commission concluded
that the employment outlook for
opportunities in engineering is
"highly encouraging" for the next
decade. However, the
commission's report said that
minorities "are still
under-represented in American
engineering and engineering
education."
The report recommended that
by 1982 the number of freshmen
engineers who are black, Mexican

American, Puerto Rican or
American Indians should be
tripled or quadrupled in order to
achieve "population parity" of 18
percent.
Padulo said that the benefits of
an engineering degree were not
limited to minorities.
"If you don't get into law or
med school, what are you going to
do with your degree in history, or
English?" said Padulo. "With an
engineering degree the doors are
open. There are high salaries and

graduate opportunities. An
engineering degree is also a good
pathway to management.
"It's a hard degree. If you
didn't know anything else about a
person other than that he had an
engineering degree you would
probably assume that that person
had a little more smarts and
drive."
The report points out that at
present "only half those who start
college in engineering complete
their degrees in this field."
"Little concession is made to
the student" working for
engineering degrees. "People have
to get through some very tight
obstacles. Freshman math and
chemistry are notorious for
weeding out people."
The report said engineering is
the largest professional
occupation for men in the U.S.,
employing more than a million
persons. Engineering enrollment
and the number of B.S. degrees in
Engineering have declined for
several years at a time when
demand and opportunities for
new engineers have been
expanding, the report said.
