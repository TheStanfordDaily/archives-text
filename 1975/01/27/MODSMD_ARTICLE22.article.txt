# Young Voters Stay Home, Report Says
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Four
of five Americans between the
ages of 18 and 21 stayed away
from the polls in the 1974
midterm elections, the Census
Bureau reported yesterday.
• Among all categories of voters
nationwide, only those
approaching retirement age
bucked the pattern of massive
apathy toward last fall's balloting,
according to bureau statistics.
Besides young people,
9 minorities and women showed the
least interest in the congressional
elections and the selection of
governors and local officials.
Overall, only 45 percent of a
record 141 million eligible voters
reported going to the polls last
• Nov. 5. Many of the estimated 76
million who stayed home said
they were either uninterested or
disliked politics in the
post-Watergate era.
The preliminary Census Bureau
report was based upon interviews
• of more than 100,000 eligible

voters questioned two weeks after
the election.
Comparisons are difficult, but
the report showed that not since
1958 had such a high proportion
of those eligible chosen not to
vote. In that recession year, only
43 percent of those eligible turned
out.
The lowest figure historically
was 32.5 percent in 1942 when
millions were away at war.
Comparisons before 1966 are
inexact because not until that
year did the Census Bureau begin
to ask people if they voted and
why.
Earlier figures from other
sources counted actual votes
measured against the known
voting age population.
By that method, also
acknowledged to be slightly
inexact, the 1974 figure for total
turnout was 39 percent, six
percentage points below the
Census Bureau's finding.
Larry Suter, who wrote the

Census Bureau's report, said of all
the reasons given by people for
not voting last fall, "Watergate
was the overriding consideration."
No figures exist to back that,
up, however, he said.
A constitutional amendment
gave 18-year-olds the vote for the
first time during the 1972
presidential elections. In that
year, 48.3 percent of the 18-to-20
year olds turned up at the polls.
Last fall, the figure fell to only
21 percent.
