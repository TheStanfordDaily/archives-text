# Grading Panel asks course 'drop' deadline, 'no credit' notation
## REPORT OF THE AD HOC PANEL ON THE GRADING SYSTEM 
### 
1. Background. Stanford instituted a new system of
grading in 1970. This system was intended to be a pure
"record of accomplishment" which only recorded grades A,
B, C, or Pass. (Later plus and minus modifiers to the letter
grades were reinstated and also a "P" form of the Pass grade
indicating a course where no letter grades were awarded.)
Failing grades, including the D, were no longer recorded.
Simply by not taking the final examination a student could
drop a course with no record of that course appearing on his
transcript.
The new system, perhaps the most notable result of the
Study of Education at Stanford, represented a major change
from the traditional "historical record," which attempted to
record all of a student's educational experiences, unsuccessful
as well as successful.
The charge to the Ad Hoc Panel was:
1) To review and to recommend continuance or change in
the grading system established in 1970;
2) To conduct the review with special attention to possi
ble abuses in the use of the incomplete grade ("I"), to the
effect of course drop deadline policies, and to the question of
the possible utility of the "D" grade.
The need for such a review was based on the general
principle of reviewing all major innovations, and also on
faculty criticisms of the new system.
The panel met regularly during the spring and fall quarters
of 1974. We conducted, opinion surveys of the faculty, stu
dents, and deans of prominent graduate schools. . . . Broadly
speaking, they indicate satisfaction with the new system,
especially among the students, but with strong reservations
on certain points.
Many faculty members were particularly disturbed by the
inflation of grades that has occurred since 1970.. . . Another
sore point, emphasized in the discussion following the panel's
preliminary report to the Faculty Senate in October, was the
waste of University resources occurring when students are
allowed to drop courses at any time during the quarter.
2. Conclusions and recommendations. The panel agreed
that it was virtually impossible to compromise between the
"record of accomplishment" and "historical record" systems
because they represent opposing conceptions of the grading
process and the purpose of the transcript.
-Operationally, the crucial distinction is the absence or
presence of a' firm drop deadline, after which a student
cannot leave a course without some notation on his perma
nent transcript. Such a deadline necessitates the use of a
negative grade to indicate unsuccessful performance in
courses not dropped.
By a majority of 5 to 4, the panel favored returning to the
historical record system. Consequently, it is recommended
that.
Recommendation 1. Firm deadlines for dropping courses
should be reinstated; the dates should be the same as those
currently in force for adding courses.
Recommendation 2. A single grade should be introduced
to indicate either unauthorized withdrawal from a course or
unsatisfactory performance in. a course. This grade should be
denoted "NC" (no credit) on the transcript A clear descrip
tion of the two meanings of the new grade will be included
on all transcripts.

The arguments for and against these recommendations are
given in the majority and minority reports of the panel. As
the closeness of the vote indicates, there are strong arguments
on both sides of the question. We hope that CAAA and the
Senate will give careful attention to both reports before
making their decisions.
With one exception, all the members of the panel felt that
the D grade should not be reinstituted. Experience at compa
rable institutions such as Yale suggests that it will not be
much used. More importantly, the comparison with the "no
credit" grade would be ambious and might penalize a student
who did poorly in a course more severely than one who gave
up entirely.
Neither the majority nor the minority believe that Re
commendations 1 and 2 will have much corrective effect on
grade inflation. This is a nationwide phenomenon, which has
been no more striking at Stanford than at comparable univer
sities which have retained traditional grading systems.
Our third recommendation, made unanimously, recog
nizes that the faculty is ultimately responsible for the grade
distribution, and expresses the hope that better information
will stabilize grades in accord with their intended definitions,
A for exceptional work, B for superior, C for satisfactory.
Recommendation 3. The registrar should regularly collect
and make public grade distributions in the various schools of
the University. In addition, each department chairman should
receive reports of grade distributions in individual courses
along with an indication of any large discrepancies from
relevant University averages.
(The panel feels that the Letter Grade Indicator ("LGI")
is a poor summary statistic for grades. It invites comparison
with the old GPA, but the comparison is spurious because of
the absence of D and F grades. We hope that the registrar's
office will not use the LGI in fulfilling recommendation 3,
nor for any other purposes.)
In making this recommendation it is not our intention
that a university-wide norm be enforced, only that individual
departments and instructors be given information on how
their grading practice compares with others.
We recognize that just what averages are relevant to a
particular course is a difficult question which is bound to
have no satisfactory answer in some situations. Nevertheless,
we feel that providing such information is the best practical
first step to ending the erosion of the meaning of the letter
grades. As a final point, grade distributions in individual
courses should be regarded as confidential information not
available for public dissemination.
"Indexing" has been suggested as a method of making the
transcript more informative. For example, one plan would be
to print the numerical average of all letter grades given in a
course (with A=4, B=3, C=2) next to the grade recorded on
the student's transcript. The panel recommends against such
schemes.
Grades at Stanford are supposed to be awarded on an
absolute basis, not relative to some curve. Of course, relative
standards are often employed, but indexing would effectively
force all instructors to grade relatively. This would be a major
change without major benefits, in the panel's point of view.
The panel found no evidence of increased abuse of the
incomplete ("I") grade under the current system. Use of this
grade has declined since 1969 as might be expected following
the elimination of the drop deadline. Recommendations 1
and 2, if enacted, can be expected to put new pressure on the
incomplete. Even if they are not enacted, the panel unani
mously felt that the current definition of the incomplete is
overly vague and should be returned to its previous state
ment.
Recommendation 4. The incomplete ("F') grade should
be restricted to cases where the student has completed a
substantial portion of the course work at a passing leveL The
time limit for fulfilling the incomplete is at the instructor's
discretion, but ordinarily should be no more than one calen
dar year from the date of the final examination.
On the technical question of how completed incompletes
should appear on the transcript, the panel voted 7 to 2 that if
Recommendations 1 and 2 are passed, it appear in the old
form with the "I" crossed out and the letter grade added
next to it. If Recommendations 1 and 2 are not passed, the
current practice of eliminating the "I" entirely should be
followed.

The comments we received from -faculty and students
make it clear that the established final date for selecting the
pass option rather than the letter grade is being flagrantly
ignored. It is not uncommon for students to request, and
instructors to grant, a Pass if the final examination turns out
to yield less than a B grade. Because of the expense and
difficulty involved, the panel was not prepared to recom
mend an external system that would force candidates for the
pass grade to file notice with the registrar before the official
deadline. We hope that the situation can be corrected by
more forceful reminders of the rules concerning the pass, and
of the importance of those rules in validating Stanford's
grading policy:
Recommendation 5. The Registrar's Office should widely
publicize the approach of each quarter's final date for
choosing the pass option.
Whether or not this voluntary approach will redress the
situation remains to be seen. If not, we would expect a return
to an external system in the near future.

ble abuses in the use of the incomplete grade ("I"), to the
effect of course drop deadline policies, and to the question of
the possible utility of the "D" grade.
The need for such a review was based on the general
principle of reviewing all major innovations, and also on
faculty criticisms of the new system.
The panel met regularly during the spring and fall quarters
of 1974. We conducted, opinion surveys of the faculty, stu
dents, and deans of prominent graduate schools. . . . Broadly
speaking, they indicate satisfaction with the new system,
especially among the students, but with strong reservations
on certain points.
Many faculty members were particularly disturbed by the
inflation of grades that has occurred since 1970.. . . Another
sore point, emphasized in the discussion following the panel's
preliminary report to the Faculty Senate in October, was the
waste of University resources occurring when students are
allowed to drop courses at any time during the quarter.
2. Conclusions and recommendations. The panel agreed
that it was virtually impossible to compromise between the
"record of accomplishment" and "historical record" systems
because they represent opposing conceptions of the grading
process and the purpose of the transcript.
-Operationally, the crucial distinction is the absence or
presence of a' firm drop deadline, after which a student
cannot leave a course without some notation on his perma
nent transcript. Such a deadline necessitates the use of a
negative grade to indicate unsuccessful performance in
courses not dropped.
By a majority of 5 to 4, the panel favored returning to the
historical record system. Consequently, it is recommended
that.
Recommendation 1. Firm deadlines for dropping courses
should be reinstated; the dates should be the same as those
currently in force for adding courses.
Recommendation 2. A single grade should be introduced
to indicate either unauthorized withdrawal from a course or
unsatisfactory performance in. a course. This grade should be
denoted "NC" (no credit) on the transcript A clear descrip
tion of the two meanings of the new grade will be included
on all transcripts.

The arguments for and against these recommendations are
given in the majority and minority reports of the panel. As
the closeness of the vote indicates, there are strong arguments
on both sides of the question. We hope that CAAA and the
Senate will give careful attention to both reports before
making their decisions.
With one exception, all the members of the panel felt that
the D grade should not be reinstituted. Experience at compa
rable institutions such as Yale suggests that it will not be
much used. More importantly, the comparison with the "no
credit" grade would be ambious and might penalize a student
who did poorly in a course more severely than one who gave
up entirely.
Neither the majority nor the minority believe that Re
commendations 1 and 2 will have much corrective effect on
grade inflation. This is a nationwide phenomenon, which has
been no more striking at Stanford than at comparable univer
sities which have retained traditional grading systems.
Our third recommendation, made unanimously, recog
nizes that the faculty is ultimately responsible for the grade
distribution, and expresses the hope that better information
will stabilize grades in accord with their intended definitions,
A for exceptional work, B for superior, C for satisfactory.
Recommendation 3. The registrar should regularly collect
and make public grade distributions in the various schools of
the University. In addition, each department chairman should
receive reports of grade distributions in individual courses
along with an indication of any large discrepancies from
relevant University averages.
(The panel feels that the Letter Grade Indicator ("LGI")
is a poor summary statistic for grades. It invites comparison
with the old GPA, but the comparison is spurious because of
the absence of D and F grades. We hope that the registrar's
office will not use the LGI in fulfilling recommendation 3,
nor for any other purposes.)
In making this recommendation it is not our intention
that a university-wide norm be enforced, only that individual
departments and instructors be given information on how
their grading practice compares with others.
We recognize that just what averages are relevant to a
particular course is a difficult question which is bound to
have no satisfactory answer in some situations. Nevertheless,
we feel that providing such information is the best practical
first step to ending the erosion of the meaning of the letter
grades. As a final point, grade distributions in individual
courses should be regarded as confidential information not
available for public dissemination.
"Indexing" has been suggested as a method of making the
transcript more informative. For example, one plan would be
to print the numerical average of all letter grades given in a
course (with A=4, B=3, C=2) next to the grade recorded on
the student's transcript. The panel recommends against such
schemes.
Grades at Stanford are supposed to be awarded on an
absolute basis, not relative to some curve. Of course, relative
standards are often employed, but indexing would effectively
force all instructors to grade relatively. This would be a major
change without major benefits, in the panel's point of view.
The panel found no evidence of increased abuse of the
incomplete ("I") grade under the current system. Use of this
grade has declined since 1969 as might be expected following
the elimination of the drop deadline. Recommendations 1
and 2, if enacted, can be expected to put new pressure on the
incomplete. Even if they are not enacted, the panel unani
mously felt that the current definition of the incomplete is
overly vague and should be returned to its previous state
ment.
Recommendation 4. The incomplete ("F') grade should
be restricted to cases where the student has completed a
substantial portion of the course work at a passing leveL The
time limit for fulfilling the incomplete is at the instructor's
discretion, but ordinarily should be no more than one calen
dar year from the date of the final examination.
On the technical question of how completed incompletes
should appear on the transcript, the panel voted 7 to 2 that if
Recommendations 1 and 2 are passed, it appear in the old
form with the "I" crossed out and the letter grade added
next to it. If Recommendations 1 and 2 are not passed, the
current practice of eliminating the "I" entirely should be
followed.

The comments we received from -faculty and students
make it clear that the established final date for selecting the
pass option rather than the letter grade is being flagrantly
ignored. It is not uncommon for students to request, and
instructors to grant, a Pass if the final examination turns out
to yield less than a B grade. Because of the expense and
difficulty involved, the panel was not prepared to recom
mend an external system that would force candidates for the
pass grade to file notice with the registrar before the official
deadline. We hope that the situation can be corrected by
more forceful reminders of the rules concerning the pass, and
of the importance of those rules in validating Stanford's
grading policy:
Recommendation 5. The Registrar's Office should widely
publicize the approach of each quarter's final date for
choosing the pass option.
Whether or not this voluntary approach will redress the
situation remains to be seen. If not, we would expect a return
to an external system in the near future.
1. Background. Stanford instituted a new system of
grading in 1970. This system was intended to be a pure
"record of accomplishment" which only recorded grades A,
B, C, or Pass. (Later plus and minus modifiers to the letter
grades were reinstated and also a "P" form of the Pass grade
indicating a course where no letter grades were awarded.)
Failing grades, including the D, were no longer recorded.
Simply by not taking the final examination a student could
drop a course with no record of that course appearing on his
transcript.
The new system, perhaps the most notable result of the
Study of Education at Stanford, represented a major change
from the traditional "historical record," which attempted to
record all of a student's educational experiences, unsuccessful
as well as successful.
The charge to the Ad Hoc Panel was:
1) To review and to recommend continuance or change in
the grading system established in 1970;
2) To conduct the review with special attention to possi

because they represent opposing conceptions of the grading
process and the purpose of the transcript.
-Operationally, the crucial distinction is the absence or
presence of a' firm drop deadline, after which a student
cannot leave a course without some notation on his perma
nent transcript. Such a deadline necessitates the use of a
negative grade to indicate unsuccessful performance in
courses not dropped.
By a majority of 5 to 4, the panel favored returning to the
historical record system. Consequently, it is recommended
that.
Recommendation 1. Firm deadlines for dropping courses
should be reinstated; the dates should be the same as those
currently in force for adding courses.
Recommendation 2. A single grade should be introduced
to indicate either unauthorized withdrawal from a course or
unsatisfactory performance in. a course. This grade should be
denoted "NC" (no credit) on the transcript A clear descrip
tion of the two meanings of the new grade will be included
on all transcripts.

The arguments for and against these recommendations are
given in the majority and minority reports of the panel. As
the closeness of the vote indicates, there are strong arguments
on both sides of the question. We hope that CAAA and the
Senate will give careful attention to both reports before
making their decisions.
With one exception, all the members of the panel felt that
the D grade should not be reinstituted. Experience at compa
rable institutions such as Yale suggests that it will not be
much used. More importantly, the comparison with the "no
credit" grade would be ambious and might penalize a student
who did poorly in a course more severely than one who gave
up entirely.
Neither the majority nor the minority believe that Re
commendations 1 and 2 will have much corrective effect on
grade inflation. This is a nationwide phenomenon, which has
been no more striking at Stanford than at comparable univer
sities which have retained traditional grading systems.
Our third recommendation, made unanimously, recog
nizes that the faculty is ultimately responsible for the grade
distribution, and expresses the hope that better information
will stabilize grades in accord with their intended definitions,
A for exceptional work, B for superior, C for satisfactory.
Recommendation 3. The registrar should regularly collect
and make public grade distributions in the various schools of
the University. In addition, each department chairman should
receive reports of grade distributions in individual courses
along with an indication of any large discrepancies from
relevant University averages.
(The panel feels that the Letter Grade Indicator ("LGI")
is a poor summary statistic for grades. It invites comparison
with the old GPA, but the comparison is spurious because of
the absence of D and F grades. We hope that the registrar's
office will not use the LGI in fulfilling recommendation 3,
nor for any other purposes.)
In making this recommendation it is not our intention
that a university-wide norm be enforced, only that individual
departments and instructors be given information on how
their grading practice compares with others.
We recognize that just what averages are relevant to a
particular course is a difficult question which is bound to
have no satisfactory answer in some situations. Nevertheless,
we feel that providing such information is the best practical
first step to ending the erosion of the meaning of the letter
grades. As a final point, grade distributions in individual
courses should be regarded as confidential information not
available for public dissemination.
"Indexing" has been suggested as a method of making the
transcript more informative. For example, one plan would be
to print the numerical average of all letter grades given in a
course (with A=4, B=3, C=2) next to the grade recorded on
the student's transcript. The panel recommends against such
schemes.
Grades at Stanford are supposed to be awarded on an
absolute basis, not relative to some curve. Of course, relative
standards are often employed, but indexing would effectively
force all instructors to grade relatively. This would be a major
change without major benefits, in the panel's point of view.
The panel found no evidence of increased abuse of the
incomplete ("I") grade under the current system. Use of this
grade has declined since 1969 as might be expected following
the elimination of the drop deadline. Recommendations 1
and 2, if enacted, can be expected to put new pressure on the
incomplete. Even if they are not enacted, the panel unani
mously felt that the current definition of the incomplete is
overly vague and should be returned to its previous state
ment.
Recommendation 4. The incomplete ("F') grade should
be restricted to cases where the student has completed a
substantial portion of the course work at a passing leveL The
time limit for fulfilling the incomplete is at the instructor's
discretion, but ordinarily should be no more than one calen
dar year from the date of the final examination.
On the technical question of how completed incompletes
should appear on the transcript, the panel voted 7 to 2 that if
Recommendations 1 and 2 are passed, it appear in the old
form with the "I" crossed out and the letter grade added
next to it. If Recommendations 1 and 2 are not passed, the
current practice of eliminating the "I" entirely should be
followed.

The comments we received from -faculty and students
make it clear that the established final date for selecting the
pass option rather than the letter grade is being flagrantly
ignored. It is not uncommon for students to request, and
instructors to grant, a Pass if the final examination turns out
to yield less than a B grade. Because of the expense and
difficulty involved, the panel was not prepared to recom
mend an external system that would force candidates for the
pass grade to file notice with the registrar before the official
deadline. We hope that the situation can be corrected by
more forceful reminders of the rules concerning the pass, and
of the importance of those rules in validating Stanford's
grading policy:
Recommendation 5. The Registrar's Office should widely
publicize the approach of each quarter's final date for
choosing the pass option.
Whether or not this voluntary approach will redress the
situation remains to be seen. If not, we would expect a return
to an external system in the near future.
1. Background. Stanford instituted a new system of
grading in 1970. This system was intended to be a pure
"record of accomplishment" which only recorded grades A,
B, C, or Pass. (Later plus and minus modifiers to the letter
grades were reinstated and also a "P" form of the Pass grade
indicating a course where no letter grades were awarded.)
Failing grades, including the D, were no longer recorded.
Simply by not taking the final examination a student could
drop a course with no record of that course appearing on his
transcript.
The new system, perhaps the most notable result of the
Study of Education at Stanford, represented a major change
from the traditional "historical record," which attempted to
record all of a student's educational experiences, unsuccessful
as well as successful.
The charge to the Ad Hoc Panel was:
1) To review and to recommend continuance or change in
the grading system established in 1970;
2) To conduct the review with special attention to possi
ble abuses in the use of the incomplete grade ("I"), to the
effect of course drop deadline policies, and to the question of
the possible utility of the "D" grade.
The need for such a review was based on the general
principle of reviewing all major innovations, and also on
faculty criticisms of the new system.
The panel met regularly during the spring and fall quarters
of 1974. We conducted, opinion surveys of the faculty, stu
dents, and deans of prominent graduate schools. . . . Broadly
speaking, they indicate satisfaction with the new system,
especially among the students, but with strong reservations
on certain points.
Many faculty members were particularly disturbed by the
inflation of grades that has occurred since 1970.. . . Another
sore point, emphasized in the discussion following the panel's
preliminary report to the Faculty Senate in October, was the
waste of University resources occurring when students are
allowed to drop courses at any time during the quarter.

on both sides of the question. We hope that CAAA and the
Senate will give careful attention to both reports before
making their decisions.
With one exception, all the members of the panel felt that
the D grade should not be reinstituted. Experience at compa
rable institutions such as Yale suggests that it will not be
much used. More importantly, the comparison with the "no
credit" grade would be ambious and might penalize a student
who did poorly in a course more severely than one who gave
up entirely.
Neither the majority nor the minority believe that Re
commendations 1 and 2 will have much corrective effect on
grade inflation. This is a nationwide phenomenon, which has
been no more striking at Stanford than at comparable univer
sities which have retained traditional grading systems.
Our third recommendation, made unanimously, recog
nizes that the faculty is ultimately responsible for the grade
distribution, and expresses the hope that better information
will stabilize grades in accord with their intended definitions,
A for exceptional work, B for superior, C for satisfactory.
Recommendation 3. The registrar should regularly collect
and make public grade distributions in the various schools of
the University. In addition, each department chairman should
receive reports of grade distributions in individual courses
along with an indication of any large discrepancies from
relevant University averages.
(The panel feels that the Letter Grade Indicator ("LGI")
is a poor summary statistic for grades. It invites comparison
with the old GPA, but the comparison is spurious because of
the absence of D and F grades. We hope that the registrar's
office will not use the LGI in fulfilling recommendation 3,
nor for any other purposes.)
In making this recommendation it is not our intention
that a university-wide norm be enforced, only that individual
departments and instructors be given information on how
their grading practice compares with others.
We recognize that just what averages are relevant to a
particular course is a difficult question which is bound to
have no satisfactory answer in some situations. Nevertheless,
we feel that providing such information is the best practical
first step to ending the erosion of the meaning of the letter
grades. As a final point, grade distributions in individual
courses should be regarded as confidential information not
available for public dissemination.
"Indexing" has been suggested as a method of making the
transcript more informative. For example, one plan would be
to print the numerical average of all letter grades given in a
course (with A=4, B=3, C=2) next to the grade recorded on
the student's transcript. The panel recommends against such
schemes.
Grades at Stanford are supposed to be awarded on an
absolute basis, not relative to some curve. Of course, relative
standards are often employed, but indexing would effectively
force all instructors to grade relatively. This would be a major
change without major benefits, in the panel's point of view.
The panel found no evidence of increased abuse of the
incomplete ("I") grade under the current system. Use of this
grade has declined since 1969 as might be expected following
the elimination of the drop deadline. Recommendations 1
and 2, if enacted, can be expected to put new pressure on the
incomplete. Even if they are not enacted, the panel unani
mously felt that the current definition of the incomplete is
overly vague and should be returned to its previous state
ment.
Recommendation 4. The incomplete ("F') grade should
be restricted to cases where the student has completed a
substantial portion of the course work at a passing leveL The
time limit for fulfilling the incomplete is at the instructor's
discretion, but ordinarily should be no more than one calen
dar year from the date of the final examination.
On the technical question of how completed incompletes
should appear on the transcript, the panel voted 7 to 2 that if
Recommendations 1 and 2 are passed, it appear in the old
form with the "I" crossed out and the letter grade added
next to it. If Recommendations 1 and 2 are not passed, the
current practice of eliminating the "I" entirely should be
followed.

The comments we received from -faculty and students
make it clear that the established final date for selecting the
pass option rather than the letter grade is being flagrantly
ignored. It is not uncommon for students to request, and
instructors to grant, a Pass if the final examination turns out
to yield less than a B grade. Because of the expense and
difficulty involved, the panel was not prepared to recom
mend an external system that would force candidates for the
pass grade to file notice with the registrar before the official
deadline. We hope that the situation can be corrected by
more forceful reminders of the rules concerning the pass, and
of the importance of those rules in validating Stanford's
grading policy:
Recommendation 5. The Registrar's Office should widely
publicize the approach of each quarter's final date for
choosing the pass option.
Whether or not this voluntary approach will redress the
situation remains to be seen. If not, we would expect a return
to an external system in the near future.
1. Background. Stanford instituted a new system of
grading in 1970. This system was intended to be a pure
"record of accomplishment" which only recorded grades A,
B, C, or Pass. (Later plus and minus modifiers to the letter
grades were reinstated and also a "P" form of the Pass grade
indicating a course where no letter grades were awarded.)
Failing grades, including the D, were no longer recorded.
Simply by not taking the final examination a student could
drop a course with no record of that course appearing on his
transcript.
The new system, perhaps the most notable result of the
Study of Education at Stanford, represented a major change
from the traditional "historical record," which attempted to
record all of a student's educational experiences, unsuccessful
as well as successful.
The charge to the Ad Hoc Panel was:
1) To review and to recommend continuance or change in
the grading system established in 1970;
2) To conduct the review with special attention to possi
ble abuses in the use of the incomplete grade ("I"), to the
effect of course drop deadline policies, and to the question of
the possible utility of the "D" grade.
The need for such a review was based on the general
principle of reviewing all major innovations, and also on
faculty criticisms of the new system.
The panel met regularly during the spring and fall quarters
of 1974. We conducted, opinion surveys of the faculty, stu
dents, and deans of prominent graduate schools. . . . Broadly
speaking, they indicate satisfaction with the new system,
especially among the students, but with strong reservations
on certain points.
Many faculty members were particularly disturbed by the
inflation of grades that has occurred since 1970.. . . Another
sore point, emphasized in the discussion following the panel's
preliminary report to the Faculty Senate in October, was the
waste of University resources occurring when students are
allowed to drop courses at any time during the quarter.
2. Conclusions and recommendations. The panel agreed
that it was virtually impossible to compromise between the
"record of accomplishment" and "historical record" systems
because they represent opposing conceptions of the grading
process and the purpose of the transcript.
-Operationally, the crucial distinction is the absence or
presence of a' firm drop deadline, after which a student
cannot leave a course without some notation on his perma
nent transcript. Such a deadline necessitates the use of a
negative grade to indicate unsuccessful performance in
courses not dropped.
By a majority of 5 to 4, the panel favored returning to the
historical record system. Consequently, it is recommended
that.
Recommendation 1. Firm deadlines for dropping courses
should be reinstated; the dates should be the same as those
currently in force for adding courses.
Recommendation 2. A single grade should be introduced
to indicate either unauthorized withdrawal from a course or
unsatisfactory performance in. a course. This grade should be
denoted "NC" (no credit) on the transcript A clear descrip
tion of the two meanings of the new grade will be included
on all transcripts.

The arguments for and against these recommendations are
given in the majority and minority reports of the panel. As
the closeness of the vote indicates, there are strong arguments
on both sides of the question. We hope that CAAA and the
Senate will give careful attention to both reports before
making their decisions.
