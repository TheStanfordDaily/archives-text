# Majority Report
## 
### 
The following changes in the Stanford grading system are
proposed by a majority of the CAAA Grading Panel.
1. A single grade should be introduced to indicate either
unauthorized withdrawal from a course or unsatisfactory
performance in a course.
2. Firm deadlines for dropping courses should be institu
ted; the dates should be the same as those currently in force
for adding courses.
3. The grade of incomplete should be redefined to indi
cate completion of a substantial part of a course with passing
grades.
One member of the majority strongly favors the D grade.
In addition one member of the minority favors returning to
the D if the recommended changes are adopted. The attitude
of the remaining members of the majority varies from slightly
in favor to somewhat opposed to reinstitution of the D.
We believe that the proposed changes, if adopted, will a)
make the Stanford transcript a more complete (and we be
lieve, more valid) record of performance, b) encourage stu
dents to make definite and early choices among their options,
c) alert the advisor to students who are having academic
difficulties.
Rationale for Recommendation 1
All but one of the majority group believe it desirable that
the Stanford transcript provide an honest and complete pic
ture of a student's academic performance.
Given this belief, it follows that the transcript should
record not only a student's successes but also his failures to
complete work satisfactorily for whatever reason other than
illness or other hardship over which he has no control; in the
latter instances a grade of incomplete, if carefully defined,
carries no onus. .
Unavoidably a student's transcript plays an important-in
deed often critical-role in decisions by others that affect his
career choice. The present Stanford transcript, presenting as
it does only positive information, withholds data that would,
in at least some users' eyes, be valuable in selection and
admission processes. Thus, omission of negative data penal
izes students with the best records.
It can be postulated that no grading scheme reflects only
positive achievement in the eyes of the student and the
transcript user. Under the old system, the D and F repre
sented inferior performance, but the C was a reasonably
respectable grade. Now, it appears, the C stands for catastro

phe and the B for borderline respectability. Perhaps pride and
self esteem among students require an indicator of inferior
performance; if we were to change to a two-grade system the
B might suffer the same fate as the current C.
It can, of course, be argued that no causal relationship
exists between the current pejorative status of the C and the
demise of the D and F. Some of us are unable to accept such
an argument fully, however, and believe that the proposed
change may have the salutary effect of revalidating the C.
The present grading system arose out of a laudable desire
to a) deemphasize grades as a goal and b) to provide the
poorly-prepared student time to catch up with his classmates
without indicators of failure appearing on his record. Unfor
tunately, we can find little evidence to suggest that the
current system has reduced competition for grades. On the
other hand, the desired effect on the less well-prepared stu
dent has probably been realized to some degree. It seems to
us, however, that good advising and the auditing option could
ameliorate the effect of the proposed new grade on these
students. Furthermore, the appearance in the record of a
satisfactory grade in a course after an earlier failure is, in
some eyes, not an indication of failure but, indeed, of per
severence and success.
Rationale for Recommendation 2
A formal mechanism for dropping courses has the advan
tage of alerting the advisor to students having academic
problems. All too often those students in most need of help
are the ones who seem reluctant to seek it out; the proposed
change enables the advisor to take the initiative in reaching
thenu
Some of us also believe that the addition of drop dead
lines will have the desirable effect of encouraging students to
anticipate academic problems and to take steps to solve
them. In contrast, the current system seems to encourage
irresponsible behavior in a significant number of students.
Rationale for Recommendation 3
This recommendation was unanimously agreed upon by
both the majority and minority.
We believe that the grade of incomplete should be
awarded only when a student has completed a substantial
part of a course with satisfactory grades but for any of
several reasons, acceptable to the instructor, has failed to
finish the required work on time.
Incomplete then becomes a satisfactory grade unless the
student fails to complete the required work after a reasonable
period. It may be desirable that the transcript give no indica
tion of an (n complete that has been made up.
