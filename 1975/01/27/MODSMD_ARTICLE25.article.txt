In 1970 Stanford became one of the first leading colle
giate institutions to abandon the practice of recording failure
on its transcripts. This was, perhaps, the greatest single
change resulting from the Study of Education at Stanford.
We believe that the change has produced three major
benefits:
1) Increased recognition of grades as a measure of intellec
tual accomplishment rather than as a disciplinary tool, with a
consequent improvement of the teacher-student relationship.
2) Greater opportunity .for all students, but especially
those with poorer than average academic backgrounds, to
attempt important courses they may or may not be prepared
for.
3) Elimination of a large amount of unpleasant academic
bookkeeping connected with the old drop-deadline system,
and of the occasional but genuine inequities this system and
the attendant apparatus of committees, petitions, etc. engen
dered.

Now it is proposed to return to a slightly modified version
of the old system. There is certainly plenty of dissatisfaction
with the current state of academic affairs.
Our poll of the faculty and the discussion in the Aca
demic Senate focused on two particular concerns:
1) The trend toward higher grades and the absence of
failure grades, which has reduced the value of the transcript
to distinguish between good and bad scholarship.
2) The waste of university resources due to students
dropping courses late in the quarter.
These are serious problems, but the evidence we have
suggests that they will not be solved by a return to the old
system. Grade inflation is a nation-wide phenomenon which
has been no more virulent at Stanford than at comparable
institutions like Harvard which have retained the "F" grade.
Fundamentally, grades are high because the faculty wishes
to give high grades, not because of the grading system. If we
are dissatisfied with the grade distribution at Stanford then
we must attempt to change the faculty's attitude toward the
meaning of the various grades.
A Final drop deadline of the type proposed, some seven
weeks into the quarter, is unlikely to reduce the number of
sections conducted for any one course. Such a decrease might
be effected by a firm two week deadline, but nobody on the
Committee is willing to endorse such an inflexible policy for
the sake of what would probably still be just a small savings
in university resources.
It is argued that the "historical record" form of tran
script, which includes notations for courses mot completed
satisfactorily, is more honest and informative than the pre
sent "record of accomplishment." We believe that Stanford's
present system is perfectly honest in that it is clearly and
completely defined for all to see, and that there is no second
set of grades kept secretly in the Registrar's office (as in the
Yale system).
We do not agree that an "A" on the transcript means any
less now because a student may have participated in the
course more than once. First of all, this has always been
possible at Stanford, and will continue to be possible even if
we return to the old system, through the auditing process.
It may mean the student has learned less than another
who gets his "A" the first time through the course, but it
may only mean that he has started from a lower level of
preparation. Sometimes, of course, slow learning is more
profound than fast learning.
The point of the "record of achievement" philosophy is
that the student has achieved "A" level accomplishment in
the subject matter, and this is what the transcript should
convey. The honesty of the present system is that the
transcript is not presented as an I.Q. test or a character
reference, but only as a record of accomplishment.
The principal argument offered for returning to the
drop-deadline/punitive grade system is that it will force
students to be more serious about their academic programs.
Certainly students will worry more' about continuing in a
course they are not doing well in, and will feel greater
pressure once the deadline has been passed.
Recent experience strongly suggests that this is not at all
the same thing as being more interested in the subject matter
of the course. We feel that the intellectual atmosphere at
Stanford has not diminished, and that returning to the old
system is a step backwards.
Our present system of grading is the product of considera
ble thought and effort on the part of SES planners. It has
shown some genuine advantages and no obvious fatal flaws
since its inception in 1970. It would be a mistake to abandon
it so quickly now, especially without a clear idea of what is
to be gained by a return to the past.
