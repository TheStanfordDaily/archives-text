4. Do you think if the D grade were reinstated at
Stanford your chances for favorable consideration on the

part of graduate schools would be enhanced? Yes-definitely,

5. In your opinion, what effect would added gradations
in the grading scale have on the present level of competition
among students for grades? Increased competition, 27; no
