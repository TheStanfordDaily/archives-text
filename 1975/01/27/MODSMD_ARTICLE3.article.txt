# Unique Machine Unveiled Here Explodes Atoms Of Cancer Cells
## 
### JOHN FREED 
A machine which kills cancer cells
by causing miniature nuclear
explosions inside the body was
unveiled Friday by five scientists here.
The device, a major advance in
cancer therapy research, shoots a
stream of sub-atomic pion particles
into the atoms of cancer cells, making
them explode, according to the
researchers.
But three to five years of
laboratory experiments lie ahead
before the machine can be tried on
humans. Called a medical pion
generator (MPG), the machine has
been in the works for five years
already.
Little Damage
Radiology Prof. Henry S. Kaplan, a
member of the team which developed
the tool, said the pion stream can kill
tumors while causing little damage to
nearby healthy tissues.
Kaplan and Radiology Department
Chairman Malcolm Bagshaw
announced the development with
co-researchers Physics Profs. Alan
Schwettman and William Fairbank and
Research Physicist Douglas Boyd.
"We're now confident our design
concept will work," Kaplan said at a
conference in Palo Alto. "There's no
doubt about it."
Similar work is being done in
Europe, Canada and Los Alamos,
N.M., but only the Stanford team has
worked exclusively on a machine
which can be installed in a hospital,
according to Radiology Prof. David
Pistenma.
"Our device is the only one which
has been designed from the outset to
be a hospital facility," Pistenma said.
Greater Ease
More patients can be treated with
greater ease at a hospital-based center,
he added.
"Many of the patients are going to
bell quite sick, and it's to their
advantage to be treated near to the

intensive care facilities of a hospital,"
Pistenma explained.
The MPG simultaneously shoots
beams of pions, also called pi-mesons,
at a tumor from 60 different
directions.
As they travel through the body,
the pions lose speed and eventually are
trapped inside the tumor's atoms.
When the pion crashes into an atomic
nucleus, the atom explodes, destroying
nearby cancerous tissue.
Accurate Aim
Because the pion streams can be
aimed very accurately, damage to
healthy tissues is minimal, the

scientists reported.
On the other hand, conventional
X-ray therapy can damage normal
cells, because the rays gradually lose
strength as they pass through humans.
"Because the nuclear fragments
produced in this explosion cause such
great destruction, pion therapy is j
expected to be about three times as
effective in killing tumor cells as
X-rays, given a comparable radiation
dose," Bagshaw commented.
More Effective
But pion radiation can be delivered
at 10 times the intensity of X-rays
without harm, according to Kaplan.

Hence, the treatment levels are 30
times as effective as currently used
therapy.
"About 65,000 persons treated
with radiation in the U.S. don't get the
tumor eradicated," Kaplan noted.
"That's our target population."
Hospitals could install four MPGs
operating off. of one nuclear
accelerator at a cost of $8 to $lO
million, not far from the cost of a
radiotherapy facility at a medical
center, according to the scientists.
The generator was designed and
built with about $1 million in grants
from the National Science Foundation
(NSF). Further funding of

dose," Bagshaw commented.
More Effective
But pion radiation can be delivered
at 10 times the intensity of X-rays
without harm, according to Kaplan.

Hence, the treatment levels are 30
times as effective as currently used
therapy.
"About 65,000 persons treated
with radiation in the U.S. don't get the
tumor eradicated," Kaplan noted.
"That's our target population."
Hospitals could install four MPGs
operating off. of one nuclear
accelerator at a cost of $8 to $lO
million, not far from the cost of a
radiotherapy facility at a medical
center, according to the scientists.
The generator was designed and
built with about $1 million in grants
from the National Science Foundation
(NSF). Further funding of
A machine which kills cancer cells
by causing miniature nuclear
explosions inside the body was
unveiled Friday by five scientists here.
The device, a major advance in
cancer therapy research, shoots a
stream of sub-atomic pion particles
into the atoms of cancer cells, making
them explode, according to the
researchers.
But three to five years of
laboratory experiments lie ahead
before the machine can be tried on
humans. Called a medical pion
generator (MPG), the machine has
been in the works for five years
already.
Little Damage
Radiology Prof. Henry S. Kaplan, a
member of the team which developed
the tool, said the pion stream can kill
tumors while causing little damage to
nearby healthy tissues.
Kaplan and Radiology Department
Chairman Malcolm Bagshaw
announced the development with
co-researchers Physics Profs. Alan
Schwettman and William Fairbank and
Research Physicist Douglas Boyd.
"We're now confident our design
concept will work," Kaplan said at a
conference in Palo Alto. "There's no
doubt about it."
Similar work is being done in
Europe, Canada and Los Alamos,
N.M., but only the Stanford team has
worked exclusively on a machine
which can be installed in a hospital,
according to Radiology Prof. David
Pistenma.
"Our device is the only one which
has been designed from the outset to
be a hospital facility," Pistenma said.
Greater Ease
More patients can be treated with
greater ease at a hospital-based center,
he added.
"Many of the patients are going to
bell quite sick, and it's to their
advantage to be treated near to the

intensive care facilities of a hospital,"
Pistenma explained.
The MPG simultaneously shoots
beams of pions, also called pi-mesons,
at a tumor from 60 different
directions.
As they travel through the body,
the pions lose speed and eventually are
trapped inside the tumor's atoms.
When the pion crashes into an atomic
nucleus, the atom explodes, destroying
nearby cancerous tissue.
Accurate Aim
Because the pion streams can be
aimed very accurately, damage to
healthy tissues is minimal, the

scientists reported.
On the other hand, conventional
X-ray therapy can damage normal
cells, because the rays gradually lose
strength as they pass through humans.
"Because the nuclear fragments
produced in this explosion cause such
great destruction, pion therapy is j
expected to be about three times as
effective in killing tumor cells as
X-rays, given a comparable radiation
dose," Bagshaw commented.
