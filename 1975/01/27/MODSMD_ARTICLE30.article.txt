## Cards Host Highly Touted Gaels 
### MARK FUNK 
San Francisco State brings its
highly touted small college
wrestling squad to Maples Pavilion
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in search
of a lofty national ranking and a
continued winning streak.
And Stanford had better be
ready for them.
The Gaels, currently rated 10th
in the NCAA small college
wrestling poll, have been quietly
developing one of the better mat
programs among college division
teams on the West Coast. They
perform well in dual meets and
have had good success on the
tournament circuit.
"We are going to have to be in
top shape to defeat this team,"
wrestling coach Joe DeMeo said
over the weekend. "The guys
know they have a good program
and will be tough to stop."
The Cards, who broke a record
for most wins in a single season
Thursday with a decisive 29-18
victory over Santa Barbara, were

not "in top shape" at Saturday's
San Francisco Invitational
Tournament. They looked a little
flat after the record breaking
performance.
At the San Francisco
tournament, which was won by
Arizona State, only one Cardinal
grappler wrestled his way to the
championship round. John Govea,
who has turned in a steady
performance this year for DeMeo
and his charges, won two matches
to get into the finals, but lost the
blue ribbon when he fell to Cal
State-Bakersfield's Steve Bull. He
lost by a decision.

The only other Stanford
wrestler to place high was Ken
Krebs. He finished third in the
142-pound weight class.
Krebs lost to the eventual
"Outstanding Wrestler of the
Tournament" recipient.
The Cardinals were hampered
by injuries throughout the
tournament. All-American Chris
Horpel, who was eliminated from
competition in the third round,
was bothered by injuries he has
been unable to shake for most of
the latter half of the season. They
have affected his performance.

118-pounder Malcolm Scott,
126-pounder Lester Yoshida and
Bob Keating at 134 missed the
tournament with injuries. Dave
Schmeling subbed for Scott, but
Stanford was forced to forfeit the
other weight classes.
The San Francisco State match
kicks off a heavy week of
competition for the Stanford
wrestlers. Friday, they travel to
Areata to take on Humboldt State
while Saturday afternoon they
wrestle the University of Puget
Sound and Pacific at the same
site.

BEST ACTION OF THE NIGHT - The only times the crowd at Maples Pavilion Friday night really got
excited were at halftime, when a group of miniature players (even smaller than Air Force) took the floor.
This kid's free throw form isn't perfect, but then, Air Force only shot 4 of 11 from the line.

to get into the finals, but lost the
blue ribbon when he fell to Cal
State-Bakersfield's Steve Bull. He
lost by a decision.

The only other Stanford
wrestler to place high was Ken
Krebs. He finished third in the
142-pound weight class.
Krebs lost to the eventual
"Outstanding Wrestler of the
Tournament" recipient.
The Cardinals were hampered
by injuries throughout the
tournament. All-American Chris
Horpel, who was eliminated from
competition in the third round,
was bothered by injuries he has
been unable to shake for most of
the latter half of the season. They
have affected his performance.

118-pounder Malcolm Scott,
126-pounder Lester Yoshida and
Bob Keating at 134 missed the
tournament with injuries. Dave
Schmeling subbed for Scott, but
Stanford was forced to forfeit the
other weight classes.
The San Francisco State match
kicks off a heavy week of
competition for the Stanford
wrestlers. Friday, they travel to
Areata to take on Humboldt State
while Saturday afternoon they
wrestle the University of Puget
Sound and Pacific at the same
site.

BEST ACTION OF THE NIGHT - The only times the crowd at Maples Pavilion Friday night really got
excited were at halftime, when a group of miniature players (even smaller than Air Force) took the floor.
This kid's free throw form isn't perfect, but then, Air Force only shot 4 of 11 from the line.
San Francisco State brings its
highly touted small college
wrestling squad to Maples Pavilion
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in search
of a lofty national ranking and a
continued winning streak.
And Stanford had better be
ready for them.
The Gaels, currently rated 10th
in the NCAA small college
wrestling poll, have been quietly
developing one of the better mat
programs among college division
teams on the West Coast. They
perform well in dual meets and
have had good success on the
tournament circuit.
"We are going to have to be in
top shape to defeat this team,"
wrestling coach Joe DeMeo said
over the weekend. "The guys
know they have a good program
and will be tough to stop."
The Cards, who broke a record
for most wins in a single season
Thursday with a decisive 29-18
victory over Santa Barbara, were

not "in top shape" at Saturday's
San Francisco Invitational
Tournament. They looked a little
flat after the record breaking
performance.
At the San Francisco
tournament, which was won by
Arizona State, only one Cardinal
grappler wrestled his way to the
championship round. John Govea,
who has turned in a steady
performance this year for DeMeo
and his charges, won two matches
to get into the finals, but lost the
blue ribbon when he fell to Cal
State-Bakersfield's Steve Bull. He
lost by a decision.

Krebs. He finished third in the
