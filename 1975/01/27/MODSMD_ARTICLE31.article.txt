# Swimmers Outclass Pacific
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The epitome of a confident
coach, Stanford mentor Jim
Gaughran called in his swimmers
for an 8 a.m. workout Saturday.
About the same time the Cards
were finishing up the final laps of
their 4000-yard workout, the U.
of Pacific Tigers were leaving
Stockton for their 1 p.m.
encounter with those same
Cardinals.
The outclassed Tigers should
have stayed in Stockton, as
Stanford rolled to an 81-30
slaughter, winning every single
event except the diving.
As the Stanford medley relay
team of Randy Whitchurch, Stu
Corliss, Brian Roux and Bruce
Goodwin eased into first place in
the initial event of the day, it
became readily apparent that UOP
was not'of the same calibre as the
Cards. The relay team's time of
3:32.3 was a meet record, the first
of nine to be broken.
Mike Bruner continued his
winning ways in the 1000-yard
free, breaking Washington star
Rick Demont's pool record (set in
last year's dual meet) with a
9:17.2 clocking. The seemingly
tireless freshman also set a pool
and meet record in his 200-yard
butterfly win, and anchored the
winning 400-yard free relay team.
Junior Craig Van Zandt was
also a double winfier, setting meet
records in the 200- and 400-yard
freestyle events (clocked at 1:44.7
and 3:42, respectively). Van
Zandt, who transferred from
Foothill College last year, has
swum extremely well all year.
One has difficulty
remembering the last time John
Hencken actually had a bad meet.
His exploits are so frequent that
they tend to become routine and
unnoticed. The junior
breaststroker demonstrated his
versatility by taking the 200
individual medley in 1:56.5,
eclipsing the old meet record.
Hencken, as usual, also won the
200-yard breaststroke going away.
