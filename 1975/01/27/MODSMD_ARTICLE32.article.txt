# Cards Win A Yawner
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Someone called them "Air
Farce" and whoever it was is
probably right. But Force or
Farce, the Cardinal basketball
team demoralized the Falcons in
45 seconds Friday night and then,
almost anticlimactically, went on
to win 69-48.
The game didn't prove a whole
lot.
Mostly, it showed that the
Cards aren't choking to teams
with 6-4 centers. And that's an
improvement.
The whole thing must have
resembled a bad dream for the
Falcons.
After a bad pass killed
Stanford's opening offensive
drive, Air Force brought the ball
down court and passed it around
the key, looking for a break in the
Card defense.
There wasn't one. The Falcons
passed, and passed, and passed,
and finally called a time-out with
only 45 seconds gone in the game.
They couldn't get within 15 feet
of the basket.
One Success
Whatever Air Force coach
Hank Egan told his players, it
must have worked, because the
Falcons came back in, passed the
ball around for another 30
seconds, and then forward Eken
drove around Rich Kelley and Ed
Schweitzer to score a lay-up. Air
Force took the lead, 2-0.
In the next 10 minutes Air
Force scored once, while Stanford

reeled off 18 points. The game
was over, but two-thirds of the
regulation time remained.
Card coach Howie Dallmar put
in some substitutes, but Air Force
still couldn't seem to do anything.
It was like watching an intramural
mismatch. The Falcons looked
like they were stalling.
For fans who had witnessed
the Weekend of Miracles it was
pretty boring. First they booed
the nonexistent Falcon offense.
Then they singled out Mike
Sevier, who looked like a drill
sergeant, and heckled him with
chants of "Moose! Moose!
Moose!"
Half time Show
At halftime things picked up a
little. A bunch of little kids
(about seven years old) played an
exhibition that brought the crowd
to its feet. The Sunset reds beat
the Sunset whites. Kid number
5/8 was impressive. The band
shouted, "Air Force, don't you
know it's halftime?" It was very
entertaining.
But the big (in a relative sense)
people came back out to play
another 20 minutes, and Stanford
had a 31 point lead before
Dallmar cleared the bench.
Footloose and fumble-fingered,
the subs didn't score much but
made things interesting. Dallmar
ran a zone defense for a while and
Air Force put in some 6-6 'giants'
and eventually the game ended,
making everyone happy. Sort of.
"It was frustrating the way
they [Air Force] control the
ball," Dallmar said after the game,
"but our size was too much for
them."

Dallmar admitted that not
much can be learned from a game
like this one, but said "We've got
to work more to get the
percentage shots."
It was, all in all, a game easily
forgotten.
Houston Game
Tonight, the Cards play
Houston, and Dallmar is not
unconcerned. The Cougars are
"completely different" from Air
Force, he said.
Houston is tall.

Led by 6-9 Louis Dunbar, the
Cougars own a formidable
offense, averaging 88.4 points per
game. They are 7-8 overall, but

that record is misleading. Five of
their first six games were against
teams like Louisville, North
Carolina and Alabama. And
they've played USC twice, losing
at home by only one point.
Saturday they defeated
Nevada-Reno.
The Cougars have two
nationally ranked scorers. Dunbar
is ranked 15th with a 24.6 point
average, and 6-4 guard Otis
Birdsong ranks 13th nationally
with a 25.1 point average. The
other starters are David Marrs
(6-8), Maurice Presley (6-10), and
Tony Smith (6-2).
"Houston is an explosive
team," Dallmar said, "and we
hope that we can play our game.
They're a team that waits for you
to make a mistake."

Dale Peters made their first Maples
appearances and both scored.
Someone called them "Air
Farce" and whoever it was is
probably right. But Force or
Farce, the Cardinal basketball
team demoralized the Falcons in
45 seconds Friday night and then,
almost anticlimactically, went on
to win 69-48.
The game didn't prove a whole
lot.
Mostly, it showed that the
Cards aren't choking to teams
with 6-4 centers. And that's an
improvement.
The whole thing must have
resembled a bad dream for the
Falcons.
After a bad pass killed
Stanford's opening offensive
drive, Air Force brought the ball
down court and passed it around
the key, looking for a break in the
Card defense.
There wasn't one. The Falcons
passed, and passed, and passed,
and finally called a time-out with
only 45 seconds gone in the game.
They couldn't get within 15 feet
of the basket.
One Success
Whatever Air Force coach
Hank Egan told his players, it
must have worked, because the
Falcons came back in, passed the
ball around for another 30
seconds, and then forward Eken
drove around Rich Kelley and Ed
Schweitzer to score a lay-up. Air
Force took the lead, 2-0.
In the next 10 minutes Air
Force scored once, while Stanford

reeled off 18 points. The game
was over, but two-thirds of the
regulation time remained.
Card coach Howie Dallmar put
in some substitutes, but Air Force
still couldn't seem to do anything.
It was like watching an intramural
mismatch. The Falcons looked
like they were stalling.
For fans who had witnessed
the Weekend of Miracles it was
pretty boring. First they booed
the nonexistent Falcon offense.
Then they singled out Mike
Sevier, who looked like a drill
sergeant, and heckled him with
chants of "Moose! Moose!
Moose!"
Half time Show
At halftime things picked up a
little. A bunch of little kids
(about seven years old) played an
exhibition that brought the crowd
to its feet. The Sunset reds beat
the Sunset whites. Kid number
5/8 was impressive. The band
shouted, "Air Force, don't you
know it's halftime?" It was very
entertaining.
But the big (in a relative sense)
people came back out to play
another 20 minutes, and Stanford
had a 31 point lead before
Dallmar cleared the bench.
Footloose and fumble-fingered,
the subs didn't score much but
made things interesting. Dallmar
ran a zone defense for a while and
Air Force put in some 6-6 'giants'
and eventually the game ended,
making everyone happy. Sort of.
"It was frustrating the way
they [Air Force] control the
ball," Dallmar said after the game,
"but our size was too much for
them."

Dallmar admitted that not
much can be learned from a game
like this one, but said "We've got
to work more to get the
percentage shots."
It was, all in all, a game easily
forgotten.
Houston Game
Tonight, the Cards play
Houston, and Dallmar is not
unconcerned. The Cougars are
"completely different" from Air
Force, he said.
Houston is tall.

Led by 6-9 Louis Dunbar, the
Cougars own a formidable
offense, averaging 88.4 points per
game. They are 7-8 overall, but

that record is misleading. Five of
their first six games were against
teams like Louisville, North
Carolina and Alabama. And
they've played USC twice, losing
at home by only one point.
Saturday they defeated
Nevada-Reno.
The Cougars have two
nationally ranked scorers. Dunbar
is ranked 15th with a 24.6 point
average, and 6-4 guard Otis
Birdsong ranks 13th nationally
with a 25.1 point average. The
other starters are David Marrs
(6-8), Maurice Presley (6-10), and
Tony Smith (6-2).
"Houston is an explosive
team," Dallmar said, "and we
hope that we can play our game.
They're a team that waits for you
to make a mistake."
