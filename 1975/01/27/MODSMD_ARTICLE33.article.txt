# Mile Relay Team Almost Downs Brown

### CHRIS BAKER 
DALY CITY - Few of the 12,598 track
enthusiasts who packed the Cow Palace for
Friday's 12th annual San Francisco
Examiner Indoor Games came to see Payton
Jordan's Stanford contingent, but many
came away excited about tracksters Jordan
has lured to the Farm.
Jordan has the same problem that he's
faced for the last few seasons lack of
depth. But after completing his most
successful recruiting season in years, the
veteran track coach predicted that the Cards
would be "more exciting off the front line."
And exciting the Cards were, as the mile
relay team ran an inspired relay (3:25.4),
before succumbing to a Rick Brown led
California squad (3:24.4).
Brown, Cal's premier 880 man, was in the
relay spotlight as he competed in his final
relay event on the boards. Brown, who does
not usually run in the mile relay, was
lackadaisical before the meet.
When a Cal fan spotted him in the lobby
before the meet and asked him if he was
competing, Brown answered, "I am, but I
don't know why I'm running in the mile
relay."
Still, Brown is such a great track man that
his presence in the race psyched Stanford
out." Freshman James Lofton, last year's
state high school long jump champion, ran a
good quarter for the Cards as he pushed
Cal's Mike Grasha.
Lofton's handoff to Reggie Mason was
about as good as can be expected during the
indoor season.

But when Mason passed to Alan Sheets
there seemed to be some problem and Sheets
was forced to make up about 15 yards on
Brown. But Sheets, a member of last year's
state champion high school mile relay team,
caught Brown and ran stride for stride with
the Pac-8 880 champ.
The handoff to anchorman Scott Wingo
was a bit off and that was all Cal anchorman
James Robinson needed to gain a one-second
victory.
Sheets was brash after the race. "We're
going to take some shots this year. People
won't know us, but we're going to sneak up
on people." Sheets said he was incredulous
when he saw Brown. "When I saw that guy
out there, I said what's that guy that's four
years older than me doing out there."
Jordan said he was excited about the
potential of the mile relay team. "I'm
excited about what this team can do. Rick
Brown's not going to be out there in May
and he was the difference tonight."
Other Card entries did not fare as well as
the relay team. The biggest bright spot of
the night for Stanford was Lofton, who
came away with a 23-1 in the long jump. But
the mark was only good enough for fifth in a
star-studded field.
Pole vaulter Bob Flint no-heighted at
16-feet against Don Baird, who won with
16-7.
The most exciting Stanford victory of the
night came in the senior's 60-yard dash,
where the 57-year-old Jordan won his fourth
consecutive Examiner dash. Jordan beat
Prof. Alphonse Juilland of the Stanford
\ncients, who was clocked at 7.0.

efforts, the Golden Bears pulled off their
second consecutive Examiner Games mile
