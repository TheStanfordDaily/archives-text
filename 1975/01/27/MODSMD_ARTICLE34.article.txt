XO's Outscrum Ruggers
The Stanford ruggers lost their
first match of the season
Saturday, losing to the San
Francisco XO's 17-6 on Harry
Maloney Field.
The XO's, whose favorite
scrum play was appropriately
called "black and blue," left' the
Card scrum feeling as though it
had been mugged. The XO's
dominated the first half scrums
and lineouts. And while the XO
scrum was forcing the
inexperienced Cards into mistake
after mistake, the XO backfield,
one of the Bay Area's most
experienced, scored two
unconverted first half tries to take
a 8-0 halftime lead.
Card coach Pete Kmetovic had
to reintroduce his Cards to the
ball at halftime and did a good job
of it. Stanford came out
controlling the tempo early in the
second half. Given the ball for the
first time all afternoon, the
Cardinal backfield displayed the

same kind of offensive pillage that
had scored over 30 points against
two relatively weak opponents in
the previous two contests.
Captain Lawrie Lieberman got
the Cards back into the contest, as
lie scored an unassisted 35-yard
try and converted it himself to
close the gap to 8-6.
But that was as close as
Stanford would come. The XO's
five years of rugby experience per
man prevailed, as their "black and
blue" scrum dominated the ball
for the rest of the contest. XO

prop Mike Ording, whose balding
head made him a target for the
jeers of the rugger huggers,
showed why he's played on three
U.S. International rugby teams,
scoring two tries and adding both
conversions.
After the contest Ording said
he was surprised by the Cards.
"Stanford has a young rugby team
and it will be a good one, but
their scrum has to learn to be a bit
more aggressive. I think they'll be
ready for the Monterey Tourney
with a few more games like

today."
All the Cards agreed that the
XO scrum was the difference in
the contest. "We just got
outscrummed," said center Marty
O'Donahue.
Added Lieberman, "The scrum
we faced out there was probably
the best in the state. That Ording
was just fantastic."
