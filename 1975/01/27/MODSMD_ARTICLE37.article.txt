# Pac-8 Roundup
## Another Great Lee 
### 
Everybody's heard the legend
of Ronnie Lee by now.
You know, he's the hero of
Eugene, the toast of Oregon, the
man who has led the Duck
basketball team to the number
eight spot in the national polls.
Lee's the guy who decides tight
contests with phenomenal steals
in the waning seconds or nifty
jumpers at the buzzer.
Well, forget him. There's a new
legend up north. His name is Lee,
too, but he would probably be
run out of town on a rusty back
board if he dared set foot in
Eugene.
This Lee's name is Rickey. Up
till now, he's pursued his "trade"
in relative obscurity on the bench
of cross-state, cross-interstates
rival Oregon State.
Obscurity, that is, until
Saturday, when he not-so-calmly
dropped in a 30-footer at the end
of the first overtime period to give
the Beavers a dramatic 72-71 win
over Oregon and that other Lee.
In fact, until Rickey's dramatic
shot, neither Lee had been a big
factor in the game. Ronnie was
shut off by a tight Oregon zone
while Rickey was hardly out of
his sweats.
The Beavers, who took over
the Pacific Eight lead with the
win, were paced by the balanced
scoring of Don Smith, George
Tuck and Doug Oxsen. They
accounted for 40 points between
them.

Forward Greg Ballard topped
the Oregon scoring charts with 24
points, while Ernie Kent threw in
21.
Stanford had just a little luster
knocked off its victory over
second-ranked UCLA when the
Bruins dropped an 84-78 decision
to Notre Dame in South Bend.
The lead see-sawed throughout
the game before a Billy Paterno
field goal at 6:38 gave the Irish a
74-73 lead they held the rest of
the way. Richard Washington led
the losers with 24 points.
In other action, California, led
by Rickie Hawthorne's 24 points,
overcame a career-high 38-point
performance by Cal State-Los
Angeles center Tommie Lipsey
and beat the Diablos 82-77.
