# JV Cagers Romp To Pair Of Wins
## 
### MIKE TOLLIN 
Things were back to normal
this weekend for Stanford's JV
basketball team.
After splitting two
heart-pounders last weekend
before thousands of keyed-up
Cardinal rooters, the junior Cards
coasted to easy victories Friday
and Saturday night to run their
season record to 4-3. And as is the
norm, most of the fans came
disguised as empty seats.
Friday night, Cal
State-Sacramento ran into
less-than-hospitable treatment.
Before the game was nine minutes
old, the Cardinals,' employing a
tenacious full-court press and
shooting at a blistering pace, had
amassed a 23-4 lead, and the
stunned Hornets must have been

wondering if this was the same
Stanford team that knocked off
UCLA.
JV coach Percy Carr got a
chance to show off his bench and
breathe easily for a change. The
85-71 final score was one of
mercy in a game that seemed out
of doubt midway through the
warmups.
The following evening, while
Carr scouted Cal for Howie
Dallmar, assistant coach Ken
Morgan led his troops into battle
at UC-Davis, where a tremendous
throng of "maybe 50, maybe
100," looked on.
Again the Cards jumped out to
an early lead and were never
headed. Things got a bit sticky in
the second half as Davis pulled to
within one point, but Stanford
eventually asserted its superior
talent, and walked away with an
88-77 triumph.
Morgan considers his squad an
"extremely well-balanced club,"
so he substituted freely, allowing
all 16 players to see some action.
But three players in particular
shone this weekend. 6-1 Terry
McCartin displayed some smooth
ballhandling and slick shooting,
and pumped in 33 points in the
two games. And tall freshmen
Dick Dohrmann and Mark Fitzner
tallied ,38 and 26 points
respectively, while rebounding
well.
According to Morgan, the
weekend's greatest excitement
came Saturday night during what
is called "garbage time." When
Cardinal sub Rodney Buie
rammed in a buzzer-beating layup,
the Stanford bench erupted.
