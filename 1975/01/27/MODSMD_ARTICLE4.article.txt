# Foreign Language Placement Tests
## Panel To Advise No Exam Credit 
### STEVE HEFTER 
The Ad Hoc Panel on Advanced
Placement will recommend in a report
to the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (CAAA)
Wednesday that foreign language
departments discontinue granting units
to students who complete
departmental examinations.
The panel, established by the
CAAA, has been studying the present
method of granting advanced
placement (AP) and credit towards
graduation.
The system grants advanced
placement credit to students who
score a four or five on the College
Entrance Examination Board's (CEEB)
AP test or who satisfactorily perform
on examinations given by individual
departments.
In its recommendation, the Ad Hoc
Panel will not suggest any changes
towards credit or placement obtained
by students taking the CEEB AP test.
In most departments both credit
and advanced placement are attainable

through AP tests, but foreign language
departments also grant credit for
performance on departmental exams.
According to Mathematics Prof.
Mary Sunseri, chairperson of the Ad
Hoc Panel, the panel will recommend
that foreign language departments be
allowed to grant placement but not
credit for their examinations.
"There have been two kinds of
advanced placement up to now, and
we will recommend that the change be
made so that it would be a little more
consistent," Sunseri said.
"Up to now there has been a policy
and it has been in effect but I'm not
sure that anyone really knows what it
is. We should aim to clarify it and then
to recommend the one change."
In a proposal sent to the various
language departments, panel members
outlined their tentative views and
asked for comments before their final,
yet unreleased, decision was
determined.
The proposal stated, "Stanford
should award credit towards

graduation only when a student's
formal instruction has been at the
college level. By 'college level' we
mean a curriculum structure
comparable in pace and intensity to
that offered in a college and university
setting."
The panel, composed of two
students, five faculty members and
two ex-officio administrators,
emphasized that "advanced placement
programs of the CEEB fall within our
criterion. But it seems to us at this
time that an ordinary high school
instructional program does not."
In the proposal, the panel explained
that the authority to award credit
based on department examination
derived from a general studies
committee action taken in 1955.
The proposal concluded that
"Stanford credit towards graduation
should be awarded only for college
level work and not simply for
achievement based on examination of
learning acquired in formal high school
level work."
In response to the proposal, Slavic
Department Chairman, Prof. Joseph
VanCampen, wrote, "I feel that the Ad
Hoc Panel is mistaken in its suggestion
that we should not award credit for
performance on language exams.
"I feel that if our first year Russian
courses are considered college-level
work for students who take them, we
should also give due recognition to the
achievement of students who have
accumulated equivalent knowledge of
the Russian language in their high
school years."
At a meeting Jan. 17, language
department representatives were
invited to express their views before
the panel. Japanese Prof. Susan
Matisoff expressed concern that there
are no AP exams for East Asian
languages.
However, when informed of the
panel's expected recommendation,
Matisoff replied, "It is fair because
other departments, like physics, give
placement and not credit towards
graduation."
French Department chairman, Prof.
Alphonse Juilland, replied, "We are in
favor of continuing giving 10 units of
credit for work done in high school.
We believe that continuing giving
credit will strengthen language
departments in high school."
