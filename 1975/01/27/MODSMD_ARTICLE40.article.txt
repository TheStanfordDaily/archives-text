Panel May Subpoena Nixon
WASHINGTON The congressional Select
Committee on Intelligence Operations will subpoena
former President Nixon, if necessary, to get
information about spy activities, Sen. Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) said yesterday.
The committee also plans to dig through the
archives of the late President Johnson and the files
of the Johnson library to look into the "general
relationship of the intelligence community with the
White House," Baker said. Baker is a member of the
panel.
Baker, questioned on ABC's Issues and Answers,
said that if Nixon has information about the
intelligence operations of the United States
government, "I hope he'll come forth voluntarily."
He stressed that he would be hesitant and
reluctant to subpoena "Nixon, who has fallen so
far."
One of the questions the committee will try to
answer, Baker said, is whether the CIA operated
without Nixon's knowledge in some fields.
"We will not only inquire of the only living
ex-president whether he had control of it, but will
search the files of the Johnson library," he said.
"I very much fear that no one was at the rudder
of the ship," he added.

Charges that the FBI conducted improper
surveillance of political figures, possibly of Sen.
Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), during the 1964
campaign in which he ran against Johnson, "are a
good reason to go into the Johnson archives," Baker
said.
Rocky Expects Full CIA Probe
NEW YORK - Vice President Nelson A.
Rockefeller said yesterday the investigation of
domestic spying by the CIA is going to be pursued
"wherever the facts lead us."
"We'll go as far as any action leads us, to a
Republican president, to a Democratic president or
anybody else," he told reporters as he left a CBS
studio where he appeared on his first network
television interview show since becoming vice
president.
"We are there to get the facts, to get them out,
to get them to the public and to get the reasons for
whatever happened and then to make
recommendations," he added.
"And we'll put the whole report out. We'll make
a report to the President and well release it to the
public."
Rockefeller was friendly and jovial with reporters
who buttonholed him in the studio lobby.
But on the show Face the Nation he became
angered when a reporter asked if he would "finger"
anyone since "you had some sort of a connection
with the CIA yourself and so did Secretary of State
Kissinger who you gave a $50,000 gift to."
Henry Kissinger, as head of the National Security
Council, has close dealings with the CIA and
Rockefeller was a member of the Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board which oversees it.
Kissinger was a Rockefeller aide in the 19605.
The vice president, visibly angry, snapped "In
your question, you question my integrity. If you'll
excuse me for saying so, I took an oath of office.
When I take an oath, I carry out that oath. There is
no conflict as far as I am concerned."
Battle Rages In South Vietnam
SAIGON, South Vietnam Government forces
backed by armored units clashed near the
Cambodian frontier with North Vietnamese troops
today, the second anniversary of the signing of the
cease-fire agreement.
The Saigon command announced that 41 North
Vietnamese were killed and government losses were
six dead and 29 wounded.
Two South Vietnamese A37 bombers supporting
the infantrymen were shot down by Soviet-made
antiaircraft missiles, a command spokesman said,
with one pilot killed and the other rescued.
The action was part of a counteroffensive
launched by the government nine days ago with a
2000-man task force west of Saigon to block a
North Vietnamese division threatening Kien Tuong
Province.
It was reported in Saigon that South Vietnamese
forces have suffered nearly 160,000 casualties since
the cease-fire was signed in Paris.
In Cambodia, the second convoy in three days
reached the virtually besieged capital of Phnom

Penh after running the 60-mile Mekong River
shipping channel from South Vietnam.
One fuel tanker and three ammunition barges
made it safely to Phnom Penh, port sources said.
They said another tanker caught fire and had to put
in at Neak Luong navy base, 32 miles southeast of
Phnom Penh.
Another convoy .was expected to attempt the run
in a few days.
The Saigon command issued a communique
listing 28,705 South Vietnamese soldiers killed,
115,141 wounded and 16,011 missing in the two
years since the Paris peace accord was signed.
The communique said the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong had sustained equally heavy losses and
claimed the Communist side lost 111,729 men
killed during the same period.
Western analysts said there is no way to
substantiate such a claim, which they say was
probably inflated. The Communist command has
never disclosed its losses.
Jackson Blasts Ford Economics
LOS ANGELES Sen. Henry M. Jackson
yesterday questioned the White House's ability to
tackle the nation's energy aAd economic woes,
saying, "There have been expressed sympathies for
stockbrokers, oil companies and higher-income
people."
The 62-year-old Washington State Democrat,
expected to announce early next month that he will
run for President in 1976, made his criticisms in a
prepared speech at a $250-a-plate fundraiser in his
honor at the Century Plaza Hotel.
"Based on its performance over the past two
years, the White House doesn't enter the energy and
economic contest with much of a winning record,"
he said.
Jackson, a leading Democratic spokesman on
energy issues, also issued a blast at President Ford's
tax rebate proposal, saying, "So when we talk about
tax rebates and the figures show the $50,000-a-year
man getting $lOOO and the $5OOO-a-year man
getting $l2, there is a plan that begs for
amendment.

development."
Preparations will begin immediately for the
first-ever summit meeting of OPEC heads of state to
define the oil-producing countries' position in

run for President in 1976, made his criticisms in a
prepared speech at a $250-a-plate fundraiser in his
honor at the Century Plaza Hotel.
"Based on its performance over the past two
years, the White House doesn't enter the energy and
economic contest with much of a winning record,"
he said.
Jackson, a leading Democratic spokesman on
energy issues, also issued a blast at President Ford's
tax rebate proposal, saying, "So when we talk about
tax rebates and the figures show the $50,000-a-year
man getting $lOOO and the $5OOO-a-year man
getting $l2, there is a plan that begs for

OPEC Agrees To Meeting
ALGIERS, Algeria The world's major oil
exporting countries formally agreed yesterday to
meet with oil importing nations in an effort to
resolve their problems.
A communique issued in Algiers at the end of a
three-day ministerial conference of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) declared
support for an international conference "which will
deal with the problems of raw materials and
development."
Preparations will begin immediately for the
first-ever summit meeting of OPEC heads of state to
define the oil-producing countries' position in
discussions with the oil importers, the communique
said. The summit was scheduled to take place in
Algiers between Feb. 21 and March 8.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Low temperatures both
nights in the 30s to low 40s. High today and
tomorrow in the 50s. Small craft advisory for

Panel May Subpoena Nixon
WASHINGTON The congressional Select
Committee on Intelligence Operations will subpoena
former President Nixon, if necessary, to get
information about spy activities, Sen. Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) said yesterday.
The committee also plans to dig through the
archives of the late President Johnson and the files
of the Johnson library to look into the "general
relationship of the intelligence community with the
White House," Baker said. Baker is a member of the
panel.
Baker, questioned on ABC's Issues and Answers,
said that if Nixon has information about the
intelligence operations of the United States
government, "I hope he'll come forth voluntarily."
He stressed that he would be hesitant and
reluctant to subpoena "Nixon, who has fallen so
far."
One of the questions the committee will try to
answer, Baker said, is whether the CIA operated
without Nixon's knowledge in some fields.
"We will not only inquire of the only living
ex-president whether he had control of it, but will
search the files of the Johnson library," he said.
"I very much fear that no one was at the rudder
of the ship," he added.

Charges that the FBI conducted improper
surveillance of political figures, possibly of Sen.
Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), during the 1964
campaign in which he ran against Johnson, "are a
good reason to go into the Johnson archives," Baker
said.
Rocky Expects Full CIA Probe
NEW YORK - Vice President Nelson A.
Rockefeller said yesterday the investigation of
domestic spying by the CIA is going to be pursued
"wherever the facts lead us."
"We'll go as far as any action leads us, to a
Republican president, to a Democratic president or
anybody else," he told reporters as he left a CBS
studio where he appeared on his first network
television interview show since becoming vice
president.
"We are there to get the facts, to get them out,
to get them to the public and to get the reasons for
whatever happened and then to make
recommendations," he added.
"And we'll put the whole report out. We'll make
a report to the President and well release it to the
public."
Rockefeller was friendly and jovial with reporters
who buttonholed him in the studio lobby.
But on the show Face the Nation he became
angered when a reporter asked if he would "finger"
anyone since "you had some sort of a connection
with the CIA yourself and so did Secretary of State
Kissinger who you gave a $50,000 gift to."
Henry Kissinger, as head of the National Security
Council, has close dealings with the CIA and
Rockefeller was a member of the Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board which oversees it.
Kissinger was a Rockefeller aide in the 19605.
The vice president, visibly angry, snapped "In
your question, you question my integrity. If you'll
excuse me for saying so, I took an oath of office.
When I take an oath, I carry out that oath. There is
no conflict as far as I am concerned."
Battle Rages In South Vietnam
SAIGON, South Vietnam Government forces
backed by armored units clashed near the
Cambodian frontier with North Vietnamese troops
today, the second anniversary of the signing of the
cease-fire agreement.
The Saigon command announced that 41 North
Vietnamese were killed and government losses were
six dead and 29 wounded.
Two South Vietnamese A37 bombers supporting
the infantrymen were shot down by Soviet-made
antiaircraft missiles, a command spokesman said,
with one pilot killed and the other rescued.
The action was part of a counteroffensive
launched by the government nine days ago with a
2000-man task force west of Saigon to block a
North Vietnamese division threatening Kien Tuong
Province.
It was reported in Saigon that South Vietnamese
forces have suffered nearly 160,000 casualties since
the cease-fire was signed in Paris.
In Cambodia, the second convoy in three days
reached the virtually besieged capital of Phnom

Penh after running the 60-mile Mekong River
shipping channel from South Vietnam.
One fuel tanker and three ammunition barges
made it safely to Phnom Penh, port sources said.
They said another tanker caught fire and had to put
in at Neak Luong navy base, 32 miles southeast of
Phnom Penh.
Another convoy .was expected to attempt the run
in a few days.
The Saigon command issued a communique
listing 28,705 South Vietnamese soldiers killed,
115,141 wounded and 16,011 missing in the two
years since the Paris peace accord was signed.
The communique said the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong had sustained equally heavy losses and
claimed the Communist side lost 111,729 men
killed during the same period.
Western analysts said there is no way to
substantiate such a claim, which they say was
probably inflated. The Communist command has
never disclosed its losses.

2000-man task force west of Saigon to block a
North Vietnamese division threatening Kien Tuong
Province.
It was reported in Saigon that South Vietnamese
forces have suffered nearly 160,000 casualties since
the cease-fire was signed in Paris.
In Cambodia, the second convoy in three days
reached the virtually besieged capital of Phnom

Penh after running the 60-mile Mekong River
shipping channel from South Vietnam.
One fuel tanker and three ammunition barges
made it safely to Phnom Penh, port sources said.
They said another tanker caught fire and had to put
in at Neak Luong navy base, 32 miles southeast of
Phnom Penh.
Another convoy .was expected to attempt the run
in a few days.
The Saigon command issued a communique
listing 28,705 South Vietnamese soldiers killed,
115,141 wounded and 16,011 missing in the two
years since the Paris peace accord was signed.
The communique said the North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong had sustained equally heavy losses and
claimed the Communist side lost 111,729 men
killed during the same period.
Western analysts said there is no way to
substantiate such a claim, which they say was
probably inflated. The Communist command has
never disclosed its losses.
Jackson Blasts Ford Economics
LOS ANGELES Sen. Henry M. Jackson
yesterday questioned the White House's ability to
tackle the nation's energy aAd economic woes,
saying, "There have been expressed sympathies for
stockbrokers, oil companies and higher-income
people."
The 62-year-old Washington State Democrat,
expected to announce early next month that he will
run for President in 1976, made his criticisms in a
prepared speech at a $250-a-plate fundraiser in his
honor at the Century Plaza Hotel.
"Based on its performance over the past two
years, the White House doesn't enter the energy and
economic contest with much of a winning record,"
he said.
Jackson, a leading Democratic spokesman on
energy issues, also issued a blast at President Ford's
tax rebate proposal, saying, "So when we talk about
tax rebates and the figures show the $50,000-a-year
man getting $lOOO and the $5OOO-a-year man
getting $l2, there is a plan that begs for
amendment.
OPEC Agrees To Meeting
ALGIERS, Algeria The world's major oil
exporting countries formally agreed yesterday to
meet with oil importing nations in an effort to
resolve their problems.
A communique issued in Algiers at the end of a
three-day ministerial conference of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) declared
support for an international conference "which will
deal with the problems of raw materials and
development."
Preparations will begin immediately for the
first-ever summit meeting of OPEC heads of state to
define the oil-producing countries' position in
discussions with the oil importers, the communique
said. The summit was scheduled to take place in
Algiers between Feb. 21 and March 8.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Low temperatures both
nights in the 30s to low 40s. High today and
tomorrow in the 50s. Small craft advisory for

Panel May Subpoena Nixon
WASHINGTON The congressional Select
Committee on Intelligence Operations will subpoena
former President Nixon, if necessary, to get
information about spy activities, Sen. Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) said yesterday.
The committee also plans to dig through the
archives of the late President Johnson and the files
of the Johnson library to look into the "general
relationship of the intelligence community with the
White House," Baker said. Baker is a member of the
panel.
Baker, questioned on ABC's Issues and Answers,
said that if Nixon has information about the
intelligence operations of the United States
government, "I hope he'll come forth voluntarily."
He stressed that he would be hesitant and
reluctant to subpoena "Nixon, who has fallen so
far."
One of the questions the committee will try to
answer, Baker said, is whether the CIA operated
without Nixon's knowledge in some fields.
"We will not only inquire of the only living
ex-president whether he had control of it, but will
search the files of the Johnson library," he said.
"I very much fear that no one was at the rudder
of the ship," he added.

Charges that the FBI conducted improper
surveillance of political figures, possibly of Sen.
Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.), during the 1964
campaign in which he ran against Johnson, "are a
good reason to go into the Johnson archives," Baker
said.
Rocky Expects Full CIA Probe
NEW YORK - Vice President Nelson A.
Rockefeller said yesterday the investigation of
domestic spying by the CIA is going to be pursued
"wherever the facts lead us."
"We'll go as far as any action leads us, to a
Republican president, to a Democratic president or
anybody else," he told reporters as he left a CBS
studio where he appeared on his first network
television interview show since becoming vice
president.
"We are there to get the facts, to get them out,
to get them to the public and to get the reasons for
whatever happened and then to make
recommendations," he added.
"And we'll put the whole report out. We'll make
a report to the President and well release it to the
public."
Rockefeller was friendly and jovial with reporters
who buttonholed him in the studio lobby.
But on the show Face the Nation he became
angered when a reporter asked if he would "finger"
anyone since "you had some sort of a connection
with the CIA yourself and so did Secretary of State
Kissinger who you gave a $50,000 gift to."
Henry Kissinger, as head of the National Security
Council, has close dealings with the CIA and
Rockefeller was a member of the Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board which oversees it.
Kissinger was a Rockefeller aide in the 19605.
The vice president, visibly angry, snapped "In
your question, you question my integrity. If you'll
excuse me for saying so, I took an oath of office.
When I take an oath, I carry out that oath. There is
no conflict as far as I am concerned."
Battle Rages In South Vietnam
SAIGON, South Vietnam Government forces
backed by armored units clashed near the
Cambodian frontier with North Vietnamese troops
today, the second anniversary of the signing of the
cease-fire agreement.
The Saigon command announced that 41 North
Vietnamese were killed and government losses were
six dead and 29 wounded.
Two South Vietnamese A37 bombers supporting
the infantrymen were shot down by Soviet-made
antiaircraft missiles, a command spokesman said,
with one pilot killed and the other rescued.
