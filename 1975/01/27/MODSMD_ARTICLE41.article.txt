Spencer Foundation Grants
The Spencer Foundation has provided Stanford
with funds to support research of young scholars
working on problems relating to education.
Grants for 1975-1976 can be made in amounts
up to approximately $5OOO for a one-year period,
and can be available as early as spring quarter 1975.
Salary support for the principal investigators should
