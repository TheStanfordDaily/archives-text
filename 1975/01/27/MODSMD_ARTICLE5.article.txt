### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The ASSU Lecture Notes Service
has sold $6936 in student
subscriptions, service director Vic
Petroff disclosed Friday.
The service, which sells lecture
notes for 14 classes here, should
continue to sell subscriptions until
later this week, when the rate of sales
is expected to drop off completely,
Petroff said.
The revenue, already $lOOO more
than that projected, will pay operating
costs (Approximately $6000) incurred
this quarter and last quarter, said
Petroff, a sophomore majoring in
economics. The rest of the money will
go towards paying a $2300 debt for an
electronic stencilmaker, mimeograph
machine and electric typewriter.
Student reaction to the service
generally has been favorable.
'Another Textbook'
"It's as if I had another textbook,"
said Tom Perry, a junior majoring in
psychology. "With the notes already
taken, I don't have to worry so much
about writing down all the facts and
figures in class. It gives rrie more time
to think in class, and helps me to
generalize ideas in my own head."

Susan Sandrez, a non-matriculated
graduate student, agreed, adding the
notes are "more thorough than my
own."
Sandrez, who subscribes to the
service for Physics 23, said, "I still
take my own notes, because it helps
me grasp the material."
Several other students, including
sophomore Gary Crooks, also said
they still take notes in class to help
them learn the material.
'Different Perspective'
Crooks maintained that the
service's notes aren't much better than
his own, but he added that the
service's notes "sometimes give a
different perspective to the lectures."
The service's notes are "a
well-mapped out supplement," said
Daniel Dale, a freshman who
subscribes to the service for Physics
51. "While the professor [H. Alan
Schwettman] does an excellent job of
lecturing, sometimes he can't get
everything in during class. The notes
provide the examples he doesn't get
to."
Roger West, a freshman majoring in
mechanical engineering, said the notes
"take a lot of the tension out of the

classroom." West subscribes to the
service for Chemistry 33.
Not all students had favorable
comments, however. Joan Seet, a
sophomore majoring in human
biology, said, "Some of the things I
find important are missing from the
[service's] notes."
Notes Late
Seet, who subscribes to the service
for Human Biology 3A and 38, also
complained that "you § et the notes a
week after the lecture. If I had it to do
again, I don't think I would get a
subscription."
Other students complained that
hand-written notes for some classes
were difficult to read.
Petroff explained that some of the
service's notetakers write out their
notes by hand because the notes
included many diagrams.
He maintained that only one class
had notes which were below an
acceptable level of readability. Petroff
said the notes for that class would
start improving because he had
discussed the problem with the
notetaker.
