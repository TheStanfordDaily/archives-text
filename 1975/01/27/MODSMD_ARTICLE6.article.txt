# Irish Tenure Issue Stirs Controversy

### RICHARD FEARON 
The University's decision that Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish rot be granted tenure
hais become a very controversial issue.
Irish, recipient of the 1972 Albert A. Gores
Awards for Excellence in Teaching, was denied
tenure two weeks ago by the Advancement and
Placement Committee (A&P Committee) on the
grounds that his publications showed lack of
scholarship and insufficient academic promise.
Full endorsement had been given him by his
department, as well as by outside referees called
in to assess Irish's scholarship.
"I think that I am qualified to teach here and
I feel that I represent the University well outside
of it," stated Irish, referring to the decision.
"They granted that I was a very superior
teacher," he continued. "The Department and
people outside of the University in my field said
that my publications gave evidence of very good
scholarship..
"One puzzle in my mind is how people on
the A&P Committee, outside my field, could
take such a contrary judgment. .
Large Problem
Irish feels that this decision is symptomatic
of a large problem here.
"If you step back from everything, I think
that you'll hear a little bit about the real
importance of teaching. The University's highest

priority is in maintaining a high reputation," he
indicated.
While recognizing the importance of writing
in its own right, Irish explained that when he
had to choose priorities, he put his primary
emphasis on teaching.
"If I went into this without any evidence of
scholarship, however, I would find it difficult to
argue against them, but this really is not the
case," he said. "The publications are found, at
least by people in my own field, as solid
evidence of scholarship. I have enough so that
other people think they are adequate . .."
Publications
In the last year-and-a-half, Irish has had two
articles in professional journals in his field, as
well as having written a chapter for a
forthcoming philosophy volume. Irish's first
book, A Boy Thirteen, is scheduled for
publication next March.
Asked about the Irish case, History Prof.
Lewis Spitz, associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, declined comment, although he was
willing to discuss the general tenure criteria and
the process involved.
"The A&P Committee reads all the dossiers
and the students' report on his [a professor's]
teaching.... They also read what he has
written," Spitz explained.
Three criteria are considered in the tenure

process, be noted.
"The first is simply teaching. The
the man's scholarship and future position in his
profession.... Lastly, it is his depth of
University service," said Spitz.
However, he admitted that the third criterion
was one not given much weight in comparison
with the other two. "I personally feel that it is a
mistake for younger professors to feel that they
should be rewarded for serving on umpteen
University committees. Those guys have to resist
the temptation to play big man on campus until
they really are established.
'Even Balance'
"What I have seen of the Committee's
decisions in the past year-and-a-half is very even
balance between emphasis on teaching and
research," Spitz noted. "I would say that the
Committee really has a fine balance between
those two . . .
"Many of the best teachers often are the best
people in their fields. We want to promote those
who can do both very well ..."
Spitz did concede that, "If a guy is just a
super teacher or a super researcher, you might
make some allowance. Compensations are made
on one side of that scale only in the case" of
exceptional people, though.
As a final caveat, Spitz added, "If a student
