Many of those who have
written to the Daily and joined in
the discussion of proposed
changes in SWOPSI, SCIRE,
Urban Studies and the
Undergraduate Writing Program
(UWP) apparently have not
recognized that dropping a
program is not synonymous with
removing its functions from the
University.
Because these programs already
have relatively small instructional
budgets. and because their
activities and functions would
continue elsewhere, the savings to
the University in teaching costs
will be minimal. If these changes
are ultimately approved, the
principal savings would come in
administrative costs.
Where would the functions
continue then? As indicated to
the. Daily last week, SCIRE task
force activities would be
coordinated through the
allocation of half-time in an
existing position on the
undergraduate studies central
staff. This position will become
vacant in a few months through
normal attrition, at which time it
would be filled by Alice Supton,
who would combine her
responsibilities for the task forces
with other responsibilities.
Functions presently performed
by the UWP would be absorbed
by the Department of English,
which already is setting up
arrangements to do this.
Urban Studies instruction
would continue, primarily with
the faculty presently involved
under the auspices of their
departments. A full year's
transition has been recommended,
so the dean and departments
involved can work out ways in
which urban studies and other
departmental offerings could best
be coordinated. Departments
could continue to involve
para-faculty where appropriate.
New Acronym Coined
SWOPSI-like workshops, with
an applied, action-oriented focus,
could be done in the regular
academic departments and/or
under a redefined Undergraduate
Special Agency (UNGRASPEL,
for those who like acronyms).
SWOPSI'S Policy Board and
other supporters are dubious abut
the willingness of regular
academic departments to offer
this kind of workshop. But the
University's circumstances have
changed markedly in the last few
months.
The department's willingness
to respond to this change, in ways
that meet widespread
undergraduate concerns, should
not be completely discounted in
advance.
UNGRASPEL would be
charged explicitly with
educational experimentation.
Operated as part of the dean's
office, it would fund and support

pilot programs for limited periods
of time, specified in advance.
Such programs might include
SCIRE-like ones or SWOPSI-like
ones. But, most important, it
would be able to support
experiments devised by future
generations of students. The
"Stanford-in-Stanford" proposal
has shown very clearly that
student initiatives in education do
not necessarily follow SWOPSI,
SCIRE, or other previous
administrative formats-
Fewer Workshops
Even -though SWOPSI would
end as a separate program,
SWOPSI-like functions could
continue in this identifiable,
extra-departmental locus. The
only limitation would be
administrative costs the existing
level of Undergraduate Special
staffing which would support a
reshaped UNGRASPEL.
Undoubtedly this would mean
fewer workshops than are offered
now.
If the undergraduate dean's
office is locked into maintaining
everything it is now doing, future
generations of students could find
themselves greatly and unduly
restricted in devising their own
experimental programs.
Finally, the fact that these
proposed cutbacks in the
undergraduate dean's office and
related activities were the first to
become public should not lead
the campus community to
conclude that undergraduate
education itself is under sudden,
sustained attack. Nor should the
fact that there will be continuing
discussion of how this office can
best be structured lead to
premature, Cassandra-like
conclusions.
Premature Gloom
It is ironic that willingness to
comply with student interests in
learning about proposed
reductions should set in motion a
"Chicken Little" syndrome where
the world is already assumed to
have disintegrated.
As the belt-tightening measures
taken by other deans and
non-academic departments are
disclosed, it will become
abundantly clear that
undergraduate education is not
alone in its need to cut costs.. The
coverage of the Medical School
and financial aid proposals (Daily,
Jan. 22) helps make this clear.
What all of us need to do is use
the time we still have to examine
proposed changes as carefully as
possible, so that a slimmer
Stanford will still offer high
quality education two, three and
10 yeai£ hence including ways
in which future students can
fashion educational innovation
with faculty and administrative
support.

in which future students can
fashion educational innovation
with faculty and administrative
support.
(James Gibbs is the dean of
Undergraduate Studies.)
Many of those who have
written to the Daily and joined in
the discussion of proposed
changes in SWOPSI, SCIRE,
Urban Studies and the
Undergraduate Writing Program
(UWP) apparently have not
recognized that dropping a
program is not synonymous with
removing its functions from the
University.
Because these programs already
have relatively small instructional
budgets. and because their
activities and functions would
continue elsewhere, the savings to
the University in teaching costs
will be minimal. If these changes
are ultimately approved, the
principal savings would come in
administrative costs.
Where would the functions
continue then? As indicated to
the. Daily last week, SCIRE task
force activities would be
coordinated through the
allocation of half-time in an
existing position on the
undergraduate studies central
staff. This position will become
vacant in a few months through
normal attrition, at which time it
would be filled by Alice Supton,
who would combine her
responsibilities for the task forces
with other responsibilities.
Functions presently performed
by the UWP would be absorbed
by the Department of English,
which already is setting up
arrangements to do this.
Urban Studies instruction
would continue, primarily with
the faculty presently involved
under the auspices of their
departments. A full year's
transition has been recommended,
so the dean and departments
involved can work out ways in
which urban studies and other
departmental offerings could best
be coordinated. Departments
could continue to involve
para-faculty where appropriate.
New Acronym Coined
SWOPSI-like workshops, with
an applied, action-oriented focus,
could be done in the regular
academic departments and/or
under a redefined Undergraduate
Special Agency (UNGRASPEL,
for those who like acronyms).
SWOPSI'S Policy Board and
other supporters are dubious abut
the willingness of regular
academic departments to offer
this kind of workshop. But the
University's circumstances have
changed markedly in the last few
months.
The department's willingness
to respond to this change, in ways
that meet widespread
undergraduate concerns, should
not be completely discounted in
advance.
UNGRASPEL would be
charged explicitly with
educational experimentation.
Operated as part of the dean's
office, it would fund and support

pilot programs for limited periods
of time, specified in advance.
Such programs might include
SCIRE-like ones or SWOPSI-like
ones. But, most important, it
would be able to support
experiments devised by future
generations of students. The
"Stanford-in-Stanford" proposal
has shown very clearly that
student initiatives in education do
not necessarily follow SWOPSI,
SCIRE, or other previous
administrative formats-
Fewer Workshops
Even -though SWOPSI would
end as a separate program,
SWOPSI-like functions could
continue in this identifiable,
extra-departmental locus. The
only limitation would be
administrative costs the existing
level of Undergraduate Special
staffing which would support a
reshaped UNGRASPEL.
Undoubtedly this would mean
fewer workshops than are offered
now.
If the undergraduate dean's
office is locked into maintaining
everything it is now doing, future
generations of students could find
themselves greatly and unduly
restricted in devising their own
experimental programs.
Finally, the fact that these
proposed cutbacks in the
undergraduate dean's office and
related activities were the first to
become public should not lead
the campus community to
conclude that undergraduate
education itself is under sudden,
sustained attack. Nor should the
fact that there will be continuing
discussion of how this office can
best be structured lead to
premature, Cassandra-like
conclusions.
Premature Gloom
It is ironic that willingness to
comply with student interests in
learning about proposed
reductions should set in motion a
"Chicken Little" syndrome where
the world is already assumed to
have disintegrated.
As the belt-tightening measures
taken by other deans and
non-academic departments are
disclosed, it will become
abundantly clear that
undergraduate education is not
alone in its need to cut costs.. The
coverage of the Medical School
and financial aid proposals (Daily,
Jan. 22) helps make this clear.
What all of us need to do is use
the time we still have to examine
proposed changes as carefully as
possible, so that a slimmer
Stanford will still offer high
quality education two, three and
10 yeai£ hence including ways
in which future students can
fashion educational innovation
with faculty and administrative
support.

proposed changes as carefully as
possible, so that a slimmer
Stanford will still offer high
quality education two, three and
10 yeai£ hence including ways
in which future students can
fashion educational innovation
with faculty and administrative
support.
(James Gibbs is the dean of
Undergraduate Studies.)
