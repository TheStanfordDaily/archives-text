"PARKING" USED TO BE SOMETHING YOU DID
FOR PLEASURE FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NITE
Nowadays, most people don't seem to think there is much pleasure in it at all.
I've been asked by the University administration to re-examine the
parking and transportation system and recommend changes. To do
this, I need input from everyone in the Stanford community.
Following is a list of public meetings to be held soon. At these
meetings, I want to hear from you concerning parking and
transportation at Stanford. All are welcome, but at each meeting
I especially hope to hear from the groups listed alongside the
dates and places.
