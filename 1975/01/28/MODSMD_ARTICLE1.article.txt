# ASSU Special Events Director Considered For University Post
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
The future of ASSU Special Events
Director Danny Scher has created a
controversy over possible University
incorporation of profitable ASSU
undertakings.
The University is considering
â™¦offering Scher a full-time position in
the Office of Public Events after he
graduates from business school here
this spring, Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Rosenzweig confirmed
yesterday. ASSU officials do not want
Scher to remain.
4 Public Events Director Thomas
Bacchetti said Scher would deal with
"popular programming" in the Public
Events office. The position could
incorporate most of the duties of the
ASSU Special Events such as
organizing concerts on campus.

"Danny has been the first director
of ASSU Special Events who has
managed to even break even, let alone
make a profit of the enterprise,"
Bacchetti praised.
ASSU Financial Manager Frank

Olivieri and ASSU President Mike
Herman fear the University would be
denying the ASSU a valuable source of
income if Scher receives the position.
Herman Complains
"First, the University cut our
budget; then it's considering sticking
us with Tresidder, which has
historically not been a successful
venture; and now it's planning to take
away one of our sources of income,"
Herman complained.
If the University had assumed
responsibility for rock concerts this
year, ASSU revenue would have been
cut by around $50,000, Herman
continued.
Olivieri said he was "vehemently
against" establishing a University post
for Scher because the action would set
a precedent.
"If they take over Special Events,
then we have to worry about the
University taking over the Travel
Service and the Sunday Flicks," he
elaborated.
Rosenzweig emphasized that it had

not been decided in what capacity
Scher would serve the University.
He added that Scher possibly could
work for the University full-time and
simultaneously serve as an adviser to
the ASSU.
Even if the ASSU still maintained
the Special Events department,Olivieri
said "our concerts are going to be
diluted if the University hires Danny."
'Retain Scher'
Bacchetti added that he would be
"just as happy" if the ASSU retained
Scher full-time, stating that some
University institution should benefit
from Scher's excellent record.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape mentioned that the ASSU had
lost an average of $12,000 under each
previous Special Events director.
Herman, however, objected to the
ASSU hiring Scher permanently.
'Learning Experience'
While complimenting Scher on
doing "an incredibly good job,"
Herman exclaimed, "I don't care if he
is the new Bill Graham of the Bay
Area. By principle, the director should
not be someone who has a permanent
position. It's a learning experience for
business school students."
Herman disagreed with any
assumption that Special Events would
fall back into the red when Scher
graduates. He said there was a good
possibility "of us getting a new Danny
Scher" as the next Special Events
director.
"The University has little faith in
what's coming up in the future,"
Olivieri declared.
Snape reasoned that the University

thinks Scher has "special talents,"
while the ASSU doesn't consider
"Danny Scher all that special."
Herman remarked that he was
completely willing to follow the
present system. However, Bacchetti
commented that "maintaining the
status quo would make everyone
lose."
Olivieri claimed that if Scher were
hired by the University, "the only
people that will profit from the new
position are Danny with a high salary
and the Public Events Office."
