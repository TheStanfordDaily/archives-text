# Conspiracies Are Easy To Weave
## 
### Stephen Carter 
In the wake of the recent campus
appearance by Rusty Rhodes and the
showing of the film Executive Action, talk of
conspiracies linking everything from the
Kennedy assassinations to Watergate has
grown popular around the University.
In this light, certain facts probably
unknown to the rest of the Stanford
community should be brought to light,
because they link a number of recent events.
First and, seemingly at the heart of all
the theories come the events of Nov. 22,
1963. Although no one considered it
important at the time, a certain man let us
call him Mr. X for the present could not
account strictly for his whereabouts that day,
yet is known to be one of the most
consistent opponents of the theory that a
common conspiracy links President
Kennedy's assassination and more recent
events.
Why does he fight so hard, if he has
nothing to hide?
Of course, Mr. X who claims to have
been in Washington, D.C., at a barbershop
that afternoon may be entirely innocent.
But the fact remains that he had never before
been unable to produce proof of his activities
for such a long time, although such proof was
often demanded. Moreover, it is well
documented that (perhaps due to some quirk
of personality), he had never before been
known to go to the barbershop alone.
An isolated, unimportant incident?
Perhaps but read on.
Move To The Center
In the late 19605, Mr. X moved to an
upper-middle class section of Washington, an
area inhabited by many prominent
politicians.

There, less than five years after John
Kennedy's assassination, he appeared in a
campaign film for Robert Kennedy. This
would not have been odd, except that Mr. X
had privately acknowledged his support of
Hubert Humphrey's presidential bid. Once in
the film, he proceeded to ask Kennedy an
embarassing question. When Kennedy
addressed the others, Mr. X could be seen
following him closely with his eyes. Less than
a month later, Robert Kennedy was dead.
In the same Washington neighborhood,
Mr. X befriended the children of then-Sen.
Charles Goodell (R-N.Y.), constantly plying
them for information about their father. His
family even accepted a gift a cat from
the Goodell's, a cat which the family retains
to this day.
Shortly thereafter, of course, the Nixon
administration began its assault on Goodell,
an assault which cost him the 1970 senatorial
election.
Mysterious Note
Mr. X was al&o seen at former President
Eisenhower's funeral. There Nelson
Rockefeller now, of course, vice president
to a man chosen by Richard Nixon
scribbled something on a piece of paper and
handed it to a still unidentified young girl.
The girl handed it to Mr. X, who nodded and
smiled approvingly.

Again, if this were all there was to Mr. X's
illustrious career, there would seem little
basis for the assumption that he had a hand
in it all but there is more.
For example, witnesses quoted Mr. X as
saying he wished "somebody would shoot"
George Wallace the day before the shooting
took place.
And during the eventful summer of 1974,

Mr. X was seen frequently around
Washington, many times in the company of
another man, who also was involved in some
odd coincidences.
This second man was at the Supreme Court
for the decision on the so-called White House
Tapes, he was seen several times at the White
House (a Time magazine photographer got a
picture of him there the day Nixon resigned),
he was frequently seen on Capitol Hill and at
the Judiciary Committee, where he was
observed speaking to A1 Jenner, the minority
counsel.
And this second man was not a journalist,
politician or law enforcement official. Of
course he, too, has derided the attempts to
demonstrate a conspiracy in any of these
matters.
Lurking Near White House
But perhaps most significantly, although
he apparently tried to blend into the crowd,
Mr. X was observed leaving the White House
grounds and later photographed in the area
the night the President resigned.
Since the President was seeing none but
his closest friends that day, this clearly
indicates a close association between the two.
Indeed, evidence may yet come up linking
Mr. X to the Watergate affair, although, so
far, he has successfully avoided public
exposure of his possible role.
A conspiracy, then? Maybe.
Draw what conclusions you will, but I will
never divulge his name, due to the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution, which
forbids self-incrimination.
