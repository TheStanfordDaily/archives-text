# Franklin's Protests Justifiable?
## 
### Lise Giraud 
With Bruce Franklin gone from
the regular readership of the
Daily, through the good offices of
the Stanford administration, and
with others having been sent or
nudged along the same route,
there are few of us left to take up
the cudgels in his defense.
"For the first two years after
his dismissal, Franklin ... sulked
in the Bay Area," says William
Ross (Daily, Jan. 22). He stayed
here, not because it was such a
good climate to sulk in nor
even, as Ross faintly intimates, to
sulk within spitting distance of
President Lyman, but because he
had a house here he had bought
when he was still a tenured
associate professor and had reason
to believe he had permanence of
location.
In any case, sulking was hardly
his chief occupation then. Rather,
looking for a job was his
occupation. So was going to
school he went to San Mateo
College and studied the nursery
trade to learn an alternate skill
with which to feed his family
after hundreds of letters to
teaching institutions proved
unsuccessful.
Franklin "initiated a (thus far)
unsuccessful law suit against the
University," says Ross. All law
suits are unsuccessful until
adjudicated. Besides, it isn't his
law suit. It is a suit filed on his
behalf by the American Civil
Liberties Union, which is
convinced enough that Stanford
abrogated Franklin's civil liberties,
to take the University to court
over it.
By the "new conspiracy
theories" Franklin keeps
"hatching," I don't suppose Ross
would mean anything like the
far-fetched theories he hatched
while here, such as Henry Cabot
Lodge's complicity in the
Vietnam War, the secret electronic
warfare research contracts, the
ClA's role in Chile, Stanford
trustees' (cf., Thomas Jones)
involvement in what later became
known as Watergate, surveillance
of war protesters by the CIA and
FBI and similar chimeras?

Surely he was "a distinct threat
to the political stability of the
University," as Ross observes. He
was bright, eloquent and

charismatic, and he convinced
many people that the University's
political stability depended heavily
on war contracts, affiliation with
the local electronic war industry,
undisturbed recruiting by the
military, Honeywell, etc., and tht
the distance from the Inner Quad
to the electronic battlefield in
Vietnam was not as great as they
had thought. For that he got
clobbered, but good.
Despite Ross' sanguine remarks
about open arms policy to radical

revolutionaries at other
universities, of course this just
may not be a banner time to be
looking for a job, even for a
Maoist-Leninist.
As for the "liberal university"
that Stanford is, I had occasion
last week to look into my own
personnel file, where I found a
notation describing me as "a
dissident element" that had to be
(and was) put under working
surveillance. I consider my own
polite, lawful, measured utterance

â€¢ tantamount in political impact to
; singing the kiddies to sleep. If I
i am described as a "dissident
t element" by the Director of
Libraries, the head of what
' administrators fondly call "the
t heart of a university," how
! "liberal" is this University?
t I really enjoy reading Ross in
L the Daily. I just hope I won't in
i the future have to have it sent me
r in, say, Connecticut or Timbuktu.
