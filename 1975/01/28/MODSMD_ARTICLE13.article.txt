# Scalping Is Not Unethical
## 
### Ronnie Beck 
On Tuesday, Jan. 21, the Daily published a letter
from Neal Kohatsu decrying scalping on legal and
ethical grounds. Since there are certainly laws in
California against scalping, the legal question is
relatively moot. Moral arguments, however, are
questionable.
Kohatsu argues that scalpers prevented "quite a
few people from seeing their dream" of watching
Stanford's basketball team defeat UCLA. A
knowledge of simple economics and a quick glance
at the sellout figures would indicate to Kohatsu
that as many people as could fit into Maples
Pavilion were able to "see their dream."
What Kohatsu suggests, though, is that scalpers
kept people from seeing the sold-out game. What
the scalpers outside Maples really did was
efficiently allocate the tickets to those persons for
whom the tickets have high utility, as expressed
through purchasing behavior.
It seems that Kohatsu misplaced his disgust.
Perhaps he should be angered at the fire inspectors
who set the capacity limits for Maples Pavilion, or
maybe the architects or possibly even the Daily's
sports department for building up interest in the
game. Kohatsu could direct his ire much more
convincingly at any number of people responsible
for creating a situation in which demand for tickets
at their printed price far outstripped the meager
supply.
Evidently, Kohatsu and others opposed to
scalping prefer the means of distributing tickets that
is in practice now, which is the first-come,
first-served method. Alchian and Allen, in the book
University Economics, described the inadequacies
of this system.
They present a scenario in which the ticket
distributor could, "insist that all the [ticket]
applicants run a race and give the tickets to the first
200 to arrive at the finish line. This sounds silly. If
you simply replace the words 'finish line' by 'box
office' it is now realistic, but is it less silly? The

only difference is that for tickets there is no
uniform starting time or place, so that some
wiseacres start out a lot earlier and camp right at the
finish line."
What is also left unmentioned by those who
favor the present distribution method is that it
discriminates against those who are unable for any
reason to get to the ticket office early enough to
purchase tickets. For some people there might even
be too prohibitive of an opportunity cost to leave a
job or studying in order to wait in line for tickets.
For the person who would miss out on what he
considers to be $lO worth of classes, studying,
work or lesisure, paying an extra couple of dollars
for someone else to do the work of waiting in line
seems to be rather reasonable.
In 1972, a citizen's committee in New York
studying allotment of theatre tickets came out with
the recommendation that, "a free market for the
sale and distribution of tickets, with the laws of
supply and demand dictating how high or low
prices may go" should be adopted.
The reason their recommendation was acted
upon neither in New York, nor in many other
states across the nation, might be that it is
politically favorable for legislators to keep down
prices of consumer goods. Just as rent-control
housing (as politically popular as it may be) usually
creates an excess of demand for housing at the
control price, a ban on the free market distribution
of tickets creates an excess demand for tickets at
the artificially-held low price.
Since Kohatsu recommends that the
anti-scalping laws be enforced, he is arguing against
a basic free-market policy.
Unfortunately, it is exactly this type of thinking
which has led to housing shortages, unemployment
(due to minimum wage restrictions) and a host of
other social ills all in the name of egalitarianism.

creates an excess of demand for housing at the
control price, a ban on the free market distribution
of tickets creates an excess demand for tickets at
the artificially-held low price.
Since Kohatsu recommends that the
anti-scalping laws be enforced, he is arguing against
a basic free-market policy.
Unfortunately, it is exactly this type of thinking
which has led to housing shortages, unemployment
(due to minimum wage restrictions) and a host of
other social ills all in the name of egalitarianism.

On Tuesday, Jan. 21, the Daily published a letter
from Neal Kohatsu decrying scalping on legal and
ethical grounds. Since there are certainly laws in
California against scalping, the legal question is
relatively moot. Moral arguments, however, are
questionable.
Kohatsu argues that scalpers prevented "quite a
few people from seeing their dream" of watching
Stanford's basketball team defeat UCLA. A
knowledge of simple economics and a quick glance
at the sellout figures would indicate to Kohatsu
that as many people as could fit into Maples
Pavilion were able to "see their dream."
What Kohatsu suggests, though, is that scalpers
kept people from seeing the sold-out game. What
the scalpers outside Maples really did was
efficiently allocate the tickets to those persons for
whom the tickets have high utility, as expressed
through purchasing behavior.
It seems that Kohatsu misplaced his disgust.
Perhaps he should be angered at the fire inspectors
who set the capacity limits for Maples Pavilion, or
maybe the architects or possibly even the Daily's
sports department for building up interest in the
game. Kohatsu could direct his ire much more
convincingly at any number of people responsible
for creating a situation in which demand for tickets
at their printed price far outstripped the meager
supply.
Evidently, Kohatsu and others opposed to
scalping prefer the means of distributing tickets that
is in practice now, which is the first-come,
first-served method. Alchian and Allen, in the book
University Economics, described the inadequacies
of this system.
They present a scenario in which the ticket
distributor could, "insist that all the [ticket]
applicants run a race and give the tickets to the first
200 to arrive at the finish line. This sounds silly. If
you simply replace the words 'finish line' by 'box
office' it is now realistic, but is it less silly? The

only difference is that for tickets there is no
uniform starting time or place, so that some
wiseacres start out a lot earlier and camp right at the
finish line."
What is also left unmentioned by those who
favor the present distribution method is that it
discriminates against those who are unable for any
reason to get to the ticket office early enough to
purchase tickets. For some people there might even
be too prohibitive of an opportunity cost to leave a
job or studying in order to wait in line for tickets.
For the person who would miss out on what he
considers to be $lO worth of classes, studying,
work or lesisure, paying an extra couple of dollars
for someone else to do the work of waiting in line
seems to be rather reasonable.
In 1972, a citizen's committee in New York
studying allotment of theatre tickets came out with
the recommendation that, "a free market for the
sale and distribution of tickets, with the laws of
supply and demand dictating how high or low
prices may go" should be adopted.
The reason their recommendation was acted
upon neither in New York, nor in many other
states across the nation, might be that it is
politically favorable for legislators to keep down
prices of consumer goods. Just as rent-control
housing (as politically popular as it may be) usually
creates an excess of demand for housing at the
control price, a ban on the free market distribution
of tickets creates an excess demand for tickets at
the artificially-held low price.
