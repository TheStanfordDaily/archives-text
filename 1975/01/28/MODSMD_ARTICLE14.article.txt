Don Cox's article (Daily, Jan.
21) on the recent meeting of
Humanities and Sciences faculty
members was informative and
generally accurate, but
unfortunately attributed to me a
number of the statements that
were in fact made by Faculty
Senate representatives.
In particular, the statement
"We're unlike the Law School.
Their solution is simple. Just
admit more students to raise
funds...." was not made by me.
Nor did I refer to the question of
equitability in "making one
school bear a disproportionate
share of the financial burden."
It would be presumptuous on
my part as dean to assess the ease
or hardship of methods by which
another School might solve its
budgetary problems. It is difficult
enough to make such assessments
for my own School.
I did caution the faculty at
that meeting that my remarks on
the expected impact of the budget
reduction program were still very
speculative and are currently
under review by the Provost and
the Commission on University
Budget Priorities. It is they who
will have to come to terms with
the question of equitability of
cuts in different areas of the
University.
They may conclude that
Humanities and Sciences should
make even steeper cuts than I
suggested in my remarks, although
I hope they will find that
considerations of equity would
make for fewer reductions in this
School's faculty than the thirty or
so positions I indicated as possible
cutbacks.
Both my faculty and I believe
that we should contribute our
share to help in the difficult
process of achieving financial
stability for the University. The
entire process of review and debate
is an attempt to determine what
that fair share should be.

With all the talk about a
proposed residential college at
Stanford, I have yet to hear one
peep about a program which in
my opinion offers many of the
same benefits as would the
residential college.
Fifty students living in Arroyo
and Cedro Houses participate in a
freshman seminar on Structured
Liberal Education. The program
imposes a nine-unit commitment
on the part of the students
more than half the normal
academic load. The program
employs a close faculty working
group headed by History Prof.
Mark Mancall, resident fellow at
Arroyo.

Does not this seem remarkedly
similar to the program proposed
by Mike Herman and Tom Glenn?
I suggest that some kind of
evaluation of the SLE program is
in order, before planning of
"Stanford in Stanford" is
continued.

Recently I was greeted by a
parking ticket placed on my car,
which was parked in my assigned
parking place in Escondido
Village. I am supposed to pay a $2
fine because I do not have the
required parking permit. All I do
is pay for this parking place every
time I pay my rent. That is
apparently not enough.
My wife is employed at the
Medical Center. Should she get a
staff permit? Then she would be
ticketed for parking at home in
the Village. I am a graduate
student, should I get a student
permit? Then I would be ticketed
for parking at home. Should we
get an Escondido Village permit?
Then we would be ticketed for
parking on campus.
Should we get two or three
permits and forfeit $l5 for the
privilege of parking in a space
that we already pay for? Or is
anyone going to attempt to clarify
this incredibly inane situation?
These questions are rhetorical.
The answer to all of them is
"none of the above." I am going
to wait for a more intelligent
answer. But I won't hold my
breath.

Both my faculty and I believe
that we should contribute our
share to help in the difficult
process of achieving financial
stability for the University. The
entire process of review and debate
is an attempt to determine what
that fair share should be.

With all the talk about a
proposed residential college at
Stanford, I have yet to hear one
peep about a program which in
my opinion offers many of the
same benefits as would the
residential college.
Fifty students living in Arroyo
and Cedro Houses participate in a
freshman seminar on Structured
Liberal Education. The program
imposes a nine-unit commitment
on the part of the students
more than half the normal
academic load. The program
employs a close faculty working
group headed by History Prof.
Mark Mancall, resident fellow at
Arroyo.

Does not this seem remarkedly
similar to the program proposed
by Mike Herman and Tom Glenn?
I suggest that some kind of
evaluation of the SLE program is
in order, before planning of
"Stanford in Stanford" is
continued.

Recently I was greeted by a
parking ticket placed on my car,
which was parked in my assigned
parking place in Escondido
Village. I am supposed to pay a $2
fine because I do not have the
required parking permit. All I do
is pay for this parking place every
time I pay my rent. That is
apparently not enough.
My wife is employed at the
Medical Center. Should she get a
staff permit? Then she would be
ticketed for parking at home in
the Village. I am a graduate
student, should I get a student
permit? Then I would be ticketed
for parking at home. Should we
get an Escondido Village permit?
Then we would be ticketed for
parking on campus.
Should we get two or three
permits and forfeit $l5 for the
privilege of parking in a space
that we already pay for? Or is
anyone going to attempt to clarify
this incredibly inane situation?
These questions are rhetorical.
The answer to all of them is
"none of the above." I am going
to wait for a more intelligent
answer. But I won't hold my
breath.

Don Cox's article (Daily, Jan.
21) on the recent meeting of
Humanities and Sciences faculty
members was informative and
generally accurate, but
unfortunately attributed to me a
number of the statements that
were in fact made by Faculty
Senate representatives.
In particular, the statement
"We're unlike the Law School.
Their solution is simple. Just
admit more students to raise
funds...." was not made by me.
Nor did I refer to the question of
equitability in "making one
school bear a disproportionate
share of the financial burden."
It would be presumptuous on
my part as dean to assess the ease
or hardship of methods by which
another School might solve its
budgetary problems. It is difficult
enough to make such assessments
for my own School.
I did caution the faculty at
that meeting that my remarks on
the expected impact of the budget
reduction program were still very
speculative and are currently
under review by the Provost and
the Commission on University
Budget Priorities. It is they who
will have to come to terms with
the question of equitability of
cuts in different areas of the
University.
They may conclude that
Humanities and Sciences should
make even steeper cuts than I
suggested in my remarks, although
I hope they will find that
considerations of equity would
make for fewer reductions in this
School's faculty than the thirty or
so positions I indicated as possible
cutbacks.
