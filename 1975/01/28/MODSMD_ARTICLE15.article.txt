## Stanford's Archive Of Recorded Sound Offers Listeners A Blast From The Past 
### CECILE HEROLD 
Entering Stanford's. Archive of
Recorded sound is almost like
entering a vault.
The long, dark room, housing
over 100,000 items of recorded
sound, is located on the first level
of the Knoll. However, the middle
and rear portions of the Archives
are actually underground since the
Knoll is partly constructed under
a hill.

In the Archive sound cellar,
the zealous discographer and
music researcher will discover
shelves stacked with*, record discs,
magnetic tape recordings, player
piano music rolls, even the
cylinders on which sound
recordings were first made.
According to head music librarian
Ed Colby, the record discs bear
the labels of every kind, including
Victor, Columbia, Brunswick and
many European names.
One record label may stand out
above the others. It is found on a
thick black disc and reads,
"Edison," designating a relic of

the inventor's sound company
which he sold in 1922. The
Archive's entire record collection
dates back to 1916, Colby said.
More To Come
During a recent tour of the
Archives, Colby reached for one
item from a record shelf, a
mammoth disc 16 inches in
diameter. *'This recording was
used in radio," he explained,
"before tape was invented."
Printed on its brown paper
wrapping is a message to the
long-ago announcer: "After
broadcasting, hold this disc for
instructions."
"We probably have some Jack
Benny radio programs, too,"
Colby said, "but assessing and
classifying everything to see
exactly what we've got is a big
task and there is no staff member
assigned to work full time here."
Colby continued the tour,
passing one aisle stacked with
78-rpm recordings. He said that
the Archives held both acoustic
and electric recordings.

"For acoustic recordings, the
amplification of sound was
provided only by the recording or
playback horn. There was no
electricity involved. It wasn't until
1925 that a microphone was used
during the recording session," he
explained.'
History In Sound
Shelved neatly along the
outskirts of the Archives room is
the large collection of magnetic
tapes featuring student recitals
and Stanford music concerts
dating from 1952.
"When students make
applications to music
conservatories, they simply send
along a taped copy of one of their
recitals," Colby explained. The
tape collection also includes
speeches given at Stanford by
faculty, students and visitors
since 1916.
According to Colby, the first
of these speeches is called, "The
Spirit of Stanford," and was
delivered by then-President David
Starr Jordan on the occasion of

Stanford's 25th anniversary.
"We also have commencement
speeches, some recordings of the
campus disturbances in 1970, and
most recently, Professor David
Kennedy's sppech on 'War and the
American Character,'" Colby
said.
Since the Archives lacks the
personnel to make its own
recordings, the collection is
dependent upon tapes received
"from the Music Department,
KZSU, Public Events and the
news services," Colby said.
Handle With Care
"Many of the recordings are so
fragile that we must limit our
number of visitors," Colby
"We're not at all like
the Tresidder record listening
rooms or Meyer's listening lab."
As a result, admission by
appointments is extended only to
graduate students and faculty
members involved in research
which the Archives might benefit.
"Extra consideration would be
given to any undergraduate
student involved in a special
research project, such as a senior
honors essay," Colby said.
One Archive-user, first-year
graduate student Marilyn Barber,
is comparing different
interpretations of German lieder,
poetic art songs written in the
19th century by such composers
as Wlf, Schubert and Schumann.
Colby said Barber's, project
was a classic example of the
research possibilities of the
Archives. He compared her
undertaking to drama studies,
where "you might correlate the
numerous interpretations of
Hamlet's 'To be or not to be.' "
Label Lovers
Another less classic example of
research at the Archives is the
project of two Stanford alumni,
Ted Fagan and Bill Moran.
Moran, a devoted music
archeologist who helped establish
the Archive in 1958, has begun an
entire inventory of Victor
recordings starting from the
turn-of-the-century.
With Fagan, he is identifying
each Victor record according to
serial number, performer, date
recorded and the key in which it
is sung or played. Colby said the
two record buffs were overjoyed
to discover the Archive's

collection of old Victor black
label discs.
Besides its wealth of sound
recordings, the Archive houses
many types of sound machines.
Some old Edison photographs
with wind-up cranks are located
near the entry way.
Sousaphone's Sisters
Other phonographs, smaller
than the standing Edison varieties,
feature wide morning-glory
sounds horns. The horns are
painted bright colors and bear a
striking resemblance to the
sousaphone section of the
Stanford band.
Close to these phonos are the
manochels, machines which
produce sound from the cylinder
recordings. One mandrel with a
patent date of 1898 looks like a
wooden lunch box.
Along the Archive's farthest
wall, one finds the most modern
sound equipment, including
record players, amplifiers and
tape recorders. Thus, in a space of
about 65 feet, Archive visitors
witness the entire evolution of
sound recordings and equipment.
To top it all off, they can listen to
a different recorded piece each
day for the next 274 years.
