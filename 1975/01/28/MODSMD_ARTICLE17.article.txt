I have heard a rumor that a new law has gone into
effect requiring all bicycles to have a white
reflector mounted on the front of the bike and
reflectors on the wheels. Is this true, and if so, will
I violate the law by riding a bike without these
reflectors, even if I ride only during daylight hours?
-P.S.
You don't know the half of it. A new section of
the California State Vehicle Code went into effect
Jan. 1, 1975. Under 21201.5, sub-section D, each
bicycle ridden in the state of California is required
to have the following a white reflector on the
front, a red reflector to the rear, a white or yellow
reflector on each side (forward of the center of the
bicycle) and a red reflector on each side (to the rear
of center). The reflectors can be mounted on the
spokes or on the crossbar.
An alternative to the side reflectors is
reflectorized tires on the front and rear of the
bicycle.

But that's not all. According to sub-section E
under the same section of the Code, these reflector
requirements apply to any bike ridden on a public
street at any time. Therefore, you would be
breaking the law if you rode your bike in daylight
hours without the six reflectors.
However, there is a ray of hope. Deputy Arthur
Clark, Bike Officer of the sheriff's office of Santa
Clara County and the source of this information,
said that most citations are still being given only at
night.
Why don't the bells ring in the physics tank and
math corner? I'm tired of listening to Dave Haskins
for an hour and ten minutes every day. —T.P.
Good news for unlucky physics and/or math
majors. Bruce Wiggins, operations manager at Plant
Services, reports that electricians are now working
on the bells in the math corner. Apparently, there
is a break in a control cable which they have yet to
find. Wiggins also promised to check out the
physics tank.
