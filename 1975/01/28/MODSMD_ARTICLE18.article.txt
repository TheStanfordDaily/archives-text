# Cardinal Cage Streak Snapped By Houston
## 
### 
Houston snapped Stanford's
four-game basketball winning
streak last night with a 74-68
victory over the Cards at Hofheinz
Pavilion.
Houston, paced by Louis
Dunbar's 29 points, led 41-33 at
halftime before the Cards
exploded for 10 straight points
and a 43-41 lead at the start of
the second period. The Cougars
recovered quickly, however,
regaining their lead with 11:36
left and holding on for the
victory.
Houston led by 12 points with
seven minutes remaining and went
into a slowdown in the last SV2
minutes.
Scott Trobbe led Stanford
scorers with 20 points on 10-13
from the field, while freshman Jay
Carter added 14. Rich Kelley,
sidelined much of the game with
foul problems, finished with 13
points and a game-high 11
rebounds.
Kelley picked up his third foul

eight minutes into the game, his
fourth with 17 minutes left and
his fifth with four minutes
remaining.
Card coach Howie Dalhnar was
charged with the first technical
foul in his 21-year coaching
career. He was slapped with the
technical even though he said, "I
was just standing up. I didn't say a
word I was just stretching my
shorts."
Dallmar asked the referee to
explain what prompted the
technical and the * official
responded, "Nothing. I could just
read your mind."
Stanford, ranked 17 th
nationally in yesterday's AP poll,
is now 9-7 for the season.
Houston evened its record at 8-8.
