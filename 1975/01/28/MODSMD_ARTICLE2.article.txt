# Senate To Explore Intelligence Agencies
## 
### 
* WASHINGTON(AP)— The Senate
voted 82-4 yesterday to launch a new
Watergate-style investigation into
allegations that U.S. intelligence
agencies were permitted to stray into
the legally forbidden area of domestic
spying.
» Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield, saying neither a whitewash
nor a vendetta will be permitted,
immediately named the panel's six
Democratic members. No chairman
has been chosen as yet.
Mansfield said he would give
•preference to young senators and his
list includes the names of two who
won election only last November.
They are Sens. Gary Hart (D-Colo.)
37, and Robert Morgan (D-N.C.) 49.
The others are Sens. Philip A. Hart
(D-Mich.), Frank Church (D-Idaho),
F. Mondale (D-Minn.) and
Walter D. Huddleston (D-Ky.).
GOPers Named
Senate Republican Leader Hugh
Scott named the panel's five GOP
members last week. They are Sen.
John Tower (R-Tex.), who will serve
* as vice chairman, and Sens. Barry
Goldwater (R-Ariz.), Charles McC.
Mathias Jr. (R-Md.), Richard S.
Schweiker (R-Pa.) and Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.).
The nine-month, $750,000
investigation will attempt to test the
* veracity of allegations that
intelligence-gathering agencies violated
their charters and broke the law by
conducting forbidden surveillance
inside the United States. The Senate
vote came after a debate in which Sen.
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), a leading
critic, warned that the probe must
overcome "some powerful incentives
for a cover-up."
Cranston called on the committee
to conduct as much of its business as

possible open to the full view of the
public.
Impossible
Tower said that request may be
impossible to fulfill.
Witnesses may be more
forthcoming in secret sessions where
national security interests will be
easier to protect, Tower said.
There are a large number of persons
still in public office who bear
responsibility for the alleged abuses of
the powers of the Central Intelligence
Agency, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and other intelligence
operations, Cranston said.
'Can't Be Picnic'
"While this investigation cannot be
a witch hunt, it cannot be a picnic
either," Cranston said. "There are
bound to be a lot of skeletons in a lot
of closets."
Meanwhile, the commission
appointed by President Ford and
headed by Vice President Nelson A.
Rockefeller resumed its probe of
alleged wrongdoing by the CIA.
William E. Colby, head of the CIA,
went before the committee for a
second round of questioning.
Rockefeller said he believes the
commission he heads will find the CIA
violated its authority by spying on
Americans and must determine who
ordered the allegedly illegal
operations.
The first task of his commission, he
explained, is to find out the truth of
reports, first published in The New
York Times on Dec. 22, that the CIA
kept tabs on American protesters,
through eavesdropping and other
spying.
"I think we are going to find the
answer is yes," Rockefeller said,
adding that the commission has had
"no problem whatsoever" in getting
people to talk.

operations.
The first task of his commission, he
explained, is to find out the truth of
reports, first published in The New
York Times on Dec. 22, that the CIA
kept tabs on American protesters,
through eavesdropping and other
spying.
"I think we are going to find the
answer is yes," Rockefeller said,
adding that the commission has had
"no problem whatsoever" in getting
people to talk.
* WASHINGTON(AP)— The Senate
voted 82-4 yesterday to launch a new
Watergate-style investigation into
allegations that U.S. intelligence
agencies were permitted to stray into
the legally forbidden area of domestic
spying.
» Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield, saying neither a whitewash
nor a vendetta will be permitted,
immediately named the panel's six
Democratic members. No chairman
has been chosen as yet.
Mansfield said he would give
•preference to young senators and his
list includes the names of two who
won election only last November.
They are Sens. Gary Hart (D-Colo.)
37, and Robert Morgan (D-N.C.) 49.
The others are Sens. Philip A. Hart
(D-Mich.), Frank Church (D-Idaho),
F. Mondale (D-Minn.) and
Walter D. Huddleston (D-Ky.).
GOPers Named
Senate Republican Leader Hugh
Scott named the panel's five GOP
members last week. They are Sen.
John Tower (R-Tex.), who will serve
* as vice chairman, and Sens. Barry
Goldwater (R-Ariz.), Charles McC.
Mathias Jr. (R-Md.), Richard S.
Schweiker (R-Pa.) and Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.).
The nine-month, $750,000
investigation will attempt to test the
* veracity of allegations that
intelligence-gathering agencies violated
their charters and broke the law by
conducting forbidden surveillance
inside the United States. The Senate
vote came after a debate in which Sen.
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), a leading
critic, warned that the probe must
overcome "some powerful incentives
for a cover-up."
Cranston called on the committee
to conduct as much of its business as

possible open to the full view of the
public.
Impossible
Tower said that request may be
impossible to fulfill.
Witnesses may be more
forthcoming in secret sessions where
national security interests will be
easier to protect, Tower said.
There are a large number of persons
still in public office who bear
responsibility for the alleged abuses of
the powers of the Central Intelligence
Agency, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and other intelligence
operations, Cranston said.
'Can't Be Picnic'
"While this investigation cannot be
a witch hunt, it cannot be a picnic
either," Cranston said. "There are
bound to be a lot of skeletons in a lot
of closets."
Meanwhile, the commission
appointed by President Ford and
headed by Vice President Nelson A.
Rockefeller resumed its probe of
alleged wrongdoing by the CIA.
William E. Colby, head of the CIA,
went before the committee for a
second round of questioning.
Rockefeller said he believes the
commission he heads will find the CIA
violated its authority by spying on
Americans and must determine who
ordered the allegedly illegal
operations.
