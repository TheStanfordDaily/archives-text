## Dave Mason, Journey Set Maples Shaking Mason's Familiar Tunes Please Dancing Audience 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Dave Mason has had a
checkered career.
An original member of Traffic,
the fine English group, Mason
split before the band recorded its
first album, supposedly in a
dispute with the band's guiding
light, Steve Winwood. Mason later
rejoined the group and penned its
biggest hit, "Feelin' Alright,"
before splitting again to record
one of rock's most underrated
albums of all time, Alone
Together.

After a disastrous team-up try
with the late Cass Elliott and a
little touring with Delaney &
Bonnie, Mason returned to Traffic
for yet a third time, then went
solo again, switched record
companies in a legal tangle, and
has generally spent most of his
time since bobbing up and down.
Mason's concert at Maples
Pavilion followed much the same
pattern as his career has. It had
high points mostly in the
superb workmanship of Mason
and his excellent backup band
and low points, most of which
weren't Mason's fault.
Audience Problems
It was the audience itself that
caused the biggest problem, such
as it was. It appeared that the
crowd wanted to do nothing but
boogie and Dave Mason just
isn't that kind of performer.
Mason's forte is excellent rock,
but accomplished so effortlessly
that he doesn't even appear to be
working. The end result is that
Mason is not a high-energy
performer but it seemed to be a
high-energy crowd Sunday night.
This should take nothing away
from Mason's performance. He

was in excellent voice, fantastic
instrumental form, and mixed his
numbers well: songs from his
Traffic days ("Feelin' Alright,"
"Pearly Queen), his solo albums
("Waitin' On You," "World In
Changes") and songs by other
artists.
If there was one thing missing
from Mason's performance, it was
his biggest hit single, "Only You
Know And I Know," which was a
smash in both his version and
Delaney & Bonnie's. There were a
few calls for it from the crowd,
which were ignored during the set,
and it might have made a riice
encore.
Guitar Mastery Clear
Throughout the evening,
Mason's mastery of the guitar was
manifest, and it isn't much of an
exaggeration to say he ranks with
Eric Clapton and Steve Stills as
one of the finest lead guitarists
extant. He was backed beautifully
by a quartet; the only thing
annoying about it was that the
band members were never
introduced.

Toward the end of the show,
Mason began giving the crowd

more of what it seemed to want.
First came a driving version of
"All Along the Watchtower" that
owed far more to Jimi Hendrix
than to Dylan, then a frenetic
version of Little Richard's
"Lucille," and then a powerful
blues number called "Steal Your
Heart Away" that was to have
climaxed the show.
Unfortunately, the sound
system chose that last number to
break down for the second time in
the set, dissipating the momentum
that had been building. Mason
came back, performed two more
numbers and split.
The audience, which had been
respectful if not ecstatic all night,
brought him back for two
encores: the oldie, "Bring It On
Back To Me," and, surprisingly,
"Gimme Some Lovin'," a song
that is virtually a Winwood
trademark.
In general, it certainly can't be
said that Mason was a failure, or
even a disappointment: he was
excellent. And yet, somehow, one
was left with a faint feeling of,
well, dissatisfaction, in that
audience and performer just
didn't quite mesh.
