# Journey's Tight Set: Incredible Energy
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Someone should have warned Journey about the hazards of
overexciting a Maples Pavilion crowd.
By the time San Francisco's new superstars wound up Sunday's
first set with their rowdiest chart, "Play Some Music," the stage at
Maples was rocking like the revenge of San Andreas.
But Journey is the sort of band that makes the concrete floor of
Winterland move, so it was no surprise that Stanford's music fans
found their minds systematically blown Sunday.
There is a definite system to Journey's set. Initial impact
"Mystery Mountain," a devestating opening song that balances the
band's overwhelming talents to describe the eruption of a volcano:
Molten rock created under
Vibrations of subterranean thunder,
Ejecting boulders and pieces of sand
The mountain is giving birth to the land.
As volcalist-keyboardman Gregg Rolie sings, "Underfoot you feel
the rumble, as thousands of rocks are starting to tumble," drummer
Aynsley Dunbar recreates the thunder, backed solidly by the
pounding chords of lead guitarist Neal Schon, second guitarist George
Tickner and the driving bass of Ross Valory.
Somehow the fine points of "Mystery Mountain" get lost at times,
whether because Journey takes about three songs to really warm up,
or because their sound is so unusual that it takes people a little time
to get into their style.
But their second song, "Master of My Soul," gave the Maples
crowd something incredible: a guitar solo by Neal Schon that
extracted oohs, aahs and thunderous applause from the fans. Schon
has taste, a certain style that puts him a cut above guitarists who
might otherwise be his equal.
Nowhere is Schon's style more evident than in his own
composition, as yet untitled but probably to be called "I'm Coming
Home." A slow, melodic beginning turns into a musical power play,
with Schon putting out heavy, heavy energy not only through his own
riffs but also through the very structure of what he's written.
By the time they hit "Topaz," an instrumental sure to be one of
the classics borne by Journey's February album debut, the band was
hot and the crowd was moving. "Topaz," however, is swift yet lyrical,
just not the kind of thing to boogie to. It is packed with the essence
of Journey's energy, however, and proves to be the turning point of
almost every set they play.
With "Topaz"over, the Maples crowd was totally turned on to
what it was experiencing, ready for one more slow melody
George Tickner's lovely "Of A Lifetime" before the explosion into
"I'm Gonna Leave" and "Play Some Music."
"I wish we could play another set now," said Neal Schon when it
was over, and for a lot of people's money white-hot Journey could
have kept playing.
... which explains the inevitable dorm room speculation in the
first hour of the Monday morning that came too soon: did Dave
Mason play a low-energy set, or did another of rock's top names lose
ground by playing a gig with Journey?

Winterland move, so it was no surprise that Stanford's music fans
found their minds systematically blown Sunday.
There is a definite system to Journey's set. Initial impact
"Mystery Mountain," a devestating opening song that balances the
band's overwhelming talents to describe the eruption of a volcano:
Molten rock created under
Vibrations of subterranean thunder,
Ejecting boulders and pieces of sand
The mountain is giving birth to the land.
As volcalist-keyboardman Gregg Rolie sings, "Underfoot you feel
the rumble, as thousands of rocks are starting to tumble," drummer
Aynsley Dunbar recreates the thunder, backed solidly by the
pounding chords of lead guitarist Neal Schon, second guitarist George
Tickner and the driving bass of Ross Valory.
Somehow the fine points of "Mystery Mountain" get lost at times,
whether because Journey takes about three songs to really warm up,
or because their sound is so unusual that it takes people a little time
to get into their style.
But their second song, "Master of My Soul," gave the Maples
crowd something incredible: a guitar solo by Neal Schon that
extracted oohs, aahs and thunderous applause from the fans. Schon
has taste, a certain style that puts him a cut above guitarists who
might otherwise be his equal.
Nowhere is Schon's style more evident than in his own
composition, as yet untitled but probably to be called "I'm Coming
Home." A slow, melodic beginning turns into a musical power play,
with Schon putting out heavy, heavy energy not only through his own
riffs but also through the very structure of what he's written.
By the time they hit "Topaz," an instrumental sure to be one of
the classics borne by Journey's February album debut, the band was
hot and the crowd was moving. "Topaz," however, is swift yet lyrical,
just not the kind of thing to boogie to. It is packed with the essence
of Journey's energy, however, and proves to be the turning point of
almost every set they play.
With "Topaz"over, the Maples crowd was totally turned on to
what it was experiencing, ready for one more slow melody
George Tickner's lovely "Of A Lifetime" before the explosion into
"I'm Gonna Leave" and "Play Some Music."
"I wish we could play another set now," said Neal Schon when it
was over, and for a lot of people's money white-hot Journey could
have kept playing.
... which explains the inevitable dorm room speculation in the
first hour of the Monday morning that came too soon: did Dave
Mason play a low-energy set, or did another of rock's top names lose
ground by playing a gig with Journey?
Someone should have warned Journey about the hazards of
overexciting a Maples Pavilion crowd.
By the time San Francisco's new superstars wound up Sunday's
first set with their rowdiest chart, "Play Some Music," the stage at
Maples was rocking like the revenge of San Andreas.
But Journey is the sort of band that makes the concrete floor of
Winterland move, so it was no surprise that Stanford's music fans
found their minds systematically blown Sunday.
