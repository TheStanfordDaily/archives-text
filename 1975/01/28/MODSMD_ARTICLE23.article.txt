# S.F. Symphony
## Orchestra Stays In Tune With Times 
### 
The San Francisco Symphony
is doing its best to dispel the
notion that, in modern society,
the traditional symphony
orchestra is outdated and
irrelevant.
Last week's program proved
that the orchestra is capable of
relating to contemporary as
well as traditional tastes and
standards by featuring a broad
range of music and soloists.
The Orchestra warmed up on
Franz Joseph Haydn's Symphony
No. 48 in C Major (Maria
Theresa). The symphony,
composed in the mid-18th
century, is very classical in form
and style, with an equal interplay
of horns and strings.

The horns played their
extremely difficult parts
magnificently, but the rest of the
Orchestra doesn't deserve such
praise. Tempos and rhythms were
insecure, and the performance
lacked unity and expression.
Possibly the Orchestra was
suffering from a lack of rehearsal,
or possibly they weren't inspired
by this particular symphony.
Haynd composed 104
symphonies, and even a master
occasionally strikes out.
Irina Bochkova, acclaimed
Russian violinist, offered no
respite from the lackluster
beginning with her rendition of
Felix Mendelssohn's romantic
Violin Concerto in E Minor, Opus
64.

Some musicians play with
perfect intonation and skimp on
expression; she exemplifies an
exaggeration of the opposite. She
swooned, swayed and used every
element of musicians' body
language to convey an intensity
and energy that was no doubt
sincere but didn't cover poor
playing.
Mixed Reactions
Her problems, to name a few,
were poor intonation, especially
in the first movement, a scratchy,
superficial tone and a lack of
cohesion with the orchestra
particularly evident in the coda.
But the audience seemed to like
it, and some even gave her a
standing ovation.
The interpretation of George
Bizet's Roma , performed in honor
of the 100 th anniversary of his
death, marked a substantial
improvement. Bizet generally
composed for opera, and this

piece reflects his theatrical,
'program music' style.
The flutes played their colorful
melodies brilliantly in the first
movement, and the violins, violas
and cellos fully captured the
lighthearted sway of the second
movement. In the finale, the
trumpets, horns and the timpani
were a forceful and rhythmical
backup to the * rest of the
Orchestra in a sweeping triple
forte.

Everything Worthwhile
Any problems encountered in
the first part of the concert were
worth sitting through in order to
hear the World Premiere of
Carman Moore's Gospel Fuse. Mr.
Moore is one of the few black
composers to gain wide
recognition among music
audiences, and he deserves it all.
Completed in 1974, the Gospel
Fuse is a moving and emotional
piece that gets 'right to the gut' of
the audience. It combines
traditional gospel songs and
modern instrumental technique in
a remarkably coherent way.
Not only is the piece a far cry
from the traditional symphonic

fare, but the performers
themselves are from a totally
different world, the symphonic
elite. They are from such cities as
Harlem and Brooklyn, and their
professional experiences range
from back-ups to Bob Dylan,
Aretha Franklin, Burt Bacharach
and Dionne Warwicke, to
performances on the Merv Griffin
Show and the New York
Philharmonic.
Good Solos
Soloists and orchestra were
excellent, but Cissy Houston and
Sam Rivers particularly come to
mind. Miss Houston's voice has a
volume and tone that would put
some opera singers to shame, and
the microphone was obviously
unnecessary. Mr. Rivers played his
difficult sax solo like rippling
water, giving it a voice like
quality.

Mr. Moore should be quite
pleased with the premiere of his
work; not only was it a
memorable performance for
which the audience responded
with a standing ovation, but it
proved that the symphony is a
relevant instrument for all of
today's and yesterday's music.

excellent set that somehow missed really turning on the lively crowd
at Maples Pavilion Sunday.
