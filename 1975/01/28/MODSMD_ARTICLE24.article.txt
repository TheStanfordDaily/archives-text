Stock Market Jumps 26 Points
NEW YORK The stock market roared ahead yesterday
in a binge of buying that produced the heaviest activity in
New York Stock Exchange history.
Brokers gave a large part of the credit to falling interest
rates and a jubilant welcome on Wall Street to a federal
appeals court's ruling in favor of International Business
Machines Corp. in an antitrust case.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 26.05
to 692.66 for its largest gain since Oct. 9, and its eighth
biggest ever.
Big Board volume hit 32.13 million shares, shattering the
oil record of 31.73 million set Aug. 16,1971.
Tho Denounces U.S. 'lntimidation'
SAIGON Le Due Tho, who signed the Vietnamese
cease-fire agreement with Henry A. Kissinger two years ago,
charged the Ford administration yesterday with "giving a
new path to the war" by urging additional military aid for
the Saigon government.
In military action, Communist and government troops
clashed along the Cambodian border 55 miles west of
Saigon. The Saigon command said 41 North Vietnamese
and six government troops were killed, and two A37
bombers were shot down.
Speaking on North Vietnamese television to mark the
second anniversary of the accord, Tho said the Ford
administration was attempting to intimidate the
Vietnamese people through military aid to South Vietnam
and by "sending aircraft carriers and warships to the South
Vietnamese territorial waters and putting U.S. troops
stationed in Okinawa on alert."
"All these threats are of no avail to the Vietnamese
people," Tho said. He said South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu must be overthrown because he has
"scrapped" the Paris agreement.
Sadat Visiting France
PARIS Closely guarded against possible terrorist
attack, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat began a three-day
visit to France yesterday, seeking jet planes and tanks and a
European role in Mideast peacemaking.
Sadat, on his first excursion into the Western world since
taking office over four years ago, was greeted at Orly
Airport by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife.
Police sharpshooters stood on roofs ajoining the VIP
lounge and plain-clothesmen almost outnumbered officials.
The ceremonies took place less than half a mile from where
Arab gunmen twice tried to blow up Israeli airliners within
the past two weeks.
Sadat condemned the attacks and said they were aimed
against his search for a political settlement in the Mideast.
A gusty, rain-lashed day forced cancellation of a
helicopter ride into the city and the two presidents
switched to a motorcade. Riot police were stationed every
90 feet on the 10-mile run into Paris.
Union Officials End Rail Strike
CHICAGO Officials of shopcraft unions called an end

to a brief strike against railroads in the Midwest, Northwest
and South yesterday after a court order was issued sending
employees back to work.
Strikes were calk.' at midnight Sunday against the
Burlington Northern, Chesapeake & Ohio and Louisville &
Nashville systems by four craft unions in apparent protest
over the lack of a contract with the railroads.
A Burlington spokesman said national negotiations,
currently under way in Washington, over wage increases
may have been a cause of the walkout, but none of the
union leaders would give a specific reason for the strike.
U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Sam Perry issued a
restraining order in Chicago calling for an end to the
walkout. The order is effective until 6 p.m. Feb. 5, and a
hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. Feb. 3.
The Burlington Northern line that serves about 23,000
commuters from Chicago's western suburbs was shut down
temporarily but was back in service by midmorning
yesterday, officials said.
Auto Antipollution Devices Polluting?
WASHINGTON The Environmental Protection
Agency reported yesterday that the antipollution devices
adopted by the auto industry may be creating a new health
hazard more serious than the one they were designed to
correct.
A tentative scientific study was released by EPA at a
press conference, with the warning that its preliminary
conclusions could be changed by further study.
But the report cast doubt on the present direction taken
by the auto industry using catalytic converters to meet
federal limits on emissions of carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.
Oil Union Settles More Contracts
DENVER The oil workers union said yesterday it had
settled contracts with Standard of Ohio, Marathon and
Crown Central covering about 1450 workers.
The union said the settlement with Standard of Ohio did
not include a refinery at Toledo, Ohio, where about 400
workers walked out over local issues earlier.
The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International
Union said the settlements with the three oil companies
matched the pattern settlement reached earlier with several
oil companies.
It calls for a 26.8 percent wage hike over two years with
a wage reopener clause if the National Consumer Index rises
more than five percent in the first year of the pact. Oil
workers made about $5.95 an hour under the old contract.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except partly cloudy for a time
tomorrow. Continued cool. Low both nights in low 30s to
low 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in 50s. Northwesterly
wind 10 to 20 mph except small craft advisory Suisun Bay
and West Delta for 15 to 35 mph.

new path to the war" by urging additional military aid for
the Saigon government.
In military action, Communist and government troops
clashed along the Cambodian border 55 miles west of
Saigon. The Saigon command said 41 North Vietnamese
and six government troops were killed, and two A37
bombers were shot down.
Speaking on North Vietnamese television to mark the
second anniversary of the accord, Tho said the Ford
administration was attempting to intimidate the
Vietnamese people through military aid to South Vietnam
and by "sending aircraft carriers and warships to the South
Vietnamese territorial waters and putting U.S. troops
stationed in Okinawa on alert."
"All these threats are of no avail to the Vietnamese
people," Tho said. He said South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu must be overthrown because he has
"scrapped" the Paris agreement.
Sadat Visiting France
PARIS Closely guarded against possible terrorist
attack, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat began a three-day
visit to France yesterday, seeking jet planes and tanks and a
European role in Mideast peacemaking.
Sadat, on his first excursion into the Western world since
taking office over four years ago, was greeted at Orly
Airport by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife.
Police sharpshooters stood on roofs ajoining the VIP
lounge and plain-clothesmen almost outnumbered officials.
The ceremonies took place less than half a mile from where
Arab gunmen twice tried to blow up Israeli airliners within
the past two weeks.
Sadat condemned the attacks and said they were aimed
against his search for a political settlement in the Mideast.
A gusty, rain-lashed day forced cancellation of a
helicopter ride into the city and the two presidents
switched to a motorcade. Riot police were stationed every
90 feet on the 10-mile run into Paris.
Union Officials End Rail Strike
CHICAGO Officials of shopcraft unions called an end

to a brief strike against railroads in the Midwest, Northwest
and South yesterday after a court order was issued sending
employees back to work.
Strikes were calk.' at midnight Sunday against the
Burlington Northern, Chesapeake & Ohio and Louisville &
Nashville systems by four craft unions in apparent protest
over the lack of a contract with the railroads.
A Burlington spokesman said national negotiations,
currently under way in Washington, over wage increases
may have been a cause of the walkout, but none of the
union leaders would give a specific reason for the strike.
U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Sam Perry issued a
restraining order in Chicago calling for an end to the
walkout. The order is effective until 6 p.m. Feb. 5, and a
hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. Feb. 3.
The Burlington Northern line that serves about 23,000
commuters from Chicago's western suburbs was shut down
temporarily but was back in service by midmorning
yesterday, officials said.
Auto Antipollution Devices Polluting?
WASHINGTON The Environmental Protection
Agency reported yesterday that the antipollution devices
adopted by the auto industry may be creating a new health
hazard more serious than the one they were designed to
correct.
A tentative scientific study was released by EPA at a
press conference, with the warning that its preliminary
conclusions could be changed by further study.
But the report cast doubt on the present direction taken
by the auto industry using catalytic converters to meet
federal limits on emissions of carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.
Oil Union Settles More Contracts
DENVER The oil workers union said yesterday it had
settled contracts with Standard of Ohio, Marathon and
Crown Central covering about 1450 workers.
The union said the settlement with Standard of Ohio did
not include a refinery at Toledo, Ohio, where about 400
workers walked out over local issues earlier.
The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International
Union said the settlements with the three oil companies
matched the pattern settlement reached earlier with several
oil companies.
It calls for a 26.8 percent wage hike over two years with
a wage reopener clause if the National Consumer Index rises
more than five percent in the first year of the pact. Oil
workers made about $5.95 an hour under the old contract.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except partly cloudy for a time
tomorrow. Continued cool. Low both nights in low 30s to
low 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in 50s. Northwesterly
wind 10 to 20 mph except small craft advisory Suisun Bay
and West Delta for 15 to 35 mph.
Stock Market Jumps 26 Points
NEW YORK The stock market roared ahead yesterday
in a binge of buying that produced the heaviest activity in
New York Stock Exchange history.
Brokers gave a large part of the credit to falling interest
rates and a jubilant welcome on Wall Street to a federal
appeals court's ruling in favor of International Business
Machines Corp. in an antitrust case.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 26.05
to 692.66 for its largest gain since Oct. 9, and its eighth
biggest ever.
Big Board volume hit 32.13 million shares, shattering the
oil record of 31.73 million set Aug. 16,1971.

visit to France yesterday, seeking jet planes and tanks and a
European role in Mideast peacemaking.
Sadat, on his first excursion into the Western world since
taking office over four years ago, was greeted at Orly
Airport by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and his wife.
Police sharpshooters stood on roofs ajoining the VIP
lounge and plain-clothesmen almost outnumbered officials.
The ceremonies took place less than half a mile from where
Arab gunmen twice tried to blow up Israeli airliners within
the past two weeks.
Sadat condemned the attacks and said they were aimed
against his search for a political settlement in the Mideast.
A gusty, rain-lashed day forced cancellation of a
helicopter ride into the city and the two presidents
switched to a motorcade. Riot police were stationed every
90 feet on the 10-mile run into Paris.
Union Officials End Rail Strike
CHICAGO Officials of shopcraft unions called an end

to a brief strike against railroads in the Midwest, Northwest
and South yesterday after a court order was issued sending
employees back to work.
Strikes were calk.' at midnight Sunday against the
Burlington Northern, Chesapeake & Ohio and Louisville &
Nashville systems by four craft unions in apparent protest
over the lack of a contract with the railroads.
A Burlington spokesman said national negotiations,
currently under way in Washington, over wage increases
may have been a cause of the walkout, but none of the
union leaders would give a specific reason for the strike.
U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Sam Perry issued a
restraining order in Chicago calling for an end to the
walkout. The order is effective until 6 p.m. Feb. 5, and a
hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. Feb. 3.
The Burlington Northern line that serves about 23,000
commuters from Chicago's western suburbs was shut down
temporarily but was back in service by midmorning
yesterday, officials said.
Auto Antipollution Devices Polluting?
WASHINGTON The Environmental Protection
Agency reported yesterday that the antipollution devices
adopted by the auto industry may be creating a new health
hazard more serious than the one they were designed to
correct.
A tentative scientific study was released by EPA at a
press conference, with the warning that its preliminary
conclusions could be changed by further study.
But the report cast doubt on the present direction taken
by the auto industry using catalytic converters to meet
federal limits on emissions of carbon monoxide,
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.
Oil Union Settles More Contracts
DENVER The oil workers union said yesterday it had
settled contracts with Standard of Ohio, Marathon and
Crown Central covering about 1450 workers.
The union said the settlement with Standard of Ohio did
not include a refinery at Toledo, Ohio, where about 400
workers walked out over local issues earlier.
The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International
Union said the settlements with the three oil companies
matched the pattern settlement reached earlier with several
oil companies.
It calls for a 26.8 percent wage hike over two years with
a wage reopener clause if the National Consumer Index rises
more than five percent in the first year of the pact. Oil
workers made about $5.95 an hour under the old contract.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except partly cloudy for a time
tomorrow. Continued cool. Low both nights in low 30s to
low 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in 50s. Northwesterly
wind 10 to 20 mph except small craft advisory Suisun Bay
and West Delta for 15 to 35 mph.
Stock Market Jumps 26 Points
NEW YORK The stock market roared ahead yesterday
in a binge of buying that produced the heaviest activity in
New York Stock Exchange history.
Brokers gave a large part of the credit to falling interest
rates and a jubilant welcome on Wall Street to a federal
appeals court's ruling in favor of International Business
Machines Corp. in an antitrust case.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 26.05
to 692.66 for its largest gain since Oct. 9, and its eighth
biggest ever.
Big Board volume hit 32.13 million shares, shattering the
oil record of 31.73 million set Aug. 16,1971.
Tho Denounces U.S. 'lntimidation'
SAIGON Le Due Tho, who signed the Vietnamese
cease-fire agreement with Henry A. Kissinger two years ago,
charged the Ford administration yesterday with "giving a
new path to the war" by urging additional military aid for
the Saigon government.
In military action, Communist and government troops
clashed along the Cambodian border 55 miles west of
Saigon. The Saigon command said 41 North Vietnamese
and six government troops were killed, and two A37
bombers were shot down.
Speaking on North Vietnamese television to mark the
second anniversary of the accord, Tho said the Ford
administration was attempting to intimidate the
Vietnamese people through military aid to South Vietnam
and by "sending aircraft carriers and warships to the South
Vietnamese territorial waters and putting U.S. troops
stationed in Okinawa on alert."
"All these threats are of no avail to the Vietnamese
people," Tho said. He said South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu must be overthrown because he has
"scrapped" the Paris agreement.
