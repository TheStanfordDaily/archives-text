CORRECTIONS
The panel which considered
granting tenure to Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish was the
Committee on Appointments and
Promotions, not the Advancement and
Placement Committee as reported in
yesterday's Daily.
In addition to those Hospital
employees discussed in yesterday's
article on the union representative
election scheduled for April 10, 11
and 12, about 360 interns and
residents at the Hospital will choose
between the Stanford University
House Staff Association and no-union.
This is the only one of the six
representation elections in which
United Stanford Employees is not
competing.
