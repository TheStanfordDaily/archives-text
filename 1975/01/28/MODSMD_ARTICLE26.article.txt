# Smith Elected Editor
## 
### 
Kevin Smith, 20, a senior political
science major from Philadelphia,
yesterday was elected editor of the
Daily for Volume 167. Smith's term
begins Feb. 3 and runs through spring
quarter.
Smith, who has served as a reporter,
opinions editor and news editor in his
four years on the Daily, said last night
that "the main thing I'd like to stress
is accessibility. I'll be available to talk
with anyone on the staff at all times,
and I hope to consult with as many
people as possible before making
major decisions."
Smith also encouraged those who
feel the Daily has been missing
significant areas of news coverage to
"feel free to contact me and I'll be

more than happy to discuss our
coverage and possible changes."
Admitting that his Philadelphia
origins made him an underdog from
the start, Smith pointed to the Flyers'
Stanley Cup victory as a motivating
factor in his decision to seek the
editorship. "I have to admit that
Philadelphia has consistently produced
loser after loser after loser, but after
the Flyers won the Stanley Cup I
thought even a Philadelphian could
become editor of the Daily."
Smith, who worked as a reporting
intern last summer at the Arkansas
Gazette, will also become president of
The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation, the non-profit
corporation that publishes the paper.
