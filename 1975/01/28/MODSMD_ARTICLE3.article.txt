# Panel Speakers Deplore 'Post-War' Involvement

Six faculty members denounced
American involvement in the
"post-war war" in Vietnam in a panel
discussion last night at Cubberley
Auditorium.
The panelists, nine in all, took turns
exploring America's current role in
Vietnam on the second anniversary of
the signing of the Paris peace accord
that established conditions for a U.S.
military withdrawal.
The Cubberley "teach-in" climaxed
a day of fasting and vigil by Stanford
anti-war activists.
All the speakers agreed that the
U.S. is now violating the spirit of the
Paris accord by supporting Nguyen
Van Thieu's South Vietnamese regime,
and all supported Political Science
Prof. Charles Drekmeier's statement
that "only dissolution of the Thieu
government will provide the
opportunity for a peaceful solution"
in Vietnam.
"Peace is very important to the
Vietnamese people, but peace is still
not truly restored, because the U.S.
government is supporting the Thieu
regime to carry on the war," declared
Cao Thi Mai Loc, one of the panelists
and a Vietnamese citizen studying in
the U.S.
"The United States is upholding
intensified repression by the Thieu
government against all those who
oppose the war," she added.
"Students, intellectuals and religious
people are being constantly watched
by the Thieu regime."
'Worst Of Any'
French Prof. Raymond Giraud
described the South Vietnamese
government as "more dictatorial, more
massively oppressive and suppressive,
and more hated by its people" than
any other country's.
He said that one could look
"nostalgically" at the days when
Vietnam was a French colony, because
"even though destruction of the
country and repression of the people
were terrible in those days, they seem
infinitesimal compared with the things
that are happening there today."

Viewing the continuing activity of
the U.S. in the Vietnam conflict,
Giraud declared, "It would be absurd
to argue that the U.S. has not been
guilty of genocide."
'Just As Bad'
"It is just as bad for us to be egging
on one group of Asians to fight
another as it is for us to be going over
there and dying ourselves," stated
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake.
"That's something the American
public has to be more aware of."
He compared U.S. intervention in
Vietnam with recent suggestions by
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
that America might invade
oil-producing countries if they
threatened "strangulation" of
industrialized nations.
"We've got to realize that our only
options aren't strangulation or
warfare," said Drake. "The need is for
a reorganization of American society,
so that an adventure on the beaches of
the Middle East or an invasion of

Vietnam won't even be considered."
Economics Prof. John Gurley said
the United States' military actions in
Vietnam were "not mistakes, not
blunders, but basically a calculated
policy of U.S. imperialism.
"The foreign policy goals of the
U.S. have always, in the last century,
been to keep the world open for
profit-making by U.S. corporations,"
he added. "The 'Free World' is simply
that part open for economic
development by capitalist
corporations, no matter how
oppressive the governments may be."
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee
Brown, another of the panelists, said
that "acts of reconciliation" by the
U.S. people would be a necessary step
for bringing peace to Vietnam.
"Reconciliation will only happen to
the degree that those who inflicted the
damage seek forgiveness from those
they have harmed a forgiveness that
the Vietnamese may find very hard to
give."
