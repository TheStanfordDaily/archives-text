# Student Group Pushes Pro-SWOPSI Petition
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
A student coalition campaign to
"save" SWOPSI, SCIRE and Urban
Studies is emphasizing a petition drive
asking the University to retain the
three programs "as separate, individual
entities."
Distribution of the petitions began
last Wednesday, according to SWOPSI
Policy Board Chairman Chris Elms.
Circulation areas include classes,
student residences and White Plaza,
said Elms.
"The number of signatures is in the
hundreds by now," said Elms. "Dean
[of Undergraduate Studies James]
Gibbs has said student opinion is
important in this so I hope this will
have some effect."
But senior Mike Kieschnick, one
coalition organizer, claimed, "The

value of petitions at this point is not
the number of signatures but
educating people. The petitions alone
are more symbolic than effective."
Organization Sought
Kieschnick said he hopes that some
kind of organization will grow out of
coalition efforts to inform people of
the manner in which the programs are
being cut. "There is no institution that
is committed to defending programs
like SWOPSI," he said.
"The Dean of Undergraduate
Studies is the person you would
expect to defend something like this
but he hasn't."
But Gibbs said, "I haven't
recommended that workshops end. I
just recommend a cutback on
administrative cost . . . My
recommendations include continuing
all of the programs." They do so by
incorporation of the programs into
established University departments.
"I just don't know whether
anybody can stop the momentum of
Gibbs' proposal and budget cutting,"
said Elms.
'Overreaction'
Gibbs said some students are
reacting as if there will be no
workshops and looking at SWOPSI as a
symbol. "I hope people look more at
the functions of the workshops, not
the titles."
According to Gibbs, the functions
of the programs will be maintained. He
said he is presently attending and
organizing meetings "to discuss some
of the ways departments may absorb
SWOPSI workshops."
ASSU Senator Debbi Silton,
however, said, "Departments are
cutting 10 to 12 percent... if their
load is increased there will be no
incentive to be innovative."
Nevertheless, Gibbs said, "The
problem isn't really just one of
funding. It is one of reducing the
administrative staff needed for the
