David Harris, former ASSU
president and draft resistance leader,
was one of nine people arrested in
Saigon and deported to Bangkok,
Thailand, Friday night.
Harris, ex-husband of folk singer
Joan Baez, and the others were
deported for picketing the U.S.
Embassy in Saigon, a spokesman for
the Palo Alto-based Institute for
Non-Violence said. Student body
president here in 1966-67, Harris
co-founded the institute.
Kit Bricca of the institute said the
nine picketers had been passing out
leaflets for 6V2 hours. When they
returned to their lodgings, Saigon
police took them into custody, Bricca
said.
The leaflets that Harris and the
others passed out demanded the
"release of political prisoners" and an
"end" to U.S. "intervention" in South
Vietnam, Bricca said.
