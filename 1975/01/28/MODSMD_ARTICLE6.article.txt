## Goodell Defends Clemency Program 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The low response to President Ford's clemency
program for draft violators is attributable to
widespread ignorance about eligibility, according to
former Sen. Charles Goodell, chairman of the
Presidential Clemency Board.
In a Daily interview last week, Goodell said he is
"absolutely convinced that the overwhelming
majority of the 110,000 men convicted of desertion
or draft evasion during the Vietnam War simply
aren't aware that they might qualify for clemency.
"Most of the attention of the clemency board
has been directed at those 20,000 men who fled to
Canada or went underground during the war,"
Goodell added. "Not much attention has been
focused on the fact that more than 100,000 other
men who received draft convictions between 1964
and 1973 are also eligible for clemency."
Goodell noted that he and other board members
are currently barnstorming the nation in an attempt
to inform those men of their eligibility. Goodell was
in San Francisco last week.
Although the program will expire Jan. 31,
Goodell emphasized that he will urge the President
to extend the deadline when he meets with him this
week.
Favors Extension
Goodell said all board members favor extension
of the deadline, and that the President might agree
with them.
"But no one should count on it," Goodell added.

"We want to give the men with draft convictions
every opportunity to appeal to the clemency board
for a pardon," Goodell said. "It will be a very
meaningful thing to these individuals since many of
them cannot enter certain occupations with a bad
record. This is something that would really help
these guys."
Goodell expressed surprise that only a small
percentage of draft evaders eligible for the Justice
Department's earned re-entry program for
unconvicted draft evaders have registered.
Noting that only 300 out of an estimated 6200
eligible evaders have applied for the program,
Goodell claimed that most of them are living in
Canada and are satisfied with their lives there.
"There are a whole variety of reasons why the
men in Canada have shown little interest in
returning to the United States," Goodell said.
"Many of them have made new lives for themselves
in Canada and simply an't want to do the two
years of alternative service required under the plan."
More Successful
Goodell noted that the Defense Department's
program for unconvicted draft deserters has proven
more successful. About 40 percent of the men
eligible for the program have applied under it, he
said.
Goodell admitted that the men who receive
clemency must take an oath waiving certain
constitutional rights.
Everyone who receives clemency must agree

under oath to relinquish rights to a speedy trial and
waive rights against double jeopardy.
Facilitate Prosecution
Both provisions facilitate Justice Department
prosecution of those who don't fulfill the
mandatory two years of alternative service, Goodell
explained.
They enable the department to prosecute
defendants at its own pace and to prosecute them
both for draft violations and for failure to fulfill the
alternate service requirements, Goodell explained.
Goodell expressed full approval of the waivers,
claiming that the government has a right to
guarantee firm-handed punishment of those men
who violate what he termed the "generous"
clemency program.
'Most Extensive'
According to Goodell, Ford's program is one of
the most extensive clemency programs in American
history.
Goodell defended Ford's decision to grant
clemency on an individual basis rather than amnesty
to the entire mass of draft violators.
"Many people claim that amnesty was given to
all draft violators after the Civil War," Goodell said.
"But actually, amnesty was given only to the former
Confederates. Union soldiers were never granted
amnesty."
Goodell acknowledged that he has come under
heavy criticism by some anti-war activists for his
leadership of Ford's program.
Goodell said it is ironic that many
of the same people who admired his
anti-war stand in the late 1960s now
chide him for supporting a plan they
believe is unfair to men who refused to
fight.
Appointed in 1968 to fill the New
York Senate seat of the late Robert
Kennedy, Goodell was defeated for
election to a full term in 1970 after
Nixon and then-Vice President Spiro
Agnew vigorously attacked him for his
anti-war views.
"I believe that my well-known
opposition to the Vietnam War helps
to give credibility to the program,"
Goodell said. "It is a fair and a good
program, and even if only a few
thousand people take advantage of it,
we know that we are helping people in
a very substantial way."
