More On Parking

The University has still not satisfactorily justified its imposition of
a student parking fee, and the police have forced matters by issuing
tickets to those cars which do not display the $7.50 sticker.
The Daily believes that the best way to stop the University from
collecting its unwarranted tax is for each individual to fight any ticket
he or she receives as a result of not purchasing the sticker.
If every person who is ticketed would take the matter to Santa
Clara County Municipal Court instead of paying the fine, the resulting
backlog of cases would tie up the Stanford police so effectively that
they could simply not afford to keep issuing tickets.
Each time a case is brought to court, the arresting officer must
appear. If hundreds of persons fought their tickets, the relatively few
officers would spend all their time in court, ladening the entire
campus patrol system with an impossible burden.
We also support the idea of students, through the ASSU, filing a
class-action suit against the University. We feel, however, that the
most effective way to fight the parking fee is to paralyze the system
which imposes it.
Finally, we condone the practice of students taking their tickets to
the ASSU. In this way, maximum publicity and a feeling of solidarity
can be generated.
We do not, however, believe persons should steal parking tickets
from other cars. This constitutes theft, and more importantly, denies
the individual the right to do what he or she chooses with the tickets
be that pay it, fight it or ignore it and risk arrest.

Financial Aid Equity

We support the "Draft Report on Minority Financial Aid
Packaging," which calls for equal treatment in financial aid decisions
for all students from low income families, regardless of race.
The report, drafted by Financial Aids Director Robert Fluff, Dean
of Admissions Fred Hargadon and Biology Prof. Paul Green, chairman
of the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA), recommends that all students from low income families
seeking financial aid provide $7OO in self help, either through loans or
assigned jobs. Previously, minority students were exempt from the
self-help requirement.
We recognize the need for increased minority enrollment, and for
increased enrollment from all low income groups. But we also
recognize the need for equity in financial aid decisions and support
the proposed procedures.
