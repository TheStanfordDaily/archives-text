### William Massy 
Susan Luttner's article (Daily,
Jan. 17), reviewed the history of
CIA research at Stanford and
"raised the question of whether
such research might be going on at
the present time. This in turn was
triggered by a report that Prof.
Daryl Bern of the Psychology
Department recently turned down
the opportunity to submit a
proposal for research in
handwriting analysis to the
Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA).
The policies under which we
operate with respect to questions
like this may be of interest to the
University community.
First, there is the "Policy
Guidelines on Secrecy in
Research" adopted by the Senate
of the Academic Couhcil on April
24, 1969. This policy prohibits
classified research at Stanford.
Furthermore, it provides that no
grant or contract shall be accepted
that restrains the freedom of the
University to disclose the
existence of the research project
or the identity of the sponsoring
agency.

These policies are adhered to
vigorously. While it is impossible
to guarantee that none of the
1300-plus contract and grant
proposals forwarded by the
University each year would be
funded indirectly by the CIA or
any other given agency, we are
alert to any evidence of
disingenuousness and are prepared
to follow up and take appropriate

action. I might add that in the
recent case involving Bern, the
CIA made absolutely no effort to
conceal its potential
sponsorship of the project.
A second policy relevant in this
case is the "Statement of
Principles Concerning Research,"
passed by the Senate on Dec. 16,
1971. The statement affirms that
the individual scholar should be
free to select the subject matter of
his or her research, to seek
support from any source for the
work, and to form his or her own
findings and conclusions.
Thus the decision as to
whether to accept research funds
from any particular agency rests
with the principal investigator.
While he or she may seek advice
from colleagues, students or even
the University administration, it
would be an infringement of
academic freedom for any of
these groups to attempt to take
the decision out of the principal
investigator's hands.

The above policies were arrived
at after deep thought and
considerable discussion. I believe
in them personally and I think
this view is shared by most at
Stanford. In my judgment the
recent decision by Bern, and the
process by which he reached it,
were completely in accord with
both the letter and the spirit of
these principles.

University each year would be
funded indirectly by the CIA or
any other given agency, we are
alert to any evidence of
disingenuousness and are prepared
to follow up and take appropriate

action. I might add that in the
recent case involving Bern, the
CIA made absolutely no effort to
conceal its potential
sponsorship of the project.
A second policy relevant in this
case is the "Statement of
Principles Concerning Research,"
passed by the Senate on Dec. 16,
1971. The statement affirms that
the individual scholar should be
free to select the subject matter of
his or her research, to seek
support from any source for the
work, and to form his or her own
findings and conclusions.
Thus the decision as to
whether to accept research funds
from any particular agency rests
with the principal investigator.
While he or she may seek advice
from colleagues, students or even
the University administration, it
would be an infringement of
academic freedom for any of
these groups to attempt to take
the decision out of the principal
investigator's hands.

The above policies were arrived
at after deep thought and
considerable discussion. I believe
in them personally and I think
this view is shared by most at
Stanford. In my judgment the
recent decision by Bern, and the
process by which he reached it,
were completely in accord with
both the letter and the spirit of
these principles.

Susan Luttner's article (Daily,
Jan. 17), reviewed the history of
CIA research at Stanford and
"raised the question of whether
such research might be going on at
the present time. This in turn was
triggered by a report that Prof.
Daryl Bern of the Psychology
Department recently turned down
the opportunity to submit a
proposal for research in
handwriting analysis to the
Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA).
The policies under which we
operate with respect to questions
like this may be of interest to the
University community.
First, there is the "Policy
Guidelines on Secrecy in
Research" adopted by the Senate
of the Academic Couhcil on April
24, 1969. This policy prohibits
classified research at Stanford.
Furthermore, it provides that no
grant or contract shall be accepted
that restrains the freedom of the
University to disclose the
existence of the research project
or the identity of the sponsoring
agency.

These policies are adhered to
vigorously. While it is impossible
to guarantee that none of the
1300-plus contract and grant
proposals forwarded by the
University each year would be
funded indirectly by the CIA or
any other given agency, we are
alert to any evidence of
disingenuousness and are prepared
to follow up and take appropriate

action. I might add that in the
recent case involving Bern, the
CIA made absolutely no effort to
conceal its potential
sponsorship of the project.
