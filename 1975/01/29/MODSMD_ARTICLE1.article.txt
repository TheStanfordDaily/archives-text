# Star Trek Creator Draws Thousands To Mem Aud
## Bomb Scare Interrupts Trekkies Dreams 
### JOAN E. HINMAN TERRY ANZUR 
"The greatest hunger in this world is for images of
integrity we can emulate," said Gene Roddenberry,
executive producer of Star Trek, explaining the mass appeal
of his creation before 2000 fans who packed Memorial
Auditorium last night. .
The 2000 who greeted Roddenberry with a standing
ovation and Vulcan salutes were forced to clear the hall at
8:45 p.m. after a bomb threat was phoned in to KZSU.
"Some joker has called in a bomb threat," announced
ASSU speakers bureau chairman Andy Leuchter. "Don't
panic."
Attempting to calm the disgruntled audience,
Roddenberry told the crowd, "Don't let the Klingons have
a laugh on us," and, commenting on a recent leg injury,
joked, "I'll rest my leg and drink some bourbon while you
bums stay out in the cold."
According to Asst. Fire Chief Frank Stolarik, the
evacuation proceeded without incident. "We didn't take it
as a prank," he said. "We kept the building cleared for
about 30 minutes. That is usual procedure."
While the capacity crowd was kept outside,
Roddenberry and 20 students chatted casually in a
backstage lounge.
"I didn't know where he went," Stolarik said of the
failure to evacuate Roddenberry. "We saw him disappear
and we were concerned about evacuating the main hall

itself. The scare we got referred to the main theater."
Whether or not Roddenberry and the students who
stayed with him were in danger "depended on where a
bomb was placed and how big a bomb it was," said
Stolarik.
Asked why Roddenberry hadn't been asked to leave the
auditorium, Leuchter said, "It was overlooked. I realized he
was in the green room at about five minutes after nine. By
that time the danger was over."
Roddenberry, who has never spoken before a less than
capacity crowd at a university, felt the bomb threat was
due to the more than 300 people turned away at the door.
"It happened at the University of Utah, too," he said.
"People were disgruntled, they had to turn too many
people away."
A bomb squad found nothing, and the audience returned
to the hall at about 9:35 p.m.
For the Trekkies who squeezed into Mem Aud,
Roddenberry offered both comedy and philosophy which
no mere Klingon bomb plot could foil.
Beginning with a reel of bloopers composed of cast
mistakes and pranks from all three Star Trek seasons,
Roddenberry explained his animosity toward both the NBC
executives responsible for Star Trek going off the air and
toward commercial television generally.
"These blooper reels used to be shown at the annual Star
Trek Christmas party.... We used to have a prayer that

we'd say every Christmas that
someday there would be a real United
Starship Enterprise, and that its
photon torpedoes would score a direct
hit on NBC.
"We have now learned quite a bit
and realize that it would have to hit all
three networks.
"Commercial television is not
designed to entertain you," criticized
Roddenberry. "The purpose is not to
inform you. It is a commercial
medium," in which what shows are
produced is decided according to
"what will sell toothpaste."
Despite Paramount Studios' long
opposition to pleas from Trekkies to
revive the series, Roddenberry
announced amid thunderous applause
that he has entered negotiations with
the studio to produce a feature length
film of Star Trek with the original cast
to be finished by spring of 1976.
Tracing the enduring appeal of the
show to "the things it tried to say,"
Roddenberry summed up the show's
message:
"First, it was trying to say
humanity will reach maturity on the
day we learn to value
diversity. ... Second, it was a
statement of affection and optimism
for living things."

MEM AUD JAMMED An estimated 300 people were turned away from Star Trek executive producer Gene
Roddenberry's speech last night in Memorial Auditorium. The 2000 lucky Trekkies who made it inside were forced to
evacuate the Auditorium though, as police cleared the hall and searched for a bomb. No bomb was found and the speech
resumed without incident.
we'd say every Christmas that
someday there would be a real United
Starship Enterprise, and that its
photon torpedoes would score a direct
hit on NBC.
"We have now learned quite a bit
and realize that it would have to hit all
three networks.
"Commercial television is not
designed to entertain you," criticized
Roddenberry. "The purpose is not to
inform you. It is a commercial
medium," in which what shows are
produced is decided according to
"what will sell toothpaste."
Despite Paramount Studios' long
opposition to pleas from Trekkies to
revive the series, Roddenberry
announced amid thunderous applause
that he has entered negotiations with
the studio to produce a feature length
film of Star Trek with the original cast
to be finished by spring of 1976.
Tracing the enduring appeal of the
show to "the things it tried to say,"
Roddenberry summed up the show's
message:
"First, it was trying to say
humanity will reach maturity on the
day we learn to value
diversity. ... Second, it was a
statement of affection and optimism
for living things."
"The greatest hunger in this world is for images of
integrity we can emulate," said Gene Roddenberry,
executive producer of Star Trek, explaining the mass appeal
of his creation before 2000 fans who packed Memorial
Auditorium last night. .
The 2000 who greeted Roddenberry with a standing
ovation and Vulcan salutes were forced to clear the hall at
8:45 p.m. after a bomb threat was phoned in to KZSU.
"Some joker has called in a bomb threat," announced
ASSU speakers bureau chairman Andy Leuchter. "Don't
panic."
Attempting to calm the disgruntled audience,
Roddenberry told the crowd, "Don't let the Klingons have
a laugh on us," and, commenting on a recent leg injury,
joked, "I'll rest my leg and drink some bourbon while you
bums stay out in the cold."
According to Asst. Fire Chief Frank Stolarik, the
evacuation proceeded without incident. "We didn't take it
as a prank," he said. "We kept the building cleared for
about 30 minutes. That is usual procedure."
While the capacity crowd was kept outside,
Roddenberry and 20 students chatted casually in a
backstage lounge.
"I didn't know where he went," Stolarik said of the
failure to evacuate Roddenberry. "We saw him disappear
and we were concerned about evacuating the main hall

itself. The scare we got referred to the main theater."
Whether or not Roddenberry and the students who
stayed with him were in danger "depended on where a
bomb was placed and how big a bomb it was," said
Stolarik.
Asked why Roddenberry hadn't been asked to leave the
auditorium, Leuchter said, "It was overlooked. I realized he
was in the green room at about five minutes after nine. By
that time the danger was over."
Roddenberry, who has never spoken before a less than
capacity crowd at a university, felt the bomb threat was
due to the more than 300 people turned away at the door.
"It happened at the University of Utah, too," he said.
"People were disgruntled, they had to turn too many
people away."
A bomb squad found nothing, and the audience returned
to the hall at about 9:35 p.m.
For the Trekkies who squeezed into Mem Aud,
Roddenberry offered both comedy and philosophy which
no mere Klingon bomb plot could foil.
Beginning with a reel of bloopers composed of cast
mistakes and pranks from all three Star Trek seasons,
Roddenberry explained his animosity toward both the NBC
executives responsible for Star Trek going off the air and
toward commercial television generally.
"These blooper reels used to be shown at the annual Star
Trek Christmas party.... We used to have a prayer that
