# Eliminate Free' Medical Services
## 
### William Ross 
Despite recent uproars over tuition
increase and the new parking fees, few if
any students have raised objections to
another heavy financial burden the
arbitrarily imposed cost of the student health
service.
Each quarter, $4O of almost every
student's tuition is allocated to Cowell
Health Center. Since student use of this
facility varies widely, it seems grossly unfair
to charge students for a service many of us
never use.
According to James McClenahan, Co well's
director, no statistics have yet been compiled
on how many students use the center. In a
Daily interview last week, McClenahan could
only say that 60,000 visits to Cowell each
year are made among the University's 12,000
students.
Services vary from consultation on colds
to minor operations at outpatient clinics; the
bills are all paid by Stanford students.
McClenahan favors the existing sytem,
drawing an analogy to insurance. He claims
that it protects students from high bills in
time of medical emergencies.
Differs From Insurance
But Cowell's system of finance differs
from insurance in a crucial way: an individual
who seeks insurance can choose whether he
wants to buy a policy. Stanford students are
given virtually no choice.
Technically, a student can receive an
exemption from the service. But only four or
five students each year take advantage of this
obscure privilege. Most students accept the
automatic fees either because they don't

know how much they're paying or because
they are ignorant of the exemption
provisions.
For those so-called liberals who might
equate the University's health system with
national health insurance, I must point out
that they aren't analogous. One can in good
conscience support national health insurance
even socialized medicine without
defending Cowell's absorption of tuition.
The difference between the two is that in
the absence of national insurance, many
Americans are suffering from lack of proper
medical care. No Stanford student would go
without medical care if forced to pay fees at
Cowell.
Can All Afford It?
McClenahan, however, argues that the
student health service should remain free for
the benefit of those students who can't
afford to pay their bills. He claims that some
students would avoid needed medical services
if Cowell charged fees.
But I find it hard to believe that people
who can pay thousands of dollars a year in
tuition can't find a few dollars to pay to fix a
sprained arm. For those few students who are
actually penurious, the University could set
up some sort of special aid fund that
wouldn't cost very much.
Supporters of the current health service
system also claim that the discounts received
by Cowell since it charges no fees
provides students with an aggregate financial
advantage. While this is probably true in the
most literal sense, it also represents the
fallacy of composition. Individually, many

students lose money through the current
system.
For example, McClenahan pointed out
that a limited number of psychological
counselling sessions are available to all
students. But only seven percent of all
students use this service each year, so the
remainder of the student body is forced to
pay for costly services that it doesn't use.
Easily Eliminated?
Finally, by adding $l2O or about three
percent in annual tuition fees to pay for
Cowell the University is hindering its own
efforts to attract qualified students.
Embarrassed already by skyrocketing tuition
rates, the University adds a cost to the bill
that easily could be eliminated.
I doubt if free medical care convinces any
otherwise undecided student to attend
Stanford most potential students are
probably unaware of this costly amenity. But
the extra three percent in tuition just might
prove the deciding factor in persuading some
people on a tight budget not to attend
Stanford.
Considering the rapidly rising rates of
Stanford tuition, Cowell's free services
impose an onerous and clearly inequitable
burden on students. Hopefully, those
students who either don't use the service or
use it but recognize its inherent unfairness
will awake from their acquiescence and
demand that the University reconsider its
policy.
