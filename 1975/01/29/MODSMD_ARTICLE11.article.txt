# U.S. Undermining Paris Agreement
## 
### Paul Framson 
"Mr. , resident at house
number , hamlet,
village,
prefecture, is cordially invited to
meet the assistant chief of An
Ninh hamlet at Ban Tri Su Ap
office, at 12 o'clock in the
afternoon on April 14, 1973.
REASON: to greet the President
of the Republic of Vietnam on his
return from abroad. If you are
absent, we beg to temporarily
keep your identity card.
â€”Assistant Chief An Ninh Hamlet,
Streangely, this invitation
contains no RSVP clause. Under
the Thieu regime all South
Vietnamese citizens over age 15
must carry a computerized ID
card. If caught without it, one is
arrested and subject to
imprisonment. By law one can be
imprisoned two years without
reason and this period is
renewable.
The Paris Peace Agreement
prescribes humane treatment of
all civilian prisoners and release
without delay. However, at
interrogation centers police have
forced students to witness
electro-torture of their friends to
secure an admission that they are
communists.
The Paris Peace Agreement
guarantees to Vietnamese of all
political persuasions democratic
freedoms similar to the Bill of
Rights. Three political elements
are relegated the responsibilities
of forming a coalition
government: the Provisional
Revolutionary Government
(PRG), the Republic of Vietnam
(Thieu) and the neutralist Third
Force.
However, Thieu dictates, "Be
resolute in chopping up all the
tricky communists ... the
communists are trying their best
to create a second administration
in South Vietnam and to demand
political freedoms."

Furthermore, one who
"commits acts for and incitement
of neutralism" is considered
"procommunist neutralist" and
may be imprisoned. One to two
hundred newspapers and
magazines have been shut down
for ideological divergence from
Thieu.
The Paris Agreement prescribes
dismantlement of all U.S military
bases and removal of all U.S.
military personnel and advisors;
furthermore, the Vietnamese can
accept only piece-by-piece
replacement of damaged military
equipment.
However, shortly before the
Agreement took effect, the U.S.
handed all its operational bases to
Thieu, boosted his air force to the
world's fourth largest, and has
since modernized it. The U.S.
maintains a civilian force of
several thousand Americans, many
of whom merely exchanged their
military uniforms for others that
bear slogans like "Management
Services, Inc." Our CIA presence
is estimated at 400 men and we
have begun reconnaisance flights
over North Vietnam.
The Paris Agreement prohbits
foreign countries form imposing
any "political tendency or
personality on the South
Vietnamese people." Norton
Halperin, former member of the
National Security Council,
predicts "the consequences of
that [phaseout of aid to Thieu]
would be the beginning of
negotiations among the political
groups in the South which would
be the first to form some sort of
coalition government. I suspect a
number of the current rulers in
South Vietnam would move to
the Riviera and you would get a
new Government."

American civilian technicians

Thieu would fall in one to three
weeks without their expertise.
Clearly Thieu is our puppet; we
fund 86 percent of his budget. His
inhumanities and violations of the
Paris Agreement are ours. We have
violated in letter and spirit the
Paris Peace Agreement since its
inception.
About a week and a half ago,
Secretary of Defense Schlesinger
announced that we are now free
to breach the Peace Agreement
because the other side has. Surely
he knows it is a crime to publish
the Agreement in Saigon while in
the North and in PRG controlled
areas texts of the agreement are
displayed along public
thoroughfares.
The people who conduct our
foreign policy are deceiving us.

Fortunately Congress is
awakening. It has slashed one half
(or $2.5 billion) from
Administration requests for aid to
Thieu during fiscal years 1974-75.
However, the Ford
Administration has requested
$3OO million in supplemental aid
to Thieu for the remainder of
fiscal year 1974."
Congressmen have never before
felt more powerful yet been so
responsive to public demand.
Write them, especially home
congressmen in other districts and
states, requesting rejection of the
$3OO million request and all further
aid to Thieu.
