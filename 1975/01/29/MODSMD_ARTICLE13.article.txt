# Subtle Soccer Sexism
## 
### Allison Brown 
It is hard enough for women to
succeed in traditionally male
situations, but it is even harder
with sexist publicity such as that
offered by Pete Bhatia (Daily,
Jan. 24) concerning the women's
soccer team.
In order to set the record
straight, we feel it is necessary to
elaborate on the circumstances.
Bhatia is surprised at the
participation of women in the
"unlikely" sport of soccer.
Although women have been
socialized by a male-dominated
society to refrain from rough
sports such as soccer, a growing
number of women at Stanford
and elsewhere are trying to combat
these societal pressures in order to
participate in one of the most
fast-moving and fun sports offered
in the intramural program.
It isn't unlikely that women
should want to take part; nor is it
strange that they are physically
capable of playing.
Many of the women on the
team never played soccer before.
They knew only that being on an
all-woman team would given them
the opportunity to learn, play,
have fun and exercise, whereas on
the other predominantly male IM
teams, the competition would be
too great, most men having
participated in sports such as
soccer most of their lives. Since
last quarter, our roster has grown
from three or four, to over 35
women seriously interested in
playing soccer.
Despite our limited experience,
we all came together and played a
good game. Bhatia, by saying that
the men on the El Tigre team
played "quite gentlemanly,"
seems to imply that they played
differently against us than they
would have against a male team.
'Provided Competition'
He wasn't even at the game,
and I think any El Tigre player
will agree that we provided some
competition and they had to work
as hard as they would had our
team been predominantly male.
When comparing our score (3-0)
to some of the other IM scores
(the Zetes lost 12-0 and the Ski
Team lost 6-0), we made a
remarkable showing one of
which we are proud.
We are also working for
something else. Right now,
Stanford offers nothing for
women in the sport of soccer,
with the exception of a mostly
male soccer class. There is no club
team and there are no intramural
leagues.
By forming a team and
spending up to five hours per
week practicing and playing, we
can show the University that there
are women interested in playing
soccer, and we are not willing to
put aside our desires and abilities
for a more traditionally female
sport. In addition to the IM team,
next year, hopefully, we can start
and all-female class and/or a club
team.

Bhatia should have recognized
that we are a serious IM team and
our games should be covered as
real sports events, not as novelties.
He neglected to research and
present properly any pertinent
information regarding our team,
as an objective journalist should.
The Daily has only reinforced our
opinion that it has an appalling
sexist bias and we hope, in the
future, that women's sports and
women's issues in general, get the
unprejudiced coverage they
deserve.

something else. Right now,
Stanford offers nothing for
women in the sport of soccer,
with the exception of a mostly
male soccer class. There is no club
team and there are no intramural
leagues.
By forming a team and
spending up to five hours per
week practicing and playing, we
can show the University that there
are women interested in playing
soccer, and we are not willing to
put aside our desires and abilities
for a more traditionally female
sport. In addition to the IM team,
next year, hopefully, we can start
and all-female class and/or a club
team.

Bhatia should have recognized
that we are a serious IM team and
our games should be covered as
real sports events, not as novelties.
He neglected to research and
present properly any pertinent
information regarding our team,
as an objective journalist should.
The Daily has only reinforced our
opinion that it has an appalling
sexist bias and we hope, in the
future, that women's sports and
women's issues in general, get the
unprejudiced coverage they
deserve.

It is hard enough for women to
succeed in traditionally male
situations, but it is even harder
with sexist publicity such as that
offered by Pete Bhatia (Daily,
Jan. 24) concerning the women's
soccer team.
In order to set the record
straight, we feel it is necessary to
elaborate on the circumstances.
Bhatia is surprised at the
participation of women in the
"unlikely" sport of soccer.
Although women have been
socialized by a male-dominated
society to refrain from rough
sports such as soccer, a growing
number of women at Stanford
and elsewhere are trying to combat
these societal pressures in order to
participate in one of the most
fast-moving and fun sports offered
in the intramural program.
It isn't unlikely that women
should want to take part; nor is it
strange that they are physically
capable of playing.
Many of the women on the
team never played soccer before.
They knew only that being on an
all-woman team would given them
the opportunity to learn, play,
have fun and exercise, whereas on
the other predominantly male IM
teams, the competition would be
too great, most men having
participated in sports such as
soccer most of their lives. Since
last quarter, our roster has grown
from three or four, to over 35
women seriously interested in
playing soccer.
Despite our limited experience,
we all came together and played a
good game. Bhatia, by saying that
the men on the El Tigre team
played "quite gentlemanly,"
seems to imply that they played
differently against us than they
would have against a male team.
'Provided Competition'
He wasn't even at the game,
and I think any El Tigre player
will agree that we provided some
competition and they had to work
as hard as they would had our
team been predominantly male.
When comparing our score (3-0)
to some of the other IM scores
(the Zetes lost 12-0 and the Ski
Team lost 6-0), we made a
remarkable showing one of
which we are proud.
We are also working for
something else. Right now,
