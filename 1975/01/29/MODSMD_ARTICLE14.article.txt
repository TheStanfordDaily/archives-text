# Keio Exchange Students Visit 'Japanese Stanford'
## 
### PAIGE CHERNO 
Although her friends always wanted to
head off for Europe, senior Phyllis Ayer
always wanted to go the other way." So she
and eight other Stanford students boarded a
plane last July and headed west for seven
weeks in Japan.
Since 1956, Stanford has participated in an
exchange program with Japan's Keio
University. In the spring 12 Keio students
spend two months in the Stanford area, living
with host families half of the time and if
housing is available on campus the other
half
In return, the Keio students find host
families (usually their own families) for 12
Stanford students, who spend the following
summer in Japan.
Senior Steve Sakahara heads the Keio
Committee, the student-run group that
organizes the exchange. He says the
committee has no staff sponsor and "no
formal ties with the University, but it works
within the University system." It operates
under the auspices of the ASSU. Most
committee are past participants in the
exchange program.
Members of Keio's chapter of the Institute
for International Relations (IIR) run the
program there. Because students run the
program, Sakahara said, they can avoid messy
bureaucracy and red tape. "You just come
over here and have fun or go over there and
have fun. You have fun while you're learning

things; that's the whole key."
It's cultural exchange, Sakahara said. In
other words, students do not go to Japan and
lock themselves up in classrooms or libraries.
Sakahara added, "There isn't enough time
to go over there, see Japan, and study at the
same time."
The Stanford students, who chose to see
Japan, could not help but learn some Japanese
while staying with their host families. There is
no language requirement for the Stanford
students, but most have studies some Japanese
before they go to Japan. The Keio students
take an English examination before coming
her 6' Language Laughs
Her host parents did not speak English.
"We would say the stupidest things to each
other without knowing it. And then we'd find
out in the end that we just blew it and we'd
laugh. We laughed a lot."
Pam Mikuni's host parents did not speak
English either. "I didn't use my Japanese for
the first two weeks I was there. But I found
that even before I actually got enough nerve
up to start talking one-to-one, I could still get
through."
In most of the host families the fathers
were businessmen, the mothers housewives.
All but one student lived in a family with a
Keio "brother" or "sister." But their
experiences were quite different.
Mikuni said her family pampered her. "I
never touched a washing machine for eight

weeks. My host mother would not let me do
my laundry. She did it all for me. My t-shirts
came back ironed. It was just incredible."
Freedom And Friendship
Verna Abe's family was different: "My family
gave me almost total independence. They said,
'Here's how you get to and from the house.
This door's always unlocked. So whatever
time you get in, just come in.' "
Sakahara said the people he met were
"super-nice. Let's put in this way. If you left
your purse in a train or subway station, you'd
get it back."
Mikuni added, "I would have a tendency to
think that in a place that crowded, people
would be very indifferent. But if you're lost,
you can ask someone and people are really
friendly. They'll show you around.
Steve Ando said, "Keio students just come
up to you and introduce themselves. They
say, 'I hear you're a foreign exchange student.
My name's so-and-so.' And then they hand
you their card."
Each student had more to do with his
family and Keio brother or sister than with
what Sakahara called the "Japanese
Stanford."
On The Move
But even though Keio was not in session, it
sponsored a full schedule of activities: tours,
trips, and get-togethers. Ayer said, "You
could either go through the structured
program or take off every now and then and
just do what you wanted to."

The Stanford students sometimes gathered
from their homes all over Tokyo to shop, go
to special events, or to eat out.
"You're not a flunky tourist, because you
go over there and you have so many contacts,
so many ins with students and families,"
Sakahara said.
The Keio students find inexpensive places
where Stanford students can stay while
traveling.
Sakahara: "You can stay in a place a
good place for two dollars a night and get
breakfast, dinner, and a hot bath."
Abe: "As long as you do it Japanese style."
Mikuni: "I spent less than $3OO in eight
weeks and I literally traveled all over Japan."
Unforgettable Sights
Sakahara added that Mikuni had an
unusually generous host family. They took
her on lots of trips.
Mikuni: "My sister took me to the peace
memorial in Hiroshima. In the museum, there
are remains of charred teapots and clothes
from people who were destroyed. It's hard to
describe what it felt like to be an American
and to walk through that, especially with my
Japanese sister."
Curiosity about things like Hiroshima
attracted the students to the program.
Ando: "My pressing concern was learning
something about my culture, my heritage."
Abe, Mikuni, and Sakahara agreed.
Abe: "I was just kind of curious to see
what it's like. You've heard about it, seen

pictures, all the people look something like
you and you're kind of curious to see what
it's like."
Ayer, the only Caucasian, had lived on a
military base near Tokyo for three years. She
thought it was a "far-out place," and wanted
to return.
Many other things made an impression on
the travelers.
Sakahara: "Culture shock comes byway of
environmental shock. When you walk down
the street, everything is a hell of a lot smaller.
It's like everything is on a smaller scale cars,
houses, streets, you name it. There's a real
economization of space. You drive down a
street and sometimes you only have four
inches on either side of a Toyota.
Mikuni: "People drilled into me before I
left, 'lt's crowded, it's crowded, it's crowded.
It's really crowded.' So I went over expecting
it to be and it is. If I had never heard any of
that and just walked into all those people ..."
Western influence interested and troubled
the Americans. Abe was surprised to find as
much European influence in Japan as
American, especially in fashion.
And Sakahara was disappointed to find so
much western influence in general.
"One thing that I didn't like is that there's
a prevalent attitude that in order to become
modernized, you have to become westernized.
I'd really like to see Japan maintain its own
individuality and its own culture."

could either go through the structured
program or take off every now and then and
just do what you wanted to."

The Stanford students sometimes gathered
from their homes all over Tokyo to shop, go
to special events, or to eat out.
"You're not a flunky tourist, because you
go over there and you have so many contacts,
so many ins with students and families,"
Sakahara said.
The Keio students find inexpensive places
where Stanford students can stay while
traveling.
Sakahara: "You can stay in a place a
good place for two dollars a night and get
breakfast, dinner, and a hot bath."
Abe: "As long as you do it Japanese style."
Mikuni: "I spent less than $3OO in eight
weeks and I literally traveled all over Japan."
Unforgettable Sights
Sakahara added that Mikuni had an
unusually generous host family. They took
her on lots of trips.
Mikuni: "My sister took me to the peace
memorial in Hiroshima. In the museum, there
are remains of charred teapots and clothes
from people who were destroyed. It's hard to
describe what it felt like to be an American
and to walk through that, especially with my
Japanese sister."
Curiosity about things like Hiroshima
attracted the students to the program.
Ando: "My pressing concern was learning
something about my culture, my heritage."
Abe, Mikuni, and Sakahara agreed.
Abe: "I was just kind of curious to see
what it's like. You've heard about it, seen

pictures, all the people look something like
you and you're kind of curious to see what
it's like."
Ayer, the only Caucasian, had lived on a
military base near Tokyo for three years. She
thought it was a "far-out place," and wanted
to return.
Many other things made an impression on
the travelers.
Sakahara: "Culture shock comes byway of
environmental shock. When you walk down
the street, everything is a hell of a lot smaller.
It's like everything is on a smaller scale cars,
houses, streets, you name it. There's a real
economization of space. You drive down a
street and sometimes you only have four
inches on either side of a Toyota.
Mikuni: "People drilled into me before I
left, 'lt's crowded, it's crowded, it's crowded.
It's really crowded.' So I went over expecting
it to be and it is. If I had never heard any of
that and just walked into all those people ..."
Western influence interested and troubled
the Americans. Abe was surprised to find as
much European influence in Japan as
American, especially in fashion.
And Sakahara was disappointed to find so
much western influence in general.
"One thing that I didn't like is that there's
a prevalent attitude that in order to become
modernized, you have to become westernized.
I'd really like to see Japan maintain its own
individuality and its own culture."
Although her friends always wanted to
head off for Europe, senior Phyllis Ayer
always wanted to go the other way." So she
and eight other Stanford students boarded a
plane last July and headed west for seven
weeks in Japan.
Since 1956, Stanford has participated in an
exchange program with Japan's Keio
University. In the spring 12 Keio students
spend two months in the Stanford area, living
with host families half of the time and if
housing is available on campus the other
half
In return, the Keio students find host
families (usually their own families) for 12
Stanford students, who spend the following
summer in Japan.
Senior Steve Sakahara heads the Keio
Committee, the student-run group that
organizes the exchange. He says the
committee has no staff sponsor and "no
formal ties with the University, but it works
within the University system." It operates
under the auspices of the ASSU. Most
committee are past participants in the
exchange program.
Members of Keio's chapter of the Institute
for International Relations (IIR) run the
program there. Because students run the
program, Sakahara said, they can avoid messy
bureaucracy and red tape. "You just come
over here and have fun or go over there and
have fun. You have fun while you're learning

things; that's the whole key."
It's cultural exchange, Sakahara said. In
other words, students do not go to Japan and
lock themselves up in classrooms or libraries.
Sakahara added, "There isn't enough time
to go over there, see Japan, and study at the
same time."
The Stanford students, who chose to see
Japan, could not help but learn some Japanese
while staying with their host families. There is
no language requirement for the Stanford
students, but most have studies some Japanese
before they go to Japan. The Keio students
take an English examination before coming
her 6' Language Laughs
Her host parents did not speak English.
"We would say the stupidest things to each
other without knowing it. And then we'd find
out in the end that we just blew it and we'd
laugh. We laughed a lot."
Pam Mikuni's host parents did not speak
English either. "I didn't use my Japanese for
the first two weeks I was there. But I found
that even before I actually got enough nerve
up to start talking one-to-one, I could still get
through."
In most of the host families the fathers
were businessmen, the mothers housewives.
All but one student lived in a family with a
Keio "brother" or "sister." But their
experiences were quite different.
Mikuni said her family pampered her. "I
never touched a washing machine for eight

weeks. My host mother would not let me do
my laundry. She did it all for me. My t-shirts
came back ironed. It was just incredible."
Freedom And Friendship
Verna Abe's family was different: "My family
gave me almost total independence. They said,
'Here's how you get to and from the house.
This door's always unlocked. So whatever
time you get in, just come in.' "
Sakahara said the people he met were
"super-nice. Let's put in this way. If you left
your purse in a train or subway station, you'd
get it back."
Mikuni added, "I would have a tendency to
think that in a place that crowded, people
would be very indifferent. But if you're lost,
you can ask someone and people are really
friendly. They'll show you around.
Steve Ando said, "Keio students just come
up to you and introduce themselves. They
say, 'I hear you're a foreign exchange student.
My name's so-and-so.' And then they hand
you their card."
Each student had more to do with his
family and Keio brother or sister than with
what Sakahara called the "Japanese
Stanford."
On The Move
But even though Keio was not in session, it
sponsored a full schedule of activities: tours,
trips, and get-togethers. Ayer said, "You

bureaucracy and red tape. "You just come
over here and have fun or go over there and
have fun. You have fun while you're learning

things; that's the whole key."
It's cultural exchange, Sakahara said. In
other words, students do not go to Japan and
lock themselves up in classrooms or libraries.
Sakahara added, "There isn't enough time
to go over there, see Japan, and study at the
same time."
The Stanford students, who chose to see
Japan, could not help but learn some Japanese
while staying with their host families. There is
no language requirement for the Stanford
students, but most have studies some Japanese
before they go to Japan. The Keio students
take an English examination before coming
her 6' Language Laughs
Her host parents did not speak English.
"We would say the stupidest things to each
other without knowing it. And then we'd find
out in the end that we just blew it and we'd
laugh. We laughed a lot."
Pam Mikuni's host parents did not speak
English either. "I didn't use my Japanese for
the first two weeks I was there. But I found
that even before I actually got enough nerve
up to start talking one-to-one, I could still get
through."
In most of the host families the fathers
were businessmen, the mothers housewives.
All but one student lived in a family with a
Keio "brother" or "sister." But their
experiences were quite different.
Mikuni said her family pampered her. "I
never touched a washing machine for eight

weeks. My host mother would not let me do
my laundry. She did it all for me. My t-shirts
came back ironed. It was just incredible."
Freedom And Friendship
Verna Abe's family was different: "My family
gave me almost total independence. They said,
'Here's how you get to and from the house.
This door's always unlocked. So whatever
time you get in, just come in.' "
Sakahara said the people he met were
"super-nice. Let's put in this way. If you left
your purse in a train or subway station, you'd
get it back."
Mikuni added, "I would have a tendency to
think that in a place that crowded, people
would be very indifferent. But if you're lost,
you can ask someone and people are really
friendly. They'll show you around.
Steve Ando said, "Keio students just come
up to you and introduce themselves. They
say, 'I hear you're a foreign exchange student.
My name's so-and-so.' And then they hand
you their card."
Each student had more to do with his
family and Keio brother or sister than with
what Sakahara called the "Japanese
Stanford."
On The Move
But even though Keio was not in session, it
sponsored a full schedule of activities: tours,
trips, and get-togethers. Ayer said, "You
could either go through the structured
program or take off every now and then and
just do what you wanted to."

The Stanford students sometimes gathered
from their homes all over Tokyo to shop, go
to special events, or to eat out.
"You're not a flunky tourist, because you
go over there and you have so many contacts,
so many ins with students and families,"
Sakahara said.
The Keio students find inexpensive places
where Stanford students can stay while
traveling.
Sakahara: "You can stay in a place a
good place for two dollars a night and get
breakfast, dinner, and a hot bath."
Abe: "As long as you do it Japanese style."
Mikuni: "I spent less than $3OO in eight
weeks and I literally traveled all over Japan."
Unforgettable Sights
Sakahara added that Mikuni had an
unusually generous host family. They took
her on lots of trips.
Mikuni: "My sister took me to the peace
memorial in Hiroshima. In the museum, there
are remains of charred teapots and clothes
from people who were destroyed. It's hard to
describe what it felt like to be an American
and to walk through that, especially with my
Japanese sister."
Curiosity about things like Hiroshima
attracted the students to the program.
Ando: "My pressing concern was learning
something about my culture, my heritage."
Abe, Mikuni, and Sakahara agreed.
Abe: "I was just kind of curious to see
what it's like. You've heard about it, seen

pictures, all the people look something like
you and you're kind of curious to see what
it's like."
Ayer, the only Caucasian, had lived on a
military base near Tokyo for three years. She
thought it was a "far-out place," and wanted
to return.
Many other things made an impression on
the travelers.
Sakahara: "Culture shock comes byway of
environmental shock. When you walk down
the street, everything is a hell of a lot smaller.
It's like everything is on a smaller scale cars,
houses, streets, you name it. There's a real
economization of space. You drive down a
street and sometimes you only have four
inches on either side of a Toyota.
Mikuni: "People drilled into me before I
left, 'lt's crowded, it's crowded, it's crowded.
It's really crowded.' So I went over expecting
it to be and it is. If I had never heard any of
that and just walked into all those people ..."
Western influence interested and troubled
the Americans. Abe was surprised to find as
much European influence in Japan as
American, especially in fashion.
And Sakahara was disappointed to find so
much western influence in general.
"One thing that I didn't like is that there's
a prevalent attitude that in order to become
modernized, you have to become westernized.
I'd really like to see Japan maintain its own
individuality and its own culture."
Although her friends always wanted to
head off for Europe, senior Phyllis Ayer
always wanted to go the other way." So she
and eight other Stanford students boarded a
plane last July and headed west for seven
weeks in Japan.
Since 1956, Stanford has participated in an
exchange program with Japan's Keio
University. In the spring 12 Keio students
spend two months in the Stanford area, living
with host families half of the time and if
housing is available on campus the other
half
In return, the Keio students find host
families (usually their own families) for 12
Stanford students, who spend the following
summer in Japan.
Senior Steve Sakahara heads the Keio
Committee, the student-run group that
organizes the exchange. He says the
committee has no staff sponsor and "no
formal ties with the University, but it works
within the University system." It operates
under the auspices of the ASSU. Most
committee are past participants in the
exchange program.

for International Relations (IIR) run the

Japanese sister."
Curiosity about things like Hiroshima
attracted the students to the program.
Ando: "My pressing concern was learning
something about my culture, my heritage."
Abe, Mikuni, and Sakahara agreed.
Abe: "I was just kind of curious to see
what it's like. You've heard about it, seen

pictures, all the people look something like
you and you're kind of curious to see what
it's like."
Ayer, the only Caucasian, had lived on a
military base near Tokyo for three years. She
thought it was a "far-out place," and wanted
to return.
Many other things made an impression on
the travelers.
Sakahara: "Culture shock comes byway of
environmental shock. When you walk down
the street, everything is a hell of a lot smaller.
It's like everything is on a smaller scale cars,
houses, streets, you name it. There's a real
economization of space. You drive down a
street and sometimes you only have four
inches on either side of a Toyota.
Mikuni: "People drilled into me before I
left, 'lt's crowded, it's crowded, it's crowded.
It's really crowded.' So I went over expecting
it to be and it is. If I had never heard any of
that and just walked into all those people ..."
Western influence interested and troubled
the Americans. Abe was surprised to find as
much European influence in Japan as
American, especially in fashion.
And Sakahara was disappointed to find so
much western influence in general.
"One thing that I didn't like is that there's
a prevalent attitude that in order to become
modernized, you have to become westernized.
I'd really like to see Japan maintain its own
individuality and its own culture."
