# Prof Questions Classification Of Government Documents

### RON ELVING 
With the current flap over
secrecy .in government, Assoc.
History Prof. Barton J. Bernstein
is questioning the government's
practice of sponsoring official
histories while denying
independent historians access to
primary research materials.
Federally financed official
histories began during World War
11, when Congress funded the
chronicling of war-time
administration activities.
Expanding upon this precedent,
several departments such as Labor
and Defense and agencies like
NASA presently produce detailed
histories of their operations which
have been or will be published by
the government.
Bernstein cited Army accounts
of the Vietnam conflict to
illustrate the problems of official
historiography. He argued that
these accounts "tended toward
petty fact-gathering, while
eschewing all the large questions."
Although such works present their
materials in objective, informative
terms, Bernstein suggested that
"in terms of what an official
history excludes, and in terms of
its general framework, it is often,
subtly, quite interpretive."
Whatever the scholarly value of
these studies may be, Bernstein
noted, they are clearly based
upon classified documents and
other forms of primary source
material which are not available to
non-official historians.

Bernstein said that the public's
interest would be better served by
opening these materials to
independent scholars, thus
allowing the evidence to be
examined by individuals who do
not rely upon the government for
their paychecks.
Bernstein exempted " bona fide
military secrets, as might be
defined independently of the
military," while characterizing the
classification process as "away of
covering up mistakes; away of
lower echelon people making sure
they don't err by possibly
revealing something useful."
Bernstein said he is well
acquainted with the difficulties
involved in declassifying
government documents. He said
he had exchanged over 40 letters
with the State Department in an
attempt to see telegrams relevant
to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.
Although three years of
persistent inquiry finally opened
this file,' Bernstein said other
searches have led him through a
labyrinth and ended with almost
Kafkaesque frustration.
After receiving permission to
examine a certain military leader's
papers, Bernstein said he arrived
at the Library of Congress to learn
that his permission was useless
because he had not been granted
access. Had he specifically asked
for the latter, he was informed,
his request would have been
refused.
The problem of access to
classified material is compounded
by the semi-official
exceptions-to-the-rule made for
individuals with special
credentials, Bernstein cited. In
writing his memoirs, former
Secretary of State Dean Acheson

used State Department files which
are still labelled secret. In his
book on the Cuban missile crisis,
Thirteen Days, Robert F.Kennedy
made use of numerous classified
documents, including the
Kennedy-Krushchev cables
Bernstein said he later attempted
to see.
Considering whether such
disclosures of classified material
made Acheson and Kennedy as
legally culpable as Daniel Ellsberg
was with the Pentagon Papers,
Bernstein remarked: "So it would
seem. But there has been no
apparent will [on the part of the
government] to prosecute or
pursue the cases."
Bernstein readily noted that
other American historians attach
considerable value to
government-sponsored histories.
He also took a dim view of
prospects for liberalized secrecy
regulations. Although the present
mood of Congress may permit
passage of legislation against
arbitrary classification, Bernstein
said the executive branch would
be responsible for enforcement.
He added: "I don't think one
should be unduly optimistic about
the capacity of our government to
meet needs which people with
power do not seek to meet."
