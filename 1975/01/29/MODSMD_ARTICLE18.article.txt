## 1976 Olympics To Stanford? 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Olympic Games at Stanford?
It's possible.
Despite a lack of time for
preparations, the Bay Area could
make a second bid for the 1976
Summer Olympic Games, should
Montreal be forced to bow out as
the host for the XXI Olympiad,
the San Francisco Examiner
reported Sunday.
The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has scheduled a
special meeting this week to
discuss the labor problems and
spiraling costs which may force
Montreal to give up the Olympics.

If the Olympics were moved to
the Bay Area, Stanford Stadium
would be the site of the track and
field competition. Other
University facilities would serve as
the site for the equestrian,
modern penthalon, swimming and
diving and cycling events.
A modernistic Olympic Village
would also be built at Stanford to
house the Olympians. The Village
would probably be given to the
University at the conclusion of
the Games for use as dormatories.
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan expressed interest in the
pitch for an "instant Olympics,"
using the ready-made facilities
which exist in the Bay Area.
In 1962 Stanford Stadium
hosted the two-day track and field
meet between the U.S. and Soviet
Union which attracted 153,000
track enthusiasts.
"Naturally, I can only speak in
general terms and only for myself
and not for the University,"
Jordan said. "But I believe our
Stadium has already proved its
worth for such a major
undertaking.
The 1968 U.S. Olympic track
coach added that Stanford could
probably accommodate the 8 to
10 thousand athletes who would
require housing. Stanford can
handle almost that many right
now, Jordan said.
Former San Jose Mayor Ron
James, President of the Bay Area
Olympic Committee, said that
Stanford had made a "housing
commitment," when the proposal
was submitted in 1970.
"We appeared before a
University Committee and they
made a commitment to build
some new housing for the
athletes. But I don't know what
has gone on at Stanford. The
people have changed and we
would have to look at the
situation all over again," James
said.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
said he would take a "good long
look" at the Olympic proposal.
"Olympic Games usually lose
money and Stanford can't foot
the bill."
Ruetz pointed out that there
would have to be some
modifications made in the
Stadium to accommodate the
Games.

There are major problems
which face the games. San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto,
who was Chairman of the Board
of the Bay Area Olympic
Committee which first bid on the
Olympics, has expressed doubt
about whether the Bay Area can
make the needed preparations in
the short time period.
James said that it would be a
"Herculean task." "When we
made the proposal it was 1970,
and we still needed six years of
planning."
Raising the necessary funds
may also pose a problem. The Bay
Area Olympic Committee group
presented a budget of $22 million,
with $12.5 million of the cost
being covered by federal, state
and local government
contributions. The $3 million
Olympic Village would have come
out of this anticipated revenue.

James said that the financing
would have to be reconsidered.
"We expected $12.5 million from
government contributions, but
with today's economic picture we
would have to make new
arrangements. The costs for
building an Olympic Village have
probably gone up along with
everything else."
Donald Miller, U.S. Olympic
Committee Chairman told the
Examiner that it might be "a bit
premature" to discuss alternate
sites for the Olympiad.
"But if Montreal were in effect
to return the Games to the lOC,
the procedure would then be for
the lOC to poll member countries
for possible interest in staging the
Games. The U.S. Olympic
Committee would then be open to
inquiries from cities in this
country desiring to express
interest.

probably accommodate the 8 to
10 thousand athletes who would
require housing. Stanford can
handle almost that many right
now, Jordan said.
Former San Jose Mayor Ron
James, President of the Bay Area
Olympic Committee, said that
Stanford had made a "housing
commitment," when the proposal
was submitted in 1970.
"We appeared before a
University Committee and they
made a commitment to build
some new housing for the
athletes. But I don't know what
has gone on at Stanford. The
people have changed and we
would have to look at the
situation all over again," James
said.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
said he would take a "good long
look" at the Olympic proposal.
"Olympic Games usually lose
money and Stanford can't foot
the bill."
Ruetz pointed out that there
would have to be some
modifications made in the
Stadium to accommodate the
Games.

There are major problems
which face the games. San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto,
who was Chairman of the Board
of the Bay Area Olympic
Committee which first bid on the
Olympics, has expressed doubt
about whether the Bay Area can
make the needed preparations in
the short time period.
James said that it would be a
"Herculean task." "When we
made the proposal it was 1970,
and we still needed six years of
planning."
Raising the necessary funds
may also pose a problem. The Bay
Area Olympic Committee group
presented a budget of $22 million,
with $12.5 million of the cost
being covered by federal, state
and local government
contributions. The $3 million
Olympic Village would have come
out of this anticipated revenue.

James said that the financing
would have to be reconsidered.
"We expected $12.5 million from
government contributions, but
with today's economic picture we
would have to make new
arrangements. The costs for
building an Olympic Village have
probably gone up along with
everything else."
Donald Miller, U.S. Olympic
Committee Chairman told the
Examiner that it might be "a bit
premature" to discuss alternate
sites for the Olympiad.
"But if Montreal were in effect
to return the Games to the lOC,
the procedure would then be for
the lOC to poll member countries
for possible interest in staging the
Games. The U.S. Olympic
Committee would then be open to
inquiries from cities in this
country desiring to express

OLYMPIC SITE? Stanford Stadium would host the 1976 Olympic track and field competition if
Montreal relinquished the Games and the Bay Area got them. The Stadium hosted the 1962 U.S.-Soviet
Union track meet (above).
Olympic Games at Stanford?
It's possible.
Despite a lack of time for
preparations, the Bay Area could
make a second bid for the 1976
Summer Olympic Games, should
Montreal be forced to bow out as
the host for the XXI Olympiad,
the San Francisco Examiner
reported Sunday.
The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has scheduled a
special meeting this week to
discuss the labor problems and
spiraling costs which may force
Montreal to give up the Olympics.

If the Olympics were moved to
the Bay Area, Stanford Stadium
would be the site of the track and
field competition. Other
University facilities would serve as
the site for the equestrian,
modern penthalon, swimming and
diving and cycling events.
A modernistic Olympic Village
would also be built at Stanford to
house the Olympians. The Village
would probably be given to the
University at the conclusion of
the Games for use as dormatories.
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan expressed interest in the
pitch for an "instant Olympics,"
using the ready-made facilities
which exist in the Bay Area.
In 1962 Stanford Stadium
hosted the two-day track and field
meet between the U.S. and Soviet
Union which attracted 153,000
track enthusiasts.
"Naturally, I can only speak in
general terms and only for myself
and not for the University,"
Jordan said. "But I believe our
Stadium has already proved its
worth for such a major
undertaking.
The 1968 U.S. Olympic track
coach added that Stanford could
