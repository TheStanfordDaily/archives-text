# Donovan Dallas' Fourth Round Pick; Cal's 'Bart' First NFL Draft Choice
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Dallas Cowboys yesterday selected
Stanford Ail-American defensive end Pat
i Donovan as their fourth-round pick in the
National Football League's annual collegiate
draft. Donovan was the only Card selected in
the seven rounds conducted yesterday. The
draft concludes today.
The NCAA named Donovan a consensus
All-American late last year after United Press
International, the American Football Writers
and the American Football Coaches had each
chosen him for first-team honors.
During the 1974 season, Donovan trailed
Drew Palin and Gordy Riegel in total tackles
for Stanford, having led the team in tackles
during his junior year. The Associated Press
honored Donovan as an All-American that
year. He was only the 10th two-time
All-American in Stanford history.
Donovan, a mechanical engineering major
from Helena, Mont., stands 6-5 and weighs
250 pounds.
When contacted by the Daily last night, he
said he "was really surprised to be drafted by
Dallas, because they're really strong along
their defensive line. They might consider
moving me to linebacker or to the offensive
line," he speculated.
'A Real Relief'
Calling it "a real relief to have it over
with," Donovan also said he was "a lot
happier being drafted by Dallas than by just
about anyone else." He added that a
representative of the Cowboys had contacted
him "right after they picked me," but said he
was told nothing about his prospects with the
team.

Although the floundering World Football
League has yet to conduct its draft, Donovan
said "I don't think that the WFL is really a
strong option for me any more. It might have
been if I had been drafted in the 14th or
15th round by the NFL, but unless the WFL
can show a lot more financial security than it
has, I wouldn't even consider them."
As expected, the Atlanta Falcons chose
California quarterback Steve Bartkowski in
the first round, making him the first collegian
to be picked in the draft. Bartkowski last
year broke Craig Morton's single-season

passing record at Cal by throwing for 2580
yards and 12 touchdowns.
Dallas Chooses White
The second pick of the draft was made by
Dallas, which chose Outland Trophy winner
Randy White, Maryland's outstanding
255-pound defensive end. Apparently,
though, White will not be a threat to
Donovan's chances at that position because
the Cowboys have announced their intention
to make White a linebacker.
Eight members of the national champion
Southern California team were chosen
yesterday. They were:
Anthony Davis (2nd round, New York
Jets); Charles Phillips (2nd, Oakland
Raiders); Bill Bain (2nd, Green Bay Packers);
Art Riley (2nd, Minnesota Vikings); Richard
Wood (3rd, Jets); Allen Carter (4th, New
England Patriots); Jim Obradovich (7th, New
York Giants); and Rhodes scholar Pat Haden
(7th, Los Angeles Rams).
Kuykendall To Atlanta
Atlanta selected UCLA linebacker Fulton
Kuykendall in the sixth round. He was the
only Bruin chosen yesterday.
San Jose State cornerback Louie Wright
was picked in the first round by the Denver
Broncos, while teammate Dave Wasick, a
linebacker, went to the Kansas City Chiefs in
the sixth round.
Observers expect Riegel, defensive end
Roger Stillwell and running back Scott
Laidlaw to be selected today. Other possible
choices from Stanford include Palin,
defensive back Doc Blanchard, linebacker
John Snider, offensive tackle Keith Rowen
and wide receiver Eric Test.
