# Monetary Situation May Squeeze Campuses From Overseas Program
## 
### JOHN FREED 
As many as three overseas campuses
* could close by 1979 unless the dollar
makes a "radical" comeback in
international financial circles,
according to Don Price, associate
director of overseas studies.
In a draft report, Price outlined
"worst case" contingency plans,
a proposal to maintain only
one program in each language area
now covered.
"One of our plans is to maintain at
least one program in each cultural area
we serve German language area,
Spanish, Italian, French and English.
y We'll try at least to maintain that,"
Price said yesterday.
Preliminary Tendencies
The draft must eventually be acted
on by the Committee on Foreign
Studies Programs. Committee member
Robert Spitzer, a senior majoring in
T history, outlined the committee's
preliminary tendencies.
"The German language area is open
to question as to how many [sites]
we're going to keep," Spitzer declared.

"I would say the chances for two
German-speaking campuses are good."
He added that campuses in Berlin
and Weinstadt/Beutelsbach, Germany,
would probably be phased out.
Campus Phase Outs
"I would say almost certainly
Beutelsbach will be out," he noted.
"Berlin could go, too. Vienna seems to
be strong, and it's my speculation that
Bonn will remain."
In France, the Tours site seems the
likely candidate for survival, at least in
the short run.
"There are a number of reasons for
going with Paris," Spitzer said. "But
there are strong economic reasons for
staying in Tours.... It's the consensus
of the committee that when it's
financially feasible, a move to Paris
would be beneficial," he related.
Salamanca, Florence Stay?
In the Hispanic areas, the Lima,
Peru campus will be suspended for
1975-76, leaving only Salamanca,
Spain, in the running for the time
being.
Price said the Italian program in

Florence would probably remain
intact.
"The Italian affair is low-cost,
relatively speaking, so we're not
proposing any plans for
retrenchment," Price explained.
Price repeatedly emphasized that
no cutbacks in programs will occur in
1975-76, with the exception of the
suspension of the Lima site.
"Next year, we will have all of our
present programs except Lima. There
will be no closings until 1976-77 at the
earliest," he stated.
50 Percent Budget Cuts
Budget cuts for overseas campuses
are targeted at about $BOO,OOO, or 50
percent of general funding for the
campuses, Provost William F. Miller
announced at last week's Faculty
Senate meeting. Price noted that
international monetary situations will
play an important part in overseas
financing.
"Our problem is perhaps worse
because of the exchange value [of the
dollars], than because of the
University's financial problems," Price

stated. "The dollar's worth has
dropped radically up to 50 percent
in the last five years."
Substantial administrative cuts have
already been made, Price explained,
and more will come even if entire
programs remain intact.
Extraordinary Cuts
"Within our programs overseas, we
have made extraordinary cuts, and we
have considerable cuts to go without
reducing programs," he said.
"One way to do it is to get
subsidies from foreign governments to
support our programs," he added.
Costs of room and board are
already at least partly subsidized at six
European campuses. At Cliveden,
England,and at Weinstadt/Beutelsbach,
Germany, the University has obtained
favorable leasing terms. At campuses
in Tours, France, and in Vienna, Berlin
and Paris, local universities provide
housing or meal plan subsidies.
Campuses at Salamanca and
Florence receive no subsidies.
Price emphasized that program
cutbacks will occur only if the dollar
remains weak, the program receives no
new subsidies, and the University's
financial picture stays bleak.
'Worst-Case' Plan
"This is a 'worst-case' plan," he
remarked. "If we have some luck, we
can come near that goal [of an
$BOO,OOO budget cut] without
eliminating any program.... For
example, a 20 percent increase in the
value of the dollar would result in a
$300,000 savings."
He explained that such a
strengthening of the dollar is unlikely,
though not impossible.
"The deutschmark has decreased 20
percent against the dollar in the last 12
months. These are tremendous shifts
in value," he stated.
Increasing fees for participating
students is another possible source of
increased revenue, according to Price.
"We have other options. We could
increase the fees we charge, but we
don't want to limit the program to the
wealthy students."
Staff members have remained
optimistic that the cutbacks will not
prove disastrous, Price asserted.

Senate meeting. Price noted that
international monetary situations will
play an important part in overseas
financing.
"Our problem is perhaps worse
because of the exchange value [of the
dollars], than because of the
University's financial problems," Price

stated. "The dollar's worth has
dropped radically up to 50 percent
in the last five years."
Substantial administrative cuts have
already been made, Price explained,
and more will come even if entire
programs remain intact.
Extraordinary Cuts
"Within our programs overseas, we
have made extraordinary cuts, and we
have considerable cuts to go without
reducing programs," he said.
"One way to do it is to get
subsidies from foreign governments to
support our programs," he added.
Costs of room and board are
already at least partly subsidized at six
European campuses. At Cliveden,
England,and at Weinstadt/Beutelsbach,
Germany, the University has obtained
favorable leasing terms. At campuses
in Tours, France, and in Vienna, Berlin
and Paris, local universities provide
housing or meal plan subsidies.
Campuses at Salamanca and
Florence receive no subsidies.
Price emphasized that program
cutbacks will occur only if the dollar
remains weak, the program receives no
new subsidies, and the University's
financial picture stays bleak.
'Worst-Case' Plan
"This is a 'worst-case' plan," he
remarked. "If we have some luck, we
can come near that goal [of an
$BOO,OOO budget cut] without
eliminating any program.... For
example, a 20 percent increase in the
value of the dollar would result in a
$300,000 savings."
He explained that such a
strengthening of the dollar is unlikely,
though not impossible.
"The deutschmark has decreased 20
percent against the dollar in the last 12
months. These are tremendous shifts
in value," he stated.
Increasing fees for participating
students is another possible source of
increased revenue, according to Price.
"We have other options. We could
increase the fees we charge, but we
don't want to limit the program to the
wealthy students."
Staff members have remained
optimistic that the cutbacks will not
prove disastrous, Price asserted.
As many as three overseas campuses
* could close by 1979 unless the dollar
makes a "radical" comeback in
international financial circles,
according to Don Price, associate
director of overseas studies.
In a draft report, Price outlined
"worst case" contingency plans,
a proposal to maintain only
one program in each language area
now covered.
"One of our plans is to maintain at
least one program in each cultural area
we serve German language area,
Spanish, Italian, French and English.
y We'll try at least to maintain that,"
Price said yesterday.
Preliminary Tendencies
The draft must eventually be acted
on by the Committee on Foreign
Studies Programs. Committee member
Robert Spitzer, a senior majoring in
T history, outlined the committee's
preliminary tendencies.
"The German language area is open
to question as to how many [sites]
we're going to keep," Spitzer declared.

"I would say the chances for two
German-speaking campuses are good."
He added that campuses in Berlin
and Weinstadt/Beutelsbach, Germany,
would probably be phased out.
Campus Phase Outs
"I would say almost certainly
Beutelsbach will be out," he noted.
"Berlin could go, too. Vienna seems to
be strong, and it's my speculation that
Bonn will remain."
In France, the Tours site seems the
likely candidate for survival, at least in
the short run.
"There are a number of reasons for
going with Paris," Spitzer said. "But
there are strong economic reasons for
staying in Tours.... It's the consensus
of the committee that when it's
financially feasible, a move to Paris
would be beneficial," he related.
Salamanca, Florence Stay?
In the Hispanic areas, the Lima,
Peru campus will be suspended for
1975-76, leaving only Salamanca,
Spain, in the running for the time
being.
Price said the Italian program in

Florence would probably remain
intact.
"The Italian affair is low-cost,
relatively speaking, so we're not
proposing any plans for
retrenchment," Price explained.
Price repeatedly emphasized that
no cutbacks in programs will occur in
1975-76, with the exception of the
suspension of the Lima site.
"Next year, we will have all of our
present programs except Lima. There
will be no closings until 1976-77 at the
earliest," he stated.
50 Percent Budget Cuts
Budget cuts for overseas campuses
are targeted at about $BOO,OOO, or 50
percent of general funding for the
campuses, Provost William F. Miller
announced at last week's Faculty
Senate meeting. Price noted that
international monetary situations will
play an important part in overseas
financing.

Spanish, Italian, French and English.
y We'll try at least to maintain that,"
Price said yesterday.
Preliminary Tendencies
The draft must eventually be acted
on by the Committee on Foreign
Studies Programs. Committee member
Robert Spitzer, a senior majoring in
T history, outlined the committee's
preliminary tendencies.
"The German language area is open
to question as to how many [sites]
we're going to keep," Spitzer declared.

"I would say the chances for two
German-speaking campuses are good."
He added that campuses in Berlin
and Weinstadt/Beutelsbach, Germany,
would probably be phased out.
Campus Phase Outs
"I would say almost certainly
Beutelsbach will be out," he noted.
"Berlin could go, too. Vienna seems to
be strong, and it's my speculation that
Bonn will remain."
In France, the Tours site seems the
likely candidate for survival, at least in
the short run.
"There are a number of reasons for
going with Paris," Spitzer said. "But
there are strong economic reasons for
staying in Tours.... It's the consensus
of the committee that when it's
financially feasible, a move to Paris
would be beneficial," he related.
Salamanca, Florence Stay?
In the Hispanic areas, the Lima,
Peru campus will be suspended for
1975-76, leaving only Salamanca,
Spain, in the running for the time
being.
Price said the Italian program in

Florence would probably remain
intact.
"The Italian affair is low-cost,
relatively speaking, so we're not
proposing any plans for
retrenchment," Price explained.
Price repeatedly emphasized that
no cutbacks in programs will occur in
1975-76, with the exception of the
suspension of the Lima site.
"Next year, we will have all of our
present programs except Lima. There
will be no closings until 1976-77 at the
earliest," he stated.
50 Percent Budget Cuts
Budget cuts for overseas campuses
are targeted at about $BOO,OOO, or 50
percent of general funding for the
campuses, Provost William F. Miller
announced at last week's Faculty
Senate meeting. Price noted that
international monetary situations will
play an important part in overseas
financing.
"Our problem is perhaps worse
because of the exchange value [of the
dollars], than because of the
University's financial problems," Price

stated. "The dollar's worth has
dropped radically up to 50 percent
in the last five years."
Substantial administrative cuts have
already been made, Price explained,
and more will come even if entire
programs remain intact.
Extraordinary Cuts
"Within our programs overseas, we
have made extraordinary cuts, and we
have considerable cuts to go without
reducing programs," he said.
"One way to do it is to get
subsidies from foreign governments to
support our programs," he added.
Costs of room and board are
already at least partly subsidized at six
European campuses. At Cliveden,
England,and at Weinstadt/Beutelsbach,
Germany, the University has obtained
favorable leasing terms. At campuses
in Tours, France, and in Vienna, Berlin
and Paris, local universities provide
housing or meal plan subsidies.
Campuses at Salamanca and
Florence receive no subsidies.
Price emphasized that program
cutbacks will occur only if the dollar
remains weak, the program receives no
new subsidies, and the University's
financial picture stays bleak.
'Worst-Case' Plan
"This is a 'worst-case' plan," he
remarked. "If we have some luck, we
can come near that goal [of an
$BOO,OOO budget cut] without
eliminating any program.... For
example, a 20 percent increase in the
value of the dollar would result in a
$300,000 savings."
He explained that such a
strengthening of the dollar is unlikely,
though not impossible.
"The deutschmark has decreased 20
percent against the dollar in the last 12
months. These are tremendous shifts
in value," he stated.
Increasing fees for participating
students is another possible source of
increased revenue, according to Price.
"We have other options. We could
increase the fees we charge, but we
don't want to limit the program to the
wealthy students."
Staff members have remained
optimistic that the cutbacks will not
prove disastrous, Price asserted.
