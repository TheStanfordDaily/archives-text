### 
Wrestlers Win
Sparked by an opening match
pin by Malcolm Scott, Stanford's
wrestling team went on to burn
San Francisco State last night,
32-8.
And coach Joe DeMeo was
ecstatic. "Our guys were superb,"
he exclaimed. "Overall, everyone
was outstanding."
Scott has been wrestling only
intermittently since December
because of an ankle injury. Facing
Sam Barnochia, who took second
in the 118-pound class at the San
Francisco Invitational last
weekend, Scott was the underdog.
His teammates considered the
upset to be "the most exciting
part of the meet."
Stanford went on to take a
21-3 lead after pins by Bob
Keating and All-American Chris
Horpel. Horpel was wrestling with
a black eye swollen almost shut.
"You don't need to see too
well to wrestle, though," he
explained.
Horpel was more concerned
that many of his opponents know
his reputation, and "do everything
not to wrestle what I consider to
be a good match. They force me
to be a super-aggressor."
The Cards' Craig Reynolds
squeaked past Kevin Monford in
the 158 pound class, 5-4. He
considered it to be a "revenge
match, to make up for losing to
Monford at the San Francisco
Invitational."
With three matches to go,
Stanford had already clinched its
11th win of the season, after
freshman Gary Lynn outpointed
Joe Martinez, 8-4.
