# Seifert Named Cornell Coach
## 
### 
Assistant football coach
George Seifert, 35, has been
named head football coach at
Cornell University, it was
announced Monday.
Seifert has served as defensive
backfield coach for the Cardinals
during the three Christiansen
years. He is considered one of the
best coaches around. His 1972
and 1973 backfields led the
Pacific Eight conference, and he
molded an inexperienced group
this past season into an excellent
backfield.
Special teams coach Willie
Shaw will replace Seifert as
defensive backfield coach. Shaw's
vacancy may or may not be filled,
depending on how much budget
cutbacks affect .the football
program.
Seifert was among SO
candidates for the Cornell job,
and has spent the last week at the

school, located in Ithaca, N.Y.
Cornell fired its coach, Jack
Musick, last month after a 3-5-1
season.
Seifert signed a three-year
contract with the Ivy League
school, which awards no athletic
scholarships and does not permit
spring practice.
It is possible that Seifert will
talk to "one or two" persons
associated with the Stanford
program about joining him at
Cornell.
"I fell in love with Cornell
immediately," Seifert said. "They
seem very sincere in wanting to
bring the football program back
to prominence.
Card coach Jack Christiansen
said "I'm sorry to see a guy of his
caliber go, but those are the ones
who become head coaches. It's a
great opportunity for him.
