# Women's Cage Team To Show New Look
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
Women's basketball: the words
usually conjure up images of odd
rules, inept players and musty
gymnasiums. But times have
changed. Only Roble Gym ties the
1975 edition of the women's
basketball team with the past.
The Cards take the court
tonight for their season opener
with Santa Clara University. The
varsity game starts at 6 p.m. in the
friendly confines of Roble, with
the JV game following.
For those who remember past
seasons, this year's team is
wallowing in luxury. Granted, the
Stanford home court lacks
amenities like a scoreboard and
stands for the faithful. Still, the
team will have its first uniforms in
history, though they haven't
arrived yet. And the women now
have riches like an assistant coach
and a trainer.
But best features about this
year's team will be on the court.
The anachronistic rules of
women's ball disappeared several
years ago. New head coach Gay
Coburn has a host of new faces on
the team. Six freshmen are playing
for the 11-person varsity.
Fast Break
"We're going to run the fast
break as much as possible,"
promises Cobum. If this week's
scrimmages are any indication, the
varsity will run very well indeed.
The key to the offense is
height on the front line.
According to scouting reports, the
Cards will be taller than any team
they play this season. Four
women are 5-foot-10 or taller,

three of them freshmen.
For the purists in the crowd,
Stanford seems particularly adept
at interior passing. And the Cards
play ferocious defense.
Sophomore captain Sonia Jarvis
has especially quick hands.
The starting line-up won't be
known until the five walk out for
the opening tip tonight. Unlike
the men's varsity, however, the
players on the bench will be little
worse if not as good than
those on the floor.
Broncos Report
According to a team member
who scouted a Santa Clara
scrimmage, the Broncos are a
short team with a lot of
endurance. They will need it. To
beat the Cards, they will also need
good outside shooting. When they
miss, Stanford should do very well
on the boards.
The Stanford junior varsity has
only nine players, and but eight
will suit up for tonight's game.
Most of the height has ended up
on the varsity. The sole exception
is 5-10 freshman captain Lisa
Kolb. The JV's have only been
playing together for a week, but
there is probably as much talent
on the team as on any junior
varsity the Cards will play this
season.
Women's basketball has come a
long way in the last few years.
The rule book even contains some
innovations that the men lack
notably a 30-second shooting rule.
Those who come to Roble Gym
tonight should be treated to an
exciting, well-played basketball
game.

who scouted a Santa Clara
scrimmage, the Broncos are a
short team with a lot of
endurance. They will need it. To
beat the Cards, they will also need
good outside shooting. When they
miss, Stanford should do very well
on the boards.
The Stanford junior varsity has
only nine players, and but eight
will suit up for tonight's game.
Most of the height has ended up
on the varsity. The sole exception
is 5-10 freshman captain Lisa
Kolb. The JV's have only been
playing together for a week, but
there is probably as much talent
on the team as on any junior
varsity the Cards will play this
season.
Women's basketball has come a
long way in the last few years.
The rule book even contains some
innovations that the men lack
notably a 30-second shooting rule.
Those who come to Roble Gym
tonight should be treated to an
exciting, well-played basketball
game.
Women's basketball: the words
usually conjure up images of odd
rules, inept players and musty
gymnasiums. But times have
changed. Only Roble Gym ties the
1975 edition of the women's
basketball team with the past.
The Cards take the court
tonight for their season opener
with Santa Clara University. The
varsity game starts at 6 p.m. in the
friendly confines of Roble, with
the JV game following.
For those who remember past
seasons, this year's team is
wallowing in luxury. Granted, the
Stanford home court lacks
amenities like a scoreboard and
stands for the faithful. Still, the
team will have its first uniforms in
history, though they haven't
arrived yet. And the women now
have riches like an assistant coach
and a trainer.
But best features about this
year's team will be on the court.
The anachronistic rules of
women's ball disappeared several
years ago. New head coach Gay
Coburn has a host of new faces on
the team. Six freshmen are playing
for the 11-person varsity.
Fast Break
"We're going to run the fast
break as much as possible,"
promises Cobum. If this week's
scrimmages are any indication, the
varsity will run very well indeed.
The key to the offense is
height on the front line.
According to scouting reports, the
Cards will be taller than any team
they play this season. Four
women are 5-foot-10 or taller,

three of them freshmen.
For the purists in the crowd,
Stanford seems particularly adept
at interior passing. And the Cards
play ferocious defense.
Sophomore captain Sonia Jarvis
has especially quick hands.
The starting line-up won't be
known until the five walk out for
the opening tip tonight. Unlike
the men's varsity, however, the
players on the bench will be little
worse if not as good than
those on the floor.
