Congress, Ford Joust Over Tariff
WASHINGTON Congress and President Ford
jousted for position yesterday in their impending
clash over the President's proposed oil import tariff.
Each urged the other to compromise.
Ford rejected a Democratic appeal for a 90-day
delay in higher oil tariffs, scheduled to begin
Saturday. House Democratic leaders conceded they
cannot act in time to prevent the tariff from taking
effect.
The increased tariffs will begin pushing gasoline
and heating oil prices upward within a week.
The appeal for delay came at a White House
meeting where Rep. A1 Ullman (D-Ore.) asked Ford
to trade a 90-day delay in the tariffs for a
compromise energy conservation program.
Ullman told reporters, "I think he's amenable to
some sort of compromise."
Later, White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen
said, "The President has decided he will not go for a
90-day delay."
Nessen also quoted Ford as urging the bipartisan
congressional leadership to move toward a
compromise on the energy program.
Meanwhile, Ullman introduced an $lB billion
package of tax cuts and investment incentives as an
alternative to Ford's economic proposals.
But Ullman said his committee would make the
decisions on any bill approved by the panel.
Ullman said he had told Ford that if he doesn't
compromise on the oil tariff, there would be a
direct confrontation between him and the Congress
that "could have serious adverse reaction
throughout the country."
Under Ford's plan, a tariff of sl-a-barrel will be
imposed on all oil being imported into this country
beginning Feb. 1; the amount would rise to $2 on
March 1, and $3 on April 1.
Although the Democratic majority in Congress is
preparing legislation requiring a 90-day
postponement in the tariff, House Speaker Carl
Albert admitted to newsmen that the legislation
can't be passed before next week at the earliest.
Kissinger: Mideast Pact Possible
WASHINGTON The basic Egyptian demand
for additional Israeli withdrawals from the Sinai
Peninsula can be reconciled with Israel's demand for
some Arab political concessions, Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday.
However, Kissinger took some of the edge off
this optimistic assessment when he added that his
Middle East swing next, month will be "an
exploratory trip... in order to see what the real
possibilities of a solution might be."
He emphasized that his trip to the region would
not be an exercise in the "shuttle diplomacy" that
has marked his previous successes in arranging
Arab-Israeli agreements. Instead, a second trip will
be necessary once the exploratory phase is over,
probably in March.
Ford Asks S. Vietnam Aid
WASHINGTON President Ford formally asked
Congress yesterday for an additional $3OO million in
military aid to South Vietnam. But Sen. John
Tower (R-Tex.) said the request would be turned
down because "the majority of the Congress is
prepared to let Vietnam go down the drain."
In voting only half of the President's $1.4-billion

request for South Vietnam aid last year Congress
already indicated its willingness to sacrifice South
Vietnam, Tower, chairman of the Republican Policy
Committee, told reporters.
In addition to the request ior South Vietnam,
Ford is seeking some $220 million for Cambodia.
In a special message to Congress accompanying
the request, Ford said that "recent events have
made it clear that North Vietnam is again trying to
impose a solution by force."
Chairman Otto E. Passman (D-La.), of the House
foreign operations appropriations subcommittee.,
reportedly told committee members he will be
holding hearings on Ford's request next Monday
and Tuesday.
Bomb Explodes At D.C. State Dept.
WASHINGTON - A bomb exploded in an
elevator shaft in the State Department headquarters
here early today, District of Columbia police said.
There were no injuries reported, the D.C. fire
department said.
The explosion came about an hour after news
media around the country were notified by a caller
claiming to represent the "Weather Underground
Organization" that some kind of damage would be
done to the State Department and to a Defense
Department installation in Oakland, Calif.
In Oakland, police and FBI agents stopped
searching for explosives in the old Armed Forces
Induction Center early today after a second
anonymous phonecall warned that a bomb planted
there by the Weather Underground would go off.
"Officers went in there at first and found
something that might have been some kind of
device, but then they heard about the second
warning and decided to back off and see what
happens," said police officer Walter Lehto.
Initial warnings about the explosives were
received by local news media last night.
The building, which covers an entire block in
downtown Oakland, was sealed off. No bomb
exploded more than an hour after the first warning
said it would. However, one of the anonymous
callers telephoned a San Francisco tele vision station
again to insist that a bomb would explode before 6
a.m. today.
Lehto said police would resume their search after
6 a.m.
Battle Rages In Indochina
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Rebel gunners on
both sides of the Mekong River poured heavy fire
yesterday on a 16-ship convoy trying a new run of
the perilous gantlet to isolated Phnom Penh, but
there were no immediate reports of casualties,
military sources said.
The convoy, the biggest to attempt the run since
insurgent forces blocked the Mekong River lifeline a
month ago, consists of five freighters, four fuel
tankers and seven barges loaded with rice,
ammunition and other vital supplies for
hard-pressed Phnom Penh, the sources said.
Two smaller convoys reached Phnom Penh last
week, but the ships suffered considerable damage
from insurgent fire during their hazardous 60-mile
trips upriver from South Vietnam.
Captains on the run make $5OO a month and
crewmen $l2O. They are paid by Sea-Pac, an
American subsidiary of Alaska Barge and Transport.

In other Indochina developments:
—Rebel gunners fired five rockets into Phnom
Penh's airport and the northern part of the city,
killing six persons, police said. Field reports said
three government navy boats ferried about 80
wounded refugees from the besieged ferry town and
naval base of Neak Luong, 32 miles southeast of
Phnom Penh. Neak Luong is an important base for
guarding the Mekong shipping channel for resupply
convoys to Phnom Penh.
—The Saigon command said 45 government
troops and 121 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
soldiers were killed in small clashes and rocket and
mortar attacks in the 24 hours ending at dawn.
—Twelve opposition deputies issued an open
letter to the U.S. Congress, calling for an end to aid
to South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu.
The letter said Thieu does not represent the
majority of the 20 million South Vietnamese and
that "increased aid to Mr. Thieu only helps him to
flatten the South Vietnamese people. To increase
aid is to increase prisons, more opportunity for Mr.
Thieu to increase coercion."
—Hanoi said the United States must halt
reconnaissance flights over Vietnam, provide it with
reconstruction aid and end "military involvement
and intervention" in South Vietnam to obtain a
peaceful settlement of the war.
Nixon Healthy Enough For Trips?
LONG BEACH Richard Nixon's personal
physician revealed yesterday that he examined the
former president last Friday and said Nixon
"perhaps" would be able to take excursions from
behind his walled estate next month.
The examination came on the same day Nixon
received Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as a
personal guest at his San Clemente villa the
former Western White House.
"It was a routine checkup which we do
periodically and it was not connected with Mr.
Kissinger's visit, although it gave me the
opportunity to see how Nixon reacted to the
situation," said Dr. John C. Lungren.
"Depending on how much Mr. Nixon progresses,
he might be able to leave the compound [Nixon's
estate] next month to take occasional trips, perhaps
by car or helicopter," Lungren said in an interview.
But the physician was unable to say whether Mr.
Nixon would be well enough at that time to fly to
Washington to testify at any future trial or
congressional hearings.
And Lungren said he was even uncertain whether
the former chief executive would be able to attend
court proceedings in Los Angeles or nearby Santa
Ana, the Orange County seat.
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said in
Washington, D.C., that he hopes when Nixon regains
his health, the former president would consider
campaigning for Republican candidates and
participating in fund-raising dinners.
