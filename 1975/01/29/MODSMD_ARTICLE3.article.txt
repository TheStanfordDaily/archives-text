# Moscone Introduces Pot Bill
## 
### RICHARD CHONG 
Legislation which would reduce the
crime of unlawful possession of "three
or less avoir-dupois ounces of
marijuana" to a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine of not more than
*sloo, has been introduced into the
California State Senate.
At present, unlawful possession of
marijuana, in any quantity, is
punishable as a felony. Backers of the
Senate bill, SB-95, introduced by Sen.
George Moscone (D-S.F.), hope it will
casual smokers who would not
have to suffer the pains involved with

a felony charge.
Unlawful furnishing of marijuana in
amounts of less than three ounces, also
a felony at present, would be reduced
to a misdemeanor. Two other related
offenses possession of any
paraphernalia unlawfully used to smoke
marijuana and being present in a place
with the knowledge that marijuana is
being smoked would both be
deleted entirely as criminal offenses.
Committee Votes Close
The Senate Judiciary Committee
hearing for the bill is set for Feb. 11.
Don Solem, Moscone's aide, admitted

that the committee vote will be close.
The vote presently stands at three
ayes, two nayes and six abstaining.
Should the bill pass the judiciary
committee, it would be placed on the
Senate floor for open discussion,
where 21 of 40 votes would be needed
to pass it. Here again, the votes are
speculated to be evenly divided.
If the bill is still alive in March, it
will enter the Assembly where it
should easily pass, according to Solem.
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., who
recently expressed favor for the
passage of the bill to Solem, must sign
SB-95 before the law can take effect.
Millions Spent Uselessly
Moscone, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, feels that
millions of dollars are uselessly spent
on enforcing the strict laws.
Victimless criminals marijuana
smokers, for example suffer the
pains and humiliation of being
detained, arrested and labeled by the
police, while our streets remain filled
with rapists, muggers and many
dangerous criminals, he said.
The money presently spent on
marijuana enforcement could be
transferred to apprehending hard
criminals if SB-95 is passed. Individual
users, who are not public nuisances,
would not have to fear punishment
and hassle resulting from the outdated
laws, Moscone said.


George Moscone
Many senators opposing the bill
fear that their chances for re-election
would be hurt should they vote in
favor of the legislation, Solem said.
However, if the Oregon marijuana
law, which SB-95 is modeled after, is
any indication of public response, the
public approves of greater leniency
towards marijuana users. None of the
Oregon statesmen who voted in favor
of the Oregon law and ran for
re-election, lost their office.
Solem admitted that another
argument against the bill concerns the
possibility of the law encouraging
further use of marijuana. Without
more conclusive evidence about the
effects of marijuana, increased
smoking could lead to dangers greater
than we now realize, he said.
Tests have been done on rats and
mice, and some have shown adverse
effects, including decreases in sexual
potency, with consistent use of
marijuana. Other test results, claiming
great harm involved with smoking,
have also appeared.
