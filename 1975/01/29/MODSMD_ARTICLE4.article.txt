# Housing Proposal
## Horton Defends Plan As 'Eminently 
### JOHN FREED 
A draft housing proposal which
requires students to choose one year
to live off campus is "eminently fair,"
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton declared last night.
Defending the plan on KZSU's
»Campus Conference , Horton said it
does not discriminate by sex.
"The proposal very clearly sets
forward a system of equal access for
men and women. We truly looked at
the entire housing system" to
formulate the proposal, he stated.
% Guarantees First-Year Housing
Horton expressed satisfaction that
the suggestion guarantees on-campus
housing to all first-year students
including transfer^.
"Every group which has studied the
[housing] problem has concluded that
students as a group are the
neediest They also have the lowest
priority" for spaces, he added.
Horton said he opposes extending a
fraternity-like housing system across
the entire campus, thus justifying the
proposal's omission of plans for
of the all-male fraternity
system, inclusion of co-educational
frats, or addition of sororities.
Subjective Selection For Men
"We are maintaining a system that
has a difference for men," Horton

admitted. "Because of certain
historical conditions, fraternities are
allowed subjective selection of
members. It's a privilege we are not
enthusiastic about extending."
The proposal would require each
fraternity to overcrowd its house by a
number of students proportional to
the demand for on-campus housing.
Individual frats which failed to meet
the quotas within two years would be
forced into the draw, although the
Inter-Fraternity Council has argued
that the system as a whole, not
individual frats, should be responsible
for meeting the quotas.
Frats Could Meet Quotas
"There's absolutely nothing wrong
with the [fraternity] system as a
whole meeting the quotas," Horton
conceded. "As a matter of
policy... we must have a proposal
which helps out a fraternity during a
bad year. However, we really want to
support the idea of fraternities as
'membership' [oriented] groups,
rather than as boarding houses."
Horton said the new system would
"put the burden on fraternities to
compete" for new members, but he
didn't expect them to have difficulties
filling their houses.
"I don't anticipate [fraternity]
houses taking in boarders because they
lack members," Horton concluded.

for meeting the quotas.
Frats Could Meet Quotas
"There's absolutely nothing wrong
with the [fraternity] system as a
whole meeting the quotas," Horton
conceded. "As a matter of
policy... we must have a proposal
which helps out a fraternity during a
bad year. However, we really want to
support the idea of fraternities as
'membership' [oriented] groups,
rather than as boarding houses."
Horton said the new system would
"put the burden on fraternities to
compete" for new members, but he
didn't expect them to have difficulties
filling their houses.
"I don't anticipate [fraternity]
houses taking in boarders because they
lack members," Horton concluded.
