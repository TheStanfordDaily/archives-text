# Parking Suits Filed On Behalf Of ASSU
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Individual and class action suits
have been filed in Santa Clara County
Superior Court against the University
on behalf of the ASSU to prevent
campus police from ticketing student
vehicles without parking stickers.
A class action suit by itself would
take less time, but "we want the
individual to be protected as far as the
tickets are concerned," said Kathy
Colson, president of the Escondido
Village Council.
The Council helped initiate the
action which was filed in court
Monday.
Dent Hand, attorney for the ASSU,
who talked about the case Monday
afternoon on KZSU, plans to challenge
the "legality of the state code" which
gives the University the right to charge
the parking fee assessment.
Section 2113 of the State Vehicle
Code "gives some groups the right to
make [traffic] laws," such as cities
and counties, according to Colson, but
these are representative organizations,
as opposed to the University, which is
private.
Since this section of the state
legislation has never been challenged, a
ruling on it will set a precedent,
according to Colson.
Michael Hudnall, an attorney for

the University, maintained that "the
University actions have all been
entirely legal. The vehicle code
sections referred to, specifically grants
any university in California the right
to adopt traffic regulations and
enforce them by law."
Hudnall has not yet seen the suits
which have been filed against the
University and declined to comment
on them.
At this point, Hand said that the
ruling could go either way. He hopes
to have the case in court by the end of
this week.
Meanwhile, an ASSU subcommittee
headed by ASSU Sen. Peter Winsemius,
a business school student, has written a
reply to Peter Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs and head
of the University committee on the
parking problem. The reply, along
with other recommendations from the
subcommittee will be considered by
the Senate tonight.
Director of Police Services Marvin
Herrington said, "We will continue
enforcing it until a court tells us
differently." He estimates that about
300-to-400 citations have been given
to students.
Carpenter will hold eight public
hearings to get public input on the
parking problems beginning tomorrow.

COSMIC BIRD - Known as "The Great Cosmic Bird Of The Universe" to cast,
crew and Trekkies, Star Trek executive producer Gene Roddenberry admitted
last night to having been known to television executives as "Crazy Gene."
Individual and class action suits
have been filed in Santa Clara County
Superior Court against the University
on behalf of the ASSU to prevent
campus police from ticketing student
vehicles without parking stickers.
A class action suit by itself would
take less time, but "we want the
individual to be protected as far as the
tickets are concerned," said Kathy
Colson, president of the Escondido
Village Council.
The Council helped initiate the
action which was filed in court
Monday.
Dent Hand, attorney for the ASSU,
who talked about the case Monday
afternoon on KZSU, plans to challenge
the "legality of the state code" which
gives the University the right to charge
the parking fee assessment.
Section 2113 of the State Vehicle
Code "gives some groups the right to
make [traffic] laws," such as cities
and counties, according to Colson, but
these are representative organizations,
as opposed to the University, which is
private.
Since this section of the state
legislation has never been challenged, a
ruling on it will set a precedent,
according to Colson.
Michael Hudnall, an attorney for

the University, maintained that "the
University actions have all been
entirely legal. The vehicle code
sections referred to, specifically grants
any university in California the right
to adopt traffic regulations and
enforce them by law."
Hudnall has not yet seen the suits
which have been filed against the
University and declined to comment
on them.
At this point, Hand said that the
ruling could go either way. He hopes
to have the case in court by the end of
this week.
Meanwhile, an ASSU subcommittee
headed by ASSU Sen. Peter Winsemius,
a business school student, has written a
reply to Peter Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs and head
of the University committee on the
parking problem. The reply, along
with other recommendations from the
subcommittee will be considered by
the Senate tonight.
Director of Police Services Marvin
Herrington said, "We will continue
enforcing it until a court tells us
differently." He estimates that about
300-to-400 citations have been given
to students.
Carpenter will hold eight public
hearings to get public input on the
parking problems beginning tomorrow.
