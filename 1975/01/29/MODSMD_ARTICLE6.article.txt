# SWOPSI, SCIRE Elimination
## Gibbs Assures Workshop Identity 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The University can offer innovative and controversial
workshops even if SWOPSI and SCIRE are eliminated,
James Gibbs, dean of undergraduate studies, told a group of
100 students yesterday.
Speaking at a lunch time discussion at Memorial Church,
Gibbs predicted that existing departments can incorporate
the same sort of programs into their curriculum, enabling
the University to save the administrative costs of the
current innovative programs.
"Many people concerned with the programs [SWOPSI
and SCIRE] think that without separateness the programs
will lose their identity," Gibbs explained. "But the real goal
[of such programs] is to find out something new about
education and then distribute what is learned throughout
the University."
UWP Can Be Absorbed
For example, Gibbs pointed out that the "functions of
the Undergraduate Writing Program (UWP) can be absorbed
into the English Department by the faculty's taking account
of what has been learned in the program.
"It is very clear that students learn a lot in
action-oriented workshops. But we need to save
administrative costs. One way to do this is to place the
functions of SWOPSI in the departments."
Gibbs urged students to "put pressure on social science
departments to implement innovative programs."
Although Gibbs acknowledged that "there is a lot of
skepticism" among faculty members about such innovative

programs, he expressed confidence that some professors
would organize and instruct them.
When asked how students could pressure departments,
Gibbs recommended speaking to the dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences and to department chairmen.
Gibbs suggested that courses such as introductory
political science be put together with workshops relating to
the curriculum. Faculty members could supervise
para-faculty members, Gibbs explained.
Resentment Of Para-Faculty
Faculty members have resented the presense of
para-faculty members in the past, Gibbs conceded.
But the University's new financial problems will change
this attitude, as faculty members recognize the need to hire
low-cost faculty members to relieve their teaching load,
Gibbs predicted.
Several students insisted that controversial projects such
as SWOPSI's critical investigation of Stanford's ties to the
defense industry and student-faculty relations would never
receive departmental encouragement.
In reply, Gibbs argued that "SWOPSI is not the only
place where people stick their necks out to do controversial
things."
Gradual Phase Out
Gibbs explained that the decision to gradually phase out
SWOPSI and SCIRE with the option of saving them is
evidence that the Office of Undergraduate Studies wants to
insure that individual departments will preserve the
