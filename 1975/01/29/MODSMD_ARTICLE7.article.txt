To The Dollies!
Editor:
The weekend before last was a
very "happy" one indeed.
Stanford's two basketball victories
were the most exciting thing to
happen here since Big Game.
However, in the Daily section
of Jan. 22 entitled "Personalities
On A Happy Weekend," I would
like to know why you excluded
certain "personalities" most
worthy of attention on your
pages. As for the University of
Second Choice's stunning
song-girl, who cares if she is "the
most often photographed
cheerleader in the country"? Does
the Daily feel obligated to print
another picture of her because of
that distinction? What about
giving Stanford fans a picture of
the Daily's least-photographed yet
very deserving individuals, the
Stanford Dollies?
Since the beginning of school
in September, you have
occasionally given the LSJUMB
the attention it deserves, but
never has a picture or article been
printed concerning the Dollies.
Why?
I for one believe they add
enjoyment to rallies, football and
basketball games with their
appearance and dancing talent.
This year's Dollies have over 60
routines, spend many hours in
preparation for performances and
are themselves truly
Incomparable. At those games
alone they looked and danced far
better than any of the bouncing
beauties from USC or UCLA.
Why not give the Dollies credit
for all they do, and fans a
long-awaited surprise? There are
several home basketball games
remaining at which the Red Vest
Band and Dollies will appear. I
just hope your choice in
photographic scenery will
improve.

Register To Vote
Editor:
I want to express the hope that
those Stanford students who
would ordinarily choose to vote at
Stanford rather than their home
localities will register to vote prior
to the pending deadline of Jan. 30,
1975. There are important issues
on the Santa Clara County ballot
on March 4.
The fact that Stanford students
made the difference in a crucial
election last June has achieved
national attention. As we pursue
the difficult path toward better
and more honest government, I
would hope that local elections
will receive the same student
attention and educated judgment.
Thank you for the opportunity
to express this view and for the
efforts of the students who gave
me the chance to serve in
Congress at this critical time in
our history.

'Wrenching Shock'
Editor:
It was a wrenching shock to
learn that Religious Studies
Prof. Jerry Irish has been
fired.
For years I have watched him
devote himself to the students at
Stanford, have watched him and
his wife give of thier caring, their
counsel, their home. During the
four years I have worked on
campus, I have talked to countless
students in whose lives Jerry Irish
has made a difference. Without

exception, the students expressed
their deep admiration at his drive
and his creativity in the
classroom, at his availability for
discussion, at his willingness to
work and to help.
Their friends watched, long
distance, when Lee Irish died
while the Irishes were at Stanford
in Germany. We expected them to
come home this was the second
son they had lost in two years
but Pat and Jerry sent word to us
that since it was mid-quarter, they
were staying to finish.
Irish has not yet published a
book. His literary output is now
growing and his scholarly
potential has been attested to by
his Department colleagues and by
eminent men, in his field , from
prestigious universities. But Jerry
Irish has not yet published a
book. He was given the Gores
Award for Excellence in Teaching,
and no one contests his
outstanding record as a superb
teacher.
Students: is the message clear?

Denunciation Denied
Editor:
It was heartening to see several
facets of the peace struggle lined
up together on one page ("Is the
'Movement' Dead? Well, Not
Exactly;" Daily, Jan. 24). It was
good of Sue Luttner to dispel the
deliberately nurtured illusion that
the student movement was never
effective and has not disappeared
entirely.
One statement made in that
article was erroneous and must be
clarified. The article claims that
Don Luce and Bui Van Dao, who
spoke at Stanford last week,
"denounced the Paris Peace
Agreement of 1973." Nothing
could be more opposite the truth.
Luce and Dao called for the
implementation of the Peace
Agreement and denounced
violations of the Agreement by
the U.S. and the Thieu
government. This fact is very
important.

Placing The Blame
Editor:
James Markham of the New
York Times noted on Feb. 19,
1974:
"One of the most striking
things to a visitor here
[Provisional Revolutionary
Government area of Binh Dinh
Province] is the exaltation of the
accords, which occupy a place in
public proclamations and
propaganda that sometimes seem
to rival the stature of the revered
last testament of Ho Chi Minh.
The agreements are 'cheered' and
'welcomed' on flowered arches
that dot footpaths in the district.
All propaganda hinges on them.
Hand-written copies hang from
the walls of village offices."
Meanwhile President Thieu of
South Vietnam has stated:
"Wherever we protect ourselves
effectively by wiping out the
regular units of the Communist
forces as well as annihilating the
cadres in the Communist
infrastructure, that is the place
which we can regard as having
peace." Thieu has confiscated
papers for printing the peace
agreement!
Whose fault is it that the peace
accords have not been
implemented?
