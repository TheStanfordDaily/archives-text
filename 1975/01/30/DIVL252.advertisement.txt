TOO MANY CARS. NOT ENOUGH PARKING.
EVERYBODY HAS OPINIONS, AND I'D
LIKE TO NEAR THEM
Think about it:
How important are reserved stickers?
Is parking a right or a privilege?
Or a fringe benefit?
Can we stand all those cars and all that asphalt?
FACULTY, THIS IS YOUR DAY TO BE HEARD.
I've been asked to re-examine the parking and transportation
system and recommend changes. To do this, I need your input
There will be a public meeting today at 4 p.m. in Bishop Aud

want to hear from THE FACULTY.
THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.
