# Senate Asks Lyman's Aid On Parking
## 
### DAN PYNE STEVE BECKELMAN 
# The ASSU Senate voted last night
to appeal to President Richard Lyman
for intervention in the current parking
fee controversy.
A resolution approved by the
Senate stated that the appeal is needed
"so that an adversary relationship
[between students and administrators]
is not created unnecessarily."
Kathy Colson, president of the
Escondido Village Council, said after
the meeting that University lawyers
had contacted lawyers for the students
to ascertain the conditions under
which the suit could be dropped.
Colson stated that the University
would have to stop ticketing and
suspend the $7.50 parking fee.
Grounds Of Suit
Sen. Mike Lindsey told the Senate
that the class-action suit was being
filed on two grounds. The first argues
; that students "never agreed, upon
entering the University, to make a
parking contract," and that residents
of University housing have already
technically paid for parking areas.
The second argument is a
"constitutional one," Lindsey said,
involving a question of "excessive
grant of authority to the University."
After some debate, the Senate also
voted to donate $lOO to the Bay Area
Walk-a-thon, supported by the African
Famine Relief Committee. The funds
are to be used for sponsorship of
Stanford students participating in the
walk.
No 'Battle'
The Senate declined, however, to
challenge the University of California
to a "fund-raising battle," noting that
Berkeley already has 1000 students
planning to participate in the
walk-a-thon scheduled for Saturday.
Charles Ogletree, chairman of the
African Relief Committee, said that
most of the money raised will be used
for immediate relief of famine victims
in India and Africa, and a small
amount will be diverted to local food
distribution organizations.
The Senate also adopted a
resolution to invite James Gibbs, dean
of undergraduate studies, and Provost
William F. Miller "to participate in an
open forum on the issue of
extra-departmental cuts and answer
questions from a panel of students."
