# The
						University: Money And Models

### John McCarthy 
Here are some notes on the Faculty
Senate meeting of Jan. 23 and what it implies
for the future of Stanford. President Lyman
started by saying that difficult financial
situations tended to have divisive effects and
that unity (of the Stanford community) was
needed. No one disputed this.
On the agenda was a week old resolution
by Human-Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh to
the general effect that the Faculty Senate
should develop its own opinion of the
distribution of budget cuts. Its third
paragraph was:
"It is the sense of the Senate that, in
general, the University's effectiveness in
discharging its primary functions now, and its
resilence to face further challenge, will be less
threatened by a reduction in the generous
support services it now enjoys than by any
fiscally comparable economy acheived by
curtailment of the academic program itself."
Pittendrigh said he was sorry that some
people had interpreted the resolution as
expressing a lack of confidence in the
administration. Several speakers then said
that the paragraph might offend the staff and
administration, and the Senate voted to
strike it. I then left, and I don't know what
happened next.
Salaries Compared
In back of Pittendrigh's resolution is the
fact that Stanford currently spends $2l
million per year out of general funds on
administration and service salaries and $l5
million on faculty pay. Service costs passed
academic costs in the middle 19605, have
risen four times as fast since 1960 and are
projected to continue rising faster than
academic costs, reaching $3l million vs. $2l
million by 1980.
There are two ways one can look at an
institution like a university (two models of
institutions, to use social science language).
The first is as a community including various

groups, i.e., faculty, students and staff, with
varying interests, and having a policy aimed
at advancing the joint interests of the groups
and mediating their differences. In crisis
times, unity is essentials From the
community point of view, Lyman's call for
unity was most appropriate, and the Senate
was right in voting down Pittendrigh's
potentially divisive paragraph.
The second kind of institution is one
created and maintained by society for a
purpose. A university is then for the
advancement and propagation of knowledge,
and the relative emphasis given to its
activities are such as will best advance this
purpose. From this point of view,
Pittendrigh's paragraph was appropriate if
true. Since its truth was not debated only
whether it was divisive we must conclude
that the members of the Senate majority had
the community aspect of Stanford
uppermost in their minds.
People who found universities take the
purpose view. That is why they set up boards
of .trustees rather than democratically elected
Community bodies. They hope the trustees
will hold the institution to its purpose
uncorrupted by having something personal to
gain or by commitments to colleagues.
More A Community?
When an institution becomes uncertain of
its purpose, it may tend to regard itself more
as a community, and the President's speech
showed it. If Stanford is mainly a
community, the following considerations
apply: it depends a lot on donations, and the
donors like to think their donations advance
some purpose, so at least lip service to
purpose has to be given.
The community should view tolerantly
the basically harmless personal commitment
of many of its members to advancing and
propagating knowledge insofar as their
numbers warrant the expenditure of

community resources, and these members
don't ask the community to do anything
contrary to the welfare of other members.
However, the tenure system that requires
some faculty to leave after six yeras just
because they haven't advanced knowledge
enough contradicts the spirit of community.
If external support is too hard to get, the
community could liquidate the University;
dividing the $3OO million being raised by the
Campaign for Stanford into three equal parts
would give each student $lO,OOO, each staff
member $20,000 and each faculty member
$lOO,OOO, not counting what the campus
would fetch.
However, if the purpose model fits
Stanford, then Pittendrigh was too mild,
though evidently he knew his audience.
Stanford must reverse the growth of service
and administrative costs. A good general goal
is the ratio of service to academic personnel
expense that existed in 1960 supplemented
by comparing Stanford's costs with those of
the most economical other institutions.
Different institutions make the transition to
over-administration at different times and
some haven't yet; for many years, Berkeley's
administration attracted faculty to Stanford.
The Stanford administration is certainly
making some effort to reduce service
expenses, though maybe people displaced or
absorbed by expanding another service.
However, the President and Provost won't
easily dismantle offices they have lovingly
created, nor will they get the assistance they
need with a slogan of "unity" addressed to a
Community-minded Faculty Senate. Maybe
they will get it from the Trustees, since that
is what the Trustees are for. They many need
the assistance given by a policeman who told
a jury I was on in a drunk driving case, "We
assisted Mr. X into the patrol car."
