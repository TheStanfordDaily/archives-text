# University May Lose Uniqueness'
## 
### Richard Mills 
The University is in extreme
financial trouble. We have heard
this, but we may not yet realize
the full implications of our plight.
Every department and branch
of the University has been asked
by the administration to prepare a
priority ranking of its various
program expenditures and itemize
what would have to be cut to
meet each year's monetary
cutback requirements. Of the 17
percent three-year total cutback,
25 percent is to be made next
year and 65 percent the year
after.
The first figures in indicate
that even after every single item
not part of the "essential core" of
the University is eliminated, it is
possible that the cutback
requirements will still not be
reached.
The present battle to save
SCIRE, SWOPSI and the Urban
Studies Program is indicative of
many things to come. Whole
departments may be phased out
two are now up for the block in
the engineering school.
The physical education
department cut baseball,
basketball and football down to
the minimum necessary for
survival, and wrestling will
probably be altogether dropped.
'Unique Character' Ending?
I am fearful that the unique
character of Stanford that comes
in part from its opportunities for
diverse experience and progressive
experiment in education will be
destroyed.
If all that remains is the
"essential academic core" as
defined by the administration,
much of the reason for this
private school, with its $3BOO

(and rising) tuition, will also be
gone. For Stanford's prestige can
not rest entirely on public
relations; at some point it must be
dependent on reality.
All of which brings me to ask if
anything can be done. Indeed,
Stanford will be cutting to its
"core." But who now defines
what makes up this "core?" Not
students, not the Stanford
community, not society. The
various priority rankings are
funneled into the Provost's Office,
and eventually will go to President
Lyman, who has the final
authority.

The Administration has a well
set concept of what makes up the
heart of a University. Perhaps it is
now time that we reflect more on
what the "core" of a University in
today's society should be. This
demands student input, for one,
but students have not been asked
on any significant scale for their
input.
The one opportunity these
times of economic crisis give is the
chance to form an adjusted
"core." We have to cut back, and
this gives us the political means to
finally drop what is out-of-date.
I state no specifics. But the

whole of the Stanford
community, and most especially
the student body, needs to think
now about large scale directions
and priorities for the University
and state their opinions. And it is
critical that the Administration
listen to and evaluate this
feedback.
To modify an overused
analogy, before we blindly cut
away the fat from the meat, we
must turn on the lights to
determine which portions are the
fat and which the meat.
