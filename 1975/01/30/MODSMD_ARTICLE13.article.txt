# 'Writing On The Wall'

### George Collier 
Those of us concerned by
decisions like the denial of tenure
to Jerry Irish would do well to
reread the Report of the
Committee on the Professoriate
which articulates the rationale and
the rhetoric of such decisions.
The document was distributed
widely last year and contained a
general appraisal of the nature of
the Stanford professoriate as well
as specific recommendations acted
upon by the Senate last year and
early this year. Debate on the
document in the Senate never
really questioned the underlying
assumptions about the Stanford
professoriate. Those assumptions
justified criteria for tenure that
could easily exclude any of us
except the Nobel Laureates.
Presentation of the Report to
the Senate by the Committee on
the Professoriate members made
clear their conclusion that
younger faculty should closet
themselves up as much as
necessary to prove without
question their productivity and
calibre as researchers and scholars.
The committee places the
emphasis on the substantial
weight to be placed on teaching; it
depicted University service as
relatively unimportant when
compared to teaching and
research.
I am sure that the Report is
seen as justifiication for current
policies on tenure decisions. No
one will question the rhetoric of
the report, for everyone is for
excellence. How the rhetoric is
used is a different matter, for
"excellence" can be stretched or
squeezed to fit the case.
Rhetoric At Root
It is clear to me that the
rhetoric is at the root of the
difficulties surrounding tenure
decisions, and that attempts to
think through these problems
should focus on how to apply the
rhetoric to specific cases in a more
human manner.
Unviersity policy is definitly
veering toward the elitist
conception of the faculty
represented by the Report , if
Prof. Lewis Spitz's remarks quoted
in the Daily of Jan. 27 are to be
taken as a measure. Apropos of
his comments about University
service as a means for a junior
faculty member's
self-agrandizement, it is worth
note that the Committee on
Committees has recognized the
danger to younger faculty of
service on University committees
in its policy of passing them over
for committee appointments.
The Committee on Committees
has recognized the message
implicit in the Report of the
Committee on the Professoriate
that University service will be
interpreted by some as showing
frivolous intent, or lack of
seriousness of junior faculty.
These attitudes do an injustice, I
feel, to those of us, women as well
as men, who serve on University
committees at the urgent behest
of our tenured colleagues,
contributing unstintingly and
professionally to the University
endeavor.
The writing is on the wall for
all junior faculty members and is
easy to read in the Report of the
Committee on the Professoriate.
Obviously such decisions as in the
Jerry Irish case should cause us to
direct our attention to the
assumptions and conclusions of
this document, which surely is
looked to as exemplifying current
University policy.
