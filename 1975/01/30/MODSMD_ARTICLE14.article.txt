# On Brown, Reagan And Credibility
## 
### Bob Beverly 
One nonsensical thing about Gov.
Brown's proposed "no nonsense budget" is
his claim that it increases state spending by
only 4.3 percent, a rate of growth which
would make Ronald Reagan look like a
spendthrift if it were true.
But it simply isn't. The more accurate
measure of growth is placed at nearly 10
percent by the Legislature's impartial budget
analyst.
Brown arrives at the whimsical figure of
4.3 percent by (1) carrying forward
unexpended dollars, (2) deferring capital
outlay and bond expenditures, (3)
transferring dollars from special funds to the
General Fund and (4) comparing apples with
oranges. Such accounting gymnastics are only
unusual in their assembled variety; he's used
the whole bag of tricks to make a good
picture even better.
In this instance, the "apples" are next
year's proposed budget figures ($11.3

billion), and the "oranges" are this year's
revised budget figures ($lO.B billion),
producing a distorted growth in spending of
4.3 percent.
Disregarding the other fiscal gimmicks
which tend to further distort the picture, one
need only compare this year's proposed
budget with last year's proposed budget to
show a growth rate of 15.2 percent (Reagan's
initial proposed spending program was $9.81
billion for 1974-75).
However, such a counter-claim is, itself,
something less that totally accurate, because
Reagan made some significant increases
before signing the 1974-75 budget.
The budget signed into law by Reagan last
July 1 totaled $10.17 billion; Brown's
proposed budget is 11 percent over this
figure. The revised estimate for total
expenditures for the fiscal year 1974-75 is,
again, $lO.B billion, the figure Brown has
chosen as his benchmark.

At the bottom line, what is really
significant is not the proposed budget, nor
the Legislature's version of the budget, nor
even the budget the Governor finally signs
into law. What is significant is the total, real
expenditures recorded by fiscal year's end.
Thus, for Brown to retain his credibility
he must do more than make a spalsh: he
must carry that splash forward like a tidal
wave through fiscal year 1975-76 and,
indeed, show (if he pleases) a cosmetic
increase of only 4.3 percent and a real
increase of 9.8 to 10 percent in actual
spending when the next fiscal year closes out
some 17 months from now in June, 1976.
In short, to match his budget-message
rhetoric with action, he will have to use the
veto and the blue pencil like they've seldom
been used before.

the whole bag of tricks to make a good
picture even better.
In this instance, the "apples" are next
year's proposed budget figures ($11.3

billion), and the "oranges" are this year's
revised budget figures ($lO.B billion),
producing a distorted growth in spending of
4.3 percent.
Disregarding the other fiscal gimmicks
which tend to further distort the picture, one
need only compare this year's proposed
budget with last year's proposed budget to
show a growth rate of 15.2 percent (Reagan's
initial proposed spending program was $9.81
billion for 1974-75).
However, such a counter-claim is, itself,
something less that totally accurate, because
Reagan made some significant increases
before signing the 1974-75 budget.
The budget signed into law by Reagan last
July 1 totaled $10.17 billion; Brown's
proposed budget is 11 percent over this
figure. The revised estimate for total
expenditures for the fiscal year 1974-75 is,
again, $lO.B billion, the figure Brown has
chosen as his benchmark.

At the bottom line, what is really
significant is not the proposed budget, nor
the Legislature's version of the budget, nor
even the budget the Governor finally signs
into law. What is significant is the total, real
expenditures recorded by fiscal year's end.
Thus, for Brown to retain his credibility
he must do more than make a spalsh: he
must carry that splash forward like a tidal
wave through fiscal year 1975-76 and,
indeed, show (if he pleases) a cosmetic
increase of only 4.3 percent and a real
increase of 9.8 to 10 percent in actual
spending when the next fiscal year closes out
some 17 months from now in June, 1976.
In short, to match his budget-message
rhetoric with action, he will have to use the
veto and the blue pencil like they've seldom
been used before.

One nonsensical thing about Gov.
Brown's proposed "no nonsense budget" is
his claim that it increases state spending by
only 4.3 percent, a rate of growth which
would make Ronald Reagan look like a
spendthrift if it were true.
But it simply isn't. The more accurate
measure of growth is placed at nearly 10
percent by the Legislature's impartial budget
analyst.
Brown arrives at the whimsical figure of
4.3 percent by (1) carrying forward
unexpended dollars, (2) deferring capital
outlay and bond expenditures, (3)
transferring dollars from special funds to the
General Fund and (4) comparing apples with
oranges. Such accounting gymnastics are only
unusual in their assembled variety; he's used
the whole bag of tricks to make a good
picture even better.
In this instance, the "apples" are next
year's proposed budget figures ($11.3

billion), and the "oranges" are this year's
revised budget figures ($lO.B billion),
producing a distorted growth in spending of
4.3 percent.
