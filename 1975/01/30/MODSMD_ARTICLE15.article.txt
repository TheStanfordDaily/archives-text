### Patty Fels 
Spme sadist replaced the Mountain Dew in
the vending machines with a foul-tasting
brew called, appropriately enough, Bubble
Up. As a Mountain Dew addict, I have lost
my true love, my raison d'etre, and am
now nursing my withdrawal pains with
coffee. What was the reason for this
change? —P.G.
If you really want your raison d'etre
back, there is something you can do.
Mountain Dew was cruelly ousted from the
Stanford vending machines by Marv
Krueger, route supervisor for Canteen
Corporation. According to him, Bubble Up
is now outselling Mountain Dew
(incidentally, Bubble Up is also cheaper)
and he sees no reason to replace it. He
explained that they routinely switch drinks
in the vending machines and try to have at
least one "light" drink per machine.
Therefore, they will never have both
drinks.
He did admit, however, that they've had
three or four requests for Mountain Dew
and would change it if there were an
overwhelming mandate of the people. So
call him at 326-9182, preferably in the
morning, and complain. Leave a message if
he's out.
Dr. Pepper addicts might be interested
to know that Belfast Beverages, the
company that supplies the Canteen

machines, also makes Dr. Pepper. Harold
Lynch, district manager of the vending
department, said that it could also be
available in the machines if anyone wanted
it. If you're interested, contact Krueger.
Other drinks handled by Belfast
Beverages include Mug root beer, Diet
Pepsi, and various fruit flavors
strawberry, black cherry, grape, etc.
Why doesn't UGLY renew books over the
phone? —H.D.
Guy Deßall, head of circulation and
reserve services at UGLY said that the
policy not to renew over the phone is
actually a protection for students.
"We're saying to the faculty, 'We do not
want our books disappearing into your
studies forever,'" Deßall said. "If you
make it too easy for faculty, their
secretaries will simply keep those books
and not call in to renew them." Therefore,
faculty, as well as undergraduates, must
bring in books every two weeks to renew
them.
However, there are advantages to the
system. Books can be renewed indefinitely
so long as no one else puts a hold on them.
And the library rarely fines students whose
books are fewer than six days overdue.
"We try to avoid the little old lady
librarian attitude," Deßall said.
Why, with the University's money troubles,

did Wilbur have 120 metal doors installed
in the bathroom stalls? —C.L.
Those doors are a response to eight
years of whining by Wilbur residents and
other assorted people, including summer
students and conference participants living
in Wilbur. Alan Cummings, residence
manager at Wilbur, said that the University
had long been concerned with the lack of
privacy in Wilbur and Stern bathroom stalls
(which are covered by only a curtain) and
finally did something about it during
Christmas vacation.
The 120 heavy-duty metal doors were
installed in eight Wilbur and four Stern
houses by Redwood Plumbing at a cost of
$14,000. Now many residents are
complaining that the thick doors make the
stalls unusable by anyone over
five-foot-six. Therefore, the University is
now busy taking them off.
"The people who tested out the design
for the doors felt that while it was a little
bit crowded, it was workable, and that's
why we went ahead and did it," Cummings
said. "Some students have requested that
the doors be taken off and we have done
that. We'll put them up at the end of the
year for summer. If people prefer not to
have the privacy then, we'll just leave them
off."
The funds for the whole operation came

from University room and board fees,
Cummings said.
Who was the shortest President of the
United States? Who was the tallest?—R.M.N.
James Madison (1809-1817) was the
shortest. The tallest was Abraham Lincoln
(1861-1865). Incidentally, the most
corpulent president was William Howard
Taft (1909-1913). Taft, who weighted in
excess of 300 pounds, once got stuck in a
White House bathtub. A larger tub was
subsequently constructed especially for
Taft, who later became Chief Justice of the
United States. No link has been established
between the bathtub incident and the
appointment.

it. If you're interested, contact Krueger.

Why doesn't UGLY renew books over the
phone? —H.D.
Guy Deßall, head of circulation and
reserve services at UGLY said that the
policy not to renew over the phone is
actually a protection for students.
"We're saying to the faculty, 'We do not
want our books disappearing into your
studies forever,'" Deßall said. "If you
make it too easy for faculty, their
secretaries will simply keep those books
and not call in to renew them." Therefore,
faculty, as well as undergraduates, must
bring in books every two weeks to renew
them.
However, there are advantages to the
system. Books can be renewed indefinitely
so long as no one else puts a hold on them.
And the library rarely fines students whose
books are fewer than six days overdue.
"We try to avoid the little old lady
librarian attitude," Deßall said.
Why, with the University's money troubles,

did Wilbur have 120 metal doors installed
in the bathroom stalls? —C.L.
Those doors are a response to eight
years of whining by Wilbur residents and
other assorted people, including summer
students and conference participants living
in Wilbur. Alan Cummings, residence
manager at Wilbur, said that the University
had long been concerned with the lack of
privacy in Wilbur and Stern bathroom stalls
(which are covered by only a curtain) and
finally did something about it during
Christmas vacation.
The 120 heavy-duty metal doors were
installed in eight Wilbur and four Stern
houses by Redwood Plumbing at a cost of
$14,000. Now many residents are
complaining that the thick doors make the
stalls unusable by anyone over
five-foot-six. Therefore, the University is
now busy taking them off.
"The people who tested out the design
for the doors felt that while it was a little
bit crowded, it was workable, and that's
why we went ahead and did it," Cummings
said. "Some students have requested that
the doors be taken off and we have done
that. We'll put them up at the end of the
year for summer. If people prefer not to
have the privacy then, we'll just leave them
off."
The funds for the whole operation came

from University room and board fees,
Cummings said.
Who was the shortest President of the
United States? Who was the tallest?—R.M.N.
James Madison (1809-1817) was the
shortest. The tallest was Abraham Lincoln
(1861-1865). Incidentally, the most
corpulent president was William Howard
Taft (1909-1913). Taft, who weighted in
excess of 300 pounds, once got stuck in a
White House bathtub. A larger tub was
subsequently constructed especially for
Taft, who later became Chief Justice of the
United States. No link has been established
between the bathtub incident and the
appointment.

DRY? - Ever wonder what happened to the cans of Mountain Dew
that used to be staples in campus vending machines? Today's "Bug
Me" examines that sticky situation.
Spme sadist replaced the Mountain Dew in
the vending machines with a foul-tasting
brew called, appropriately enough, Bubble
Up. As a Mountain Dew addict, I have lost
my true love, my raison d'etre, and am
now nursing my withdrawal pains with
coffee. What was the reason for this
change? —P.G.
If you really want your raison d'etre
back, there is something you can do.
Mountain Dew was cruelly ousted from the
Stanford vending machines by Marv
Krueger, route supervisor for Canteen
Corporation. According to him, Bubble Up
is now outselling Mountain Dew
(incidentally, Bubble Up is also cheaper)
and he sees no reason to replace it. He
explained that they routinely switch drinks
in the vending machines and try to have at
least one "light" drink per machine.
Therefore, they will never have both
drinks.
He did admit, however, that they've had
three or four requests for Mountain Dew
and would change it if there were an
overwhelming mandate of the people. So
call him at 326-9182, preferably in the
morning, and complain. Leave a message if
he's out.
Dr. Pepper addicts might be interested
to know that Belfast Beverages, the
company that supplies the Canteen

machines, also makes Dr. Pepper. Harold
Lynch, district manager of the vending
department, said that it could also be
available in the machines if anyone wanted
it. If you're interested, contact Krueger.

had long been concerned with the lack of
privacy in Wilbur and Stern bathroom stalls
(which are covered by only a curtain) and
finally did something about it during
Christmas vacation.
The 120 heavy-duty metal doors were
installed in eight Wilbur and four Stern
houses by Redwood Plumbing at a cost of
$14,000. Now many residents are
complaining that the thick doors make the
stalls unusable by anyone over
five-foot-six. Therefore, the University is
now busy taking them off.
"The people who tested out the design
for the doors felt that while it was a little
bit crowded, it was workable, and that's
why we went ahead and did it," Cummings
said. "Some students have requested that
the doors be taken off and we have done
that. We'll put them up at the end of the
year for summer. If people prefer not to
have the privacy then, we'll just leave them
off."
The funds for the whole operation came

from University room and board fees,
Cummings said.
Who was the shortest President of the
United States? Who was the tallest?—R.M.N.
James Madison (1809-1817) was the
shortest. The tallest was Abraham Lincoln
(1861-1865). Incidentally, the most
corpulent president was William Howard
Taft (1909-1913). Taft, who weighted in
excess of 300 pounds, once got stuck in a
White House bathtub. A larger tub was
subsequently constructed especially for
Taft, who later became Chief Justice of the
United States. No link has been established
between the bathtub incident and the
appointment.

DRY? - Ever wonder what happened to the cans of Mountain Dew
that used to be staples in campus vending machines? Today's "Bug
Me" examines that sticky situation.
Spme sadist replaced the Mountain Dew in
the vending machines with a foul-tasting
brew called, appropriately enough, Bubble
Up. As a Mountain Dew addict, I have lost
my true love, my raison d'etre, and am
now nursing my withdrawal pains with
coffee. What was the reason for this
change? —P.G.
If you really want your raison d'etre
back, there is something you can do.
Mountain Dew was cruelly ousted from the
Stanford vending machines by Marv
Krueger, route supervisor for Canteen
Corporation. According to him, Bubble Up
is now outselling Mountain Dew
(incidentally, Bubble Up is also cheaper)
and he sees no reason to replace it. He
explained that they routinely switch drinks
in the vending machines and try to have at
least one "light" drink per machine.
Therefore, they will never have both
drinks.
He did admit, however, that they've had
three or four requests for Mountain Dew
and would change it if there were an
overwhelming mandate of the people. So
call him at 326-9182, preferably in the
morning, and complain. Leave a message if
he's out.
Dr. Pepper addicts might be interested
to know that Belfast Beverages, the
company that supplies the Canteen

machines, also makes Dr. Pepper. Harold
Lynch, district manager of the vending
department, said that it could also be
available in the machines if anyone wanted
it. If you're interested, contact Krueger.
Other drinks handled by Belfast
Beverages include Mug root beer, Diet
Pepsi, and various fruit flavors
strawberry, black cherry, grape, etc.
Why doesn't UGLY renew books over the
phone? —H.D.
Guy Deßall, head of circulation and
reserve services at UGLY said that the
policy not to renew over the phone is
actually a protection for students.
"We're saying to the faculty, 'We do not
want our books disappearing into your
studies forever,'" Deßall said. "If you
make it too easy for faculty, their
secretaries will simply keep those books
and not call in to renew them." Therefore,
faculty, as well as undergraduates, must
bring in books every two weeks to renew
them.
However, there are advantages to the
system. Books can be renewed indefinitely
so long as no one else puts a hold on them.
And the library rarely fines students whose
books are fewer than six days overdue.
"We try to avoid the little old lady
librarian attitude," Deßall said.
Why, with the University's money troubles,

did Wilbur have 120 metal doors installed
in the bathroom stalls? —C.L.
Those doors are a response to eight
years of whining by Wilbur residents and
other assorted people, including summer
students and conference participants living
in Wilbur. Alan Cummings, residence
manager at Wilbur, said that the University
had long been concerned with the lack of
privacy in Wilbur and Stern bathroom stalls
(which are covered by only a curtain) and
