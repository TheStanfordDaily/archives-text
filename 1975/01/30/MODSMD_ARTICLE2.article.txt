# Harris Preaches Populism

### MARK FUNK 
Democratic presidential aspirant
Fred Harris, former senator from
Oklahoma, brought his roadshow to
this area last night, speaking to a
gathering of 100 supporters in
Mountain View on subjects ranging
from the Ford administration to his
old home town.
A self-styled populist, the
44-year-old Harris said he was the one
Democratic candidate for the White
House who could pull the divergent
elements of his party together.

"I feel that my campaign has just as
much appeal to people who support
[George] Wallace as people who were
for [George] McGovern in 1972,"
Harris said. "We can present a united
front in '76."
Ford 'Very Dangerous'
That front would be directed at the
Ford administration. "I think that
Gerald Ford, because he preaches
more of the old line religion on
economics, is very dangerous."
"He's probably worse than Richard
Nixon was," Harris added. "Really,
the economy didn't sour because he
[Nixon] was distracted by Watergatf.
It's in much better shape because he
was."
Harris referred to figures just
released by the Library of Congress to
support his assertion that the Ford
economic program would spell disaster
for the country. He said Ford's
surcharge on energy would raise food,
gasoline and other essential items
nearly $5O billion.
"But Ford's proposed tax rebate is
going to be only $l2 billion," Harris
complained. "All that's going to do for
the people is deepen inflation."
Larger Rebate
Harris proposed an even larger
rebate than Ford's. "I feel that any
rebate should be between $2O-28
billion. We have to give more money
to the people."
Speaking in an earthy southwestern
accent, Harris labeled himself a
"people's" candidate. And he
prompted that image by spinning
homilies to interested listeners in the
packed Mountain View home. He
talked about his childhood ("I picked
cotton when I was just a boy") and his

wife's home town ("People can walk
out of the newspaper's circulation
district").
But he saved some of his most
persuasive talk for people who
harbored memories of his abortive
campaign for president in 1972.
Two Big Changes
Claiming that two important
changes have occurred in the U.S.
since then, Harris said that people are
now talking about issues he was raising
two years ago.
First, "the attitude of the people
has changed," Harris said. "Now
they're talking about the economy and
the monopolistic tendencies of
corporations."
"You know," he continued, "if we
had real competition here the Library
of Congress figures that prices would
drop by 20 percent."
The other change Harris said would
enable him to run a viable campaign is
new campaign funding laws passed by
Congress this year. One law guarantees
major party candidates a maximum of
$2O million for campaign war chests.
