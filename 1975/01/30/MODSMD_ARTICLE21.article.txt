Oakland Bombing Attempt Foiled
WASHINGTON The departments of Interior and
Treasury were evacuated and several other federal
installations searched yesterday because of further bomb
threats in the wake of an explosion at the State Department
and an attempted bombing in Oakland.
An anonymous male caller told The Associated Press at
midday that bombs would go off at the Smithsonian
Institution, the Departments of Agriculture and Interior
before the day was out. The Treasury Department received
a separate call which warned "the Treasury will go up in
smoke in half an hour."
The man left it doubtful whether he was part of the
same group, the Weather Underground, which took credit
for the bombing at the State Department and the planting
of a device in Oakland which was found and destroyed by
demolition experts as it ticked away.
Those actions were represented as protests of
continued U.S. support of the war in Southeast Asia.
Economic Index Falls Rapidly
WASHINGTON The government index designed to
forecast economic trends signaled deepening distress with
an unprecedented dive to close out last year, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday.
The index of leading indicators fell at a record monthly
pace for the second time in three months and also logged
the deepest sustained drop since the index was created in
1948.
November's drop was 3.5 percent, surpassing
September's 3.3 percent record. For December, the drop
was 2.4 percent. And for the five consecutive months the
index has fallen, the over-all decline measured 11 percent.
U.S.S.R. Cancels U.S. Wheat Deal
NEW YORK The Soviet Union has canceled the
purchase of 100,000 tons of wheat from Cook Industries
Inc. of Memphis, Tenn. and is negotiating for the
cancellation of another 100,000 tons, industry observers
said yesterday.
Cook, the country's largest grain exporter, refused to
deny or confirm the reports.

Continental Grain Co. of New York, the other firm
involved in th° wheat sale to Russia last fall, said through a
spokesman "we are awaiting word from the people we
are doing business with" regarding its remaining shipments.
Rhodes: Nixon Might Help GOP
WASHINGTON House Republican leader John J.
Rhodes said yesterday that former President Richard M.
Nixon might be effective in helping the GOP at some future
date "but not now."
Other Republicans, speaking both on and off the record,
expressed doubt about the value of any assistance in the
foreseeable future from Nixon, who resigned last August
because of the Watergate scandal.
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said Tuesday that Nixon
is looking forward to helping the Republican party when
his health recovers. Goldwater told reporters that he had
lunch last Thursday with Nixon in San Clemente, Calif.
Goldwater also told his fellow GOP senators at a closed
luncheon Tuesday that Nixon had expressed interest in
being a spokesman and fund raiser for the GOP.
Egyptians Buy French Jets
CAIRO, Egypt Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, eager
to make up 1973 war losses not filled by the Soviets,
announced yesterday the purchase of France's newest
Mirage F1 fighter-bombers that fly at more than twice the
speed of sound.
He also expressed optimism on another military
disengagement with Israel and said "for the first time in 26
years it is possible that we can have peace in the area."
The Mirage purchase broke the Kremlin's 20-year-long
monopoly on arms sales to Egypt and was the first major
Western weapons pact with the Egyptians since 1955.
Sources in Paris said about 50 planes were involved in the
sale at a cost of about $5.3 million each.
Today's Weather

Lows tonight in mid 20s to mid 30s. Highs today in upper

NEW YORK The Soviet Union has canceled the
purchase of 100,000 tons of wheat from Cook Industries
Inc. of Memphis, Tenn. and is negotiating for the
cancellation of another 100,000 tons, industry observers
said yesterday.
Cook, the country's largest grain exporter, refused to
deny or confirm the reports.

Continental Grain Co. of New York, the other firm
involved in th° wheat sale to Russia last fall, said through a
spokesman "we are awaiting word from the people we
are doing business with" regarding its remaining shipments.
Rhodes: Nixon Might Help GOP
WASHINGTON House Republican leader John J.
Rhodes said yesterday that former President Richard M.
Nixon might be effective in helping the GOP at some future
date "but not now."
Other Republicans, speaking both on and off the record,
expressed doubt about the value of any assistance in the
foreseeable future from Nixon, who resigned last August
because of the Watergate scandal.
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said Tuesday that Nixon
is looking forward to helping the Republican party when
his health recovers. Goldwater told reporters that he had
lunch last Thursday with Nixon in San Clemente, Calif.
Goldwater also told his fellow GOP senators at a closed
luncheon Tuesday that Nixon had expressed interest in
being a spokesman and fund raiser for the GOP.
Egyptians Buy French Jets
CAIRO, Egypt Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, eager
to make up 1973 war losses not filled by the Soviets,
announced yesterday the purchase of France's newest
Mirage F1 fighter-bombers that fly at more than twice the
speed of sound.
He also expressed optimism on another military
disengagement with Israel and said "for the first time in 26
years it is possible that we can have peace in the area."
The Mirage purchase broke the Kremlin's 20-year-long
monopoly on arms sales to Egypt and was the first major
Western weapons pact with the Egyptians since 1955.
Sources in Paris said about 50 planes were involved in the
sale at a cost of about $5.3 million each.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with local night and
morning fog or low clouds. A little warmer tomorrow.
Lows tonight in mid 20s to mid 30s. Highs today in upper
40s to low 50s and tomorrow in 50s. Northerly winds 10 to
20 mph.
Oakland Bombing Attempt Foiled
WASHINGTON The departments of Interior and
Treasury were evacuated and several other federal
installations searched yesterday because of further bomb
threats in the wake of an explosion at the State Department
and an attempted bombing in Oakland.
An anonymous male caller told The Associated Press at
midday that bombs would go off at the Smithsonian
Institution, the Departments of Agriculture and Interior
before the day was out. The Treasury Department received
a separate call which warned "the Treasury will go up in
smoke in half an hour."
The man left it doubtful whether he was part of the
same group, the Weather Underground, which took credit
for the bombing at the State Department and the planting
of a device in Oakland which was found and destroyed by
demolition experts as it ticked away.
Those actions were represented as protests of
continued U.S. support of the war in Southeast Asia.
Economic Index Falls Rapidly
WASHINGTON The government index designed to
forecast economic trends signaled deepening distress with
an unprecedented dive to close out last year, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday.
The index of leading indicators fell at a record monthly
pace for the second time in three months and also logged
the deepest sustained drop since the index was created in
1948.
November's drop was 3.5 percent, surpassing
September's 3.3 percent record. For December, the drop
was 2.4 percent. And for the five consecutive months the
index has fallen, the over-all decline measured 11 percent.
