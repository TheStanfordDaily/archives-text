# Editor Urges 'Fence Mending' To Forestall Economic Collapse
## 
### PAM WOODS 
The United States and the
European nations must begin to
"mend the holes in the fence" of their
alliance as a common defense against
economic collapse, according to
deputy editor of the London Sunday
Times Frank Giles.
In a speech at Bishop Auditorium
Tuesday, Giles said relations in the
past 18 months have been "tense,
strained, worn so thin one could begin
to see the canvas."
Giles blamed the uneasy relations
on a lack of European unity.
"National pig-headedness," he
asserted, has prevented the countries
from speaking in a "single European

voice."
Also at fault is the critical attitude
of American leaders who consider
themselves "major stockholders in the
world organization," Giles said. "They
assumed the United States had global
responsibilities while the Allies had
only local interest."
New politico-economic problems
faced by Western nations such as
inflation, recession and the oil crisis
demand increased international
cooperation, and new leaders as well as
cooler tempers may make this
possible, he remarked.
Giles, also foreign editor for the
Times, called for "a more
even-handed" United States policy in

the Middle East. He said that in its
"unswerving support of Israel," the
United States government is
prolonging tensions in the Middle East
and worsening the oil crisis.
He also called for a new form of
Western alliance, stressing informality
and interaction. "In United
States-European relations we must
find our own level and channels of
communication. We must work
through bur own experiences, not
documents and charters."
Giles also spoke on the state of
Britain, calling it "of direct interest to
the detente." He said the country was
wrestling a "two-headed" crisis, facing
a possible "realignment of the British
party system" as well as an
inflationary recession.
He felt that "we British have helped
talk ourselves into a state of
unwarranted gloom and oppression,"
but warned that "specific sacrifices are
required by everyone" if the country
is to overcome its problems.
Giles' speech was sponsored by the
International Business Club Speakers
Bureau. He is presently on a lecture
tour of the United States.
