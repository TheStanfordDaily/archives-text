# Hearings To Begin Today To Solicit Parking Ideas
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
The first of eight public hearings
will be held today to draw public
opinion into the campus parking
problem.
Peter F. Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, will
conduct the meetings as part of the
University study to find the means of
alleviating the parking problem here.
Today's hearing, at 4 p.m. in
Bishop Auditorium, has been
designated for faculty suggestions.
Tomorrow at noon in Room 214,
University staff are invited to speak.
"The sole purpose of the
meetings," Carpenter said, "is so that
when I make my recommendations to
the University, I'll know that I have
availed myself of every possible
viewpoint.
"There are so many people that

complain a lot about their parking
problems, but few do anything about
it."

Carpenter explained that each
speaker will be limited to five minutes
for his presentation. No one will be
allowed to go over the time limit
unless there is time left and no one
else wants to speak.
Although factual questions will be
answered at the hearings, future.policy
will not be debated, he said. "We want
opinions and suggestions, not
arguments."
Carpenter, a former Palo Alto
planning commissioner, said he hopes
for an enthusiastic turnout at the
hearings.
"In a community such as this, that
places a high value on an open society,
it will be interesting to see how many
people do show up," he noted.
