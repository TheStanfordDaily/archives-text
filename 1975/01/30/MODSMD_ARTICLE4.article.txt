# 50th Anniversary Celebration
## Emeriti, Alumni Recall Biz School History 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Fifty years ago, things at the Business School
were quite different. The program was only for two
years, and tuition was about $135 per quarter,
slightly higher than the undergraduate tuition of the
time.
Because the Business School was so small (the
class of 1935 had 37 members), there was much
more interaction between the faculty and students.
Emeritus Prof, of Business Economics Theodore J.
Kreps held an open house each Sunday after dinner,
and served hot chocolate and cake to students who
would come to "solve the problems of the world."
With much reminiscing, a panel discussion among
three alumni and three former professors from the
Graduate School of Business kicked off its series of
50th anniversary events.
One Woman Per Class
There was usually one woman in each class.
When asked what the woman in his class of 1942
went on to do, Charles Bulotti, now president of the
American Automobile Association, answered "She
was a nice girl. I suppose Sally got married."
"There just weren't many opportunities for
women," said Robert Haslacher, 1939, whose sister
went to the Business School at the same time he
did.
No overseas students, blacks or <l mehibers of the
other racial subdivisions" were enrolled in the
school, recalled Bulotti. "It wasn't characteristic of
the times."
The curriculum was "geared to bigness, to big
industry," said Bulotti. The "prestige course" was
industrial management. Haslacher remembered that
a survey of his class showed that the average student
hoped to be the vice president of a large corporation
by the age of 28.
'Broader Concerns'
In contrast to his class, "this generation of
students has somewhat broader concerns than we

had," Bulotti said. The student body is much more
diverse, and many have non-business backgrounds.
There are now 125 women in the Business School.
"Students have a much deeper sense of their
social obligation," said Harry J. Rathbun, emeritus
professor of law who taught business law from 1929
to 1956. "They realize that if the boat goes down,
they go down with it."
Although the school was started in 1925, it did
not actually open its doors to students until the
spring of 1926. At that time, the Business School
was located in Jordan Hall.
History
A graduate business school for Stanford had been
under discussion ever since the opening of the
nation's first graduate school of business at Harvard
in 1908.
No action was taken until 1924, when former
President Herbert Hoover, then secretary of
commerce in the Collidge administration, persuaded
a group of Pacific Coast friends to work with him
on bringing a business school to the University. He
contended that such a school was needed in order
"to teach business as a profession upon a parity
with engineering, law and medicine."
Other members of the panel included Emeritus
Prof, of Industrial Management Paul E. Holden, the
only living member of the school's original faculty;
David P. Smith, 1937, president of an investment
and advisory service in San Francisco; and William
P. Wentworth, 1935, also a partner in an investment
and advisory service.
Activities scheduled during the 50th anniversary
year include a conference on international business,
a 50th anniversary ball to be held at the Sheraton
Palace Hotel in San Francisco, and a series of special
seminars for alumni.
In addition, the Business School is planning a
special issue of its alumni magazine commemorating
its growth and development.
