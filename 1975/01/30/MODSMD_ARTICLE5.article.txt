# Three Women Say Stanford Guilty Of Sex Discrimination
## 
### DON LINDEMANN 
Discrimination against women at
Stanford takes many forms other than
a bias in hiring practices, according to
three women who spoke last night
before the Education Committee of
the Santa Clara County Commission
on the Status of Women.
The three Stanford women were
among a dozen speakers who appeared
at the commission's hearings to
express grievances, some of which
were aimed at racial discrimination in
the women's movement itself.
The Commission was established to
study and investigate conditions which
demonstrate discrimination or
prejudice because of sex in Santa Clara
County.
The lack of faculty role models for
women and absence of part-time or
evening study opportunities for
student mothers were frequently
mentioned by the Stanford women as
examples of discrimination here.
Matilda Butler-Paisley, a lecturer in
the Department of Communication

who recently filed a complaint with
various federal agencies regarding
alleged discrimination at Stanford,
observed that no woman has ever
served on the faculty of her
department, which now consists of 16
men.
Butler-Paisley noted that the
Communication Department has filled
all eight of its vacancies in the last
three years with men, saying that "in
no case did the department adhere to
the search and selection
procedures... of Stanford's own
affirmative action policy."
She alleged that this policy is being
ignored, noting a net decrease of two
women on the tenured faculty of the
University during the 1973-74 school
year.
Funding Policy Criticized
Butler-Paisley criticized the
University policy which denies
external funding for research projects
to anyone who is not a member of the
Academic Council. Only 41 percent of
the women on the University's
instructional and research staff are on
the Council and thus eligible for
funding under this policy. Moreover,
"Men are receiving 98 percent of the
total federal award to Stanford," she
said.
Helene Rausch, a research associate
in the Medical School, said that only
19 women are represented on a faculty
of 285 in that school, and 14 of those
are untenured. Several departments
have no women at all.
The proportion of women among
the incoming class of Medical School
students has risen to 28 percent (up
from five-10 percent in the sixties),
but there are few faculty women to
act as models and counselors, she said.
No 'Reasonable Representation'
"Part of the education of a woman
in the professions is that she learn
from models who are successful in the
academic world . .. and we simply
don't have reasonable representation
on the faculty," Rausch said. "Unless
a woman is tenured she really can't
play a role as a counselor."
Rausch, in the Medical School for
15 years, must have her contract
renewed from year to year.
She said that many other women
share her predicament; they are
appointed to research assistantships
rather than positions on the regular

faculty. The assistantships are almost
always one-year terminal contracts and
must be supported by external
funding.
Discrimination Overlooked
Maureen McNulty, a graduate
student in the School of Education,
said that the discrimination in that
school is usually overlooked by
University administrators because
women compose 50 percent of the
students. Only four of 80 students in
the administration program are
women, she said, and only one woman
has received a doctorate in higher
education since 1947.

McNulty said that faculty need to
ask why the environment here won't
support women.
Several black and Asian women at
the hearings expressed concern about
the acceptance and influence of
women of color in the women's
movement as a whole.
Mary Seid of Asian Americans for
Community Involvement said that
"Asian women in education have to
overcome the additional problem of
the stereotype assigned to them, which
is often that of the quaint, exotic,
mysterious, passive oriental doll."

Discrimination Overlooked
Maureen McNulty, a graduate
student in the School of Education,
said that the discrimination in that
school is usually overlooked by
University administrators because
women compose 50 percent of the
students. Only four of 80 students in
the administration program are
women, she said, and only one woman
has received a doctorate in higher
education since 1947.

out after a year or two.
McNulty said that faculty need to
ask why the environment here won't
support women.
Several black and Asian women at
the hearings expressed concern about
the acceptance and influence of
women of color in the women's
movement as a whole.
Mary Seid of Asian Americans for
Community Involvement said that
"Asian women in education have to
overcome the additional problem of
the stereotype assigned to them, which
is often that of the quaint, exotic,
mysterious, passive oriental doll."
Discrimination against women at
Stanford takes many forms other than
a bias in hiring practices, according to
three women who spoke last night
before the Education Committee of
the Santa Clara County Commission
on the Status of Women.
The three Stanford women were
among a dozen speakers who appeared
at the commission's hearings to
express grievances, some of which
were aimed at racial discrimination in
the women's movement itself.
The Commission was established to
study and investigate conditions which
demonstrate discrimination or
prejudice because of sex in Santa Clara
County.
The lack of faculty role models for
women and absence of part-time or
evening study opportunities for
student mothers were frequently
mentioned by the Stanford women as
examples of discrimination here.
Matilda Butler-Paisley, a lecturer in
the Department of Communication

who recently filed a complaint with
various federal agencies regarding
alleged discrimination at Stanford,
observed that no woman has ever
served on the faculty of her
department, which now consists of 16
men.
Butler-Paisley noted that the
Communication Department has filled
all eight of its vacancies in the last
three years with men, saying that "in
no case did the department adhere to
the search and selection
procedures... of Stanford's own
affirmative action policy."
She alleged that this policy is being
ignored, noting a net decrease of two
women on the tenured faculty of the
University during the 1973-74 school
year.
Funding Policy Criticized
Butler-Paisley criticized the
University policy which denies
external funding for research projects
to anyone who is not a member of the
Academic Council. Only 41 percent of
the women on the University's
instructional and research staff are on
the Council and thus eligible for
funding under this policy. Moreover,
"Men are receiving 98 percent of the
total federal award to Stanford," she
said.
Helene Rausch, a research associate
in the Medical School, said that only
19 women are represented on a faculty
of 285 in that school, and 14 of those
are untenured. Several departments
have no women at all.
The proportion of women among
the incoming class of Medical School
students has risen to 28 percent (up
from five-10 percent in the sixties),
but there are few faculty women to
act as models and counselors, she said.
No 'Reasonable Representation'
"Part of the education of a woman
in the professions is that she learn
from models who are successful in the
academic world . .. and we simply
don't have reasonable representation
on the faculty," Rausch said. "Unless
a woman is tenured she really can't
play a role as a counselor."
Rausch, in the Medical School for
15 years, must have her contract
renewed from year to year.
She said that many other women
share her predicament; they are
appointed to research assistantships
rather than positions on the regular

faculty. The assistantships are almost
