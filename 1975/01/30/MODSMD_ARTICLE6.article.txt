# Palo Alto Paramedics Start Work

### JON BIGELOW 
Paramedic Joseph Waldherr didn't
get any sleep during his last 24-hour
shift.
"We were getting calls all night
long," he said. "It's busier than we
thought it would be."
Waldherr and 11 other Palo Alto
firemen take turns manning the city's
new mobile intensive care unit, three
to a shift. They began taking
emergency calls a week ago Tuesday.
On one day the unit attended to an
auto accident, a miscarriage, a heart
attack and an attempted suicide. It
also answered all the regular fire calls
during the shift.
Fulfillment
Despite the rigors of their new job,
the paramedics remain enthusiastic.
"It's a good job," said Capt. Jack
Leslie. Both he and Waldherr agree
that the sense of fulfillment they gain
from their increased ability to save
lives makes up for the loss of sleep.
The role of the paramedic takes up
where the fireman's leaves off. All
firemen in Palo Alto are trained to do
basic first aid, including respiratory
and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation
(keeping the breathing and blood
circulation going by artificial means).
