# Palo Alto Paramedics Start Work
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
Paramedic Joseph Waldherr didn't
get any sleep during his last 24-hour
shift.
"We were getting calls all night
long," he said. "It's busier than we
thought it would be."
Waldherr and 11 other Palo Alto
firemen take turns manning the city's
new mobile intensive care unit, three
to a shift. They began taking
emergency calls a week ago Tuesday.
On one day the unit attended to an
auto accident, a miscarriage, a heart
attack and an attempted suicide. It
also answered all the regular fire calls
during the shift.
Fulfillment
Despite the rigors of their new job,
the paramedics remain enthusiastic.
"It's a good job," said Capt. Jack
Leslie. Both he and Waldherr agree
that the sense of fulfillment they gain
from their increased ability to save
lives makes up for the loss of sleep.
The role of the paramedic takes up
where the fireman's leaves off. All
firemen in Palo Alto are trained to do
basic first aid, including respiratory
and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation
(keeping the breathing and blood
circulation going by artificial means).
But when it comes to a really
serious situation, one which requires
the skills of a trained doctor, they
suffer from a sense of helplessness. It
was this frustration that led more than
20 city firemen to apply for the job of
paramedic last summer, after the City
Council approved the funds for the
program.
Grueling Program
The 12 men selected went through
a grueling five-month training program
at Stanford and in Redondo Beach,
near Los Angeles. At the University
they learned medical terminology,
anatomy, how to read
electro-cardiograms, the rudiments of
pharmacology, and so forth.
"It's hard for someone who hasn't
been to school for a while especially
since doctors and nurses never use
simple terminology," said Waldherr.
But, he added, "it was excellent
training."
In Redondo Beach the firefighters
gained practical experience, answering
calls with the paramedics in that city.
"They let us do all the work they
only helped if they had to," recalls
Waldherr. Southern California
witnessed the first use of paramedics
in this state, and they've been well
received.
Motivation Big Factor
The biggest factor in selecting the
paramedics, according to City Training
Officer Don Shaw, was motivation. "It
was a strictly voluntary choice," he
said. The honest desire to serve the
public was necessary more than
anything else, because being a
paramedic requires a "lot of
sacrifices."
The new paramedic unit enables
firemen to "stabilize" the victim (or
patient, as doctors have taught the

paramedics to call him) at the scene.
Formerly, a person suffering from a
heart attack had to suffer through a
long ambulance ride before receiving
help at the hospital.
This improvement in emergency
service is made possible by the use of
"biocommunications." The paramedic
taking an electro-cardiogram on the
scene can radio the data needed for
diagnosis by a physician directly to the
hospital; then the doctor can prescribe
the treatment to be administered.
"We're the doctor's eyes and hands,"
said Waldherr.
'Leisurely Car Ride'
"After the patient is stabilized, he
is leisurely taken back to the hospital.
It's just like a car ride," said Shaw.
The paramedic unit services
Stanford and Barron Park, neither of
which is within the Palo Alto city
limits. Another unit from the Stanford
Fire Department meets the paramedics
on each Stanford call to guide them
through the confusing on-campus
traffic patterns. The number to call in
case of emergency is the same as the
Stanford fire department: 322-6868.
In their little spare time, the
paramedics have been giving
demonstrations to the public. "We
want to remind people that this service
is available," said Leslie, "but it's also
important that people themselves
know the ABC's of saving someone's
life." He noted that no matter how
efficient the fire department may be,
immediate aid to the victim of an
accident can be the difference between
life and death.
Today's firemen-turned-paramedics
can confidently answer an emergency
medical call. The program has "been a
real shot in the arm for them," Shaw
said. "Now they're able to say, 'I can
really do something.'"

suffer from a sense of helplessness. It
was this frustration that led more than
20 city firemen to apply for the job of
paramedic last summer, after the City
Council approved the funds for the
program.
Grueling Program
The 12 men selected went through
a grueling five-month training program
at Stanford and in Redondo Beach,
near Los Angeles. At the University
they learned medical terminology,
anatomy, how to read
electro-cardiograms, the rudiments of
pharmacology, and so forth.
"It's hard for someone who hasn't
been to school for a while especially
since doctors and nurses never use
simple terminology," said Waldherr.
But, he added, "it was excellent
training."
In Redondo Beach the firefighters
gained practical experience, answering
calls with the paramedics in that city.
"They let us do all the work they
only helped if they had to," recalls
Waldherr. Southern California
witnessed the first use of paramedics
in this state, and they've been well
received.
Motivation Big Factor
The biggest factor in selecting the
paramedics, according to City Training
Officer Don Shaw, was motivation. "It
was a strictly voluntary choice," he
said. The honest desire to serve the
public was necessary more than
anything else, because being a
paramedic requires a "lot of
sacrifices."
The new paramedic unit enables
firemen to "stabilize" the victim (or
patient, as doctors have taught the

paramedics to call him) at the scene.
Formerly, a person suffering from a
heart attack had to suffer through a
long ambulance ride before receiving
help at the hospital.
This improvement in emergency
service is made possible by the use of
"biocommunications." The paramedic
taking an electro-cardiogram on the
scene can radio the data needed for
diagnosis by a physician directly to the
hospital; then the doctor can prescribe
the treatment to be administered.
"We're the doctor's eyes and hands,"
said Waldherr.
'Leisurely Car Ride'
"After the patient is stabilized, he
is leisurely taken back to the hospital.
It's just like a car ride," said Shaw.
The paramedic unit services
Stanford and Barron Park, neither of
which is within the Palo Alto city
limits. Another unit from the Stanford
Fire Department meets the paramedics
on each Stanford call to guide them
through the confusing on-campus
traffic patterns. The number to call in
case of emergency is the same as the
Stanford fire department: 322-6868.
In their little spare time, the
paramedics have been giving
demonstrations to the public. "We
want to remind people that this service
is available," said Leslie, "but it's also
important that people themselves
know the ABC's of saving someone's
life." He noted that no matter how
efficient the fire department may be,
immediate aid to the victim of an
accident can be the difference between
life and death.
Today's firemen-turned-paramedics
can confidently answer an emergency
medical call. The program has "been a
real shot in the arm for them," Shaw
said. "Now they're able to say, 'I can
really do something.'"
Paramedic Joseph Waldherr didn't
get any sleep during his last 24-hour
shift.
"We were getting calls all night
long," he said. "It's busier than we
thought it would be."
Waldherr and 11 other Palo Alto
firemen take turns manning the city's
new mobile intensive care unit, three
to a shift. They began taking
emergency calls a week ago Tuesday.
On one day the unit attended to an
auto accident, a miscarriage, a heart
attack and an attempted suicide. It
also answered all the regular fire calls
during the shift.
Fulfillment
Despite the rigors of their new job,
the paramedics remain enthusiastic.
"It's a good job," said Capt. Jack
Leslie. Both he and Waldherr agree
that the sense of fulfillment they gain
from their increased ability to save
lives makes up for the loss of sleep.
The role of the paramedic takes up
where the fireman's leaves off. All
firemen in Palo Alto are trained to do
basic first aid, including respiratory
and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation
(keeping the breathing and blood
circulation going by artificial means).
But when it comes to a really
serious situation, one which requires
the skills of a trained doctor, they
suffer from a sense of helplessness. It
was this frustration that led more than
20 city firemen to apply for the job of
paramedic last summer, after the City
