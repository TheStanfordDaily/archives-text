# Represents 90 On Death Row
## Prof Fights Capital Punishment 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam's
intense, somber demeanor reflects the
life-and-death matters on his mind.
Ninety condemned inmates on
Death Rows around the country claim
the 39-year-old lawyer as counselor.
That heavy workload is only part of
Amsterdam's 10-year crusade against

capital punishment.
One of those inmates, Jesse Fowler,
a North Carolina black man convicted
of murder, is scheduled to appear with
Amsterdam before the U.S. Supreme
Court by June. It will be the first
review of capital punishment by the
high court since the landmark Furman
v. Georgia decision in 1972.
Court Ruling
In the Furman case, in which
Amsterdam was also involved, the
Court held that capital punishment as
then applied violated the Eighth
Amendment provision forbidding
"cruel and unusual punishment."
However, the Court outlawed only
"discretionary" capital punishment
laws which had allowed juries to
arbitrarily decide whether the accused
would be executed or sent to prison.
"We didn't think it was
pragmatically wise" to try for a total
elimination of the death penalty,
Amsterdam says.
Since then 26 states, including
California, have legislated mandatory
death sentences for those convicted of
certain crimes.
This time Amsterdam hopes to help
persuade the Court to declare
unconstitutional any capital
punishment.
Possibilities
The possibility for such a ruling
exists, Amsterdam says. He notes that
Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and William O. Douglas did
favor complete abolition of capital
punishment in the Furman decision,
while the other majority justices did
not commit themselves. But on the
other hand, "judges are not immune to
public pressure," which Amsterdam
believes is largely pro-capital
punishment.
Amsterdam is also involved in
Donald Bernard's case, the first appeal,
of a death sentence, under the new
California capital punishment statute,
to reach the State Supreme Court.
The statute was passed after
California voters in 1972 approved
Proposition 17, thus exempting capital
punishment from a test under the
California constitutional injunction

against "cruel or unusual
punishment."
Crusading Spirit
The Court might overturn either
the 1972 initiative or the statute, or
decline to tackle the controversial
issue, Amsterdam said.
To Amsterdam the cruelty of
waiting for a "death with no escape,
no appeal, no resort" is "self-evident."
"One cannot have seen hundreds of
these defendants without realizing it is
an incredible ordeal of anguish.
'Personalities Distorted'
"Some go looney, go off their
rockers ... their entire personalities
are distorted," he says.
"Others refuse to face the fact that
they are on Death Row, or throw
themselves into vain legal maneuvers."
The death penalty has "no
deterrence value," according to
Amsterdam. In fact he argues that
capital punishment actually incites
more murders than it prevents.
He notes that in some cases, the
murderer is in effect committing
suicide hoping to receive a sentence
of capital punishment for the crime.
As an example he cites the case of
Pamela Watkins, a San Jose adolescent
who, after a number of suicide
attempts, murdered two infants she
was babysitting.
Wanted Death Penalty
She admitted killing the children
"for the express purpose of receiving
the death penalty," according to Asst.
Psychiatry Prof. Donald Lunde, who
questioned her in jail.
"As a kind of proof," Amsterdam
said, "she refused to cooperate with
lawyers" while capital punishment was
on the statutes. But when the State
Supreme Court temporarily struck
down the death penalty, she
cooperated fully.
Amsterdam's crusading spirit
became a quieter philosophical one as
he noted that no one really
understands the process of death,
including death administered by the
state. He concludes that "what we are
doing is taking a step whose immediate
consequences are unknowable to
man."
