Franklin Statements Clarified
Editor:
A colleague from Stanford just
sent me a copy of an article by
William Ross in the Daily of Jan.
21. The article purports to
describe an interview that took
place when Ross called me to
inquire about my present
employment.
The interview did take place,
and what Ross reports about my
forthcoming book is reasonably
accurate. But where Ross got
much of the rest of the article,
including the many comments
about Stanford attributed to me
and draped in quotation marks,
remains a mystery.
For example, of course I did
not say, as Ross quotes me, that
people "can hardly believe that a
school like Stanford would fire a
tenured professor merely because
he criticized the American
invasion of Indochina." What I
did say was that people are
appalled when they read the
Decision of the Faculty Advisory
Board, particularly when they see
for themselves the speeches for
which I was fired (even though
the versions printed there delete
key phrases from the official
transcript).
I did not say, as Ross quotes
me, that my "discussions about
Stanford's ties to 'big business'
deterred students from applying
to the University." What I did say
was that I have met students who
had previously heard about my
case and, on the basis of what
they knew, had decided not to
attend Stanford. In fact, I
indicated to Ross my surprise at
finding out how notorious the
name Stanford had already
become in higher education.

Reply To Goodell
Editor:
I find myself obligated to write
this after reading William Ross'
article, "Goodell Defends
Clemency Program," in the Jan.
28 Daily.
Goodell attributes the, low
response to the clemency program
to "widespread ignorance about
eligibility." In fact, it is due to the
widespread knowledge among
those involved that Ford's
program leaves much to be
desired, that the program is not
working.
Goodell goes on to state that a
"pardon" (as he calls it) resulting
from the program would be a
great help for "these guys" as
they wouldn't have a bad record
to show when applying for jobs.
However, under Ford's program,
after an evader performs his
alternative service, he is given a
special "clemency discharge"
which will readily identify him as a
former evader to any potential
employer.
If Goodell were genuinely
concerned about these men who
refused to fight in an unjust and
immoral war, he would be
working for a program of
unconditional amnesty instead of
a program in which men are
punished for not complying with
unjust orders issued by a corrupt
government.
In the words of a Vietnam
veteran and graduate student at
Stanford, considering how Nixon
was let off, it does not seem right
to punish those who felt the war
was morally wrong.

'Brand New Road'
Editor:
Provost Ed Shaw and
University Master Planner Oscar
Nelson are constructing a brand
new road from the dirt up for the
convenience of the people

(relatively few compared to, say
those who use Serra Street)
Lomita Drive and Panama Street.
The worst parts of the trenches
and yawning chasms on Serra,
those by the Quad and Hoover
Tower, have blossomed with
hillocks of asphalt much in the
manner and distribution of the
promenades in New York City
when the pigeon population has
rectal problems.
I state again that the
University, as manifest in its
actions, is knowingly,
purposefully and maliciously
endangering the health, safety and
welfare of our community by its
crass negligence and adamant
refusal to make Serra Street safe.
Turning depressions into mounds
does nothing.
How many campus roads will
be built before a smooth,
unbroken single layer of asphalt is
applied to one of the worst
eyesores and the deadliest traffic
hazard on campus? Must a biker
lose control of his vehicle and be
injured or killed before Serra is
made to comply with
acknowledged public safety
standards?
Perhaps the University should
adopt a new motto: "Millions for
lawsuits, not one penny for
needed improvements."

Bring Back Sororities
Editor:
In an editorial on Jan. 23, the
Daily mildly criticized the new
housing proposal for being weak
in that "women are still
discriminated against in an
abstract sense." Why does it
appear that discrimination against
women is abstract?
A University which allows for
the existence of fraternities but
maintains a 30-year-old ban on
sororities is discriminating against
women in a very apparent
manner. Perhaps, in view of Title
IX and University policy against
discrimination on the basis of sex,
the time has come to lift that ban
on sororities and balance the
housing options somewhat.

I cannot believe that your
reviewer and I went to the same
Dave Mason concert. If the
audience, jumping up and down
enough to cause stage hands to
tighten up cables on the wildly
oscillating light system, was not
ecstatic, what was it? The
equipment break-downs did not
dissipate Mason's momentum; if
anything, they provided needed
breaks in a totally absorbing
performance.
In fact, the reviews of Mason
and Journey read almost as
though the reporters did not even
go to the concert, but instead got
a member of Journey to write
them both. Mindful of its record
so far, I would say the Daily needs
to review itself before disserving
the Stanford community with any

Goodell attributes the, low
response to the clemency program
to "widespread ignorance about

widespread knowledge among
those involved that Ford's
program leaves much to be
desired, that the program is not
working.
Goodell goes on to state that a
"pardon" (as he calls it) resulting
from the program would be a
great help for "these guys" as
they wouldn't have a bad record
to show when applying for jobs.
However, under Ford's program,
after an evader performs his
alternative service, he is given a
special "clemency discharge"
which will readily identify him as a
former evader to any potential
employer.
If Goodell were genuinely
concerned about these men who
refused to fight in an unjust and
immoral war, he would be
working for a program of
unconditional amnesty instead of
a program in which men are
punished for not complying with
unjust orders issued by a corrupt
government.
In the words of a Vietnam
veteran and graduate student at
Stanford, considering how Nixon
was let off, it does not seem right
to punish those who felt the war
was morally wrong.

'Brand New Road'
Editor:
Provost Ed Shaw and
University Master Planner Oscar
Nelson are constructing a brand
new road from the dirt up for the
convenience of the people

(relatively few compared to, say
those who use Serra Street)
Lomita Drive and Panama Street.
The worst parts of the trenches
and yawning chasms on Serra,
those by the Quad and Hoover
Tower, have blossomed with
hillocks of asphalt much in the
manner and distribution of the
promenades in New York City
when the pigeon population has
rectal problems.
I state again that the
University, as manifest in its
actions, is knowingly,
purposefully and maliciously
endangering the health, safety and
welfare of our community by its
crass negligence and adamant
refusal to make Serra Street safe.
Turning depressions into mounds
does nothing.
How many campus roads will
be built before a smooth,
unbroken single layer of asphalt is
applied to one of the worst
eyesores and the deadliest traffic
hazard on campus? Must a biker
lose control of his vehicle and be
injured or killed before Serra is
made to comply with
acknowledged public safety
standards?
Perhaps the University should
adopt a new motto: "Millions for
lawsuits, not one penny for
needed improvements."

Bring Back Sororities
Editor:
In an editorial on Jan. 23, the
Daily mildly criticized the new
housing proposal for being weak
in that "women are still
discriminated against in an
abstract sense." Why does it
appear that discrimination against
women is abstract?
A University which allows for
the existence of fraternities but
maintains a 30-year-old ban on
sororities is discriminating against
women in a very apparent
manner. Perhaps, in view of Title
IX and University policy against
discrimination on the basis of sex,
the time has come to lift that ban
on sororities and balance the

'Brand New Road'
Editor:
Provost Ed Shaw and
University Master Planner Oscar
Nelson are constructing a brand
new road from the dirt up for the
convenience of the people

(relatively few compared to, say
those who use Serra Street)
Lomita Drive and Panama Street.
The worst parts of the trenches
and yawning chasms on Serra,
those by the Quad and Hoover
Tower, have blossomed with
hillocks of asphalt much in the
manner and distribution of the
promenades in New York City
when the pigeon population has
rectal problems.
I state again that the
University, as manifest in its
actions, is knowingly,
purposefully and maliciously
endangering the health, safety and
welfare of our community by its
crass negligence and adamant
refusal to make Serra Street safe.
Turning depressions into mounds
does nothing.
How many campus roads will
be built before a smooth,
unbroken single layer of asphalt is
applied to one of the worst
eyesores and the deadliest traffic
hazard on campus? Must a biker
lose control of his vehicle and be
injured or killed before Serra is
made to comply with
acknowledged public safety
standards?
Perhaps the University should
adopt a new motto: "Millions for
lawsuits, not one penny for
needed improvements."

Bring Back Sororities
Editor:
In an editorial on Jan. 23, the
Daily mildly criticized the new
housing proposal for being weak
in that "women are still
discriminated against in an
abstract sense." Why does it
appear that discrimination against
women is abstract?
A University which allows for
the existence of fraternities but
maintains a 30-year-old ban on
sororities is discriminating against
women in a very apparent
manner. Perhaps, in view of Title
IX and University policy against
discrimination on the basis of sex,
the time has come to lift that ban
on sororities and balance the
housing options somewhat.

I cannot believe that your
reviewer and I went to the same
Dave Mason concert. If the
audience, jumping up and down
enough to cause stage hands to
tighten up cables on the wildly
oscillating light system, was not
ecstatic, what was it? The
equipment break-downs did not
dissipate Mason's momentum; if
anything, they provided needed
breaks in a totally absorbing
performance.
In fact, the reviews of Mason
and Journey read almost as
though the reporters did not even
go to the concert, but instead got
a member of Journey to write
them both. Mindful of its record
so far, I would say the Daily needs
to review itself before disserving

A colleague from Stanford just
sent me a copy of an article by
William Ross in the Daily of Jan.
21. The article purports to
describe an interview that took
place when Ross called me to
inquire about my present
employment.
The interview did take place,
and what Ross reports about my
forthcoming book is reasonably
accurate. But where Ross got
much of the rest of the article,
including the many comments
about Stanford attributed to me
and draped in quotation marks,
remains a mystery.
For example, of course I did
not say, as Ross quotes me, that
people "can hardly believe that a
school like Stanford would fire a
tenured professor merely because
he criticized the American
invasion of Indochina." What I
did say was that people are
appalled when they read the
Decision of the Faculty Advisory
Board, particularly when they see
for themselves the speeches for
which I was fired (even though
the versions printed there delete
key phrases from the official
transcript).
I did not say, as Ross quotes
me, that my "discussions about
Stanford's ties to 'big business'
deterred students from applying
to the University." What I did say
was that I have met students who
had previously heard about my
case and, on the basis of what
they knew, had decided not to
attend Stanford. In fact, I
indicated to Ross my surprise at
finding out how notorious the
name Stanford had already
become in higher education.

Reply To Goodell
Editor:
I find myself obligated to write
this after reading William Ross'
article, "Goodell Defends
Clemency Program," in the Jan.
28 Daily.
Goodell attributes the, low
response to the clemency program
to "widespread ignorance about
eligibility." In fact, it is due to the
widespread knowledge among
those involved that Ford's
program leaves much to be
desired, that the program is not
working.
Goodell goes on to state that a
"pardon" (as he calls it) resulting
from the program would be a
great help for "these guys" as
they wouldn't have a bad record
to show when applying for jobs.
However, under Ford's program,
after an evader performs his
alternative service, he is given a
special "clemency discharge"
which will readily identify him as a
former evader to any potential
employer.
If Goodell were genuinely
concerned about these men who
refused to fight in an unjust and
immoral war, he would be
working for a program of
unconditional amnesty instead of
a program in which men are
punished for not complying with
unjust orders issued by a corrupt
government.
