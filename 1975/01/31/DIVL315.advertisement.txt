TO DRIVE OR NOT TO DRIVE?
TO PAY OR NOT TO PAY?
Staff members, let me hear from you about
these questions.
Can you take public transportation to Stanford?
Should autos be banned from the central campus?
Would you pay for the privilege to park near where you work?
Or is that privilege a fringe benefit?
I've been asked to re-examine the parking and transportation system
and recommend changes. To do this I need your input. There will be a
public meeting today at noon in room 214 History Corner to hear your
ideas. Everyone is welcome, but I especially want to hear from
THE STAFF.
This is your opportunity to be heard. Make use
of it.
Parking Meeting today!!!!!!
Open to all, Especially For Staff.
12 P.M. 214 History Corner
