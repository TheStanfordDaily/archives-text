There was a time
when the EARTH*
negative heel shoe
was the only shoe '
in the world with
the heel lower than
the toe. In those
days the other
people who made
shoes just laughed
at us.
But things have
changed. And now
that you love our
Earth brand shoes
so much, the shoe
companies have
stopped laughing
and started copying.
But what they
don't understand is
this. Merely lower
ing the heel of a
shoe isn't enough.
And imitating the
outside of our shoe
isn't enough.
Just because a
shoe looks like the
Earth shoe doesn't
mean it works like
the Earth shoe.
It took many
years to perfect the
Earth brand shoe.
To get the arch just
right. To make the
toes wide, comfort
able and functional.
To balance the
shoe.To mold the
sole in a special way
so that it will allow
you to walk in a
natural rolling
motion. Gently and
easily, even on the
hard jarring cement
of our cities.
And the Earth
shoe is patented.
That means it can't
be copied without
being changed. And
if it'schanged it just
isn't the Earth shoe.
So to be sure
you're getting the
Earth brand shoe,
look on the sole for
the Earth trade
mark and U.S.
patent #3305947.
You'll be glad
you did.
