A fundamental breakthrough not really) It's just that
we wrote a book using this notation (Applied Optimal
Estimation, published by MIT Press, Spring '74). The title
of the book tells a lot about TASC. Our interest is in apply
ing the modem systems viewpoint that you have learned.
Since TASC was founded in 1966, our staff of graduate engi
neers, scientists, data processing specialists and support
personnel has grown to more than 140. In addition to having
authored several technical books and numerous reports,
papers, and articles, our staff members hold patents in bio
medical instrumentation, meteorological sensing, control sys
tem design, and inertial navigation technology. Our work in
volves analytical research related to mathematical modeling of
physical processes, optimal state estimation and optimal con
trol, adaptive estimation and control, multisensor system syn
thesis, system identification, system optimization, system test
and evaluation techniques, advanced simulation techniques
and advanced systems concepts.
We are a steadily growing applied research firm that enjoys
professional expression by solving real systems problems in
navigation, guidance and control in defense, space and public
systems applications.
Positions are available for innovative 'applications oriented
Masters and Doctorate level engineers who have a working
knowledge of modern estimation and control theory.
TASC is conveniently located 10 miles north of Boston.
