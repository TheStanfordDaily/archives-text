# Palo Alto School Board
## Candidates Voice Varied Views 
### JOHN FREED 
Students, voting in next month's
I Palo Alto School Board election will
choose from a field of four diverse
candidates.
The candidates — Joshua Goldstein,
June R. Genis, Robert Taylor and Jean
I Amick — presented their views last
night to about 100 members of the
Citizens' Caucus of the Palo Alto
Unified School District.
Goldstein, on the research stlaff of
; the Stanford Institute of Political
Studies, received the caucus'
endorsement for the second straight
year. He argued for increased contact
of school-age persons with others both
older and younger than themselves in a
unique proposal to utilize empty
classroom space.
"Say you have one empty
classroom in a school. Why not make
that a child-care center or a
| senior-citizens' center? The main idea
is to get contact between different age
groups," Goldstein remarked-.
Goldstein urged further study of a
proposal which would merge the Palo
Alto Unified School District with
those of other neighboring

communities, including East Palo Alto.
"The positive side [of the
proposal] is that I don't think there is
enough communication between that
side of the [Bayshore] Freeway and
this side of the freeway. The negative
thing is the size" of the proposed
district, he said.
Genis, a science researcher at the
Stanford Center for Information
Processing, espoused a libertarian
platform.
"I'm running because I think the
board is lacking in a certain point of
view, the libertarian point of view,"
she contended. "I would hope I would
-stimulate a few minds [on the board]
which have remained dormant too
long."
Taylor, a Los Altos elementary
school principal for 17 years, claimed
his experience in school affairs would
help the board.
"With my experience and
training... I can work with school
budgets and understand school
budgets," he observed. "I've gone
through the experience of closing a
couple of schools, I've gone through

the trauma of the parents, of the
teachers, and my own."
Amick, whose community
involvement has included nine years as
a local PTA board member, including
three as president, said the board
should define broad goals during
budget-cutting times and should
support career education programs.
"We must define the goals of the
district... and evaluate staff cutbacks
to make sure we are going towards
these goals," she commented.
Including absentee ballots,
Goldstein tallied 156 votes to Amick's
runner-up total of 64.

"I'm running because I think the
board is lacking in a certain point of
view, the libertarian point of view,"
she contended. "I would hope I would
-stimulate a few minds [on the board]
which have remained dormant too
long."
Taylor, a Los Altos elementary
school principal for 17 years, claimed
his experience in school affairs would
help the board.
"With my experience and
training... I can work with school
budgets and understand school
budgets," he observed. "I've gone
through the experience of closing a
couple of schools, I've gone through

the trauma of the parents, of the
teachers, and my own."
Amick, whose community
involvement has included nine years as
a local PTA board member, including
three as president, said the board
should define broad goals during
budget-cutting times and should
support career education programs.
"We must define the goals of the
district... and evaluate staff cutbacks
to make sure we are going towards
these goals," she commented.
Including absentee ballots,
Goldstein tallied 156 votes to Amick's
runner-up total of 64.

WHAT'S UP, JOSH? - Joshua Goldstein explains one aspect of his campaign for the Palo Alto School Board to a
questioner at last night's Palo Alto Citizens' Caucus meeting. Goldstein received the caucus' endorsement for the second
straight year.
Students, voting in next month's
I Palo Alto School Board election will
choose from a field of four diverse
candidates.
The candidates — Joshua Goldstein,
June R. Genis, Robert Taylor and Jean
I Amick — presented their views last
night to about 100 members of the
Citizens' Caucus of the Palo Alto
Unified School District.
Goldstein, on the research stlaff of
; the Stanford Institute of Political
Studies, received the caucus'
endorsement for the second straight
year. He argued for increased contact
of school-age persons with others both
older and younger than themselves in a
unique proposal to utilize empty
classroom space.
"Say you have one empty
classroom in a school. Why not make
that a child-care center or a
| senior-citizens' center? The main idea
is to get contact between different age
groups," Goldstein remarked-.
Goldstein urged further study of a
proposal which would merge the Palo
Alto Unified School District with
those of other neighboring

communities, including East Palo Alto.
"The positive side [of the
proposal] is that I don't think there is
enough communication between that
side of the [Bayshore] Freeway and
this side of the freeway. The negative
thing is the size" of the proposed
district, he said.
Genis, a science researcher at the
Stanford Center for Information
Processing, espoused a libertarian
platform.
"I'm running because I think the
board is lacking in a certain point of
view, the libertarian point of view,"
she contended. "I would hope I would
-stimulate a few minds [on the board]
which have remained dormant too
