# Two Views On The CIA Problem
## 
### Harvard Crimson, Minnesota Daily 
Abolition
The New York Times's recent revelation
that the Central Intelligence Agency
systematically and illegally spied on
American citizens provided additional
evidence for a number of things people
should have known already.
It proved once again that Seymour Hersh
is the most important reporter in the United
States, and that high government officials
like to ignore the more unsavory aspects of
the unsavory policies they devise. And it
offered one more reason for abolishing the
CIA.
Reports of domestic CIA spying have been
current for years the one case the Times
cited, for example, was publicized by Jack
Anderson several years ago. Even though the
CIA need not account for its appropriations
to anyone, responsible public officials could
presumably have checked on CIA activities as
easily as Hersh could though they might
have involved questioning the assumptions
that led other high public officials, in the
Johnson administration, to have the CIA
focus on the United States as well as foreign
countries.
On a fundamental level, these assumptions
that a U.S.-enforced stability is always in
everyone's interests and that that stability
depends on the political success of whomever
holds power in Washington are the real
issues in the Times's revelations.
These assumptions permitted the United
States to use the CIA abroad in ways far
more ruthless (and often successful) than
anything it did at home to overthrow the
legitimate government of Guatemala, to
organize an invasion of revolutionary Cuba,
to mobilize a marauding army in the hills of
Cambodia and to subvert the freely elected

government of Chile.
President Ford's selections for his
"blue-ribbon" commission are certainly
unfortunate; choosing Ronald Reagan,
Nelson Rockefeller and Gen. Lyman
Lemnitzer, former Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to investigate the CIA is like
selecting Meyer Lansky, John N. Mitchell and
a Mafia hit man to investigate" organized
crime.
But Ford's choices become more
comprehensible if you remember that he
defends American intervention in Chile and
always appeared to think that antiwar dissent
bore close watching.
That the CIA is perfectly willing to break
the law, as a matter of policy, suggests that
even if government officials did question the
agency's assumptions, it would not readily
accede to piercemeal reform.
In overstepping its original charter the
CIA has proven that illegal acts are not only
essential for its operations but vital to its
existence. We need no investigations into
what should be done about the CIA. It needs
to be abolished altogether.

Harvard Crimson, and was written before the
Senate voted to investigate domestic
intelligence operations.)
Investigation
Former CIA director and current
Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger
says "misdemeanor" is too strong a term for
the minor transgressions of the CIA.
If any of the investigations into alleged
illegal agency activities do a proper job,
however, we are certain they will find that
involvement in the Ellsberg break-in, copious
connections with the Watergate break-in and
cover-up, alleged domestic spying on 10,000

U.S. citizens and who knows what else, far
transcend the scope of mere misdemeanors.
But the nation needs no presidential
blue-ribbon commission or Congressional
inquiry to find a more basic and illegal flow
in the CIA that should have been obvious for
years its unconstitutional secret funding.
Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7 of the
Constitution explicitly demands financial
accountability: "No money shall be drawn,
form the Treasury but in Consequence of
Appropriations made by Law; and a regular
Statement and Account of the Receipts and
Expenditures of all public money shall be
published from time to time."
No Direct Appropriations
Yet Congress has never appropriated
money directly to the CIA because funds for
this independent agency are secretly
channeled through other departments. Nor
has Congress ever demanded an account of its
expenditures.
The only rationale for keeping the CIA
appropriations secret is the all-inclusive
argument that national security and agency
efficiency demand it. But other intelligence
units such as the Defense Intelligence Agency
have been able to operate efficiently in spite
of disclosure of budget figures. We might add
that the other units haven't been cited for
illegalities either.
Last year the Senate voted 55-33 not to
hold the CIA to the Constitution to force it
to disclose its annual budget. Hopefully, after
investigating the series of sordid CIA
activities, Congress will overcome its illogical
awe and reverse that vote.
