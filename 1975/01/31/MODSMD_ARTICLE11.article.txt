# Letters--Parking, Quality Education
## 
### 
Tenuous Stand

Editor:
The stand of the University on
the current parking fee issue is
rather tenuous. There might be a
case for easy identification of
Stanford-related vehicles with
stickers or decals. With the sorry
state of the economy both in the
nation and within the University,
there might even be a case to
generate revenue to help pay,
among others, campus security
officers who keep their eyes on
such vehicles.
The needs might be there, but
the way the administration goes
about meeting them is
questionable. For example, the
University has already admitted
that the fee "bears little or no
relationship to .specific benefits
received by those individuals who
pay" it. And those individuals are
none other th&n students with
little or no income.
As for those with substantial
income, those who receive specific
benefits preferred parking
spaces they don't have to pay
because "free parking for faculty
and staff is a benefit often given
to employees by the companies."
There is nothing wrong with
such fringe benefits for
employees. Companies across the
state do it, though most private
and state schools charge staff and
faculty parking fees. But in
arguing for free parking for
employees, the University seems
to forget that in establishments
where this is the case, customers
get free parking too. Except at
schools, even where employees are
charged, customers still don't have
to pay. In both instances it is the
customer that gets preferred
treatment.
If the University is borrowing
leaves from business houses, it

might as well pick up one of the
most important leaf customers
come first; without them, the
staff would be out of work.
The University is not
consciously trying to drive its
customers away or is it?

Editor:
As a (more or less) prestigious
institute of higher learning,
Stanford might be expected to
encourage the pursuit of
excellence by its students, staff
and faculty. Indeed, President
Lyman, as the chief spokesman
for the University, has often
stressed the importance of
maintaining Stanford's excellence
in a time of financial difficulties.
I am certain everyone at

Stanford shares Lyman's hopes. I
am not certain, however, that this
University is making an honest
effort at promoting the quality
education that everyone seems to
want. In fact, I see education,
particularly undergraduate
education, deteriorating rapidly.
Enough has been written in
protest of the proposal to cut off
SWOPSI, SCIRE and Urban
Studies as individual programs for
me to belabor the point. However,
I can't neglect the issue
completely. It is symptomatic of
the University's worsening
condition.
Even more alarming to me was
the failure of the University to
grant tenure to Jerry Irish. This
action taken by the Appointment
and Promotions committee was
thoughtless, arbitrary and totally
unjustified. As a member of that
rare breed of truly excellent
teachers , Irish will leave an

incalculable void to the students
of Stanford. That the A& P
Committee can so blatantly ignore
the needs of the student body is
outrageous.
The message to be gleaned
from the University's recent
actions is ominous. Undergraduate
education has a very low priority
at Stanford. Prestige as an
objective, as evidenced by the
overemphasis on the publication
of faculty work, seems to rule.
The opinions of people outside
the University seem to be taking
precedence over those of the
people who actually experience
education here.
A disturbing black cloud of
hypocrisy is beginning to seep out
from the cracks in the
economically-weakened
foundation of the University. The
cruel irony is that a school that
emphasizes the pursuit of
excellence would not only settle
for a mediocre undergraduate
program, but would also actively
abet its further decay.
This year will be my last at
Stanford. I can't help but feel
relieved. At the same time, I hate
to desert a sinking ship. Thus, I
offer this protest, and I hope
other people will register theirs. It
may still be possible to overcome
what now seems inevitable.

little or no income.
As for those with substantial
income, those who receive specific
benefits preferred parking
spaces they don't have to pay
because "free parking for faculty
and staff is a benefit often given
to employees by the companies."
There is nothing wrong with
such fringe benefits for
employees. Companies across the
state do it, though most private
and state schools charge staff and
faculty parking fees. But in
arguing for free parking for
employees, the University seems
to forget that in establishments
where this is the case, customers
get free parking too. Except at
schools, even where employees are
charged, customers still don't have
to pay. In both instances it is the
customer that gets preferred
treatment.
If the University is borrowing
leaves from business houses, it

might as well pick up one of the
most important leaf customers
come first; without them, the
staff would be out of work.
The University is not
consciously trying to drive its
customers away or is it?

Overcome The Inevitable
Editor:
As a (more or less) prestigious
institute of higher learning,
Stanford might be expected to
encourage the pursuit of
excellence by its students, staff
and faculty. Indeed, President
Lyman, as the chief spokesman
for the University, has often
stressed the importance of
maintaining Stanford's excellence
in a time of financial difficulties.
I am certain everyone at

Stanford shares Lyman's hopes. I
am not certain, however, that this
University is making an honest
effort at promoting the quality
education that everyone seems to
want. In fact, I see education,
particularly undergraduate
education, deteriorating rapidly.
Enough has been written in
protest of the proposal to cut off
SWOPSI, SCIRE and Urban
Studies as individual programs for
me to belabor the point. However,
I can't neglect the issue
completely. It is symptomatic of
the University's worsening
condition.
Even more alarming to me was
the failure of the University to
grant tenure to Jerry Irish. This
action taken by the Appointment
and Promotions committee was
thoughtless, arbitrary and totally
unjustified. As a member of that
rare breed of truly excellent
teachers , Irish will leave an

incalculable void to the students
of Stanford. That the A& P
Committee can so blatantly ignore
the needs of the student body is
outrageous.
The message to be gleaned
from the University's recent
actions is ominous. Undergraduate
education has a very low priority
at Stanford. Prestige as an
objective, as evidenced by the
overemphasis on the publication
of faculty work, seems to rule.
The opinions of people outside
the University seem to be taking
precedence over those of the
people who actually experience
education here.
A disturbing black cloud of
hypocrisy is beginning to seep out
from the cracks in the
economically-weakened
foundation of the University. The
cruel irony is that a school that
emphasizes the pursuit of
excellence would not only settle
for a mediocre undergraduate
program, but would also actively
abet its further decay.
This year will be my last at
Stanford. I can't help but feel
relieved. At the same time, I hate
to desert a sinking ship. Thus, I
offer this protest, and I hope
other people will register theirs. It
may still be possible to overcome
what now seems inevitable.

The stand of the University on
the current parking fee issue is
rather tenuous. There might be a
case for easy identification of
Stanford-related vehicles with
stickers or decals. With the sorry
state of the economy both in the
nation and within the University,
there might even be a case to
generate revenue to help pay,
among others, campus security
officers who keep their eyes on
such vehicles.
The needs might be there, but
the way the administration goes
about meeting them is
questionable. For example, the
University has already admitted
that the fee "bears little or no
relationship to .specific benefits
received by those individuals who
pay" it. And those individuals are
none other th&n students with
little or no income.
