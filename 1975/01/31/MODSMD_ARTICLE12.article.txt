Sometimes the business of putting out a newspaper is
no fun. Yesterday was one of those times.
The news that Communication Prof. William Rivers
suffered a stroke was as unwelcome and painful to us as it
was to the rest of his friends and it is a mark of Rivers'
exuberant personality that nearly everyone who knows
him counts him as a friend.
As one of the most overworked people on campus
he's constantly writing articles, critiquing student work
and planning new projects Rivers could easily barricade
himself inside his office, protected by hordes of
secretaries and filing cabinets. But he doesn't: not one of
us can ever remember being turned away when we went
to him with a problem. And somehow he still finds time
to do things like sitting on the Daily's Board of Directors.
We're sure we're not alone in sending him our
heart-felt wishes for a speedy recovery.
