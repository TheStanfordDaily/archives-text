# Refugee Problem
## 
### Robert Smith 
Merritt Ruhlen claims that my
history of the Middle East is a
"fairy tale,"(Daily, Jan. 6). If so,
it still contains a good deal more
truth and accuracy than does his
argument for the elimination of
Israel.
The Palestinian refugee camps
in the Arab countries are not
Israeli-made, but Arab-made, for
they serve as useful propaganda
weapons. Surely, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Libya and other great
Arab oil-producing countries have
enough money to move these
wretched Palestinians into homes,
and give them food.
Ruhlen asks: "Will there ever
come a day when the wealth of
the United States is used to save
the starving rather than oppress
the living?" I agree: the Jan. 10
Daily reports: "In another
escalation of the Middle East arms
build-up, Saudi Arabia announced
yesterday the purchase of $756
million worth of jet fighters from
the United States." Think,
Ruhlen, how many Palestinian
refugees could have been
sheltered, clothed, and fed with
that $756 million. Think of how
many starving could have been
saved, but instead were sacrificed
to jet fighters which will oppress
the living.
True, Israel was founded on
terrorism, and on the killing of
innocent civilians. Those killings
were not condonable. But since
when does that make present
Israeli criticism of terrorism
hypocritical? The German
government murdered, not 254
Arabs as at Dir Yassin, but 6
million Jews, in World War 11.
Does that mean that the Germans
now are hypocritical if they
criticize random killing?
The Jews have no more
"inherent" right to return to
Palestine merely because they
once lived there in 135 AD (as
Ruhlen claims I say they do) than
the Palestinians have an "inhrent"
right to return to Palestine
because they once lived there in
1947.
Argument Invalid
Ruhlen should realize that the
argument of "who once lived
there" is not a viable one, and can
be claimed for neither Palestinians
nor Jews. All it can do (and all I
tried to do in my original article)
is illustrate the ties of a people to
a land. In this case, we must
recognize the fact that both Jews
and Palestinians have deep ties to
Palestine.
Ruhlen asks me where I "think
all these people [the
approximately three million Jews
who have settled in Israel from
1880 until today] came from" if
not from Europe. If Ruhlen's
knowledge of the Middle East and
Israel were as great as he claims it
is, he would know that well over
half of the Israeli Jewish
population is comprised of
"Oriental" Jews; i.e.,
non-European Jews who lived in
Middle Eastern Arab countries
prior to 1948, a large number of
whom were expelled from these
countries in or after 1948. I must
repeat again: Israel is not a
creation of imperialists; it is the
centuries-long desire and creation
of the Jewish people.
Furthermore, if Ruhlen would
read the Palestinian National
Covenant, the authoritative and
recognized- statement of .PLO
goals, as well as a copy of Yassir
Arafat's speech to the United
Nations, he would find out that
the PLO does demand the
expulsion from a Palestinian
secular democratic state of all
Jews who emigrated to Palestine
after the "Zionist invasion" (as
Arafat called it), which he dates as
1881.

Finally, I agree with Ruhlen:
the Middle East is America's
problem. More than that, it is
everyone's problem. There should
be no Palestinian refugees, there
should be no Palestinian
terrorism, there should be no
Israeli bombing. But attempting
to eliminate these problems by
destroying Israel is both foolish
and repugnant to common sense.
Instead, let us strive to create a
peaceful Middle East, one in
which exist, side by side, a Jewish
state and a Palestinian state. Let
us recognize the rights of all
peoples, and seek to protect them.

approximately three million Jews
who have settled in Israel from
1880 until today] came from" if
not from Europe. If Ruhlen's
knowledge of the Middle East and
Israel were as great as he claims it
is, he would know that well over
half of the Israeli Jewish
population is comprised of
"Oriental" Jews; i.e.,
non-European Jews who lived in
Middle Eastern Arab countries
prior to 1948, a large number of
whom were expelled from these
countries in or after 1948. I must
repeat again: Israel is not a
creation of imperialists; it is the
centuries-long desire and creation
of the Jewish people.
Furthermore, if Ruhlen would
read the Palestinian National
Covenant, the authoritative and
recognized- statement of .PLO
goals, as well as a copy of Yassir
Arafat's speech to the United
Nations, he would find out that
the PLO does demand the
expulsion from a Palestinian
secular democratic state of all
Jews who emigrated to Palestine
after the "Zionist invasion" (as
Arafat called it), which he dates as
1881.

Finally, I agree with Ruhlen:
the Middle East is America's
problem. More than that, it is
everyone's problem. There should
be no Palestinian refugees, there
should be no Palestinian
terrorism, there should be no
Israeli bombing. But attempting
to eliminate these problems by
destroying Israel is both foolish
and repugnant to common sense.
Instead, let us strive to create a
peaceful Middle East, one in
which exist, side by side, a Jewish
state and a Palestinian state. Let
us recognize the rights of all
peoples, and seek to protect them.

majoring in history, is currently at

Merritt Ruhlen claims that my
history of the Middle East is a
"fairy tale,"(Daily, Jan. 6). If so,
it still contains a good deal more
truth and accuracy than does his
argument for the elimination of
Israel.
The Palestinian refugee camps
in the Arab countries are not
Israeli-made, but Arab-made, for
they serve as useful propaganda
weapons. Surely, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Libya and other great
Arab oil-producing countries have
enough money to move these
wretched Palestinians into homes,
and give them food.
Ruhlen asks: "Will there ever
come a day when the wealth of
the United States is used to save
the starving rather than oppress
the living?" I agree: the Jan. 10
Daily reports: "In another
escalation of the Middle East arms
build-up, Saudi Arabia announced
yesterday the purchase of $756
million worth of jet fighters from
the United States." Think,
Ruhlen, how many Palestinian
refugees could have been
sheltered, clothed, and fed with
that $756 million. Think of how
many starving could have been
saved, but instead were sacrificed
to jet fighters which will oppress
the living.
True, Israel was founded on
terrorism, and on the killing of
innocent civilians. Those killings
were not condonable. But since
when does that make present
Israeli criticism of terrorism
hypocritical? The German
government murdered, not 254
Arabs as at Dir Yassin, but 6
million Jews, in World War 11.
Does that mean that the Germans
now are hypocritical if they
criticize random killing?
The Jews have no more
"inherent" right to return to
Palestine merely because they
once lived there in 135 AD (as
Ruhlen claims I say they do) than
the Palestinians have an "inhrent"
right to return to Palestine
because they once lived there in
1947.
Argument Invalid
Ruhlen should realize that the
argument of "who once lived
there" is not a viable one, and can
be claimed for neither Palestinians
nor Jews. All it can do (and all I
tried to do in my original article)
is illustrate the ties of a people to
a land. In this case, we must
recognize the fact that both Jews
and Palestinians have deep ties to
Palestine.
Ruhlen asks me where I "think
all these people [the
approximately three million Jews
who have settled in Israel from
1880 until today] came from" if
not from Europe. If Ruhlen's
knowledge of the Middle East and
Israel were as great as he claims it
is, he would know that well over
half of the Israeli Jewish
population is comprised of
"Oriental" Jews; i.e.,
non-European Jews who lived in
Middle Eastern Arab countries

whom were expelled from these
countries in or after 1948. I must
