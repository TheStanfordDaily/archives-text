# Death And Clemency: Both Under Attack
## Lawyers Girl For War On Executions, And Draft Resisters Sneer At Ford Plan 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ WILLIAM ROSS 
The death penalty is on trial again.
When the U.S. Supreme Court hea the
appeal of Jesse Fowler, convicte of
murdering a former roommate, it will l- the
first review of capital punishment since 972.
That year the Court ruled capital punislnent
as then applied violated the %hth
Amendment injunction against "cruel and
unusual punishment."
The' ruling effectively struck the eath
penalty from the nation's statute books. Vhat
the Court majority objected to wa: the
universal practice of leaving the applicatin of
the death penalty up to the discretia of
jurors.
Justice Potter Stewart criticized thelegal
systems which "permit this unique penay to
be so wantonly and freakishly imposed."
Mandatory
Since that ruling some 26 states, inclding
California, have legislated mandatory eath
sentences for specific crimes.
Thus the Fowler case, schediiec for
argument by June, sets the stage for aposible
landmark decision on the constitutioialty of
capital punishment itself.
"We've got an uphill fight," idnitted
Stanford Law Prof. Anthony Amtedam,
counselor for Fowler and a l»n(-time
opponent of the death penalty.
The 39-year old legal expert nctes that
Justices William J.Brennan,ThurgoodVlarshall
and William O. Douglas would have <utHwed
capital punishment, no matte how
administered, in 1972. The other najority
judges in the split deicision decliied to
commit themselves.
But that may change now. "Judge! are iot
immune from public pressure," nctes
Amsterdam and he believes most sentmen is
pro-capital punishment.
Conservatism
The growing conservatism of the Cout
should also be taken into account. In recet
decisions the high court has sometimes showi
a reluctance to decide controversial issue,
preferring to leave them to state or loci
arbitration.
Amsterdam's skill and experience he ha
argued before the Supreme Court 15 times -
may be much in Fowler's favor.
"He's the. most capable lawyer I know,'
says Jerome Falk Jr., a San Francisco lawye
and Amsterdam's partner in their fight agains
the death penalty.
Falk is quick to add, however, that "this i
the kind of case where the abilities of lawyer
to be persuasive are slightly less influential.'
Oral Arguments
Falk himself will present the oral
arguments in the first California Supreme
Court case on the state's new death penalty
devised after voters overturned a couri
decision that the punishment wa;
unconstitutional. Capital punishment ir
California will be under attack from severa
angles by Falk and Amsterdam, who wrote
the brief for the Bernard case.
"We are asking that Proposition 17 be
declared unconstitutional," Falk says
.Proposition 17 would permit discretionary
death penalty statutes, the precise kind
declared unconstitutional for the entire
United States by the 1972 Supreme Court
decision.
"We also argue ... that capital punishment
under the statute is really not mandatory at
all," Falk says. There is still a great deal of
discretion in deciding what charges are to be
pressed and in the widespread practice of
plea-bargaining, he adds.

The Ford Administration seems amazed by
the poor response to its clemency and earned
re-entry programs for Vietnam-era draft
resisters.
Officials just can't understand why men
who refused to fight aren't willing to
contritely admit the folly of their anti-war
beliefs, surrender important constitutional
rights and work for up to two years at menial
jobs in order to clear their military records.
Clemency Board Chairman Charles
Goodell's contention that most men who
qualify for the program are unaware of their
eligibility is a glaringly lame excuse.
Most draft violators probably are shunning
the program because they believe that at best
it compromises their consciences and at worst
involves them in a tangle of legal
compliations.
But Goodell rightly perceives that the

public as well as most men eligible for the
programs are badly misinformed about Ford's
newly extended clemency system. Perhaps
Goodell's recent 15-city tour helped to
remove some misconceptions.
First, many people confuse clemency with
amnesty. Clemency conditionally expurges
unfavorable draft records on an individual
basis. Amnesty, on the other hand, pardons an
entire group. Contrary to popular opinion,
Ford has never proposed an "amnesty"
program.
Furthermore, Ford's program has three
distinct parts. The first, administered by a
presidential clemency board, allows the
110,000 men who received draft convictions
between 1964 and 1973 to apply for removal
of convictions from their records. Only a few
thousand men have applied for clemency.
The second part of the program is
administered by the Justice Department and
allows unconvicted draft evaders most of
whom live abraod to re-enter the United
States if they promise to work in "alternate
service" for two years. Although 6200 men
qualify for this program, only 300 have
applied for participation.
Response
The third program allows unconvicted
draft deserters to re-enter the nation or
come out of hiding if they promise to work
for up to two years in government service.
About 40 percent of the 13,500 men eligible
for this program have responded to it.
In a Daily interview last week, Goodell's
explanations .for the poor response to the last
Defense and Justice Department programs
were as tenuous as his excuse for the ignoral
of the clemency plan.
Goodall claimed that most of the men who
qualify for the programs are living in Canada
and are "satisfied with their lives" there.
Goodell also admitted, however, that some
of them might be disgruntled by some certain
provisions in the program.
One needn't wonder why.
Confession
All men who wish to take advantage of the
programs must first sign a statement which is
tantamount to a confession of guilt. Since
most draft violators believe that their actions
were both moral and courageous, the Ford
administration is naive to believe that many
men will sign such a document.
Attaching two years of alternative service
to this provision only compounds resentment
by imposing a quasi-penal sentence on men,
most of whom believe that they have
committed no wrong.
Furthermore, Ford's program forces draft
violators to explicitly waive their
constitutional rights to a speedy trial and
protection against double jeopardy.
Both provisions give the Justice
Department a freer hand in prosecuting men
who violate alternative service provisions. In
effect, they reduce draft evaders to
second-class citizenship.
Finally, Ford's programs are not as
extensive as many people suppose. Although a
half million men received dishonorable
discharges during the Vietnam War only those
100,000 with draft violations fall under the
program's provisions.
Goodell can stump the country for months
to come, but it is unlikely that many more
draft evaders will respond to his appeals to
turn themselves in. The reason is just the
opposite of what Goodell probably thinks.
The draft violators don't know too little
about Ford's program. They know too much.

jobs in order to clear their military records.
Clemency Board Chairman Charles
Goodell's contention that most men who
qualify for the program are unaware of their
eligibility is a glaringly lame excuse.
Most draft violators probably are shunning
the program because they believe that at best
it compromises their consciences and at worst
involves them in a tangle of legal
compliations.
But Goodell rightly perceives that the

public as well as most men eligible for the
programs are badly misinformed about Ford's
newly extended clemency system. Perhaps
Goodell's recent 15-city tour helped to
remove some misconceptions.
First, many people confuse clemency with
amnesty. Clemency conditionally expurges
unfavorable draft records on an individual
basis. Amnesty, on the other hand, pardons an
entire group. Contrary to popular opinion,
Ford has never proposed an "amnesty"
program.
Furthermore, Ford's program has three
distinct parts. The first, administered by a
presidential clemency board, allows the
110,000 men who received draft convictions
between 1964 and 1973 to apply for removal
of convictions from their records. Only a few
thousand men have applied for clemency.
The second part of the program is
administered by the Justice Department and
allows unconvicted draft evaders most of
whom live abraod to re-enter the United
States if they promise to work in "alternate
service" for two years. Although 6200 men
qualify for this program, only 300 have
applied for participation.
Response
The third program allows unconvicted
draft deserters to re-enter the nation or
come out of hiding if they promise to work
for up to two years in government service.
About 40 percent of the 13,500 men eligible
for this program have responded to it.
In a Daily interview last week, Goodell's
explanations .for the poor response to the last
Defense and Justice Department programs
were as tenuous as his excuse for the ignoral
of the clemency plan.
Goodall claimed that most of the men who
qualify for the programs are living in Canada
and are "satisfied with their lives" there.
Goodell also admitted, however, that some
of them might be disgruntled by some certain
provisions in the program.
One needn't wonder why.
Confession
All men who wish to take advantage of the
programs must first sign a statement which is
tantamount to a confession of guilt. Since
most draft violators believe that their actions
were both moral and courageous, the Ford
administration is naive to believe that many
men will sign such a document.
Attaching two years of alternative service
to this provision only compounds resentment
by imposing a quasi-penal sentence on men,
most of whom believe that they have
committed no wrong.
Furthermore, Ford's program forces draft
violators to explicitly waive their
constitutional rights to a speedy trial and
protection against double jeopardy.
Both provisions give the Justice
Department a freer hand in prosecuting men
who violate alternative service provisions. In
effect, they reduce draft evaders to
second-class citizenship.
Finally, Ford's programs are not as
extensive as many people suppose. Although a
half million men received dishonorable
discharges during the Vietnam War only those
100,000 with draft violations fall under the
program's provisions.
Goodell can stump the country for months
to come, but it is unlikely that many more
draft evaders will respond to his appeals to
turn themselves in. The reason is just the
opposite of what Goodell probably thinks.
The draft violators don't know too little
about Ford's program. They know too much.
The death penalty is on trial again.
When the U.S. Supreme Court hea the
appeal of Jesse Fowler, convicte of
murdering a former roommate, it will l- the
first review of capital punishment since 972.
That year the Court ruled capital punislnent
as then applied violated the %hth
Amendment injunction against "cruel and
unusual punishment."
The' ruling effectively struck the eath
penalty from the nation's statute books. Vhat
the Court majority objected to wa: the
universal practice of leaving the applicatin of
the death penalty up to the discretia of
jurors.
Justice Potter Stewart criticized thelegal
systems which "permit this unique penay to
be so wantonly and freakishly imposed."
Mandatory
Since that ruling some 26 states, inclding
California, have legislated mandatory eath
sentences for specific crimes.
Thus the Fowler case, schediiec for
argument by June, sets the stage for aposible
landmark decision on the constitutioialty of
capital punishment itself.
"We've got an uphill fight," idnitted
Stanford Law Prof. Anthony Amtedam,
counselor for Fowler and a l»n(-time
opponent of the death penalty.
The 39-year old legal expert nctes that
Justices William J.Brennan,ThurgoodVlarshall
and William O. Douglas would have <utHwed
capital punishment, no matte how
administered, in 1972. The other najority
judges in the split deicision decliied to
commit themselves.
But that may change now. "Judge! are iot
immune from public pressure," nctes
Amsterdam and he believes most sentmen is
pro-capital punishment.
Conservatism
The growing conservatism of the Cout
should also be taken into account. In recet
decisions the high court has sometimes showi
a reluctance to decide controversial issue,
preferring to leave them to state or loci
arbitration.
Amsterdam's skill and experience he ha
argued before the Supreme Court 15 times -
may be much in Fowler's favor.
"He's the. most capable lawyer I know,'
says Jerome Falk Jr., a San Francisco lawye
and Amsterdam's partner in their fight agains
the death penalty.
Falk is quick to add, however, that "this i
the kind of case where the abilities of lawyer
to be persuasive are slightly less influential.'
Oral Arguments
Falk himself will present the oral
arguments in the first California Supreme
Court case on the state's new death penalty
devised after voters overturned a couri
decision that the punishment wa;
unconstitutional. Capital punishment ir
California will be under attack from severa
angles by Falk and Amsterdam, who wrote
the brief for the Bernard case.
"We are asking that Proposition 17 be
declared unconstitutional," Falk says
.Proposition 17 would permit discretionary
death penalty statutes, the precise kind
declared unconstitutional for the entire
United States by the 1972 Supreme Court
decision.
"We also argue ... that capital punishment
under the statute is really not mandatory at
all," Falk says. There is still a great deal of
discretion in deciding what charges are to be
pressed and in the widespread practice of
plea-bargaining, he adds.

The Ford Administration seems amazed by
the poor response to its clemency and earned
re-entry programs for Vietnam-era draft
resisters.
Officials just can't understand why men
who refused to fight aren't willing to
contritely admit the folly of their anti-war
beliefs, surrender important constitutional
rights and work for up to two years at menial
jobs in order to clear their military records.

The death penalty is on trial again.
When the U.S. Supreme Court hea the
appeal of Jesse Fowler, convicte of
murdering a former roommate, it will l- the
first review of capital punishment since 972.
That year the Court ruled capital punislnent
as then applied violated the %hth
Amendment injunction against "cruel and
unusual punishment."
The' ruling effectively struck the eath
penalty from the nation's statute books. Vhat
the Court majority objected to wa: the
universal practice of leaving the applicatin of
the death penalty up to the discretia of
jurors.
Justice Potter Stewart criticized thelegal
systems which "permit this unique penay to
be so wantonly and freakishly imposed."
Mandatory
Since that ruling some 26 states, inclding
California, have legislated mandatory eath
sentences for specific crimes.
Thus the Fowler case, schediiec for
argument by June, sets the stage for aposible
landmark decision on the constitutioialty of
capital punishment itself.
"We've got an uphill fight," idnitted
Stanford Law Prof. Anthony Amtedam,
counselor for Fowler and a l»n(-time
opponent of the death penalty.
The 39-year old legal expert nctes that
Justices William J.Brennan,ThurgoodVlarshall
and William O. Douglas would have <utHwed
capital punishment, no matte how
administered, in 1972. The other najority
judges in the split deicision decliied to
commit themselves.
But that may change now. "Judge! are iot
immune from public pressure," nctes
Amsterdam and he believes most sentmen is
pro-capital punishment.
Conservatism
The growing conservatism of the Cout
should also be taken into account. In recet
decisions the high court has sometimes showi
a reluctance to decide controversial issue,
preferring to leave them to state or loci
arbitration.
Amsterdam's skill and experience he ha
argued before the Supreme Court 15 times -
may be much in Fowler's favor.
"He's the. most capable lawyer I know,'
says Jerome Falk Jr., a San Francisco lawye
and Amsterdam's partner in their fight agains
the death penalty.
Falk is quick to add, however, that "this i
the kind of case where the abilities of lawyer
to be persuasive are slightly less influential.'
Oral Arguments
Falk himself will present the oral
arguments in the first California Supreme
Court case on the state's new death penalty
devised after voters overturned a couri
decision that the punishment wa;
unconstitutional. Capital punishment ir
California will be under attack from severa
angles by Falk and Amsterdam, who wrote
the brief for the Bernard case.
"We are asking that Proposition 17 be
declared unconstitutional," Falk says
.Proposition 17 would permit discretionary
death penalty statutes, the precise kind
declared unconstitutional for the entire
United States by the 1972 Supreme Court
decision.
"We also argue ... that capital punishment
under the statute is really not mandatory at
all," Falk says. There is still a great deal of
discretion in deciding what charges are to be
pressed and in the widespread practice of
plea-bargaining, he adds.

The Ford Administration seems amazed by
the poor response to its clemency and earned
re-entry programs for Vietnam-era draft
resisters.
Officials just can't understand why men
who refused to fight aren't willing to
contritely admit the folly of their anti-war
beliefs, surrender important constitutional
rights and work for up to two years at menial
jobs in order to clear their military records.
Clemency Board Chairman Charles
Goodell's contention that most men who
qualify for the program are unaware of their
eligibility is a glaringly lame excuse.
Most draft violators probably are shunning
the program because they believe that at best
it compromises their consciences and at worst
involves them in a tangle of legal
compliations.
But Goodell rightly perceives that the

public as well as most men eligible for the
programs are badly misinformed about Ford's
newly extended clemency system. Perhaps
Goodell's recent 15-city tour helped to
remove some misconceptions.
First, many people confuse clemency with
amnesty. Clemency conditionally expurges
unfavorable draft records on an individual
basis. Amnesty, on the other hand, pardons an
entire group. Contrary to popular opinion,
Ford has never proposed an "amnesty"
program.
Furthermore, Ford's program has three
distinct parts. The first, administered by a
presidential clemency board, allows the
110,000 men who received draft convictions
between 1964 and 1973 to apply for removal
of convictions from their records. Only a few
thousand men have applied for clemency.
The second part of the program is
administered by the Justice Department and
allows unconvicted draft evaders most of
whom live abraod to re-enter the United
States if they promise to work in "alternate
service" for two years. Although 6200 men
qualify for this program, only 300 have
applied for participation.
Response
The third program allows unconvicted
draft deserters to re-enter the nation or
come out of hiding if they promise to work
for up to two years in government service.
About 40 percent of the 13,500 men eligible
for this program have responded to it.
In a Daily interview last week, Goodell's
explanations .for the poor response to the last
Defense and Justice Department programs
were as tenuous as his excuse for the ignoral
of the clemency plan.
Goodall claimed that most of the men who
qualify for the programs are living in Canada
and are "satisfied with their lives" there.
Goodell also admitted, however, that some
of them might be disgruntled by some certain
provisions in the program.
One needn't wonder why.
Confession
All men who wish to take advantage of the
programs must first sign a statement which is
tantamount to a confession of guilt. Since
most draft violators believe that their actions
were both moral and courageous, the Ford
administration is naive to believe that many
men will sign such a document.
Attaching two years of alternative service
to this provision only compounds resentment
by imposing a quasi-penal sentence on men,
most of whom believe that they have
committed no wrong.
Furthermore, Ford's program forces draft
violators to explicitly waive their
constitutional rights to a speedy trial and
protection against double jeopardy.
Both provisions give the Justice
Department a freer hand in prosecuting men
who violate alternative service provisions. In
effect, they reduce draft evaders to
second-class citizenship.
Finally, Ford's programs are not as
extensive as many people suppose. Although a
half million men received dishonorable
discharges during the Vietnam War only those
100,000 with draft violations fall under the
program's provisions.
Goodell can stump the country for months
to come, but it is unlikely that many more
draft evaders will respond to his appeals to
turn themselves in. The reason is just the
opposite of what Goodell probably thinks.
The draft violators don't know too little
about Ford's program. They know too much.

Goodell's contention that most men who
qualify for the program are unaware of their
eligibility is a glaringly lame excuse.
Most draft violators probably are shunning
the program because they believe that at best
it compromises their consciences and at worst
involves them in a tangle of legal
compliations.
But Goodell rightly perceives that the

public as well as most men eligible for the
programs are badly misinformed about Ford's
newly extended clemency system. Perhaps
Goodell's recent 15-city tour helped to
remove some misconceptions.
First, many people confuse clemency with
amnesty. Clemency conditionally expurges
unfavorable draft records on an individual
basis. Amnesty, on the other hand, pardons an
entire group. Contrary to popular opinion,
Ford has never proposed an "amnesty"
program.
Furthermore, Ford's program has three
distinct parts. The first, administered by a
presidential clemency board, allows the
110,000 men who received draft convictions
between 1964 and 1973 to apply for removal
of convictions from their records. Only a few
thousand men have applied for clemency.
The second part of the program is
administered by the Justice Department and
allows unconvicted draft evaders most of
whom live abraod to re-enter the United
States if they promise to work in "alternate
service" for two years. Although 6200 men
qualify for this program, only 300 have
applied for participation.
Response
The third program allows unconvicted
draft deserters to re-enter the nation or
come out of hiding if they promise to work
for up to two years in government service.
About 40 percent of the 13,500 men eligible
for this program have responded to it.
In a Daily interview last week, Goodell's
explanations .for the poor response to the last
Defense and Justice Department programs
were as tenuous as his excuse for the ignoral
of the clemency plan.
Goodall claimed that most of the men who
qualify for the programs are living in Canada
and are "satisfied with their lives" there.
Goodell also admitted, however, that some
of them might be disgruntled by some certain
provisions in the program.
One needn't wonder why.
Confession
All men who wish to take advantage of the
programs must first sign a statement which is
tantamount to a confession of guilt. Since
most draft violators believe that their actions
were both moral and courageous, the Ford
administration is naive to believe that many
men will sign such a document.
Attaching two years of alternative service
to this provision only compounds resentment
by imposing a quasi-penal sentence on men,
most of whom believe that they have
committed no wrong.
Furthermore, Ford's program forces draft
violators to explicitly waive their
constitutional rights to a speedy trial and
protection against double jeopardy.
Both provisions give the Justice
Department a freer hand in prosecuting men
who violate alternative service provisions. In
effect, they reduce draft evaders to
second-class citizenship.
Finally, Ford's programs are not as
extensive as many people suppose. Although a
half million men received dishonorable
discharges during the Vietnam War only those
100,000 with draft violations fall under the
program's provisions.
Goodell can stump the country for months
to come, but it is unlikely that many more
draft evaders will respond to his appeals to
turn themselves in. The reason is just the
opposite of what Goodell probably thinks.
The draft violators don't know too little
about Ford's program. They know too much.
