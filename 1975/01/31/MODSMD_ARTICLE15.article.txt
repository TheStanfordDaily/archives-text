# Research, Teaching: What Wins?
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The University's decision to deny Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish tenure, once again
spotlights Stanford's emphasis on publishing
and research versus teaching.
Irish has been recognized, by the
University and its students, as one of its finer
teachers. He is one of only a handful of
individuals to win the Walter J. Gores
Teaching Award since its inception a few
years ago.
Students interviewed unanimously
applauded Irish's ability in the classroom, on
both undergraduate and graduate levels.
Noted one religious studies major: "He is one
of the best discussion leaders I've had. .. He
really is interested in what the students
think."
And students also are impressed by Irish's
availability. They maintain he's always ready
to discuss problems with them and that he
fosters a genuine interest in their welfare.
Excellent
As a teacher, one must conclude that Irish
is regarded as excellent, by just about
anyone's standards. Yet despite this glowing
praise, Irish was denied tenure by the
Appointments and Promotion Committee
(A & P Committee).
The reason: lack of publishing and
insufficient show of academic promise.
Assuming that the A & P Committee made
its decision consistently with its guiding
criteria, this poses some intriguing questions
about the values at Stanford.
Consider first what Irish's shortcomings
were in the eyes of the Committee.
Publication
In the last year and a half, Irish has
published two articles in professional journals
in his field and has written a number of book
reviews. He just completed a chapter for a
book in the prestigious Library of Living
Philosophers series.
His first book, Boy Thirteen, is scheduled
for March publication. Not strictly related to
his scholastic area, the book relates some of
Irish's personal experiences and observations.
"Technically, the book is not a 'scholarly
work'" in the sense of the tenure
requirements, Irish said.
"I left it up to the department whether to
submit it to the committee," he explained.
"They thought it was scholarly and included
it."
Irish's department, as well as outside

referees called in to assess his scholarship, felt
very strongly that these writing efforts
indicated academic achievement and promise.
The A & P Committee disagreed.
Irish wondered how the committee could
ignore the opinions of scholars in his own
field, especially since none of the members of
the A & P Committee is expert in the area.
More Evidence?
"I would like to see more tangible evidence
of this [lack of scholarship]," he added.
Those publications prepresent Irish's total
output for a period of seven and a half years,
an output the committee found inadequate.
The final decision on his tenure was actually
delayed a year because of Irish's personal
troubles two of his children died during the
last four years although many critics of the
decision believe he should have been granted
another extension.
But as one of Irish's colleagues noted, "the

writing is on the wall" regarding the
requirements for tenure. Junior faculty
members know what they must do to make
tenure and that, purely and simply, is
publish, she said.
Explaining that when it came to choosing
priorities that he had emphasized the teaching
over research, Irish speculated that other
junior faculty members would be less inclined
to make that commitment in view of the
recent decision.
"When Gibbs asks a junior faculty member
to be on a SWOPSI board, he is taking time
away from writing," Irish continued. "If they
know that this activity really doesn't matter
much, they won't join that committee."
All of which raises one big question: what
kind of an education is an undergraduate
receiving for the sizeable sums of money he is
spending at Stanford?

"When Gibbs asks a junior faculty member
to be on a SWOPSI board, he is taking time
away from writing," Irish continued. "If they
know that this activity really doesn't matter
much, they won't join that committee."
All of which raises one big question: what
kind of an education is an undergraduate
receiving for the sizeable sums of money he is
spending at Stanford?
The University's decision to deny Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish tenure, once again
spotlights Stanford's emphasis on publishing
and research versus teaching.
Irish has been recognized, by the
University and its students, as one of its finer
teachers. He is one of only a handful of
individuals to win the Walter J. Gores
Teaching Award since its inception a few
years ago.
Students interviewed unanimously
applauded Irish's ability in the classroom, on
both undergraduate and graduate levels.
Noted one religious studies major: "He is one
of the best discussion leaders I've had. .. He
really is interested in what the students
think."
And students also are impressed by Irish's
availability. They maintain he's always ready
to discuss problems with them and that he
fosters a genuine interest in their welfare.
Excellent
As a teacher, one must conclude that Irish
is regarded as excellent, by just about
anyone's standards. Yet despite this glowing
praise, Irish was denied tenure by the
Appointments and Promotion Committee
(A & P Committee).
The reason: lack of publishing and
insufficient show of academic promise.
Assuming that the A & P Committee made
its decision consistently with its guiding
criteria, this poses some intriguing questions
about the values at Stanford.
Consider first what Irish's shortcomings
were in the eyes of the Committee.
Publication
In the last year and a half, Irish has
published two articles in professional journals
in his field and has written a number of book
reviews. He just completed a chapter for a
book in the prestigious Library of Living
Philosophers series.
His first book, Boy Thirteen, is scheduled
for March publication. Not strictly related to
his scholastic area, the book relates some of
Irish's personal experiences and observations.
"Technically, the book is not a 'scholarly
work'" in the sense of the tenure
requirements, Irish said.
"I left it up to the department whether to
submit it to the committee," he explained.
"They thought it was scholarly and included
it."
Irish's department, as well as outside

referees called in to assess his scholarship, felt
very strongly that these writing efforts
indicated academic achievement and promise.
The A & P Committee disagreed.
Irish wondered how the committee could
ignore the opinions of scholars in his own
field, especially since none of the members of
the A & P Committee is expert in the area.
More Evidence?
"I would like to see more tangible evidence
of this [lack of scholarship]," he added.
Those publications prepresent Irish's total
output for a period of seven and a half years,
an output the committee found inadequate.
The final decision on his tenure was actually
delayed a year because of Irish's personal
troubles two of his children died during the
last four years although many critics of the
decision believe he should have been granted
another extension.
But as one of Irish's colleagues noted, "the

writing is on the wall" regarding the
requirements for tenure. Junior faculty
members know what they must do to make
tenure and that, purely and simply, is
publish, she said.
Explaining that when it came to choosing
priorities that he had emphasized the teaching
over research, Irish speculated that other
junior faculty members would be less inclined
to make that commitment in view of the
recent decision.
