# Students Head For Court In Parking Fee Fight
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
I The students are taking the University
to court.
Individual and class action suits were
expected to have been filed by this
morning in Santa Clara County Superior
Court, demanding that the campus police
be prevented from ticketing student
vehicles without the controversial $7.50
parking stickers.
Attorney Dent Hand said the suit is a
| ' "representative action." Plaintiffs in the
case are the ASSU, Kathleen Colson
(representing the residents of Escondido
| Village), and Tom Dery. Dery's action is
both an individual suit and on behalf of the
students..
According to ASSU Sen. Mike Lindsey,
the class action suit is being filed on two
grounds. The first argues that students
"never agreed, upon entering the
University, to make a parking contract,"
and that technically, residents of
University housing have already paid for
I parking areas.

He conceded that there were problems
with the grounds of the suit, but said he
still thought they had a strong case.
However, the Single Student Housing
Office said yesterday that all students
living in single student housing on campus
must sign a housing contract, agreeing to
the provisions set forth in the general
information booklet on Stanford
residences. That booklet states that all
residents with vehicles on campus must
register their car with the campus police
and pay a registration fee.
Michael Hudnall, associate staff counsel
for the vice president of business and
finance, said he could find nothing in the
Escondido Village rental agreement
concerning payment for parking spaces for
the residents. However, he added that it
did not guarantee free parking either.
So next week, two opposing groups may
begin to fight over an issue they both
would prefer to settle out of court. But
right now a compromise just doesn't look
possible.
