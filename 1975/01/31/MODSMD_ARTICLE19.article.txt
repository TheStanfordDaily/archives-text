## The 						Reel World 'Godfather II': Sequel Not Up To Original 
### George Powell 
How about a sequel to Gone
With the Wind without Clark
Gable? Or Sound of Music, Part
II without Julie Andrews? That's
part of what The Godfather, Part
II is up against, without one
glimpse of Marlon Brando, whose
portrayal of Vito Corleone won
the Academy Award for best
actor.
However, Brando's character
Vito is in Part H, along with A1
Pacino reprising his part as son
Michael. But, young Vito, growing
up in New York City from 1917
on is played by Robert DiNiro,
whose movie reputation to date
has been made by portraying
loveable louts of low IQ (the
catcher in Bang the Drum Slowly,
and a small-minded, small-time
hoodlum in Mean Streets).
DiNiro, though, excels as
young Vito, adopting many of the
mannerisms Brando brought to
the characterization, and making
them seem even more natural than
with Brando.
So what's really wrong with

Godfather, Part II then?
Everybody from Part I is back
who wasn't killed off, and Francis
Ford Coppola is again the
director, with even more control
than he had over the first part.
This time Coppola is both
producer and director, as well as
co-authoring the screenplay.
Over Involvement
That's part of the problem,,
over-involvement. The second
problem is that even with a
last-minute re-editing job by
Coppola himself, the film is
choppier and more episodic than-
Part I, and at 3 hours and 15
minutes running time, about a
half hour too long.
The wide-ranging nature of the
film comes from a noble attempt
to tell both the story of young
Vito's rise to power in the New
York Italian community of the
19205, and Michael's rise to power
over the whole of organized crime
in the late 1950s and 60s.
The two threads show
contrasting styles of involvement
by Vito and Michael, and
contrasting use of family loyalties.
Michael comes out very badly,
emerging as a cold-hearted,
ruthless bastard, obsessed with
power and eliminating his
enemies.
Tick Syndrome
Yes, Micahel is affected with
the Tricky Dick syndrome, but
after the end of Part I, where
Michael has openly lied to his
wife, do audiences need another
three plus hours to reinforce the
image of Michael as basically bad?
Michael just isn't as interesting
a character as Vito, his father,
because he's basically inhuman,
uncaring, unfeeling, a real cold
fish. Vito, both as a young man
and Godfather, had some human
qualities tenderness, honesty
with friends, the ability to forgive
small insults. Vito is also not
above doing his own dirty work,
i.e. killing, while Michael lets
Mafia "soldiers" do his bloody
business.
This criticism is not to fault
Pacino's performance in the role
of Michael. He brings such an
inhumane ruthlessness to the part
that the audience has no pity for
him as his family life collapses in a
shambles. Pacino's Michael at the
end is immensely powerful, but a
man crippled inside, which is, as
the song says, "one thing you
can't hide."
That makes him all the more

disgusting as he uses his father's
old friends, his brother and his
wife as mere pawns in a scheme to
make him top dog of the Mafia.
It's a powerful contrast
between Michael and young Vito,
but about as dramatic as water
dripping on a rock. You know the
water will wear through the rock,
but don't want to stand around
and wait for it.
The same thing applies to
Godfather, Part 11. The majestic
inevitability of its pace makes you
squirm, wondering why the movie
has to focus so incessantly on the
obvious contrast.
The minor characters do a fine
job, but are all overshadowed by
Pacino and DiNiro. John Cazle, as
Michael's brother, Fredo, and
well-known acting coach Lee
Strasberg, as aging gangster
Hyman Roth, are particularly
excellent.
The most sympathetic modern

day mobster is Frankie Pentangeli,
played by Micahel Gazzo.
Pentangeli has a great personal
loyalty and a sort of earthy
dignity that Michael takes
advantage of and discards when he
has no further use for it.
Strange Nostalgia
There's a strange kind of
nostalgia running through The
Godfather, Part 11, which is part
of the emphasis on the contrast in
life-styles and operating methods
between Vito and Michael. It's a
nostalgia for a more direct way of
doing things, a greater personal
involvement, a greater sense of
community with your fellow
workers.
The movie adopts, and rightly
so, an ambivalent attitude toward
the cause of the loss of these
attitudes from Vito's time. Could
Michael have been more open and
trusting had he grown up in Vito's
world? And could Vito have

retained his fierce loyalty to
family and friends in the Las
Vegas atmosphere of the late 50s
and early 60s?
It's an unsettling-restatement
of the old heredity vs.
environment argument, presented
one drip at a time like the old
Chinese water torture, and since
the protagonists of the contrasting
life styles never get to meet, the
audience misses the type of
interaction that took place
between Brando and Pacino in the
first film, interaction that
attempted to reconcile these
changes.
Which all has been a rather
long way of explaining why The
Godfather, Part II is a stimulating,
flawed and not quite satisfying
movie. Coppola should not be
faulted for not making a film the
equal of The Godfather , but
congratulated for coming so close.

director, with even more control
than he had over the first part.
This time Coppola is both
producer and director, as well as
co-authoring the screenplay.
Over Involvement
That's part of the problem,,
over-involvement. The second
problem is that even with a
last-minute re-editing job by
Coppola himself, the film is
choppier and more episodic than-
Part I, and at 3 hours and 15
minutes running time, about a
half hour too long.
The wide-ranging nature of the
film comes from a noble attempt
to tell both the story of young
Vito's rise to power in the New
York Italian community of the
19205, and Michael's rise to power
over the whole of organized crime
in the late 1950s and 60s.
The two threads show
contrasting styles of involvement
by Vito and Michael, and
contrasting use of family loyalties.
Michael comes out very badly,
emerging as a cold-hearted,
ruthless bastard, obsessed with
power and eliminating his
enemies.
Tick Syndrome
Yes, Micahel is affected with
the Tricky Dick syndrome, but
after the end of Part I, where
Michael has openly lied to his
wife, do audiences need another
three plus hours to reinforce the
image of Michael as basically bad?
Michael just isn't as interesting
a character as Vito, his father,
because he's basically inhuman,
uncaring, unfeeling, a real cold
fish. Vito, both as a young man
and Godfather, had some human
qualities tenderness, honesty
with friends, the ability to forgive
small insults. Vito is also not
above doing his own dirty work,
i.e. killing, while Michael lets
Mafia "soldiers" do his bloody
business.
This criticism is not to fault
Pacino's performance in the role
of Michael. He brings such an
inhumane ruthlessness to the part
that the audience has no pity for
him as his family life collapses in a
shambles. Pacino's Michael at the
end is immensely powerful, but a
man crippled inside, which is, as
the song says, "one thing you
can't hide."
That makes him all the more

disgusting as he uses his father's
old friends, his brother and his
wife as mere pawns in a scheme to
make him top dog of the Mafia.
It's a powerful contrast
between Michael and young Vito,
but about as dramatic as water
dripping on a rock. You know the
water will wear through the rock,
but don't want to stand around
and wait for it.
The same thing applies to
Godfather, Part 11. The majestic
inevitability of its pace makes you
squirm, wondering why the movie
has to focus so incessantly on the
obvious contrast.
The minor characters do a fine
job, but are all overshadowed by
Pacino and DiNiro. John Cazle, as
Michael's brother, Fredo, and
well-known acting coach Lee
Strasberg, as aging gangster
Hyman Roth, are particularly
excellent.
The most sympathetic modern

day mobster is Frankie Pentangeli,
played by Micahel Gazzo.
Pentangeli has a great personal
loyalty and a sort of earthy
dignity that Michael takes
advantage of and discards when he
has no further use for it.
Strange Nostalgia
There's a strange kind of
nostalgia running through The
Godfather, Part 11, which is part
of the emphasis on the contrast in
life-styles and operating methods
between Vito and Michael. It's a
nostalgia for a more direct way of
doing things, a greater personal
involvement, a greater sense of
community with your fellow
workers.
The movie adopts, and rightly
so, an ambivalent attitude toward
the cause of the loss of these
attitudes from Vito's time. Could
Michael have been more open and
trusting had he grown up in Vito's
world? And could Vito have

retained his fierce loyalty to
family and friends in the Las
Vegas atmosphere of the late 50s
and early 60s?
It's an unsettling-restatement
of the old heredity vs.
environment argument, presented
one drip at a time like the old
Chinese water torture, and since
the protagonists of the contrasting
life styles never get to meet, the
audience misses the type of
interaction that took place
between Brando and Pacino in the
first film, interaction that
attempted to reconcile these
changes.
Which all has been a rather
long way of explaining why The
Godfather, Part II is a stimulating,
flawed and not quite satisfying
movie. Coppola should not be
faulted for not making a film the
equal of The Godfather , but
congratulated for coming so close.

DON'T REFUSE THIS OFFER—Al Pacino (right), who has become
heir to the Godfather's power and domain, is angered by his brother
John Cazale, who he feels has betrayed him, in Francis Ford
Coppola's The Godfather, Part II.
How about a sequel to Gone
With the Wind without Clark
Gable? Or Sound of Music, Part
II without Julie Andrews? That's
part of what The Godfather, Part
II is up against, without one
glimpse of Marlon Brando, whose
portrayal of Vito Corleone won
the Academy Award for best
actor.
However, Brando's character
Vito is in Part H, along with A1
Pacino reprising his part as son
Michael. But, young Vito, growing
up in New York City from 1917
on is played by Robert DiNiro,
whose movie reputation to date
has been made by portraying
loveable louts of low IQ (the
catcher in Bang the Drum Slowly,
and a small-minded, small-time
hoodlum in Mean Streets).
DiNiro, though, excels as
young Vito, adopting many of the
mannerisms Brando brought to
the characterization, and making
them seem even more natural than
with Brando.
So what's really wrong with

Godfather, Part II then?
Everybody from Part I is back

after the end of Part I, where
Michael has openly lied to his
wife, do audiences need another
three plus hours to reinforce the
image of Michael as basically bad?
Michael just isn't as interesting
a character as Vito, his father,
because he's basically inhuman,
uncaring, unfeeling, a real cold
fish. Vito, both as a young man
and Godfather, had some human
qualities tenderness, honesty
with friends, the ability to forgive
small insults. Vito is also not
above doing his own dirty work,
i.e. killing, while Michael lets
Mafia "soldiers" do his bloody
business.
This criticism is not to fault
Pacino's performance in the role
of Michael. He brings such an
inhumane ruthlessness to the part
that the audience has no pity for
him as his family life collapses in a
shambles. Pacino's Michael at the
end is immensely powerful, but a
man crippled inside, which is, as
the song says, "one thing you
can't hide."
That makes him all the more

disgusting as he uses his father's
old friends, his brother and his
wife as mere pawns in a scheme to
make him top dog of the Mafia.
It's a powerful contrast
between Michael and young Vito,
but about as dramatic as water
dripping on a rock. You know the
water will wear through the rock,
but don't want to stand around
and wait for it.
The same thing applies to
Godfather, Part 11. The majestic
inevitability of its pace makes you
squirm, wondering why the movie
has to focus so incessantly on the
obvious contrast.
The minor characters do a fine
job, but are all overshadowed by
Pacino and DiNiro. John Cazle, as
Michael's brother, Fredo, and
well-known acting coach Lee
Strasberg, as aging gangster
Hyman Roth, are particularly
excellent.
The most sympathetic modern

day mobster is Frankie Pentangeli,
played by Micahel Gazzo.
Pentangeli has a great personal
loyalty and a sort of earthy
dignity that Michael takes
advantage of and discards when he
has no further use for it.
Strange Nostalgia
There's a strange kind of
nostalgia running through The
Godfather, Part 11, which is part
of the emphasis on the contrast in
life-styles and operating methods
between Vito and Michael. It's a
nostalgia for a more direct way of
doing things, a greater personal
involvement, a greater sense of
community with your fellow
workers.
The movie adopts, and rightly
so, an ambivalent attitude toward
the cause of the loss of these
attitudes from Vito's time. Could
Michael have been more open and
trusting had he grown up in Vito's
world? And could Vito have

retained his fierce loyalty to
family and friends in the Las
Vegas atmosphere of the late 50s
and early 60s?
It's an unsettling-restatement
of the old heredity vs.
environment argument, presented
one drip at a time like the old
Chinese water torture, and since
the protagonists of the contrasting
life styles never get to meet, the
audience misses the type of
interaction that took place
between Brando and Pacino in the
first film, interaction that
attempted to reconcile these
changes.
Which all has been a rather
long way of explaining why The
Godfather, Part II is a stimulating,
flawed and not quite satisfying
movie. Coppola should not be
faulted for not making a film the
equal of The Godfather , but
congratulated for coming so close.

DON'T REFUSE THIS OFFER—Al Pacino (right), who has become
heir to the Godfather's power and domain, is angered by his brother
John Cazale, who he feels has betrayed him, in Francis Ford
Coppola's The Godfather, Part II.
How about a sequel to Gone
With the Wind without Clark
Gable? Or Sound of Music, Part
II without Julie Andrews? That's
part of what The Godfather, Part
II is up against, without one
glimpse of Marlon Brando, whose
portrayal of Vito Corleone won
the Academy Award for best
actor.
However, Brando's character
Vito is in Part H, along with A1
Pacino reprising his part as son
Michael. But, young Vito, growing
up in New York City from 1917
on is played by Robert DiNiro,
whose movie reputation to date
has been made by portraying
loveable louts of low IQ (the
catcher in Bang the Drum Slowly,
and a small-minded, small-time
hoodlum in Mean Streets).
DiNiro, though, excels as
young Vito, adopting many of the
mannerisms Brando brought to
the characterization, and making
them seem even more natural than
with Brando.
So what's really wrong with

Godfather, Part II then?
Everybody from Part I is back
who wasn't killed off, and Francis
Ford Coppola is again the
director, with even more control
than he had over the first part.
This time Coppola is both
producer and director, as well as
co-authoring the screenplay.
Over Involvement
That's part of the problem,,
over-involvement. The second
problem is that even with a
last-minute re-editing job by
Coppola himself, the film is
choppier and more episodic than-
Part I, and at 3 hours and 15
minutes running time, about a
half hour too long.
The wide-ranging nature of the
film comes from a noble attempt
to tell both the story of young
Vito's rise to power in the New
York Italian community of the
19205, and Michael's rise to power
over the whole of organized crime
in the late 1950s and 60s.
The two threads show
contrasting styles of involvement
by Vito and Michael, and
contrasting use of family loyalties.
Michael comes out very badly,
emerging as a cold-hearted,
ruthless bastard, obsessed with
power and eliminating his
enemies.
