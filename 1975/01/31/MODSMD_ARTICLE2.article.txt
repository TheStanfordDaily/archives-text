# Frenchman's Terrace May Get HUD Funds
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed
225-unit housing complex for
Stanford employees, is likely to
receive funding this year from the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) after a long
conflict between University and HUD
officials, according to Robert
Moulton, director of the Midpeninsula
Urban Coalition.
"I received a call recently from
James Price [HUD's area director] and
it looks very much as though the issues
that were stalling plans for the project
are being resolved in Stanford's favor,"
Moulton said. "I expect to receive a
confirmation in writing very soon."
But Dirk Murphy, legal counsel to
HUD's regional office, denied that
approval of funding for the project is
imminent.
"We don't know yet whether or not
Frenchman's Terrace will be funded,"
Murphy said. "The main obstacles of
contention between the University and
HUD still remain."
Primarily, HUD objects to the
University's insistence on allocating 40
percent of the units to market-priced
housing, 40 percent to
moderate-priced housing and only 20
percent to low-income housing.
Murphy explained that HUD"
officials are wary of spending money
for a project that includes so many
market-priced units.
Section 236 of the National
Housing Act of 1965, under which
Frenchman's Terrace would receive
funding, was intended to support only
projects in which the large majority of
units were allocated to low income
units, Murphy noted.
Although Murphy told the Daily
last spring and again last autumn that
the University's pricing plan is
definitely legal, he claimed yesterday
that HUD attorneys are now
reconsidering the plan's legality.
Frenchman's Terrace would be
built on Stanford land within Palo
Alto city limits with HUD funds. The
Urban Coalition would manage the
project.
Murphy added that HUD must also
update its cost estimates for
Frenchman's Terrace in order to

determine the impact of the recent
inflation.
Moulton said that before Palo Alto
can annex the land on which the
project would be built, the Local
Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) must approve the
annexation.
The approval is a mere formality,
Moulton said, and the University has
petitioned LAFCO to place the matter
on its March agenda.
LAFCO approved the project
several years ago, but the approval
expired after 12 months, Moulton
said. Referral of the matter to LAFCO
by the University is an expression of
optimism that the program is on the
verge of HUD funding.

units, Murphy noted.
Although Murphy told the Daily
last spring and again last autumn that
the University's pricing plan is
definitely legal, he claimed yesterday
that HUD attorneys are now
reconsidering the plan's legality.
Frenchman's Terrace would be
built on Stanford land within Palo
Alto city limits with HUD funds. The
Urban Coalition would manage the
project.
Murphy added that HUD must also
update its cost estimates for
Frenchman's Terrace in order to

determine the impact of the recent
inflation.
Moulton said that before Palo Alto
can annex the land on which the
project would be built, the Local
Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) must approve the
annexation.
The approval is a mere formality,
Moulton said, and the University has
petitioned LAFCO to place the matter
on its March agenda.
LAFCO approved the project
several years ago, but the approval
expired after 12 months, Moulton
said. Referral of the matter to LAFCO
by the University is an expression of
optimism that the program is on the
verge of HUD funding.
Frenchman's Terrace, a proposed
225-unit housing complex for
Stanford employees, is likely to
receive funding this year from the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) after a long
conflict between University and HUD
officials, according to Robert
Moulton, director of the Midpeninsula
Urban Coalition.
"I received a call recently from
James Price [HUD's area director] and
it looks very much as though the issues
that were stalling plans for the project
are being resolved in Stanford's favor,"
Moulton said. "I expect to receive a
confirmation in writing very soon."
But Dirk Murphy, legal counsel to
HUD's regional office, denied that
approval of funding for the project is
imminent.
"We don't know yet whether or not
Frenchman's Terrace will be funded,"
Murphy said. "The main obstacles of
contention between the University and
HUD still remain."
Primarily, HUD objects to the
University's insistence on allocating 40
percent of the units to market-priced
housing, 40 percent to
moderate-priced housing and only 20
percent to low-income housing.
Murphy explained that HUD"
officials are wary of spending money
for a project that includes so many
market-priced units.
Section 236 of the National
Housing Act of 1965, under which
Frenchman's Terrace would receive
funding, was intended to support only
projects in which the large majority of
units were allocated to low income
units, Murphy noted.
Although Murphy told the Daily
last spring and again last autumn that
the University's pricing plan is
definitely legal, he claimed yesterday
that HUD attorneys are now
reconsidering the plan's legality.
