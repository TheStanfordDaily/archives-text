# Lamb Lies Down At Berkeley
## 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
BERKELEYâ€”A black-robed figure with
grotesque claws appeared behind a lit violet
backdrop and screamed "Welcome to the
wonderful world of Genesis!"
White smoke hissed and curled from the stage as
lead singer Peter Gabriel begain spinning the tale of
Genesis' rock opera, The Lamb Lies Down on
Broadway, performed at the Berkeley Community
Theater last week.
Three screens flashed images of faces dripping
blood, Salvador Dali paintings, the Klu Klux Klan
and lambs lying on the New York skyline. The
quiet strains of Tony Banks' organ built to a
pulsating crescendo, introducing the title song.
Double-necked Whine
The tale was punctuated by a double-necked
bass/acoustic guitar's steadily rising whine and
Gabriel's pleading, boyish voice. Nobody could
grabe the spotlight from Banks, a musician capable
of any sound, any pace, or any style.
High-pitched wails combined with the slow grind
of heavy Gothic church-like material, wah-wah
effects and rippling melodies comprise one of the
most uncliched keyboard performances every
heard.
The often-overbearing continuity of the rock
opera was broken by drummer Bill Collins, who led
the group in and out of songs and instrumental
interludes with unexpected yet tight rhythm
changes, especially during "Counting Out Time"
and "Chamber of Thirty-Two Doors."
Flittering Pan
Gabriel flitted about the stage like Peter Pan,
hurling fiery, ear-shattering explosives and driving
the crowd wild with excitement. During "Cuckoo

Coccoon" he sang and played flute crouched
fetus-like in a corner of the stage, and at other
times he engaged in some bizarre modern dance
movements.
What's the arcane symbolism underlying all of
this dramatized stage hoopla? Here goes: the theme
of the opera concerns a character named Rael who
haunts the subways of the New York, gets lost and
discovers 32 doors, only one of which leads
out. He finds the sunlit passage to freedom, only to
have it collapse on his head.
Death passes Rael by this time, but some nasty
demon castrates him; a raven picks up the goodies
and drops them in a river. Our Hero pursues the
raven, sees his dead brother in the water, and jumps
in.
Lackey Makes Stuffy
Gabriel enacted some weird stunts to dramatize
Rael's escapades. A gauzy paisley cone, whirling
madly, was suspended from the ceiling with Gabriel
singing away from inside it. All of this appeared
through a dense, stuffy cloud of smoke because
some backstage lackey forgot about the ventilator
switch.
And let us not forget the clincher: an inflated
red plastic tube was placed on stage, and guess who
crawled out of a slit at the top? Gabriel, sporting a
bulging cretin-like contraption encrusted with gold
sytrofoam balls on his head and upper body, and
still singing. The climax: a huge golden balloon
phallus, with My God, it is happening inflatable
testicles!
Sigmund Freud, here is your field day. But does
the weighty cosmic significance of such events
merit a standing ovation? The crowd seemed to
think so.
