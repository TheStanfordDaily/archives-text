# Pianist Highlights Concert
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Pianist Christoph Eschenbach
drew cheers and a standing
ovation for his stunning
performance of Beethoven's Piano
Concerto No. 5 in E Flat Major,
Opus 73 ("Emperor") with the
San Francisco Symphony.
Internationally known,
German-born Eschenbach has won
numerous awards and has played
all over the world with leading
orchestras.
His performance was nearly
flawless; a few minor rhythmical
problems between soloist and
orchestra were the only faults.
Scale and cadenza passages were
perfectly articulated, and his
dynamic contrasts were very
effective. His style is assertive and

"percussive." Few pianists resort
to such key-banging and extreme,
sweeping arm movements.
Conductor Seiji Ozawa
deserves equal credit for the
successful performance of the
Concerto. He is a great conductor
because he puts new meaning and
interpretation into old, standard
works. With the Orchestra he
stressed dynamic contrasts in the
Allegro that are not often so
extreme. He took the Adagio very
slowly and expressively to
emphasize, its melodic beauty.
And the famous transition from
the Adagio to the Rondo held a
quiet, heavy suspense.
The work, premiered in Leipzig
in 1810, is Beethoven's last piano
concerto, composed in the middle

of his productive years. It is
considered one of the best ever
written, and is a "standard" for
pianists.
The performance of Mozart's
Symphony No. 39 in E Flat
Major, K. 543, was also impressive.
Composed in 1788, it is one of
Mozart's three final masterpieces,
the three being composed within
the short period of two months.
Again, uneven rhythm at the
beginning was the only fault. The
piece continued with a smooth,
flawless sound, particularly in thp
second movement. The Trio in the
Menuetto between the flutes and
clarinets had a lighthearted
delicacy that is difficult to
express; no less noteworthy wert
the rest of the winds with
similarly difficult parts.
