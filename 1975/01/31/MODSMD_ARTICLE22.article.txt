## Two Unpredictable Teams Cards-Cal: A Weird One 
### DAN PYNE 
It's been a pretty weird week
in a pretty weird season.
First the Cardinals run over a
bunch of well-disciplined dwarfs,
then they lose to a bunch of
undisciplined Texans, and now
they're going to play Cal.
The Cards are 3-1 in the
conference, and 9-7 overall.
The Bears are 1-3 in the
conference, and 11-5 overall.
Stanford's one loss was to
Oregon. Cal's one win was over
Oregon. But while Stanford was
beating UCLA, Cal was losing to
USC, and while Stanford was
edging USC, Cal was getting
trounced by UCLA. The Cards
also beat league-leading Oregon
State, and the Bears lost to
Oregon State.
Which leads one to the
conclusion that Stanford will beat
Cal tomorrow. Or does it?
Can Beat Anyone
Card coach Howie Dallmar,
shooting for a fourth consecutive
conference win, is cautious. "Cal
is capable of beating anyone," he
said. "They've proven that with
victories over Purdue, Arizona
and Oregon."
The Bears are led by two very
quick guards, Rickie Hawthorne
(6-3) and Connie White (6-4).

Hawthorne tops the list of Cal
scorers with a 15-point average. A
second-team All-League selection
last year, Hawthorne anchors and
directs the Bears' offense.
White is a junior college
transfer, and has more moves than
a can of worms (so to speak). At
Mercer Community College in
New Jersey last year he was
national JC Player of the Year,
and averaged 20 points a game.
His average is 13.8 this season.
On the front line, Rich Kelley
holds a clear advantage over Cal's
6-9 center, Jay Young, and that
could hurt the Bears. Young is
averaging 11.8 points per game
this year, and was White's
teammate at Mercer last year.
Kelley Backup
The Bears have 6-11 Mark
Dickey, another JC transfer, to
back up Young, but Dickey has
not been used much this year.
Dickey was Kelley's backup at
Woodside High School.
At forwards Cal will run 6-8
Carl Bird and 6-5 John Terry or
6-7 Doug Vilotti. Bird has a 12
point average, Terry a 5.1 average
and Young has been scoring 11.8
points per game.
Cal coach Dick Edwards, in his
third season at Berkeley, believes
that his front line is very solid this

year. Scott Trobbe, who scored
20 points against Houston, and Ed
Schweitzer, who is shooting at a
remarkable .755 Pac-8 clip (40
of 53 field goal attempts), will put
them to the test (as we say).
"Cal has a lot of guys who can
hurt you," Dallmar said, "and
their quickness can really be a
problem. The three JC players
Young, White and Bird keep
getting better and better."
Possible Outcomes
If the Cards play the way they
have been playing in conference,
they'll kill Cal. If, however, they
play the way they've been playing
in non-conference games, people'
in Berkeley will be pretty happy
this weekend.
But, to cap a weird week in a
weird season, they'll probably
win.
As for that last game, a 74-66
loss to Houston, well, at least it's
over. In a mild understatement,
Dallmar explained, "We lost the
ball too many times and didn't
take good shots in many
instances. We just didn't play very
well."
In that game, Rich Kelley's
free throw streak of 27 straight
was snapped when he missed his
first at'tempt. Kelley then started
a new streak of three straight.

Young, White and Bird keep

Possible Outcomes
If the Cards play the way they
have been playing in conference,
they'll kill Cal. If, however, they
play the way they've been playing
in non-conference games, people'
in Berkeley will be pretty happy
this weekend.
But, to cap a weird week in a
weird season, they'll probably
win.
As for that last game, a 74-66
loss to Houston, well, at least it's
over. In a mild understatement,
Dallmar explained, "We lost the
ball too many times and didn't
take good shots in many
instances. We just didn't play very
well."
In that game, Rich Kelley's
free throw streak of 27 straight
was snapped when he missed his
first at'tempt. Kelley then started
a new streak of three straight.

NOT YOUR ORDINARY STAR During his career as star of
Stanford's wrestling team, Chris Horpel has done more than just
wrestle and drink beer. Horpel has been largely responsible for the
promotion and growth of the sport at Stanford.
It's been a pretty weird week
in a pretty weird season.
First the Cardinals run over a
bunch of well-disciplined dwarfs,
then they lose to a bunch of
undisciplined Texans, and now
they're going to play Cal.
The Cards are 3-1 in the
conference, and 9-7 overall.
The Bears are 1-3 in the
conference, and 11-5 overall.
Stanford's one loss was to
Oregon. Cal's one win was over
Oregon. But while Stanford was
beating UCLA, Cal was losing to
USC, and while Stanford was
edging USC, Cal was getting
trounced by UCLA. The Cards
also beat league-leading Oregon
State, and the Bears lost to
Oregon State.
Which leads one to the
conclusion that Stanford will beat
Cal tomorrow. Or does it?
Can Beat Anyone
Card coach Howie Dallmar,
shooting for a fourth consecutive
conference win, is cautious. "Cal
is capable of beating anyone," he
said. "They've proven that with
victories over Purdue, Arizona
and Oregon."
The Bears are led by two very
quick guards, Rickie Hawthorne
(6-3) and Connie White (6-4).

Hawthorne tops the list of Cal
scorers with a 15-point average. A
second-team All-League selection
last year, Hawthorne anchors and
directs the Bears' offense.
White is a junior college
transfer, and has more moves than
a can of worms (so to speak). At
Mercer Community College in
New Jersey last year he was
national JC Player of the Year,
and averaged 20 points a game.
His average is 13.8 this season.
On the front line, Rich Kelley
holds a clear advantage over Cal's
6-9 center, Jay Young, and that
could hurt the Bears. Young is
averaging 11.8 points per game
this year, and was White's
teammate at Mercer last year.
Kelley Backup
The Bears have 6-11 Mark
Dickey, another JC transfer, to
back up Young, but Dickey has
not been used much this year.
Dickey was Kelley's backup at
Woodside High School.
At forwards Cal will run 6-8
Carl Bird and 6-5 John Terry or
6-7 Doug Vilotti. Bird has a 12
point average, Terry a 5.1 average
and Young has been scoring 11.8
points per game.
Cal coach Dick Edwards, in his
third season at Berkeley, believes
that his front line is very solid this

year. Scott Trobbe, who scored
20 points against Houston, and Ed
Schweitzer, who is shooting at a
remarkable .755 Pac-8 clip (40
of 53 field goal attempts), will put
them to the test (as we say).
"Cal has a lot of guys who can
hurt you," Dallmar said, "and
their quickness can really be a
problem. The three JC players
Young, White and Bird keep
getting better and better."
