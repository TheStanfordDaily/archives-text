# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
► Our fearful forecaster is
\ coming off a 7-1 week (it would
\have been perfect, but Oregon
► State lucked out over Oregon).
► Which brings us to the question
j of season percentages.
* People have been coming up
* to us (after picking such games
as Stanford-UCLA and Notre
Dame-UCLA) and asking, "isn't
your percentage dose to 1000?"
Well, actually, uh, we're only
17-7 ( 708), way be/ow our
football record.
This is natural rival week,
and the games are hard to pick
because of the influence of
screaming fans. Those fans will
be the difference in the
UCLA-USC game. Even though
we think the Trojans are
basically about five points
better than the Bruins, UCLA's
famed 10-point Pauley Pavilion

advantage should overcome.
Cat doesn't have that much
of a home court advantage,
though, so our Killer Kards (in
league games only) ought to
prevail. We hope lots of
Stanford fans come up to
Berkeley; it's pretty hard to
make noise when watching on
TV.
Elsewhere, we predict
Oregon to avenge last week's
defeat to OSU in a non-league
money-raising' special at
Portland, and pick Washington,
a league-game choker, to finally
display its talents at Washington
State.
Predictions
Stanford 73, Cat 68
UCLA 80, USC 75
Oregon 64, Oregon St. 61
Oregon 74, Hawaii 55
Washington 74, WSU 73
