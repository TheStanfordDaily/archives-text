# Women Cagers Win Opener
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
"The game wasn't exactly
according to plan," said Stanford
women's basketball coach Gay
Coburn. First games never are.
But the Cards scrambled from
behind in the second half to win
their season opener 56-53 over
Santa Clara Wednesday night.
In spite of an amazing 94
turnovers, 56 of them by
Stanford, the overflow crowd of
125 in Roble Gym was treated to
an exciting contest. The lead
changed hands 15 times. Neither
team ever led by more than seven
points.
Team play was the key for the
Cards. Stanford's starters scored
29 points while the five players on
the bench poured in 27. Nine of
the 10 players on the team scored.
Kelly Thompson and Sukie
Jackson led with 12 points each.
The Broncos were forced to

rely on two players for most of
their scoring. Twenty-two of their
26 second-half points were scored
by Linda Bernatz and Roy
Graham, who finished with 19
and 16 tallies respectively.
Aggressive defense helped
make up for Stanford's offensive
miscues. To avoid foul trouble in
the second half, the Cards used a
2-3 zone to force the shorter
Broncos to shoot from outside.
The strategy worked as Santa
Clara, after going 9 for 11 at the
foul line in the opening period,
attempted no free throws at all in
the last 20 minutes. Only the
incredible outside accuracy of
Bematz and Graham kept the
game from turning into a rout.
The Cards' junior varsity took
a 20-19 lead into the second half
and ran the Santa Clara JV's into
the ground, winning 49-31. Good
zone defense and rebounding

made the difference. Anne Watson
pulled down 13 missed shots, and
Leslie Stovall was close behind
with 12.
Stovall also led all JV scorers
with 15 points as Stanford used
an effective fast-break and good
penetration to pull away.
Both the varsity and the JV's
will return to action at Berkeley
next Wednesday night. The team
needs work in several areas,
especially free throws. The varsity
was an abysmal 6 for 14 from the
charity stripe, and missed all four
attempts in the last two minutes
when the game was in the balance.

26 second-half points were scored
by Linda Bernatz and Roy
Graham, who finished with 19
and 16 tallies respectively.
Aggressive defense helped
make up for Stanford's offensive
miscues. To avoid foul trouble in
the second half, the Cards used a
2-3 zone to force the shorter
Broncos to shoot from outside.
The strategy worked as Santa
Clara, after going 9 for 11 at the
foul line in the opening period,
attempted no free throws at all in
the last 20 minutes. Only the
incredible outside accuracy of
Bematz and Graham kept the
game from turning into a rout.
The Cards' junior varsity took
a 20-19 lead into the second half
and ran the Santa Clara JV's into
the ground, winning 49-31. Good
zone defense and rebounding

made the difference. Anne Watson
pulled down 13 missed shots, and
Leslie Stovall was close behind
with 12.
Stovall also led all JV scorers
with 15 points as Stanford used
an effective fast-break and good
penetration to pull away.
Both the varsity and the JV's
will return to action at Berkeley
next Wednesday night. The team
needs work in several areas,
especially free throws. The varsity
was an abysmal 6 for 14 from the
charity stripe, and missed all four
attempts in the last two minutes
when the game was in the balance.

"The game wasn't exactly
according to plan," said Stanford
women's basketball coach Gay
Coburn. First games never are.
But the Cards scrambled from
behind in the second half to win
their season opener 56-53 over
Santa Clara Wednesday night.
In spite of an amazing 94
turnovers, 56 of them by
Stanford, the overflow crowd of
125 in Roble Gym was treated to
an exciting contest. The lead
changed hands 15 times. Neither
team ever led by more than seven
points.
Team play was the key for the
Cards. Stanford's starters scored
29 points while the five players on
the bench poured in 27. Nine of
the 10 players on the team scored.
Kelly Thompson and Sukie
Jackson led with 12 points each.
The Broncos were forced to

rely on two players for most of
their scoring. Twenty-two of their
26 second-half points were scored
by Linda Bernatz and Roy
Graham, who finished with 19
and 16 tallies respectively.
