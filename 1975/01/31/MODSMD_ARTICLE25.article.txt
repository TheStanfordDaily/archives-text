# Energetic Horpel The Guiding Spirit
## 
### MARK FUNK 
It's been a rather uncertain
year for Stanford wrestler Chris
Horpel.
"I don't know what's going to
hit me next," the 150-pound
Ail-American said with a mock
laugh. "The three things I'm most
involved with here wrestling,
my fraternity and the art and
architecture department are all
in danger of being dropped."
Stories like that make strong
men cry.
"Fortunately, it looks like I
will be able to graduate with all
three of those functions still
available to me," Horpel said.
Just on the strength of the
circumstances described above, it
is apparent that Horpel is not
your everyday, run-of-the-mill,
garden variety All-American.
Guiding Spirit
He isn't. In fact, he is the
guiding spirit of one of the
stranger intercollegiate athletic
teams in the country. Horpel's on
scholarship, but it shouldn't
surprise anyone if they found him
out with a gaggle of fellow
grapplers sweeping refuse from
Stanford Stadium.
They do it because the
wrestling program needs the
money. Shoestrings to tie it on
don't come so cheap anymore.
"We try to make up for lack of
funds and general non-support by
doing some projects ourselves,"
Horpel pointed out. And few
All-Americans from other
institutions could have painted
the murals that adorn the walls of
Encina Gym.
Horpel did those in his spare
time and he has little of it. His
three overriding interests
monopolize his working hours.

"Hyperactivity has perverted me,"
he laughed.
So he is a valuable asset to the
club. He also provides an *
interesting counter-balance to his
head coach, Joe DeMeo. DeMeo, s>
who looks a little like a cross
between Santa Claus and Prof. >
Harold Hill, is a divergent
personality himself. And he heaps s
praise on his All-American.
"Chris is just a great person,"A ,
DeMeo volunteered without much
hesitation and began to list some
of his achievements. "Let's see, he
now has the school record for
pins, the record for most career
wins and I think he might even be
closing in on some national
records."
That's amazing. Some of those
national marks are the exclusive
property of the legendary Dan
Gable of lowa State. But Chris is
certainly nearing the pin mark,
Apparently, all that concerns
Horpel little. "I really never go
out and set goals," he said. "Oh
maybe one. I try not to get
injured."
Strange Ailments
It may be the only one Horpel,
will never reach. As he sat
nervously fingering a black eye he .
had picked up in a tournament
Saturday, Horpel said he would be
fine just as soon as he recovered
completely from a slightly,
strained ankle and a bad case of
are you ready for this? poison
oak.
Last year he sat out the entire
season with a knee injury.
But this season he's back if
not with a vengence at least
with a good shot at the Pacific
Eight title later in February.
