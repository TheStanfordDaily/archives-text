# IM Roundup
## Gavilan Tradition Continues 
### PETE BHATIA 
I may get called a dormist for
this column (as compared to a
sexist),but this week IM Roundup
turns back to some old friends
I refer to Gavilan '72, the
hapless bunch of basketball
fanatics, which last year went 0-5
losing by an average score of
90-10. These fine bunch of
normal Stanford students led by
their coach and mentor Dean "the
dream" Hashimoto opened their
season two weeks ago.
The result was a smashing
104-19 victory â€” for Biz II B-3.
The Bizzers had little trouble
controlling the awesome Gavilan

offense, holding Gavilan's high
scoring geek, Mark "Jabbar"
Siddoway, to a mere seven points.
Meanwhile, Biz H rugby fugitive
La wry Lieberman scored 34
points.
Last week, Gavilan '72 fared
much better but fell under a
devastating fourth quarter
Bohansens' hot streak by a 92-12
margin. An upset by any
standard.
In other basketball news,
Sigma Chi's number two B team
pulled the first big upset of the
campaign by trouncing last year's
B champion, Sixth Ward, 54-34. \
In soccer news, a
Spanish-speaking team of
Engineers, named the Engineers,
established themselves as one of
the A league's top teams last
Friday with a convincing 4-1 win
over the well-regarded Theta
Delts.
