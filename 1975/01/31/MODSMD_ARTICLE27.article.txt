# Seniors Lead Card Golf Team
## 
### 
Stanford's fabulous freshmen
of 1972 are now seasoned seniors,
and golf coach Bud Finger hopes
the Cards can translate experience
into national prominence in 1975.
} For three years Stanford has
been a powerhouse in West Coast
tournaments and a flop at the
nationals. Last year's performance
epitomized the frustrations of the
past three seasons: Stanford won
the Pac-8 tournament by 24 shots,
but missed the cut at the NCAA's
*and finished a disappointing 16th.
Today marks the start of a new
season, and the Cardinals are
approaching it the same way all
Stanford teams approach their
season openers with cautious
optimism. "We should be a great
* team," said senior Dave Baskins,
preferring to leave it at that
instead of beginning a second
I clause with the inevitable "if..."
Baskins and fellow seniors Aly
Trompas, Conrad Nilmeier and
George Pettinger lead the Cards
gginto today's 18-hold Stanford
Kick-off Tourney. Nine Bay Area
teams, including the Cardinal
varsity and JV, will test the
Stanford course beginning at 10
a.m.
Baskins, last year's U.S.
Collegiate Invitational champion
and a third-team All-American,
will play in the No. 1 position
today. Trompas, last year's Pac-8
runnerup, will play No. 2,
followed by 1973 U.S. Collegiate
Invitational champ Nilmeier at
No. 3. Pettinger, last year's
third-place finisher in the Pac-B's,
is the No. 4 man.
Junior Tom Mason and
freshman Mike Peck round out
the Cardinal lineup.
