# For Hencken, Pool Is Only Spotlight

### BOB KUSTEL 
Before every swim meet,
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
sits down and, after rummaging
through an assortment of
times, splits and meet results,
tries to estimate exactly what
each of his swimmers will have
to do in order to win the meet.
Gaughran, however, seldom
ponders the 200-yard
breastroke slot, for he enjoys
the luxury of a "sure win" in
the person of John Hencken.
The exploits of the junior
breastroker are well known. A
Gold-Medalist at the 1972
Olympics, Hencken is also the
reigning NCAA champion in
the 200 breastroke.
Despite all of his
accomplishments, Hencken
often remains out of the
spotlight.
First of all, Hencken labors
on a team full of stars.
Furthermore, Hencken
seems to shun attention. "I
really don't make an effort to
get noticed," he says.

He is also so amazingly
consistent that his numerous
wins tend to be regarded as
[ "routine," according to one
: swimmer.
One may wonder what more
there is to accomplish, but
Hencken seems not to worry
about it. "I'll just keep trying
to better my times," he says,
noting that "right now I'm
doing a little better than last
year at this time."
Hencken, who grew up in
Santa Clara, naturally has his
eyes set on the 1976 Olympics.
"I'll keep swimming at least
until then, and after that, I'm
not sure."
Well-liked by his teammates,
Hencken, a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, is still not sure
about his plans for the future,
although he "definitely won't
coach." An electrical
engineering major at present,
he expects to add another field
to his major, though right now
he's not sure which one.
