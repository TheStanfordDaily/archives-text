# SCIRE May Continue, 'Informed Sources' Say
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
History Prof. Gordon Craig,
chairman of the Faculty Senate, said
yesterday "informed sources" had told
him that Provost William F. Miller will
announce next week that the SCIRE
program will not be discontinued in
June.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs has recommended to
Miller that SCIRE be eliminated and
that its functions be distributed among
various academic departments. The
proposed action was only part of
Gibbs' plan to phase out other
student-instituted programs such as
SWOPSI and the Undergraduate
Writing Program as an economy move.
Stressing that his information was
from unofficial sources, Craig indicated
that Miller is expected to make his
announcement at next Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
"The word that I have at the
present time is that much of this
student agitation" is a bit
presumptuous, stated Craig. "The
recommendation only has been under
advisement by the provost."
Craig said his sources indicated that
any decision made about SCIRE
would be made on the basis of an
investigation conducted next academic
year.
Miller, however, maintained that
the situation is still under advisement
and that a decision will be
forthcoming in the next 10 days to
two weeks.

"The situation is undecided," he
stated. "I am looking at the
recommendation and I've got to come
to a conclusion in the next couple of
weeks. I would guess that somewhere

in the next 10 days I will be in a better
situation to say."
Miller noted that he currently is
examining Gibbs' overall proposal and
will be investigating particular
questions . of controversy in ' the
upcoming days.
When contacted by the Daily last
night, Gibbs said he had not heard of
any decision on his recent
recommendations. However, he
speculated that University officials
may be considering a variation of his
original proposal.

In his, memorandum to Miller,
Gibbs offered the alternative that
"SCIRE could continue next year by
being half of a position in my office. I
tried to balance making some budget
cuts against keeping the program," he

said.
In other action regarding the
proposed program cuts, the Save
SWOPSI Committee met yesterday
afternoon in the Women's Clubhouse
to discuss plans for enlisting student
and faculty support for SWOPSI.
The Committee presently is
collecting signatures at its booth in
White Plaza, and plans to distribute
petitions to individual dormitories
within the next two weeks. So far,
about 1200 people have signed the
petitions.
One committee member suggested
that the rally could be held to mourn
"the end of learning as undergraduates
at Stanford. We undergraduates are
now the funding units for graduate
education," he stated.

EATS It's time for lunch at the Children's Center of the Stanford Community (CCSC), a cooperative facility run by and
for University-affiliated families. The ASSU Council of Presidents will hold a town hall-type meeting Tuesday night to
discuss University child care services.
History Prof. Gordon Craig,
chairman of the Faculty Senate, said
yesterday "informed sources" had told
him that Provost William F. Miller will
announce next week that the SCIRE
program will not be discontinued in
June.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs has recommended to
Miller that SCIRE be eliminated and
that its functions be distributed among
various academic departments. The
proposed action was only part of
Gibbs' plan to phase out other
student-instituted programs such as
SWOPSI and the Undergraduate
Writing Program as an economy move.
Stressing that his information was
from unofficial sources, Craig indicated
that Miller is expected to make his
announcement at next Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
"The word that I have at the
present time is that much of this
student agitation" is a bit
presumptuous, stated Craig. "The
recommendation only has been under
advisement by the provost."
Craig said his sources indicated that
any decision made about SCIRE
would be made on the basis of an
investigation conducted next academic
year.
Miller, however, maintained that
the situation is still under advisement
and that a decision will be
forthcoming in the next 10 days to
two weeks.

"The situation is undecided," he
stated. "I am looking at the
recommendation and I've got to come
to a conclusion in the next couple of
weeks. I would guess that somewhere

in the next 10 days I will be in a better
situation to say."
Miller noted that he currently is
examining Gibbs' overall proposal and
will be investigating particular
questions . of controversy in ' the
upcoming days.
When contacted by the Daily last
night, Gibbs said he had not heard of
any decision on his recent
recommendations. However, he
speculated that University officials
may be considering a variation of his
original proposal.

In his, memorandum to Miller,
Gibbs offered the alternative that
"SCIRE could continue next year by
being half of a position in my office. I
tried to balance making some budget
cuts against keeping the program," he

said.
In other action regarding the
proposed program cuts, the Save
SWOPSI Committee met yesterday
afternoon in the Women's Clubhouse
to discuss plans for enlisting student
and faculty support for SWOPSI.
The Committee presently is
collecting signatures at its booth in
White Plaza, and plans to distribute
petitions to individual dormitories
within the next two weeks. So far,
about 1200 people have signed the
petitions.
One committee member suggested
that the rally could be held to mourn
"the end of learning as undergraduates
at Stanford. We undergraduates are
now the funding units for graduate
education," he stated.
