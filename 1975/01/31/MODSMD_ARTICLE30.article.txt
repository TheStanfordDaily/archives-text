JV's Win Fourth Straight
SAN JOSE Realizing just in
time that they were making a
strategic error, Stanford's junior
varsity basketballers won their
fourth consecutive game last night
against Santa Clara, 64-62, at San
Jose Civic Auditorium. The game
was a near rehash of Stanford's
two-point victory over the
Broncos 10 days ago at Maples
Pavilion.
Down 60-54 with seven
minutes remaining, Stanford
junked its zone press defense,
which had been about as air-tight
as a sponge, and replaced it with
an effective man-to-man press. As
a result, Santa Clara scored only
once the remainder of the game.
Meanwhile, Jim Erickson hit

on a 15-foot bank shot with 1:46
left to give the Cards a 61-60 lead.
A steal and subsequent layup by
Rodney McAuley was followed by
another steal by Terry McCartin,
and Stanford had its fifth win
against three losses.
Assistant coach Ken Morgan,
subbing for Percy Carr, who's
recruiting back East, criticized his
own defense and praised his
opponent's.
STANFORD (64) Session 17,
McCartin 8, Christopher 7, Dohrman 7,
Walker 6, Russell 4, Fitzner 4, Marion
4, Hill 2, Erickson 2, McAuley 3.
Total: FG: 28, FT: 8-16.
SANTA CLARA (62) Shakley 23,
Hartman 13, Barich 12, Hollands 6,
Perry 4, Rockwell 4.
Total: FG: 26, FT: 10-14.

which had been about as air-tight
as a sponge, and replaced it with
an effective man-to-man press. As
a result, Santa Clara scored only
once the remainder of the game.
Meanwhile, Jim Erickson hit

on a 15-foot bank shot with 1:46
left to give the Cards a 61-60 lead.
A steal and subsequent layup by
Rodney McAuley was followed by
another steal by Terry McCartin,
and Stanford had its fifth win
against three losses.
Assistant coach Ken Morgan,
subbing for Percy Carr, who's
recruiting back East, criticized his
own defense and praised his
opponent's.

A Dumb Press Release
Viae Kershner, retiring as Daily
sports editor, wishes to thank the
many persons who made his term
of office a most rewarding one,
especially Chris Baker, Alex
Hulanicki and Dave Robinson,
without whose help, he would
have collapsed of exhaustion.
JV's Win Fourth Straight
SAN JOSE Realizing just in
time that they were making a
strategic error, Stanford's junior
varsity basketballers won their
fourth consecutive game last night
against Santa Clara, 64-62, at San
Jose Civic Auditorium. The game
was a near rehash of Stanford's
two-point victory over the
Broncos 10 days ago at Maples
Pavilion.
Down 60-54 with seven
minutes remaining, Stanford
junked its zone press defense,
which had been about as air-tight
as a sponge, and replaced it with
an effective man-to-man press. As
a result, Santa Clara scored only
once the remainder of the game.
Meanwhile, Jim Erickson hit

on a 15-foot bank shot with 1:46
