Arms Negotiators To Begin Talks
WASHINGTON American and Soviet negotiators meet
today in Geneva to begin work on details of the broad arms
limitation understandings reached last year between
President Ford and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
They will bargain, part of the time, in an 8-st'ory house
built by financier Bernard Comfeld, who went bankrupt
before it was completed. The U.S. government now leases
the house.
An optimistic view is that the final draft of the pact
could be ready by May. The negotiators will take turns as
hosts for the meetings one day in the Soviet embassy, the
next in the former Cornfeld residence. *
The understanding reached between the two leaders at
Vladivostok limits the superpowers to 2400 long range
bombers and missiles each, with multiple warheads
permitted on 1320 of those.
Experts believe the basic number will remain unchanged
in the new round of talks, but that a great number of other
questions remain to be clarified. They hope to have the
final agreement ready for signature when Brezhnev visits
Washington next summer.
Ford Extends Clemency Program
WASHINGTON President Ford extended his clemency
program for one month, until March 1, because of
heightened interest, the White House announced yesterday.
The program, in the absence of any presidential action,
would have died Friday midnight.
The White House noted that only about 7400 of an
estimated 137,000 eligible men so far have decided to
participate in the program announced last September.
About 3000 men signed up for the program after the
major publicity campaign was launched.
Charles E. Goodell, chairman of the President's
Clemency Board, had asked for a six month extension.
Burns Urges Bigger Budget Cuts
WASHINGTON - Chairman Arthur F. Burns of the
Federal Reserve Board urged Congress yesterday to cut
federal spending below what President ford has
recommended, and said the defense budget shouldn't be
spared.
"When it comes to cutting expenditures, there are
opportunities everywhere, in every agency, including the
Defense Department," Burns said.
Burns said the Federal Reserve Board will permit a
moderate increase in money and credit to help finance
heavy government deficit spending this year and next, but
would not fuel inflation with unlimited amounts of new
money.
Bums indicated disagreement with several features of the
President's economic program, but he urged speedy action
on a temporary tax cut to stimulate the economy.

Lawyer Denies Eastland Pay-Off
WASHINGTON An allegation that Sen. James O.
Eastland took a $50,000 pay-off was denied on Thursday
by a lawyer for the man who is supposed to have made the
accusation.
Texas lawyer Scott Odom said that his client, John W.
Curington, did not make a statement attributed to him, and
knows nothing of a pay-off.
Another lawyer, Jerry Patchen, had testified that
Curington told him wealthy Dallas oilman Nelson Bunker
Hunt paid Eastland (D-Miss.) $50,000 or $60,000 to ward
off a federal indictment on a charge of industrial
wiretapping.
The pay-off charge was raised publicly on Monday in a
column by Jack Anderson and Les Whitten. They printed
Patchen's account, along with denials from Hunt and
Eastland, but did not quote Curington directly.
Board OK's Pan Am-TWA Route Swap
WASHINGTON The Civil Aeronautics Board
yesterday approved a route swap agreement between the
nation's two largest international airlines that will result in
less competition between the two carriers.
The agreement between Pan American World Airways
and Trans World Airlines could save the two carriers about
$25 million each, they estimated when they filed their
application.
It also will result in international travelers having fewer
airlines to choose from and could result in fewer flights
over the North Atlantic routes to Europe.
Both carriers have been financially ailing as a result of
skyrocketing fuel costs and a decline in international travel,
and both have reported huge losses on their North Atlantic
service.
Slate Panel, Arco Avoid Suit
SACRAMENTO The State Lands Commission and a
giant oil company agreed yesterday to avoid a legal battle at
least temporarily over renewed drilling in the Santa Barbara
Channel.
The commission voted unanimously to sign the
agreement with Atlantic Richfield Corp. over the
commission's suspension of permits for Arco to drill 17
new wells off Platform Holly.
William Northrop, commission executive officer, said the
agreement delays any action by either side while the staff
reviews the situation in the channel that was the site of the
disastrous 1969 oil well blowout and spill.
