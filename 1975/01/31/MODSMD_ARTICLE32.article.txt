# Rivers Suffers Stroke
## 
### 
Communication Prof. William L.
Rivers Tuesday apparently suffered a
minor stroke while on his way to a
routine check-up at the UC Medical
Center in San Francisco. Rivers' wife
said last night, "His condition is stable,
and he is expected to recover fully."
Mrs. Rivers also said her husband
would remain at the UC Medical
Center for at least a week while tests
are performed and analyzed by
doctors there. Communication
Department Chairman Lyle M. Nelson
said, "He's got the finest care there is.
It looks very favorable."
Doctors at the UC Medical Center
Kidney Transplant Clinic gave Rivers a
new kidney five years ago this month,
and his wife said he was on his way to
a regular clinical check-up Tuesday.
Sometime between 10 and 11 a.m.,
Rivers apparently collapsed within half

a block of the clinic. Nelson said when
San Francisco Police officers
discovered Rivers, the money from his
wallet and his watch were missing.
Nelson said he and other
Communication Department faculty
members "are making plans so that
there won't be any disruption of his
classes."
Rivers holds the Paul C. Edwards
endowed chair in communication and
is a prolific author of books and
magazine articles. His classes are
normally filled beyond capacity and
often have lengthy waiting lists.
A scheduled speech by Rivers was
canceled yesterday due to his illness.
He had been scheduled to speak at 8
p.m. Feb. 11 on "The Adversaries
Politics and the Press" as part of the
Tuesday Evening Lecture Series.
