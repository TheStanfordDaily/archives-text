Memorial Scholarship Fund
A scholarship fund has been
established in memory of Steven
Beaver, who died Jan. 24, 1975,; of
injuries sustained in a bicycle-car
collision.
Beaver, who received his doctoral
degree from the Sociology Department
here in 1972, was a research associate
of the department and employed at
the Stanford Research Institute.
Inquiries about the scholarship
fund should be directed to Asst.
Sociology Prof. Michael Hannan.
CORRECTION
Wednesday's' story covering KZSU's
Campus Conference reported that the
Inter-Fraternity Council has argued
that the fraternity system as a whole,
rather than individual fraternities,
should be responsible for meeting
housing quotas. The argument should
have been attributed to
Inter-Fraternity Council President
Mike Nilsson, not the Council.
