# Area Panel To Hold Child Care Discussion
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
A proposed information center on
child care facilities here will be one of
the topics considered in a town
hall-type meeting at 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Sponsored by the ASSU Council of
Presidents, the meeting is open to the
entire Stanford community and will
feature a, panel discussion on "Child
Care: A Service for Stanford
Families."

The panelists will be: Phyllis H.
Craig, consultant on child care to the
dean of student affairs; Dan Williams,
associate dean of student affairs; Leah

Kaplan, assistant to the dean of
student affairs for women students;
Judy Hubner, a resident of Palo Alto;
and Elliot Levison, a resident of
Escondido Village.
The panel discussion will be
followed by a dialogue between the
panel and the audience.
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
will moderate the discussion, hopes
the meeting will provide information
on the child care facilities already
available here.
'Many Need It'
"I really don't think there's a lot of
students who know about child care,"
Herman said. "Most know something
about it, many need it, but most don't
have access to information."
Students needing child care
facilities now get their information
from the Bechtel International Center,
in material sent to entering students,
or simply by word-of-mouth.
There are three centers for the
daytime care and education of
pre-school children here, offering three
types of care.
Bing Nursery School, the oldest,
also serves as a laboratory for the
Psychology Department and the
School of Education. Children come
for two, three or five half-day sessions.
Fees range from $llO per quarter (for
two sessions a week) to $275 (for five
sessions a week). Children from
non-University families are accepted.
Children's Center
In contrast, the Children's Center
of the Stanford Community (CCSC) is
a cooperative which accepts children
from University-affiliated families.
CCSC offers full or part-time day care
for 51 weeks of the year from 7:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday.
In exchange for 67 or 76 cents an
hour (depending on the age of the
children), plus some volunteer time,
parents may leave their children for a
minimum of two hours at a time to
eight hours a day every day.
The newest center, the Escondido
Village Nursery School (EVNS) is also
a cooperative and is located in the
Escondido Village Community Center,
accepting only students from Village
families.
EVNS children come for two or
three half-day sessions per week, for
$54 or $Bl a quarter (60 cents an
hour).
Social Interaction
The child care center is "good for
socializing children," commented Fran
Roth, CCSC director. They "learn to
interact with all kinds of
people ... become sophisticated and
independent."
Mary Ann Feist, president of EVNS
parent board, agreed, noted that in
this age of "nuclear families" children
don't establish relationships with
adults other than their parents.
And the benefits for parents?
"Child care provides me with the
luxuries of personal and professional
development that would otherwise be
denied to me and my wife," said Chris
Clark, Escondido resident.
"The wife may just need a few
hours a week to maintain her sanity,"
commented Feist. "You could say
we're providing a mental health service
in some cases," she added with a smile.
Economic Pinch
Like everyone else, the child care
centers are feeling the economic pinch.
All three are basically self-supporting,

using donations and money from fees
to support operating costs.
As a teaching facility, Bing does get
light, heat and maintenance service
from the University, said Director
Edith M. Dowley. Teachers' salaries
come from Bing's budget.
"We're very, very frugal," Dowley
said, observing that they are still using
chairs and tables that were new when
the Stanford Village Nursery School
(Bing's predecessor) opened in 1946.
"We sort of live from hand to
mouth," said Feist of EVNC. First
opened in November 1973, EVNS
staffers are still "learning how to keep
budgets balanced," Feist observed.
Subsidy From Village
The use of the Escondido
Community Center is "kind of a
subsidy from Escondido Village,"
Feist said.
EVNS received an initial loan from
the University, which it is still paying
off, as well as an ASSU fee assessment
fall quarter, said Feist.
CCSC tries to "operate on a
shoestring budget," Roth stated.
Earlier this school year, Craig had
suggested that CCSC might have to
seek a fee assessment. However, "the
tremendous urgency is off at the
moment," Craig said.

Escondido Village Community Center,
accepting only students from Village
families.
EVNS children come for two or
three half-day sessions per week, for
$54 or $Bl a quarter (60 cents an
hour).
Social Interaction
The child care center is "good for
socializing children," commented Fran
Roth, CCSC director. They "learn to
interact with all kinds of
people ... become sophisticated and
independent."
Mary Ann Feist, president of EVNS
parent board, agreed, noted that in
this age of "nuclear families" children
don't establish relationships with
adults other than their parents.
And the benefits for parents?
"Child care provides me with the
luxuries of personal and professional
development that would otherwise be
denied to me and my wife," said Chris
Clark, Escondido resident.
"The wife may just need a few
hours a week to maintain her sanity,"
commented Feist. "You could say
we're providing a mental health service
in some cases," she added with a smile.
Economic Pinch
Like everyone else, the child care
centers are feeling the economic pinch.
All three are basically self-supporting,

using donations and money from fees
to support operating costs.
As a teaching facility, Bing does get
light, heat and maintenance service
from the University, said Director
Edith M. Dowley. Teachers' salaries
come from Bing's budget.
"We're very, very frugal," Dowley
said, observing that they are still using
chairs and tables that were new when
the Stanford Village Nursery School
(Bing's predecessor) opened in 1946.
"We sort of live from hand to
mouth," said Feist of EVNC. First
opened in November 1973, EVNS
staffers are still "learning how to keep
budgets balanced," Feist observed.
Subsidy From Village
The use of the Escondido
Community Center is "kind of a
subsidy from Escondido Village,"
Feist said.
EVNS received an initial loan from
the University, which it is still paying
off, as well as an ASSU fee assessment
fall quarter, said Feist.
CCSC tries to "operate on a
shoestring budget," Roth stated.
Earlier this school year, Craig had
suggested that CCSC might have to
seek a fee assessment. However, "the
tremendous urgency is off at the
moment," Craig said.
A proposed information center on
child care facilities here will be one of
the topics considered in a town
hall-type meeting at 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Sponsored by the ASSU Council of
Presidents, the meeting is open to the
entire Stanford community and will
feature a, panel discussion on "Child
Care: A Service for Stanford
Families."

The panelists will be: Phyllis H.
Craig, consultant on child care to the
dean of student affairs; Dan Williams,
associate dean of student affairs; Leah

Kaplan, assistant to the dean of
student affairs for women students;
Judy Hubner, a resident of Palo Alto;
and Elliot Levison, a resident of
Escondido Village.
The panel discussion will be
followed by a dialogue between the
panel and the audience.
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
will moderate the discussion, hopes
the meeting will provide information
on the child care facilities already
available here.
'Many Need It'
"I really don't think there's a lot of
students who know about child care,"
Herman said. "Most know something
about it, many need it, but most don't
have access to information."
Students needing child care
facilities now get their information
from the Bechtel International Center,
in material sent to entering students,
or simply by word-of-mouth.
There are three centers for the
daytime care and education of
pre-school children here, offering three
types of care.
Bing Nursery School, the oldest,
also serves as a laboratory for the
Psychology Department and the
School of Education. Children come
for two, three or five half-day sessions.
Fees range from $llO per quarter (for
two sessions a week) to $275 (for five
sessions a week). Children from
non-University families are accepted.
Children's Center
In contrast, the Children's Center
of the Stanford Community (CCSC) is
a cooperative which accepts children
from University-affiliated families.
CCSC offers full or part-time day care
for 51 weeks of the year from 7:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday.
In exchange for 67 or 76 cents an
hour (depending on the age of the
children), plus some volunteer time,
parents may leave their children for a
minimum of two hours at a time to
eight hours a day every day.
The newest center, the Escondido
Village Nursery School (EVNS) is also
a cooperative and is located in the
Escondido Village Community Center,
accepting only students from Village
families.
EVNS children come for two or

Sponsored by the ASSU Council of
Presidents, the meeting is open to the
entire Stanford community and will
feature a, panel discussion on "Child
Care: A Service for Stanford
Families."

The panelists will be: Phyllis H.
Craig, consultant on child care to the
dean of student affairs; Dan Williams,
associate dean of student affairs; Leah

Kaplan, assistant to the dean of
student affairs for women students;
Judy Hubner, a resident of Palo Alto;
and Elliot Levison, a resident of
Escondido Village.
The panel discussion will be
followed by a dialogue between the
panel and the audience.
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
will moderate the discussion, hopes
the meeting will provide information
on the child care facilities already
available here.
'Many Need It'
"I really don't think there's a lot of
students who know about child care,"
Herman said. "Most know something
about it, many need it, but most don't
have access to information."
Students needing child care
facilities now get their information
from the Bechtel International Center,
in material sent to entering students,
or simply by word-of-mouth.
There are three centers for the
daytime care and education of
pre-school children here, offering three
types of care.
Bing Nursery School, the oldest,
also serves as a laboratory for the
Psychology Department and the
School of Education. Children come
for two, three or five half-day sessions.
Fees range from $llO per quarter (for
two sessions a week) to $275 (for five
sessions a week). Children from
non-University families are accepted.
Children's Center
In contrast, the Children's Center
of the Stanford Community (CCSC) is
a cooperative which accepts children
from University-affiliated families.
CCSC offers full or part-time day care
for 51 weeks of the year from 7:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday.
In exchange for 67 or 76 cents an
hour (depending on the age of the
children), plus some volunteer time,
parents may leave their children for a
minimum of two hours at a time to
eight hours a day every day.
The newest center, the Escondido
Village Nursery School (EVNS) is also
a cooperative and is located in the
Escondido Village Community Center,
accepting only students from Village
families.
EVNS children come for two or
three half-day sessions per week, for
$54 or $Bl a quarter (60 cents an
hour).
Social Interaction
The child care center is "good for
socializing children," commented Fran
Roth, CCSC director. They "learn to
interact with all kinds of
people ... become sophisticated and
independent."
Mary Ann Feist, president of EVNS
parent board, agreed, noted that in
this age of "nuclear families" children
don't establish relationships with
adults other than their parents.
And the benefits for parents?
"Child care provides me with the
luxuries of personal and professional
development that would otherwise be
denied to me and my wife," said Chris
Clark, Escondido resident.
"The wife may just need a few
hours a week to maintain her sanity,"
commented Feist. "You could say
we're providing a mental health service
in some cases," she added with a smile.
Economic Pinch
Like everyone else, the child care
centers are feeling the economic pinch.
All three are basically self-supporting,

using donations and money from fees
to support operating costs.
As a teaching facility, Bing does get
light, heat and maintenance service
from the University, said Director
Edith M. Dowley. Teachers' salaries
come from Bing's budget.
"We're very, very frugal," Dowley
said, observing that they are still using
chairs and tables that were new when
the Stanford Village Nursery School
(Bing's predecessor) opened in 1946.
"We sort of live from hand to
mouth," said Feist of EVNC. First
opened in November 1973, EVNS
staffers are still "learning how to keep
budgets balanced," Feist observed.
Subsidy From Village
The use of the Escondido
Community Center is "kind of a
subsidy from Escondido Village,"
Feist said.
EVNS received an initial loan from
the University, which it is still paying
off, as well as an ASSU fee assessment
fall quarter, said Feist.
CCSC tries to "operate on a
shoestring budget," Roth stated.
Earlier this school year, Craig had
suggested that CCSC might have to
seek a fee assessment. However, "the
tremendous urgency is off at the
moment," Craig said.
