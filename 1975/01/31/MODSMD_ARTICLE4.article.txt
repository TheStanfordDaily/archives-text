# Area Panel To Hold Child Care Discussion
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
A proposed information center on
child care facilities here will be one of
the topics considered in a town
hall-type meeting at 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Sponsored by the ASSU Council of
Presidents, the meeting is open to the
entire Stanford community and will
feature a, panel discussion on "Child
Care: A Service for Stanford
Families."

The panelists will be: Phyllis H.
Craig, consultant on child care to the
dean of student affairs; Dan Williams,
associate dean of student affairs; Leah

Kaplan, assistant to the dean of
student affairs for women students;
Judy Hubner, a resident of Palo Alto;
and Elliot Levison, a resident of
Escondido Village.
The panel discussion will be
followed by a dialogue between the
panel and the audience.
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
will moderate the discussion, hopes
the meeting will provide information
on the child care facilities already
available here.
'Many Need It'
"I really don't think there's a lot of
students who know about child care,"
Herman said. "Most know something
about it, many need it, but most don't
have access to information."
Students needing child care
facilities now get their information
from the Bechtel International Center,
in material sent to entering students,
or simply by word-of-mouth.
There are three centers for the
daytime care and education of
pre-school children here, offering three
types of care.
Bing Nursery School, the oldest,
also serves as a laboratory for the
Psychology Department and the
School of Education. Children come
for two, three or five half-day sessions.
Fees range from $llO per quarter (for
two sessions a week) to $275 (for five
sessions a week). Children from
non-University families are accepted.
Children's Center
In contrast, the Children's Center
of the Stanford Community (CCSC) is
a cooperative which accepts children
from University-affiliated families.
CCSC offers full or part-time day care
for 51 weeks of the year from 7:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday.
In exchange for 67 or 76 cents an
hour (depending on the age of the
children), plus some volunteer time,
parents may leave their children for a
minimum of two hours at a time to
eight hours a day every day.
The newest center, the Escondido
Village Nursery School (EVNS) is also
a cooperative and is located in the
