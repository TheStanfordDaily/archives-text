# Roddenberry Treks From TV To Tombstone

Sitting backstage in Memorial Auditorium's
green room, Star Trek executive producer
Gene Roddenberry sits answering the
questions of about 20 ardent Trekkies,
seemingly oblivious to the bomb threat that
has interrupted his Tuesday night speech.
"Friday evening at 10 p.m. is only slightly
better than Sunday morning at 2 a.m. for a
young audience," Roddenberry explains,
referring to the third-season time slot which
eventually killed the show as a series.
A man not easily swayed, Roddenberry
gave up his position as executive producer for
Star Trek's third season rather than produce
the show in a time slot which he knew would
cause the show's demise.
Embattled but not embittered,
Roddenberry understands the problems of
television executives caught in a system that
no one network can control. "They [the NBC
executives] always felt uncomfortable about
the show," he says.
"They weren't sure what it was. It wasn't a
Western, it wasn't a situation comedy. Was it a
kid show, was it an adult show they never
knew."
'Business Minds'
He calls the executives "business minds,
not creative minds. They're making so much
money they can make a lot of mistakes.
Losing a Star Trek isn't going to hurt them."
According to Roddenberry, a large

collegiate audience doesn't impress TV execs.
"They could care less if kids like you. You
guys aren't about to go buy a box of detergent
because someone is screaming 'ring around the
collar.'"
Conversation drifts from problems with
NBC to problems of production how did
the transporter work, how was the U.S.S.
Enterprise designed questions Roddenberry
answers thoroughly although he's
undoubtedly heard them thousands of times,
questions answered in the Star Trek books
which commemorate every phase of the
show's production.
"What I did was create a skeleton,"
Roddenberry said with modesty, crediting the
cast and crew of the show with most of what
Star Trek became.
Still, it was Roddenberry who was the final
judge of the believability of Star Trek's special
effects; it was Roddenberry who smoothed
over jealousies between cast members; it was
Roddenberry who ordered the compilation of
the blooper reels for the yearly cast party.
Alleged Fued
"It is the only show where everyone left as
good friends," Roddenberry says, answering a
question about an often-alleged feud between
series stars William Shatner and Leonard
Nimoy.
During Star Trek's first weeks,
Roddenberry admits, Shatner became anxious
because most of the fan mail received went to

Nimoy for his striking portrayal of Mr. Spock.
Roddenberry reassured Shatner, telling him
that the mail would soon even out, a
prediction that proved true.
When details of production had to be
decided, Roddenberry admits that he
sometimes arbitrarily contrived a scientific
theory to justify the effect he wanted.
"I'd say, 'this is how you transform a
person from matter into energy.' Inside my
head I'm saying, 'what do you know?', but
someone had to do it."
Asked if he was aware that most scientists
believe that travel by "warp drive" at speeds
above the speed of light is impossible, he
replies, "If it were not, we wouldn't be able to
get out of the studio and to the planet each
week."
Fan Phenomenon
Roddenberry explains that it is not the
scientific quality of the show, but a scientific
investigation of the Star Trek fan
phenomenon that has landed an 11-foot
model of the Enterprise in the Smithsonian
Institution, along with one episode from the
series.
Roddenberry's ideas about space, television
and human civilization in general make him
too easily describable as a man of vision. But
in Roddenberry's case, the words are not
cliched.
"Any country beaming millions and
millions of dollars worth of programs with the

only consideration being will it or won't it sell
toothpaste ..he declares, "I think it's in
trouble."
Roddenberry is asked the inevitable
question by a Trekkie dressed in a duplicate of
the familiar blue shirt worn by Dr. McCoy in
the series: "Where do you want to see Star
Trek go?" /
Roddenberry sighs, pauses, a tired creator
feeling a little too tied to his creation.
"I hope it will go on my
tombstone ... along with several other things
I have done."
Prodded further on the chance that Star
Trek will return not just as a movie but as a
television series, Roddenberry again
withdraws, saying, "I don't want to do a copy
of Star Trek. Writing is too much fun to copy
what you've already done."
Yet Roddenberry feels his creation might
be suited to television in a monthly special,
two-hour format. He is through with the rigors
of producing a weekly series through with
compromising his creation.
He protests, but the world of Star Trek is
undeniably the world of Gene Roddenberry.
"To go to a convention for three days and
be treated like God," he says. "Man my ego is
strong, but it can't take that."
What Roddenberry says of his show can be
said of himself.
"The original has grown rather larger than
life."
