## Values In News 
### 
During four months as editor of a college newspaper,!
experienced the normal number of second thoughts about
news judgment. I regretted some decisions, reveled in others,
but always tried to base my choices on a reasonable
estimation of what events had the most impact on the
readership of the Stanford Daily.
Many of these events were exciting, many were
unbearably dull and several were very unpleasant. I felt as
did the entire Daily staff a responsibility to report all
those events, from a euphoric Big Game victory over Cal to a
frightening murder in Memorial Church.
A few weeks after the murder, the news director of a San
Francisco radio station was talking about broadcast news to
a Stanford communication class. ''You've had a lot of good
stories down here," he said. "You had that murder. . ."
I was momentarily taken aback, though I probably
shouldn't have been. Journalists who deal daily with tragic
events tend to develop an immunity to emotional
involvement in the stories they cover. A certain hardness has
often characterized reporters and editors.
Many interpret this hardness as a professional necessity.
How else could journalists survive the countless words and
pictures describing tragic events that sift thrpugh newsrooms
every day? But the comment by the radio news director
struck me as more than just hardened professionalism. It
seemed to represent remarkable lack of sensitivity, and I was
shocked by the fact that a criterion existed by which murder
could be considered "good."
Much has been written about the importance of an
adversary relationship between reporters and their news
sources, and the necessity to present the public with a
straightforward account of even the ugliest news stories. I
agree with both of these principles.
But within the framework of journalistic responsibility
there is also a placS for journalistic sensitivity. If the various
media are to really serve the public, the cynicism that
abounds in newsrooms across the country will have to be
replaced by a new era of humility.
News is rarely measured in human terms. Scads of
reporters cover glamorous pseudo-events staged by the
government and' big corporations, but rarely are reporters
dispatched to poverty-stricken areas to write about human
suffering.
Douglass Cater, formerly a Washington reporter and now
director of the Aspen Program on Communication and
Society, regretted that "a rapidly growing crisis in the
finance and governance of cities" was never adequately
communicated to the people in the late 50s and early 60s.
"To refresh my memory," Cater wrote, "I recently
dispatched a researcher to the Libfary of Congress to review
the record, and found convincing evidence that the media
did not serve as an early warning system for the crisis.
Poverty, as [Michael] Harrington wrote in 1962, was
'invisible.' It was not being heard, not being communicated.
I was a reporter during that period and share the blame."
"Invisible" news stories still exist in the 70s, and it is
important that journalists re-direct some of their skepticism
toward themselves and start exploring some of the ongoing
situations that affect individuals much more significantly
than daily events. It involves new criteria for "news," and
perhaps a realization that sensitivity and idealism aren't
necessarily subserviant to more traditional journalistic
character traits like cynicism and skepticism.'
After all, journalists deal primarily with people. And
although I hope I can advance my journalistic skills to the
point where I am considered "professional," I hope I never
reach the stage where I weigh news values over personal

"Invisible" news stories still exist in the 70s, and it is
important that journalists re-direct some of their skepticism
toward themselves and start exploring some of the ongoing
situations that affect individuals much more significantly
than daily events. It involves new criteria for "news," and
perhaps a realization that sensitivity and idealism aren't
necessarily subserviant to more traditional journalistic
character traits like cynicism and skepticism.'

During four months as editor of a college newspaper,!
experienced the normal number of second thoughts about
news judgment. I regretted some decisions, reveled in others,
but always tried to base my choices on a reasonable
estimation of what events had the most impact on the
readership of the Stanford Daily.
Many of these events were exciting, many were
unbearably dull and several were very unpleasant. I felt as
did the entire Daily staff a responsibility to report all
those events, from a euphoric Big Game victory over Cal to a
frightening murder in Memorial Church.
A few weeks after the murder, the news director of a San
Francisco radio station was talking about broadcast news to
a Stanford communication class. ''You've had a lot of good
stories down here," he said. "You had that murder. . ."
I was momentarily taken aback, though I probably
shouldn't have been. Journalists who deal daily with tragic
events tend to develop an immunity to emotional
involvement in the stories they cover. A certain hardness has
often characterized reporters and editors.
Many interpret this hardness as a professional necessity.
How else could journalists survive the countless words and
pictures describing tragic events that sift thrpugh newsrooms
every day? But the comment by the radio news director
struck me as more than just hardened professionalism. It
seemed to represent remarkable lack of sensitivity, and I was
shocked by the fact that a criterion existed by which murder
could be considered "good."
Much has been written about the importance of an
adversary relationship between reporters and their news
sources, and the necessity to present the public with a
straightforward account of even the ugliest news stories. I
agree with both of these principles.
But within the framework of journalistic responsibility
there is also a placS for journalistic sensitivity. If the various
media are to really serve the public, the cynicism that
abounds in newsrooms across the country will have to be
replaced by a new era of humility.
News is rarely measured in human terms. Scads of
reporters cover glamorous pseudo-events staged by the
government and' big corporations, but rarely are reporters
dispatched to poverty-stricken areas to write about human
suffering.
Douglass Cater, formerly a Washington reporter and now
director of the Aspen Program on Communication and
Society, regretted that "a rapidly growing crisis in the
finance and governance of cities" was never adequately
communicated to the people in the late 50s and early 60s.
"To refresh my memory," Cater wrote, "I recently
dispatched a researcher to the Libfary of Congress to review
the record, and found convincing evidence that the media
did not serve as an early warning system for the crisis.
Poverty, as [Michael] Harrington wrote in 1962, was
'invisible.' It was not being heard, not being communicated.
