# Ted Kennedy Spends A Routine Busy Day In S.F.
## 
### STEVE HEFTER 
SAN FRANCISCO — Michael Novelli handled
the arrangements for last Friday's half-day visit of
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
"He's the hardest guy in the world to get from
one place to another," Novelli said. "Girls want
him, the press wants him; it's almost impossible."
Kennedy came to San Francisco to address the
Commonwealth Club of California. He challenged
the energy programs of President Ford and outlined
an eight-point scheme of his own.
But surrounding the mid-day speech were TV
tapings, press conferences, a Stanford Daily
interview and private meetings.
At one such meeting, Kennedy talked with
Stanford and UC-San Francisco representatives
about recent proposals to encourage young doctors
to practice in areas with few medical services*
Kennedy has recommended that federally funded
medical schools require two years of such practice
from their graduates.
Rich There
Stanford Medical School Dean Clayton Rich was
there, and at the conclusion of the meeting was
grabbed by Kennedy's advance man from
Washington.
"We'd like a picture of you with the senator,
sir," the aide insisted. Rich looked startled.
The aide hurriedly pushed others aside and
motioned toward the door. A reporter and
photographer darted in and the latter quickly
snapped pictures of the smiling Rich and Kennedy.
'Exchanged Opinion'
The aides rushed Kennedy away. Rich spoke
unabashedly, "We exchanged opinions on legislation
which would directly affect medical schools. As you
may know, Senator Kennedy is a very powerful key

figure in that whole set of legislation."
At Kennedy's next meeting the press waited
anxiously outside. A stout, long-haired man looking
about 19 introduced himself. "Hi, I'm Jann," he
said.
On the 39th floor of the San Francisco Hilton,
where Kennedy had his suite, the longhair was
introduced again. "This is Jann Wenner," a Kennedy
aide said. "He's the editor of Rolling Stone
magazine."
Talks To Senator
Along with friends of Kennedy, Wenner talked to
the senator about the CIA and the FBI. Then
Kennedy descended to the hotel's Continental
Ballroom, where he would address a crowd of 2000.
On the way, Kennedy talked with the Daily.
"I strongly oppose any further military aid to
South Vietnam," he said in his familiar Boston
accent. "You're fortunate, here in California, to
have two senators who also oppose sending further
aid."
Continued Opposition
Kennedy said he did not believe repeated bomb
threats to federal buildings would influence the
course of American policy, but maintained that less
bellicose opposition to hostilities should be
continued.
"I think you can write your congressmen and
senators and let them know that you support them
in this effort [to cut off aid]."
Looking back on the two years since the United
States withdrew its troops from Vietnam, Kennedy
said, "We should have had negotiations continue
throughout. Instead, we washed our hands of the
entire affair.
"As of four months ago it was pointed out that
South Vietnam has more territory than at the time

of the Paris agreement. The South is clearly as much
the aggressor as the North."
As the back elevator dropped toward the ground
floor, he talked about the CIA.
"The purpose and function is only toward the
development of intelligence material. They
shouldn't have any role in covert activities. I am
strongly opposed to this."
'Drop A Note'
The elevator reached lobby level. Kennedy was
ambivalent toward the Buckley Amendment
allowing student access to confidential files. "The
whole question of the privacy of the various files is
obviously something which is of very considerable
importance, but then so is the ...uh . .. Why don't
you drop me a note on that?"
In the Commonwealth Club speech, Kennedy
attacked President Ford's energy program.
"I believe that President Ford's energy plan is
seriously flawed. It seeks to cut energy consumption
too fast, at the risk of excessive and immediate costs
in unemployment and inflation."
Outlined Proposals
The senator then outlined his own energy
proposals, including mandated standards for
automobile efficiency and higher taxes on
gas-guzzling cars, better home insulation and mass
transit systems, a mandatory allocation program for
gasoline and a stand-by rationing program with legal
selling of ration coupons.
After a few subsequent television interviews,
Kennedy talked about his earlier meeting with Rich
and other medical school deans. They discussed
Kennedy's doctor-distribution plan and a
non-compulsive system offered by the American
Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC).

TEDDY TALKS—Senator Edward Kennedy addresses the Commonwealth Club
of California, where he announced an eight-point energy program. Kennedy
called Ford's energy plan "seriously flawed" and said it would only add to
unemployment and inflation.
"I think we have to determine whether the alternatives
[to compulsion] are real alternatives in respect to meeting
maldistribution in various areas," Kennedy said.
Kennedy's Plan
Rich had said Kennedy's legislation would probably
contain a provision that medical schools would have to
secure a statement from the student agreeing to two years
of service in government-mandated areas, in order for the
school to be granted federal funding.
"As an alternative," Rich said, "the AAMC feels that
there's a good chance that through the system of incentives
voluntary methods will correct maldistribution problems."
Rich added, "The University doesn't like forcing
students into anything."
It was now 2:15 and Mike Novelli's shirt was sopping

wet. He had been with the senator the whole day. He had
held back the throngs of spectators who wanted to touch
the last Kennedy brother. He had watched the senator
calculate each word during a day of speeches and
discussions. And yet Ted Kenendy was still a stranger to
him.
At 2:20, after the final press conference, Ted Kennedy
stood alone. For just a second no one was near him.
A member of the senator's staff had said it earlier while
talking with his wife outside the senator's suite. "You
know,"he said, "he's always alone."
At 3:15, Edward Kennedy boarded a plane at San
Francisco International Airport and headed for Los
Angeles. Tomorrow would be another day of press
conferences, speeches and meetings.

about 19 introduced himself. "Hi, I'm Jann," he
said.
On the 39th floor of the San Francisco Hilton,
where Kennedy had his suite, the longhair was
introduced again. "This is Jann Wenner," a Kennedy
aide said. "He's the editor of Rolling Stone
magazine."
Talks To Senator
Along with friends of Kennedy, Wenner talked to
the senator about the CIA and the FBI. Then
Kennedy descended to the hotel's Continental
Ballroom, where he would address a crowd of 2000.
On the way, Kennedy talked with the Daily.
"I strongly oppose any further military aid to
South Vietnam," he said in his familiar Boston
accent. "You're fortunate, here in California, to
have two senators who also oppose sending further
aid."
Continued Opposition
Kennedy said he did not believe repeated bomb
threats to federal buildings would influence the
course of American policy, but maintained that less
bellicose opposition to hostilities should be
continued.
"I think you can write your congressmen and
senators and let them know that you support them
in this effort [to cut off aid]."
Looking back on the two years since the United
States withdrew its troops from Vietnam, Kennedy
said, "We should have had negotiations continue
throughout. Instead, we washed our hands of the
entire affair.
"As of four months ago it was pointed out that
South Vietnam has more territory than at the time

of the Paris agreement. The South is clearly as much
the aggressor as the North."
As the back elevator dropped toward the ground
floor, he talked about the CIA.
"The purpose and function is only toward the
development of intelligence material. They
shouldn't have any role in covert activities. I am
strongly opposed to this."
'Drop A Note'
The elevator reached lobby level. Kennedy was
ambivalent toward the Buckley Amendment
allowing student access to confidential files. "The
whole question of the privacy of the various files is
obviously something which is of very considerable
importance, but then so is the ...uh . .. Why don't
you drop me a note on that?"
In the Commonwealth Club speech, Kennedy
attacked President Ford's energy program.
"I believe that President Ford's energy plan is
seriously flawed. It seeks to cut energy consumption
too fast, at the risk of excessive and immediate costs
in unemployment and inflation."
Outlined Proposals
The senator then outlined his own energy
proposals, including mandated standards for
automobile efficiency and higher taxes on
gas-guzzling cars, better home insulation and mass
transit systems, a mandatory allocation program for
gasoline and a stand-by rationing program with legal
selling of ration coupons.
After a few subsequent television interviews,
Kennedy talked about his earlier meeting with Rich
and other medical school deans. They discussed
Kennedy's doctor-distribution plan and a
non-compulsive system offered by the American
Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC).

TEDDY TALKS—Senator Edward Kennedy addresses the Commonwealth Club
of California, where he announced an eight-point energy program. Kennedy
called Ford's energy plan "seriously flawed" and said it would only add to
unemployment and inflation.
"I think we have to determine whether the alternatives
[to compulsion] are real alternatives in respect to meeting
maldistribution in various areas," Kennedy said.
Kennedy's Plan
Rich had said Kennedy's legislation would probably
contain a provision that medical schools would have to
secure a statement from the student agreeing to two years
of service in government-mandated areas, in order for the
school to be granted federal funding.
"As an alternative," Rich said, "the AAMC feels that
there's a good chance that through the system of incentives
voluntary methods will correct maldistribution problems."
Rich added, "The University doesn't like forcing
students into anything."
It was now 2:15 and Mike Novelli's shirt was sopping

wet. He had been with the senator the whole day. He had
held back the throngs of spectators who wanted to touch
the last Kennedy brother. He had watched the senator
calculate each word during a day of speeches and
discussions. And yet Ted Kenendy was still a stranger to
him.
At 2:20, after the final press conference, Ted Kennedy
stood alone. For just a second no one was near him.
A member of the senator's staff had said it earlier while
talking with his wife outside the senator's suite. "You
know,"he said, "he's always alone."
At 3:15, Edward Kennedy boarded a plane at San
Francisco International Airport and headed for Los
Angeles. Tomorrow would be another day of press
conferences, speeches and meetings.
SAN FRANCISCO — Michael Novelli handled
the arrangements for last Friday's half-day visit of
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
"He's the hardest guy in the world to get from
one place to another," Novelli said. "Girls want
him, the press wants him; it's almost impossible."
Kennedy came to San Francisco to address the
Commonwealth Club of California. He challenged
the energy programs of President Ford and outlined
an eight-point scheme of his own.
But surrounding the mid-day speech were TV
tapings, press conferences, a Stanford Daily
interview and private meetings.
At one such meeting, Kennedy talked with
Stanford and UC-San Francisco representatives
about recent proposals to encourage young doctors
to practice in areas with few medical services*
Kennedy has recommended that federally funded
medical schools require two years of such practice
from their graduates.
Rich There
Stanford Medical School Dean Clayton Rich was
there, and at the conclusion of the meeting was
grabbed by Kennedy's advance man from
Washington.
"We'd like a picture of you with the senator,
sir," the aide insisted. Rich looked startled.
The aide hurriedly pushed others aside and
motioned toward the door. A reporter and
photographer darted in and the latter quickly
snapped pictures of the smiling Rich and Kennedy.
'Exchanged Opinion'
The aides rushed Kennedy away. Rich spoke
unabashedly, "We exchanged opinions on legislation
which would directly affect medical schools. As you
may know, Senator Kennedy is a very powerful key

figure in that whole set of legislation."
At Kennedy's next meeting the press waited
anxiously outside. A stout, long-haired man looking

shouldn't have any role in covert activities. I am
strongly opposed to this."
'Drop A Note'
The elevator reached lobby level. Kennedy was
ambivalent toward the Buckley Amendment
allowing student access to confidential files. "The
whole question of the privacy of the various files is
obviously something which is of very considerable
importance, but then so is the ...uh . .. Why don't
you drop me a note on that?"
In the Commonwealth Club speech, Kennedy
attacked President Ford's energy program.
"I believe that President Ford's energy plan is
seriously flawed. It seeks to cut energy consumption
too fast, at the risk of excessive and immediate costs
in unemployment and inflation."
Outlined Proposals
The senator then outlined his own energy
proposals, including mandated standards for
automobile efficiency and higher taxes on
gas-guzzling cars, better home insulation and mass
transit systems, a mandatory allocation program for
gasoline and a stand-by rationing program with legal
selling of ration coupons.
After a few subsequent television interviews,
Kennedy talked about his earlier meeting with Rich
and other medical school deans. They discussed
Kennedy's doctor-distribution plan and a
non-compulsive system offered by the American
Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC).

TEDDY TALKS—Senator Edward Kennedy addresses the Commonwealth Club
of California, where he announced an eight-point energy program. Kennedy
called Ford's energy plan "seriously flawed" and said it would only add to
unemployment and inflation.
"I think we have to determine whether the alternatives
[to compulsion] are real alternatives in respect to meeting
maldistribution in various areas," Kennedy said.
Kennedy's Plan
Rich had said Kennedy's legislation would probably
contain a provision that medical schools would have to
secure a statement from the student agreeing to two years
of service in government-mandated areas, in order for the
school to be granted federal funding.
"As an alternative," Rich said, "the AAMC feels that
there's a good chance that through the system of incentives
voluntary methods will correct maldistribution problems."
Rich added, "The University doesn't like forcing
students into anything."
It was now 2:15 and Mike Novelli's shirt was sopping

wet. He had been with the senator the whole day. He had
held back the throngs of spectators who wanted to touch
the last Kennedy brother. He had watched the senator
calculate each word during a day of speeches and
discussions. And yet Ted Kenendy was still a stranger to
him.
At 2:20, after the final press conference, Ted Kennedy
stood alone. For just a second no one was near him.
A member of the senator's staff had said it earlier while
talking with his wife outside the senator's suite. "You
know,"he said, "he's always alone."
At 3:15, Edward Kennedy boarded a plane at San
Francisco International Airport and headed for Los
Angeles. Tomorrow would be another day of press
conferences, speeches and meetings.
SAN FRANCISCO — Michael Novelli handled
the arrangements for last Friday's half-day visit of
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
"He's the hardest guy in the world to get from
one place to another," Novelli said. "Girls want
him, the press wants him; it's almost impossible."
Kennedy came to San Francisco to address the
Commonwealth Club of California. He challenged
the energy programs of President Ford and outlined
an eight-point scheme of his own.
But surrounding the mid-day speech were TV
tapings, press conferences, a Stanford Daily
interview and private meetings.
At one such meeting, Kennedy talked with
Stanford and UC-San Francisco representatives
about recent proposals to encourage young doctors
to practice in areas with few medical services*
Kennedy has recommended that federally funded
medical schools require two years of such practice
from their graduates.
Rich There
Stanford Medical School Dean Clayton Rich was
there, and at the conclusion of the meeting was
grabbed by Kennedy's advance man from
Washington.
"We'd like a picture of you with the senator,
sir," the aide insisted. Rich looked startled.
The aide hurriedly pushed others aside and
motioned toward the door. A reporter and
photographer darted in and the latter quickly
snapped pictures of the smiling Rich and Kennedy.
'Exchanged Opinion'
The aides rushed Kennedy away. Rich spoke
unabashedly, "We exchanged opinions on legislation
which would directly affect medical schools. As you
may know, Senator Kennedy is a very powerful key

figure in that whole set of legislation."
At Kennedy's next meeting the press waited
anxiously outside. A stout, long-haired man looking
about 19 introduced himself. "Hi, I'm Jann," he
said.
On the 39th floor of the San Francisco Hilton,
where Kennedy had his suite, the longhair was
introduced again. "This is Jann Wenner," a Kennedy
aide said. "He's the editor of Rolling Stone
magazine."
Talks To Senator
Along with friends of Kennedy, Wenner talked to
the senator about the CIA and the FBI. Then
Kennedy descended to the hotel's Continental
Ballroom, where he would address a crowd of 2000.
On the way, Kennedy talked with the Daily.
"I strongly oppose any further military aid to
South Vietnam," he said in his familiar Boston
accent. "You're fortunate, here in California, to
have two senators who also oppose sending further
aid."
Continued Opposition
Kennedy said he did not believe repeated bomb
threats to federal buildings would influence the
course of American policy, but maintained that less
bellicose opposition to hostilities should be
continued.
"I think you can write your congressmen and
senators and let them know that you support them
in this effort [to cut off aid]."
Looking back on the two years since the United
States withdrew its troops from Vietnam, Kennedy
said, "We should have had negotiations continue
throughout. Instead, we washed our hands of the
entire affair.
"As of four months ago it was pointed out that
South Vietnam has more territory than at the time

of the Paris agreement. The South is clearly as much
the aggressor as the North."
As the back elevator dropped toward the ground
floor, he talked about the CIA.
"The purpose and function is only toward the
development of intelligence material. They
shouldn't have any role in covert activities. I am
strongly opposed to this."
'Drop A Note'
The elevator reached lobby level. Kennedy was
