# SCIRE Should Remain Independent
## Dave Galligan 
### 
In protesting the proposed
elimination of SWOPSI by June
1976, it is crucial not to overlook
the importance of its sister
program SCIRE whose scheduled
demise in June of this year is of
really more immediate concern.
Discussion of SWOPSI has tended
to dominate recent debate over
the phasing out of selected
extra-departmental programs as
suggested by Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
The consequent lack of
emphasis on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program is somewhat justifiable,
however. After all, Gibbs' idea
that these programs can be
absorbed within already existing
departmental frameworks seems
at least possible. The situation
with SCIRE, though, is very
different.
The Stanford community little
appreciates (because it is little
aware of) all that SCIRE has
provided the University since the
late 19605. SWOPSI itself grew
from the SCIRE "umbrella"
organization. SWOPSI was able to
use SCIRE as one method of
obtaining academic credit for its
courses until it received its own
credit-granting mechanisms. The
same exact thing occurred when
the Urban Studies program was
first getting off the ground.
Distinguished Record
There are many other examples
of outstanding features of this
community today which, but for
SCIRE, might never have existed.
The Undergraduate Program in
the School of Education (UPSE)
and the optical observatory in the
hills behind campus, now
operated by the Physics
Department, were initiated
through SCIRE. So were the
Stanford Savoyards and Ecology
(now Terra) House. Just this year
SCIRE, established a $4000
innovation fund to help establish
new and worthwhile projects.
That means $4000 of SCIRE's
already minimal $25,000 budget

is being funneled directly back
into student hands. SCIRE has
quite a record of accomplishment.
It has made quite an impact.
Besides providing an
institutional framework for
developing programs, SCIRE has
taken on the task of institutional
introspection. This inward-looking
philosophy has resulted this year
in the definition by SCIRE of two
problem areas: transfer student
orientation and the departmental
advising systems. That these are
serious problems has been obvious
for years. But who has taken the
initiative to solve them? Not the
regular institutions of this
University, though SCIRE has
been working intensely with
them, but SCIRE itself. Social
activities for the 400 or so

transfer students per year have
been organized and an
Approaching Stanford specifically
for them is being written.
Significant Input
Another factor to consider in
evaluating SCIRE is the
significance of its input into the
SWOPSI program. Students,
myself included, are taking
advantage of the opportunity
SCIRE provides to plan a course
with the specific intent that it be
taught through SWOPSI. One of
the SWOPSI courses this quarter
started this way and three of the
current SCIRE projects are being
designed to become SWOPSI
courses in the spring.
SCIRE and SWOPSI, then, are
complementary programs in this
respect, as well as many others.

The preservation of SWOPSI
without SCIRE would leave real
holes in its functioning. Students
should never allow the
independent, evaluative functions
of SCIRE or the increased
responsibility for their own
education which SCIRE
represents to slip away.
Nor should they acquiesce even
in the dropping of the name
"SCIRE." It won't save any
money for one thing, but more
than that it would mean the end
of the highly respected and
recognizable acronym for an
organization whose services to
Stanford have been and are still
invaluable.

That means $4000 of SCIRE's
already minimal $25,000 budget

is being funneled directly back
into student hands. SCIRE has
quite a record of accomplishment.
It has made quite an impact.
Besides providing an
institutional framework for
developing programs, SCIRE has
taken on the task of institutional
introspection. This inward-looking
philosophy has resulted this year
in the definition by SCIRE of two
problem areas: transfer student
orientation and the departmental
advising systems. That these are
serious problems has been obvious
for years. But who has taken the
initiative to solve them? Not the
regular institutions of this
University, though SCIRE has
been working intensely with
them, but SCIRE itself. Social
activities for the 400 or so

transfer students per year have
been organized and an
Approaching Stanford specifically
for them is being written.
Significant Input
Another factor to consider in
evaluating SCIRE is the
significance of its input into the
SWOPSI program. Students,
myself included, are taking
advantage of the opportunity
SCIRE provides to plan a course
with the specific intent that it be
taught through SWOPSI. One of
the SWOPSI courses this quarter
started this way and three of the
current SCIRE projects are being
designed to become SWOPSI
courses in the spring.
SCIRE and SWOPSI, then, are
complementary programs in this
respect, as well as many others.

The preservation of SWOPSI
without SCIRE would leave real
holes in its functioning. Students
should never allow the
independent, evaluative functions
of SCIRE or the increased
responsibility for their own
education which SCIRE
represents to slip away.
Nor should they acquiesce even
in the dropping of the name
"SCIRE." It won't save any
money for one thing, but more
than that it would mean the end
of the highly respected and
recognizable acronym for an
organization whose services to
Stanford have been and are still
invaluable.

undergraduate majoring in
international relations.)
In protesting the proposed
elimination of SWOPSI by June
1976, it is crucial not to overlook
the importance of its sister
program SCIRE whose scheduled
demise in June of this year is of
really more immediate concern.
Discussion of SWOPSI has tended
to dominate recent debate over
the phasing out of selected
extra-departmental programs as
suggested by Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
The consequent lack of
emphasis on Urban Studies and
the Undergraduate Writing
Program is somewhat justifiable,
however. After all, Gibbs' idea
that these programs can be
absorbed within already existing
departmental frameworks seems
at least possible. The situation
with SCIRE, though, is very
different.
The Stanford community little
appreciates (because it is little
aware of) all that SCIRE has
provided the University since the
late 19605. SWOPSI itself grew
from the SCIRE "umbrella"
organization. SWOPSI was able to
use SCIRE as one method of
obtaining academic credit for its
courses until it received its own
credit-granting mechanisms. The
same exact thing occurred when
the Urban Studies program was
first getting off the ground.
Distinguished Record
There are many other examples
of outstanding features of this
community today which, but for
SCIRE, might never have existed.
The Undergraduate Program in
the School of Education (UPSE)
and the optical observatory in the
hills behind campus, now
operated by the Physics
Department, were initiated
through SCIRE. So were the
Stanford Savoyards and Ecology
(now Terra) House. Just this year
SCIRE, established a $4000
innovation fund to help establish
new and worthwhile projects.
