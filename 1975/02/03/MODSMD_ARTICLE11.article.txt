# Keep Health Service 'Free'
## Susan Cole 
### 
William Ross (Daily, Jan. 29) asserted that
student funding ofCowell Student Health Center is
inequitable and should be discontinued. I strongly
disagree.
First, singling out Cowell as if it were the unique
example of "inequitable" expenditure of the
students' money is misleading.
For example, the libraries, the biology and
language labs, the golf course, the Computation
Center, the music listening room, the Sunday flicks
â€” all are subsidized entirely or in part by
"involuntary" funding from the student body.
Everyone pays for these equally, although there is
wild disparity between actual amount of use by
individuals.
Ross' assertion that "no Stanford student would
go without medical care if forced to pay fees at
Cowell" is simply wrong. Many of the "people who
can pay thousands of dollars a year in tuition" are
being heavily buttressed by scholarships or loans.
If attending to a sprained arm were going to set
them back another thirty or forty dollars, they
might very well go without treatment.
Moreover, if the rest of us can so easily afford to
lay out the kind of money private physicians charge
for their services, it should be no great hardship
for us to pay $40 more per quarter to insure
adequate health care for ourselves and our fellow

students.
Finally, I believe the greatest advantage of the
present free care system is the easy accessibility it
provides to services of which a student might not
otherwise take advantage. As one of the "seven
percent of students per year" who have taken
advantage of the psychological counseling services
offered here, I can state with assurance that it was
one of the most beneficial aspects of my Stanford
experience.
Furthermore, I can state with equal assurance
that if I had had to go through the formal and
unfamiliar procedure (not to mention the expense)
of seeking out a counselor on my own, I would
never have done it. I'm sure many others can say
the same. Moreover, the same undoubtedly also
holds true for many of those who have sought
contraceptive counseling, testing for various
pathologies, or treatment for any number of
injuries and illnesses, which would have been just
too expensive, or just too much hassle, to get
outside of the present system of medical service.
Inexpensive, easy to obtain, guaranteed
competent medical service for all is a wonderful
goal to set ourselves for the future, but in the
meantime, let's appreciate the foretaste of it we can
get at Stanford now.
