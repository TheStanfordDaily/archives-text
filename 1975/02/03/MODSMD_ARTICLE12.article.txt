## More About Irish 
### 
Editor:
What are the criteria for
granting professorial tenure?
Should the educational objectives
of a university be considered? The
denial of tenure to Prof. Jerry
Irish leads one to believe that
excellence of instruction is
unimportant.
Is this institution so insensitive
a bureaucracy that it has lost
of its basic objectives? Has it
become so callous that its first
priorities are directed towards
status through publication?
"Publish or perish," a byword for
struggling academicians, suggests
for undergraduate education a
misapplication of professorial
energy.
Will a Stanford undergraduate
education be worth the rising
costs forecast in the future? If
Stanford's priorities continue, a
reasonable alternative would be to
attend a state supported
university where excellence in
instruction is valued, while
reading the books written by
Stanford's prolific
professor-authors.

Editor:
The University is giving
undergraduates a very clear
message in the denial of tenure to
Prof. Jerry Irish. It is saying that
the opinions of scores of students
who have experienced his expert
teaching and guidance first hand
are ultimately of no weight. They
are also implying that the
opinions of Irish's fellow
department professors with whom
he has worked most intimately are
of no weight.
In addition, I found the
opinion expressed in the Jan. 27
Daily by Lewis Spitz, associate
dean of the Humanities and
Sciences, to add insult to injury.
The dean said "if a student wants
a professor to devote full time to
him, he shouldn't come to
Stanford. These men are leaders in
their respective fields .. . Stanford
is only for those strong-minded
and independent students." The
message is not only that students
have no voice in who educates
them, but students are of little
importance.
The overall goal of this
University is the furtherance of
research and reputation, not
education.

Make Faculty Pay Fees
Editor:
As the wife of a faculty
member, it's never been clear to
me why faculty and staff receive
their parking stickers free while
students are asked to pay a
healthy fee. Perhaps it's a
throwback to times when the
student body was, in general, '
wealthier, and staff members
more poorly paid.
Also, because faculty and staff
may request several stickers for
several cars, it's not uncommon to
see students from these families
using reserve parking lots.
I trust that both in the
immediate student resistence in
regard to parking fees, and in the
long range study now underway,
that the administration will look
squarely at the merits of the
situation, and will discard any
attempts to justify a policy which
may be out of date.
How about a flat fee of three,
four, or five dollars for everyone,
and only one sticker per employee
or student? If the long range
study indicates that it's time for
parking fees to cover more of the
maintenance of campus roads,
perhaps the fee will have to be
considerably higher, and maybe
sliding, depending on distance of
residence from campus. If this
stimulates a few more people to
return to bicycles, I'm sure
faculty and staff would benefit in
terms of health as much, if not
more, than most students.

Coin A New Acronym
Editor:
Since President Ford's program
to "Whip Inflation Now" has
turned out to be such a bust, I
suggest that we recycle all those
WIN buttons to serve a better
purpose. If the button is turned 112
upside down, it reads, NIM, a
perfect acronym for "No
Indochina Monkeyshines" â€” or,
those who do not want to turn
the button upside down could
read the letters backward: "No
Indochina War."
Since our government always
tells us the reverse of what it
really intends to do in Southeast
Asia, the logic of reading the
letters on the WIN button
backwards and making our own
interpretation of their meaning
should be obvious.
