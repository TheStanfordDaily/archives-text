## Mayor Strives For 'People Power,' Not 'Black Power,' In E. Palo Alto 
### PENNY SORRELLS 
"I've been black all my life," says
Mayor Henry Anthony of East Palo
Alto, "I don't need to talk about Black
Power. I talk about People Power."
Anthony swings a chair around and
straddles it. The seat designated for
the mayor remains empty, a formality
brushed aside. He wears a knit shirt
and brown slacks.
"I'm working towards a political
rather than a black community by
getting more people to vote on
community issues and by forming
community groups," he says.
Anthony has gathered East Palo
Alto businessmen together establishing
the first chamber of commerce in the
city. This summer, he organized an
arts committee for the improvement
of cultural life.
"This town is made up, primarily,

of people from the South," he says.
"These are country people. What they
want is a marching band and a
community choir. You have to move
slowly and slip the other things — art,
drama, and literature — on them
gradually.
"I would eventually like to have a
little theater, a movie theater and an
FM radio station."
Anthony's participation in the
community is übiquitous. He often
attends as many as 20 meetings a
week. His wife, Lavora, and their son,
Marty, are very understanding of his
time, says Anthony.
In 1953 the Anthony family moved
to California from Waukegan, 111.
Anthony attended UC-Berkeley,
obtaining a degree in Business
Administration. Before that, he had
attended Roosevelt University in

Chicago. And he's still studying today
towards a real estate license.
"The local agents won't like it, but
every month I get calls from people
who are behind in their house
payments asking me what to do,"
Anthony says, referring to the
particular property problems of East
Palo Alto.

"I'm working towards a
political rather than
a black community."

Property Problems
On almost every block, a house has
been abandoned by its owners.

Boarded up with posted warnings
against trespassing, the houses stand
empty for years while litigation
proceeds.
Usually, the houses are purchased
by the federal government,
refurbished, and then sold either by
draw or by bid at very low prices.
Some of the houses are purchased by
outside investors who often become
"slum landlords," says Anthony.
"They don't have any interest in
the community's image," he explains,
"and they give up caring when
confronted by the high rate of
transciency."
East Palo Alto is an unincorporated
area inhabited predominantly by
non-white peoples. It is governed by
San Mateo County's Board of
Supervisors. As a result of citizens'
demands for community control, the
Municipal Council was formed in
1968. It serves as an adviser to the
board.
Community Commitment
Robert Van Horn, former executive
administrator of the council, attributes
the council's viability to its members
". . . who were not one issue
candidates, but interested in the total
community."
Anthony has been a member of the
council since its inception. He is
serving his second term as chairman.
"My hobby and lifeblood is
community development," he says.
Prior to involvement in politics,
Anthony was head of a council of 29
churches. He advanced from Boy
Scoutmaster to Neighborhood
Commissioner of Boy Scouts. As
mayor, he says his aim is to develop
East Palo Alto into a political
community with influence and
control.
Aims AndActions
He punches his thick fingers into
the air and pushes them down one at a
time. "My goals for East Palo Alto are
to incorporate in five years so we can
have our own police department and
our own administrative process, and to
expand our tax and land base by
de-annexing t.<e 96-acre Kavanaugh
area from Menlo Park, and Cooley's
Landing, a natural, deep water harbor,
from Palo Alto."
Around the community, Anthony's

brown, English Ford is hardly noticed
by the corner gatherers or elderly
porch sitters. While driving, he stops to
record the locations of abandoned cars
and littered lots. Later, he'll
recommend appropriate action.
He responds to a call frgm a woma.
with a complaint. Stopping by her
house, he holds the microphone of his
cassette tape recorder while she tells
him that the dogs are traveling at night
in packs and raiding the garbage cans.

'They expect me, because
I'm black, to solve every
problem.make decisions."

"Yes, we know this is a problem
and we've alerted the Humane Society.
If you call them tomorrow, Mrs. Mims,

they'll patrol your house and pick up
the dogs," he assures her.
Standard Procedure
The visits and the tape recorder are
standard procedure for the man who
believes in total commitment and
community involvement, even if it's
only a call to the Humane Society.
"They expect me, because I'm
black, to solve every problem, make
decisions, and carry them out
immediately. As much as I'd like to,
they don't realize that we lack the
resources." In 1967, Anthony won the
governor's award for creative
citizenship. He has also earned
community service awards for citizen
participation.
But the evidence of his dedication
is that he performs mayoral duties
after his regular working hours. During
the day, Henry Anthony works at
Veteran's Administration Hospital in
electronic communication technology.
"That's my vocation," he says.

MAYOR HERBERT ANTHONY
"I've been black all my life," says
Mayor Henry Anthony of East Palo
Alto, "I don't need to talk about Black
Power. I talk about People Power."
Anthony swings a chair around and
straddles it. The seat designated for
the mayor remains empty, a formality
brushed aside. He wears a knit shirt
and brown slacks.
"I'm working towards a political
rather than a black community by
getting more people to vote on
community issues and by forming
community groups," he says.
Anthony has gathered East Palo
Alto businessmen together establishing
the first chamber of commerce in the
city. This summer, he organized an
arts committee for the improvement
of cultural life.
"This town is made up, primarily,

of people from the South," he says.
"These are country people. What they
want is a marching band and a
community choir. You have to move
slowly and slip the other things — art,
drama, and literature — on them
gradually.
"I would eventually like to have a
little theater, a movie theater and an
FM radio station."
Anthony's participation in the
community is übiquitous. He often
attends as many as 20 meetings a
week. His wife, Lavora, and their son,
Marty, are very understanding of his
time, says Anthony.
In 1953 the Anthony family moved
to California from Waukegan, 111.
Anthony attended UC-Berkeley,
obtaining a degree in Business
Administration. Before that, he had
attended Roosevelt University in

Chicago. And he's still studying today
towards a real estate license.
"The local agents won't like it, but
every month I get calls from people
who are behind in their house
payments asking me what to do,"
Anthony says, referring to the
particular property problems of East
Palo Alto.

PROPERTY PROBLEMS—Delapidated property is one of the problems which community residents would like Mayor
Anthony to solve. "As much as I'd like to ... we lack the resources," Anthony says. He blames part of the problem on
"slum landlords" who "don't have any interest in the community's image." Anthony says he often walks around the
community taking note of specific problems and outlining "appropriate" action.

MAYOR HERBERT ANTHONY
"I've been black all my life," says
Mayor Henry Anthony of East Palo
Alto, "I don't need to talk about Black
Power. I talk about People Power."
Anthony swings a chair around and
straddles it. The seat designated for
the mayor remains empty, a formality
brushed aside. He wears a knit shirt
and brown slacks.
"I'm working towards a political
rather than a black community by
getting more people to vote on
community issues and by forming
community groups," he says.
Anthony has gathered East Palo
Alto businessmen together establishing
the first chamber of commerce in the
city. This summer, he organized an
arts committee for the improvement
of cultural life.
"This town is made up, primarily,

of people from the South," he says.
"These are country people. What they
want is a marching band and a
community choir. You have to move
slowly and slip the other things — art,
drama, and literature — on them
gradually.
"I would eventually like to have a
little theater, a movie theater and an
FM radio station."
Anthony's participation in the
community is übiquitous. He often
attends as many as 20 meetings a
week. His wife, Lavora, and their son,
Marty, are very understanding of his
time, says Anthony.
In 1953 the Anthony family moved
to California from Waukegan, 111.
Anthony attended UC-Berkeley,
obtaining a degree in Business
Administration. Before that, he had
attended Roosevelt University in

Chicago. And he's still studying today
towards a real estate license.
"The local agents won't like it, but
every month I get calls from people
who are behind in their house
payments asking me what to do,"
Anthony says, referring to the
particular property problems of East
Palo Alto.

"I'm working towards a
political rather than
a black community."

Property Problems
On almost every block, a house has
been abandoned by its owners.

Boarded up with posted warnings
against trespassing, the houses stand
empty for years while litigation
proceeds.
Usually, the houses are purchased
by the federal government,
refurbished, and then sold either by
draw or by bid at very low prices.
Some of the houses are purchased by
outside investors who often become
"slum landlords," says Anthony.
"They don't have any interest in
the community's image," he explains,
"and they give up caring when
confronted by the high rate of
transciency."
East Palo Alto is an unincorporated
area inhabited predominantly by
non-white peoples. It is governed by
San Mateo County's Board of
Supervisors. As a result of citizens'
demands for community control, the
Municipal Council was formed in
1968. It serves as an adviser to the
board.
Community Commitment
Robert Van Horn, former executive
administrator of the council, attributes
the council's viability to its members
". . . who were not one issue
candidates, but interested in the total
community."
Anthony has been a member of the
council since its inception. He is
serving his second term as chairman.
"My hobby and lifeblood is
community development," he says.
Prior to involvement in politics,
Anthony was head of a council of 29
churches. He advanced from Boy
Scoutmaster to Neighborhood
Commissioner of Boy Scouts. As
mayor, he says his aim is to develop
East Palo Alto into a political
community with influence and
control.
Aims AndActions
He punches his thick fingers into
the air and pushes them down one at a
time. "My goals for East Palo Alto are
to incorporate in five years so we can
have our own police department and
our own administrative process, and to
expand our tax and land base by
de-annexing t.<e 96-acre Kavanaugh
area from Menlo Park, and Cooley's
Landing, a natural, deep water harbor,
from Palo Alto."
