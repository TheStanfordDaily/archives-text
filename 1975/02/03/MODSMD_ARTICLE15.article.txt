# Author Sees Few Sex Differences

"There are only three pretty
clear sex differences," Carol
Jacklin, co-author of the new
book The Psychology of Sex
Differences, stated in a speech last
week on "Sex Differences: Myths
and Realities."
Two of the differences are

intellectual — verbal abilities and
spacial visualization; the other is
aggression, Jacklin explained in
her talk, part of the Center for
Research on Women (CROW)
lecture series.
Submission and passivity are
not sex differences she remarked,
and neither are memory,
creativity, analytical ability and
learning ability.
The intellectual sex differences
"don't seem to come in until
puberty, Jacklin elaborated. At
that point, girls become better at

verbal ability and boys excel at
spaeial visualization.
She explained that spaeial
visual abilities involve being able
to "rotate objects in your head."
Jacklin pointed out that verbal
and spaeial visualization abilities
are not mutually exclusive.
Largest Sex Difference
She said that unlike verbal
abilities and spaeial visualization,
"agression seems to be a sex
difference as early as you can
measure it. It is the largest
difference we have."
Even among 18-month-old
children, interaction among two
boys is more aggressive than
among two girls or a boy and a
girl, Jacklin noted.
Environmental factors, such as
having to take care of children,
reduces aggression, she said.
A study done with boys and
girls taking care of young children
showed that boys who had taken
care of young children were
significantly less aggressive than
boys who hadn't.
Girls had no distinguishable
differences in aggression whether
they had taken care of children or
not, she said.
No Special Treatment
"There is not a substantial
body of research that shows that
mothers treat their boys
differently than they treat their
girls," Jacklin said. She added that
fat hers don't appear to treat their
daughters any more protectively
than they treat their sons.
While dominance is a sex
difference that is related to
aggression, Jacklin said, there are
many traits, such as cooperation,
competition, timidity-fear, test
anxiety and pain, that are in a
"question mark" category.
No one is sure if they are sex
differences or not, she added.
