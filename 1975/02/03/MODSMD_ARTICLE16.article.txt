## Bird Brains Stanford Cal Stalls Cards' Title Hopes, 60-46 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
BERKELEY—If you tuned
into the telecast of the
Stanford-Cal basketball game
Saturday afternoon and expected
a game, you must have had the
wrong station. It was an awful
basketball game, but a great
example of instructional TV.
The prof? Cal coach Dick
Edwards. The lesson? How to
make Stanford look sick. And you
can bet all those other Pacific
Eight coaches took very, very
copious notes.
Cal beat Stanford 60-46 using a
tremendously effective 3-2 zone
defense that denied the Cards' big
inside men, Rich Kelley and Ed
Schweitzer, the ball.
No Outside Shooting
The textbook sayeth that the
way to beat such a zone is to
shoot from outside. But Stanford
couldn't shoot from outside. Hell,
the Cards couldn't shoot at all,
hitting only 34 percent of their
field goal attempts.
"They did a fine job on the
zone," Card coach Howie Dallmar
said. "They cut out our passing
lanes. They were contesting a lot
of our shots and blocked a
number of them."

When Rich Kelley got the ball,
he put it in, scoring 24 points
(though he didn't play very well).
Schweitzer Snuffed
Stanford didn't have another
man with more than a laughable
four points. Schweitzer, normally
a big gun, was completely choked
off by the zone, which looked
almost tailormade to stop him.
And none of the Card guards
could pick up the slack.
Meanwhile. Cal ran a semi-stall
offense designed to "control the
tempo of the game," according to
Edwards. It did so. The tempo
resembled a Bing Crosby ballad.
Yesterday's San Francisco
Examiner aptly dubbed it the
"Golden Bore."
Unusual Offense
The offense consisted of three
players dribbling and passing
around for awhile waiting for a
lane to open up or Stanford to
foul. It marked a complete
turnaround for the Bears, who
have been criticized for being a
very individualistic team with a
iot of talent that is wasted by too
much dribbling and not enough
passing.
When Cal finally did deign to
shoot, the shots it took usually
went it. Forward Carl Bird, an
excellent all-around player,
devastated the Cards by hitting 9
of 12 shots for 23 points.
With the Bears leading by only
36-31, Bird hit two straight
jumpers. A bit later, with the
score 42-35, Bird twice zoomed
downcourt and consummated fast
breaks with layups.
Waste Of Time
After that, there were seven
minutes left, which could have
been more profitably used by
showing seven commercials. They
would have been more interesting.
After the game, Bird said that
Cal neutralized Stanford's height
by showing "quickness in getting
open for the shot. Go around
rather than over." Dallmar agreed,
noting that Cal used its
spread-court offense because it

has "players who can do
that. .. they can go one-on-one
with you."
There was also one
Bird-brained comment. Quoth
Carl, "Stanford played a good
game." Well, maybe he was just

trying to be polite.
As Kelley said, "We played bad
offense and bad defense."
And unless Stanford finds
some outside shooting pretty
soon, things may keep getting
badder.
Cardinal Notes: Mark Gilberg
played an excellent defensive
game, staying with super-quick
Rickie Hawthorne and holding
him to 11 points. A referee told
Gilberg not to fall down.
Apparently the official didn't
want Gilberg's acting to make him
look bad to the TV
audience .. . Melvin Arterberry
only played five minutes.
Arterberry has knee problems,
and doesn't have the outside
shooting range needed to beat
Cal's zone ...
Dallmar said that "In order for
us to stay in the [Pac-8] race, we
have to win two of the three road
games, the first one being the Cal
game. His implication was that
Stanford must beat both
Washington and Washington State
this weekend . ..

EFFORTLESS CATCH—Rickie Hawthorne's flat-footed catch of a
gass typified the ease with which California controlled the ball in
aturday's game. Hawthorne combined with Connie White and Carl
Bird in a three man stall which effectively blocked out chances for a
Stanford comeback in the second half.

Bird-brained comment. Quoth
Carl, "Stanford played a good
game." Well, maybe he was just

trying to be polite.
As Kelley said, "We played bad
offense and bad defense."
And unless Stanford finds
some outside shooting pretty
soon, things may keep getting
badder.
Cardinal Notes: Mark Gilberg
played an excellent defensive
game, staying with super-quick
Rickie Hawthorne and holding
him to 11 points. A referee told
Gilberg not to fall down.
Apparently the official didn't
want Gilberg's acting to make him
look bad to the TV
audience .. . Melvin Arterberry
only played five minutes.
Arterberry has knee problems,
and doesn't have the outside
shooting range needed to beat
Cal's zone ...
Dallmar said that "In order for
us to stay in the [Pac-8] race, we
have to win two of the three road
games, the first one being the Cal
game. His implication was that
Stanford must beat both
Washington and Washington State
this weekend . ..

EFFORTLESS CATCH—Rickie Hawthorne's flat-footed catch of a
gass typified the ease with which California controlled the ball in
aturday's game. Hawthorne combined with Connie White and Carl
Bird in a three man stall which effectively blocked out chances for a
Stanford comeback in the second half.

BERKELEY—If you tuned
into the telecast of the
Stanford-Cal basketball game
Saturday afternoon and expected
a game, you must have had the
wrong station. It was an awful
basketball game, but a great
example of instructional TV.
The prof? Cal coach Dick
Edwards. The lesson? How to
make Stanford look sick. And you
can bet all those other Pacific
Eight coaches took very, very
copious notes.
Cal beat Stanford 60-46 using a
tremendously effective 3-2 zone
defense that denied the Cards' big
inside men, Rich Kelley and Ed
Schweitzer, the ball.
No Outside Shooting
The textbook sayeth that the
way to beat such a zone is to
shoot from outside. But Stanford
couldn't shoot from outside. Hell,
the Cards couldn't shoot at all,
hitting only 34 percent of their
field goal attempts.
"They did a fine job on the
zone," Card coach Howie Dallmar
said. "They cut out our passing
lanes. They were contesting a lot
of our shots and blocked a
number of them."

When Rich Kelley got the ball,
he put it in, scoring 24 points
(though he didn't play very well).
Schweitzer Snuffed
Stanford didn't have another
man with more than a laughable
four points. Schweitzer, normally
a big gun, was completely choked
off by the zone, which looked
almost tailormade to stop him.
And none of the Card guards
could pick up the slack.
Meanwhile. Cal ran a semi-stall
offense designed to "control the
tempo of the game," according to
Edwards. It did so. The tempo
resembled a Bing Crosby ballad.
Yesterday's San Francisco
Examiner aptly dubbed it the
"Golden Bore."
Unusual Offense
The offense consisted of three
players dribbling and passing
around for awhile waiting for a
lane to open up or Stanford to
foul. It marked a complete
turnaround for the Bears, who
have been criticized for being a
very individualistic team with a
iot of talent that is wasted by too
much dribbling and not enough
passing.
When Cal finally did deign to
shoot, the shots it took usually
went it. Forward Carl Bird, an
excellent all-around player,
devastated the Cards by hitting 9
of 12 shots for 23 points.
With the Bears leading by only
36-31, Bird hit two straight
jumpers. A bit later, with the
score 42-35, Bird twice zoomed
downcourt and consummated fast
breaks with layups.
Waste Of Time
After that, there were seven
minutes left, which could have
been more profitably used by
showing seven commercials. They
would have been more interesting.
After the game, Bird said that
Cal neutralized Stanford's height
by showing "quickness in getting
open for the shot. Go around
rather than over." Dallmar agreed,
noting that Cal used its
spread-court offense because it

has "players who can do
that. .. they can go one-on-one
with you."

Meanwhile. Cal ran a semi-stall
offense designed to "control the
tempo of the game," according to
Edwards. It did so. The tempo
resembled a Bing Crosby ballad.
Yesterday's San Francisco
Examiner aptly dubbed it the
"Golden Bore."
Unusual Offense
The offense consisted of three
players dribbling and passing
around for awhile waiting for a
lane to open up or Stanford to
foul. It marked a complete
turnaround for the Bears, who
have been criticized for being a
very individualistic team with a
iot of talent that is wasted by too
much dribbling and not enough
passing.
When Cal finally did deign to
shoot, the shots it took usually
went it. Forward Carl Bird, an
excellent all-around player,
devastated the Cards by hitting 9
of 12 shots for 23 points.
With the Bears leading by only
36-31, Bird hit two straight
jumpers. A bit later, with the
score 42-35, Bird twice zoomed
downcourt and consummated fast
breaks with layups.
Waste Of Time
After that, there were seven
minutes left, which could have
been more profitably used by
showing seven commercials. They
would have been more interesting.
After the game, Bird said that
Cal neutralized Stanford's height
by showing "quickness in getting
open for the shot. Go around
rather than over." Dallmar agreed,
noting that Cal used its
spread-court offense because it

has "players who can do
that. .. they can go one-on-one
with you."
There was also one
Bird-brained comment. Quoth
Carl, "Stanford played a good
game." Well, maybe he was just

trying to be polite.
As Kelley said, "We played bad
offense and bad defense."
And unless Stanford finds
some outside shooting pretty
soon, things may keep getting
badder.
Cardinal Notes: Mark Gilberg
played an excellent defensive
game, staying with super-quick
Rickie Hawthorne and holding
him to 11 points. A referee told
Gilberg not to fall down.
Apparently the official didn't
want Gilberg's acting to make him
look bad to the TV
audience .. . Melvin Arterberry
only played five minutes.
Arterberry has knee problems,
and doesn't have the outside
shooting range needed to beat
Cal's zone ...
Dallmar said that "In order for
us to stay in the [Pac-8] race, we
have to win two of the three road
games, the first one being the Cal
game. His implication was that
Stanford must beat both
Washington and Washington State
this weekend . ..

EFFORTLESS CATCH—Rickie Hawthorne's flat-footed catch of a
gass typified the ease with which California controlled the ball in
aturday's game. Hawthorne combined with Connie White and Carl
Bird in a three man stall which effectively blocked out chances for a
Stanford comeback in the second half.
