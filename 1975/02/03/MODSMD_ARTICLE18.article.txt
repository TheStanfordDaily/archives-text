San Jose Drops Ruggers
The Card ruggers lost their
second game in a row Saturday,
dropping a 16-6 contest to San
Jose State, on Harry Maloney
Field before 100 rain-soaked
rugger huggers.
The Spartans jumped out to an
early 3-0 first half lead, when
player-coach Terry Buchanon
booted a 30-yard penalty kick.
But captain Lawry Lieberman
converted two penalty kicks, to
give Stanford a 6-3 advantage
midway in the period.
The Card lead was shortlived,
as San Jose State got a "gift try"
late in the first half to take a 9-6
halftime lead, and that was all
they needed. The Spartan scrum
effectively throttled the Card

backfield for the rest of the
contest, and Buchanon, one of the
Bay Area's most experienced
rugby players, led the Spartan
backfield to another try late in
the second half, to make the final
score 16-6.
Next week figures to be
somewhat of a homecoming for
the ruggers, as they take on the
Bay Area Touring Side on Harry
Maloney Field. The BATS team
includes seven former Stanford
ruggers.

Gymnasts Whip Chico State
When a team takes a three
week break from competition,
they usually figure to be a bit
sluggish when they return to
action, right? Well, not quite, or

at least not in the case of the
Stanford gymnastics team. The
gymnasts proved that the layoff
did not affect them as they
whipped visiting Chico State
202.68 to 193.11 Friday.
Freshman Bob Farb, last year's
New York state high school
all-around champion, led the way
for the Cards, taking the
all-around crown with 53.27
points.
Farb won the vaulting and
took second in the side horse and
parallel bars while teammate Bob
Anderson won three events to
claim all but one of the six
individual titles.
Wrestlers Split Two
The Stanford wrestling team,
after dropping a 20-13 decision to
Humboldt State Friday in Areata,
rebounded to whip the University
of Pacific 27-11 and Puget Sound
39-3, Saturday afternoon in
Areata.
Friday night the Cards suffered
a collapse in the final three
matches. Humboldt led 14-13
going into the final three contests
and swept them all on decisions to
hand Stanford the loss.
Sophomore Mark Yancey
wrestled well for the Cards on
Saturday, winning a 22-7 superior
decision over Puget Sound's Steve
Hansen and pinning Pacific's Steve
Robbert in 2:35.

whipped visiting Chico State
202.68 to 193.11 Friday.
Freshman Bob Farb, last year's
New York state high school
all-around champion, led the way
for the Cards, taking the
all-around crown with 53.27
points.
Farb won the vaulting and
took second in the side horse and
parallel bars while teammate Bob
Anderson won three events to
claim all but one of the six
individual titles.
Wrestlers Split Two
The Stanford wrestling team,
after dropping a 20-13 decision to
Humboldt State Friday in Areata,
rebounded to whip the University
of Pacific 27-11 and Puget Sound
39-3, Saturday afternoon in
Areata.
Friday night the Cards suffered
a collapse in the final three
matches. Humboldt led 14-13
going into the final three contests
and swept them all on decisions to
hand Stanford the loss.
Sophomore Mark Yancey
wrestled well for the Cards on
Saturday, winning a 22-7 superior
decision over Puget Sound's Steve
Hansen and pinning Pacific's Steve
Robbert in 2:35.
San Jose Drops Ruggers
The Card ruggers lost their
second game in a row Saturday,
dropping a 16-6 contest to San
Jose State, on Harry Maloney
Field before 100 rain-soaked
rugger huggers.
The Spartans jumped out to an
early 3-0 first half lead, when
player-coach Terry Buchanon
booted a 30-yard penalty kick.
But captain Lawry Lieberman
converted two penalty kicks, to
give Stanford a 6-3 advantage
midway in the period.
The Card lead was shortlived,
as San Jose State got a "gift try"
late in the first half to take a 9-6
halftime lead, and that was all
they needed. The Spartan scrum
effectively throttled the Card

backfield for the rest of the
contest, and Buchanon, one of the
Bay Area's most experienced
rugby players, led the Spartan
backfield to another try late in
the second half, to make the final
score 16-6.
Next week figures to be
somewhat of a homecoming for
the ruggers, as they take on the
Bay Area Touring Side on Harry
Maloney Field. The BATS team
includes seven former Stanford
ruggers.

Gymnasts Whip Chico State
When a team takes a three
week break from competition,
they usually figure to be a bit
sluggish when they return to
action, right? Well, not quite, or

at least not in the case of the
Stanford gymnastics team. The
gymnasts proved that the layoff
did not affect them as they
whipped visiting Chico State
202.68 to 193.11 Friday.
