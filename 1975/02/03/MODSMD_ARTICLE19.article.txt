# JV Cagers Out-Defense Cal
## 
### PAUL BAUMAN 
Stanford's junior varsity
basketball team keeps getting
better.
In defeating the California
junior varsity 64-56 Saturday in
Berkeley, Stanford's JV's broke a
Cal winning streak of ten straight
games and advanced their own
winning string to five in a row.
Cal (10-3) led at the half
30-29, but Stanford's defense
dominated the second half and
the Cards (6-3) finally pulled
away in the final minutes. The
Bears shot a miserable 31 percent
from the floor.
"We kept switching the defense
around," said assistant coach Ken
Morgan, "and that kept Cal off
balance. We pressed them before
they could set up their offense."
Which is exactly what Stanford
didn't do in the tough 56-53 win
over Santa Clara last Thursday.
Santa Clara and Cal are probably
the best teams Stanford will plav

all year, but Morgan was glad the
Cards played them back to back.
"We controlled the tempo of
the game, and the experience
against Santa Clara helped more
than anything," Morgan said.
Whenever Cal got the lead, they'd
go into a four-corner stall like the
varsity. Playing Santa Clara
prepared us for that. Our guys
didn't seem to have any trouble
with it."
Mark Fitzner and Terry
McCartin led Stanford with ten
points apiece, as eleven players
got into the scoring act. i
Stanford is off next weekendj
but will face San Jose State there
on Tuesday, Feb. 11 at 7 p.m.
