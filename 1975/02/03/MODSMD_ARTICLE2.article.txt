# Hoover Institution Will Receive Reagan's Gubernatorial Papers
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Former Gov. Ronald Reagan will
deposit his gubernatorial papers at the
Hoover Institution, the University
announced Saturday.
Reagan has also accepted an
( appointment as an honorary Hoover
Fellow, and will participate in
seminars and workshops on the
campus, according to Hoover Director
W.Glenn Campbell.
The two-term Republican, who left
office last month, will probably spend
about one day a month on campus,
. Campbell said.
The gubernatorial documents,
about 1700 boxes of material weighing
some 25 tons,will be available to
researchers approved by Reagan or his
representatives. During the first year,
Reagan will retain legal ownership of

the papers, but the papers may
subsequently be donated outright to
Hoover.
(The Institution is also home to
many of the presidential documents of
Herbert Hoover, for whom it is named.
The papers of the late Gov. Goodwin
J. Knight, a Republican who served
from 1953 to 1959, are at the
Stanford Library.)
Due Next Month
Reagan's documents include state
cabinet proceedings, staff papers,
correspondence, drafts of speeches and
proposed legislation, personal notes
and campaign material.
Campbell said the documents are
due on campus within the next month,
and some may be available for research
even while they are being processed. "I
understand from talking to

Sacramento that they [the
documents] are already in quite good
order," Campbell said.
Hoover will appoint an
archivist-researcher to organize the
collection and will provide secretarial
and research aid to Reagan, who will
work primarily out of his Los Angeles
offices.
Reagan, 63, first gained national
attention as a motion picture actor in
the 1930s and 1940s and on television
in the 1950s (among his most famous
roles: George Gipp in The Knute
Rockne Story and the host on Death
Valley Days).
Politically Active
But Reagan was politically active
even in his Hollywood days. A
one-time liberal Democrat and former
president of the Screen Actors Guild,

Reagan became increasingly
conservative in his political views. In
1964, he campaigned extensively for
Barry Gold water, the Republican
presidential nominee, and two years
later launched his own bid for elective
office.
In that campaign, which attracted
nationwide attention, Reagan defeated
two-term incumbent Democrat
Edmund G. Brown Sr. in a
million-vote landslide. Two years later,
he was an unsuccessful candidate for
the Republican nomination for
president. Reagan was re-elected
governor in 1970.
Campbell praised Reagan's
accomplishments, saying, "I have high
regard for him, both as a
citizen-politician and as a human
being."
Reagan is the author of one book,
an autobiography called Where's the
Rest of Me?, and is currently
syndicating a series of five-minute
political commentaries over 160 radio
stations.
Conservative Leader
He is considered a national leader
of the conservative wing of the
Republican party, and is a likely
candidate for president should
President Ford reverse himself and
decide not to run in 1976.
Reagan could not immediately be
reached for comment on his decision
to deposit his papers at Hoover. He
has, however, frequently been
associated with Campbell, both on the
University of California's Board of
Regents (Campbell is a Reagan
appointee), and during the campaign
for Reagan's ill-fated Proposition One,
a 1973 ballot proposal that would
have set a constitutional limitation on
state expenditures.
No dollar value has been attached
to the Reagan collection, but
Campbell noted that a similar gift of
papers by former Gov. Brown to
T JC-Berkeley's Bancroft Library eight
years ago was estimated at about
$105,000.

documents] are already in quite good
order," Campbell said.
Hoover will appoint an
archivist-researcher to organize the
collection and will provide secretarial
and research aid to Reagan, who will
work primarily out of his Los Angeles
offices.
Reagan, 63, first gained national
attention as a motion picture actor in
the 1930s and 1940s and on television
in the 1950s (among his most famous
roles: George Gipp in The Knute
Rockne Story and the host on Death
Valley Days).
Politically Active
But Reagan was politically active
even in his Hollywood days. A
one-time liberal Democrat and former
president of the Screen Actors Guild,

Reagan became increasingly
conservative in his political views. In
1964, he campaigned extensively for
Barry Gold water, the Republican
presidential nominee, and two years
later launched his own bid for elective
office.
In that campaign, which attracted
nationwide attention, Reagan defeated
two-term incumbent Democrat
Edmund G. Brown Sr. in a
million-vote landslide. Two years later,
he was an unsuccessful candidate for
the Republican nomination for
president. Reagan was re-elected
governor in 1970.
Campbell praised Reagan's
accomplishments, saying, "I have high
regard for him, both as a
citizen-politician and as a human
being."
Reagan is the author of one book,
an autobiography called Where's the
Rest of Me?, and is currently
syndicating a series of five-minute
political commentaries over 160 radio
stations.
Conservative Leader
He is considered a national leader
of the conservative wing of the
Republican party, and is a likely
candidate for president should
President Ford reverse himself and
decide not to run in 1976.
Reagan could not immediately be
reached for comment on his decision
to deposit his papers at Hoover. He
has, however, frequently been
associated with Campbell, both on the
University of California's Board of
Regents (Campbell is a Reagan
appointee), and during the campaign
for Reagan's ill-fated Proposition One,
a 1973 ballot proposal that would
have set a constitutional limitation on
state expenditures.
No dollar value has been attached
to the Reagan collection, but
Campbell noted that a similar gift of
papers by former Gov. Brown to
T JC-Berkeley's Bancroft Library eight
years ago was estimated at about
$105,000.
Former Gov. Ronald Reagan will
deposit his gubernatorial papers at the
Hoover Institution, the University
announced Saturday.
Reagan has also accepted an
( appointment as an honorary Hoover
Fellow, and will participate in
seminars and workshops on the
campus, according to Hoover Director
W.Glenn Campbell.
The two-term Republican, who left
office last month, will probably spend
about one day a month on campus,
. Campbell said.
The gubernatorial documents,
about 1700 boxes of material weighing
some 25 tons,will be available to
researchers approved by Reagan or his
representatives. During the first year,
Reagan will retain legal ownership of

the papers, but the papers may
subsequently be donated outright to
Hoover.
(The Institution is also home to
many of the presidential documents of
Herbert Hoover, for whom it is named.
The papers of the late Gov. Goodwin
J. Knight, a Republican who served
from 1953 to 1959, are at the
Stanford Library.)
Due Next Month
Reagan's documents include state
cabinet proceedings, staff papers,
correspondence, drafts of speeches and
proposed legislation, personal notes
and campaign material.
Campbell said the documents are
due on campus within the next month,
and some may be available for research
even while they are being processed. "I
understand from talking to

Sacramento that they [the
documents] are already in quite good
order," Campbell said.
