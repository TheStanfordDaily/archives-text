Church: Reform CIA, Don't Wreck It
WASHINGTON — Sen. Frank Church said yesterday the
aim of his special Senate committee investigating
intelligence agencies is "not to wreck them but, if
necessary, to reform them."
Appearing on CBS' Face the Nation, Church said he has
been shocked by allegations of domestic activity by the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), but added i-hat he has
not drawn any conclusions as to the accuracy of the
charges.
The Idaho Democrat heads a Senate committee probing
the various intelligence agencies operated by the
government. A similar House panel is expected to be
recommended tomorrow by the House Democratic Steering
Committee.
Church was asked if former CIA director Richard Helms
had explained discrepancies in testimony given when he was
confirmed as ambassador to Iran, and later testimony on
the CIA. Church said Helms had explained the differences,
but that he wanted a further explanation.
Woodcock: Lay-Off Funds Running Out
DETROIT — Unless there is an abrupt turnaround in car
sales, workers at Chrysler Corp. and General Motors will
exhaust special company-paid unemployment funds this
spring, Leonard Woodcock says.
The United Auto Workers president warned that when
that happens, it will bring "substantial suffering" in
communities with large numbers of jobless auto workers.
Woodcock said in an interview that 185,000 UAW
members laid off indefinitely by the four U.S. car
companies will be recalled next fall or winter only "if we
follow the correct fiscal policies."
"The way to help the automobile industry is to help the
total economy," he said. To stimulate the economy he
urged a reduction in withholding taxes as well as the rebate
on 1974 income taxes.
Of the nation's 687,000 auto workers, 254,000 are out
of work this week, with 26 assembly lines shut down
because of the slump in car sales.
Indian Protesters Reach Agreement
GRESHAM, Wis. — Agreement was announced yesterday
for ending a Native American takeover of a religious
estate, but evacuation was stalled by further demands from
the demonstrators.
Robert Bryan, of Birmingham, Ala., a legal adviser for
the demonstrators, said talks were planned today
concerning terms under which the estimated 40 armed
Menominee would end the seizure that began Jan. 1.
The Alexian Brothers Catholic order, which owns the
estate, has offered to give it to the Indians, but the terms
were not immediately available. The monastic order had
been seeking to sell the estate for $750,000.
The National Guard, tightening its 800-man security
force around the estate, said it was working on final details

of evacuation.
Slasher Eludes Poliee
LOS ANGELES — The Skid Row Slasher continued to
evade one of the largest manhunts in the city's history
yesterday as authorities followed up hundreds of leads in
hopes of closing a dragnet around a suspect whose identity
remains a mystery.
Police admitted they have little substantive information
to go on in the effort to locate the skillful killer, who
surgically slices each victim's throat, from ear to ear, to the
spine.
"The police department is rather sensitive when it can't
solve a crime, and here we have nine crimes in a row," said
police Cmdr. Pete Hagan. He said, however, that the
manhunt was still going fullsteam.
Meanwhile, harried investigators confirmed that none of
the Slasher's nine victims had been too drunk to defend
himself.
The victims — seven in the down-and-out section of
downtown and two in middle class Hollywood apartments
— apparently were physically weak and some were
destitute, but only one had even a trace of alcohol in his
blood, a coroner's spokesman said.
More than 30 police officers — members of the
department's so-called Slasher Squad — continued to follow
up numerous tips on a fulltime basis, with all days-off
cancelled.
Telephone Company Reeorded Calls
ST. LOUIS — At least 1.5 million long-distance calls
from six cities were recorded by the Bell Telephone System
in an effort to detect toll frauds, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch said in its yesterday editions.
In addition to calls originating from St. Louis, the
newspaper said in a copyrighted story, calls from New
York, Detroit, Miami, Los Angeles and Newark, N.J., were
recorded during a six-year period.
The program ended in the spring of 1970 when Bell
executives were warned that the company's image might be
damaged if information concerning the monitoring program
leaked to the public, the Post-Dispatch said.
Tape recordings of toll calls included segments of from
30 to 90 seconds, the newspaper story said, but fewer than
500 of 1.5 million calls recorded were confirmed as
fraudulent.
The Post-Dispatch said the press relations director for
the American Telephone & Telegraph Co., William Mullane,
confirmed most of the details in the copyrighted story.
