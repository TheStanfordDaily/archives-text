# Liquor Shortage Unlikely Here
## 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
The chances that Stanford will go
dry this week are slim — but not
because of the rain.
State officials forced 13 of the
largest beer, wine and liquor
wholesalers in Northern California to
close their doors for 15 days as a
penalty for violating the law.
According to Peter Sexton, deputy
director of the state Department of
Alcoholic Beverages Control, the
penalty was imposed because
wholesalers gave money or free
products to retailers to induce them to
purchase liquor from that particular
wholesaler.
The 15-day penalty expires Friday,
but until then, there's probably no
need to worry about a liquor shortage.
Mike McDonald, manager of Ernie's
Liquors on El Camino in Palo Alto,
says that retailers knew about the
temporary shut-down in December
when it was publicized in the trade
paper, Beverage Industry News.
A 1 Rosingana, owner of Alma
Liquors in Palo Alto, said he
anticipated the shut-down. "We knew
it would last two weeks, so we stocked
up two weeks extra" beforehand.
The manager of Ernie's Liquors on
University Avenue in Palo Alto says he
hopes to have enough liquor in the
warehouse to supply his customers
through Friday, when the wholesalers
can resume sales. It means "drying up
the sources " in the warehouse, but he
said there should be enough to supply

all requests.
Explains McDonald of the El
Camino Ernie's: "I doubt very
seriously if anyone will see an effect.
Relatively unknown items will [run
out] — like Bourbon Supreme, and
items people will want a case of, like
Galliano." Normal items, like any
vodka, gin or rum bottled under brand
names that "sell the most, we bought
ahead of time" and should have
enough.

The state actually suspended
licenses of the wholesalers for a total
of 45 days, but 30 days of that
suspension will not be imposed as long
as the wholesalers are not found in
violation of the law or any department
regulation for a year.
While harsher penalties were
imposed on the wholesalers, more than
450 retailers across the state have also
been fined for accepting the free goods
or rebates.
