## Third New Particle Found? 
### DON COX 
Physicists at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) have
uncovered evidence for the possible
existence of a third, unexpected
sub-atomic particle similar to the two
"psi" particles discovered at SLAC
two months ago, it was announced
Saturday.
Evidence of the new particle
emerged following a reexamination of
data from experiments in which
production of the two psi particles was
observed, SLAC Prof. Burton Richter
said.
The new particle was produced by
colliding beams of electrons and
positrons and exhibits the same
unusually heavy mass and electric
neutrality as the psi particles. The new
particle apparently has a much briefer
lifetime than the other two, Richter
said.
Richter headed a team of SLAC
physicists that worked with a group
from the University of California's
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in the
experiments. Theoretical physicists
have yet to explain the first two
unpredicted psi particles. Whereas the
two psi particles produced sharp peaks
in the experimental data, the new
"bump" in the data which suggests the
presence of a new particle is much
broader and much smaller.
Other Possibilities
"Whether it is a particle or not is
difficult to say. The most likely
explanation is that it is another
particle, but you can't exclude other
possibilities," said Richter.
But even if it isn't another particle,
he said, "the other possibilities are
very exciting."
Richter explained that the bump in
the data could represent either a
particle or a "threshold" beyond
which production of new particles
might be possible.
The new find was observed at an
energy of 4.1 billion electron volts.
The first and second psi particles were
found at energies of 3.1 and 3.7
electron volts respectively.
The new bump was masked in the

original data by high energy "tails"
from the two psi particles, and by
error.
"When we stripped away the high
energy tails of the two particles and
reduced the error by a factor of two,
all of a sudden we were left with this
thing sticking out," said Richter.
Additional energy scans after the
discovery of the second particle have
almost ruled out the possibility of any
more psi-like peaks in the data in this
energy region, he said.
"The real question is whether this
third particle is one of the same family
as the first two," he said.
One of the theories advanced to
explain the existence of the two new
psi particles was that they exhibited
behavior attributable to a fourth
"quark" in the nucleus. Until the

discovery, physicists believed there
were three quarks.
Leading Theory
If the theory is correct, then this
new quark, called a "charmed" quark,
should combine with the other three
quarks to produce a variety of heavy
particles. Unlike the two psi particles,
some of these heavy particles would be
electrically charged and all would
outwardly display charm. The SLAC
teams' new bump in the data might
mark the threshold beyond which
production of these charmed particles
is possible, Richter said.
"The charmed particle theory is the
leading candidate to explain what's
going on," said Richter. "There are a
lot of people looking for these
charmed particles. If they don't find
any, then the theory is wrong," he
said.

NEW PARTICLE DISCOVERED?—SLAC Prof. Burton Richter and a team of
physicists may have found a third sub-atomic particle. The new particle
apparently has a briefer lifetime than the other two, Richter said.
