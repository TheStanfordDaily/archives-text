# Judge Orders University To Justify Parking Fee
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
Four defendants, including
University President Richard Lyman,
have been ordered to show cause why
a superior court judge should not issue
a restraining order against ticketing of
vehicles not bearing the University's
$7.50 parking stickers.
Attorneys for the ASSU and the
Escondido Village Council filed a
complaint Friday in Santa Clara
County Superior Court asking for the
order.
Defendants in the case are Lyman,
the University Board of Trustees,
Santa Clara County Sheriff James B.
Geary and the county Board of
Supervisors. They have been ordered
to appear in court Wednesday to
contest an issuance of the order.
ASSU Involved
Plaintiffs in the suit are the ASSU;
Kathleen Colson, individually and on
behalf of all Escondido Village
residents; and Tom Dery, individually
and on behalf of all Stanford students
operating vehicles on campus.
The suit charges that the $7.50
student fee for the mandatory stickers
is comparable to a tax, with revenues
going into general unrestricted funds,
rather than for street maintenance and
police and fire protection. It further
calls the fee an unlawful use of police
power to impose and collect an illegal

tax.
The plaintiffs allege that because
the fee is an "assertion of power
beyond and in excess of that delegated
to them [the defendants] in the
[state] Vehicle Code," the parking fee
is both unconstitutional and invalid.
Staff and faculty are not required to
pay for their parking stickers.
The University is a'so charged with
abusing the Vehicle Code for its own
interests.
Plaintiffs' Contention
The plaintiffs claim that the rental
agreement for Escondido Village
guarantees a parking space for
residents, who, therefore "should not
be cited for exercising their
contractual rights to park in their
assigned parking spaces."
The suit is asking that the
University be enjoined from ticketing
student vehicles without parking
stickers, from collecting the student
registration fee, and from interfering
with the plaintiffs' use of assigned
parking spaces in Escondido Village. It
also asks for a judgment declaring the
parking fee unconstitutional and
invalid.
The show-cause hearing is set for
Wednesday at 9 a.m. in the North
County courthouse in Palo Alto. Judge
Paul T. Gallagher will preside over the
case.
