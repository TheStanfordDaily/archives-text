# Emergency Oil Cost $19,000 Extra
## PG&E Withholds Campus Gas 
### LINDA GRIBBIN 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E) withheld its supply
of natural gas to the University last week for approximately
50 hours, according to Jason Mavis, director of Plant
Services.
Use of heating oil from an emergency supply cost the
University over $19,000, Mavis said.
PG&E withheld the natural gas from major customers in
an effort to assure adequate home heating in frost-bitten
Northern and Central California.
PG&E requires its interruptible customers to have
contingency plans in case of curtailment. Most of them rely
on oil as the standby fuel.
Interruptible Service
All large users are "interruptible customers," Mavis
explained. "People don't always understand that we don't
have any choice. Given our druthers we would probably
rather pay a higher rate | for natural gas] and not have to
buy oil because of its outlandish price," he said.
Mavis pointed out that burning fuel oil on any given day
costs the University four times more than natural gas. The
additional cost averages $6500 a day, but depends on the
temperature and the rate at which the oil is burned.
The University used its oil reserve from 10:30 p.m.

Monday, until 10 a.m. Wednesday, and again Friday from 4
p.m. until Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
"We have some 550,000 gallons of oil on reserve," Mavis
said. "At our normal rate it will last about 25 days, or 20
days in cold weather."
The University woald cut back on services as a
conservation measure if forced to use its reserve supply
longer than two days, Mavis said. "Our primary
responsibility is to see that there is sufficient heat for the
hospital and student housing."
No Oil Shortage
Mavis also indicated that at present there is no shortage
of oil. "There is oil out there to buy," he said.
"In my experience our longest period on reserve oil was
36 hours," Mavis said. "If there was a long cold spell or a
major storm it could go on for days."
PG&E's natural gas supplies from the Southwest have
been curtailed on orders from the Federal Power
Commission, worsening the shortage.
Meanwhile, the utility company announced plans to
spend about $3 billion over the next four years to build
"facilities necessary to maintain reliable utility service" in
Northern and Central California.
