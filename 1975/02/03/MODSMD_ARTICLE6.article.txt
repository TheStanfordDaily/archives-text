## Cut Off Viet Aid 
### 
The Ford Administration has recently asked Congress to approve
$300 million in military aid to South Vietnam, in addition to the
$700 million Congress has already appropriated this fiscal year for the
support of the South Vietnamese government.
The Daily opposes this request for military aid. We urge the House
Appropriations Committee, and Congress as a whole, to reject this and
all subsequent requests for military and economic aid to South
Vietnam.
The State and Defense Departments have begun a publicity
campaign designed to show that, without the $300 million in aid, the
Thieu regime may not have enough supplies to withstand a major
North Vietnamese offensive.
U.S. government officials say that, because of troop movements
and increased military activity, they believe such an attack may take
place within six months. If the U.S. gives the Thieu government
enough ammunition to withstand this attack, the officials argue, then
South Vietnam will soon be strong enough to support itself without
U.S. aid.
We find this argument unconvincing. The Johnson Administration
also used to say, "Just a little more money, just a few more troops,
and we'll win this war."
A dozen years and hundreds of thousands of lives later, the
argument sounds hollow. It would be tragic if the U.S. failed to learn
the lesson of Vietnam â€” that dollars to corrupt dictatorships do not
produce peace.
We realize that if all aid to South Vietnam is cut off, the South
Vietnamese government will most likely collapse, but the Thieu
regime long ago proved itself unworthy of our support.
Some may argue that the United States should continue supplying
South Vietnam with money for needed food and medicine. We
believe, however, that given the propensity of the South Vietnamese
government to misappropriate all aid, even this support should be cut
off until it is shown that Thieu will spend the money properly.
We find it ironic that at this time, when the government makes a
pretense of fiscal responsibility, it could spend its scarce dollars in
such an irresponsible way.
Some might say that the fall of the Thieu regime would mean that
Americans killed in Vietnam died in vain. However, we believe they
have already died for an unworthy cause.
Let us not compound our error and increase our guilt by supplying
the means through which countless more Vietnamese will be led to
the grave.
