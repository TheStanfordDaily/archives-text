# U.S. Irks Greeks
## Michael Waterman

The last several months of
1974 witnessed an outburst of
a nt i-American sentiment
expressed by the Greek people.
For many Americans, this
demonstration of hostility was,
and still is today, difficult to
comprehend. For some time the
United States has maintained
close and friendly ties with
Greece. Ever since the Truman
Doctrine was announced in 1947,
leading to U.S. assistance in the
civil war against the Communists,
the Greeks have generally looked
upon the United States as their
ally and protector.
But when a civilian government
headed by Premier Constantine
Karamanlis unexpectedly replaced
the eight month old loannides
military regime in late July, a
torrent of animosity towards the
U.S. surfaced. An immediate
explanation for these feelings is to
be found in the Greek appraisal of
U.S. policy during the initial
stages of the Cyprus crisis.
Most Greeks believe that the
U.S. and the other Western
nations could have prevented the
whole bloody affair by standing
by Archbishop Makarios, the
Cypriot president ousted by the
Greek junta, or failing that by
discouraging the Turks from
invading the island in which they
now hold a dominant position.
U.S. Supported Dictators
A much more visceral reason
for the recent Greek rage against
the United States lies in America's
having propped up the oppressive
and incompetent military
dictatorship of Colonel Georgios
Papadopoulos and his successor,
Phaidon Gizikis, for the last seven
years.
This outpouring of
anti-American feeling is
potentially quite harmful to U.S.

interests in the Mediterranean.
Not long after Karamanlis took
the premiership he decided to pull
Greece out of military
participation in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
Now the Karamanlis
government is threatening to close
down U.S. military installations in
Greece. The U.S. maintains
homeport facilities for its Sixth
Fleet in Athens, several air
stations on the island of Crete, an
important air base near the
capital, and a number of
installations throughout Greece
where tactical nuclear weapons
are deployed.
Sad Irony
The sad irony in all of this is
that U.S.-Greek relations have not
fared well since democracy was
restored to Greece. Actually the
seemingly stable relation which
existed between the two countries
in the past few years was nothing
but a veneer created by a group of
ambitious colonels and generals.
The Greek people have been
deeply angered by American
policy towards their country.
They regarded America's
imprimatur of the junta's rule to
have been the chief obstacle to
democratic reform of the
government and the return of
basic freedoms to the people.
This anger has only now
become apparent to most
Americans through the Greek
protests of late 1974 and the
actions of the popular Karamanlis
administration. It is quite possible
that this present rift in U.S.-Greek
relations would not have occurred
had the U.S. not sanctioned a
cruel regime that lacked the
support of the people.
