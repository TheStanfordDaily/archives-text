# Palestinians Merit Sovereign Nation

In Aharon Shenhar's article(Daily, Jan. 22)
entitled "Israel, the PLO and History,"
Shenhar claims that the Arab governments
are doing very little to help the Palestinians,
and in a sense he is right, that the
Arabs should have done more to alleviate the
hardships that the Palestinians are suffering.
However, it will be an oversimplification
of the problem to claim, as Shenhar did, that
the solution of the conflict is for the Arab
states to accept the Palestinians as citizens.
This is the standard argument that has always
been advanced by the Zionists to evade their
responsibility towards the Palestinians. This
argument is fallacious.
First, Shenhar overlooks the fact that the
Palestinians are not merely refugees looking
for a country where they can settle, but a
political community with national aspiration.
They certainly have a lot in common with
other Arabs, but they also have a profound
appreciation of their own culture which has
distinct regional characteristics.
Tenacious Vows
Their determination to return to their
homeland is unshakable and the facts show
that it did not diminish over time. Plans for
resettlement in some Arab countries have
failed. Even those who opted for the
nationality of their host countries did so not
because they gave up the idea of return, but
merely for economic reasons. As a matter of
fact, "the wishes of the refugees themselves,

not of the politicians, determine the real
Arab stand on the Palestine question." (A.L.
Tibawi, The Middle East Journal, Autumn
1963).
Second, Shenhar ignores the fact that the
largest component of the Palestinian refugees
are former peasants who are deeply attached
to their land and their social environment.
Their displacement by the Zionists has only
sharpened their feelings and made them
resent any idea of integration in other Arab
countries. Thus, while it was possible for the
Zionists to choose among alternatives to
create the state of Israel (Uganda, Argentina,
Palestine, etc.), for the Palestinians there is
only one homeland and that is Palestine.
PLO Isn't Terrorist
To understand these fundamental facts is
very important if we want to achieve a
peaceful solution in the Middle East. It
certainly does not help the situation to refuse
to talk to the PLO on the grounds that they
are "terrorists." Terrorism, unlike what
Shenhar claims, was brought to the Middle
East by the Zionists and continues to be a
part of the life of the people there because of
the Israelis' refusal to accept the Palestinians.
To give only one example, on April 9, 1948,
Zionist troops attacked the village of Deir
Yasin and massacred 254 men, women and
children. Loudspeakers and trucks were used
to warn other Palestinians in other town to

flee, otherwise "the fate of Deir Yasin will be
yours."
Massacre Necessary
This planned and carefully executed
massacre was deemed a necessary' step for the
foundation of Israel. Thus Menachem Begin,
who was the leader of the execution and who
later became an Israeli cabinet minister
explicitly stated: "The massacre was not only
justified, but there would not have been a
state of Israel without the victory of Deir
Yasin."
Military expansion brought about many
more massacres: 1956-Kafr Qassin;
1967-Beit Nuba, Kahn Unis, etc., the purpose
of which was to induce the native population
to flee the country. Thousands of people
were assassinated and many more were
forced to leave their homes at gunpoint. It is
the policy of terror which helped the Zionist
occupy most of the Palestinian land. This
hardly agrees with the Shenhar statement
that "the Israeli government asked them [the
Palestinians] to stay."
It is not hard to understand why many
Israelis over-react to any solution that does
not give them complete certainty about their
future, but it is important for them to realize
that the key to the solution in the Middle
East is in dealing with the grievances of the
native Palestinians.

the solution of the conflict is for the Arab
states to accept the Palestinians as citizens.
This is the standard argument that has always
been advanced by the Zionists to evade their
responsibility towards the Palestinians. This
argument is fallacious.
First, Shenhar overlooks the fact that the
Palestinians are not merely refugees looking
for a country where they can settle, but a
political community with national aspiration.
They certainly have a lot in common with
other Arabs, but they also have a profound
appreciation of their own culture which has
distinct regional characteristics.
Tenacious Vows
Their determination to return to their
homeland is unshakable and the facts show
that it did not diminish over time. Plans for
resettlement in some Arab countries have
failed. Even those who opted for the
nationality of their host countries did so not
because they gave up the idea of return, but
merely for economic reasons. As a matter of
fact, "the wishes of the refugees themselves,

not of the politicians, determine the real
Arab stand on the Palestine question." (A.L.
Tibawi, The Middle East Journal, Autumn
1963).
Second, Shenhar ignores the fact that the
largest component of the Palestinian refugees
are former peasants who are deeply attached
to their land and their social environment.
Their displacement by the Zionists has only
sharpened their feelings and made them
resent any idea of integration in other Arab
countries. Thus, while it was possible for the
Zionists to choose among alternatives to
create the state of Israel (Uganda, Argentina,
Palestine, etc.), for the Palestinians there is
only one homeland and that is Palestine.
PLO Isn't Terrorist
To understand these fundamental facts is
very important if we want to achieve a
peaceful solution in the Middle East. It
certainly does not help the situation to refuse
to talk to the PLO on the grounds that they
are "terrorists." Terrorism, unlike what
Shenhar claims, was brought to the Middle
East by the Zionists and continues to be a
part of the life of the people there because of
the Israelis' refusal to accept the Palestinians.
To give only one example, on April 9, 1948,
Zionist troops attacked the village of Deir
Yasin and massacred 254 men, women and
children. Loudspeakers and trucks were used
to warn other Palestinians in other town to

flee, otherwise "the fate of Deir Yasin will be
yours."
Massacre Necessary
This planned and carefully executed
massacre was deemed a necessary' step for the
foundation of Israel. Thus Menachem Begin,
who was the leader of the execution and who
later became an Israeli cabinet minister
explicitly stated: "The massacre was not only
justified, but there would not have been a
state of Israel without the victory of Deir
Yasin."
Military expansion brought about many
more massacres: 1956-Kafr Qassin;
1967-Beit Nuba, Kahn Unis, etc., the purpose
of which was to induce the native population
to flee the country. Thousands of people
were assassinated and many more were
forced to leave their homes at gunpoint. It is
the policy of terror which helped the Zionist
occupy most of the Palestinian land. This
hardly agrees with the Shenhar statement
that "the Israeli government asked them [the
Palestinians] to stay."
It is not hard to understand why many
Israelis over-react to any solution that does
not give them complete certainty about their
future, but it is important for them to realize
that the key to the solution in the Middle
East is in dealing with the grievances of the
native Palestinians.

economics.)
In Aharon Shenhar's article(Daily, Jan. 22)
entitled "Israel, the PLO and History,"
Shenhar claims that the Arab governments
are doing very little to help the Palestinians,
and in a sense he is right, that the
Arabs should have done more to alleviate the
hardships that the Palestinians are suffering.
However, it will be an oversimplification
of the problem to claim, as Shenhar did, that
the solution of the conflict is for the Arab
states to accept the Palestinians as citizens.
This is the standard argument that has always
been advanced by the Zionists to evade their
