# Acoustic Microscope Probes Living Cells
## 
### JAN PEPPER 
A scanning acoustic microscope
that uses ultrahigh-frequency sound
waves to see into living cells and other
materials has been recently developed
by Applied Physics Prof. Calvin F.
Quate and Dr. Ross Lemons, a
research associate at the Hansen
Laboratories.
The device, generates ultrasonic
waves of 500 to 1000 Mhz (half a
billion to a billion per second) to
resolve details as tiny as one micron in
diameter (about 40 millionths of an
inch).
"It can be used in medical research
to obtain information impossible to
receive with the optical microscope,"
said Quate. "It will compliment the
uses of the optical microscope, which
will help pathologists in si eening in
areas of detail."
Specimens Mounted On Film
The specimen to be examined is
mounted on a thin plastic film held in
water between two sapphire crystal
rods, one of which transmits the sound
waves while the other receives them.
The ends of the rods are ground in a
concave form and this, together with a
drop of water held between them,
serves to focus the beam of ultrasound
to a fine point where it meets the
specimen.
The crystal rod receiver picks up
the ultrasonic waves after they have
passed through the specimen. A
transducer converts the modified
waves into an electrical signal that can
be used to display a picture of the
specimen on a television screen.
"With the acoustic microscope, we
can observe the elastic properties,
which are different than what can be
observed with the optical
microscope," said Quate.
Plastic Properties
"When the cell beam goes through,
the sound acts as a compressional wave
that alternately compresses the
substance to show its elastic
properties," said Lemons. 'The sound
can be delayed, shifted in phase, and
changed in amplitude."

The resolution is fine enough to
study human cells, which "may find
uses both in clinical situations like
hospitals and in institutions engaged in
biological research," continued
Lemons.
It may also prove useful in
searching out flaws in such
manufacturing items as
semiconductors and integrated
circuits.
Lemons and Quate have been
developing this particular version of
the instrument for over a year. A
license agreement for commercial
development of the acoustic scanning
microscope has been signed with
Stanford by the American Optical
Company of Buffalo, N.Y.

substance to show its elastic
properties," said Lemons. 'The sound
can be delayed, shifted in phase, and
changed in amplitude."

The resolution is fine enough to
study human cells, which "may find
uses both in clinical situations like
hospitals and in institutions engaged in
biological research," continued
Lemons.
It may also prove useful in
searching out flaws in such
manufacturing items as
semiconductors and integrated
circuits.
Lemons and Quate have been
developing this particular version of
the instrument for over a year. A
license agreement for commercial
development of the acoustic scanning
microscope has been signed with
Stanford by the American Optical
Company of Buffalo, N.Y.

NEW DISCOVERY—'This scanning acoustic microscope uses ultrahigh-frequency
sound waves to see into living cells. The device can be used to obtain
information impossible to receive with the optic microscope.
A scanning acoustic microscope
that uses ultrahigh-frequency sound
waves to see into living cells and other
materials has been recently developed
by Applied Physics Prof. Calvin F.
Quate and Dr. Ross Lemons, a
research associate at the Hansen
Laboratories.
The device, generates ultrasonic
waves of 500 to 1000 Mhz (half a
billion to a billion per second) to
resolve details as tiny as one micron in
diameter (about 40 millionths of an
inch).
"It can be used in medical research
to obtain information impossible to
receive with the optical microscope,"
said Quate. "It will compliment the
uses of the optical microscope, which
will help pathologists in si eening in
areas of detail."
Specimens Mounted On Film
The specimen to be examined is
mounted on a thin plastic film held in
water between two sapphire crystal
rods, one of which transmits the sound
waves while the other receives them.
The ends of the rods are ground in a
concave form and this, together with a
drop of water held between them,
serves to focus the beam of ultrasound
to a fine point where it meets the
specimen.
The crystal rod receiver picks up
the ultrasonic waves after they have
passed through the specimen. A
transducer converts the modified
waves into an electrical signal that can
be used to display a picture of the
specimen on a television screen.
"With the acoustic microscope, we
can observe the elastic properties,
which are different than what can be
observed with the optical
microscope," said Quate.
Plastic Properties
"When the cell beam goes through,
the sound acts as a compressional wave
that alternately compresses the
substance to show its elastic
properties," said Lemons. 'The sound
can be delayed, shifted in phase, and
changed in amplitude."

The resolution is fine enough to
study human cells, which "may find
uses both in clinical situations like
hospitals and in institutions engaged in
biological research," continued
Lemons.
It may also prove useful in
searching out flaws in such
manufacturing items as
semiconductors and integrated
circuits.
