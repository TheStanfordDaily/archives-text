# Ticketing Aggravates Parking Crisis
## John Freed 
### 
The recent ticketing Blitzkrieg against
student parkers by the University's Public
Safety Department has stirred up some
controversy.
First, the Escondido Village Council urged
students, faculty and staff to boycott the
recently imposed $7.50 parking fee. Then the
ASSU Senate voted unanimously to support
the boycott. And, most recently, both groups
have taken the University to court to stop
the ticketing.
A bit of history will serve to explain the
problem.
SWOPSI Report
In May 1973, a SWOPSI group released
"Stanford—A Colossus without Roads," a
report calling for:
—improved bicycle paths on University
land;
—a flat $20 parking fee for faculty and
students;
—a sliding-scale fee for staff members,
depending on salary.
The authors of the report felt the
University was acting "irresponsibly" on the
parking matter. Central-campus construction
was eating up parking areas, they reasoned,
so the University would have to either
construct new lots or discourage use of cars.
They recommended reduced use of cars.
No Action
The University took no action at all.
Of course, a commission was later
established to study the problem. Peter
Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs and the only commission
member, said last October that he would

report on the crisis by this February.
So, in a rare display of good public
relations, the Public Safety Department
suspended its customary $10 parking fee to
allow the University time to restructure its
parking permit policy, according to Capt.
William Wullschleger.
The student-only $10 fee had been
unusual in several respects. At many other
colleges, student parking fees were higher. Of
course, at many other colleges, faculty and
staff members also paid fees for parking.
Students had understandably been upset
over paying even $10 for the fee, however,
because they did not receive general parking
privileges upon payment. Suspension of this
vehicle ownership tax on students brought a
short-lived "era of good feelings."
Anti-'Blitzing' Argument
In early December, Herrington was
arguing (correctly) that "blitz ticketing"
would draw officers away from other places
where they were needed.
Unfortunately, Herrington was talking
about blitzing cars parked illegally between
Meyer Library and the Main Library — a spot
where staff members are notorious for
parking. Massive ticketing of staff members
would not financially benefit Herrington's
department — since staff members receive
parking decals free and fines are payable to
Santa Clara County.
Perhaps something clicked after that,
because Herrington then announced his
department would start issuing tickets to
student cars after Jan. 20. Giving tickets to
students would again do his department no
good ... but if students could be conned

ft
into buying parking stickers, the Public
Safety Department could substantially reduce
its budget cuts.
Hard-Nosed Opinions
As the department's arbitrary Jan. 20
"deadline" approached, Herrington started
espousing increasingly hard-nosed opinions
on blitz ticketing. He started out with almost
a lamenting tone during the first week of
January.
"I hate to see us write a lot of tickets," he
said as the ASSU Senate prepared to support
the parking ticket boycott.
Then leaflets started appearing on
windshields of cars warning of possible
consequences. Officers were seen taking
down license plate numbers of cars without
parking decals.
Abandons Pretensions
Finally, three days after the ticketing
began, Herrington had abandoned all
pretentions of concern over "blitzing."
"We're trying to cover the entire campus,"
he stated callously. "Then we'll just start
over again."
Little wonder in these budget-cutting days
that the Department should want to increase
its income by buffaloing students into buying
parking stickers. By palming off 1000 or
2000 decals, the Department of Public Safety
may yet avoid laying off an officer.
But by this move, the only "safety"
Herrington's cohorts are promoting is the
safety of their own jobs.
