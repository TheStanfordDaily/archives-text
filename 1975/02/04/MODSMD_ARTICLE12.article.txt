# Protest Viet Aid
## Rachelle Marshall 
### 
President Ford and Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger are
pressuring Congress for another
$300 million to support the Thieu
and Lon Nol regimes in Vietnam
and Cambodia. They reportedly
will ask for $1.3 billion next year.
None of this money will go
toward relieving the suffering of
the people of Indochina but is
intended only to keep two
unpopular dictators in power,
regardless of the cost in human
lives.
Anthony Lewis wrote in The
New York Times last week: "It is
quite clear that Henry Kissinger
would rather have Cambodia a salt
plain than let the war end on
terms that would expose to all the
monstrous futility of his policy.
But in history, responsibility rests
not only on individuals but on
societies. Are we prepared to
continue sharing with Kissinger
the responsibility for Orwellian
war in Cambodia and Vietnam?
Congress will decide."
Congress will decide, but in the
last analysis it is up to us. A year
ago, a flood of mail urging
impeachment proceedings against
Richard Nixon brought results.
Similar pressure on Congress now
could finally bring about peace in
Indochina. Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park)
agrees that mail should be sent to
members of the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees,
which will shortly begin hearings
on Ford's request.
I would like to urge students to
write to John J. McClellan
(D-Ark.), chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, or
George H. Mahon (D-Tex.),
chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee,
demanding the denial of aid to the
Thieu regime.
Students should also write to
California's three representatives
on the House committee: John J.
McFall, Edward Roybal and Burt
Talcott.
Writing a postcard or letter to a
congressman is not a heroic act,
but at this moment, it is the most
practical way to offer hope to the
people of Indochina. Peace is
literally in our hands.
