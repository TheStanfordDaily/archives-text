# Letters-Bomb Threat, Overseas Study, Chile
## 
### 
Commendable Actions
Editor:
The bomb threat last Tuesday
night at Memorial Auditorium
could have turned a "Trekkies'
dream" into disaster. It was only
through the assistance of a lot of
unusually capable people that the
tragedies usually associated with
overcrowding were avoided. I
would like to thank some of these
people.
I must first commend those
professionals who, though it was
their job to be there, deserve some
recognition for the responsibility
with which they handled a
potentially dangerous situation.
Much of the credit for the
smoothness of the evacuation and
search must go to Asst. Fire Chief
Frank Stolarik and his men; their
promptness in response to our
call, and their subsequent
direction of the evacuation, kept
the situation under control. Also
invaluable to the evacuation were
Officers Anthony Navarra and
Herman Williams of the Stanford
Police, who expertly handled a
sizable crowd.
But the situation could never
have been controlled were it not
for the staff of KZSU. At a time
when we were desperately short
of people to manage the entry of
the crowd after the alert, Mike
Lopez and Corey Boyan organized
a group of volunteers (largely
KZSU staffers) to guard the doors
and help us regulate the flow of
people. To the staff of KZSU, and
to all the other volunteers who
helped us at the Roddenberry
event (especially Ron Goss, who
was wounded in the line of duty),
the staff of the Speakers Bureau
gives its thanks.

ASSU Subsidizes Kids
Editor:
No one can condone a bomb
threat — it is a sick and
destructive thing. Nevertheless, I
don't think I have ever been as
upset at ASSU as when I was
turned away at the door of
Memorial Auditorium when I
attempted to see Gene
Roddenberry on Wednesday
night.
I pay money to the ASSU so
that it can provide activities for
me. I do not pay money to the
ASSU so that half of the high
school kids in Palo Alto can see
Roddenberry for free and in the
process deny me from seeing him.
The next time the ASSU
decides to donate funds to a
charity— like one for Palo Alto
kids — I hope a rebate will be
available.

Approaching Stanford
Editor:
Approaching Stanford 1975 is
a book being written for next
year's incoming freshmen. It will
contain valuable University
information that hopefully will
make the student's introduction
to Stanford less traumatic. The
four freshman editors, Sally
Ourieff, Peggy Means, Bruce Chan
and Pete Arnstein, would like to
encourage a greater participation
from the community-at-large in
the form of quotes, photographs
and artwork.
Comments and a worthwhile
criticism of organization and
layout of the book, the
University, the faculty, and
on-campus living and its problems
are welcome. For information call
Sheryl Kerner, 497-3622,
Undergraduate Studies Office.
All photography and artwork

must be in black and white and
express some facet of the
Stanford community or of
student life. Many of the
freshmen who will be looking at
this publication have never been
to Stanford. Desirable pictures are
those that, when combined with
the written contents of the book,
will create an objective view of
the University. Those
photographers and artists that
have pieces selected will be given
printed credit.
Another area of Approaching
Stanford, perhaps the one most
remembered, is the quotes that
occupy the margins of the book.
Prepared questionnaires may be
picked up at meal line counters or
at the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, Bldg. 1,
Rm. IC. Quotes will be taken
from these questionnaires and
from any comments received
separately by the Undergraduate
Studies Office. All contributions
should be received by
Undergraduate Studies by Feb.
21.

Reform Overseas Study
Editor:
With reference to the article
appearing in the Jan. 29 Daily on
the overseas program and
economy, everything possible
should be done to save
the program. When first
introduced, the undergraduate
program overseas truly
revolutionized education at
Stanford.
That it declined in its purpose
and lost much of its appeal can be
attributed to many factors, but
largely to changes in student life
style and academic interests, the
collapse of standards on the home
campus (grading, counseling, core

requirements), over-extension of
the system (Parkinson's Law?),
the loss of the "distinction"
element caused by "scraping the
barrel" to fill the empty billets,
and only lastly, to inflation and
the sinking of the dollar's
purchasing power.
Whatever the reason for the
program's floundering, it would
be a tragedy to eliminate it. We
should return to basics rather than
glossing over pedagogical
objectives with highfalutin'
verbiage. To make it a productive
undergraduate program and
financially self-sustaining, it must
become more meaningful.
Students should be prepared
for study abroad (10-20 units of
work in the chosen area coupled
with at least a rudimentary
knowledge of the pertinent
language) so that they will derive
the maximum benefit from a
unique experience abroad. The
"distinction" element and
principle of selectivity must be
restored. The program should be
reduced to three major language
areas — France, Italy, and
Austira/Germany. Let us salvage
the program by enhancing its
quality.

Chilean Deceit
Editor:
In a Jan. 30 letter to the Daily,
Carlos Matus, Chilean consul in
San Francisco, claims that
Hermann Schwember, invited as a
visiting scholar to Stanford, "has
been at liberty since Dec. 14,
1974."
I have been informed both by
the Department of State and
quasi-official sources in Santiago
that the Chilean government has
confirmed the re-arrest of
Schwember on Jan. 9 and the fact
that he is being held without
formal charges in the Los Alamos

detention center.
Either Matus has been
deliberately deceived by his own
government in this case, or he is
deliberately trying to deceive us.
Given the abominable record
of the current Chilean government
on all questions of human rights,
both explanations are entirely
plausible.

Obtuse Review?
Editor:
It is fortunate that reviews like
Joan Hinman's review of
"Journey's" concert (Daily, Jan.
28) often go unprinted. The
substitution of gut-level
appreciation for comments on
musicianship is not often allowed.
To consider the band to have
"overwhelming talents" is to
stretch beyond musical bounds.
Aynsley Dunbar is the only one
that could be considered to have
an excess of talent. If Hinman has
any idea about a rhythm section,
she would realize that the only
"driving" Ross Valory did was to
and from the concert. A driving
bass leads the drummer, and this
was obviously not the case.
Neal Schon is a good guitarist,
but still years behind the new
ideas in today's music. To call
Greg Rolie's keyboard work
talented is demeaning to a large
number of competent
professionals.
In short, if "Journey" is the
fastest-rising band in the west, the
west is ready to accept outdated,
lightweight music, where volume
has been substituted for musical
excitement. Opinions are to be
respected, but the critic must have
a musical foundation in order to
form a musical opinion. I suggest
this be taken into consideration in
the future.
