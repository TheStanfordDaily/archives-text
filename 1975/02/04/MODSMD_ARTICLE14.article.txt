## Masochism At Stanford Life Goes On For E.E. Pre-Meds 
### STEVE HEFTER 
By just looking at Bob Bryg
you would never know.
fie has normal black hair and
wears normal blue jeans. He's tall
and smiles with a full set of teeth.
And he even laughs and digests
bad jokes like the everyday
Stanford student.
But Bob Bryg is anything but
everyday. Unless everyday refers
to how often Bob does what he
does.
He describes it as "a pinch of
insanity, lots of masochism and
just plain weird."
Bob Bryg is a pre-med
engineer.
As if one were not difficult
enough, Bob has selected two of
Stanford's most rigorous majors
for his field of studious torture.
And what's even worse — so
has Llayne Rasmussen. They're
both majoring in electrical
engineering and fulfilling the
requirements of a pre-med.
"People look at us like we've
got two heads," Llayne admits.
"But actually — we're normal
human beings."
Bob joins in, "The typical
question is 'what's your major?'
But of course you never admit
you're pre-med.

"So you say you're an
electrical engineer. And then
somewhere along the line you say
you're planning to go to Med
School.
"People's reactions have been
everything from 'that's great' to
'you're kidding,' to 'you're
crazy.' "
They may be crazy but they
both manage to sleep, eat and
breathe like normal people. They
go out on weekends, attend dorm
meetings and even take an
occasional jog around campus.
Llayne admits to studying at
least four hours every night
"which doesn't include weekends
or daytime studying." During one

of his hours off he took time to
figure out how he was going to
complete his plans.
"If you add up distribution
requirements, minimum
requirements for electrical
engineering, and pre-med
requirements — it comes to 179
units," he says. "So you take your
one PE class and you graduate.
"You tell this to people and
they say, 'My gosh. So this is what
a real masochist looks like.' "
Together, the masochists have
recruited others like them and
have begun a pre-med engineering
club at Stanford.
One purpose of the club,
according to Bob, is to "find out

what there is to get into."
"One thing," Llayne adds, "is
'medical electronics.'
"The medical profession is
getting more sophisticated.
Doctors don't know enough about
their equipment. With what we're
studying we can apply our
knowledge to research in
improving things like artificial
limbs and EKG (electrocardio
gram) machines."
The unique study also gives
students a choice. "The one thing
about being an engineering major
as opposed to being a biology
major," according to Llayne, "is
that if you don't get into Med
School, you've got something to

fall back on."
Bob smiles. For a pre-med
engineer he smiles a lot.. "You
know,"he says,"I was a closet
pre-med for a long time. Some of
my best friends never even knew."
Almost in unison, they smile
and poke each other in the ribs.
They love it. It may not be easy.
But they love it.
