I went into The Store /at Tresidder] today
to buy some coffee. I had a coupon to get 23
cents off, which I thought might offset, in
my opinion, their exorbitant prices. I was
told by the cashier that "it's not The Store's
policy to accept coupons." Why? —P.C.
Calling The Store's prices "exorbitant" is
not exactly going out on a limb. For
example, a four-ounce jar of Maxim
free/e-dried coffee costs $1.93 at The Store.
The same jar would cost $1.59 at Purity
Market. However, Purity accepts coupons.
Therefore, the jar would actually cost $1.36
at Purity — a 57-cent savings.
Other comparisons: a 20-ounce box of
Tide costs 69 cents at The Store while the
same box is only 55 cents at Purity; a
one-half pound box of Ritz crackers is 79
cents at The Store, but a whole pound box
sells for 95 cents at Purity.
If you're looking for a bargain in Clorox, a
32-ounce bottle costs 44 cents at both places.
The Store's policy on coupons is indeed
puzzling. When asked why The Store does
not accept them, Manager Gary Ding said:
"Simple. We don't have the accounting
facilities to handle the paperwork involved.
It's not worth the problem."
Problems? Paperwork? "Bug Me" checked

with both the Town and Country Market and
Purity. Joanne Valentine, a cashier at Town
and Country, estimated that the store spends
about two nours a week processing coupons.
A spokesman for Purity said that it took
about half an hour per week.
The Purity spokesman said that the
process was "very, very simple." The store
counts all coupons and groups them
according to value. Then it multiplies the
values and computes the total. The coupons
do not have to be singled out by product.
A single form is then sent to a central
clearinghouse which refunds all the money.
The clearinghouse also gives the store two
cents for each coupon it receives and the
store usually breaks even on the coupons.
According to Ding, most small stores
don't accept coupons, although the Purity
spokesman was surprised by this. He said that
he had worked in several small stores and
that they all accepted coupons.
Will The Store change its policy? "Never,"
Ding said, "unless, of course, we become a
six million dollar store."
"Bug Me" said last quarter that UGLVs
windows were scheduled to be washed in
November. They still look dirty to me. What
happened? Were they ever washed? —B.Z.

We deceived you. The reachable UGLY
windows will be washed shortly, according to
Andy Anderson, manager of grounds and
custodial services. However, there are more
than 500 windows which aren't reachable.
These windows will probably never be
washed, Anderson said. In 1968, when they
were last washed, the window washers used a
65-foot wooden ladder. Now, a ladder of that
length is illegal and the University's only
alternative is to construct rigging on the side
of the building.
The rental, erecting, and dismantling of
the rigging would cost $8500, Anderson said.
On top of that, the washers charge $1600.
Therefore, it would cost about $10,000 to
wash the windows.
Anderson said that the University doesn't
have '.hat much in its window washing budget
for the whole campus, let alone the library.
Other possibilities included taking the
windows out to wash them or using a high
pressure hose to reach them. However, the
windows are sealed and would be very
difficult to take out. And the high pressure
hose would wash off the dirt, but not the
seven-year grime.
Luckily, all new University buildings are
being constructed with washable windows to
avoid this problem in the future.
