# Chamber Dance Company Lacks Style
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
Thursday night in Memorial
Auditorium the Seattle-based
First Chamber Dance Company
presented the first of its two
evening performances.
The First Chamber Company
was founded fifteen years ago
with the avowed intention of
providing audiences with a new
perspective on the dance. Instead
of the monostylistic approach
that typifies most dance
companies, the First Chamber
Dance Company endeavors to
include ethnic, modern, classical
and jazz works in its repertoire.
TTiis is an admirable and
potentially very valuable
objective, but unfortunately the
company falls short. What
resulted Thursday night was an
eclectic and uneven collection of
dances executed without any real
conviction or stylistic integrity.
This sort of "combination
plate" approach to dance may
have a place in a more provincial
city (dance-wise) like Seattle. But
in the Bay Area with so much of
the "real stuff' — American Ballet
Theatre, The San Francisco Ballet,
and Limon and Nikolais'

companies — one hungers for a
heartier repast.
Second-Rate Pavane
When you can see Limon's
company do the Moor's Pavane as
they did last week in San
Francisco, why suffer through the
Chamber Company's second-rate
version?
Even the San Francisco Ballet
Company dances a better
interpretation of Bournonville's
Flower Festival than Thursday
evening's opening version. The
Chamber Company's Flower
Festival laced the distinctiveness
and nuances of Bournonville's
styling that make his ballets more
than just another Romantic
revival.
Indulge In Excess
Limon's Moor's Pavane
suffered from the same weak and
superficial approach. One of the
great strengths of Limon's
choreography is his power of
understatement and restraint.
However, in Thursday's
performance both lago and
Othello indulged in emotional
excesses that robbed the dance of
much of its force.
Part of the difficulty stemmed

from the fact that Frank Byas
simply lacks the stature and
dominating presence required for
a convincing Othello. Flemming
Halby too failed to immerse
himself in the septic character of
Iago: he always seemed more
concerned with how he looked
than how he moved.
The remaining three works
performed were all choreographed
by Charles Bennett, the
Company's Artistic Director.
Nagare, a series of three solos
based on haiku poems, consisted
of delicate gestures and postures
reminiscent of Japanese ink
drawings.
Haunting Image
All three soloists performed
with a subtlety and understanding
that left a haunting image long
after one's memories of the other
dances faded.
Bennett's other dance,
Albinoni Adagio, failed for
precisely those reasons that
Nagare succeeded. In Albinoni
Adagio what should have been a
passionate lover's duet became
instead a mechanical exercise in

patterning.
Although they were technically
proficient, both Marlene Jones
and Douglas Hevenor retained an
air of uncertainty and anticipation
that made their unison moves
appear unnecessarily strained and
tense. Their obvious
preoccupation with exact timing
limited their capacity to simply
let go and dance.
The final dance of the evening,
Take Seven—Roll 'em, was an
embarassing attempt at a dance
version of the current
Hollywood-nostalgia theme. It
had little, if anything, to do with
dance, relying instead upon
obvious and poorly mouthed
singing, clumsy antics and
awkward imitations of Hollywood
personalities.
It was trite and cliched and, by
this reviewer's standards,
exceedingly unfunny. Its only
possible redeeming feature was
that it afforded audiences an
opportunity to laugh at dancers,
which in itself is a questionable
practice.
