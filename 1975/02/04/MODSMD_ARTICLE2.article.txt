# Ford Sends Record Budget To Congress
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A 1976
budget containing a record peacetime
deficit of $52 billion and projecting
high unemployment through 1979 was
sent to Congress yesterday by
President Ford.
"From all Americans we must ask
for perserverance and a willingness to
tolerate some painful measures
necessary to restore good economic
health," the President said in a
statement.
The budget's outlook for
unemployment was especially grim —
an average 8.1 percent this year, 7.9
percent next year, and remaining
above six percent of the labor force
until 1980.
Inflation also will remain high in
the immediate future, averaging 11.3
percent this year and 7.8 percent next
year, according to the budget. The
nation's economy will plunge 3.3
percent overall this year, compared
with 2.2 percent last year.
Total Outlays
Total budget outlays for the year
beginning July 1 are projected at
$349.4 billion, up from $313.4 billion
in 1975, and receipts are estimated at
$297.5 billion, compared with $278.8
billion this year.
Ford proposed increased spending
for defense, unemployment aid and
energy research, but asked Congress to
cut other spending by $17 billion.
The reaction from Congress was
cautious at best, and highly critical at
worst.
Chairman George H. Mahon
(D-Texas) of the House
Appropriations Committee said major
questions are still to be answered on
whether the budget will be adequate
to stimulate the economy and whether
it might increase inflation.
'Highly Doubtful'
Chairman A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.) of
the House Ways and Means Committee
said he was "highly doubtful" that
Congress would vote higher defense
spending or approve the $17 billion in
spending cuts.
Ford said at the White House that
he believes the recession will end at
mid-year and that the economy should
be increasing at a five percent annual rate
by the end of 1976.
He also said that consumer prices
will increase slightly more than nine
percent overall in 1975, down from
12.2 percent last year.
Ford's budget projects a 11.3
percent increase in consumer prices

this year, as measured at an average
annual rate, while Ford talked
spearately of a nine percent increase,
measuring December, 1976 prices.
"While these projected figures
present no rosy picture, they forecast
the real improvement we expect in the
coming months..." Ford said.
He said his budget and a separate
economic report to be released
Tuesday are "the plain truth."
"The figures used are honest and
conservative — and we hope to do
better than the forecast," he said.
"We're not going to get an upsurge
in business — there's not even a
prospect for that" said James L. Pate,
assistant secretary of commerce for
economic affairs.

he believes the recession will end at
mid-year and that the economy should
be increasing at a five percent annual rate
by the end of 1976.
He also said that consumer prices
will increase slightly more than nine
percent overall in 1975, down from
12.2 percent last year.
Ford's budget projects a 11.3
percent increase in consumer prices

this year, as measured at an average
annual rate, while Ford talked
spearately of a nine percent increase,
measuring December, 1976 prices.
"While these projected figures
present no rosy picture, they forecast
the real improvement we expect in the
coming months..." Ford said.
He said his budget and a separate
economic report to be released
Tuesday are "the plain truth."
"The figures used are honest and
conservative — and we hope to do
better than the forecast," he said.
"We're not going to get an upsurge
in business — there's not even a
prospect for that" said James L. Pate,
assistant secretary of commerce for
economic affairs.
WASHINGTON (AP) - A 1976
budget containing a record peacetime
deficit of $52 billion and projecting
high unemployment through 1979 was
sent to Congress yesterday by
President Ford.
"From all Americans we must ask
for perserverance and a willingness to
tolerate some painful measures
necessary to restore good economic
health," the President said in a
statement.
The budget's outlook for
unemployment was especially grim —
an average 8.1 percent this year, 7.9
percent next year, and remaining
above six percent of the labor force
until 1980.
Inflation also will remain high in
the immediate future, averaging 11.3
percent this year and 7.8 percent next
year, according to the budget. The
nation's economy will plunge 3.3
percent overall this year, compared
with 2.2 percent last year.
Total Outlays
Total budget outlays for the year
beginning July 1 are projected at
$349.4 billion, up from $313.4 billion
in 1975, and receipts are estimated at
$297.5 billion, compared with $278.8
billion this year.
Ford proposed increased spending
for defense, unemployment aid and
energy research, but asked Congress to
cut other spending by $17 billion.
The reaction from Congress was
cautious at best, and highly critical at
worst.
Chairman George H. Mahon
(D-Texas) of the House
Appropriations Committee said major
questions are still to be answered on
whether the budget will be adequate
to stimulate the economy and whether
it might increase inflation.
'Highly Doubtful'
Chairman A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.) of
the House Ways and Means Committee
said he was "highly doubtful" that
Congress would vote higher defense
spending or approve the $17 billion in
spending cuts.
Ford said at the White House that
he believes the recession will end at
mid-year and that the economy should
be increasing at a five percent annual rate
