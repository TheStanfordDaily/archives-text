## World Music: Gaining Acceptance 
### Dave Smith 
Although Stanford is not yet
among them, many colleges and
universities have recognized in
recent years that they cannot
afford to ignore fnusic outside the
familiar . European classical
tradition.
Schools of World Music and
Ethnomusicology (the study of
music as cultural tradition) have
existed in the United States for
many years, and in large
departments and schools of music,
at places like Illinois and
Michigan, professors interested in
a certain branch of world muoic
have sometimes taught courses in
it.
More modestly-staffed (and
funded) music departments,
though, are also adding courses in
non-Western music; thus Yale,
Columbia, and Princeton now

have course series in "Music of the
World's Peoples."
And the non- European classical
form that is probably the most
important music to emerge from
this country — jazz music — is no
longer confined to a few
traditionally interested places, like
North Texas State, but is now
represented, at least with
introductory courses, at many
institutions.
Dartmouth Program
Prof. Bill Cole of Dartmouth
College has developed a program
in world music that shows what
can be done at a small school in a
field that many larger institutions
still choose to overlook.
Cole, author of a recent book
on Miles Davis, teaches a
four-quarter series (in which any
of the four courses may be taken
separately) covering folk music of
every continent from African to
Native American to European
Folk music.
Coltrane Course
African-American (jazz) music,
Cole's specialty, is represented by
a course in "Theory of
African-American Music" and a
seminar on the music of
saxophonist Coltrane: "A course I
believe is the only one of its kind
in the country," says Cole.
One of the most commendable
aspects of Cole's program is his
directing a John Coltrane
Memorial World Music Series of
concerts and lectures, which has
presented at Dartmouth such
superb performers as pianist
McCoy Tyner and saxophonists
Archie Shepp and Sam Rivers
(who was featured two weeks ago
with the San Francisco
Symphony).

In this way not only is Cole
presenting his students with some
of the most important examples
of the performers about whom he
teaches, but he and Dartmouth
are also helping to support some
of America's most creative and
under-endowed artists.
Stanford Chances
What are the chances that a
program in world music or
courses in jazz will come to
Stanford? According to Music
Department Chairman Albert
Cohen, who says he has been
pushing for the addition of a chair
in world music since he took his
post in fall 1973, there are several
obstacles to the music
department's broadening its scope
in the next few years.
"We've been fighting to
maintain the faculty we have
now," he says. "We will probably
be losing one position next year,
so there's very little chance of a
new appointment of a full-time
professor in the next year or
two."
Cohen says the most likely
candidate to teach a world music
series would be a "person who
very luckily happened to be in the
area" and whom the University
could hire on a short-term basis —
a person like composer Lou
Ha-rison, who has taught theory
as a visiting lecturer this year.
Teacher-Performer
"The person who taught a
world music series would have to
be a very special one," Cohen
adds. "He would have to be both
a good teacher and a skilled
performer to create the
maximum interest in his subject.
"Then if he was that good and
the word got around that his was

an excellent and popular course,
the deans might be more
persuaded to create funding for a
full-time world music position,"
the music department head states.
Jazz Possiblity
And what of the possibility
that jazz music, a hugely
important facet of American
culture, will be taught in a music
department framework?
"I'd like to see jazz taught as a
major part of a course on
American music, a course which I
think would work best as part of
an interdisciplinary series on
American culture," says Cohen.
"In teaching American music
we must be careful to approach it
as the expression of a certain
people in a certain culture, not to
compare it with the European
tradition," he says, "because as a
branch of the European tradition
overall it just isn't of as high a
quality."
Cole attaches more urgency to
the broadening of the music
curriculum when he says, "when
everyone is functioning in the
European classical tradition, in
my opinion that's racism. Not
only racism but a very severe and
arbitrary class bias."
Like all long-standing
inequities, this is a hard one to
overcome. But it can only be
self-perpetuating unless the first
steps are taken to make people
aware that world music is classical
music, too.
