Hearst Spotted In L.A.?
LOS ANGELES — The FBI said here last night it had
ceased actively investigating a report that newspaper heiress
Patricia Hearst and two other women had kidnaped a man
in Hollywood and forced him to drive in circles for 40
minutes.
The incident, first reported by San Francisco television
newswoman Marilyn Baker, involved a man identified as
Edward Carr who told police he was picked up last Friday
by three women and forced at gunpoint to drive around the
Hollywood area before he was released.
"The FBI has talked to him and based on the
information he was furnished regarding the sighting of
Patricia Hearst, we are unable to confirm the information
and are conducting no additional investigation regarding the
incident," the agency said.
Police all but discounted the incident too.
"We are treating it the same as all other 760 sightings
and are making every effort to determine if what Carr says
is true," said Cmdr. Pete Hagan of the Los Angeles Police
Department.
Carr told the newswoman in a taped broadcast that "it
looked like the real Patty Hearst. In my estimation it was
her. There is no doubt in my mind about it."
Kissinger Proposes Priee Floor
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
today proposed setting a price floor for oil production
throughout the world to insure development of new energy
sources.
In a speech to the National Press Club, Kissinger said this
support system will set the price lower than the current
level of about $11 a barrel, but considerably higher than
the $3-a-barrel figure paid before the oil crisis broke out a
year and one-half ago.
He explained that the American-led effort to conserve
on the use of imported oil and to develop new sources of
energy threatens to drive down the price of petroleum
products in the next few years.
S.J. Radio Stations Bombed
SAN JOSE — A powerful explosion ripped out walls,
collapsed a ceiling and did extensive damage yesterday to a
building that houses three radio stations and an office of
General Motors Acceptance Corp., police said.
Officers said no one was reported injured, though several
persons narrowly escaped injury or death.
Bomb squad officers said the blast was believed caused
by a "well-made pipe bomb." Fragments of a possible
bomb casing were found embedded deep into the concrete
wall of a women's restroom where the explosion apparently
originated, officers said.
The blast sent a metal stall through the wall and into an
adjoining men's restroom, blew out some walls, buckled
others, damaged a sauna and collapsed a ceiling in the

building's lobby, police said.
The building ->used offices of radio stations KOME,
KBAY-FM, and T 'EEN; U.S. Rep. Norman Mineta, former
San Jose mayor; and Pacific Telephone, police said.
None of the offices was believed seriously damaged
though damage to the center, mainly its first floor
restrooms and lobby, was estimated at $100,000.
While House Punishes Paper
WASHINGTON — The White House press office took
action yesterday against the Washington Star-News for
publishing details of President Ford's budget prior to the
noon release time.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said a reporter for the paper
will be dropped from the list of those scheduled to ask
questions at today's news conference in Atlanta and the
newspaper will not get an advance copy of Ford's economic
message to be released today. Reporters for the Star-News
will also be barred from an advance briefing on the
economic message, Nessen said.
Star-News Editor James Bellows termed Nessen's actions
"childish" and said the embargo was broken because Ford
himself had released key figures in the budget on Saturday.

GRESHAM, Wis. — A band of Menominee Indians which
had occupied a backwoods religious estate by force of arms
for 34 days surrendered to Shawano County suthorities late
last night.
Shawano County authorities declined immediate
comment on what charges would be filed.
The estimated 40 men and women were taken from the
estate in two National Guard buses. They then were
transferred to two school buses and taken to the Shawano
County jail. There they were greeted by a throng of
cheering, drumbeating sympathizers and relatives.
The group surrendered as a condition of an agreement
for transferring the estate to the Menominee tribe as a
health and educational facility.

Hearst Spotted In L.A.?
LOS ANGELES — The FBI said here last night it had
ceased actively investigating a report that newspaper heiress
Patricia Hearst and two other women had kidnaped a man
in Hollywood and forced him to drive in circles for 40
minutes.
The incident, first reported by San Francisco television
newswoman Marilyn Baker, involved a man identified as
Edward Carr who told police he was picked up last Friday
by three women and forced at gunpoint to drive around the
Hollywood area before he was released.
"The FBI has talked to him and based on the
information he was furnished regarding the sighting of
Patricia Hearst, we are unable to confirm the information
and are conducting no additional investigation regarding the
incident," the agency said.
Police all but discounted the incident too.
"We are treating it the same as all other 760 sightings
and are making every effort to determine if what Carr says
is true," said Cmdr. Pete Hagan of the Los Angeles Police
Department.
Carr told the newswoman in a taped broadcast that "it
looked like the real Patty Hearst. In my estimation it was
her. There is no doubt in my mind about it."
Kissinger Proposes Priee Floor
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
today proposed setting a price floor for oil production
throughout the world to insure development of new energy
sources.
In a speech to the National Press Club, Kissinger said this
support system will set the price lower than the current
level of about $11 a barrel, but considerably higher than
the $3-a-barrel figure paid before the oil crisis broke out a
year and one-half ago.
He explained that the American-led effort to conserve
on the use of imported oil and to develop new sources of
energy threatens to drive down the price of petroleum
products in the next few years.
S.J. Radio Stations Bombed
SAN JOSE — A powerful explosion ripped out walls,
collapsed a ceiling and did extensive damage yesterday to a
building that houses three radio stations and an office of
General Motors Acceptance Corp., police said.
Officers said no one was reported injured, though several
persons narrowly escaped injury or death.
Bomb squad officers said the blast was believed caused
by a "well-made pipe bomb." Fragments of a possible
bomb casing were found embedded deep into the concrete
wall of a women's restroom where the explosion apparently
originated, officers said.
The blast sent a metal stall through the wall and into an
adjoining men's restroom, blew out some walls, buckled
others, damaged a sauna and collapsed a ceiling in the

building's lobby, police said.
The building ->used offices of radio stations KOME,
KBAY-FM, and T 'EEN; U.S. Rep. Norman Mineta, former
San Jose mayor; and Pacific Telephone, police said.
None of the offices was believed seriously damaged
though damage to the center, mainly its first floor
restrooms and lobby, was estimated at $100,000.
While House Punishes Paper
WASHINGTON — The White House press office took
action yesterday against the Washington Star-News for
publishing details of President Ford's budget prior to the
noon release time.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said a reporter for the paper
will be dropped from the list of those scheduled to ask
questions at today's news conference in Atlanta and the
newspaper will not get an advance copy of Ford's economic
message to be released today. Reporters for the Star-News
will also be barred from an advance briefing on the
economic message, Nessen said.
Star-News Editor James Bellows termed Nessen's actions
"childish" and said the embargo was broken because Ford
himself had released key figures in the budget on Saturday.

noon release time.
Press Secretary Ron Nessen said a reporter for the paper
will be dropped from the list of those scheduled to ask
questions at today's news conference in Atlanta and the
newspaper will not get an advance copy of Ford's economic
message to be released today. Reporters for the Star-News
will also be barred from an advance briefing on the
economic message, Nessen said.
Star-News Editor James Bellows termed Nessen's actions
"childish" and said the embargo was broken because Ford
himself had released key figures in the budget on Saturday.

last night.
Shawano County authorities declined immediate
comment on what charges would be filed.
The estimated 40 men and women were taken from the
estate in two National Guard buses. They then were
transferred to two school buses and taken to the Shawano
