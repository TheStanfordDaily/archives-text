# SRI Must Alter Name
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
The Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was given two more years to
change its name in a decision by the
Board of Trustees last month.
Because a small Southern California
real estate firm has raised legal
objections, SRI has been unable-to
officially use its initials, as it had
planned.
Separated from the University in
1970, SRI was given five years to
change its name to avoid inferences of
connection with the University. The
legal tangle prompted the Board of
Trustees to extend the deadline to
1977.
Originally a Stanford affiliate, SRI
was the target of extensive protests
and demonstrations by Stanford
students during 1969 for its Defense
Department contracts. The April 3rd
Movement, an organization of student
political activists, called for "an end to
CBW [chemical and biological
warfare], counterinsurgency, and
war-related research there."
Rather than discontinue the
research, the Board of Trustees voted
to make SRI an independent
institution.
The initials "SRI" had been
decided upon for the new name.
The institute is usually known by
the acronym anyway, but a small real
estate office in Southern California
raised legal objections. The Stanford
Real Estate and Insurance already uses
the initials, and, according to Ron
Deutsch of the Research Institute, it is

illegal for both agencies to use it.
"We're hoping to reach an
agreement with them," said Deutsch.
"We're hoping for the initials." If SRI
is officially given the initials, the
Southland firm will have to change its
name.
The two extra years should enable
SRI to deal with any of the legal
problems involved. "We'd like to see
the matter settled as soon as possible,"
said Deutsch. But "it takes time to
legally change all the papers and
documents associated with an
institution which has been in existence
for over 25 years."
Other names are under
consideration if SRI cannot use its
initials. Deutsch, however, refused to
give any examples.
