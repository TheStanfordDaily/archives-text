# University Should Stay Out
## Herman Blasts 'Events' Plan 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
ASSU President Mike Herman and
Vice President Quinn Mayer yesterday
reiterated their belief that the
University should not compete with
the ASSU Special Events, which has
become a lucrative program over the
past two years under graduate
student-director Danny Scher.
The University is considering hiring
Scher as a full-time director of special
events.
In a taping for KZSU's Inside
Stanford, which will be aired tonight,
Mayer outlined a plan under which the
ASSU would hire both a professional
special events manager and a student
concert director.
Under Mayer's proposal, the
professional director would handle
"high-yield, high-risk" concerts, while
the concert director would organize
free or low-cost concerts from a
$20,000 yearly budget. Mayer
compared this structure with the
ASSU's Speaker's Bureau, which
depends on money from the ASSU.

Herman, however, objected to the
hiring of a non-student by the ASSU.
Educational experience is one of the
functions of the ASSU, Herman said,
and this experience depends on a
yearly staff turnover.
Herman thus has requested that
Scher leave Stanford after graduating
from the Business School this June.
Herman believes that the University's
hiring of Scher would result in its
competition with ASSU Special
Events.
Discuss Issues
Herman and other members of his
council of presidents also discussed
other issues affecting the ASSU.
Herman defended his
"Stanford-In-Stanford" program,
scheduled to begin this fall.
He described the
"Stanford-In-Stanford" campus as "a
more intense educational experience
than other in-house seminars, but one
tempered by exposure to classes with
the rest of the Stanford community.
The main emphasis in the program
would be arms control, and the
student residence could become a
center for arms control activity during
the year, Herman said.
Herman and Mayer agreed that the
Public Interest Research Group
(PIRG) has failed to address the needs
of students, in spite of $10,000 PIRG
received from a student fee assessment
passed last spring.

Mayer said that the fee assessment
was "premature," adding that a
campus-initiated program such as
Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) would be more deserving of
student support.
Herman speculated that student
reaction to the PIRG assessment led to
the defeat of the Live Oak and record
co-op proposals last fall.
Mayer said he hopes to co-ordinate
some kind of transit system on
campus. He is now appealing to the
Palo Alto-Menlo Park Transportation
Advisory Board, and expects to
present the results of recent student
survey on bus use to the Santa Clara
County Transit Authority.
