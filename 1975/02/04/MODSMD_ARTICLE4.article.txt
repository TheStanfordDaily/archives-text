# Kringle Delivers Tickets To Daily
## 
### 
Kris Kringle, the mysterious
| parking ticket snatcher, has
delivered a new gift to the Daily.
I Last night, Kringle deposited a
1 envelope filled with nine citations
I on the desk of Daily Editor Kevin
| Smith.
I This is the third time that
| parking tickets have been sent to
pthe Daily by Kringle.
| Kringle's activities appear to be
| protests against the University and
1 its refusal to reform the alledgedly
I inequitable parking fee system.
