# CAB Delays Decision On Charter Flights
## 
### MARK FUNK MARK LICKER 
The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
has shelved — at least temporarily — its
controversial plan to bar affinity
charter flights, according to ASSU
Vice President Quinn Mayer.
The CAB announced it will
postpone indefinitely proposals that
would have banned the sale of new
affinity charter packages after March
31 and barred any such flights by the
end of 1975. According to a board
spokesman, the measure will not be
revived for at least a year.
Affinity flights are currently the
only ones used by Stanford students
for Christmas and spring break
charters through the ASSU Travel
Service. ASSU officials have been
lobbying the California congressional
delegation and the CAB since
mid-December for a reprieve of the
charters.
The CAB proposal met a negative
response from the University
community.
Strong Opposition
Mayer said that he felt the CAB was
forced to reconsider its proposal in the
face of strong opposition presented by
clubs and organizations which qualify
for the affinity services, and from
critics in Congress.
"I think that the charters were
saved because a number of people with
the same interests were willing to work
together and apply pressure on the
CAB," Meyer said. "It appeared that
the board was going to renege on its
committment to low-income
passengers."
Business at the ASSU Travel Service
remained brisk even before the CAB's
lastest announcement. "Our charters

are booked up until next spring,"
Mayer said.
Not even the threatened ban could
put a dent in charter sales. "In fact,
the sales may have picked up since the
[original] CAB announcement,"
contended Cookie Bedford of the
Travel Service.
Thus no rush on the Travel Service
is expected in the wake of the CAB's
latest move.
Airlines Agree
Meanwhile, the International Air
Transport Association (lATA) and
several scheduled-on-demand airlines
agreed last week to restore special
youth fares to Europe April 1, pending
approval by U.S. agencies and
European governments.
The CAB had previously ruled that
special youth fares were
discriminatory on the basis of age. The
airlines, too, had difficulty agreeing
upon minimum fares for European
charter flights, which prevented
agreement on a youth fare.
Demand-scheduled airlines such as
Atlantis and Sabena-Belgium called
proposed minimum charter prices
inflated, while members of lATA, a
consortium of international carriers
wanted a minimum charter fee in the
new fare schedule.
The agreement between the two
sides is expected to put pressure on
the CAB to reverse its ban on youth
fa r es.
Transatlantic youth fares were
introduced in May, 1971, permitting
travelers ages 12-21, and in some cases
through 29, to fly round-trip for as
little as $195. The CAB stopped the
fares Dec. 31, 1973. Transatlantic air
travel declined six percent last year.

The CAB announced it will
postpone indefinitely proposals that
would have banned the sale of new
affinity charter packages after March
31 and barred any such flights by the
end of 1975. According to a board
spokesman, the measure will not be
revived for at least a year.
Affinity flights are currently the
only ones used by Stanford students
for Christmas and spring break
charters through the ASSU Travel
Service. ASSU officials have been
lobbying the California congressional
delegation and the CAB since
mid-December for a reprieve of the
charters.
The CAB proposal met a negative
response from the University
community.
Strong Opposition
Mayer said that he felt the CAB was
forced to reconsider its proposal in the
face of strong opposition presented by
clubs and organizations which qualify
for the affinity services, and from
critics in Congress.
"I think that the charters were
saved because a number of people with
the same interests were willing to work
together and apply pressure on the
CAB," Meyer said. "It appeared that
the board was going to renege on its
committment to low-income
passengers."
Business at the ASSU Travel Service
remained brisk even before the CAB's
lastest announcement. "Our charters

are booked up until next spring,"
Mayer said.
Not even the threatened ban could
put a dent in charter sales. "In fact,
the sales may have picked up since the
[original] CAB announcement,"
contended Cookie Bedford of the
Travel Service.
Thus no rush on the Travel Service
is expected in the wake of the CAB's
latest move.
Airlines Agree
Meanwhile, the International Air
Transport Association (lATA) and
several scheduled-on-demand airlines
agreed last week to restore special
youth fares to Europe April 1, pending
approval by U.S. agencies and
European governments.
The CAB had previously ruled that
special youth fares were
discriminatory on the basis of age. The
airlines, too, had difficulty agreeing
upon minimum fares for European
charter flights, which prevented
agreement on a youth fare.
Demand-scheduled airlines such as
Atlantis and Sabena-Belgium called
proposed minimum charter prices
inflated, while members of lATA, a
consortium of international carriers
wanted a minimum charter fee in the
new fare schedule.
The agreement between the two
sides is expected to put pressure on
the CAB to reverse its ban on youth
fa r es.
Transatlantic youth fares were
introduced in May, 1971, permitting
travelers ages 12-21, and in some cases
through 29, to fly round-trip for as
little as $195. The CAB stopped the
fares Dec. 31, 1973. Transatlantic air
travel declined six percent last year.
The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
has shelved — at least temporarily — its
controversial plan to bar affinity
charter flights, according to ASSU
Vice President Quinn Mayer.
