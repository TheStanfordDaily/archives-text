# Physics Profs Decry Funding

### DON COX 
Professionals in the field of physics
have expressed their concern over
short-sighted and inconsistent federal
funding patterns that may "seriously
impede" the development of new
knowledge in the field and demoralize
the next generation of physicists.
Many feel the federal government
must assume responsibility for the
health of basic science as academic
institutions, faced with growing
financial difficulties, prove unable to
provide substantial support for
research.
Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky, director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), speaking last week to
the annual meeting of the American
Physical Society in Anaheim, said "we
call ill afford a major interruption in
the evolution of basic understanding
of physics."
"It is this next generation on which
we depend for averting the threat to
our future brought by the limited
availability of ecologically safe energy
sources and raw materials," he said.
While physics "remains healthy"
today as a profession, "it is not clear
that we will have a sufficient number

of highly gifted new physicists to meet
these new demands outside of the
academic environment, once
additional positions are created,"
warned Panofsky.
"Many graduate schools are already
finding exceptional candidates rare.
Reasons for this include
disenchantment with science, or its
technological consequences, and the
apparent lack of identifiable and
promising career opportunities," he
said.
Since the birth rate in the country
is down and universities are no longer
expanding, "new opportunities for
traditional academic careers are
withering," he added.
SLAC Prof. Martin L. Perl, also
speaking at the conference, said young
physicists are having trouble finding
permanent careers in physics and older
physicists are having problems
maintaining their careers. He and the
other conferees agreed that university
physics departments should allow no
increase in the number of graduate
students they enroll until they are sure
there are jobs for them.
"In the next five years, only half of
the young men and women who

receive doctorates in physics will be
able to have traditional careers in
physics," Perl said. "The other half
will have to develp non-traditional
careers in fields as diverse as medical
physics, geophysics, environmental
physics, engineering, chemistry,
computing, and working in congress
or in state legislatures," he said.
In order for the new generation of
physicists to be able to contribute in
these non-traditional fields, the
emphasis in academic programs will
shift to train more "gener
alist-physicists" rather than the highly
specialized physicists produced
currently who are prepared to do
research in only a single field, Perl
said.
Physics Department Chairman
Walter Meyerhof said it "is not easy to
reverse this trend in the academic
curriculum and this changeover
sometimes has serious effects."
He expressed concern over the
undermining of this specialization
since "knowledge can't advance far
unless researchers have the specialized
knowledge necessary." Meyerhof said,
however, that his department is
thinking about a master plan for the
future so that the physicists can be
trained to operate both in traditional
and nontraditional roles. As an
alternative individual institutions
might also choose to concentrate in
just one of these areas, he said.
Panofsky agreed that "graduate
departments have a positive obligation
to review their advisory methods so
that graduate students will have a less
negative attitude toward entering
professional life outside the academic
sphere, and so the large majority of
new physicists will be motivated to do

applied work as a matter of first rather
than second choice."
Perl minimized the danger of any
shortage of physicists in case of
national need since "the American
educational machine has a very quick
response."
However, Panofsky js "very much
concerned" about the possible absence
of qualified physicists needed in the
future.
Because of bad organization, he
said, the federal government has not
yet realized the future need for
physicists and supplied adequate
funding.
