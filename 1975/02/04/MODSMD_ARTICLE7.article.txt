# One Year Later: Where's Patty Hearst?
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
BERKELEY—One year ago tonight Patty Hearst
stepped out of the shower, toweled herself off, and put
on a blue robe. Then she walked downstairs into a
nightmare so ugly and violent that it shook the nation.
A few minutes after she left the shower, Patty was
locked in the trunk of a car speeding towards elegant
Tanglewood Avenue. Her bloody, muddled fiance
Steven Weed was trying to explain to police what
happened. And the bizarre saga of Patty Hearst had
begun.
Now, 12 months later, there's still no end in sight.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is still looking for
the tattered remnants of the Symbionese Liberation
Army, the terrorist group that first kidnaped Patty
Hearst and then — apparently — converted her.
No one has heard from Patty since she sent a tape to
a Los Angeles radio station last June 7, glorifying six
SLA members she died in a fiery shootout with police
— and declaring her love for one of them, Willie Wolfe.
"Cujo [Wolfe] was the gentlest, most beautiful man
I've ever known ... Neither Cujo nor I had ever loved
an individual the way we loved each other, probably
because our relationship wasn't based on bourgeois,
fucked-up values, attitudes and goals," she said in a
frigid monotone.
'Pig Hearsts'
And there was more: "Live is very important to me,
but I have no delusions that going to prison would
keep me alive, and I would never choose to live the rest
of my life surrounded by pigs like the Hearsts," Patty
— now calling herself Tania, after a dead South
American revolutionary — announced.
Earlier, when she spat on her father's $2 million
free-food plan, Patty insisted the FBI was trying "to
assassinate me" and said of her fiance Weed: "Steven

has shown himself to be a sexist, agist pig."
In between, there was a dizzying series of events —
Patty's declaration that "I have chosen to stay and
fight," her sudden appearence in the middle of a San
Francisco bank robbery, firing an automatic weapon at
the front of a sporting goods store, kidnaping a young
Los Angeles high school student.
And since then, nothing.
"Every day that goes by puts us one dary closer to
finding them," insisted FBI Special Agent Charles
Bates. But then, more humbly, he admitted: "If we
knew where they were we would go out and get
them ... We don't know where she is, but we know a
lot of places she's not."
Checking Reports
Bates and the 12 San Francisco FBI agents still
looking for the SLA will probably spend today quietly
checking out some of the 760 sightings of Patty
reported over the last 52 weeks.
Randolph A. Hearst, Patty's father, will probably
spend a quiet day in his offices in the San Francisco
Examiner's building. Hearst, the Examiner's editor,
doesn't expect it to be a special occasion.
"This is a sad anniversary for us," Hearst said. "The
hardest thing Mrs. Hearst and I have to bear is not
knowing whether Patty is alive and well. We believe she
is alive and in this country, but since the last tape we
have had no work of any kind."
Hearst believes his daughter would go free if she
turned herself into authorities. "I don't think she's
going to get any time in jail ... In any event, the only
thing we want is that she be able to live her own life as
a free woman," he added.
If there had been no kidnaping, Steven Weed would
most likely go to classes this moming at UC-Berkeley,


TANIA—A year ago today she was Patty Hearst, 19 year-old Berkeley coed,
busily picking out china for her upcoming marriage. Then something
happened, and she became Tania, gunslinging bank robber. What—and
where—is she now?
where he was a doctoral candidate in philosophy. Then
he would have gone home to see his wife — Patty.
But the SLA savagely interrupted Weed's plans for
marriage and education. Instead, hell stay in his
apartment, just a few blocks from the one he and Patty
lived in last February, and work on his forthcoming
book about the kidnaping.
"I'm not regulating my life according to this wait
for her," said the 26-year old Weed. "But obviously
this is hanging over all of us . .. She's just got to know
that there's something unresolved about what
happened to her — what she's done. It's a story that
doesn't have an ending. Perhaps she's thinking of that

now, what the ending should be."
And Patty Hearst — what will she be doing today?
Where will she spend her morning? What thoughts are
running through her mind as the first year of her new
life ends?
Is she even alive?
No one knows.
Meanwhile, a year after it all began, the story
continues. "Every time there is some publicity the calls
and public interest go up," FBI man Bates said
thoughtfully last week. "This type of article will start
them again. We'll get a lot of calls. Maybe the call we're
looking for will come from this."

Francisco bank robbery, firing an automatic weapon at
the front of a sporting goods store, kidnaping a young
Los Angeles high school student.
And since then, nothing.
"Every day that goes by puts us one dary closer to
finding them," insisted FBI Special Agent Charles
Bates. But then, more humbly, he admitted: "If we
knew where they were we would go out and get
them ... We don't know where she is, but we know a
lot of places she's not."
Checking Reports
Bates and the 12 San Francisco FBI agents still
looking for the SLA will probably spend today quietly
checking out some of the 760 sightings of Patty
reported over the last 52 weeks.
Randolph A. Hearst, Patty's father, will probably
spend a quiet day in his offices in the San Francisco
Examiner's building. Hearst, the Examiner's editor,
doesn't expect it to be a special occasion.
"This is a sad anniversary for us," Hearst said. "The
hardest thing Mrs. Hearst and I have to bear is not
knowing whether Patty is alive and well. We believe she
is alive and in this country, but since the last tape we
have had no work of any kind."
Hearst believes his daughter would go free if she
turned herself into authorities. "I don't think she's
going to get any time in jail ... In any event, the only
thing we want is that she be able to live her own life as
a free woman," he added.
If there had been no kidnaping, Steven Weed would
most likely go to classes this moming at UC-Berkeley,


TANIA—A year ago today she was Patty Hearst, 19 year-old Berkeley coed,
busily picking out china for her upcoming marriage. Then something
happened, and she became Tania, gunslinging bank robber. What—and
where—is she now?
where he was a doctoral candidate in philosophy. Then
he would have gone home to see his wife — Patty.
But the SLA savagely interrupted Weed's plans for
marriage and education. Instead, hell stay in his
apartment, just a few blocks from the one he and Patty
lived in last February, and work on his forthcoming
book about the kidnaping.
"I'm not regulating my life according to this wait
for her," said the 26-year old Weed. "But obviously
this is hanging over all of us . .. She's just got to know
that there's something unresolved about what
happened to her — what she's done. It's a story that
doesn't have an ending. Perhaps she's thinking of that

now, what the ending should be."
And Patty Hearst — what will she be doing today?
Where will she spend her morning? What thoughts are
running through her mind as the first year of her new
life ends?
Is she even alive?
No one knows.
Meanwhile, a year after it all began, the story
continues. "Every time there is some publicity the calls
and public interest go up," FBI man Bates said
thoughtfully last week. "This type of article will start
them again. We'll get a lot of calls. Maybe the call we're
looking for will come from this."
BERKELEY—One year ago tonight Patty Hearst
stepped out of the shower, toweled herself off, and put
on a blue robe. Then she walked downstairs into a
nightmare so ugly and violent that it shook the nation.
A few minutes after she left the shower, Patty was
locked in the trunk of a car speeding towards elegant
Tanglewood Avenue. Her bloody, muddled fiance
Steven Weed was trying to explain to police what
happened. And the bizarre saga of Patty Hearst had
begun.
Now, 12 months later, there's still no end in sight.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is still looking for
the tattered remnants of the Symbionese Liberation
Army, the terrorist group that first kidnaped Patty
Hearst and then — apparently — converted her.
No one has heard from Patty since she sent a tape to
a Los Angeles radio station last June 7, glorifying six
SLA members she died in a fiery shootout with police
— and declaring her love for one of them, Willie Wolfe.
"Cujo [Wolfe] was the gentlest, most beautiful man
I've ever known ... Neither Cujo nor I had ever loved
an individual the way we loved each other, probably
because our relationship wasn't based on bourgeois,
fucked-up values, attitudes and goals," she said in a
frigid monotone.
'Pig Hearsts'
And there was more: "Live is very important to me,
but I have no delusions that going to prison would
keep me alive, and I would never choose to live the rest
of my life surrounded by pigs like the Hearsts," Patty
— now calling herself Tania, after a dead South
American revolutionary — announced.
Earlier, when she spat on her father's $2 million
free-food plan, Patty insisted the FBI was trying "to
assassinate me" and said of her fiance Weed: "Steven

has shown himself to be a sexist, agist pig."
In between, there was a dizzying series of events —
Patty's declaration that "I have chosen to stay and
fight," her sudden appearence in the middle of a San

But the SLA savagely interrupted Weed's plans for
marriage and education. Instead, hell stay in his
apartment, just a few blocks from the one he and Patty
lived in last February, and work on his forthcoming
book about the kidnaping.
"I'm not regulating my life according to this wait
for her," said the 26-year old Weed. "But obviously
this is hanging over all of us . .. She's just got to know
that there's something unresolved about what
happened to her — what she's done. It's a story that
doesn't have an ending. Perhaps she's thinking of that

now, what the ending should be."
And Patty Hearst — what will she be doing today?
Where will she spend her morning? What thoughts are
running through her mind as the first year of her new
life ends?
Is she even alive?
No one knows.
Meanwhile, a year after it all began, the story
continues. "Every time there is some publicity the calls
and public interest go up," FBI man Bates said
thoughtfully last week. "This type of article will start
them again. We'll get a lot of calls. Maybe the call we're
looking for will come from this."
BERKELEY—One year ago tonight Patty Hearst
stepped out of the shower, toweled herself off, and put
on a blue robe. Then she walked downstairs into a
nightmare so ugly and violent that it shook the nation.
A few minutes after she left the shower, Patty was
locked in the trunk of a car speeding towards elegant
Tanglewood Avenue. Her bloody, muddled fiance
Steven Weed was trying to explain to police what
happened. And the bizarre saga of Patty Hearst had
begun.
Now, 12 months later, there's still no end in sight.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is still looking for
the tattered remnants of the Symbionese Liberation
Army, the terrorist group that first kidnaped Patty
Hearst and then — apparently — converted her.
No one has heard from Patty since she sent a tape to
a Los Angeles radio station last June 7, glorifying six
SLA members she died in a fiery shootout with police
— and declaring her love for one of them, Willie Wolfe.
"Cujo [Wolfe] was the gentlest, most beautiful man
I've ever known ... Neither Cujo nor I had ever loved
an individual the way we loved each other, probably
because our relationship wasn't based on bourgeois,
fucked-up values, attitudes and goals," she said in a
frigid monotone.
'Pig Hearsts'
And there was more: "Live is very important to me,
but I have no delusions that going to prison would
keep me alive, and I would never choose to live the rest
of my life surrounded by pigs like the Hearsts," Patty
— now calling herself Tania, after a dead South
American revolutionary — announced.
Earlier, when she spat on her father's $2 million
free-food plan, Patty insisted the FBI was trying "to
assassinate me" and said of her fiance Weed: "Steven

has shown himself to be a sexist, agist pig."
In between, there was a dizzying series of events —
Patty's declaration that "I have chosen to stay and
fight," her sudden appearence in the middle of a San
Francisco bank robbery, firing an automatic weapon at
the front of a sporting goods store, kidnaping a young
Los Angeles high school student.
And since then, nothing.
"Every day that goes by puts us one dary closer to
finding them," insisted FBI Special Agent Charles
Bates. But then, more humbly, he admitted: "If we
knew where they were we would go out and get
them ... We don't know where she is, but we know a
lot of places she's not."
Checking Reports
Bates and the 12 San Francisco FBI agents still
looking for the SLA will probably spend today quietly
checking out some of the 760 sightings of Patty
reported over the last 52 weeks.
Randolph A. Hearst, Patty's father, will probably
spend a quiet day in his offices in the San Francisco
Examiner's building. Hearst, the Examiner's editor,
doesn't expect it to be a special occasion.
"This is a sad anniversary for us," Hearst said. "The
hardest thing Mrs. Hearst and I have to bear is not
knowing whether Patty is alive and well. We believe she
is alive and in this country, but since the last tape we
have had no work of any kind."
Hearst believes his daughter would go free if she
turned herself into authorities. "I don't think she's
going to get any time in jail ... In any event, the only
thing we want is that she be able to live her own life as
a free woman," he added.
If there had been no kidnaping, Steven Weed would
most likely go to classes this moming at UC-Berkeley,


TANIA—A year ago today she was Patty Hearst, 19 year-old Berkeley coed,
busily picking out china for her upcoming marriage. Then something
happened, and she became Tania, gunslinging bank robber. What—and
where—is she now?
