## Kudos For Notes 
### 
When the ASSU Lecture Notes Service began operation
this quarter, many persons were skeptical of its value to
students as well as of its financial viability.
In its first few weeks, however, the service has proven
both valuable and solvent. We commend the service and its
director, Vic Petroff, for doing an excellent job.
Almost all of the students interviewed by the Daily
believe that the notes are of excellent quality and are well
worth the $4 to $5 price. The generally favorable response
indicates that the large number of subscriptions sold this
quarter will not decrease as the novelty wears off.
We are also encouraged by the favorable responses by
professors. For example, Prof. H. Alan Schwettman (Physics
51), who was initially skeptical, now approves of the notes.
Schwettman makes excellent use of the notes' educational
value by adding examples to them which supplement his
lectures.
We hope the lecture note service can be expanded to
include more than the present 14 courses. In order to do so,
Petroff has said, the service needs additional capital (to
purchase more equipment) and more office space.
We feel that if the service continues to be operated as
efficiently as it presently is, any costs incurred in expansion
would be more than recovered in additional subscription
fees.
