# Help Minorities
## Jaramillo, et.al. 
### 
The Jan. 28 Daily editorial
supports the proposed changes
contained in the Draft Report of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid on
the basis that the proposed
changes are in an effort to achieve
equity. The Daily states that it
recognizes the need for minority
enrollment but does not state that
it would support efforts to help
increase the minority enrollment.
Instead, it supports a proposed
change in financial aid that on the
surface appears to be merely the
result of an attempt by the
University to treat all low-income
student needs equally, but which
in fact increases significantly the
burdens not only on the minority
students but also on all
low-income students.
The example used by the Daily
is misleading because it is
incomplete. The Daily is correct
in urging that all students from
very low-income families seeking
financial aid provide $700 in
self-help, either through loans or
assigned jobs. What it does not
state is that this $700 figure is for
a student whose parents' income
is below $6910, after taxes, for
one child on a sliding scale; this
$700 does not include summer
earnings or parental contributions.
Neither does the Daily state
that the student whose parental
income is above $6910 must
increase the self-help figure to
$900-1700 for the school year,
depending on the student's
categorization by the University.
Parental contributions are not
included in this figure and are
above the $1200-2100 expected
self-help per calendar year.

Presently, approximately 75
percent of minority students have
parental incomes below $15,000.
At the open meeting of the
committee on Jan. 21, the
ex-officio members of the board
indicated that the new financial
aid packages were designed so that
a student would not need to work
too much or, if he aspired to
graduate school, be too much in
debt.
Extending the figures over a
period of four years, assuming a
probable increase in tuition, room
and board, a low-income student
who took out loans to cover the
self-help figure would find himself
as much as $7000-8000 in debt.
The chicano community has no
argument with the University's
proclaimed commitments to
equity. We support financial aid
to all low-income students, we
enthusiastically support actions
aimed at achieving equity — and
we will not allow the University
to phase out its commitment to
minorities by imposing an
untenable financial burden on
otherwise potential students.
Aid to all low-income students
need not be made at the expense
of the already underrepresented
minorities. Emptying the
University of low-income
minorities will never create
equity; the University must
therefore extend its
commitment, not renege on the
promises made in 1968, in the
wake of the assasination of Dr.
Martin King.

Neither does the Daily state
that the student whose parental
income is above $6910 must
increase the self-help figure to
$900-1700 for the school year,
depending on the student's
categorization by the University.
Parental contributions are not
included in this figure and are
above the $1200-2100 expected
self-help per calendar year.

Presently, approximately 75
percent of minority students have
parental incomes below $15,000.
At the open meeting of the
committee on Jan. 21, the
ex-officio members of the board
indicated that the new financial
aid packages were designed so that
a student would not need to work
too much or, if he aspired to
graduate school, be too much in
debt.
Extending the figures over a
period of four years, assuming a
probable increase in tuition, room
and board, a low-income student
who took out loans to cover the
self-help figure would find himself
as much as $7000-8000 in debt.
The chicano community has no
argument with the University's
proclaimed commitments to
equity. We support financial aid
to all low-income students, we
enthusiastically support actions
aimed at achieving equity — and
we will not allow the University
to phase out its commitment to
minorities by imposing an
untenable financial burden on
otherwise potential students.
Aid to all low-income students
need not be made at the expense
of the already underrepresented
minorities. Emptying the
University of low-income
minorities will never create
equity; the University must
therefore extend its
commitment, not renege on the
promises made in 1968, in the
wake of the assasination of Dr.
Martin King.

The Jan. 28 Daily editorial
supports the proposed changes
contained in the Draft Report of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid on
the basis that the proposed
changes are in an effort to achieve
equity. The Daily states that it
recognizes the need for minority
enrollment but does not state that
it would support efforts to help
increase the minority enrollment.
Instead, it supports a proposed
change in financial aid that on the
surface appears to be merely the
result of an attempt by the
University to treat all low-income
student needs equally, but which
in fact increases significantly the
burdens not only on the minority
students but also on all
low-income students.
The example used by the Daily
is misleading because it is
incomplete. The Daily is correct
in urging that all students from
very low-income families seeking
financial aid provide $700 in
self-help, either through loans or
assigned jobs. What it does not
state is that this $700 figure is for
a student whose parents' income
is below $6910, after taxes, for
one child on a sliding scale; this
$700 does not include summer
earnings or parental contributions.
