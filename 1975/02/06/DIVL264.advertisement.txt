THE KENSINGTON SRNDWICH
Our chef, Deborah Windsor, is a bright, cheerful, and nearly
forbiddingly competent young woman. She comes to us as a
gracious gift from Wales, and has had extensive training in
cookery in London.
When we at The Drones Club first decided to add several special
sandwiches to our menu, it was Debbie herself who suggested a
sandwich of healthy roast beef, sharp cheddar cheese, served on a
toasted sourdough roll. This seemed a fine idea — what else could
one expect from a woman inured in the noble traditions of British
cookery? The problem was what to call the sandwich.
After a time it occurred to us that in our first chat with Debbie,
we had mentioned our inability to ever get a Yorkshire pudding to
rise properly. Debbie at once told us how. (And she was right, we
may add.) She concluded her discourse with an anecdote. "Once
when I was in Kensington —" she began in her wonderful way, and
a sandwich was named.
Kensington, that posh section of London, with its antique shops,
restrained architecture, and memorable small cafes. (This is only
what we have been told. For we have never, alas, been in Ken
sington.)
And so, late at night, sometimes we sit at the warm copper bar of
The Drones Club and sip a glass of very dry Madiera while con
suming our sandwich. It may not be Kensington, no, but it is more
than slight compensation.
The Kensington is one of four special sandwiches we serve daily
at The Drones Club with our regular fare, along with daily specials,
and home made soup and chili. And it is suggested that if you do
order a Kensington sandwich as your meal, you might have with it
a glass or two of one of the good English beers we provide — and
perhaps dream of Kensington yourself.
We have 4 special sandwiches along with our regular
meals and daily specials. Serving continuously from 11 a.m.
