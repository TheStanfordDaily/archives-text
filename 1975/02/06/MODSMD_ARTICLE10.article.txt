# Environment Still Imperiled
## 
### 
The state of the environmental
movement, like the state of the
Union, is not encouraging. The
fifth anniversary of Karth Day
1970 approaches but hopes that
the 1970s would be the "decade
of the environment" have proven
largely illusory.
In California, large pains have
produced small gains. Frustrated
in Sacramento, organizations
concentrating on the initiative process
have succeeded in placing
environmental measures on every
general election ballot since 1970.
The results have characteristically
been defeats or disappointing
victories.
Prop. 18 (gas tax for rapid
transit) was killed in 1970 by a
massive propaganda blitz financed
in part by illegal oil money. A
second attempt, Prop. 5
(essentially a rerun of Prop. 18),
which passed last June after the
winter fuel crunch, was a prime
example of "too little, too late."
Prop. 9, a much more
far-reaching measure on the June
1972 ballot, suffered a crushing
defeat at tne polls. Weighted
down with hastily conceived and
overly restrictive provisions, its
passage would have been a mixed
blessing, however.
The "big victory," the 1972
Coastal Initiative (Prop. 20), has
since proven hollow. Designed to
control coastal development, the
regional commissions mandated
by Prop. 20 have rubber stamped
their approval on nearly all
projects they have reviewed. Janet
Adams, chairperson of the Coastal
Alliance which spearheaded the
"Yes on 20" drive, points out that
Prop. 20 may even have
stimulated development by

panic-stricken builders.
The current frontrunner for
top ecology issue in 1976, the
Nuclear Initiative sponsored by
"People for Proof," appears likely
to continue the dismal trend of
past environmental initiatives.
While the hazards of nuclear
power are serious, it is unclear
that this proposal would make
any substantive progress towards
solving the nuclear problem or the
larger energy issue.
The overriding need with
respect to energy is to close the
gap between supply and demand
without generating adverse
ecological side effects which
outweigh the benefits of energy
sufficiency. The Nuclear Safety
Initiative would reduce supply by
slowing atomic power plant
growth and would leave excess
demand caused by wasteful
consumption unaffected.
By focusing attention on the
narrow issue of nuclear risk,
People for Proof are helping to
perpetuate the myth that
environmental preservation is an
elitist goal contrary to the public's
economic well-being.
Much time and money has
already been expended in the
nuclear safety initiative signature
gathering drive. But, as observers
of the S.S.T. controversy will
recall, heavy costs already
incurred do not justify
continuance of a bad investment.
Efficient Usage
The fundamental objective of
environmentalism is a more
efficient use of natural resources.
Is it too much to ask of
environmentalists that they
practice what they preach and
channel their energies into

productive enterprises? High cost
and low yield statewide initiatives
which contradict the conserving
spirit of environmentalism do not
merit support. Laudable goals do
not excuse lamentable tactics.
Recycling campaigns and rallies
against the bonfire may be useful
socially and educationally but
contribute little towards the
solution of long run problems.
"In the long run we are all
dead," said John Maynard
Keynes. If, however, the welfare
of future generations is of concern
to us, a more determined and
better planned effort to combat
the pervasive food-energy-popula
tion crisis is required. In this basic
respect the status quo within the
environmental movement leaves
much to be desired.
