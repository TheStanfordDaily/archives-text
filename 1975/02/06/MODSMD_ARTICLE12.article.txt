# Will Marxists Accept Free Market?
## 
### 
As the economies of the
socialist countries of Eastern
Europe have grown more
industrialized, the central
planning systems in these
countries have broken down and
failed to function.
Central planning has proved
obviously inadequate in
coordinating an industrial
economy. This fundamental
inadequacy was predicted early in
the twentieth century by
"Austrian school" economists like

Ludwig von Mises. Now, almost as
depicted in the novel Time Will
Run Back by economist Henry
Hazlitt, communist countries are
turning more and more to the free
market as a way of organizing
economic activities.
An important related
phenomenon is the increased
numbers of Marxist theoreticians
who are arguing that the market
economy is compatible with
Marxian ideology.
A good example of this market
Marxism can be found in the
article by Radoslav Selucky in the
autumn 1974 issue of Critique, a
new Marxist scholarly journal.
Selucky is a professor of
economics in Canada now. He was
one of the most radical of the
economic reformers in
Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Evolution of Market
At the start, Selucky notes that
the market has its origins in the
division of labor and
specialization in society. In
pre-capitalist societies, market
institutions sometimes exist
alongside such status-based
non-market institutions as slavery
and feudalism. Later in capitalist
society, market relations become
the dominant form of social
interaction. Accompanying this
universalization of market
relations and increased
specialization of functions comes,
for the first time historically,
autonomy and self-direction of
producers.
Those who wish to abolish the
market, Selucky points out, must
abolish its "material and social
prerequisites: the social division
of labor and the autonomy of

producers."
But, Sclucky says, the social
division of labor cannot be
abolished. In fact, increased
industrialization and economic
development deepens the
specialization of function that is
the substance of the social
division of labor.
"New specializations become
necessary with the growing
volume of human knowledge of
the external world; relations
among producers grow more and
more complicated, their mutual
communication and cooperation
becoming more and more
complex and unmanageable. All
this tends to strengthen rather
than weaken the need of a
self-regulating mechanism, capable
of reducing the varied activities of
men and their varied economic
interests stemming therefrom, to a
common denominator."
Substitute For Market?
If the social division of labor
will and must remain in existence,
yet one still wishes to abolish the
market, what, Selucky asks, will
replace market relations'? Is there
a functional substitute as a system
of communication and a feedback
loop between production and
consumption?
If the market is abolished,
Selucky contends, "the
information coming from
consumers (demand) is either
fully cut or at least quite
irrelevant for producers." The
only alternative to the market and
the autonomy of producers is
direct commands to the producers
from superiors and severance of
production from consumer
desires. Selucky advocates

retaining the market and producer
autonomy by replacing the state
and central planning with
producers' cooperatives operating
in the marketplace.
Market's Political Dimensions
In his earlier writings on
political economy, Selucky
similarly emphasized the
importance of the market, zeroing
in especially on the market's
political dimension.
He writes in his 1970 book on
the Czechoslovakian experience:
"I find the basic cause of the
monstrosity of Stalinism to be the
fact that it destroyed the market
and the relations of the market in
the sociological and political, as
well as the economic, senses.
"What is often regarded, then,
as the greatest achievement of
Stalinism — its liquidation of the
market, its attempt to overcome
the fetish of cash-commodity
relations, and its elimination of
competition — I consider to be its
greatest shortcoming, which led it
down a blind alley. . .
"There has been a close
connection throughout history
between the market and the
political organization of society.
Whenever forms of society have
appeared that have 1 ignored
economic exigencies, hierarchic
relations have followed in their
wake in the shape of slavery or
feudalism, or else administrative
command systems have arisen like
wartime capitalism or the Stalinist
version of socialism."
