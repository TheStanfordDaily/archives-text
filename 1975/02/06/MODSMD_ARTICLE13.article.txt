# Students Don't Laugh At Themselves
## 
### 
Stanford students take
themselves too seriously. It seems
everyone at this University has
some sort of Messianic-image.
They can't stand to have someone
poke a little fun at them. One
more manifestation of this
syndrome burst into the limelight
in Allison Brown's reaction
(Daily, Jan. 28) to my IM
Roundup of Jan. 24 in which she
accused me of male chauvinism
for my column about women's
soccer at Stanford.
I have been writing IM
Roundup for two years and I've
poked fun at everyone from
Richard Nixon to Richard Lyman
in my column. Its designed to be a
humorous, light look at that
unique "thrill of victory and
agony of defeat" that takes place
every day in intramural
competition.
If t:\eryone took me seriously
I'd have been called sexist, racist,
redneck, radical, sado-masochistic
and perverted by now. Everyone
of those is false (except possibly
the last). I applaud the efforts of
the Women's Center team. I must
point out to Brown and her
cohorts that I was the student
member on the University
committee that opened up the
University intramural program to
women last year. If I were a sexist
I certainly would have done all I
could to prevent such a liberation.
Subjective Reporting
Taking a specific look at some
of the charges leveled so ruthlessly
against me, I am accused of being
a subjective reporter. The very
nature of my column precludes
objectivity. It is my column where
I interpret events and try to
provide the Daily's readership
with a light look at the intramural
world of sports. Objectivity is not
a factor.
As for my use of the word
"Unlikely" in reference to women
playing soccer: All this means is
that soccer, a very rough and
physical sport on the intramural
level, has generally not been a
sport in which women have
chosen to participate. It means

nothing more than that.
I would encourage women to
play soccer and all the intramural
sports. I think it would improve
our program. I frankly believe in a
sexually egalitarian society.
As for my "quite gentlemanly"
reference to the way El Tigre
played, all that my column meant
is that the Tigre team did not play
in a way that would indicate any
unusual behavior on its part,
i.e., intentionally crushing
someone running down the field.
Jokes Are Unwelcome
What all this comes down to is
that Stanford students really

don't like to be the brunt of
someone else's jokes, no matter
how harmless. Admittedly most
of my jokes are bad ones, but my
IM stories serve the purpose of
bringing to light one of the least
covered, but most participated in
aspects of athletics at Stanford.
Rather than criticize the Daily,
I would applaud it for bringing
into focus a little-publicized part
of Stanford life. And the fact still
remains I wrote about Brown's
team and gave it the publicity she
feels it deserves and I feel it
deserves. If I didn't feel the

Women's Soccer team was
worthwhile I wouldn't waste my
time or the Daily's time writing
about it.
In conclusion, I wish to note
that life is not so serious
that someone having a little fun is
going to ruin your credibility and
future. "Life is a comedy," some
master of the cliche once said, and
that is something a good part of
6000 undergrads have forgotten at
Stanford.
