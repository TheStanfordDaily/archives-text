Praise For LSJUMB
Editor:
Like many other Los Angeles
residents who follow USC
basketball, I recently viewed the
Stanford-USC game which was
televised to the Los Angeles area.
Being a USC fan, I of course was
not entirely pleased with the
game's result, but 1 was most
favorably impressed by the
Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band.
In an era where the seriousness
of sport often is over-emphasized,
it is refreshing to see a band like
Stanford's which has apparently
discovered how to put on a good
show, and have a good time while
doing so.
I'm sure that there are many
others who enjoyed the game
because of the Stanford Band;
consider this letter to be evidence
of the delight of one person
whose weekend went just a little
bit better, thanks to the Stanford
Band.

Parking Misconception
Editor:
Several letters, most recently
Polly Parker's (Daily, Feb. 3) have
discussed the parking issue. There
seems to be a common
misconception about staff
parking. Staff stickers entitle
holders to parking in the Off
Campus Permit areas, not in the
reserved areas which are reserved
for faculty.
One proposal which might
relieve the pressure on the Off
Campus Permit areas, and
eliminate the need for a parking
fee, would be to designate carpool
parking areas and issue permits to
all qualified groups, both student
and staff.

Sexist Art Display
Editor:
I'm not opposed to erotic art,
but as a feminist, I am insulted by
the art exhibit "Recent Figure
Drawings" by the art faculty at
the Art Gallery.
This show includes only the
works of men, and all the
drawings are of nude females. It
perpetuates the image of male
artist, female model. The female
nudes are mostly posed erotically,
often making the crotch the point
of focus. In view of today's
consciousness and affirmative
action, these artists' statements
are grossly insensitive.
If these poses had been of male
models or black females would
they have been so passively
received by the gallery and the
public under the innocuous title
"Recent Figure Drawings?"
Since the gallery is going to
have exhibits of erotic art, it
should represent drawings of both
sexes as well as male and female
artists. We demand therefore, that
the Gallery either change the title
of the show or include the work
of women artists and
compositions including at least
some male figures.
