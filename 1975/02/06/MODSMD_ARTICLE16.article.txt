# Was Gibbs Always Anti-SWOPSI?

### 
When Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs made his first statement
concerning the future of SWOPSI, SCIRE
and Urban Studies, his contentions centered
around the need to save money. But since
this contention was forcibly attacked, he has
come up with another rationale substantially
closer to the truth.
The plain fact of the matter is that no
argument concerning costs can be made with
any real force.
"Given the current fiscal constraints
existing, experimental programs should be
terminated when it is clear their functions
could be performed elsewhere," Gibbs
asserted last month in the Daily.
But in his column (Daily, Jan. 27), he
states "These programs have relatively small
instructional budgets; the savings to the
University in teaching costs will be minimal
... the principal savings would come in
administrative costs."
The direction of Gibbs' argument
concerning SWOPSI and SCIRE has changed
significantly.
Subject Circumvented
Gibbs skillfully avoids the topic of
administrative costs. He mentions them, but
nowhere describes them. Instead he goes to
great lengths to explain that the programs to
be terminated will continue to exist in
different forms. This actually represents the
heart of his rationale.

For two years as a Daily reporter I
covered a series of disputes between Gibbs'
office on the one hand, and SCIRE and
SWOPSI on the other. Repeatedly the subject
of SWOPSI's budget surfaced, and Gibbs
consistently recommended cutting it. The
war between SWOPSI and Gibbs has been
going on for years.
In my opinion, Gibbs has long been upset
with the semi-autonomous position of
SWOPSI and SCIRE.
With Nixonian irony, Gibbs has bolstered
my argument concerning his rationale for
wanting to "absorb" SWOPSI and SCIRE by
coming out with a second statement that
outlines in great detail how the autonomy of
these programs will be ended, and how
control over them will be given to the Office
of Undergraduate Studies.
Organizational Changes
Why place SWOPSI under the control of a
"Special Agency"? At present SWOPSI is run
by a "Special Joint Agency." The only
difference is simply that it is a JOINT
agency, administered both by Gibbs' office
and by the SWOPSI Policy Board. The only
change Gibbs is suggesting is an
organizational one.
Gibbs has been more than frank in his
discussions with Wayne Sachs, a Stanford
sophomore. He told Sachs that "it's a
question of streamlining the administration."
When pushed he stated that under the

Jomes Lobsenz

present system, decisions concerning SWOPSI
and SCIRE consume a great deal of his staff's
time, and that it keeps them "from doing
things that are innovative." Is it necessary to
absorb an innovative, partially student-run
program in order to do things that are
innovative?
Gibbs mentioned to Sachs that even if the
ASSU agreed to fund the entire SWOPSI
program, and even if the exact same
governmental structure (the Policy Board)
for administering SWOPSI was maintained,
he would not be in favor of recommending
that SWOPSI courses receive University
credit. Later, in a telephone talk with me
Gibbs said he did not mean to say this.
Gibbs certainly cannot be faulted for
having such concern, and should be
commended for it. But he is to be faulted for
having failed to mention this issue, which is
at the heart of his true rationale. The issue of
the academic quality of SWOPSI courses has
not been raised, perhaps intentionally,
perhaps unintentionally.
But therein lies the real debate. I am
willing to affirm that SWOPSI courses meet
very high academic standards. I hope that
this issue, the true issue, can now finally be
discussed.
(James Lobsenz, a graduate student in
political science, covered SWOPSI for two
years as a Daily reporter.)
