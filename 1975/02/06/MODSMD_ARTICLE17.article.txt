## Bug Me 
### Potty Fels 
My fiancee and I are engaged in a
controversy concerning the
Beatles. She claims that she read
some time ago that girls attending
lieatle concerts occasionally
experienced orgasm just from
watching the performance. I am
skeptical about this. Please clarify
the issue if possible. —8.8.
Dr. Donald Lunde, assistant
professor of psychiatry and one of
the famed pair teaching Human
Sexuality each year, said that
experiencing orgasm in a state of
excitement was definitely
possible, even without physical
stimulation.
"Some women have reported
experiencing orgasm while
watching a bullfight," Lunde
noted. "With those concerts, it
may be a combination of physical
stimulation [rocking back and
forth to the rhythm of the music
or dancing | in addition to the
purely sensual aspect.
"I don't know whether it's ever
happened at a Beatles concert, but

it certainly wouldn't surprise me."
*****
Whom should I contact if my
National Linen Service
representative is a drooling,
sniveling idiot? —G.G.
You should call the National
Linen Service office in San
Francisco, and ask for the service
department. The number is
621-4514.
*****
I regularly get ripped-off by the
stamp machines in the front wall
of the Post Office, or they don't
work when I need a stamp on the
weekend. Can't something be
done about this? —G.S.
Probably not. William DeMers,
supervisor of the Stanford branch
of the Post Office, said that the
stamp machine is fed foreign coins
or pennies at least twice a day.
This clogs it up so it must be
repaired. And there's no one there
to repair it on weekends.
The Post Office has tried
putting signs on the machines, but

An Orgasm From A Beatles Concert?

to no avail, according to DeMers.
"They |the students) don't seem
to care," he said. "Either that or
they can't read. I don't know."
So aside from putting armed
guards around the machines,
instructed to shoot violators on
sight, there seems to be no
solution.

Guest speaker Gene Roddenberry
was advertised so profusely with
hundreds of pamphlets and KZSU
broadcasts that half the
community of Palo Alto came to
the "Star Trek" program.
Students, the actual financers of
the guest speakers, were turned
away. Why did the ASSLJ make
such a foolish blunder? —J.F.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is
heartily sorry for the "Star Trek"
incident and pleads ignorance.
"We've had no problem at all
accommodating the outside
community and the Stanford
community at these events
before," said Andrew Leuchter,

director of the Speakers Bureau
"With the Roddenberry event, we
had no way of predicting that
we'd have such a vast overflow.
We thought that Mem Aud would
be full but not that full."
There is now a new policy on
Speakers Bun>au events, according
to Leuchter. Up until 15 minutes
before the event begins, only
Stanford students will be seated.
After that, anyone can go in.
The procedure was put into
effect at the Chris Miller speech
last night. Identifications were
checked and only students with
proper Stanford ID were admitted
until just before the program
began.
Fortunately, for those who did
not have Stanford ID, there was
enough room to accommodate all
interested degenerates.
Leuchter also promised that,
should subsequent events become
overcrowded, the Speakers Bureau
would put loudspeakers outside.

I regularly get ripped-off by the

done about this? —G.S.
Probably not. William DeMers,
supervisor of the Stanford branch
of the Post Office, said that the
stamp machine is fed foreign coins
or pennies at least twice a day.
This clogs it up so it must be
repaired. And there's no one there
to repair it on weekends.

to no avail, according to DeMers.
"They |the students) don't seem

they can't read. I don't know."
So aside from putting armed
guards around the machines,

Guest speaker Gene Roddenberry
was advertised so profusely with
hundreds of pamphlets and KZSU
broadcasts that half the
community of Palo Alto came to
the "Star Trek" program.
Students, the actual financers of
the guest speakers, were turned
away. Why did the ASSLJ make
such a foolish blunder? —J.F.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is
heartily sorry for the "Star Trek"
incident and pleads ignorance.
"We've had no problem at all
accommodating the outside
community and the Stanford
community at these events
before," said Andrew Leuchter,

director of the Speakers Bureau
"With the Roddenberry event, we
had no way of predicting that
we'd have such a vast overflow.
We thought that Mem Aud would
be full but not that full."
There is now a new policy on
Speakers Bun>au events, according
to Leuchter. Up until 15 minutes
before the event begins, only
Stanford students will be seated.
After that, anyone can go in.
The procedure was put into
effect at the Chris Miller speech
last night. Identifications were
checked and only students with
proper Stanford ID were admitted
until just before the program
began.
Fortunately, for those who did
not have Stanford ID, there was
enough room to accommodate all
interested degenerates.
Leuchter also promised that,
should subsequent events become
overcrowded, the Speakers Bureau
would put loudspeakers outside.

HOW MANY ORGASMS HERE?—These Stanford students attending a Loggins and Messina concert look
innocent enough, but they could be having surreptitious orgasms. Dr. Donald Lunde explains how in
today's "Bug Me."

My fiancee and I are engaged in a
controversy concerning the
Beatles. She claims that she read
some time ago that girls attending
lieatle concerts occasionally
experienced orgasm just from
watching the performance. I am
skeptical about this. Please clarify
the issue if possible. —8.8.
Dr. Donald Lunde, assistant
professor of psychiatry and one of
the famed pair teaching Human
Sexuality each year, said that
experiencing orgasm in a state of
excitement was definitely
possible, even without physical
stimulation.
"Some women have reported
experiencing orgasm while
watching a bullfight," Lunde
noted. "With those concerts, it
may be a combination of physical
stimulation [rocking back and
forth to the rhythm of the music
or dancing | in addition to the
purely sensual aspect.
"I don't know whether it's ever
happened at a Beatles concert, but

it certainly wouldn't surprise me."
