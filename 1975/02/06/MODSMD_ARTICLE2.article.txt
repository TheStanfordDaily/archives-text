# Financial Manager, Special Events Director
## Herman Pushes Full-Time Posts 
### VLAE KERSHNER PHILIP FEDER 
ASSU President Mike Herman
proposed yesterday that the ASSU
hire Dave Martin as full-time financial
manager and Danny Scher as full-time
special events director.
Both posts are currently held by
students. Scher, a business school
student, is now special events director,
while Martin was student financial
manager in 1973-74.
Herman's plan, backed by current
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri, met
with opposition from the ASSU
Senate last night. After an hour of
stormy debate, the Senate voted 7-5 to
table discussion of the proposal until
next Wednesday's meeting.
Conditions For Post
Herman proposed that Scher be
given a full-time job at the end of the
year, subject to several conditions:
—that the ASSU hire a full-time
financial manager, because "the office
dynamics of having a full-time [special
events] manager responsible to a
part-time financial manager could
prove disastrous."
—that Scher's contract be
renegotiated annually.
—that an assistant special events
director (a student) be hired.
—that Scher not be allowed to
promote concerts within boundaries
"which contain 'Stanford crowds',
most likely between San Jose and
Berkeley."
'Commensurate' Salary
Scher, told of the conditions by the
Daily last night, said he thought

Martin would make an excellent
financial manager, but objected to the
condition limiting his promotion area.
"I'd have to think about it." Scher
said. "If there are restrictions, the
salary should be commensurate."
Scher indicated he would want his
salary and commissions tr> give him an
income "of at least the median" for
Stanford Business School graduates, or
about $17,500 annually.
Olivieri told the Senate that the
proposed starting salary for both
Martin and Scher would be "on the
upper end," of a bracket from
$14,000 to $18,000, and noted ihat
the salaries would increase annually.
Olivieri's salary is $6500.
Scher's salary would be contained
in the Special Events budget, Olivieri
said, while Martin would be paid out
of the $92,000 appropriation which
the University annually grants the
ASSU.
Sen. Robert Nelson challenged this
proposal. "Can we afford this? This
year we're rolling in coin but this
could be a fluke year. Would we be
buying ourselves out of business?"
Another senator, Janice Haney,
objected to linking the Martin and
Scher hirings. "We're creating a series
Of jobs so one person [Scher] can stay
at the University," she said.
Sen. William Hoke agreed, saying it
was wrong to consider hiring anyone
full-time "until we have our directions
and goals set."
The Senate must approve the
selection of the financial manager, and
Herman said it should do so by Feb.
15. In order for Martin to be hired, the
Senate must also send an amendment
to the ASSU Constitution to the
student body for ratification.
Under existing ASSU laws, the
financial manager must be a student.
Herman Disappointed
Herman said he was disappointed
that the Senate failed to give him a
"vote of confidence" on his proposal.
He added that he would continue
negotiations with Martin and Scher
despite the Senate's inaction.
Martin is currently a senior
financial analyst for Xerox Corp. in
New York. Herman said that h. has
the power to hire Martin as an
"agent," but noted that Martin would
not want to leave his Xerox job unless
the Senate gave Martin some assurance

he could hold the ASSU position
permanently.
Both Herman and Olivieri strongly
recommended Martin for the full-time
post. Herman said that Martin "did as
much for the ASSU as Scher did for
special events — he completely turned
the operation around."
In other action, the Senate:
—voted 6-5 to hold a student
referendum on plans to change the
grading system from a "record of
achievement," to an "historical
reocrd." The date for the referendum
has not been set, but it will probably
be held within the next two to three
weeks.
—unanimously ratified the Guest

Professor Board's invitation to Dr.
Hermann Schwember so that he may
attempt to leave Chile, where he is
under arrest, and come to Stanford to
teach spring quarter.
—passed two resolutions opposing
the Committee on Student Services'
(COSS) Housing Subcommittee
proposal on grounds that it
discriminates against fraternities and
women.
-invited Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James L. Gibbs and Provost
William F. Miller to answer questions
at next Wednesday's meeting on the
possible scuttling of SWOPSI, SCIRE
and the Urban Studies and
Undergraduate Writing Programs.

negotiations with Martin and Scher
despite the Senate's inaction.
Martin is currently a senior
financial analyst for Xerox Corp. in
New York. Herman said that h. has
the power to hire Martin as an
"agent," but noted that Martin would
not want to leave his Xerox job unless
the Senate gave Martin some assurance

he could hold the ASSU position
permanently.
Both Herman and Olivieri strongly
recommended Martin for the full-time
post. Herman said that Martin "did as
much for the ASSU as Scher did for
special events — he completely turned
the operation around."
In other action, the Senate:
—voted 6-5 to hold a student
referendum on plans to change the
grading system from a "record of
achievement," to an "historical
reocrd." The date for the referendum
has not been set, but it will probably
be held within the next two to three
weeks.
—unanimously ratified the Guest

Professor Board's invitation to Dr.
Hermann Schwember so that he may
attempt to leave Chile, where he is
under arrest, and come to Stanford to
teach spring quarter.
—passed two resolutions opposing
the Committee on Student Services'
(COSS) Housing Subcommittee
proposal on grounds that it
discriminates against fraternities and
women.
-invited Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James L. Gibbs and Provost
William F. Miller to answer questions
at next Wednesday's meeting on the
possible scuttling of SWOPSI, SCIRE
and the Urban Studies and

ASSU President Mike Herman
proposed yesterday that the ASSU
hire Dave Martin as full-time financial
manager and Danny Scher as full-time
special events director.
Both posts are currently held by
students. Scher, a business school
student, is now special events director,
while Martin was student financial
manager in 1973-74.
Herman's plan, backed by current
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri, met
with opposition from the ASSU
Senate last night. After an hour of
stormy debate, the Senate voted 7-5 to
table discussion of the proposal until
next Wednesday's meeting.
Conditions For Post
Herman proposed that Scher be
given a full-time job at the end of the
year, subject to several conditions:
—that the ASSU hire a full-time
financial manager, because "the office
dynamics of having a full-time [special
events] manager responsible to a
part-time financial manager could
prove disastrous."
—that Scher's contract be
renegotiated annually.
—that an assistant special events
director (a student) be hired.
—that Scher not be allowed to
promote concerts within boundaries
"which contain 'Stanford crowds',
most likely between San Jose and
Berkeley."
'Commensurate' Salary
Scher, told of the conditions by the
Daily last night, said he thought

Martin would make an excellent
financial manager, but objected to the
condition limiting his promotion area.
"I'd have to think about it." Scher
said. "If there are restrictions, the
salary should be commensurate."
Scher indicated he would want his
salary and commissions tr> give him an
income "of at least the median" for
Stanford Business School graduates, or
about $17,500 annually.
Olivieri told the Senate that the
proposed starting salary for both
Martin and Scher would be "on the
upper end," of a bracket from
$14,000 to $18,000, and noted ihat
the salaries would increase annually.
Olivieri's salary is $6500.
Scher's salary would be contained
in the Special Events budget, Olivieri
said, while Martin would be paid out
of the $92,000 appropriation which
the University annually grants the
ASSU.
Sen. Robert Nelson challenged this
proposal. "Can we afford this? This
year we're rolling in coin but this
could be a fluke year. Would we be
buying ourselves out of business?"
Another senator, Janice Haney,
objected to linking the Martin and
Scher hirings. "We're creating a series
Of jobs so one person [Scher] can stay
at the University," she said.
Sen. William Hoke agreed, saying it
was wrong to consider hiring anyone
full-time "until we have our directions
and goals set."
The Senate must approve the
selection of the financial manager, and
Herman said it should do so by Feb.
15. In order for Martin to be hired, the
Senate must also send an amendment
to the ASSU Constitution to the
student body for ratification.
Under existing ASSU laws, the
financial manager must be a student.

Martin and Scher would be "on the
upper end," of a bracket from
$14,000 to $18,000, and noted ihat
the salaries would increase annually.
Olivieri's salary is $6500.
Scher's salary would be contained
in the Special Events budget, Olivieri
said, while Martin would be paid out
of the $92,000 appropriation which
the University annually grants the
ASSU.
Sen. Robert Nelson challenged this
proposal. "Can we afford this? This
year we're rolling in coin but this
could be a fluke year. Would we be
buying ourselves out of business?"
Another senator, Janice Haney,
objected to linking the Martin and
Scher hirings. "We're creating a series
Of jobs so one person [Scher] can stay
at the University," she said.
Sen. William Hoke agreed, saying it
was wrong to consider hiring anyone
full-time "until we have our directions
and goals set."
The Senate must approve the
selection of the financial manager, and
Herman said it should do so by Feb.
15. In order for Martin to be hired, the
Senate must also send an amendment
to the ASSU Constitution to the
student body for ratification.
Under existing ASSU laws, the
financial manager must be a student.
Herman Disappointed
Herman said he was disappointed
that the Senate failed to give him a
"vote of confidence" on his proposal.
He added that he would continue
negotiations with Martin and Scher
despite the Senate's inaction.
Martin is currently a senior
financial analyst for Xerox Corp. in
New York. Herman said that h. has
the power to hire Martin as an
"agent," but noted that Martin would
not want to leave his Xerox job unless
the Senate gave Martin some assurance

he could hold the ASSU position
permanently.
Both Herman and Olivieri strongly
recommended Martin for the full-time
post. Herman said that Martin "did as
much for the ASSU as Scher did for
special events — he completely turned
the operation around."
In other action, the Senate:
—voted 6-5 to hold a student
referendum on plans to change the
grading system from a "record of
achievement," to an "historical
reocrd." The date for the referendum
has not been set, but it will probably
be held within the next two to three
weeks.
—unanimously ratified the Guest

Professor Board's invitation to Dr.
Hermann Schwember so that he may
attempt to leave Chile, where he is
under arrest, and come to Stanford to
teach spring quarter.
—passed two resolutions opposing
the Committee on Student Services'
(COSS) Housing Subcommittee
proposal on grounds that it
discriminates against fraternities and
women.
-invited Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James L. Gibbs and Provost
William F. Miller to answer questions
at next Wednesday's meeting on the
possible scuttling of SWOPSI, SCIRE
and the Urban Studies and
Undergraduate Writing Programs.
