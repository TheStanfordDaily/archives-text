# Jazz Stars To Play
## 
### 
An all-star group consisting of
Freddie Hubbard, trumpet,
McCoy Tyner, piano, Rahsaan
Roland Kirk, saxophones, Ron
Carter, bass, and Elvin Jones,
drums, will perform for one night
only, February 17, at Oakland's
Paramount Theater.
Calling themselves the "Black
Classical Music Society" for the
occasion, the musicians will give
their show as a benefit for San
Francisco's Keystone Korner
nightclub, so that the club can
continue to present jazz
performers.
All five members of the group
lead their own bands, and all have
appeared at the Keystone this
year. Jones and his quintet are
currently performing there.
Hubbard, Tyner, Kirk and
Carter are winners of the Down
Beat magazine readers' poll for
performances on their

instruments, and Jones' drumming
gained him first place in the same
magazine's critics' poll.
Although the five have never
played together before in public,
each player has a long history of
jazz stardom. Jones and Tyner
were members of the early-sixties
John Coltrane Quartet, and
Hubbard also played with
Coltrane.
Carter got wide exposure as a
member of Miles Davis' group;
Kirk has played with Charles
Mingus.
Tickets for the Society's
concert are available at BASS
outlets.
