House Votes To Halt Oil Tariff
WASHINGTON - Challenging President Ford's
energy program and bidding for time to construct
its own, the Democratic-dominated House voted
yesterday 309 — 114 to halt Ford's tariff on
imported oil.
The bill the House passed and sent to the Senate
would suspend for 90 days the authority Ford
claims to impose by presidential order a $3 a barrel
tax on foreign oil. The $1 tax imposed Feb. 1, the
first of three planned increments, would be
cancelled.
Ford is expected to veto the bill if it clears the
Senate.
The vote by which the House passed the bill was
greater than the two-thirds that would be required
to override a veto. Forty-two Republicans joined
267 Democrats to pass the bill.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron Nessen
yesterday announced briefing that Ford will run for
a full term in 1976 regardless of economic
conditions at that time. Nessen thus expanded on
Ford's statement at a Tuesday news conference that
"I think the economic circumstances will be good
enough to justify at least my seeking re-election."
Congress Fixes Food Stamp Price
WASHINGTON — Congress rejected President
Ford's plan to increase the price of food stamps and
voted yesterday to freeze the price for the rest of
this year.
It was the first legislative action completed by
the 94th Congress.
The Senat<- passed the bill 76-8 and sent it to
Ford only a few hours after its Agriculture
Committee approved it without hearings. The House
had passed it Tuesday 374-38.
The Senate also approved a resolution, which
needs no further action, directing Secretary of
Agriculture Earl L. Butz to make recommendations
by June 30 on ways to improve and reform the
program. The resolution was urged by Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kan.).
Freezing the prices at the Jan. 1 level would kill
the administration's plan to save $648 million a year
by making all recipients after March 1 pay the legal
maximum of 30 percent of their adjusted net
income for the coupons.
Levi Confirmed As Atty. Gen.
WASHINGTON - Edward H. Levi, a legal
scholar and university president who has isolated
himself from political parties for 30 years, was
confirmed by the Senate yesterday as the nation's
71st attorney general.

The Senate approved President Ford's
nomination of Levi by a voice vote without dissent.
The 63-year-old president of the University of
Chicago succeeds William B. Saxbe, who was sworn
in Monday as ambassador to India. Levi probably
will be sworn into office in a ceremony tomorrow at
the White House, Justice Department officials said.
Despite initial dismay from some conservative
senators, Ford's first Cabinet nominee encountered
no serious opposition during three days of Senate
Judiciary Committee hearings.
During the hearings, liberal senators pressed Levi
for his positions on enforcing antitrust laws against
business monopolies and price-fixing practices, the
death penalty, gun control laws, as well as FBI
wiretapping and surveillance practices.
On many questions, Levi refused to give firm
commitments about the policies he will follow as
head of.the Justice Department.
Auto Workers Rally For Jobs
WASHINGTON — Ten thousand auto workers
rallied here yesterday to demand jobs now and
threatened to come back a quarter-million strong if
the government does not take immediate action to
cut unemployment.
Chanting "We want jobs," they shouted and
stomped their approval, as United Auto Workers
(UAW) Union leaders and a handful of congressional
Democrats called for strong economic medicine to
end the recession and put people back to work.
Most protesters were unemployed rank-and-file
workers from auto plants across the country.
UAW President Leonard Woodcock noted that
nearly 300,000 of his union members are out of
work and said that Ford's budget with its forecast
of high unemployment of 1980 is "planned
recession for five long years."
Peru Cracks Down On Rioting
LIMA, Peru — Peru's military government
suspended individual rights yesterday, declared a
nationwide state of emergency and sent tanks into
the streets to back up tough security measures
against mounting civil disorder.
Russian-made T55 tanks, armored personnel
carriers and helicopters with sharpshooters were
deployed in downtown Lima to try to check
widespread looting and arson in public buildings.
The crisis — the worst for President Juan Velasco
since his military regime seized power six years ago
— began when large numbers of the 20.000 member
paramilitary Guardia Civil national police force
struck for higher pay Monday night. Demonstrators
later took to the streets to support them
Some Guardia troopers reappeared on the city

streets late yesterday, indicating a solution may
have been reached.
Central Peru was placed under a military security
command headed by an army general and
authorized to arrest people without warrant, search
premises, deport people and ban rallies and other
forms of public demonstrations.
EPA Urpes Offshore Oil Halt
WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has urged the Interior Department to
postpone for at least two years the opening of
untouched offshore areas for oil and gas leasing, and
to bar leasing off the Alaska coast indefinitely.
The EPA also sharply criticized the Interior
Department's preliminary study of the
environmental impacts of exploring and developing
these new "frontier areas" off the Atlantic Coast
and the coasts of California and Alaska.
In January 1974, then-President Richard M.
Nixon directed the Interior Department to lease 10
million offshore acres in 1975 — more than triple
the 1974 leasing schedule and 10 times the 1973
leasing rate.
Meanwhile, however, Interior Secretary Rogers
C. B. Morton and his energy aides have backed off
Nixon's 10-million-acre target, and now say they
intend to choose areas for leasing to achieve the
most effective exploration of the new areas.
Moretti Named To Energy Panel
SACRAMENTO — Bob Moretti, who gave up the
powerful Assembly speakership to try unsuccessfully
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, was
appointed to California's energy commission
yesterday by Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.
The governor also named Ronald D. Doctor, a
Rand Corp. expert in nuclear engineering, to
complete the five-member Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission.
Both appointments must be confirmed by the
Senate. The salary for each is $37,212 per year.
The new energy commission already shapes up as
one of the state's most potent bodies.
It controls such areas as the siting of electricity
generating plants, including nuclear-based, and
setting of energy conservation standards for all
electric appliances and new building construction.
Today's Weather
Increasing clouds today with rain likely
continuing at times through tomorrow. Slightly
warmer today. Lows tonight in mid 40s to low 50s.
Highs today and tomorrow in mid 50s to low 60s.
Chance of rain 70 percent today and tonight.

Department's preliminary study of the
environmental impacts of exploring and developing
these new "frontier areas" off the Atlantic Coast
and the coasts of California and Alaska.
In January 1974, then-President Richard M.
Nixon directed the Interior Department to lease 10
million offshore acres in 1975 — more than triple
the 1974 leasing schedule and 10 times the 1973
leasing rate.
Meanwhile, however, Interior Secretary Rogers
C. B. Morton and his energy aides have backed off
Nixon's 10-million-acre target, and now say they
intend to choose areas for leasing to achieve the
most effective exploration of the new areas.
Moretti Named To Energy Panel
SACRAMENTO — Bob Moretti, who gave up the
powerful Assembly speakership to try unsuccessfully
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, was
appointed to California's energy commission
yesterday by Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.
The governor also named Ronald D. Doctor, a
Rand Corp. expert in nuclear engineering, to
complete the five-member Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission.
Both appointments must be confirmed by the
Senate. The salary for each is $37,212 per year.
The new energy commission already shapes up as
one of the state's most potent bodies.
It controls such areas as the siting of electricity
generating plants, including nuclear-based, and
setting of energy conservation standards for all
electric appliances and new building construction.
Today's Weather
Increasing clouds today with rain likely
continuing at times through tomorrow. Slightly
warmer today. Lows tonight in mid 40s to low 50s.
Highs today and tomorrow in mid 50s to low 60s.
Chance of rain 70 percent today and tonight.
House Votes To Halt Oil Tariff
WASHINGTON - Challenging President Ford's
energy program and bidding for time to construct
its own, the Democratic-dominated House voted
yesterday 309 — 114 to halt Ford's tariff on
imported oil.
The bill the House passed and sent to the Senate
would suspend for 90 days the authority Ford
claims to impose by presidential order a $3 a barrel
tax on foreign oil. The $1 tax imposed Feb. 1, the
first of three planned increments, would be
cancelled.
Ford is expected to veto the bill if it clears the
Senate.
The vote by which the House passed the bill was
greater than the two-thirds that would be required
to override a veto. Forty-two Republicans joined
267 Democrats to pass the bill.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron Nessen
yesterday announced briefing that Ford will run for
a full term in 1976 regardless of economic
conditions at that time. Nessen thus expanded on
Ford's statement at a Tuesday news conference that
"I think the economic circumstances will be good
enough to justify at least my seeking re-election."
Congress Fixes Food Stamp Price
WASHINGTON — Congress rejected President
Ford's plan to increase the price of food stamps and
voted yesterday to freeze the price for the rest of
this year.
It was the first legislative action completed by
the 94th Congress.
The Senat<- passed the bill 76-8 and sent it to
Ford only a few hours after its Agriculture
Committee approved it without hearings. The House
had passed it Tuesday 374-38.
The Senate also approved a resolution, which
needs no further action, directing Secretary of
Agriculture Earl L. Butz to make recommendations
by June 30 on ways to improve and reform the
program. The resolution was urged by Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kan.).
Freezing the prices at the Jan. 1 level would kill
the administration's plan to save $648 million a year
by making all recipients after March 1 pay the legal
maximum of 30 percent of their adjusted net
income for the coupons.
Levi Confirmed As Atty. Gen.
WASHINGTON - Edward H. Levi, a legal
scholar and university president who has isolated
himself from political parties for 30 years, was
confirmed by the Senate yesterday as the nation's
71st attorney general.

The Senate approved President Ford's
nomination of Levi by a voice vote without dissent.
The 63-year-old president of the University of
Chicago succeeds William B. Saxbe, who was sworn
in Monday as ambassador to India. Levi probably
will be sworn into office in a ceremony tomorrow at
the White House, Justice Department officials said.
Despite initial dismay from some conservative
senators, Ford's first Cabinet nominee encountered
no serious opposition during three days of Senate
Judiciary Committee hearings.
During the hearings, liberal senators pressed Levi
for his positions on enforcing antitrust laws against
business monopolies and price-fixing practices, the
death penalty, gun control laws, as well as FBI
wiretapping and surveillance practices.
On many questions, Levi refused to give firm
commitments about the policies he will follow as
head of.the Justice Department.
Auto Workers Rally For Jobs
WASHINGTON — Ten thousand auto workers
rallied here yesterday to demand jobs now and
threatened to come back a quarter-million strong if
the government does not take immediate action to
cut unemployment.
Chanting "We want jobs," they shouted and
stomped their approval, as United Auto Workers
(UAW) Union leaders and a handful of congressional
Democrats called for strong economic medicine to
end the recession and put people back to work.
Most protesters were unemployed rank-and-file
workers from auto plants across the country.
UAW President Leonard Woodcock noted that
nearly 300,000 of his union members are out of
work and said that Ford's budget with its forecast
of high unemployment of 1980 is "planned
recession for five long years."
Peru Cracks Down On Rioting
LIMA, Peru — Peru's military government
suspended individual rights yesterday, declared a
nationwide state of emergency and sent tanks into
the streets to back up tough security measures
against mounting civil disorder.
Russian-made T55 tanks, armored personnel
carriers and helicopters with sharpshooters were
deployed in downtown Lima to try to check
widespread looting and arson in public buildings.
The crisis — the worst for President Juan Velasco
since his military regime seized power six years ago
— began when large numbers of the 20.000 member
paramilitary Guardia Civil national police force
struck for higher pay Monday night. Demonstrators
later took to the streets to support them
Some Guardia troopers reappeared on the city

streets late yesterday, indicating a solution may
have been reached.
Central Peru was placed under a military security
command headed by an army general and
authorized to arrest people without warrant, search
premises, deport people and ban rallies and other
forms of public demonstrations.
EPA Urpes Offshore Oil Halt
WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has urged the Interior Department to
postpone for at least two years the opening of
untouched offshore areas for oil and gas leasing, and
to bar leasing off the Alaska coast indefinitely.
The EPA also sharply criticized the Interior
Department's preliminary study of the
environmental impacts of exploring and developing
these new "frontier areas" off the Atlantic Coast

stomped their approval, as United Auto Workers
(UAW) Union leaders and a handful of congressional
Democrats called for strong economic medicine to
end the recession and put people back to work.
Most protesters were unemployed rank-and-file
workers from auto plants across the country.
UAW President Leonard Woodcock noted that
nearly 300,000 of his union members are out of
work and said that Ford's budget with its forecast
of high unemployment of 1980 is "planned
recession for five long years."
Peru Cracks Down On Rioting
LIMA, Peru — Peru's military government
suspended individual rights yesterday, declared a
nationwide state of emergency and sent tanks into
the streets to back up tough security measures
against mounting civil disorder.
Russian-made T55 tanks, armored personnel
carriers and helicopters with sharpshooters were
deployed in downtown Lima to try to check
widespread looting and arson in public buildings.
The crisis — the worst for President Juan Velasco
since his military regime seized power six years ago
— began when large numbers of the 20.000 member
paramilitary Guardia Civil national police force
struck for higher pay Monday night. Demonstrators
later took to the streets to support them
Some Guardia troopers reappeared on the city

streets late yesterday, indicating a solution may
have been reached.
Central Peru was placed under a military security
command headed by an army general and
authorized to arrest people without warrant, search
premises, deport people and ban rallies and other
forms of public demonstrations.
EPA Urpes Offshore Oil Halt
WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has urged the Interior Department to
postpone for at least two years the opening of
untouched offshore areas for oil and gas leasing, and
to bar leasing off the Alaska coast indefinitely.
The EPA also sharply criticized the Interior
Department's preliminary study of the
environmental impacts of exploring and developing
these new "frontier areas" off the Atlantic Coast
and the coasts of California and Alaska.
In January 1974, then-President Richard M.
Nixon directed the Interior Department to lease 10
million offshore acres in 1975 — more than triple
the 1974 leasing schedule and 10 times the 1973
leasing rate.
Meanwhile, however, Interior Secretary Rogers
C. B. Morton and his energy aides have backed off
Nixon's 10-million-acre target, and now say they
intend to choose areas for leasing to achieve the
most effective exploration of the new areas.
Moretti Named To Energy Panel
SACRAMENTO — Bob Moretti, who gave up the
powerful Assembly speakership to try unsuccessfully
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, was
appointed to California's energy commission
yesterday by Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.
The governor also named Ronald D. Doctor, a
Rand Corp. expert in nuclear engineering, to
complete the five-member Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission.
Both appointments must be confirmed by the
Senate. The salary for each is $37,212 per year.
The new energy commission already shapes up as
one of the state's most potent bodies.
It controls such areas as the siting of electricity
generating plants, including nuclear-based, and
setting of energy conservation standards for all
electric appliances and new building construction.
Today's Weather
Increasing clouds today with rain likely
continuing at times through tomorrow. Slightly
warmer today. Lows tonight in mid 40s to low 50s.
Highs today and tomorrow in mid 50s to low 60s.
Chance of rain 70 percent today and tonight.
House Votes To Halt Oil Tariff
WASHINGTON - Challenging President Ford's
energy program and bidding for time to construct
its own, the Democratic-dominated House voted
yesterday 309 — 114 to halt Ford's tariff on
imported oil.
The bill the House passed and sent to the Senate
would suspend for 90 days the authority Ford
claims to impose by presidential order a $3 a barrel
tax on foreign oil. The $1 tax imposed Feb. 1, the
first of three planned increments, would be
cancelled.
Ford is expected to veto the bill if it clears the
Senate.
The vote by which the House passed the bill was
greater than the two-thirds that would be required
to override a veto. Forty-two Republicans joined
267 Democrats to pass the bill.
Presidential Press Secretary Ron Nessen
yesterday announced briefing that Ford will run for
a full term in 1976 regardless of economic
conditions at that time. Nessen thus expanded on
Ford's statement at a Tuesday news conference that
"I think the economic circumstances will be good
enough to justify at least my seeking re-election."
Congress Fixes Food Stamp Price
WASHINGTON — Congress rejected President
Ford's plan to increase the price of food stamps and
voted yesterday to freeze the price for the rest of
this year.
It was the first legislative action completed by
the 94th Congress.
The Senat<- passed the bill 76-8 and sent it to
Ford only a few hours after its Agriculture
Committee approved it without hearings. The House
had passed it Tuesday 374-38.
The Senate also approved a resolution, which
needs no further action, directing Secretary of
Agriculture Earl L. Butz to make recommendations
by June 30 on ways to improve and reform the
program. The resolution was urged by Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kan.).
Freezing the prices at the Jan. 1 level would kill
the administration's plan to save $648 million a year
by making all recipients after March 1 pay the legal
maximum of 30 percent of their adjusted net
income for the coupons.
Levi Confirmed As Atty. Gen.
WASHINGTON - Edward H. Levi, a legal
scholar and university president who has isolated
himself from political parties for 30 years, was
confirmed by the Senate yesterday as the nation's
71st attorney general.

The Senate approved President Ford's
nomination of Levi by a voice vote without dissent.
The 63-year-old president of the University of
Chicago succeeds William B. Saxbe, who was sworn
in Monday as ambassador to India. Levi probably
will be sworn into office in a ceremony tomorrow at
the White House, Justice Department officials said.
Despite initial dismay from some conservative
senators, Ford's first Cabinet nominee encountered
no serious opposition during three days of Senate
Judiciary Committee hearings.
During the hearings, liberal senators pressed Levi
for his positions on enforcing antitrust laws against
business monopolies and price-fixing practices, the
death penalty, gun control laws, as well as FBI
wiretapping and surveillance practices.
On many questions, Levi refused to give firm
commitments about the policies he will follow as
head of.the Justice Department.
Auto Workers Rally For Jobs
WASHINGTON — Ten thousand auto workers
rallied here yesterday to demand jobs now and
threatened to come back a quarter-million strong if
the government does not take immediate action to
cut unemployment.

stomped their approval, as United Auto Workers
(UAW) Union leaders and a handful of congressional
Democrats called for strong economic medicine to
