### RON BECK 
Cutting out all overtime pay for
teachers in the San Francisco school
district "was a painful choice [for the
San Francisco School Board], but
something we had to do," Board
President Lucille Abrahamson told the
Daily last night.
"The superintendent of schools
gave the Board an emergency request
last week to finish the school year in
the black, financially," Abrahamson
said, "and we found it necessary to cut
back all non-contracted programs."
"We didn't cut off the sports
program," pointed out Abrahamson.
"We eliminated coaches' overtime pay,
not sports' money. We're hoping
coaches will restructure their time, so
that they won't require all the
overtime pay."
Abrahamson says that there still is
hope for the continuance of the sports
programs, noting that State Sen.
Milton Marks is introducing legislation
today that will require state funding
of the school district's after school sports.
If the bill passes within the week.
San Francisco schools' sports will go
uninterrupted. The Board's funding of
overtime pay for coaches doesn't stop
until next week.
"The budget cuts are only
temporary ," emphasized Abrahamson,
"and won't be in effect after spring."
"It's something we feel terrible
about, but our [the School Board's]
attorney ruled that it was necessary .
We had no choice."
