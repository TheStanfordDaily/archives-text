# Lyons Nixes Campus Sororities; 'Subjective Selectivity' Blamed
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
University officials would rather
deny fraternities the right to select
their members than grant proposed
sororities on campus such "subjective
selectivity" privileges, Dean of Student
Affairs James W. Lyons proclaimed
last night.
Lyons explained that the University
would "not like to see subjective
selectivity expanded" to any other
organizations other than the 12
fraternities now on campus.
He said he would disapprove of
establishing sororities or any more
fraternities on campus if the
organizations demanded the right to
choose their members selectively.
If students lodge a formal
complaint with the University,
charging that it discriminates against
women because it allows fraternities
on campus — but not sororities —
Lyons said, "We will deny subjective
selectivity rights completely."

The University Board of Trustees
banned sororities from campus in
1944, when women complained of the
extreme social pressure incurred
during rush. However, Lyons said the
ban could be lifted. His main objection
to sororities is the subjective
selectivity aspect.
Lyons remarked that he
disapproved of subjective selectivity
on philosophical grounds: "Students
should not be denied access to any
University facility except for objective
or educational reasons."
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton, objected to the aspect
of subjective selectivity which allows
fraternity members to allot housing,
"a very important and scarce
commodity," to students under
"vague and undetermined criteria."
Both Horton and Lyons said they
were not opposed to objective
standards for selectivity, however.

Lyons said that he considered
objective selectivity "making clear in
advance the criteria that are necessary
to participate in a certain group."
Lyons stated he would support a
sorority that used objective means for
choosing its members.
Inter- Fraternity President Mike
Nilsson stated that obliterating
subjective selectivity from fraternal
organizations would essentially
destroy them. "There is no such thing
as a fraternity without subjective
selectivity," he remarked.
Lyons disagreed, saying "Subjective
selectivity is not crucial to a
fraternity."
'Not Essential'
Horton also said subjective
selectivity is not an essential aspect of
fraternity life. However, he explained
that, in his recent proposal for a new
residential system he retained
subjective selectivity for fraternities
because fraternity members felt it was
so important.
Under the new proposal, which the
Committee On Student Services
(COSS) will submit to President
Richard Lyman for review today,
fraternity members retain their
subjective selectivity rights, but they
are forced to accomodate more
students in their fraternity than the
physical structure can hold.
As a result, fraternities would have
to establish off-campus annexes to
house the extra members. Also, all
students in the non-fraternity housing
draw will probably have to spend some
time off campus to be guaranteed
on-campus housing for three years.
Questions Interest
Proponents of the proposal claim it
establishes equal access to on-campus
housing because all students, fraternity
members and non-fraternity members,
will probably have to live off campus

for one year.
Lyons questioned establishing
sororities on campus because he said
he was "not aware of any marked
interest in students for sororities."
However, 20 women have attended
meetings to organize sororities, the
group's leader, Charlotte Christman,
remarked.
A national sorority, Alpha Phi, has
offered to supply funds to construct a
house here, Christman said. The
sorority is even prepared lo establish
an annex as is required for fraternities
under the proposal.

establishing sororities or any more
fraternities on campus if the
organizations demanded the right to
choose their members selectively.
If students lodge a formal
complaint with the University,
charging that it discriminates against
women because it allows fraternities
on campus — but not sororities —
Lyons said, "We will deny subjective
selectivity rights completely."

The University Board of Trustees
banned sororities from campus in
1944, when women complained of the
extreme social pressure incurred
during rush. However, Lyons said the
ban could be lifted. His main objection
to sororities is the subjective
selectivity aspect.
Lyons remarked that he
disapproved of subjective selectivity
on philosophical grounds: "Students
should not be denied access to any
University facility except for objective
or educational reasons."
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton, objected to the aspect
of subjective selectivity which allows
fraternity members to allot housing,
"a very important and scarce
commodity," to students under
"vague and undetermined criteria."
Both Horton and Lyons said they
were not opposed to objective
standards for selectivity, however.

Lyons said that he considered
objective selectivity "making clear in
advance the criteria that are necessary
to participate in a certain group."
Lyons stated he would support a
sorority that used objective means for
choosing its members.
Inter- Fraternity President Mike
Nilsson stated that obliterating
subjective selectivity from fraternal
organizations would essentially
destroy them. "There is no such thing
as a fraternity without subjective
selectivity," he remarked.
Lyons disagreed, saying "Subjective
selectivity is not crucial to a
fraternity."
'Not Essential'
Horton also said subjective
selectivity is not an essential aspect of
fraternity life. However, he explained
that, in his recent proposal for a new
residential system he retained
subjective selectivity for fraternities
because fraternity members felt it was
so important.
Under the new proposal, which the
Committee On Student Services
(COSS) will submit to President
Richard Lyman for review today,
fraternity members retain their
subjective selectivity rights, but they
are forced to accomodate more
students in their fraternity than the
physical structure can hold.
As a result, fraternities would have
to establish off-campus annexes to
house the extra members. Also, all
students in the non-fraternity housing
draw will probably have to spend some
time off campus to be guaranteed
on-campus housing for three years.
Questions Interest
Proponents of the proposal claim it
establishes equal access to on-campus
housing because all students, fraternity
members and non-fraternity members,
will probably have to live off campus

for one year.
Lyons questioned establishing
sororities on campus because he said
he was "not aware of any marked
interest in students for sororities."
However, 20 women have attended
meetings to organize sororities, the
group's leader, Charlotte Christman,
remarked.
A national sorority, Alpha Phi, has
offered to supply funds to construct a
house here, Christman said. The
sorority is even prepared lo establish
an annex as is required for fraternities
under the proposal.
University officials would rather
deny fraternities the right to select
their members than grant proposed
sororities on campus such "subjective
selectivity" privileges, Dean of Student
Affairs James W. Lyons proclaimed
last night.
Lyons explained that the University
would "not like to see subjective
selectivity expanded" to any other
organizations other than the 12
fraternities now on campus.
He said he would disapprove of
establishing sororities or any more
fraternities on campus if the
organizations demanded the right to
choose their members selectively.
