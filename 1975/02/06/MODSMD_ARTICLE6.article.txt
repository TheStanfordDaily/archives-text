# 'Too Blockish, Lack Continuity'
## Row House Plans Rejected 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Preliminary drawings for two of the
three proposed Row Houses were
returned to the architects for revision
last week because they were
"unharmunious with the basic
appearance of the Row," stated Ann
Carter, co-chairperson of the Student
Advisory Committee on Row Houses.
Criticizing the two proposed houses
as being "too blockish and lacking
continuity," the Committee asked for
a revision of the houses' exteriors.
"We had a major discussion
with the people involved and
essentially said, 'Let's see what we can
do to make these plans acceptable,'
explained Carter, also ASSU vice

president. "We're trying to get down
to specific problems now."
Architects for the project, the San
Francisco firm of Bull, Field,
Volkmann and Stockwell, are
scheduled to meet today with Carter
and the committee's other
co-chairperson David Garvin, to review
the revised plan. A number of
variations on the original proposals are
expected to be presented at the
meeting.
Complex Structures
The committee also criticized the
complexity of the structures.
"The basic complexity is too much
for us to feel that it's justified," stated
Senior University Planner Robert A.

Nerrie. "With the current concern of
everyone with money, it is difficult to
justify extreme complexity."
Nerrie noted that plans for houses
one and two are much more complex
than those for house three. "And the
[structural | breakups in number three
are more justifiable," added Nerrie.
Parking Problems
In a meeting yesterday, the
Committee also discussed the
proposed parking arrangements for
the new houses, and problems with
bicycle storage likely to be
encountered. General consensus was
that two separate parking lots, one
funnelling onto Mavfield Avenue and
