# Pub Board To Ask For Assessment
## 
### PATRICIA CLAPPISON 
The ASSU Publications Board
yesterday voted unanimously to ask
students this spring to approve a $1,
two-quarter fee assessment for next
year.
Board members said the assessment,
which would draw revenues totaling
about $20,000, would be used to help
support various student publications.
Some nine publications are currently
receiving aid from the Board this
quarter.
Sharply rising publication costs,
cutbacks in University aid and the fact
that its last assessment was three years
ago were cited as reasons for seeking
the levy.
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein
suggested that the Daily, if it seeks a
fee assessment for next year, be
included with the Pub Board.
Weinstein said he thought the Pub Board
proposal would have less trouble
obtaining approval if the Daily request
were attached.
If the Pub Board's assessment fails,
he noted, "there is really a danger of
large scale debts in publications next
year."
But Daily Business Manager Mike
Kuhl noted that the Daily's Board of
Directors has not yet decided whether
to seek an assessment — and Editor
Kevin Smith said he thought it
unlikely that the directors would want
to attach a Daily request to the Pub
Board's.
Pub Board Chairman Rich
Jaroslovsky, a former Daily editor,
added that "publications like the Daily
and the Quad are big enough boys now
that they should stand on their own
two feet."
The ASSU Course Review was
granted a seat on the Pub Board by
voice vote. ASSU Vice President Ann
Carter said that the Course Review was
a legitimate organization now and
needed to negotiate with the Board for
funds and permanent office space.
