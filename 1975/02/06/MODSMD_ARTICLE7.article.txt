# Pub Board To Ask For Assessment
## 
### PATRICIA CLAPPISON 
The ASSU Publications Board
yesterday voted unanimously to ask
students this spring to approve a $1,
two-quarter fee assessment for next
year.
Board members said the assessment,
which would draw revenues totaling
about $20,000, would be used to help
support various student publications.
Some nine publications are currently
receiving aid from the Board this
quarter.
Sharply rising publication costs,
cutbacks in University aid and the fact
that its last assessment was three years
ago were cited as reasons for seeking
the levy.
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein
suggested that the Daily, if it seeks a
fee assessment for next year, be
included with the Pub Board.
Weinstein said he thought the Pub Board
proposal would have less trouble
obtaining approval if the Daily request
were attached.
If the Pub Board's assessment fails,
he noted, "there is really a danger of
large scale debts in publications next
year."
But Daily Business Manager Mike
Kuhl noted that the Daily's Board of
Directors has not yet decided whether
to seek an assessment — and Editor
Kevin Smith said he thought it
unlikely that the directors would want
to attach a Daily request to the Pub
Board's.
Pub Board Chairman Rich
Jaroslovsky, a former Daily editor,
added that "publications like the Daily
and the Quad are big enough boys now
that they should stand on their own
two feet."
The ASSU Course Review was
granted a seat on the Pub Board by
voice vote. ASSU Vice President Ann
Carter said that the Course Review was
a legitimate organization now and
needed to negotiate with the Board for
funds and permanent office space.
the other onto Campus Drive, were
preferable to one largo, closed lot,
servicing all three houses.
Some committee n:embers
expressed concern that insufficient
space had been allocated for bicyJe
storage under the present proposal.
Stated Nerrie: "The space that has
been allocated now is something like
400 to 500 feet for general storage,
bike storage, laundry and for the
utility room." He estimated that this
space could hold possibly 20 bikes.
Bicycle Survey
The committee conducted an
informal survey last week to
determine the number of bicycles
kept inside each current Row house.
The results indicated that an average
of 15 are stored inside.
As the schedule now stands, the
sketches will go to the Land and

Buildings Committee of the Board of
Trustees for approval next Thursday.
In March, the proposals are slated to
be presented for final approval to the
full Board.
Foundations for the three houses
are expected to be laid in June.
Construction is slated to begin in
August. Scheduled completion date
for the project is September 1976.

kept inside each current Row house.
The results indicated that an average
of 15 are stored inside.
As the schedule now stands, the
sketches will go to the Land and

Buildings Committee of the Board of
Trustees for approval next Thursday.
In March, the proposals are slated to
be presented for final approval to the
full Board.
Foundations for the three houses
are expected to be laid in June.

The ASSU Publications Board
yesterday voted unanimously to ask
students this spring to approve a $1,
two-quarter fee assessment for next
year.
Board members said the assessment,
which would draw revenues totaling
about $20,000, would be used to help
support various student publications.
Some nine publications are currently
receiving aid from the Board this
quarter.
Sharply rising publication costs,
cutbacks in University aid and the fact
that its last assessment was three years
ago were cited as reasons for seeking
the levy.
Live Oak Editor Bill Weinstein
suggested that the Daily, if it seeks a
fee assessment for next year, be
included with the Pub Board.
Weinstein said he thought the Pub Board
proposal would have less trouble
obtaining approval if the Daily request
were attached.
If the Pub Board's assessment fails,
he noted, "there is really a danger of
large scale debts in publications next
year."
But Daily Business Manager Mike
Kuhl noted that the Daily's Board of
Directors has not yet decided whether
to seek an assessment — and Editor
Kevin Smith said he thought it
unlikely that the directors would want
to attach a Daily request to the Pub
Board's.
Pub Board Chairman Rich
Jaroslovsky, a former Daily editor,
added that "publications like the Daily
and the Quad are big enough boys now
that they should stand on their own
two feet."
The ASSU Course Review was
granted a seat on the Pub Board by
voice vote. ASSU Vice President Ann
Carter said that the Course Review was
a legitimate organization now and
needed to negotiate with the Board for
funds and permanent office space.
the other onto Campus Drive, were
preferable to one largo, closed lot,
servicing all three houses.
Some committee n:embers
expressed concern that insufficient
space had been allocated for bicyJe
storage under the present proposal.
Stated Nerrie: "The space that has
been allocated now is something like
400 to 500 feet for general storage,
bike storage, laundry and for the
utility room." He estimated that this
space could hold possibly 20 bikes.
Bicycle Survey
The committee conducted an
informal survey last week to
determine the number of bicycles
kept inside each current Row house.
The results indicated that an average
of 15 are stored inside.
As the schedule now stands, the
sketches will go to the Land and

Buildings Committee of the Board of
Trustees for approval next Thursday.
