# 'Lampoon' Humor: Oh So Gross!
## 
### GLENN GARVIN RALPH PETROFF 
It was vintage National Lampoon
humor — unbelievably gross and
almost painfully funny. And for an
hour and a half last night. Lampoon
editor Chris Miller kept an overflow
crowd numbering more than 400
reeling with hysterical laughter.
"The only thing I ever remember
anyone kind of drawing back from in
dismay was a thing on Shirley
Temple's breast cancer," Miller said,
explaining the Lampoon's theory of
humor. "You know, what a pair of
tit . . . "
One of the magazine's next projects
is a "199 th Birthday Book," Miller
said. "It's going to be about the
bicentennial. We're going to beat them
by a year.
"My section is the tit section. As
you probably know, America has more
tits per capita than any nation in the
world," Miller continued. "They've
been with us right from the
beginning." The section will include
pictures of immigrants getting off the
boat in New York and "finding that
the streets are paved with tits," he
said.
Uh — Unusual Parade
Another picture will show a
triumphant Charles Lindbergh
returning from his transatlantic flight
and "getting a ticker tit parade,"
Miller added.
"We hardly ever get sued. When
Mad was a good magazine, they used
to put on celebrities all the time. The

celebrities all sued, and then they
would have to tell the judge 'look
what they have about me in this comic
book,' " Miller said.
"Let's say we'd done a 'Mrs.
Agnew's Diary' where Spiro Agnew
picked his nose and ate it... So Spiro
Agnew reads this and gets mad. He's
going to go to court and say 'look,
they say I pick my nose and eat it?' "
So, few public figures have ever
taken on National Lampoon. "We
never heard from [Alabama Gov.
George] Wallace about feeding his
wife the cancerous rats," Miller said,
referring to a mock comic book in one
issue.
Puppies And Things
One public figure the magazine did
hear from was "Peanuts" creator
Charles Schulz, who didn't take kindly
to a parody entitled "Happiness Is A
Live Hand Grenade Inside a Dead
Puppy"—which featured, among other
things. Snoopy having diarrhea.
"Charles Schulz was not amused,"
Miller said happily. He said 'alright
you guys, I'm gonna sue.' We said
'come on Charlie, we won't do it
again. " The creators of the "Archie"
comic strip also expressed concern
about a parody that showed "Jughead
as a junkie (and] Veronica flopping
her tits around."
The most notorious lawsuit involved
a mock Volkswagen ad showing a VW
floating in water with the caption: "If
Teddy Kennedy had been driving a
Volkswagen, he might be president

Auditorium, and — uh, maybe you'd better just read the story to find out the
rest of it.
today." The National Lampoon finally
had to call back the issues containing
the ad.
Other times, readers react
unhappily to Lampoon material. Miller
read a letter from four soldiers in
Vietnam who said, in response to a
phony ad for "Lt. Calley's Kill The
Children Federation:" "If we ever
meet, your shit will be oh-so-flaky. We
would like to hang you and anyone
like you up and beat you with a big
stick until you can't walk. We think
you are sick in the head."
Miller also read three of his stories,
to wild applause and laughter from the
predominantly male audience. One
dealt with a college student's conquest
of the girl back home, one involved a
pornographic interlude with a
telephone, and the third was allegedly
written after Miller visited Stanford to
do a story on coed dorms.
It began: "Squee squee squee went
the bedsprings ..." and quickly
deteriorated into the totally
unprintable.
Miller won a standing ovation from
the Bishop Auditorium crowd at the
end of his speech.

Children Federation:" "If we ever
meet, your shit will be oh-so-flaky. We
would like to hang you and anyone
like you up and beat you with a big
stick until you can't walk. We think
you are sick in the head."
Miller also read three of his stories,
to wild applause and laughter from the
predominantly male audience. One
dealt with a college student's conquest
of the girl back home, one involved a
pornographic interlude with a
telephone, and the third was allegedly
written after Miller visited Stanford to
do a story on coed dorms.
It began: "Squee squee squee went
the bedsprings ..." and quickly
deteriorated into the totally
unprintable.
Miller won a standing ovation from
the Bishop Auditorium crowd at the
end of his speech.
It was vintage National Lampoon
humor — unbelievably gross and
almost painfully funny. And for an
hour and a half last night. Lampoon
editor Chris Miller kept an overflow
crowd numbering more than 400
reeling with hysterical laughter.
"The only thing I ever remember
anyone kind of drawing back from in
dismay was a thing on Shirley
Temple's breast cancer," Miller said,
explaining the Lampoon's theory of
humor. "You know, what a pair of
tit . . . "
One of the magazine's next projects
is a "199 th Birthday Book," Miller
said. "It's going to be about the
bicentennial. We're going to beat them
by a year.
"My section is the tit section. As
you probably know, America has more
tits per capita than any nation in the
world," Miller continued. "They've
been with us right from the
beginning." The section will include
pictures of immigrants getting off the
boat in New York and "finding that
the streets are paved with tits," he
said.
Uh — Unusual Parade
Another picture will show a
triumphant Charles Lindbergh
returning from his transatlantic flight
and "getting a ticker tit parade,"
Miller added.
"We hardly ever get sued. When
Mad was a good magazine, they used
to put on celebrities all the time. The

celebrities all sued, and then they
would have to tell the judge 'look
what they have about me in this comic
book,' " Miller said.
"Let's say we'd done a 'Mrs.
Agnew's Diary' where Spiro Agnew
picked his nose and ate it... So Spiro
Agnew reads this and gets mad. He's
going to go to court and say 'look,
they say I pick my nose and eat it?' "
So, few public figures have ever
taken on National Lampoon. "We
never heard from [Alabama Gov.
George] Wallace about feeding his
wife the cancerous rats," Miller said,
referring to a mock comic book in one
issue.
Puppies And Things
One public figure the magazine did
hear from was "Peanuts" creator
Charles Schulz, who didn't take kindly
to a parody entitled "Happiness Is A
Live Hand Grenade Inside a Dead
Puppy"—which featured, among other
things. Snoopy having diarrhea.
"Charles Schulz was not amused,"
Miller said happily. He said 'alright
you guys, I'm gonna sue.' We said
'come on Charlie, we won't do it
again. " The creators of the "Archie"
comic strip also expressed concern
about a parody that showed "Jughead
as a junkie (and] Veronica flopping
her tits around."
The most notorious lawsuit involved
a mock Volkswagen ad showing a VW
floating in water with the caption: "If
Teddy Kennedy had been driving a
