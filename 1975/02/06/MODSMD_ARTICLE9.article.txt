## Opinions editorial Retain SCIRE 
### 
History Prof. Gordon Craig, chairman of the Faculty
Senate, said last week that he had been told Provost William
Miller would recommend to the Faculty Senate today that
the SCIRE program be extended past June.
According to this plan, no decision would be made on
whether to abolish SCIRE and other non-departmental
programs until a thorough investigation is conducted during
the 1975-76 academic year.
While Miller has not confirmed that he has decided to
make such a recommendation, we think an extension and
review of the programs would be beneficial.
It is possible that departments could assume SCIRE's
functions, or that innovative programs could be consolidated
into an Undergraduate Special Agency (which bears the
awkward appellation UNGRASPEL).
But, at this time, how can we know that departments will
be sufficiently interested in fostering independent research
and innovative education to do as good a job as SCIRE docs,
or could, do?
How can we know that UNGRASPEL will not face the
same problems as its predecessor programs, and differ from
SCIRE only in possessing a bigger bureaucracy?
We recommend that a committee consisting of qualified
faculty, students and administration be formed to try to
answer these questions.
Rather than making a hasty decision to scrap SCIRE in
favor of the unknown, we think the University should retain
the program for one more year. It would thus be in a
position to intelligently house a program that would
combine innovation with efficiency.
