# Miller Says No Decision On SCIRE
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Provost William Miller told the
Faculty Senate yesterday he still has
not decided the fate of the Student
Center for Innovation Research and
Education (SCIRE), that he
is studying recommendations from
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
History Prof. Gordon Craig, the
Faculty Senate chairman, said last
week that "informed sources" had
told him Miller would announce at the
Senate meeting that SCIRE would not
be discontinued in June.
Craig was ill last night and
unavailable for comment.
Earlier this quarter, Gibbs proposed
that SCIRE be eliminated this June
and that its functions be distributed
among various academic departments.
'Assimilation' Urged
Under questioning from ASSU
Senate Chairman Lee Rosenbaum,
Gibbs reiterated his suggestion that
projects now sponsored by SCIRE, the
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) and
Undergraduate Specials could be
"assimilated" into a new innovative
education program here.
Miller also said he would postpone
consideration of the fate of SWOPSI
until next academic year. Gibbs had
recommended that SWOPSI be
abolished after June, 1976.
Gibbs told faculty representatives
that he had proposed consolidation of
the programs not to reduce
budget-based costs, but to reduce
administrative costs. The programs are
currently funded from reserve funds in
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
office.
Universal Evaluation
In other action, the Senate referred
to two different Academic Council
committees a report from the ASSU
Course Review policy board seeking a
universal course evaluation form. The
Senate directed the Course Review's
recommendations to both the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) and the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(C-AAA).
Speaking for the Course Review,
ASSU Vice President Ann Carter
stressed that the present number of
course evaluation forms leads to
"unnecessary duplication of efforts"
and that the ASSU's form is "the only
form that can be used universally."
Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Hans
Andersen answered Carter, saying,
"There is presently a large reluctance
on the part of some faculty to use
forms at all [in evaluating teaching]."
"Use of a single form could block

the evaluation of teaching as much as
promote it,"he continued. Andersen
chairs the C-AAA subcommittee on
the evaluation of teaching.
The Senate also heard an emotional
statement from co-terminal siudent
John Fischer urging that faculty
members "scrutinize" the decision not
to grant tenure to Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish.
Fischer emphasized Irish's personal
"courage, commitment and
excellence," adding that his dismissal
"telegraphs a clear message to students
and faculty, particularly junior
faculty" that the University considers
excellence in teaching secondary to
excellence in research.

"There is presently a large reluctance
on the part of some faculty to use
forms at all [in evaluating teaching]."
"Use of a single form could block

the evaluation of teaching as much as
promote it,"he continued. Andersen
chairs the C-AAA subcommittee on
the evaluation of teaching.
The Senate also heard an emotional
statement from co-terminal siudent
John Fischer urging that faculty
members "scrutinize" the decision not
to grant tenure to Asst. Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish.
Fischer emphasized Irish's personal
"courage, commitment and
excellence," adding that his dismissal
"telegraphs a clear message to students
and faculty, particularly junior
faculty" that the University considers
excellence in teaching secondary to
excellence in research.
Provost William Miller told the
Faculty Senate yesterday he still has
not decided the fate of the Student
Center for Innovation Research and
Education (SCIRE), that he
is studying recommendations from
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
History Prof. Gordon Craig, the
Faculty Senate chairman, said last
week that "informed sources" had
told him Miller would announce at the
Senate meeting that SCIRE would not
be discontinued in June.
Craig was ill last night and
unavailable for comment.
Earlier this quarter, Gibbs proposed
that SCIRE be eliminated this June
and that its functions be distributed
among various academic departments.
'Assimilation' Urged
Under questioning from ASSU
Senate Chairman Lee Rosenbaum,
Gibbs reiterated his suggestion that
projects now sponsored by SCIRE, the
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) and
Undergraduate Specials could be
"assimilated" into a new innovative
education program here.
Miller also said he would postpone
consideration of the fate of SWOPSI
until next academic year. Gibbs had
recommended that SWOPSI be
abolished after June, 1976.
Gibbs told faculty representatives
that he had proposed consolidation of
the programs not to reduce
budget-based costs, but to reduce
administrative costs. The programs are
currently funded from reserve funds in
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
office.
Universal Evaluation
In other action, the Senate referred
to two different Academic Council
committees a report from the ASSU
Course Review policy board seeking a
universal course evaluation form. The
Senate directed the Course Review's
recommendations to both the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) and the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(C-AAA).
Speaking for the Course Review,
ASSU Vice President Ann Carter
stressed that the present number of
course evaluation forms leads to
"unnecessary duplication of efforts"
and that the ASSU's form is "the only
form that can be used universally."
Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Hans
Andersen answered Carter, saying,
"There is presently a large reluctance
on the part of some faculty to use
forms at all [in evaluating teaching]."
"Use of a single form could block

the evaluation of teaching as much as
