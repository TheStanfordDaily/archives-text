# Fordonomics Assure President's Downfall
## 
### 
At President Ford's news
conference in Atlanta earlier this
week, two reporters questioned
him about a rather gaping chink in
his re-election armor.
Would the state of the
economy in 1976, they wanted to
know, affect his decision to seek a
full, elected term as President?
After hemming and hawing in
his usual decisive manner, Fold
concluded, "I think the economic
circumstances will be good
enough to justify at least my
seeking re-election."
He told the reporters — and the
nation — that "unemployment
will be going down and
employment will be going up and
we will be doing a considerable
amount better in the battle
against inflation than we did in
the last 12 months."

Stephen Carter

In truth, Ford's economic
assessment is probably accurate.
What he neglected to mention,
however, was how bad things will
get before then. After all,
recovery from a negative status
can just leave a zero.
Ruinous Budget
Ford's own budget, submitted
to Congress the day before the
press conference, ruins his
prediction of how good things will
be.
According to Office of
Management and Budget (OMB)
figures contained therein, the
consumer price index will rise
11.3 percent in 1975. All right,
for 1976, OMB predicts the index
will rise "only" 7.8 percent.
But campaigning will go on all
during 1976. People will
remember only that everything
costs a lot more "now" (1976)
than it did in the "good old days"
(1973). By the OMB predictions,
inflation won't fall past the "good
old" 1973 figure of 6.2 percent
until 1978. In case the President
has forgotten, the election will be
two years gone by the time those
figures are announced.
Recession Won't End
Well, maybe while inflation
rises, the recession will end. The
OMB, however, doesn't seem to
agree. Ford's economists admit —
albeit grudgingly — that
unemployment will hit 8.1
percent next year. (That compares
with the 5.6 percent figure for
fiscal 1974.)
In the election year 1976,
unemployment will be dropping,
just as the President said — it will
fall from 8.1 to a "mere" 7.9
percent, and will tumble all the
way to 7.5 percent the following
year. In fact, if Ford gains his
elected term of office, then just as

he is leaving in 1980, according to
OMB, unemployment will be
merely as bad as it is now!
Of course, none of this is lost
on any of the several dozen
politicians who currently want
badly to replace Ford in 1976.
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), a
declared candidate for the
Democratic presidential
nomination, swiftly lambasted the
budget proposal as "a bloated,
saddening document replete with
monumentally misplaced
priorities reflecting a sorry
insensitivity to the needy, the
elderly and the disadvantaged."
Presidential Rhetoric
Now that's the kind of thing
you need to say if you want to be

President, as just about all of us
are either needy, elderly or
disadvantaged. The amazing thing
is that Ford has consistently acted
in such a way as to leave himself
open to such rhetorical attacks.
Similarly, Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.), a declared
non-candidate (which is, of
course, about the same thing as a
declared candidate), called it
"unbelievable" that in proposing a
record deficit, Ford could "not
put America back to work," and
Humphrey for once was right.
It is unbelievable that a man
who was elevated to the
Presidency at a time when a
well-conducted "bring us
together" campaign would have

built an unassailable re-election
machine, could "split us in
pieces" so utterly.
Ford entered office with
virtually unprecedented
popularity. Although that
certainly could not have lasted,
who would have imagined it
would be followed by an
unprecedented collapse of
popularity?
Once again, the President has
failed a crucial test. He has, in
fact, taken another step to assure
himself the second shortest
term of any President in the 20th
century.

him about a rather gaping chink in
his re-election armor.
Would the state of the
economy in 1976, they wanted to
know, affect his decision to seek a
full, elected term as President?
After hemming and hawing in
his usual decisive manner, Fold
concluded, "I think the economic
circumstances will be good
enough to justify at least my
seeking re-election."
He told the reporters — and the
nation — that "unemployment
will be going down and
employment will be going up and
we will be doing a considerable
amount better in the battle
against inflation than we did in
the last 12 months."

Stephen Carter

In truth, Ford's economic
assessment is probably accurate.
What he neglected to mention,
however, was how bad things will
get before then. After all,
recovery from a negative status
can just leave a zero.
Ruinous Budget
Ford's own budget, submitted
to Congress the day before the
press conference, ruins his
prediction of how good things will
be.
According to Office of
Management and Budget (OMB)
figures contained therein, the
consumer price index will rise
11.3 percent in 1975. All right,
for 1976, OMB predicts the index
will rise "only" 7.8 percent.
But campaigning will go on all
during 1976. People will
remember only that everything
costs a lot more "now" (1976)
than it did in the "good old days"
(1973). By the OMB predictions,
inflation won't fall past the "good
old" 1973 figure of 6.2 percent
until 1978. In case the President
has forgotten, the election will be
two years gone by the time those
figures are announced.
Recession Won't End
Well, maybe while inflation
rises, the recession will end. The
OMB, however, doesn't seem to
agree. Ford's economists admit —
albeit grudgingly — that
unemployment will hit 8.1
percent next year. (That compares
with the 5.6 percent figure for
fiscal 1974.)
In the election year 1976,
unemployment will be dropping,
just as the President said — it will
fall from 8.1 to a "mere" 7.9
percent, and will tumble all the
way to 7.5 percent the following
year. In fact, if Ford gains his
elected term of office, then just as

he is leaving in 1980, according to
OMB, unemployment will be
merely as bad as it is now!
Of course, none of this is lost
on any of the several dozen
politicians who currently want
badly to replace Ford in 1976.
Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.), a
declared candidate for the
Democratic presidential
nomination, swiftly lambasted the
budget proposal as "a bloated,
saddening document replete with
monumentally misplaced
priorities reflecting a sorry
insensitivity to the needy, the
elderly and the disadvantaged."
Presidential Rhetoric
Now that's the kind of thing
you need to say if you want to be

President, as just about all of us
are either needy, elderly or
disadvantaged. The amazing thing
is that Ford has consistently acted
in such a way as to leave himself
open to such rhetorical attacks.
Similarly, Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.), a declared
non-candidate (which is, of
course, about the same thing as a
declared candidate), called it
"unbelievable" that in proposing a
record deficit, Ford could "not
put America back to work," and
Humphrey for once was right.
It is unbelievable that a man
who was elevated to the
Presidency at a time when a
well-conducted "bring us
together" campaign would have

built an unassailable re-election
machine, could "split us in
pieces" so utterly.
Ford entered office with
virtually unprecedented
popularity. Although that
certainly could not have lasted,
who would have imagined it
would be followed by an
unprecedented collapse of
popularity?
Once again, the President has
failed a crucial test. He has, in
fact, taken another step to assure
himself the second shortest
term of any President in the 20th
century.
