# Food Crisis Breeds 'Lifeboat Ethics'
## 
### 
The threat of starvation is
imminent for at least 10 million
people this year, and another half
billion are in only slightly less
urgent straits. Within the wealthy
countries (let us avoid the
designation "developed nations"
for a while longer until we show
ourselves to be truly developed),
an intense debate is now going on
at both the governmental and the
private level — all the more
intense, perhaps, for being "off
the record."

This debate hinges on a notion
that Prof. Garrett Hardin of
UC-Santa Barbara, calls "lifeboat
ethics." The gist of lifeboat ethics
is that we of the wealthy
countries are like passengers who
happen to find themselves in a
lifeboat with limited supplies,
surrounded by people who are
drowning. If we help them, we
too will perish, so it is much
better for humanity in the long
run to let them die.
I am alarmed to find, in my
contacts with people throughout
the Bay Area, that these sinister
propositions seem to be taking
root in the minds of people of all
kinds: feeding, no doubt, on the
great insecurity that pervades our
society of late. I feel that it is the
first duty of anyone who has had
the benefit of a university
education, to challenge such ideas
at their very onset.

hearts to the cries of our fellow
human beings, muttering to
ourselves about imminent
depressions and "taking care of
our own," and we can continue to
suffer the consequences of our
over-consumption — debilitation
of our bodies, despoilation of the
environment. Or we can face
squarely the enormous challenge
of a world that is hungry.
In the short run, we can cut
back our consumption of meat, of
fuel, of fertilizer. In the long run,
we can bring about thoroughgoing
reallocation of government
expenditures, and work in close
cooperation with other countries,
world-wide, to increase
agricultural production in ways
appropriate to the countries in
question, and to allocate resources
more fairly over all.
Greed, Envy
A common defense of the
increasing isolationism seen now
in so many quarters is "we have
too many serious internal
problems to solve to take on
anybody else's." May I suggest
that a society dominated by greed
and envy will never be capable of
solving its internal problems?
If we can begin now to shake
off our apathy and exaggerated
concern for our own supposed
needs, and begin to recognize the
very real, urgent needs of others, I
wonder how many of our
"internal problems" might not
find very natural, obvious
solutions.
Putting an end to greed and
envy isn't a task for governments,
but for people — particularly for
young people, who are hopefully
more flexible in their habits and
viewpoints.
Choices
Each of us must awaken to the
choices that hide in the fabric of
daily life and begin to make these

choices consciously. For example,
the grain that was distilled for
liquor sold in the U.S. in 1973
could have fed 20 million people
for a year. Can we not find ways
to unwind on the weekends that
spare these foodstuffs?
My concern is deep for the
men, women and children who
face starvation today. Somehow,
though, I feel an almost more
urgent concern for those of us
who are adopting the "lifeboat"
theory — for it represents an utter
dead end to the human spirit.
All of our training and talents
can be poured into solving the
problem of world hunger — but
our personal example will prove
to be the most significant factor.

hearts to the cries of our fellow
human beings, muttering to
ourselves about imminent
depressions and "taking care of
our own," and we can continue to
suffer the consequences of our
over-consumption — debilitation
of our bodies, despoilation of the
environment. Or we can face
squarely the enormous challenge
of a world that is hungry.
In the short run, we can cut
back our consumption of meat, of
fuel, of fertilizer. In the long run,
we can bring about thoroughgoing
reallocation of government
expenditures, and work in close
cooperation with other countries,
world-wide, to increase
agricultural production in ways
appropriate to the countries in
question, and to allocate resources
more fairly over all.
Greed, Envy
A common defense of the
increasing isolationism seen now
in so many quarters is "we have
too many serious internal
problems to solve to take on
anybody else's." May I suggest
that a society dominated by greed
and envy will never be capable of
solving its internal problems?
If we can begin now to shake
off our apathy and exaggerated
concern for our own supposed
needs, and begin to recognize the
very real, urgent needs of others, I
wonder how many of our
"internal problems" might not
find very natural, obvious
solutions.
Putting an end to greed and
envy isn't a task for governments,
but for people — particularly for
young people, who are hopefully
more flexible in their habits and
viewpoints.
Choices
Each of us must awaken to the
choices that hide in the fabric of
daily life and begin to make these

choices consciously. For example,
the grain that was distilled for
liquor sold in the U.S. in 1973
could have fed 20 million people
for a year. Can we not find ways
to unwind on the weekends that
spare these foodstuffs?
My concern is deep for the
men, women and children who
face starvation today. Somehow,
though, I feel an almost more
urgent concern for those of us
who are adopting the "lifeboat"
theory — for it represents an utter
dead end to the human spirit.
All of our training and talents
can be poured into solving the
problem of world hunger — but
our personal example will prove
to be the most significant factor.
(Carol Flinders of Tomalcs, Calif.,
is a member of the Class of 1965.)
The threat of starvation is
imminent for at least 10 million
people this year, and another half
billion are in only slightly less
urgent straits. Within the wealthy
countries (let us avoid the
designation "developed nations"
for a while longer until we show
ourselves to be truly developed),
an intense debate is now going on
at both the governmental and the
private level — all the more
intense, perhaps, for being "off
the record."

This debate hinges on a notion
that Prof. Garrett Hardin of
UC-Santa Barbara, calls "lifeboat
ethics." The gist of lifeboat ethics
is that we of the wealthy
countries are like passengers who
happen to find themselves in a
lifeboat with limited supplies,
surrounded by people who are
drowning. If we help them, we
too will perish, so it is much
better for humanity in the long
run to let them die.
I am alarmed to find, in my
contacts with people throughout
the Bay Area, that these sinister
propositions seem to be taking
