# SWOPSI Phaseout Costly
## 
### 
On Jan. 29, at the meeting
between Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs and 100
Stanford students, Gibbs admitted
that the elimination of SWOPSI
will not save money but will
actually cost money. By putting
most of SWOPSI's functions into
the departments where heavy
faculty participation will become
predominant, real instruction
costs for SWOPSI could climb
from their present le-vel of zero to
several hundred thousand dollars.
This is assuming that faculty will
be anxious to participate in
SWOPSI workshops — an
untenable assumption.
Even if faculty won't teach
SWOPSI courses, new courses will

have to be taught in order to
teach the units SWOPSI and
SCIRE used to.
Gibbs offered a number of
unsatisfactory attempts to
extricate himself from this
admission. First he kept dragging in
the administrative cuts of $25,000
for each program, saying that
small as they are they represent
real savings. This rationale did not
stand up long, since the increased
instructional costs would still lead
to a net loss running into the
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Extra Time?
Gibss also claimed that many
faculty have extra time and they
should be pressured into teaching
more. In light of University tenure
criteria and the brute facts oflife,
it is unrealistic to expect faculty
to waste valuable research time
just to teach.
And there lies the rub. As an
aside, Gibbs admitted that the
student input into SWOPSI was
not something crucial to the
concept of either SWOPSI or
SCIRE. Some student input is
allowable of course — petitions,
meetings, advisory committees,
begging on hands and knees
perhaps . . . but equal
representation on a policy board?
No, not necessary.
Gibbs' most creative
justification was his claim that his
real goal is to sort of "green" the
academic departments by forcing
them into more innovative kinds of
teaching. And he felt even if this
costs several hundred thousand
dollars maybe it just might be
worth it.
Skeptics
Reaction to this was skeptical.
As one student put it, "A bird in
the hand is worth two in the

Chris Gray

bush." It is difficult to believe
that in these times of fiscal crisis
such valuable, effective, and cheap
programs as SWOPSI and SCIRE
should be sacrificed and hundreds
of thousands of dollars spent on
such impossible dreams.
The last defense by Gibbs was
that SWOPSI courses could still be
sponsored under the good offices
of the Undergraduate Specials
program. That this one office can
run its own programs, all of
SWOPSI, part of SCIRE, and also
serve as the catalyst for innovative
undergraduate education at
Stanford on a budget of $10,000
is just not credible. The significant
thing is that the office of
Undergraduate Specials has no
troublesome student board ... it
is directly under the dean of
undergraduate studies.
Dream World
To read the Jan. 30 Daily
article on the Round Room
meeting is to be transported to a
respectful, quiet place where 100
awed Stanford students sat and
listened to Gibbs say this, and
Gibbs say that, and Gibbs point
out this, and Gibbs explain that.
Well, that meeting never took
palce. The 100 students jammed
into the Round Room of
Memorial Church were mad. And
mad for a good reason.
All the arguments Gibbs has
put forward to defend his
proposal have been blown to
shreds. SWOPSI and SCIRE will
be destroyed if his proposals are
accepted and it is going to cost
the University several hundred
thousand dollars to replace them.
The only possible explanation
is that SWOPSI and SCIRE are
being eliminated for other than
financial reasons.

not something crucial to the
concept of either SWOPSI or
SCIRE. Some student input is
allowable of course — petitions,
meetings, advisory committees,
begging on hands and knees
perhaps . . . but equal
representation on a policy board?
No, not necessary.
Gibbs' most creative
justification was his claim that his
real goal is to sort of "green" the
academic departments by forcing
them into more innovative kinds of
teaching. And he felt even if this
costs several hundred thousand
dollars maybe it just might be
worth it.
Skeptics
Reaction to this was skeptical.
As one student put it, "A bird in
the hand is worth two in the

Chris Gray

bush." It is difficult to believe
that in these times of fiscal crisis
such valuable, effective, and cheap
programs as SWOPSI and SCIRE
should be sacrificed and hundreds
of thousands of dollars spent on
such impossible dreams.
The last defense by Gibbs was
that SWOPSI courses could still be
sponsored under the good offices
of the Undergraduate Specials
program. That this one office can
run its own programs, all of
SWOPSI, part of SCIRE, and also
serve as the catalyst for innovative
undergraduate education at
Stanford on a budget of $10,000
is just not credible. The significant
thing is that the office of
Undergraduate Specials has no
troublesome student board ... it
is directly under the dean of
undergraduate studies.
Dream World
To read the Jan. 30 Daily
article on the Round Room
meeting is to be transported to a
respectful, quiet place where 100
awed Stanford students sat and
listened to Gibbs say this, and
Gibbs say that, and Gibbs point
out this, and Gibbs explain that.
Well, that meeting never took
palce. The 100 students jammed
into the Round Room of
Memorial Church were mad. And
mad for a good reason.
All the arguments Gibbs has
put forward to defend his
proposal have been blown to
shreds. SWOPSI and SCIRE will
be destroyed if his proposals are
accepted and it is going to cost
the University several hundred
thousand dollars to replace them.
The only possible explanation
is that SWOPSI and SCIRE are
being eliminated for other than
financial reasons.
(Chris Gray is a senior.)
On Jan. 29, at the meeting
between Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs and 100
Stanford students, Gibbs admitted
that the elimination of SWOPSI
will not save money but will
actually cost money. By putting
most of SWOPSI's functions into
the departments where heavy
faculty participation will become
predominant, real instruction
costs for SWOPSI could climb
from their present le-vel of zero to
several hundred thousand dollars.
This is assuming that faculty will
be anxious to participate in
SWOPSI workshops — an
untenable assumption.
Even if faculty won't teach
SWOPSI courses, new courses will

have to be taught in order to
teach the units SWOPSI and
SCIRE used to.
Gibbs offered a number of
unsatisfactory attempts to
extricate himself from this
admission. First he kept dragging in
the administrative cuts of $25,000
for each program, saying that
small as they are they represent
real savings. This rationale did not
stand up long, since the increased
instructional costs would still lead
to a net loss running into the
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Extra Time?
Gibss also claimed that many
faculty have extra time and they
should be pressured into teaching
more. In light of University tenure
criteria and the brute facts oflife,
it is unrealistic to expect faculty
to waste valuable research time
just to teach.
And there lies the rub. As an
aside, Gibbs admitted that the
student input into SWOPSI was
not something crucial to the
concept of either SWOPSI or
SCIRE. Some student input is
allowable of course — petitions,
meetings, advisory committees,
begging on hands and knees
perhaps . . . but equal
