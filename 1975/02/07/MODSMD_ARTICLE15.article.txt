More On Tenuring
Editor:
I am in complete agreement
with the statements made by Prof.
Mark Edwards (Daily, Feb. 5),
the first man to come forward
with valid, concrete criticisms of
the present tenuring process.
I also wish to point out that in
an age which seems to place such
a high premium upon scholarly
research, Edwards and his
colleague Anthony Raubitschek,
both leaders in their fields, still
manage to spend considerable
time with undergraduates and are
concerned with their overall
education.
In evaluating my decision to
come to Stanford, I feel that if it
weren't for the attention I
received from these two men and
from other professors like them,
Stanford would not have been a

good choice.
In my opinion, Stanford must
place more emphasis upon
excellent teaching if we are to
ensure ourselves of having scholars
who will follow in the great
tradition of which Edwards is a
part.

Flicks Poorly Timed
Flditor:
There seems to be a certain
degree of misdirected hard feeling
in the lines outside Memorial
Auditorium on Sunday evenings.
Often in the past few weeks,
students who await the late
showing of the Sunday P'licks
have had to endure long periods
of standing in lines unnecessarily.
Because of what appears to be

poor scheduling of the second
show, placing it too close to the
end of the initial show, it is
difficult for one audience to exit
and another to enter.
The student cops who police
the Flicks do a great job in trying
to maintain a semblance of order
and quickness in moving the
crowds, but it does take time for
one crowd to exit and it
postpones the start of the second
show, resulting in the long wait in
line for the students and friends
outside.
I suggest that some thought
may possibly be taken in
scheduling next quarter's Flicks,
so that ample time be given for
emptying the auditorium, and so
that the second show can start
closer to the publicized time of
screening.
