# Permanent ASSU Posts: Explosion?
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
You probably don't care much whether
ASSU President Mike Herman gets his way
and the ASSU hires two full-time employees
- Dave Martin as full-time financial manager
nd Danny Scher as special events director.
But consider this mouthful from current
financial manager Frank Olivieri in
announcing the plan Wednesday.
"If approved by the ASSU Senate, the
ASSU will run along the lines of the UCLA
student government. That operation has an
$8-9 million budget with 900 employees and
200 full-time employees. We are expanding
the ASSU and a full-time financial manager is
needed."
The word for what Olivieri is proposing,
assuming he's not daydreaming aloud, is not
expansion. It's explosion.
Touch Of Tarzan
Special Events and the Travel Service are
increasing their business rapidly. There's an
embryo lecture note service. And the idea of
'he ASSU taking over Tresidder Union is
flaking frequent swings on the grapevine.
Herman denies there's any connection
between a possible takeover of Tresidder and
a full-time financial manager. But hiring
Martin sure wouldn't hurt.
The University probably wouldn't let the
ASSU become a multi-million dollar
enterprise without some assurance that it will
•t'main stable through its endless series of
one-year governments. A full-time financial
manager would allay many of Stanford's fears.
And many people think Martin is perfect
for the job. As student financial manager in
1973-74, Martin "completely turned the
operation around," into a money-maker,
according to Herman.
Obstacles
But before Martin can be hired and the
\SSU be turned into a comparative giant, the
ASSU Senate has to approve. And judging
from its reaction when Herman sprung the
Martin/Scher plan on it Wednesday night, that
approval won't come pro forma.
Several senators thought there were four
questions to be answered, rather than one
proposal to be given a "vote of confidence."
Two of those questions are, "Should there be
full-time financial manager?" and "If so,
" .ho should it be?" The other questions ask
the same about the special events directorship.
Sen. William Hoke summed up what
appeared to be majority sentiment in the
Senate. Hoke noted that the ASSU shouldn't
consider people for the full-time positions,
"until we have our goals and directions set."
Danny — Missing Link?
So why did Herman link so many ideas
nto one proposal? Herman's explanation is
that since students want rock concerts, and
seem to want Danny Scher to put them on,
Scher should be hired.
If Scher is hired, Herman wants him to
work for a full-time boss, rather than a
part-timer who might not have adequate
control over the situation. Enter Mr. Martin.
The selection of a new financial manager
nust, according to bylaws, be made by Feb.
15. That gives the ASSU Senate exactly one
meeting to confirm Martin — or tell Herman
to get lost and approve an alternate choice as
student financial manager for next, year (the
Student Financial Manager Selection
Committee has already picked the alternate).
It should be a very, very interesting
meeting next Wednesday night. As well as one
/ith profound implications for the ASSU's
future.
