# Public Outcry Saves Charters For Awhile
## 
### MARK FUNK 
A sigh of relief went up in a number of
quarters this week when it was announced
that the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)had
withdrawn support for a proposal that
would have banned affinity charter flights.
The CAB said it will postpone — at least
temporarily — proposals that would have
ended sale of new affinity charter packages
after March 31 and barred any such flights
by the end of 1976. A board spokesman said
the measure would not be resubmitted for at
least a year.
And for Stanford students, that's very
good news. It grants a reprieve to the ASSU
Travel Service and its wildly popular
Christmas and spring break charters.
One ASSU officer said — quite correctly
— that the "charters are the most justifiable
student service we currently offer." The
ASSU grosses almost $500,000 from it.
For the record, any educational,
fraternal, religious, labor, professional or
ethnic organization not created for specific
purpose of travel can qualify for affinity
group charters.
The classification is translated into dollars
and cents for students. For example, a New
York Christmas flight which cost $160
roundtrip through the Travel Service would
jump over 100 percent on a commercial
carrier.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer said
he felt the CAB was forced to reconsider its
proposal in the face of strong opposition
from organizations which qualify for affinity
charters and from critics in Congress.
"I think that the charters were saved
because a number of people with the same
interests were willing to work together and
apply pressure on the CAB," Mayer said. "It
appeared that the Board was going to renege
on its commitment to low-income
passengers."
Several hundred Stanford students wrote
into CAB protesting the proposed affinity
flights cuts, Mayer elaborated.
He also noted that "every one of the
1630 students that flew on the charter
flights over Christmas received a petition so
I'm sure the turn-out was even greater
there."
John Topping, one student who wrote
the CAB, was relieved that the CAB had
backed down from the first proposal. "I
wrote them a letter when I heard they were
thinking of cutting affinity flights," he
mused. "I guess it did some good."
David Fogleman of Denton, Tex., agreed.
"I was worried that some students might be
cut off from a viable source of financial aid
if the CAB ruling was enacted," he said.

California congressmen also denounced
the CAB recommendation in Washington,
D.C.
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and
Democratic Sen. John Tunney cited negative
economic ramifications as reasons for their
opposition to the proposal. Apparently, the
pair had considerable impact on this latest
decision of the CAB.
Students should not drop their pencils
too hastily, however.
The International Air Transport
Association (lATA) and several
scheduled-on-demand airlines agreed last
week to restore special youth fares to
Europe April 1, pending approval by U.S.
agencies and European governments.
The CAB had .previously ruled that
special youth fares were discriminatory on
the basis of age.
The return of European youth fares is
expected to increase pressure on the CAB to
reverse its ban on domestic youth fares.
And sentiment is growing within a
number of circles to confront the CAB on
those fares, too. The united front that grew
out of the affinity flight fight is expected to
surface again in this new battle.

flights cuts, Mayer elaborated.
He also noted that "every one of the
1630 students that flew on the charter
flights over Christmas received a petition so
I'm sure the turn-out was even greater
there."
John Topping, one student who wrote
the CAB, was relieved that the CAB had
backed down from the first proposal. "I
wrote them a letter when I heard they were
thinking of cutting affinity flights," he
mused. "I guess it did some good."
David Fogleman of Denton, Tex., agreed.
"I was worried that some students might be
cut off from a viable source of financial aid
if the CAB ruling was enacted," he said.

California congressmen also denounced
the CAB recommendation in Washington,
D.C.
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) and
Democratic Sen. John Tunney cited negative
economic ramifications as reasons for their
opposition to the proposal. Apparently, the
pair had considerable impact on this latest
decision of the CAB.
Students should not drop their pencils
too hastily, however.
The International Air Transport
Association (lATA) and several
scheduled-on-demand airlines agreed last
week to restore special youth fares to
Europe April 1, pending approval by U.S.
agencies and European governments.
The CAB had .previously ruled that
special youth fares were discriminatory on
the basis of age.
The return of European youth fares is
expected to increase pressure on the CAB to
reverse its ban on domestic youth fares.
And sentiment is growing within a
number of circles to confront the CAB on
those fares, too. The united front that grew
out of the affinity flight fight is expected to
surface again in this new battle.
A sigh of relief went up in a number of
quarters this week when it was announced
that the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)had
withdrawn support for a proposal that
would have banned affinity charter flights.
The CAB said it will postpone — at least
temporarily — proposals that would have
ended sale of new affinity charter packages
after March 31 and barred any such flights
by the end of 1976. A board spokesman said
the measure would not be resubmitted for at
least a year.
And for Stanford students, that's very
good news. It grants a reprieve to the ASSU
Travel Service and its wildly popular
Christmas and spring break charters.
One ASSU officer said — quite correctly
— that the "charters are the most justifiable
student service we currently offer." The
ASSU grosses almost $500,000 from it.
For the record, any educational,
fraternal, religious, labor, professional or
ethnic organization not created for specific
purpose of travel can qualify for affinity
group charters.
The classification is translated into dollars
and cents for students. For example, a New
York Christmas flight which cost $160
roundtrip through the Travel Service would
jump over 100 percent on a commercial
carrier.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer said
he felt the CAB was forced to reconsider its
proposal in the face of strong opposition
from organizations which qualify for affinity
charters and from critics in Congress.
"I think that the charters were saved
because a number of people with the same
interests were willing to work together and
apply pressure on the CAB," Mayer said. "It
appeared that the Board was going to renege
on its commitment to low-income
passengers."
Several hundred Stanford students wrote
into CAB protesting the proposed affinity
flights cuts, Mayer elaborated.
