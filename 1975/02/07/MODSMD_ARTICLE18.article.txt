# Frats Have No Chance For Survival Here

### BONNY RODOEN 
Don't kid yourself. The University is still
out to destroy fraternities. Only the murder
will not be executed as blatantly as expected
vvith a shot in the back. Instead, the
University will crush fraternities with an
Edgar Allen Poe flourish — in a doorless room
with moving walls.
The "certain death knell" for fraternities,
incorporating them into the draw system, has
been shrewdly avoided in Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton's proposal for a
new residential system.
Fraternities will retain their draw-exempt
status under the proposal. However, they will
have to bear some of the housing shortage
burden. Fraternities will be forced to accept
more members than they have room to house.
Therefore, they will probably have to
establish an off-campus annex.
Some frat men will have to spend some
time off campus but anything's better than
being absorbed by the draw, right?
Flaw In Plan
Inter-Fraternity Council President Mike
Nilsson was quick to see the flaw in the plan.
Under the proposal, each house fraternity
would have to accept a University-determined
number of members after two years or be
swept into the draw system.
Nilsson accused the proposal of "having
provisions for attrition but not for
expansion." The University could continually
admit more and more students and force a
hike in the fraternity-member quota in order
to compensate for the increased demand for
housing.
But the alluring light of fraternities can
only glow for so long when its batteries are
being drained and event"ally the weak
fraternities would fade straight into the draw.
On the other hand, the University will not
allow strong fraternities, which are willing to
settle at Stanford, to take the place of the
failing ones.
Subjective Selectivity Limited
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said
Tuesday the University would "not like to see
subjective selectivity expanded" to any other
organizations other than the 12 fraternities
now on campus.

Therefore, the restricting walls which the
University is building around fraternities can
only do one of two things — remain immobile
or slowly close in on fraternities.
The death of fraternities may have been
postponed but it's still in the offing. The
clever part is that the University managed to
avoid alienating donation-happy fraternity
alumni by making the end not too brash.
The plot was not conceived by heartless
Ilorton or spineless students on the COSS
housing subcommittee, however.
Students' Fault
The students did it to themselves in their
efforts to follow the moral ethics of the times.
In this age of crusades against any hint of
discrimination, an organization based on
subjective selectivity is doomed.
Ironically, any action which fraternity
men take to help their sisters who are trying
to establish sororities here will be suicidal.
The only ground women have to stand on
is that the University discriminates against
them because it allows fraternities to exist on
campus, but not sororities.
Title IX Flag
Women could wave the Title IX flag of the
federal Educational Amendments Act of
1972, which denies federal funds to
organizations discriminating on the basis of
sex, in order to lift the 1944 ban on sororities
by the Board of Trustees.
But if women take such actions, Lyons has
threatened to deny subjective selectivity to
everyone — fraternities and sororities; that
would solve the discrimination problem.
So once again it's the
be-happy -with -what -you -have-or-give-up
everything policy.
With the housing system, students
complained that only a select group of
persons were being granted guaranteed
on-campus housing privileges; now everyone
will probably have to live off campus one
year.
Lyons admitted the same thing will happen
if women complain. Everyone will be denied
subjective selectivity — the most important
aspect of fraternities, according to Nilsson.
Fraternal organizations, you can't win.
