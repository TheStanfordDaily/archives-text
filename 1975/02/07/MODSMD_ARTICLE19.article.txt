# Palo Alto School Board Election
## Goldstein's Chances Better This Year? 
### JOHN FREED 
What do local PTA board member Jean
Amick, computer programmer June Genis,
political studies researcher Joshua
Goldstein and Los Altos school principal
Robert Taylor have in common?
Each is a candidate in Palo Alto's March
4 school board election. Students who are
registered here may vote — and a student
bloc could have a significant impact on the
final tallies.
Consider the case of Goldstein. An
also-ran in the 1974 school board race,
Goldstein at the time polled 32 percent of
the vote in a field of five candidates. A
Stanford employee, he counted on strong
student support in his last campaign.
At the opposite extreme is Taylor, who
harps on his "experience" in handling
school board matters. At a recent meeting
of the Palo Alto Citizens' Caucus — at
which a Palo Alto resident without
school-age children would have looked
most out of place — Taylor polled only one
vote. At the same meeting, Goldstein won
the caucus' endorsement for the second

straight year.
Genis seems to be counting on a
"taxpayers' revolt" to sweep her into
office. Among the candidates, she alone
opposed a referendum which would
increase the district's tax revenue.
"A lot of this, frankly, is controlled at
the state level," Genis told caucus
members. "We can't abolish taxation, but
we can give people ... a rebate."
The other candidates supported the
referendum, and Amick summarized their
case.
"If the measure fails, it would be too
much of a cut (in revenue] right now.
Especially with a new superintendent
coming in, we should give him every
chance to make cuts gradually," Amick
remarked.
Amick was the second choice of the
caucus with 30 percent of the votes. The
caucus allows membership at the age of 14.
Several high school students were at the
meeting — and an unknown number voted
by mail — so some candidates were
skeptical of the caucus' vote as a

bellwether of community sentiment.
"I don't think the caucus" endorsement
is very important," remarked Taylor.
Who will win? If last year's pattern
holds up, Goldstein — the caucus' endorsee
— will finish second, since the caucus
traditionally takes a more liberal stance
than the community. Amick, by this
reasoning, is the odds-on favorite, while
Taylor and Genis should split the
remaining votes.
However, this time around Goldstein is
more wary and better organized than he
was last year. He attends local "kaffee
klatsches" as every local candidate is
expected to do — and he's the only
contender who has already waged one
city-wide campaign for the school board.
Goldstein has urged voters to "put a
young person on the school board," and
claimed the district has underutilized its
land and buildings.
He suggested using open lands for
ecology projects and empty classrooms as
day-care centers or senior-citizens'meeting
rooms.

What do local PTA board member Jean
Amick, computer programmer June Genis,
political studies researcher Joshua
Goldstein and Los Altos school principal
Robert Taylor have in common?
Each is a candidate in Palo Alto's March
4 school board election. Students who are
registered here may vote — and a student
bloc could have a significant impact on the
final tallies.
Consider the case of Goldstein. An
also-ran in the 1974 school board race,
Goldstein at the time polled 32 percent of
the vote in a field of five candidates. A
Stanford employee, he counted on strong
student support in his last campaign.
At the opposite extreme is Taylor, who
harps on his "experience" in handling
school board matters. At a recent meeting
of the Palo Alto Citizens' Caucus — at
which a Palo Alto resident without
school-age children would have looked
most out of place — Taylor polled only one
vote. At the same meeting, Goldstein won
the caucus' endorsement for the second

straight year.
Genis seems to be counting on a
"taxpayers' revolt" to sweep her into
office. Among the candidates, she alone
opposed a referendum which would
increase the district's tax revenue.
"A lot of this, frankly, is controlled at
the state level," Genis told caucus
members. "We can't abolish taxation, but
we can give people ... a rebate."
The other candidates supported the
referendum, and Amick summarized their
case.
"If the measure fails, it would be too
much of a cut (in revenue] right now.
Especially with a new superintendent
coming in, we should give him every
chance to make cuts gradually," Amick
remarked.
Amick was the second choice of the
caucus with 30 percent of the votes. The
caucus allows membership at the age of 14.
Several high school students were at the
meeting — and an unknown number voted
by mail — so some candidates were
skeptical of the caucus' vote as a

bellwether of community sentiment.
"I don't think the caucus" endorsement
is very important," remarked Taylor.
Who will win? If last year's pattern
holds up, Goldstein — the caucus' endorsee
— will finish second, since the caucus
traditionally takes a more liberal stance
than the community. Amick, by this
reasoning, is the odds-on favorite, while
Taylor and Genis should split the
remaining votes.
However, this time around Goldstein is
more wary and better organized than he
was last year. He attends local "kaffee
klatsches" as every local candidate is
expected to do — and he's the only
contender who has already waged one
city-wide campaign for the school board.
Goldstein has urged voters to "put a
young person on the school board," and
claimed the district has underutilized its
land and buildings.
He suggested using open lands for
ecology projects and empty classrooms as
day-care centers or senior-citizens'meeting
rooms.
