# Survey Finds Drugs Costly At Tresidder

### PETE BHATIA 
Stanford students can save up to
22.9 percent on purchases of toiletries
and over-the-counter drugs if they buy
them off campus, according to a
survey released by the Northern
California Public Interest Research
Group (NorCal PIRG).
The survey, conducted in 21 Palo
Alto and Menlo Park stores during Jan.
20-27, also was highly critical of the
discount pricing program at The Store
in Tresidder Union.
The study said Palo Alto and
Stanford comsumers can save up to 27
percent in the total bill for 23 popular
drugs and toiletries by shopping at the
cheapest store, Long's Drugs, El
Camino Real and San Antonio Road.
Long's total of $25.33 for the 23

items was $9.37 less than that of Palo
Alto Drug, 403 University Ave., the
survey's highest priced store.
Savings of up to $1.46 could be
realized on selected items, PIRG
reported. A 20-tablet box of Contac
cold capsules sold at one store for
$3.25 was priced at $1.79 elsewhere.
Similarly, up to 92 cents for Tampax
and 90 cents for Sure deodorant could
be saved by the comparative shopper.
The survey confirmed earlier
NorCal PIRG studies in San Jose and
Stockton which showed that chain
stores offer lower prices than those
locally owned. The five least expensive
stores (Long's, Thrifty, Safeway,
Lucky and Co-op) are owned by
national or regional organizations. The
five most expensive stores, are locally
owned.
More Services
Risa Shimoda of NorCal PIRG
commented that "the difference in
price between national and local stores
is reflected in the fact that the local
stores generally offer more
conveniences and services to the
consumer.
"For example, all of the local stores
offer free delivery, none of the larger
ones do. In addition, many of the
smaller stores provide charge accounts
and 24-hour emergency service to
customers while the larger stores do
not."
Despite last year's price-cutting
promises made by The Store at
Tresidder, the survey reported, real
savings for Stanford students are to'be
found off campus. A list of 17 items,
could be obtained for 22.9 percent less
at Long's Drugs than at The Store,
PIRG reported.
"The people of Stanford should
carefully compare the prices charged
by The Store," Shimoda said. "To
achieve real savings, students have to
travel over two miles from campus;
they cannot depend on The Store to
provide the lowest prices. PIRG is
forced to conclude that the student
store does not have the student budget
in mind."
Discount Discontinued
Store manager Gary Ding
confirmed that his establishment had
begun a "discount pricing policy" in
January, 1974, but said the policy had
been discontinued at the start of the
current academic year because the
management felt it was losing money
with the discount policy.
Shimoda predicted The Store's
failure to publicly announce its return
to non-discount pricing "may have
caused the loss of thousands of dollars
by students purchasing under the
impression that The Store was a
discount house." She urged The Store
to publicly announce all future
changes in pricing policy.
NorCal PIRG Executive Director
Roger Telschow revealed plans
Wednesday for an intensive upswing in
student-consumer surveys in the next

six to eight weeks. Telschow told the
Daily that surveys on area record, gas,
liquor and prescription drug prices are
under way. Surveys on clothing, bike
and auto repairs and parts, and
textbooks also are planned.
The cost of groceries in the Palo
Alto area also is under investigation,
based on a United States Department
of Agriculture report on buying habits
of the average American family.
Telschow indicated he would meet
with ASSU President Mike Herman to
discuss Herman's recent criticism of
Stanford PIRG.
