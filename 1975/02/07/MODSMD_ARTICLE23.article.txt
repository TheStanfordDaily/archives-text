Thad Jones & Mel Lewis^MMMHF-
Potpourri
Phila. International KZ 33152
Big band jazz lives, thanks in
good part to the efforts of Gil
Evans' experimental electronic
unit and Thad Jones and Mel
Lewis' incredibly talented 18-man
band. The traditional problems of
adequately capturing the big-band
sound on record have been
admirably solved on buth these
new releases, although the sounds
of the two orchestras are very
different.
Evans, a fine arranger best
known for his late-50s work
with Miles Davis, leads his very
young and gifted band through
some novel interpretations of
Hendrix compositions, and the
result is like no rock music every
recorded. Evans relies heavily on
his soloists to make the
arrangements work, and they
come through superbly over a
churning rhythm section that
features multiple synthesizers,
electric guitars and percussion
instruments.
Thus "Angel" works as a soul
ballad, with David Sanborn's
bittersweet alto sax singing over
the other horns. Vocalist Hannibal
Peterson and trombonist
Tom Malonecarry a straight-ahead
version of "Crosstown Traffic"
that's an excellent example of
how rock can work in a jazz
context.
Other highlights of Evans'
record include guitarist John
Abercrombie's fine solo in
"1983" which never sounds like
Hendrix and Trevor Koehler's
high-powered electric soprano sax
solo on "Gypsy Eyes."
Throughout, Evans and company
have fashioned a jazz-rock blend
that never fails from
over-cautiousness or lack of
musical ideas.
The Jones-Lewis collaboration
as just about every jazz fan
knows, has been producing the
finest big band music anywhere
for the last eight years, but even
so Potpourri is amazingly good.
From the time the album opens
with a pounding string bass solo
by George Mraz and Butter
J a c k son's plunger-muted
trombone lead-in, the music is an
uninterrupted joy.

Thad Jones' four compositions
and his arranging represent no
unusual innovations, just the best
big-band music that anyone has
written in a long time. Mraz,
drummer Lewis, and especially
pianist Roland Hanna, whose
electric playing is the epitome of
precise beauty, provide the
perfect base, the horn soloists like
Jones (flugelhorn) Jerry
Dodgion (alto and flute), Billy
Harper (tenor) and Cecil
Bridgewater (trumpet) take off,
and there's no stopping this band.
The song renditions are all
great, from a rocking rendition of

Stevie Wonder's "Living for the
City," with Buddy Lucas'
harmonica leading off, to
Dodgion's fragile arrangement of
"Ambiance," as beautiful a piece
as any band has recorded. It's
hard to imagine how a big band
could play any better than this.

Goodnight Vienna
Apple SW-3417
Who would have thought in
1951 that Gort, the famous robot
from The Day the Earth Stood
Still, would be on a record cover
in 1975?
Gort is just one of a number of
stars who appear on Ringo Starr's
latest album. Goodnight Vienna,
in an attempt to recapture the
electric spirit that infused his
smash-selling album of a year ago.
.John Lennon, Elton John,
Harry Nilsson, Robbie Robertson,
Billy Preston and Dr. John are
some of the other big names of
the pop world who have lent their
talents to this lush Richard Perry
production.
The trouble is, the material is
too weak to support this galaxy of
musical talent, and the scattershot
nature of the material — a little
rock, a touch of 30s style
nostalgia, a smattering of
country-western — does nothing
to make the album stand out as an
especially good example of
anything.
The 10 songs include three
authored by Ringb, one from
Lennon, one from Elton John,
and even a Roger Miller number.
Of the bunch, only the Lennon
composition, "Goodnight
Vienna," has any real pizzaz,
which must be why it was chosen
for the title cut.
Although the Ringo
composition, "All By Myself,"
and the golden oldie "Only You"
have been receiving most of the
airplay, "Goodnight Vienna," is

by far the most infectious and
upbeat song on the entire record.
Everything else is pleasant but
a bit on the bland side, perhaps
spoiled at times by Ringo's
colorless vocals, which all the
tricks of producer Perry can't
hide, especially on the Nilsson
song, "Easy For Me," that closes
out side two.
It reeks of the Gatsby era and a
sugary romanticizing that Ringo's
voice just can't handle without
sounding cloying. Better than
Nilsson himself should have sung
it.
The essentially
flaccid-in-nice-way aspect of
Goodnight Vienna is captured
best, though, in the Elton
John-Bernie Taupin song,
"Snookeroo," that briefly
chronicles the life of an amiable
ne'er-do-well, who needs someone
to cook for him and "turn me
loose at night."
Essentially that's what Ringo
has done, getting together a group
of his friends to "cook" for him,
while he was turned loose on the
vocals. The only trouble was that
the resulting stew could have used
a trifle more spice.
Perhaps a song from Gort?

Dave Mason ¥-¥-¥-
Dave Mason
Columbia PC 33046
In his second album for
Columbia, Dave Mason appears to
be catering to the whims of that
company by putting out
competent if erratic records aimed
at mass appeal.
To many listeners this trend is
far from regrettable — if the
current commercial success of the
album via FM airplay is any
indication — but to Mason
devotees like myself these
products fail to sufficiently fulfill
his potential as a premier rock
guitarist.
His latest venture,
appropriately titled Dave Mason
(which, also appropriately, is the
name of his band) suffers from
underexposure of his greatest
asset — his unique electric guitar
solos.
The album is actually quite a
listenable, enjoyable one overall —
a good introduction to his music
for budding fans — and although
it is somewhat disappointing, its
nine offerings are at worst
tolerable and at best superb.
The band, consisting of Mike
Finnigan on keyboards. Bob
Glaub on bass, Rick Jaeger on
drums, and Jim Krieger sharing
guitars with Mason, is tight and
talented in rendering his
distinctively simple songs.
Finnigan especially stands out
as the backbone of the band's
sound and he is an excellent
complement, both vocally and
instrumentally, to Dave's style.
The two combine quite well on
their rendition of the folk
standard "Bring it on Home to
Me," the resurrection (with steel
guitar) of Mason's love song
"Every Woman," and again on the
subtly simple "Relationships."
The most successful offerings,
however, are the two which
feature Mason's distinctive solos:
"All Along the Watchtower" and
"You Can't Take it When You
Go."
The former is almost worth the
price of the entire record (I take
that back — no record is worth
five bucks), for it is virtually a
solo vehicle for Mason himself; his
vocals are unrestrained and driving
and his guitar soars in majestic
crescendos that take the listener
where only he can take them.
The latter, though, is
unfortunately marred by an
apparently mandatory insertion of
violins that drown out Mason's
riffs, adding to the overall feeling
of frustration this album spurs in
the hearts and ears of hard-core
fans of a great but misguided
guitarist extraordinaire.

Thad Jones & Mel Lewis^MMMHF-
Potpourri
Phila. International KZ 33152
Big band jazz lives, thanks in
good part to the efforts of Gil
Evans' experimental electronic
unit and Thad Jones and Mel
Lewis' incredibly talented 18-man
band. The traditional problems of
adequately capturing the big-band
sound on record have been
admirably solved on buth these
new releases, although the sounds
of the two orchestras are very
different.
Evans, a fine arranger best
known for his late-50s work
with Miles Davis, leads his very
young and gifted band through
some novel interpretations of
Hendrix compositions, and the
result is like no rock music every
recorded. Evans relies heavily on
his soloists to make the
arrangements work, and they
come through superbly over a
churning rhythm section that
features multiple synthesizers,
electric guitars and percussion
instruments.
Thus "Angel" works as a soul
ballad, with David Sanborn's
bittersweet alto sax singing over
the other horns. Vocalist Hannibal
Peterson and trombonist
Tom Malonecarry a straight-ahead
version of "Crosstown Traffic"
that's an excellent example of
how rock can work in a jazz
context.
Other highlights of Evans'
record include guitarist John
Abercrombie's fine solo in
"1983" which never sounds like
Hendrix and Trevor Koehler's
high-powered electric soprano sax
solo on "Gypsy Eyes."
Throughout, Evans and company
have fashioned a jazz-rock blend
that never fails from
over-cautiousness or lack of
musical ideas.
The Jones-Lewis collaboration
as just about every jazz fan
knows, has been producing the
finest big band music anywhere
for the last eight years, but even
so Potpourri is amazingly good.
From the time the album opens
with a pounding string bass solo
by George Mraz and Butter
J a c k son's plunger-muted
trombone lead-in, the music is an
uninterrupted joy.

Thad Jones' four compositions
and his arranging represent no
unusual innovations, just the best
big-band music that anyone has
written in a long time. Mraz,
drummer Lewis, and especially
pianist Roland Hanna, whose
electric playing is the epitome of
precise beauty, provide the
perfect base, the horn soloists like
Jones (flugelhorn) Jerry
Dodgion (alto and flute), Billy
Harper (tenor) and Cecil
Bridgewater (trumpet) take off,
and there's no stopping this band.
The song renditions are all
great, from a rocking rendition of

Stevie Wonder's "Living for the
City," with Buddy Lucas'
harmonica leading off, to
Dodgion's fragile arrangement of
"Ambiance," as beautiful a piece
as any band has recorded. It's
hard to imagine how a big band
could play any better than this.

Goodnight Vienna
Apple SW-3417
Who would have thought in
1951 that Gort, the famous robot
from The Day the Earth Stood
Still, would be on a record cover
in 1975?
Gort is just one of a number of
stars who appear on Ringo Starr's
latest album. Goodnight Vienna,
in an attempt to recapture the
electric spirit that infused his
smash-selling album of a year ago.
.John Lennon, Elton John,
Harry Nilsson, Robbie Robertson,
Billy Preston and Dr. John are
some of the other big names of
the pop world who have lent their
talents to this lush Richard Perry
production.
The trouble is, the material is
too weak to support this galaxy of
musical talent, and the scattershot
nature of the material — a little
rock, a touch of 30s style
nostalgia, a smattering of
country-western — does nothing
to make the album stand out as an
especially good example of
anything.
The 10 songs include three
authored by Ringb, one from
Lennon, one from Elton John,
and even a Roger Miller number.
Of the bunch, only the Lennon
composition, "Goodnight
Vienna," has any real pizzaz,
which must be why it was chosen
for the title cut.
Although the Ringo
composition, "All By Myself,"
and the golden oldie "Only You"
have been receiving most of the
airplay, "Goodnight Vienna," is

by far the most infectious and
upbeat song on the entire record.
Everything else is pleasant but
a bit on the bland side, perhaps
spoiled at times by Ringo's
colorless vocals, which all the
tricks of producer Perry can't
hide, especially on the Nilsson
song, "Easy For Me," that closes
out side two.
It reeks of the Gatsby era and a
sugary romanticizing that Ringo's
voice just can't handle without
sounding cloying. Better than
Nilsson himself should have sung
it.
The essentially
flaccid-in-nice-way aspect of
Goodnight Vienna is captured
best, though, in the Elton
John-Bernie Taupin song,
"Snookeroo," that briefly
chronicles the life of an amiable
ne'er-do-well, who needs someone
to cook for him and "turn me
loose at night."
Essentially that's what Ringo
has done, getting together a group
of his friends to "cook" for him,
while he was turned loose on the
vocals. The only trouble was that
the resulting stew could have used
a trifle more spice.
Perhaps a song from Gort?

Dave Mason
Columbia PC 33046
In his second album for
Columbia, Dave Mason appears to
be catering to the whims of that
company by putting out
competent if erratic records aimed
at mass appeal.
To many listeners this trend is
far from regrettable — if the
current commercial success of the
album via FM airplay is any
indication — but to Mason
devotees like myself these
products fail to sufficiently fulfill
his potential as a premier rock
guitarist.
His latest venture,
appropriately titled Dave Mason
(which, also appropriately, is the
name of his band) suffers from
underexposure of his greatest
asset — his unique electric guitar
solos.
The album is actually quite a
listenable, enjoyable one overall —
a good introduction to his music
for budding fans — and although
it is somewhat disappointing, its
nine offerings are at worst
tolerable and at best superb.
The band, consisting of Mike
Finnigan on keyboards. Bob
Glaub on bass, Rick Jaeger on
drums, and Jim Krieger sharing
guitars with Mason, is tight and
talented in rendering his
distinctively simple songs.
Finnigan especially stands out
as the backbone of the band's
sound and he is an excellent
complement, both vocally and
instrumentally, to Dave's style.
The two combine quite well on
their rendition of the folk
standard "Bring it on Home to
Me," the resurrection (with steel
guitar) of Mason's love song
"Every Woman," and again on the
subtly simple "Relationships."
The most successful offerings,
however, are the two which
feature Mason's distinctive solos:
"All Along the Watchtower" and
"You Can't Take it When You
Go."
The former is almost worth the
price of the entire record (I take
that back — no record is worth
five bucks), for it is virtually a
solo vehicle for Mason himself; his
vocals are unrestrained and driving
and his guitar soars in majestic
crescendos that take the listener

unfortunately marred by an
apparently mandatory insertion of

"Every Woman," and again on the

however, are the two which
feature Mason's distinctive solos:
"All Along the Watchtower" and
"You Can't Take it When You
Go."
The former is almost worth the
price of the entire record (I take
that back — no record is worth
five bucks), for it is virtually a
solo vehicle for Mason himself; his
vocals are unrestrained and driving
and his guitar soars in majestic
crescendos that take the listener
where only he can take them.
The latter, though, is
unfortunately marred by an
apparently mandatory insertion of
violins that drown out Mason's
riffs, adding to the overall feeling
of frustration this album spurs in
the hearts and ears of hard-core
fans of a great but misguided

The Gil Evans Orchestra

Thad Jones & Mel Lewis^MMMHF-
Potpourri
Phila. International KZ 33152
Big band jazz lives, thanks in
good part to the efforts of Gil
Evans' experimental electronic
unit and Thad Jones and Mel
Lewis' incredibly talented 18-man
band. The traditional problems of
adequately capturing the big-band
sound on record have been
admirably solved on buth these
new releases, although the sounds
of the two orchestras are very
different.
Evans, a fine arranger best
known for his late-50s work
with Miles Davis, leads his very
young and gifted band through
some novel interpretations of
Hendrix compositions, and the
result is like no rock music every
recorded. Evans relies heavily on
his soloists to make the
arrangements work, and they
come through superbly over a
churning rhythm section that
features multiple synthesizers,
electric guitars and percussion
instruments.
Thus "Angel" works as a soul
ballad, with David Sanborn's
bittersweet alto sax singing over
the other horns. Vocalist Hannibal
Peterson and trombonist
Tom Malonecarry a straight-ahead
version of "Crosstown Traffic"
that's an excellent example of
how rock can work in a jazz
context.
Other highlights of Evans'
record include guitarist John
Abercrombie's fine solo in
"1983" which never sounds like
Hendrix and Trevor Koehler's
high-powered electric soprano sax
solo on "Gypsy Eyes."
Throughout, Evans and company
have fashioned a jazz-rock blend
that never fails from
over-cautiousness or lack of
musical ideas.
The Jones-Lewis collaboration
as just about every jazz fan
knows, has been producing the
finest big band music anywhere
for the last eight years, but even
so Potpourri is amazingly good.
From the time the album opens
with a pounding string bass solo
by George Mraz and Butter
J a c k son's plunger-muted
trombone lead-in, the music is an
uninterrupted joy.

Thad Jones' four compositions
and his arranging represent no
unusual innovations, just the best
big-band music that anyone has
written in a long time. Mraz,
drummer Lewis, and especially
pianist Roland Hanna, whose
electric playing is the epitome of
precise beauty, provide the
perfect base, the horn soloists like
Jones (flugelhorn) Jerry
Dodgion (alto and flute), Billy
Harper (tenor) and Cecil
Bridgewater (trumpet) take off,
and there's no stopping this band.
The song renditions are all
great, from a rocking rendition of

Stevie Wonder's "Living for the
City," with Buddy Lucas'
harmonica leading off, to
Dodgion's fragile arrangement of
"Ambiance," as beautiful a piece
as any band has recorded. It's
hard to imagine how a big band
could play any better than this.

Goodnight Vienna
Apple SW-3417
Who would have thought in
1951 that Gort, the famous robot
from The Day the Earth Stood
Still, would be on a record cover
in 1975?
Gort is just one of a number of
stars who appear on Ringo Starr's
latest album. Goodnight Vienna,
in an attempt to recapture the
electric spirit that infused his
smash-selling album of a year ago.
.John Lennon, Elton John,
Harry Nilsson, Robbie Robertson,
Billy Preston and Dr. John are
some of the other big names of
the pop world who have lent their
talents to this lush Richard Perry
production.
The trouble is, the material is
too weak to support this galaxy of
musical talent, and the scattershot
nature of the material — a little
rock, a touch of 30s style
nostalgia, a smattering of
country-western — does nothing
to make the album stand out as an
especially good example of
anything.
The 10 songs include three
authored by Ringb, one from
Lennon, one from Elton John,
and even a Roger Miller number.
Of the bunch, only the Lennon
composition, "Goodnight
Vienna," has any real pizzaz,
which must be why it was chosen
for the title cut.
Although the Ringo
composition, "All By Myself,"
and the golden oldie "Only You"
have been receiving most of the
airplay, "Goodnight Vienna," is

by far the most infectious and
upbeat song on the entire record.
Everything else is pleasant but
a bit on the bland side, perhaps
spoiled at times by Ringo's
colorless vocals, which all the
tricks of producer Perry can't
hide, especially on the Nilsson
song, "Easy For Me," that closes
out side two.
It reeks of the Gatsby era and a
sugary romanticizing that Ringo's
voice just can't handle without
sounding cloying. Better than
Nilsson himself should have sung
it.
The essentially
flaccid-in-nice-way aspect of
Goodnight Vienna is captured
best, though, in the Elton
John-Bernie Taupin song,
"Snookeroo," that briefly
chronicles the life of an amiable
ne'er-do-well, who needs someone
to cook for him and "turn me
loose at night."
Essentially that's what Ringo
has done, getting together a group
of his friends to "cook" for him,
while he was turned loose on the
vocals. The only trouble was that
the resulting stew could have used
a trifle more spice.
Perhaps a song from Gort?

Dave Mason
Columbia PC 33046
In his second album for
Columbia, Dave Mason appears to
be catering to the whims of that
company by putting out
competent if erratic records aimed
at mass appeal.
To many listeners this trend is
far from regrettable — if the
current commercial success of the
album via FM airplay is any
indication — but to Mason
devotees like myself these
products fail to sufficiently fulfill
his potential as a premier rock
guitarist.
His latest venture,
appropriately titled Dave Mason
(which, also appropriately, is the
name of his band) suffers from
underexposure of his greatest
asset — his unique electric guitar
solos.
The album is actually quite a
listenable, enjoyable one overall —
a good introduction to his music
for budding fans — and although
it is somewhat disappointing, its
nine offerings are at worst
tolerable and at best superb.
The band, consisting of Mike
Finnigan on keyboards. Bob
Glaub on bass, Rick Jaeger on
drums, and Jim Krieger sharing
guitars with Mason, is tight and
talented in rendering his
distinctively simple songs.
Finnigan especially stands out
as the backbone of the band's
sound and he is an excellent
complement, both vocally and
instrumentally, to Dave's style.

appropriately titled Dave Mason
(which, also appropriately, is the
name of his band) suffers from
underexposure of his greatest
asset — his unique electric guitar
solos.
The album is actually quite a
listenable, enjoyable one overall —
a good introduction to his music
for budding fans — and although
it is somewhat disappointing, its
nine offerings are at worst
tolerable and at best superb.
The band, consisting of Mike
Finnigan on keyboards. Bob
Glaub on bass, Rick Jaeger on
drums, and Jim Krieger sharing
guitars with Mason, is tight and
talented in rendering his
distinctively simple songs.
Finnigan especially stands out
as the backbone of the band's
sound and he is an excellent
complement, both vocally and
instrumentally, to Dave's style.
The two combine quite well on
their rendition of the folk
standard "Bring it on Home to
Me," the resurrection (with steel
guitar) of Mason's love song
"Every Woman," and again on the
subtly simple "Relationships."
The most successful offerings,
however, are the two which
feature Mason's distinctive solos:
"All Along the Watchtower" and
"You Can't Take it When You
Go."
The former is almost worth the
price of the entire record (I take
that back — no record is worth
five bucks), for it is virtually a
solo vehicle for Mason himself; his
vocals are unrestrained and driving
and his guitar soars in majestic
crescendos that take the listener
where only he can take them.
The latter, though, is
unfortunately marred by an
apparently mandatory insertion of
violins that drown out Mason's
riffs, adding to the overall feeling
of frustration this album spurs in
the hearts and ears of hard-core
fans of a great but misguided
guitarist extraordinaire.

The Gil Evans Orchestra
Plays the Music of Jimi Hendrix
RCA CPL 1-0667
Thad Jones & Mel Lewis^MMMHF-
Potpourri
Phila. International KZ 33152
Big band jazz lives, thanks in
good part to the efforts of Gil
Evans' experimental electronic
unit and Thad Jones and Mel
Lewis' incredibly talented 18-man
band. The traditional problems of
adequately capturing the big-band
sound on record have been
admirably solved on buth these
new releases, although the sounds
of the two orchestras are very
different.
Evans, a fine arranger best
known for his late-50s work
with Miles Davis, leads his very
young and gifted band through
some novel interpretations of
Hendrix compositions, and the
result is like no rock music every
recorded. Evans relies heavily on
his soloists to make the
arrangements work, and they
come through superbly over a
churning rhythm section that
features multiple synthesizers,
electric guitars and percussion
instruments.
Thus "Angel" works as a soul
ballad, with David Sanborn's
bittersweet alto sax singing over
the other horns. Vocalist Hannibal
Peterson and trombonist
Tom Malonecarry a straight-ahead
version of "Crosstown Traffic"
that's an excellent example of
how rock can work in a jazz
context.
Other highlights of Evans'
record include guitarist John
Abercrombie's fine solo in
"1983" which never sounds like
Hendrix and Trevor Koehler's
high-powered electric soprano sax
solo on "Gypsy Eyes."
Throughout, Evans and company
have fashioned a jazz-rock blend
that never fails from
over-cautiousness or lack of
musical ideas.
The Jones-Lewis collaboration
as just about every jazz fan
knows, has been producing the
finest big band music anywhere
for the last eight years, but even
so Potpourri is amazingly good.
From the time the album opens
with a pounding string bass solo
by George Mraz and Butter
J a c k son's plunger-muted
trombone lead-in, the music is an
uninterrupted joy.

Thad Jones' four compositions
and his arranging represent no
unusual innovations, just the best
big-band music that anyone has
written in a long time. Mraz,
drummer Lewis, and especially
pianist Roland Hanna, whose
electric playing is the epitome of
precise beauty, provide the
perfect base, the horn soloists like
Jones (flugelhorn) Jerry
Dodgion (alto and flute), Billy
Harper (tenor) and Cecil
Bridgewater (trumpet) take off,
and there's no stopping this band.
The song renditions are all
great, from a rocking rendition of

Stevie Wonder's "Living for the
City," with Buddy Lucas'
harmonica leading off, to
Dodgion's fragile arrangement of
"Ambiance," as beautiful a piece
as any band has recorded. It's
hard to imagine how a big band
could play any better than this.

Goodnight Vienna
Apple SW-3417
Who would have thought in
1951 that Gort, the famous robot
from The Day the Earth Stood
Still, would be on a record cover
in 1975?
Gort is just one of a number of
stars who appear on Ringo Starr's
latest album. Goodnight Vienna,
in an attempt to recapture the
electric spirit that infused his
smash-selling album of a year ago.
.John Lennon, Elton John,
Harry Nilsson, Robbie Robertson,
Billy Preston and Dr. John are
some of the other big names of
the pop world who have lent their
talents to this lush Richard Perry
production.
The trouble is, the material is
too weak to support this galaxy of
musical talent, and the scattershot
nature of the material — a little
rock, a touch of 30s style
nostalgia, a smattering of
country-western — does nothing
to make the album stand out as an
especially good example of
anything.
The 10 songs include three
authored by Ringb, one from
Lennon, one from Elton John,
and even a Roger Miller number.
Of the bunch, only the Lennon
composition, "Goodnight
Vienna," has any real pizzaz,
which must be why it was chosen
for the title cut.
Although the Ringo
composition, "All By Myself,"
and the golden oldie "Only You"
have been receiving most of the
airplay, "Goodnight Vienna," is

by far the most infectious and
upbeat song on the entire record.
Everything else is pleasant but
a bit on the bland side, perhaps
spoiled at times by Ringo's
colorless vocals, which all the
tricks of producer Perry can't
hide, especially on the Nilsson
song, "Easy For Me," that closes
out side two.
It reeks of the Gatsby era and a
sugary romanticizing that Ringo's
voice just can't handle without
sounding cloying. Better than
Nilsson himself should have sung
it.
The essentially
flaccid-in-nice-way aspect of
Goodnight Vienna is captured
best, though, in the Elton
John-Bernie Taupin song,
"Snookeroo," that briefly
chronicles the life of an amiable
ne'er-do-well, who needs someone
to cook for him and "turn me
loose at night."
Essentially that's what Ringo
has done, getting together a group
of his friends to "cook" for him,
while he was turned loose on the
vocals. The only trouble was that
the resulting stew could have used
a trifle more spice.
Perhaps a song from Gort?

Dave Mason
Columbia PC 33046
In his second album for
Columbia, Dave Mason appears to
be catering to the whims of that
company by putting out
competent if erratic records aimed
at mass appeal.
To many listeners this trend is
far from regrettable — if the
current commercial success of the
album via FM airplay is any
indication — but to Mason
devotees like myself these
products fail to sufficiently fulfill
his potential as a premier rock
guitarist.
His latest venture,
appropriately titled Dave Mason
(which, also appropriately, is the
name of his band) suffers from
underexposure of his greatest
asset — his unique electric guitar
solos.
