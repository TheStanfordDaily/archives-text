## 'Express': Subtle Thrills 
### George Powell 
Fans of Agatha Christie have
probably dashed up to San
Francisco by now to see the film
version of Murder on the Orient
Express, a book the grand old
lady had withheld from the movie
industry for 40 years.
But co-producers John
Brabourne and Richard Goodwin
persuaded her that they could give
the two-million-copy selling book
the definitive treatment, much as
they had done with the revered
children's classic, The Tales of
Beatrix Potter.
A lot more people are going to
see Murder on the Orient Express
than ever saw the dancing rabbits

and frogs in Beatrix Potter, and
rightly so.
First of all, director Sidney
Lumet has assembled a huge cast
of international stars, each of
which have at least a bit of acting
to do, rather than getting crushed,
burned or otherwise killed as in
the recent disaster movies.
Secondly, Albert Finney's
portrayal of master detective
Hercule Poirot is interesting and
witty even if you've never read an
Agatha Christie mystery.
Finney is all but unrecognizable
behind pounds of padding, slick
black hair and a Belgian accent, a
far cry from his most famous film
role as Tom Jones a dozen years

ago.
And finally, the sets and
costumes faithfully recreate the
ambience of the mid-1930s when
the Orient Express was the
epitome of luxurious travel across
Europe. Those are the main
reasons for seeing the film.
There are equally valid reasons
that make the film less compelling
than other mystery movies, like
the recent Sleuth, or oldies but
goodies like The Manchurian
Candidate.
Murder is rather static, and gits
off to a slow start. There's no
slam-blam fast-mcrving action of
the kind American audiences are
used to getting from their
detectives.
Instead, Finney as Poirot
builds interest in the character
through careful attention to every
nuance, and this takes time.
The slow buildup continues
until the murder, with each of the
stars (14 including Finney) getting
a chance to do a bit of business to
establish their characters.
Then the murder finally
happens, and if the film has kept
your attention this far, you are
now hooked, and follow Poirot as
he unravels a gargantuan knot of
clues. Everybody could have done
it, yet everybody has an alibi.
With the Orient Express being
conveniently stopped by a
snowdrift blocking the track,
Poirot has only until the drift is
dug through to solve the mystery
and report to authorities in the
next town. So with a time limit
imposed on his sleuthing, Poirot
proceeds to quiz the passengers,
and a formidable questioner he is.
The movie itself isn't quite that
formidable, but Murder on the
Orient Express is sure to entertain
and dazzle without any bombs,
avalanches or other natural
calamities. Charlton Heston is not
one of the stars, either.
Murder on the Orient Express,
rated PG, is currently playing at
the Palo Alto Square 1.
