# DEPRESSION HOT "FOUND"
## Public Offered 1937 U.S Gov't Art Prints 
### 
A series of rare coincidences
has led to the historic discovery
of several thousand sets of full
color antique art prints that were
"lost since 1937." They are now
being offered to the public.
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT
Back in 1937, immediately fol
lowing the depression years, Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt and a select
group of a dozen nationally pro
minent people formed a volun
tary national committee for art
appreciation to create an art pro
gram that would give the public a
well-needed moral lift. It was the
committee's decision to select the
world's most famous paintings
from the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th,
and 20th centuries — the best
paintings of Matisse, Van Gogh,
Gainsborough, Picasso, Gauguin,
Titian, etc., and to reproduce
them in full color as perfectly as
humanly possible and make them
available to the public at a price
within the reach of everyone.
ABANDONED IN 1937
For some unknown reason,
after a quantity of these beautiful
reproductions were made, the en
tire project was abandoned and
this collection of perfect repro
ductions was stored in a Brooklyn
warehouse, where they remained
undisturbed since 1937.
The lost collection was "redis
covered" and leading lithogra
phers and art critics agree that
the subject matter and quality of
detail and color reproduction it
incredibly accurate. Over $500,*
000.00 had been spent to make
engraved glass printing plates.
These authentic orginal 1937
prints are literally collector's
items and have been appraised by
the American Appraisers Assoc.
at $7.00 each*print. Once they
have been sold, there will be no
more available. A truly excellent
art "investment" that makes a
fabulous gift.
AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC
Now, after 38 years these full
color 11" x 14" (ave. siie) prints
are finally available to the'public
at $19.95 for a collection of 18
prints. Send cash, check or mon

A series of rare coincidences
has led to the historic discovery
of several thousand sets of full
color antique art prints that were
"lost since 1937." They are now
being offered to the public.
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT
Back in 1937, immediately fol
lowing the depression years, Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt and a select
group of a dozen nationally pro
minent people formed a volun
tary national committee for art
appreciation to create an art pro
gram that would give the public a
well-needed moral lift. It was the
committee's decision to select the
world's most famous paintings
from the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th,
and 20th centuries — the best
paintings of Matisse, Van Gogh,
Gainsborough, Picasso, Gauguin,
Titian, etc., and to reproduce
them in full color as perfectly as
humanly possible and make them
available to the public at a price
within the reach of everyone.
ABANDONED IN 1937
For some unknown reason,
after a quantity of these beautiful
reproductions were made, the en
tire project was abandoned and
this collection of perfect repro
ductions was stored in a Brooklyn
warehouse, where they remained
undisturbed since 1937.
The lost collection was "redis
covered" and leading lithogra
phers and art critics agree that
the subject matter and quality of
detail and color reproduction it
incredibly accurate. Over $500,*
000.00 had been spent to make
engraved glass printing plates.
These authentic orginal 1937
prints are literally collector's
items and have been appraised by
the American Appraisers Assoc.
at $7.00 each*print. Once they
have been sold, there will be no
more available. A truly excellent
art "investment" that makes a
fabulous gift.
