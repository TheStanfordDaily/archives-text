## Cardinal Baseball: 'Hustling, Energetic' 
### TOM GALLIGAN 
The 1975 Stanford baseball
team is a "hustling, energetic team
that wants to play," according to
Coach Ray Young.
And despite the loss of hard
hitting first baseman Mark Lucich,
third baseman Kim Hannaford,
and pitcher Dave Frost from a
team that was 24-23 and defeated
national champion USC five out
of six times, Young describes this
year's team as a "championship
class ball club."
The Cardinals open their
regular season tomorrow at
Sunken Diamond with a
doubleheader against the
University of San Francisco.
Experience Major Goal
Experience is Young's major
goal for the early part of the
season — experience that will
enable the team to bring home the
bacon once the Pacific Eight
schedule opens on April 4 against
UCLA.
Traditionally Stanford's
strength has been pitching, and
this season should be no different.
The three top starters are
right-handers; Mike Williamson,
All NCAA District 8 and All Pac-8
choice, senior A 1 Arthur and
junior Ken Grolle. Backing up the
top three are lefties Jerry Argust
and John Yandle, along with
righty Bernie Hittner, and Ed
Matta, a transfer from
Claremont-Mudd College.
Matta, a relief specialist, was
named Claremont's MVP in both
1973 and 1974, who can throw
everyday. Sophomores Bruce
Davis and Jim Scharffenberger,
and senior Kent Caldwell round
out the staff.
Pitchers Experienced
Coach Young believes that the
major difference between this

year's club and last year's is that
the pitchers are experienced
Last year at this time, due to
injuries, the Cards had only one
experienced pitcher on the staff.
This season, if anything, there are
too many pitchers, and Young
plans to use some of his hurlers at
the J.V. level on their off days
Catchers Bruce Robinson and
Dave Baker, both of whom can
hit, will alternate behind the
plate.
"They're both excellent
defensive catchers," Young says,
"and they're both fine hitters.
We'll play them both in the
line-up at the same time — one at
catcher and the other in the
outfield or as the designated
hitter."
Shortstop Steve Davis, who hit
.309 in each of the last two years
will be back after leading the U.S.
team to the World Amateur
Baseball title in November. Soph
Gary Pitchford who hit a .302 last
season, joins Davis on the left side
of the infield as third baseman.
First and Second Open
Young says there is fierce
competition for both the first and
second base positions. Frosh Tom
Guardino is battling Senior Craig
Morton for the first base job.
Dave Perez, also a freshman, is
holding his own against junior
Gary Bei at the keystone.
The left-handed hitting
freshmen, Pepe Hinojosa and
Randy Wong, are making strong
bids for spots in the outfield along
with seniors Dave Hampton,
Keith Sullivan and Bill Lockwood
and last year's leading JV hitter,
sophomore Steve Abdo.
"We'll have outstanding
fielding in the outfield," Young
says."The only question mark is
hitting."
