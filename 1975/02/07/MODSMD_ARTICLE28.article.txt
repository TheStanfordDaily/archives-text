SAILING, SAILINGâ€”The Stanford Sailing team, rated "pretty good" by captain Tom Winokeur, is
travelling to New Orleans this weekend to participate in the Windjammer Regatta hosted by Tulane
University. The Card boatpeople, Winokeur, Brad Mills, Allan Andrews, and Jody McVitte (one of the
few women competing in major sailing competition) will race against a field of sailors that includes
nationally ranked Florida, Yale, and San Diego, in boats like the 420s pictured above. Stanford is
coached by Wim Steenbakker, a former Dutch National Team member.
