# Women Cagers Roll Over Cal, 49-38
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
BERKELEY-At least one Stanford
varsity basketball team won at Harmon Gym
this season. The women's varsity beat their
Cal counterparts 49-38 at Berkeley on
Wednesday night. The Cards' season record is
now 2-0.
Stanford put the game out of reach in the
first half. After trailing for the first five
minutes, center Maggie Nelson scored six
quick points on inside moves and the Cards
took the lead for good. Nelson finished with
11 points for the half and, combining this
with a good zone defense, Stanford stretched
its lead to 33-20 at intermission.
The Cards came out ve»y cold at the start
of the second half. They managed only two
points in the first eight minutes. But the
Bears only managed eight points in the same
time as the Cards zone forced them to take
poor outside shots. The Stanford guards also
used a full-court press to run down the

30-second clock and cause several turnovers.
Both teams traded baskets for the last ten
minutes of the game, with the Cards always
leading by more than nine.
Stanford dominated the boards, pulling
down 74 rebounds. Onnie Killefer was
especially effective in limiting the Bears to
one shot each trip down the court in the
second half. She finished with 21 rebounds
and 11 points for the game.
The Stanford junior varsity also moved
their record to 2-0 as they downed Cal's JV
team 32-25. After falling behind at the
beginning of the game, Stanford's Leslie
Stovall put in eight points and the lead was
disputed for the rest of the half. The Cards
led at intermission 12-11.
The second half was as close as the first.
Only good outside shooting by the Bears
offset Stanford's dominance of the boards.
Lisa Kolp and Yolanda Galvan made the

defensive backboards the Cards' possession,
but Stanford was unable to pull away. The
game was within 3 points until the last 1:33,
when a steal by guard Cathleen Chase iced
the game.
The Stanford women will be away from
home until February 22. They will take their
unbeaten records to Cal State-Hay ward next
Wednesday night.
