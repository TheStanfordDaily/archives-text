# Educators To Discuss Innovations
## 
### RICHARD CHONG 
Chairman of the board at age 15. A
13-vear-old city planner for Seattle.
Junior high students digging for
archaeological finds in Africa.
These are just a few of the many
roles that simulation games have made
possible for pre-high school students.
The games and other new educational
programs will be the subject of a
conference scheduled this summer at
the School of Education.
The 10-day conference is designed
to help orient elementary school
administrators to new social studies
teaching methods.
Funding for the conference will be
provided by a $29,600 National
Science Foundation grant to
Education Prof. Richard Gross.
Gross said the school has sponsored
similar conferences for the last seven
years. They try to introduce the
administrators to innovative education
projects such as community-involve
ment programs or classroom
simulation games.
Interview Community
One community-involvement
program allows students to leave the
classroom and interview members of
the local community. The goal is to
help students' study of economic,
social and political class separation.
