# Educators To Discuss Innovations
## 
### RICHARD CHONG 
Chairman of the board at age 15. A
13-vear-old city planner for Seattle.
Junior high students digging for
archaeological finds in Africa.
These are just a few of the many
roles that simulation games have made
possible for pre-high school students.
The games and other new educational
programs will be the subject of a
conference scheduled this summer at
the School of Education.
The 10-day conference is designed
to help orient elementary school
administrators to new social studies
teaching methods.
Funding for the conference will be
provided by a $29,600 National
Science Foundation grant to
Education Prof. Richard Gross.
Gross said the school has sponsored
similar conferences for the last seven
years. They try to introduce the
administrators to innovative education
projects such as community-involve
ment programs or classroom
simulation games.
Interview Community
One community-involvement
program allows students to leave the
classroom and interview members of
the local community. The goal is to
help students' study of economic,
social and political class separation.
Most of the programs are
simulation games, in which students
learn through experience instead of
formal classroom training.
A new method Gross will introduce
this summer to teach students the
importance of cooperation involves
seal hunting. Each student plays an
eskimo hunting for seals. The game is
designed to punish independent action
by the students with disaster. Soon.it
becomes clear that teamwork and
planning are necessary to capture any
seals.
Urban Planning
Other games concentrate on
economic planning, anthropological
digging and even urban planning. Gross
said.
In the urban planning game,
students are required to build a city
knowing only the geography of the
land and the costs of materials and
labor. They learn the basic principles
of city planning through the simulated
building of Seattle.
Gross said the advancement of new
education ideas has been hindered by a
conservative movement among
educators, complacency among
teachers and administrators' lack of
understanding about the programs.
Gross hopes the conference will
help counteract these factors.
