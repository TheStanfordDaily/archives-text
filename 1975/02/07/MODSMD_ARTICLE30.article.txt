# Cagers Down WSU
## 
### DAN PYNE 
For 12 minutes in the first half
of last night's Stanford-Wash
ington State basketball game, the
Cards were flat-footed and
fumble-fingered.
Washington State was leading
12-8, and it looked like upset-time
in the snowy Northwest.
But for the next 20 minutes
the Cardinals displayed some of
their old form, scoring 42 points
to the Cougars' 12, and sealing a
convincing 71-58 victory over the
hapless Pullman five.
Center Rich Kelley, still
recovering from an illness, did not
start. But after it became evident
Tim Patterson could not contain
WSU's Steve Puidokas, Kelley
came in and finished the game
with 10 points.
Puidokas led all scorers with 23
points, but the Cards held him to
only five for two-thirds of the
game. Stanford's Ed Schweitzer
dropped in 22 points to lead the
Card offensive.
Washington State's big trouble
was containing the Cards. The
Cougars ran a 2-1-2 zone defense
for awhile and were down at
halftime 30-20. But in the second
half they came out with a
man-to-man and were literally
blown off the court.
Stanford scored eight points
before the Cougars could put in a
basket, and built up a

commanding 50-24 lead with 10
minutes remaining. The Cougars
tried to regroup, and ran through
three more full-court-press zone
variations; a 1-2-1, then a 2-2-1
and finally a 3-2 half-couri press.
Nothing worked.
On offense the Cougars were
unable to get the ball to Puidokas
for most of the game, and that all
but shut down their attack.
Stanford ran a man-to-man
defense for four minutes of the
first half, then set up in a 3-2 zone
for the remainder of the game.
Mark Gilberg played one of the
best games of his career, hitting 5
of 7 (including three long bombs)
and netting 10 points.
The Cards are in Seattle
tomorrow to play Washington,
which demolished Cal last night,
83-57.
