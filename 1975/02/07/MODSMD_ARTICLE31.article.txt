# Swimmers Face UCLA
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
Two Pac-8 powerhouses,
Stanford and UCLA, square off
tomorrow at 1 p.m. in an
important dual meet. The Bruins
are "solid right down the line"
according to just about everybody
involved in NCAA swimming.
The meet marks the return of
former Olympic Coach George
Haines to the Bay Area. Haines,
noted for his construction of a
virtual swimming dynasty while
coaching at the Santa Clara Swim
Club, is in his initial season of
coaching at UCLA.
"George and I go way back,"
says Stanford Coach Jim
Goughran, adding that, "He
certainly has left his mark on
swimming." Several Stanford
swimmers also "go way back"
with Haines, most notably
Ail-American breaststroker John
Hencken and Butterflyer Brian
Roux.
If all goes well, Gaughran
thinks that his swimmers will
come out on top "by one to three
points."
