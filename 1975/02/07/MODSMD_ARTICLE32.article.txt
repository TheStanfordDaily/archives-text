# Pro Prognosis
## WBC: A Slimy Organization 
### Glenn Garvin 
There are a lot of slimy people
in this world. Start with Jerry
Brown, who should be at the top
of anybody's All Slime team. Add
Marlon Brando. Then there's
Marvin Miller, whose performance
as director of the professional
baseball players' union has been
admirably eel-like.
Add the University of
Southern California. And of
course there's practically
everybody who's ever been an
ASSU president. As you can see,
the roster of snakes in sheep's
clothing is a large one.
But there's one group that has
consistently been in the forefront
of the fight to bury the world in
six feet of scum. And its latest
ploy should advance the cause a
long way.
If you haven't guessed at this
point, it's the people who run
professional boxing. In terms of
sheer petty tyranny they can hold
their own with anyone. Captain
Queeg would have been proud to
have them along.
WBC Noise
The World Boxing Council
during the last few weeks has been
making a lot of noise about
Muhammad Ali's plans to defend
his heavyweight title against
Chuck Wepner."Chuck Who?"you
might ask with some justification,
because it's true Wepner isn't
among the premier fighters in the
ring.
That's what the WBC is so
exercised about. Wepner is not on
the sanitized, approved list of the
top 10 challengers for Ali's title —
and so the WBC won't sanction
the fight. In fact, the organization
has threatened to strip Ali of the
crown if he goes ahead with it.
That's just fine. It took the
boxing bureaucracy to beat Ali
out of the title before, when it
became apparent that no human
being was going to be able to do
the job. After Ali was convicted
of draft evasion — but before he
finished appealing the case — the
various boxing groups around the
United States refused to grant Ali
a license to fight. Since he
couldn't leave the country while
his case was pending, that meant
the world heavyweight champion

couldn't fight anyone.
Finally the WBC decided to
strip Ali of the title, although the
connection between his draft
status and his fighting ability was
pretty nebulous — and despite the
fact that his appeals were still
being processed. V/ hen the
Supreme Court eventually
overturned Ali's conviction,
nobody was sorrier than the fat
little men who oversee boxing.
And nobody was happier than the
boxing fans who could see the
world's greatest fighter in action
once more.
Now they're at it again. It's
t p ue Chuck Wepner isn't the ideal
challenger. But Ali was by far the
most open heavyweight champ of
all time during his last title reign,
defending the title against anyone
stupid enough to climb into a ring
vith him. And he's announced
that he'll take on George
Foreman, Ron Lyle and Joe
Frazier in the months ahead.
Another, more interesting
question is why the WBC didn't
take action when then-champion
Frazier took on such stiffs as
Terry Daniels and Ron Stander.
Or when champion Foreman
fought Joe Roman, if you care to
call such a mismatch a fight.
The answer is not too tough, if
you think about it. It's that the
boxing establishment has never
been able to accept the fact that a
crazy Black Muslim who admits
he doesn't think a whole lot of
white people is the champ.
So the WBC will go ahead and
strip Ali of the title, but that

%/
won't mean he's not the champ.
And if the council thinks that the
mouthings of a few slimy
bureaucrats will take in the
world's boxing fans, then it's even
dumber than we've always
thought.

his heavyweight title against
Chuck Wepner."Chuck Who?"you
might ask with some justification,
because it's true Wepner isn't
among the premier fighters in the
ring.
That's what the WBC is so
exercised about. Wepner is not on
the sanitized, approved list of the
top 10 challengers for Ali's title —
and so the WBC won't sanction
the fight. In fact, the organization
has threatened to strip Ali of the
crown if he goes ahead with it.
That's just fine. It took the
boxing bureaucracy to beat Ali
out of the title before, when it
became apparent that no human
being was going to be able to do
the job. After Ali was convicted
of draft evasion — but before he
finished appealing the case — the
various boxing groups around the
United States refused to grant Ali
a license to fight. Since he
couldn't leave the country while
his case was pending, that meant
the world heavyweight champion

couldn't fight anyone.
Finally the WBC decided to
strip Ali of the title, although the
connection between his draft
status and his fighting ability was
pretty nebulous — and despite the
fact that his appeals were still
being processed. V/ hen the
Supreme Court eventually
overturned Ali's conviction,
nobody was sorrier than the fat
little men who oversee boxing.
And nobody was happier than the
boxing fans who could see the
world's greatest fighter in action
once more.
Now they're at it again. It's
t p ue Chuck Wepner isn't the ideal
challenger. But Ali was by far the
most open heavyweight champ of
all time during his last title reign,
defending the title against anyone
stupid enough to climb into a ring
vith him. And he's announced
that he'll take on George
Foreman, Ron Lyle and Joe
Frazier in the months ahead.
Another, more interesting
question is why the WBC didn't
take action when then-champion
Frazier took on such stiffs as
Terry Daniels and Ron Stander.
Or when champion Foreman
fought Joe Roman, if you care to
call such a mismatch a fight.
The answer is not too tough, if
you think about it. It's that the
boxing establishment has never
been able to accept the fact that a
crazy Black Muslim who admits
he doesn't think a whole lot of
white people is the champ.
So the WBC will go ahead and
strip Ali of the title, but that

%/
won't mean he's not the champ.
And if the council thinks that the
mouthings of a few slimy
bureaucrats will take in the
world's boxing fans, then it's even
dumber than we've always
thought.
There are a lot of slimy people
in this world. Start with Jerry
Brown, who should be at the top
of anybody's All Slime team. Add
Marlon Brando. Then there's
Marvin Miller, whose performance
as director of the professional
baseball players' union has been
admirably eel-like.
Add the University of
Southern California. And of
course there's practically
everybody who's ever been an
ASSU president. As you can see,
the roster of snakes in sheep's
clothing is a large one.
But there's one group that has
consistently been in the forefront
of the fight to bury the world in
six feet of scum. And its latest
ploy should advance the cause a
long way.
If you haven't guessed at this
point, it's the people who run
professional boxing. In terms of
sheer petty tyranny they can hold
their own with anyone. Captain
Queeg would have been proud to
have them along.
