# IM Roundup
## 'Seek And Destroy' 
### PETE BHATIA 
If you've been wondering who
is going to win the "A" basketball
intramural championship this
year, well, look no further. For
today the always controversial IM
Roundup turns to perhaps the
best IM basketball team organized
in the last five years.
That team is Seek and Destroy.
It is a team put together by
Stanford varsity basketball
manager Mark Florant, and
composed essentially of people
who were cut from the varisty
squad.
Their "awesomeness" can be
understood by examining the
statistics from their last outing,
Wednesday night, when they
humiliated a team from the
Firehouse 104-30.
Six players played in that game
for Seek and Destroy, six players
scored and six players were in
double figures. Former player
Steve Kristovich lead the way
with 25, followed by Bill Whiting
with 23. George Pettinger, better
known for his work on the golf
links, added 16, followed by Mike
Hlenehan with 15. Former varsity
player Marty Moroski pitched in
14 while former JV piaver Brad
Power contributed 11. "Coach"
Florant missed the game while
traveling with the varsity Cards in
the Northwest.
Right now, it appears only one
team veally has a chance to match

Seek and Destroy. That team is
the Phi Delts, led by football
tight-end Mark Hoaglin and
hot-shooting Kurt Peterson.
Although S & D's stats from
the last outing don't show it,
Moroski is the key to their attack.
Moroski, who quit the varsity
earlier this season because he
didn't feel he was having any fun,
would have seen considerable
action for Stanford this year. On
the IM courts, there hasn't been
anyone so far who can come near
to him.
However, there are still several
undefeated "A" teams left with a
week of the regular season still to
play. Aside from the Phi Delts,
Adelfa, SAE, Nickel Bag and the
Zetes remain with unscathed
records.
In one of the best-played
games of the season the Zetes
edged a previously unbeaten
Arroyo squad 59-53 last Tuesday.
In that game, two players fresh
off the tennis courts couldn't miss
from the outside. Craig Johnson
led those bombers with 27 while
his tennis-mate Nick Saviano
netted 25. The leading point
getter for the Arroyans was Steve
Robinson with 14. Arroyo led
most of the game via their own
hot shooting but the Zetes scored
eight straight points with five
minutes remaining in the game to
salt away the win.

most of the game via their own
hot shooting but the Zetes scored
eight straight points with five
minutes remaining in the game to
salt away the win.
If you've been wondering who
is going to win the "A" basketball
intramural championship this
year, well, look no further. For
today the always controversial IM
Roundup turns to perhaps the
best IM basketball team organized
in the last five years.
That team is Seek and Destroy.
It is a team put together by
Stanford varsity basketball
manager Mark Florant, and
composed essentially of people
who were cut from the varisty
squad.
Their "awesomeness" can be
understood by examining the
statistics from their last outing,
Wednesday night, when they
humiliated a team from the
Firehouse 104-30.
Six players played in that game
for Seek and Destroy, six players
scored and six players were in
double figures. Former player
Steve Kristovich lead the way
with 25, followed by Bill Whiting
with 23. George Pettinger, better
known for his work on the golf
links, added 16, followed by Mike
Hlenehan with 15. Former varsity
player Marty Moroski pitched in
14 while former JV piaver Brad
Power contributed 11. "Coach"
Florant missed the game while
traveling with the varsity Cards in
the Northwest.
Right now, it appears only one
team veally has a chance to match

Seek and Destroy. That team is
the Phi Delts, led by football
tight-end Mark Hoaglin and
hot-shooting Kurt Peterson.
Although S & D's stats from
the last outing don't show it,
Moroski is the key to their attack.
Moroski, who quit the varsity
earlier this season because he
didn't feel he was having any fun,
would have seen considerable
action for Stanford this year. On
the IM courts, there hasn't been
anyone so far who can come near
to him.
However, there are still several
undefeated "A" teams left with a
week of the regular season still to
play. Aside from the Phi Delts,
Adelfa, SAE, Nickel Bag and the
Zetes remain with unscathed
records.
In one of the best-played
games of the season the Zetes
edged a previously unbeaten
Arroyo squad 59-53 last Tuesday.
In that game, two players fresh
off the tennis courts couldn't miss
from the outside. Craig Johnson
led those bombers with 27 while
his tennis-mate Nick Saviano
netted 25. The leading point
getter for the Arroyans was Steve
Robinson with 14. Arroyo led
most of the game via their own
hot shooting but the Zetes scored
eight straight points with five
minutes remaining in the game to
salt away the win.
