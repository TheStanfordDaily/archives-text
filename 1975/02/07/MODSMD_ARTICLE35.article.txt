# BATS Team Takes On Card Ruggers
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Tomorrow afternoon a strange
caravan will somehow find its way
to Harry Maloney Field for a
rugby game. Included in it will be
an old World War II ambulance, a
mobile home with bats
emblazoned on it and a couple of
car loads of rugger huggers
This is the entourage of the
Bay Area Touring Side (BATS),
the rugby team many consider the
best in America. BATS members

pay their own way from as far
away as Stockton for the privilege
of playing rugby. San Francisco
Chronicle sports reporter A 1 Moss,
the BATS' self appointed general
manager and PR man, is a rotund
fortyish gentleman who has never
played rugby. Yet Moss
contributes 10 hours a week to
running the team.
The BATS' 16-year history is
varied. The club evolved out of a
group of California alumni who
wanted to continue their love
affair with the sport.
BATS In Flux
The club is currently in a state
of change. It has a
new Farm look with the
addition of three Stanford ruggers
— Eric Test, Gordy Riegel and
assistant football coach Doug
Single. The BATS' Stanford
contingent now totals seven.
Former New England Patriot
Ron Kadziel and Palo Alto
attorney Kip Oxman represent the
old Stanford Indians on BATS.
"I guess you could say that
we've taken on a definite Stanford
flavor," Moss said. "We've always
sought the best rugby players and
Stanford seems to be turning
them out." Moss attributed the
high number of former Stanford
ruggers to a rebuilding campaign.
"We had to rebuild our scrum this
year, and last year's Stanford
scrum was one of the best
around ... so we asked a few of
them to join us."
And in a few years BATS'
entire side may come from the
Farm, says Oxman. "The BATS
are developing into a Stanford
alumni team. Cal has the same
thing only they call it the old
Blues. I don't think we'll change
our name to the old Reds, but
depending on how good the
Stanford rugby team is we'll
probably keep having more and
more Stanford people."
The BATS are an extremely
close-knit group, and the Stanford
members fit in well, says Oxman,
who has been a BAT for three
years. "For those of us from
Stanford there's been a dramatic

change. In the past we had to
break through relationships that
had already developed among the
BATS, but this year has been
different. The Stanford
contingent has fit in very nicely."
"I guess the best thing we find
in the BATS is camaraderie.. The
game of rugby is like football, yet
the mental thing is different.
There's less brotherhood in
football."
This weekend is a big football
recruiting weekend and the
recruits will be treated to the
rugby game. Single says he hopes
the recruits don't get the wrong
idea about an assistant football
coach playing on a rugby team.

"I'm still young and I enjoy
playing on the BATS. I just love
it. It'll be a lot of fun having all
those recruits up here but I hope
they don't get the wrong idea."
Card rugby coach Pete
Kmetovic, who coached all the
Stanford alumni on the BATS,
says that he won't have a vested
interest in tomorrow's game. "I
guess I hope everyone does wpll.
It's a kind of pride thing." Yet
Kmetovic says his Cards have a
chance to beat the nation's best
team. "If we get a dry field it
should be a real wide open game.
They have an experienced scrum,
but it's not an overpowering one."
He should know. He's coached
both teams.

ruggers to a rebuilding campaign.
"We had to rebuild our scrum this
year, and last year's Stanford
scrum was one of the best
around ... so we asked a few of
them to join us."
And in a few years BATS'
entire side may come from the
Farm, says Oxman. "The BATS
are developing into a Stanford
alumni team. Cal has the same
thing only they call it the old
Blues. I don't think we'll change
our name to the old Reds, but
depending on how good the
Stanford rugby team is we'll
probably keep having more and
more Stanford people."
The BATS are an extremely
close-knit group, and the Stanford
members fit in well, says Oxman,
who has been a BAT for three
years. "For those of us from
Stanford there's been a dramatic

change. In the past we had to
break through relationships that
had already developed among the
BATS, but this year has been
different. The Stanford
contingent has fit in very nicely."
"I guess the best thing we find
in the BATS is camaraderie.. The
game of rugby is like football, yet
the mental thing is different.
There's less brotherhood in
football."
This weekend is a big football
recruiting weekend and the
recruits will be treated to the
rugby game. Single says he hopes
the recruits don't get the wrong
idea about an assistant football
coach playing on a rugby team.

"I'm still young and I enjoy
playing on the BATS. I just love
it. It'll be a lot of fun having all
those recruits up here but I hope
they don't get the wrong idea."
Card rugby coach Pete
Kmetovic, who coached all the
Stanford alumni on the BATS,
says that he won't have a vested
interest in tomorrow's game. "I
guess I hope everyone does wpll.
It's a kind of pride thing." Yet
Kmetovic says his Cards have a
chance to beat the nation's best
team. "If we get a dry field it
should be a real wide open game.
They have an experienced scrum,
but it's not an overpowering one."
He should know. He's coached
both teams.
Tomorrow afternoon a strange
caravan will somehow find its way
to Harry Maloney Field for a
rugby game. Included in it will be
an old World War II ambulance, a
mobile home with bats
emblazoned on it and a couple of
car loads of rugger huggers
This is the entourage of the
Bay Area Touring Side (BATS),
the rugby team many consider the
best in America. BATS members

pay their own way from as far
away as Stockton for the privilege
of playing rugby. San Francisco
Chronicle sports reporter A 1 Moss,
the BATS' self appointed general
manager and PR man, is a rotund
fortyish gentleman who has never
played rugby. Yet Moss
contributes 10 hours a week to
running the team.
The BATS' 16-year history is
varied. The club evolved out of a
group of California alumni who
wanted to continue their love
affair with the sport.
BATS In Flux
The club is currently in a state
of change. It has a
new Farm look with the
addition of three Stanford ruggers
— Eric Test, Gordy Riegel and
assistant football coach Doug
Single. The BATS' Stanford
contingent now totals seven.
Former New England Patriot
Ron Kadziel and Palo Alto
attorney Kip Oxman represent the
old Stanford Indians on BATS.
"I guess you could say that
we've taken on a definite Stanford
flavor," Moss said. "We've always
sought the best rugby players and
Stanford seems to be turning
them out." Moss attributed the
high number of former Stanford
ruggers to a rebuilding campaign.
