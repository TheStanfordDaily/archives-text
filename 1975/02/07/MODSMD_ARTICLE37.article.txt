Jackson Declares Candidacy
WASHINGTON — Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington
formally unveiled his candidacy for the 1976 Democratic
presidential nomination last night by pledging to use the
White House "to help the people in this country who are
getting hurt."
Considered by many Democrats the closest thing to a
front-runner in a growing, wide-open race, Jackson has
already raised at least $1 million, more than any potential
candidate except Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace. The
62-year-old senator, who has been running ever since he
flopped in his party's 1972 race, made his formal
declaration in a five-minute, filmed telecast after the CBS
Thursday Night Movie's showing of Dillinger.
He thus joined Rep. Morris K. Udall of Arizona, former
Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia and former Sen. Fred R.
Harris of Oklahoma in a field that will include Sen. Lloyd
M. Bentsen Jr. of Texas on Feb. 17.
House Panel Approves Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and Means
Committee approved last night a $20.1 billion economic
emergency tax cut bill.
By a 28-5 vote, the panel adopted a measure which calls
for $8 billion in 1974 tax rebates, $8.3 billion in further
permanent tax cuts this year and $3.8 billion in business
tax reductions.
Rep. A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.), the committee chairman,
congratulated his panel for being "way ahead of schedule"
in taking quick action on the major tax measure.
Details of exactly how the individual tax rebate for 1974
would work under the legislation remained to be
determined by the committee's tax staff experts.
Bomb Rocks KRON-TV
SAN FRANCISCO — A bomb rocked a local television
station building shortly last night after a telephoned
warning from the terrorist New World Liberation Front,
police said. There were no injuries.
KRON-TV received the call about 11:20 p.m. According
to a KRON newsman, the anonymous caller said: "I'm
from the New World Liberation Front. There's a bomb set
to go off in your building in five minutes."
"I felt the explosion on the fourth floor," the newsman
said. "It was pretty big."
Dairy Donations Revealed
WASHINGTON — The nation's three largest
dairy-farmer cooperatives donated a last-minute total of
$67,670 in the 1974 Senate and House races, just before
Congress tried to raise milk price supports.
Much of the money came in six large donations given in
a way that prevented disclosure until long after the
election. An additional $5000 appears to have passed

through a Democratic party committee in possible violation
of House rules, although the recipient denied this.
The co-ops' campaign finance reports show they retain
important friends in Congress but still are suffering from
the effects of last year's disclosures of their past political
activities.
One freshman congressman gave back a $5000 donation
because it was "tainted" money, according to a spokesman.
Two other $5000 donations also were returned to the
dairymen.
The co-ops gave a total of $293,300 to Senate and
House candidates during all of 1974.
This was far below their usual giving, and left them with
the largest treasury of unspent political cash in the nation,
$2.3 million.
Of the total donated to the Senate and House
candidates, $151,655 went to 62 incumbent members of
the House. Not all of them voted for the bill to raise milk
prices, which was passed the night Congress adjourned on
Dec. 20. But of those who got dairy money, the aye votes
outnumbered the nays five to one.
Peruvian Army Inflicts Casualties
LIMA, Peni — The army said yesterday its forces
inflicted a "large number" of casualties in mop-up
operations following the worst rioting against President
Juan Velasco's leftist military regime in six years. Unofficial
sources put the number of dead between 30 and 50 and the
wounded between 100 and 1000.
The government also declared a "holiday" in Peru in an
attempt to keep looting and casualties under control. The
riots were touched off by a policemen's strike for higher
pay. There were reliable reports the strike had been settled,
but the police were not seen on the streets yesterday.
Battle Rages In Ethiopia
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Some 6000 secessionist
guerrillas ringed the Eritrean capital of Asmara yesterday,
choking off its 200,000 residents from much-needed food,
water and fuel, diplomatic sources said.
Fears of a typhoid epidemic also were expressed by 300
Italian women and children airlifted out of Asmara.
Diplomatic sources said the Ethiopian government had
turned down an offer by the International Red Cross to aid
victims of the week-old fighting in northernmost Eritrea
province, but did not say why. They said the offer was in
response to pleas by several foreign embassies

White House "to help the people in this country who are

Considered by many Democrats the closest thing to a
front-runner in a growing, wide-open race, Jackson has
already raised at least $1 million, more than any potential
candidate except Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace. The

presidential nomination last night by pledging to use the
White House "to help the people in this country who are
getting hurt."
Considered by many Democrats the closest thing to a
front-runner in a growing, wide-open race, Jackson has
already raised at least $1 million, more than any potential
candidate except Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace. The
62-year-old senator, who has been running ever since he
flopped in his party's 1972 race, made his formal
declaration in a five-minute, filmed telecast after the CBS
Thursday Night Movie's showing of Dillinger.
He thus joined Rep. Morris K. Udall of Arizona, former
Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia and former Sen. Fred R.
Harris of Oklahoma in a field that will include Sen. Lloyd
M. Bentsen Jr. of Texas on Feb. 17.
House Panel Approves Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and Means
Committee approved last night a $20.1 billion economic
emergency tax cut bill.
By a 28-5 vote, the panel adopted a measure which calls
for $8 billion in 1974 tax rebates, $8.3 billion in further
permanent tax cuts this year and $3.8 billion in business
tax reductions.
Rep. A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.), the committee chairman,
congratulated his panel for being "way ahead of schedule"
in taking quick action on the major tax measure.
Details of exactly how the individual tax rebate for 1974
would work under the legislation remained to be
determined by the committee's tax staff experts.
Bomb Rocks KRON-TV
SAN FRANCISCO — A bomb rocked a local television
station building shortly last night after a telephoned
warning from the terrorist New World Liberation Front,
police said. There were no injuries.
KRON-TV received the call about 11:20 p.m. According
to a KRON newsman, the anonymous caller said: "I'm
from the New World Liberation Front. There's a bomb set
to go off in your building in five minutes."
"I felt the explosion on the fourth floor," the newsman
said. "It was pretty big."
Dairy Donations Revealed
WASHINGTON — The nation's three largest
dairy-farmer cooperatives donated a last-minute total of
$67,670 in the 1974 Senate and House races, just before
Congress tried to raise milk price supports.
Much of the money came in six large donations given in
a way that prevented disclosure until long after the
election. An additional $5000 appears to have passed

through a Democratic party committee in possible violation
of House rules, although the recipient denied this.
The co-ops' campaign finance reports show they retain
important friends in Congress but still are suffering from
the effects of last year's disclosures of their past political
activities.
One freshman congressman gave back a $5000 donation
because it was "tainted" money, according to a spokesman.
Two other $5000 donations also were returned to the
dairymen.
The co-ops gave a total of $293,300 to Senate and
House candidates during all of 1974.
This was far below their usual giving, and left them with
the largest treasury of unspent political cash in the nation,
$2.3 million.
Of the total donated to the Senate and House
candidates, $151,655 went to 62 incumbent members of
the House. Not all of them voted for the bill to raise milk
prices, which was passed the night Congress adjourned on
Dec. 20. But of those who got dairy money, the aye votes
outnumbered the nays five to one.
Peruvian Army Inflicts Casualties
LIMA, Peni — The army said yesterday its forces
inflicted a "large number" of casualties in mop-up
operations following the worst rioting against President
Juan Velasco's leftist military regime in six years. Unofficial
sources put the number of dead between 30 and 50 and the
wounded between 100 and 1000.
The government also declared a "holiday" in Peru in an
attempt to keep looting and casualties under control. The
riots were touched off by a policemen's strike for higher
pay. There were reliable reports the strike had been settled,
but the police were not seen on the streets yesterday.
Battle Rages In Ethiopia
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Some 6000 secessionist
guerrillas ringed the Eritrean capital of Asmara yesterday,
choking off its 200,000 residents from much-needed food,
water and fuel, diplomatic sources said.
Fears of a typhoid epidemic also were expressed by 300
Italian women and children airlifted out of Asmara.
Diplomatic sources said the Ethiopian government had
turned down an offer by the International Red Cross to aid
victims of the week-old fighting in northernmost Eritrea
province, but did not say why. They said the offer was in
response to pleas by several foreign embassies

front-runner in a growing, wide-open race, Jackson has
already raised at least $1 million, more than any potential

White House "to help the people in this country who are
getting hurt."
Considered by many Democrats the closest thing to a
front-runner in a growing, wide-open race, Jackson has
already raised at least $1 million, more than any potential
candidate except Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace. The
62-year-old senator, who has been running ever since he
flopped in his party's 1972 race, made his formal
declaration in a five-minute, filmed telecast after the CBS
Thursday Night Movie's showing of Dillinger.
He thus joined Rep. Morris K. Udall of Arizona, former
Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia and former Sen. Fred R.
Harris of Oklahoma in a field that will include Sen. Lloyd
M. Bentsen Jr. of Texas on Feb. 17.
House Panel Approves Tax Cuts
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and Means
Committee approved last night a $20.1 billion economic
emergency tax cut bill.
By a 28-5 vote, the panel adopted a measure which calls
for $8 billion in 1974 tax rebates, $8.3 billion in further
permanent tax cuts this year and $3.8 billion in business
tax reductions.
Rep. A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.), the committee chairman,
congratulated his panel for being "way ahead of schedule"
in taking quick action on the major tax measure.
Details of exactly how the individual tax rebate for 1974
would work under the legislation remained to be
determined by the committee's tax staff experts.
Bomb Rocks KRON-TV
SAN FRANCISCO — A bomb rocked a local television
station building shortly last night after a telephoned
warning from the terrorist New World Liberation Front,
police said. There were no injuries.
KRON-TV received the call about 11:20 p.m. According
to a KRON newsman, the anonymous caller said: "I'm
from the New World Liberation Front. There's a bomb set
to go off in your building in five minutes."
"I felt the explosion on the fourth floor," the newsman
said. "It was pretty big."
Dairy Donations Revealed
WASHINGTON — The nation's three largest
dairy-farmer cooperatives donated a last-minute total of
$67,670 in the 1974 Senate and House races, just before
Congress tried to raise milk price supports.
Much of the money came in six large donations given in
a way that prevented disclosure until long after the
election. An additional $5000 appears to have passed

through a Democratic party committee in possible violation
of House rules, although the recipient denied this.
The co-ops' campaign finance reports show they retain
important friends in Congress but still are suffering from
the effects of last year's disclosures of their past political
activities.
One freshman congressman gave back a $5000 donation
because it was "tainted" money, according to a spokesman.
Two other $5000 donations also were returned to the
dairymen.
The co-ops gave a total of $293,300 to Senate and
House candidates during all of 1974.
This was far below their usual giving, and left them with
the largest treasury of unspent political cash in the nation,
$2.3 million.
Of the total donated to the Senate and House
candidates, $151,655 went to 62 incumbent members of
the House. Not all of them voted for the bill to raise milk
prices, which was passed the night Congress adjourned on
Dec. 20. But of those who got dairy money, the aye votes
outnumbered the nays five to one.
Peruvian Army Inflicts Casualties
LIMA, Peni — The army said yesterday its forces
inflicted a "large number" of casualties in mop-up
operations following the worst rioting against President
Juan Velasco's leftist military regime in six years. Unofficial
sources put the number of dead between 30 and 50 and the
wounded between 100 and 1000.
The government also declared a "holiday" in Peru in an
attempt to keep looting and casualties under control. The
riots were touched off by a policemen's strike for higher
pay. There were reliable reports the strike had been settled,
but the police were not seen on the streets yesterday.
Battle Rages In Ethiopia
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Some 6000 secessionist
guerrillas ringed the Eritrean capital of Asmara yesterday,
choking off its 200,000 residents from much-needed food,
water and fuel, diplomatic sources said.
Fears of a typhoid epidemic also were expressed by 300
Italian women and children airlifted out of Asmara.
Diplomatic sources said the Ethiopian government had
turned down an offer by the International Red Cross to aid
victims of the week-old fighting in northernmost Eritrea
province, but did not say why. They said the offer was in
response to pleas by several foreign embassies

Jackson Declares Candidacy
