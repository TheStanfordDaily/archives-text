# Feminist Author Sets Goals
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The feminist movement must
liberate all of society by changing "the
classifications and divisions [by which
women] are used," Portuguese author
Maria Isabel Barreno told an audience
in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Barreno was arrested by the
Portuguese government in 1972, a
month after the publication of a
feminist book she co-authored. The
Three Marias: New Portuguese Letters.
The book was banned in Portugal as
obscene and "an abuse of the freedom
of the press." But the trial of its three
authors was interrupted by the May
1974, coup which toppled strongman
Marcello Caetano.
The book could have been banned
as political subversion instead of
obscenity, Barreno said, "but in those

days to have a book banned for
political subversion was a mark of
prestige." She said it was typical of the
male-dominated state to deny women
even this privilege.
She added that books about sex
"more crude and more realistic than
our book" were selling in Portugal at
the time, "but they were written by
men."
The Three Marias is a collection of
stories, essays, letters and poems
written by Maria Teresa Horta, Maria
Velho da Costa, and Barreno. Barreno
described the authors as "three
women, three writers, three friends"
who wanted to communicate about
the oppression of women, especially in
Portuguese society.
Depressing
She said that the first few months
of her trial were depressing, because
she and her friends feared that the
"fascist" Portuguese government had
kept news of their plight from the
outside world. If they had not
communicated with other "oppressed"
people, "our struggle was completely
meaningless," she said.
But when the three began hearing
from women in other countries who
had read the book and sympathized
with them, "it was really not so
important whether we went to prison
or not," she said. If a struggle has a
point, it is worth fighting for, she
explained.
Barreno said restrictions on women
are restrictions on all of society.
Categories imposed by society keep
people powerless, she said.
'Men Oppressed'
"Of course, men are also oppressed by
all these values," she said. She
speculated that men resist the feminist
movement mainly because they are
afraid of losing the "good image"
which traditional sex roles have given
them.
But she added that she would not
like to be forced "to always be the
strong one, who never loses and never
fails."
Barreno objected to state control of
abortion and contraception, which she
labeled "forced labor." Denying
women contraception is not a moral
issue, she said, but a way to force

women to produce children for
society.
Mothers Care
When women then have children,
they are told that mothers shouid stay
out of the political and economic
world, Barreno said. But mothers have
much to say about society and
politics, she maintained.
Barreno said she worries about her
two sons because of the political
turmoil in the world. "When these
children are adults, they are no longer
my problem. They are something that
can be used by the government" for
wars in which women and mothers had
no say, she objected.
Barreno's talk was co-sponsored by
the International Association, Bechtel
International Center, the Center for
Research on Women and the ASSU.

women to produce children for
society.
Mothers Care
When women then have children,
they are told that mothers shouid stay
out of the political and economic
world, Barreno said. But mothers have
much to say about society and
politics, she maintained.
Barreno said she worries about her
two sons because of the political
turmoil in the world. "When these
children are adults, they are no longer
my problem. They are something that
can be used by the government" for
wars in which women and mothers had
no say, she objected.

Research on Women and the ASSU.

THE THREE MARIAS—Maria Isabel Barreno, Portuguese author, told her
audience in Cubberley Auditorium last night that the feminist movement has
started to change all of society. People must break out of limiting categories
before they can close the gap between people and government, she said.
The feminist movement must
liberate all of society by changing "the
classifications and divisions [by which
women] are used," Portuguese author
Maria Isabel Barreno told an audience
in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Barreno was arrested by the
Portuguese government in 1972, a
month after the publication of a
feminist book she co-authored. The
Three Marias: New Portuguese Letters.
The book was banned in Portugal as
obscene and "an abuse of the freedom
of the press." But the trial of its three
authors was interrupted by the May
1974, coup which toppled strongman
Marcello Caetano.
The book could have been banned
as political subversion instead of
obscenity, Barreno said, "but in those

days to have a book banned for
political subversion was a mark of
prestige." She said it was typical of the
male-dominated state to deny women
even this privilege.
She added that books about sex
"more crude and more realistic than
our book" were selling in Portugal at
the time, "but they were written by
men."
The Three Marias is a collection of
stories, essays, letters and poems
written by Maria Teresa Horta, Maria
Velho da Costa, and Barreno. Barreno
described the authors as "three
women, three writers, three friends"
who wanted to communicate about
the oppression of women, especially in
Portuguese society.
Depressing
She said that the first few months
of her trial were depressing, because
she and her friends feared that the
"fascist" Portuguese government had
kept news of their plight from the
outside world. If they had not
communicated with other "oppressed"
people, "our struggle was completely
meaningless," she said.
But when the three began hearing
from women in other countries who
had read the book and sympathized
with them, "it was really not so
important whether we went to prison
or not," she said. If a struggle has a
point, it is worth fighting for, she
explained.
Barreno said restrictions on women
are restrictions on all of society.
Categories imposed by society keep
people powerless, she said.
'Men Oppressed'
"Of course, men are also oppressed by
all these values," she said. She
speculated that men resist the feminist
movement mainly because they are
afraid of losing the "good image"
which traditional sex roles have given
them.
But she added that she would not
like to be forced "to always be the
strong one, who never loses and never
fails."
Barreno objected to state control of
abortion and contraception, which she
labeled "forced labor." Denying
women contraception is not a moral
issue, she said, but a way to force

women to produce children for
society.
