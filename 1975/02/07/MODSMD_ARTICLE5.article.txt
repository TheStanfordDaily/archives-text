# COSS Submits Report, Urges Limits On Frats
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Implementing most suggestions of
the housing subcommittee draft
proposal released last month, the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) submitted a finalized report
on a new residence system to President
Richard Lyman yesterday.
Under the proposal, all entering
freshmen will be guaranteed
on-campus housing for their first year
and two specific subsequent years. The
probability of being forced off-campus
during their remaining undergraduate
year, however, will be very high.
Also, all autumn-quarter transfers
will be guaranteed on-campus housing
for their first year here.
The plan calls for retention of the
draw and fraternity systems. However,
in order to "provide equity to all
students," the report recommends that
fraternities no longer be able to offer
members guaranteed on-campus
housing for four years.
COSS Wednesday unanimously

approved the report compiled by the
housing subcommittee.
Opposes Subjectivity
The report outlines the
subcommittee's opposition to
subjective selectivity, the practice of
allowing a house to choose its
members.
"We do not recommend extension
of subjective selectivity to any other
present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the
University should seek to foster," the
report states.
CQSS Chairperson Suzi Harmatz
remarked that subjective selectivity
was the "thorniest, hardest, most
emotionally involved issue" discussed
in the subcommittee's meetings.
Harmatz said the subcommittee
decided it could not support a policy
which allows "a person to say I don't
like you and 1 don't have to tell you
why I don't like you. Period."
Compliments Lyons
In its statement, the subcommittee
complimented Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, who announced
Wednesday he would rather do away
with subjective selectivity all together
rather than see it extended.
The report states the
subcommittee, "if contested on its
recommendation to retain subjective
selectivity for fraternities, would vote
to remove this feature entirely from
the housing system rather than extend
it to any living groups other than the
pr e s en 11 y-e s t a b 1 is h ed male
fraternities."
Harmatz said the subcommittee
decided to allow fraternities to retain
their present subjective selectivity
rights because of the "historic
perspective" of the organizations.
Sororities Ignored
She said the issue of sororities was
not considered because there are no
sororities in the present system.
"We didn't deal with that. We
reviewed the system as it is now," she

remarked.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton commented
on details of the report, but explained
that another group would decide
exactly how to implement the
recommendations if Lyman accepts
the proposal.
Students Choose
Horton explained that during their
freshman year, students will choose
which year they will probably spend
off campus. He said he assumes most
students will choose either junior or
senior year off-campus.
The system will be flexible enough,
Horton ascertained, that students will
be able to change their choice from
junior to senior year, or vice versa, up
until spring of their sophomore year.
Horton said it has not been decided
how priority would be allocated if a
majority of students choose one
particular year to live off-campus.
"But we would have to have a fair
system," he remarked.
More Members
Under terms in the report, each
fraternity will have to accept more
members than it has space to house.
"Each fraternity would be required
to fill a quota. . . which would
represent its proportionate share of
the demand for on-campus housing,"
the report states.
The fraternities will have to
accommodate the extra students either
by establishing off-campus annexes or
by crowding their houses. The
subcommittee opposes the latter
solution, however.
Horton said it has not been decided
whether crowding will be allowed.
If a fraternity consistently is
incapable of meeting its quota, the
report continues, the fraternity will be
assimilated into the draw system.
Neither Horton nor Harmatz would
define "consistently," saying the
actual amount of time had not been
decided.

members than it has space to house.
"Each fraternity would be required
to fill a quota. . . which would
represent its proportionate share of
the demand for on-campus housing,"
the report states.
The fraternities will have to
accommodate the extra students either
by establishing off-campus annexes or
by crowding their houses. The
subcommittee opposes the latter
solution, however.
Horton said it has not been decided
whether crowding will be allowed.
If a fraternity consistently is
incapable of meeting its quota, the
report continues, the fraternity will be
assimilated into the draw system.
Neither Horton nor Harmatz would
define "consistently," saying the
actual amount of time had not been
decided.
Implementing most suggestions of
the housing subcommittee draft
proposal released last month, the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) submitted a finalized report
on a new residence system to President
Richard Lyman yesterday.
Under the proposal, all entering
freshmen will be guaranteed
on-campus housing for their first year
and two specific subsequent years. The
probability of being forced off-campus
during their remaining undergraduate
year, however, will be very high.
Also, all autumn-quarter transfers
will be guaranteed on-campus housing
for their first year here.
The plan calls for retention of the
draw and fraternity systems. However,
in order to "provide equity to all
students," the report recommends that
fraternities no longer be able to offer
members guaranteed on-campus
housing for four years.
COSS Wednesday unanimously

approved the report compiled by the
housing subcommittee.
Opposes Subjectivity
The report outlines the
subcommittee's opposition to
subjective selectivity, the practice of
allowing a house to choose its
members.
"We do not recommend extension
of subjective selectivity to any other
present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the
University should seek to foster," the
report states.
CQSS Chairperson Suzi Harmatz
remarked that subjective selectivity
was the "thorniest, hardest, most
emotionally involved issue" discussed
in the subcommittee's meetings.
Harmatz said the subcommittee
decided it could not support a policy
which allows "a person to say I don't
like you and 1 don't have to tell you
why I don't like you. Period."
Compliments Lyons
In its statement, the subcommittee
complimented Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, who announced
Wednesday he would rather do away
with subjective selectivity all together
rather than see it extended.
The report states the
subcommittee, "if contested on its
recommendation to retain subjective
selectivity for fraternities, would vote
to remove this feature entirely from
the housing system rather than extend
it to any living groups other than the
pr e s en 11 y-e s t a b 1 is h ed male
fraternities."
Harmatz said the subcommittee
decided to allow fraternities to retain
their present subjective selectivity
rights because of the "historic
perspective" of the organizations.
Sororities Ignored
She said the issue of sororities was
not considered because there are no
sororities in the present system.
"We didn't deal with that. We
reviewed the system as it is now," she

remarked.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton commented
on details of the report, but explained
that another group would decide
exactly how to implement the
recommendations if Lyman accepts
the proposal.
Students Choose
Horton explained that during their
freshman year, students will choose
which year they will probably spend
off campus. He said he assumes most
students will choose either junior or
senior year off-campus.
The system will be flexible enough,
Horton ascertained, that students will
be able to change their choice from
junior to senior year, or vice versa, up
until spring of their sophomore year.
Horton said it has not been decided
how priority would be allocated if a
majority of students choose one
particular year to live off-campus.
"But we would have to have a fair
system," he remarked.
More Members
Under terms in the report, each
fraternity will have to accept more
members than it has space to house.

the report states.
