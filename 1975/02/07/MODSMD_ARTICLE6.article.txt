# Silent Protest In Class
## ARC Assails Iran Contract 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
Some 10 members of the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) sat through Communication 190 yesterday, holding
signs in "silent protest" of a proposed contract between the
University and National Iranian Radio and Television
(NIRT).
Under the contract, which has not yet been signed, the
Electrical Engineering and Communication departments
would design Iran's planned domestic communications
satellite.
At the beginning of the class "International
Communication", undergraduate Chris Gray read a
three-minute statement of ARC's objections to the plan,
saying "it will be used to tighten the already terrible hold
the secret police have on the Iranian people." ARC also
charged that the contract does not involve research, but is
"a straight-forward production contract."
Everett Rogers, a visiting professor at the Institute for
Communication Research (ICR), approved the reading of
ARC's statement and the holding of signs during the
videotaped class.
Communication 190 is being taped by the Stanford
Instructional Television Network this quarter. Ken Down,
director of the network, said he was originally told that the
tapes would be sent to Iran.
Not Connected
But Down said he was told this quarter by Heather
Hudson, a research associate under Parker, that the tapes
are no longer connected with the NIRT contract. His
records show that the Agency for International
Development (AID) is paying for the taping. Rogers said no

decision had been made on whether to send the tapes to
Iran.
Hudson claimed that the NIRT contract is being handled
mostly through Electrical Engineering. ICR will ''contribute
an analysis of what the country needs in terms of
communication" and a cost-effectiveness analysis of the
development of educational programming for Iran, she said.
Oscar Gandy, a member of ICR, said at a press
conference after the class that the ICR Research Committee
had recommended that Parker not accept the contract with
NIRT. He read a statement from concerned members of
ICR, saying, "After careful review of this contract, the
project described emerges as little more than technical
assistance and transfer inextricably tied to the expansionist
marketing goals of U.S. imperialism."
Iranian Position
ARC member Dianne Doggett read a position statement
which she said represented 40 of 60 Iranian students at the
University. "Due to the political repression in Iran and its
extension abroad, we are unable to present this resolution
ourselves and thank all those willing to act on our behalf,"
the statement began.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce Lusignan and his EE
235 class will design the satellite system. Gray said that
ARC plans to visit Lusignan's class today.
ARC members also will circulate a petition among
faculty and perhaps students, he said, and will take a
newsletter on Iran around to dorms. ARC will sponsor a
teach-in about Iran within the next few weeks, Gray added.
