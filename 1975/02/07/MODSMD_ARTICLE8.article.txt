The decision of the University's Appointments and Promotion
Committee to deny tenure to Religious Studies Asst. Prof. Jerry Irish
has raised something of a furor in the community.
Many scholars and students believe Irish is an unusually
outstanding teacher who deserves tenure. We do not feel in any way
qualified to comment on the Irish case. We do, however, agree with
many of the critics of the Irish decision that teaching is often not
sufficiently taken into account by the A & P Committee.
We realize that the University must impose difficult standards on
its candidates for tenure, particularly now that financial woes crimp
its ability to pay for tenured faculty. We also understand that
Stanford as an institution is devoted to research as well as education.
What we object to is the A & P Committee's desire to promote
only the well-rounded person, the professor who "can do both
|teaching and research! very well," in the words of Lewis Spitz,
associate dean of Humanities and Sciences.
We feel too much of a smorgasbord approach is taken. An assistant
professor should not have to spend six years at the University
compiling brownie points in teaching, research, and to a lesser extent,
"University service."
Rather, the young teacher should work at improving the state of
knowledge, utilizing whatever talents he possesses.
We do not object to granting tenure to a truly outstanding
researcher, one whose life's work shows promise of significantly
bettering the world, whether or not he can speak three words students
can understand.
But we also think that the outstanding teacher should be rewarded
with tenure, so that generations of students can benefit from his or her
ability to communicate knowledge and transmit intellectual curiosity.
We emphasize that the outstanding teacher does more than merely
recite facts. The statements by Prof. Lewis Spitz that students here
should not expect teachers to devote all their time to them, because
"Stanford is only for those strong-minded and independent students,"
ignores this principle.
It seems to us that the professor should do more for the student
than give lucid lectures and assign excellent reading lists. Perhaps if the
tenure process became more than merely a weighing of items in a file
more professors here would have time to spend with students.
