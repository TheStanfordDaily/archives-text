# Safety: Not A Luxury Item
## 
### 
The problem of safety at
Stanford will not go away simply
because people pretend it does
not exist.
The Administration has a
responsibility to see that its basic
educational functions can proceed
in a suitable environment.
Students afraid to go to the
libraries or laboratories at night
cannot get the full value of the
education they are paying for.
We feel the Administration is
shirking this responsibility:
— When discussing the
possibility of a Stanford
supported, nighttime mini-bus, an
Administration spokesman
revealed that a similar proposal
last fall had been rejected on the
grounds that a trial run might
prove successful. A successful trial
period, of course, would have
meant continued funding required
of Stanford; apparently, the
Administration simply did not
want to know whether or not a
real need could be demonstrated.
—At a recent meeting
concerning safety at Stanford, a
recurrent suggestion was for
improved lighting at night,
particularly for bicycle riders.
Dale Snape, assistant dean of
student affairs, said that students
might have to accept a trade-off:
increased lighting on Serra St. —
but every other light bulb removed
along Palm Drive.

—In a Daily series on
self-defense for women, Stanford
Police Officer Debbie Whittemore
is quoted saying, "Every sex crime
that has occurred on campus this
year has been a result of the
victim's stupidity."
In each of these cases, the
attitude expressed is shocking.
Either the issue is ignored, or the
victim of a crime is made to feel
personally responsible, even
personally guilty.
Most discussions of safety —
ranging from dorm special
programs to self-defense courses —

focus on what the individual,
particularly the individual woman,
can do. While not denying the
importance of personal safety
precautions, we believe it is
imperative that the
Administration respond to what is
a public problem and an urgent
need.
The Stanford Administration
must recognize that student
safety is not a luxury item.
