112 A Personal Message To \
Sex-Conscious College Women.
Thank heaven that the old sexual
taboos are being lifted! Today
we're men's equals in bed as well
as in business and in school.
We're no longer faced with the
fate of our older sisters who sat
isfied their men, without knowing
fulfillment themselves. Today we
have a right to know what really
makes us feel good. We're free to
explore our bodies... experiment
with sex...discover what turns us
on the most! And that's where
Prelude 2 comes in. This revolu
tionary new product is called "the
sensual awakener" because it ac
tually "awakens" your sexual
responses. Since each of us are
sexually unique, Prelude 2 helps
us get the lowdown on our own
personal needs and desires. It
provides valuable "lessons" for
today—and the future. The com
plete "Sensual Awakener" set
contains Prelude 2, based on the
principal of a vibrator (noiseless,
clinically tested, hygenically safe)
and 4 massage attachments, plus
The Special Stimulator which
many doctors recommend for at
taining and enriching orgasms.
(There is nothing to insert, or
harm delicate tissues.) The il
lustrated guidebook shows you,
step-by-step, how Prelude 2 can
increase your growing, healthy
"joy of sex". Your complete satis
faction guaranteed or your money
back. Mailed in plain wrapper.

112 A Personal Message To \
Sex-Conscious College Women.
Thank heaven that the old sexual
taboos are being lifted! Today
we're men's equals in bed as well
as in business and in school.
We're no longer faced with the
fate of our older sisters who sat
isfied their men, without knowing
fulfillment themselves. Today we
have a right to know what really
makes us feel good. We're free to
explore our bodies... experiment
with sex...discover what turns us
on the most! And that's where
Prelude 2 comes in. This revolu
tionary new product is called "the
sensual awakener" because it ac
tually "awakens" your sexual
responses. Since each of us are
sexually unique, Prelude 2 helps
us get the lowdown on our own
personal needs and desires. It
provides valuable "lessons" for
today—and the future. The com
plete "Sensual Awakener" set
contains Prelude 2, based on the
principal of a vibrator (noiseless,
clinically tested, hygenically safe)
and 4 massage attachments, plus
The Special Stimulator which
many doctors recommend for at
taining and enriching orgasms.
(There is nothing to insert, or
harm delicate tissues.) The il
lustrated guidebook shows you,
step-by-step, how Prelude 2 can
increase your growing, healthy
"joy of sex". Your complete satis
faction guaranteed or your money
back. Mailed in plain wrapper.
