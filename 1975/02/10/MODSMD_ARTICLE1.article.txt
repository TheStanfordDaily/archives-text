# Judge Nixes Plea To Halt Ticketing
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
The ASSU's request for a
preliminary injunction which would
have prevented campus police from
ticketing student vehicles without
parking stickers was denied Friday by
Judge Paul T. Gallagher of the North
Santa Clara County Superior Court.
In a brief statement, Gallagher said,
"The plaintiffs' case and the rule of
relief is not clear and to this court
appears doubtful."
Escondido Village Council
President Cathy Colson, one of the
plaintiffs in a suit challenging the
University's right to require parking
stickers, said that case will still be
pursued in court. "We're trying to get
it into court as soon as possible," she
noted.
She added that another student was
filing a separate suit against the
University, protesting the $7.50
parking fee. A court date of Feb. 24
has been set for hearing of that case.
'Pecuniary' Reasons
Colson's suit alleges that the
University is using the fee for its own
"pecuniary" reasons, claiming the fee
is comparable to a tax which goes into
the University's general fund for
various expenditures rather than for
street maintenance and police and fire
protection.
The suit further holds the fee as
unfair faculty and staff are
not charged for the same parking
stickers, and calls the fee an improper
delegation of legislative power to a
private university.
The plaintiffs are asking that the
fee be declared invalid and
unconstitutional.
FreeÂ»Parking
David Heilbron, attorney for the
University, said the case is really
concerned with "the right to park
your car on somebody else's property
for free for a year."
Colson said students who wish to
challenge their parking citations may
still bring the tickets to the ASSU
office or to her apartment, Escondido
62C.
Reasons To Resist
Colson noted reasons for contesting
the $7.50 stickers.
"What I'm worried about is next
year," she said. "They (the
University | plan to have a new parking
policy by fall quarter. The latest
parking study will have been finished
by then. But every parking study in
the past has recommended an increase
in the parking fee."
