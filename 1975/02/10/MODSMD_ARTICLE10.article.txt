# Parents Seek Theme House
## Suson Swaringen 
### 
I would like to clarify a portion of the Feb. 5
Daily article on child care needs. The article
reported that a proposal for a theme house for
single parents was submitted to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton, that Dean Horton
said he would need more data, and that the matter
ended there. No proposal was in fact submitted, the
need for data is still apparent and unmet, and the
matter of single parents did not end there.
As a member of the Dean of Student Affairs
staff, I attended a meeting in May 1973 of the
Stanford Single Parents to which Larry Horton had
been invited to discuss housing options for single
parents. Stanford Single Parents had been formed a
month earlier, with the support of the Dean of
Student Affairs office and the Stanford YWCA, to
understand both the needs and the alternatives
available to single parents who were also students.
From its early meetings it was clear that two of the
most unrelenting needs of single parents were for
appropriate housing and child care.
A number of questions were raised at this May
1973 meeting, including whether it was possible to
apply for the establishment of a theme house for
single parents. Yes, it was possible, the Dean
replied, but the chances for a successful application
were slim indeed, given the intense and competing
demands for student housing, without a careful
documentation of demand.
Horton was receptive to the idea and his
response, while it may have seemed harsh to some,
was, in my judgment, realistic and constructive.

Steps were taken to meet some of those needs
which were understood and which could be met.
Student aid budgets have been standardized to
include dependents of single students, student
family housing regulations now affirm the
applicant's student rather than marital status and
allow single parents to live with or near each other,
evening and sick child care programs have been
studied, counseling and community outreach
programs have been established.
Students who are single parents, especially those
who have custody of their children, have special
needs which set them apart from students who do
not have children — for child care, for housing, for
commercial credit and student loans, for recreation,
for flexible academic programs and employment.
Their numbers are likely to increase, likely to
include more men who have custody of their minor
children, and more people beyond their twenties.
A system needs to be established which would
yield reliable and continuingdata on the numbers of
single parent students. Such a system would
probably expand on the usual single-married
designation by allowing the single parent to
identify himseif on the Permit To Register. Other
systems are possible, and discussions continue on
their feasibility. Without the data, response to an
increasingly distinct portion of the student body is
likely to be fragmented and to be seen as
inadequate.

Steps were taken to meet some of those needs
which were understood and which could be met.
Student aid budgets have been standardized to
include dependents of single students, student
family housing regulations now affirm the
applicant's student rather than marital status and
allow single parents to live with or near each other,
evening and sick child care programs have been
studied, counseling and community outreach
programs have been established.
Students who are single parents, especially those
who have custody of their children, have special
needs which set them apart from students who do
not have children — for child care, for housing, for
commercial credit and student loans, for recreation,
for flexible academic programs and employment.
Their numbers are likely to increase, likely to
include more men who have custody of their minor
children, and more people beyond their twenties.
A system needs to be established which would
yield reliable and continuingdata on the numbers of
single parent students. Such a system would
probably expand on the usual single-married
designation by allowing the single parent to
identify himseif on the Permit To Register. Other
systems are possible, and discussions continue on
their feasibility. Without the data, response to an
increasingly distinct portion of the student body is
likely to be fragmented and to be seen as
inadequate.

I would like to clarify a portion of the Feb. 5
Daily article on child care needs. The article
reported that a proposal for a theme house for
single parents was submitted to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton, that Dean Horton
said he would need more data, and that the matter
ended there. No proposal was in fact submitted, the
need for data is still apparent and unmet, and the
matter of single parents did not end there.
As a member of the Dean of Student Affairs
staff, I attended a meeting in May 1973 of the
Stanford Single Parents to which Larry Horton had
been invited to discuss housing options for single
parents. Stanford Single Parents had been formed a
month earlier, with the support of the Dean of
Student Affairs office and the Stanford YWCA, to
understand both the needs and the alternatives
available to single parents who were also students.
From its early meetings it was clear that two of the
most unrelenting needs of single parents were for
appropriate housing and child care.
A number of questions were raised at this May
1973 meeting, including whether it was possible to
apply for the establishment of a theme house for
single parents. Yes, it was possible, the Dean
replied, but the chances for a successful application
were slim indeed, given the intense and competing
demands for student housing, without a careful
documentation of demand.
Horton was receptive to the idea and his
response, while it may have seemed harsh to some,
was, in my judgment, realistic and constructive.
