# What I Overheard At Denny's
## 
### 
I have a very bad habit. Often, when I'm
depressed or concerned about something, I
eat. Late at night. In coffee shops.
Now anyone who's seen me might think
I'm a very depressed or concerned person.
This is not fully true. Only partially. But it's
a fact that my reaction to stress is not
unique. (Nor of course is it universal. Take
my colleague Jim Wascher. His reaction must
be to not eat. Either that, or he leads a
remarkably stress-free existence.)
Anyway, late Saturday night, I began to
get concerned about a Monday midterm for
which I hadn't studied. Rather than start
studying — that would have been the easy
way out — I went out to Denny's for a bite
to eat.
I was deep into a bowl of chili when I
became aware of the two men at the other
end of the counter. The one facing me was
short and fat, with curly hair and horned-rim
glasses. The one with his back to me was kind
of bald, and looked like he might have played
football about 40 years ago. They were both
looking at menus, trying to decide what to
order. I couldn't help but overhear their
deliberations.
Carping At President
"Veil, Cherald, tomorrow I am off to the
Middle East," Horn-rims was saying to Baldy.
"I think, to celebrate, I vill haff a
Dennyburger mit cheese."
"Gosh, Hank, you're so lucky to be
leaving for a while. I have to stay here and
listen to everyone carping at me. Hey, the
Denny's Fisherman's Platter looks pretty

good."
"Me, lucky? Hah! Vhile you get to stay
here and go swimming, I vill be arguing mit
those Arabs. Hmm — I wonder what kind of
oil they use on their french fries."
"But gee, Hank, at least people admire
you. I have to listen to people complaining
all the time, saying things like how indecisive
I am. You know, I think I'll have a salad with
thousand island — no, roquefort — no, Italian
dressing. Or maybe just plain."
"Ah, but Cherald, I haff to put up with
people like that Scoop Jackson. He thinks
he's secretary of state. Hmmm, a scoop of ice
cream might be nice ..."

"Ah, but all you have to worry about is
politics. / have to worry about peace. Perhaps
a piece of pie to go underneath the ice
cream?"
Inconsistencies
"But golly, just listen to what people say
about me. Can you imagine, they say I keep
reversing myself, just because one week I was
for a tax increase and the next week I was for
a tax rebate. Say, maybe I will have that
Dennyburger..
"Yes, but vhat about those people who
keep bringing up my Vietnam agreement?
How vas I to know that two years later they
would still be fighting and killing and burning
crops? That reminds me, Nancy said to try
the fried rice."
"But golly whilikers, my problems haven't
even come up yet. I mean, just wait until
someone realizes my tax rebate plan is
George's $1000-a-person idea under a different
name. They'll laugh me out of town. Gosh,
will I be in the soup then. Speaking of which,
I wonder how the split pea is ..."
Well, at that I had had enough. I took my
check for a bowl of chili, a salad and a Coke
to the cash register. I mean, I wasn't feeling
so hot when I came in, and I had to sit there
listening to a full catalogue of every ill
plaguing the nation!
Well, every ill but one. The man at the
register rang up my bill. 'That'll be $8.95,"
he said.

"Secretary of State? He thinks he's already
president. And according to the polls, in
about two more years he might be right. I
think I might have two scoops."
