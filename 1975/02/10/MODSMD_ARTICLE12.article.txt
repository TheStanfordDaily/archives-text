## Exhibit Not Sexist 
### 
Editor:
Anna Bresnick's letter (Daily,
Feb. 6) protesting the Art
Gallery's exhibit of nude art
makes evident her total lack of
understanding of the relationship
between the artist, his work and
his public. The fine arts today are
fundamentally concerned with the
necessity for the artist to honestly
express his own reality of
experience. That reality can be
sexist, racist, cubist, obscene or
insane. To insist that an artist be
tied down to "today's
consciousness" (whose?) is to
deny the basic freedom which is
so vital to him.
A work of art solicits a
response, however, whether it is
positive or negative, and
Bresnick's feminist outrage has
value for the exhibiting artists as
another aspect of the world they
must consider in their art. But the
repressive taboos and absurd
tokenism that she preaches can
have no place in the world of art
unless Bresnick or a feminist
artists expresses such ideas in
work of her own. Art would cease
to exist if its creator had to

modify his work to suit the views
of others.

Drew Reeling's column (Daily,
Feb. 6) contending that nuclear
risk is a "narrow" environmental
issue and that the 1976 Nuclear
Initiative perpetuates "an elitist
goal contrary to the public's well
being" is the least intelligent
remark I've encountered in four
years of reading the Daily.
The risks posed by nuclear
power are anything but narrow. In
the short run, the possibility of a
nuclear plant accident, or an
accident in transport of nuclear
materials as a weapon of sabotage,
jeopardize the lives of millions of
people. In the long run, the
mutation-causing properties of
nuclear wastes pose a deadly
threat to humanity's survival.
Before Reeling's criticism of
the environmental movement is to
be taken seriously, he will first
have to develop an understanding
of basic environmental issues.

Concerning Steve Hefter's
article about pre-med engineering
students (Daily, Feb. 4) we would
like to, perhaps, prevent a few
misconceptions. While our course
of study may be rigorous, it is
really not all as bad as most
people seem to believe.
One of the goals of the
Stanford Association of
Engineering Pre-meds is to make
known the possibility of this
curriculum to those who might be
interested. We would therefore
like to encourage anyone
interested in undertaking this
course of study to contact either

Women Can Play Soccer
Editor:
As Daily readers know, there
has been much discussion about
the ability and purpose of the
Women's Center intramural soccer
team. Many people ridicule their
efforts and challenge their ability.
Or they ask what women are

doing in such a rough sport. The
women claim that they like the
sport and compete because it is
the only way they can play soccer
at Stanford. They acknowledge a
lack of experience but claim they
can compete the same way that
the men's teams do.
Though I believed in their
determination, I was
skeptical of their ability — until
my team played them. I came
determined to play just as I
always had (i.e. rough and
aggressively) and was expecting a
ridiculous score. We played our
best and did win, but not by an
unusual score.
That the women did that well
is to their credit. Four of nine of
our players had played varsity
high school soccer. The women
were first year soccer players. As a
result of their practices, I would
say that their skills were better
than most first-year players and
their determination was second to
none. In sum, the only difference
between the women's team and
any other was that they did not
begin their season with a few
experienced players.
They have the athletes and in
the future they will have the
experience. They may well
become a team to beat.

A Crisis For All
Editor:
Robert Tucker, professor of
international relations at Johns
Hopkins, has been misunderstood.
His article in Commentary and his
conversation with William F.
Buckley on Firing Line make it
clear that he is not calling for
immediate, or even long-range
military intervention by the U.S.
in the Middle East.
He is saying that in a situation
where the Arabs (whose price
gouge is already costing thousands
of lives in undeveloped countries)
are, with Russian support, already
aggressing against the West, we
cannot afford to shirk serious
consideration of some limited
military options involving risks of
the sort we have faced in the
recent past and that the Russians
have also faced and are still facing.
The fact that it is economic
aggression should not confuse us:
for example, if some small
country controlled our water
supply and suddenly cut it off. ..
The development of alternative
sources of energy will take a
dangerous amount of time (aside
from the still-controversial and
risky business of nuclear energy).

The defense of Israel is a
secondary matter in the minds of
most of us, but it is inevitably tied
in with the whole picture of
American dignity and the survival
of the Judeo-Christian ideal of
freedom and high culture which
some of us still want to encourage
in the world at large.
So the age-old reservoir of
anti-Semitism will undoubtedly be
opened up in this new dilemma, as
James Reston and I.F. Stone see
it. But since the traditional
anti-Semites are nationalists, the
situation is complex; in any event
we can't afford to be immobilized
by this one dubious consideration.
If President Ford and Secretary
of State Kissinger, who are not
fanatic, felt the risks of at least a
warning was worth taking I'll go
along with them rather than Stone
who has a vested interest in
sniping at American leadership.
As for the long list of scientists
who in the San Francisco
Chronicle of Feb. 3 say that the
West is "held hostage by a price
structure it is powerless to
influence," well, this crisis is a
concern for the whole man, not
only the manipulators of matter,
however talented.

Anna Bresnick's letter (Daily,
Feb. 6) protesting the Art
Gallery's exhibit of nude art
makes evident her total lack of
understanding of the relationship
between the artist, his work and
his public. The fine arts today are
fundamentally concerned with the
necessity for the artist to honestly
express his own reality of
experience. That reality can be
sexist, racist, cubist, obscene or
insane. To insist that an artist be
tied down to "today's
consciousness" (whose?) is to
deny the basic freedom which is
so vital to him.
A work of art solicits a
response, however, whether it is
positive or negative, and
Bresnick's feminist outrage has
value for the exhibiting artists as
another aspect of the world they
must consider in their art. But the
repressive taboos and absurd
tokenism that she preaches can
have no place in the world of art
unless Bresnick or a feminist
artists expresses such ideas in
work of her own. Art would cease
to exist if its creator had to

modify his work to suit the views

Drew Reeling's column (Daily,
Feb. 6) contending that nuclear
risk is a "narrow" environmental
issue and that the 1976 Nuclear
Initiative perpetuates "an elitist
goal contrary to the public's well
being" is the least intelligent
remark I've encountered in four
years of reading the Daily.
The risks posed by nuclear
power are anything but narrow. In
the short run, the possibility of a
nuclear plant accident, or an
accident in transport of nuclear
materials as a weapon of sabotage,
jeopardize the lives of millions of
people. In the long run, the
mutation-causing properties of
nuclear wastes pose a deadly
threat to humanity's survival.
Before Reeling's criticism of
the environmental movement is to
be taken seriously, he will first
have to develop an understanding
of basic environmental issues.

Women Can Play Soccer
Editor:
As Daily readers know, there
has been much discussion about
the ability and purpose of the
Women's Center intramural soccer
team. Many people ridicule their
efforts and challenge their ability.
Or they ask what women are

doing in such a rough sport. The
women claim that they like the
sport and compete because it is
the only way they can play soccer
at Stanford. They acknowledge a
lack of experience but claim they
can compete the same way that
the men's teams do.
Though I believed in their
determination, I was
skeptical of their ability — until
my team played them. I came
determined to play just as I
always had (i.e. rough and
aggressively) and was expecting a
ridiculous score. We played our
best and did win, but not by an
unusual score.
That the women did that well
is to their credit. Four of nine of
our players had played varsity
high school soccer. The women
were first year soccer players. As a
result of their practices, I would
say that their skills were better
than most first-year players and
their determination was second to
none. In sum, the only difference
between the women's team and
any other was that they did not
begin their season with a few
experienced players.
They have the athletes and in
the future they will have the
experience. They may well
become a team to beat.

A Crisis For All
Editor:
Robert Tucker, professor of
international relations at Johns
Hopkins, has been misunderstood.
His article in Commentary and his
conversation with William F.
Buckley on Firing Line make it
clear that he is not calling for
immediate, or even long-range
military intervention by the U.S.
in the Middle East.
He is saying that in a situation
where the Arabs (whose price
gouge is already costing thousands
of lives in undeveloped countries)
are, with Russian support, already
aggressing against the West, we
cannot afford to shirk serious
consideration of some limited
military options involving risks of
the sort we have faced in the
recent past and that the Russians
have also faced and are still facing.
The fact that it is economic
aggression should not confuse us:
for example, if some small
country controlled our water
supply and suddenly cut it off. ..
The development of alternative
sources of energy will take a
dangerous amount of time (aside
from the still-controversial and
risky business of nuclear energy).

The defense of Israel is a
secondary matter in the minds of
most of us, but it is inevitably tied
in with the whole picture of
American dignity and the survival
of the Judeo-Christian ideal of
freedom and high culture which
some of us still want to encourage
in the world at large.
So the age-old reservoir of
anti-Semitism will undoubtedly be
opened up in this new dilemma, as
James Reston and I.F. Stone see
it. But since the traditional
anti-Semites are nationalists, the
situation is complex; in any event
we can't afford to be immobilized
by this one dubious consideration.
If President Ford and Secretary
of State Kissinger, who are not
fanatic, felt the risks of at least a
warning was worth taking I'll go
along with them rather than Stone
who has a vested interest in
sniping at American leadership.
As for the long list of scientists

Anna Bresnick's letter (Daily,
Feb. 6) protesting the Art
Gallery's exhibit of nude art
makes evident her total lack of
understanding of the relationship
between the artist, his work and
his public. The fine arts today are
fundamentally concerned with the
necessity for the artist to honestly
express his own reality of
experience. That reality can be
sexist, racist, cubist, obscene or
insane. To insist that an artist be
tied down to "today's
consciousness" (whose?) is to
deny the basic freedom which is
so vital to him.
A work of art solicits a
response, however, whether it is
positive or negative, and
Bresnick's feminist outrage has
value for the exhibiting artists as
another aspect of the world they
must consider in their art. But the
repressive taboos and absurd
tokenism that she preaches can
have no place in the world of art
unless Bresnick or a feminist
artists expresses such ideas in
work of her own. Art would cease
to exist if its creator had to

modify his work to suit the views
of others.

Drew Reeling's column (Daily,
Feb. 6) contending that nuclear
risk is a "narrow" environmental
issue and that the 1976 Nuclear
Initiative perpetuates "an elitist
goal contrary to the public's well
being" is the least intelligent
remark I've encountered in four
years of reading the Daily.
The risks posed by nuclear
power are anything but narrow. In
the short run, the possibility of a
nuclear plant accident, or an
accident in transport of nuclear
materials as a weapon of sabotage,
jeopardize the lives of millions of
people. In the long run, the
mutation-causing properties of
nuclear wastes pose a deadly
threat to humanity's survival.
Before Reeling's criticism of
the environmental movement is to
be taken seriously, he will first
have to develop an understanding
of basic environmental issues.

Concerning Steve Hefter's
article about pre-med engineering
students (Daily, Feb. 4) we would
like to, perhaps, prevent a few
misconceptions. While our course
of study may be rigorous, it is
really not all as bad as most
people seem to believe.
One of the goals of the
Stanford Association of
Engineering Pre-meds is to make
known the possibility of this
curriculum to those who might be
interested. We would therefore
like to encourage anyone
interested in undertaking this
course of study to contact either

Women Can Play Soccer
Editor:
As Daily readers know, there
has been much discussion about
the ability and purpose of the
Women's Center intramural soccer
team. Many people ridicule their
efforts and challenge their ability.
Or they ask what women are

doing in such a rough sport. The
women claim that they like the
sport and compete because it is
the only way they can play soccer
at Stanford. They acknowledge a
lack of experience but claim they
can compete the same way that
the men's teams do.
Though I believed in their
determination, I was
skeptical of their ability — until
my team played them. I came
determined to play just as I
always had (i.e. rough and
aggressively) and was expecting a
ridiculous score. We played our
best and did win, but not by an
unusual score.
That the women did that well
is to their credit. Four of nine of
our players had played varsity
high school soccer. The women
were first year soccer players. As a
result of their practices, I would
say that their skills were better
than most first-year players and
their determination was second to
none. In sum, the only difference
between the women's team and
any other was that they did not
begin their season with a few
experienced players.
They have the athletes and in
the future they will have the
experience. They may well
become a team to beat.

A Crisis For All
Editor:
Robert Tucker, professor of
international relations at Johns
Hopkins, has been misunderstood.
His article in Commentary and his
conversation with William F.
Buckley on Firing Line make it
clear that he is not calling for
immediate, or even long-range
military intervention by the U.S.
in the Middle East.
He is saying that in a situation
where the Arabs (whose price
gouge is already costing thousands
of lives in undeveloped countries)
are, with Russian support, already
aggressing against the West, we
cannot afford to shirk serious
consideration of some limited
military options involving risks of
the sort we have faced in the
recent past and that the Russians
have also faced and are still facing.
The fact that it is economic
aggression should not confuse us:
for example, if some small
country controlled our water
supply and suddenly cut it off. ..
The development of alternative
sources of energy will take a
dangerous amount of time (aside
from the still-controversial and
risky business of nuclear energy).

The defense of Israel is a
secondary matter in the minds of
most of us, but it is inevitably tied
in with the whole picture of
American dignity and the survival
of the Judeo-Christian ideal of
freedom and high culture which
some of us still want to encourage
in the world at large.
So the age-old reservoir of
anti-Semitism will undoubtedly be
opened up in this new dilemma, as
James Reston and I.F. Stone see
it. But since the traditional
anti-Semites are nationalists, the
situation is complex; in any event
we can't afford to be immobilized
