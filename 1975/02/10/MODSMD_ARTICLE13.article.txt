# Reduce Labor's Power

At a time when government
intervention in the economy
remains the biggest single cause of
our chronic inflation, the
American people can be grateful
to those of our representatives
who are attempting to solve the
problem by limiting government
instead of expanding it.
Special recognition should
certainly go to Sen. Paul Fannin
(R-Ariz.) and Sen. John Tower
(R-Texas) for their current efforts
to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act — a
piece of legislation which over the
years has lost the American
taxpayer literally billions of
dollars.
Enacted as an emergency
measure during the great
depression, Davis-Bacon initially
provided that contractors engaged
on federal projects must pay
wages comparable to the
"prevailing wage rates" of the
local areas. Fair enough, one
might suppose, especially since it
was left to the contractors
themselves to ascertain what the
"prevailing" rates were.
The problem arose when the
act was amended in 1935. In its
new form, the act required that
contractors adhere to wage scales
which the Department of Labor
had determined were prevailing in
local areas. Considering the
growing power and influence of
organized labor in this country,
the result of this amendment was
predictable: in determining wages
under the act, the Labor
Department soon came to adopt
as its yardstick the union wage
Scales of whatever large city was
nearest the site of any federal
project.
Thus, as Fannin carefully
notes, the people of San Luis
Valley of southern Colorado had
to pay 2V4 times what they should
have to construct a community
center because the Department of
Labor decreed that Denver wage
wctes :slK>lild apply to the project.
Similarly, Las Vegas wage rates
have been applied to
federally-assisted projects in rural
Utah and Arizona.

Tower, for his part, has
calculated that the number of
wage determinations issued yearly
by the Department of Labor has
increased approximately eightfold
between 1945 and 1970. At last
count, the Department was issuing
over 25,000 determinations a year
and, as these determinations have
the effect of increasing the
construction costs borne by the
federal government by 5 to 15
percent, there is simply no telling
the astronomical figure that this
single law has cost or will
continue to cost the American
taxpayer.
Even liberal economists have
become alarmed over the
inflationary impact of
Davis-Bacon. In an open letter to
President Ford, Dr. Walter Heller
— former chief economic advisor
to President Kennedy — recently
urged the act's repeal in the
strongest terms. Dr. Heller
suggested that if the President
were really "dead serious" about
fighting inflation he would call for
the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act
no matter how much bitter
opposition could be expected
from organized labor.
