## The 						House On San Juan Hill Jing Lyman Gives Us A Tour 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Creamy white geometric masses join together to
form the house on the hill. Through expanses of
olive, magnolia and stretching live oak trees, the
masses appear like strategically stacked bricks of
vanilla ice cream, one on top of the other.
It's a fairy-tale world of tiered terraces allowing
panoramic views from across the campus' red tiled
roofs to the waters of the San Francisco Bay.
Many presidents have lived there. The first was a
president of the United States, Herbert C. Hoover.
Hoover built the house in 1920 and lived there
while president of the University's Board of
Trustees. In 1944 he presented it to the University
in the name of his late wife, Lou Henry Hoover.
Lyman's Home
University presidents Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
J.E. Wallace Sterling and Kenneth S. Pitzer have
since occupied the Lou Henry Hoover House.
Today, the majestic ice cream castle of San Juan
Hill is the home of President Richard W. Lyman, his
wife Jing and their son Tim.
"I found living in the house very difficult at
first," says Mrs. Lyman. "I was used to doing all of
the cooking, and I wasn't adjusted to coping with
the idea of cooking a meal and then telephoning
everyone down to dinner because the house was so
big."
The narrow spiraling staircase winds up almost as
tight as a spring. Says Mrs. Lyman, "At first, the
sight of it | the staircase | appalled me, but as I got
to know it, I got to love it."
Its hand-carved oak banister gives the first hint
of the house's baronial English flavor, which she
says is "an incredible contrast to what I called its
1930s modern exterior."
Hoover House is resplendent with oak-paneled
rooms and heavy wooden beams "that serve no

functional purpose," Mrs. Lyman explains. They
exist "just because Mrs. Hoover wanted beams."
In 55 years the house has changed. Renovations
have been made; 17th, 18th and 19th century
antique furniture has been loaned to the house from
the Stanford Museum; and families have moved in
and out. Each family brings with it something new.
Mr. Hoover's study is now the Lyman's sitting
room, and it displays most of their personal
belongings. "This is where we live," says Mrs.
Lyman.
Miniature Bear Collection
There is a spacious Oriental rug (on loan from
the Committee on Art), and the Lymans'own blue
Danish modern chairs and couch. And behind the
glass doors of a stately antique secretary, dwells the
Lymans' collection of miniature bears.
Says Mrs. Lyman, "It started with a single perfect
bear we found the day after we were married. It's
ironic that the president of Stanford has a bear
collection, but it shows we're real Californians."
Standing in front of the sitting room are the
speakers of the Lymans' stereo system. "That's the
most important instrument in the whole house," she
says.
"The family enjoys everything from classical
music to "Doc Watson and Maria Muldaur."
300 Concealed Light Bulbs
"The whole nature of Dick's job," explains Mrs.
Lyman, "means that he has five constituencies —
trustees, students, faculty, alumni and staff — not to
mention the outside world.
"We try to keep some sort of balance between
them." Entertaining those people is part of keeping
that balance.
For that reason, the most important rooms in the
house are the dining and living rooms, where all the
entertaining takes place.

The camel and beige living room features a coved
ceiling with 300 concealed light bulbs. "Mrs. Hoover
didn't want overhead lighting," says Mrs. Lyman.
"She preferred indirect lighting."
Tangerine Colored Turkish Rug
The only bright colors in the room come from
flower arrangements Mrs. Lyman makes herself ("it
saves expenses"), from a tangerine colored Turkish
rug in the adjacent dining room and from a rotating
display of painting and sculpture.
The art is borrowed for three or four months at a
time from students, faculty and staff on campus.
The living room — mostly open space
interspersed with large comfortable couches and
arm chairs — is designed especially for large scale
entertaining. The number of guests range from 14 to
50 at a time, but last year's graduate student
reception ran a guest list of 3000.
With the help of her children and a rotating list
of financial aid students who help out as bartenders,
waiters and waitresses, Mrs. Lyman is able to carry
out the 21 parties, teas, and luncheon receptions
that were held last quarter alone.
Mrs. Lyman explains, "We try to work on a slim
margin, and not to be overly lavish as far as
expenditures. We try to serve food which isn't just
what you'd get in a routine meal, which is attractive
and good without being overly ostentatious.
"We have made a conscious decision not to serve
premium quality alcohol, and instead buy very good
bottled house names. This way," she says, "you
aren't paying for Johnny Walker or Chivas Regal
liquor and it saves an enormous amount of money."
When entertaining, she explains, "you're
constantly facing the problem of doing things in the
most economic way, and at the same time putting
the University's best foot forward."

reception ran a guest list of 3000.
With the help of her children and a rotating list
of financial aid students who help out as bartenders,
waiters and waitresses, Mrs. Lyman is able to carry
out the 21 parties, teas, and luncheon receptions
that were held last quarter alone.
Mrs. Lyman explains, "We try to work on a slim
margin, and not to be overly lavish as far as
expenditures. We try to serve food which isn't just
what you'd get in a routine meal, which is attractive
and good without being overly ostentatious.
"We have made a conscious decision not to serve
premium quality alcohol, and instead buy very good
bottled house names. This way," she says, "you
aren't paying for Johnny Walker or Chivas Regal
liquor and it saves an enormous amount of money."
When entertaining, she explains, "you're
constantly facing the problem of doing things in the
most economic way, and at the same time putting
the University's best foot forward."


NO PLACE LIKE HOME—Jing Lyman, wife of University President Richard
Lyman, relaxes in the living room of the family's presidential estate, originally
built in 1920 by Herbert Hoover. As part of a continuing display of University
art, a student painting and a faculty sculpture brighten up the room, often used
for entertaining guests.
Creamy white geometric masses join together to
form the house on the hill. Through expanses of
olive, magnolia and stretching live oak trees, the
masses appear like strategically stacked bricks of
vanilla ice cream, one on top of the other.
It's a fairy-tale world of tiered terraces allowing
panoramic views from across the campus' red tiled
roofs to the waters of the San Francisco Bay.
Many presidents have lived there. The first was a
president of the United States, Herbert C. Hoover.
Hoover built the house in 1920 and lived there
while president of the University's Board of
Trustees. In 1944 he presented it to the University
in the name of his late wife, Lou Henry Hoover.
Lyman's Home
University presidents Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
J.E. Wallace Sterling and Kenneth S. Pitzer have
since occupied the Lou Henry Hoover House.
Today, the majestic ice cream castle of San Juan
Hill is the home of President Richard W. Lyman, his
wife Jing and their son Tim.
"I found living in the house very difficult at
first," says Mrs. Lyman. "I was used to doing all of
the cooking, and I wasn't adjusted to coping with
the idea of cooking a meal and then telephoning
everyone down to dinner because the house was so
big."
The narrow spiraling staircase winds up almost as
tight as a spring. Says Mrs. Lyman, "At first, the
sight of it | the staircase | appalled me, but as I got
to know it, I got to love it."
Its hand-carved oak banister gives the first hint
of the house's baronial English flavor, which she
says is "an incredible contrast to what I called its
1930s modern exterior."
Hoover House is resplendent with oak-paneled
rooms and heavy wooden beams "that serve no

functional purpose," Mrs. Lyman explains. They
exist "just because Mrs. Hoover wanted beams."
In 55 years the house has changed. Renovations
have been made; 17th, 18th and 19th century
antique furniture has been loaned to the house from
the Stanford Museum; and families have moved in
and out. Each family brings with it something new.
Mr. Hoover's study is now the Lyman's sitting
room, and it displays most of their personal
belongings. "This is where we live," says Mrs.
Lyman.
Miniature Bear Collection
There is a spacious Oriental rug (on loan from
the Committee on Art), and the Lymans'own blue
Danish modern chairs and couch. And behind the
glass doors of a stately antique secretary, dwells the
Lymans' collection of miniature bears.
Says Mrs. Lyman, "It started with a single perfect
bear we found the day after we were married. It's
ironic that the president of Stanford has a bear
collection, but it shows we're real Californians."
Standing in front of the sitting room are the
speakers of the Lymans' stereo system. "That's the
most important instrument in the whole house," she
says.
"The family enjoys everything from classical
music to "Doc Watson and Maria Muldaur."
300 Concealed Light Bulbs
"The whole nature of Dick's job," explains Mrs.
Lyman, "means that he has five constituencies —
trustees, students, faculty, alumni and staff — not to
mention the outside world.
"We try to keep some sort of balance between
them." Entertaining those people is part of keeping
that balance.
For that reason, the most important rooms in the
house are the dining and living rooms, where all the
entertaining takes place.

The camel and beige living room features a coved
ceiling with 300 concealed light bulbs. "Mrs. Hoover
didn't want overhead lighting," says Mrs. Lyman.
"She preferred indirect lighting."
Tangerine Colored Turkish Rug
The only bright colors in the room come from
flower arrangements Mrs. Lyman makes herself ("it
saves expenses"), from a tangerine colored Turkish
rug in the adjacent dining room and from a rotating
display of painting and sculpture.
The art is borrowed for three or four months at a
time from students, faculty and staff on campus.
The living room — mostly open space
interspersed with large comfortable couches and
arm chairs — is designed especially for large scale
entertaining. The number of guests range from 14 to
50 at a time, but last year's graduate student
reception ran a guest list of 3000.

music to "Doc Watson and Maria Muldaur."
300 Concealed Light Bulbs
"The whole nature of Dick's job," explains Mrs.
Lyman, "means that he has five constituencies —
trustees, students, faculty, alumni and staff — not to
mention the outside world.
"We try to keep some sort of balance between
them." Entertaining those people is part of keeping
that balance.
For that reason, the most important rooms in the
house are the dining and living rooms, where all the
entertaining takes place.

The camel and beige living room features a coved
ceiling with 300 concealed light bulbs. "Mrs. Hoover
didn't want overhead lighting," says Mrs. Lyman.
"She preferred indirect lighting."
Tangerine Colored Turkish Rug
The only bright colors in the room come from
flower arrangements Mrs. Lyman makes herself ("it
saves expenses"), from a tangerine colored Turkish
rug in the adjacent dining room and from a rotating
display of painting and sculpture.
The art is borrowed for three or four months at a
time from students, faculty and staff on campus.
The living room — mostly open space
interspersed with large comfortable couches and
arm chairs — is designed especially for large scale
entertaining. The number of guests range from 14 to
50 at a time, but last year's graduate student
reception ran a guest list of 3000.
With the help of her children and a rotating list
of financial aid students who help out as bartenders,
waiters and waitresses, Mrs. Lyman is able to carry
out the 21 parties, teas, and luncheon receptions
that were held last quarter alone.
Mrs. Lyman explains, "We try to work on a slim
margin, and not to be overly lavish as far as
expenditures. We try to serve food which isn't just
what you'd get in a routine meal, which is attractive
and good without being overly ostentatious.
"We have made a conscious decision not to serve
premium quality alcohol, and instead buy very good
bottled house names. This way," she says, "you
aren't paying for Johnny Walker or Chivas Regal
liquor and it saves an enormous amount of money."
When entertaining, she explains, "you're
constantly facing the problem of doing things in the
most economic way, and at the same time putting
the University's best foot forward."


NO PLACE LIKE HOME—Jing Lyman, wife of University President Richard
Lyman, relaxes in the living room of the family's presidential estate, originally
built in 1920 by Herbert Hoover. As part of a continuing display of University
art, a student painting and a faculty sculpture brighten up the room, often used
for entertaining guests.
Creamy white geometric masses join together to
form the house on the hill. Through expanses of
olive, magnolia and stretching live oak trees, the
masses appear like strategically stacked bricks of
vanilla ice cream, one on top of the other.
It's a fairy-tale world of tiered terraces allowing
panoramic views from across the campus' red tiled
roofs to the waters of the San Francisco Bay.
Many presidents have lived there. The first was a
president of the United States, Herbert C. Hoover.
Hoover built the house in 1920 and lived there
while president of the University's Board of
Trustees. In 1944 he presented it to the University
in the name of his late wife, Lou Henry Hoover.
Lyman's Home
University presidents Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
J.E. Wallace Sterling and Kenneth S. Pitzer have
since occupied the Lou Henry Hoover House.
Today, the majestic ice cream castle of San Juan
Hill is the home of President Richard W. Lyman, his
wife Jing and their son Tim.
"I found living in the house very difficult at
first," says Mrs. Lyman. "I was used to doing all of
the cooking, and I wasn't adjusted to coping with
the idea of cooking a meal and then telephoning
everyone down to dinner because the house was so
big."
The narrow spiraling staircase winds up almost as
tight as a spring. Says Mrs. Lyman, "At first, the
sight of it | the staircase | appalled me, but as I got
to know it, I got to love it."
Its hand-carved oak banister gives the first hint
of the house's baronial English flavor, which she
says is "an incredible contrast to what I called its
1930s modern exterior."
Hoover House is resplendent with oak-paneled
rooms and heavy wooden beams "that serve no

functional purpose," Mrs. Lyman explains. They
exist "just because Mrs. Hoover wanted beams."
In 55 years the house has changed. Renovations
have been made; 17th, 18th and 19th century
antique furniture has been loaned to the house from
the Stanford Museum; and families have moved in
and out. Each family brings with it something new.
Mr. Hoover's study is now the Lyman's sitting
room, and it displays most of their personal
belongings. "This is where we live," says Mrs.
Lyman.
Miniature Bear Collection
There is a spacious Oriental rug (on loan from
the Committee on Art), and the Lymans'own blue
Danish modern chairs and couch. And behind the
glass doors of a stately antique secretary, dwells the
Lymans' collection of miniature bears.
Says Mrs. Lyman, "It started with a single perfect
bear we found the day after we were married. It's
ironic that the president of Stanford has a bear
collection, but it shows we're real Californians."
Standing in front of the sitting room are the
speakers of the Lymans' stereo system. "That's the
most important instrument in the whole house," she
says.
"The family enjoys everything from classical
music to "Doc Watson and Maria Muldaur."
