# Now Legally Available Back East
## Coorsâ€”-No Longer Contraband 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -
Airline stewardesses have stashed
six-packs in their travel bags. A
Secret Service agent allegedly
piled 40 cases in a place carrying
Henry Kissinger's limousine from
California to Washington.
Now those without
connections are able to get Coors
beer in the East.
The legendary brew from
Golden, Colo., is on the market
here for the first time, and buyers
are stampeding the first
distributor to stock it.
Coors is the nation's fourth
largest selling beer, despite having
outlets in only 11 western states.
Last month the Supreme Court
told the company it could not
prohibit sales to the other 39
states.

Now Paul Bros, here is
importing the beer, and lines have
formed to snap it up at $12.50 a
case, about $1 a case more than
the average imported beer.
'Good Beer'
"It's a good beer, a true draft
beer,"says Paul Lipschutz,
president of the distributor. "But
the key to its popularity probably
is that it just hasn't been
available."
The key is also its light,
smooth taste. In California, where
it is available, it commands 41
percent of the market, and it
outsells its competition in 10 of
the 11 western states where it is
widely distributed. In Texas, the
11th state, it does not top the list
because it is only sold in certain
areas.

"We're only planning to offer
it as a specialty item," Lipsehutz
said. "We are still trying to see
how much of a demand there will
be."
Demand High
On Thursday, the day the first
small advertisement appeared in a
newspaper here, the demand was
high. By midal'ternoon, Lipsehutz
was impressed.
"I've been on the phone all
day,"he said. "We've gotten more
than 400 calls so far. People have
been calling up and coming out
here to pick up three or four
cases. It's amazing."
Officials at Coors refuse to sell
more beer than their single plant
in Colorado can produce, claiming
the water is most important.
But now that same small
supply will have to stretch to
cover all 50 states.
And distributors will be
watching to see if the absence of
snob appeal will hurt the Coors
charisma.

beer in the East.
The legendary brew from
Golden, Colo., is on the market
here for the first time, and buyers
are stampeding the first
distributor to stock it.
Coors is the nation's fourth
largest selling beer, despite having
outlets in only 11 western states.
Last month the Supreme Court
told the company it could not
prohibit sales to the other 39
states.

Now Paul Bros, here is
importing the beer, and lines have
formed to snap it up at $12.50 a
case, about $1 a case more than
the average imported beer.
'Good Beer'
"It's a good beer, a true draft
beer,"says Paul Lipschutz,
president of the distributor. "But
the key to its popularity probably
is that it just hasn't been
available."
The key is also its light,
smooth taste. In California, where
it is available, it commands 41
percent of the market, and it
outsells its competition in 10 of
the 11 western states where it is
widely distributed. In Texas, the
11th state, it does not top the list
because it is only sold in certain
areas.

"We're only planning to offer
it as a specialty item," Lipsehutz
said. "We are still trying to see
how much of a demand there will
be."
Demand High
On Thursday, the day the first
small advertisement appeared in a
newspaper here, the demand was
high. By midal'ternoon, Lipsehutz
was impressed.
"I've been on the phone all
day,"he said. "We've gotten more
than 400 calls so far. People have
been calling up and coming out
here to pick up three or four
cases. It's amazing."
Officials at Coors refuse to sell
more beer than their single plant
in Colorado can produce, claiming
the water is most important.
But now that same small
supply will have to stretch to
cover all 50 states.
And distributors will be
watching to see if the absence of
snob appeal will hurt the Coors
charisma.
