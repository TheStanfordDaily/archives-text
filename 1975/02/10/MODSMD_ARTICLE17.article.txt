BEI'S RUNNING—Card second baseman Gary Bei heads for home on a Joe Hinojosa fourth-inning
triple as Gary Malkasian and third-base coach Mark Marquess signal in unison. Bei scored again in the
seventh on a Hinojosa double, and the Cards thrashed USF in the second game of a doubleheader
Saturday, 13-0. Stanford also took the opener, 3-2.
