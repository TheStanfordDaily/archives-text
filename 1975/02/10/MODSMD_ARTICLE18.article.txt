# Batsmen Nab Twin-bill
## 
### 
Displaying a balance of
veterans and newcomers, the
Stanford baseball team swept a
doubleheader with the University
of San Francisco yesterday, 3-2
and 13-0.
The second game of the
season-opening twin bill was cut
short by rain, but not before the
Cards proved they are indeed a
"championship-class ball club."
Shortstop Steve Davis and
first baseman Tom Guardino paced
the Cardinals in the first game
with home runs in the fifth
inning.
Ken Grolle got the win for the
Cards, pitching five innings and
allowing only one run on four

hits. Jerry Argust and Ed Matta
also saw action on the mound in
that game; Matta, a transfer from
Claremont, making his debut.
Freshman Joe Hinojosa blasted
the Dons in the second game,
driving in six runs with a triple in
the fourth and a double in the
seventh. All of Stanford's runs
came in those two innings.
Mike Williamson got the win for
the Cards; he entered the game in
the fourth to replace the starter,
A 1 Arthur. Jim Scharffenberger
relieved Williamson in the seventh,
and struck out three during the
two innings he pitched.
Stanford plays Santa Clara
tomorrow at 2 p.m.
