# Cagers Win Stats But Lose Game...
## 
### DAN PYNE 
There is joy in Mudville.
Out-rebounded, out-shot, out-fouled and out-fdaye.d, the
Washington Huskies beat Stanford 69-68 Saturday.
Why, why is it always us?
With five seconds remaining, the Cards were down 69-67, and
Melvin Arterberry had the ball at the top of the key. He passed to
Scott Trobbe on the left baseline. Trobbe dribbled toward the basket
and shot. A whistle blew. The ball bounced off the rim but Ed
Schweitzer tipped it in as the buzzer sounded.
Everyone thought it was a tie game. It wasn't. The ref who blew
the whistle walked to the official scorer, and, after some consultation,
announced there was a foul on Washington's Larry Jackson. The
basket was no good. Trobbe went to the line with a one-and-one.
He made the first one. Six-thousand fans screamed. He missed the
second. But that wasn't where the game was lost.
"Scott's shot was not that big a deal," coach Howie Dallmar said
afterward. "We had a chance to win the game earlier and we didn't
take advantage of it. The missed free-throws hurt."
The Cards shot barely 50 percent from the line, making 14 of 24
attempts. The Huskies made 17 of 25 attempts.
"They were fouling us," Dallmar said, "and we weren't making the
foul shots. You can't shoot that poorly from the line and still win in
this conference."
Stanford led for most of the game. At halftime, the Cards were up
30-24 and it looked like they were pulling away. But the Huskies hung
on. Stanford would build up a five or six point lead, and Washington
would cut it back down. Midway in the second period the Cards were
up by seven, 49-42. And then the free-throw troubles began.
With six minutes remaining the Cards were up by only three,
55-52. In the next two minutes Stanford went two for seven at the
line, and scored only one field goal.
Washington, bombing from the outside, took the lead 61-57. Now
Stanford was trying to hang on. The Cards tied it up at 61 and the
Huskies pulled away again. With 34 seconds left they led 69-63.
Careful planning, time-outs, and fouls enabled the Cards to draw
within two.
And that brings us back to the beginning. Or end.
"I honestly didn't hear a whistle or see the refs arm go up,"
Dallmar explained. "Eddie Schweitzer said he heard a whistle, but he's
also sure he made his shot before the buzzer. Our question is, if he
had time to put that shot in after the foul was called, why weren't
there one or two seconds left on the clock?"
It's a good question.

There is joy in Mudville.
Out-rebounded, out-shot, out-fouled and out-fdaye.d, the
Washington Huskies beat Stanford 69-68 Saturday.
Why, why is it always us?
With five seconds remaining, the Cards were down 69-67, and
Melvin Arterberry had the ball at the top of the key. He passed to
Scott Trobbe on the left baseline. Trobbe dribbled toward the basket
and shot. A whistle blew. The ball bounced off the rim but Ed
Schweitzer tipped it in as the buzzer sounded.
Everyone thought it was a tie game. It wasn't. The ref who blew
the whistle walked to the official scorer, and, after some consultation,
announced there was a foul on Washington's Larry Jackson. The
basket was no good. Trobbe went to the line with a one-and-one.
He made the first one. Six-thousand fans screamed. He missed the
second. But that wasn't where the game was lost.
"Scott's shot was not that big a deal," coach Howie Dallmar said
afterward. "We had a chance to win the game earlier and we didn't
take advantage of it. The missed free-throws hurt."
The Cards shot barely 50 percent from the line, making 14 of 24
attempts. The Huskies made 17 of 25 attempts.
"They were fouling us," Dallmar said, "and we weren't making the
foul shots. You can't shoot that poorly from the line and still win in
this conference."
Stanford led for most of the game. At halftime, the Cards were up
30-24 and it looked like they were pulling away. But the Huskies hung
on. Stanford would build up a five or six point lead, and Washington
would cut it back down. Midway in the second period the Cards were
up by seven, 49-42. And then the free-throw troubles began.
With six minutes remaining the Cards were up by only three,
55-52. In the next two minutes Stanford went two for seven at the
line, and scored only one field goal.
Washington, bombing from the outside, took the lead 61-57. Now
Stanford was trying to hang on. The Cards tied it up at 61 and the
Huskies pulled away again. With 34 seconds left they led 69-63.
Careful planning, time-outs, and fouls enabled the Cards to draw
within two.
And that brings us back to the beginning. Or end.
"I honestly didn't hear a whistle or see the refs arm go up,"
Dallmar explained. "Eddie Schweitzer said he heard a whistle, but he's
also sure he made his shot before the buzzer. Our question is, if he
had time to put that shot in after the foul was called, why weren't
there one or two seconds left on the clock?"
It's a good question.

There is joy in Mudville.
Out-rebounded, out-shot, out-fouled and out-fdaye.d, the
Washington Huskies beat Stanford 69-68 Saturday.
Why, why is it always us?
With five seconds remaining, the Cards were down 69-67, and
Melvin Arterberry had the ball at the top of the key. He passed to
Scott Trobbe on the left baseline. Trobbe dribbled toward the basket
and shot. A whistle blew. The ball bounced off the rim but Ed
Schweitzer tipped it in as the buzzer sounded.
Everyone thought it was a tie game. It wasn't. The ref who blew
the whistle walked to the official scorer, and, after some consultation,
announced there was a foul on Washington's Larry Jackson. The
basket was no good. Trobbe went to the line with a one-and-one.
He made the first one. Six-thousand fans screamed. He missed the
second. But that wasn't where the game was lost.
"Scott's shot was not that big a deal," coach Howie Dallmar said
afterward. "We had a chance to win the game earlier and we didn't
take advantage of it. The missed free-throws hurt."
The Cards shot barely 50 percent from the line, making 14 of 24
attempts. The Huskies made 17 of 25 attempts.
"They were fouling us," Dallmar said, "and we weren't making the
foul shots. You can't shoot that poorly from the line and still win in
this conference."
Stanford led for most of the game. At halftime, the Cards were up
30-24 and it looked like they were pulling away. But the Huskies hung
on. Stanford would build up a five or six point lead, and Washington
would cut it back down. Midway in the second period the Cards were
up by seven, 49-42. And then the free-throw troubles began.
With six minutes remaining the Cards were up by only three,
55-52. In the next two minutes Stanford went two for seven at the
line, and scored only one field goal.
Washington, bombing from the outside, took the lead 61-57. Now
Stanford was trying to hang on. The Cards tied it up at 61 and the
Huskies pulled away again. With 34 seconds left they led 69-63.
Careful planning, time-outs, and fouls enabled the Cards to draw
within two.
And that brings us back to the beginning. Or end.
"I honestly didn't hear a whistle or see the refs arm go up,"
Dallmar explained. "Eddie Schweitzer said he heard a whistle, but he's
also sure he made his shot before the buzzer. Our question is, if he
had time to put that shot in after the foul was called, why weren't
there one or two seconds left on the clock?"
It's a good question.
