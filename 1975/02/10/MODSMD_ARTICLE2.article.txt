# Is There Anyone Out There?
## Profs Debate Man's Uniqueness 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Man may be deslined to colonize the universe, according
to Electrical Engineering Prof. Ronald N. Bracewell.
"We are the only intelligent beings known to exist," said
Bracewell, author of The Calactic Club: Intelligent Life in
Outer Space, a volume in the Stanford Alumni
Association's "Portable Stanford" series.
Erom his knowledge, man could conclude that
"evolution did a good job in one place at one time," and
go on to "wonder if our destiny does not include
populating interstellar space," Bracewell said in an
interview.
This theory conflicts with the orthodox view that what
happened on Earth could just as well have happened
elsewhere.
"There's nothing unique about life on Earth," said
Electrical Engineering Prof. Von R. Eshleman, co-director
of the Star Center For Radar Astronomy. He theorized that
"a large number" of other worlds must have had the proper
conditions for life to begin.
'No One Knows'
"No one really knows," said Bracewell. "Until we find
life elsewhere, we are guessing if life on earth is a rare event

or something to be expected."
"The key" to discovering extraterrestrial life could be
radio waves, Bracewell said.
"Project Cyclops," a study made in 1971 by the
Stanford/NASA/Ames Summer Faculty Fellowship
Program, proposed setting up a cluster of 10,000 large radio
telescopes to listen for signals from any extraterrestrial
civilizations.
'Trifling Sum'
The Cyclops Project would cost $6-$ lO billion — "about
what we spend in cigarettes per annum," Bracewell
commented. However, spread out over a 10-year period,
the costs would constitute "a trifling sum at a national
level," he maintained.
If contact is made with an extraterrestrial civilization,
the result might be a "slightly shattering effect on our ego
to find that we're not " 'top dog,' " Bracewell predicted.
But, if other civilizations are more advanced, man might
be able to get "information that may be helpful" in solving
"problems that require more technical input than we have,"
he said. For example, man might borrow the formula for a
cure for cancer, or a cheap, smog-free automobile engine.
'Columbus Principle'
However, according to what Bracewell calls the
"Coiumbus Principle," the more advanced culture does the
discovering, so a gain from others' knowledge seems
doubtful.
"After all, Columbus discovered America; the American
natives did not discover Europe," he said.
Describing efforts to date as a "bumbling sort of
enterprise," Bracewell said that more discussion on
interstellar communication is needed.
Funding 'Way Off'
The possibility of funding for Project Cyclops remains
"way off in the future," according to Dr. John Billingham,
chief of the biotechnology division at Ames Research
Center and one of the directors of the summer study which
proposed the project.
Billingham added that research on the subject is being
continued at a "low level" at Ames Research Center with a
few people working part-time in an "interstellar
communication study group" that he heads. The group is
receiving $145,000 from NASA this fiscal year "for study
only," Billingham reported.
Interest in interstellar communication is not new,
Bracewell observed. 3efore radio waves were discovered, he
said, mathematician Karl Gauss had proposed planting a
forest in Siberia in the form of the proof for the
Pythagorean Theorem. If intelligent extraterrestrial beings
were observing the earth, Gauss had argued, the figure
would show them that there was intelligent life on Earth.

"evolution did a good job in one place at one time," and
go on to "wonder if our destiny does not include
populating interstellar space," Bracewell said in an
interview.
This theory conflicts with the orthodox view that what
happened on Earth could just as well have happened
elsewhere.
"There's nothing unique about life on Earth," said
Electrical Engineering Prof. Von R. Eshleman, co-director
of the Star Center For Radar Astronomy. He theorized that
"a large number" of other worlds must have had the proper
conditions for life to begin.
'No One Knows'
"No one really knows," said Bracewell. "Until we find
life elsewhere, we are guessing if life on earth is a rare event

or something to be expected."
"The key" to discovering extraterrestrial life could be
radio waves, Bracewell said.
"Project Cyclops," a study made in 1971 by the
Stanford/NASA/Ames Summer Faculty Fellowship
Program, proposed setting up a cluster of 10,000 large radio
telescopes to listen for signals from any extraterrestrial
civilizations.
'Trifling Sum'
The Cyclops Project would cost $6-$ lO billion — "about
what we spend in cigarettes per annum," Bracewell
commented. However, spread out over a 10-year period,
the costs would constitute "a trifling sum at a national
level," he maintained.
If contact is made with an extraterrestrial civilization,
the result might be a "slightly shattering effect on our ego
to find that we're not " 'top dog,' " Bracewell predicted.
But, if other civilizations are more advanced, man might
be able to get "information that may be helpful" in solving
"problems that require more technical input than we have,"
he said. For example, man might borrow the formula for a
cure for cancer, or a cheap, smog-free automobile engine.
'Columbus Principle'
However, according to what Bracewell calls the
"Coiumbus Principle," the more advanced culture does the
discovering, so a gain from others' knowledge seems
doubtful.
"After all, Columbus discovered America; the American
natives did not discover Europe," he said.
Describing efforts to date as a "bumbling sort of
enterprise," Bracewell said that more discussion on
interstellar communication is needed.
Funding 'Way Off'
The possibility of funding for Project Cyclops remains
"way off in the future," according to Dr. John Billingham,
chief of the biotechnology division at Ames Research
Center and one of the directors of the summer study which
proposed the project.
Billingham added that research on the subject is being
continued at a "low level" at Ames Research Center with a
few people working part-time in an "interstellar
communication study group" that he heads. The group is
receiving $145,000 from NASA this fiscal year "for study
only," Billingham reported.
Interest in interstellar communication is not new,
Bracewell observed. 3efore radio waves were discovered, he
said, mathematician Karl Gauss had proposed planting a
forest in Siberia in the form of the proof for the
Pythagorean Theorem. If intelligent extraterrestrial beings
were observing the earth, Gauss had argued, the figure
would show them that there was intelligent life on Earth.

Man may be deslined to colonize the universe, according
to Electrical Engineering Prof. Ronald N. Bracewell.
"We are the only intelligent beings known to exist," said
Bracewell, author of The Calactic Club: Intelligent Life in
Outer Space, a volume in the Stanford Alumni
Association's "Portable Stanford" series.
