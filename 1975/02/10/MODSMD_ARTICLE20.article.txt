"I'm as happy as a clam at
Pismo Beach at high tide," Aly
Trompas exclaimed Saturday
after leading Stanford's golf team
to a pair of easy home-course
victories in the Cards' first
competitive weekend of the
season.
Trompas, a senior who entered
Stanford in 1971 as the nation's
top-ranked junior golfer, seemed
more pleased with his game this
weekend than he had in three
struggling years on the varsity.
Friday, he shot an even-par 71 as
the Cards trounced Fresno State
24 1 /2-2 1 /2, and Saturday he fired a
three-under-par 68 to lead
Stanford past the alumni, 22-5.
For the two rounds he had
seven birdies, 25 pars and only
four bogies. "This is the best I've
driven the ball," Trompas said
~&fter Saturday's round. "On every

single hole I was in absolutely
perfect position."
Trompas' teammates weren't
quite as ecstatic, but most of
them also played solid golf over
the weekend. Friday, Dave
Baskins shot 71 to share medalist
honors with Trompas, while
freshman Mike Peck shot 73,
Conrad Nilmeier carded a 74 and
Mike Mcßride shot 75. Saturday,
Nilmeier fired a 71, Peck shot 74
and Mcßride recorded his second
straight 75.

Top-notch individual efforts
couldn't offset a lack of depth for
Stanford's gymnastics team in two
losses against Cal this weekend.
Friday, at Encina Gym, Cal
cruised to a 197.55 to 162.40 win
in a compulsory exercises meet.
Although the Cards took an early

lead, they were knocked out of
competition by leaving two sports
unfilled on the rings.
In the optional exercise meet
Saturday, Cal won 214.10 to
204.05 largely because they had
enough depth to aiways slough
their lowest score.
The Card's Ted Marcy, last
year's NCAA pommel horse
champion, turned in a season best
9.7 out of a possible 10. That
score, and the 9.4 that Marcy
posted in the compulsories
Friday, are the best college scores
for the pommel horse this season.

"This is like the second team
playing last year's first team,"
screamed the angry fan, after the
Bay Area Touring Side had taken
a 28-0 halftime lead over the Card
ruggers in Saturday's contest at

Harry Maloney Field.
The outraged fan wasn't all
wrong. The game might well
have been billed as the Stanford
alumni vs. Stanford. Former
Cardinal ruggers Eric Test, Kip
Ornian, Mike Wood, Doug Single
and Howie Williams accounted for
38 of the BATS' points, while the
BAT scrum, featuring such
familiar names as Gordy Riegel
and John Snider, dominated the
Card scrum.
The loss was the third in a row
for the ruggers, dropping their
season mark to 2-3.

"This is like the second team
playing last year's first team,"
screamed the angry fan, after the
Bay Area Touring Side had taken
a 28-0 halftime lead over the Card
ruggers in Saturday's contest at

Harry Maloney Field.
The outraged fan wasn't all
wrong. The game might well
have been billed as the Stanford
alumni vs. Stanford. Former
Cardinal ruggers Eric Test, Kip
Ornian, Mike Wood, Doug Single
and Howie Williams accounted for
38 of the BATS' points, while the
BAT scrum, featuring such
familiar names as Gordy Riegel
and John Snider, dominated the
Card scrum.
The loss was the third in a row
for the ruggers, dropping their
season mark to 2-3.

"I'm as happy as a clam at
Pismo Beach at high tide," Aly
Trompas exclaimed Saturday
after leading Stanford's golf team
to a pair of easy home-course
victories in the Cards' first
competitive weekend of the
season.
Trompas, a senior who entered
Stanford in 1971 as the nation's
top-ranked junior golfer, seemed
more pleased with his game this
weekend than he had in three
struggling years on the varsity.
Friday, he shot an even-par 71 as
the Cards trounced Fresno State
24 1 /2-2 1 /2, and Saturday he fired a
three-under-par 68 to lead
Stanford past the alumni, 22-5.
For the two rounds he had
seven birdies, 25 pars and only
four bogies. "This is the best I've
driven the ball," Trompas said
~&fter Saturday's round. "On every

single hole I was in absolutely
perfect position."
Trompas' teammates weren't
quite as ecstatic, but most of
them also played solid golf over
the weekend. Friday, Dave
Baskins shot 71 to share medalist
honors with Trompas, while
freshman Mike Peck shot 73,
Conrad Nilmeier carded a 74 and
Mike Mcßride shot 75. Saturday,
Nilmeier fired a 71, Peck shot 74
and Mcßride recorded his second
straight 75.

Top-notch individual efforts
couldn't offset a lack of depth for
Stanford's gymnastics team in two
losses against Cal this weekend.
Friday, at Encina Gym, Cal
cruised to a 197.55 to 162.40 win
in a compulsory exercises meet.
Although the Cards took an early

lead, they were knocked out of
competition by leaving two sports
unfilled on the rings.
In the optional exercise meet
Saturday, Cal won 214.10 to
204.05 largely because they had
enough depth to aiways slough
their lowest score.
The Card's Ted Marcy, last
year's NCAA pommel horse
champion, turned in a season best
9.7 out of a possible 10. That
score, and the 9.4 that Marcy
posted in the compulsories
Friday, are the best college scores
for the pommel horse this season.
