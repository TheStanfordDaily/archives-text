### BOB KUSTEL 
Stanford swimmers pulled off
their biggest dual meet win of the
year Saturday by downing rival
UCLA, 65-48.
The meet went down to the
wire and featured several clutch
performances by various Cards.
Earlier in the week, UCLA
Coach George Haines had
proclaimed the freestyle sprints to
be the key events, and a 1-2 finish
in the 50-yard free by Dave
Fairbank and Dean Anderson
sufficiently dampened the Bruin
hopes. Anderson edged out Bruin
Steve Austin by one-tenth of a
second, and Fairbank, who also
captured the 100 yard free, set
two meet and pool records with
his two wins. He currently is the
number-one 50 free man in the
college ranks following his blazing
20.6 clocking.
Mike Bruner's three wins
bolstered the Card attack, as the
freshman set three meet and two
pool records with his wins in the
1000-yard free, the 500 free, and
the 200-yard butterfly.
Card Coach Jim Gaughran had
stated earlier in the week that the
diving events would be crucial,
and sophomore Wayne Wager's
strong performance provided
Gaughran with the needed points.
Wager garnered a first in the
1-meter event, and second in the
3-meter.
John Hencken continued his
winning ways, setting a meet and
pool record in his 200 Individual
Medley win, and crushing UCLA's
Kip Virts in the 200-yard
breastroke. Freshman Stu Corliss
also had an outstanding day in the
200 IM and 200 breastroke.
The women's team was crushed
by the Bruins 88-17, in a
"double-dual" meet with
UC-Davis. Both UCLA and
Stanford beat Davis, 96-5 and
69-28 respectively.
Coach Betsy Weeks said the
Cards "swam very well," but
admitted the meet was "a little
top-heavy." The Cards were
without the services of three of
their top performers, but Liz
Lambert and Cathy Heinze both
swam well enough to qualify for
the AIAW nationals.
Weeks said the meet was good
for the women swimmers because
it allowed them to "find out how
tough national competition really
is." She said UCLA has a strength
that is indicative of the really top
swimmers in the country. The
Bruins are ranked fifth in the
country, Stanford ranks twelfth.

200 IM and 200 breastroke.
The women's team was crushed
by the Bruins 88-17, in a
"double-dual" meet with
UC-Davis. Both UCLA and
Stanford beat Davis, 96-5 and
69-28 respectively.
Coach Betsy Weeks said the
Cards "swam very well," but
admitted the meet was "a little
top-heavy." The Cards were
without the services of three of
their top performers, but Liz
Lambert and Cathy Heinze both
swam well enough to qualify for
the AIAW nationals.
Weeks said the meet was good
for the women swimmers because
it allowed them to "find out how
tough national competition really
is." She said UCLA has a strength
that is indicative of the really top
swimmers in the country. The
Bruins are ranked fifth in the
country, Stanford ranks twelfth.
Stanford swimmers pulled off
their biggest dual meet win of the
year Saturday by downing rival
UCLA, 65-48.
The meet went down to the
wire and featured several clutch
performances by various Cards.
Earlier in the week, UCLA
Coach George Haines had
proclaimed the freestyle sprints to
be the key events, and a 1-2 finish
in the 50-yard free by Dave
Fairbank and Dean Anderson
sufficiently dampened the Bruin
hopes. Anderson edged out Bruin
Steve Austin by one-tenth of a
second, and Fairbank, who also
captured the 100 yard free, set
two meet and pool records with
his two wins. He currently is the
number-one 50 free man in the
college ranks following his blazing
20.6 clocking.
Mike Bruner's three wins
bolstered the Card attack, as the
freshman set three meet and two
pool records with his wins in the
1000-yard free, the 500 free, and
the 200-yard butterfly.
Card Coach Jim Gaughran had
stated earlier in the week that the
diving events would be crucial,
and sophomore Wayne Wager's
strong performance provided
Gaughran with the needed points.
Wager garnered a first in the
1-meter event, and second in the
3-meter.
John Hencken continued his
winning ways, setting a meet and
pool record in his 200 Individual
Medley win, and crushing UCLA's
Kip Virts in the 200-yard
breastroke. Freshman Stu Corliss
also had an outstanding day in the
200 IM and 200 breastroke.
