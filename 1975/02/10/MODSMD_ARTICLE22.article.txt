Compromise Possible On Asian Aid
WASHINGTON — Setting the stage for a possible
compromise, 82 congressmen asked President Ford
yesterday for a dialogue on phasing out all U.S. aid to
South Vietnam and Cambodia.
Ford said in an interview published yesterday by the
Chicago Tribune that he would be willing to halt present
large-scale U.S. aid to South Vietnam in three years if
Congress appropriates sufficient money during that time.
The 82 congressmen — 12 senators and 70 House
members — told Ford in a letter that the time has come for
a decision "as to how we will extricate ourselves from the
situation in Southeast Asia once and for all."
Meany Predicts 10% Unemployment
WASHINGTON — AFL-CIO President George Meany
predicted yesterday that unemployment will reach 10
percent by July and termed efforts to revive the economy
"a war to preserve our way of life."
Appearing on CBS's Face the Nation, Meany noted that
the President's Council of Economic Advisers predicted an
eight percent unemployment rate by July, but the rate is
already 8.2 percent. He said he now feels it will reach 10
percent by then.
Meany termed Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur
Burns "a national disaster" and called for six percent
mortgage money to be made available to help revive the
housing industry. He advocated increasing public service
jobs and public works grants, and prompt congressional
action on tax relief.
Hearing Requested On Arab Contract
WASHINGTON — Two senators called yesterday for
congressional investigation of a Defense Department
contract with a private firm to train Saudi Arabian troops
to guard oil wells in the Persian Gulf.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) said he would ask John
Stennis (D-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, to hold hearings on the matter. If for some
reason Stennis cannot, Jackson said, his own Investigations
Committee would convene hearings.
U.S. Families Evacuate Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — The families of American
diplomats have been told to prepare for departure this week
from this besieged capital city which is short of food, fuel
and ammunition, a U.S. official said yesterday.
Insurgent mines in the Mekong River shipping channel
from South Vietnam are preventing supply convoys from
reaching the capital. About 15 vessels have been sunk in a
week.
The source here said only about six wives of U.S.
officials were in the city and that they would leave on
regular flights during the week. More than 150 French
citizens also will fly out, and the Japanese Embassy plans to
evacuate families and nonessential staff.
Red C ross Airlifts Aid To Ethiopia
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The Red Cross flew five
tons of food and medicine to Asmara yesterday and said it
will conduct an inspection of living conditions in the
besieged provincial capital. Evacuees said the city's food

problem was becoming critical.
The Ethiopian government granted permission for the
chartered plane to take off after balking at requests from
foreign missions for a week, diplomatic sources said.
The young leftist military rulers of Ethiopia
acknowledge only a minor law-and-order problem in
Asmara and attribute it to "a few misguided bandits."
Sudan, however, dispatched its foreign minister, Gamal
Mohammed Ahmed, to Addis Ababa in an attempt to end
the fighting between the Ethiopian government and the
secessionist guerrillas ringing Asmara.
New IRA Cease-Fire Begins Tonight
BELFAST — The Irish Republican Army begins a new
cease-fire tonight. But fears that Protestant extremists
would sabotage it were heightened by a machine-gun
attack on a crowd of worshipers leaving a Roman Catholic
Church.
The IRA's Provisional wing announced it would suspend
its guerrilla war at 6 p.m.(10 a.m. PST).
No time limit for the cease-fire was set, but London
newspapers reported an IRA spokesman in Dublin warned:
"This is only a peace initiative. A permanent cease-fire is
still a long way off."
William Craig, leader of the extremist Protestant
Vanguard Movement, said the IRA's Catholic leaders were
probably trying "to gain credibility and win a breathing
space." He demanded the Catholic guerrillas "surrender of
their arms."
Two hours before the IRA announcement last night, two
gunmen opened fire on the crowd leaving 7 p.m. mass at St.
Bridget's Church in Belfast, killing two young men and
wounding a third, and then escaped in a car stolen in a
Protestant area at Belfast. Police blamed Protestant
extremists.
Eleven persons have now died since the IRA Provos
ended a Christmas truce on Jan. 16 after 25 days. The
official death toll from s'/2 years of violence in Northern
Ireland has risen to 1154.
Today's Weather
Variable clouds with chance of showers today and
tomorrow. A little cooler. Lows in mid 40s to low 50s.

newspapers reported an IRA spokesman in Dublin warned:
"This is only a peace initiative. A permanent cease-fire is
still a long way off."
William Craig, leader of the extremist Protestant
Vanguard Movement, said the IRA's Catholic leaders were
probably trying "to gain credibility and win a breathing
space." He demanded the Catholic guerrillas "surrender of
their arms."
Two hours before the IRA announcement last night, two
gunmen opened fire on the crowd leaving 7 p.m. mass at St.
Bridget's Church in Belfast, killing two young men and
wounding a third, and then escaped in a car stolen in a
Protestant area at Belfast. Police blamed Protestant
extremists.
Eleven persons have now died since the IRA Provos
ended a Christmas truce on Jan. 16 after 25 days. The
official death toll from s'/2 years of violence in Northern
Ireland has risen to 1154.

Compromise Possible On Asian Aid
WASHINGTON — Setting the stage for a possible
compromise, 82 congressmen asked President Ford
yesterday for a dialogue on phasing out all U.S. aid to
South Vietnam and Cambodia.
Ford said in an interview published yesterday by the
Chicago Tribune that he would be willing to halt present
large-scale U.S. aid to South Vietnam in three years if
Congress appropriates sufficient money during that time.
The 82 congressmen — 12 senators and 70 House
members — told Ford in a letter that the time has come for
a decision "as to how we will extricate ourselves from the
situation in Southeast Asia once and for all."
Meany Predicts 10% Unemployment
WASHINGTON — AFL-CIO President George Meany
predicted yesterday that unemployment will reach 10
percent by July and termed efforts to revive the economy
"a war to preserve our way of life."
Appearing on CBS's Face the Nation, Meany noted that
the President's Council of Economic Advisers predicted an
eight percent unemployment rate by July, but the rate is
already 8.2 percent. He said he now feels it will reach 10
percent by then.
Meany termed Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur
Burns "a national disaster" and called for six percent
mortgage money to be made available to help revive the
housing industry. He advocated increasing public service
jobs and public works grants, and prompt congressional
action on tax relief.
Hearing Requested On Arab Contract
WASHINGTON — Two senators called yesterday for
congressional investigation of a Defense Department
contract with a private firm to train Saudi Arabian troops
to guard oil wells in the Persian Gulf.
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) said he would ask John
Stennis (D-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, to hold hearings on the matter. If for some
reason Stennis cannot, Jackson said, his own Investigations
Committee would convene hearings.
U.S. Families Evacuate Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — The families of American
diplomats have been told to prepare for departure this week
from this besieged capital city which is short of food, fuel
and ammunition, a U.S. official said yesterday.
Insurgent mines in the Mekong River shipping channel
from South Vietnam are preventing supply convoys from
reaching the capital. About 15 vessels have been sunk in a
week.
The source here said only about six wives of U.S.
officials were in the city and that they would leave on
regular flights during the week. More than 150 French
citizens also will fly out, and the Japanese Embassy plans to
evacuate families and nonessential staff.
Red C ross Airlifts Aid To Ethiopia
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The Red Cross flew five
tons of food and medicine to Asmara yesterday and said it
will conduct an inspection of living conditions in the
besieged provincial capital. Evacuees said the city's food

problem was becoming critical.
The Ethiopian government granted permission for the
chartered plane to take off after balking at requests from
foreign missions for a week, diplomatic sources said.
The young leftist military rulers of Ethiopia
acknowledge only a minor law-and-order problem in
Asmara and attribute it to "a few misguided bandits."
Sudan, however, dispatched its foreign minister, Gamal
Mohammed Ahmed, to Addis Ababa in an attempt to end
the fighting between the Ethiopian government and the
secessionist guerrillas ringing Asmara.
New IRA Cease-Fire Begins Tonight
BELFAST — The Irish Republican Army begins a new
cease-fire tonight. But fears that Protestant extremists
would sabotage it were heightened by a machine-gun
attack on a crowd of worshipers leaving a Roman Catholic

its guerrilla war at 6 p.m.(10 a.m. PST).

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The Red Cross flew five
tons of food and medicine to Asmara yesterday and said it
will conduct an inspection of living conditions in the
besieged provincial capital. Evacuees said the city's food

problem was becoming critical.
The Ethiopian government granted permission for the
chartered plane to take off after balking at requests from
foreign missions for a week, diplomatic sources said.
The young leftist military rulers of Ethiopia
acknowledge only a minor law-and-order problem in
Asmara and attribute it to "a few misguided bandits."
Sudan, however, dispatched its foreign minister, Gamal
Mohammed Ahmed, to Addis Ababa in an attempt to end
the fighting between the Ethiopian government and the
secessionist guerrillas ringing Asmara.
New IRA Cease-Fire Begins Tonight
BELFAST — The Irish Republican Army begins a new
cease-fire tonight. But fears that Protestant extremists
would sabotage it were heightened by a machine-gun
attack on a crowd of worshipers leaving a Roman Catholic
Church.
The IRA's Provisional wing announced it would suspend
its guerrilla war at 6 p.m.(10 a.m. PST).
No time limit for the cease-fire was set, but London
newspapers reported an IRA spokesman in Dublin warned:
"This is only a peace initiative. A permanent cease-fire is
still a long way off."
William Craig, leader of the extremist Protestant
Vanguard Movement, said the IRA's Catholic leaders were
probably trying "to gain credibility and win a breathing
space." He demanded the Catholic guerrillas "surrender of
their arms."
Two hours before the IRA announcement last night, two
gunmen opened fire on the crowd leaving 7 p.m. mass at St.
Bridget's Church in Belfast, killing two young men and
wounding a third, and then escaped in a car stolen in a
Protestant area at Belfast. Police blamed Protestant
extremists.
Eleven persons have now died since the IRA Provos
ended a Christmas truce on Jan. 16 after 25 days. The
official death toll from s'/2 years of violence in Northern
Ireland has risen to 1154.
