FLO MO CONSTRUCTION—Rubin Griego and Linda Bernhard sift through
rubble left by work crews as preliminary construction began last week at
Florence Moore Hall. Both residents of Flo Mo, Griego and Bernhard said that
noise was already disrupting some normal activities around the Hall and that a
water main had been hit, shutting off water for two hours. The construction will
add space for 100 students to the complex.
