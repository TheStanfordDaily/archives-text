# Classics Dept. 'In Shambles'
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS First of Two Parts 
The Classics Department is in a
shambles after the University's
Appointments and Promotions (A&P)
Committee denied tenure last year to
three instructors, according to some
instructors and graduate students in
the department.
Prof. Mark Edwards last fall
resigned in protest as department
chairman, and a noted Yale classicist
broke off plans to come to Stanford
after learning of the committee's
decision.
The committee's action, together
with the death last spring of renowned
Classics Prof. Thomas B. Webster and
the retirement of Prof. Lionel Pearson,
has left the department painfully short
of faculty.
But most students and faculty
members in the department insist that
the University is cooperating with
attempts to recruit new taculty. They
deny that the University's
budget-cutting efforts prompted the
A&P Committee to deny tenure to the
three instructors — Ronald Mellor,
William Berg and John D. Moore.

"I have never heard any suggestion
that the basic size of the Classics
Department will be cut," Edwards said
last week. "I never felt that the A&P
Committee's decision had anything to
do with the University's financial
problems."
A&P 'Ignorance'
Edwards attributed the decision to
ignorance by the committee of what
constitutes a distinguished classics
scholar.
Classicists usually must spend more
time on the work they publish than
most scholars in the social and natural
sciences, according to several persons in
the Classics Department.
John Moore, now teaching at
Boston University, claimed that "the
University expected a level of
performance difficult to obtain."
'All Respected'
Edwards insisted that all three
professors denied tenure are highly
respected in their field and deserved
tenure.
"I don't think that the A&P
Committee realized what it was doing
when it denied those men tenure,"
Edwards said. "We have lost some

good people."
He said he resigned as department
chairman because he did not "want to
take responsibility for what was
happening in the department — the
failure to promote so many promising
young men."
Show Disapproval
"I wanted to show how much I
disapproved of the A&P Committee's
overriding the wishes of the
department."
Edwards noted that it was the
combination of the three decisions
rather than any one that brought on his
resignation as chairman.
"The rejection of all three was
unjustifiable," Edwards said. "The
department was much too savagely
handled. The administration should
not have overruled us when we had
taken such a strong stand. The
decisions were not only unfair to
individuals, but the department itself
was severely injured."
Word Gets Around
Edwards called classics a small field
in which "everyone knows what goes
on at other universities. Word gets
around if things are badly handled by
an administration. It becomes a source
of gossip."
Ronald Mellor, one of the three
professors denied tenure, claimed that
"the situation at Stanford is well
known." For example, Moses Findlay,
the distinguished Cambridge classicist,
recently expressed amazement at the
A&P Committee's decisions, Mellor
said.
In the most recent national survey
of American classics departments,
Stanford's ranked fourth. But many in
the department agree that the dearth
of faculty has caused the department's
prestige to cascade downward.
'In Ruins'
"The department will be in ruins
until it makes some decent
appointments," according to William
Berg, who was denied tenure last
spring. "The real victims are the
graduate students. They came to a
respectable department and now they
are left holding the bag."
