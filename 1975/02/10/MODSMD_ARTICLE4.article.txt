# Classics Dept. 'In Shambles'
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS First of Two Parts 
The Classics Department is in a
shambles after the University's
Appointments and Promotions (A&P)
Committee denied tenure last year to
three instructors, according to some
instructors and graduate students in
the department.
Prof. Mark Edwards last fall
resigned in protest as department
chairman, and a noted Yale classicist
broke off plans to come to Stanford
after learning of the committee's
decision.
The committee's action, together
with the death last spring of renowned
Classics Prof. Thomas B. Webster and
the retirement of Prof. Lionel Pearson,
has left the department painfully short
of faculty.
But most students and faculty
members in the department insist that
the University is cooperating with
attempts to recruit new taculty. They
deny that the University's
budget-cutting efforts prompted the
A&P Committee to deny tenure to the
three instructors — Ronald Mellor,
William Berg and John D. Moore.

"I have never heard any suggestion
that the basic size of the Classics
Department will be cut," Edwards said
last week. "I never felt that the A&P
Committee's decision had anything to
do with the University's financial
problems."
A&P 'Ignorance'
Edwards attributed the decision to
ignorance by the committee of what
constitutes a distinguished classics
scholar.
Classicists usually must spend more
time on the work they publish than
most scholars in the social and natural
sciences, according to several persons in
the Classics Department.
John Moore, now teaching at
Boston University, claimed that "the
University expected a level of
performance difficult to obtain."
'All Respected'
Edwards insisted that all three
professors denied tenure are highly
respected in their field and deserved
tenure.
"I don't think that the A&P
Committee realized what it was doing
when it denied those men tenure,"
Edwards said. "We have lost some

good people."
He said he resigned as department
chairman because he did not "want to
take responsibility for what was
happening in the department — the
failure to promote so many promising
young men."
Show Disapproval
"I wanted to show how much I
disapproved of the A&P Committee's
overriding the wishes of the
department."
Edwards noted that it was the
combination of the three decisions
rather than any one that brought on his
resignation as chairman.
"The rejection of all three was
unjustifiable," Edwards said. "The
department was much too savagely
handled. The administration should
not have overruled us when we had
taken such a strong stand. The
decisions were not only unfair to
individuals, but the department itself
was severely injured."
Word Gets Around
Edwards called classics a small field
in which "everyone knows what goes
on at other universities. Word gets
around if things are badly handled by
an administration. It becomes a source
of gossip."
Ronald Mellor, one of the three
professors denied tenure, claimed that
"the situation at Stanford is well
known." For example, Moses Findlay,
the distinguished Cambridge classicist,
recently expressed amazement at the
A&P Committee's decisions, Mellor
said.
In the most recent national survey
of American classics departments,
Stanford's ranked fourth. But many in
the department agree that the dearth
of faculty has caused the department's
prestige to cascade downward.
'In Ruins'
"The department will be in ruins
until it makes some decent
appointments," according to William
Berg, who was denied tenure last
spring. "The real victims are the
graduate students. They came to a
respectable department and now they
are left holding the bag."
Bella Zweig, a graduate student,
agreed that "prestige is going to rock
bottom." But she added that morale is
still high.
Zweig noted, however, that
students were particularly
disappointed that Yale Classics Prof.
C. John Harrington recently decided
not to return to Stanford, where he
taught until 1972.
'Hopping Mad'
Contacted by the Daily last week,
Harrington said that he was "hopping
mad" by the decision to deny Mellor
tenure. Harrington said he had agreed
to accept the chairmanship of the
department but turned it down after
he learned of the Mellor decision.
"It was a messy situation,"
Harrington said. "I can't talk about it
without losing my temper."
But Harrington contended that the
Mellor decision alone didn't convince

him not to return here.
"I had a policy I wanted to carry
through — lining up classics with other
departments. It became clear to me
that there was a difference in
philosophy between me and the
department."
Appointments Opposed
Harrington added that he also
encountered opposition toward some
of the appointments he had proposed.
But Harrington emphasized that he
didn't think that the department's
prestige had declined, noting that it
should have no trouble filling its
vacancies with highly distinguished
scholars.
"Appointments to Stanford are still
among the most desirable in the
profession," Harrington said. "Anyone
with sense would take a job there with
pleasure."
Vacancy Problems
However, Moore told the Dail" that
he believes that the confusion created
by denial of tenure to himself, Berg
and Mellor will make it hard for the
department to fill its vacancies. Several
graduate students agreed with him.
But Prof. Anthony Raubitschek,
acting chairman of the department,
claimed that vacancies are always hard
to fill simply because most scholars are
satisfied with their current jobs and
because there are so few classicists of
the caliber desired by Stanford.
Raubitschek added that the denials
of tenure are "not in any way
scandalous. I don't think we have
problems in the department."
Edwards expressed a long-term
optimism.
"I have no doubts whatever about
the long-range future of the
department. Our graduate programs
continue to be successful. The trouble
is simply over the firings."
