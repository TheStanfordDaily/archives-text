# Gibbs Memo Suggests 'Better' Minority Mix
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs, in a memo written last
November, supported a proposal
cutting special financial aid to
minority students because it "bases
financial aid on a student's monetary
needs rather than Ion) his or her
ethnicity."
Gibbs wrote that the aid cut would
draw minority students "more attuned
to the intellectual goals that we
espouse and to the elitist nature" of
Stanford and is "likely to bring us a
different (and i think better) mix of
minority students ... who have
chosen Stanford because of its ethos
rather than in spite of it."
The memo, uncovered by Live Oak,
also claims that "many" -Stanford
minority "students spend too much
time trying to 'turn the institution
around' rather than availing themselves
of much that it has to offer."
Gibbs' memo was sent to Director
of Financial Aids Robert Huff last
Nov. 13 in response to a discussion
paper on the minority aid issue
prepared by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and

Financial Aid (CUAFA).
Gibbs refused to speak to reporters
Friday as he prepared to leave for the
University's Board of Trustees meeting
in Los Angeles today. Contacted there
yesterday, he said he would not
comment on the memo until the final
CUAFA proposal was released.
He said the story that appeared in
Live Oak was "incomplete and out of
context."
Equal Treatment
Early last month, a proposal which
called for equal treatment of all
financial aid applicants regardless of
race was disclosed.
Drafted by Huff, CUAFA Chairman
Paul Green (a professor of biology)
and Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, the report recommended
that all students from low income
families seeking financial aid be
expected to provide $700 in self-help,
either through loans or assigned
campus jobs during their freshmen
year. Black, native American and
chicano students are exempt from this
current requirement, with their total
freshman-year need met by
scholarships and grants.
Minority students here have
criticized the proposed aid cut for
numerous reasons, including lack of
minority student input and
insufficient evidence to support claims
that circumstances here have changed
to warrant the new policy.
Decision Differs
Green said Friday that CUAFA has
come to a final decision on the issue
which "differs significantly from the
published proposal." He would not
elaborate, but said the decision would
be released today or tomorrow,
following final review by committee
members. It will be presented to the
Faculty Senate at its next meeting.
David Asai, a student member of
CUAFA, agreed that the final proposal
was "significantly different" from its
earlier public form.
He also disclosed that Gibbs wrote
an additional memo to the committee
last week which said that any new plan
"must guarantee that we [Stanford]
do not lose any minority students no
matter what we do." Gibbs confirmed
this yesterday.

In Gibbs' November memo, he
noted a "danger" of "an initial drop in
acceptance by minority students
admitted." By efforts "to increase the
yield from minority admittees" or by
admitting more minority students to
preserve the present yield "if the
quality of the applicant pool permits,"
the University could compensate for
this drop, Gibbs wrote.
Apparently, though, Gibbs'
November memo did not support the
publicized aid proposal, but instead a
compromise between it and the
current system.
In his memo, Gibbs stated that he
found packaging policy number three
to be the best. It advocated "some
self-help expectation for economically
disadvantaged students without regard
to race but less than the | $700 ]
standard," according to the memo.
Change Unacceptable
Elena Robles, senior house
associate at Zapata, the chicano
theme house, said any change from the
present plan would be unacceptable to
minority students.
She said she has known some
students who required extra study just
to reach the beginning level of certain
classes and who thus could not survive
academically if required to work
during the academic term.
Robles also noted that minority
students graduating from college still
receive lower-paying jobs than whites
with the same education, which would
tend to burden minorities more when
paying back loans.
Memo Circulated
Though a surprise to many when it
was exposed in Live Oak Friday,
