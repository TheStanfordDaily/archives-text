# Law School Profs Laud New Attorney General
## 
### PAM WOODS 
Members of the Law School faculty
have expressed approval of Edward H.
Levi, sworn in last week as the nation's
71st attorney general.
Some were enthusiastic about
President Ford's first cabinet
appointee. Prof. John Kaplan called
the appointment "absolutely
first-rate."
Prof. Gerald Gunther and Assoc.
Prof. Paul Brest also were impressed
by Ford's choice.
Gunther, who called the
appointment "splendid," was pleased
that Ford had not nominated a
political figure to fill the cabinet post.
Levi is a well-known legal scholar and
was president of the University of
Chicago.
"It's good to have a professional
lawyer and an independent man [as
attorney general]" he said. "We have
had too many second-raters and
political hacks."

Gunther stated that Levi's
independence and objectivity made
him an "excellent and healthy choice"
for the position "whether or not you
agree with his political views."
Brest agreed that the nomination of
Levi was "a surprisingly good one for
Ford to make. He is certainly better
than most people one would expect
Ford to appoint."
Brest added that Levi is a "tough
but reasonable administrator and an
extremely bright man."
Kaplan also commented on Levi's
intelligence. "In American history, we
have not had a handful of smarter
cabinet appointees." he said.
President Ford nominated Levi to
the cabinet post after former Attorney
General William B. Saxbe was named
ambassador to India. After his
approval by the Senate, Levi was
sworn in Friday in a ceremony at the
White House.
