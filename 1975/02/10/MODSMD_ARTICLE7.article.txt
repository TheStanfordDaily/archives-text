# Women's Group Demands Campus Safety Measures
## 
### RIV WEBER KIM NYEGAARD 
Meeting with a group of University
administrators Friday, a committee of
graduate women repeated its demands
for a "corridor of light" for night
bicyclists and a night minibus service
to increase safety on campus.
The proposals, which emanated
from the group's Jan. 17 meeting,
were presented to University Master
Planner Oscar Nelson, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape and Santa
Clara County Sheriff Lt. Walter Konar.
The ASSU Senate has endorsed the
committee's proposals.
The women stated Friday that
campus safety was a "necessity."
Discussing the safety of bicycle
riders with Nelson, the committee's
chairwoman, Gloria Guth, noted the
need for "more and brighter lighting

along the bike paths."
Members of the committee attested
to the success of "corridors of light"
created at Berkeley. With one or two
police-protected corridors "lit up like
daylight," and with the subsequent
increase in number of riders, much of
the current peril of riding around
campus at night would be alleviated,
the women said.
Guth's group disagreed strongly
with Nelson's contention that a row of
mercury vapor lights installed along
Palm Drive in 1968 was sufficient. The
women pointed out that although the
University has allotted $600,000 for
lighting in the last six years, safety at
night continues to be a problem.
If all riders used the same main
routes, safety would be increased, they
contended. In order to determine the
most desired routes, Lyons has agreed
to conduct a survey during the next
pre-registration.
Snape discussed the committee's
proposal to use the University's
daytime tour buses as night minibuses
— a service Guth called a "necessity."
For $15,000 a year, Snape said,
such a service could include one
minibus with a radio dispatcher,
running five nights a week until 12:30
the next morning. The bus would
make one large loop of campus,
deviating from the route to answer
individual calls.
The committee expressed a
perference for a bus with an
established single route and no radio.
One suggested route would encircle
Escondidio Village, the dorms, the
physics tank and the Quad.
Snape indicated he will propose a
minibus service to be run for a trial
period during the first month of the
spring quarter. Success of the trial will
be determined by questionnaires and
usage of the service.
The women's group also asked an
end to alleged exhibitionism by men in
the Main Library stacks. The women
charged that library staffers know who
the culprits are, but refuse to bar them
from the stacks.

Snape indicated he will propose a
minibus service to be run for a trial
period during the first month of the
spring quarter. Success of the trial will
be determined by questionnaires and
usage of the service.
The women's group also asked an
end to alleged exhibitionism by men in
the Main Library stacks. The women
charged that library staffers know who
the culprits are, but refuse to bar them
from the stacks.
Meeting with a group of University
administrators Friday, a committee of
graduate women repeated its demands
for a "corridor of light" for night
bicyclists and a night minibus service
to increase safety on campus.
The proposals, which emanated
from the group's Jan. 17 meeting,
were presented to University Master
Planner Oscar Nelson, Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons, Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape and Santa
Clara County Sheriff Lt. Walter Konar.
The ASSU Senate has endorsed the
committee's proposals.
The women stated Friday that
campus safety was a "necessity."
Discussing the safety of bicycle
riders with Nelson, the committee's
chairwoman, Gloria Guth, noted the
need for "more and brighter lighting

along the bike paths."
Members of the committee attested
to the success of "corridors of light"
created at Berkeley. With one or two
police-protected corridors "lit up like
daylight," and with the subsequent
increase in number of riders, much of
the current peril of riding around
campus at night would be alleviated,
the women said.
Guth's group disagreed strongly
with Nelson's contention that a row of
mercury vapor lights installed along
Palm Drive in 1968 was sufficient. The
women pointed out that although the
University has allotted $600,000 for
lighting in the last six years, safety at
night continues to be a problem.
If all riders used the same main
routes, safety would be increased, they
contended. In order to determine the
most desired routes, Lyons has agreed
to conduct a survey during the next
pre-registration.
Snape discussed the committee's
proposal to use the University's
daytime tour buses as night minibuses
— a service Guth called a "necessity."
For $15,000 a year, Snape said,
such a service could include one
minibus with a radio dispatcher,
running five nights a week until 12:30
the next morning. The bus would
make one large loop of campus,
deviating from the route to answer
individual calls.
The committee expressed a
perference for a bus with an
established single route and no radio.
One suggested route would encircle
Escondidio Village, the dorms, the
physics tank and the Quad.
