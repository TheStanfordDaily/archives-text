## Opinions editorial Gibbs' Memo 
### 
. A memo written by Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs regarding the packaging of financial aid to
jninority students has recently come to light. In the memo,
Gibbs attempts to justify his belief that financial need be
J?ased on "a student's monetary needs rather than his or her
£thnicity."
• We agree with this conclusion, and reiterate our support
of a financial aid policy based solely on need. We disagree,
however, with some of Gibbs' arguments.
Gibbs says that the consequence of the present policy of
giving minority students more favorable financial aid terms
than other students is to encourage minority students to
come to Stanford "solely because of the more favorable
financial aid plan."
- He argues that this is bad, because many of these
particularly disadvantaged students "spend too much time
trying to turn the institution around rather than availing
themselves of much that it has to offer."
The result of the new aid policy, Gibbs argues, will be to
draw minority students "who are more attuned to the
intellectual goals we espouse and to the elitist nature of the
institution."
Though Gibbs' memo does not represent an official
policy, we think it is dangerous to use a financial aids policy
to encourage certain applicants who fit a given mold to
apply while discouraging others who do not represent
Stanford's preconceived image.
We believe Stanford should encourage applications by
students with diversified backgrounds and interests. Gibbs'
statements tend to produce the opposite effect.
We think Stanford should be dedicated to an educational
process that welcomes diverse views — and not one
dedicated to perpetuating its status quo.
