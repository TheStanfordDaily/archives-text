# On SWOPSI Feud
## James Gibbs 
### 
James Lobsenz'column (Daily,
Feb. 6) contains one serious
factual error and two questionable
interpretations.
SWOPSI is not a "special joint
agency." The essence of the
situation is summarized in a
report to the Senate by the
Chairman of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US)
dated Jan. 5, 1973 and approved
by the Senate on Jan. 11, 1973.
The relevant language:
"After a great deal of
discussion during 1971-72 and the
present academic year, the
Committee has come to the
Opinion that the agencies should
be answerable only to the Dean.
Formulation of policy remains
with C-US ..
This legislation gives the Dean
unambiguous administrative
responsibility for SWOPSI. I did
not need to propose a further
reorganization of the
extra-departmental programs to
accomplish this result. It exists
now. Lobsenz' factual error leads
him to making an incorrect
deduction about the ends I have
in mind.
Lobsenz is correct in stating
that SWOPSI and I often have
disagreed about the best way to
insure that SWOPSI workshops
are of adequate academic caliber.
We also have disagreed about what
organizational arrangements are
most suitable to insure both
appropriate monitoring of
SWOPSI's academic offerings and
simple administrative efficiency.
I had that history in mind
when I responded to Wayne
Sachs' hypothetical question
about an ASSU-funded SWOPSI

at my meeting last month with
students at the Round Room. I
pointed out to him that such
funding would not end the
tension concerning the fact that
meeting academic standards places
some constraints on what SWOPSI
can do in its workshops.
I also asked "If you are going
to place yourselves on
non-University funding, why
don't you go the whole way
towards autonomy and give
workshops without credit?" I
added that having to deal with the
complexities of ASSU politics as
well as the continual controversy
about appropriate criteria for
accreditation would be more than
I would want to try to cope with.
I think most objective
observers would agree that it is an
obvious misconstruction to
interpret those comments as
saying that I am not (or would
not be) in favor of any SWOPSI
workshops receiving University
credit.
Lobsenz is right when he
observes that I have not raised the
accreditability of SWOPSI
workshops as a concern in the
recent discussions. I do not
consider it to be an issue.
The core issue at hand is not
the academic quality of SWOPSI.
It is what size staff should be
devoted to the extra-departmental
programs in a time of fiscal
stringency? What organizational
arrangements make most effective
use of that necessarily limited
staff? And what number of
offerings does that size staff
imply?
(James Gibbs is dean of
undergraduate studies.)
