Scotty Orens Dies
Heads for Big Turkey shoot in sky.
Obituary-Scooters on aging pre-meds
died early today when a .45 caliber
slug shattered his back as he passed
the Physics Tank. Death gripped his
face as he shouted, "Shoot them all."
The funeral will be in Goodaleiara
where his body will be noticed to a
local Med. School. Scotty is survived
by the wimps of the world.
HB—Scotty.
