# Three Profs Denied Tenure
## The 						'Classics Mistake'? 
### WILLIAM ROSS Last of Two Parts 
All three former Classics
Department assistant professors denied
tenure last year agree that the
University's Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee's
decisions on their fate at Stanford
were made under highly unusual
circumstances.
Former Asst. Profs. Ronald Mellor,
John D. Moore and William Berg all
insist that the Committee unfairly
neglected to evaluate their scholarship
in its proper perspective.
They are supported in their
argument by Classics Prof. Mark
Edwards, who resigned as department
chairman last fall to protest the
decisions and Yale Prof. C. John
Harrington, who broke off plans to
accept an appointment here after
learning of the Committee's actions.
Mellor called the events
surrounding his denial of tenure
"bizarre."
Mellor said he was surprised that
the University made no attempt to
replace A&P Committee member
Martin Evans, who disqualified himself
because Mellor's wife was a colleague
of his in the English Department.
Analysis 'Ludicrous'
Mellor also claimed that another
member, Spanish Prof. Jean Franco,
misunderstood his one book, a work
about the cult of the goddess Roma.
According to Mellor, Franco
examined his book from an
anthropological viewpoint.
"Her analysis was ludicrous from a
professional point of view," Mellor
said.
He also claimed that Franco gave
"negative weight" to his service to the
University, especially his five-year stint
as house associate at Stern Hall.
Mellor added that he was disturbed
by what he called the "fantastically
indiscreet" behavior of Mathematics
Prof. Paul Cohen, who discussed
Mellor's case at a private party with
Rachael Kitzinger, a graduate student
in classics who now teaches at
Amherst.
Decision Upheld
Although Cohen made the remarks
after the Committee had voted on
Mellor's tenure, Kitzinger was upset
enough about Cohen's action to write
a letter of protest to Provost William
Miller, who was then hearing Mellor's
case on appeal.
Miller later referred the matter to
President Richard Lyman, who sent it
to the Advisory Board, which upheld
the Committee's original decision.
Mellor said that while there has
been some speculation that Kitzinger's
letter caused the issue to be sent to the
Advisory Board rather than to the
Provost, he believes that the issue

would probably have been referred to
the Board anyway.
While Mellor denied that Cohen's
actions had in any way hurt or helped
his chances of receiving tenure, he said
he was upset that Cohen was so
indiscreet.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Halsey Royden admitted that
"unfortunately, Cohen did discuss the
case outside of the Committee."
Cohen Criticized
But Royden added that "in my
opinion, this was not a factor in the
decision to hear the appeal of the
case."
Harrington, contacted at Yale by
the Daily, said he had heard about
Cohen's remarks at the party and
decried what he called Cohen's
"scandalous negligence."
Cohen said that his own actions
were "very stupid," adding that "I was
drinking" at the time.
But Cohen emphasized that he took
his job on the committee seriously and
does not believe that his private
remarks at the party after the decision
had already been made could possibly

have been injurious to Mellor.
Cohen said he couldn't understand
why Kitzinger had made an issue out
of the matter.
'Difficult To Publish'
Mellor, 33, went on to claim that
both the Advisory Board and the
Committee didn't understand that in
classics, it is difficult for a young
scholar to publish much material.
Berg, now drawing unemployment
insurance, agreed with Mellor. Berg
claimed that by the standards of his
profession he has published a great
deal.
He noted that his book, Early
Virgil, was published last year by the
University of London Press and that
he has nlso published several articles in
scholarly journals.
Berg said that the issue of his
tenure came before the University
administration twice.
The first time, in 1973, the matter
was presented to Prof. Claude
Simpson, then associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
Berg said Simpson denied him tenure

without even consulting the A&P
Committee.
Case Reopened
"I never was able to get a straight
answer on why he ruled against me,"
Berg said. "And I was told that there
was no necessity to consult the A&P
Committee."
But when Royden became dean
later that year, he decided that all
tenure cases should come before the
Committee. Berg's case was therefore
reopened.
The Committee, however, voted
against Berg, providing only two
sentences of explanation for its action,
according to Berg.
Berg appealed the decision to
Miller, who in turn referred it to
Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost for
faculty affairs. Bienenstock upheld the
Committee's action.
"He said the outside references on
my published works contained much
praise but also much criticism," Berg
said. Berg added that this analysis
conflicted with Edwards' claim that

the references were overwhelmingly
favorable.
Berg, who, consistent with general
policy, was not permitted to see his
recommendations, claimed that "the
gaps in my information were used to
justify my being fired."
incomprehensible'
Berg said he finds the University's
action incomprehensible, but suspects
that the Administration may be trying
to pare down the size of the Classics
Department.
Moore emphasized that financial
considerations seem to have played no
role in his own dismissal, but agreed
with Berg and Mellor that the
University fails to understand the
scholarly standards of the classics
profession.
Moore called the A&P Committee's
judgments "short-sighted" and said it
expects classics professors to achieve
"a level that is difficult to attain."
Now at Boston University, Moore
said that Royden has "higher
expectations than were reasonable."
Moore has published no book, but

he has had several articles published in
scholarly journals.
Royden insisted that all three men
were rejected solely on the basis of
their academic credentials and that he
was confident that the Classics
Department can find more
distinguished replacements for the
professors who were denied tenure.

judgments "short-sighted" and said it
expects classics professors to achieve
"a level that is difficult to attain."
Now at Boston University, Moore
said that Royden has "higher
expectations than were reasonable."
Moore has published no book, but

he has had several articles published in
scholarly journals.
Royden insisted that all three men
were rejected solely on the basis of
their academic credentials and that he
was confident that the Classics
Department can find more
distinguished replacements for the
professors who were denied tenure.
All three former Classics
Department assistant professors denied
tenure last year agree that the
University's Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee's
decisions on their fate at Stanford
were made under highly unusual
circumstances.
Former Asst. Profs. Ronald Mellor,
John D. Moore and William Berg all
insist that the Committee unfairly
neglected to evaluate their scholarship
in its proper perspective.
They are supported in their
argument by Classics Prof. Mark
Edwards, who resigned as department
chairman last fall to protest the
decisions and Yale Prof. C. John
Harrington, who broke off plans to
accept an appointment here after
learning of the Committee's actions.
Mellor called the events
surrounding his denial of tenure
"bizarre."
Mellor said he was surprised that
the University made no attempt to
replace A&P Committee member
Martin Evans, who disqualified himself
because Mellor's wife was a colleague
of his in the English Department.
Analysis 'Ludicrous'
Mellor also claimed that another
member, Spanish Prof. Jean Franco,
misunderstood his one book, a work
about the cult of the goddess Roma.
According to Mellor, Franco
examined his book from an
anthropological viewpoint.
"Her analysis was ludicrous from a
professional point of view," Mellor
said.
He also claimed that Franco gave
"negative weight" to his service to the
University, especially his five-year stint
as house associate at Stern Hall.
Mellor added that he was disturbed
by what he called the "fantastically
indiscreet" behavior of Mathematics
Prof. Paul Cohen, who discussed
Mellor's case at a private party with
Rachael Kitzinger, a graduate student
in classics who now teaches at
Amherst.
Decision Upheld
Although Cohen made the remarks
after the Committee had voted on
Mellor's tenure, Kitzinger was upset
enough about Cohen's action to write
a letter of protest to Provost William
Miller, who was then hearing Mellor's
case on appeal.
Miller later referred the matter to
President Richard Lyman, who sent it
to the Advisory Board, which upheld
the Committee's original decision.
Mellor said that while there has
been some speculation that Kitzinger's
letter caused the issue to be sent to the
Advisory Board rather than to the
Provost, he believes that the issue

would probably have been referred to
the Board anyway.
While Mellor denied that Cohen's
actions had in any way hurt or helped
his chances of receiving tenure, he said
he was upset that Cohen was so
indiscreet.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Halsey Royden admitted that
"unfortunately, Cohen did discuss the
case outside of the Committee."
Cohen Criticized
But Royden added that "in my
opinion, this was not a factor in the
decision to hear the appeal of the
case."
Harrington, contacted at Yale by
the Daily, said he had heard about
Cohen's remarks at the party and
decried what he called Cohen's
"scandalous negligence."
Cohen said that his own actions
were "very stupid," adding that "I was
drinking" at the time.
But Cohen emphasized that he took
his job on the committee seriously and
does not believe that his private
remarks at the party after the decision
had already been made could possibly

have been injurious to Mellor.
Cohen said he couldn't understand
why Kitzinger had made an issue out
of the matter.
'Difficult To Publish'
Mellor, 33, went on to claim that
both the Advisory Board and the
Committee didn't understand that in
classics, it is difficult for a young
scholar to publish much material.
Berg, now drawing unemployment
insurance, agreed with Mellor. Berg
claimed that by the standards of his
profession he has published a great
deal.
He noted that his book, Early
Virgil, was published last year by the
University of London Press and that
he has nlso published several articles in
scholarly journals.
Berg said that the issue of his
tenure came before the University
administration twice.
The first time, in 1973, the matter
was presented to Prof. Claude
Simpson, then associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
Berg said Simpson denied him tenure

Committee's action.

said. Berg added that this analysis
conflicted with Edwards' claim that

the references were overwhelmingly
favorable.
Berg, who, consistent with general
policy, was not permitted to see his
recommendations, claimed that "the

Berg said he finds the University's
action incomprehensible, but suspects
that the Administration may be trying

with Berg and Mellor that the
University fails to understand the
scholarly standards of the classics
profession.

incomprehensible'
Berg said he finds the University's
action incomprehensible, but suspects
that the Administration may be trying
to pare down the size of the Classics
Department.
Moore emphasized that financial
considerations seem to have played no
role in his own dismissal, but agreed
with Berg and Mellor that the
University fails to understand the
scholarly standards of the classics
profession.
Moore called the A&P Committee's
judgments "short-sighted" and said it
expects classics professors to achieve
"a level that is difficult to attain."
Now at Boston University, Moore
said that Royden has "higher
expectations than were reasonable."
Moore has published no book, but

he has had several articles published in
scholarly journals.
Royden insisted that all three men
were rejected solely on the basis of
their academic credentials and that he
was confident that the Classics
Department can find more
distinguished replacements for the
professors who were denied tenure.
All three former Classics
Department assistant professors denied
tenure last year agree that the
University's Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee's
decisions on their fate at Stanford
were made under highly unusual
circumstances.
Former Asst. Profs. Ronald Mellor,
John D. Moore and William Berg all
insist that the Committee unfairly
neglected to evaluate their scholarship
in its proper perspective.
They are supported in their
argument by Classics Prof. Mark
Edwards, who resigned as department
chairman last fall to protest the
decisions and Yale Prof. C. John
Harrington, who broke off plans to
accept an appointment here after
learning of the Committee's actions.
Mellor called the events
surrounding his denial of tenure
"bizarre."
Mellor said he was surprised that
the University made no attempt to
replace A&P Committee member
Martin Evans, who disqualified himself
because Mellor's wife was a colleague
of his in the English Department.
Analysis 'Ludicrous'
Mellor also claimed that another
member, Spanish Prof. Jean Franco,
misunderstood his one book, a work
about the cult of the goddess Roma.
According to Mellor, Franco
examined his book from an
anthropological viewpoint.
"Her analysis was ludicrous from a
professional point of view," Mellor
said.
He also claimed that Franco gave
"negative weight" to his service to the
University, especially his five-year stint
as house associate at Stern Hall.
Mellor added that he was disturbed
by what he called the "fantastically
indiscreet" behavior of Mathematics
Prof. Paul Cohen, who discussed
Mellor's case at a private party with
Rachael Kitzinger, a graduate student
in classics who now teaches at
Amherst.
Decision Upheld
Although Cohen made the remarks
after the Committee had voted on
Mellor's tenure, Kitzinger was upset
enough about Cohen's action to write
a letter of protest to Provost William
Miller, who was then hearing Mellor's
case on appeal.
Miller later referred the matter to
President Richard Lyman, who sent it
to the Advisory Board, which upheld
the Committee's original decision.
Mellor said that while there has
been some speculation that Kitzinger's
letter caused the issue to be sent to the
Advisory Board rather than to the
Provost, he believes that the issue

would probably have been referred to
the Board anyway.
While Mellor denied that Cohen's
actions had in any way hurt or helped
his chances of receiving tenure, he said
he was upset that Cohen was so
indiscreet.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Halsey Royden admitted that
"unfortunately, Cohen did discuss the
case outside of the Committee."
Cohen Criticized
But Royden added that "in my
opinion, this was not a factor in the
decision to hear the appeal of the
case."
Harrington, contacted at Yale by
the Daily, said he had heard about
Cohen's remarks at the party and
decried what he called Cohen's
"scandalous negligence."
Cohen said that his own actions
were "very stupid," adding that "I was
drinking" at the time.
But Cohen emphasized that he took
his job on the committee seriously and
does not believe that his private
remarks at the party after the decision
had already been made could possibly

have been injurious to Mellor.
Cohen said he couldn't understand
why Kitzinger had made an issue out
of the matter.
'Difficult To Publish'
Mellor, 33, went on to claim that
both the Advisory Board and the
Committee didn't understand that in
classics, it is difficult for a young
scholar to publish much material.
Berg, now drawing unemployment
insurance, agreed with Mellor. Berg
claimed that by the standards of his
profession he has published a great
deal.
He noted that his book, Early
Virgil, was published last year by the
University of London Press and that
he has nlso published several articles in
scholarly journals.
Berg said that the issue of his
tenure came before the University
administration twice.
The first time, in 1973, the matter
was presented to Prof. Claude
Simpson, then associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
Berg said Simpson denied him tenure

"I never was able to get a straight
answer on why he ruled against me,"
Berg said. "And I was told that there
was no necessity to consult the A&P

But when Royden became dean
later that year, he decided that all

The Committee, however, voted

sentences of explanation for its action,
according to Berg.
Berg appealed the decision to
Miller, who in turn referred it to
Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost for
faculty affairs. Bienenstock upheld the
Committee's action.
"He said the outside references on
my published works contained much
praise but also much criticism," Berg
said. Berg added that this analysis
conflicted with Edwards' claim that

the references were overwhelmingly
favorable.
Berg, who, consistent with general
policy, was not permitted to see his
recommendations, claimed that "the
gaps in my information were used to
justify my being fired."
