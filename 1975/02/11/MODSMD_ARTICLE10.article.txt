# Panel Proposal Won't Solve Problem
## 
### 
The Ad Hoc Panel on the Grading
System cites grade inflation and the
current financial stress of the
University as major justifications for
its proposal to re-establish a drop
deadline." d the NC (no credit) grade.
The majority of the committee argues
that grades are no longer a meaningful
mea>ure of ability.
This is refuted completely, as the
minority points out, by the fact that
grades are high because the professors
give high marks. It is important to
consider that these high grades will not
be lowered by the committee
proposal. Instead, what is necessary is
a change in the attitude of individual
professors in regard to grading.
Besides grade inflation, a second
problem with the current grading
system is that it is economically
inefficient. For example, a class might
start out with five TAs but by finals
time, only three TAs are actually
needed because of the number of
students that have dropped that class.
Although the committee has
located this problem of inefficiency, it
is clear that its proposal will not
solve it. The suggested seven week
drop deadline will not save any money
because by that time, fixed costs will
have already been incurred.
Change Tuition System
One of the possible alternatives is
to change the way tuition is charged.
One specific proposal would be to
charge a flat fee for attending Stanford
with a 12 unit course load. There
would then be an additional cost for
each extra unit taken. With any class
dropped prior to a drop deadline, this
additional fee could be refunded.
After the deadline, though a student
could still drop a class, this fee would
be non-refundable.
Of course, this proposal is not
without serious repercussions. It
would most certainly hinder students
who take a large quarter load in order
to get more education for their
money. It is laced with bureaucratic
difficulties. Yet, though hardly an
ideal solution, it is still only one of the

alternatives that needs to be explored.
Still another consideration of the
committee has been in the area of
student responsibility. The argument
here is that a student who waits until
the last minute before dropping a class
is being irresponsible in the choice of
classes and must be corrected. Whether
or not this is true is irrelevant. The
University cannot legislate student
responsibility.
University Not 'Parents'
It should not view itself in the role of
"parents" away from home. This must
not be the function of an institution
of higher education. It should instead
create an atmosphere where
responsibility can be learned.
When the recommendation for the
present system of the Study of

Kevin McDermott

Education at Stanford was instituted
in 1970, two major reasons were given
for such an action. One was to
alleviate some of the pressure on the
student. He could attempt difficult
classes or different fields of study
without worrying that such action
would harm him.
The second consideration was to give
him a chance to catch up with
classmates. If a student did not have
the necessary background, it could be
gained without fear of failure. These
two justifications still exist as benefits
of the system. As the minority states
in the panel's report, the current
system had "some genuine advantages
and no obvious flaws." Until a better
system can be developed, it would be a
mistake to take a step backwards.

When the recommendation for the
present system of the Study of

Kevin McDermott

Education at Stanford was instituted
in 1970, two major reasons were given
for such an action. One was to
alleviate some of the pressure on the
student. He could attempt difficult
classes or different fields of study
without worrying that such action
would harm him.
The second consideration was to give
him a chance to catch up with
classmates. If a student did not have
the necessary background, it could be
gained without fear of failure. These
two justifications still exist as benefits
of the system. As the minority states
in the panel's report, the current
system had "some genuine advantages
and no obvious flaws." Until a better
system can be developed, it would be a
mistake to take a step backwards.


Kevin McDermott is an ASSU
senator.
The Ad Hoc Panel on the Grading
System cites grade inflation and the
current financial stress of the
University as major justifications for
its proposal to re-establish a drop
deadline." d the NC (no credit) grade.
The majority of the committee argues
that grades are no longer a meaningful
mea>ure of ability.
This is refuted completely, as the
minority points out, by the fact that
grades are high because the professors
give high marks. It is important to
consider that these high grades will not
be lowered by the committee
proposal. Instead, what is necessary is
a change in the attitude of individual
professors in regard to grading.
Besides grade inflation, a second
problem with the current grading
system is that it is economically
inefficient. For example, a class might
start out with five TAs but by finals
time, only three TAs are actually
needed because of the number of
students that have dropped that class.
Although the committee has
located this problem of inefficiency, it
is clear that its proposal will not
solve it. The suggested seven week
drop deadline will not save any money
because by that time, fixed costs will
have already been incurred.
Change Tuition System
One of the possible alternatives is
to change the way tuition is charged.
One specific proposal would be to
charge a flat fee for attending Stanford
with a 12 unit course load. There
would then be an additional cost for
each extra unit taken. With any class
dropped prior to a drop deadline, this
additional fee could be refunded.
After the deadline, though a student
could still drop a class, this fee would
be non-refundable.
Of course, this proposal is not
without serious repercussions. It
would most certainly hinder students
who take a large quarter load in order
to get more education for their
money. It is laced with bureaucratic
difficulties. Yet, though hardly an
ideal solution, it is still only one of the

alternatives that needs to be explored.
Still another consideration of the
committee has been in the area of
student responsibility. The argument
here is that a student who waits until
the last minute before dropping a class
is being irresponsible in the choice of
classes and must be corrected. Whether
or not this is true is irrelevant. The
University cannot legislate student
responsibility.
University Not 'Parents'
It should not view itself in the role of
"parents" away from home. This must
not be the function of an institution
of higher education. It should instead
create an atmosphere where
responsibility can be learned.
