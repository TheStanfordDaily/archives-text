## Traveling Takes A Turn With OORC 
### CECILE HEROLD 
Imagine that you've just
arrived in Paris at Orly Airport.
You've got no place to stay and
it's 3 a.m.
Adding catastrophe to
inconvenience, you reach for your
wallet and find it has vanished.
You suddenly feel like the main
character in one of those comedy
movies where everything goes
wrong for the American abroad.
Oh, how you wish Fred
Mac Murray were back in the
starring role.
There are, however, ways to
avoid these harrowing travel
adventures, says Jeanette Philips,
director of the Overseas
Opportunities Resource Center.
"Just the mechanics of travel
can be difficult," she admits,
"but, by thinking critically and
organizing well, you'll know
exactly what you're getting into
before you get there."
Almost Anything
At the Opportunities Center,
located on the second floor of the
Bechtel International Center,
Philips helps students realize their
traveling goals through realistic
planning.

"Americans should
pay more— simply
because they can
afford more/'

"Almost anything a student
wants to do can be done, whether
it involves working, studying, or
simply traveling abroad," Philips
notes. "First we find out exactly
what the student's objectives are.
"Maybe he wants to attend a
foreign university and take some
advanced courses to seriously
work toward his degree. Maybe he
wants to live with a foreign family
and work.
"But before recommending
any particular program, we find
out previous traveling experience,
language background, and
available resource funds.
"Then we present all the travel
alternatives. The student's final
choice should be an educated
decision weighing all the
possibilities."
For one student, senior Mike
Hollabar, the best travel plan

called for a combination of a
Stanford Overseas campus with an
individual program.
Hollabar spent the first six
months of his sophomore year at
S tanford-in-Germany, the
Beutelsbach campus, then another
six months in Paris and then
Oxford.
"At Oxford, I lived in a flat
and commuted to school," he
explains. "I was on a one-to-one
basis with a professor studying
Medieval Britain and
19th-century Europe."
In Paris Hollabar studied at the
Sorbonne and lived in an
apartment with a faimily and other
students.
'Pretty Strenuous'
Comparing the Stanford
Overseas Campus experience to
his individually-designed program,
Hollabar notes, "The approaches
were entirely different.
"On the Stanford campus,
everything was pretty much taken
care of for the students, although
that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Meanwhile, the curriculum and
general life style at Oxford was
pretty strenuous."
Hollabar, who says he began
planning his Oxford attendance
from"the first day of my
freshman year," has now applied
to a number of graduate schools
in Europe including Oxford, the
University of London, and

Edinburgh.
"The Resource Center
provided me with my
undergraduate Oxford application
and later, with prospectives on
business schools," he says.
Not Just 'Cheap Stuff
Another student, Rick
Donohoe, finds that solely
independent travel suits him best.
Last summer, Donohoe, working
towards a master';: degree in Latin
American studies, traveled by car
with his wife and son to the
Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico,
where he did cultural research.
Speaking about his trip,
Donohoe explains, "I think the
most important thing is not to go
to a country with a lot of
preliminary assumptions," adding
that perhaps too many people
went to Mexico simply as a place
to buy "cheap stuff." Com
menting on the frequent practice
of haggling in the market place, he
adds, "Americans should pay
more—simply because they can
afford more.
"Both the seller and the buyer
should feel they've gotten a good
deal, as far as I'm concerned."
Make An Effort
Donohoe adds that "when you
speak the language or some of the
language, you have a tremendous
advantage. It shows you've made
an effort.
"When I spoke Spanish in

Mexico, people were really
surprised I was American. They
had their own stereotypes too,
often picturing an 'American'as a
fat man dressed in a Hawaiian
shirt, carrying a camera and only
speaking English."
Eurail Passes
Lastly, Donohoe suggests,
"Meet people. Ride the city
buses. You can miss so much just
by flying into the country,
cabbing out to a hotel, and
isolating yourself in guided
tour*: "

"When you speak the
you have
an advantage."

A new student employee of the
ASSU Travel Service, Marcip
Axlerad, can suggest plenty of
options to the standard guided
tour.
Working at the Overseas
Resource Center, she acts as a
travel advisor and offers
information and tickets on charter
flights both to Europe and on the
continent.
"We also sell Eurail and Youth
Hostel passes and sponsor an
overseas car leasing and buying
service. These aids are open to

everyone, faculty too," Axlerad
points out.
Besides making final travel
arrangements, Axlerad says she
helps visitors make use of the
Resource Library materials which
include "books on bicycling,
camping, backpacking, overseas
work regulations, getting your
passport and visa, what the
accredited colleges are, how to get
an overseas degree and how to
apply for funding through
fellowships."
Associated with the Institute of
International Education, the
Center is "constantly receiving
new literature on what's
happening in travel and study
opportunities all over the world,"
director Philips explains.
She adds that the Overseas
Resource Center will be
sponsoring informal study and
travel workshops "on the
how-tos" Thursday, from 4
lo 6 p.m. and next Thursday,
February 13, from 7 to 10
p.m.

LIBRARY TRIPPING—Chang Shamm-Chien, Elinor Schottstaedt, and Jeanette Philips are available in the '
Overseas Opportunities Resource Center Library to assist students who need information on studying and
traveling abroad. The library contains information on bicycling, camping, backpacking, work
opportunities and what to do if you drink the water when you're not supposed to.

FLASHER? — No, it's Richard Lyman, a modest man who drives a
VW bus and works at Stanford University. His wife says he's not as
poor as ht looks.
Imagine that you've just
arrived in Paris at Orly Airport.
You've got no place to stay and
it's 3 a.m.
Adding catastrophe to
inconvenience, you reach for your
wallet and find it has vanished.
You suddenly feel like the main
character in one of those comedy
movies where everything goes
wrong for the American abroad.
Oh, how you wish Fred
Mac Murray were back in the
starring role.
There are, however, ways to
avoid these harrowing travel
adventures, says Jeanette Philips,
director of the Overseas
Opportunities Resource Center.
"Just the mechanics of travel
can be difficult," she admits,
"but, by thinking critically and
organizing well, you'll know
exactly what you're getting into
before you get there."
Almost Anything
At the Opportunities Center,
located on the second floor of the
Bechtel International Center,
Philips helps students realize their
traveling goals through realistic
planning.

"Americans should
pay more— simply
because they can
afford more/'

"Almost anything a student
wants to do can be done, whether
it involves working, studying, or
simply traveling abroad," Philips
notes. "First we find out exactly
what the student's objectives are.
"Maybe he wants to attend a
foreign university and take some
advanced courses to seriously
work toward his degree. Maybe he
wants to live with a foreign family
and work.
"But before recommending
any particular program, we find
out previous traveling experience,
language background, and
available resource funds.
"Then we present all the travel
alternatives. The student's final
choice should be an educated
decision weighing all the
possibilities."
For one student, senior Mike
Hollabar, the best travel plan

called for a combination of a
Stanford Overseas campus with an
individual program.
Hollabar spent the first six
months of his sophomore year at
S tanford-in-Germany, the
Beutelsbach campus, then another
six months in Paris and then
Oxford.
"At Oxford, I lived in a flat
and commuted to school," he
explains. "I was on a one-to-one
basis with a professor studying
Medieval Britain and
19th-century Europe."
In Paris Hollabar studied at the
Sorbonne and lived in an
apartment with a faimily and other
students.
'Pretty Strenuous'
Comparing the Stanford
Overseas Campus experience to
his individually-designed program,
Hollabar notes, "The approaches
were entirely different.
"On the Stanford campus,
everything was pretty much taken
care of for the students, although
that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Meanwhile, the curriculum and
general life style at Oxford was
pretty strenuous."
Hollabar, who says he began
planning his Oxford attendance
from"the first day of my
freshman year," has now applied
to a number of graduate schools
in Europe including Oxford, the
University of London, and

Edinburgh.
"The Resource Center
provided me with my
undergraduate Oxford application
and later, with prospectives on
business schools," he says.
Not Just 'Cheap Stuff
Another student, Rick
Donohoe, finds that solely
independent travel suits him best.
Last summer, Donohoe, working
towards a master';: degree in Latin
American studies, traveled by car
with his wife and son to the
Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico,
where he did cultural research.
Speaking about his trip,
Donohoe explains, "I think the
most important thing is not to go
to a country with a lot of
preliminary assumptions," adding
that perhaps too many people
went to Mexico simply as a place
to buy "cheap stuff." Com
menting on the frequent practice
of haggling in the market place, he
adds, "Americans should pay
more—simply because they can
afford more.
"Both the seller and the buyer
should feel they've gotten a good
deal, as far as I'm concerned."
Make An Effort
Donohoe adds that "when you
speak the language or some of the
language, you have a tremendous
advantage. It shows you've made
an effort.
"When I spoke Spanish in

Mexico, people were really
surprised I was American. They
had their own stereotypes too,
often picturing an 'American'as a
fat man dressed in a Hawaiian
shirt, carrying a camera and only
speaking English."
Eurail Passes
Lastly, Donohoe suggests,
"Meet people. Ride the city
buses. You can miss so much just
by flying into the country,
cabbing out to a hotel, and
isolating yourself in guided
tour*: "

"When you speak the
you have
an advantage."

A new student employee of the
ASSU Travel Service, Marcip
Axlerad, can suggest plenty of
options to the standard guided
tour.
Working at the Overseas
Resource Center, she acts as a
travel advisor and offers
information and tickets on charter
flights both to Europe and on the
continent.
"We also sell Eurail and Youth
Hostel passes and sponsor an
overseas car leasing and buying
service. These aids are open to

everyone, faculty too," Axlerad
points out.
Besides making final travel
arrangements, Axlerad says she
helps visitors make use of the
Resource Library materials which
include "books on bicycling,
camping, backpacking, overseas
work regulations, getting your
passport and visa, what the
accredited colleges are, how to get
an overseas degree and how to
apply for funding through
fellowships."
Associated with the Institute of
International Education, the
Center is "constantly receiving
new literature on what's

opportunities all over the world,"
director Philips explains.

LIBRARY TRIPPING—Chang Shamm-Chien, Elinor Schottstaedt, and Jeanette Philips are available in the '
Overseas Opportunities Resource Center Library to assist students who need information on studying and
traveling abroad. The library contains information on bicycling, camping, backpacking, work
opportunities and what to do if you drink the water when you're not supposed to.

FLASHER? — No, it's Richard Lyman, a modest man who drives a
VW bus and works at Stanford University. His wife says he's not as
poor as ht looks.
Imagine that you've just
arrived in Paris at Orly Airport.
You've got no place to stay and
it's 3 a.m.
Adding catastrophe to
inconvenience, you reach for your
wallet and find it has vanished.
You suddenly feel like the main
character in one of those comedy
movies where everything goes
wrong for the American abroad.
Oh, how you wish Fred
Mac Murray were back in the
starring role.
There are, however, ways to
avoid these harrowing travel
adventures, says Jeanette Philips,
director of the Overseas
Opportunities Resource Center.
"Just the mechanics of travel
can be difficult," she admits,
"but, by thinking critically and
organizing well, you'll know
exactly what you're getting into
before you get there."
Almost Anything
At the Opportunities Center,
located on the second floor of the
Bechtel International Center,
Philips helps students realize their
traveling goals through realistic
planning.

"Americans should
pay more— simply
because they can
afford more/'

"Almost anything a student
wants to do can be done, whether
it involves working, studying, or
simply traveling abroad," Philips
notes. "First we find out exactly
what the student's objectives are.
"Maybe he wants to attend a
foreign university and take some
advanced courses to seriously
work toward his degree. Maybe he
wants to live with a foreign family
and work.
"But before recommending
any particular program, we find
out previous traveling experience,
language background, and
available resource funds.
"Then we present all the travel
alternatives. The student's final
choice should be an educated
decision weighing all the
possibilities."
For one student, senior Mike
Hollabar, the best travel plan

called for a combination of a
Stanford Overseas campus with an
individual program.
Hollabar spent the first six
months of his sophomore year at
S tanford-in-Germany, the
Beutelsbach campus, then another
six months in Paris and then
Oxford.
"At Oxford, I lived in a flat
and commuted to school," he
explains. "I was on a one-to-one
basis with a professor studying
Medieval Britain and
19th-century Europe."
In Paris Hollabar studied at the
Sorbonne and lived in an
apartment with a faimily and other
students.
'Pretty Strenuous'
Comparing the Stanford
Overseas Campus experience to
his individually-designed program,
Hollabar notes, "The approaches
were entirely different.
"On the Stanford campus,
everything was pretty much taken
care of for the students, although
that's not necessarily a bad thing.
Meanwhile, the curriculum and
general life style at Oxford was
pretty strenuous."
Hollabar, who says he began
planning his Oxford attendance
from"the first day of my
freshman year," has now applied
to a number of graduate schools
in Europe including Oxford, the
University of London, and

Edinburgh.
"The Resource Center
provided me with my
undergraduate Oxford application
and later, with prospectives on
business schools," he says.
Not Just 'Cheap Stuff
Another student, Rick
Donohoe, finds that solely
independent travel suits him best.
Last summer, Donohoe, working
towards a master';: degree in Latin
American studies, traveled by car
with his wife and son to the
Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico,
where he did cultural research.
Speaking about his trip,
Donohoe explains, "I think the
most important thing is not to go
to a country with a lot of
preliminary assumptions," adding
that perhaps too many people
went to Mexico simply as a place
to buy "cheap stuff." Com
menting on the frequent practice
of haggling in the market place, he
adds, "Americans should pay
more—simply because they can
afford more.
"Both the seller and the buyer
should feel they've gotten a good
deal, as far as I'm concerned."
Make An Effort
Donohoe adds that "when you
speak the language or some of the
language, you have a tremendous
advantage. It shows you've made
an effort.
"When I spoke Spanish in

Mexico, people were really
surprised I was American. They
had their own stereotypes too,
often picturing an 'American'as a
fat man dressed in a Hawaiian
shirt, carrying a camera and only
speaking English."
Eurail Passes
Lastly, Donohoe suggests,
"Meet people. Ride the city
buses. You can miss so much just
by flying into the country,
cabbing out to a hotel, and
isolating yourself in guided
tour*: "
