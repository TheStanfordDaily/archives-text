Why does Dick Lyman drive a beat-up old
Volkswagen ivhen he makes $70,000 a year?—S.S.
"It shows no understanding, no heart to ask that
question," wailed Jing Lyman, after flatly denying
that the president makes that much. "That car's a
member of the family."
Lyman said that the 1959 VW bus, whose name
is Maestro, is "close to being a collector's
item ... We bought it new in December of 1959
when he[ President Lyman | was on a Guggenheim
fellowship in the days when he was a practicing
British historian."
Maestro has apparently given the Lymans many
years of faithful service. Mrs. Lyman calls it "a
great box . . . It's carried I can't tell you how many
kids . . . We've taken it on places where roads were
marked on maps and they didn't exist but we've
gone there anyway. It's the most faithful car we
have."
Don't get too choked up, though. The Lymans
have two other cars, including a Mercedes.

What ever happened to the phallic looking statue in
White Plaza that was put up for the Spring Festival

but lingered long after the festive weekend was
over?—S. F.
That statue was a creation of sculptor Royce
Meyerott, and has since returned to his studio in
Mountain View.
Meyerott refused to comment on what the
sculpture actually was. "I've sort of learned that a
sculpture's a statement in itself," he said. "It
doesn't leave people any room for imagination if
you tell them the name."
The statue is 10 and a half feet high and
weighs about three tons, Meyerott said. It took him
one year to complete and is now for sale — a
bargain at $18,000.
The sculpture was "sort of naked at the
bottom" at the Spring Festival, according to
Meyerott. It has since been mounted on a base (not
what you might think)—a wooden box with ivy
dripping over the side.
Meyerott said that the Stanford show was the
first time he's displayed his sculpture in three years.
The statue is now on display at 920 Rich Avenue,
and Meyerott promised to reveal the name to
anyone who dropped by.
