# New Courses Examine International Relations

The Committee on
International Relations plans to
offer six new courses next year,
all emphasizing "international
work which is humanities
oriented, as opposed to social
science oriented," according to
program director Robert
Keohane, associate professor of
political science.
Keohane characterized the six
new courses, which will be taught
by members of five departments,
as a "new way of looking at
international relations." He
remarked that the courses will
focus on "inter-cultural relations
in addition to political and
economic relations."
A five-year $366,000 grant
from the National Endowment for
the Humanities (NEH) will fund
the new courses.
The grant, awarded to the
University three years ago, has
already been used to "sponsor and
develop a number of courses,"
according to Keohane.
The University "by no means
has an obligation to fund the
program at that |NEH| level,"
Keohane noted. He hopes the
program is "not going to entail
additional costs after the grant
runs out."
Humanities Focus
"Our main emphasis with these
funds is particularly to develop
international relations courses
which focus on humanities," he

said. "The traditional departments
teaching international relations
are history, political science, and
economics." In contrast, most of
the new courses will be taught by
humanities professors.
For example, Assoc. English
Prof. John Bender will offer a
course on "18th Century Ideas of
Prisons," Religious Studies Prof.
William Clebsch will teach
"Christianity and Cultural
Interaction" and Assoc. English
Prof. David Halliburton will offer
"National and International
Identities" at the Cliveden
campus.
More Courses
Three additional courses will
be History Prof. Peter
Stansky's course on
"Modernisms," tracing various
literary and cultural movements in
Europe; an offering by Assl.
Political Science Prof. Nan
Keohane on "European and
American Democratic Theory";
and".Japanese and Western
Literary and Cultural
Interactions," taught by Asian
Language Prof. Makoto Ueda.
In a related development, the
International Relations
Committee expects to soon
receive Faculty Senate approval of
its proposal to establish a formal
major in International Relations.
The Undergraduate Studies
Committee endorsed the proposal
last month.
