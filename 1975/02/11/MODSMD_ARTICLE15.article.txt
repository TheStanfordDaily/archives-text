## Symphony Provides Strong Tchaikovsky 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Yuri Temirkanov and Vladimir
Spivakov made their San
Francisco debuts with the San
Francisco Symphony Wednesday
night in an all-Tchaikovsky
program.
Temirkanov, visiting
conductor, led violinist Spivakov
and the orchestra through an
exciting performance of the
Violin Concerto in D Major, Opus
35, and the Symphony No. 6 in B
Minor, Opus 74 ("Pathetique").
He is a precise, secure conductor
whose energy and vitality created
an infectious enthusiasm for the
music.
The Violin Concerto met with
distaste when first performed in
1881, but this audience responded
with cheers and a long standing
ovation.
Spivakov was obviously
prepared for its difficult
challenges of technique,
intonation and expression. He was
in complete, disciplined control of
every note, every phrase, from the
slow, sad, lump-in-the-throat
melodies to the sweeping
arpeggios and difficult harmonics.
The piece demands a knowledge
of the entire range of the
instrument, and Spivakov felt
completely at home.
The Symphony No. 6 is one of
the most well-known symphonies,
and in the 1940's and '50s, its
"Pathetique" theme was subjected
to various schmaltzy

interpretations.
Tchaikovsky was a highly
sensitive man and was constantly
distressed at the critics' reactions
to his unusual music. Although he
felt deeply depressed before
completing the 6th, his
satisfaction with the final results
renewed Tchaikovsky's confidence
in his creative abilities. Audience
response was polite to its premiere
in 1893; he died nine days later,
still confident that it was his
greatest work.
The Orchestra beautifully
expressed the range and intensities
of the composer's troubled
psyche, from the exalted passion
and turbulence of the strings to
the dramatic appearance of fate,
as portrayed by the brass.
A few minor technical
problems marred the otherwise
flawless performance.
Occasionally the pianissimo
passages were barely audible,
especially the bassoon's opening
solo.
Tchaikovsky ends this piece
with an unusual slow adagio as
opposed to the more traditional
fast allegro; the pathos and
emotional intensity come to a
rather abrupt, quiet end. Here the
composer is finally at peace with
himself; the applause showed that
the audience understood.

MELLISONANT—That means sweet-sounding, and it's a good
description of Mel Lewis' drumming. Mel and co-leader Thad Jones
brought their top-rated big jazz band to Memorial Auditorium
Thursday and Friday nights, and soloists like saxophonist Billy Harper
(pictured right) provided lots of excitement.
