# Politics Muddles Pomare's Message
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
Mixing art with politics is a
tricky business, and unless one is a
real artist the results are often
disastrous.
Such was the case last
Wednesday night at the Eleo
Pomare Dance Company's concert
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Sponsored by an assortment nf
Stanford community groups, the
concert was slated as part of an
"ongoing series of political/artistic
events."
Apparently Pomare's company
was chosen to perform because of
its emphasis on dance as a
medium for political commentary.
But unfortunately on Wednesday
night neither the dancing nor the
political messages were unique,
profound, or even interesting.
Oddly enough, Pomare
considers himself a disciple of
Kurt Joos, creator of the Green
Table, one of the few really
successful political dances that is
also a work of art. Pomare's
choreography lacks precisely that
simplicity and universality that
make Joos' work great.
Smack Of Shallowness
Instead of being timeless
statements on humanity, Pomare's
dances smack of shallowness and
false didacticism. He's not telling
us anything new about dance or
society, yet he chatters on
endlessly.

What Pomare doesn't seem to
realize is that the good artist
doesn't have to strive to bo
relevant; if he formulates his ideas
clearly and honestly then his art
speaks for itself.
Instead of challenging our
perceptions, Pomare's pieces
anesthetize us. He could have
communicated more had he been
content to simply choreograph a
dance about honest,
unencumbered movement.
Politics Muddles
Instead he sacrificed the purity
of the dance in favor of a
muddled and vapid political
rhetoric, and lost on both counts.
Serendipity was perhaps the
most successful dance performed
Wednesday simply because it had
a unity, compactness and interest
in movement for movement's sake
that the other pieces lacked. The
sequences were pleasant, if
uninspired, and the dancing was,
with few exceptions, clean and
precise.
In contrast, the other two
group dances, Another Shade of
Blue and Hushed Voices both
suffered from an overuse of garish
and vulgar costumes, corny
mannerisms, and trite music.
Danced to a collection of songs by

Roberta Flack, Judy Collins, and
Laura Nyro, Another Shade of
Blue looked more like a high
school exercise in melodramatic
choreography than a serious
dance.
Leftist Heroes
Hushed Voices, ostensibly the
most "political" of the evening's
works, was a self-indulgent study
of leftist political chimeras;
assassinated heroes, gun-toting
Vietnamese, and incarcerated
"visionaries" abounded. What
might have been an interesting
perspective on selected black
leaders became instead an
overambitious summary of
contemporary black history.
The remaining two pieces,
Roots and Narcissus Rising, were
both solos choreographed by
Pomare that offered superficial
examinations of black women and
"the modern leather and cycle
man," respectively.
Dyane Harvey, the soloist in
Roots is a dancer of extraordinary
gymnastic ability, but she lacks
the special quality that is said to
be the secret of all great dancers;
making the impossible look easy.
In watching her dance all one is
aware of are her record-high
extensions and her miraculously

balanced attitudes, and the effort
needed to sustain them.
Pomare's solo, Narcissus
Rising, was a tedious study of the
motorcycle mentality. It consisted
of an oiled and leathcr-clad
Pomare who writhed and gyrated
to the accompaniment of a
droning rock score, while sirens
screamed and lights flashed in the
background.
There was something very
dfted not only in Narcissus
Rising, but in all of the works
presented Wednesday evening.
One wonders how a New
York-based company like
Pomare's can continue to perform
and tour with a repertoire that is
so obviously rooted in the
political and social ambiance of
the 19605.
Especially in light of his
predilection for political
immediacy, one would hope that
in the future Pomare will have the
sense and foresight to revitalize
his works, tone down the politics
and tune in the dancing.

Roberta Flack, Judy Collins, and
Laura Nyro, Another Shade of
Blue looked more like a high
school exercise in melodramatic
choreography than a serious
dance.
Leftist Heroes
Hushed Voices, ostensibly the
most "political" of the evening's
works, was a self-indulgent study
of leftist political chimeras;
assassinated heroes, gun-toting
Vietnamese, and incarcerated
"visionaries" abounded. What
might have been an interesting
perspective on selected black
leaders became instead an
overambitious summary of
contemporary black history.
The remaining two pieces,
Roots and Narcissus Rising, were
both solos choreographed by
Pomare that offered superficial
examinations of black women and
"the modern leather and cycle
man," respectively.
Dyane Harvey, the soloist in
Roots is a dancer of extraordinary
gymnastic ability, but she lacks
the special quality that is said to
be the secret of all great dancers;
making the impossible look easy.
In watching her dance all one is
aware of are her record-high
extensions and her miraculously

balanced attitudes, and the effort
needed to sustain them.
Pomare's solo, Narcissus
Rising, was a tedious study of the
motorcycle mentality. It consisted
of an oiled and leathcr-clad
Pomare who writhed and gyrated
to the accompaniment of a
droning rock score, while sirens
screamed and lights flashed in the
background.
There was something very
dfted not only in Narcissus
Rising, but in all of the works
presented Wednesday evening.
One wonders how a New
York-based company like
Pomare's can continue to perform
and tour with a repertoire that is
so obviously rooted in the
political and social ambiance of
the 19605.
Especially in light of his
predilection for political
immediacy, one would hope that
in the future Pomare will have the
sense and foresight to revitalize
his works, tone down the politics
and tune in the dancing.
Mixing art with politics is a
tricky business, and unless one is a
real artist the results are often
disastrous.
Such was the case last
Wednesday night at the Eleo
Pomare Dance Company's concert
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Sponsored by an assortment nf
Stanford community groups, the
concert was slated as part of an
"ongoing series of political/artistic
events."
Apparently Pomare's company
was chosen to perform because of
its emphasis on dance as a
medium for political commentary.
But unfortunately on Wednesday
night neither the dancing nor the
political messages were unique,
profound, or even interesting.
Oddly enough, Pomare
considers himself a disciple of
Kurt Joos, creator of the Green
Table, one of the few really
successful political dances that is
also a work of art. Pomare's
choreography lacks precisely that
simplicity and universality that
make Joos' work great.
Smack Of Shallowness
Instead of being timeless
statements on humanity, Pomare's
dances smack of shallowness and
false didacticism. He's not telling
us anything new about dance or
society, yet he chatters on
endlessly.

What Pomare doesn't seem to
realize is that the good artist
doesn't have to strive to bo
relevant; if he formulates his ideas
clearly and honestly then his art
speaks for itself.
Instead of challenging our
perceptions, Pomare's pieces
anesthetize us. He could have
communicated more had he been
content to simply choreograph a
dance about honest,
unencumbered movement.
Politics Muddles
Instead he sacrificed the purity
of the dance in favor of a
muddled and vapid political
rhetoric, and lost on both counts.
Serendipity was perhaps the
most successful dance performed
Wednesday simply because it had
a unity, compactness and interest
in movement for movement's sake
that the other pieces lacked. The
sequences were pleasant, if
uninspired, and the dancing was,
with few exceptions, clean and
precise.
In contrast, the other two
group dances, Another Shade of
Blue and Hushed Voices both
suffered from an overuse of garish
and vulgar costumes, corny
mannerisms, and trite music.
Danced to a collection of songs by

Roberta Flack, Judy Collins, and
Laura Nyro, Another Shade of
Blue looked more like a high
school exercise in melodramatic
choreography than a serious
dance.
