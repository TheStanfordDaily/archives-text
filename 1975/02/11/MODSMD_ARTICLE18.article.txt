## Big Band Shows Class 
### DAVE SMITH 
That the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis
band is widely—almost
universally—considered the finest
big band in existence should
hardly surprise anyone who heard
them play at Memorial
Auditorium last weekend.
Any band that can boast even
one soloist as magnificent as, say,
baritone saxophonist Pepper
Adams can consider itself very
fortunate, but at Friday night's
performance this orchestra
showed off 12 - and it's no
exaggeration to say that they were
all superb.
It's a credit to Jones, who
conducts and plays flugelhorn,
and Lewis, the drummer, that the
musicians they have assembled are
more than just a collection of
awesome soloists.
Instead they form a polished
unit, a 17-man organization that
can create just as much
excitement from a delicate
ensemble passage as from one of
the searing solos of trumpeter Jon
Faddis or tenor saxophonist Billy
Harper.
Impressive Subtlety
Nine-year band veteran Jerry
Dodgion's arrangement of
"Ambiance" was a fine example
of how the band can be both
subdued and stunningly effective
at the same time. An
impressionistic piano solo by

Walter Norris, the newest member
of the band, who has moved
stylishly into the position held for
nine years by predecessor Koland
Hanna, opened "Ambiance."
As Norris took up the first
strains of Marian McPartland's
melody, the rest of the band came
in softly, led by the trio of Jones
on Flugelhom, Dodgion on flute,
and Ed Xiques on soprano sax—a
highly unorthodox group of
instruments for a big jazz band,
but perfect for such an airy song.
Then the ensemble faded out
again, leaving Dodgion and bassist
George Mraz for a breatntaking
duet. As Mraz's bass rephrased the
melodic line, Dodgion's flute
soared unencumbered by any
rhythm. The duet provided the
most beautiful moment of the
evening's show.
Soloists Shine
As well as they play together,
however, this is primarily a
soloists' orchestra, and they were
in their usi al fine form Friday.
Jones, who does most of the
arranging, has made each song a
showcase for one or more of his
solo stars.
Jones' arrangements proved
straightforward and tasteful; he is
never guilty of "over-arranging,"
since he recognizes that even the
best-written charts can't create
the excitement of improvised
solos.
The upbeat "Once Around,"
for instance, served as a fine
vehicle for Adams, who does more
with the devilish baritone sax than
any other jazzman. "Tow-Away
Zone," the orchestra's encore,
showed off the two tenor
saxophonists, Ron Bridgewater
and Billy Harper.
Bridgewater is a powerful
player in the tradition of George
Coleman and early Wayne
Shorter, but Harper is even better:
a fiery, intense player whose
prowess is reminiscent of the
young John Coltrane, and that's
an indication of how much
promise Harper possesses.
Trumpet Trio
The Jones-Lewis orchestra is
also exceptional for three great
trumpeters. Jones, who prefers
the more mellow-sounding
flugelhom, didn't give himself
much solo space, but when he did
step out, as on his own
composition "Quiet Lady," his
playing was warm and richly
soulful.
Cecil Bridgewater, who has
been one of New York's finest
jazz musicians for several years,
blew three fine solos; his playing
with the mute on "Fingers" stood

out for its power.
First trumpeter for the band is
jazz's foremost unindcrkind Jon
Faddis, who at 21 has not only
the strongest "chops" of any
musician but also his own style
based, of course, on playing notes
that no one else can hope to hit.
Faddis tooK only one solo, but it
was typically Faddis for both its
awesome technique and its
humorousness.
Mraz Moves
Bassist George Mraz, too,
proved himself an outstanding
member of the band. His duet
with vocalist Juanita Flemming
(who did a fine job on her three
featured numbers) showed Mraz's
facility at being much more than a
mere accompanist.
Mraz played his own solo
adroitly, and throughout the show
his basslines, such as his robust
strummed chords on the band's
standard "Central Park North"
commanded attention and
respect. A conservatory-trained
musician from Czechoslovakia,
Mraz is just one of several
Europeans making outstanding
contributions to American jazz.
"Classy" is the best description
of co-leader Lewis' drumming.
Never ostentatious but always
supplying the necessary muscle,
Lewis showed his musical
maturity. He also added a fine
hi-hat solo on "Fingers."
A big band represents
something of a trade-off, since it
doesn't allow for ihe spontaneity
or individual "stretching out" of a
small group setting.
So those listeners who might
have wished to hear more of Jon
Faddis or of the band's talented
valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer
(who was also limited to one solo)
could feel justified in preferrring a
smaller group — after all, when big
bands were the only major jazz
units getting much exposure,
many musicians found them
limiting, too.
For the Jones-Lewis band,
however, having so many
musicians is not a problem, for
they never get in each other's
way. Instead they complement
each other well to become that
rare and beautiful jazz entity: a
group of great soloists who are a
great big band.
