Ford: Rationing 'Over My Dead Body"
HOUSTON, Tex. — Battling to save his energy plan,
President Ford declared yesterday that gasoline rationing
will be imposed only "over my dead body."
Ford departed from the prepared text of an address to
an energy conference here to use the strongest language to
date reiterating his opposition to mandatory rationing.
After the speech, the President met privately with a
group of leading Texas Republicans. They included John B.
Connally, former governor and U.S. treasury' secretary who
is now under indictment for bribery and perjury.
Many oilmen were in Ford's audience of about 600, and
applauded his call for an end to American dependence on
foreign oil.
The President rejected suggestions that he ease off his
proposal to cut oil imports by a million barrels a day. He
said "this bet-a-million philosophy — that we can continue
to import the entire million or a significant part of the
million barrels that I propose to cut back — is a very high
risk and reckless gamble."
Muskie Favors Increasing Deficit
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee says it may be economically sound to increase
President Ford's $52 billion deficit to spur recovery from
the recession and limit future federal red ink.
But Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) said in an
interview that he doesn't know whether that idea is
politically "salable" even if it makes sense economically.
Muskie said "our economic advisors are working on a
game plan that would reduce unemployment and increase
production."
Muskie cited estimates by some economists that the
jobless figures projected in Ford's fiscal 1976 budget mean
a $750 billion loss in production and a $250 billion loss in
federal revenue over what otherwise might be possible in
the next few years.
Senators Question Defense Contract
WASHINGTON — Sens. Henry M. Jackson and Hubert
H. Humphrey have called for a congressional investigation
of the Defense Department's contract with a private
corporation to train Saudi Arabian troops to protect oil
wells in the Persian Gulf.
Jackson (D-Wash.), said he would ask Sen. John C.
Stennis (D-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, to conduct hearings.
Jackson, who last Thursday announced his candidacy for
the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, said he was
"completely baffled" by the contract.
"Only a short time ago the President and secretary of
state indicated the option of U.S. military action might be
considered under certain circumstances in the Middle East,"
he said in a telephone interview Sunday.

He said the contract to train Saudi troops was
"confusing," since "we're the only ones who've raised an
inference of a threat."
Thieu Predicts More War In New Year
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu told South
Vietnamese beginning the Tet lunar new year yesterday
that more bloodshed and hard times were ahead. The
political opposition repeated calls for his resignation.
In an address to mark Vietnam's Year of the Cat, Chieu
again ruled out a coalition government with the Viet Cong
and pledged to fight until Communist forces are defeated.
More than 20 opposition deputies and senators staging a
hunger strike in front of the National Assembly building
lighted torches and burned photos of the president.
A letter from the opposition accused Thieu of taking
advantage of Tet by going on national radio "to renew his
lies and his promises for political stability, building up
democracy and maintaining territorial integrity."
In his address, Thieu said: "Two years have elapsed since
the signing of the Paris cease-fire agreement. The North
Vietnamese Communists have rebuilt in South Vietnam a
stronger invasion force.
"They are crazily pushing ahead a general offensive on
our territory. We must understand that the Communists
will never strictly implement the Paris agreement unless
their armed invasion at present is defeated."
Credit Refunds Due Consumers
WASHINGTON — Department stores, banks and other
businesses owe millions of dollars to American consumers
who have failed to collect money that is due them in charge
account and credit card refunds.
Until now, it was the customer's responsibility to make
sure he got his money and many people forgot or didn't
bother or didn't know how to collect. Recent government
actions may put the shoe on the other foot, requiring
businesses to take affirmative steps to insure refunds are
received.
No one is sure just how much money is involved.
Allen Reskin of the Federal Trade Commission says the
sum is "staggering . . . untold millions." Stephen Mindell of
the New York State attorney general's office says the total
could be "hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars.
It's like a pot of gold. . . People are letting it go by
default."
The money comes from customers who overpay their
charge bills or who buy something, pay for it, return it and
take a credit on their account.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy today with a chance of rain tomorrow.
Slightly warmer. Overnight lows in the 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow mid 50s to lower 60s.

hunger strike in front of the National Assembly building
lighted torches and burned photos of the president.
A letter from the opposition accused Thieu of taking
advantage of Tet by going on national radio "to renew his
lies and his promises for political stability, building up
democracy and maintaining territorial integrity."
In his address, Thieu said: "Two years have elapsed since
the signing of the Paris cease-fire agreement. The North
Vietnamese Communists have rebuilt in South Vietnam a
stronger invasion force.
"They are crazily pushing ahead a general offensive on
our territory. We must understand that the Communists
will never strictly implement the Paris agreement unless
their armed invasion at present is defeated."
Credit Refunds Due Consumers
WASHINGTON — Department stores, banks and other
businesses owe millions of dollars to American consumers
who have failed to collect money that is due them in charge
account and credit card refunds.
Until now, it was the customer's responsibility to make
sure he got his money and many people forgot or didn't
bother or didn't know how to collect. Recent government
actions may put the shoe on the other foot, requiring
businesses to take affirmative steps to insure refunds are
received.
No one is sure just how much money is involved.
Allen Reskin of the Federal Trade Commission says the
sum is "staggering . . . untold millions." Stephen Mindell of
the New York State attorney general's office says the total
could be "hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars.
It's like a pot of gold. . . People are letting it go by
default."
The money comes from customers who overpay their
charge bills or who buy something, pay for it, return it and
take a credit on their account.

Ford: Rationing 'Over My Dead Body"
HOUSTON, Tex. — Battling to save his energy plan,
President Ford declared yesterday that gasoline rationing
will be imposed only "over my dead body."
Ford departed from the prepared text of an address to
an energy conference here to use the strongest language to
date reiterating his opposition to mandatory rationing.
After the speech, the President met privately with a
group of leading Texas Republicans. They included John B.
Connally, former governor and U.S. treasury' secretary who
is now under indictment for bribery and perjury.
Many oilmen were in Ford's audience of about 600, and
applauded his call for an end to American dependence on
foreign oil.
The President rejected suggestions that he ease off his
proposal to cut oil imports by a million barrels a day. He
said "this bet-a-million philosophy — that we can continue
to import the entire million or a significant part of the
million barrels that I propose to cut back — is a very high
risk and reckless gamble."
Muskie Favors Increasing Deficit
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee says it may be economically sound to increase
President Ford's $52 billion deficit to spur recovery from
the recession and limit future federal red ink.
But Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) said in an
interview that he doesn't know whether that idea is
politically "salable" even if it makes sense economically.
Muskie said "our economic advisors are working on a
game plan that would reduce unemployment and increase
production."
Muskie cited estimates by some economists that the
jobless figures projected in Ford's fiscal 1976 budget mean
a $750 billion loss in production and a $250 billion loss in
federal revenue over what otherwise might be possible in
the next few years.
Senators Question Defense Contract
WASHINGTON — Sens. Henry M. Jackson and Hubert
H. Humphrey have called for a congressional investigation
of the Defense Department's contract with a private
corporation to train Saudi Arabian troops to protect oil
wells in the Persian Gulf.
Jackson (D-Wash.), said he would ask Sen. John C.
Stennis (D-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, to conduct hearings.
Jackson, who last Thursday announced his candidacy for
the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, said he was
"completely baffled" by the contract.
"Only a short time ago the President and secretary of
state indicated the option of U.S. military action might be
considered under certain circumstances in the Middle East,"
he said in a telephone interview Sunday.

He said the contract to train Saudi troops was
"confusing," since "we're the only ones who've raised an
inference of a threat."
Thieu Predicts More War In New Year
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu told South
Vietnamese beginning the Tet lunar new year yesterday
that more bloodshed and hard times were ahead. The
political opposition repeated calls for his resignation.
In an address to mark Vietnam's Year of the Cat, Chieu
again ruled out a coalition government with the Viet Cong
and pledged to fight until Communist forces are defeated.

But Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) said in an
interview that he doesn't know whether that idea is
politically "salable" even if it makes sense economically.
Muskie said "our economic advisors are working on a
game plan that would reduce unemployment and increase
production."
Muskie cited estimates by some economists that the
jobless figures projected in Ford's fiscal 1976 budget mean
a $750 billion loss in production and a $250 billion loss in
federal revenue over what otherwise might be possible in
the next few years.
Senators Question Defense Contract
WASHINGTON — Sens. Henry M. Jackson and Hubert
H. Humphrey have called for a congressional investigation
of the Defense Department's contract with a private
corporation to train Saudi Arabian troops to protect oil
wells in the Persian Gulf.
Jackson (D-Wash.), said he would ask Sen. John C.
Stennis (D-Miss.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, to conduct hearings.
Jackson, who last Thursday announced his candidacy for
the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination, said he was
"completely baffled" by the contract.
"Only a short time ago the President and secretary of
state indicated the option of U.S. military action might be
considered under certain circumstances in the Middle East,"
he said in a telephone interview Sunday.

He said the contract to train Saudi troops was
"confusing," since "we're the only ones who've raised an
inference of a threat."
Thieu Predicts More War In New Year
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu told South
Vietnamese beginning the Tet lunar new year yesterday
that more bloodshed and hard times were ahead. The
political opposition repeated calls for his resignation.
In an address to mark Vietnam's Year of the Cat, Chieu
again ruled out a coalition government with the Viet Cong
and pledged to fight until Communist forces are defeated.
More than 20 opposition deputies and senators staging a
hunger strike in front of the National Assembly building
lighted torches and burned photos of the president.
A letter from the opposition accused Thieu of taking
advantage of Tet by going on national radio "to renew his
lies and his promises for political stability, building up
democracy and maintaining territorial integrity."
In his address, Thieu said: "Two years have elapsed since
the signing of the Paris cease-fire agreement. The North
Vietnamese Communists have rebuilt in South Vietnam a
stronger invasion force.
"They are crazily pushing ahead a general offensive on
our territory. We must understand that the Communists
will never strictly implement the Paris agreement unless
their armed invasion at present is defeated."
Credit Refunds Due Consumers
WASHINGTON — Department stores, banks and other
businesses owe millions of dollars to American consumers
who have failed to collect money that is due them in charge
account and credit card refunds.
Until now, it was the customer's responsibility to make
sure he got his money and many people forgot or didn't
bother or didn't know how to collect. Recent government
actions may put the shoe on the other foot, requiring
businesses to take affirmative steps to insure refunds are
received.
No one is sure just how much money is involved.
Allen Reskin of the Federal Trade Commission says the
sum is "staggering . . . untold millions." Stephen Mindell of
the New York State attorney general's office says the total
could be "hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars.
It's like a pot of gold. . . People are letting it go by
default."
The money comes from customers who overpay their
charge bills or who buy something, pay for it, return it and
take a credit on their account.
