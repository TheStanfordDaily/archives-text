# Slow Billing, Not Abuse, Troubles Centrex
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Abuse of the University's Centrex
telephone system is "not extensive,"
according to the system's overseer —
but delayed billing has combined with
unrestricted telephone lines to
produce more than one horror story.
Bruce Wiggins, operations manager
at Plant Services who supervises
Centrex, estimated that only a small
percentage of the system's $2.5
million annual cost resulted from
long-distance calls made illicitly.
"I would guess that only very little
of that is being done," Wiggins stated.
"Each department receives an itemized
list of calls made by each [telephone]
extension, so they can see what
long-distance calls are being made."
But delays of several weeks have
cost some departments hundreds of
dollars. Don Estavan, manager of the
computer facility at the Graduate
School of Business, said the facility's
phone bill was more than $600 in
November.
'A Problem'
"We had a problem, to say the
least," he related. "When we went on
Centrex last spring, our bills and
listings started coming two or three
months late. We haven't gotten our bill
for December, so we don't know what
that's going to look like.
"The telephone bill for November
was rather large — over $100 in calls to
Mexico City, and calls to the East
Coast, etc. We were running over $500

a month in long-distance calls and
$100 per month on message-unit
calls," he remarked.
Estavan had one phone removed
from the computer room and the
other restricted to local calls only.
According to Wiggins, some 200 other
telephones have had their service made
more restrictive since the system was
implemented.
"Of some 5400 lines, about 400
have requested changes in
restrictions," he stated. "About 200
lines were changed to restricted
service; at the same time,
approximately 200 which were
restricted were made unrestricted."
Another department forced to
revert to Bay Area-only telephone
service was Interdepartmental Mail.
John Doherty, manager of
reprographic services, said that many
calls were made from a frequently
unguarded extension.
"We were getting excessive charges
— calls to Mississippi, Virginia and
Kalamazoo, Mich., for example. The
bills were excessive — running
something like $55 to $60 a month for
the calls to Mississippi alone," Doherty
observed.
Original Bills Late
Doherty also said that the original
Centrex bills were "very late" — the
September bill covered the first three
months of operations, he noted. The
bills arrive on time now, he added.
Wiggins confirmed that bills for

December are currently being
processed.
"Pacific Telephone sends us a
computer tape, which we put on our
computer. Then our computer spews
out itemized bills for each extension
and each department. The whole
process takes time," he explained.
Wiggins said about 80 percent of
the University's phones are
unrestricted.
Advantages . . . And Drawbacks
The main advantage of Centrex
over the University's old system is that
Centrex allows "direct-inward

dialing." That is, incoming calls do not
have to be routed by hand through a
switchboard. This feature has reduced
the number of full-time operators
employed by the University from 40
to 24, Wiggins noted.
But the direct-dialing feature has
brought with it a drawback. Persons
with access to an extension — even a
restricted extension — can receive
collect calls from another person.
Also, long-distance calls between two
off-campus telephones can be billed to
a University extension — a so-called
"third number" call.
