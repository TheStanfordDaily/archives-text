# Drop Deadline Might Help Stop Student 'Drift'
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The hope that reinstating a drop
deadline will encourage students to
keep in touch with their advisors and
not just drift through Stanford is one
motive for the drop deadline proposal
according to Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Mason
Yearian, a member of the Ad Hoc
Panel on the Grading System.
Yearian and Panel Chairman
Bradley Efron, a professor of statistics,
discussed the pros and cons of the
proposed grade changes with about 20
people who attended the open forum

Yearian said that many students are
having their education spoiled because
"they're not making their decisions
soon enough."
He pointed out that students would
still have the options of auditing or
taking a course for pass/no credit.
Observing that the pass/no credit
option was designed to encourage
students to take courses they might
not have taken for a grade, Yearian
added, "I think it ought to be used
more for that purpose than it is now."
'Not Clear'
Addressing students expressing
concern about the detrimental effect
of having too many pass grades or
incompletes appearing on transcripts
when applying to graduate school,
Yearian said it's "not clear to me that
grades are everything that go into"
considering a graduate school
applicant.
"It is not at all clear what the
effects of this proposal will be on
grade inflation," he added.
"I don't think grading is going to
change very much," said Efron.
Although the ad hoc panel said it
hopes that the stricter drop deadline
will encourage students to see their
advisors, "I don't think there's any
guarantee in that," Yearian said. He
admitted that part of the problem is
with the advising system, not the
grading system.
'Enough Of A Penalty'
Arguing that students are
responsible enough to decide what is
best for them, a student in the
audience protested that it is "enough
of a penalty" for a student to receive
no credit for a course and that he
should not be penalized further by
having NC appear on his transcript.
Yearian cited a waste of University
resources as another reason for
enforcing an earlier drop deadline. But
students objected, saying that some
people would waste money anyway.
"If I wanted to waste $6,000 a year
I could do a damn good job of it," said
one student, urging that students be
given the opportunity to vote on the

grading change proposal.
The Ad Hoc Panel of the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement was set up in the
spring of 1974 to review and make
recommendations on the "record of
accomplishment" grading system
established in 1970. Its January report
made the following recommendations:
—that deadlines for dropping
courses be reinstated;
—that unauthorized withdrawal
from a course or unsatisfactory
performance be denoted by a "NC"
(no credit) on the student's transcript;
—that the Registrar should regularly
collect and make public grade
distributions in the different
University schools;
—that the incomplete (I) grade
be given omy when a student has
completed a substantial portion of the
course at a passing level;
—that the Registrar's Office should
widely publicize the approach of the
deadline date for choosing the pass
option.

resources as another reason for
enforcing an earlier drop deadline. But
students objected, saying that some
people would waste money anyway.
"If I wanted to waste $6,000 a year
I could do a damn good job of it," said
one student, urging that students be
given the opportunity to vote on the

grading change proposal.
The Ad Hoc Panel of the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement was set up in the
spring of 1974 to review and make
recommendations on the "record of
accomplishment" grading system
established in 1970. Its January report
made the following recommendations:
—that deadlines for dropping
courses be reinstated;
—that unauthorized withdrawal
from a course or unsatisfactory
performance be denoted by a "NC"
(no credit) on the student's transcript;
—that the Registrar should regularly
collect and make public grade
distributions in the different
University schools;
—that the incomplete (I) grade
be given omy when a student has
completed a substantial portion of the
course at a passing level;
—that the Registrar's Office should
widely publicize the approach of the
deadline date for choosing the pass
option.
The hope that reinstating a drop
deadline will encourage students to
keep in touch with their advisors and
not just drift through Stanford is one
motive for the drop deadline proposal
according to Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Mason
Yearian, a member of the Ad Hoc
Panel on the Grading System.
Yearian and Panel Chairman
Bradley Efron, a professor of statistics,
discussed the pros and cons of the
proposed grade changes with about 20
people who attended the open forum

Yearian said that many students are
having their education spoiled because
"they're not making their decisions
soon enough."
He pointed out that students would
still have the options of auditing or
taking a course for pass/no credit.
Observing that the pass/no credit
option was designed to encourage
students to take courses they might
not have taken for a grade, Yearian
added, "I think it ought to be used
more for that purpose than it is now."
'Not Clear'
Addressing students expressing
concern about the detrimental effect
of having too many pass grades or
incompletes appearing on transcripts
when applying to graduate school,
Yearian said it's "not clear to me that
grades are everything that go into"
considering a graduate school
applicant.
"It is not at all clear what the
effects of this proposal will be on
grade inflation," he added.
"I don't think grading is going to
change very much," said Efron.
Although the ad hoc panel said it
hopes that the stricter drop deadline
will encourage students to see their
advisors, "I don't think there's any
guarantee in that," Yearian said. He
admitted that part of the problem is
with the advising system, not the
grading system.
'Enough Of A Penalty'
Arguing that students are
responsible enough to decide what is
best for them, a student in the
audience protested that it is "enough
of a penalty" for a student to receive
no credit for a course and that he
should not be penalized further by
having NC appear on his transcript.

resources as another reason for
