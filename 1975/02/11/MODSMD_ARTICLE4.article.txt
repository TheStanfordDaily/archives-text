# Panofsky Optimistic On Funding: 'Congress Not In Cutting Mood'
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) Director Wolfgang Panofsky
expressed optimism last week that
Congress would approve President
Ford's proposal to increase SLAC's
federal funding for next year.
Commenting on the $27.6 million
provision in the proposed 1976 budget
for the Energy Research and
Development Administration,
Panofsky said, "Congress is not in a
cutting mood on scientific and energy

programs now.'
He referred to a "strongly worded"
report by the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy last year, which
criticized the limited funding policy
for high energy physics research of the
federal government over the past few
years. According to that report,
Panofsky said, this restriction of
funding resulted in an inefficient use
of accelerators.
The high fixed cost of running the
basic equipment was just barely
covered by the federal monies, and
growth of new pure research was
essentially curtailed, Panofsky
explained.
The SLAC funding in the proposed
Presidential budget released to the
public last week is an 11.5 percent
increase over this year. If it is
approved, Panofsky said, the increase
"may be large enough to compensate
for the effects of inflation."
Panofsky said he knew "in general
outlines" what the Presidential
proposal contained before the budget
was made public.
SLAC operating costs now average
about $2 million a month, one-third of
which is for "just plain running the

accelerator," according to Panofsky.
Although the University receives a
small overhead allowance for
administrative assistance, the
acceleratc is independent of the
general University budget and is
entirely federally funded.
The increase requested in the
President's budget, Panofsky said, is
"directly related to our research
achievement." He referred to the
subatomic "psi" particle discoveries of
last November at SPEAR (Stanford
Positron-Electron Assymetric Rings), a
colliding beam facility located at the
SLAC complex.
The proposed budget does not
request authorization, however, for
the construction at SLAC of a
Positron-Electron-Proton (PEP)
storage ring, a much larger version of
SPEAR jointly proposed by SLAC and
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
Panofsky said in his talks with
SLAC staff that "unless a major new
project is started soon, it is difficult to
see how our research in this important
field of science can continue to be
competitive with that of Europe and
possibly with that of the Soviet Union
for very long."

Congress would approve President
Ford's proposal to increase SLAC's
federal funding for next year.
Commenting on the $27.6 million
provision in the proposed 1976 budget
for the Energy Research and
Development Administration,
Panofsky said, "Congress is not in a
cutting mood on scientific and energy

programs now.'
He referred to a "strongly worded"
report by the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy last year, which
criticized the limited funding policy
for high energy physics research of the
federal government over the past few
years. According to that report,
Panofsky said, this restriction of
funding resulted in an inefficient use
of accelerators.
The high fixed cost of running the
basic equipment was just barely
covered by the federal monies, and
growth of new pure research was
essentially curtailed, Panofsky
explained.
The SLAC funding in the proposed
Presidential budget released to the
public last week is an 11.5 percent
increase over this year. If it is
approved, Panofsky said, the increase
"may be large enough to compensate
for the effects of inflation."
Panofsky said he knew "in general
outlines" what the Presidential
proposal contained before the budget
was made public.
SLAC operating costs now average
about $2 million a month, one-third of
which is for "just plain running the

accelerator," according to Panofsky.
Although the University receives a
small overhead allowance for
administrative assistance, the
acceleratc is independent of the
general University budget and is
entirely federally funded.
The increase requested in the
President's budget, Panofsky said, is
"directly related to our research
achievement." He referred to the
subatomic "psi" particle discoveries of
last November at SPEAR (Stanford
Positron-Electron Assymetric Rings), a
colliding beam facility located at the
SLAC complex.
The proposed budget does not
request authorization, however, for
the construction at SLAC of a
Positron-Electron-Proton (PEP)
storage ring, a much larger version of
SPEAR jointly proposed by SLAC and
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
Panofsky said in his talks with
SLAC staff that "unless a major new
project is started soon, it is difficult to
see how our research in this important
field of science can continue to be
competitive with that of Europe and
possibly with that of the Soviet Union
for very long."
