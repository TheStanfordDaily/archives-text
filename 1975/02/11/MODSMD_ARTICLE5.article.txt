# Cooperative Grocery To Open In March
## Briarpatch Philosophy Stresses 'Anti-Profit' Service 
### LINDA GRIBBIN 
Briarpatch Cooperative Market, an
"anti-profit" grocery store to be owned and
operated by its members, will open for business
March 5 in Menlo Park, according to co-manager
Bob Luft.
Briarpatch Market will replace the 7-11 store
at 687 Bay Rd.
Briarpatch, calling itself a "direct-charge"
store, is based on a type of cooperative
developed in Canada some 10 years ago. Since
then, more than 100 direct-charge co-ops
have formed in Canada. In California there is a
one-year-old direct-charge store in Isla Vista and
a newer one in West Los Angeles.
Alice Newton, the other co-manager, said,
"Briarpatch is founded on a philosophy of
serving its community rather than profiting. Our
objective is to supply a full range of grocery
items at the lowest possible cost in an
atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation."
Share Ownership
The direct-charge store pays for overhead
expenses — rent, salaries, equipment and
insurance — by a direct levy on each member of
a household. Luft expects the levy to be about
50 cents per week.
In addition, every- member household agrees
to buy a $100 share over an 18-month period,
and each adult member promises to contribute
two hours of labor per month.
Share ownership will entitle the individual or
group to buy groceries at nearly wholesale cost
and to participate in all store policy decisions,
including product selection, Luft explained.
"We encourage student groups to join even if
they can't afford to buy a full share right now,"
said Luft. "They can pay $5 a month for
their membership and get it all back whenever
they leave Stanford."
The market plans to serve at least 300 and
eventually 550 member-households. To date 55
households have signed up. The co-managers said
they expect to have 200 members by the time of
the store's opening. The members represent "a
good cross section of people in Palo Alto and

Menlo Park," Newton said.
The small size of the store will limit the
number of brands of each item, but co-managers
said they expect to have all types of groceries.
Initially, only frozen (rather than fresh) meat will
be available, however. Some foods will be
stocked in bulk form to save on packaging costs.
"We may not have five brands in three sizes of
peanut butter. We'll decide collectively [on
brands] and have only one or two to save
money," Luft said.
The co-managers expect Briarpatch to pool
some of its efforts — such as buying produce and
sharing transportation expenses — with various
food co-ops, or so-cflled "conspiracies" in the
area, like Sangha and Lifestream.
The advantage of Briarpatch over the growing
number of local food co-ops will be that
members will not have to order food in advance
and will be able to choose their own produce,
Luft said.
'Community Spirit'
"We want to create a community spirit. When
you go into Briarpatch you will be shopping with
friends in your store, not somebody else's store,"
he commented.
However, Michael Goldstein, leader of the
Sangha food cooperative, said, "I'm worried that
Briarpatch is not going to be much different than
Co-op Supermarket in that they need so much
capital from each member."
But Luft disagrees. "The Co-op has gone
pretty far from where it began," he said. "It's
trying too much to compete with the Safeway
and in turn becomes more like Safeway. We say
we're not competing with them on their terms."
Judd Reeves, member-operations coordinator
of the Consumers Cooperative Society of Palo
Alto, doesn't see Briarpatch as a threat.
"One of the principles of cooperatives is to
cooperate with cooperatives," said Reeves.
"We're giving Briarpatch every bit of moral and
physical support we can."
Briarpatch will hold a Pre-Opening
Celebration with live entertainment at Walter
Hayes School on Feb. 22 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Menlo Park," Newton said.
The small size of the store will limit the
number of brands of each item, but co-managers
said they expect to have all types of groceries.
Initially, only frozen (rather than fresh) meat will
be available, however. Some foods will be
stocked in bulk form to save on packaging costs.
"We may not have five brands in three sizes of
peanut butter. We'll decide collectively [on
brands] and have only one or two to save
money," Luft said.
The co-managers expect Briarpatch to pool
some of its efforts — such as buying produce and
sharing transportation expenses — with various
food co-ops, or so-cflled "conspiracies" in the
area, like Sangha and Lifestream.
The advantage of Briarpatch over the growing
number of local food co-ops will be that
members will not have to order food in advance
and will be able to choose their own produce,
Luft said.
'Community Spirit'
"We want to create a community spirit. When
you go into Briarpatch you will be shopping with
friends in your store, not somebody else's store,"
he commented.
However, Michael Goldstein, leader of the
Sangha food cooperative, said, "I'm worried that
Briarpatch is not going to be much different than
Co-op Supermarket in that they need so much
capital from each member."
But Luft disagrees. "The Co-op has gone
pretty far from where it began," he said. "It's
trying too much to compete with the Safeway
and in turn becomes more like Safeway. We say
we're not competing with them on their terms."
Judd Reeves, member-operations coordinator
of the Consumers Cooperative Society of Palo
Alto, doesn't see Briarpatch as a threat.
"One of the principles of cooperatives is to
cooperate with cooperatives," said Reeves.
"We're giving Briarpatch every bit of moral and

SAY 'CHEESE'—Bob Luft and Alice Newton,
co-managers of the Briarpatch Cooperative
Market, examine dairy products. The non-profit
store in Menlo Park will open on March 5.
Briarpatch Cooperative Market, an
"anti-profit" grocery store to be owned and
operated by its members, will open for business
March 5 in Menlo Park, according to co-manager
Bob Luft.
Briarpatch Market will replace the 7-11 store
at 687 Bay Rd.
Briarpatch, calling itself a "direct-charge"
store, is based on a type of cooperative
developed in Canada some 10 years ago. Since
then, more than 100 direct-charge co-ops
have formed in Canada. In California there is a
one-year-old direct-charge store in Isla Vista and
a newer one in West Los Angeles.
Alice Newton, the other co-manager, said,
"Briarpatch is founded on a philosophy of
serving its community rather than profiting. Our
objective is to supply a full range of grocery
items at the lowest possible cost in an
atmosphere of mutual trust and cooperation."
Share Ownership
The direct-charge store pays for overhead
expenses — rent, salaries, equipment and
insurance — by a direct levy on each member of
a household. Luft expects the levy to be about
50 cents per week.
In addition, every- member household agrees
to buy a $100 share over an 18-month period,
and each adult member promises to contribute
two hours of labor per month.
Share ownership will entitle the individual or
group to buy groceries at nearly wholesale cost
and to participate in all store policy decisions,
including product selection, Luft explained.
"We encourage student groups to join even if
they can't afford to buy a full share right now,"
said Luft. "They can pay $5 a month for
their membership and get it all back whenever
they leave Stanford."
The market plans to serve at least 300 and
eventually 550 member-households. To date 55
households have signed up. The co-managers said
they expect to have 200 members by the time of
the store's opening. The members represent "a
good cross section of people in Palo Alto and

Menlo Park," Newton said.
The small size of the store will limit the
number of brands of each item, but co-managers
