# Housing Crunch Forces Britain Program Cutback

### CECILE HEROLD 
The Stanford Overseas Studies
Office has been unable to find extra
accommodations for students who
wish to attend the British campus this
summer and are not enrolled in its
special focus program, "Health Care
Delivery and Public Policy."
According to Ray Riggle, assistant
to the director of overseas studies,
accepting students not taking the
program would bring general
enrollment above Cliveden's 80-space
limit. Finding alternative housing for
those students, he said, proved to be
"impossible for financial and other
reasons."
"We are suggesting that students
who will be in Cliveden this spring and
had wished to remain over the summer
quarter consider transferring to
Stanford-in-Italy. The language
prerequisite for some Cliveden
transfers as well as for those students
specially enrolled in the archeology
program will be waived on a one-time
basis only."
Riggle added, however, that a
beginning language course would be

required in Florence and he advised
students to come to the Overseas
Office to learn more about Florence's
course offerings summer quarter.
A sampling of courses offered this
summer in Cliveden includes, besides
the Archeology Focus Program,
Etruscan and Roman Art and Culture,
Contemporary Italian Politics,
Post-World War II Italy, and Modern
Astronomy.
An alternative plan suggested by
Riggle is for spring quarter Cliveden
students to work and travel over the
summer and then re-apply, if possible,
in the fall, when they will be given
special priority.
"All Cliveden students will be
receiving notices shortly describing the
campus' summer situation and its
effects upon currently-enrolled
students," he explained.
Speaking about Cliveden's special
program this summer, Riggle remarked
that it was "the first overseas
curriculum ever designed especially for
pre-med majors, although it has
attracted social science and humanities
majors as well."
