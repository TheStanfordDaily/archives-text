# Wider Range Needed

To the current discussion of "grade
inflation" here I should like to add a
few words. According to the Study of
Education at Stanford report on
indergraduate education, the first
students who came to the University
in the 1890s received only two
categories of grade: "pass" or "fail."
That system, we are told, gave way
to the familiarletter-grade designations
"in response to student demands for
more precise evaluation of work."
It seems that those pioneer students
who stalked the skeletal Quadrangle
had a clearer vision of what a grading
system was all about f .han do their
legatees of the 70s.
Grades should serve two broad
purposes. They should first tell the
student about the quality of his work,
and about the relation of his work to
that of his classmates. In this sense
they are, it seems to me, an
indispensable part of the educational
process, which should impart to the
student as precise a sense as possible of
his capacities, his strengths and his
weaknesses, and his relative abilities

Second, grades indicate those same
factors to others who must make
necessarily discriminating judgments
about people's qualifications.
The present situation here, where
grades tend to be gathered at one end
of what is in the first place a very
narrow range of categories, subverts
both those purposes.
It diminishes the student's ability
to profit from his undergraduate
education by coming to a better sense
of himself and his particular
intellectual qualities. It further
undermines the utility of the
grade-record to others, and thus
ironically tends to negate the benefits
that many naively assume to flow
automatically from a "good"
transcript.
This has quite forseeable
consequences; it means that in those
decisions where both aptitude and past
achievement are relevant factors, the
former will assume greater importance,
because of the sameness in the records
of the latter.
In practical terms, such a
development cannot help but make
ordeals like the LSAT, MCAT and
ORE even more crucial and hence
traumatic than they already are. On
the surface at least, it would seem that
any system needs overhauling which
tends to force greater weight to be
placed on one afternoon's or
morning's performance instead of on
the record of four years' work.
It should be noted that the problem
as I see it consists not so much in the
inflaiion of grades as it does in their
concentration. We would face the
same liabilities if, for some mysterious
reason, grades clustered in the C
range.
The object should be, within
human limits, to be as precise as
possible, which means having a
reasonable range of categories by
which to designate the quality of work
and using all those categories.
There need not be any rigid,
pre determined formula or "curve" to
distribute grades over a given
spectrum, but professors and students
alike should realize the disservice that
is done by homogenization.
