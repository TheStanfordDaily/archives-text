# Bring Back Historical Record

Grades — we all get them. The
higher they are, the better, right? Well,
not exactly. What most students here
(myself included) want is a high grade
point average. And there is a
difference at Stanford, you know.
That s because the University chose
in 1970 to replace an "historical
record" of students' grades with a
so-called "record of accomplishment."
The "record of accomplishment" is
what our transcripts show today. What
those transcripts don't indicate,
however, is how often students fail to
pass a course — and somehow, that
doesn't seem quite right. Such a record
simply does not present an accurate
appraisal of the work students do.
My colleagues at the Daily tell me
that the "record of accomplishment"
allows for freer curricular
experimentation. Courses which are
either quite difficult or outside a
student's area of expertise can be
dropped just before the final, or
intentionally "failed" (each with
impunity) if the student decides he
can't handle the work.
My colleagues warn that returning
to an "historical record," under which
"no-credits" were included on
transcripts, would discourage
experimentation, because students
would be afraid of not passing.
Hard To Fail
But there are a number of problems
with this argument. First, it is (and
always has been) extremely difficult
for a student here not to pass a course.
Unless the course in question is an
advanced class in a very unfamiliar
field, a student must literally try not
to pass, by either ignoring the readings
or failing to attend the lectures, or
both.
Given the difficulty of receiving a
"no-credit," it would seem that the
worst a student experimenting with a
difficult course could do would be to
get a C. And that's the worst thing
that can happen today, even with the
"record of accomplishment."
In addition, the current grade
recording system may, in many cases,
encourage irresponsibility, rather than
curricular experimentation, by
students. If a student so desires, he can
goof off all quarter long, wasting the
professor's time, as well as his own,
and escape anything worse than an NC
on his "report card" — an NC which
never appears on his permanent
record.
Intentional No-Credit
Other students will drop a course at
the last minute, or intentionally take a
"no-credit," simply to avoid receiving
a C — which has become the bogy man
among grades now that Stanford no
longer permanently records
"no-credits."
Students here complain constantly
that the University treats them like
children, rather than like adults. Yet,
most of them support the current
"record of accomplishment" system
which lulls them into childlike security
by seeming to tell them that, here at

Stanford, they will not suffer any
consequences if they fail to act in the
responsible manner expected of adults.
The current grade recording system,
therefore, encourages numerous,
widespread abuses which make it
almost impossible to gauge reliably
what a student's academic
performance here has been. So, a 3.4
grade point average (or letter grade
indicator, as the Registrar's Office calls
it) can be pretty meaningless if a
student relies upon such crutches as
intentional "no-credits" to maintain
the average at an artificially high level.
Apparently, then, the supporters of
the "record of accomplishment" don't
feel that grades should mean very
much. And if that's the case, why not
eliminate grades altogether — and
abandon the charade we're currently
acting out?
Not Likely
But that doesn't seem very likely,
so all we have to work with are the
current "record of accomplishment"
and the "historical record."
One other fault of the current
system — the fault which has raised
more interest than any other — is the
grade inflation which it has apparently
contributed to. Admittedly, other
universities which operate under the
"historical record" system are having
the same trouble, but that doesn't
mean that Stanford shouldn't deal
decisively with each part of its own
problem.
The "record of accomplishment"
system has forced professors here into
a position where three-fourths of the
grades they give As and Bs, and
only eight percent are Cs. As statistics
Prof. Bradley Efron, who chairs the
Ad Hoc Panel to Study the Grading
System, noted last autumn: "Barely
any Cs are given any more because
that's the worst grade now and

professors feel bad about giving it."
Returning to the "historical
record" system — with its permanently
recorded "no-credits" — would ease
professors' consciences when they
hand out more Cs, which are, after all,
indications ol' "satisfactory
performance." And that's hardly a
crime.
So more Cs would be given under
the "historical record" system. Taking
into account the minimal number of
recorded "no-credits" that would be
given, this would tend to reduce the
typical student's CiPA. And that, in
turn, would provide a more realistic
picture of the student's academic
performance.
The case seems clear, therefore, for
adoption of the Efron Panel's
proposals to restore the recorded
"no-credit" grade and to reinstate a
drop deadline for classes. With this
"historical record," we'll all still get
grades, but at least they'll mean a little
more.
