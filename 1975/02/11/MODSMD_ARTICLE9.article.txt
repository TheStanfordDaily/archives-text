# No Credit Notation Harmful
## 
### 
Debate about the grading system is
one of those issues which crops up
every couple of years on most
campuses. Yet, due to the great
diversity of opinions on grading, rarely
are substantive changes made in
institutional grading policies. The
unusual did occur here five years ago,
however, when a significant switch was
made from the conventional Aâ€”F
grading model to the current system in
which no grade lower than C is
recorded.
Now a proposal to "fine tune" or
"tinker with" (depending on your
perspective) the grading system has
been made. This recommendation
comes from the Ad Hoc Panel on the
Grading System which was charged
with reviewing the policy currently in
effect and suggesting continuance or
changes in it. The panel made a
number of recommendations, the most
important being the addition of a new
grade (No Credit) to those currently

used (A, B, C).
It seems logical to begin a
discussion of grades and the grading
system with a review of the purpose of
such a system. Students come to
college to learn and the certification
that learning is taking place is one of
the responsibilities of an educational
institution. A college degree is, of
course, one form of certification. The
degree signifies that those receiving it
have satisfied certain requirements and
demonstrated an acceptable level of
competence in certain areas.
Grades are another component of
the certification process. They allow
for categorical discrimination among
various levels of competence and also
can be used to signify a lack of
satisfactory competence (F, NC, etc.).
Signify Competence
It is quite obvious that grades are a
shorthand method of signifying
competence. Although the University
has a general definition for each grade,
e.g. B means superior work, the
variability among courses and the
current phenomenon of grade inflation
makes it difficult to infer student
subject matter competence from
grades.
Furthermore, it is obvious that a
grade, for example a B+, can not
encapsulate a description of the
knowledge a student has acqrired in a
particular course.
Hence, as a form of feedback to
students, grades are totally inadequate.
To the extent that they are used for
this purpose, grades become part of a
charade between teacher and student
and understandably tend to become
the object of students' attention
instead of the learning of subject
matter itself.
More Difficulties
From this perspective, grades
probably cause more difficulties than
they resolve. Their major benefit
seems to lie in providing a shorthand
notation of student competence to
various selection agencies. Yet,
although grades are certainly used by
such agencies as part of their sorting
out process, there is significant doubt
about their ability to predict later
success.
Given these considerations, it
would be helpful to examine the
proposed addition of the NC grade
with a brief analysis of its likely
educational benefit to students here.
The ad hoc panel has justified its
recommendation for the NC grade
primarily on the basis that since the
transcript often serves as the vehicle
by which student competence is
assessed, it should include all data
about student academic success, the
negative as well as the positive.
This "historical record" approach,
of course, is diametrically at odds with
the "record of accomplishment"
approach and the arguments for both
are well developed in the report of the
ad hoc panel.
Recommendations 111-Advised
I think that the panel's
recommendation is ill-advised for three
reasons.
First, it confuses the speed of
mastering a subject matter with the

understanding which a student derives
from a course of study. We know that
people learn at different rates and the
fostering of learning is a prime
objective of the University.
Yet the punitive approach
supported by a majority of the panel
insists that a student's lack 01
competence in a particular field should
be clearly documented through the no
credit grade in order to present the
"complete picture" of his or her
academic performance.
If we are truly concerned about
developing student skills and abilities,
why should we imprint their
inadequacies upon their permanent
record?

The introduction of the no credit
grade is also likely to discourage
students from taking difficult courses.
Many people are becoming justifiably
concerned about the trend toward
students specializing in narrow
pre-professional tracks.
College should be a time to expand
one's intellectual horizons. Yet the no
credit penalty will inhibit students
from exploring academic domains
completely unfamiliar to them.
There is another significant
problem with the recommendation for
the adoption of a no credit grade. It
has been pointed out on many
occasions that one can be a successful
student without being a successful
learner.
There is a good deal of academic
gamesmanship practiced by students
and sometimes the system reinforces
this. For some students, getting
through a course with a good grade or
without a poor one becomes the
dominant goal.
The greater the number of
procedural hurdles and pitfalls on the
route to course completion, the
greater the likelihood that students
will concentrate on their successful
negotiation rather than on learning the
intricacies of the subject matter. Even
with grade inflation, there is a lot of
concern among students about grades
and the adoption of the no credit
grade would simply add to their
worries.
The proposed change is likely to
detract from the development of a
positive learning environment. It is not
only punitive but miseducative and
should not be adopted.
