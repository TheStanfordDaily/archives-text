ESCONDIDO VILLAGE HAS A PROBLEM
And it has to do with parking fines and going to
court. What are you going to do if you lose? Even
if you win, what about next year? Can't we come
up with a better system? One that avoids hassles?
Can we stand all those cars
and all that asphalt?
STUDENTS, THIS IS YOUR DAY TO BE HEARD.
I've been asked to re-examine the parking and transportation
system and recommend changes. To do this, I need your input
There will be a public meeting today at 7:30 in the E.V. Center
to hear your ideas. Everyone is welcome, but I especially want
to hear from the Escondido Village Residents.
This is your opportunity to be heard. Make use
of it.
