# Schlafly: ERA A Needless Fight
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Proponents of the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA) are fighting a
battle that has already been won by
attempting to tie "a constitutional
noose around our necks," Phyllis
Schlafly, a leading opponent of the
measure, said last night.
Speaking to a capacity crowd of
500 in Cubberley Auditorium,
Schlafly attacked "the startling
assumption that women in this
country are serfs, chattel and not even
treated as persons under the
Constitution."
Schlafly said, "American women
are better off than any class of people
anywhere in the world" because they
can choose to stay at home and be
supported by their husbands, enter the
work force or do both.
Schlafly cited an 1875 Supreme
Court ruling that women are persons
with all rights except the right to vote.
Because the 19th Amendment later
extended the franchise to women "the
proponents of the ERA are 50 years
behind the times," she said.
'No Affirmative Case'
ERA leaders recite a litany of
problems solved in the past and resort
to "smear campaigns" because they
have no affirmative case listing the
additional rights the ERA will give to
women, Schlafly charged.
She said the Equal Opportunity
Employment Act of 1972 already
guarantees equal pay for equal work.
"The ERA won't do anything for
women in the field of employment,"
she added.
Other recent legislation bans

discrimination against women in the
granting of credit and in education,
Schlafly said. She said the Educational
Amendments Act of 1972, including
the controversial Title IX, is an
example of a law "that sounds like
everyone should be for it. But when it
gets in the hands of the bureaucrats,
it's something else again."
'Bars Exemptions'
The legislators did not plan to deny
freedom of choice for persons who
wish to attend single-sex schools or
join fraternities or sororities that
discriminate on the basis of sex, "so
they added a quickie amendment,"
Schlafly said. "But if the ERA is
ratified any exemptions would be
constitutionally impermissible."
Schlafly said the ERA might give
women "rights" they don't want or
take away privileges they already have.
She cited these examples:
—the military, in which women
receive equal rank and pay with men
but are exempt from combat duty.
Applause and cheering followed
Schlafly's statement that "Every
18-year-old girl would be required to
report to her local draft board." She
said standards for combat duty would
have to be changed so women could
qualify.
—in the family, where women
would suffer the double burden of
child-bearing and earning half the
household's financial support;
—in industry, where protective
labor legislation restricts the hours
women may work and sets limits on
physical labor by women in some
states.
Schlafly is the leader of an
organization called STOP the Equal
Rights Amendment. She has testified
against the measure at many state
legislative hearings, including those of
all 17 states that have rejected it.
With ratification by 38 states
needed for the amendment to take
effect, 31 states already have
approved. Nebraska and Tennessee
first ratified it and later rescinded their
approval.

History Prof. Carl Degler and Rita
Ricardo Campbell, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institute, appeared as
panelists and sharply disagreed with
Schlafly's belief that existing
legislation makes the ERA
unnecessary.
"It is difficult to answer all the
half-truths that were presented" by
Schlafly, Campbell said. She offered
examples of legislation which restricts
women as individual decision-makers,
such as labor laws and military

restrictions.
Degler, a Pulitzer Prize-winner who
is writing a history of women and the
American family, stressed the
importance of providing equal
opportunity for women. He supported
the ERA but said it would not cause a
revolution in the status of women
"any more than the 14th or 15th
Amendment revolutionized race
relations. After 100 years we are still
struggling" to ban racial
discrimination, Degler said.

—in the family, where women
would suffer the double burden of
child-bearing and earning half the

labor legislation restricts the hours
women may work and sets limits on
physical labor by women in some
states.
Schlafly is the leader of an
organization called STOP the Equal

against the measure at many state
legislative hearings, including those of

With ratification by 38 states
needed for the amendment to take

first ratified it and later rescinded their

History Prof. Carl Degler and Rita
Ricardo Campbell, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institute, appeared as
panelists and sharply disagreed with
Schlafly's belief that existing
legislation makes the ERA
unnecessary.
"It is difficult to answer all the
half-truths that were presented" by
Schlafly, Campbell said. She offered
examples of legislation which restricts
women as individual decision-makers,
such as labor laws and military

restrictions.
Degler, a Pulitzer Prize-winner who
is writing a history of women and the
American family, stressed the
importance of providing equal
opportunity for women. He supported
the ERA but said it would not cause a
revolution in the status of women
"any more than the 14th or 15th
Amendment revolutionized race
relations. After 100 years we are still
struggling" to ban racial
discrimination, Degler said.

Women audience members watched warily as Phyllis Schlafly (center) spoke against ERA at Cubberley last night.
Proponents of the Equal Rights
Amendment (ERA) are fighting a
battle that has already been won by
attempting to tie "a constitutional
noose around our necks," Phyllis
Schlafly, a leading opponent of the
measure, said last night.
Speaking to a capacity crowd of
500 in Cubberley Auditorium,
Schlafly attacked "the startling
assumption that women in this
country are serfs, chattel and not even
treated as persons under the
Constitution."
Schlafly said, "American women
are better off than any class of people
anywhere in the world" because they
can choose to stay at home and be
supported by their husbands, enter the
work force or do both.
Schlafly cited an 1875 Supreme
Court ruling that women are persons
with all rights except the right to vote.
Because the 19th Amendment later
extended the franchise to women "the
proponents of the ERA are 50 years
behind the times," she said.
'No Affirmative Case'
ERA leaders recite a litany of
problems solved in the past and resort
to "smear campaigns" because they
have no affirmative case listing the
additional rights the ERA will give to
women, Schlafly charged.
She said the Equal Opportunity
Employment Act of 1972 already
guarantees equal pay for equal work.
"The ERA won't do anything for
women in the field of employment,"
she added.
Other recent legislation bans

discrimination against women in the
granting of credit and in education,
Schlafly said. She said the Educational
Amendments Act of 1972, including
the controversial Title IX, is an
example of a law "that sounds like
everyone should be for it. But when it
gets in the hands of the bureaucrats,
it's something else again."
'Bars Exemptions'
The legislators did not plan to deny
freedom of choice for persons who
wish to attend single-sex schools or
join fraternities or sororities that
discriminate on the basis of sex, "so
they added a quickie amendment,"
Schlafly said. "But if the ERA is
ratified any exemptions would be
constitutionally impermissible."
Schlafly said the ERA might give
women "rights" they don't want or
take away privileges they already have.
She cited these examples:
—the military, in which women
receive equal rank and pay with men
