## Dollies: Dancin' And Diggin' It Personalities Plus 
### Steve Hefter 
Stanford's Dollies are unique.
At most schools across the
country you find female
cheerleaders who yell "two, four,
six, eight," and bounce up and
down like spastic beach balls
without knowing who's got the
ball or which team of Timmys is
winning.
They have cheers for
everything from a jock-strap rip to
a Gatorade break.
And at some schools you even
find male cheerleaders who
pounce on each other's shoulders
and contort somersaults while
rolling in the grass with white
Sta-prest slacks and Thom McAn
underwear, if there is such a thing.
These are the inconsequent
muckamucks who spend the day
clapping hands and smilin<*

Pepsodent smiles that are likely to
bring the flying trapeze, dancing
bears and Barnum himself to their
gridiron circus.
But not so with the Dollies.
The Dollies Are Fun
The Dollies are dancers.
They're five talented,
hard-working girls, who, along
with the Band, are perhaps as
much a part of any football game
as the players themselves.
And the Dollies are fun.
They're fun to look at and they're
fun to watch. And there is a
distinction.
As you may have noticed, the
Dollies are good-looking. But
there shouldn't be anything wrong
with that. Ugly people can do
other things, like write for
newspapers or deliver pizzas.
The Dollies, along with the
band, bring decorous
entertainment to football and
basketball games. Their act may
look easy, but the preparation is
as strenuous as any full season of
double sessions.
"During Big Game week alone,
we put in more than 70 hours of
work," says sophomore Linda
Buddenberg. "We hardly ever
went to class. Loretta [Dolly
Loretta Churchill] only went to
two classes all week."
No Female Jack Christiansen
It's no small wonder. The
Dollies are responsible for making
up all their routines. This year
alone, they've created over 50
original choreographies.
And contrary to what one
might suspect, there's no "Dolly
coach" or female Jack
Christiansen to call the moves.

The five girls are it.
"We decide among ourselves
what steps we'll use," says Denise
Gallardo. "We spend a lot of time
at band rehearsals listening to the
charts [songs] that will be played
the coming week."
The Dollies consider
themselves part of the Band. They
know that they can't go anywhere
the Incomparable doesn't go, and
they really wouldn't care to.
"I like working with something
as unique as the Stanford Band,"
gloats junior Terry Bowman.
"There's nothing like them."
The girls see themselves and
the band as an important part of a
football game.
10 Years Of Ballet
"We're the entertainment,"
smiles Linda. "And we enjoy it."
Terry looks upon the whole
thing a little differently. She's a
member of the women's swim
team and for her, dancing and
being a Dolly is like another
sport.
"I view it as a sport," she says.
"It's like competing in women's
hockey or ballet. It has dance and
it has rhythm."
"Sports can be entertaining
and they can be physically hard,
and this is physically hard."
Denise nods. "We're using up
more calories on a Saturday
afternoon than a lot of the
football players."
And Denise has had more
practice dancing than a lot of
players have had at running or
blocking. She's had 10 years of
tap dancing, eight years of ballet,
and four years of jazz. That's
dedication.

"This is something you can
really get into," she says. "There's
creativity as well as a lot of
practice."
A Male Dolly
Denise, as well as the other
girls, love what they do, primarily
because they love dancing. Yet
they still get the proverbial hassles
from some loquacious libbers.
And so the proverbial question
was asked.
"We're just one more facet of
the football game," answers
Linda. "The football players are
out there exploiting themselves,
the Band's exploiting themselves,
and we're exploiting ourselves.
We're dancers."
Linda smiles. She always
smiles.
"You know," she says,"the
first day I went to my psychology
of sex roles class, the teacher said,
'Think about what would happen
if you woke up tomorrow and
found that you were a member of
the opposite sex.' And I went, 'Oh
my god; a male Dolly.'
"I guess there is a little sexist
element to it. But you just have to
accept it. You accept it because
you like to dance."
The Dollies often spend about

two nights a week eating at the
training table with the football
team or the basketball team. It
may or may not help the players
get in shape, but it's interesting
nonetheless.
"You come to the training
table and they start looking you
over," says Terry. "So you just
start looking them over."
Hilda Hutcherson, whose
boyfriend is on the football team,
pouts with jest and tells it like it
is, "Football players really ham it
up.
"Walking around with their
letter jackets on. . . We don't walk
around with our boots on all
day."
Denise jumps in. "They're
there to do their job and we're
there to do our job. Some people
get bored and we're there to
entertain them.
"We're not necessarily rah rah
for the team. Wf represent
Stanford at alumni affairs and
other events, not jus, athletics.
And of athletic events, alumni
affairs and other rallies, for Linda,

"post-game at football is best."
"I like boogeyin' and dancin'
after the games. There's no
problem getting into it. You're
having a good time and so is
everyone else."
"Another time when we really
get into our dancing," adds Hilda,
"is like in Oregon and Berkeley
when they start booing us. That
just gives us more incentive. We
really kick our butts off."
Being a Dolly is, in Terry's
words "special." And there are
lots of girls wanting the job. This
year, about 70 girls have come to
the clinics to learn the routines
before tryouts on Feb. 20. And
Hilda tells them what they should
do.
"Move those pelvis bones," she
yells. "That's the part people like
to look at."
Hilda knows it and doesn't
deny it. "You see guys smiling
and you know what they're
thinking," she says. But any girl
dancer anyplace is doing the same
thing. And she knows it.
"And when a guy sees a girl

dance — whether she's a Dolly or
not — he's going to look at the
same places.
"But that's what we are; we're
dancers. At the Penn State game
[nationally televised] the
cameramen kept asking us for a
cheer. But we don't do that. We
just get down and boogie ."
Gettin' down and boogeyin' is
what being a Dolly can be all
about. If people see more or less
in it, that's their problem; or their
pleasure. But as far as this year's
Dollies are concerned . . .
"I love it,"says Terry. And as
Linda tells the newcomers,
"Laugh and look like you're
having a good time." As for
Linda, she's always laughing and
having a good time. For Linda,
and the rest of the Dollies, it's
simple.
"It's all right now."

AIN'T THEY SWEET—"I view it as a sport," says Terry Bowman (left), comparing being a Dolly to her
swimming for the women's team. The rest of the Stanford Dollies, Denise Gallardo, Hilda Hutcherson,
Linda Buddenberg, Loretta Churchill, as well as Terry, may not wear their boots all day, every day, but
when they do — they boogie.
