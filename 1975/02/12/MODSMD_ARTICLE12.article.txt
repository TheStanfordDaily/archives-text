## Pro Prognosis No More Mr. Nice Guy 
### Glenn Garvin 
Dear Dan:
Well, no more Mr. Nice Guy
Garvin for your readers. From now
on they'll have to put up with
your scathing invective. All those
people who've gotten accustomed
to sensitive, genteel commentary
on this page every Wednesday will
just have to go elsewhere for it.
But I have every confidence
that your bitter, insult-filled prose
will be a huge success with the
readers, once they've adjusted to
the fact that my gentle, clever
writing will no longer grace this
space. Most Stanford students are
masochists: after all, they keep
going back to Maples Pavilion
week after week.
But let me offer you a few bits
of wisdom on writing a column,
based on my long (at least it
seemed that way) experience in
the area.
1. Don't be disturbed if the
number of death threats hovers
around two or three a week at
first. Once people build up an
identification with your style and
start reading you every week,
they'll reach their normal level of
200 a day. You'll have to start
carrying a gun.
2. You'll find the readers are
very sensitive, and their feelings
are easily hurt. So avoid subjects
which they are liable to take
seriously, like the number of cows
in Bernalillo County, New
Mexico. Deal with less
controversial subjects that will
still amuse and entertain your
audience without offending its
sensibilities.
3. As a regular columnist,
you'll find yourself in an
interesting dilemma. If you say
anything nice about anyone,
people will accuse you of hero
worship. If you say anything
nasty about anyone — no matter
how cretinous he is — a lot of
other people will write you with
reports of new and exotic tortures
they intend to inflict on you the
first time you leave the building
by yourself. Good luck.
4. Someone called here a
month or two ago and offered to
bet $50 that Bobby Bonds will
have a better season than Bobby
Murcer. I, of course, accepted.
But since you're the new pro
columnist, it's now your bet.
Good luck again.
5. Be especially careful before
attacking people like Mike
Marshall. It seems that those
figures who exhibit the most
utterly asinine behavior — in

Marshall's case, refusing to be
interviewed or give autographs —
have the most fans. Lots of people
look up to Marshall, apparently
because they think it's courageous
to act like a silly ass in front of
millions of people. Perhaps
they're right, although I suspect it
depends more on a lack of brains.
6. Somewhere out there is one
lunatic who reads the column and
delights in answering all the trivia
questions. For instance, if you ask
rhetorically how many triples Phil
Linz hit in 1964 to illustrate some
point you're trying to make, this
guy will inevitably write in and
tell you. So try and work in things
for him occasionally, since he's
the only person at Stanford you
can depend on not to send you
hate mail. I suggest the following:
how many times did Jim Bouton
lose his cap during the third game
of the 1964 World Series? How
many people played right field for
the 1955 St. Louis Browns? And
which horse that ran in the 1949
Kentucky Derby later turned out
to be pregnant?
7. Avoid women brandishing
tennis rackets.
8. Don't come into the office
on Wednesdays, unless you want
to spend all afternoon answering

phone calls from people asking
how you could be so stupid. Let
the rest of the staff do it. That's
what they get paid for.
9. I've done my best to build up
the proper image for the San
Francisco Giants and 49ers. It's
taken me a lot of hard work, so
please don't go tearing the whole
thing down by running a favorable
column on either of them.
Remember that even when their
respective front offices do
something that looks right —
which is practically never — it will
inevitably turn out wrong.
10. Lots of people wrote in
with nominations for their own
all-time All-Slime team. A lot of
them complained that Scoop
Jackson, Ted Kennedy and
Marilyn Baker weren't on the list.
Why don't you have a contest,
and name the winners in a couple
of weeks?
Well, that's about all the advice
I can give you. You might do a
story on Billie Jean King if you
want to liven things up right
away. And if you ask me nicely,
I'll tell you what I really think of
her instead of that sugar-coated
piece I wrote a few weeks ago.
Then you can get started off right.
Bye.
Glenn
