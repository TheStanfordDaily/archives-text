The Stanford wrestling team
lost a iough 21-20 decision to San
Jose last night as the Spartan
wrestlers dominated the lower
weight classes to make off with
the win.
Four front line wrestlers,
Malcolm Scott, Bob Keating, Ken
Krebs and Art Estrada watched
the match from the sidelines as
San Jose won the contest's first
four matches.
"We had some problems in the
lower weights last night," coach
Joe DeMeo said after the contest.
"If we had our first team in, we
would have won the match. They
wrestled theirs and that was the
difference."
DeMeo was cheered, however,
by the performance of freshman
Gary Lynn, who defeated the
Spartan's highly regarded Dean
Prescott 11-9. "I was very happy
with Gary's performance
tonight," DeMeo enthused. "He
beat their best wrestler — the
captain of the San Jose team."

Although bested in the lower
weights, Stanford proved tough in
the last six matches, winning four
of them and gaining a draw in
another.
Chris Horpel recorded another
pin at 150, ending his match with
Mike Snipes in the second round.
Craig Reynolds almost outdid his
All-American teammate as he too
was credited with a pin in the
second round.
Stanford's Roy Tolles and
Mike Rodriquez drew at 177
while John Govea, who moved up
from 190 to heavyweight for the
match, decisioned Nick DeLong
4-3.

Golf
Round One of the annual
Stanford-San Jose State battle for
Bay Area golf supremacy went to
San Jose State yesterday, as the
Spartans defeated Stanford and
three other teams at the
University of California
Invitational in Berkeley.
Paced by Scott Hoyt's even-par

71 and Don Thames' 72, San Jose
State compiled a 292 team total,
two shots ahead of the Cards.
Sacramento State finished third at
304, followed by Cal
State-Hayward and the host Bears,
each with 310.
Stanford's low scorer was Aly
Trompas, who tied Thames for
second at 72. Dave Bask ins carded
a 73 to finish in a third-place tie
with Mike Bauter of Sacramento
State, while Conrad Nilmeier shot
74 and Jay Johnston contributed
a 75. Stanford's non-counting
scores were Mike Peck (76) and
Mike Mcßride (81).

Stanford's JV basketball coach,
Percy Carr, was asked if any of
the Cards played particularly well
in yesterday's 84-77 loss to the
San Jose State JV's (15-6) at San
Jose State. "No," he said.

It was that kind of day.
Stanford took plenty of shots
(82), but hit only 27. And you
don't win many games shooting
33 percent. "That was the game,"
Carr said. "We had the shots but
they weren't falling for us. We
missed 20 shots from within five
feet I of the basket |."
The loss snapped Stanford's
five-game win streak and dropped
its record to 6-4. Husky Sven
Walker, who looks about as fitting
on the basketball court as Richard
Nixon would on To Tell The
Truth, led all scorers with 23
points.
Yesterdays game was
Stanford's fourth straight on the
road, but six of its eight remaining
games will be at Maples Pavilion,
starting with Menlo College at 6
p.m. P'riday and UC Santa Cruz
at the same time Saturday.

by the performance of freshman
Gary Lynn, who defeated the
Spartan's highly regarded Dean
Prescott 11-9. "I was very happy
with Gary's performance
tonight," DeMeo enthused. "He
beat their best wrestler — the
captain of the San Jose team."

Although bested in the lower
weights, Stanford proved tough in
the last six matches, winning four
of them and gaining a draw in
another.
Chris Horpel recorded another
pin at 150, ending his match with
Mike Snipes in the second round.
Craig Reynolds almost outdid his
All-American teammate as he too
was credited with a pin in the
second round.

from 190 to heavyweight for the
match, decisioned Nick DeLong
4-3.

Golf
Round One of the annual
Stanford-San Jose State battle for
Bay Area golf supremacy went to
San Jose State yesterday, as the
Spartans defeated Stanford and
three other teams at the
University of California
Invitational in Berkeley.
Paced by Scott Hoyt's even-par

71 and Don Thames' 72, San Jose
State compiled a 292 team total,
two shots ahead of the Cards.
Sacramento State finished third at
304, followed by Cal
State-Hayward and the host Bears,
each with 310.
Stanford's low scorer was Aly
Trompas, who tied Thames for
second at 72. Dave Bask ins carded
a 73 to finish in a third-place tie
with Mike Bauter of Sacramento
State, while Conrad Nilmeier shot
74 and Jay Johnston contributed
a 75. Stanford's non-counting
scores were Mike Peck (76) and

Stanford's JV basketball coach,
Percy Carr, was asked if any of
the Cards played particularly well
in yesterday's 84-77 loss to the
San Jose State JV's (15-6) at San
Jose State. "No," he said.

It was that kind of day.
Stanford took plenty of shots
(82), but hit only 27. And you
don't win many games shooting
33 percent. "That was the game,"
Carr said. "We had the shots but
they weren't falling for us. We
missed 20 shots from within five
feet I of the basket |."
The loss snapped Stanford's
five-game win streak and dropped
its record to 6-4. Husky Sven
Walker, who looks about as fitting
on the basketball court as Richard
Nixon would on To Tell The
Truth, led all scorers with 23
points.
Yesterdays game was
Stanford's fourth straight on the
road, but six of its eight remaining
games will be at Maples Pavilion,
starting with Menlo College at 6
p.m. P'riday and UC Santa Cruz
at the same time Saturday.

the win.
Four front line wrestlers,

San Jose won the contest's first
four matches.
"We had some problems in the
