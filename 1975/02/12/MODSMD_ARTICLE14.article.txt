# Cards Lose Game In Ninth Inning
## 
### TOM GALLIGAN 
The ninth inning blues struck
the Stanford baseball team
yesterday as the Cards dropped a
5-4 decision to Santa Clara.
The Broncos, trailing most of
the game, exploded for three runs
in the top of the ninth and then
held off the persistent Cardinals,
who added a run of their own.
The loss was Stanford's first of
the season, dropping their record
to 2-1.
Catcher Dave Baker opened the
scoring in Stanford's half of the
first inning. Baker walked, went
to third on an errant pick-off
attempt and scored on first
baseman Tom Guardino's ground
out.
Santa Clara took the lead in
the third. With one out, they
reached Card starter John Yandle
for two hits. Both were singles,
but an unsuccessful attempt to get
the lead runner at third allowed
the batter to move to second.
Great Catch
Bronco shortstop Mike Bartell
ripped into a Yandle fastball, and
set it to deep left-center field.
Card Bruce Robinson came out of
nowhere to make a one-handed
catch, but crashed into the
collapsible outfield fence. He

flipped the ball to centerfielder
Pepe Hinojosa who fired it back
into the infield, but both Bronco
baserunners tagged up and scored.
Shutout Pitching
Al Arthur came on to pitch for
the Cards in the sixth, and held
Santa Clara scoreless through the
eighth. Stanford could not add to
its score.
In the ninth, Arthur was
relieved by Ed Matta, who walked
the first batter he faced. Matta
gave up an infield single to the
next batter and then a bunt single
to load the bases. He struck out
the following man and got two
strikes on Bartell, but the Bronco
shortstop poked a double to right,
driving in two runs. A sacrifice fly
scored the fifth Santa Clara run
before Matta retired the side.
The Cards valiantly attempted
to come back, but fell short. With
two outs Hinojosa walked, and
then scored on a double by
Pitchford to right. Dave Baker
ended the game with a fly to
shallow center.
