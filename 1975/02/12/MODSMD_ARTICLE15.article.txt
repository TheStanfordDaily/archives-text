Woman Elected British Party Leader
LONDON — Margaret Thatcher, a grocer's daughter with
the reputation of a political battler, was elected leader of
Britain's Conservative Party yesterday. Women from both
the Conservative and Labor parties hailed it as an historic
victory.
With national elections possible at any time before 1979,
Thatcher would become Britain's first woman prime
minister if her party toppled Prime Minister Harold Wilson's
Labor Party.
That would give Britain both a woman head of
government and a woman monarch as head of state. As
prime minister, Thatcher would be the principal adviser to
Queen Elizabeth 11.
Ford Releases Highway Funds
TOPEKA, Kan. — President Ford, after freeing $2 billion
in federal highway funds to spur employment and combat
recession, declared last night. "I don't have any second
thoughts ... I don't have any regrets" about his energy and
economic proposals.
Ford also said he would propose an energy-related tax
rebate to help farmers.
Administration officials said the scope of the rebate
program hadn't been decided yet.
But they said one possible way to handle the program
would yield a rebate of 15 cents for every gallon of gasoline

used on the farm.
Number Of U.S. Bombers Reduced
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense James R.
Schlesinger said yesterday that because of the unlikelihood
of a surprise nuclear attack by the Soviet Union, he is
reducing the number of U.S. strategic bombers held on
full-time alert.
Schlesinger said 30 percent instead of 40 percent of the
American fleet of 415 852 bombers would remain on alert
to insure they were in the air by the time any enemy
missiles hit Strategic Air Command bases.
The defense secretary said a Soviet surprise attack "out
of the blue" is "quite unlikely under the current
circumstances."
U.S. Vows No Israeli Sellout
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
said last night that another step toward an Israeli-Egyptian
agreement is possible and any sell-out of Israeli interests
was "unimaginable."
U.S. sources who attended the discussions said Israeli
resolve was hardening and Kissinger encountered
considerable resistance. Israeli newspapers had suggested
the secretary might press for an Egypt-Israel agreement "at
any cost."
Bill Reduces Pot Penalties
SACRAMENTO — A bill that would knock down the
penalty for possessing small amounts of marijuana to the
level of a traffic ticket cleared the Senate Judiciary
Committee by a 7-3 vote yesterday.
The bill would make marijuana smoking a misdemeanor
instead of allowing courts to decide whether it is a felony
or a misdemeanor.
