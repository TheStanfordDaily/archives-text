I. The History of the Subcommittee
In February 1974, Mpha Sigma Phi, a coeducational
fraternity, petitioned the Dean of Student Affairs to be
exempted from the housing draw. Their proposal asserted
that the current undergraduate housing system was discrimi
natory on the basis of sex because only the all-male fraterni
ties were allowed the privilege of draw exemption.
Alpha Sigma Phi's petition was denied unanimously by a
Housing Configuration Panel; members of the panel felt that,
once extended to Alpha Sigma Phi, the privilege of draw
exemption would have to be extended to other coeducational
fraternities and possibly to all small living groups. However,
the panel recognized the validity of Alpha Sigma Phi's charge
of discrimination and recommended that a special committee
be established to study the question and seek a solution.
In response to this issue and other increasingly complex
housing issues, the Committee on Student Services decided in
one of its first meetings of 1974-75 to form a Subcommittee
on Residences. That subcommittee met for the first time on
November 8, 1974, and generally held sessions twice a week
thereafter.
The membership of the subcommittee consists of the
following persons:
a) Three students nominated by the ASSU Nominations
Committee;
b) three members of the parent committee, two of these
appointees serving as cochairpersons of the committee;
c) one faculty or staff member recommended by the
president;
d) three ex-officio members: the student chairperson of
COSS, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Iducation, and the Director of Housing and Food Services.
11. Recommendations of the Subcommittee on Residences
The Subcommittee, after over 2 months of study, recom
mends revising the present housing assignment system in
several important ways. The primary new component of the
subcommittee's proposed system is guaranteed housing for
specific years.
All entering freshmen would be guaranteed some campus
housing for their freshman year and two specific subsequent
years. During their freshman year, students would indicate
which two upperclass years they wanted guaranteed; these
preferences should be honored as much as administratively
feasible; and, when possible, students should be allowed to
change their preferences at a later date, liven if some
preferences for specific years could not be granted, all
entering freshmen could be guaranteed three years of on-cam
pus housing during their four-year career.
furthermore, under the proposed system, all entering
autumn-quarter transfer students who desired to live on-cam
pus would be accommodated for their first year. In addition,
we recommend that sophomore transfer students be guaran
teed one more year on-campus.
If implemented, this system would give all entering
freshmen an equal opportunity to live on-campus in their
future years at Stanford as well as ease the housing difficul
ties of transfer students. Implementation of the proposal
would also modify both the present draw and fraternity
systems. The impact of the proposal on each of these systems
is outlined below.
The Draw System
The subcommittee's proposal retains the draw. This draw
would determine who will live in which on-campus facility as
well as who will receive the residual housing (i.e., the extra
spaces which are not already guaranteed to students), thus
providing some with a fourth year of on-campus housing. We
assess the draw as being the fairest method we have to
allocate existing facilities.

The draw system would operate as it currently does, but
with the following exception: students drawing for a
"guaranteed" year would receive some on-campus housing
assignment regardless of their draw number. Which house a
guaranteed student is assigned to would depend on 1) the
student's choices, and 2) the student's draw number and
priorities.
The Fraternity System
The all-male fraternities could continue to rush new
members in the current manner. However, each fraternity
would be required to fill a quota. A fraternity's quota would
represent its proportionate share of the demand for on-cam
pus housing.
As long as the demand for housing exceeds the supply, a
fraternity's quota will be larger than the number of spaces in
the fraternity. Members of the fraternity could collectively
decide who would live in the house and who would live off
campus each year, as long as each student may live on-cam
pus at least 2 of his 3 upperclass years.
As long as a fraternity fulfills its quota-that is, as long as
it has assumed its proportionate share of students from the
housing-demand pool-students living in the draw system will
have the same opportunity to live on-campus during their
upperclass years as the members of the fraternity.
Thus, while the fraternity system is "full," both the
fra cmity system and the draw system will be bearing
proportionate shares of the housing shortage; neither group
of students will be advantaged at the other's expense.
However, if a fraternity consistently is incapable of meeting
its quota, it should lie moved into the draw system, where it
may become a special sign-up fraternity.
Allowing noncompetitive fraternities to remain outside
the draw would violate the principle of "equal opportunity"
for housing and lead quite possibly to a situation where
fraternity members were operating a "boarding house" on
campus for nonmembers. Provisions should be made to
distinguish between a consistently noncompetitive fraternity
and a healthy fraternity having a "bad year."
111. Clarification and Justification of the Proposal
The housing proposal outlined here provides for better
planning on the part of students, most of whom view their
college careers as a continuum of four years rather than four
separate, adapt-as-you-go years.
The new housing system would allow students to make
conscious decisions about their future living arrangements;
this differs from the present system in that sudden, often
reactive, decisions are currently required after the annual
spring draw.
The new system also permits certain flexibility for those
students who develop their programs gradually. As long as
"the books balance" in the housing officc, students may
change their minds about which year they would prefer to
live off-campus.
Under the current system, a student has a chance of living
on-campus for all of his four years at Stanford That chance
still exist under the proposed system, although the likelihood
of it occurring has been diminished.
Also, under the current system a student has a chance of
living of-campus for two of his four years at Stanford. Under
the proposed system, the likelihood of that occurring has
been eliminated.
The subcommittee has sought to alleviate in this proposal
some of the anxiety caused by the year-by-year draw system.
It has also sought a solution to the second major deficiency
of the allocation procedure: presently, transfer students are
not guaranteed on-campus housing for their first year. This
proposal will assure all such students campus housing if they
desire it. On-campus housing for freshmen will continue as
under the present system.
The subcommittee's main objective has been to develop
housing policies that will provide equity to all students. Hrorn
the start, we hoped to accomplish this end while maintaining
fraternities at Stanford.
Although fraternities will lie treated differently from
other houses, they will have no advantage over other houses
with respcct to continuity. Students in both systems will
have identical guarantees.
The system we have proposed provides fraternities with
autonomy and permits members to choose among themselves
which year shall be the off-campus year for each member. It
provides them with predictability and allows them to retain
the subjective selection process and the tradition of rushing
It may spur some fraternities to become more active in
order to increase membership and fill their housing quotas.
Howvver, the subcommittee does not support the sometimes
unhealthy and often inconvenient principle of over-stuffing
the houses.
The subcommittee feels that over-stuffing creates undesir
able living conditions, and thus lowers the quality of residen

tial life. This proposal works on the principle of using all the
spaces we have and giving all on-campus students good
housing spaces. In no case should equity be sacrificed by
granting to one system any significant privilege not granted
to the other.
IV. Proceedings of the Subcommittee
The subcommittee's task began with a thorough review of
the entire housing system at Stanford, not simply a review of
an isolated part of it such as fraternities, independent houses,
or dormitories. Our goal was to establish a framework within
which housing policies could be set for the next decade.
In light of these goals, the subcommittee defined tentative
housing principles which would guide its approach to the
housing issues. The most important of these principles
asserted that any proposal for an alternate system would be
based upon fairness to presently enrolled students. The
subcommittee did not consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni.
Rarly in its proceedings the subcomittee agreed that the
present system discriminated in some way against both men
and women. The subcommittee felt that this discrimination
was most noticeably manifest in the issue of equal access to
on-campus housing. We decided that equity could be estab
lished only if the all-male fraternities draw-exemption was
extended to include women or removed from the currently
exempt fraternity groups. The first alternative, extension, in
its mildest form, would mean extending draw-exemption to
include equal numbers of women and men.
In considering any extension, we debated whether we
really wished to establish one more select group on campus
to counterbalance the effects of the first draw-exempt group,
the fraternities. Since we wished to be fair to all the students,
not simply to equal numbers of men and women students, we
concluded that an extension of the privileges now enjoyed by
draw-exempt houses would result in one group of students
being handsomely advantaged at the expense of another
group of students. That result was unacceptable to all of us,
and therefore extension of the draw-exemption privilege of
fraternities was rejected unanimously.
On the other hand, the subcommittee recognized the
fraternity as one living option at a university which prides
itself on the spectrum of residential programs offered to its
students. Thus, the subcommittee sought a proposal which,
in providing equal access to on-campus housing for all
students, would not destroy the present fraternal establish
ments.
With these two objectives in mind, the subcommittee
turned to its second major alternative after extension-that of
removing the draw exemption from the fraternities. Ultimate
ly, the subcommittee chose to remove the guaranteed con
tinuity advantages of the fraternity draw-exemption. This
ensures that all students will share equally in the burden of
the housing shortage, and provides for the continuation of
the fraternity living option at Stanford.
Subjective Selectivity
Having resolved the primary issue of equal access, the
subcommittee then turned to the lesser issue of subjective
selectivity, which currently exists only in the all-male frater
nities. In considering the significance of this issue, the
subcommittee debated whether the subjective process per
mitted in the fraternity system constituted serious discrimi
nation against women, as well as the rest of the student body.
Our conclusion on this matter was shaped according to
responses to the following questions:
1. Should subjective selectivity be regarded as a privilege,
or is it primarily an imposition both to the students judging
and to those students being judged?
2. What are the results of subjective selectivity for the
participating house, for the individual students who are
selected, and for the individual students who are rejected?
3. What are the purposes of subjective selectivity? Can
they be achieved through other means?
Having examined these questions, the subcommittee con
cluded that students should lie permitted to choose whatever
educational opportunities and facilities suit them best, in
cluding their residential programs. Houses should not choose
the students: students should choose their houses. We believe
that for the majority of students, subjective selectivity would
represent a drawback rather than a privilege.
Subjective selectivity could result in a house, perhaps the
most desired facility on campus, being controlled by a single
student group, It would thus detract from the system of fair
allocation of Stanford facilities. The students living in that
house would have to assume the roles of judges once a year,
thus exercising significant power over fellow students.
We recogni/e that within the system of subjective selecti
vity, fraternities may enjoy geniality and common purpose
within a house, development of a sense of responsibility
towards one's fellow house members, the fostering of social

discipline and mutual helpfulness within the house, and
establishment of close friendships and organizational loyal
ties.
However, the subcommittee maintains that these features
can also be achieved by a house establishing a list of objective
criteria. Writing an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the outside of a house could be directed toward
finding a group of students mutually interested in living, for a
common purpose, in a particular house.
Having discussed the issue of subjective selectivity, the
subcommittee studied three alternative courses of action and
their results-ex tension, withdrawal, or retention of the
status quo.
If we voted to extend the option, we would have to
decide who, exactly, would receive the option according to a
specific list of criteria designed to answer present and future
requests. And again, we would be creating a new differential
ho'ising group to equalize the effects of the fraternities, a
result which had been rejected previously on the issue of
equal access.
In addition, we would be creating that group by ex
tending a method of selection which is not universally
pcrceived as wise or even necessary in order for student living
groups to establish common purposes' within a house. l or
these reasons, we do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the University should seek to
foster.
We then studied the second alternative-withdrawal of the
option from all students. We found no compelling reason to
withdraw the option from a large group of students (over
500) who have found it personally acceptable and who regard
it as a strength of their houses.
Finally, the subcommittee considered the retention of
subjective selectivity in the fraternities as it presently exists.
Since we considered the matter a secondary issue, we dealt
with it as one on which we could compromise, unlike the
major issue of equal access. The subcommittee, therefore,
decided to recommend retention of the option in fraternities
on the basis of its historical significance and perceived value
to fraternities.
The subcommittee recommends, however, that a frater
nity should lose this option if any substantial change takes
place within a house concerning theme, composition, or
other change affecting the inherent, traditional nature of that
house.
The subcommittee, if contested on its recommendation to
retain subjective selectivity for fraternities, would vote to
remove this feature entirely from the housing system rather
than extend it to any living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities.
V. Summary and Conclusion
In summary, the Subcommittee recommends a broad
revision in housing policies which would guarantee on-cam
pus housing to entering freshmen for at least 3 years and to
transfer students for at least their first year here. Fraternities,
while retaining subjective selectivity, would be required to
fulfill a proportionate share of on-campus housing demand.
The subcommittee views this program as straightforward,
workable, and fair to all students. It is based on the realities
of the current housing shortage and the hope that the
shortajs will lie gradually alleviated. We strongly recommend
that new housing be given priority in the allocation of
University funds. Students should be able to concentrate on
obtaining an education, and not be forced to hassle with the
scarcity of housing spaces.
The Subcommittee on Residences submits this proposal
with respectful confidence that it addresses the interests of
all Stanford students-dormitory residents, fraternity mem
bers, off-campus students, and transfer students. This pro
posal has the unanimous approval of the Subcommittee on
Residences.

I. The History of the Subcommittee
In February 1974, Mpha Sigma Phi, a coeducational
fraternity, petitioned the Dean of Student Affairs to be
exempted from the housing draw. Their proposal asserted
that the current undergraduate housing system was discrimi
natory on the basis of sex because only the all-male fraterni
ties were allowed the privilege of draw exemption.
Alpha Sigma Phi's petition was denied unanimously by a
Housing Configuration Panel; members of the panel felt that,
once extended to Alpha Sigma Phi, the privilege of draw
exemption would have to be extended to other coeducational
fraternities and possibly to all small living groups. However,
the panel recognized the validity of Alpha Sigma Phi's charge
of discrimination and recommended that a special committee
be established to study the question and seek a solution.
In response to this issue and other increasingly complex
housing issues, the Committee on Student Services decided in
one of its first meetings of 1974-75 to form a Subcommittee
on Residences. That subcommittee met for the first time on
November 8, 1974, and generally held sessions twice a week
thereafter.
The membership of the subcommittee consists of the
following persons:
a) Three students nominated by the ASSU Nominations
Committee;
b) three members of the parent committee, two of these
appointees serving as cochairpersons of the committee;
c) one faculty or staff member recommended by the
president;
d) three ex-officio members: the student chairperson of
COSS, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Iducation, and the Director of Housing and Food Services.
11. Recommendations of the Subcommittee on Residences
The Subcommittee, after over 2 months of study, recom
mends revising the present housing assignment system in
several important ways. The primary new component of the
subcommittee's proposed system is guaranteed housing for
specific years.
All entering freshmen would be guaranteed some campus
housing for their freshman year and two specific subsequent
years. During their freshman year, students would indicate
which two upperclass years they wanted guaranteed; these
preferences should be honored as much as administratively
feasible; and, when possible, students should be allowed to
change their preferences at a later date, liven if some
preferences for specific years could not be granted, all
entering freshmen could be guaranteed three years of on-cam
pus housing during their four-year career.
furthermore, under the proposed system, all entering
autumn-quarter transfer students who desired to live on-cam
pus would be accommodated for their first year. In addition,
we recommend that sophomore transfer students be guaran
teed one more year on-campus.
If implemented, this system would give all entering
freshmen an equal opportunity to live on-campus in their
future years at Stanford as well as ease the housing difficul
ties of transfer students. Implementation of the proposal
would also modify both the present draw and fraternity
systems. The impact of the proposal on each of these systems
is outlined below.
The Draw System
The subcommittee's proposal retains the draw. This draw
would determine who will live in which on-campus facility as
well as who will receive the residual housing (i.e., the extra
spaces which are not already guaranteed to students), thus
providing some with a fourth year of on-campus housing. We
assess the draw as being the fairest method we have to
allocate existing facilities.

The draw system would operate as it currently does, but
with the following exception: students drawing for a
"guaranteed" year would receive some on-campus housing
assignment regardless of their draw number. Which house a
guaranteed student is assigned to would depend on 1) the
student's choices, and 2) the student's draw number and
priorities.
The Fraternity System
The all-male fraternities could continue to rush new
members in the current manner. However, each fraternity
would be required to fill a quota. A fraternity's quota would
represent its proportionate share of the demand for on-cam
pus housing.
As long as the demand for housing exceeds the supply, a
fraternity's quota will be larger than the number of spaces in
the fraternity. Members of the fraternity could collectively
decide who would live in the house and who would live off
campus each year, as long as each student may live on-cam
pus at least 2 of his 3 upperclass years.
As long as a fraternity fulfills its quota-that is, as long as
it has assumed its proportionate share of students from the
housing-demand pool-students living in the draw system will
have the same opportunity to live on-campus during their
upperclass years as the members of the fraternity.
Thus, while the fraternity system is "full," both the
fra cmity system and the draw system will be bearing
proportionate shares of the housing shortage; neither group
of students will be advantaged at the other's expense.
However, if a fraternity consistently is incapable of meeting
its quota, it should lie moved into the draw system, where it
may become a special sign-up fraternity.
Allowing noncompetitive fraternities to remain outside
the draw would violate the principle of "equal opportunity"
for housing and lead quite possibly to a situation where
fraternity members were operating a "boarding house" on
campus for nonmembers. Provisions should be made to
distinguish between a consistently noncompetitive fraternity
and a healthy fraternity having a "bad year."
111. Clarification and Justification of the Proposal
The housing proposal outlined here provides for better
planning on the part of students, most of whom view their
college careers as a continuum of four years rather than four
separate, adapt-as-you-go years.
The new housing system would allow students to make
conscious decisions about their future living arrangements;
this differs from the present system in that sudden, often
reactive, decisions are currently required after the annual
spring draw.
The new system also permits certain flexibility for those
students who develop their programs gradually. As long as
"the books balance" in the housing officc, students may
change their minds about which year they would prefer to
live off-campus.
Under the current system, a student has a chance of living
on-campus for all of his four years at Stanford That chance
still exist under the proposed system, although the likelihood
of it occurring has been diminished.
Also, under the current system a student has a chance of
living of-campus for two of his four years at Stanford. Under
the proposed system, the likelihood of that occurring has
been eliminated.
The subcommittee has sought to alleviate in this proposal
some of the anxiety caused by the year-by-year draw system.
It has also sought a solution to the second major deficiency
of the allocation procedure: presently, transfer students are
not guaranteed on-campus housing for their first year. This
proposal will assure all such students campus housing if they
desire it. On-campus housing for freshmen will continue as
under the present system.
The subcommittee's main objective has been to develop
housing policies that will provide equity to all students. Hrorn
the start, we hoped to accomplish this end while maintaining
fraternities at Stanford.
Although fraternities will lie treated differently from
other houses, they will have no advantage over other houses
with respcct to continuity. Students in both systems will
have identical guarantees.
The system we have proposed provides fraternities with
autonomy and permits members to choose among themselves
which year shall be the off-campus year for each member. It
provides them with predictability and allows them to retain
the subjective selection process and the tradition of rushing
It may spur some fraternities to become more active in
order to increase membership and fill their housing quotas.
Howvver, the subcommittee does not support the sometimes
unhealthy and often inconvenient principle of over-stuffing
the houses.
The subcommittee feels that over-stuffing creates undesir
able living conditions, and thus lowers the quality of residen

tial life. This proposal works on the principle of using all the
spaces we have and giving all on-campus students good
housing spaces. In no case should equity be sacrificed by
granting to one system any significant privilege not granted
to the other.
IV. Proceedings of the Subcommittee
The subcommittee's task began with a thorough review of
the entire housing system at Stanford, not simply a review of
an isolated part of it such as fraternities, independent houses,
or dormitories. Our goal was to establish a framework within
which housing policies could be set for the next decade.
In light of these goals, the subcommittee defined tentative
housing principles which would guide its approach to the
housing issues. The most important of these principles
asserted that any proposal for an alternate system would be
based upon fairness to presently enrolled students. The
subcommittee did not consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni.
Rarly in its proceedings the subcomittee agreed that the
present system discriminated in some way against both men
and women. The subcommittee felt that this discrimination
was most noticeably manifest in the issue of equal access to
on-campus housing. We decided that equity could be estab
lished only if the all-male fraternities draw-exemption was
extended to include women or removed from the currently
exempt fraternity groups. The first alternative, extension, in
its mildest form, would mean extending draw-exemption to
include equal numbers of women and men.
In considering any extension, we debated whether we
really wished to establish one more select group on campus
to counterbalance the effects of the first draw-exempt group,
the fraternities. Since we wished to be fair to all the students,
not simply to equal numbers of men and women students, we
concluded that an extension of the privileges now enjoyed by
draw-exempt houses would result in one group of students
being handsomely advantaged at the expense of another
group of students. That result was unacceptable to all of us,
and therefore extension of the draw-exemption privilege of
fraternities was rejected unanimously.
On the other hand, the subcommittee recognized the
fraternity as one living option at a university which prides
itself on the spectrum of residential programs offered to its
students. Thus, the subcommittee sought a proposal which,
in providing equal access to on-campus housing for all
students, would not destroy the present fraternal establish
ments.
With these two objectives in mind, the subcommittee
turned to its second major alternative after extension-that of
removing the draw exemption from the fraternities. Ultimate
ly, the subcommittee chose to remove the guaranteed con
tinuity advantages of the fraternity draw-exemption. This
ensures that all students will share equally in the burden of
the housing shortage, and provides for the continuation of
the fraternity living option at Stanford.
Subjective Selectivity
Having resolved the primary issue of equal access, the
subcommittee then turned to the lesser issue of subjective
selectivity, which currently exists only in the all-male frater
nities. In considering the significance of this issue, the
subcommittee debated whether the subjective process per
mitted in the fraternity system constituted serious discrimi
nation against women, as well as the rest of the student body.
Our conclusion on this matter was shaped according to
responses to the following questions:
1. Should subjective selectivity be regarded as a privilege,
or is it primarily an imposition both to the students judging
and to those students being judged?
2. What are the results of subjective selectivity for the
participating house, for the individual students who are
selected, and for the individual students who are rejected?
3. What are the purposes of subjective selectivity? Can
they be achieved through other means?
Having examined these questions, the subcommittee con
cluded that students should lie permitted to choose whatever
educational opportunities and facilities suit them best, in
cluding their residential programs. Houses should not choose
the students: students should choose their houses. We believe
that for the majority of students, subjective selectivity would
represent a drawback rather than a privilege.
Subjective selectivity could result in a house, perhaps the
most desired facility on campus, being controlled by a single
student group, It would thus detract from the system of fair
allocation of Stanford facilities. The students living in that
house would have to assume the roles of judges once a year,
thus exercising significant power over fellow students.
We recogni/e that within the system of subjective selecti
vity, fraternities may enjoy geniality and common purpose
within a house, development of a sense of responsibility
towards one's fellow house members, the fostering of social

discipline and mutual helpfulness within the house, and
establishment of close friendships and organizational loyal
ties.
However, the subcommittee maintains that these features
can also be achieved by a house establishing a list of objective
criteria. Writing an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the outside of a house could be directed toward
finding a group of students mutually interested in living, for a
common purpose, in a particular house.
Having discussed the issue of subjective selectivity, the
subcommittee studied three alternative courses of action and
their results-ex tension, withdrawal, or retention of the
status quo.
If we voted to extend the option, we would have to
decide who, exactly, would receive the option according to a
specific list of criteria designed to answer present and future
requests. And again, we would be creating a new differential
ho'ising group to equalize the effects of the fraternities, a
result which had been rejected previously on the issue of
equal access.
In addition, we would be creating that group by ex
tending a method of selection which is not universally
pcrceived as wise or even necessary in order for student living
groups to establish common purposes' within a house. l or
these reasons, we do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the University should seek to
foster.
We then studied the second alternative-withdrawal of the
option from all students. We found no compelling reason to
withdraw the option from a large group of students (over
500) who have found it personally acceptable and who regard
it as a strength of their houses.
Finally, the subcommittee considered the retention of
subjective selectivity in the fraternities as it presently exists.
Since we considered the matter a secondary issue, we dealt
with it as one on which we could compromise, unlike the
major issue of equal access. The subcommittee, therefore,
decided to recommend retention of the option in fraternities
on the basis of its historical significance and perceived value
to fraternities.
The subcommittee recommends, however, that a frater
nity should lose this option if any substantial change takes
place within a house concerning theme, composition, or
other change affecting the inherent, traditional nature of that
house.
The subcommittee, if contested on its recommendation to
retain subjective selectivity for fraternities, would vote to
remove this feature entirely from the housing system rather
than extend it to any living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities.
V. Summary and Conclusion
In summary, the Subcommittee recommends a broad
revision in housing policies which would guarantee on-cam
pus housing to entering freshmen for at least 3 years and to
transfer students for at least their first year here. Fraternities,
while retaining subjective selectivity, would be required to
fulfill a proportionate share of on-campus housing demand.
The subcommittee views this program as straightforward,
workable, and fair to all students. It is based on the realities
of the current housing shortage and the hope that the
shortajs will lie gradually alleviated. We strongly recommend
that new housing be given priority in the allocation of
University funds. Students should be able to concentrate on
obtaining an education, and not be forced to hassle with the
scarcity of housing spaces.
The Subcommittee on Residences submits this proposal
with respectful confidence that it addresses the interests of
all Stanford students-dormitory residents, fraternity mem
bers, off-campus students, and transfer students. This pro
posal has the unanimous approval of the Subcommittee on
Residences.

I. The History of the Subcommittee
In February 1974, Mpha Sigma Phi, a coeducational
fraternity, petitioned the Dean of Student Affairs to be
exempted from the housing draw. Their proposal asserted
that the current undergraduate housing system was discrimi
natory on the basis of sex because only the all-male fraterni
ties were allowed the privilege of draw exemption.
Alpha Sigma Phi's petition was denied unanimously by a
Housing Configuration Panel; members of the panel felt that,
once extended to Alpha Sigma Phi, the privilege of draw
exemption would have to be extended to other coeducational
fraternities and possibly to all small living groups. However,
the panel recognized the validity of Alpha Sigma Phi's charge
of discrimination and recommended that a special committee
be established to study the question and seek a solution.
In response to this issue and other increasingly complex
housing issues, the Committee on Student Services decided in
one of its first meetings of 1974-75 to form a Subcommittee
on Residences. That subcommittee met for the first time on
November 8, 1974, and generally held sessions twice a week
thereafter.
The membership of the subcommittee consists of the
following persons:
a) Three students nominated by the ASSU Nominations
Committee;
b) three members of the parent committee, two of these
appointees serving as cochairpersons of the committee;
c) one faculty or staff member recommended by the
president;
d) three ex-officio members: the student chairperson of
COSS, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Iducation, and the Director of Housing and Food Services.
11. Recommendations of the Subcommittee on Residences
The Subcommittee, after over 2 months of study, recom
mends revising the present housing assignment system in
several important ways. The primary new component of the
subcommittee's proposed system is guaranteed housing for
specific years.
All entering freshmen would be guaranteed some campus
housing for their freshman year and two specific subsequent
years. During their freshman year, students would indicate
which two upperclass years they wanted guaranteed; these
preferences should be honored as much as administratively
feasible; and, when possible, students should be allowed to
change their preferences at a later date, liven if some
preferences for specific years could not be granted, all
entering freshmen could be guaranteed three years of on-cam
pus housing during their four-year career.
furthermore, under the proposed system, all entering
autumn-quarter transfer students who desired to live on-cam
pus would be accommodated for their first year. In addition,
we recommend that sophomore transfer students be guaran
teed one more year on-campus.
If implemented, this system would give all entering
freshmen an equal opportunity to live on-campus in their
future years at Stanford as well as ease the housing difficul
ties of transfer students. Implementation of the proposal
would also modify both the present draw and fraternity
systems. The impact of the proposal on each of these systems
is outlined below.
The Draw System
The subcommittee's proposal retains the draw. This draw
would determine who will live in which on-campus facility as
well as who will receive the residual housing (i.e., the extra
spaces which are not already guaranteed to students), thus
providing some with a fourth year of on-campus housing. We
assess the draw as being the fairest method we have to
allocate existing facilities.

The draw system would operate as it currently does, but
with the following exception: students drawing for a
"guaranteed" year would receive some on-campus housing
assignment regardless of their draw number. Which house a
guaranteed student is assigned to would depend on 1) the
student's choices, and 2) the student's draw number and
priorities.
The Fraternity System
The all-male fraternities could continue to rush new
members in the current manner. However, each fraternity
would be required to fill a quota. A fraternity's quota would
represent its proportionate share of the demand for on-cam
pus housing.
As long as the demand for housing exceeds the supply, a
fraternity's quota will be larger than the number of spaces in
the fraternity. Members of the fraternity could collectively
decide who would live in the house and who would live off
campus each year, as long as each student may live on-cam
pus at least 2 of his 3 upperclass years.
As long as a fraternity fulfills its quota-that is, as long as
it has assumed its proportionate share of students from the
housing-demand pool-students living in the draw system will
have the same opportunity to live on-campus during their
upperclass years as the members of the fraternity.
Thus, while the fraternity system is "full," both the
fra cmity system and the draw system will be bearing
proportionate shares of the housing shortage; neither group
of students will be advantaged at the other's expense.
However, if a fraternity consistently is incapable of meeting
its quota, it should lie moved into the draw system, where it
may become a special sign-up fraternity.
Allowing noncompetitive fraternities to remain outside
the draw would violate the principle of "equal opportunity"
for housing and lead quite possibly to a situation where
fraternity members were operating a "boarding house" on
campus for nonmembers. Provisions should be made to
distinguish between a consistently noncompetitive fraternity
and a healthy fraternity having a "bad year."
111. Clarification and Justification of the Proposal
The housing proposal outlined here provides for better
planning on the part of students, most of whom view their
college careers as a continuum of four years rather than four
separate, adapt-as-you-go years.
The new housing system would allow students to make
conscious decisions about their future living arrangements;
this differs from the present system in that sudden, often
reactive, decisions are currently required after the annual
spring draw.
The new system also permits certain flexibility for those
students who develop their programs gradually. As long as
"the books balance" in the housing officc, students may
change their minds about which year they would prefer to
live off-campus.
Under the current system, a student has a chance of living
on-campus for all of his four years at Stanford That chance
still exist under the proposed system, although the likelihood
of it occurring has been diminished.
Also, under the current system a student has a chance of
living of-campus for two of his four years at Stanford. Under
the proposed system, the likelihood of that occurring has
been eliminated.
The subcommittee has sought to alleviate in this proposal
some of the anxiety caused by the year-by-year draw system.
It has also sought a solution to the second major deficiency
of the allocation procedure: presently, transfer students are
not guaranteed on-campus housing for their first year. This
proposal will assure all such students campus housing if they
desire it. On-campus housing for freshmen will continue as
under the present system.
The subcommittee's main objective has been to develop
housing policies that will provide equity to all students. Hrorn
the start, we hoped to accomplish this end while maintaining
fraternities at Stanford.
Although fraternities will lie treated differently from
other houses, they will have no advantage over other houses
with respcct to continuity. Students in both systems will
have identical guarantees.
The system we have proposed provides fraternities with
autonomy and permits members to choose among themselves
which year shall be the off-campus year for each member. It
provides them with predictability and allows them to retain
the subjective selection process and the tradition of rushing
It may spur some fraternities to become more active in
order to increase membership and fill their housing quotas.
Howvver, the subcommittee does not support the sometimes
unhealthy and often inconvenient principle of over-stuffing
the houses.
The subcommittee feels that over-stuffing creates undesir
able living conditions, and thus lowers the quality of residen

tial life. This proposal works on the principle of using all the
spaces we have and giving all on-campus students good
housing spaces. In no case should equity be sacrificed by
granting to one system any significant privilege not granted
to the other.
IV. Proceedings of the Subcommittee
The subcommittee's task began with a thorough review of
the entire housing system at Stanford, not simply a review of
an isolated part of it such as fraternities, independent houses,
or dormitories. Our goal was to establish a framework within
which housing policies could be set for the next decade.
In light of these goals, the subcommittee defined tentative
housing principles which would guide its approach to the
housing issues. The most important of these principles
asserted that any proposal for an alternate system would be
based upon fairness to presently enrolled students. The
subcommittee did not consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni.
Rarly in its proceedings the subcomittee agreed that the
present system discriminated in some way against both men
and women. The subcommittee felt that this discrimination
was most noticeably manifest in the issue of equal access to
on-campus housing. We decided that equity could be estab
lished only if the all-male fraternities draw-exemption was
extended to include women or removed from the currently
exempt fraternity groups. The first alternative, extension, in
its mildest form, would mean extending draw-exemption to
include equal numbers of women and men.
In considering any extension, we debated whether we
really wished to establish one more select group on campus
to counterbalance the effects of the first draw-exempt group,
the fraternities. Since we wished to be fair to all the students,
not simply to equal numbers of men and women students, we
concluded that an extension of the privileges now enjoyed by
draw-exempt houses would result in one group of students
being handsomely advantaged at the expense of another
group of students. That result was unacceptable to all of us,
and therefore extension of the draw-exemption privilege of
fraternities was rejected unanimously.
On the other hand, the subcommittee recognized the
fraternity as one living option at a university which prides
itself on the spectrum of residential programs offered to its
students. Thus, the subcommittee sought a proposal which,
in providing equal access to on-campus housing for all
students, would not destroy the present fraternal establish
ments.
With these two objectives in mind, the subcommittee
turned to its second major alternative after extension-that of
removing the draw exemption from the fraternities. Ultimate
ly, the subcommittee chose to remove the guaranteed con
tinuity advantages of the fraternity draw-exemption. This
ensures that all students will share equally in the burden of
the housing shortage, and provides for the continuation of
the fraternity living option at Stanford.
Subjective Selectivity
Having resolved the primary issue of equal access, the
subcommittee then turned to the lesser issue of subjective
selectivity, which currently exists only in the all-male frater
nities. In considering the significance of this issue, the
subcommittee debated whether the subjective process per
mitted in the fraternity system constituted serious discrimi
nation against women, as well as the rest of the student body.
Our conclusion on this matter was shaped according to
responses to the following questions:
1. Should subjective selectivity be regarded as a privilege,
or is it primarily an imposition both to the students judging
and to those students being judged?
2. What are the results of subjective selectivity for the
participating house, for the individual students who are
selected, and for the individual students who are rejected?
3. What are the purposes of subjective selectivity? Can
they be achieved through other means?
Having examined these questions, the subcommittee con
cluded that students should lie permitted to choose whatever
educational opportunities and facilities suit them best, in
cluding their residential programs. Houses should not choose
the students: students should choose their houses. We believe
that for the majority of students, subjective selectivity would
represent a drawback rather than a privilege.
Subjective selectivity could result in a house, perhaps the
most desired facility on campus, being controlled by a single
student group, It would thus detract from the system of fair
allocation of Stanford facilities. The students living in that
house would have to assume the roles of judges once a year,
thus exercising significant power over fellow students.
We recogni/e that within the system of subjective selecti
vity, fraternities may enjoy geniality and common purpose
within a house, development of a sense of responsibility
towards one's fellow house members, the fostering of social

discipline and mutual helpfulness within the house, and
establishment of close friendships and organizational loyal
ties.
However, the subcommittee maintains that these features
can also be achieved by a house establishing a list of objective
criteria. Writing an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the outside of a house could be directed toward
finding a group of students mutually interested in living, for a
common purpose, in a particular house.
Having discussed the issue of subjective selectivity, the
subcommittee studied three alternative courses of action and
their results-ex tension, withdrawal, or retention of the
status quo.
If we voted to extend the option, we would have to
decide who, exactly, would receive the option according to a
specific list of criteria designed to answer present and future
requests. And again, we would be creating a new differential
ho'ising group to equalize the effects of the fraternities, a
result which had been rejected previously on the issue of
equal access.
In addition, we would be creating that group by ex
tending a method of selection which is not universally
pcrceived as wise or even necessary in order for student living
groups to establish common purposes' within a house. l or
these reasons, we do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the University should seek to
foster.
We then studied the second alternative-withdrawal of the
option from all students. We found no compelling reason to
withdraw the option from a large group of students (over
500) who have found it personally acceptable and who regard
it as a strength of their houses.
Finally, the subcommittee considered the retention of
subjective selectivity in the fraternities as it presently exists.
Since we considered the matter a secondary issue, we dealt
with it as one on which we could compromise, unlike the
major issue of equal access. The subcommittee, therefore,
decided to recommend retention of the option in fraternities
on the basis of its historical significance and perceived value
to fraternities.
The subcommittee recommends, however, that a frater
nity should lose this option if any substantial change takes
place within a house concerning theme, composition, or
other change affecting the inherent, traditional nature of that
house.
The subcommittee, if contested on its recommendation to
retain subjective selectivity for fraternities, would vote to
remove this feature entirely from the housing system rather
than extend it to any living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities.
V. Summary and Conclusion
In summary, the Subcommittee recommends a broad
revision in housing policies which would guarantee on-cam
pus housing to entering freshmen for at least 3 years and to
transfer students for at least their first year here. Fraternities,
while retaining subjective selectivity, would be required to
fulfill a proportionate share of on-campus housing demand.
The subcommittee views this program as straightforward,
workable, and fair to all students. It is based on the realities
of the current housing shortage and the hope that the
shortajs will lie gradually alleviated. We strongly recommend
that new housing be given priority in the allocation of
University funds. Students should be able to concentrate on
obtaining an education, and not be forced to hassle with the
scarcity of housing spaces.
The Subcommittee on Residences submits this proposal
with respectful confidence that it addresses the interests of
all Stanford students-dormitory residents, fraternity mem
bers, off-campus students, and transfer students. This pro
posal has the unanimous approval of the Subcommittee on
Residences.

I. The History of the Subcommittee
In February 1974, Mpha Sigma Phi, a coeducational
fraternity, petitioned the Dean of Student Affairs to be
exempted from the housing draw. Their proposal asserted
that the current undergraduate housing system was discrimi
natory on the basis of sex because only the all-male fraterni
ties were allowed the privilege of draw exemption.
Alpha Sigma Phi's petition was denied unanimously by a
Housing Configuration Panel; members of the panel felt that,
once extended to Alpha Sigma Phi, the privilege of draw
exemption would have to be extended to other coeducational
fraternities and possibly to all small living groups. However,
the panel recognized the validity of Alpha Sigma Phi's charge
of discrimination and recommended that a special committee
be established to study the question and seek a solution.
In response to this issue and other increasingly complex
housing issues, the Committee on Student Services decided in
one of its first meetings of 1974-75 to form a Subcommittee
on Residences. That subcommittee met for the first time on
November 8, 1974, and generally held sessions twice a week
thereafter.
The membership of the subcommittee consists of the
following persons:
a) Three students nominated by the ASSU Nominations
Committee;
b) three members of the parent committee, two of these
appointees serving as cochairpersons of the committee;
c) one faculty or staff member recommended by the
president;
d) three ex-officio members: the student chairperson of
COSS, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Iducation, and the Director of Housing and Food Services.
11. Recommendations of the Subcommittee on Residences
The Subcommittee, after over 2 months of study, recom
mends revising the present housing assignment system in
several important ways. The primary new component of the
subcommittee's proposed system is guaranteed housing for
specific years.
All entering freshmen would be guaranteed some campus
housing for their freshman year and two specific subsequent
years. During their freshman year, students would indicate
which two upperclass years they wanted guaranteed; these
preferences should be honored as much as administratively
feasible; and, when possible, students should be allowed to
change their preferences at a later date, liven if some
preferences for specific years could not be granted, all
entering freshmen could be guaranteed three years of on-cam
pus housing during their four-year career.
furthermore, under the proposed system, all entering
autumn-quarter transfer students who desired to live on-cam
pus would be accommodated for their first year. In addition,
we recommend that sophomore transfer students be guaran
teed one more year on-campus.
If implemented, this system would give all entering
freshmen an equal opportunity to live on-campus in their
future years at Stanford as well as ease the housing difficul
ties of transfer students. Implementation of the proposal
would also modify both the present draw and fraternity
systems. The impact of the proposal on each of these systems
is outlined below.
The Draw System
The subcommittee's proposal retains the draw. This draw
would determine who will live in which on-campus facility as
well as who will receive the residual housing (i.e., the extra
spaces which are not already guaranteed to students), thus
providing some with a fourth year of on-campus housing. We
assess the draw as being the fairest method we have to
allocate existing facilities.

The draw system would operate as it currently does, but
with the following exception: students drawing for a
"guaranteed" year would receive some on-campus housing
assignment regardless of their draw number. Which house a
guaranteed student is assigned to would depend on 1) the
student's choices, and 2) the student's draw number and
priorities.
The Fraternity System
The all-male fraternities could continue to rush new
members in the current manner. However, each fraternity
would be required to fill a quota. A fraternity's quota would
represent its proportionate share of the demand for on-cam
pus housing.
As long as the demand for housing exceeds the supply, a
fraternity's quota will be larger than the number of spaces in
the fraternity. Members of the fraternity could collectively
decide who would live in the house and who would live off
campus each year, as long as each student may live on-cam
pus at least 2 of his 3 upperclass years.
As long as a fraternity fulfills its quota-that is, as long as
it has assumed its proportionate share of students from the
housing-demand pool-students living in the draw system will
have the same opportunity to live on-campus during their
upperclass years as the members of the fraternity.
Thus, while the fraternity system is "full," both the
fra cmity system and the draw system will be bearing
proportionate shares of the housing shortage; neither group
of students will be advantaged at the other's expense.
However, if a fraternity consistently is incapable of meeting
its quota, it should lie moved into the draw system, where it
may become a special sign-up fraternity.
Allowing noncompetitive fraternities to remain outside
the draw would violate the principle of "equal opportunity"
for housing and lead quite possibly to a situation where
fraternity members were operating a "boarding house" on
campus for nonmembers. Provisions should be made to
distinguish between a consistently noncompetitive fraternity
and a healthy fraternity having a "bad year."
111. Clarification and Justification of the Proposal
The housing proposal outlined here provides for better
planning on the part of students, most of whom view their
college careers as a continuum of four years rather than four
separate, adapt-as-you-go years.
The new housing system would allow students to make
conscious decisions about their future living arrangements;
this differs from the present system in that sudden, often
reactive, decisions are currently required after the annual
spring draw.
The new system also permits certain flexibility for those
students who develop their programs gradually. As long as
"the books balance" in the housing officc, students may
change their minds about which year they would prefer to
live off-campus.
Under the current system, a student has a chance of living
on-campus for all of his four years at Stanford That chance
still exist under the proposed system, although the likelihood
of it occurring has been diminished.
Also, under the current system a student has a chance of
living of-campus for two of his four years at Stanford. Under
the proposed system, the likelihood of that occurring has
been eliminated.
The subcommittee has sought to alleviate in this proposal
some of the anxiety caused by the year-by-year draw system.
It has also sought a solution to the second major deficiency
of the allocation procedure: presently, transfer students are
not guaranteed on-campus housing for their first year. This
proposal will assure all such students campus housing if they
desire it. On-campus housing for freshmen will continue as
under the present system.
The subcommittee's main objective has been to develop
housing policies that will provide equity to all students. Hrorn
the start, we hoped to accomplish this end while maintaining
fraternities at Stanford.
Although fraternities will lie treated differently from
other houses, they will have no advantage over other houses
with respcct to continuity. Students in both systems will
have identical guarantees.
The system we have proposed provides fraternities with
autonomy and permits members to choose among themselves
which year shall be the off-campus year for each member. It
provides them with predictability and allows them to retain
the subjective selection process and the tradition of rushing
It may spur some fraternities to become more active in
order to increase membership and fill their housing quotas.
Howvver, the subcommittee does not support the sometimes
unhealthy and often inconvenient principle of over-stuffing
the houses.
The subcommittee feels that over-stuffing creates undesir
able living conditions, and thus lowers the quality of residen

tial life. This proposal works on the principle of using all the
spaces we have and giving all on-campus students good
housing spaces. In no case should equity be sacrificed by
granting to one system any significant privilege not granted
to the other.
IV. Proceedings of the Subcommittee
The subcommittee's task began with a thorough review of
the entire housing system at Stanford, not simply a review of
an isolated part of it such as fraternities, independent houses,
or dormitories. Our goal was to establish a framework within
which housing policies could be set for the next decade.
In light of these goals, the subcommittee defined tentative
housing principles which would guide its approach to the
housing issues. The most important of these principles
asserted that any proposal for an alternate system would be
based upon fairness to presently enrolled students. The
subcommittee did not consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni.
Rarly in its proceedings the subcomittee agreed that the
present system discriminated in some way against both men
and women. The subcommittee felt that this discrimination
was most noticeably manifest in the issue of equal access to
on-campus housing. We decided that equity could be estab
lished only if the all-male fraternities draw-exemption was
extended to include women or removed from the currently
exempt fraternity groups. The first alternative, extension, in
its mildest form, would mean extending draw-exemption to
include equal numbers of women and men.
In considering any extension, we debated whether we
really wished to establish one more select group on campus
to counterbalance the effects of the first draw-exempt group,
the fraternities. Since we wished to be fair to all the students,
not simply to equal numbers of men and women students, we
concluded that an extension of the privileges now enjoyed by
draw-exempt houses would result in one group of students
being handsomely advantaged at the expense of another
group of students. That result was unacceptable to all of us,
and therefore extension of the draw-exemption privilege of
fraternities was rejected unanimously.
On the other hand, the subcommittee recognized the
fraternity as one living option at a university which prides
itself on the spectrum of residential programs offered to its
students. Thus, the subcommittee sought a proposal which,
in providing equal access to on-campus housing for all
students, would not destroy the present fraternal establish
ments.
With these two objectives in mind, the subcommittee
turned to its second major alternative after extension-that of
removing the draw exemption from the fraternities. Ultimate
ly, the subcommittee chose to remove the guaranteed con
tinuity advantages of the fraternity draw-exemption. This
ensures that all students will share equally in the burden of
the housing shortage, and provides for the continuation of
the fraternity living option at Stanford.
Subjective Selectivity
Having resolved the primary issue of equal access, the
subcommittee then turned to the lesser issue of subjective
selectivity, which currently exists only in the all-male frater
nities. In considering the significance of this issue, the
subcommittee debated whether the subjective process per
mitted in the fraternity system constituted serious discrimi
nation against women, as well as the rest of the student body.
Our conclusion on this matter was shaped according to
responses to the following questions:
1. Should subjective selectivity be regarded as a privilege,
or is it primarily an imposition both to the students judging
and to those students being judged?
2. What are the results of subjective selectivity for the
participating house, for the individual students who are
selected, and for the individual students who are rejected?
3. What are the purposes of subjective selectivity? Can
they be achieved through other means?
Having examined these questions, the subcommittee con
cluded that students should lie permitted to choose whatever
educational opportunities and facilities suit them best, in
cluding their residential programs. Houses should not choose
the students: students should choose their houses. We believe
that for the majority of students, subjective selectivity would
represent a drawback rather than a privilege.
Subjective selectivity could result in a house, perhaps the
most desired facility on campus, being controlled by a single
student group, It would thus detract from the system of fair
allocation of Stanford facilities. The students living in that
house would have to assume the roles of judges once a year,
thus exercising significant power over fellow students.
We recogni/e that within the system of subjective selecti
vity, fraternities may enjoy geniality and common purpose
within a house, development of a sense of responsibility
towards one's fellow house members, the fostering of social

discipline and mutual helpfulness within the house, and
establishment of close friendships and organizational loyal
ties.
However, the subcommittee maintains that these features
can also be achieved by a house establishing a list of objective
criteria. Writing an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the outside of a house could be directed toward
finding a group of students mutually interested in living, for a
common purpose, in a particular house.
Having discussed the issue of subjective selectivity, the
subcommittee studied three alternative courses of action and
their results-ex tension, withdrawal, or retention of the
status quo.
If we voted to extend the option, we would have to
decide who, exactly, would receive the option according to a
specific list of criteria designed to answer present and future
requests. And again, we would be creating a new differential
ho'ising group to equalize the effects of the fraternities, a
result which had been rejected previously on the issue of
equal access.
In addition, we would be creating that group by ex
tending a method of selection which is not universally
pcrceived as wise or even necessary in order for student living
groups to establish common purposes' within a house. l or
these reasons, we do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the University should seek to
foster.
We then studied the second alternative-withdrawal of the
option from all students. We found no compelling reason to
withdraw the option from a large group of students (over
500) who have found it personally acceptable and who regard
it as a strength of their houses.
Finally, the subcommittee considered the retention of
subjective selectivity in the fraternities as it presently exists.
Since we considered the matter a secondary issue, we dealt
with it as one on which we could compromise, unlike the
major issue of equal access. The subcommittee, therefore,
decided to recommend retention of the option in fraternities
on the basis of its historical significance and perceived value
to fraternities.
The subcommittee recommends, however, that a frater
nity should lose this option if any substantial change takes
place within a house concerning theme, composition, or
other change affecting the inherent, traditional nature of that
house.
The subcommittee, if contested on its recommendation to
retain subjective selectivity for fraternities, would vote to
remove this feature entirely from the housing system rather
than extend it to any living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities.
V. Summary and Conclusion
In summary, the Subcommittee recommends a broad
revision in housing policies which would guarantee on-cam
pus housing to entering freshmen for at least 3 years and to
transfer students for at least their first year here. Fraternities,
while retaining subjective selectivity, would be required to
fulfill a proportionate share of on-campus housing demand.
The subcommittee views this program as straightforward,
workable, and fair to all students. It is based on the realities
of the current housing shortage and the hope that the
shortajs will lie gradually alleviated. We strongly recommend
that new housing be given priority in the allocation of
University funds. Students should be able to concentrate on
obtaining an education, and not be forced to hassle with the
scarcity of housing spaces.
The Subcommittee on Residences submits this proposal
with respectful confidence that it addresses the interests of
all Stanford students-dormitory residents, fraternity mem
bers, off-campus students, and transfer students. This pro
posal has the unanimous approval of the Subcommittee on
Residences.

I. The History of the Subcommittee
In February 1974, Mpha Sigma Phi, a coeducational
fraternity, petitioned the Dean of Student Affairs to be
exempted from the housing draw. Their proposal asserted
that the current undergraduate housing system was discrimi
natory on the basis of sex because only the all-male fraterni
ties were allowed the privilege of draw exemption.
Alpha Sigma Phi's petition was denied unanimously by a
Housing Configuration Panel; members of the panel felt that,
once extended to Alpha Sigma Phi, the privilege of draw
exemption would have to be extended to other coeducational
fraternities and possibly to all small living groups. However,
the panel recognized the validity of Alpha Sigma Phi's charge
of discrimination and recommended that a special committee
be established to study the question and seek a solution.
In response to this issue and other increasingly complex
housing issues, the Committee on Student Services decided in
one of its first meetings of 1974-75 to form a Subcommittee
on Residences. That subcommittee met for the first time on
November 8, 1974, and generally held sessions twice a week
thereafter.
The membership of the subcommittee consists of the
following persons:
a) Three students nominated by the ASSU Nominations
Committee;
b) three members of the parent committee, two of these
appointees serving as cochairpersons of the committee;
c) one faculty or staff member recommended by the
president;
d) three ex-officio members: the student chairperson of
COSS, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Iducation, and the Director of Housing and Food Services.
11. Recommendations of the Subcommittee on Residences
The Subcommittee, after over 2 months of study, recom
mends revising the present housing assignment system in
several important ways. The primary new component of the
subcommittee's proposed system is guaranteed housing for
specific years.
All entering freshmen would be guaranteed some campus
housing for their freshman year and two specific subsequent
years. During their freshman year, students would indicate
which two upperclass years they wanted guaranteed; these
preferences should be honored as much as administratively
feasible; and, when possible, students should be allowed to
change their preferences at a later date, liven if some
preferences for specific years could not be granted, all
entering freshmen could be guaranteed three years of on-cam
pus housing during their four-year career.
furthermore, under the proposed system, all entering
autumn-quarter transfer students who desired to live on-cam
pus would be accommodated for their first year. In addition,
we recommend that sophomore transfer students be guaran
teed one more year on-campus.
If implemented, this system would give all entering
freshmen an equal opportunity to live on-campus in their
future years at Stanford as well as ease the housing difficul
ties of transfer students. Implementation of the proposal
would also modify both the present draw and fraternity
systems. The impact of the proposal on each of these systems
is outlined below.
The Draw System
The subcommittee's proposal retains the draw. This draw
would determine who will live in which on-campus facility as
well as who will receive the residual housing (i.e., the extra
spaces which are not already guaranteed to students), thus
providing some with a fourth year of on-campus housing. We
assess the draw as being the fairest method we have to
allocate existing facilities.

The draw system would operate as it currently does, but
with the following exception: students drawing for a
"guaranteed" year would receive some on-campus housing
assignment regardless of their draw number. Which house a
guaranteed student is assigned to would depend on 1) the
student's choices, and 2) the student's draw number and
priorities.
The Fraternity System
The all-male fraternities could continue to rush new
members in the current manner. However, each fraternity
would be required to fill a quota. A fraternity's quota would
represent its proportionate share of the demand for on-cam
pus housing.
As long as the demand for housing exceeds the supply, a
fraternity's quota will be larger than the number of spaces in
the fraternity. Members of the fraternity could collectively
decide who would live in the house and who would live off
campus each year, as long as each student may live on-cam
pus at least 2 of his 3 upperclass years.
As long as a fraternity fulfills its quota-that is, as long as
it has assumed its proportionate share of students from the
housing-demand pool-students living in the draw system will
have the same opportunity to live on-campus during their
upperclass years as the members of the fraternity.
Thus, while the fraternity system is "full," both the
fra cmity system and the draw system will be bearing
proportionate shares of the housing shortage; neither group
of students will be advantaged at the other's expense.
However, if a fraternity consistently is incapable of meeting
its quota, it should lie moved into the draw system, where it
may become a special sign-up fraternity.
Allowing noncompetitive fraternities to remain outside
the draw would violate the principle of "equal opportunity"
for housing and lead quite possibly to a situation where
fraternity members were operating a "boarding house" on
campus for nonmembers. Provisions should be made to
distinguish between a consistently noncompetitive fraternity
and a healthy fraternity having a "bad year."
111. Clarification and Justification of the Proposal
The housing proposal outlined here provides for better
planning on the part of students, most of whom view their
college careers as a continuum of four years rather than four
separate, adapt-as-you-go years.
The new housing system would allow students to make
conscious decisions about their future living arrangements;
this differs from the present system in that sudden, often
reactive, decisions are currently required after the annual
spring draw.
The new system also permits certain flexibility for those
students who develop their programs gradually. As long as
"the books balance" in the housing officc, students may
change their minds about which year they would prefer to
live off-campus.
Under the current system, a student has a chance of living
on-campus for all of his four years at Stanford That chance
still exist under the proposed system, although the likelihood
of it occurring has been diminished.
Also, under the current system a student has a chance of
living of-campus for two of his four years at Stanford. Under
the proposed system, the likelihood of that occurring has
been eliminated.
The subcommittee has sought to alleviate in this proposal
some of the anxiety caused by the year-by-year draw system.
It has also sought a solution to the second major deficiency
of the allocation procedure: presently, transfer students are
not guaranteed on-campus housing for their first year. This
proposal will assure all such students campus housing if they
desire it. On-campus housing for freshmen will continue as
under the present system.
The subcommittee's main objective has been to develop
housing policies that will provide equity to all students. Hrorn
the start, we hoped to accomplish this end while maintaining
fraternities at Stanford.
Although fraternities will lie treated differently from
other houses, they will have no advantage over other houses
with respcct to continuity. Students in both systems will
have identical guarantees.
The system we have proposed provides fraternities with
autonomy and permits members to choose among themselves
which year shall be the off-campus year for each member. It
provides them with predictability and allows them to retain
the subjective selection process and the tradition of rushing
It may spur some fraternities to become more active in
order to increase membership and fill their housing quotas.
Howvver, the subcommittee does not support the sometimes
unhealthy and often inconvenient principle of over-stuffing
the houses.
The subcommittee feels that over-stuffing creates undesir
able living conditions, and thus lowers the quality of residen

tial life. This proposal works on the principle of using all the
spaces we have and giving all on-campus students good
housing spaces. In no case should equity be sacrificed by
granting to one system any significant privilege not granted
to the other.
IV. Proceedings of the Subcommittee
The subcommittee's task began with a thorough review of
the entire housing system at Stanford, not simply a review of
an isolated part of it such as fraternities, independent houses,
or dormitories. Our goal was to establish a framework within
which housing policies could be set for the next decade.
In light of these goals, the subcommittee defined tentative
housing principles which would guide its approach to the
housing issues. The most important of these principles
asserted that any proposal for an alternate system would be
based upon fairness to presently enrolled students. The
subcommittee did not consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni.
Rarly in its proceedings the subcomittee agreed that the
present system discriminated in some way against both men
and women. The subcommittee felt that this discrimination
was most noticeably manifest in the issue of equal access to
on-campus housing. We decided that equity could be estab
lished only if the all-male fraternities draw-exemption was
extended to include women or removed from the currently
exempt fraternity groups. The first alternative, extension, in
its mildest form, would mean extending draw-exemption to
include equal numbers of women and men.
In considering any extension, we debated whether we
really wished to establish one more select group on campus
to counterbalance the effects of the first draw-exempt group,
the fraternities. Since we wished to be fair to all the students,
not simply to equal numbers of men and women students, we
concluded that an extension of the privileges now enjoyed by
draw-exempt houses would result in one group of students
being handsomely advantaged at the expense of another
group of students. That result was unacceptable to all of us,
and therefore extension of the draw-exemption privilege of
fraternities was rejected unanimously.
On the other hand, the subcommittee recognized the
fraternity as one living option at a university which prides
itself on the spectrum of residential programs offered to its
students. Thus, the subcommittee sought a proposal which,
in providing equal access to on-campus housing for all
students, would not destroy the present fraternal establish
ments.
With these two objectives in mind, the subcommittee
turned to its second major alternative after extension-that of
removing the draw exemption from the fraternities. Ultimate
ly, the subcommittee chose to remove the guaranteed con
tinuity advantages of the fraternity draw-exemption. This
ensures that all students will share equally in the burden of
the housing shortage, and provides for the continuation of
the fraternity living option at Stanford.
Subjective Selectivity
Having resolved the primary issue of equal access, the
subcommittee then turned to the lesser issue of subjective
selectivity, which currently exists only in the all-male frater
nities. In considering the significance of this issue, the
subcommittee debated whether the subjective process per
mitted in the fraternity system constituted serious discrimi
nation against women, as well as the rest of the student body.
Our conclusion on this matter was shaped according to
responses to the following questions:
1. Should subjective selectivity be regarded as a privilege,
or is it primarily an imposition both to the students judging
and to those students being judged?
2. What are the results of subjective selectivity for the
participating house, for the individual students who are
selected, and for the individual students who are rejected?
3. What are the purposes of subjective selectivity? Can
they be achieved through other means?
Having examined these questions, the subcommittee con
cluded that students should lie permitted to choose whatever
educational opportunities and facilities suit them best, in
cluding their residential programs. Houses should not choose
the students: students should choose their houses. We believe
that for the majority of students, subjective selectivity would
represent a drawback rather than a privilege.
Subjective selectivity could result in a house, perhaps the
most desired facility on campus, being controlled by a single
student group, It would thus detract from the system of fair
allocation of Stanford facilities. The students living in that
house would have to assume the roles of judges once a year,
thus exercising significant power over fellow students.
We recogni/e that within the system of subjective selecti
vity, fraternities may enjoy geniality and common purpose
within a house, development of a sense of responsibility
towards one's fellow house members, the fostering of social

discipline and mutual helpfulness within the house, and
establishment of close friendships and organizational loyal
ties.
However, the subcommittee maintains that these features
can also be achieved by a house establishing a list of objective
criteria. Writing an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the outside of a house could be directed toward
finding a group of students mutually interested in living, for a
common purpose, in a particular house.
Having discussed the issue of subjective selectivity, the
subcommittee studied three alternative courses of action and
their results-ex tension, withdrawal, or retention of the
status quo.
If we voted to extend the option, we would have to
decide who, exactly, would receive the option according to a
specific list of criteria designed to answer present and future
requests. And again, we would be creating a new differential
ho'ising group to equalize the effects of the fraternities, a
result which had been rejected previously on the issue of
equal access.
In addition, we would be creating that group by ex
tending a method of selection which is not universally
pcrceived as wise or even necessary in order for student living
groups to establish common purposes' within a house. l or
these reasons, we do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the University should seek to
foster.
We then studied the second alternative-withdrawal of the
option from all students. We found no compelling reason to
withdraw the option from a large group of students (over
500) who have found it personally acceptable and who regard
it as a strength of their houses.
Finally, the subcommittee considered the retention of
subjective selectivity in the fraternities as it presently exists.
Since we considered the matter a secondary issue, we dealt
with it as one on which we could compromise, unlike the
major issue of equal access. The subcommittee, therefore,
decided to recommend retention of the option in fraternities
on the basis of its historical significance and perceived value
to fraternities.
The subcommittee recommends, however, that a frater
nity should lose this option if any substantial change takes
place within a house concerning theme, composition, or
other change affecting the inherent, traditional nature of that
house.
The subcommittee, if contested on its recommendation to
retain subjective selectivity for fraternities, would vote to
remove this feature entirely from the housing system rather
than extend it to any living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities.
V. Summary and Conclusion
In summary, the Subcommittee recommends a broad
revision in housing policies which would guarantee on-cam
pus housing to entering freshmen for at least 3 years and to
transfer students for at least their first year here. Fraternities,
while retaining subjective selectivity, would be required to
fulfill a proportionate share of on-campus housing demand.
The subcommittee views this program as straightforward,
workable, and fair to all students. It is based on the realities
of the current housing shortage and the hope that the
shortajs will lie gradually alleviated. We strongly recommend
that new housing be given priority in the allocation of
University funds. Students should be able to concentrate on
obtaining an education, and not be forced to hassle with the
scarcity of housing spaces.
The Subcommittee on Residences submits this proposal
with respectful confidence that it addresses the interests of
all Stanford students-dormitory residents, fraternity mem
bers, off-campus students, and transfer students. This pro
posal has the unanimous approval of the Subcommittee on
Residences.

I. The History of the Subcommittee
In February 1974, Mpha Sigma Phi, a coeducational
fraternity, petitioned the Dean of Student Affairs to be
exempted from the housing draw. Their proposal asserted
that the current undergraduate housing system was discrimi
natory on the basis of sex because only the all-male fraterni
ties were allowed the privilege of draw exemption.
Alpha Sigma Phi's petition was denied unanimously by a
Housing Configuration Panel; members of the panel felt that,
once extended to Alpha Sigma Phi, the privilege of draw
exemption would have to be extended to other coeducational
fraternities and possibly to all small living groups. However,
the panel recognized the validity of Alpha Sigma Phi's charge
of discrimination and recommended that a special committee
be established to study the question and seek a solution.
In response to this issue and other increasingly complex
housing issues, the Committee on Student Services decided in
one of its first meetings of 1974-75 to form a Subcommittee
on Residences. That subcommittee met for the first time on
November 8, 1974, and generally held sessions twice a week
thereafter.
The membership of the subcommittee consists of the
following persons:
a) Three students nominated by the ASSU Nominations
Committee;
b) three members of the parent committee, two of these
appointees serving as cochairpersons of the committee;
c) one faculty or staff member recommended by the
president;
d) three ex-officio members: the student chairperson of
COSS, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Iducation, and the Director of Housing and Food Services.
11. Recommendations of the Subcommittee on Residences
The Subcommittee, after over 2 months of study, recom
mends revising the present housing assignment system in
several important ways. The primary new component of the
subcommittee's proposed system is guaranteed housing for
specific years.
All entering freshmen would be guaranteed some campus
housing for their freshman year and two specific subsequent
years. During their freshman year, students would indicate
which two upperclass years they wanted guaranteed; these
preferences should be honored as much as administratively
feasible; and, when possible, students should be allowed to
change their preferences at a later date, liven if some
preferences for specific years could not be granted, all
entering freshmen could be guaranteed three years of on-cam
pus housing during their four-year career.
furthermore, under the proposed system, all entering
autumn-quarter transfer students who desired to live on-cam
pus would be accommodated for their first year. In addition,
we recommend that sophomore transfer students be guaran
teed one more year on-campus.
If implemented, this system would give all entering
freshmen an equal opportunity to live on-campus in their
future years at Stanford as well as ease the housing difficul
ties of transfer students. Implementation of the proposal
would also modify both the present draw and fraternity
systems. The impact of the proposal on each of these systems
is outlined below.
The Draw System
The subcommittee's proposal retains the draw. This draw
would determine who will live in which on-campus facility as
well as who will receive the residual housing (i.e., the extra
spaces which are not already guaranteed to students), thus
providing some with a fourth year of on-campus housing. We
assess the draw as being the fairest method we have to
allocate existing facilities.

The draw system would operate as it currently does, but
with the following exception: students drawing for a
"guaranteed" year would receive some on-campus housing
assignment regardless of their draw number. Which house a
guaranteed student is assigned to would depend on 1) the
student's choices, and 2) the student's draw number and
priorities.
The Fraternity System
The all-male fraternities could continue to rush new
members in the current manner. However, each fraternity
would be required to fill a quota. A fraternity's quota would
represent its proportionate share of the demand for on-cam
pus housing.
As long as the demand for housing exceeds the supply, a
fraternity's quota will be larger than the number of spaces in
the fraternity. Members of the fraternity could collectively
decide who would live in the house and who would live off
campus each year, as long as each student may live on-cam
pus at least 2 of his 3 upperclass years.
As long as a fraternity fulfills its quota-that is, as long as
it has assumed its proportionate share of students from the
housing-demand pool-students living in the draw system will
have the same opportunity to live on-campus during their
upperclass years as the members of the fraternity.
Thus, while the fraternity system is "full," both the
fra cmity system and the draw system will be bearing
proportionate shares of the housing shortage; neither group
of students will be advantaged at the other's expense.
However, if a fraternity consistently is incapable of meeting
its quota, it should lie moved into the draw system, where it
may become a special sign-up fraternity.
Allowing noncompetitive fraternities to remain outside
the draw would violate the principle of "equal opportunity"
for housing and lead quite possibly to a situation where
fraternity members were operating a "boarding house" on
campus for nonmembers. Provisions should be made to
distinguish between a consistently noncompetitive fraternity
and a healthy fraternity having a "bad year."
111. Clarification and Justification of the Proposal
The housing proposal outlined here provides for better
planning on the part of students, most of whom view their
college careers as a continuum of four years rather than four
separate, adapt-as-you-go years.
The new housing system would allow students to make
conscious decisions about their future living arrangements;
this differs from the present system in that sudden, often
reactive, decisions are currently required after the annual
spring draw.
The new system also permits certain flexibility for those
students who develop their programs gradually. As long as
"the books balance" in the housing officc, students may
change their minds about which year they would prefer to
live off-campus.
Under the current system, a student has a chance of living
on-campus for all of his four years at Stanford That chance
still exist under the proposed system, although the likelihood
of it occurring has been diminished.
Also, under the current system a student has a chance of
living of-campus for two of his four years at Stanford. Under
the proposed system, the likelihood of that occurring has
been eliminated.
The subcommittee has sought to alleviate in this proposal
some of the anxiety caused by the year-by-year draw system.
It has also sought a solution to the second major deficiency
of the allocation procedure: presently, transfer students are
not guaranteed on-campus housing for their first year. This
proposal will assure all such students campus housing if they
desire it. On-campus housing for freshmen will continue as
under the present system.
The subcommittee's main objective has been to develop
housing policies that will provide equity to all students. Hrorn
the start, we hoped to accomplish this end while maintaining
fraternities at Stanford.
Although fraternities will lie treated differently from
other houses, they will have no advantage over other houses
with respcct to continuity. Students in both systems will
have identical guarantees.
The system we have proposed provides fraternities with
autonomy and permits members to choose among themselves
which year shall be the off-campus year for each member. It
provides them with predictability and allows them to retain
the subjective selection process and the tradition of rushing
It may spur some fraternities to become more active in
order to increase membership and fill their housing quotas.
Howvver, the subcommittee does not support the sometimes
unhealthy and often inconvenient principle of over-stuffing
the houses.
The subcommittee feels that over-stuffing creates undesir
able living conditions, and thus lowers the quality of residen

tial life. This proposal works on the principle of using all the
spaces we have and giving all on-campus students good
housing spaces. In no case should equity be sacrificed by
granting to one system any significant privilege not granted
to the other.
IV. Proceedings of the Subcommittee
The subcommittee's task began with a thorough review of
the entire housing system at Stanford, not simply a review of
an isolated part of it such as fraternities, independent houses,
or dormitories. Our goal was to establish a framework within
which housing policies could be set for the next decade.
In light of these goals, the subcommittee defined tentative
housing principles which would guide its approach to the
housing issues. The most important of these principles
asserted that any proposal for an alternate system would be
based upon fairness to presently enrolled students. The
subcommittee did not consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni.
Rarly in its proceedings the subcomittee agreed that the
present system discriminated in some way against both men
and women. The subcommittee felt that this discrimination
was most noticeably manifest in the issue of equal access to
on-campus housing. We decided that equity could be estab
lished only if the all-male fraternities draw-exemption was
extended to include women or removed from the currently
exempt fraternity groups. The first alternative, extension, in
its mildest form, would mean extending draw-exemption to
include equal numbers of women and men.
In considering any extension, we debated whether we
really wished to establish one more select group on campus
to counterbalance the effects of the first draw-exempt group,
the fraternities. Since we wished to be fair to all the students,
not simply to equal numbers of men and women students, we
concluded that an extension of the privileges now enjoyed by
draw-exempt houses would result in one group of students
being handsomely advantaged at the expense of another
group of students. That result was unacceptable to all of us,
and therefore extension of the draw-exemption privilege of
fraternities was rejected unanimously.
On the other hand, the subcommittee recognized the
fraternity as one living option at a university which prides
itself on the spectrum of residential programs offered to its
students. Thus, the subcommittee sought a proposal which,
in providing equal access to on-campus housing for all
students, would not destroy the present fraternal establish
ments.
With these two objectives in mind, the subcommittee
turned to its second major alternative after extension-that of
removing the draw exemption from the fraternities. Ultimate
ly, the subcommittee chose to remove the guaranteed con
tinuity advantages of the fraternity draw-exemption. This
ensures that all students will share equally in the burden of
the housing shortage, and provides for the continuation of
the fraternity living option at Stanford.
Subjective Selectivity
Having resolved the primary issue of equal access, the
subcommittee then turned to the lesser issue of subjective
selectivity, which currently exists only in the all-male frater
nities. In considering the significance of this issue, the
subcommittee debated whether the subjective process per
mitted in the fraternity system constituted serious discrimi
nation against women, as well as the rest of the student body.
Our conclusion on this matter was shaped according to
responses to the following questions:
1. Should subjective selectivity be regarded as a privilege,
or is it primarily an imposition both to the students judging
and to those students being judged?
2. What are the results of subjective selectivity for the
participating house, for the individual students who are
selected, and for the individual students who are rejected?
3. What are the purposes of subjective selectivity? Can
they be achieved through other means?
Having examined these questions, the subcommittee con
cluded that students should lie permitted to choose whatever
educational opportunities and facilities suit them best, in
cluding their residential programs. Houses should not choose
the students: students should choose their houses. We believe
that for the majority of students, subjective selectivity would
represent a drawback rather than a privilege.
Subjective selectivity could result in a house, perhaps the
most desired facility on campus, being controlled by a single
student group, It would thus detract from the system of fair
allocation of Stanford facilities. The students living in that
house would have to assume the roles of judges once a year,
thus exercising significant power over fellow students.
We recogni/e that within the system of subjective selecti
vity, fraternities may enjoy geniality and common purpose
within a house, development of a sense of responsibility
towards one's fellow house members, the fostering of social

discipline and mutual helpfulness within the house, and
establishment of close friendships and organizational loyal
ties.
However, the subcommittee maintains that these features
can also be achieved by a house establishing a list of objective
criteria. Writing an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the outside of a house could be directed toward
finding a group of students mutually interested in living, for a
common purpose, in a particular house.
Having discussed the issue of subjective selectivity, the
subcommittee studied three alternative courses of action and
their results-ex tension, withdrawal, or retention of the
status quo.
If we voted to extend the option, we would have to
decide who, exactly, would receive the option according to a
specific list of criteria designed to answer present and future
requests. And again, we would be creating a new differential
ho'ising group to equalize the effects of the fraternities, a
result which had been rejected previously on the issue of
equal access.
In addition, we would be creating that group by ex
tending a method of selection which is not universally
pcrceived as wise or even necessary in order for student living
groups to establish common purposes' within a house. l or
these reasons, we do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the University should seek to
foster.
We then studied the second alternative-withdrawal of the
option from all students. We found no compelling reason to
withdraw the option from a large group of students (over
500) who have found it personally acceptable and who regard
it as a strength of their houses.
Finally, the subcommittee considered the retention of
subjective selectivity in the fraternities as it presently exists.
Since we considered the matter a secondary issue, we dealt
with it as one on which we could compromise, unlike the
major issue of equal access. The subcommittee, therefore,
decided to recommend retention of the option in fraternities
on the basis of its historical significance and perceived value
to fraternities.
The subcommittee recommends, however, that a frater
nity should lose this option if any substantial change takes
place within a house concerning theme, composition, or
other change affecting the inherent, traditional nature of that
house.
The subcommittee, if contested on its recommendation to
retain subjective selectivity for fraternities, would vote to
remove this feature entirely from the housing system rather
than extend it to any living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities.
V. Summary and Conclusion
In summary, the Subcommittee recommends a broad
revision in housing policies which would guarantee on-cam
pus housing to entering freshmen for at least 3 years and to
transfer students for at least their first year here. Fraternities,
while retaining subjective selectivity, would be required to
fulfill a proportionate share of on-campus housing demand.
The subcommittee views this program as straightforward,
workable, and fair to all students. It is based on the realities
of the current housing shortage and the hope that the
shortajs will lie gradually alleviated. We strongly recommend
that new housing be given priority in the allocation of
University funds. Students should be able to concentrate on
obtaining an education, and not be forced to hassle with the
scarcity of housing spaces.
The Subcommittee on Residences submits this proposal
with respectful confidence that it addresses the interests of
all Stanford students-dormitory residents, fraternity mem
bers, off-campus students, and transfer students. This pro
posal has the unanimous approval of the Subcommittee on
Residences.

I. The History of the Subcommittee
In February 1974, Mpha Sigma Phi, a coeducational
fraternity, petitioned the Dean of Student Affairs to be
exempted from the housing draw. Their proposal asserted
that the current undergraduate housing system was discrimi
natory on the basis of sex because only the all-male fraterni
ties were allowed the privilege of draw exemption.
Alpha Sigma Phi's petition was denied unanimously by a
Housing Configuration Panel; members of the panel felt that,
once extended to Alpha Sigma Phi, the privilege of draw
exemption would have to be extended to other coeducational
fraternities and possibly to all small living groups. However,
the panel recognized the validity of Alpha Sigma Phi's charge
of discrimination and recommended that a special committee
be established to study the question and seek a solution.
In response to this issue and other increasingly complex
housing issues, the Committee on Student Services decided in
one of its first meetings of 1974-75 to form a Subcommittee
on Residences. That subcommittee met for the first time on
November 8, 1974, and generally held sessions twice a week
thereafter.
The membership of the subcommittee consists of the
following persons:
a) Three students nominated by the ASSU Nominations
Committee;
b) three members of the parent committee, two of these
appointees serving as cochairpersons of the committee;
c) one faculty or staff member recommended by the
president;
d) three ex-officio members: the student chairperson of
COSS, the Associate Dean of Student Affairs for Residential
Iducation, and the Director of Housing and Food Services.
11. Recommendations of the Subcommittee on Residences
The Subcommittee, after over 2 months of study, recom
mends revising the present housing assignment system in
several important ways. The primary new component of the
subcommittee's proposed system is guaranteed housing for
specific years.
All entering freshmen would be guaranteed some campus
housing for their freshman year and two specific subsequent
years. During their freshman year, students would indicate
which two upperclass years they wanted guaranteed; these
preferences should be honored as much as administratively
feasible; and, when possible, students should be allowed to
change their preferences at a later date, liven if some
preferences for specific years could not be granted, all
entering freshmen could be guaranteed three years of on-cam
pus housing during their four-year career.
furthermore, under the proposed system, all entering
autumn-quarter transfer students who desired to live on-cam
pus would be accommodated for their first year. In addition,
we recommend that sophomore transfer students be guaran
teed one more year on-campus.
If implemented, this system would give all entering
freshmen an equal opportunity to live on-campus in their
future years at Stanford as well as ease the housing difficul
ties of transfer students. Implementation of the proposal
would also modify both the present draw and fraternity
systems. The impact of the proposal on each of these systems
is outlined below.
The Draw System
The subcommittee's proposal retains the draw. This draw
would determine who will live in which on-campus facility as
well as who will receive the residual housing (i.e., the extra
spaces which are not already guaranteed to students), thus
providing some with a fourth year of on-campus housing. We
assess the draw as being the fairest method we have to
allocate existing facilities.

The draw system would operate as it currently does, but
with the following exception: students drawing for a
"guaranteed" year would receive some on-campus housing
assignment regardless of their draw number. Which house a
guaranteed student is assigned to would depend on 1) the
student's choices, and 2) the student's draw number and
priorities.
The Fraternity System
The all-male fraternities could continue to rush new
members in the current manner. However, each fraternity
would be required to fill a quota. A fraternity's quota would
represent its proportionate share of the demand for on-cam
pus housing.
As long as the demand for housing exceeds the supply, a
fraternity's quota will be larger than the number of spaces in
the fraternity. Members of the fraternity could collectively
decide who would live in the house and who would live off
campus each year, as long as each student may live on-cam
pus at least 2 of his 3 upperclass years.
As long as a fraternity fulfills its quota-that is, as long as
it has assumed its proportionate share of students from the
housing-demand pool-students living in the draw system will
have the same opportunity to live on-campus during their
upperclass years as the members of the fraternity.
Thus, while the fraternity system is "full," both the
fra cmity system and the draw system will be bearing
proportionate shares of the housing shortage; neither group
of students will be advantaged at the other's expense.
However, if a fraternity consistently is incapable of meeting
its quota, it should lie moved into the draw system, where it
may become a special sign-up fraternity.
Allowing noncompetitive fraternities to remain outside
the draw would violate the principle of "equal opportunity"
for housing and lead quite possibly to a situation where
fraternity members were operating a "boarding house" on
campus for nonmembers. Provisions should be made to
distinguish between a consistently noncompetitive fraternity
and a healthy fraternity having a "bad year."
111. Clarification and Justification of the Proposal
The housing proposal outlined here provides for better
planning on the part of students, most of whom view their
college careers as a continuum of four years rather than four
separate, adapt-as-you-go years.
The new housing system would allow students to make
conscious decisions about their future living arrangements;
this differs from the present system in that sudden, often
reactive, decisions are currently required after the annual
spring draw.
The new system also permits certain flexibility for those
students who develop their programs gradually. As long as
"the books balance" in the housing officc, students may
change their minds about which year they would prefer to
live off-campus.
Under the current system, a student has a chance of living
on-campus for all of his four years at Stanford That chance
still exist under the proposed system, although the likelihood
of it occurring has been diminished.
Also, under the current system a student has a chance of
living of-campus for two of his four years at Stanford. Under
the proposed system, the likelihood of that occurring has
been eliminated.
The subcommittee has sought to alleviate in this proposal
some of the anxiety caused by the year-by-year draw system.
It has also sought a solution to the second major deficiency
of the allocation procedure: presently, transfer students are
not guaranteed on-campus housing for their first year. This
proposal will assure all such students campus housing if they
desire it. On-campus housing for freshmen will continue as
under the present system.
The subcommittee's main objective has been to develop
housing policies that will provide equity to all students. Hrorn
the start, we hoped to accomplish this end while maintaining
fraternities at Stanford.
Although fraternities will lie treated differently from
other houses, they will have no advantage over other houses
with respcct to continuity. Students in both systems will
have identical guarantees.
The system we have proposed provides fraternities with
autonomy and permits members to choose among themselves
which year shall be the off-campus year for each member. It
provides them with predictability and allows them to retain
the subjective selection process and the tradition of rushing
It may spur some fraternities to become more active in
order to increase membership and fill their housing quotas.
Howvver, the subcommittee does not support the sometimes
unhealthy and often inconvenient principle of over-stuffing
the houses.
The subcommittee feels that over-stuffing creates undesir
able living conditions, and thus lowers the quality of residen

tial life. This proposal works on the principle of using all the
spaces we have and giving all on-campus students good
housing spaces. In no case should equity be sacrificed by
granting to one system any significant privilege not granted
to the other.
IV. Proceedings of the Subcommittee
The subcommittee's task began with a thorough review of
the entire housing system at Stanford, not simply a review of
an isolated part of it such as fraternities, independent houses,
or dormitories. Our goal was to establish a framework within
which housing policies could be set for the next decade.
In light of these goals, the subcommittee defined tentative
housing principles which would guide its approach to the
housing issues. The most important of these principles
asserted that any proposal for an alternate system would be
based upon fairness to presently enrolled students. The
subcommittee did not consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni.
Rarly in its proceedings the subcomittee agreed that the
present system discriminated in some way against both men
and women. The subcommittee felt that this discrimination
was most noticeably manifest in the issue of equal access to
on-campus housing. We decided that equity could be estab
lished only if the all-male fraternities draw-exemption was
extended to include women or removed from the currently
exempt fraternity groups. The first alternative, extension, in
its mildest form, would mean extending draw-exemption to
include equal numbers of women and men.
In considering any extension, we debated whether we
really wished to establish one more select group on campus
to counterbalance the effects of the first draw-exempt group,
the fraternities. Since we wished to be fair to all the students,
not simply to equal numbers of men and women students, we
concluded that an extension of the privileges now enjoyed by
draw-exempt houses would result in one group of students
being handsomely advantaged at the expense of another
group of students. That result was unacceptable to all of us,
and therefore extension of the draw-exemption privilege of
fraternities was rejected unanimously.
On the other hand, the subcommittee recognized the
fraternity as one living option at a university which prides
itself on the spectrum of residential programs offered to its
students. Thus, the subcommittee sought a proposal which,
in providing equal access to on-campus housing for all
students, would not destroy the present fraternal establish
ments.
With these two objectives in mind, the subcommittee
turned to its second major alternative after extension-that of
removing the draw exemption from the fraternities. Ultimate
ly, the subcommittee chose to remove the guaranteed con
tinuity advantages of the fraternity draw-exemption. This
ensures that all students will share equally in the burden of
the housing shortage, and provides for the continuation of
the fraternity living option at Stanford.
Subjective Selectivity
Having resolved the primary issue of equal access, the
subcommittee then turned to the lesser issue of subjective
selectivity, which currently exists only in the all-male frater
nities. In considering the significance of this issue, the
subcommittee debated whether the subjective process per
mitted in the fraternity system constituted serious discrimi
nation against women, as well as the rest of the student body.
Our conclusion on this matter was shaped according to
responses to the following questions:
1. Should subjective selectivity be regarded as a privilege,
or is it primarily an imposition both to the students judging
and to those students being judged?
2. What are the results of subjective selectivity for the
participating house, for the individual students who are
selected, and for the individual students who are rejected?
3. What are the purposes of subjective selectivity? Can
they be achieved through other means?
Having examined these questions, the subcommittee con
cluded that students should lie permitted to choose whatever
educational opportunities and facilities suit them best, in
cluding their residential programs. Houses should not choose
the students: students should choose their houses. We believe
that for the majority of students, subjective selectivity would
represent a drawback rather than a privilege.
Subjective selectivity could result in a house, perhaps the
most desired facility on campus, being controlled by a single
student group, It would thus detract from the system of fair
allocation of Stanford facilities. The students living in that
house would have to assume the roles of judges once a year,
thus exercising significant power over fellow students.
We recogni/e that within the system of subjective selecti
vity, fraternities may enjoy geniality and common purpose
within a house, development of a sense of responsibility
towards one's fellow house members, the fostering of social

discipline and mutual helpfulness within the house, and
establishment of close friendships and organizational loyal
ties.
However, the subcommittee maintains that these features
can also be achieved by a house establishing a list of objective
criteria. Writing an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the outside of a house could be directed toward
finding a group of students mutually interested in living, for a
common purpose, in a particular house.
Having discussed the issue of subjective selectivity, the
subcommittee studied three alternative courses of action and
their results-ex tension, withdrawal, or retention of the
status quo.
If we voted to extend the option, we would have to
decide who, exactly, would receive the option according to a
specific list of criteria designed to answer present and future
requests. And again, we would be creating a new differential
ho'ising group to equalize the effects of the fraternities, a
result which had been rejected previously on the issue of
equal access.
In addition, we would be creating that group by ex
tending a method of selection which is not universally
pcrceived as wise or even necessary in order for student living
groups to establish common purposes' within a house. l or
these reasons, we do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future living groups. We do
not feel it is a living aspect the University should seek to
foster.
We then studied the second alternative-withdrawal of the
option from all students. We found no compelling reason to
withdraw the option from a large group of students (over
500) who have found it personally acceptable and who regard
it as a strength of their houses.
Finally, the subcommittee considered the retention of
subjective selectivity in the fraternities as it presently exists.
Since we considered the matter a secondary issue, we dealt
with it as one on which we could compromise, unlike the
major issue of equal access. The subcommittee, therefore,
decided to recommend retention of the option in fraternities
on the basis of its historical significance and perceived value
to fraternities.
The subcommittee recommends, however, that a frater
nity should lose this option if any substantial change takes
place within a house concerning theme, composition, or
other change affecting the inherent, traditional nature of that
house.
The subcommittee, if contested on its recommendation to
retain subjective selectivity for fraternities, would vote to
remove this feature entirely from the housing system rather
than extend it to any living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities.
V. Summary and Conclusion
In summary, the Subcommittee recommends a broad
revision in housing policies which would guarantee on-cam
pus housing to entering freshmen for at least 3 years and to
transfer students for at least their first year here. Fraternities,
while retaining subjective selectivity, would be required to
fulfill a proportionate share of on-campus housing demand.
The subcommittee views this program as straightforward,
workable, and fair to all students. It is based on the realities
of the current housing shortage and the hope that the
shortajs will lie gradually alleviated. We strongly recommend
that new housing be given priority in the allocation of
University funds. Students should be able to concentrate on
obtaining an education, and not be forced to hassle with the
scarcity of housing spaces.
The Subcommittee on Residences submits this proposal
with respectful confidence that it addresses the interests of
all Stanford students-dormitory residents, fraternity mem
bers, off-campus students, and transfer students. This pro
posal has the unanimous approval of the Subcommittee on
Residences.
