# University Will Follow Aid Curves
## 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
Unlike some Ivy League universities,
Stanford will keep pace with more
generous financial aid guidelines set by
the College Scholarship Services (CSS).
CSS, an arm of the Educational
Testing Service, calculates expected
parental contributions which are used
by many universities in computing
scholarship aid awards.
"We're going to go with the CSS
curves," said Director of Financial
Aids Robert Huff. The new guidelines
will apply here to all undergraduates,
including incoming freshmen, Huff
said.
"We're suffering from the financial
crunch as much as anyone else, but
we're not going to attempt to solve the
financial crunch at the expense of
middle-income families," Huff said,
responding to a Daily Princetonian
article which stated that "the Ivy-
League universities and MIT will offer
substantially small financial aid
packages" than CSS called for.
Self-Help Increase
Huff said, "As a part of the
implementation of these curves, we're
going to increase the self-help
component of student aid packages by
about $200.
"Our average self-help expectation
at the present time is around $800 per
student. Changes will probably be
about $200 for next year — so about
$1000 per student next year."
Self-help is money provided by the
student through term-time earnings or
long-term loan.
Comparable To Ivy
According to Huff, "Our program is
comparable to the Ivy institutions" in
aggregate and individual amount
