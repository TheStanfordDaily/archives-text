# University Will Follow Aid Curves
## 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
Unlike some Ivy League universities,
Stanford will keep pace with more
generous financial aid guidelines set by
the College Scholarship Services (CSS).
CSS, an arm of the Educational
Testing Service, calculates expected
parental contributions which are used
by many universities in computing
scholarship aid awards.
"We're going to go with the CSS
curves," said Director of Financial
Aids Robert Huff. The new guidelines
will apply here to all undergraduates,
including incoming freshmen, Huff
said.
"We're suffering from the financial
crunch as much as anyone else, but
we're not going to attempt to solve the
financial crunch at the expense of
middle-income families," Huff said,
responding to a Daily Princetonian
article which stated that "the Ivy-
League universities and MIT will offer
substantially small financial aid
packages" than CSS called for.
Self-Help Increase
Huff said, "As a part of the
implementation of these curves, we're
going to increase the self-help
component of student aid packages by
about $200.
"Our average self-help expectation
at the present time is around $800 per
student. Changes will probably be
about $200 for next year â€” so about
$1000 per student next year."
Self-help is money provided by the
student through term-time earnings or
long-term loan.
Comparable To Ivy
According to Huff, "Our program is
comparable to the Ivy institutions" in
aggregate and individual amount
except that we haven't had to rely on
self-help to the extent that they have."
"Typically," he said, "a student's
need is met by a loan, a job and a
grant or scholarship. In a large measure

we've had the state supporting
students on aid (through state
scholarships]
He claimed that Stanford's self-help
has been relatively low because of the
"state of California and its generous
help."

In some states, state scholarships
may only amount to $600, he said.
California state scholarships pav up to
$2500.
Some 1050 students at Stanford are
California state scholarship or grant
recipients.
Total undergraduate student aid for
the current academic year is about $9
million, said Huff. That amount will
go up next year, he added.
Aid Breakdown
Total aid presently is broken down
into $7 million for scholarships and
grants, $800,000 for jobs and $1.3
million for loans. These will increase
by, respectively, $1.4 million, $50,000
and $400,000 next year under current
projections.
Student loans are a key factor in
Stanford's program.
"We've had very good responses
from the banks toward our students,"
Huff said.
Though "we can find a student a
guaranteed student loan," Huff said,
"we use our own loan funds to back
up the loan."
Outside Resources
He pointed out, however, that "the
University attempts to meet a
student's needs from outside resources
before it utilizes its own."
"About $2.6 million in scholarships
and grants come from outside the
University," he said.
Huff didn't think the adjusted
financial aid packages would affect
prospective enrollees. "We have the
feeling that students don't make up
their minds on financial considerations
as much as the advantages a student
sees in the particular institution. I
think it goes beyond simply 'who's
giving me the best deal.' "
