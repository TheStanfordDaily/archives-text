# Monetary Shifts May Shape $800,000 Overseas Campus Cut

International exchange and
inflation rates could greatly affect the
Overseas Studies Office's planned
1974-75 budget of $800,000,
according to program director Mark
Mancall.
Although "no decision has been
made" on how the $2,072,107 budget
will be cut, Mancall said he is trying to
"bring down the costs" of operations
at individual campuses abroad while
hoping for a change in the monetary
exchange rates.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference last night, Mancall
suggested that renting to foreign
students rooms which could not be
filled by Stanford students would be
one method of reducing costs.
He said, in any case, he "opposed
transferring costs to students."
However, he could not guarantee that
the University would continue to pay
for one-way cross-Atlantic flights if
the Civil Aeronautics Board decides to
eliminate affinity charters.
"We would be up the creek if
affinity flights were cancelled," he
admitted.
50 Percent Cut
Provost William F. Miller
announced last month that general

funds for the overseas campuses would
have to be cut by 50 percent.
At that point, Assoc. Overseas
Studies Director Dbn Price remarked
that his office was considering a
proposal to maintain only one
program in each language area as its
"worst case" contigency plan.
According to the 1974-75 Overseas
Studies budget, the Overseas Studies
Office would still need to cut
$489,919 from its program costs even
after it had limited each language area
to one campus.
Stabilitize Income
Mancall remarked that he would try
to stabilize the income from room and
board fees with the expense for
overseas room and board in orripr to
help compensate for the deficit.
He also said he would prefer to
revamp individual campuses rather
than totally eliminating them.
Commenting on the Cliveden
summer program, "Health Care
Delivery and Public Policy," Mancall
said he had not expected pre-medical
students to fill all 80 of the campus'
allotted spaces.
'Excellent Use'
Although 30 students applying for
the regular program at the British
campus had to be turned away,

Mancall said he thought "turning over
an entire campus to one group is an
excellent use of those facilities."
lie said he would not approve of
limiting a campus to one program
during the academic year, however.
Philosophizing on the purpose of
overseas campuses, Mancall said
providing a "formal structure" in
academics is more important than
providing for a student's "personal
growth" or traveling experience.
He said he hopes to pare his own
overseas traveling to reduce costs.
