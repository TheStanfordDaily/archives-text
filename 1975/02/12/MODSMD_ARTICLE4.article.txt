# Aid Report Asks No Racial Basis
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA) proposed, in a report issued
last night, that very low-income
students be treated the same,
regardless of race, when being
considered for financial aid.
All students from low-income
families would be expected to provide
$450 in self-help during their first
year. The amount could be covered by
loan rather than by work, if desired.
Self-help is money provided either by
a job during the academic year or a
long-term, low-interest loan.
CUAFA Chairman Paul Green, a
biology professor here, said the new
special aid package for low-income
students shifts the basis for financial
aid from an "ethnic criterion to an
economic criterion."
The committee's report, to be
submitted to the Faculty Senate
tomorrow, notes that "public
discussion of financial aid packaging
emphasized the desirability of
minimizing the obligation in the first
year."
The committee initially issued a
draft proposal recommending a $700
self-help requirement during freshman
year for students from very
low-income families, regardless of race.
Sharp Criticism
This proposal drew sharp criticism
from minority students here for many
reasons, including lack of minority
student input and insufficient evidence
to support a change in the system.

Green noted that the "draft proposal
was intended to draw constructive
criticism."
Through this year, the University
has met all demonstrated financial
need of blacks, chicanos and American
Indians through scholarships and
grants during their freshman year. For
other students, the average self-help
expectation has been $800.
The committee also proposed that
minority students outside the very
low-income category be required to
pay 84 percent of the self-help
expected of non-minority students in
other aid categories. This difference
would average approximately $200 in
most instances. Such a reduced
requirement is currently in effect.
'An Inducement'
"This modification is viewed as an
inducement [similar to] the reduced
self-help expectation (currently)
applied to other students the
University wishes to attract," the
committee said.
During their first year, most
moderate and middle income minority
students would have a maximum
self-help expectation of $800, rising to
$1100 by their senior year.
The CUAFA report stated that
these measures are "consonant with
the objective of enrolling the best
possible students, regardless of ability
to pay." The committee indicated that
individual exceptions should be made
"in those cases where the new
packaging formulas would produce
undue hardship."
Low-Income Level
According to a Bureau of Labor
Statistics analysis, which the College
Scholarship Service (CSS) uses, a
student from a three-child family with
a net income of $9070 would fall in
the very low-income category. The
University uses CSS data to determine
the income level of a student's family.
Director of Admissions Robert
Huff indicated that the need for a new
policy was based on changes in average
economic and academic status of
minority students from 1968, when
the current policy went into effect.
"Virtually all minority students
were low-income" then, he said. That
is "now not the case."
In 1969-70, for example, 10
minority freshmen, or about nine
percent, came from families with
incomes of $15,000 or more. By last
fall that number rose to 40, or 27
percent.
Green said that "nobody told us we
have to adjust our policy," but has
indicated the same general rationale as
Huff for undertaking the issue.
Total scholarship and grant aid
received by undergraduates is expected
to rise from about $7 million in
1974-75 to $8.4 million next year,
according to Huff.
He said that the need of an average
student will rise about $1370 next
year from the current level.
This will reflect a $700 cut the
average expected parental contribution
(see story on page 1), increased tuition
(from $3375 to $3810) and
presumably rising room and board
rates, Huff noted.
