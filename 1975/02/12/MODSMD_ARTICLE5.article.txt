## Senator Sam's Legend Lives On 
### MARK FUNK 
SAN FRANCISCO — Just three years ago, the same
crowd that gave retired Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.) a
standing ovation as he entered the University of San
Francisco's Memorial Gymnasium Monday night would
probably have dismissed him as an old Southern
reactionary.
But that was before the Watergate hearings.
Television brought Ervin into the nation's homes on
most days during the summer of 1973. Americans
watched as the Senate's foremost constitutional
authority spun homilies and bounced biblical quotations
off the heads of reticent lieutenants of the Nixon
administration.
The crowd of 4000 which jammed Memorial Gym
came to view the legend Sam Ervin has become.
Instead, they saw Ervin as a very human, very dignified
man who has served the people of North Carolina and
the United States for over 22 years. Philosophically, he
is still the strict constitutionalist to whom then-Vice
President Richard M. Nixon administered the oath of
office in 1952. , , A _
And the crowd really hadn t expected that. The
audience was a meeting of the new and old of the
Democratic Party — all the way from the three young
women who sat cross-legged in the aisle to the old
Carolinian who just wanted to ask, "Senator Sam, how
are things in Jackson County?"
The majority, however, were apparently happy, and
on this occasion even proud, to wear the label "liberal."
After all, wasn't Ervin the senator who slapped the
"conservative" Nixon's bottom after he and his boys
were caught with their hands in the constitutional
cookie jar?
Only midway through the senator's talk did it dawn
on some in the crowd that his interpretation of the
lIIIIIIIIIIVIIIIIIIIIIINtHNNVHNMMHIINNIifIHMMIIIIIIIIIItIIIIIMIIIIIIIIMIIIII

constitution differed markedly from theirs. The label •
liberal just did not fit Ervin well. The realization had a s
cooling effect.
And the senator's speech never even dealt with :
Watergate. He chose instead to talk on the ramifications j
of the First Amendment. It was a superb lesson in the j
intricacies of the Constitution. But that wasn't what the g
people had come to hear.
Only in an ensuing question-and-answer period was j
Watergate brought to the fore. But not before some \
individuals heatedly disputed Ervin's interpretation of j
'„h? Constitution.
Someone asked about gun control, and Ervin said h« j
voted against most such measure? because "most of the j
people that own guns know how to use them." The j
crowd was a bit taken aback.
Ervin scored points on Southeast Asia, however.!
when he leaned close to the microphone and said in a j
soft Southern drawl, "We made two mistakes. We should g
not be policemen for the entire universe and we never j
should have fought a land war in Asia." Warm response.!
Ervin said he thought aid to Vietnam should be cut, and j
the applause grew.
But then Ervin stated that all foreign aid should tx j
cut. And, except for a few scattered pockets, th« j
applause ceased. That would mean cutting off aid to i
India and sub-Sahara Africa, too.
Finally, however, the focus turned to Watergate, and 5
the old aura that had surrounded in 1973 seemed |
to return. He told a story about a studious convict who |
went to the prison librarian and asked if "All the 5
President's Men" was in. And the librarian said, "No, but g
at the rate convictions are coming in, they should b< :
here soon."
He had the crowd in the palm of his hand again. j
