## ASSU's Hirings 
### 
ASSU President Mike Herman proposed last week that
the ASSU hire Dave Martin as full-time financial manager,
beginning in the 1975-76 school year. We urge the ASSU
Senate, which is scheduled to consider the proposal tonight,
to reject it and continue to hire a student as financial
manager.
We have no objection to Martin personally. We simply do
not believe that it is in the best interest of the ASSU to have
a full-time financial manager.
First of all, Herman's major justification for the proposal
is that he does not want a full-time special events director
working for a part-time financial manager.
We reiterate our request that the ASSU hire Danny Scher
as full-time special events director, and are pleased that
Herman now agrees with our position. We do not think,
however, that Scher needs a high-priced watchdog.
The ASSU Typesetting Shop is currently run by a
full-time manager working under the part-time student
financial manager. We have seen no problems with this
arrangement. Special Events, like the Typesetting Shop, is
financed out of its own revenues, and we see no substantive
difference between the two directorships.
Our second reason for rejecting Herman's proposal is that
it is economically unsound. It is estimated that Martin
would not accept the ASSU post for less than $18,000 per
year. The current student financial manager, Frank Olivieri,
makes only $6500 during his one-year term.
The increased salary would have to be paid out of the
$92,000 the University annually gives the ASSU â€” not out
of profits, as Scher would be paid.
Herman and Olivieri argue that the ASSU currently does
not spend its entire budget, and that the additional money
to pay Martin would come out of funds the ASSU annually
gives back to the University. We do not approve of wasting
anyone's money by hiring a full-time financial manager.
Our final reason for rejecting the plan is that Olivieri's
argument that a full-time financial manager is needed to
handle the expansion of the ASSU is presumptuous.
Stanford students have never said they wanted a large ASSU
with many employees and costly projects. Students never
indicated they wanted the addition of any projects which
conceivably could burden them with large deficits and
chronic fee assessments.
If the ASSU Council of Presidents and student financial
manager really think it necessary that a full-time financial
manager be hired, they should produce a more well-founded
proposal next year. In the meantime, we don't want to see a
costly proposal rammed down students' throats.
