# Do Finances Influence Tenuring?
## 
### William Ross 
It may be more than coincidental that the
Appointments and Promotions (A & P)
Committee has denied tenure to several
professors who were strongly supported for
tenure by their departments at the same time
that the administration here has started a
major financial austerity program.
Administrators have consistently
emphasized that faculty are a major burden
in the budget. The faculty size has been more
or less frozen and in interviews with
University administrators, I have often been
told that they have considered leaving some
staff vacancies unfilled.
Following the A & P Committee's startling
decision to deny tenure to three professors in
the Classics Department, some graduate
students there have speculated that financial
considerations may have motivated the
committee's decision.
At first glance, any other explanation
seems implausible. The three instructors
denied tenure — William Berg, Ronald Mellor
and John Moore — all are distinguished
classicists, according to Classics Prof. Mark
Edwards and Yale Prof. C. John Harrington,
both leaders in their profession.
It is hard to believe that the committee
would reject the tenure candidates on the
basis of their scholarship, blatantly
disregarding the department's judgment and
willfully damaging departmental prestige.
Therefore, the financial explanation at
first seems a credible way to make sense out
of the committee's decision.
By denying tenure to the three professors,
the University can save more than $40,000 in
a year, assuming that the posts remain vacant
for that period of time. This saving would
constitute approximately three percent of
the University's estimated deficit for 1975 —
a significant proportion when one considers
the University's emphasis on cutting costs

wherever possible.
Since the Classics Department seems small
and relatively obscure, perhaps the
University's A & P Committee reasoned that
its decision wouldn't create the furor that
similar action in another department would
trigger.
As one of the three fired professors told
me in a Daily interview last week, "the small
departments are not listened to as seriously
as are the large ones."
But the theory that financial
considerations lurk behind the tenure denial

nas one major flaw: it is rejected by almost
everyone connected with the Classics
Department.
All three of the professors fired by the
University insist that ignorance by the A & P
Committee of what constitutes worthwhile
published scholarship in classics led to the
denials of tenure.
Mellor, for example, pointed out that the
department intends to fill his post with a
more senior scholar. Mellor claimed that
while he is paid $14,000 by the department,
his successor will probably garn«r $24,000.
One classics professor explained that the
departmert "is trying to make each
appointment have as much professional
visibility as possible."
But Mellor and others in the department

neglected to consider the possibility that the
University administration will stall its
decision on replacements for as long as
possible.
Berg told the Daily last week that "one
can never tell how the deans will respond to a
proposed appointment." They may refuse to
accept appointments made by the
department, he pointed out.
Indeed, the University probably won't
even have to purposely stall on the
appointments in order to keep the posts open
and save money.
Just as most students and professors in the
classics don't believe that the University is
trying to save money by denying tenure to
the three men, they also agree that there is
no attempt underway to reduce the size of
the Classics Department.
Moore, now at Boston University, said
that while many people in East Coast classics
departments are speculating about whether
Stanford is trying to eliminate its graduate
program, he believes that no such plans exist.
Meanwhile, administrators categorically
insist that tenure has never been denied
anyone for financial reasons.
But the apparent lack of justification for
the A & P Committee's recent decisions make
it impossible to ignore the possibility that
financial considerations were a factor in the
committee's actions.
If finances were involved, then the
committee should cast off its pretenses about
rejecting scholars for not publishing enough
material and admit that the University wants
to cut costs by denying tenure.
Such an action wouldn't justify the
committee's actions, but at least it would free
it of hypocrisy.
