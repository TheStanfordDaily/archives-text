Gymnast Extraordinaire
Editor:
"Across the Sports Desk,"
(Daily, Feb. 3), contained a brief
summary of the gymnastics meet
against Chico State. We
acknowledge the fine efforts of
Bob Farb and Bob Anderson that
evening. Unfortunately, mention
of another outstanding member of
the team was entirely omitted.
Granted, a victory for Ted
Marcy on side horse is now
generally expected, but we feel his
unparalleled performances deserve
at least comparable coverage.

Incomplete Research
Editor:
I am amazed, in these days of
women's liberation and the
considerable knowledge about
women it has already produced, at
the amount of blatantly sexist
university research that persists. I
refer to the traditional male
psychiatrist peering into that most
marvelous mystery, women's
sexual behavior. I refer to Warren
B. Miller's study of why abortion
patients became pregnant (Daily,
Jan. 21).
It's hardly news that women
aren't supposed to plan for sexual
activity, and that they frequently
don't.
One of the disappointments in
a study such as Miller's is that he
asks the age-old question: Why Do
Those Victims Continue To Be
Victimized? And his answers are
the same as they've always been.
A more imaginative approach, and
one that might potentially
contribute to the amelioration of
this source of human misery,
would be to interview men who
have unintentionally made women
pregnant.
They have invariably played an
active part. Men not only hear
about unplanned pregnancy, they
talk about it and worry about it.
They are known to plan ahead for
sex more than women do. What
psychological process causes a
man to jeopardize his future and
that of his partner when he has
intercourse without trying to
prevent pregnancy?
Searching for the
"psychological causes" of
unplanned pregnancy in women is
not only old-fashioned, it is
irresponsible. It maintains the
tradition of ignoring half the
casual process.
