# UNGRASPEL Plan Arouses Opposition
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
UNGRASPEL is an unlikely name
for an umbrella agency covering
experimental courses. But it is at the
core of the ongoing battle between
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs and the soon to be terminated
SWOPSI and SCIRE programs.
UNGRASPEL (the Undergraduate
Special Agency) has been proposed by
Gibbs to take the place of SCIRE,
which will be terminated in June, and
SWOPSI and the Undergraduate
Specials, scheduled to be eliminated
the following year.
Some of the functions of SWOPSI
and SCIRE will be absorbed by
traditional departments. However, in
cases where departments will not
accept the workshops, UNGRASPEL
will continue them.
The proposal is currently under
consideration by the Provost's Office.
Many working in SWOPSI and
SCIRE have interpreted the proposal
as an attempt to transfer control of
the programs away from students and
into the dean's office.
Character Will Not Change
However, Gibbs claims the
reorganization is due to necessary
budget cuts. He also said it will give
permanence to experimental education
programs without changing their
identity.
In particular, Gibbs claims that the
character of SWOPSI's
"action-oriented" workshops would
remain unchanged. These workshops
apply field research methods to find
solutions to problems such as prison
reform and public transportation.
There will be fewer workshops
under the new agency, Gibbs said.

Departments may be reluctant to work
with the "parafaculty" who often
serve as instructors. Other courses may
not be accepted because of their
controversial nature. Gibbs said
UNGRASPEL will only be able to
sponsor a limited number of courses
because of reductions in staff.
Gibbs' original proposal called for a
half-time director for UNGRASPEL.
Both SWOPSI and SCIRE each have a
full-time director and a half-time
assistant. The Undergraduate Specials
have a half-time director.
Increase In Staff
However, last night Gibbs told the
ASSU Senate that UNGRASPEL
would be staffed by a half-time dean, a
full-time director, and a half-time
administrative assistant.
Gibbs' liaison with SWOPSI and
SCIRE, Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson, claimed
that the reorganization plan would
jeopardize SWOPSI's identity.
SWOPSI and SCIRE are officially
answerable only to Gibbs,
Closson said. However, he continued,
they have kept an identity separate
from the dean's office because they've
had their own director, policy board
and building.
UNGRASPEL would lose that
distinctness from the dean's office,
Closson said. And student input would
not be as important, he added.
SCIRE director Alice Supton
claimed her program would also lose
its distinctness. SCIRE's
responsibilities would be distributed
between UNGRASPEL and a half-time

assistant to Gibbs.
Supton said centralizing her
program in the dean's office would
restrict the impartiality of SCIRE's
task forces on "politically delicate"
University issues.
Supton, Closson and SWOPSI
director Andy Parnes all agree the
programs could weather significant

budget cuts without being eliminated.
"We're flexible about making
administrative cuts," Parnes said,
pointing out that SWOPSI and SCIRE
have no instructional costs because
teachers are not paid.
Closson said he submitted a request
last May that SWOPSI receive a
fundraising priority. Gibbs denied the
request in October by withholding the

necessary authorization to send ii. to
the Provost's Office.
Gibbs explained his action b\
saying that he wanted to put SWOPSI
on secure funding, rather than
continue with "one shot" donations.
General Fund Monies
Gibbs claimed an advantage of his
plan is that it would support SWOPSI
(and later UNGRASPEL) with
University general funds, rather than
the reserves of his office.
He said it was bettter to run
reduced programs on reliable funds
than risk running out of money.
In regard to a part-time student
director for SWOPSI, Gibbs said it
would cost too much money for an
administrator to supervise (he student.
Gibbs also disputed Closson's claim
that the reorganization would diminish
student control of the programs.
UNGRASPEL will have an advisory
board with the same make-up of
faculty and students as the SWOPSI
board, he said.
Aside from the issue of control,
SWOPSI policy board members have
claimed that UNGRASPEL wouldn't
function effectively because its
director and board would be
overloaded with work.
'Room For Flexibility'
Student SWOPSI board member
Chris Baron claimed that
UNGRASPEL's a dm in i stration
wouldn't have time to investigate and
propose new courses. "That's what is
important about SWOPSI," she said.
Gibbs disagreed, claiming that
UNGRASPEL staff could perform the
job now done by SWOPSI and SCIRE
workers, but at a reduced level.
Gibbs criticized some SWOPSI and
SCIRE advocates for being overly
pessimistic. There is room for
flexibility in developing the details of
the reorganization, he said.
Barnes, Supton and student board
members have criticized Gibbs for not
communicating with them about his
initial decision to phase out the
programs.
However, Gibbs said he would
strongly consider the
recommendations of those involved
with SWOPSI and SCIRE in forming
final plans for absorbing courses into
departments and UNGRASPEL.

restrict the impartiality of SCIRE's
task forces on "politically delicate"
University issues.
Supton, Closson and SWOPSI
director Andy Parnes all agree the
programs could weather significant

budget cuts without being eliminated.
"We're flexible about making
administrative cuts," Parnes said,
pointing out that SWOPSI and SCIRE
have no instructional costs because
teachers are not paid.
Closson said he submitted a request
last May that SWOPSI receive a
fundraising priority. Gibbs denied the
request in October by withholding the

necessary authorization to send ii. to
the Provost's Office.
Gibbs explained his action b\
saying that he wanted to put SWOPSI
on secure funding, rather than
continue with "one shot" donations.
General Fund Monies
Gibbs claimed an advantage of his
plan is that it would support SWOPSI
(and later UNGRASPEL) with
University general funds, rather than
the reserves of his office.
He said it was bettter to run
reduced programs on reliable funds
than risk running out of money.
In regard to a part-time student
director for SWOPSI, Gibbs said it
would cost too much money for an
administrator to supervise (he student.
Gibbs also disputed Closson's claim
that the reorganization would diminish
student control of the programs.
UNGRASPEL will have an advisory
board with the same make-up of
faculty and students as the SWOPSI
board, he said.
Aside from the issue of control,
SWOPSI policy board members have
claimed that UNGRASPEL wouldn't
function effectively because its
director and board would be
overloaded with work.
'Room For Flexibility'
Student SWOPSI board member
Chris Baron claimed that
UNGRASPEL's a dm in i stration
wouldn't have time to investigate and
propose new courses. "That's what is
important about SWOPSI," she said.
Gibbs disagreed, claiming that
UNGRASPEL staff could perform the
job now done by SWOPSI and SCIRE
workers, but at a reduced level.
Gibbs criticized some SWOPSI and
SCIRE advocates for being overly
pessimistic. There is room for
flexibility in developing the details of
the reorganization, he said.
Barnes, Supton and student board
members have criticized Gibbs for not
communicating with them about his
initial decision to phase out the
programs.
However, Gibbs said he would
strongly consider the
recommendations of those involved
with SWOPSI and SCIRE in forming
final plans for absorbing courses into
departments and UNGRASPEL.
UNGRASPEL is an unlikely name
for an umbrella agency covering
experimental courses. But it is at the
core of the ongoing battle between
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs and the soon to be terminated
SWOPSI and SCIRE programs.
UNGRASPEL (the Undergraduate
Special Agency) has been proposed by
Gibbs to take the place of SCIRE,
which will be terminated in June, and
SWOPSI and the Undergraduate
Specials, scheduled to be eliminated
the following year.
Some of the functions of SWOPSI
and SCIRE will be absorbed by
traditional departments. However, in
cases where departments will not
accept the workshops, UNGRASPEL
will continue them.
The proposal is currently under
consideration by the Provost's Office.
Many working in SWOPSI and
SCIRE have interpreted the proposal
as an attempt to transfer control of
the programs away from students and
into the dean's office.
Character Will Not Change
However, Gibbs claims the
reorganization is due to necessary
budget cuts. He also said it will give
permanence to experimental education
programs without changing their
identity.
In particular, Gibbs claims that the
character of SWOPSI's
"action-oriented" workshops would
remain unchanged. These workshops
apply field research methods to find
solutions to problems such as prison
reform and public transportation.
There will be fewer workshops
under the new agency, Gibbs said.

Departments may be reluctant to work
with the "parafaculty" who often
serve as instructors. Other courses may
not be accepted because of their
controversial nature. Gibbs said
UNGRASPEL will only be able to
sponsor a limited number of courses
because of reductions in staff.
Gibbs' original proposal called for a
half-time director for UNGRASPEL.
Both SWOPSI and SCIRE each have a
full-time director and a half-time
assistant. The Undergraduate Specials
have a half-time director.

However, last night Gibbs told the
ASSU Senate that UNGRASPEL
would be staffed by a half-time dean, a

SCIRE, Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson, claimed
that the reorganization plan would
jeopardize SWOPSI's identity.
SWOPSI and SCIRE are officially
answerable only to Gibbs,
Closson said. However, he continued,
they have kept an identity separate
from the dean's office because they've
had their own director, policy board
and building.
UNGRASPEL would lose that
distinctness from the dean's office,
Closson said. And student input would
not be as important, he added.

The proposal is currently under
consideration by the Provost's Office.
Many working in SWOPSI and
SCIRE have interpreted the proposal
as an attempt to transfer control of
the programs away from students and
into the dean's office.
Character Will Not Change
However, Gibbs claims the
reorganization is due to necessary
budget cuts. He also said it will give
permanence to experimental education
programs without changing their
identity.
In particular, Gibbs claims that the
character of SWOPSI's
"action-oriented" workshops would
remain unchanged. These workshops
apply field research methods to find
solutions to problems such as prison
reform and public transportation.
There will be fewer workshops
under the new agency, Gibbs said.

Departments may be reluctant to work
with the "parafaculty" who often
serve as instructors. Other courses may
not be accepted because of their
controversial nature. Gibbs said
UNGRASPEL will only be able to
sponsor a limited number of courses
because of reductions in staff.
Gibbs' original proposal called for a
half-time director for UNGRASPEL.
Both SWOPSI and SCIRE each have a
full-time director and a half-time
assistant. The Undergraduate Specials
have a half-time director.
Increase In Staff
However, last night Gibbs told the
ASSU Senate that UNGRASPEL
would be staffed by a half-time dean, a
full-time director, and a half-time
administrative assistant.
Gibbs' liaison with SWOPSI and
SCIRE, Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson, claimed
that the reorganization plan would
jeopardize SWOPSI's identity.
SWOPSI and SCIRE are officially
answerable only to Gibbs,
Closson said. However, he continued,
they have kept an identity separate
from the dean's office because they've
had their own director, policy board
and building.
UNGRASPEL would lose that
distinctness from the dean's office,
Closson said. And student input would
not be as important, he added.
SCIRE director Alice Supton
claimed her program would also lose
its distinctness. SCIRE's
responsibilities would be distributed
between UNGRASPEL and a half-time

assistant to Gibbs.
Supton said centralizing her
program in the dean's office would
restrict the impartiality of SCIRE's
task forces on "politically delicate"
University issues.
Supton, Closson and SWOPSI
director Andy Parnes all agree the
programs could weather significant

budget cuts without being eliminated.
"We're flexible about making
administrative cuts," Parnes said,
pointing out that SWOPSI and SCIRE
have no instructional costs because
teachers are not paid.
Closson said he submitted a request
last May that SWOPSI receive a
fundraising priority. Gibbs denied the
request in October by withholding the

necessary authorization to send ii. to
the Provost's Office.
Gibbs explained his action b\
saying that he wanted to put SWOPSI
on secure funding, rather than
continue with "one shot" donations.
General Fund Monies
Gibbs claimed an advantage of his
plan is that it would support SWOPSI
(and later UNGRASPEL) with
University general funds, rather than
the reserves of his office.
He said it was bettter to run
reduced programs on reliable funds
than risk running out of money.
In regard to a part-time student
director for SWOPSI, Gibbs said it
would cost too much money for an
administrator to supervise (he student.
Gibbs also disputed Closson's claim
that the reorganization would diminish
student control of the programs.
UNGRASPEL will have an advisory
board with the same make-up of
faculty and students as the SWOPSI
board, he said.
Aside from the issue of control,
SWOPSI policy board members have
claimed that UNGRASPEL wouldn't
function effectively because its
director and board would be
overloaded with work.
'Room For Flexibility'
Student SWOPSI board member
Chris Baron claimed that
UNGRASPEL's a dm in i stration
wouldn't have time to investigate and
propose new courses. "That's what is
important about SWOPSI," she said.
Gibbs disagreed, claiming that
UNGRASPEL staff could perform the
job now done by SWOPSI and SCIRE
workers, but at a reduced level.
Gibbs criticized some SWOPSI and
SCIRE advocates for being overly
pessimistic. There is room for
flexibility in developing the details of
the reorganization, he said.
Barnes, Supton and student board
members have criticized Gibbs for not
communicating with them about his
initial decision to phase out the
programs.
However, Gibbs said he would
strongly consider the
recommendations of those involved
with SWOPSI and SCIRE in forming
final plans for absorbing courses into
departments and UNGRASPEL.
UNGRASPEL is an unlikely name
for an umbrella agency covering
experimental courses. But it is at the
core of the ongoing battle between
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs and the soon to be terminated
SWOPSI and SCIRE programs.
UNGRASPEL (the Undergraduate
Special Agency) has been proposed by
Gibbs to take the place of SCIRE,
which will be terminated in June, and
SWOPSI and the Undergraduate
Specials, scheduled to be eliminated
the following year.
Some of the functions of SWOPSI
and SCIRE will be absorbed by
traditional departments. However, in
cases where departments will not
accept the workshops, UNGRASPEL
will continue them.
The proposal is currently under
consideration by the Provost's Office.
