# Even 'The Daily' Can Err
## 
### 
I would like to present a little challange to the
ethics of the Daily, which appears to be a fine
newspaper. Actually, it is a rather small thing but
one which troubles me since I have a sincerely high
regard for the students of Stanford. For reasons
that go back to a childhood visit to that school and
an unusual number of Stanford graduates I have
learned to admire, Stanford has always been my
favorite university, something of an adopted school
which I wish I had attended and sometimes
daydream that somehow in some kind of different
past it actually happened.
Writers tend to be romanticists about such
things,or perhaps such daydreams happen to more
people than is generally realized and accounts for
the strange partisan loyalties one sees from total
strangers at sporting events and such.
Anyway, in the Daily's Jan. 29 generally
complimentary article on my lecture appearance at
Stanford on Jan. 28, there was an error in
describing my statements to the audience at the
moment of the bomb scare. In my attempt at
humor to prevent any panic during the evacuation
of the auditorium, I was quoted as saying that I
would use the evacuation interval to rest my
injured leg while you "bums" stand out in the cold.

Hoping to God that even in the excitement I
would never refer to a student group I admire as
"bums," I have just reviewed the tape record of
that talk and was relieved to find the words to be
quite clearly "while you folks stand out in the
cold." I can make that tape section available on
request if the University radio station has not
retained a copy from which you can vprify the
statement.
Again, admittedly, a small thing in which you
have to read in my affection for the Stanford
student body in order to understand why I would
even bother to send this note. I find it hard to fault
your excellent reporter for mis-hearing a word in
the confusion of a bomb scare and an audience
evacuation. But I would appreciate your making it
clear to your readers that I did not refer to this
admirable group of Stanfordites as "bums." Had
my speech been received with boos and catcalls,
well, who knows what words the fragile self
confidence of an introspective writer-type trapped
on a lecture platform might have produced?
Particularly if it had occurred somewhere like
U.S.C. But at Stanford? I think riot even then.

Gene Roddenberry

Hoping to God that even in the excitement I
would never refer to a student group I admire as
"bums," I have just reviewed the tape record of
that talk and was relieved to find the words to be
quite clearly "while you folks stand out in the
cold." I can make that tape section available on
request if the University radio station has not
retained a copy from which you can vprify the
statement.
Again, admittedly, a small thing in which you
have to read in my affection for the Stanford
student body in order to understand why I would
even bother to send this note. I find it hard to fault
your excellent reporter for mis-hearing a word in
the confusion of a bomb scare and an audience
evacuation. But I would appreciate your making it
clear to your readers that I did not refer to this
admirable group of Stanfordites as "bums." Had
my speech been received with boos and catcalls,
well, who knows what words the fragile self
confidence of an introspective writer-type trapped
on a lecture platform might have produced?
Particularly if it had occurred somewhere like
U.S.C. But at Stanford? I think riot even then.
