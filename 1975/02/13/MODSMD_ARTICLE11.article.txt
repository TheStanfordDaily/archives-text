# Frats: For Whom The Bell Tolls?
## 
### Tim Ferguson 
I suppose the reaction of many to the
housing recommendations of the Committee
on Services to Students (COSS) will be along
this line: "Fraternities ought to thank their
lucky stars. This report saved their ass."
However, a close reading of the COSS
document, together with reported statements
of Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons and
COSS chairperson Suzi Harmatz, should
convince Stanford fraternities that their reply
ought be "thanks, but no thanks."
For the committee, while justifying the
practice of subjective selectivity in the
present 12 fraternities on the flimsy grounds
of it being a "secondary issue," of "historical
significance" and a "perceived value to
fraternities," has repudiated this very
foundation of Greek existence.
"Houses should not choose the students;
students should choose their houses," the
report reads. Goals of fraternal life "can also
be achieved by a house establishing a list of
objective criteria."
COSS' inescapable conclusion is thus: "We
do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future
living groups. We do not feel it is a living
aspect the University should seek to foster"
(emphasis added).
Freedom Of Access
Lyons stated last Wednesday, "Students
should not be denied access to any University
facility except for objective or educational
reasons." He later elaborated that by
"University facility" he meant any structure
located on University land.
"Subjective selectivity is not crucial to a
fraternity," Lyons continued.
Harmatz said last Thursday the COSS
subcommittee which drew up the proposals
contained in the full committee's report had
decided it could not support a policy which
allows "a person to say I don't like you and I
don't have to tell you why I don't like you.
Period."
Despite that rather gross

oversimplification of the rushing/bidding
process, fraternities should be able to see
clearly the writing on the wall. COSS and the
Dean of Student Affairs' Office, while
allowing continuation of the status quo for
the present 12 fraternities, are actually
denying the houses' rights to existence.
Existing Greek houses have been
"saved" but with a catch. Fraternities are to
be trapped, as Bonny Rodden wrote in the
Feb. 7 Daily, "in a doorless room with
moving walls." Any of the present 12 houses
which "consistently" (undefined) fail to
meet proposed overcrowding quotas will be
assimilated into the monolithic housing draw.
Forever.

And no new fraternities, or sororities, will
be allowed to build their own houses on
campus, though some have already indicated
interest in doing so. The results: a denial of
possible relief from the on-campus housing
shortage, and a continuation of the
University's present discrimination against
women.
In short, it's the COSS squeeze play on
fraternities, executed because powerful
figures in the University believe Stanford
students lack the social maturity to tolerate
subjective selectivity on the part of those
who want it (and don't presently have it) and
are willing to pay for it (by building new
houses).
And, lest anyone complain about the

whole deal, the subcommittee has issued this
pretentious reminder: "If contested on its
recommendation to retain subjective
selectivity for [only the present 12]
fraternities, [the subcommittee] would vote
to remove this feature entirely from the
housing system rather than extend it to any
living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities."
Well, the subcommittee can consider itself
contested. I don't believe Stanford
fraternities should, or can, exist soundly atop
a contradiction.
Stanford fraternities ought to contest the
bases for COSS' recommendations on two
grounds:
—The subcommittee, it admits, "did not
consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni."
(Remember, the ones who built the houses?)
—Subjective selectivity is a virtue, not a
skeleton in the fraternities' closets. It is the
sine qua non of fraternal life. Character,
sociability and capability for brotherhood
cannot be demonstrated solely by "writing
an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the'outside of a house," as
COSS suggests they can.
When this entire debate began five months
ago, many warned of a death knell for
fraternities. Today, after the issue has passed
its first and most exhaustive stage of
deliberation, the knell tolls as ominously as
ever.
But fraternities are not, as Rodden
implied in her article, finished. Any decision
on the matter by President Richard Lyman is
subject to review by the Board of Trustees.
Perhaps these men and women will be made
aware of the severe financial repercussions to
the University which come with refusing to
recognize past commitments and by acting in
the misconceived interests of students.

houses).
And, lest anyone complain about the

whole deal, the subcommittee has issued this
pretentious reminder: "If contested on its
recommendation to retain subjective
selectivity for [only the present 12]
fraternities, [the subcommittee] would vote
to remove this feature entirely from the
housing system rather than extend it to any
living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities."
Well, the subcommittee can consider itself
contested. I don't believe Stanford
fraternities should, or can, exist soundly atop
a contradiction.
Stanford fraternities ought to contest the
bases for COSS' recommendations on two
grounds:
—The subcommittee, it admits, "did not
consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni."
(Remember, the ones who built the houses?)
—Subjective selectivity is a virtue, not a
skeleton in the fraternities' closets. It is the
sine qua non of fraternal life. Character,
sociability and capability for brotherhood
cannot be demonstrated solely by "writing
an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the'outside of a house," as
COSS suggests they can.
When this entire debate began five months
ago, many warned of a death knell for
fraternities. Today, after the issue has passed
its first and most exhaustive stage of
deliberation, the knell tolls as ominously as
ever.
But fraternities are not, as Rodden
implied in her article, finished. Any decision
on the matter by President Richard Lyman is
subject to review by the Board of Trustees.
Perhaps these men and women will be made
aware of the severe financial repercussions to
the University which come with refusing to
recognize past commitments and by acting in
the misconceived interests of students.

Editorial Board. His column appears every
other Thursday on this page.)

I suppose the reaction of many to the
housing recommendations of the Committee
on Services to Students (COSS) will be along
this line: "Fraternities ought to thank their
lucky stars. This report saved their ass."
However, a close reading of the COSS
document, together with reported statements
of Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons and
COSS chairperson Suzi Harmatz, should
convince Stanford fraternities that their reply
ought be "thanks, but no thanks."
For the committee, while justifying the
practice of subjective selectivity in the
present 12 fraternities on the flimsy grounds
of it being a "secondary issue," of "historical
significance" and a "perceived value to
fraternities," has repudiated this very
foundation of Greek existence.
"Houses should not choose the students;
students should choose their houses," the
report reads. Goals of fraternal life "can also
be achieved by a house establishing a list of
objective criteria."
COSS' inescapable conclusion is thus: "We
do not recommend extension of subjective
selectivity to any other present or future
living groups. We do not feel it is a living
aspect the University should seek to foster"
(emphasis added).
Freedom Of Access
Lyons stated last Wednesday, "Students
should not be denied access to any University
facility except for objective or educational
reasons." He later elaborated that by
"University facility" he meant any structure
located on University land.
"Subjective selectivity is not crucial to a
fraternity," Lyons continued.
Harmatz said last Thursday the COSS
subcommittee which drew up the proposals
contained in the full committee's report had
decided it could not support a policy which
allows "a person to say I don't like you and I
don't have to tell you why I don't like you.
Period."
Despite that rather gross

oversimplification of the rushing/bidding
process, fraternities should be able to see
clearly the writing on the wall. COSS and the
Dean of Student Affairs' Office, while
allowing continuation of the status quo for
the present 12 fraternities, are actually
denying the houses' rights to existence.
Existing Greek houses have been
"saved" but with a catch. Fraternities are to
be trapped, as Bonny Rodden wrote in the
Feb. 7 Daily, "in a doorless room with
moving walls." Any of the present 12 houses
which "consistently" (undefined) fail to
meet proposed overcrowding quotas will be
assimilated into the monolithic housing draw.
Forever.

And no new fraternities, or sororities, will
be allowed to build their own houses on
campus, though some have already indicated
interest in doing so. The results: a denial of
possible relief from the on-campus housing
shortage, and a continuation of the
University's present discrimination against
women.
In short, it's the COSS squeeze play on
fraternities, executed because powerful
figures in the University believe Stanford
students lack the social maturity to tolerate
subjective selectivity on the part of those
who want it (and don't presently have it) and
are willing to pay for it (by building new
houses).

should not be denied access to any University
facility except for objective or educational
reasons." He later elaborated that by
"University facility" he meant any structure
located on University land.
"Subjective selectivity is not crucial to a
fraternity," Lyons continued.
Harmatz said last Thursday the COSS
subcommittee which drew up the proposals
contained in the full committee's report had
decided it could not support a policy which
allows "a person to say I don't like you and I
don't have to tell you why I don't like you.
Period."
Despite that rather gross

oversimplification of the rushing/bidding
process, fraternities should be able to see
clearly the writing on the wall. COSS and the
Dean of Student Affairs' Office, while
allowing continuation of the status quo for
the present 12 fraternities, are actually
denying the houses' rights to existence.
Existing Greek houses have been
"saved" but with a catch. Fraternities are to
be trapped, as Bonny Rodden wrote in the
Feb. 7 Daily, "in a doorless room with
moving walls." Any of the present 12 houses
which "consistently" (undefined) fail to
meet proposed overcrowding quotas will be
assimilated into the monolithic housing draw.
Forever.

And no new fraternities, or sororities, will
be allowed to build their own houses on
campus, though some have already indicated
interest in doing so. The results: a denial of
possible relief from the on-campus housing
shortage, and a continuation of the
University's present discrimination against
women.
In short, it's the COSS squeeze play on
fraternities, executed because powerful
figures in the University believe Stanford
students lack the social maturity to tolerate
subjective selectivity on the part of those
who want it (and don't presently have it) and
are willing to pay for it (by building new
houses).
And, lest anyone complain about the

whole deal, the subcommittee has issued this
pretentious reminder: "If contested on its
recommendation to retain subjective
selectivity for [only the present 12]
fraternities, [the subcommittee] would vote
to remove this feature entirely from the
housing system rather than extend it to any
living groups other than the presently
established male fraternities."
Well, the subcommittee can consider itself
contested. I don't believe Stanford
fraternities should, or can, exist soundly atop
a contradiction.
Stanford fraternities ought to contest the
bases for COSS' recommendations on two
grounds:
—The subcommittee, it admits, "did not
consider any of the ethical or legal
obligations of the University to its alumni."
(Remember, the ones who built the houses?)
—Subjective selectivity is a virtue, not a
skeleton in the fraternities' closets. It is the
sine qua non of fraternal life. Character,
sociability and capability for brotherhood
cannot be demonstrated solely by "writing
an essay, visiting a house several times, or
even painting the'outside of a house," as
COSS suggests they can.
When this entire debate began five months
ago, many warned of a death knell for
fraternities. Today, after the issue has passed
its first and most exhaustive stage of
deliberation, the knell tolls as ominously as
ever.
But fraternities are not, as Rodden
implied in her article, finished. Any decision
on the matter by President Richard Lyman is
subject to review by the Board of Trustees.
Perhaps these men and women will be made
aware of the severe financial repercussions to
the University which come with refusing to
recognize past commitments and by acting in
the misconceived interests of students.
