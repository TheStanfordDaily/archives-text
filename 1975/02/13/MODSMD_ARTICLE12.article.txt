Women's Doctorates
In the Jan. 30 Daily,a story
reporting on a meeting of the
Education Committee of the
Santa Clara County Commission
on the Status of Women included
the following statement: "Only
four of 80 students in the
educational administration
program are women .. . and only
one woman has received a
doctorate in higher educatiot
since 1947."
Both sets of statistics are in
error, but I think it is important
to set the record straight with
regard to the number of women
who have received degrees in
higher education. Under W. H.
Cowley, the first David Jacks
Professor of Higher Education at
Stanford and who came to
Stanford in 1945, the following
women received doctorates:
Patricia Grinager, Emily Girault,
Lois Wilson May field, Mary
Harmes, Mary Margaret Williams,
Isabel Chavil, Louise Schmidt,
Marian Schrum, Alice Dement,
Frieda Anne Grieder, and Joat:
Seavey.
There has certainly been plenty
of discrimination against women
in education as in other social
institutions; it serves no purpose,
however, for misstatements of
fact to be propounded in the
Daily.

A "night-time minibus" would
not only be costly — at a time
when the University must trim
costs — but unnecessary. If the
frail and frightened would but
invest in a bicycle and ride it
instead of walking, they would
much reduce their chances of
attack. And if they cannot afford
a bike or are unable or unwillin r
to ride one, then they should walk,
with a group of friends. The cost
of this solution is borne only by
those who need and use the
service.
Bus-taxis run for the benefit of
those poor frightened souls who
can neither ride a bike nor walk
with a group of friends would
soon be full. Why walk or ride a
bike when point-to-point bus
service is available?
After a short while we would
have a fleet of buses shuttling
students all over campus. But
what of environmental concerns?
And even if a limited service,
where is the money to come
from? Increased tuition?
The implication that someone
owes the meek such a luxury is
disgusting. Neither the remainder
of the students nor the University
itself should foot the bill for a
glorified and expensive
experiment in post-adolescen/
hand-holding.

Let The Users Pay
A "night-time minibus" would
not only be costly — at a time
when the University must trim
costs — but unnecessary. If the
frail and frightened would but
invest in a bicycle and ride it
instead of walking, they would
much reduce their chances of
attack. And if they cannot afford
a bike or are unable or unwillin r
to ride one, then they should walk,
with a group of friends. The cost
of this solution is borne only by
those who need and use the
service.
Bus-taxis run for the benefit of
those poor frightened souls who
can neither ride a bike nor walk
with a group of friends would
soon be full. Why walk or ride a
bike when point-to-point bus
service is available?
After a short while we would
have a fleet of buses shuttling
students all over campus. But
what of environmental concerns?
And even if a limited service,
where is the money to come
from? Increased tuition?
The implication that someone
owes the meek such a luxury is
disgusting. Neither the remainder
of the students nor the University
itself should foot the bill for a
glorified and expensive
experiment in post-adolescen/
hand-holding.

Women's Doctorates
In the Jan. 30 Daily,a story
reporting on a meeting of the
Education Committee of the
Santa Clara County Commission
on the Status of Women included
the following statement: "Only
four of 80 students in the
educational administration
program are women .. . and only
one woman has received a
doctorate in higher educatiot
since 1947."
Both sets of statistics are in
error, but I think it is important
to set the record straight with
regard to the number of women
who have received degrees in
higher education. Under W. H.
Cowley, the first David Jacks
Professor of Higher Education at
Stanford and who came to
Stanford in 1945, the following
women received doctorates:
Patricia Grinager, Emily Girault,
Lois Wilson May field, Mary
Harmes, Mary Margaret Williams,
Isabel Chavil, Louise Schmidt,
Marian Schrum, Alice Dement,
Frieda Anne Grieder, and Joat:
Seavey.
There has certainly been plenty
of discrimination against women
in education as in other social
institutions; it serves no purpose,
however, for misstatements of
fact to be propounded in the
Daily.
