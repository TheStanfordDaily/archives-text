# Gibbs' Memo On Financial Aid For Minorities
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following
memo was sent by James Gibbs,
dean of undergraduate studies, to
Robert P. Huff, director of
financial aids, on Nov. 13, 1974.
It was uncovered by Live Oak
early this month and examined
together with reactions from
minority students in a Feb. 10
Daily article.)
Dear Bob:
Thanks very much for your
memorandum of Nov. 12 and the
attached paper on the packaging
of financial aid for minority
students. I'd like to make some
comments on your proposal.
I agree that the best packaging

policy is your number three,
"some se'f-help expectation for
economically disadvantaged
students without regard to race
but less than the standard." As
you note in your paper, this bases
financial aid on a student's
monetary needs rather than his or
her ethnicity.
This moves us further in what I
say is the proper direction,
treating a student first as a
student not primarily as a member
of a given ethnic group. As I am
sure you are aware, our prior
packaging policy conveyed a
subtle contrary message that, in
initial financial aid, minority

students were viewed basically in
ethnic terms. As your report
indicates, individual financial
circumstances were not taken into
account to the same extent that
they were for white students.
The proposed shift in policy
may have some advantages which
have not been stated explicitly.
First, the fact that our first year
package for minority students was
more generous than that of
comparable institutions,
ironically, may have led some
admittees to decline to come to
Stanford. For a middle class
student who wants to get away
from being treated automatically
as an economically deprived,
educationally disadvantaged
minority member, that prior,
well-intentioned packaging may
have been a red flag.
It could be read as saying "if
you go to Stanford, you will not
be treated as an individual, but in
terms of an a priori category."
Admittees who had such
concerns, and read our financial
aid signal as reflecting the
likelihood of benevolently
stereotyped, but constraining,
treatment here, probably opted to
go elsewhere.
Second, some black students
recently have confirmed what I
have suspected for some time.
They chose to come to Stanford
rather than other institutions to
which they had been admitted,
solely because of the more
favorable financial aid packaging.
Thus, the prior packaging plan
achieved the goal that was set for
it. These same students have been
among the most vocal and
persistent critics of Stanford as an
alien, non-relevant educational
institution. Some of them would
have preferred going to an all
black institution or to a
predominantly white institution

in a large city with a significant
black population.
I am not saying that we should
seek to find and admit only
minority students who find
Stanford congenial in every way.
But I do think there are very real
costs to having such a significant
number of students who are
opposed to or lacking in
understanding of the basic tenets
of our educational philosophy.
Many of these students spend
too much time trying to "turn the
institution around" rather than
availing themselves of much that
it has to offer. I suspect, too, that
many of them have more severe
adjustment problems than
minority students who choose
Stanford 'for more
educationally-related reasons than
the patterning of financial aid
available.
The proposed financial aid
packaging is likely to bring us a
different (and I think better) mix
of minority students. It will bring
more minority students who have
chosen Stanford because of its
ethos rather than in spite of it.
The new packaging, I suspect will
bring students who will gain more
from Stanford by drawing more
broadly from what we have to
offer.
Also, they will be less likely to
nourish their peers' feelings of
discontentment or malaise. I think
we are likely to draw an equal
number of minority students as
we do now, but students who are
more attuned to the intellectual
goals that we espouse and to the
elitist nature of the institution.
There is a danger that the shift
to a new policy will lead to an
initial drop in acceptances by
minority students admitted. It
will be helpful if, with the move
to the new financial aids policy,
there could be some efforts to try

to increase the yield from
minority admittees.
Particular attention should be
paid to those who, in the past few
years, have been most likely to
decline Stanford in favor of other
elite institutions. If the quality of
the applicant pool permits, we
might consider admitting more
minority students to continue to
produce the present yield.
Finally, I think we should
make a decision at this point not
to evaluate the effects of the new

policy too soon. Inevitably, the
minority grapevine incorrectly will
identify the shift to the new
policy as being a lessening of
commitment to minority students
and minority concerns. This may
affect our yield for a short period
of time, but I'm sure this will be
temporary. Our total institutional
stance is such that it soon will be
apparent that overall
commitment has not lessened.
Sincerely,
James L. Gibbs
