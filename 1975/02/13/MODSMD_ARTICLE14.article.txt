## Bug Me Too Fat From Jumbo Jacks 
### Patty Fels 
I am a calorie-conscious student with,
unfortunately, a skinny boyfriend. Late at
night, we often visit Jack in the Box and,
despite all my resolve, I always break down
and eat something. I would like to know
what is the least fattening item at J in the
B-P.M.
Nothing at Jack's is exactly a Weight
Watchers special, but some things are
better than others. For example, an order
of french fries is only 240 calories, while
onion rings are over 600. A plain
hamburger is 300; a Bonus Jack, 522.
According to our admittedly
imperfect calculations, a 286-calorie taco is
the least fattening thing while a 686-calorie
Jumbo Jack is the most. Between these
two extremes, (in order from least to most)
are a hamburger, a Moby Jack (340), an
apple turnover (350), a cheeseburger (400),
a Jack Steak (481), a Breakfast Jack (500),
and a Bonus Jack.
Frankly, you would be well-advised to
consider a Coke (150 calories) or, better
yet, black coffee.

Incidentally, you're not the only college
student who can't resist the fattening
products of fast food services. Adrian
Dantley, Notre Dame basketball star, went
on a strict diet last summer which
consisted primarily of cutting out Big
Macs.

In light of the recent furors over the
non-tenuring of Juan Flores and Jerry
Irish, I would like to know how many and
which faculty members have been given
tenure in the last year or two—C.G.
Last year (1973-74), 11 faculty
members were given tenure. Daryl Bern
(psychology) was promoted from an
associate to a full professor and given
tenure at the same time. Theodore Hansch
(physics) and Richard Randell (art) were
reappointed as associate professors and
given tenure. Eight more faculty were
promoted from assistant to associate
professors and given tenure. They are:
Robert Beyer (applied physics), Marcus
Feldman (biology), Hans Andersen

(chemistry), John Pencavel (economics),
William Chace (English), Nancy Packer
(English), Fred Bowser (history), and
Lee Yearley (religious studies).
Six members of the faculty were denied
tenure and not promoted from assistant to
associate professors in 1973-74.
So far this year seven professors have
been granted tenure and three have been
denied tenure. Associate Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Lewis Spitz
refused to reveal the names since the
decisions are not final yet.

Why did a full hour have to pass after the
film projector broke before an ASSU
spokesman announced to the put-upon
audience the cancelbtion of "Ryan's
Daughter" on Sunday night? And why was
this beautifully photographed movie
projected so poorly (until the projector
broke)? Each side of the screen was
alternately and annoy ingly out of focus. If
I have my ticket, when can I obtain my
refund for Sunday night?—M.H.

Sunday Flicks manager Rocky Barber
offers humble apologies to the put-upon
audience. Here's what happened, according
to him:
First, the projectionist switched reels
and discovered there was no power.
Thinking that the problem was with the
camera, he checked the whole camera, then
checked the cables. Finding nothing wrong,
he realized that it must be the transformer
and called in a University electrician who
worked on the transformer for 15 minutes.
All this took about 45 minutes. Then, a
policy for ticket refunds had to be
established by ASSU people — adding up
to a 50-minute wait.
The 35 millimeter equipment is
"essentially shot," Barber said, meaning that
no more 35 mm films can be shown.
However, he was able to obtain a 16 mm
version of "Bananas," scheduled to be
shown th's Sunday.
Refunds can be picked up at the ASSU
office now from 8:30 to 5:00. Or the
tickets can be used for "Bananas."

Frankly, you would be well-advised to
consider a Coke (150 calories) or, better
yet, black coffee.

Incidentally, you're not the only college
student who can't resist the fattening
products of fast food services. Adrian
Dantley, Notre Dame basketball star, went
on a strict diet last summer which
consisted primarily of cutting out Big

In light of the recent furors over the
non-tenuring of Juan Flores and Jerry
Irish, I would like to know how many and
which faculty members have been given
tenure in the last year or two—C.G.
Last year (1973-74), 11 faculty
members were given tenure. Daryl Bern
(psychology) was promoted from an
associate to a full professor and given
tenure at the same time. Theodore Hansch
(physics) and Richard Randell (art) were
reappointed as associate professors and
given tenure. Eight more faculty were
promoted from assistant to associate
professors and given tenure. They are:
Robert Beyer (applied physics), Marcus
Feldman (biology), Hans Andersen

(chemistry), John Pencavel (economics),
William Chace (English), Nancy Packer
(English), Fred Bowser (history), and
Lee Yearley (religious studies).
Six members of the faculty were denied
tenure and not promoted from assistant to
associate professors in 1973-74.
So far this year seven professors have
been granted tenure and three have been
denied tenure. Associate Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Lewis Spitz
refused to reveal the names since the
decisions are not final yet.

Why did a full hour have to pass after the
film projector broke before an ASSU
spokesman announced to the put-upon
audience the cancelbtion of "Ryan's
Daughter" on Sunday night? And why was
this beautifully photographed movie
projected so poorly (until the projector
broke)? Each side of the screen was
alternately and annoy ingly out of focus. If
I have my ticket, when can I obtain my
refund for Sunday night?—M.H.

Sunday Flicks manager Rocky Barber
offers humble apologies to the put-upon
audience. Here's what happened, according
to him:
First, the projectionist switched reels
and discovered there was no power.
Thinking that the problem was with the
camera, he checked the whole camera, then
checked the cables. Finding nothing wrong,
he realized that it must be the transformer
and called in a University electrician who
worked on the transformer for 15 minutes.
All this took about 45 minutes. Then, a
policy for ticket refunds had to be
established by ASSU people — adding up
to a 50-minute wait.
The 35 millimeter equipment is
"essentially shot," Barber said, meaning that
no more 35 mm films can be shown.
However, he was able to obtain a 16 mm
version of "Bananas," scheduled to be
shown th's Sunday.
Refunds can be picked up at the ASSU
office now from 8:30 to 5:00. Or the
tickets can be used for "Bananas."

HEAVY STEAK? —When it's dark and getting late, and you think
food would taste great — remember your weight. Jack in the Box and
other fast-service restaurants may have the food when you want it;
but they also have the calories, as illustrated in today's Hug Me.
I am a calorie-conscious student with,
unfortunately, a skinny boyfriend. Late at
night, we often visit Jack in the Box and,
despite all my resolve, I always break down
and eat something. I would like to know
what is the least fattening item at J in the
B-P.M.
Nothing at Jack's is exactly a Weight
Watchers special, but some things are
better than others. For example, an order
of french fries is only 240 calories, while
onion rings are over 600. A plain
hamburger is 300; a Bonus Jack, 522.
According to our admittedly
imperfect calculations, a 286-calorie taco is
the least fattening thing while a 686-calorie
Jumbo Jack is the most. Between these
two extremes, (in order from least to most)
are a hamburger, a Moby Jack (340), an
apple turnover (350), a cheeseburger (400),
a Jack Steak (481), a Breakfast Jack (500),
and a Bonus Jack.
