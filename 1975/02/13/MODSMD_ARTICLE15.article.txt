# Stalls Prompt Bathroom Debate
## 
### RICHARD CHONG 
Co-educational bathrooms
created an uproar last year and
once again bathrooms are in the
news. Only this year the issue is
the installation of metal stalls in
Wilbur Hall.
Many years ago women began
to ask for privacy in dormitory
restrooms, according to Marie
Haley, administrative assistant in
Wilbur Hall.
Finally, this year something
was done to appease the women.
Prior to Christmas break, metal
doors were installed on all of the
women's toilets in Trancos. In
addition, one door was installed
on every floor in Wilbur as an
experiment.
Haley commented that her
"biggest beef is that the students
were not consulted" whether or
not they wanted the doors.
Haley said no one complained
to her about the doors until after
vacation. By then, the
maintenance staff had installed
the doors in all of ,the Wilbur
bathrooms. And that's when she
began to hear "rumblings from
the men."
One student commented that

no one over 5' 6" could use the
stalls. He said he could barely fit
in the room and couldn't read the
newspaper once he was inside.
However, he said he didn't
mind too much because "I always
use the executive suite," referring
to the larger stall in the corner of
the bathroom.
Some male residents, such as
those in Arroyo, showed their
opposition to doors by
disengaging one of them.
Haley told the men that Maggie
Montgomery, Wilbur custodial
supervisor, would place the door
in storage and asked them to take
down any more doors.
However, the door did not get
stored. Instead, Student Housing

Manager Alan Cummings ordered
his staff to rehang the door. He
said some or all of the doors could
be removed if enough students
showed concern, but members of
the maintenance staff would have
to be the ones to actually take the
doors down.
He said he was afraid that parts
of the doors could become lost or
damaged if students attended to
the doors themselves.
Cummings said, "Some
students have requested that the
doors be taken off and we have
done that. We'll put them up at
the end of the year for the
summer. If people prefer not to
have the privacy then, we'll just
leave them off."

experiment.
Haley commented that her
"biggest beef is that the students
were not consulted" whether or
not they wanted the doors.
Haley said no one complained
to her about the doors until after
vacation. By then, the
maintenance staff had installed
the doors in all of ,the Wilbur
bathrooms. And that's when she
began to hear "rumblings from
the men."
One student commented that

no one over 5' 6" could use the
stalls. He said he could barely fit
in the room and couldn't read the
newspaper once he was inside.
However, he said he didn't
mind too much because "I always
use the executive suite," referring
to the larger stall in the corner of
the bathroom.
Some male residents, such as
those in Arroyo, showed their
opposition to doors by
disengaging one of them.
Haley told the men that Maggie
Montgomery, Wilbur custodial
supervisor, would place the door
in storage and asked them to take
down any more doors.
However, the door did not get
stored. Instead, Student Housing

Manager Alan Cummings ordered
his staff to rehang the door. He
said some or all of the doors could
be removed if enough students
showed concern, but members of
the maintenance staff would have
to be the ones to actually take the
doors down.
He said he was afraid that parts
of the doors could become lost or
damaged if students attended to
the doors themselves.
Cummings said, "Some
students have requested that the
doors be taken off and we have
done that. We'll put them up at
the end of the year for the
summer. If people prefer not to
have the privacy then, we'll just
leave them off."

TOlLETlSSUE—lnstallation of these metal stalls in Wilbur Hall bathrooms over Christmas break divided
more than just toilets. Apparently requests for privacy by women prompted the switch from plastic
curtains to metal doors in front of the stalls. However, some men have complained that now there's no
room to read the newspaper in the cubicles.
Co-educational bathrooms
created an uproar last year and
once again bathrooms are in the
news. Only this year the issue is
the installation of metal stalls in
Wilbur Hall.
Many years ago women began
to ask for privacy in dormitory
restrooms, according to Marie
Haley, administrative assistant in
Wilbur Hall.
Finally, this year something
was done to appease the women.
Prior to Christmas break, metal
doors were installed on all of the
women's toilets in Trancos. In
addition, one door was installed
on every floor in Wilbur as an
experiment.
Haley commented that her
"biggest beef is that the students
were not consulted" whether or
