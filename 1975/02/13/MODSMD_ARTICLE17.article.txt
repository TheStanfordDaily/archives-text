# Plan To Go Off Welfare Eventually
## Recipients Want Temporary Aid 
### KAREN CAESAR 
Stanford economists have
discovered that most families
receiving welfare do not do so
with the intention of receiving it
indefinitely.
"There is an enormous
turnover in the welfare
population," says Asst.
Economics Prof. Michael J.
Boskin, who co-authored a study
of welfare recipients along with
Economics Prof. Takeshi
Amemiya and former graduate
student Frank Nold.
"New families come on welfare
and go off continuously. Most
families stay on welfare for
periods of far shorter duration
than is commonly supposed,"
Boskin added.
The authors studied 440
California families on welfare
from 1965-1970. Of the group,
just 17 percent stayed on the rolls
during the entire five-year survey.
Another 27 percent went on, off
and on again one or more times.
The remaining 56 percent went
off welfare when they found jobs
and did not return.
Welfare recipients leave the
rolls in relation to the amount of
wages offered by employers,
Boskin found.
Job Permanence
A second important factor is
job permanence. Welfare
recipients offered jobs that are
likely to leave them unemployed
for more than two weeks of the
year generally prefer not to take
them.
Other factors include the
amount of non-wage income the
welfare recipient gets, his state of
health, and whether there are
pre-school children in the family.
In addition, non-whites on the
average proved more likely to stay
on welfare.
"Non-whites in the sample,
facing a wage less than the
minimum wage, an expected
duration of unemployment
greater than two weeks, with a
non-wage income less than the
mean, have the lowest estimated

probability of leaving welfare and
the highest estimated probability
of returning to it," said Boskin.
He added that the overall
probability of being on welfare
for non-whites is better than 80
percent.
Whites Working
"At the other extreme, whites
in the sample with wages above
the minimum, non-wage income
above the mean and expected
unemployment below two weeks
have the highest estimated

probability of leaving welfare, and
the lowest estimated probability
of returning," Baskin said. Overall
probability of welfare in this case
is approximately 25 percent.
The study indicates that
welfare recipients will try to
maximize their income,
prompting Boskin to suggest that
the obvious way to get people off
welfare rolls is to make it
worthwhile for them financially.
"Our results suggest that the
way to induce heads of

households on welfare to work in
the market is to raise their
expected wages. For example, a
wage subsidy or negative payroll
tax could be instituted," he
remarked.
Such a government plan to
supplement minimum wages in
the private sector, Boskin
theorized, could prove less
burdensome to state taxpayers
and more productive than the
present welfare system.
