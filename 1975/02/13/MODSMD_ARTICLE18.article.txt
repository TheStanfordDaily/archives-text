# Famous British Economist Denounces GNP Expansion
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Modern economists must be
wary of theories promoting the
continual expansion of the Gross
National Product through
production, Sir John Hicks
warned Tuesday.
"A richer society may be a
stupid society or a more
discontent society," he said,
adding, "One does not have to go
far to find that out."
Speaking in Bishop
Auditorium, Hicks stressed that
although economists deal in
abstract concepts, "we have
responsibilities to the public."
A Nobel prize winner in
economics, Hicks spoke on the
"Scope and Status of Welfare
Economics" and traced the
history of welfare theory, as well

as "why it remains important and
why it gets into trouble."
"Economics is not ethics," he
explained, "although it borders on
ethics. There is a delicate path
between the two on which one
must walk." Past welfare theories
have tended to fall off of this
path, he added.
Hicks pointed out that
economists have "sought to
justify I their] concepts in terms
of natural sciences," and many
times the concepts do not fit
within a scientific discipline.
While scientific theories
attempt to be precise and
enduring, economic theories are
of necessity constantly changing,
Hicks stated.
"We try to detect general
trends, and we must simplify and
cut down," he said. "No
economic theory can do
everything we want all the time."
Hicks noted that some theories
become outdated because
conditions left unnoticed when
the theory is formulated later rise
up and become important. He
pointed to the Keynesian theory
developed during the economic
fluctuations and monetary
destabilization of the 19305.
"Keynes began a major

revolution in economics," Hicks
said, "but he left things out of
[the general theory J purposely."
Economists must work in
terms of the present world, and
they must work fast, he added. A
changing world means changing
theories, and the scope of welfare
theory has grown smaller because
times are changing too quickly to
allow for broad concepts, he said.
Hicks concluded his remarks
by reminding the audience that
economists and their theories,
specifically welfare theories,
"need to be, at all times, exposed
to criticism."
