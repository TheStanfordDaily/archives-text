# ASSU Senate Refers To Panel Plan For Full-Time Manager
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Senate voted 7-6 last
night to refer to committee a motion
that the ASSU immediately hire a
full-time financial manager.
The referral came as a defeat for
ASSU President Mike Herman and
Sens. Tim Conway and Kevin
McDermott, who urged the Senate to
immediately hire a full-time manager
without referring the motion to
committee.
The special committee will be
charged with determining whether as
full-time financial manager is needed,
and if so, with drafting a
constitutional amendment for
presentation to the student body this
spring.
The committee, composed of Sens.
Conway, McDermott, Charlotte
Germane and David Harris and chaired
by Senate Chairman Lee Rosenbaum,
has three weeks to make its report.
In the meantime, the original
Student Financial Manager Selection
Committee, which supported the
h'ring of a full-time manager, will meet
again to determine whether to go
ahead without Senate approval.
Selection Power Unclear
The Selection Committee,
composed of Herman, McDermott,
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri and Sen. Henry Harman, last
week recommended that the full-time
post go to Dave Martin.
But Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Dale Snape said that in order to hire a
full-time manager, a new selection
process would have to take place in
order to comply with University hiring
practices. Herman indicated a
willingness to reconsider.
It is unclear whether the Selection
Committee has the power to appoint a
non-student financial manager.
Herman said he is empowered to hire
whomever he chooses.
Sen. Mike Lindsey, however,
quoted sections of the ASSU
Constitution and By-laws purporting

to show that amendments are needed
to hire either a full-time financial
manager or a full-time special events
director. Rosenbaum said the
constitutionality of hiring full-time
employees was "in doubt."
Herman has recommended that
Danny Scher be made full-time special
events director, providing a full-tirm>
financial manager is hired.
Feb. 15 Deadline
According to the letters of former
University President Kenneth Pitzer,
which amend the constitution, an
associate financial manager must be
hired by Feb. 15. The associate
financial manager's joo is the training
ground for the new financial manager.
It now seems unlikely that the Feb.
15 deadline will be met, but the
consequences of this delay are
unknown.

The major argument for
immediately hiring a full-time financial
manager, as stated by Olivieri, is that
the ASSU now needs a full-time
person to investigate the proposed
ASSU takeover of Tresidder and to
negotiate funding with the University.
Arguments against this hiring,
slated by Sens. Chris Gray and Debbi
Silton, center around funding for the
position and the need to ensure that
the full-time manager is completely
accountable to the students.
Other Programs Endangered
In a question and answer period
centered on the SWOPSI/SCIRE
question, Provost William F. Miller and
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs pointed out that these two
programs are not the only ones in
danger.
"We're likely to see the merging or

phasing out of academic departments
and schools before the
| budget-cutting) process is over,"
predicted Miller.
Asked about the possibility of
obtaining outside funding for the two
programs, Gibbs observed that outside
funds usually last only a few years, so
it would be "better to put the budget
base in the University program now"
because in a few years the problem of
the University picking up the costs
would arise again.
"Foundations like to fund things
which are brand new so they can take
credit for them," Gibbs added.
Gibbs commented that he was
"very concerned" by the negative
student response to his UNGRASPEL
(Undergraduate Special Agency)
proposal and would like more
recommendations "on how a
consolidated agency could work."
