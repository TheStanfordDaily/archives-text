—Susan Atkins, upon being
sentenced to death for the murder
of Sharon Tate and six others.
What can you say about this
book? It is almost beyond words.
It will horrify you. It will frighten
you nearly to death. It will make
you hear small noises in the night.
It will make you think twice
about opening your door after
dark.
Perhaps worst of all, it will
make you read on. Go past the
first three pages and you won't be
able to stop, no matter how much
you want to.
Vincent Bugliosi (pronounced
boo-100-oh-see) was an assistant
DA in Los Angeles in 1969 when
actress Sharon Tate and four of
her friends were slaughtered in a
murder so brutal it defied human
sensibilities.
Bugliosi wound up prosecuting

the murderers in a trial at least as
bizarre as the killings themselves.
Here, for the first time, he has
compiled the entire story, using
massive documentation and
clipped, concise prose to hammer
home what must be one of the
most frightening tales in American
history.
The cast of defendants seemed
drawn from the most paranoid
visions of the American right:
crazed hippies butchering
innocent people at the direction
of a bearded psychotic who used
sex, drugs and mystic philosophy
to turn good, clean-living
American youngsters into
zombies.
Unfortunately, Charles Manson
and his Family weren't created in
the pages of Liberty Letter; they
were living, breathing creatures,
and the trail of blood they left
across Southern California
continues to grow even now.
Manson, who has spent over
half his life in prison, somehow
assembled a band of 35 or 40
followers after a federal parole
board turned down his request to
remain in prison when his last

tern expired in 1967.
At first, in San Francisco's
Haight-Ashbury district, the
Family was interested in more
exotic pursuits: according to Paul
Watkins, who stayed with Manson
about two years, the group
worked for quite some time on
achieving simultaneous orgasm
among all the participants in the
huge nightly orgies that Charlie
directed in the Family house.
Gradually, though, Manson
became more obsessed with
"Helter Skelter," a concept he
said the Beatles were
communicating directly to him
through their song of the same
name. Helter Skelter, Manson
said, would be the ultimate
cataclysm, a racial
Armageddon that would end with
blacks wiping out all whites —
except the Family, which would
descend to the center of the earth
through a hole in the bottom of
Death Valley.
Then, Manson explained, the
blacks would be unable to handle
their new-found power to control
the planet and would have to
hand it over to the only whites
who were left: the Family, which
would come back out of the hole
in Death Valley (Family members
actually spent much of their time
searching Death Valley for the
hole, which Manson said was
prophesied in the Book of
Revelations).
Manson eventually got tired of
waiting for Helter Skelter to
begin; the blacks, he concluded,
were too stupid to get things
started.
'The only thing blackie knows
is what whitey has told him or
showed him," Manson told
Watkins. "So someone is going to
have to show him how to do it."

Helter Skelter would begin, the
bloodbath would commence, and
soon Manson would be in control:
"Charlie would scratch blackie's
fuzzy head and kick him in the
butt and tell him to go pick
cotton and go be a good nigger,
and we would live happily ever
after," Watkins described it.
Gruesome Murders
Thus, in the summer of 1969, a
gruesome series of murders began.
In each case slogans were scrawled
on walls and doors in the victims'
own blood: "Political Piggy,"
"Death to Pigs," "Pig." The
Family, at Manson's direction,
was trying to touch off Helter
Skelter.
The murders themselves are
bad enough; the idea that Manson
exerted such total control over
the displaced young men and
women who followed him to
Southern California from San
Francisco is even more grotesque.
Most of them actually believed he
was Christ.
"Just before we got busted in
the desert, there was 12 of us
apostles and Charlie," boasted
Family member Ruth Ann
Moorehouse.
"I lived with Charlie for one
year straight and on and off for
two years," said Watkins,
probably the most intelligent and
articulate member of the Family.
"I know Charlie. I know him
inside and out. I became Charlie.
Everything 1 once was, was
Charlie. There was nothing left of
me anymore.
"And all of the people in the
Family, there's nothing left of
them any more. They're all
Charlie, too."
Besides providing a chilling
glimpse into the netherworld
populated by Manson, and his

zombie-like followers, Bugliosi's
book provides a fascinating
chronicle of police ineptitude
matched in recent history only by
the San Francisco Police
Department's astounding
buffoonery while investigating the
Symbionese Liberation Army.
Foul Ups
The Los Angeles police seemed
determined to foul up the case.
First they kicked evidence at the
Tate murder scene all over the
place before it was properly
charted. They destroyed a bloody
fingerprint that almost certainly
belonged to one of the killers.
Blood samples were taken and
tested at random. Wounds weren't
measured properly and foolish
assumptions about the dimensions
of the murder weapon were made
without evidence.
Two bungles, though, stand
head and shoulders above the
others. The day after the Tate
killings, the L.A. Sheriff's Office
informed detectives on the case
that it was investigating a murder
with striking similarities: a victim
with multiple stab wounds, and
messages scrawled on the walls in
blood. A member of the Manson
Family was being held in
connection with the killing.
The police weren't interested
in even questioning the man,
although if they had checked at
all they could have cut four
months off their investigation.
Nor were they very interested in a
.22 caliber pistol a little boy
found not far from the Tate
home, even though two of the
Tate victims were killed with a .22
bullet.
The Tate detectives, who were
sending letters across the country
in an effort to locate the gun,
didn't bother to mention it to
their own Van Nuys division,
which took the report of the
child's discovery.
The gun was locked away in an
obscure file until mid-December,
when the boy's father finally
concluded the gun was the murder
weapon and made several phone
calls to the police.
Incompetence
In fact, the only reason
Bugliosi managed to get a
conviction, it seems, is that the
Manson F'amily was even more
incompetent at killing than the
police were at investigating.
Manson and several others had
bragged about the killings to a
large number of people, and when
killer Susan Atkins began
revealing the incredible details to
jail inmates while she was being
held on another charge, word
finally got back to police.
Without those confessions,
Bugliosi might never have been
able to compile this incredible tale
of debauchery and degradation.
And perhaps the whole story is
not in yet; Bugliosi speculates the
Family may have killed as many
as 35 times.
That toll will undoubtedly rise
if Manson and his followers get
back onto the streets anytime
soon (they'll be eligible for parole
in 1978, although most observers
expect them to stay in prison
much longer).
The Family itself makes no
bones about its intentions. As he
headed for prison, member Bobby
Beausoleil said: "You just better
hope I never get out."
