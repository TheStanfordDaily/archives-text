# McGuinn, Ronstadt Please Berkeley Fans
## 
### D. PAUL YEUELL 
Roger McGuinn and Linda
Ronstadt have been on the road
recently with a country-western
show. liist Thursday they played at the
Berkeley Community Theatre to a
full house.
Most of the crowd at Berkeley
were there to see Linda Ronstadt,
country honey extraordinaire.
"So who is this McGowan guy,
anyway?" not a few tender city
boys asked their tender city girls.
"McGuinn, Roger McGuinn,"
was undoubtedly the answer. "He
used to play with the Byrds. You
know, "Mr. Tambourine
Man . . . "
"Yeah, yeah."
To say that McGuinn used to
be with the Byrds is to say that
Nixon was somehow fuzzily and

indirectly related to the crimes of
Watergate. For several years,
McGuinn was the Byrds.
Since 1969, McGuinn's
musical ambitions have been the
force behind the songs of the
Byrds. At best, they represent a
serious attempt to deal with this
decade's social issues. Most
indulgently, they must include a
young man's ambition to become
a red-hot rock-n-roll star.
McGuinn's set at Berkeley
reflected these ambitions.
Beginning with an accoustic
version of "Ballad of Easy Rider"
and then "Wasn't Born to
Follow," McGuinn and his band
evoked memories of that summer
of 1969 when the film Easy
Rider was released.
Easy Rider shocked not a few

people into seeing that the cruel
horrors of the sixties were here in
the states as well as in Southeast
Asia. That image of Peter Fonda,
having been blown off the road by
a shot-gun blast, floating in slow
motion over a fence and tumbling
slowly with his motorcycle into a
field came to mind at Thursday's
concert as McGuinn sang the
words of "Ballad of Easy Rider,"
which ends that movie.
''All he wanted,
was to be free ..."
McGuinn's set a mixture of
the old and the new. Some of the
old came up short: "Tambourine
Man" was a bit weak next to
songs like "Chestnut Mare" or
"Born to Rock-n-Roll."
As far as rock-n-roll, McGuinn
saved the big one for the encore.
On he came with all the lights off.
One small spotlight was trained on
his face.
In the dark, the band rumbled
into "So You Want to be a
Rock-n-Roll Star" and everybody
started stomping.

"So you want to be a
rock-n-roll star
well listen now to what I say;
just get an electric guitar
and take some time and learn
how to play."
And outrageously, McGuinn's
guitar gleamed fully electric. In
the dark, his guitar lit up, flashing
reds and greens and yellows as he
played, mildly mesmerizing the
house.
Linda Ronstadt, who had
top-billing for this show, played a
very professional set. Her band is
very tight and sticky sweet with
not one but two pedal steel guitar
players.
Her act is very much country
in the full dramatic sense. In
addition to the music, the
instruments and the lyrics, the
overwhelming mood of her show
is rural and south of the
Mason-Dixon line.
On songs like "Desperado" and
"A Long, Long Time," which
both have very personal lyrics and
incredible dynamics, the country
act becomes very convincing.
With low red lights on and the
pedal steel weeping softly in the
background, Linda Ronstadt
becomes a heartbroken girl on
the porch of a white clapboard
house in the foothills of Kentucky,
making a final plea to her
unfaithful man.
And the beauty of Ronstadt's
act is that you feel the eternity
required to recover from this kind
of hurt and you sense the
Faulknerian pathos and perpetual
suffering that is the essence of
country music.

full house.
Most of the crowd at Berkeley
were there to see Linda Ronstadt,
country honey extraordinaire.
"So who is this McGowan guy,
anyway?" not a few tender city
boys asked their tender city girls.
"McGuinn, Roger McGuinn,"
was undoubtedly the answer. "He
used to play with the Byrds. You
know, "Mr. Tambourine
Man . . . "
"Yeah, yeah."
To say that McGuinn used to
be with the Byrds is to say that
Nixon was somehow fuzzily and

indirectly related to the crimes of
Watergate. For several years,
McGuinn was the Byrds.
Since 1969, McGuinn's
musical ambitions have been the
force behind the songs of the
Byrds. At best, they represent a
serious attempt to deal with this
decade's social issues. Most
indulgently, they must include a
young man's ambition to become
a red-hot rock-n-roll star.
McGuinn's set at Berkeley
reflected these ambitions.
Beginning with an accoustic
version of "Ballad of Easy Rider"
and then "Wasn't Born to
Follow," McGuinn and his band
evoked memories of that summer
of 1969 when the film Easy
Rider was released.
Easy Rider shocked not a few

people into seeing that the cruel
horrors of the sixties were here in
the states as well as in Southeast
Asia. That image of Peter Fonda,
having been blown off the road by
a shot-gun blast, floating in slow
motion over a fence and tumbling
slowly with his motorcycle into a
field came to mind at Thursday's
concert as McGuinn sang the
words of "Ballad of Easy Rider,"
which ends that movie.
''All he wanted,
was to be free ..."
McGuinn's set a mixture of
the old and the new. Some of the
old came up short: "Tambourine
Man" was a bit weak next to
songs like "Chestnut Mare" or
"Born to Rock-n-Roll."
As far as rock-n-roll, McGuinn
saved the big one for the encore.
On he came with all the lights off.
One small spotlight was trained on
his face.
In the dark, the band rumbled
into "So You Want to be a
Rock-n-Roll Star" and everybody
started stomping.

"So you want to be a
rock-n-roll star
well listen now to what I say;
just get an electric guitar
and take some time and learn
how to play."
And outrageously, McGuinn's
guitar gleamed fully electric. In
the dark, his guitar lit up, flashing
reds and greens and yellows as he
played, mildly mesmerizing the
house.
Linda Ronstadt, who had
top-billing for this show, played a
very professional set. Her band is
very tight and sticky sweet with
not one but two pedal steel guitar
players.
Her act is very much country
in the full dramatic sense. In
addition to the music, the
instruments and the lyrics, the
overwhelming mood of her show
is rural and south of the
Mason-Dixon line.
On songs like "Desperado" and
"A Long, Long Time," which
both have very personal lyrics and
incredible dynamics, the country
act becomes very convincing.
With low red lights on and the
pedal steel weeping softly in the
background, Linda Ronstadt
becomes a heartbroken girl on
the porch of a white clapboard
house in the foothills of Kentucky,
making a final plea to her
unfaithful man.
And the beauty of Ronstadt's
act is that you feel the eternity
required to recover from this kind
of hurt and you sense the
Faulknerian pathos and perpetual
suffering that is the essence of
country music.
