# Best Bets

This column is intended to
provide you with a brief,
interesting and informative look
at the things most worth doing
and seeing in the upcoming
week. Realizing that we are all
short of time, this critic intends
to select and present from the
listings in Spectrum the
activities that are especially
attractive.
From time to time, we may
leave out something you
consider valuable. For that, we
are sorry. But, if we have any
bias at all, it is only one that
leans in a direction of quality*
and variety.
This week, several sporting
events deserve prominent
mention. On Friday night in
Maples Pavilion, the varsity
basketball team takes on the
University of Washington. Last
weekend, the Huskies defeated
the Cards by only one point.
This should be a rough and
tumble rematch — and it will
probably test the strength of a
home court advantage.
On Saturday, the Cards take
on Washington State, whom
they beat last weekend. The
game will be televised but
should be worth seeing in
person.
Also, on Saturday afternoon,
Stanford's swim team takes on
number-one (nationally) ranked
USC. Stanford will be trying to
upset the Trojans' mermen in
this important Pac-8 meet.
In the realm of music, the
Public Events office will be
presenting the Tokyo String
Quartet on Friday, Sunday and
Tuesday. The quartet, which is
the leading representative of
chamber music in Japan, is
billed by a press release as

presenting a "mastery of the
subtleties of style and taste"
that mark a first class group.
The quartet won first place in
last year's International
Chamber Music Competition.
If rock music is your forte,
try Jerry Jeff Walker, appearing
tonight at the Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco. He
wrote "Mr. Bojangles" and also
had a top forty hit two years
ago — "L.A. Freeway." If
nothing else, his songs are
musically acceptable and he
does an excellent Neil Diamond
impersonation — in everything
he sings.
For jazz buffs, Monday
night's gathering at Oakland's
Paramount Theater is worth
noting. It features: trumpeter
Freddie Hubbard, pianist
McCoy Tyner, bassist Ron
Carter and drummer Elvin
Jones, among others. Each of
these men is a jazz star and they
haven't played together before.
If you prefer a stage
experience, one will come on
Tuesday night; when the
Stanford Drama Department
premiers Beggar's Opera, John
Gay's 1728 play on which the
Threepenny Opera, of Kurt
Weill and Bertolt Brecht was
based.
This play, according to
director and drama chairman
Charles Lyons, will feature
"flexible staging," meaning no
clear cut boundaries between
the actors and the audience.
That's its creativity; the play
itself, a biting political satire,
features a cast of rogues, thieves
and whores (the characters, not
the actors — we don't mean to
be libelous).
Professional stage talent

comes this week on Saturday
night, in the form of Buddy
Ebsen (alias "Barnaby Jones")
at San Jose City College.
If you're still wondering who
he is, try the name Jed
Clampett from The Beverly
Hillbillies. Supposedly, he
tapdances up a storm and even
sings well. And if his act is
boring, at least ask him where
to drill for oil, black gold, texas
tea or whatever they called it in
that show.
Since we've raised the
subject of television, let us only
say that this week's Creature
Feature screens Burn Witch
Burn on Saturday night. We
know this show tries to get
vintage films and this must be
one; according to the S.F.
Chronicle Pink Section, it was
made in 1862.
Newer and better films can
readily be viewed in the
Stanford area this week. At the
Palo Alto Square, don't miss
Murder On the Orient Express.
This update of a 1930's Agatha
Christie novel will, as Daily
critic George Powell
commented, "entertain and
dazzle you." It is one hell of a
mystery thriller.
Another mystery, because
one wonders why it was ever
made, is Earthquake, at the
Bijou. If you've always wanted
to see L.A. crumble before your
eyes or if you need to be jolted
out of midtermitis, try it —
complete with "sensurround."
If you still can't get away
from midterms and school
pressures, try the very best bet
of this week. It occurs on
Monday and it is called a
holiday. Enjoy it.

superstars for a Monday night concert at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. The
all-star group, billed as the "Black Classical Music Society," will perform in a
benefit for San Francisco's Keystone Korner club.

subtleties of style and taste"
that mark a first class group.
The quartet won first place in
last year's International
Chamber Music Competition.
If rock music is your forte,
try Jerry Jeff Walker, appearing
tonight at the Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco. He
wrote "Mr. Bojangles" and also
had a top forty hit two years
ago — "L.A. Freeway." If
nothing else, his songs are
musically acceptable and he
does an excellent Neil Diamond
impersonation — in everything
he sings.
For jazz buffs, Monday
night's gathering at Oakland's
Paramount Theater is worth
noting. It features: trumpeter
Freddie Hubbard, pianist
McCoy Tyner, bassist Ron
Carter and drummer Elvin
Jones, among others. Each of
these men is a jazz star and they
haven't played together before.
If you prefer a stage
experience, one will come on
Tuesday night; when the
Stanford Drama Department
premiers Beggar's Opera, John
Gay's 1728 play on which the
Threepenny Opera, of Kurt
Weill and Bertolt Brecht was
based.
This play, according to
director and drama chairman
Charles Lyons, will feature
"flexible staging," meaning no
clear cut boundaries between
the actors and the audience.
That's its creativity; the play
itself, a biting political satire,
features a cast of rogues, thieves
and whores (the characters, not
the actors — we don't mean to
be libelous).
Professional stage talent

comes this week on Saturday
night, in the form of Buddy
Ebsen (alias "Barnaby Jones")
at San Jose City College.
If you're still wondering who
he is, try the name Jed
Clampett from The Beverly
Hillbillies. Supposedly, he
tapdances up a storm and even
sings well. And if his act is
boring, at least ask him where
to drill for oil, black gold, texas
tea or whatever they called it in
that show.
Since we've raised the
subject of television, let us only
say that this week's Creature
Feature screens Burn Witch
Burn on Saturday night. We
know this show tries to get
vintage films and this must be
one; according to the S.F.
Chronicle Pink Section, it was
made in 1862.
Newer and better films can
readily be viewed in the
Stanford area this week. At the
Palo Alto Square, don't miss
Murder On the Orient Express.
This update of a 1930's Agatha
Christie novel will, as Daily
critic George Powell
commented, "entertain and
dazzle you." It is one hell of a
mystery thriller.
Another mystery, because
one wonders why it was ever
made, is Earthquake, at the
Bijou. If you've always wanted
to see L.A. crumble before your
eyes or if you need to be jolted
out of midtermitis, try it —
complete with "sensurround."
If you still can't get away
from midterms and school
pressures, try the very best bet
of this week. It occurs on
Monday and it is called a
holiday. Enjoy it.

HUB OF THE ACTlON—Freddie Hubbard will be joined by four other jazz
superstars for a Monday night concert at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. The
all-star group, billed as the "Black Classical Music Society," will perform in a
benefit for San Francisco's Keystone Korner club.
This column is intended to
provide you with a brief,
interesting and informative look
at the things most worth doing
and seeing in the upcoming
week. Realizing that we are all
short of time, this critic intends
to select and present from the
listings in Spectrum the
activities that are especially
attractive.
From time to time, we may
leave out something you
consider valuable. For that, we
are sorry. But, if we have any
bias at all, it is only one that
leans in a direction of quality*
and variety.
This week, several sporting
events deserve prominent
mention. On Friday night in
Maples Pavilion, the varsity
basketball team takes on the
University of Washington. Last
weekend, the Huskies defeated
the Cards by only one point.
This should be a rough and
tumble rematch — and it will
probably test the strength of a
home court advantage.
On Saturday, the Cards take
on Washington State, whom
they beat last weekend. The
game will be televised but
should be worth seeing in
person.
Also, on Saturday afternoon,
Stanford's swim team takes on
number-one (nationally) ranked
USC. Stanford will be trying to
upset the Trojans' mermen in
this important Pac-8 meet.
In the realm of music, the
Public Events office will be
presenting the Tokyo String
Quartet on Friday, Sunday and
Tuesday. The quartet, which is
the leading representative of
chamber music in Japan, is
billed by a press release as

presenting a "mastery of the
subtleties of style and taste"
that mark a first class group.

Professional stage talent

comes this week on Saturday
night, in the form of Buddy
Ebsen (alias "Barnaby Jones")
at San Jose City College.
If you're still wondering who
he is, try the name Jed
Clampett from The Beverly
Hillbillies. Supposedly, he
tapdances up a storm and even
sings well. And if his act is
boring, at least ask him where
to drill for oil, black gold, texas
tea or whatever they called it in
that show.
Since we've raised the
subject of television, let us only
say that this week's Creature
Feature screens Burn Witch
Burn on Saturday night. We
know this show tries to get
vintage films and this must be
one; according to the S.F.
Chronicle Pink Section, it was
made in 1862.
Newer and better films can
readily be viewed in the
Stanford area this week. At the
Palo Alto Square, don't miss
Murder On the Orient Express.
This update of a 1930's Agatha
Christie novel will, as Daily
critic George Powell
commented, "entertain and
dazzle you." It is one hell of a
mystery thriller.
Another mystery, because
one wonders why it was ever
made, is Earthquake, at the
Bijou. If you've always wanted
to see L.A. crumble before your
eyes or if you need to be jolted
out of midtermitis, try it —
complete with "sensurround."
If you still can't get away
from midterms and school
pressures, try the very best bet
of this week. It occurs on
Monday and it is called a
holiday. Enjoy it.

HUB OF THE ACTlON—Freddie Hubbard will be joined by four other jazz
superstars for a Monday night concert at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. The
all-star group, billed as the "Black Classical Music Society," will perform in a
benefit for San Francisco's Keystone Korner club.
This column is intended to
provide you with a brief,
interesting and informative look
at the things most worth doing
and seeing in the upcoming
week. Realizing that we are all
short of time, this critic intends
to select and present from the
listings in Spectrum the
activities that are especially
attractive.
From time to time, we may
leave out something you
consider valuable. For that, we
are sorry. But, if we have any
bias at all, it is only one that
leans in a direction of quality*
and variety.
This week, several sporting
events deserve prominent
mention. On Friday night in
Maples Pavilion, the varsity
basketball team takes on the
University of Washington. Last
weekend, the Huskies defeated
the Cards by only one point.
This should be a rough and
tumble rematch — and it will
probably test the strength of a
home court advantage.
On Saturday, the Cards take
on Washington State, whom
they beat last weekend. The
game will be televised but
should be worth seeing in
person.
Also, on Saturday afternoon,
Stanford's swim team takes on
number-one (nationally) ranked
USC. Stanford will be trying to
upset the Trojans' mermen in
this important Pac-8 meet.
In the realm of music, the
Public Events office will be
presenting the Tokyo String
Quartet on Friday, Sunday and
Tuesday. The quartet, which is
the leading representative of
chamber music in Japan, is
billed by a press release as

presenting a "mastery of the
subtleties of style and taste"
that mark a first class group.
The quartet won first place in
last year's International
Chamber Music Competition.
If rock music is your forte,
try Jerry Jeff Walker, appearing
tonight at the Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco. He
wrote "Mr. Bojangles" and also
had a top forty hit two years
ago — "L.A. Freeway." If
nothing else, his songs are
musically acceptable and he
does an excellent Neil Diamond
impersonation — in everything
he sings.
For jazz buffs, Monday
night's gathering at Oakland's
Paramount Theater is worth
noting. It features: trumpeter
Freddie Hubbard, pianist
McCoy Tyner, bassist Ron
Carter and drummer Elvin
Jones, among others. Each of
these men is a jazz star and they
haven't played together before.
If you prefer a stage
experience, one will come on
Tuesday night; when the
Stanford Drama Department
premiers Beggar's Opera, John
Gay's 1728 play on which the
Threepenny Opera, of Kurt
Weill and Bertolt Brecht was
based.
This play, according to
director and drama chairman
Charles Lyons, will feature
"flexible staging," meaning no
clear cut boundaries between
the actors and the audience.
That's its creativity; the play
itself, a biting political satire,
features a cast of rogues, thieves
and whores (the characters, not
the actors — we don't mean to
be libelous).
