# Winterland Lineup Announced
## 
### 
Bill Graham's Winterland lineups for the next
few weeks feature two members of popular
English rock groups who are presently on solo
tours.
Alvin Lee, whose lightning-quick guitar solos
have earned him fame as the guiding light of the
group Ten Years After, will appear at Winterland
this Friday and Saturday nights.
John Entwistle, the stone-faced bassist for the

Who (and a capable French hom player as well)
will lead his band Ox in on Feb. 22 and 23.
Topping the bill with Ox will be the Boston
rockers, the J. Geils Band, featuring vocalist
Peter Wolf and the raunchy blues harmonica of
Magic Dick.
Another English group, Humble Pie, will
return to the Bay Area with a Winterland
appearance March 7 and 8.
