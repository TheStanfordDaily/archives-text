Senate Panel Voles To Block Ford Plan
WASHINGTON — Legislation to block the first part of
President Ford's energy program won Senate committee
approval yesterday but it appeared that if the bill passes,
the Senate may have trouble overriding Ford's expected
veto.
The bill, already passed by the House, would suspend for
30 days Ford's $3-per-barrel special tax on imported oil,
giving Congress time to write its own energy program.
Ford's plan is intended to discourage energy use by driving
up prices.
A White House press spokesman said after the 12-2
Finance Committe vote, "The President just believes
Congress is wasting time trying to delay action" and should
be working instead on his economic-energy legislation.
Although 54 of the 100 senators are sponsors of the
delay bill, up to 67 votes would be required to override the
veto.
Democrats hold 61 Senate seats and could be expected
to pick up eight or 10 Republicans on an override attempt,
but there is doubt enough Democrats could stick together
to enact the delay over a vote.
At least three of the 12 Finance Committee members
who voted to send the bill to the floor will vote against it,
including chairman Russell B. Long (D-La.).
Demos" Financial Reports Subpoenaed
WASHINGTON — The Watergate Special Prosecution
Force has subpoenaed finance reports of the Democratic
party for 1970 and 1971 in a grand jury investigation into
possible violation of a campaign reporting law.
Democratic Chairman Robert Strauss and a spokesman
for the Watergate prosecutors declined comment yesterday
on the investigation. Strauss also declined a reporter's
request to view copies of the subpoenaed documents, which
are no longer public.
The subpoenaed reports cover the period in which
Strauss, who was then party treasurer, accepted a $50,000
cash gift from Ashland Oil Inc. The oil company admitted
last year that the money was an illegal corporate donation.
Strauss has said he was unaware of the illegal nature of
the gift. He also has said he did not disclose the identity of
the donor in public reports that he filed at the time, and
that he lumped it instead under unitemized miscellaneous
contributions.
Sadat, Kissinger Express Optimism
CAIRO — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and
President Anwar Sadar expressed confidence and optimism
yesterday after talking about possible Egyptian concessions
for an Israeli pullback in Sinai.
"I am confident further progress can be made,"
Kissinger told newsmen after four hours of talks with
Sadat.
The Egyptian president said they had "made a survey for
the whole problem and this is quite sufficient for the

moment. I am satisfied. I am always optimistic when I
receive my friend Henry."
Kissinger thought from Jerusalem a detailed Israeli
position, including about a dozen specific steps toward an
end to the Arabs' economic, political and diplomatic
boycott of Israel.
"We have made some progress in clarifying the issues and
indicating the directions in which a solution should be
found," Kissinger said.

Senate Panel Voles To Block Ford Plan
WASHINGTON — Legislation to block the first part of
President Ford's energy program won Senate committee
approval yesterday but it appeared that if the bill passes,
the Senate may have trouble overriding Ford's expected
veto.
The bill, already passed by the House, would suspend for
30 days Ford's $3-per-barrel special tax on imported oil,
giving Congress time to write its own energy program.
Ford's plan is intended to discourage energy use by driving
up prices.
A White House press spokesman said after the 12-2
Finance Committe vote, "The President just believes
Congress is wasting time trying to delay action" and should
be working instead on his economic-energy legislation.
Although 54 of the 100 senators are sponsors of the
delay bill, up to 67 votes would be required to override the
veto.
Democrats hold 61 Senate seats and could be expected
to pick up eight or 10 Republicans on an override attempt,
but there is doubt enough Democrats could stick together
to enact the delay over a vote.
At least three of the 12 Finance Committee members
who voted to send the bill to the floor will vote against it,
including chairman Russell B. Long (D-La.).
Demos" Financial Reports Subpoenaed
WASHINGTON — The Watergate Special Prosecution
Force has subpoenaed finance reports of the Democratic
party for 1970 and 1971 in a grand jury investigation into
possible violation of a campaign reporting law.
Democratic Chairman Robert Strauss and a spokesman
for the Watergate prosecutors declined comment yesterday
on the investigation. Strauss also declined a reporter's
request to view copies of the subpoenaed documents, which
are no longer public.
The subpoenaed reports cover the period in which
Strauss, who was then party treasurer, accepted a $50,000
cash gift from Ashland Oil Inc. The oil company admitted
last year that the money was an illegal corporate donation.
Strauss has said he was unaware of the illegal nature of
the gift. He also has said he did not disclose the identity of
the donor in public reports that he filed at the time, and
that he lumped it instead under unitemized miscellaneous
contributions.
Sadat, Kissinger Express Optimism
CAIRO — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and
President Anwar Sadar expressed confidence and optimism
yesterday after talking about possible Egyptian concessions
for an Israeli pullback in Sinai.
"I am confident further progress can be made,"
Kissinger told newsmen after four hours of talks with
Sadat.
The Egyptian president said they had "made a survey for
the whole problem and this is quite sufficient for the

moment. I am satisfied. I am always optimistic when I
receive my friend Henry."
Kissinger thought from Jerusalem a detailed Israeli
position, including about a dozen specific steps toward an
end to the Arabs' economic, political and diplomatic
boycott of Israel.
"We have made some progress in clarifying the issues and
indicating the directions in which a solution should be
found," Kissinger said.
