# Decisions Deferred On Budget Priorities
## 
### KIM NYEGAARD RIV WEBER 
"There were no decisions in the
1975-76 budget recommendations that
prejudice future decisions" concerning
SWOPSI and SCIRE, Vice Provost for
iJudget and Planning Ray Baccetti
declared yesterday in the Round
Room of Memorial Church.
"I do know that both decisions on
SWOPSI and Urban Studies have been
deferred," Bacchetti said. "Those two
programs are as good or as bad a
candidate for permanent funding as
anything else in 1976-77."
Bacchetti was speaking in the third
of a series of lunch-time discussions
concerning the University's budget
priorities.

SCIRE, SWOPSI and Urban Studies
were originally funded with a Ford
Foundation grant and with a
University allocation of $25,000,
Bacchetti said. "In the early '70s there
was a budget base allocation"
supplemented with grants.
However, "budget base money
these days does not guarantee your
future since we're $10 million shy of
budget base money this year," he said.
In discussing the "inevitable" $10
million cut, Bacchetti emphasized
"judgments about the consequences."
When asked about the input of
students regarding placement of cuts,
he explained the importance of the
"quality of opinions. It doesn't matter
a whole lot where they come. I don't
think headcounts are terribly
important in a university."
Bacchetti, outlining the derivation
of ideas for the "President's budget,"
said: "At the upper levels the power is
primarily negative. The President can
say no to something, but he very
seldom initiates something.
"The ideas don't originate in the
mind of a dean or a provost," he said.
"They originate in the minds of
faculty members or resident staff or
students. It would really be dumb to
do it any other way, because that's
where the intelligence is."
One student asked Bacchetti to
comment on the difference in cost to
educate a physics student and a
humanities student, but Bacchetti
discouraged making cost comparisons
between departments because "prices
are facts and costs are opinions," he
said.
Looking into the future, Bacchetti
foresaw a "difficult choice between
variety and specialization" in the
curriculum here.
