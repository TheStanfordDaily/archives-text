# Decisions Deferred On Budget Priorities
## 
### KIM NYEGAARD RIV WEBER 
"There were no decisions in the
1975-76 budget recommendations that
prejudice future decisions" concerning
SWOPSI and SCIRE, Vice Provost for
iJudget and Planning Ray Baccetti
declared yesterday in the Round
Room of Memorial Church.
"I do know that both decisions on
SWOPSI and Urban Studies have been
deferred," Bacchetti said. "Those two
programs are as good or as bad a
candidate for permanent funding as
anything else in 1976-77."
Bacchetti was speaking in the third
of a series of lunch-time discussions
concerning the University's budget
priorities.

SCIRE, SWOPSI and Urban Studies
were originally funded with a Ford
Foundation grant and with a
University allocation of $25,000,
Bacchetti said. "In the early '70s there
was a budget base allocation"
supplemented with grants.
However, "budget base money
these days does not guarantee your
future since we're $10 million shy of
budget base money this year," he said.
In discussing the "inevitable" $10
million cut, Bacchetti emphasized
"judgments about the consequences."
When asked about the input of
students regarding placement of cuts,
he explained the importance of the
"quality of opinions. It doesn't matter
