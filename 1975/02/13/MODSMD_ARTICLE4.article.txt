# Gibbs Backs Financial Aid Plan Based On Student Need, Not Race
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs said in an interview
Tuesday that he believes the new
financial aid "policy is a very sound
one because it bases financial aid on
financial need" rather than on a
student's race.
Gibbs, who in a controversial memo
last November, supported a more rigid
self-help requirement for all students,
explained that "after talking to some
students I felt that the $700 self-help
figure was too rigid." (Self-help is
money provided by the student
through term-time earnings or
long-term loan.)
The proposed policy change, to be
presented to the Faculty Senate at its
meeting next Thursday, would treat all
low-income students the same,
regardless of race, in matters of
financial aid.

Currently, blacks, chicanos and
native Americans are not required to
provide self-help, while low-income
non-minorities pay an average of $800.
Under the proposal by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(CUAFA), all lowinconie students
(those from three-child families whose
annual net earnings are less than
$9070) would have a $450 self-help
expectation as freshmen. This would
increase $50 per year.
An 'Inducement'
Minority students outside the very
low-income category will be required
to pay 84 percent of the self-help
expected of non-minority students of
similar status. This would amount to
an average saving of $200 per year.
The report said that this difference
is "an inducement, in parallel with the
reduced self-help expectation applied
to other groups of students (e.g.
unusually highly qualified
academically) the University is anxious
to enroll."
Minority students contacted
yesterday had not had enough time to
study the report. Josefina Jaramillo, a
spokesperson for the chicanos said
they "haven't had a chance to go over
the proposal" and would issue a
statement after it has been discussed.
Mae Jemison, president of the
Black Students' Union, voiced a
similar view, but noted that she
opposed the original committee
proposal requiring $700 self-help for
low-income students, because it was
"not fulfilling Stanford's commitment
to minority students."
Requires Faculty Senate Approval
The committee report will be on
the Feb. 20 Faculty Senate agenda.
The Senate can accept it as is, amend
it and accept it, or send it back to
committee for further changes.
Biology Prof. Paul Green, chairman
of CUAFA, has said that changes in
financial aid policy must be approved

by the Senate by March 1 if it
is to be effective next year.
Green said that he would "be
surprised" if the con-mittee proposal is
defeated by tiu> Senate.
Director of Financial Aid Robert
Huff, an ex-officio member of the
committee, said "We've worked long
and hard on the issue and listened to a
lot of different points of view."
