# Five Chairmen Still Needed At Med School
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Medical School still has five
departments without permanent
chairmen, Medical School Dean
Clayton Rich said yesterday, but those
vacancies should be filled by the end
of this academic year.
In an interview yesterday, Rich said
the search committees appointed to
find chairmen for the five departments
were "moving very actively and in
general, very effectively."
The five departments include
anatomy, pharmacology, physiology,
surgery, and gynecology and
obstetrics, Rich said.
Rich came under fire last spring by
a group of Med School students who
complained of poor clinical teaching,
citing the lack of department chairmen
in key clinical fields as a major factor.
Chairman, Director Appointed
Rich's comments followed his
announcement Tuesday that Dr.
Thomas Gonda had been appointed
chairman of the psychiatry
department and Dr. Robert Alway had
been named medical director of
Stanford Hospital.
Gonda, who has been serving as
acting psychiatry department
chairman, succeeds Dr. Albert
Stunkard, who resigned last November
for "personal reasons."
Alway is a professor of pediatrics
and director of the Stanford pediatric
clinic.
Expressing guarded optimism for
the future, Rich explained that the
Medical School situation at present
was "not very different" from last
spring.

But he noted one of the
departments that aroused student
concern, the department of medicine,
now has a chairman. Dr. Daniel
Federman changed his plans and
decided last summer to stay on.
Two other departments — anatomy
and physiology — have operated
without chairmen for almost 10 years
now, with a year-long break in 1971.
'Poor Physical Facilities'
Rich again blamed those vacancies
on poor physical facilities. He said the
school plans to merge the two
departments and move them into the
new $7.5 million Fairchild
Neurosciences Center, which should be
completed by September 1976.
The search in gynecology and
obstetrics will take "some time" yet,
Rich commented. The department is
now in its second year without a
chairman.
