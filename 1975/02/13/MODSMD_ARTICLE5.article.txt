### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Medical School still has five
departments without permanent
chairmen, Medical School Dean
Clayton Rich said yesterday, but those
vacancies should be filled by the end
of this academic year.
In an interview yesterday, Rich said
the search committees appointed to
find chairmen for the five departments
were "moving very actively and in
general, very effectively."
The five departments include
anatomy, pharmacology, physiology,
surgery, and gynecology and
obstetrics, Rich said.
Rich came under fire last spring by
a group of Med School students who
complained of poor clinical teaching,
citing the lack of department chairmen
in key clinical fields as a major factor.
Chairman, Director Appointed
Rich's comments followed his
announcement Tuesday that Dr.
Thomas Gonda had been appointed
chairman of the psychiatry
department and Dr. Robert Alway had
been named medical director of
Stanford Hospital.
Gonda, who has been serving as
acting psychiatry department
chairman, succeeds Dr. Albert
