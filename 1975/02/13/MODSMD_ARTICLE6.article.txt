# Pledges To Go Up 45%
## Horton Says Frats Must Enlarge 
### RICHARD FEARON BONNY RODDEN 
Fraternities will be required to pledge 45 percent
more members than stated house capacity under the
Committee on Student Services (COSS) housing study
recently released, Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton announced at last night's Inter-Fraternity
Council ,IFC) meeting.
Horton met with the Council only to discuss the
details of the study, refusing to discuss the sorority
question or other housing issues.
"It's not that I'm unwilling to discuss anything
outside of the report," stated Horton. "In the next
month we will be working on the details and a good
understanding of the proposal will enable you to modify
it to suit your best interests."
He told members who disagreed with the
fundamental principles of the study to write letters to
President Richard Lyman and Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
Under the proposal, all entering freshmen will be
guaranteed on-campus housing for their first year and
two specific subsequent years. The probability of being
forced off-campus during their remaining undergraduate
years, however, will be very high.
Increase Frat Memberships
All autumn-quarter transfers will be guaranteed
on-campus housing for their first year here. Sophomore
transfers will be guaranteed one additional year on
campus, too.
The study, as it stands now, would increase the
number of students living in the fraternities from 550,
this year's frat population, to 774. Fraternities will

either have to establish annexes off-campus to
accommodate the extra member or "stuff" their houses.
Horton said that no decision had been made whether
"stuffing" would be allowed. However, the same
decision will be made for both the fraternity and the
draw system.
"The so-called overcrowding issue is the most vexing
one," he told the committee. "It is a no-win
proposition."
Horton also stated that fraternities will be required to
pledge a number of sophomores proportional to the
number of sophomores who request on-campus housing.
He explained that this figure would generally be
about 45 percent of the total rated occupancy of the
house (about 23 members for a 50-man fraternity). The
quota would never exceed 50 percent of the rated
occupancy.
'Pledge Classes Won't Change'
However, Norm Robinson, director of the Row,
remarked that this below-capacity situation rarely would
be encountered.
"Pledge classes are going to stay fairly constant," he
said. "They won't change very much from year to year."
Under the new proposal, 28 percent of the fraternity
members will reside outside of the house. Currently, the
proportion of members not living in each fraternity is 25
percent.
However, the proposal allows all students to remain
on campus for all four years. Horton noted that this 22
percent figure may be higher, as it does not include
those members that go overseas.
"Overseas campuses do not count in this," he added.

A SOCRATIC DIALOGUE?—Probably not. Fraternity members listen as Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton outlines proposals made by the Committee on Student Services. During the discussion, Horton said that
Fraternities might have to "stuff" houses by 45 percent.
