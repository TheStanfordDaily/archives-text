## Housing Windfall 
### 
The Committee on Student Services report on University
housing raises the spectre of acampus in which the fraternity
system could not grow — even if such expansion could
benefit the University.
The report recommends that no new living groups be
allowed to use subjective criteria for admitting members.
Thus only the current 12 fraternities — and no all-women or
co-educational living groups — would ever be permitted to
choose their own members.
In addition to the sex discrimination inherent in this
plan, it eliminates one potentially lucrative source of
on-campus housing. We believe that living groups which are
willing to finance the construction of on-campus housing
should be allowed to set up subjective criteria for
membership, subject to several conditions:
—that the financing of the house, and its size, location and
architecture be acceptable to the University;
—that the group which plans to build the house be able to
demonstrate that student interest in its programs exists;
—that the group meets the needs and goals of the
University (for example, a group which discriminated on the
basis of race would not be allowed).
Times have changed since the Board of Trustees' 1944
decision to bar sororities. We urge the Board to reconsider
that ruling.
One sorority, Alpha Phi, has reportedly expressed interest
in financing the construction of the house for a Stanford
chapter. Should Alpha Phi meet the conditions stated, it
should be allowed to go ahead.
If sororities, fraternities and co-ed living groups
constructed such buildings, everyone would benefit.
The new buildings would help ease the housing crisis by
taking students out of the draw system. Thus, every
student's chance of getting housing would increase.
At a time when many students are protesting the lack of
on-campus housing, any proposal which would provide more
housing, while helping to end sex discrimination, can hardly
be ignored.
The University would gain additional housing at little or
no cost. In this era, when Stanford is scratching for every
available dollar, such a windfall should not be passed up.
