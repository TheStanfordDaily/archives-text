This column concerns the Jan.
15 Daily article about the
Stanford in Peru Program. Out of
the 12 original students enrolled
in the program, we the eight
people remaining here in Lima
deeply regret not having been able
to contribute to the opinions
given in that article; however with
earthquakes, soaring inflation
costs and political instability, we
understand, or are trying to
understand, the reluctance of the
Daily to send its Peruvian
correspondent here, even at the
expense of gross journalistic
misrepresentation.
It was a bit of a surprise to
read that we were both
disappointed and disillusioned by
the program, and that many of us
have returned to the United States
for that reason. We were under
the impression that the reason
that the majority of us had chosen
to remain was that this program
had offered us the unique
opportunity to experience
synergistically both the culturally
academic as well as the structured
academic environments.
Any initial dissatisfaction with
the academics was the result of
the expectations we had based on
Stanford experiences, and can in
no way be attributed to a
deficiency at the Universidad
Catolica.
At this time, as the Stanford
Overseas Program is questioning
and reevaluating its objectives and
priorities, we strongly argue that
the Stanford-in-Peru Program has
come closest of all the Overseas
Stanford Campuses to fulfilling
the professed philosophy of
"learning from living." Books and
lectures could never have taught
us the reality of a developing
country, its political struggle, or
the Latin American culture in
general as has our six months
here. The faults underlined in
your previous article are aspects

Pierog, et. al.

characteristic of all Latin
America, and rather than
constituting a basis for eliminating
the program, they are the very
reasons that the program must
exist and continue.
The overall negative impression
which your article gave was one of
bias, and misrepresentative of the
feelings of those involved in this
program.

Kitty Corbett, Maria de los
Angeles Crummett, John Doble,
Deborah Goldberg, John May and
Lou Ann Williams are currently
enrolled in the Stanford-in-Peru
Program in Lima.)
