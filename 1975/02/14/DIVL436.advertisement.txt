DEPRESSION ART "FOUND" <i
Public Offered;
1937 U.S. Gov't
Art Prints ,
A series of rare coincidences
has led to the historic discovery
of several thousand sets of ftill
color antique art prints that ware
"lost since 1937." They are nsw
being offered to the public.^
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT i
Back in 1937, immediately fol
lowing the depression years, Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt and a select
group of a dozen nationally pro
minent people formed a volun
tary national committee for art
appreciation to create an art pro
gram that would give the public a
well-needed moral lift. It was the
committee's decision to select the
world's most famous paintings
from the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th,
and 20th centuries â€” the best
paintings of Matisse, Van Gogh,
Gainsborough, Picasso, Gauguin,
Titian, etc., and to reproduce <
them in full color as perfectly as
humanly possible and make them
available to the public at a price
within the reach of everyone. i
ABANDONED IN 1937
For some unknown reason,
after a quantity of these beautiful
reproductions were made, the en- !
tire project was abandoned and '
this collection of perfect repro- 1
ductions was stored in a Brooklyn |
warehouse, where they remained J
undisturbed since 1937.
The lost collection was "redis- t
covered" and leading lithograr '
phers and art critics agree that j
the subject matter and quality of t
detail and color reproduction is '
incredibly accurate. Over $500,- ;
000.00 had been spent to make i
engraved glass printing plates. {
These authentic orginal 1937 j
prints are literally collector's '
items and have been appraised by t
the American Appraisers Assoc.
at $7.00 each print. Once they
have been sold, there will be no
more available. A truly excellent
art "investment" that makes a
fabulous gift.

color 11" x 14" (ave. size) prints
are finally available to the public
at $19.95 for a collection of 18
