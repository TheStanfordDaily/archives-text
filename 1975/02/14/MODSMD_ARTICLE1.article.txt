# Alumna Nominated To Cabinet Post
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
President Ford yesterday
nominated Stanford alumna Carla
Anderson Hills, 41, to be secretary of
housing and urban development.
If confirmed by the Senate, Hills
would become only the third woman
cabinet member in U.S. history.
Hills has been assistant U.S.
attorney general in charge of the civil
division at the Department of Justice
since April, 1974.
White House Press Secretary Ron
Nessen denied that Hills' sex was a
factor in choosi'lg her for the
$60,000-a-year position. He said Hills
was the best person Ford could find
for the job.
However, Sen. William Proxmire
(D-Wis.), chairman of the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee, disagreed. "While Carla
A. Hills is obviously an able and
intelligent person, she has absolutely
no known qualifications, experience or
background to become secretary of
HUD," he said.
'Does Have Knowledge'
Nessen replied that Hills currently
heads a Justice Department task force
which prosecutes housing fraud cases
and "does have some knowledge of the
kind of problems she will face when
she goes to HUD."
But the U.S. Conference of Mayors
and the National League of Cities,
which jointly represent 15,000
municipalities across the country,
expressed shock at the nomination.
"It is inconceivable that the Ford
administration cannot find anyone
within the entire 50 states who has
experience and stature in the vast and
complicated area of urban affairs to be
named to such an important post,"
their joint statement said.
Hills, a Republican, graduated from
Stanford wiht a B.A.in history in

1955. During her four years here she
made the Dean's List and was captain
of the women's tennis team.
Hills unsuccessfully sought election
to the University Board of Trustees in
1972.
Succeeds Lynn
If confirmed, Hills will succeed
James T. Lynn, the new director of
the Office of Management and Budget.
Lynn retains his cabinet status as
budget director, succeeding Roy Ash.
Previous women cabinet members
were Frances Perkins, secretary of
labor under Franklin D. Roosevelt
from 1933 to 1945, and Oveya Culp
Hobby, secretary of welfare under
Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to
1955.
The Hills appointment is President
Ford's fourth to his cabinet.
Other Appointments
Ford also has appointed Attorney
General Edward Levi, succeeding
William B. Saxbe; John T. Dunlop to
become labor secretary, succeeding
Peter J. Brennan; and William T.
Coleman to be secretary of
transportation, succeeding Claude S.
Brinegar (also a Stanford alumnus).
Hills, who now lives in Washington,
D.C. with her husband and four
children, also studied at Oxford
University in the summer of 1954 and
received her law degree from Yale Law
School in 1958. She was 1964-65
president of the Women Lawyers
Association.
She is the co-author of Federal Civil
Practice and editor of Antitrust
Adviser.
From 1962 to 1974 sne was a
partner in the law firm of Munger,
Tolles, Hills & Rickershauser in Los
Angeles. During this same period she
taught at UCLA. Hills was an assistant
U.S. attorney in Los Angeles from
1959 to 1961.
During the fall of 1972, she was a
fundraising volunteer for the Quad
Fund Program, a branch of the
Stanford Annual Fund.
