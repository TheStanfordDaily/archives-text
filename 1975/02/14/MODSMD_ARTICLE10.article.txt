Editor:
It was with great surprise and unconcealed
relief that I encountered Glenn Garvin's
self-pitying goodbye (Daily, Feb. 12). Garvin
fails to understand the nature of criticism
directed against his vituperative columns,
criticism both voluminous and frequently
eloquent, especially concerning Billie Jean
King. The Daily audience — the Stanford
public — has endured his grating, opinionated
journalism long enough. As intelligent people
we deserve better.
My appreciation for the abilities of former
"Pro Prognosis" columnist Don Tollefson has
deepened. Hopefully Garvin's replacement as
sports columnist will have a more finely
tuned awareness of his public and a greater
desire to inform and entertain.
The sports section is an important,
perhaps the most valuable, presentation of
the Daily. The blight of Garvin's presence
will not be missed.

'Daily' Articles Err
Editor:
I would like to clarify two points printed

in the article "Dollies: Dancin' And Diggin'
It" (Daily, Feb. 12). First, the quote, "Move
those pelvic bones ..." is completely out of
context and misleading as printed in the
article. Girls trying out for Dolly were
instructed to move their pelvis in one part of
the dance they were learning because pelvic
movements were required for that part of the
dance to be effective.
Secondly, I'd like to point out a
misquote: "You see guys smiling and you
know what they are thinking. But any girl
dancer anywhere is doing the same thing.
And she knows it. And when a guy sees a girl
dance — whether she's a Dolly or not — he's
going to look at the same places." I did not
make these statements.
I am sure that these misquotes were not
intentional. 4 .

Editor:
The article about Monday's open grading
forum held at Tresidder (Daily, Feb. 11)
accurately described the only argument that
Associate Dean Mason Yearian made for the
proposed grading changes. It failed to reflect
Mason Yearian's skepticism toward the

rationale behind the recommendations of the
majority on the Ad Hoc Grading Panel.
The article did not report the student
rebuttals to Yearian's arguments. Students
established that University resources would
not be saved. Yearian conceded. He also
conceded to student arguments that student
irresponsibility would not be affected by a
grading change but by an improvement in the
advising system.
Students challenged Yearian's auditing
option as a viable alternative. Yearian
conceded that auditing limited participation
and allowed only a taste of classes.
The article failed to mention the
discussion of the trend in the University
toward greater authoritarianism and the
limiting of students' control of their own
education. It also completely neglected the
discussion of the benefits the present grading
system offers to less-prepared minority
students.
These statements illustrate that Yearian's
comments were taken out of the context of
the entire discussion. The forum was
intended to solicit student opinions and
those opinions were unreported.

Associate Dean Mason Yearian made for the
proposed grading changes. It failed to reflect
Mason Yearian's skepticism toward the

rationale behind the recommendations of the
majority on the Ad Hoc Grading Panel.
The article did not report the student
rebuttals to Yearian's arguments. Students
established that University resources would
not be saved. Yearian conceded. He also
conceded to student arguments that student
irresponsibility would not be affected by a
grading change but by an improvement in the
advising system.
Students challenged Yearian's auditing
option as a viable alternative. Yearian
conceded that auditing limited participation
and allowed only a taste of classes.
The article failed to mention the
discussion of the trend in the University
toward greater authoritarianism and the
limiting of students' control of their own
education. It also completely neglected the
discussion of the benefits the present grading
system offers to less-prepared minority
students.
These statements illustrate that Yearian's
comments were taken out of the context of
the entire discussion. The forum was
intended to solicit student opinions and
those opinions were unreported.

It was with great surprise and unconcealed
relief that I encountered Glenn Garvin's
self-pitying goodbye (Daily, Feb. 12). Garvin
fails to understand the nature of criticism
directed against his vituperative columns,
criticism both voluminous and frequently
eloquent, especially concerning Billie Jean
King. The Daily audience — the Stanford
public — has endured his grating, opinionated
journalism long enough. As intelligent people
we deserve better.
My appreciation for the abilities of former
"Pro Prognosis" columnist Don Tollefson has
deepened. Hopefully Garvin's replacement as
sports columnist will have a more finely
tuned awareness of his public and a greater
desire to inform and entertain.
The sports section is an important,
perhaps the most valuable, presentation of
the Daily. The blight of Garvin's presence
will not be missed.

I would like to clarify two points printed

in the article "Dollies: Dancin' And Diggin'
It" (Daily, Feb. 12). First, the quote, "Move
those pelvic bones ..." is completely out of
context and misleading as printed in the
article. Girls trying out for Dolly were
instructed to move their pelvis in one part of
the dance they were learning because pelvic
movements were required for that part of the
dance to be effective.
Secondly, I'd like to point out a
misquote: "You see guys smiling and you
know what they are thinking. But any girl
dancer anywhere is doing the same thing.
And she knows it. And when a guy sees a girl
dance — whether she's a Dolly or not — he's
going to look at the same places." I did not
make these statements.
I am sure that these misquotes were not
intentional. 4 .
