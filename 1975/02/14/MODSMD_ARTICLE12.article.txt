# The 						St. Valentine's Day Massacre
## 
### 
Today is St. Valentine's Day.
That may not mean much to you, but it
means something to me. Valentine's Day,
you see, is something like Thanksgiving, or
Christmas, or maybe April Fools' Day.
It isn't a good day to write a scathing
attack on Jerry Ford or University policies.
Nobody wants to read that stuff today.
Some people are in the lovey-dovey mood,
because they just opened valentines from
boyfriend or girlfriend (the valentine
counter in the Bookstore last Wednesday was
jammed, and all those cards must have gone
somewhere). How can I convince them that
Henry Kissinger is an idiot?
Others are angry because no one sent
them a valentine — you know, the Charlie
Brown syndrome. Will they really care
whether the International Chess Federation
has become so political it is now near
collapse?
What A Week . . .
Anyway, this hasn't been a week for
controversy. ■ Even the Daily columnists
seem to have eased off.
Rich Jaroslovsky's thrilling first-person
account of a meal at Denny's started off the
week just right. In that tradition, why should
I end the week on a sour note?
Even Glenn Garvin probably managed to
antagonize under two-thirds of his readers
this week. That excludes, needless to add, the
staff of the Chaparral.
Now, having read this far (and I assume
you have done so), you may be wondering
when I'm going to drop another bombshell.
Will I again confess to complicity in the
assassinations of the Kennedys?

Or perhaps, having finally seen what I
look like, you've decided not to read this
column anyway.
Frankly, the second alternative would suit
me, because, sadly enough, I have absolutely
nothing to write about. It has been such a
boring week that no story in the New York
Times has gotten more than a three-column
head on the front page.
The economy is only slightly worse than
last week, and in any case, I already
lambasted the President for that. Bobby
Fischer is still ruining chess, but I wrote
about that months ago.

On the other hand, this really isn't a high
school paper, appearances to the contrary.
Cheap Shots
I could make some comment about the
grading system or tenure or the "Gibbs
memo" or any of the other hopelessly
overplayed Daily stories of this week — but
the regular readership does a good enough
job of that.
Just think — I could have presented a

carefully reasoned analysis of the 1976
Presidential elections, or an argument for thi 1
repeal of the 25th Amendment. I could have
posed some great philosophical questions
(e.g., "What is the purpose of a
University?"), or some inconsequential trivial
ones (e.g., "Where is the cornerstone of
Stanford University located?").
Instead, I've bored half my readers, and
exacted oaths from the other half never to
read this column again.
I could have used this space to take on
God, as one of our columnists did last year,
or to assault the University for callousness, as
virtually everyone has done this year.
Instead, I have wasted this space on a
light, uncontroversial, conversational column,
pretty much in keeping with the style of the
week.
Happy Day, Ja
There are problems in trying to be
controversial and coherent week after week.
Even we regular columnists get tired, you
know, as you can undoubtedly tell from my
picture.
If you're still waiting for that bombshell,
you can turn to sports or something, maybe
look at Oliphant up above or the editorial to
the left. I mean, really, this column will have
no clever punch line, no subtle attack, no
hidden meaning, nothing.
So, before I go, let me leave you with a
brilliant or exceptionally witty ending.
Oops — never mind, I see I have no readers
left.
