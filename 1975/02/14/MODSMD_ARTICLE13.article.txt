# Why Lima Program Was Suspended

Some errors of fact and
confusion of interpretation have
arisen concerning the fate of the
overseas studies program in Lima,
Peru (Daily, Jan. 15). I would like
to set out the facts as the Overseas
Studies Office has them so that all
concerned with the Lima program
may share the same information.
Thirteen students enrolled in
the program and went to Lima, of
whom one withdrew almost
immediately for personal reasons.
Seven of the students were
enrolled for one quarter and three
for two quarters. Two of the
students did not specify the
number of quarters they intended
to remain in the program.
Four of the 12 students
have not returned to Stanford. Of
the eight remaining in Lima, two
are registered in the program for
the second quarter.
Student Activities
Clifford Barnett, professor of
anthropology and director of the
Stanford-in-Lima program, reports
that the six students who have

remained in Peru but are not
registered in the program this
winter quarter are engaged in the
following activities: one is
completing a study begun autumn
quarter; one is continuing studies
at the University of San Marcos
and completing a research project
developed during a previous visit
to Peru; one is working on an
archaeological dig with a professor
from La Catolica University; one
has taken a job in Peru; and two
will take most of the winter
quarter off for travel.
La Catolica University, upon
which the Lima program
depended for most of its course
instruction, was scheduled to
close its term on Jan. 16 for two
months of vacation. In early
December, however, political
conditions in Peru led to the
closing of universities for one
month. Consequently, the term
was extended, La Catolica has
now reopened, and Barnett
reports that eight students still in
Lima are completing, or have

completed, the courses in which
they were enrolled when the
shut-down took place.
Annual Costs
The costs of the Lima program,
when its first year ends at the
close of the present quarter, will
probably run in the neighborhood
of $30,000. Total University
income from students
participating in the program (i.e.,
tuition, room and board, and field
trip fees) amounts to $23,582.
Each individual student's
payments per quarter amount to
$1693, while the cost of the
program per student quarter will
be approximately $2143, or $450
per student quarter more than
income per student quarter.
As with many such decisions,
no single factor led to the
suspension of the Lima program;
rather, many factors influence us
in making that decision.
No member of the Stanford
faculty was available to serve as
director during academic year
1975-1976. The general
reexamination and revision of
Overseas Studies programs that
are forced upon us by the present
budgetary situation in the
University suggested that it would
be the better part of wisdom to
suspend the program next year in
order to allow the Committee on
Latin American Studies, the
Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs, and the staff of
Overseas Studies an opportunity
to evaluate the Lima program
before further commitments were
undertaken.
It is in this context that the
expenditure of General Funds in
the amount of approximately
$22,000 on the Lima program
became a factor. And last, but by
no means least, a thorough
evaluation of the academic
program in Lima, from the
perspective of both students ard
faculty, seems called for before
final decisions on an overseas
program in the Spanish-speaking
world are made.
Exploratory Year
The first year of any new, or
for that matter revised, overseas
program is necessarily exploratory
and experimental. From the point
of view of planning processes, it
generates the data necessary for
further consideration of the
program, its site, structure, and

content.
The analyses of the program by
the students participating in it,
and their criticisms, have been
remarkable for their constructive
approach. The Lima program
itself has been well served by
Barnett, as its first director. None
of this is to say that if those
conditions that are beyond our
control — budgetary constraints
and the Peruvian political
situation, for example — permit us
to continue the program,
important changes in the direction
of improvement cannot be made.
They can.
Barnett and the first group of
students made an important
beginning. The fact that eight of
the 12 students in the program
have remained in Peru proves the
value of the program to them.
Everything else being equal, we
should have been able to take the
program another step forward
next year.
The trouble is, as the
University is now finding out,
everything else is not always
equal.
