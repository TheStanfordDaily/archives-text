# Viable Idea On Frats
##

As a friend of mine would say,
this fraternity affair is out of
hand.
Bonny Rodden's analysis
(Daily, Feb. 7) claims that the
"University is still out to destroy
fraternities." I sure hope she's
wrong.
If we lose the frats, we lose a
group of the strongest residences
on campus. I've never met a frat
man who was ashamed of his
house or even reluctant to admit
his membership. They're proud of
their houses, and they maintain
enough program and spirit to
justify their pride. Good for them.
The latest proposal by the
COSS is a mess. I came into this
issue last winter when Larry
Horton asked the residence staff
for opinions on the Alpha Sig
proposal. The key issue in that
proposal was sexual
discrimination: men can find
housing through "subjective
selectivity" and women can't.
A year later, the new proposal
hasn't solved that problem. As
near as I can tell, women still
must go through the draw to get
on-campus housing, and men still
can rush. The only new twist in
the COSS proposal is the idea that
the frats should assume their share
of the responsibility for the
housing shortage.
That sounds like a good idea,
but there's a better way to
implement the principle.
Sometime in the last year (Daily,
Sept. 30, 1974), columnist John
Freed came up with the idea of
putting the frats in the draw, but
giving them the use of a priority
list. In practical language, each
frat would complete a list of
prospective members during rush
and give it tothe draw computer for
processing.
The hopefuls would draw with
the rest of the University. The
computer would assign those men
whose number fell above the
cut-off point, taking them in the
order of the list submitted by the
frat president.
Imagine the situation. Say a
frat submits 24 names. Say 16 get
in. Now, if the frat wants to
establish an off-campus annex, it
can do so. But it's not mandatory,
as it is under the COSS proposal.
To handle the rest of the
housing problem, the University
opens up a proportionate number
of women's spaces to the same
priority list system used by the
frats. So no one's getting shafted
on account of their sex.
I like the proposal. It restores
sexual equality. It combines
"subjective selectivity" — which, I
agree, is important to the frat
residence-style — with the
impartiality of the draw. And it's
a system that we can use in the
distant, mythic future, when the
housing shortage magically
disappears.
Only fools are out to get the
frats. Let's try to preserve the
frats and the whole residence
system.
