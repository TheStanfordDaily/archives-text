# Financial Aids Decision-Grounds For Objection
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
A Faculty Senate committee has decided
that it is time the University stop using ethnic
criterion as a basis for financial aid, a position
that undoubtedly incenses minority students
here.
And who can blame them? The Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid (CUAFA) report seems to reflect the
general attitude expressed by Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs in his
controversial November memo.
Though it's difficult to determine the
effect this new aid package will have on the
"minority mix" here, a few fundamental
changes are inevitable.
Native Americans, blacks and chicanos
from very low-income families, who have not
had to provide any self-help their first year,
will now be required to provide $450.
Ways To Pay
The amount could be covered by money
either earned while at school or by long-term,
low-interest loans. These loans require no
interest until after graduation at which point
it is only three percent.
All low-income category students will be
treated equally, regardless of their race. This
group of students consists of those whose
parents (in a three-child family) have a net
income of about $9070.
Those minority students in the
middle-income range will be given slight
preferential treatment, having to provide
about 84 percent of the self-help expected of
a non-minority student.
'Inducement To Middle-Income'
The report states, "This modification is
viewed as an inducement, in parallel with the
reduced self-help expectation applied to other
groups of students (e.g. unusually highly
qualified academically) the University is
anxious to enroll."
Previously, all minority students with
financial need were not required to provide
any self-help, regardless of the extent of their
need.

Under the new plan, a low-income
minority student will have a self-help
expectation of $450. A middle-income
minority student would have a maximum
expectation of $800 his first year,
incrementing to $1100 by the time he's a
senior.
Lessening Commitment
At any rate, it seems clear that the
University is lessening its commitment to
minorities, no matter how much its
administrators claim the contrary.
In fact, the only group of minority
students which is receiving any preferential
treatment is that group whose parents are in
the middle-income range, the group that
Gibbs seems intent on attracting.
Is preferential treatment of minority
students justified? This is the controversial
issue with which the committee had to deal.
The affirmative answer, given by most
minority students, is supported primarily by
the arguments that the culture shock of
coming to Stanford as a minority is a
hindrance which non-minority students in
general do not suffer.
Lower-Paying Jobs
Also, non-white students claim that
minority Stanford graduates receive
lower-paying jobs than non-minority
graduates.
The former argument notes that minority
students need more time for studies because
they often come here less prepared for classes
which, added to the culture shock, puts them
at a disadvantage.
Regarding the latter argument, minority
members claim repaying a three percent loan
after college puts an unfair burden on
minorities because they are not paid as well as
whites after graduation.
But these arguments apparently did not
convince the committee. It appears that the
committee considers individuals more similar
within an income group than within an ethnic
group.

anxious to enroll."
Previously, all minority students with
financial need were not required to provide
any self-help, regardless of the extent of their
need.

Under the new plan, a low-income
minority student will have a self-help
expectation of $450. A middle-income
minority student would have a maximum
expectation of $800 his first year,
incrementing to $1100 by the time he's a
senior.
Lessening Commitment
At any rate, it seems clear that the
University is lessening its commitment to
minorities, no matter how much its
administrators claim the contrary.
In fact, the only group of minority
students which is receiving any preferential
treatment is that group whose parents are in
the middle-income range, the group that
Gibbs seems intent on attracting.
Is preferential treatment of minority
students justified? This is the controversial
issue with which the committee had to deal.
The affirmative answer, given by most
minority students, is supported primarily by
the arguments that the culture shock of
coming to Stanford as a minority is a
hindrance which non-minority students in
general do not suffer.
Lower-Paying Jobs
Also, non-white students claim that
minority Stanford graduates receive
lower-paying jobs than non-minority
graduates.
The former argument notes that minority
students need more time for studies because
they often come here less prepared for classes
which, added to the culture shock, puts them
at a disadvantage.
Regarding the latter argument, minority
members claim repaying a three percent loan
after college puts an unfair burden on
minorities because they are not paid as well as
whites after graduation.
But these arguments apparently did not
convince the committee. It appears that the
committee considers individuals more similar
within an income group than within an ethnic
group.

A Faculty Senate committee has decided
that it is time the University stop using ethnic
criterion as a basis for financial aid, a position
that undoubtedly incenses minority students
here.
And who can blame them? The Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid (CUAFA) report seems to reflect the
general attitude expressed by Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs in his
controversial November memo.
Though it's difficult to determine the
effect this new aid package will have on the
"minority mix" here, a few fundamental
changes are inevitable.
Native Americans, blacks and chicanos
from very low-income families, who have not
had to provide any self-help their first year,
will now be required to provide $450.
Ways To Pay
The amount could be covered by money
either earned while at school or by long-term,
low-interest loans. These loans require no
interest until after graduation at which point
it is only three percent.
All low-income category students will be
treated equally, regardless of their race. This
group of students consists of those whose
parents (in a three-child family) have a net
income of about $9070.
Those minority students in the
middle-income range will be given slight
preferential treatment, having to provide
about 84 percent of the self-help expected of
a non-minority student.
'Inducement To Middle-Income'
The report states, "This modification is
viewed as an inducement, in parallel with the
reduced self-help expectation applied to other
groups of students (e.g. unusually highly
qualified academically) the University is
anxious to enroll."
