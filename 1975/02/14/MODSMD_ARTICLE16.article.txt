# Permanent Financial Manager Advocates
## Candid Or Secretive Tactic? 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Advocates of a system which would give
the ASSU a full-time ASSU financial manager
have two tactics at their disposal.
First, they can systematically and logically
attempt to convince the ASSU Senate that the
ASSU needs a full-time financial manager.
Second, they can attempt to hire such a
manager with the minimum amount of
discussion, with or without Senate consent.
So far, the advocates — led by ASSU
President Mike Herman, Financial Manager
Frank Olivieri, and Sens. Tim Conway and
Kevin McDermott — have been using the
second method.
This tactic hasn't worked, has angered
many Senators, and could lead to an ASSU
Constitutional crisis if carried to its logical
extreme.
Political Games
Should the ASSU Student Financial
Manager Selection Committee hire a

non-student without Senate consent, some
Senators would hold that the move was illegal.
Until all the constitutional questions were
resolved, the ASSU would have a
financial-manager-in-limbo.
Realizing this, the Selection Committee
went before the Senate Wednesday night to
ask for a vote of confidence. Unfortunately
for them, the effort was completely botched.
Instead of offering a written presentation,
the advocates used a ram-it-through strategy.
Sen. Tim Conway offered a resolution that
the ASSU urge the hiring of a full-time
manager and immediately called the question.
Send Committee Swimming?
A move to take the Selection Committee
and throw it en masse in Lake Lag would have
gotten more votes than that proposal.
After all the parliamentary maneuvering
was over, the Senate set up a special
committee to determine whether or not to
hire a financial manager and if so, to draft a
constitutional amendment for ratificiation by
the student body.
The committee is made up of two
advocates of a full-time manager —
McDermott and Conway — two persons
initially opposed to the idea — Charlotte
Germane and David Harris — and one
theoretically neutral Senate Chairman, Lee
Rosen baum.
Whether or not the committee, or the
Senate as a whole, has any power to block the
appointment of a full-time financial manager
is unknown. But Herman & Co. know they
can't afford to anger the Senators any more —
lest full-scale war break out.
Which brings them back to tactic number
one, logical persuasion. Olivieri has orally
presented some fairly convincing arguments
for hiring a full-time financial manager right
now.
Only such a person, he says, can negotiate
funding with the University and determine
whether it is feasible for the ASSU to take
over Tresidder Food Service.
That doesn't mean hiring a full-time
manager would lead to a takeover of
Tresidder. It just means that this proposition
would be studied by a full-time employee who
presumably has the know-how to make a
sophisticated analysis.
'Con' Arguments
The arguments against a full-time manager
are first, that the ASSU can't afford it, and

second, that the students don't possess
adequate constitutional safeguards against
abuse of power by a full-time manager.
This second "con" argument, at least, is
easily soluble. All it takes is a carefully
worded constitutional amendment limiting
the full-time manager's power without unduly
tying his hands.
But this takes negotiation. And so far, the
proponents have appeared to many Senators
as more interested in getting their way than
discussing the issues.
If the tactics don't change soon, Messrs.
Herman, Olivieri, McDermott and Conway
may not get anything.
