# Injunction Denial Hinders Suit
## Parking Fee Opponents Confront Uphill Battle 
### KATHY BATTS 
The ASSU's lawsuit against the University
suffered a setback last Friday.
Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge
Paul T. Gallagher denied students a
preliminary injunction to prevent campus
police from ticketing student vehicles without
University parking stickers.
The injunction was the first in a series of
steps taken against the University in an
attempt to force a repeal of the controversial
on-campus parking policy, centered around
the $T. 50 parking stickers.
The ASSU will not give up, however, it
seems. The students still plan to pursue a
permanent injunction and declatory relief.
Escondido Village Council President Cathy
Colson, one of the plaintiffs named in the
suit, said, "We are trying to get it back into
court as soon as possible." (Other plaintiffs
are the ASSU and business student Tom Dery,
an Escondido Village resident.)
Another Suit
In addition, another student has filed a
similar but separate parking suit against the
University, with a court date set for Feb. 24.
Colson's suit raises some serious
constitutional questions dealing with the
legality of the University's right to set parking
regulations. The suit argues that this is "an
improper delegation of legislative power to a
private university."

However the University contends that they
are within their rights of regulating parking on
their own property. As University attorney
David Heilbron put it: "It's actually
concerning the right to park your car on
somebody else's property free for a year."
The suit further alleges that the fee is
comparable to a tax which is delegated
unfairly, since faculty and staff receive their
parking stickers free.
Colson says the rationale behind the price
of the stickers is ridiculous.
"There's no way that each student should
have to pay $7.50 for a parking sticker. No
way. Now, we can see maybe a dollar or two
for administrative costs if the University just
wanted to register student vehicles for
identification purposes. But $7.50 for two
quarters is ridiculous!
"And what's going to happen next year?
There's a parking study going on right now,
and next fall's policy may be based on the
results of that study. In the past, parking
studies have always recommended an increase
in the parking fee.
"Suggested fees have been as high as $40 a
year. (And some schools charge that much.)
But I don't think students can afford
something like that."
The possibility of a rising parking fee is
formidable. And if the University is allowed
to go ahead with the fee, the friction between
students and administrators is going to
become more intense.
Then again, this study might be different
and suggest any number of other viable
alternatives: parking meters, a price regulated
system, first-come-first-serve, or maybe no
parking or driving within the campus at all.
But none of the choices sounds perfect.
Foreboding Defendants
The list of defendants in the case is
impressive, or maybe foreboding: President
Richard Lyman, the University Board of
Trustees, Santa Clara County Sheriff James B.
Geary, and the county Board of Supervisors.
Lawsuits can be painful. Already Lyman
has said he would find it harder to cooperate
with the ASSU since they are opposing the
University in court.
But some pains are necessary — like
growing pains. And after losing the first
round, it appears that the ASSU is going to
have to do some growing, if it is to wage a
decent battle with a giant.

Another Suit
In addition, another student has filed a
similar but separate parking suit against the
University, with a court date set for Feb. 24.
Colson's suit raises some serious
constitutional questions dealing with the
legality of the University's right to set parking
regulations. The suit argues that this is "an
improper delegation of legislative power to a
private university."

However the University contends that they
are within their rights of regulating parking on
their own property. As University attorney
David Heilbron put it: "It's actually
concerning the right to park your car on
somebody else's property free for a year."
The suit further alleges that the fee is
comparable to a tax which is delegated
unfairly, since faculty and staff receive their
parking stickers free.
Colson says the rationale behind the price
of the stickers is ridiculous.
"There's no way that each student should
have to pay $7.50 for a parking sticker. No
way. Now, we can see maybe a dollar or two
for administrative costs if the University just
wanted to register student vehicles for
identification purposes. But $7.50 for two
quarters is ridiculous!
"And what's going to happen next year?
There's a parking study going on right now,
and next fall's policy may be based on the
results of that study. In the past, parking
studies have always recommended an increase
in the parking fee.
"Suggested fees have been as high as $40 a
year. (And some schools charge that much.)
But I don't think students can afford
something like that."
The possibility of a rising parking fee is
formidable. And if the University is allowed
to go ahead with the fee, the friction between
students and administrators is going to
become more intense.
Then again, this study might be different
and suggest any number of other viable
alternatives: parking meters, a price regulated
system, first-come-first-serve, or maybe no
parking or driving within the campus at all.
But none of the choices sounds perfect.
Foreboding Defendants
The list of defendants in the case is
impressive, or maybe foreboding: President
Richard Lyman, the University Board of
Trustees, Santa Clara County Sheriff James B.
Geary, and the county Board of Supervisors.
Lawsuits can be painful. Already Lyman
has said he would find it harder to cooperate
with the ASSU since they are opposing the
University in court.
But some pains are necessary — like
growing pains. And after losing the first
round, it appears that the ASSU is going to
have to do some growing, if it is to wage a
decent battle with a giant.

The ASSU's lawsuit against the University
suffered a setback last Friday.
Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge
Paul T. Gallagher denied students a
preliminary injunction to prevent campus
police from ticketing student vehicles without
University parking stickers.
The injunction was the first in a series of
steps taken against the University in an
attempt to force a repeal of the controversial
on-campus parking policy, centered around
the $T. 50 parking stickers.
The ASSU will not give up, however, it
seems. The students still plan to pursue a
permanent injunction and declatory relief.
Escondido Village Council President Cathy
Colson, one of the plaintiffs named in the
suit, said, "We are trying to get it back into
court as soon as possible." (Other plaintiffs
are the ASSU and business student Tom Dery,
an Escondido Village resident.)
