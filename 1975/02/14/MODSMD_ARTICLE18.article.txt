# Politics Could Underlie University/Iran Broadcast Project

### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The controversial contract between the
University and National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT) appears on the surface to
be a laudable contribution to the development
of Iran. But a closer look reveals that it may
have political implications beyond education
and communication in Iran.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce Lusignan
said that his class will review the available
technology and make recommendations for
both the hardware and the social service
applications of the proposed domestic
communications satellite.
This professional guidance is necessary
because "the technical expertise of the
suppliers is overwhelming relative to that of
the buyers," Lusignan explained. Lusignan

and Prof. Edwin Barker of the Institute for
Communications Research are both advisors
to the state on communications policy.
The Shah of Iran has proposed this system
as part of his plan to decrease the agricultural
population of Iran and build an industrial,
urban economy.
Yet 70 percent of Iran's 3.5 million people
are illiterate.
Wealth Distributed Unevenly
Although Iran has the highest per capita
income of the Arab states, $1,000, this figure
reflects oil revenues which are not distributed
evenly. In Teheren, two-thirds of the families
have incomes lower than $200 per year, and
the rural population does not fare much
better.
Until now, the Shah has used most of his

'petro-capital" to develop military
technology. He paid $5 billion to the U.S. for
arms in 1974, and has made a multi-billion
contract with the Pentagon this year.
So, this attention to providing education
and health information to the large mass of
rural Iranians should be a welcome change in
priorities.
Dissenting Faction
But a growing faction of faculty and
students have been raising objections to
Stanford's involvement in the NIRT contract,
protesting both the academic merit and the
political implications of the project.
Members of the Research Advisory
Committee of the Institute for
Communications Research recommended that

Parker not accept an advisory role in the
project.
The committee's main objections were
political. "After careful review of this contract,
the project described emerged as little more
than technical assistance and transfer
inextricably tied to the expansionist
marketing goals of U.S. imperialism," Gandy
concluded.
Professors Martin Carnoy and Henry Levin
in the School of Education have produced
several articles criticizing the indiscriminate
development of communication technology in
developing countries.
Network Attracts Authoritarians
They suggest that a centralized
communication network, limits the type of

education available to rural students. Because
it provides better control over information,
"such centrally controlled education systems
are particularly appealing to authoritarian
societies," Levin and Carnoy wrote.
The Alliance for Radical Change (ARC) has
protested that the Shah is likely to use this
new technology to tighten the already
extensive surveillance system in Iran. A group
of Iranian students here, who wish to remain
anonymous because they fear reprisals from
their country, agree.
Perhaps the possible uses of this
technology should be considered before
Stanford helps provide a potentially repressive
tool to a dictator, who was put in power by
the CIA.

So, this attention to providing education
and health information to the large mass of
rural Iranians should be a welcome change in
priorities.
Dissenting Faction
But a growing faction of faculty and
students have been raising objections to
Stanford's involvement in the NIRT contract,
protesting both the academic merit and the
political implications of the project.
Members of the Research Advisory
Committee of the Institute for
Communications Research recommended that

Parker not accept an advisory role in the
project.
The committee's main objections were
political. "After careful review of this contract,
the project described emerged as little more
than technical assistance and transfer
inextricably tied to the expansionist
marketing goals of U.S. imperialism," Gandy
concluded.
Professors Martin Carnoy and Henry Levin
in the School of Education have produced
several articles criticizing the indiscriminate
development of communication technology in
developing countries.
Network Attracts Authoritarians
They suggest that a centralized
communication network, limits the type of

education available to rural students. Because
it provides better control over information,
"such centrally controlled education systems
are particularly appealing to authoritarian
societies," Levin and Carnoy wrote.
The Alliance for Radical Change (ARC) has
protested that the Shah is likely to use this
new technology to tighten the already
extensive surveillance system in Iran. A group
of Iranian students here, who wish to remain
anonymous because they fear reprisals from
their country, agree.
Perhaps the possible uses of this
technology should be considered before
Stanford helps provide a potentially repressive
tool to a dictator, who was put in power by
the CIA.
The controversial contract between the
University and National Iranian Radio and
Television (NIRT) appears on the surface to
be a laudable contribution to the development
of Iran. But a closer look reveals that it may
have political implications beyond education
and communication in Iran.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce Lusignan
said that his class will review the available
technology and make recommendations for
both the hardware and the social service
applications of the proposed domestic
communications satellite.
This professional guidance is necessary
because "the technical expertise of the
suppliers is overwhelming relative to that of
the buyers," Lusignan explained. Lusignan

and Prof. Edwin Barker of the Institute for
Communications Research are both advisors
to the state on communications policy.
The Shah of Iran has proposed this system
as part of his plan to decrease the agricultural
population of Iran and build an industrial,
urban economy.
Yet 70 percent of Iran's 3.5 million people
are illiterate.
Wealth Distributed Unevenly
Although Iran has the highest per capita
income of the Arab states, $1,000, this figure
reflects oil revenues which are not distributed
evenly. In Teheren, two-thirds of the families
have incomes lower than $200 per year, and
the rural population does not fare much
better.
Until now, the Shah has used most of his

'petro-capital" to develop military
technology. He paid $5 billion to the U.S. for
arms in 1974, and has made a multi-billion
contract with the Pentagon this year.
So, this attention to providing education
and health information to the large mass of
rural Iranians should be a welcome change in
priorities.
