# NO 'DAILY' MONDAY
## 
### 
Due to the celebration of George
Washington's birthday, the Daily
will not be published on Monday.
We will resume publication on
Tuesday.
Deadline for Tuesday's Once
Around the Quad section will be
this morning at 9 a.m.
The Daily staff â€” at least some
minute fragment of it - wishes you
a happy Valentine's Day and an
equally happy Washington's
Birthday.
