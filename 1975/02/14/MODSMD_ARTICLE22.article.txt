# Program Lets Students Research Beside Profs
## 
### ELIZABETH POLLOCK 
Have you ever considered
doing research alongside your
favorite professor or teaching
assistant?
A new Undergraduate Specials
program allows students to do just
that. This quarter about 100-150
students are taking advantage of
the new program and are working
with 110 faculty members,
according to Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies B. Michael
Closson.
Andy Willard, an anthropology
major, worked with Anthropology
Prof. Ezra Zubrow collecting and
cataloguing data from an
excavation in Guanajuato,
Mexico. He also helped edit a
book of essays written about the
project.
Freshman Catherine Drury
does library research on
engineering topics for Applied
Earth Sciences Prof. Robert
Anderson. "It's really great," she
maintains. "It's given me insight
into what professors really do."
Drury puts in about six hours a
week, receiving credit for the first
three and pay for time thereafter.
Work For Credit
Most students do research in
exchange for credit rather than
money, but for Rory Jaffe it's
worth it. "1 have some ideas of
my own, and I want to follow
them up," he said.
Jaffe spoke to Dermatology
Prof. Martin Karasek at the
Medical Center, and although his
positions were filled, Karasek
agreed to sponsor Jaffe's work.
Currently, Jaffe is doing
background reading for an
experiment on fibroblasts that he
will design and perform.
Closson remarked that the
biology faculty had not wanted to
participate in the program because
they have their own student
research plans.
Liberal Arts Emphasis
He went on to explain that the
program is primarily directed toward
expansion of research
opportunities in liberal arts fields.

I've talked to |in the Chemistry
Department] say, 'Well, if you get
interested in something, just come
talk to us.' " Lanman says, 'There
are gobs of people working on
stuff," and getting a research spot
is simple if you're qualified
enough.
General To Technical
Projects range from highly
technical experiments at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and the Medical
Center to library and survey
projects which ask only for
enthusiasm and interest.
Sophomore Margie Hoag, a
human biology major, is getting
paid for two months of training
for a project in the Sociology
Department.
Prof. Bernard Cohen, who will
direct Hoag's research, says the
program is, "an opportunity for
undergraduates to become
involved with ongoing research."
He emphasized that he will
implement the date gathered by
trainees about research group
interaction.
Hoag mentioned that the
research experience can be helpful
when it comes time to apply for a
permanent job. She said
recommendations from
well-known researchers can
impress prospective employers.
Also research work provides
perspective on the field involved.
Enthusiastic Response
Faculty response to the
undergraduate research program
has been enthusiastic.
Education Prof. Carl Thoreson
believes that "undergraduates
underrate the kind of
contribution they can make and
don't tend to perceive themselves
as having much to offer."
Jonathan Lew has worked with
Thoreson's research assistant,
Tom Coates. He surveyed students
in his dorm regarding sleep
disorders. His study has now been
adopted for use in the Palo Alto
schools.
Lew sees his work as important i

"There is a longer tradition of
collaborative research in the
sciences," he remarked.
Sophomore Rick Lanman
hasn't time for research this year,
but he said, "All the professors

and feels he is an active member
of the research team. He gets a
chance to sit in on research
meetings and to watch interviews
with clients.
Karasek maintains the research

is "a two way process."
"Undergraduates bring in a
different kind of experience and
enthusiasm than other students.
They are remarkably perceptive
and bright."
"I see a real increased
need for this kind of thing,
especially now that the faculty is
under pressure to spend more
time on research," Closson said.
"It makes sense to bring the
students to the faculty." This
fits right in with their time
commitments," he continued.
Zubrow feels that
"undergraduates are not as well
prepared as graduates, but they
are willing to take chances.
They're not embarrassed to say,
'Hey, I have a crazy idea.' They're
much more willing to do a wide
variety of things on their own."

project.
Freshman Catherine Drury
does library research on
engineering topics for Applied
Earth Sciences Prof. Robert
Anderson. "It's really great," she
maintains. "It's given me insight
into what professors really do."
Drury puts in about six hours a
week, receiving credit for the first
three and pay for time thereafter.
Work For Credit
Most students do research in
exchange for credit rather than
money, but for Rory Jaffe it's
worth it. "1 have some ideas of
my own, and I want to follow
them up," he said.
Jaffe spoke to Dermatology
Prof. Martin Karasek at the
Medical Center, and although his
positions were filled, Karasek
agreed to sponsor Jaffe's work.
Currently, Jaffe is doing
background reading for an
experiment on fibroblasts that he
will design and perform.
Closson remarked that the
biology faculty had not wanted to
participate in the program because
they have their own student
research plans.
Liberal Arts Emphasis
He went on to explain that the
program is primarily directed toward
expansion of research
opportunities in liberal arts fields.

I've talked to |in the Chemistry
Department] say, 'Well, if you get
interested in something, just come
talk to us.' " Lanman says, 'There
are gobs of people working on
stuff," and getting a research spot
is simple if you're qualified
enough.
General To Technical
Projects range from highly
technical experiments at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and the Medical
Center to library and survey
projects which ask only for
enthusiasm and interest.
Sophomore Margie Hoag, a
human biology major, is getting
paid for two months of training
for a project in the Sociology
Department.
Prof. Bernard Cohen, who will
direct Hoag's research, says the
program is, "an opportunity for
undergraduates to become
involved with ongoing research."
He emphasized that he will
implement the date gathered by
trainees about research group
interaction.
Hoag mentioned that the
research experience can be helpful
when it comes time to apply for a
permanent job. She said
recommendations from
well-known researchers can
impress prospective employers.
Also research work provides
perspective on the field involved.
Enthusiastic Response
Faculty response to the
undergraduate research program
has been enthusiastic.
Education Prof. Carl Thoreson
believes that "undergraduates
underrate the kind of
contribution they can make and
don't tend to perceive themselves
as having much to offer."
Jonathan Lew has worked with
Thoreson's research assistant,
Tom Coates. He surveyed students
in his dorm regarding sleep
disorders. His study has now been
adopted for use in the Palo Alto
schools.
Lew sees his work as important i

"There is a longer tradition of
collaborative research in the
sciences," he remarked.
Sophomore Rick Lanman
hasn't time for research this year,
but he said, "All the professors

and feels he is an active member
of the research team. He gets a
chance to sit in on research
meetings and to watch interviews
with clients.
Karasek maintains the research

is "a two way process."
"Undergraduates bring in a
different kind of experience and
enthusiasm than other students.
They are remarkably perceptive
and bright."
"I see a real increased
need for this kind of thing,
especially now that the faculty is
under pressure to spend more
time on research," Closson said.
"It makes sense to bring the
students to the faculty." This
fits right in with their time
commitments," he continued.
Zubrow feels that
"undergraduates are not as well
prepared as graduates, but they
are willing to take chances.
They're not embarrassed to say,
'Hey, I have a crazy idea.' They're
much more willing to do a wide
variety of things on their own."
Have you ever considered
doing research alongside your
favorite professor or teaching
assistant?
A new Undergraduate Specials
program allows students to do just
that. This quarter about 100-150
students are taking advantage of
the new program and are working
with 110 faculty members,
according to Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies B. Michael
Closson.

major, worked with Anthropology
Prof. Ezra Zubrow collecting and
cataloguing data from an
excavation in Guanajuato,
Mexico. He also helped edit a
book of essays written about the
project.
