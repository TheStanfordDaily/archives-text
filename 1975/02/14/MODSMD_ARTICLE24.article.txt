# Why Is Meyer Always So Hot?
## 
### PATRICIA CLAPPISON 
Complaints about temperatures
in University buildings,
particularly Meyer Undergraduate
Library, have been plentiful,
Director of Plant Services Jason
Mavis confirmed recently.
He explained that a 68-degree
maximum is supposed to be
maintained in all buildings.
However, in some structures, such
as research buildings, exceptions
are made because specific
temperatures are critical to
scientific experiments.
Mavis also stated that
temperatures can alter from the
68-degree limit in libraries where
extreme temperatures could
deteriorate books. Steam pipes
convey the heat in most buildings,
Javis said. The heat is generally
turned on each morning and off
every night so temperatures can
vary as much as 15 degrees.
For those who like it warm
while studying, the Daily found
the south side and

fourth floor of Meyer to be one of
the warmest areas on campus with
a temperature of 78 degrees the
afternoon the study was
conducted.
The second floor, the north
side and places near the windows
are coolest. No buildings were
measured at less than 70 degrees
in the afternoon.
President Richard Lyman's
office in Building 10 is located
directly above the steam pipes,
causing it to be a victim of
unintentional heating. But
nonetheless, a sign under the
thermostat requests the
temperature be maintained at 70
degrees.
Tresidder Memorial Union was
measured at 75 degrees, the
English department at 70, and the
French department at 76 degrees.
The Plant Services building had
the lowest thermometer reading;
it was set at 68.
Mavis and utilities manager
Robert McKnight said that the

basic heating system was installed
in 1890. Although it is
continually being renovated, most
of the system was designed
without energy crisis planning.
They said that the University's
energy consumption has decreased
18.7 percent from last year, but
the cost has increased by 24
percent. They expect energy costs
to double by next year.
