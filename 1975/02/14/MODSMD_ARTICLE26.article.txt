# Financial Aid Jobs Allotted 'Fairly'
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Although freshmen are given
first priority for some jobs, the
University's Financial Aids Office
maintains that most jobs are
awarded on a first-come,
first-serve basis.
Priority is given to freshmen
securing work solely in the central
library system and in hashing
positions autumn and winter
quarters.
This policy was enacted
because freshmen on financial aid
don't have a chance to look for
employment the previous year, as
do most students, according to
Asst. Director of Financial Aids
Lynne Mason.
Autumn quarter, those
freshmen with sizeable job grants
are given first priority while those
with smaller grants are given
priority for any openings that
appear winter quarter.
Mason stated that with all
other jobs, preference is given to
the first applicants.
The Daily has recently heard
complaints that upperclassmen are
being given less priority than
freshmen in securing jobs â€” in
fact, that many students are
without jobs. Mason denied these
claims, stating that everyone who
has been searching for a position
has been placed. "There have been
enough jobs," Mason emphasized.
"To my knowledge, no one is
waiting for a job."
When one receives a financial
aids job, he is placed on a waiting
list and must make efforts to
secure a position on campus.
If the job seeker makes a
"diligent effort" but with no
success, then the University grants
him another form of aid for the
amount of his job commitment

(usually $600 to $700), Mavis said.
A "diligent effort" consists of
"coming back (to the Financial
Aids Office) several times and
making a real effort to locate a
job," Mason said.
"If they just can't finel
anything, that part is made up to
them in loan aid," she continued.
"But this hasn't happened,
because there are enough jobs on
campus."
