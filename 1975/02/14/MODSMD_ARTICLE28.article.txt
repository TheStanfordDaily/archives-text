Bob Dylan
Blood on the Tracks Aifk-k-k
Columbia PC 33235
Even the most fanatic Dylan
devotees had to wonder when his
live recording, Before the Flood.
came out last year: was this a
tone-deaf imposter who was
screeching songs like "All Along
the Watchtower" and "Blowin* in
the Wind," or was it the man who
wrote them?
Happily, those who doubted
that Dylan would ever write another
good song may now put their
fears to rest. After five dismal,
disappointing years, Bob Dylan is
back.
Blood on the Tracks, his
new release, reveals above all a
mature Bob Dylan. The
sometimes forced anger and the
edginess of his earlier works have
disappeared, replaced by a more
gentle feeling that makes the new
songs, if anything, more moving
than the old.
The masterpiece of Blood, a
seven-minute ballad called "Lily,
Rosemary, and the Jack of
Hearts," ranks among the great
songwriter's very best
compositions.
Puckish Jack
A wry tale about some very
confused girls and gamblers — all
except the puckish Jack of Hearts
— "Lily" brings a warmth and
color that has been missing from
Dylan's work since he painted a
self-portrait with a blue nose, and
evidently started to take it
seriously.
Dylan's voice, too, seems to
have mellowed almost overnight —
his singing isn't as consciously
"country" as on his Nashville
Skyline album, but it's just as
smooth and listenable.

Dylan's performance of the
endearing "Shelter From the
Storm" should challenge the
often-expressed notion that he is
not a great singer; it's difficult to
believe that anyone else could
have made the song more striking.
Instrumentally, too, this record
forms a pleasant contrast to other
recent Dylan releases: gone is the
electric accompaniment of the
Band (despite their successes on
their own, the Band never
sounded right behind Dylan).
Instead, Eric Weissberg and
Deliverance (on the tracks
recorded in New York) and a
three-man backup band (on those
done in Minneapolis) provide a
usually acoustic and always
understated base that goes well
with what Dylan has to say.
And in the long run, it's what
Dylan has to say that makes this
record such a joy: for the first
time in recent memory, he seems
to have lost his obsession with
being a pop star — he always
looked uncomfortable in that
role.
The 10 songs on Blood on the
Tracks represent, instead, both a
long and fond look backwards and
an expression of optimism by the
man who was for many a symbol
of youthful rebellion in the
'60s. As such, Blood is a very
important statement.
Enchanted Vision
In "Tangled Up in Blue" we
encounter a much younger Dylan,
enchanted with the spirit of a
New York where "there was
music in the cafes at night and
revolution in the air" — a vision
too idealized to last, soon
disintegrating into staleness and
frustration.
There is Dylan's experience in

the "Idiot Wind," and his reaction
to the fools he must deal with: a
reaction not so much of rage as of
weariness.
Dylan the unsentim°ntal lover
appears as the subject of several
songs on Blood, and the new love
songs, like "Buckets of Rain" ard
"You're Goin' To Make Me
Lonesome When You Go," have a
refreshing beauty that is one of
the most compelling features of
the new album.
In the world of "Buckets of
Rain," no preconceptions or
grandiose plans are called for.
Friends will arrive.
Friends will disappear,
If you want me
Honey baby, I'll be here.
No apocalyptic messages
appear here or in the wistful "If
You See Her, Say Hello," but
their strength lies in Dylan's
affirmation of love — and of the
feeling that, if the overblown
expectations of the past went
unfulfilled, there is no reason to
mourn their passing.
Twist Of Fate
For me, though, the sparse
song "A Simple Twist of Fate"
best expresses the feeling created
by Blood on the Tracks. Captured
perfectly in this song are the
inseparable feelings of joy and
sadness at remembering a
wonderful chance occurrence that
will never be recreated.
What could be more a "twist of
fate" than the emergence of Bob
Dylan? The remarkable time when
he could win acclaim as a new
prophet for singing something as
simple and straight-forward as
"The Times, Thev AreA-Oiangin' "
won't occur again, and Dylan
seems well aware of that.
Perhaps it is better, then, that

Dylan is no longer expected to
produce gospel visions whenever
he writes a song, for he is too
good a songwriter to be treated as
a social commentator.
That Dylan's is one of the great
American lives of recent times is
undeniable. That he has drawn on
his rich experience in creating
Blood on the Tracks is a major
reason for the album's artistic
success.
That he is back is reason to
celebrate.

Joni Mitchell
Miles of A isles -kirk
Asylum AB 202
Lately Joni Mitchell has been
acclaimed as something of a
poetess for the '70s or a
culture hero for America's
sensitive young people. That,
undeniably, is a large bill to fill
for a frail-voiced singer with an
out-of-tune guitar.
This two-record set, recorded
live mostly in Los Angeles last
summer, is a collection of her
best-known songs in her, by now,
very familiar style.
At times this album works very
well indeed: side two, for
instance, opens with Joni,
accompanied by her own guitar,
singing a tender version of
"Cactus Tree." It's one of her best
recorded performances, a
beautiful song done in a very
personal style.
More Complexity
Then on to "Cold Blue Steel
and Sweet Fire," a complex tune
sung in a peaceful, suspended
style with Tom Scotl's soprano

saxophone swelling underneath.
Two more numbers, "Woman of
Heart and Mind" and "A Case of
You," show Joni's special way
with the folk idiom.
Closing the side, Joni plays
piano and sings a short but
haunting version of "Blue,"
proving once again what just
about everyone knows: "Blue" is
a remarkably good song.
Other selections, though, have
serious shortcomings, faults that
many listeners may find hard to
overlook. "All 1 Want" finds Joni
straining unsuccessfully to hit the
high notes, with a raucous
accompaniment making the song
difficult to take.
And when Joni invites the
crowd to sing "The Circle Game"
out of tune, sure enough, they
sing it out of tune. They know the
words, though: so does everyone,
and that brings to mind the
fundamental question about this
album: was it really necessary?
Old Repeats
Of the 18 songs in this set,
only two are new compositions:
Joni does nothing really
imaginative with the old material,
and the few old songs she does do
in revamped versions, with the
L.A. Express as backup band, are
usually uninteresting.
There is one other major
problem with this album: price.
An $11.98 list is far too expensive
for this collection, which is at best
a showcase for Joni Mitchell's
good but familiar songs.
There is no denying that Joni
Mitchell has made it as a powerful
performer and songwriter, but this
album represents more a pleasant
summing-up of her work so far
than an exposition of any new
musical directions she may be
taking.

Bob Dylan
Blood on the Tracks Aifk-k-k
Columbia PC 33235
Even the most fanatic Dylan
devotees had to wonder when his
live recording, Before the Flood.
came out last year: was this a
tone-deaf imposter who was
screeching songs like "All Along
the Watchtower" and "Blowin* in
the Wind," or was it the man who
wrote them?
Happily, those who doubted
that Dylan would ever write another
good song may now put their
fears to rest. After five dismal,
disappointing years, Bob Dylan is
back.
Blood on the Tracks, his
new release, reveals above all a
mature Bob Dylan. The
sometimes forced anger and the
edginess of his earlier works have
disappeared, replaced by a more
gentle feeling that makes the new
songs, if anything, more moving
than the old.
The masterpiece of Blood, a
seven-minute ballad called "Lily,
Rosemary, and the Jack of
Hearts," ranks among the great
songwriter's very best
compositions.
Puckish Jack
A wry tale about some very
confused girls and gamblers — all
except the puckish Jack of Hearts
— "Lily" brings a warmth and
color that has been missing from
Dylan's work since he painted a
self-portrait with a blue nose, and
evidently started to take it
seriously.
Dylan's voice, too, seems to
have mellowed almost overnight —
his singing isn't as consciously
"country" as on his Nashville
Skyline album, but it's just as
smooth and listenable.

Dylan's performance of the
endearing "Shelter From the
Storm" should challenge the
often-expressed notion that he is
not a great singer; it's difficult to
believe that anyone else could
have made the song more striking.
Instrumentally, too, this record
forms a pleasant contrast to other
recent Dylan releases: gone is the
electric accompaniment of the
Band (despite their successes on
their own, the Band never
sounded right behind Dylan).
Instead, Eric Weissberg and
Deliverance (on the tracks
recorded in New York) and a
three-man backup band (on those
done in Minneapolis) provide a
usually acoustic and always
understated base that goes well
with what Dylan has to say.
And in the long run, it's what
Dylan has to say that makes this
record such a joy: for the first
time in recent memory, he seems
to have lost his obsession with
being a pop star — he always
looked uncomfortable in that
role.
The 10 songs on Blood on the
Tracks represent, instead, both a
long and fond look backwards and
an expression of optimism by the
man who was for many a symbol
of youthful rebellion in the
'60s. As such, Blood is a very
important statement.
Enchanted Vision
In "Tangled Up in Blue" we
encounter a much younger Dylan,
enchanted with the spirit of a
New York where "there was
music in the cafes at night and
revolution in the air" — a vision
too idealized to last, soon
disintegrating into staleness and
frustration.
There is Dylan's experience in

the "Idiot Wind," and his reaction
to the fools he must deal with: a
reaction not so much of rage as of
weariness.
Dylan the unsentim°ntal lover
appears as the subject of several
songs on Blood, and the new love
songs, like "Buckets of Rain" ard
"You're Goin' To Make Me
Lonesome When You Go," have a
refreshing beauty that is one of
the most compelling features of
the new album.
In the world of "Buckets of
Rain," no preconceptions or
grandiose plans are called for.
Friends will arrive.
Friends will disappear,
If you want me
Honey baby, I'll be here.
No apocalyptic messages
appear here or in the wistful "If
You See Her, Say Hello," but
their strength lies in Dylan's
affirmation of love — and of the
feeling that, if the overblown
expectations of the past went
unfulfilled, there is no reason to
mourn their passing.
Twist Of Fate
For me, though, the sparse
song "A Simple Twist of Fate"
best expresses the feeling created
by Blood on the Tracks. Captured
perfectly in this song are the
inseparable feelings of joy and
sadness at remembering a
wonderful chance occurrence that
will never be recreated.
What could be more a "twist of
fate" than the emergence of Bob
Dylan? The remarkable time when
he could win acclaim as a new
prophet for singing something as
simple and straight-forward as
"The Times, Thev AreA-Oiangin' "
won't occur again, and Dylan
seems well aware of that.
Perhaps it is better, then, that

Dylan is no longer expected to
produce gospel visions whenever
he writes a song, for he is too
good a songwriter to be treated as
a social commentator.
That Dylan's is one of the great
American lives of recent times is
undeniable. That he has drawn on
his rich experience in creating
Blood on the Tracks is a major
reason for the album's artistic
success.
That he is back is reason to
celebrate.

Joni Mitchell
Miles of A isles -kirk
Asylum AB 202
Lately Joni Mitchell has been
acclaimed as something of a
poetess for the '70s or a
culture hero for America's
sensitive young people. That,
undeniably, is a large bill to fill
for a frail-voiced singer with an
out-of-tune guitar.
This two-record set, recorded
live mostly in Los Angeles last
summer, is a collection of her
best-known songs in her, by now,
very familiar style.
At times this album works very
well indeed: side two, for
instance, opens with Joni,
accompanied by her own guitar,
singing a tender version of
"Cactus Tree." It's one of her best
recorded performances, a
beautiful song done in a very
personal style.
More Complexity
Then on to "Cold Blue Steel
and Sweet Fire," a complex tune
sung in a peaceful, suspended
style with Tom Scotl's soprano

saxophone swelling underneath.
Two more numbers, "Woman of
Heart and Mind" and "A Case of
You," show Joni's special way
with the folk idiom.
Closing the side, Joni plays
piano and sings a short but
haunting version of "Blue,"
proving once again what just
about everyone knows: "Blue" is
a remarkably good song.
Other selections, though, have
serious shortcomings, faults that
many listeners may find hard to
overlook. "All 1 Want" finds Joni
straining unsuccessfully to hit the
high notes, with a raucous
accompaniment making the song
difficult to take.
And when Joni invites the
crowd to sing "The Circle Game"
out of tune, sure enough, they
sing it out of tune. They know the
words, though: so does everyone,
and that brings to mind the
fundamental question about this
album: was it really necessary?
Old Repeats
Of the 18 songs in this set,
only two are new compositions:
Joni does nothing really
imaginative with the old material,
and the few old songs she does do
in revamped versions, with the
L.A. Express as backup band, are
usually uninteresting.
There is one other major
problem with this album: price.
An $11.98 list is far too expensive
for this collection, which is at best
a showcase for Joni Mitchell's
good but familiar songs.
There is no denying that Joni
Mitchell has made it as a powerful
performer and songwriter, but this
album represents more a pleasant
summing-up of her work so far
than an exposition of any new
musical directions she may be
taking.

Old Repeats
Of the 18 songs in this set,
only two are new compositions:
Joni does nothing really
imaginative with the old material,
and the few old songs she does do
in revamped versions, with the
L.A. Express as backup band, are
usually uninteresting.
There is one other major
problem with this album: price.
An $11.98 list is far too expensive
for this collection, which is at best
a showcase for Joni Mitchell's
good but familiar songs.
There is no denying that Joni
Mitchell has made it as a powerful
performer and songwriter, but this
album represents more a pleasant
summing-up of her work so far
than an exposition of any new
musical directions she may be
taking.

Bob Dylan
Blood on the Tracks Aifk-k-k
Columbia PC 33235
Even the most fanatic Dylan
devotees had to wonder when his
live recording, Before the Flood.
came out last year: was this a
tone-deaf imposter who was
screeching songs like "All Along
the Watchtower" and "Blowin* in
the Wind," or was it the man who
wrote them?
Happily, those who doubted
that Dylan would ever write another
good song may now put their
fears to rest. After five dismal,
disappointing years, Bob Dylan is
back.
Blood on the Tracks, his
new release, reveals above all a
mature Bob Dylan. The
sometimes forced anger and the
edginess of his earlier works have
disappeared, replaced by a more
gentle feeling that makes the new
songs, if anything, more moving
than the old.
The masterpiece of Blood, a
seven-minute ballad called "Lily,
Rosemary, and the Jack of
Hearts," ranks among the great
songwriter's very best
compositions.
Puckish Jack
A wry tale about some very
confused girls and gamblers — all
except the puckish Jack of Hearts
— "Lily" brings a warmth and
color that has been missing from
Dylan's work since he painted a
self-portrait with a blue nose, and
evidently started to take it
seriously.
Dylan's voice, too, seems to
have mellowed almost overnight —
his singing isn't as consciously
"country" as on his Nashville
Skyline album, but it's just as
smooth and listenable.

Dylan's performance of the
endearing "Shelter From the
Storm" should challenge the
often-expressed notion that he is
not a great singer; it's difficult to
believe that anyone else could
have made the song more striking.
Instrumentally, too, this record
forms a pleasant contrast to other
recent Dylan releases: gone is the
electric accompaniment of the
Band (despite their successes on
their own, the Band never
sounded right behind Dylan).
Instead, Eric Weissberg and
Deliverance (on the tracks
recorded in New York) and a
three-man backup band (on those
done in Minneapolis) provide a
usually acoustic and always
understated base that goes well
with what Dylan has to say.
And in the long run, it's what
Dylan has to say that makes this
record such a joy: for the first
time in recent memory, he seems
to have lost his obsession with
being a pop star — he always
looked uncomfortable in that
role.
The 10 songs on Blood on the
Tracks represent, instead, both a
long and fond look backwards and
an expression of optimism by the
man who was for many a symbol
of youthful rebellion in the
'60s. As such, Blood is a very
important statement.
Enchanted Vision
In "Tangled Up in Blue" we
encounter a much younger Dylan,
enchanted with the spirit of a
New York where "there was
music in the cafes at night and
revolution in the air" — a vision
too idealized to last, soon
disintegrating into staleness and
frustration.
There is Dylan's experience in

the "Idiot Wind," and his reaction
to the fools he must deal with: a
reaction not so much of rage as of
weariness.
Dylan the unsentim°ntal lover
appears as the subject of several
songs on Blood, and the new love
songs, like "Buckets of Rain" ard
"You're Goin' To Make Me
Lonesome When You Go," have a
refreshing beauty that is one of
the most compelling features of
the new album.
In the world of "Buckets of
Rain," no preconceptions or
grandiose plans are called for.
Friends will arrive.
Friends will disappear,
If you want me
Honey baby, I'll be here.
No apocalyptic messages
appear here or in the wistful "If
You See Her, Say Hello," but
their strength lies in Dylan's
affirmation of love — and of the
feeling that, if the overblown
expectations of the past went
unfulfilled, there is no reason to
mourn their passing.
Twist Of Fate
For me, though, the sparse
song "A Simple Twist of Fate"
best expresses the feeling created
by Blood on the Tracks. Captured
perfectly in this song are the
inseparable feelings of joy and
sadness at remembering a
wonderful chance occurrence that
will never be recreated.
What could be more a "twist of
fate" than the emergence of Bob
Dylan? The remarkable time when
he could win acclaim as a new
prophet for singing something as
simple and straight-forward as
"The Times, Thev AreA-Oiangin' "
won't occur again, and Dylan
seems well aware of that.
Perhaps it is better, then, that

Dylan is no longer expected to
produce gospel visions whenever
he writes a song, for he is too
good a songwriter to be treated as
a social commentator.
That Dylan's is one of the great
American lives of recent times is
undeniable. That he has drawn on
his rich experience in creating
Blood on the Tracks is a major
reason for the album's artistic
success.
That he is back is reason to
celebrate.

Joni Mitchell
Miles of A isles -kirk
Asylum AB 202
Lately Joni Mitchell has been
acclaimed as something of a
poetess for the '70s or a
culture hero for America's
sensitive young people. That,
undeniably, is a large bill to fill
for a frail-voiced singer with an
out-of-tune guitar.
This two-record set, recorded
live mostly in Los Angeles last
summer, is a collection of her
best-known songs in her, by now,
very familiar style.
At times this album works very
well indeed: side two, for
instance, opens with Joni,
accompanied by her own guitar,
singing a tender version of
"Cactus Tree." It's one of her best
recorded performances, a
beautiful song done in a very
personal style.
More Complexity
Then on to "Cold Blue Steel
and Sweet Fire," a complex tune
sung in a peaceful, suspended
style with Tom Scotl's soprano

saxophone swelling underneath.
Two more numbers, "Woman of
Heart and Mind" and "A Case of
You," show Joni's special way
with the folk idiom.
Closing the side, Joni plays
piano and sings a short but
haunting version of "Blue,"
proving once again what just
about everyone knows: "Blue" is
a remarkably good song.
Other selections, though, have
serious shortcomings, faults that
many listeners may find hard to
overlook. "All 1 Want" finds Joni
straining unsuccessfully to hit the
high notes, with a raucous
accompaniment making the song
difficult to take.
And when Joni invites the
crowd to sing "The Circle Game"
out of tune, sure enough, they
sing it out of tune. They know the
words, though: so does everyone,
and that brings to mind the
fundamental question about this
album: was it really necessary?
Old Repeats
Of the 18 songs in this set,
only two are new compositions:
Joni does nothing really
imaginative with the old material,
and the few old songs she does do

serious shortcomings, faults that
many listeners may find hard to
overlook. "All 1 Want" finds Joni
straining unsuccessfully to hit the
high notes, with a raucous
accompaniment making the song
difficult to take.
And when Joni invites the
crowd to sing "The Circle Game"
out of tune, sure enough, they
sing it out of tune. They know the
words, though: so does everyone,
and that brings to mind the
fundamental question about this
album: was it really necessary?
Old Repeats
Of the 18 songs in this set,
only two are new compositions:
Joni does nothing really
imaginative with the old material,
and the few old songs she does do
in revamped versions, with the
L.A. Express as backup band, are
usually uninteresting.
There is one other major
problem with this album: price.
An $11.98 list is far too expensive
for this collection, which is at best
a showcase for Joni Mitchell's
good but familiar songs.
There is no denying that Joni
Mitchell has made it as a powerful
performer and songwriter, but this
album represents more a pleasant
summing-up of her work so far
than an exposition of any new
musical directions she may be
taking.

PLEASANT DREAMS—Mrs. Ogmore-Prichard (Carol Bunker) poses

production of Dylan Thomas' "Under Milk Wood," opening tonight at
London House in Palo Alto.
Bob Dylan
Blood on the Tracks Aifk-k-k
Columbia PC 33235
Even the most fanatic Dylan
devotees had to wonder when his
live recording, Before the Flood.
came out last year: was this a
tone-deaf imposter who was
screeching songs like "All Along
the Watchtower" and "Blowin* in
the Wind," or was it the man who
wrote them?
Happily, those who doubted
that Dylan would ever write another
good song may now put their
fears to rest. After five dismal,
disappointing years, Bob Dylan is
back.
Blood on the Tracks, his
new release, reveals above all a
mature Bob Dylan. The
sometimes forced anger and the
edginess of his earlier works have
disappeared, replaced by a more
gentle feeling that makes the new
songs, if anything, more moving
than the old.
The masterpiece of Blood, a
seven-minute ballad called "Lily,
Rosemary, and the Jack of
Hearts," ranks among the great
songwriter's very best
compositions.
Puckish Jack
A wry tale about some very
confused girls and gamblers — all
except the puckish Jack of Hearts
— "Lily" brings a warmth and
color that has been missing from
Dylan's work since he painted a
self-portrait with a blue nose, and
evidently started to take it
seriously.
Dylan's voice, too, seems to
have mellowed almost overnight —
his singing isn't as consciously
"country" as on his Nashville
Skyline album, but it's just as
smooth and listenable.

Dylan's performance of the
endearing "Shelter From the
Storm" should challenge the
often-expressed notion that he is
not a great singer; it's difficult to
believe that anyone else could
have made the song more striking.
Instrumentally, too, this record
forms a pleasant contrast to other
recent Dylan releases: gone is the
electric accompaniment of the
Band (despite their successes on
their own, the Band never
sounded right behind Dylan).
Instead, Eric Weissberg and
Deliverance (on the tracks
recorded in New York) and a
three-man backup band (on those
done in Minneapolis) provide a
usually acoustic and always
understated base that goes well
with what Dylan has to say.
And in the long run, it's what
Dylan has to say that makes this
record such a joy: for the first
time in recent memory, he seems
to have lost his obsession with
being a pop star — he always
looked uncomfortable in that
role.
The 10 songs on Blood on the
Tracks represent, instead, both a
long and fond look backwards and
an expression of optimism by the
man who was for many a symbol
of youthful rebellion in the
'60s. As such, Blood is a very
important statement.
Enchanted Vision
In "Tangled Up in Blue" we
encounter a much younger Dylan,
enchanted with the spirit of a
New York where "there was
music in the cafes at night and
revolution in the air" — a vision
too idealized to last, soon
disintegrating into staleness and
frustration.
There is Dylan's experience in

the "Idiot Wind," and his reaction
to the fools he must deal with: a
reaction not so much of rage as of
weariness.
Dylan the unsentim°ntal lover
appears as the subject of several
songs on Blood, and the new love
songs, like "Buckets of Rain" ard
"You're Goin' To Make Me
Lonesome When You Go," have a
refreshing beauty that is one of
the most compelling features of
the new album.
In the world of "Buckets of
Rain," no preconceptions or
grandiose plans are called for.
Friends will arrive.
Friends will disappear,
If you want me
Honey baby, I'll be here.
No apocalyptic messages
appear here or in the wistful "If
You See Her, Say Hello," but
their strength lies in Dylan's
affirmation of love — and of the
feeling that, if the overblown
expectations of the past went
unfulfilled, there is no reason to
mourn their passing.
Twist Of Fate
For me, though, the sparse
song "A Simple Twist of Fate"
best expresses the feeling created
by Blood on the Tracks. Captured
perfectly in this song are the
inseparable feelings of joy and
sadness at remembering a
wonderful chance occurrence that
will never be recreated.
What could be more a "twist of
fate" than the emergence of Bob
Dylan? The remarkable time when
he could win acclaim as a new
prophet for singing something as
simple and straight-forward as
"The Times, Thev AreA-Oiangin' "
won't occur again, and Dylan
seems well aware of that.
Perhaps it is better, then, that

Dylan is no longer expected to
produce gospel visions whenever
he writes a song, for he is too
good a songwriter to be treated as
a social commentator.
That Dylan's is one of the great
American lives of recent times is
undeniable. That he has drawn on
his rich experience in creating
Blood on the Tracks is a major
reason for the album's artistic
success.
That he is back is reason to
celebrate.

Joni Mitchell
Miles of A isles -kirk
Asylum AB 202
Lately Joni Mitchell has been
acclaimed as something of a
poetess for the '70s or a
culture hero for America's
sensitive young people. That,
undeniably, is a large bill to fill
for a frail-voiced singer with an
out-of-tune guitar.
This two-record set, recorded
live mostly in Los Angeles last
summer, is a collection of her
best-known songs in her, by now,
very familiar style.
At times this album works very
well indeed: side two, for
instance, opens with Joni,
accompanied by her own guitar,
singing a tender version of
"Cactus Tree." It's one of her best
recorded performances, a
beautiful song done in a very
personal style.
More Complexity
Then on to "Cold Blue Steel
and Sweet Fire," a complex tune
sung in a peaceful, suspended
style with Tom Scotl's soprano

saxophone swelling underneath.
Two more numbers, "Woman of
Heart and Mind" and "A Case of
You," show Joni's special way
with the folk idiom.
Closing the side, Joni plays
piano and sings a short but
haunting version of "Blue,"
proving once again what just
about everyone knows: "Blue" is
a remarkably good song.
Other selections, though, have
serious shortcomings, faults that
many listeners may find hard to
overlook. "All 1 Want" finds Joni
straining unsuccessfully to hit the
high notes, with a raucous
accompaniment making the song
difficult to take.
And when Joni invites the
