# Movies: Some Porno Queens And A Jewish Princess
## 
### 
Let's get down to cases. It's
nice if hard core films have plots,
meaningful dialogue and lush
photography. But most people
come to see the fucking anyway,
so why not forget the meager
attempts at plot?
That's what "loops" are all
about — hours of continuous sex
action, with no plot to get in the
way of erections and climaxes. So
why not take some juicy action
sequences out of the better
known hard core sex films and
show them?
Call it Eroticore and feature
top porn stars like Harry Reams,
Linda Lovelace, Georgina
Spelvin, and Tina Russell. Don't
even bother with such subtleties
as titles or cast lists flashing
across the screen.
Just start the fucking.
For a change of pace, include
one lesbian scene, which is as
good a lesson in cunnilingus as
you'd ever want (Spelvin services
Russell), and a tacky but funny
cartoon, a sort of porno Hansel
and Gretel.
That's Eroticore which makes
no pretentions about what it is —
the same thing that the American
Legion men used to watch at their
club back in the Now it's
in color and anyone over 18 can
see it for a few bucks.
But America is enlightened,
compared to France. There you
can talk about it and you can get
naked, but you can't actually do
it on the screen, like in the good
old U.S.A.
So soft core porn is still hot
stuff in France. The "hottest" of
France's soft core offerings,
Emmanuelle has opened in
America with a barrage of

publicity playing up the X rating.
It "lets you feel good without
feeling bad" the ads say. Actually
it leaves you wondering if sex has
any feeling in it at all. Sylvia
Kristel, who showed off her bod
in Que a few months ago, is so
passive that an inanimate object
like a dildo would be the active
partner in any sex with her.
She goes to Thailand as the
wife of a French diplomat and
gets it on with a lot of very cool,
reserved but wicked French men
and women. It's all quite
Continental, which is a synonym
for boring, because no one looks
even the slightest bit interested or
turned on during the many scenes
of simulated sex.
Give me the no-nonsense
American style any day. It makes
no pretentious demands on the
audience, other than a great
interest in people's excited sex
organs.
—George Powell
Contrary to what its title
suggests, Sheila Leuine Is Dead
And Living In New York (how
are they going to get that on the
marquee?) is not a story about
supernatural phenomena. It is the
story of a Jewish girl from
Pennsylvania (Jeannie Berlin, who
was so superb in "The Heartbreak
Kid ")who comes to New York to
find happiness and a man, though
not necessarily in that order, and,
with unerring accuracy, gets
involved with people who always
end up hurting her.
We enter her life as she moves
in with a wacky roommate
(Rebecca Dianna Smith, who
takes a role made for Goldie
Hawn and makes it her own),

much to her mother's chagrin, and
immediately meets a doctor (Roy
Scheider), who takes her to bed
faster than you can say the
American Medical Association.
Actually, Sheila is far from
dead — she has very high
standards and will not accept any
menial job. Through all the blows
that life deals Sheila — her
younger sister's wedding, her
roommate's stealing the doctor
away and insulting graffiti on top
of all that— she has the fortitude
to scramble up and keep on going.
In the end, her catalytic
presence has affected her friends,
maturing them a little bit, too.
But by then, it's not interesting
anymore.
It's possible to enjoy sad,
depressing movies like this one,
possible because it makes you see
how insignificant your problems
are by comparison. But
somewhere along the way, the
screenplay fails to make the
predicaments interesting. It's too
bad that Jeannie Berlin didn't
have Sheila's high standards when
she did this movie.
I think the book might have
been better equipped to
communicate the story.
Sidney J. Furie, who gave
us iMdy Sings the Blues, directed
it; unfortunately Sheila Leuine
neither has the vitality uor the
magnetism to reach the high

plateau set by Lady.
However, as boring as the
movie is, the acting cannot be
faulted. Once Jeannie Berlin gets a
part she can really sink her teeth
into, she will take off to the levels
of Joanne Woodward and Ellen
Burstyn. That talent is evident
here.
Roy Scheider, who had
nothing to do but look tough and
shoot a gun in both The French
Connection and The
Seven-Ups, acts surprisingly well
as Dr. Sam Stoneman.
Furie managed to get sparkling
performances out of everyone
else, too, especially Talley Parker
as a sad, frustrated co-worker of
Sheila's.
But far and away the best
performance of the picture is
Rebecca Dianna Smith's portrayal
of crazy Kate, Sheila's roommate,
who breezes through life until
Sheila finally makes her see that
it's not that simple. While Kate's
style falls apart, she is forced to
step back and evaluate herself,
and Rebecca steals the movie
away from Berlin and Scheider.
When Sheila has gotten
everything she wanted and
affected those around her, it's all
nice but not very exciting. It is
unfortunate that with such talent
working on it, the overall picture
couldn't have been better.

HISTORICAL MATTERS—Sandra McPherson and Ed Mock supply
some action in "History of the Blues," billed as "the chronicling of
200 years of American music." Now in performance at the On
Braodway Theatre in San Francisco, the play stars singer Jon
Hendricks.

THE LADY ON THE LEFT IS DEAD—Or so the title "Sheila Levine Is Dead and Living in New York"
might indicate. Meanwhile, the lady on the right (Rebecca Dianna Smith) is about to take the man in the
middle (Roy Scheider) away from poor Sheila (Jeannie Berlin) in a scene from the new movie.
