# Won't Publish Today
## 'Live Oak' Shuffles Management 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Live Oak, the weekly campus news-features paper, will
not publish today because of an editorial reshuffling,
according to managing editor Charlie Hall and news editor
Bill Grueskin,
The paper will resume a normal publication schedule
next week. Hall and Grueskin said.
In the reshuffling, Live Oak editor Bill Weinstein will
step down, but continue working for the paper "primarily
in advertising," Grueskin said.
Hall's and Grueskin's statements cleared up rumors
circulating earlier this week that Weinstein was leaving the
paper entirely and that, hence. Live Oak would suspend
publication.
Still In Business
"We definitely are going to stay in business," Grueskin
told the Daily last night.
Live Oak staffers have been meeting throughout the
week to determine the editorial course of the paper, he
added. Hall said the staff would also select Weinstein's
successor.
Weinstein, Live Oak editor for two quarters, decided to
resign for personal reasons. Hall and Grueskin said.
"He's tired out," Hall explained. "He's put in so many
hours the past two quarters." The two editors stressed that
the editorial staff reshuffling was Weinstein's decision and
"not a coup."

Weinstein was unavailable for comment last night.
Economic Pressures
Grueskin commented that the last issue of the paper, on
Feb. 7, made money.
In assessing the editorial future of the paper, Hall
suggested that Live Oak would continue in its new longer
sheet format and move away from issues centered around
themes.
He pointed to Live Oak's story on Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs' memo on financial aid
to minorities as an indication of the paper's new direction.
Balance Sought
Hall said the paper would attempt to balance
investigative journalism, in-depth reporting, features and
entertainment.
He added that the staff was "very united" and would
continue working to put out a "good product."
Both Hall and Grueskin assessed the paper's exact
direction as "up in the air," however. Layout editor Fred
Bierman commented, "Things are in a state of limbo. We
can't be sure."
Live Oak began publication this year after a stormy
session last summer with ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri. Olivieri charged Weinstein with fiscal
irresponsibility.
The paper unsuccessfully sought a refundable $1 fee
assessment from students last quarter.
