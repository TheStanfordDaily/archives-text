# Symphony Shostakovich Sloppy
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
SAN FRANCISCO—The San
Francisco Symphony performed
erratically Wednesday night in a
program of Shostakovich's
Symphony No. 1, Opus 10, and
Mahler's Symphony No. 1 in D
Mcjor (Titan).
The Shostakovich was plagued
with problems from the
beginning. Unsteady tempos
marred the otherwise good
dynamic and instrumental
problems in the Allegreto.
The Allegro, which demands
absolute technical precision, was
sloppy and much too fast, as if
the orchestra got carried away
with itself.
In the Lento/Allegro molto,
concertmaster Stuart Canin
played his solos quite admirably,
with good intonation and a vivid

sensual romanticism. Princira 1
cellist Robert Sayre performed his
solos with a "hit or miss"
approach, and he often missed.
In this movement are several
measures of timpani solo in
addition to the strings. Recently
the Orchestra has had much
publicity concerning the tenure
denial of timpanist Blayne Jones,
who performed this solo.
As far as this reviewer i$
concerned, the committee that
voted to deny her tenure was
justified on their grounds of poor
intonation. Her timpani were
badly, inexcusably out of tune,
marring a solo that is vital to the
character and suspense of this
movement.
It was not entirely the
orchestra's fault that the
Shostakovich was poorly played.

Much of the blame should go to
visiting conductor Yuri
Temirkanov. He is impossible to
follow, at least from an audience
point of view, and the orchestra
couldn't follow him either.
His wild gyrations seem
ill-suited to Shostakovich's precise
rhythms and tempos. Temirkanov
conducted much more
successfully last week with the
Tchaikovsky; at least everyone
knows Tchaikovsky and can play
on their own if the conductor is
incomprehensible.
