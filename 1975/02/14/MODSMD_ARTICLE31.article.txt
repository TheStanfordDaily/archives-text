## Crucial Weekend Ahead For Cagers 
### DAN PYNE 
Here we go again.
It seems like only yesterday
'that Stanford was playing
Washington and Washington State,
but it was last week so a short
preview is inevitable.
The cast is the same, but the
setting is a little different. This
week the Cards play Washington
first, tonight, and Washington
State tomorrow. In the afternoon.
On TVS.
And there's pressure.
Crucial Games
Card coach Howie Dallmar has
t been saying for three weeks that
t'the next games are crucial ones.
* He said it before the Cal game. He
said it before the Washington
series. And he's saying it now.
This time he stresses it. The
Cards must win the rest of their
home games to stay in the
running. Then, and only then, if
they can split in Los Angeles with
UCLA and USC it might be
'tourney-time.
Against the schools from the
north this weekend, the Cardinals
should be prepared. They handled
Washington State well last week,
completely confusing all forms of
' defense the Cougars could muster,
~ and controlling the effectiveness
of Steve Puidokas for most of the
• game.
But Washington will be
tougher. The Cards
out-everythinged the Dogs last
week and still came up on the
short end of the score. Home
court advantage could be the
biggest key, though Dallmar
disagrees.
No Home Advantage
"We're happy to have five of
our next seven games at home,"
he said, "but the home court
advantage hasn't been that
significant in our conference. So

far visiting teams have won
exactly half of the 28 games
played."
The Huskies have beaten
Washington State at home and
lost close contests to UCLA and
USC in Los Angeles. Stanford has
not yet lost a conference game in
Maples. Of course, it has only
played two .. . UCLA and USC.
A lot of factors could be
important: Rich Kelley's virus,
Puidokas' shooting, Lars Hansen
and James Edwards in height and
bulk and Dick Enberg's
play-by-play.
But basically, it's a
here-we-go-again weekend.
Cardinal Notes: Rich Kelley
needs only four points to become th e
sixth leading career scorer in
Stanford history.
Here we go again.
