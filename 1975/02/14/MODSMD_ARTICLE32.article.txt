# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
If you read our predictions
every week, you know that our
fearful forecaster usually
throws in a lot of bull about
how tough the week's
predictions will be, and then
correctly picks an upset or two
to look like a genius. *
Well, this week, we'll be
patriotic and assume the role
of President Ford (honest and
dumb). This week's picks
aren't very hard to make. The
weaker teams are visiting the

stronger ones.
But we couldn't let a week
go by without picking an
upset. This week, that upset
will be Oregon over USC
Saturday night.
Don't put too much stock
in that analysis, however. Last
week we missed both USC
games to spoil an otherwise
perfect week. Our record, by
the way, is 27-10 (.730).
Footnote: We haven't missed a
UCLA game yet.

â™¦EDITOR'S NOTE: Our fearful
forecaster is undoubtedly getting a
big, if not enormous head. He keeps
forgetting what he predicted for the
Stanford-USC football game. Oh
well.
