# IM Roundup
## Soccer, Hoop Playoffs Near 
### PETE BHATIA 
The annual IM gymnastics
meet will be held next Thursday
Feb. 20, at 4 p.m. in Encina Gym,
it was announced this week. The
competition will be as always with
each living group or independent
team allowed to enter a squad of
six individuals. Scheduled events
are free exercise, side horse, rings,
vaulting, parallel bars, horizontal
bar and all-around. There may be
more events added.
Women, as with all IM sports,
are eligible to compete, and meet
director Gina Anastasi is
encouraging as many women as
possible to compete.

Except for makeup games, the
regular soccer season concludes

tomorrow. Pending this weekend's
results, it appears that five teams
headed for the "A" division
playoffs will enter with
undefeated records. Those teams
are: The Wildmen (Monday); last
year's champs, the Bachacs
(Tuesday); last year's runnerups,
Education (Thursday); the
Engineers (Friday); and the
International Association
(Saturday morning).

Basketball is also wrapping up
its final week of regular season
play with next week devoted to
makeup games before the
beginning of the playoffs, Feb.
23. It appears at this point that no
one is going to be able to match
Seek and Destroy, who had their

closest game of the season
Wednesday night. They won by
forfeit.
The Phi Delts will probably be
the second seed behind Seek and
Destroy with Nickel Bag and SAE
the prize contenders for the third
seed.
