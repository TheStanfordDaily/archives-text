## May The Best Team Lose 
### Vlae Kershner 
Halfway through the Pacific Eight conference
basketball season, two things seem clear.
1. UCLA is no longer the best team in the
league.
2. UCLA will probably win anyway.
A couple weeks ago, after Stanford KO'd both
Los Angeles powers, many informed observers (and
some uninformed ones, like me) thought the
Trojans were by far the best team in the league.
I still think so. Their big men play technically
excellent defense, and that factor, combined with
super-guard Gus Williams, make them the most
talented team. UCLA and Stanford seem about one
notcn below.
And while Stanford was embarrassing itself at
Cal, UCLA beat USC at Pauley Pavilion by only
five. Since the Bruins have at least a 10-point
homecourt advantage as measured by comparative
scores), USC still looks like the better team.
But there's been an aberration last weekend,
when the L.A. schools played at the Oregons.
UCLA won both games. USC split, losing to Oregon
State.
That leaves the Pac-8 race firmly in the grasp of
Wooden's wonders. UCLA is 6-1, surprising (but
technically weak) Oregon State is 5-2, Stanford and
USC are 4-3, disappointing Oregon and Washington
3-4.
In other words, UCLA has a two-game lead on
anyone who could possibly beat them. If UCLA
goes even 5-2 in the last half of the season, which
begins tonight, the worst it will do is tie for first.
Without getting into a lot of who-beats-who
details, it's likely that UCLA will be able to lose
two of its remaining seven games and still take clear
first. 11-3 will win the Pac-8 this year.Oh, well. To

the seven dwarfs in the Pac-8, there's always second
place.
And this year, second place is important. The
NCAA rules have been amended so that two league
teams can go to the NCAA tournament. Another
team goes to the College Commissioner's
Tournament in JilMbatUtt. And yet another team
could be invited to the National Invitational in New
York.
So, where does all this leave Stanford?
The Cardinals are in a good position to go
somewhere. They play five of their remaining seven
games inside that new basketball hotbed. Maples
Pavilion. The only away games arc at USC and
UCLA.
Stanford will be favored to win all five home
games and lose the two away games. If that
happens, the Cardinals will finish 9-5, which should
be good enough for third behind USC and UCLA.
If the Cards beat either L.A. school again, make
that a tie for second. If they beat both . . . well,
we're dreaming.
But all this assumes Stanford will win all five
home games. Certainly the team has the ability to
do so but as any Stanford fan knows, you
can't take anything for granted.
In the next two weeks, Stanford hosts the
Washingtons (George tonight, and winless Martha
| WSU] tomorrow afternoon) and the Oregons.
If the Cardinals win all four games, they will
almost certainly go to some tournament (which one
depends on how they do in L.A.) If they don't win
at least three of the four, well, maybe four years
from now we'll have a team as good as that of this
year. See you then.
