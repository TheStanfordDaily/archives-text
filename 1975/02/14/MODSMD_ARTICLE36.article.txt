Indoor Tennis Tourney
Stanford's tennis team opened
the season in grand style
yesterday with a 9-0 whitewash of
Oklahoma in the first round of
the National Collegiate Indoor
Championships in Madison,
Wise.
The Cards are defending the
title which they won two years
ago, the first and only time that
the championships have
previously been contested.
Oklahoma was blitzed by a
lineup that is foreign to Stanford
fans. Coach Dick Could played
NCAA champ John Whitlinger at
the first singles spot, which is
hardly a surprise, but the other
players were less familiar in their
new positions.
Nick Daviano played at
number two and Pat DuPre at
three, while Jim Delaney, last
year's top man after Sandy
Mayer's departure, was in the
fourth slot. Gene Mayer at five
and Bill Maze at six completed the
lineup.
No Card lost a set in either
singles or doubles, so no match
was really notable. But Billy
Maze's contest was the first of his
career as a Card, and he rose to

the occasion with a 6-2, 7-6 win.

Grapplers In Maples
The Stanford wrestling team,
just coming off a win over Cal
State-Hayward last night, jumps
rom the frying pan into the fire
tonight as they return to Maples
Pavilion to take on California'in a
Southern Division Pacific Eight
matchup tonight.
The match should give
wrestling coach Joe DeMeo a good
idea of how well some of his
young grapplers will fare at the
upcoming Pac-8 post-season
tournament Feb. 21-22 in

Corvallis, Ore.
DeMeo's wrestlers have had
little exposure to Pac-8 calibre
competition this season. And the
Pac-8 schools they have wrestled
— Oregon, UCLA and Cal —
usually defeated them handily.
The California match was the
exception.
Stanford took a good Golden
Bear mat crew and extended them
through all ten matches before
succumbing 21-19. In fact, only a
Cal upset at the 150-pound weight
class against Card Ail-American
Chris Horpel prevented Stanford
from picking up the win.
Ski Team Suffers
The 1975 Stanford ski team
does not seem to lack talent, good
coaching, or excellent equipment.
But the team has suffered from a
lack of good skiing conditions this
season.
The weather problems began
two weeks ago at the scheduled
meet opener, the Nevada Carnival.
Due to heavy snows and gusty
winds the meet had to be
canceled.
Last weekend the skiers tried
again, this time at the University
of California-sponsored

Vanderbilt Cup at Squaw Valley.
Rain washed out the Nordic ski
jumping on Saturday while the
giant slalom on Sunday was
canceled because heavy snowfall
made it almost impossible to
adequately pack down the course
for the racers.
But competition was held in
two events the slalom and the
nine-kilometer cross-country race.
Stanford fared best on a team
basis in the slalom, finishing
second to Sierra College.
In the cross-country event
Stanford placed three skiers in the
top twenty-one "which isn't too
bad for Stanford," according to
assistant coach Bill Gibson.
