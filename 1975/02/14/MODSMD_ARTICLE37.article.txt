# The
						Harter They Fall
## 
### 
Oregon basketball coach
Dick Harter had some mean
things to say about his own
team's fans. He complained
that the Eugene fans were less
than bearable last weekend at
the UCLA game.
Wednesday night, Harter
was arrested in Eugene for
driving while intoxicated. He
was released on bail.
