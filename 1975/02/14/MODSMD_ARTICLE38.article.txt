# Stanford Hockey Club
## Icers Dedicated To Hockey 
### JEFF BOOTHE 
Those of you who have been
reading about field hockey in the
Daily and thinking that it was the
only hockey team at Stanford;
open your eyes.
For five years the Stanford Ice
Hockey Club has been playing
virtually unnoticed by the
Stanford community, for reasons
of ignorance or lack of publicity.
Ice hockey is the sport the
California Seals play, in the loose
sense of the sport, and the game
the Montreal Canadiens play, in
the best sense of the sport.
Although the Card.s don't play
like the Canadiens nor the Seals,
they do play.
"It would be nice to say I play
hockey and to have people say
they've heard of it," said
sophomore Danny Schley.
Nevertheless, the Stanford
Hockey Club is alive and existing.
The squad is comprised of
misplaced Easterners and
Midwesterners, who for the love
of the sport, couldn't put their
hockey sticks down.
The club is a close knit group
of approximately 30-40 people.
The team has more than hockey
in common, as Schley explained.
"The team is a brotherhood. It
closely resembles a fraternity, but
it's better."
The club offers hockey players
of all kinds of ability and age a
chance to play.
Coach Pat Baldwin is a former
Dutch Olympic team coach,
graduate student Tom Heckler
played at St. Olaf's in Minnesota
before coming to Stanford and
Jay Johnston was offered a
scholarship to play hockey at
Brown, but chose Stanford
instead. Johnston is also a varsity
golfer.
Most of the players
participated in high school, but
few were good enough to play on

the college level back East. As
Sophomore Donny Stewart
stated, "Most of us couldn't have
made it back East. We wouldn't
have played varsity, maybe JV,
but never varsity."
Since it is a club, the
atmosphere allows those who are
interested to take up the sport, in
addition to those who already
play. Danny Schley summed up
the attitude of the players on the
team as he stated, "It's not talent
that makes the team, but
dedicated play."
Equipment costs, traveling
costs and Belmont Ice Arena
make dedication virtually a
prerequisite for the squad.
The costs for hockey arise
from paying for ice time at
Belmont, traveling to other rinks
to play and for equipment. These
factors inhibit the expansion and
interest in the program. Since
Belmont is the only rink in the
west Bay Area the club must
travel to Stockton, Sacramento,
Santa Rosa and other far-off
places to play, in addition to
paying the costs of renting
Belmont for team practices.
The Belmont Ice Arena itself
also hinders interest in the
program. The rink is far from
desirable and is one of the few
rinks which has those rules. For
example, the puck is dead if it hits
the rafters twelve feet over head,
or it is still playable if it hits
below the windows on the cement
wall which runs along two sides of
the rink. Goalies also have to
contend with sliding nets — which
can be conveniently moved if a
shot is on its way in.
Despite these disadvantages,
many of the players prefer the
club atmosphere to a team
atmosphere. Freshman Murray
Kenney explained, "The reason I
liked Stanford is that it's so low
keyStewart cites another reason:

"Back East if you weren't
aggressive or didn't play — well,
there were five guys on the bench
to take your place, and here that
isn't the case."
In a contrast to most sports at
Stanford, enjoyment is the key to
club hockey. As Schley
summarizes, "The whole scene is a
good time, we play for each other.
I've enjoyed playing here more
than I have anywhere before."

Those of you who have been
reading about field hockey in the
Daily and thinking that it was the
only hockey team at Stanford;
open your eyes.
For five years the Stanford Ice
Hockey Club has been playing
virtually unnoticed by the
Stanford community, for reasons
of ignorance or lack of publicity.
Ice hockey is the sport the
California Seals play, in the loose
sense of the sport, and the game
the Montreal Canadiens play, in
the best sense of the sport.
Although the Card.s don't play
like the Canadiens nor the Seals,
they do play.
"It would be nice to say I play
hockey and to have people say
they've heard of it," said
sophomore Danny Schley.
Nevertheless, the Stanford
Hockey Club is alive and existing.
The squad is comprised of
misplaced Easterners and
Midwesterners, who for the love
of the sport, couldn't put their
hockey sticks down.
The club is a close knit group
of approximately 30-40 people.
The team has more than hockey
in common, as Schley explained.
"The team is a brotherhood. It
closely resembles a fraternity, but
it's better."
The club offers hockey players
of all kinds of ability and age a
chance to play.
Coach Pat Baldwin is a former
Dutch Olympic team coach,
graduate student Tom Heckler
played at St. Olaf's in Minnesota
before coming to Stanford and
Jay Johnston was offered a
scholarship to play hockey at
Brown, but chose Stanford
instead. Johnston is also a varsity
golfer.
Most of the players
participated in high school, but
few were good enough to play on

the college level back East. As
Sophomore Donny Stewart
stated, "Most of us couldn't have
made it back East. We wouldn't
have played varsity, maybe JV,
but never varsity."
Since it is a club, the
atmosphere allows those who are
interested to take up the sport, in
addition to those who already
play. Danny Schley summed up
the attitude of the players on the
team as he stated, "It's not talent
that makes the team, but
dedicated play."
Equipment costs, traveling
costs and Belmont Ice Arena
make dedication virtually a
prerequisite for the squad.
The costs for hockey arise
from paying for ice time at
Belmont, traveling to other rinks
to play and for equipment. These
factors inhibit the expansion and
interest in the program. Since
Belmont is the only rink in the
west Bay Area the club must
travel to Stockton, Sacramento,
Santa Rosa and other far-off
places to play, in addition to
paying the costs of renting
Belmont for team practices.
The Belmont Ice Arena itself
also hinders interest in the
program. The rink is far from
desirable and is one of the few
rinks which has those rules. For
example, the puck is dead if it hits
the rafters twelve feet over head,
or it is still playable if it hits
below the windows on the cement
wall which runs along two sides of
the rink. Goalies also have to
contend with sliding nets — which
can be conveniently moved if a
shot is on its way in.
Despite these disadvantages,
many of the players prefer the
club atmosphere to a team
atmosphere. Freshman Murray
Kenney explained, "The reason I
liked Stanford is that it's so low
keyStewart cites another reason:

"Back East if you weren't
aggressive or didn't play — well,
there were five guys on the bench
to take your place, and here that
isn't the case."
In a contrast to most sports at
Stanford, enjoyment is the key to
club hockey. As Schley
summarizes, "The whole scene is a
good time, we play for each other.
I've enjoyed playing here more
than I have anywhere before."
