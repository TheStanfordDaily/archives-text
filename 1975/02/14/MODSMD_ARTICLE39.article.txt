# Tankers Tussle Tough Trojans

Defending NCAA swimming
champion USC invades the Farm
tomorrow for a big Pac-8 dual
meet set to start at 1 p.m. in the
deGuerre Pool. The awesome
Trojans boast a dazzling array of
world-class swimmers, and
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
expects to see "some of the best
races of the year."
Two of the many great races
will be in the 50 and 100 yard
freestyle events, with Stanford's
superb sprinter Dave Fairbank
dueling Trojan Joe Bottom
Fairbank's 20.6 clocking in the 50
free last week against UCLA
vaulted him into the top spot in
the nation, just ahead of Bottom.
"The individual medley should
also be a great race," predicts
Gaughran, as Card star John
Hencken tests USC's Scott Brown.
Backstroker John Naber, a
product of Woodside High School
who has achieved world-class
stature since arriving at USC,
should also provide the Cards with
a few headaches.
"They've got a lot of depth
and talent," says Gaughran, using
the USC medley relay team as an
example. They've got the NCAA
Champion in the 100 free, 100
back and 100 fly, along with the
runner up in the 100 breast in
that relay."
"If our swimmers can improve
their times from last week [in the
win over UCLA]" says Gaughran,
"we could surprise them." One
swimmer Gaughran doesn't have
to worry about is frosh star Mike
Bruner. After three individual
wins in last weekend's 65-48 win
over UCLA, Gaughran hardly
expects Bruner's speed to come as

a shock to the Troians.
"He's just a helluva swimmer,"
marvels one teammate, summing
up the feelings of nearly everyone
associated with Stanford
swimming. Since arriving at
Stanford, Bruner has proceeded to
break two Cardinal all-time
records (in the 1000 and 500 free)
and three pool records (in the
1000, 500 and 200 fly). He is also
the 1974 National AAU 1,650
freestyle champion and American
record-holder.
"I came to Stanford because
it's a good school with a good
swimming program," says the
Stockton product, who was
recruited by a multitude of
schools — including USC. He is
currently undecided about his
future, although he's "going into
some field in engineering — maybe
electrical."
Bruner, who is the team
work horse, will be counted on
tomorrow to continue his winning
ways. For a guy who's been
winning all of his life, that
shouldn't be too much of a
problem.

AAAAAEEEEEAAAAAEEEEEAAAAAH—No, Jane, this isn't
Johnny Weismuller. It's Mike Bruner, the freshman ace of the
Stanford swim team. Bruner holds the American record for the
1650-yard freestyle, and has set several new Stanford all-time and
pool records this year.
