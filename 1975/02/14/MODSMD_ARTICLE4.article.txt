# Troubled, Undergrads? There's Hope For You
## 
### PAIGE CHERNO 
A student having trouble in class may head to Meyer Library, but the
reason may not be to catch up on back reading. A peer tutoring service
there provided by the Learning Assistance Center (LAC) aids troubled
undergraduates.
Since the beginning of fall quarter, the LAC has provided free tutoring
for undergraduates having difficulty in specific courses. Tutoring
coordinator Sallie Cannom said the tutors, most of whom are
undergraduates themselves, receive academic credit for their work.
The LAC is under the auspices of the dean of undergraduate studies,
but has not been threatened by impending budget cuts in his office.
If a student is struggling with material in a particular course, an inquiry
at the LAC will bring the names of several qualified tutors.
The student must contact a tutor to arrange a meeting. "We want to be
helpful, but not meddlesome," Cannom said. The LAC, however, will
check back with the student to see if arrangements have been made.
