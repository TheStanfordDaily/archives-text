# Troubled, Undergrads? There's Hope For You
## 
### PAIGE CHERNO 
A student having trouble in class may head to Meyer Library, but the
reason may not be to catch up on back reading. A peer tutoring service
there provided by the Learning Assistance Center (LAC) aids troubled
undergraduates.
Since the beginning of fall quarter, the LAC has provided free tutoring
for undergraduates having difficulty in specific courses. Tutoring
coordinator Sallie Cannom said the tutors, most of whom are
undergraduates themselves, receive academic credit for their work.
The LAC is under the auspices of the dean of undergraduate studies,
but has not been threatened by impending budget cuts in his office.
If a student is struggling with material in a particular course, an inquiry
at the LAC will bring the names of several qualified tutors.
The student must contact a tutor to arrange a meeting. "We want to be
helpful, but not meddlesome," Cannom said. The LAC, however, will
check back with the student to see if arrangements have been made.

IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM—The Learning Assistance Center in Meyer
Library concentrates on trying to help students who are struggling with
specific classes, says coordinator Sallie Cannom.
Prospective tutors fill out an
application form, which asks primarily
for a list of classes and grades they
have accumulated in their field. Once
accepted, they join Cannom's LAC
Tutoring Practicum 101, a
methodology class on tutoring.
Tutors receive one unit of credit for
the class and an additional unit for
every 30 hours of tutoring. A tutor
can acquire up to nine tutoring units,
all pass/no credit.
A tutor needn't work with a
student who contacts him through the
LAC. Cannom said he may work in a
departmental consultation center, or
he may tutor friends.
'How To Relate'
Tutor Judy Ain said a large part of
the practicum revolves around "how
to go about approaching people, how
to relate to people."
Tutors mentioned role-playing in
class as valuable in dealing with
students. Cannon said, "We discuss
what to do with a student who is
really leaning on a tutor, or a student
who really hates the material."
According to the tutors, the
students usually just want help
understanding the subject matter.
Gives Old Questions
"They don't really know what they
want to know. It's up to me to find
out," said Betsy Holland. She gives her
students old test questions and if they
cannot answer them, she finds
precisely where the problems lie.
Students might have specific
questions in mind, but usually cannot
get specific answers out of their tutors.
One student said, "Kven when I just
wanted the answer, my tutor insisted
that I struggle to find my own."
Physics tutor .Jonathan Horton
says, "Last quarter I was not just
trying to answer questions. I was
trying to guide my students through
the course."
Program Goals
Though improved grades is an
object of the program, Cannom said,
"that is by no means the only
measurement of the program's value.
You also should ask if the student
likes the subject better, if the tutoring
relationship has helped him."
Though she was disappointed in her

grade and is not taking chemistry again
this quarter, Suki Kitchell says,"The
tutoring was definitely helpful. It gave
me great security to know that I could
call someone any time I had a
problem. 1 felt good and worked really
hard. I just wish I had taken more
advantage of it."
Kitchell said her tutor, Kelly
Flanagan, made chemistry more fun
and meaningful for her. "She gave me
analogy games. She would give me a
baking problem to explain how to
work out a chemistry problem."
Flanagan said, "I had had a lot of
trouble with chemistry. So I used
myself as an example and showed her
how I learned it."
No Definite Conclusions
Tutors and students reported
increased understanding and improved
grades, although the LAC has not yet
come to any definite conclusions
based on the students' fall quarter
progress and final grades.
Most students praised their tutors.
A typical comment on a tutor
evaluation sheet was, "He made me
feel that no question was too small or

dumb to ask."
Horton said the tutors benefit, too.
"It is a painless form of review. I
probably learn more than my
students."
Better Balance
He is working with Cannom to
recruit tutors for subjects in great
demand. Cannom said two-thirds of
the requests are for science tutors. On
the other hand, some tutors apply and
never get called. Cannom hopes to
achieve a better balance, expanding
the number of people involved as well
as the range of subjects covered.
She said 66 students studied with
about 20 tutors last quarter, and she
expects twice as many requests this
quarter.
"Some of the students who need
help the most are not coming in,"
Cannom added. Often "B" students
come in to work for an "A." She
would like to see failing students come
in.
"It's all right not to know
everything. What I really would like to
do is eliminate any stigma attached to
getting tutoring."

departmental consultation center, or
he may tutor friends.
'How To Relate'
Tutor Judy Ain said a large part of
the practicum revolves around "how
to go about approaching people, how
to relate to people."
Tutors mentioned role-playing in
class as valuable in dealing with
students. Cannon said, "We discuss
what to do with a student who is
really leaning on a tutor, or a student
who really hates the material."
According to the tutors, the
students usually just want help
understanding the subject matter.
Gives Old Questions
"They don't really know what they
want to know. It's up to me to find
out," said Betsy Holland. She gives her
students old test questions and if they
cannot answer them, she finds
precisely where the problems lie.
Students might have specific
questions in mind, but usually cannot
get specific answers out of their tutors.
One student said, "Kven when I just
wanted the answer, my tutor insisted
that I struggle to find my own."
Physics tutor .Jonathan Horton
says, "Last quarter I was not just
trying to answer questions. I was
trying to guide my students through
the course."
Program Goals
Though improved grades is an
object of the program, Cannom said,
"that is by no means the only
measurement of the program's value.
You also should ask if the student
likes the subject better, if the tutoring
relationship has helped him."
Though she was disappointed in her

grade and is not taking chemistry again
this quarter, Suki Kitchell says,"The
tutoring was definitely helpful. It gave
me great security to know that I could
call someone any time I had a
problem. 1 felt good and worked really
hard. I just wish I had taken more
advantage of it."
Kitchell said her tutor, Kelly
Flanagan, made chemistry more fun
and meaningful for her. "She gave me
analogy games. She would give me a
baking problem to explain how to
work out a chemistry problem."
Flanagan said, "I had had a lot of
trouble with chemistry. So I used
myself as an example and showed her
how I learned it."
No Definite Conclusions
Tutors and students reported
increased understanding and improved
grades, although the LAC has not yet
come to any definite conclusions
based on the students' fall quarter
progress and final grades.
Most students praised their tutors.
A typical comment on a tutor
evaluation sheet was, "He made me
feel that no question was too small or

dumb to ask."
Horton said the tutors benefit, too.
"It is a painless form of review. I
probably learn more than my
students."
Better Balance
He is working with Cannom to
recruit tutors for subjects in great
demand. Cannom said two-thirds of
the requests are for science tutors. On
the other hand, some tutors apply and
never get called. Cannom hopes to
achieve a better balance, expanding
the number of people involved as well
as the range of subjects covered.
She said 66 students studied with
about 20 tutors last quarter, and she
expects twice as many requests this
quarter.
"Some of the students who need
help the most are not coming in,"
Cannom added. Often "B" students
come in to work for an "A." She
would like to see failing students come
in.
"It's all right not to know
everything. What I really would like to
do is eliminate any stigma attached to
getting tutoring."
A student having trouble in class may head to Meyer Library, but the
reason may not be to catch up on back reading. A peer tutoring service
there provided by the Learning Assistance Center (LAC) aids troubled
undergraduates.
Since the beginning of fall quarter, the LAC has provided free tutoring
for undergraduates having difficulty in specific courses. Tutoring
coordinator Sallie Cannom said the tutors, most of whom are
undergraduates themselves, receive academic credit for their work.
The LAC is under the auspices of the dean of undergraduate studies,
but has not been threatened by impending budget cuts in his office.
If a student is struggling with material in a particular course, an inquiry
at the LAC will bring the names of several qualified tutors.
The student must contact a tutor to arrange a meeting. "We want to be
helpful, but not meddlesome," Cannom said. The LAC, however, will
check back with the student to see if arrangements have been made.

IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM—The Learning Assistance Center in Meyer
Library concentrates on trying to help students who are struggling with
specific classes, says coordinator Sallie Cannom.
Prospective tutors fill out an
application form, which asks primarily
for a list of classes and grades they
have accumulated in their field. Once
accepted, they join Cannom's LAC
Tutoring Practicum 101, a
methodology class on tutoring.
Tutors receive one unit of credit for
the class and an additional unit for
every 30 hours of tutoring. A tutor
can acquire up to nine tutoring units,
all pass/no credit.
A tutor needn't work with a

problem. 1 felt good and worked really
hard. I just wish I had taken more
advantage of it."
Kitchell said her tutor, Kelly
Flanagan, made chemistry more fun
and meaningful for her. "She gave me
analogy games. She would give me a
baking problem to explain how to
work out a chemistry problem."
Flanagan said, "I had had a lot of
trouble with chemistry. So I used
myself as an example and showed her
how I learned it."
No Definite Conclusions
Tutors and students reported
increased understanding and improved
grades, although the LAC has not yet
come to any definite conclusions
based on the students' fall quarter
progress and final grades.
Most students praised their tutors.
A typical comment on a tutor
evaluation sheet was, "He made me
feel that no question was too small or

dumb to ask."
Horton said the tutors benefit, too.
"It is a painless form of review. I
probably learn more than my
students."
Better Balance
He is working with Cannom to
recruit tutors for subjects in great
demand. Cannom said two-thirds of
the requests are for science tutors. On
the other hand, some tutors apply and
never get called. Cannom hopes to
achieve a better balance, expanding
the number of people involved as well
as the range of subjects covered.
She said 66 students studied with
about 20 tutors last quarter, and she
expects twice as many requests this
quarter.
"Some of the students who need
help the most are not coming in,"
Cannom added. Often "B" students
come in to work for an "A." She
would like to see failing students come
in.
"It's all right not to know
everything. What I really would like to
do is eliminate any stigma attached to
getting tutoring."
A student having trouble in class may head to Meyer Library, but the
reason may not be to catch up on back reading. A peer tutoring service
there provided by the Learning Assistance Center (LAC) aids troubled
undergraduates.
Since the beginning of fall quarter, the LAC has provided free tutoring
for undergraduates having difficulty in specific courses. Tutoring
coordinator Sallie Cannom said the tutors, most of whom are
undergraduates themselves, receive academic credit for their work.
The LAC is under the auspices of the dean of undergraduate studies,
but has not been threatened by impending budget cuts in his office.
If a student is struggling with material in a particular course, an inquiry
at the LAC will bring the names of several qualified tutors.
The student must contact a tutor to arrange a meeting. "We want to be
helpful, but not meddlesome," Cannom said. The LAC, however, will
check back with the student to see if arrangements have been made.

IF YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM—The Learning Assistance Center in Meyer
Library concentrates on trying to help students who are struggling with
specific classes, says coordinator Sallie Cannom.
Prospective tutors fill out an
application form, which asks primarily
for a list of classes and grades they
have accumulated in their field. Once
accepted, they join Cannom's LAC
Tutoring Practicum 101, a
methodology class on tutoring.
Tutors receive one unit of credit for
the class and an additional unit for
every 30 hours of tutoring. A tutor
can acquire up to nine tutoring units,
all pass/no credit.
A tutor needn't work with a
student who contacts him through the
LAC. Cannom said he may work in a
departmental consultation center, or
he may tutor friends.
'How To Relate'
Tutor Judy Ain said a large part of
the practicum revolves around "how
to go about approaching people, how
to relate to people."
Tutors mentioned role-playing in
class as valuable in dealing with
students. Cannon said, "We discuss
what to do with a student who is
really leaning on a tutor, or a student
who really hates the material."
According to the tutors, the
students usually just want help
understanding the subject matter.
Gives Old Questions
"They don't really know what they
want to know. It's up to me to find
out," said Betsy Holland. She gives her
students old test questions and if they
cannot answer them, she finds
precisely where the problems lie.
Students might have specific
questions in mind, but usually cannot
get specific answers out of their tutors.
One student said, "Kven when I just
wanted the answer, my tutor insisted
that I struggle to find my own."
Physics tutor .Jonathan Horton
says, "Last quarter I was not just
trying to answer questions. I was
trying to guide my students through
the course."
Program Goals
Though improved grades is an
object of the program, Cannom said,
"that is by no means the only
measurement of the program's value.
You also should ask if the student
likes the subject better, if the tutoring
relationship has helped him."
Though she was disappointed in her

grade and is not taking chemistry again
this quarter, Suki Kitchell says,"The
tutoring was definitely helpful. It gave
me great security to know that I could
call someone any time I had a
problem. 1 felt good and worked really
hard. I just wish I had taken more
advantage of it."

Flanagan, made chemistry more fun
