### CHARLIE WHEELER 
HAYWARD-With 35 seconds
left in the game on Wednesday
night, the scoreboard read Visitors
45, Cal State-Hay ward 45. The
visitors were the Stanford
women's basketball team. They
had just taken the lead on Sukie
Jackson's basket.
The Cards' Kelly Thompson
dribbled down the right side of
the court. Seeing an opening, she
drove along the baseline for the
winning basket. After the Pioneers
missed a long jump shot, Stanford
guard Kathy Levinson ran out the
clock to preserve the Cards 47-45
victory.
The Hayward team was
shocked. They had won the game
at least twice. After eight minutes
of the first half, the Pioneers had
led the disorganized Cards, 16-4.
After losing that advantage, they
went up by 11 points with nine
minutes left in the game.
In the early going, Hayward
perforated the Stanford zone witn
their set offense. When the Cards
fell behind by 12, Stanford coach
Gay Coburn called time and
shifted her team into a pressing
man-to-man defense.
"We stopped their three set
plays, and after that they were
disorganized," said Coburn after
the game.

While the Pioneers' offense
slowed, the Stanford players
began to find their shooting
touch. Maggie Nelson, the Cards'
6-1 center, scored 10 points in as
many minutes to help cut the
deficit to one. It was Thompson,
however, who sparked the Cards
into a 29-24 halftime lead. She
pumped in six points in the last
1:16, including a shot at the
buzzer.
After its rush before
intermission, Stanford came out
ice-cold in the second period.
Hayward took the lead after five
minutes and stretched it to 11 as
the Cards managed only two
points in nearly 11 minutes.
Once again defense was the
difference as Hayward went
scoreless for six minutes. The
Cards began to move on offense
and defense. Kathy Levinson hit a
couple of long set shots and the
Cards converted four of six free
throws, moving into a 43-42 lead
with 3:40 left.
Hayward surged back into the
lead briefly, but they were unable
to overcome the Cards'
momentum.
The Stanford JV did not fare
so well against their Hayward
counterparts. Using a good zone
and aggressive offensive
rebounding, the Pioneers surged

to a 11-2 lead. The Cards began to
come back, but a pair of Hayward
fast breaks made the score 18-8
with eight minutes left in the first
half. Stanford managed to trim
the deficit to 20-15 at the half,
but following intermission
Hayward took command of the
game.
With depressing regularity, the
Cards would cut the lead to Six
points in the second half, but that
was as close as they would corrte.
The final JV score read Hayward
41, Stanford 35.

minutes and stretched it to 11 as
the Cards managed only two
points in nearly 11 minutes.
Once again defense was the
difference as Hayward went
scoreless for six minutes. The
Cards began to move on offense
and defense. Kathy Levinson hit a
couple of long set shots and the
Cards converted four of six free
throws, moving into a 43-42 lead
with 3:40 left.
Hayward surged back into the
lead briefly, but they were unable
to overcome the Cards'
momentum.
The Stanford JV did not fare
so well against their Hayward
counterparts. Using a good zone
and aggressive offensive
rebounding, the Pioneers surged

to a 11-2 lead. The Cards began to
come back, but a pair of Hayward
fast breaks made the score 18-8
with eight minutes left in the first
half. Stanford managed to trim
the deficit to 20-15 at the half,
but following intermission
Hayward took command of the
game.
With depressing regularity, the
Cards would cut the lead to Six
points in the second half, but that
was as close as they would corrte.
The final JV score read Hayward
41, Stanford 35.
HAYWARD-With 35 seconds
left in the game on Wednesday
night, the scoreboard read Visitors
45, Cal State-Hay ward 45. The
visitors were the Stanford
women's basketball team. They
had just taken the lead on Sukie
Jackson's basket.
The Cards' Kelly Thompson
dribbled down the right side of
the court. Seeing an opening, she
drove along the baseline for the
winning basket. After the Pioneers
missed a long jump shot, Stanford
guard Kathy Levinson ran out the
clock to preserve the Cards 47-45
victory.
The Hayward team was
shocked. They had won the game
at least twice. After eight minutes
of the first half, the Pioneers had
led the disorganized Cards, 16-4.
After losing that advantage, they
went up by 11 points with nine
minutes left in the game.
In the early going, Hayward
perforated the Stanford zone witn
their set offense. When the Cards
fell behind by 12, Stanford coach
Gay Coburn called time and
shifted her team into a pressing
man-to-man defense.
"We stopped their three set
plays, and after that they were
disorganized," said Coburn after
the game.

While the Pioneers' offense
slowed, the Stanford players
began to find their shooting
touch. Maggie Nelson, the Cards'
6-1 center, scored 10 points in as
many minutes to help cut the
deficit to one. It was Thompson,
however, who sparked the Cards
into a 29-24 halftime lead. She
pumped in six points in the last
1:16, including a shot at the
buzzer.
After its rush before
intermission, Stanford came out
ice-cold in the second period.
Hayward took the lead after five
