Ford Calls For Bipartisan Spirit
NEW YORK — Pre.iiient Ford said yesterday that
congressional interference i:, the conduct of U.S. diplomacy
is damaging U.S. foreign po'icy, is self-defea'ing and
violates the spirit of the Constitution.
In a speech prepared for a Republican fund-raising
dinner, Ford called on Congress to restore the bipartisan
spirit that marked American foreign policy in the years
after World War 11.
"In this difficult time the American people expect
responsible conduct from individual members of the
Congress and from the Congress as a whole, as well as from
the President," Ford said.
Ford's foreign policy address was several hours after he
carried the battle for his economy-energy program to Wall
Street, declaring, "We must not fight recessionary problems
with inflationary cures."
At the fund-raising dinner in honor of Vice President
Nelson A. Rockefeller, Ford pointed to several areas in
which he claimed Congress has not shown the necessary
responsibility in foreign affairs.
Negotiations sponsored by Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger to settle the Cyprus conflict "broke down
because of congressional insistence that military assistance
to Turkey be terminated," the President charged.
Turk ish StateProelaimed In Cyprus
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Turkish Cypriot leaders yesterday
proclaimed a separate state in northern Cyprus and offered
federation to the Greek Cypriots.
President Makarios of Cyprus said the unilateral move
"demonstrates utter contempt for the resolution of the
United Nations General Assembly and Security Council,"
and his government called for an urgent meeting of the
Security Council.
A statement said the i.?quest was made jointly with the
British government, which along with Greece and Turkey
is a guarantor of Cyprus' independence.
The proclamation gave Turkish Cypriots, who comprise
less than one-fifth of the island's population, control over
more than half of its natural resources — much of it
formerly owned by Greek Cypriots.
In Jerusalem, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said the
United States remains committed to the constitutional
government in Nicosia and "will make every effort to
encourage a peaceful solution."
Brezhnev Meets With Wilson
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Leonid L. Brezhnev, smiling,
joking and looking tanned and healthy, surfaced in public
yesterday for the first time in 51 days to hold talks with
British Prime Minister Harold Wilson.
Ending what is believed to have been the longest absence
from public view ever for a Soviet leader, the 68-year-old
Communist party chief received Wilson in the Kremlin,

where they laughed and traded quips as they posed for
photographers in a ehandelier-laden reception room.
It was th<> first visit by a British prime minister to
Moscow in seven years and was aimed at improving
relations gore chilly since Britain expelled 105 Soviet
officials in 1971 on spy charges.
For reasons never announced, Brezhnev passed up talks
with a number of visiting political officials since his last
appearance Dec. 24, when he attended a session of the
Russian Federation Parliament. He also postponed a
scheduled visit to Cairo, touching off speculation he was
either ill or had run into foreign policy problems with
Kremlin hardliners.
Court Rejects Sirhan Petition
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme Court
yesterday turned down the petition of Sirhan B. Sirhan,
convicted assassin of Sen. Robert E. Kennedy, to reopen
the case and grant him a new trial.
The court's action came in a brief ruling which said it
denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
Kissinger Ends Egyptian Talks
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
wound up talks with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
yesterday, had a "friendly and constructive" five-hour
session with Syrian President Hafez Assad and then went
back to Israel on his Middle East mission.
Before leaving Damascus, Kissinger said he and Assad
discussed details of a just and lasting peace in the Middle
East and Syria's "indispensable" role in a final solution of
the problem. A Syrian spokesman said bilateral relations
between Syria and the United States also figured high on
the agenda, but gave no details.
Kissinger's current mission is exploratory and he plans to
return to the Middle East around March 10. A senior U.S.
official said that at that time Kissinger plans to go first to
Cairo to work out details of a sizable Israeli pullback in
exchange for moves by Egypt toward acceptance of the
Jewish state.
U.S. officials said an agreement would involve a
document signer! by both Egypt and Israel and hinted that
o.ie element of the .settlement would involve replacing the
oil Israel would lose by giving up the Israeli-occupied Abu
Rudeis oil fields.
Kissinger confers with the Shah of Iran in Zurich,
Switzerland next Tuesday. Iran, which has been Israel's
only foreign supplier, apparently would guarantee to make
up the losses, with the United States the backup source in
the event of an emergency.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. A little cooler. Highs in
the 50s. Lows in the upper 30s to mid 40s. West to
northwest winds 10 to 20 mph.

Kissinger Ends Egyptian Talks
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
wound up talks with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
yesterday, had a "friendly and constructive" five-hour
session with Syrian President Hafez Assad and then went
back to Israel on his Middle East mission.
Before leaving Damascus, Kissinger said he and Assad
discussed details of a just and lasting peace in the Middle
East and Syria's "indispensable" role in a final solution of
the problem. A Syrian spokesman said bilateral relations
between Syria and the United States also figured high on
the agenda, but gave no details.
Kissinger's current mission is exploratory and he plans to
return to the Middle East around March 10. A senior U.S.
official said that at that time Kissinger plans to go first to
Cairo to work out details of a sizable Israeli pullback in
exchange for moves by Egypt toward acceptance of the
Jewish state.
U.S. officials said an agreement would involve a
document signer! by both Egypt and Israel and hinted that
o.ie element of the .settlement would involve replacing the
oil Israel would lose by giving up the Israeli-occupied Abu
Rudeis oil fields.
Kissinger confers with the Shah of Iran in Zurich,
Switzerland next Tuesday. Iran, which has been Israel's
only foreign supplier, apparently would guarantee to make
up the losses, with the United States the backup source in
the event of an emergency.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow. A little cooler. Highs in
the 50s. Lows in the upper 30s to mid 40s. West to
northwest winds 10 to 20 mph.
Ford Calls For Bipartisan Spirit
NEW YORK — Pre.iiient Ford said yesterday that
congressional interference i:, the conduct of U.S. diplomacy
is damaging U.S. foreign po'icy, is self-defea'ing and
violates the spirit of the Constitution.
In a speech prepared for a Republican fund-raising
dinner, Ford called on Congress to restore the bipartisan
spirit that marked American foreign policy in the years
after World War 11.
"In this difficult time the American people expect
responsible conduct from individual members of the
Congress and from the Congress as a whole, as well as from
the President," Ford said.
Ford's foreign policy address was several hours after he
carried the battle for his economy-energy program to Wall
Street, declaring, "We must not fight recessionary problems
with inflationary cures."
At the fund-raising dinner in honor of Vice President
Nelson A. Rockefeller, Ford pointed to several areas in
which he claimed Congress has not shown the necessary
responsibility in foreign affairs.
Negotiations sponsored by Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger to settle the Cyprus conflict "broke down
because of congressional insistence that military assistance
to Turkey be terminated," the President charged.
Turk ish StateProelaimed In Cyprus
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Turkish Cypriot leaders yesterday
proclaimed a separate state in northern Cyprus and offered
federation to the Greek Cypriots.
President Makarios of Cyprus said the unilateral move
"demonstrates utter contempt for the resolution of the
United Nations General Assembly and Security Council,"
and his government called for an urgent meeting of the
Security Council.
A statement said the i.?quest was made jointly with the
British government, which along with Greece and Turkey
is a guarantor of Cyprus' independence.
The proclamation gave Turkish Cypriots, who comprise
less than one-fifth of the island's population, control over
more than half of its natural resources — much of it
formerly owned by Greek Cypriots.
In Jerusalem, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said the
United States remains committed to the constitutional
government in Nicosia and "will make every effort to
encourage a peaceful solution."

Ford's foreign policy address was several hours after he
carried the battle for his economy-energy program to Wall
Street, declaring, "We must not fight recessionary problems
with inflationary cures."
At the fund-raising dinner in honor of Vice President
Nelson A. Rockefeller, Ford pointed to several areas in
which he claimed Congress has not shown the necessary
responsibility in foreign affairs.
Negotiations sponsored by Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger to settle the Cyprus conflict "broke down
because of congressional insistence that military assistance
to Turkey be terminated," the President charged.
Turk ish StateProelaimed In Cyprus
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Turkish Cypriot leaders yesterday
proclaimed a separate state in northern Cyprus and offered
federation to the Greek Cypriots.
President Makarios of Cyprus said the unilateral move
"demonstrates utter contempt for the resolution of the
United Nations General Assembly and Security Council,"
and his government called for an urgent meeting of the
Security Council.
A statement said the i.?quest was made jointly with the
British government, which along with Greece and Turkey
is a guarantor of Cyprus' independence.
The proclamation gave Turkish Cypriots, who comprise
less than one-fifth of the island's population, control over
more than half of its natural resources — much of it
formerly owned by Greek Cypriots.
In Jerusalem, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said the
United States remains committed to the constitutional
government in Nicosia and "will make every effort to
encourage a peaceful solution."
Brezhnev Meets With Wilson
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Leonid L. Brezhnev, smiling,
joking and looking tanned and healthy, surfaced in public
yesterday for the first time in 51 days to hold talks with
British Prime Minister Harold Wilson.
Ending what is believed to have been the longest absence
from public view ever for a Soviet leader, the 68-year-old
Communist party chief received Wilson in the Kremlin,

where they laughed and traded quips as they posed for
photographers in a ehandelier-laden reception room.
It was th<> first visit by a British prime minister to
Moscow in seven years and was aimed at improving
relations gore chilly since Britain expelled 105 Soviet
officials in 1971 on spy charges.
For reasons never announced, Brezhnev passed up talks
with a number of visiting political officials since his last
appearance Dec. 24, when he attended a session of the
Russian Federation Parliament. He also postponed a
scheduled visit to Cairo, touching off speculation he was
either ill or had run into foreign policy problems with
Kremlin hardliners.
Court Rejects Sirhan Petition
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme Court
yesterday turned down the petition of Sirhan B. Sirhan,
convicted assassin of Sen. Robert E. Kennedy, to reopen
the case and grant him a new trial.
The court's action came in a brief ruling which said it
denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
Kissinger Ends Egyptian Talks
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
wound up talks with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
yesterday, had a "friendly and constructive" five-hour
session with Syrian President Hafez Assad and then went
back to Israel on his Middle East mission.
Before leaving Damascus, Kissinger said he and Assad
discussed details of a just and lasting peace in the Middle
East and Syria's "indispensable" role in a final solution of
the problem. A Syrian spokesman said bilateral relations
between Syria and the United States also figured high on
the agenda, but gave no details.
Kissinger's current mission is exploratory and he plans to
return to the Middle East around March 10. A senior U.S.
official said that at that time Kissinger plans to go first to
Cairo to work out details of a sizable Israeli pullback in
exchange for moves by Egypt toward acceptance of the
Jewish state.
U.S. officials said an agreement would involve a
document signer! by both Egypt and Israel and hinted that
o.ie element of the .settlement would involve replacing the
oil Israel would lose by giving up the Israeli-occupied Abu
Rudeis oil fields.
Kissinger confers with the Shah of Iran in Zurich,
Switzerland next Tuesday. Iran, which has been Israel's
only foreign supplier, apparently would guarantee to make
up the losses, with the United States the backup source in
the event of an emergency.
