# Employers: 'We Want Generalists'

For students majoring in Tibetan
History or Medieval French, there is a
way to improve post-graduation job
opportunities, according to a panel of
businessmen and student leaders
assembled at Tresidder Union last
night.
Extracurricular campus activities
can play a major role in securing a job
after graduation. However, they are
"one area that has been neglected by
many students" when making plans
for the future, said Marty Ittner,
assistant director of the student
employment office at the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
Business representatives present on
the panel, from such fields as
publishing, accounting and
broadcasting, agreed that a particular
activity is not as important as the
breadth of involvement.
Daniel Murphy of
Foremost-McKesson, which markets
food products, said, "We're interested
in generalists. Any part of the
storehouse of knowledge a student can
bring to bear in the business is good."
Most importantly, campus activities
prepare a student by giving him
experience in planning, organizing and
getting things done, said Murphy.
IBM's George Murray said he feels
"the quality of participation is more

important than the nature of the
activity. It's important that you did
something, and did it well." His advice
to the audience was to "participate in
those things you enjoy, and enjoy
them."
Breadth Of Interests
Mary Ord, from the editorial offices
of Sunset magazine, said she looks for
breadth of interests in an applicant.
She noted that a magazine can well use
people of differing interests, who can
each add something unique to the
magazine's editorial content. She
mentioned theater and farming as two
such diverse interests.
Such good news for liberal arts
students was tempered by some
guidelines on what businessmen like to
see in an applicant's background.
"We're looking for activities which
involve interaction with people," said
Gary Belati, of Price, Waterhouse and
Co., and accounting firm. He added,
"We prefer activities that have specific
goals involved."
'Relevant Activity'
Richard Block, who recently began
his own broadcasting firm, agreed. "I
look for the relevant activity," he said,
adding that he doesn't approve of
getting involved only to pile up
credentials. "Don't get involved in that
treadmill of 'I have 19 activities so
I'm going to Harvard, Stanford, or

Yale,' or 'I have 17 so I'll go to
Berkeley or Davis,' " he said.
Valuable experience from
extracurricular activities included the
cooperation necessary in organizations
and clubs and, in some cases, writing
ability, the panelists said. The ability
to communicate was repeatedly
pointed out as a necessary skill in
business, one provided by many
campus activities.
Murray said he looks for
"participants" as opposed to
"spectators." He added, "We're
looking for people who enjoy
competition."
Prudence A Key
"How prudent a person you are,"
and "how steady you were," were
cited as areas of interest to
employers." Prudence, for Block,
means being employed whenever
possible and being economically
stable. "I like to see that you earned
the money to go to Europe."
Steadiness in activities indicates a

dedication and true interest, he said.
Ord said that starting a club of
one's own is particularly impressive.
*'We look at the responsibilities a
student has had the initiative to take
on," she said, adding that these
responsibilities can be found in
anything from campus publications to
sports. Other panelists also approved
heartily of participation in sports.
ASSU President Mike Herman, also
on the panel, cited the value of
extracurricular activities. In student
organizations, he said, "You're forced
to make decisions, which is something
that doesn't happen in the classroom."
One can also "expand to do something
practical," such as gain teaching
experience, or gain the "ability to help
people."
Suzi Harmatz, active in several
student organizations and chairperson
of the Committee on Services to
Students, said participation in
activities helps one to "learn to get
things done. It gives you a certain kind
of confidence."
