# University Warns Frat On Problems
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity has
again been warned to curb the actions
of its members, according to Larry
Ilorton and Norman Robinson of the
dean of student affairs office.
The fraternity was suspended from
campus two years ago for a one-year
period after University officials
concluded that its members were
causing disturbances.
"I expressed concern because I
wanted to avoid problems before they
got out of hand," Robinson said. "I'm
concerned that the disturbances don't
reach the magnitude that they did two
years ago."
Horton, associate dean, emphasized
that "at this moment, nothing is afoot
to remove the Delt house from
campus."
Loud Behavior
According to Delta Tau Delta
Chairman John Carroll, the warning
was issued in response to the loud
behavior of some members during the
past few nights.
He added that in recent weeks,
members have also thrown beer kegs
out of closed windows and dented car
hoods, but insisted that the activities
were the work of "just a couple of
guys who don't have any concern for
other people."
Delta Tau Delta President Kevin
McDermott denied that any kegs had
been thrown out of windows.
A resident of nearby Synergy house
told the Daily yesterday that "there
was an incredible hurling of insults
between Delt members and Zeta Psi
members for two hours a few nights
ago on the roof of the Delt house."
The resident, who refused to
identify himself, said that the
"rambunctious yelling" disturbed
Synergy residents. He charged that
Delta Tau Delta members recently
broke two street lamps between the
Delt house and Synergy.
"But the Delts are usually pretty

good," he added. "And being students,
we don't mind a lot of the noise."
Robinson, the Row director, said
that he called McDermott into his
office on Wednesday to tell him that
the University will be forced to take
disciplinary action against the house if
the disturbances are not halted.
"The ideal situation is for a
fraternity to discipline its own
members," Robinson explained,
noting that he hoped that the
fraternity would consider expelling its
own rowdy members if they do not
stop their destructiveness.
According to Carroll, the Delts will
consider expelling certain members if
they do not conform to the
fraternity's attempts to quiet their
activities.
McDermott told the Daily that he
repeated Robinson's warning at two
house meetings.
He claimed that Robinson issued
similar warnings to other fraternities,
especially Zeta Psi.
No Recent Discussions
But Zeta Psi President Ron
Pellegrini claimed that no
administrator has discussed such
problems with fraternity members
since October. Robinson agreed that
there have been no recent complaints
about behavior at Zeta Psi, but added
that he issues "expressions of
concern" to fraternities almost as a
matter of course.
Interfraternity Council President
Mike Nilsson last night said that as far
as he knows, only Delta Tau Delta has
been warned to curb its rowdiness.
McDermott also said that he was
called into Robinson's office to discuss
a "personal matter" concerning one
member and that discussion of the
problems was only a very secondary
topic.
But Robinson said that he called
McDermott into his office to discuss
the breaking of a street lamp by a Delt
member. After McDermott agreed that
the member should be forced to pay
repair costs, Robinson said that he
"expressed concern" about the
problems at the Delt house.
Both Robinson and McDermott
insisted that there is no immediate
danger of the frat being expelled.
But Delta Tau Delta member Rich
Merlo said last night that in light of
the expulsion two years ago, he would
not be surprised if the fraternity were
suspended again. Carroll agreed with
him.
Merlo emphasized that only a few
members have been rowdy and
claimed that part of what has been
considered destruction at the Delt
house is the result of faulty
construction.
Delta Tau Delta was suspended
from campus in May, 1973 for two
years, but was allowed to return last
fall after the University administration
decided that it had halted its
misconduct.
The fraternity was suspended after
residents of Synergy and Theta Xi
charged that Delta members had
thrown bottles and rocks through
open windows and shot pellets at open
cars.

activities.
McDermott told the Daily that he
repeated Robinson's warning at two
house meetings.
He claimed that Robinson issued
similar warnings to other fraternities,
especially Zeta Psi.
No Recent Discussions
But Zeta Psi President Ron
Pellegrini claimed that no
administrator has discussed such
problems with fraternity members
since October. Robinson agreed that
there have been no recent complaints
about behavior at Zeta Psi, but added
that he issues "expressions of
concern" to fraternities almost as a
matter of course.
Interfraternity Council President
Mike Nilsson last night said that as far
as he knows, only Delta Tau Delta has
been warned to curb its rowdiness.
McDermott also said that he was
called into Robinson's office to discuss
a "personal matter" concerning one
member and that discussion of the
problems was only a very secondary
topic.
But Robinson said that he called
McDermott into his office to discuss
the breaking of a street lamp by a Delt
member. After McDermott agreed that
the member should be forced to pay
repair costs, Robinson said that he
"expressed concern" about the
problems at the Delt house.
Both Robinson and McDermott
insisted that there is no immediate
danger of the frat being expelled.
But Delta Tau Delta member Rich
Merlo said last night that in light of
the expulsion two years ago, he would
not be surprised if the fraternity were
suspended again. Carroll agreed with
him.
Merlo emphasized that only a few
members have been rowdy and
claimed that part of what has been
considered destruction at the Delt
house is the result of faulty
construction.
Delta Tau Delta was suspended
from campus in May, 1973 for two
years, but was allowed to return last
fall after the University administration
decided that it had halted its
misconduct.
The fraternity was suspended after
residents of Synergy and Theta Xi
charged that Delta members had
thrown bottles and rocks through
open windows and shot pellets at open
cars.
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity has
again been warned to curb the actions
of its members, according to Larry
Ilorton and Norman Robinson of the
dean of student affairs office.
The fraternity was suspended from
campus two years ago for a one-year
period after University officials
concluded that its members were
causing disturbances.
"I expressed concern because I
wanted to avoid problems before they
got out of hand," Robinson said. "I'm
concerned that the disturbances don't
reach the magnitude that they did two
years ago."
Horton, associate dean, emphasized
that "at this moment, nothing is afoot
to remove the Delt house from
campus."
Loud Behavior
According to Delta Tau Delta
Chairman John Carroll, the warning
was issued in response to the loud
behavior of some members during the
past few nights.
He added that in recent weeks,
members have also thrown beer kegs
out of closed windows and dented car
hoods, but insisted that the activities
were the work of "just a couple of
guys who don't have any concern for
other people."
Delta Tau Delta President Kevin
McDermott denied that any kegs had
been thrown out of windows.
A resident of nearby Synergy house
told the Daily yesterday that "there
was an incredible hurling of insults
between Delt members and Zeta Psi
members for two hours a few nights
ago on the roof of the Delt house."
The resident, who refused to
identify himself, said that the
"rambunctious yelling" disturbed
Synergy residents. He charged that
Delta Tau Delta members recently
broke two street lamps between the
Delt house and Synergy.
"But the Delts are usually pretty

good," he added. "And being students,
we don't mind a lot of the noise."
Robinson, the Row director, said
that he called McDermott into his
office on Wednesday to tell him that
the University will be forced to take
disciplinary action against the house if
the disturbances are not halted.
"The ideal situation is for a
fraternity to discipline its own
members," Robinson explained,
noting that he hoped that the
fraternity would consider expelling its
own rowdy members if they do not
stop their destructiveness.
According to Carroll, the Delts will
consider expelling certain members if
they do not conform to the
fraternity's attempts to quiet their
activities.
McDermott told the Daily that he
repeated Robinson's warning at two
house meetings.
