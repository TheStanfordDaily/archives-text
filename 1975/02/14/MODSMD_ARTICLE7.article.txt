# Prof. Brown Denied Visit To Vietnam
## 
### 
Religious Studies Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown, widely known for his
dovish views on the Vietnam War, was
denied admission to South Vietnam
Wednesday when the country's San
Francisco consulate rejected his
application for a visa.
"They [the consulate officials!
made it clear that the reasons for the
denial were political," Brown said.
"Apparently I am included among
those people who would make
unfavorable comments about the
( Nguyen Van Thieu) regime."
Brown had planned to visit South
Vietnam to look for methods for the
"creative reconstruction" of the
country, he said. Instead, Brown will
tour Thailand and Laos.
A final conference in Laos,
sponsored by the World Council of
Churches, will discuss projects for the
reconstruction of Southeast Asia.
"The funding will come from all parts
of the world." Brown said.
He stressed that solutions would be
sought "without politics involved."
Forty Southeast Asian
representatives will attend the
conference, including a team from
North Vietnam. Brown said he is one
of 10 Americans making the trip.
Brown left late last night for
Southeast Asia and hopes to return on
Feb. 28.
