In recent weeks, we have seen a trend of increasing arrogance by
University officials toward the student body. On two issues — parking
and housing - the administration has not only taken stands
disagreeable to much of the student body, but treated students in a
most disrespectful manner.
President Richard Lyman seems miffed that the ASSU Senate has
dared to take the University to court on the issue of the $7.50 student
parking fee.
"The Senate's action on the whole matter seem more than mildly
inconsistent," Lyman said, indicating he would prefer that the
University decision-making process — which ends on his desk — be
allowed to run its course.
We agree with ASSU Senate Chairman Lee Rosenbaum that Lyman
is attempting to serve as both "prosecutor and judge." From the
beginning, Lyman has held a prejudice on the parking issue. In
Rosenbaum's words, Lyman is "asking us to rely on internal
administration to solve our problems equitably, while at the same
time, the same administration is working against us."
We still think that the students' best method of protesting the
parking fee is to fight every ticket in court. We also support the ASSU
Senate's class-action suit since it has been brought about by a
well-founded distrust of the administration's ability to make a fair
decision.
The solution to the fraternity/sorority issue, as interpreted by
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons, shows similar arrogance.
Lyons stated that if students lodge a formal complaint with the
University, charging that it discriminates against women because it
allows fraternities but not sororities, "we will deny subjectivity rights
completely." Such a move would kill the present fraternity system.
In other words, Lyons is saying "be happy with what you've got or
we'll take it away."
We doubt the University would have taken such stands as these
three years ago, when students would have violently protested them.
We hope that the relative lack of student activism at this time does
not encourage the administration to continue to make decisions which
show contempt for student opinion.
