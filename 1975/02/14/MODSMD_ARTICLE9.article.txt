Introducing James Gibbs'
"better mix of minority
students."
His memo identifies them as
students "more attuned to the
intellectual goals and elitist
nature" of Stanford who promise
not to "spend too much time
trying to turn the institution
around."
You shouldn't have been
surprised by that memo. It
reflects the ideology which has
guided Stanford's administration
for a long time. This ideology was
a response to political activism.
Political protest at Stanford
centered around the University's
ties to the military and the issue
of community control. Research
done at Stanford for the
Department of Defense (DOD)
contributed to the weapons
technology which enabled the
U.S. to replace men with
machines and turn Vietnam into a
" Vietnamized" electronic
battlefield.
The military recruited at the
Placement Center and had a
ROTC program on campus. War
corporations also recruited at the
Placement Center and housed
themselves in Stanford's Industrial
Park. Stanford invested over 200
million dollars in the stocks and
bonds of many of these
companies.
These activities still continue
today, and most of the activists
are gone. The members of the
Board of Trustees of Stanford are
a group of the most rich and
powerful corporate people in
America, representing many of
the war corporations. They also
happen to be the people who
make the major policy decisions
for the entire Stanford
community.

Yale, Williams

Neither the Trustees nor
wealthy alumni liked what was
happening at Stanford. Financial
contributions to the University
diminished. The pressure was on
the administration.
In this context, the meaning of
"a better minority mix" becomes
self-explanatory. It is a
euphemism for students who will
not threaten the status quo. And
it is this same motive which
underlies the proposed
SWOPSI-SCIRE-Urban Studies
cuts and the controversy over the
grading system.
SWOPSI represents a double
threat. Workshops like the one
which produced a report on DOD
research at Stanford are contrary
to the interests of Stanford's
policy makers.
Equally important is the charge
that SWOPSI is not "academic
enough." Low academic standards
also underlie the debate over high
grade-point averages. Associate
Dean Mason Yearian tells us we
should reinstate the drop deadline
so students won't "just drift
through Stanford."
And therein lies the lesson.
Students busy for grades don't
have time for political activities.
Career-oriented students don't
take SWOPSI courses which offer
alternative perspectives not in the
interests of the Stanford
administration or Board of
Trustees. And a highly
"academic" student body and
curriculum combined with a
research-oriented faculty is the
best way to insure that no one
ever rocks the boat again.

students."
His memo identifies them as
students "more attuned to the
intellectual goals and elitist
nature" of Stanford who promise
not to "spend too much time
trying to turn the institution
around."
You shouldn't have been
surprised by that memo. It
reflects the ideology which has
guided Stanford's administration
for a long time. This ideology was
a response to political activism.
Political protest at Stanford
centered around the University's
ties to the military and the issue
of community control. Research
done at Stanford for the
Department of Defense (DOD)
contributed to the weapons
technology which enabled the
U.S. to replace men with
machines and turn Vietnam into a
" Vietnamized" electronic
battlefield.
The military recruited at the
Placement Center and had a
ROTC program on campus. War
corporations also recruited at the
Placement Center and housed
themselves in Stanford's Industrial
Park. Stanford invested over 200
million dollars in the stocks and
bonds of many of these
companies.
These activities still continue
today, and most of the activists
are gone. The members of the
Board of Trustees of Stanford are
a group of the most rich and
powerful corporate people in
America, representing many of
the war corporations. They also
happen to be the people who
make the major policy decisions
for the entire Stanford
community.

Yale, Williams

Neither the Trustees nor
wealthy alumni liked what was
happening at Stanford. Financial
contributions to the University
diminished. The pressure was on
the administration.
In this context, the meaning of
"a better minority mix" becomes
self-explanatory. It is a
euphemism for students who will
not threaten the status quo. And
it is this same motive which
underlies the proposed
SWOPSI-SCIRE-Urban Studies
cuts and the controversy over the
grading system.
SWOPSI represents a double
threat. Workshops like the one
which produced a report on DOD
research at Stanford are contrary
to the interests of Stanford's
policy makers.
Equally important is the charge
that SWOPSI is not "academic
enough." Low academic standards
also underlie the debate over high
grade-point averages. Associate
Dean Mason Yearian tells us we
should reinstate the drop deadline
so students won't "just drift
through Stanford."
And therein lies the lesson.
Students busy for grades don't
have time for political activities.
Career-oriented students don't
take SWOPSI courses which offer
alternative perspectives not in the
interests of the Stanford
administration or Board of
Trustees. And a highly
"academic" student body and
curriculum combined with a
research-oriented faculty is the
best way to insure that no one
ever rocks the boat again.
