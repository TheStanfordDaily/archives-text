# Battling Our Bungling Bureaucracy
## 
### John Freed 
I've got this friend named Peter Miller.
Actually, he'd be embarrassed unless you
called him "Spike."
Spike grew up in New York City, went to
high school there where his grades were good
enough to get him into Stanford.
Now that he's here, he doesn't think
Stanford is all it's cracked up to be.
Nobody Special
"I'm nothing special — just your typical
5-8, dark-haired brown-eyed frustrated jock,"
Spike told me the other day, "so I don't
expect any special treatment."
Curious, I asked him what kind of
treatment he had, been getting.
It seems Spike's troubles began one day
early in November when he walked into the
Registrar's Office and told them he'd
changed his address.
Six Notifications
Spike, more than a little annoyed,
informed the secretary that he had already
sent in six change-of-address forms and was
simply wondering why the University had
decided to stop sending him mail.
"You've been put on academic
probation," the smiling secretary told him.
"We sent you three or four letters asking you
to tell us your side of the story, but you
haven't responded to any of them."
The secretary did manage to dig up a copy
of Spike's study list, which had also been
sent to the wrong address. One of his courses
was listed as Econ 150. There is no Econ
150.
Housing Blues
It was a couple of weeks before his next
run-in with the Stanford Bureaucracy. Three
of his Manzanita trailermates decided to go
overseas for winter quarter.

Not wanting to leave his happy hovel,
Spike traipsed over to the Single Student
Housing Office, where he got a list of eligible
off-campus replacements.
Twenty-seven phone calls later, he had
finally gotten three good souls to move in
with him. He forwarded their names to the
housing office. Staffers there immediately
called one of his choices and convinced him
not to enter Manzanita.

Spike got the news in the middle of finals
week that the housing office planned to
relocate him "for the good of the system."
As he took off for New York for Christmas,
he had no idea where he would be staying
this quarter.
Understandably, Spike's father was a little
upset about the Stanford Shuffle. He placed
a long-distance call here, and convinced the
housing office to give Spike a $100 rebate on
his room rent.
When Spike got back after the break, he
found out that he had been assigned to a new
trailer in Manzanita with three total
strangers. He asked the housing office to
refund him the $100 it promised.

"Oh, we didn't promise you $100," a
smiling secretary told Spike. "We'll give you
$50 instead."
His head swimming from that doubletalk,
Spike vowed not to talk to any smiling
secretaries ever again. At least not until
spring quarter.
But frustration appeared from a new
source just the other day. Wednesday was
deadline day for canceling out on spring
charter flights to New York. On that day,
Spike went into the ASSU Travel Service,
where he was met by a smiling student
secretary.
Uncertain Timing
Spike explained that he was planning job
interviews in New York, so he didn't know
whether his schedule would permit him to
use the charters.
"Don't worry," the secretary told him.
"Just come in tomorrow and let us know."
He dutifully returned Thursday afternoon
and told the same secretary that he would
have to cancel his reservation on the charter
flight.
Tough Luck
"Oh, then you'll have to find a
replacement," he was told. "Or else, forfeit
your $50 deposit. The deadline for
cancellation was yesterday, you know."
Spike explained that he had been the one
who came in the day before. The secretary
just smiled.
"I'm sorry, no exceptions," she finally
said.
It's the little things that get you down.

charter flights to New York. On that day,
Spike went into the ASSU Travel Service,
where he was met by a smiling student
secretary.
Uncertain Timing
Spike explained that he was planning job
interviews in New York, so he didn't know
whether his schedule would permit him to
use the charters.
"Don't worry," the secretary told him.
"Just come in tomorrow and let us know."
He dutifully returned Thursday afternoon
and told the same secretary that he would
have to cancel his reservation on the charter
flight.
Tough Luck
"Oh, then you'll have to find a
replacement," he was told. "Or else, forfeit
your $50 deposit. The deadline for
cancellation was yesterday, you know."
Spike explained that he had been the one
who came in the day before. The secretary
just smiled.
"I'm sorry, no exceptions," she finally
said.
It's the little things that get you down.

editorial board. His column appears every

I've got this friend named Peter Miller.
Actually, he'd be embarrassed unless you
called him "Spike."
Spike grew up in New York City, went to
high school there where his grades were good
enough to get him into Stanford.
Now that he's here, he doesn't think
Stanford is all it's cracked up to be.
Nobody Special
"I'm nothing special — just your typical
5-8, dark-haired brown-eyed frustrated jock,"
Spike told me the other day, "so I don't
expect any special treatment."
Curious, I asked him what kind of
treatment he had, been getting.
It seems Spike's troubles began one day
early in November when he walked into the
Registrar's Office and told them he'd
changed his address.
Six Notifications
Spike, more than a little annoyed,
informed the secretary that he had already
sent in six change-of-address forms and was
simply wondering why the University had
decided to stop sending him mail.
"You've been put on academic
probation," the smiling secretary told him.
"We sent you three or four letters asking you
to tell us your side of the story, but you
haven't responded to any of them."
The secretary did manage to dig up a copy
of Spike's study list, which had also been
sent to the wrong address. One of his courses
was listed as Econ 150. There is no Econ
150.
Housing Blues
It was a couple of weeks before his next
run-in with the Stanford Bureaucracy. Three
of his Manzanita trailermates decided to go
overseas for winter quarter.

Not wanting to leave his happy hovel,
Spike traipsed over to the Single Student
Housing Office, where he got a list of eligible
off-campus replacements.
Twenty-seven phone calls later, he had
finally gotten three good souls to move in
with him. He forwarded their names to the
housing office. Staffers there immediately
called one of his choices and convinced him
not to enter Manzanita.

Spike got the news in the middle of finals
week that the housing office planned to
relocate him "for the good of the system."
As he took off for New York for Christmas,
he had no idea where he would be staying
this quarter.
Understandably, Spike's father was a little
upset about the Stanford Shuffle. He placed
a long-distance call here, and convinced the
housing office to give Spike a $100 rebate on
his room rent.
When Spike got back after the break, he
found out that he had been assigned to a new
trailer in Manzanita with three total
strangers. He asked the housing office to
refund him the $100 it promised.

"Oh, we didn't promise you $100," a
smiling secretary told Spike. "We'll give you
$50 instead."
His head swimming from that doubletalk,
Spike vowed not to talk to any smiling
secretaries ever again. At least not until
spring quarter.
But frustration appeared from a new
source just the other day. Wednesday was
deadline day for canceling out on spring
charter flights to New York. On that day,
Spike went into the ASSU Travel Service,
where he was met by a smiling student
secretary.
