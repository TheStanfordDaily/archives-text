# Chavez Exploits Farm Workers
## Peter J. Ferroro

for many years Cesar Chavez
has asked the public to boycott
grapes, lettuce, and more recently
Gallo wine to help farmworkers
unionize. In response to this plea,
he has often received massive
support, particularly from college
and university students.
But the truth is that Chavez
has won most of this support by
mere factual misrepresentation.
He and his organizers have
misrepresented to the public the
working and living conditions of
the farmworkers, their wages, the
role of the growers, and the

degree of Chavez support among
farmworkers.
For example, Chavez has been
successful in convincing the public
that the nation's farmworkers are
migrants following crops from
harvest to harvest. But actually
very few farmworkers are
migrants. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture reports that migrant
workers comprise less than eight
percent of all farmworkers. In
California less than nine percent
of the farm work force is migrant
and less than four percent come
from out of state.

Another subject that Chavez
and his supporters have
misrepresented is farmworkers'
wages. In 1972 United Farm
Workers (UFW) vice-president
Dolores Huerta reported on public
television, that "the average
earnings of a farmworker in the
U.S. are only $1400 a year."
Wages Aren't Low
But the wages of grape and
lettuce workers, for whom Chavez
has asked us to boycott, are not
sub-standard. Most grape and
lettuce workers receive a base pay
hourly wage plus a piece rate paid
for each box of grapes or lettuce
that they pick. The California
Bureau of Food and Agriculture
reports that lettuce workers
averaged $6.44 an hour with piece
rates in 1972. Payroll records on
file with the Internal Revenue
Service and Federal Wage and
Hour Commission show that
lettuce workers averaged from
$5.70 to $7.41 an hour in 1972.
The Washington Post reported in
August, 1972 that lettuce workers
earn as much as $12,000 a year,
rarely less than $5000 or $6000.
The contract with the
Teamster's union for Gallo's grape
workers provides for a minimum
wage of $2.89 an hour, with an
increase to $3.03 an hour in May.
Employee-signed payroll records
and check stubs show that during
the harvest season Gallo workers
averaged $5.79 an hour with piece
rates. These same records show
that Gallo's 200 fulltime grape
workers averaged $7785 in 1973.
A UFW pamphlet reports that
Gallo's wages are standard for the
grape industry.
Few Workers Strike
Chavez's most vicious
misrepresentation has been his
claim of worker support. In 1965

Chavez called his first strike in
Delano, Calif., the center of the
nation's table grape industry.
Press releases from UFW
headquarters announced that the
strike was the largest in
agricultural history with 5000
workers walking off the job.
Later, under oath, Director of
the Cal. Dept. of Employment
Albert Tieburg reported that only
55 workers had gone on strike.
But Chavez maintained the
appearance of a strike by
gathering outside supporters to
man the picket lines. Most of
these were college students
belonging to the Berkeley Free
Speech Movement, Student
Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee and Students for a
Democratic Society. The
farmworkers, however, continued
working.
The truth is that Chavez's
strike was a complete hoax. There
was no strike and there was no
more than a handful of workers in
his United Farm Workers Union.
His strikes have been no more
successful since then.
Chavez Lacks Support
Because Chavez's strikes have
been massive failures he has
turned to the boycott. If he had
the support of the workers there
would be no need for a boycott.
The reason for the boycott,
therefore, was that Chavez did not
have the support of the
farmworkers. The purpose,
however, was to force workers
into a union they didn't want to
join. The strategy was to fool
consumers into boycotting grapes
and lettuce by misrepresenting the
conditions of the farmworkers.
The boycott would then force
growers to sign with Chavez and if
the workers wanted to work th r ,
would have to join the UFW.
The strategy event
brought limited success. I
summer of 1970, 26 majo l ,r <:
growers signed contract witn
Chavez. Under the plan, a grower
would have to ask the UFW to
send him men when he needed
them and the UFW would then
assign the workers to the jobs.
This meant a worker could only
get a job through the union,
establishing a closed shop. It also
meant the workers had to join the
union if they wanted to work,
even though they had not signed

the contracts. The closed shop
hiring hall gave Chavez
tremendous power.
The abuses and injustices of
Chavez's hiring hall are
well-documented. The hiring hall
bosses exploited workers with
fines for such offenses as speaking
against the union, and
discrimination, favoritism,
corruption and poor
administration were common
problems.
As a result of signing the
contracts, therefore, the growers
got an end to the boycott, Chavez
got the workers, and the workers
got screwed. It seems that those
who have supported the boycott
and continue to offer support are
being used to hurt the very people
they are trying to help.
