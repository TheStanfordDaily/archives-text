Finances Affect Tenure
Editor:
Congratulations to Bill Ross
for his articles and column on the
decision to deny tenure to three
Classics professors and its effects
on the department (Daily, Feb.
10, 11 and 12). I would like to
add one comment about the
possibility of fiscal policy
influencing the decision to
withhold tenure.
While the University may not
directly admit to denying tenure
for fiscal reasons, a discussion in
the Faculty Senate last spring
revealed that qualified candidates
for tenure have been rejected for
reasons of "billet control."
Provost Miller stated: "It is a
fact that outstanding candidates
may not be appointed; it has been
done in the past. There is no
assurance of a billet if the
candidate meets the criteria [for
tenure]."
Billet control means having a
slot open for the newly tenured
professor. This space control is
exercised by deans in conjunction
with the provost. One
consideration in deciding whether
to grant a billet is the tenure
structure, i.e. whether this will
produce too many senior
professors with not enough room
for junior people. Another reason
is financial, as the Provost
indicated at the next Senate
meeting when he said that the
reasons for no guarantee of tenure
were "financial and academic."
While billet control may or
may not have been a factor in the
Classics Department cases, it is
certainly operating against
admittedly "outstanding
candidates." It is this device
which is used to make purely
fiscal considerations a part of the
tenure decision.

No Plot Perceived
Editor:
"Don't kid yourself," says
Bonny Rodden (Daily, Feb. 7),
"the University is still out to
destroy fraternities." May I offer
a note of reassurance for Rodden
and all Greeks? Since I have heard
or read that charge every year
since I came to Stanford in 1950,
it must be true, but if the
University has been trying
unsuccessfully for 25 years to
accomplish this goal, then its
colossal ineptitude or impotence
leaves us nothing to fear.
The truth is that during those
25 years, under three presidents
and five deans of students, I have
never detected any significant
sentiment in the administration
for the abolition of fraternities. It
has been proposed by Daily
editors, student body presidents,
groups of students, and occasional
faculty members, but no such
proposal has ever been entertained
seriously in the relevant
administrative echelons.
Indeed, during that period the
University has loaned fraternities
millions of dollars, leased them
additional acres of prime campus
land, collected their bills, and
bailed out some houses about to
collapse from their own stupidity
or degeneracy.
The current Committee on
Student Services (COSS) proposal
represents a rather ingenious and
pragmatic effort to save the
fraternity system which will work
very well if the fraternities make
an effort to implement it.
