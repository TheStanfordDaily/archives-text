## Savoyards Bring Lively Operetta To Bay Area 
### PATRICE BADSTUBNER 
It is the winter of 1973.
Sophomore Armand Gilinsky,
disillusioned by the lack of
opportunity for non-majors to
appear in Music or Drama
Department productions, decides
to take matters into his own
hands.
He places a notice in the Daily
calling a meeting of all persons
interested in forming a Gilbert
and Sullivan society. Twenty to
thirty people gather one evening
in the Columbae lounge, among
them Mason Blacher, a man well
known for his bureaucratic
expertise.
Assuming administrative
control of the aspiring performers,
Blacher begins to craft from their
innocence and enthusiasm a SCIRE
project. With The World of
Gilbert and Sullivan, in the
spring of 1973, the Stanford

Savoyards were born.
The troupe debuted with
The Pirates of Penzance. Blacher
produced the effort. Choral and
music directors were found in two
graduate music students who liked
the stuff.
The cast, says Gilinsky, "all
kinds of strays," consisted of
faculty, friends of students,
alumni, staff and ... undergradu
ates. Hard pressed for a stage
director, Blacher accorded
Gilinsky the honor of "director
by default."
Only Four Rehearsals
Cast and crew were one and
the same. Set design and
construction, costumes, and
choreography were undertaken by
all available hands, both the
skilled and the merely curious.
For undergraduates, the lure of
academic credit sustained the
effort, but for those others,

nothing less than devotion to the
spirit of Gilbert and Sullivan
brought unity from
disorganization.
With only four rehearsals in
Dinkelspiel, Pirates opened to a
house of 600. Curtain time was
held 30 minutes; there was but a
single person to handle the crowd.
In its brief three-night run,
The Pirates of Penzance played
for more than 1500 people.
Funded by a SCIRE grant of $50,
with an additional $350 from the
office of Dean of Student Affairs,
the Savoyards in their first season
turned a $1900 profit.
Sell-Out Crowds
That first spring success was
followed the next summer by an
open-air performance of Trial by
Jury. H.M.S. Pinafore, the
Savoyard's most recent fare, drew
sell-out crowds in November, and
if the current trend in ticket sales

continues, the April production
may well boast the same success.
What began as a hang-loose, or
rather barely-hanging-together
operation is now called a "pretty
slick outfit," by former director
Gilinsky.
"They have to decide what
shows they are going to do two
years in advance so they can get it
into the Lively Arts calendar," he
says.
He speaks of the growth of the
Savoyards as one would the
passing of a favorite fantasy, but
conceeds that "you have to
sacrifice some of the freshness and
amorphousness we had that
spring."
As a recognized organization
on campus the Savoyards can now
obtain performance dates and
rehearsal space. "Then," recalls
Gilinsky, "we couldn't even
power the janitors out of Dink."
Rule By Oligarchy
But quality productions
require a degree of organization
that the group is just beginning to
attain. And according to Dick
Highfield, University employee
and former chorus member turned
producer, that informal
atmosphere still predominates.
Although a committee is
drafting a constitution with the
hopes of establishing a number of
offices and formal job functions,
current rule is by what music
director Dan Robinson calls an
oligarchy.
A self-sustaining organization
that banks with the ASSU, the
Savoyards find that freedom to
choose their repertoire is a chief
advantage, in not being tied to
either the Music or Drama
Department.
They look forward to
developing a company capable of
taking on more ambitious
productions like The Mikado.

But in the meantime the
Savoyards will provide training
grounds for inexperienced
performers who wish to develop
their skills under such talented
directors as Robinson, who has
been with the troupe from the
beginning.
A Lot Of Family
Truly a heterogeneous cross
section of the Stanford

community, the Savoyards
attribute the success of their first
production to "a lot of family in
the area."
But it is apparent that Gilbert
and Sullivan have an appeal that
draws people from beyond the
intersection of El Camino and
Palm Drive. There is a demand for
operetta here on the Peninsula,
and the Savoyards have been able

to satisfy that with their
"hard-core purist" approach.
In rehearsal for their next
production, Ruddigore, which will
open for a four-day run on April
9, the Savoyards are the subject of
a short film by first-year graduate
student Ellen Jaffe. They hope to
use the film to promote tne show
and stimulate involvement in
future productions.

STANFORD SAVOYARDS — Back in the spring of '73 the Stanford Savoyards, with Jeff Wilson, Karl
Vandereau, Rick Albrink and Kathy Wong, presented their first production, The Pirates of Penzance. Since
that time, the Savoyards have become a Stanford tradition, racking up capacity crowds and four-figure
profits.

He places a notice in the Daily
calling a meeting of all persons
interested in forming a Gilbert
and Sullivan society. Twenty to
thirty people gather one evening
in the Columbae lounge, among
them Mason Blacher, a man well
known for his bureaucratic
expertise.
Assuming administrative
control of the aspiring performers,
Blacher begins to craft from their
innocence and enthusiasm a SCIRE
project. With The World of
Gilbert and Sullivan, in the
spring of 1973, the Stanford

Savoyards were born.
The troupe debuted with
The Pirates of Penzance. Blacher
produced the effort. Choral and
music directors were found in two
graduate music students who liked
the stuff.
The cast, says Gilinsky, "all
kinds of strays," consisted of
faculty, friends of students,
alumni, staff and ... undergradu
ates. Hard pressed for a stage
director, Blacher accorded
Gilinsky the honor of "director
by default."
Only Four Rehearsals
Cast and crew were one and
the same. Set design and
construction, costumes, and
choreography were undertaken by
all available hands, both the
skilled and the merely curious.
For undergraduates, the lure of
academic credit sustained the
effort, but for those others,

nothing less than devotion to the
spirit of Gilbert and Sullivan
brought unity from
disorganization.
With only four rehearsals in
Dinkelspiel, Pirates opened to a
house of 600. Curtain time was
held 30 minutes; there was but a
single person to handle the crowd.
In its brief three-night run,
The Pirates of Penzance played
for more than 1500 people.
Funded by a SCIRE grant of $50,
with an additional $350 from the
office of Dean of Student Affairs,
the Savoyards in their first season
turned a $1900 profit.
Sell-Out Crowds
That first spring success was
followed the next summer by an
open-air performance of Trial by
Jury. H.M.S. Pinafore, the
Savoyard's most recent fare, drew
sell-out crowds in November, and
if the current trend in ticket sales

continues, the April production
may well boast the same success.
What began as a hang-loose, or
rather barely-hanging-together
operation is now called a "pretty
slick outfit," by former director
Gilinsky.
"They have to decide what
shows they are going to do two
years in advance so they can get it
into the Lively Arts calendar," he
says.
He speaks of the growth of the
Savoyards as one would the
passing of a favorite fantasy, but
conceeds that "you have to
sacrifice some of the freshness and
amorphousness we had that
spring."
As a recognized organization
on campus the Savoyards can now
obtain performance dates and
rehearsal space. "Then," recalls
Gilinsky, "we couldn't even
power the janitors out of Dink."
Rule By Oligarchy
But quality productions
require a degree of organization
that the group is just beginning to
attain. And according to Dick
Highfield, University employee
and former chorus member turned
producer, that informal
atmosphere still predominates.
Although a committee is
drafting a constitution with the
hopes of establishing a number of
offices and formal job functions,
current rule is by what music
director Dan Robinson calls an
oligarchy.
A self-sustaining organization
that banks with the ASSU, the
Savoyards find that freedom to
choose their repertoire is a chief
advantage, in not being tied to
either the Music or Drama
Department.
They look forward to
developing a company capable of
taking on more ambitious
productions like The Mikado.

But in the meantime the
Savoyards will provide training
grounds for inexperienced
performers who wish to develop
their skills under such talented
directors as Robinson, who has
been with the troupe from the
beginning.
A Lot Of Family
Truly a heterogeneous cross
section of the Stanford

community, the Savoyards
attribute the success of their first
production to "a lot of family in
the area."
But it is apparent that Gilbert
and Sullivan have an appeal that
draws people from beyond the
intersection of El Camino and
Palm Drive. There is a demand for
operetta here on the Peninsula,
and the Savoyards have been able

to satisfy that with their
"hard-core purist" approach.
In rehearsal for their next
production, Ruddigore, which will
open for a four-day run on April
9, the Savoyards are the subject of
a short film by first-year graduate
student Ellen Jaffe. They hope to
use the film to promote tne show
and stimulate involvement in
future productions.

STANFORD SAVOYARDS — Back in the spring of '73 the Stanford Savoyards, with Jeff Wilson, Karl

control of the aspiring performers,
Blacher begins to craft from their
innocence and enthusiasm a SCIRE
project. With The World of
Gilbert and Sullivan, in the
spring of 1973, the Stanford

Savoyards were born.
The troupe debuted with
The Pirates of Penzance. Blacher
produced the effort. Choral and
music directors were found in two
graduate music students who liked
the stuff.
The cast, says Gilinsky, "all
kinds of strays," consisted of
faculty, friends of students,
alumni, staff and ... undergradu
ates. Hard pressed for a stage
director, Blacher accorded
Gilinsky the honor of "director
by default."
Only Four Rehearsals
Cast and crew were one and
the same. Set design and
construction, costumes, and
choreography were undertaken by
all available hands, both the
skilled and the merely curious.
For undergraduates, the lure of
academic credit sustained the
effort, but for those others,

nothing less than devotion to the
spirit of Gilbert and Sullivan
brought unity from
disorganization.
With only four rehearsals in
Dinkelspiel, Pirates opened to a
house of 600. Curtain time was
held 30 minutes; there was but a
single person to handle the crowd.
In its brief three-night run,
The Pirates of Penzance played
for more than 1500 people.
Funded by a SCIRE grant of $50,
with an additional $350 from the
office of Dean of Student Affairs,
the Savoyards in their first season
turned a $1900 profit.
Sell-Out Crowds
That first spring success was
followed the next summer by an
open-air performance of Trial by
Jury. H.M.S. Pinafore, the
Savoyard's most recent fare, drew
sell-out crowds in November, and
if the current trend in ticket sales

continues, the April production
may well boast the same success.
What began as a hang-loose, or
rather barely-hanging-together
operation is now called a "pretty
slick outfit," by former director
Gilinsky.
"They have to decide what
shows they are going to do two
years in advance so they can get it
into the Lively Arts calendar," he
says.
He speaks of the growth of the
Savoyards as one would the
passing of a favorite fantasy, but
conceeds that "you have to
sacrifice some of the freshness and
amorphousness we had that
spring."
As a recognized organization
on campus the Savoyards can now
obtain performance dates and
rehearsal space. "Then," recalls
Gilinsky, "we couldn't even
power the janitors out of Dink."
Rule By Oligarchy
But quality productions
require a degree of organization
that the group is just beginning to
attain. And according to Dick
Highfield, University employee
and former chorus member turned
producer, that informal
atmosphere still predominates.
Although a committee is
drafting a constitution with the
hopes of establishing a number of
offices and formal job functions,
current rule is by what music
director Dan Robinson calls an
oligarchy.
A self-sustaining organization
that banks with the ASSU, the
Savoyards find that freedom to
choose their repertoire is a chief
advantage, in not being tied to
either the Music or Drama
Department.
They look forward to
developing a company capable of
taking on more ambitious
productions like The Mikado.

But in the meantime the
Savoyards will provide training
grounds for inexperienced
performers who wish to develop
their skills under such talented
directors as Robinson, who has
been with the troupe from the
beginning.
A Lot Of Family
Truly a heterogeneous cross
section of the Stanford

community, the Savoyards
attribute the success of their first
production to "a lot of family in
the area."
But it is apparent that Gilbert
and Sullivan have an appeal that
draws people from beyond the
intersection of El Camino and
Palm Drive. There is a demand for
operetta here on the Peninsula,
and the Savoyards have been able

to satisfy that with their
"hard-core purist" approach.
In rehearsal for their next
production, Ruddigore, which will
open for a four-day run on April
9, the Savoyards are the subject of
a short film by first-year graduate
student Ellen Jaffe. They hope to
use the film to promote tne show
and stimulate involvement in
future productions.

STANFORD SAVOYARDS — Back in the spring of '73 the Stanford Savoyards, with Jeff Wilson, Karl
Vandereau, Rick Albrink and Kathy Wong, presented their first production, The Pirates of Penzance. Since
that time, the Savoyards have become a Stanford tradition, racking up capacity crowds and four-figure
profits.
It is the winter of 1973.
Sophomore Armand Gilinsky,
disillusioned by the lack of
opportunity for non-majors to
appear in Music or Drama
Department productions, decides
to take matters into his own
hands.
He places a notice in the Daily
calling a meeting of all persons
interested in forming a Gilbert
and Sullivan society. Twenty to
thirty people gather one evening
in the Columbae lounge, among
them Mason Blacher, a man well
known for his bureaucratic
expertise.
Assuming administrative
control of the aspiring performers,
Blacher begins to craft from their
innocence and enthusiasm a SCIRE
project. With The World of
Gilbert and Sullivan, in the
spring of 1973, the Stanford

Savoyards were born.
