I saw Captain Stephen Leopold on TV, as he
arrived at Clark Air Force Base following his release
by the Viet Cong. I understand he is a Stanford
alumnus and was, in fact, editor of the Daily in
1966. Could you find out his current mailing
address for me? I would like to write him to
welcome him home and to thank him for his service
to our country. — S.T.
A representative of Bowman Alumni House said
that Leopold is living in the Midwest. Although
Bowman will not give out alumni addresses, it will
forward letters to Stanford alumni, whose
whereabouts are known. Enclose your letter in a
stamped envelope with the name of the alumnus on
the outside. Then put this envelope inside a larger
envelope. Bowman will address the letter and send
it on.

What is the reason for the proliferation of stop
signs along Campus Drive, especially in the area of
the Stanford Medical Center? Is it because the
University desires increased gas consumption and
air pollution? Or is it because the University bought
too many stop signs to get a quantity discount, and
now feels the need to use them all up? — J.G.
Your sarcasm was not appreciated by Oscar
Nelson, the University's master planner. He said
that the stop signs in front of the Medical Center
were put there at the request of the School of
Medicine because workers there felt that getting

across Campus Drive "was sort of a hazard." Nelson
noted that students should bear in mind that "the
whole convenience of the campus isn't for the
motorists." In light of the University's attitudes on
student parking, this should be obvious by now.

My friends and I are faced with a serious problem.
We would like to play basketball on an indoor
court but can't find any gyms which are open to
students or the public in general. Can you help us
out?-T.M.
Is there a gym on campus where students can
exercise in their free time?—T.B.
I can't give you much help. If you want to
practice in Roble Gym you have to sandwich it in
at unbelievably awkward hours — Tuesday and
Thursday from B—9 in the morning, Tuesday and
Friday from 6—7 at night, and Friday from 11-2 in
the afternoon. Maples is open Monday through
Friday 11-1 except on days when there's a home
basketball game.
For night practice, you can go to Terman Junior
High from 7:30 to 9:30 on Monday nights. Gunn
High School is open on Saturdays from noon to 5.
There's happier news for exercising enthusiasts.
The Encina weight room is open from 7:30 a.m. to
6 p.m. Monday through Friday and 1-5 on
Saturday.
