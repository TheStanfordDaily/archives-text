# Stanford-ln-Stanford Granted Housing Space

### LONNIE ROSENWALD 
The inauguration of
Stanford-ln-Stanford, an
inter-disciplinary residential
program which is scheduled to
begin next autumn, was finalized
last week when the Advisory
Panel on Residence Configuration
voted to allocate housing space
for the program.
"The Committee has decided
that the program is indeed worthy
of a residence in the residence
system," said ASSU President
Mike Herman, co-founder of
Stanford-ln-Stanford. He added
that the specific type of housing
has not yet been determined.
"I would prefer an
independent house," Herman
acknowledged. "There are
facilities and features about an
independent house which are
important to a lesidential program
like this."
In contrast, Herman feels that
the structure of large dorms tends
to create isolation, whereas, in a
residential program, "you want to
cut down as many barriers as
possible."
There has also been discussion
of a proposal to move the
program into one of the new Row
houses which are to be
constructed this year. However, as
the new houses will not be
completed by next fall, this
option will be reconsidered for
the following year.
Based on attendance levels at
preliminary meetings, as well as

response to questionnaires
distributed among 200 residents
of Wilbur Hall, Herman is pleased
with students' reception of
Stanford-ln-Stanford.
As the number of applicants
is expected to exceed the number
of spaces in the program, some
competitive system of selection
will be used. Herman speculated
that the 35-50 spaces will be filled
through the regular housing draw.
Expressing his pleasure at the
Panel's decision to award housing
to Stanford-ln-Stanford, the
program's coordinator. Political
Science Prof. Lawrence Weiler
stressed the benefits of a
residential situation as a means of
broader student exchange. "It's
very valuable to have students, at
least in this area, in a situation
where they're interacting."
The program, whose theme is
"Arms Control," will center
around three courses: "How
Nations Deal with Each Other" in
the autumn; "Introduction to
Arms Control" in winter; and
"Arms Control and Disarmament"
in spring. All but the latter will be
open to the general student body
as well.
Stanford-ln-Stanford residents
may select additional courses
offered through the program.
They will also be permitted to
take courses outside of the
program, provided that the
program directors feel they bear
some relation to the general topic
of "Arms Control."
