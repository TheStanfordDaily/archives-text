# Prof Says Spending Figures Cause 'Bureaucratic Monster'
## 
### PAM WOODS 
This year, the University will
spend $15 million on faculty
salaries and $21 million on staff
and administration salaries. By
1980, the office of business and
finance projects that the faculty
will receive $21 million while
administration and staff will
receive $31 million.
According to Computer
Science Prof. John McCarthy,
these figures suggest that much of
the University has become a
"bureaucratic monster."
"The University has grown
according to Parkinson's law," he
said, where work expands so as to
fill the time for its completion
and there is little or no
relationship between the work to
be done and the size of the staff
to do it.
"Everybody's working very
hard sending each other memos,"
said McCarthy.

McCarthy wrote in the Jan. 30
Daily that the University had lost
sight of its purpose — "the
advancement and propagation of
knowledge."
Instead, McCarthy said budget
figures and the Faculty Senate's
rejection of Human Biology Prof.
Colin Pittendrigh's proposal that
the Senate endorse budget cuts in
"the generous support services
[the University] now enjoys
[rather] than . .. curtailment of
the academic program itself" have
led him to believe that the
University puts community
interests ahead of academic ones.
'Wrong Premise'
A spokesman for the office of
business and finance, Kent
Peterson said McCarthy's
conclusions are "based on the
wrong premise."
"There are lots of things other
than administration included in
the $21 million,"he stated. The

figure also includes salaries of
personnel who could be
considered in the academic
sphere, including library
employees (whose salaries make
up 18 percent of the total), and
faculty secretaries who assist in
research.
Peterson also explained that
the salaries of teaching assistants
and visiting professors were not
included in the $15 million figure,
so total faculty expenditures were
actually larger.
Staff Expenditures
The staff expenditures in the
present budget, however, are still
much larger in relation to the
faculty expenditures than they
were 10 years ago, said McCarthy.
"There were librarians then, too,"
he said.
And the relative size of staff
salaries is expected to continue to
rise, although Peterson stated that
this increase will be due not to
new services or to an increase in
the number of employees, but to
inflation and to an increase in the
price of the staff market as
compared to the faculty market.
"We will just have to pay a higher
price to keep the same number of
staff members that we now have,"
he said.
McCarthy called for a
re-evaluation of the administrative
and staff functions, especially
those that have greatly expanded
in recent years, so that their real,
concrete value can be determined.
Compare
"I would like to see the
University with the same
faculty/staff salary expenditure
ratio as it had in 1960," he said.
He suggested that the University
compare present expenditures to
those of 10 years ago and to the
budgets of other private
universities such as Harvard and
Yale.
The University should then
make the figures available to the
public. One of the main problems
with the budget, he asserted, is
that "nobody knows about these
things, even those who are doing
wrong."
McCarthy received a letter
from Provost William Miller's
office shortly after his opinion
column appeared in the Daily.
"He [Miller] totally
misunderstood the point of my
letter," said McCarthy. Miller
assured McCarthy that he was
aware of the problem and that
large cuts were being made in the
administrative field.
"Once again we have the ideal
of the sense of community, the
feeling that everything is all right
as long as everyone sacrifices
equally," McCarthy stated. He
called instead for the University
to spend money only where there
was a benefit to the real purpose
of the University.

'BUREAUCRATIC MONSTER' — Vice President for Business and

"bureaucratic monster," says Computer Science Prof. John McCarthy.
McCarthy cited the $16 million increase in faculty, staff and
administration salaries as the cause of the problem.
