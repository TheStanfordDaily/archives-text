## Bats No Problem Here 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
The Taj Mahal has bats.
London bridge probably does too.
The little characters crop up all
over.
When you realize that almost
all the famous places in the world
have bats, you might be proud to
know that there are bats here.
We can't really brag about our
bats, though. According to Jewell
Goode, University maintenance
program manager, "We do not
have a big bat problem, but in
Meyer Library from time to time
we will see one or two bats."
Jack Sidlow, manager of the
University's Safety and Health
Department said, "We felt that
the best way to control the
problem was to 'bat proof' the
buildings."
"We try to close up the
openings where the bat gets up
into the attic or roof or eaves,"
said Goode. "Our defense against
them is to put up a screen across
their homes after they leave at
night to go on the prowl."
It would be an impossible task
to find all the bats in the 160-odd
buildings on campus, he added.
"It's only when we have reported
bat sightings that we take action
to eliminate them."
Calls about bats only come
from whomever is in charge of the
building with the bat in it, Goode
said. He doesn't receive any calls
from students saying they saw
bats in the Quad, he said. Besides,
"we have no way of telling where
a bat's going when it's just
flying," he pointed out.
Sidlow commented, "The
biggest problem we had at the
library [UGLY] was that they
were getting in there. They really
weren't bothering the people.
Someone saw one hanging there
and started throwing things at it,
and of course it got excited and
started flying around and there
was a big uproar. If I remember

correctly, we caught that bat."
It's difficult to catch bats
because of their radar systems,
Sidlow explained. Sometimes
rooms are just emptied, the
windows left open and the bats
fly out.
Goode said, "Last month we
had a report of two bats in Meyer
Library, and we caught those."
"We are called in from time to
time to remove dead bats that
have died from natural causes," he
said.
"Dead bats are checked by the
Santa Clara County Health
Department," said Sidlow, "just
to make sure they don't have
rabies."
"These bats are dead animals,
and when anything dies," he
explained, "it makes you curious
to know why. We want to know if
it died from a communicable
disease or not."
Goode said, "We have made a
concentrated effort against bats.
We have a contract with an
exterminator, and he advises us on
the bat problem."
He continued, "We cannot use
chemicals on them â€” the only
effective thing [to use] against
bats other than poisoning them
(which we don't do) is DDT, and
we're not allowed to use that. It's
banned by the state and by the
University's Safety and Health
Department."
Sidlow said, "You want to
control bats, but you wouldn't
want to eliminate them because
they serve a very useful purpose.
Apparently they are very effective
against flying insects."
