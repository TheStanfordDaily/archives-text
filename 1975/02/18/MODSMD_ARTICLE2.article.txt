# Alumnus Denied Access To Records
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A radical former student was
denied access last week to a number of
University files on him which he had
requested to see under the provisions
of the Buckley Amendment.
The Amendment, formally entitled
the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974, was sponsored by
Sen. James L. Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.)
and granted students, former students
and parents "the right to inspect and
review the education records" of the
student.
The alumnus, who now works for
the University, met with Legal Adviser
to the President James V. Siena last
Wednesday, and was granted access to

all files in the custody of the
President's and Provost's Offices. Most
importantly, these included the
records of campus judicial proceedings
involving the alumnus. He reviewed
these records with Siena on Friday.
Siena also informed the alumnus
that numerous files which he
requested to see had been open to him
prior to the enactment of the Buckley
Amendment. These included records
kept by the Registrar's Office.
No Access
However, Siena claimed that the
Buckley Amendment does not grant
the alumnus access to a number of
other files which he had asked to see
in an itemized, two-page lettejr of
request to Siena on Nov. 27.
According to the alumnus, "the
things he declined to show me were
the most interesting ones, the heavy
stuff, 'work products' and any
material from the General Secretary's
Office, which includes the legal
counsel."
The alumnus explained that Siena
"claimed that the exemption in these
cases was that the files were
non-academic, and therefore not
covered by the Buckley Amendment."
When contacted by the Daily Friday,
Siena repeated that the files in
question were "non-educational in
nature," and therefore not covered.
"What I wanted to see," the
alumnus said, "were the internal
memoranda between the
administrators and the lawyers, which
were the bases for deciding things like
whom they would press criminal

charges against."
Another principal area of dispute
between the alumnus and Siena
revolved around the personal files of
various administrators. The alumnus
alleged that these files became
"institutional" (and hence, covered by
the Amendment) when the
administrators went on to new jobs
and left the files for their successors.
But Siena said the files remained
personal "by definition." He added
that he didn't "know how we could
find out whether individuals had kept
private files, where they kept them, or
whether we could compel the
individuals to turn them over to us."
Yet another controversy
surrounded the breadth of Siena's
search for files on the alumnus.
According to the alumnus, Siena "said
he will not plow through every file,
looking for a piece of paper with my
name on it."
Siena told the Daily, "I don't
believe the law places on us an
obligation to search all files which
might have something about him. That
would be a considerable undertaking.
And I wouldn't think in most
instances that the files would qualify
as educational."
Organized Differently?
In addition, Siena said "the primary
purpose of the law is to let people see
and, if necessary, correct information
about them which may be relied upon
for providing information to an
outside agency." He pointed out that
"it is more than highly unlikely that
those incidental pieces of paper would
ever be referred to."

But the alumnus said "it is very
conceivable that files could be
organized in ways other than by
names. For instance, there could be
one labelled 'people we should be sure
to screw.' " The alumnus believes he
has a legitimate right to see such files.
"There are a lot of fuzzy areas
[under the Amendment] where I
think Siena is screwing me," the
alumnus said, "but then again, there's
no smoking gun."
Last Thursday, the alumnus told
the Daily, "I expect to come back
with a revised statement, asking to see
data which I believe is covered by the
law, but which Siena has denied me
access to."

with a revised statement, asking to see
data which I believe is covered by the
law, but which Siena has denied me
access to."
A radical former student was
denied access last week to a number of
University files on him which he had
requested to see under the provisions
of the Buckley Amendment.
The Amendment, formally entitled
the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974, was sponsored by
Sen. James L. Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.)
and granted students, former students
and parents "the right to inspect and
review the education records" of the
student.
The alumnus, who now works for
the University, met with Legal Adviser
to the President James V. Siena last
Wednesday, and was granted access to

all files in the custody of the
President's and Provost's Offices. Most
importantly, these included the
records of campus judicial proceedings
involving the alumnus. He reviewed
these records with Siena on Friday.
Siena also informed the alumnus
that numerous files which he
requested to see had been open to him
prior to the enactment of the Buckley
Amendment. These included records
kept by the Registrar's Office.
No Access
However, Siena claimed that the
Buckley Amendment does not grant
the alumnus access to a number of
other files which he had asked to see
in an itemized, two-page lettejr of
request to Siena on Nov. 27.
According to the alumnus, "the
things he declined to show me were
the most interesting ones, the heavy
stuff, 'work products' and any
material from the General Secretary's
Office, which includes the legal
counsel."
The alumnus explained that Siena
"claimed that the exemption in these
cases was that the files were
non-academic, and therefore not
covered by the Buckley Amendment."
When contacted by the Daily Friday,
Siena repeated that the files in
question were "non-educational in
nature," and therefore not covered.
"What I wanted to see," the
alumnus said, "were the internal
memoranda between the
administrators and the lawyers, which
were the bases for deciding things like
whom they would press criminal

charges against."
Another principal area of dispute
between the alumnus and Siena
revolved around the personal files of
various administrators. The alumnus
alleged that these files became
"institutional" (and hence, covered by
the Amendment) when the
administrators went on to new jobs
and left the files for their successors.
But Siena said the files remained
personal "by definition." He added
that he didn't "know how we could
find out whether individuals had kept
private files, where they kept them, or
whether we could compel the
individuals to turn them over to us."
Yet another controversy
surrounded the breadth of Siena's
search for files on the alumnus.
According to the alumnus, Siena "said
he will not plow through every file,
looking for a piece of paper with my
name on it."
Siena told the Daily, "I don't
believe the law places on us an
obligation to search all files which
might have something about him. That
would be a considerable undertaking.
And I wouldn't think in most
instances that the files would qualify
as educational."
Organized Differently?
In addition, Siena said "the primary
purpose of the law is to let people see
and, if necessary, correct information
about them which may be relied upon
for providing information to an
outside agency." He pointed out that
"it is more than highly unlikely that
those incidental pieces of paper would
ever be referred to."

But the alumnus said "it is very
conceivable that files could be
organized in ways other than by
names. For instance, there could be
one labelled 'people we should be sure
to screw.' " The alumnus believes he
has a legitimate right to see such files.
"There are a lot of fuzzy areas
[under the Amendment] where I
think Siena is screwing me," the
alumnus said, "but then again, there's
no smoking gun."
Last Thursday, the alumnus told
the Daily, "I expect to come back
with a revised statement, asking to see

law, but which Siena has denied me
