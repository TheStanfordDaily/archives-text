# Gay Faculty Meet To Discuss Needs

Gay members of the University
faculty and staff have been
meeting recently to fill a "need
for more of a community among
gay faculty members," according
to Michael Silverstein, program
specialist for the Gay People's
Union.
A Sunday brunch was held last
weekend to further acquaint gay
members who had attended an
initial meeting early this month,
Silverstein said.
"People talked about their
conflicts in wanting to be
available to give support to
students, while at the same time
feeling required to maintain their
distance," Silverstein said.
"One concrete idea considered
was the possibility of encouraging
gay studies, research on the part
of students and volunteering to sit
on the committees of graduate
students working in such areas,"
he added.
Gay faculty from San
Francisco State, Sacramento, San
Jose, and Berkeley were invited to
the Sunday brunch.
A member of the New York
chapter of the Gay Academics
Union was also there to discuss
the possibility of its establishment
on the West Coast.
The gay faculty have
considered forming a chapter of
the Gay Academics Union, an
organization which has been
strongly established on the East
Coast within the last two years.
"We would like to work for the
betterment of the social and
political conditions of our
minority group," said graduate

student Jack Anderson.
He added that a Gay
Academics Union would provide
for more communication
between, not only the faculty at
Stanford, but between the gay
faculty at other Bay Area
campuses.
Graduate student Andy
Mendelson estimates that there
are "at least a couple of hundred"
gay faculty members at Stanford.
Few of the faculty women appear
to be gay, however, he said.
"Stanford seems to hire a lot
of married couples," said Harriet
Whitehead, acting assistant to
professor of anthropology. She
said she feels this practice tends to
discriminate against unmarried
women, women married to men
outside of the academic
community, and against gay
women.
