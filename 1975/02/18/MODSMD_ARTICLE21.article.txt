### RON ELVING 
Business School Prof. Ezra
Solomon attributes this country's
current economic woes to
mistakes in federal fiscal policy
aggravated by domestic and
international factors such as the
price increases of the oil
producing nations.
Solomon advances his views in
his book The Anxious Economy,
a primer on the present situation
written for the layman and
published last month by the
Stanford Alumni Association as
the latest title in its series, The
Portable Stanford.
Solomon, a former member of
the President's Council of
Economic Advisors (1971-73),
rejects the gloomy projections of
some economists and argues that a
situation substantially caused by
governmental policies may also be
largely remedied by enlightened
changes in those policies.
The price increases of the Oil
Producing and Exporting
Countries (OPEC) dominate the
list of aggravating factors. In the
chapter devoted to this
phenomenon, Solomon
emphasizes the disunity of
interest within OPEC.
Certain nations within the
cartel (such as Saudi Arabia) have
much less to gain from the
continuation of unrealistic prices
than others (such as Libya),
Solomon says.
If the government were to
follow Solomon's suggestions, it
would put pressure on OPEC with
policies designed to bring down
the demand for oil.
Among the measures Solomon
advocates are cutbacks in all
forms of fuel consumption, tariffs
and tax levies to enforce such
conservation, and complete
"deregulation" of oil and natural
gas prices. "Inequities" caused by
deregulation of prices could be
adjusted through the tax system,
according to Solomon.
While the popular tendency to
blame OPEC for this era's

economic trauma has some basis
in fact, Solomon locates the real
roots of the problem in federal
fiscal policy from 1905 to the
present.
in that year, he points out, we
embarked on a war in Southeast
Asia while spending fresh billions
on "war on poverty" domestic
programs "without bothering to
increase taxes to pay for either
venture."
Since the government financed
this "guns and butter" policy
through the banking system,
expanding the money stock at an
unprecedented rate, Solomon
characterizes the resultant
condition as a classic
"demand-pull" inflation spiral.
Though policymakers based
their decisions on Keynesian
theory, they ignored the fact that
the economy was already
booming at near total capacity, an
error which Solomon sees as the
key to current inflation levels.
To complete this scenario,
Solomon adds the wage and price
power of modern unions and
corporations, international
monetary instability, declining
non-military exports and finally
the shocking explosion in OPEC's
oil prices.

Solomon, a former member of
the President's Council of
Economic Advisors (1971-73),
rejects the gloomy projections of
some economists and argues that a
situation substantially caused by
governmental policies may also be
largely remedied by enlightened
changes in those policies.
The price increases of the Oil
Producing and Exporting
Countries (OPEC) dominate the
list of aggravating factors. In the
chapter devoted to this
phenomenon, Solomon
emphasizes the disunity of
interest within OPEC.
Certain nations within the
cartel (such as Saudi Arabia) have
much less to gain from the
continuation of unrealistic prices
than others (such as Libya),
Solomon says.
If the government were to
follow Solomon's suggestions, it
would put pressure on OPEC with
policies designed to bring down
the demand for oil.
Among the measures Solomon
advocates are cutbacks in all
forms of fuel consumption, tariffs
and tax levies to enforce such
conservation, and complete
"deregulation" of oil and natural
gas prices. "Inequities" caused by
deregulation of prices could be
adjusted through the tax system,
according to Solomon.
While the popular tendency to
blame OPEC for this era's

economic trauma has some basis
in fact, Solomon locates the real
roots of the problem in federal
fiscal policy from 1905 to the
present.
in that year, he points out, we
embarked on a war in Southeast
Asia while spending fresh billions
on "war on poverty" domestic
programs "without bothering to
increase taxes to pay for either
venture."
Since the government financed
this "guns and butter" policy
through the banking system,
expanding the money stock at an
unprecedented rate, Solomon
characterizes the resultant
condition as a classic
"demand-pull" inflation spiral.
Though policymakers based
their decisions on Keynesian
theory, they ignored the fact that
the economy was already
booming at near total capacity, an
error which Solomon sees as the
key to current inflation levels.
To complete this scenario,
Solomon adds the wage and price
power of modern unions and
corporations, international
monetary instability, declining
non-military exports and finally
the shocking explosion in OPEC's
oil prices.
Business School Prof. Ezra
Solomon attributes this country's
current economic woes to
mistakes in federal fiscal policy
aggravated by domestic and
international factors such as the
price increases of the oil
producing nations.
