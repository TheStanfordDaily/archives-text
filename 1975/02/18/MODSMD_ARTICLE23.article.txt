# Defense Dulls JV Games

### PAUL BAUMAN 
If defensive basketball is your
thing, then the Stanford junior
varsity's victories over UC-Santa
Cruz (59-51) Saturday and Menlo
College (48-45) Friday provided
plenty of excitement. If, however,
you go for offensive basketball,
you should have stayed home.
Which is what most people did.
Saturday's game against Santa
Cruz, which followed the varsity's
thrashing of Washington State,
was witnessed by roughly 2000
discarded Daily basketball issues
and nearly enough fans to start a
pick-up game afterwards.
Stanford (8-4) has now won
seven of its last eight games, and
its last four consecutive home
games. Santa Cruz may be only
2-7, but it leads the league in
headbands.
Santa Cruz has only a token
intercollegiate sports program.
The team Stanford played was

Santa Cruz' best and it put up a
good effort. In fact, the UC cagers
were leading by eight at the half,
but the Cards took advantage of
numerous second-half Santa Cruz
turnovers to take the lead and
eventually break away.
Both defenses were impressive.
Stanford held Santa Cruz to just
16 points in the second half while
the Cards' Terry McCartin had his
hands full bringing the ball
upcourt against UCSC's aggressive
press.
Sven Walker topped Stanford
with 16 points and McCartin
added 15. Santa Cruz' Dan Apple
led all scorers with 24 points.
There was good news and bad
news (for Card fans) Friday
against rival Menlo (20-5). The
bad news was that Stanford was
disappointing offensively, due
largely to Menlo's tough defense.
The good news was that Menlo
was at least as bad.
Card Shooting Poor
Stanford shot only 38 percent
from the field. Menlo shot slightly
worse. Stanford shot just 53
percent from the free throw line.
Menlo shot 50 percent.
That was where the game was
won. Menlo penetrated better on
offense than Stanford, but
couldn't offset the Cards' edge at
the line.

Menlo seemed to be imitating
Oregon coach Dick Harter's
"Kamikaze" type of defense,
which stops at nothing short of
assault. The trick is to be physical
but avoid fouls. Oregon usually
succeeds, but Menlo didn't.
Stanford went to the line 20 more
times and converted 11 more free
throws than its rival ... a rather
difficult deficit to overcome.
But Menlo, behind Rick
Michelmore, nearly did, drawing
within one with 47 seconds left.
Stanford coach Percy Carr called a
time out when the Cards got the
ball and instructed his team to
spread out and delay. It worked.
Walker found himself wide open
under the basket for a lay-up with
12 seconds remaining and that
was it.

you should have stayed home.
Which is what most people did.
Saturday's game against Santa
Cruz, which followed the varsity's
thrashing of Washington State,
was witnessed by roughly 2000
discarded Daily basketball issues
and nearly enough fans to start a
pick-up game afterwards.
Stanford (8-4) has now won
seven of its last eight games, and
its last four consecutive home
games. Santa Cruz may be only
2-7, but it leads the league in
headbands.
Santa Cruz has only a token
intercollegiate sports program.
The team Stanford played was

Santa Cruz' best and it put up a
good effort. In fact, the UC cagers
were leading by eight at the half,
but the Cards took advantage of
numerous second-half Santa Cruz
turnovers to take the lead and
eventually break away.
Both defenses were impressive.
Stanford held Santa Cruz to just
16 points in the second half while
the Cards' Terry McCartin had his
hands full bringing the ball
upcourt against UCSC's aggressive
press.
Sven Walker topped Stanford
with 16 points and McCartin
added 15. Santa Cruz' Dan Apple
led all scorers with 24 points.
There was good news and bad
news (for Card fans) Friday
against rival Menlo (20-5). The
bad news was that Stanford was
disappointing offensively, due
largely to Menlo's tough defense.
The good news was that Menlo
was at least as bad.
Card Shooting Poor
Stanford shot only 38 percent
from the field. Menlo shot slightly
worse. Stanford shot just 53
percent from the free throw line.
Menlo shot 50 percent.
That was where the game was
won. Menlo penetrated better on
offense than Stanford, but
couldn't offset the Cards' edge at
the line.

Menlo seemed to be imitating
Oregon coach Dick Harter's
"Kamikaze" type of defense,
which stops at nothing short of
assault. The trick is to be physical
but avoid fouls. Oregon usually
succeeds, but Menlo didn't.
Stanford went to the line 20 more
times and converted 11 more free
throws than its rival ... a rather
difficult deficit to overcome.
But Menlo, behind Rick
Michelmore, nearly did, drawing
within one with 47 seconds left.
Stanford coach Percy Carr called a
time out when the Cards got the
ball and instructed his team to
spread out and delay. It worked.
Walker found himself wide open
under the basket for a lay-up with
12 seconds remaining and that
was it.
If defensive basketball is your
thing, then the Stanford junior
varsity's victories over UC-Santa
Cruz (59-51) Saturday and Menlo
College (48-45) Friday provided
plenty of excitement. If, however,
you go for offensive basketball,
you should have stayed home.
