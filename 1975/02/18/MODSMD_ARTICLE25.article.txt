# Cards Replay Washington Weekend
## 
### DAN PYNE 
This basketball season has been
sort of like a Flash Gordon serial
where the protagonist is always
getting himself into trouble and
then finding a way to get out and
then getting into trouble again.
The Card basketball team, still
fighting for a post-season
tournament berth, fell in deep
trouble with a 69-68 loss to
Washington Friday night. But a
series of events (Oregon State
beating USC, Cal beating
Washington, UCLA beating
Oregon State) enabled the
Cardinals to pull back in the
running with a 92-70 thumping of
Washington State.
The Washington game was
almost a scriptwriter's dream.
Almost, because the good guy
didn't win.
Stanford, sluggish at the
outset, managed to rev up the
offense midway through the first
half and built up an 11-point lead,
35-24, with six minutes remaining
in the period. Rich Kelley went
out for a rest. The Cards didn't
score in his absence but
Washington did, cutting down the
lead to five points.
Kelley came back in, only to
pick up his third foul. But the
Cards scored, and the two teams

traded baskets until halftime.
Stanford led 41-38. A fan said,
"Stanford's going to win, but not
by much."
A Logical Guess
It was a reasonable deduction.
Card coach Howie Dallmar
commented afterward, "We had a
lot of opportunities in the first
half, and some in the second."
And Stanford played a pretty
good game. But Washington
played better.
The fighting Dogs came out in
the second half with two quick
baskets and took the lead. During
the next 17 minutes and 22
seconds the lead changed hands
17 times, and neither team led by
more than three points.
With three minutes remaining
the script went awry. Stanford,
the good guy, was down 66-63.
Free throws by Ed Schweitzer and
Kelley tied the score at 68.
Washington missed a shot.
Schweitzer got the rebound.
Dallmar called time out. 40
seconds remained on the clock.
Stanford Stalled
It was clear the Cards wanted
to stall and take the last shot,
probably the old up-and-over to
Schweitzer or Kelley. Things just
didn't turn out that way.
Stanford wasted away the
time and set up for the last shot.
But the Huskies had Kelley and
Schweitzer buttoned up, and
Mark Gilberg took the ball in for a
one-on-one up the middle. Larry
Pounds batted Gilberg's shot
away, Edwards grabbed the loose
ball and sprinted downcourt.
Melvin Arterberry fouled the
Washington big man as he went up
for a lay-in. One second remained.
The fans booed, the players
protested, but Edwards was
awarded two shots. He missed the
first and made the second. Said
Edwards afterward, "I knew the

second one was going in." And
the first? "I just wanted to give
'em [ the crowd ] a scare ..."
Edwards also said, of the shot, "I
was definitely going up for the
shot."
It is the same score by which
Stanford lost to Washington last
Saturday. It is the Cards' third
one-point conference loss.
A visibly disconsolate Dallmar
agreed with the foul call. "There
was nothing wrong with it,"he
said, adding, "Washington is a
potent team, and when they put
things together they're tough."
Mike Simons said Washington
was the best team the Cards have
played.
Dallmar said the Cards were
hampered in the second half by
trying to keep Kelley in the game,

but that "Edwards and Hansen
caused a lot of problems inside."
Edwards led the Huskies' scoring
with 25 points. Kelley netted the
game-high of 27, Schweitzer had
20 and Arterberry 11.
Stanford 92, WSU 70
The TVS game-of-the-week was
boring, as usual, but not
unbearable. Kelley gave Steve
Puidokas a lesson in basketball.
The Cougars' sophomore center
scored only 11 points while
Kelley was in the game.
Melvin Arterberry played a
great game with 10 points, five
rebounds and nine assists. "Melvin
played super," Bowling said after
the game. "He plays hard all the
time."
The Cards completely
dominated Washington State,
shooting 56.3 percent from the
floor. Kelley poured in 26 points
to lead all scorers. Schweitzer had
19, Jay Carter had 9. Edgar
Jeffries and Puidokas led the
Cougars with 15 points each.
Cards In Good Position
"The Washington loss was
disappointing and frustrating,"
Bowling said, "and yet the league
is so competitive that we're still in
a very good position for a playoff
berth."
And so, basketball fans, this
week's exciting segment of the
continuing drama of the
up-and-down Stanford Cardinals
draws to a close with the cagers
dangerously dangling from a 5-4
record. Will Stanford defy the
odds and sweep the Oregon series
