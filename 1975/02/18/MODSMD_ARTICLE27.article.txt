# Women Cagers Win Big
## 
### CHARLIE WHEELER 
The Stanford varsity women's
basketball team got lost twice
trying to find the University of
San Francisco on Saturday
afternoon. As far as the USF
women's team is concerned, they
should have stayed that way.
When they finally arrived, the
Cards blew the Dons off the
court, 83-37, and upped their
record to 4-0.
USF, which is just starting a
team this season, was no match
for unbeaten Stanford. The Cards
jumped off to a 17-6 lead and
then let up. The Dons scored 11
straight points to tie the game at
17-all with 6:22 left in the first
half. From then on it was all
Stanford.
The Cards used long set shots
to build a 30-21 halftime lead.

and USF was unable to take
advantage of the free throws
provided by Stanford's 18
first-half fouls.
After intermission, Stanford
started quickly and gave the USF
team a lesson in fast breaks.
Repeatedly the Cards would take
down a rebound and trigger the
fast break. Or, to vary the routine,
guards Stumpy O'Meara and
Nancy Lowold would steal a pass
and take the ball all the way for
an easy layup.
The Card varsity and JV teams
return to NCIAC conference
action tonight as they travel to
UC Davis. The JV game starts at
4:30 p.m., to be followed by the
varsity match.
