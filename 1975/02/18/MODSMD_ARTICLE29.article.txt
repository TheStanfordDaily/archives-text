# Pac-8 Roundup
## Another Weird One 
### 
This hasn't been Dick Harter's
week.
First, the Oregon coach said he
didn't like the Eugene fans. Then
he got arrested for driving while
intoxicated and was set free on
bail. Then UCLA ran all over the
Ducks on Friday. And then USC
beat Oregon by a nose Saturday
for the second straight week.
The ioss to the Bruins was
perhaps inevitable, but the USC
decision really hurt. Last week,
with only seconds remaining,
Harter was called for a technical
that enabled USC to pull off a
six-point play and tie the game
and then win.
This week, Gus Williams, the
Pac-B's leading scorer, dropped in
two free throws with 18 seconds
remaining to clinch the 92-90
Trojan victory.
It's been rumored that Harter
is now being considered for a
daytime serial revival of As The
World Turns. His Ducks dropped
into seventh place in conference
standings with a 3-6 record.
Meanwhile, back at the bench,
John (Wizard) Wooden is basking
in an 8-1 record, and his
second-ranked Bruins are firmly at
the top of the Pac-8 heap.
"We're in an enviable position
right now," he said, "but we
certainly can't afford to take
anyone lightly. As long as there's
a mathematical chance, we can be

caught."
Wooden pulled out his
calculator, paused, and concluded,
"It's possible, but we're certainly
in a good position, and it's going
to be difficult for anyone to catch
us."
That difficulty was
compounded when the Bruins
thumped second place Oregon
State 74-62 Saturday. The Beavers
beat USC on Friday, however, and
remain in second (strange, but
true) causing pre-season predictors
much dismay.
And, capping a mad mad mad
mad weekend, Washington lost to
Cal Saturday, dropping the
Huskies to 4-5 and moving the
Golden Bears into the third-place
trio with USC and the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Cardinals.
Next weekend ought to be a
hum-dinger.
