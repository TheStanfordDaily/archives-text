# Revised Plan For Library 'Utilitarian'
## 
### RICK GRAY 
Because of inflationary prices and
inefficiencies, the 1965 plans for the
new Main Library building have been
scrapped, according to Religious
Studies Prof. William Clebsch,
chairman of the Committee on
Libraries.
When the plans were first drawn up,
Clebsch said, the thinking was directed
toward "monuments," where today a
more "utilitarian" outlook is being
adopted. He said plans for a "smaller
yet adequate" building were now
being developed.
Stressing the need for an addition
to the main library, David Weber,
director of libraries, said the new
building is recognized as a "top
priority" by university officials.
A new building program for the
addition was written in December and
accepted in January by the Committee
on Libraries. The program, a
sixty-page description of academic
programs and spatial qualities and
relations, is presently before the
Provost and the President for approval.
Weber said he believes there is
"universal support" for the new
building program.
It was estimated in the mid-60s that
the cost of the building would be $20
million. However, last summer, while
the funds were still being raised,
planners realized that the new addition
couldn't be afforded due to almost
doubled costs.
Principally, the new program
specifies a smaller building than
originally planned, with more efficient
use of space.
The new building would have
136,000 assignable square feet, 51
percent of the original plans
(assignable square footage applies only
to areas where people can work, and
excludes such places as halls,
bathrooms, and spaces in front of
doors). In comparison, the present
Main Library has 126,000 assignable
square feet, and Meyer has 95,000.
Weber said he was more optimistic
of these plans being used, since "the
Provost's Office is focusing on a few
central priorities and more work is
being done with means of financing."
He added that with "tight planning
and optimistic thinking," one can
expect ground to be broken in the
summer or fall of 1976. Completion is
expected before spring of 1979.
