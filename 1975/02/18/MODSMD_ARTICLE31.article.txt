# Trojans Drown Cards9 74-39

### MARK GREEN 
The large crowd at deGuerre
pool Saturday was well
entertained by the Band and the
Dollies,but they were really there
to see a strong Stanford swim
team take on an even stronger
team from USC.
Unfortunately the defending
NCAA champions showed their
depth as they defeated the
Cardinals 74-39.
"We swam some good races,"
said Card coach Jim Gaughran,
"but they just swam more." The
Trojans, in addition to being deep
in talent, were well-rested. They
had not swum competitively for
almost a month. Stanford was
coming off a hard-swum upset of
UCLA last weekend and,
according to Gaughran, "it hurt us
in training."
The Cards received a number
of fine individual performances,
including sprinter Dave Fairbank's
twin victories in the 50 and 100
yard freestyle events. Fairbank,
who has the fastest time in the
nation in the 50 free, outdueled
last year's NCAA champion Joe
Bottom in both events. This year's
NCAA championships are only
three weeks away and Gaughran
thinks Fairbank "has a good
chance to win."
Bruner Won One
It may have surprised many
fans that Stanford's outstanding
freshman Mike Bruner did not win
all three races he entered.
Gaughran explained that "Mike
was swimming in the three
toughest events on the program
and USC threw a fresh guy at him

each time."
It didn't bother Bruner in the
first two races. He won the 1000
yard freestyle fairly easily then
apparently won the 200 yard
butterfly but was disqualified for
making an illegal turn.
A disappointed and obviously
tired Bruner then took on USC's
John Haber in the 500 yard
freestyle. "It was too much to ask
of him to win all three,"
Gaughran said. Haber, the first
man to beat East Germany's
Olympic Gold Medalist Rolland
Mathes in eight years, was an
NCAA champion last year. "He
was just waiting for Bruner,"
Gaughran said. The USC star won
the race by two seconds.
Hencken, Corliss Strong
Stanford's own gold medalist
John Hencken won his specialty,
the 200 yard breaststroke, with
Card Stu Corliss finishing a strong
second. Hencken, also swimming
three races, was later defeated by
USC's Alan Poucher in the closest
race of the day; the 200 yard
individual medley was decided by
.04 seconds.
Corliss improved upon his
lifetime best in the 200 breast for
the eighth consecutive week. He
now has the sixth best time in the
country in that event. The
surprising freshman "just keeps
getting better," in the words of
the Card coach.
Stan/ord received a strong
performance from Wayne Wager
who won the one meter diving.
Gaughran was also pleased with

Bruce Goodwin's third place in
the 100 yard freestyle and strong
third leg in the 400 yard freestyle
relay. It was a showing that
Gaug'iran said "bodes well for
nationals."
Stanford meets California, in
Berkeley, this weekend, in their
last dual meet of the season. They
then begin preparing for the
NCAA championships March 8 in
Cleveland.

KEEPING AFLOAT — Stanford swimmers, with few exceptions, were drubbed by USC on Saturday.
John Hencken, pictured above, was one of the few Cards to take a first-place in the meet. Hencken won
the 200-yard breaststroke, but came in second in the 200 individual medley, shown here.
