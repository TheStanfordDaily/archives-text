# Grapplers Get Axe By Scalping Cal
## 
### MARK FUNK 
There's finally proof.
Stanford's wrestling team has at
long last come of age. And they
did it in grand fashion, whipping
rival California 24-14 Friday night
in Maples Pavilion.
There was just a little extra in
their performance. Maybe. Maybe
it was because the grapplers were
competing for their very own axe
for the first time. Or maybe
Stanford was motivated by
revenge. After all, they had lost
their season opener to the Bears.
But whatever it was, the Cards put
on what was unquestionably their
finest performance of the season.
The California match proved
something else, too. Stanford may
no longer be the Pacific Eight's
perennial cellar-dweller. There's
some talent out on the mats that
will go a long way in this week's
Pac-8 tournament in Corvallis.
Horpel At Best
Take Chris Horpel for instance.
Other Pac-8 wrestlers probably
won't. Everybody knows just how
good Chris is — he's an
Ail-American. But Friday his
performance defied superlatives.
Let's leave it at this — no matter
how bland, Horpel was at his best.
He almost pinned Cal's
150-pounder Steve Whebdey in
the first round. He didn't, though,
and his match was just that much
more interesting. It gave Horpel a
chance to show off almost all of
the moves in his repetoire — and
there are many — as he moved to
a 15-5 win.
That one had the fans — about
a thousand in all — pummeling
each other in ecstasy.
Yancey Wins
Before Horpel set them off,
they had been primed by wins by
Mark Yancey, who cut 12 pounds
this week to get down to 134, and
Ken Krebs who weighed out at
142.
Normally, a wrestler who drops
12 pounds in 36 hours is
considerably weakened. Not so
Yancey— at least he didn't look
like it as he scored a major
decision over Buddy Miller 14-3.
It was a good win for Yancey,
who has been wrestling under the
shadow of Krebs at 142 for most

of this year. Now that both are
able to wrestle, it strengthens the
Cardinal line-up immensely.
And Krebs did his part,
defeating defending Pac-8
champion Brent Jacinto 4-3. 0.K.,
it was 4-4 and a draw, but only a
questionable call by the referee
(and ask any fan who was there —
they'll tell you in no uncertain
terms just how questionable it
was) snatched the win from him.
Krebs deserved it, no doubt about
it. He, too, has hit top form and
will be a force at the Pac-B's.
Govea Pins Opponent
So has John Govea. He pinned
Luis Miamoni in 1:59 of the first
round. "I think John was insulted
that Miamoni had almost taken
him down," head coach Joe
DeMeo commented after the
match. "Within 25 seconds he
threw a fireman's carry on him,
put on a half-nelson, rolled him
over and stuck him to the mat."
Easy as that. It should come that
easy in Corvallis. It won't, but
Govea could place high anyway.
Craig Reynolds also picked up
a win, defeating Brad Druktenis
6-5.
So all that remains is the Pac-8
tournament. DeMeo thinks he's
got seven men who've got a
chance to place there and go on to
the NCAA tournament including
all those who won or drew Friday.
They may pull Stanford out of
the cellar.

a thousand in all — pummeling
each other in ecstasy.
Yancey Wins
Before Horpel set them off,
they had been primed by wins by
Mark Yancey, who cut 12 pounds
this week to get down to 134, and
Ken Krebs who weighed out at
142.
Normally, a wrestler who drops
12 pounds in 36 hours is
considerably weakened. Not so
Yancey— at least he didn't look
like it as he scored a major
decision over Buddy Miller 14-3.
It was a good win for Yancey,
who has been wrestling under the
shadow of Krebs at 142 for most

of this year. Now that both are
able to wrestle, it strengthens the
Cardinal line-up immensely.
And Krebs did his part,
defeating defending Pac-8
champion Brent Jacinto 4-3. 0.K.,
it was 4-4 and a draw, but only a
questionable call by the referee
(and ask any fan who was there —
they'll tell you in no uncertain
terms just how questionable it
was) snatched the win from him.
Krebs deserved it, no doubt about
it. He, too, has hit top form and
will be a force at the Pac-B's.
Govea Pins Opponent
So has John Govea. He pinned
Luis Miamoni in 1:59 of the first
round. "I think John was insulted
that Miamoni had almost taken
him down," head coach Joe
DeMeo commented after the
match. "Within 25 seconds he
threw a fireman's carry on him,
put on a half-nelson, rolled him
over and stuck him to the mat."
Easy as that. It should come that
easy in Corvallis. It won't, but
Govea could place high anyway.
Craig Reynolds also picked up
a win, defeating Brad Druktenis
6-5.
So all that remains is the Pac-8
tournament. DeMeo thinks he's
got seven men who've got a
chance to place there and go on to
the NCAA tournament including
all those who won or drew Friday.
They may pull Stanford out of
the cellar.
There's finally proof.
Stanford's wrestling team has at
long last come of age. And they
did it in grand fashion, whipping
rival California 24-14 Friday night
in Maples Pavilion.
There was just a little extra in
their performance. Maybe. Maybe
it was because the grapplers were
competing for their very own axe
for the first time. Or maybe
Stanford was motivated by
revenge. After all, they had lost
their season opener to the Bears.
But whatever it was, the Cards put
on what was unquestionably their
finest performance of the season.
The California match proved
something else, too. Stanford may
no longer be the Pacific Eight's
perennial cellar-dweller. There's
some talent out on the mats that
will go a long way in this week's
Pac-8 tournament in Corvallis.
Horpel At Best
Take Chris Horpel for instance.
Other Pac-8 wrestlers probably
won't. Everybody knows just how
good Chris is — he's an
Ail-American. But Friday his
performance defied superlatives.
Let's leave it at this — no matter
how bland, Horpel was at his best.
He almost pinned Cal's
150-pounder Steve Whebdey in
the first round. He didn't, though,
and his match was just that much
more interesting. It gave Horpel a
chance to show off almost all of
the moves in his repetoire — and
there are many — as he moved to
a 15-5 win.
That one had the fans — about
a thousand in all — pummeling
each other in ecstasy.
