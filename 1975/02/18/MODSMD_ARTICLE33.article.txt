# No Rest Before Nor-Cals
## Netlers Retain Indoor Title 
### RON BECK 
Don't expect any surprises
from the Stanford tennis team
this year.
As if it was necessary, the
Cards showed everybody that,
sure enough, the same team that
won last year's NCAA title is back
once more.
The Card netters stormed
through a field of 16 teams in
Madison, Wis. to capture their
second National Collegiate Team
Indoor Championship in as many
tries.
The four-day tourney started
last Thursday with Stanford
demonstrating its strength and
depth to an overwhelmed
Oklahoma State team. The Cards
didn't lose a set in a 9-0 blitz.
Good Follow-Up
Stanford followed up the
whitewash with another big
victory on Friday against Utah.
Nick Saviano and Mark Mitchell
lost at second doubles to give
Utah its only point in an 8-1 loss.
On Saturday, Georgia, the
Southeastern Conference champs,
met Stanford in the semifinal
round. Jim Delaney's
younger brother, Tim, played for
Georgia, and was one of nine
Georgian casualties. The Cards
again played shutout tennis, not
losing a single set.
Michigan, the defending Big
Ten champions, had the
misfortune of winding up the
tourney against Stanford. The
Cards lost their first singles match

of the week (and season) at third
singles, when Fred de Jesus
topped Pat DuPre, 6-2, 7-6.
Stanford had the match and title
sewn up after winning five of the
six singles.
Strong Michigan Doubles
The Wolverines won the first
and second doubles matches to
come out with only a 6-3 loss, but
it was a deceiving score. Stanford
coach Dick Gould noted that it
was depth that beat the
Wolverines, not strength. "If you
take off the fifth and sixth singles
and the third doubles matches,
like the NCAA tournament does,
then we only had a 3-3 tie with
them [Michigan 1," Gould said.
Gould added that, "We were
really trying hard in the doubles.
They've just got two really good
doubles teams."
Gould rates Michigan as one of
the three best teams in the nation,
along with UCLA and Stanford.
"Michigan is a very good team.
They're just about the only team
besides UCLA and ourselves that

has a good chance for the NCAA
title," Gould said.
Pac-8 rival USC got eliminated
earlier in the tournament by the
eventual third-place winner,
Texas. One of the Trojans' top
players, Hans Gildemeister, was
not eligible to play in the
tournament. His loss was
especially painful to USC when
the Trojans lost in a close match
to the Longhorns.
No Gloating Time
The Cards are barely going to
have any rest from the week's
work, as they start defense of
their Nor-Cal Intercollegiate Team
Championship at San Jose State
tomorrow through Saturday.
Stanford is, of course, favored to
again win the championship
easily.
While California and San Jose
State battle for second place, the
Cards will probably end up
playing each other for the
individual titles.
Chip Fisher, who has won the
doubles title three years in a row

with three different partners,
probably could have sold his
partnership for a good price.
Unfortunately for Fisher, he is
ineligible to play until spring
quarter due to graduation conflicts.
Stanford: Top Seeds
The announced seedings were
top-heavy with Stanford players.
Cards filled five of the top six
spots in singles and the top two
double slots.
John Whitlinger, seeded first,
will try to defend his singles title.
Last year at this tourney,
Whitlinger first showed signs that
he would be one of the top
college players when he outclassed
all the opposition, including his
teammates.
Delaney, Saviano and DuPre
are seeded second through fourtli
followed by Hank Pfister of San
Jose State. Bill Maze at number
six, is the last Stanford singles seed.
