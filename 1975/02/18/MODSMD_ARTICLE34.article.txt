Rugby
There's a faint ray of hope for
the Stanford rugby team.
After suffering through a 31-13
schellacking at the hands of the
UCLA Bruins on Saturday for
their fourth consecutive loss, the
Cards played the perennial national
rugby champion Santa Monica
Rugby Club even for three-fourths
of a contest yesterday, before
succumbing 12-9 on a Santa
Monica penalty kick.
Stanford had never beaten
Santa Monica since the club broke
off from UCLA three years ago.
In fact the Cards had never come
within 12 points of the national
champs. Santa Monica beat the
BATS, a team which humiliated
Stanford 42-0 last week. But the
Cards soon shocked many of the
beer drinking rugby fans out of
their stupior.
Trailing 3-0 early in the first
half, Stanford wing Chris Guarino
intercepted an errant Santa
Monica pass at mid-field and raced
50 yards for a try. Lawrie
Lieberman's conversion gave the
Cards a 6-3 lead. Even a Santa
Monica try which gave the Santa
Monica a 9-6 halftime advantage
didn't dim the fans' hopes.
Lieberman tied the score for
the third time midway through
the second half on a 25-yard
penalty kick and it looked like the
contest might end in a tie. Until
Santa Monica's John McDermott
put a 30-yard penalty kick
through the uprights for the win.
Still it was a moral victory for the
Cards.

Golf
It only took Stanford three
days to even its season golf series
with San Jose State.
After finishing second to the
Spartans in last Tuesday's
University of California
Invitational, the Cards came back
Friday to defeat SJS by seven
strokes in the five-team Cal
State-Hayward Invitational at
Hayward Municipal golf course.
Stanford tied the host team

in the 18-hole event with 291
team totals. San Jose State
finished third at 298, followed by
California (309) and Pacific (313).
Hayward's Mike Powers won
the individual title with a
two-under-par 70. Stanford's Dave
Baskins and Hayward's Roger
Armstrong each fired 71s, while
Aly Trompas of the Cardinals
finished in a fourth-place tie at
72.
Other Stanford scores were
Mike Peck (73), Jay Johnston
(75), Conrad Nilmeier (76) and
Mike Mcßride (81).
