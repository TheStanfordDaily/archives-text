Texan Enters Presidential Raee
WASHINGTON — Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen became the
fifth formal Democratic entry in the 1976 presidential race
yesterday, expressing confidence he could win support and
raise money outside his native Texas.
"I wouldn't have entered this race unless I thought I was
going to win it,"the 54-year-old Texas Democrat told
several hundred backers and reporters in the Senate Caucus
Room.
Nevertheless, he said, he would seek simultaneous
re-election to the Senate from Texas next year, as did
Lyndon B. Johnson when he was elected vice president in
1960.
Bentsen conceded that most of the $1 million he has
raised so far and most of his tangible political support is
from Texas.
Asked for specific examples of support outside Texas,
Bentsen said he had been asked to keynote last year's
Democratic state convention in Connecticut and that he has
found "strong support... in all the major states I've gone
into."
Energy Plan Pleases Few Governors
WASHINGTON — President Ford's energy proposals
enjoy only minimal support from the nation's governors as
they gather here for their annual midwinter meeting
opening today.
Energy and the nation's economic woes dominate the
agenda for the conference business sessions tomorrow and
Thursday.
Despite the President's recent efforts to sell his energy
package at regional meetings in the South, Southwest and
Middle West, an Associated Press survey showed yesterday
that few state executives back it, and some do only because
of a lack of an alternative.
Responses from about half the governors, representing a
cross-section both regionally and politically, showed
virtually every Democrat opposes Ford's energy plans while
Republicans are split.
"I don't favor the import tax on oil," said Utah Gov.
Calvin L. Rampton, a Democrat, this year's conference
chairman. If the price has to be increased to lower
consumption, he said, "I'd much rather see it on direct
gasoline consumption than to put it on crude."
Nixon To Give Pre-Presidential Papers
WASHINGTON — Former President Richard M. Nixon
plans to donate 1300 cubic feet of pre-presidential papers
to the United States, the General Services Administration
(GSA) said Monday.
GSA Administrator Arthur F. Sampson said he had
accepted the materials from the 1946-66 period on behalf
of the United States and they would be stored at a National
Archives facility at Laguna Miguel, Calif.
In his letter offering to donate the papers, Nixon had
asked that they be kept at a facility "reasonably accessible"
to his San Clemente, Calif., home.
Papers and other materials dealing with Nixon's years as
president remain in Washington under court order.
A special three-judge court is to consider ownership of
the presidential papers, which have been the subject of legal
action.
A lower court ruled that the presidential papers are the
property of the country and not Nixon, but that order was
stayed, pending a decision of the special panel.
In his Jan. 28 letter to Sampson, Nixon said he planned to
make the pre-presidential papers "available for the purpose
of study and research as soon as possible and to the fullest
extent possible."
AFL-CIO Calls For Tax Cut
MIAMI BEACH — AFL-CIO President George Meany
called yesterday for a $30 billion tax cut, saying the $20
billion program swiftly gaining ground in Congress will not

be enough to turn the economy around.
A month ago, a $22 billion tax cut "looked like a pretty
good tax program, but the size of the problem and the
enormity of our dilemma has increased since then and I
think we're going to need much more," Meany said.
"Things are getting worse by the day. I think it might
have to go as high as $30 billion to give the incentive that
will get the economy turned around," he said.
A $20.1 billion tax package approved earlier by the
House Ways and Means Committee — $4 billion more than
proposed by President Ford — is expected to go to the full
House this week when it returns from its Lincoln Day
recess.
At a news conference, Meany reiterated his prediction of
a week ago that the unemployment rate will hit 10 percent
by July and said this is inevitable no matter what action
Congress takes.
The jobless rate hit a post-World War II peak of 8.2
percent in January, with 7.5 million workers unable to find
jobs.
Kissinger Confers With Gromyko
LONDON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
presented new, undisclosed proposals on nuclear weapons
controls and trade to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A.
Gromyko in Geneva yesterday and ran into some sharp
differences on his step-by-step Mideast strategy.
Kissinger then flew to London for talks with Prime
Minister Harold Wilson and Foreign Minister James
Callaghan, who earlier in the day signed a series of
cooperative agreements with the Soviets in Moscow.
On the Mideast, Gromyko reiterated to Kissinger the
Soviets' interest in an early resumption of the Geneva peace
conference and a place at the table for the Palestine
Liberation Organization. The United States opposes a quick
return to Geneva because of the dispute over Palestinian
participation, to which Israel is firmly opposed.
Kissinger prefers to continue his policy of gradual steps
toward Mideast peace on the basis of bilateral concessions
by Israel and various Arab states.
He came to Europe from a week of exploratory talks in
Jerusalem and Cairo in an attempt to obtain another Israeli
withdrawal in the Sinai in return for tangible moves by
Egypt toward a settlement.
Italy Suffers Seeond Major Art Theft
MILAN, Italy — Art thieves broke into Milan's municipal
museum before dawn yesterday and carried off 28
impressionist paintings estimated to be worth $1.5 million
to $3 million. It was the second major art theft in Italy in
two weeks.
Police said the thieves entered the downtown museum
by breaking a window and then disconnecting the alarm
system. They made their way to the modern wing while six
watchmen were in other galleries.
The stolen paintings included works by Van Gogh,
Cezanne, Renoir, Corot and other French, Dutch and
Italian artists.
"They were real experts. They picked the best works,"
said a police spokesman. "They were fast and precise,
leaving no trace behind except for the broken window."
Three priceless Renaissance paintings by Raphael and
Piero della Francesca stolen two weeks ago from the Ducal
Palace in Urbino are still missing.
The two thefts bore certain similarities. In both cases,
the thieves struck before dawn while guards were patroling
other galleries, and then removed the paintings from their
frames.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with considerable high
cloudiness. A little warmer. Lows tonight in the upper 30s
to upper 40s. Highs both days in the mid 50s to low 60s.
Northwest winds 5 to 15 mph.
