# Prof Named To Education Panel

By DREW KEELING
Education Prof. James G. March
has been appointed by President Ford
to a three-year term on the National
Council on Educational Research, the
policy-making body for the National
Institute of Education (NIE).
NIE, created by Congress under the
Higher Education Act of 1972, is the
educational research and development
arm of the Health, Education and
Welfare Department. The Institute has
been plagued by political difficulties in

its brief three-and-a-half year history,
not the least of which is funding.
Research and development money
for education is .3 percent of total
federal education expenditures as
compared to 4.6 percent in health and
10 percent in defense spending.
Appropriations for fiscal 1975 are $70
million, down from the 1973 level of
$110 million. Despite budget problems
however, NIE is conducting and
supporting research programs in a
"broad spectrum" of educational

fields.
Current projects include
investigations into basic learning
processes, studies relating to career
planning and an experiment in
educational vouchers (which allow
parents to choose their children's
school).
Although the chief emphasis of NIE
is on primary and secondary
education, the institute is providing
funds for higher education as well.
Seventy-five percent of the budget of
the Stanford Center for Research and
Development in Teaching (including
programs in teacher effectiveness, the
environment for teaching and
linguistic pluralism) are financed
through NIE funds.
The National Council on
Educational Research, meets eight or
nine times a year to set general policy
for NIE. Its fifteen members include
representatives from government,
business, and academia. Wilson C.
Riles, California Superintendent for
Public Instruction, was recently
appointed to his second term on the
Council. March said he is "looking
forward" to serving his first term on
the Council.
March, holder of the David Jacks
Professor of Higher Education, came
to Stanford in 1970. He also holds
appointments in the Political Science
and Sociology Departments and the
Business School. March has been
elected to the National Academy of
Sciences, and from 1968 to 1974 was
a member of the National Science
Board.
