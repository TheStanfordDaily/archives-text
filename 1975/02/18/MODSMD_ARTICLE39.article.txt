# Mexican Folkdancers Acclaimed With Ol√©s

### KATHY ALCALA 
Over 250 dancers joined in a
performance Sunday night which
climaxed a conference of Mexican
folkdance groups held here this
weekend.
Sponsored by the Ballet Folklorico
de Stanford, a dance group on campus,
the statewide conference included
performers from all over California, as
well as instructors from New Mexico,
Colorado and Mexico.
A mariachi group from UCLA also
performed.
"It went much better than any of
us had hoped," said Susan Cashion,
teaching associate in the Women's
Physical Education Department.
The conference was designed to
"bring representatives of the various
California dance groups together to
offer ideas for the national
convention," to "provide a setting for
an increased awareness of rich cultural
heritage and to educate the participants
in professional dancing techniques,"
according to La Onda, a Chicano
publication on campus.
Workshops were also conducted on
various types of dance for which the
dancers were divided by ability.
Ramon Morones, leader of the
"Lupenos" dance group from San
Jose, taught a workshop on dances
from the Mexican province of Jalisco,
and Marita Davila, instructor of
Spanish at Oakland's Laney College,
taught Peruvian dances.
Mark Fogelguist, a UCLA graduate
student, led a workshop on the
performance of mariachi music,
Cashion said. He also explained much
of the background and history of the
music to the dancers.
By understanding the structure and
origin of the music, the dancers "can
talk to musicians intelligently," said
Cashion, which she said is invaluable in
planning and choreographing dance
performances.
Last minute funds were provided
for the conference by several
University offices, said Marjie
Hernandez, head of the Ballet
Folklorico de Stanford. These
included $700 from Ed Shaw,
executive assistant vice president and
provost, $400 from Campus Affairs,

$150 from Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, and $100 from
MEChA. CeriJia Burciaga. special
assistant to the president, and ASSU
Special Events also assisted in the
conference.
The performance included dances
from various regions of Mexico, some
performed in traditional costume.
Highlights included a "Tango
Flamenco" which was performed
without music, "Danza del Ojo de
Agua" which is an homage to the
natural forces of wind, water, fire and
earth, and the "Danza de la Pluma" in
which the dancers wear three foot high
feather headdresses.
A national conference of Folklorico
groups is planned for later this year in
the Bay Area. Groups from all over the
Southwest will be invited to dance and
exchange ideas and experiences.

performance Sunday night which
climaxed a conference of Mexican
folkdance groups held here this
weekend.
Sponsored by the Ballet Folklorico
de Stanford, a dance group on campus,
the statewide conference included
performers from all over California, as
well as instructors from New Mexico,
Colorado and Mexico.
A mariachi group from UCLA also
performed.
"It went much better than any of
us had hoped," said Susan Cashion,
teaching associate in the Women's
Physical Education Department.
The conference was designed to
"bring representatives of the various
California dance groups together to
offer ideas for the national
convention," to "provide a setting for
an increased awareness of rich cultural
heritage and to educate the participants
in professional dancing techniques,"
according to La Onda, a Chicano
publication on campus.
Workshops were also conducted on
various types of dance for which the
dancers were divided by ability.
Ramon Morones, leader of the
"Lupenos" dance group from San
Jose, taught a workshop on dances
from the Mexican province of Jalisco,
and Marita Davila, instructor of
Spanish at Oakland's Laney College,
taught Peruvian dances.
Mark Fogelguist, a UCLA graduate
student, led a workshop on the
performance of mariachi music,
Cashion said. He also explained much
of the background and history of the
music to the dancers.
By understanding the structure and
origin of the music, the dancers "can
talk to musicians intelligently," said
Cashion, which she said is invaluable in
planning and choreographing dance
performances.
Last minute funds were provided
for the conference by several
University offices, said Marjie
Hernandez, head of the Ballet
Folklorico de Stanford. These
included $700 from Ed Shaw,
executive assistant vice president and
provost, $400 from Campus Affairs,

$150 from Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, and $100 from
MEChA. CeriJia Burciaga. special
assistant to the president, and ASSU
Special Events also assisted in the
conference.
The performance included dances
from various regions of Mexico, some
performed in traditional costume.
Highlights included a "Tango
Flamenco" which was performed
without music, "Danza del Ojo de
Agua" which is an homage to the
natural forces of wind, water, fire and
earth, and the "Danza de la Pluma" in
which the dancers wear three foot high
feather headdresses.
A national conference of Folklorico
groups is planned for later this year in
the Bay Area. Groups from all over the
Southwest will be invited to dance and
exchange ideas and experiences.
