# UFW Halts Picketing Of Liquor Stores To Participate In March To Modesto
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER KATHY SELIGMAN 
Supporters of the United Farm
Workers (UFW) will shift their
emphasis this week from picketing
liquor stores to participation in a
march to Modesto, the home of Gallo
wines.
Undergraduate Chris Coleman, a
chairman of the UFW Support
Committee, said this march is an
important demonstration of solidarity
and will not permanently interrupt
picketing.
Pickets have been concentrating
their efforts on Beltramo's Liquors
this quarter. Protestors are trying to
convince local liquor store owners, one
at a time, to remove Gallo wines from
their shelves, Coleman e>pltined.
The first two stores the UFW
supporters approached, Rol ! v Somer
and U-Save, agreed to stop c "lling
Gallo, after talking with pr ♦csi.ors,
Coleman said. The third store <, . their
list, Beltramo's Liquors, refused, and
the UFW Support Committee is now
picketing there on Friday and
Saturday nights.
Since the picketing at Beltramo's
has begun, Roily Somer and U-Save
have returned Gallo wine to their
shelves.

"We're staying with Beltramo's
because they're influential. Several
other owners have said they will take
Gallo off the shelves if Beltramo
does," Coleman said.
John Beltramo, owner of

Beltramo's Liquors, said he does not
think his actions will influence other
stores. He maintained that he will not
take Gallo off his shelves, describing
the pickets as more of a "nuisance"
than a serious threat to his business.
The pickets have been turning away
some customers, "but not many,
really," Beltramo reported. He added
that some people buy Gallo after they
get inside because they are irritated by
the pickets.
A group in Palo Alto has convinced
A-l Liquors on El Camino to put its
Gallo in storage. Pickets now try to
divert customers from the nearby
Ernie's to A-l on Friday and Saturday
nights.
This "secondary boycott" strategy
is directed at stores carrying the
product instead of at the specific item.
Secondary boycotts are forbidden by
the Taft-Hartley amendment to the
National Labor Relations Act
(NLRA), but agricultural workers are
not covered by the NLRA. As a result,
secondary wine and produce boycotts
are legal.
'Victim'
Beltramo, however, said he felt
"the boycott must be illegal" because
it is "forcing him to act as a court of
law." He said his store is a victim of
the dispute between the UFW and the
Teamsters and he does not want to
pass judgment.
Coleman said that the lettuce and
table grape boycotts are still
continuing, but Gallo wine is now the
main concern of the UFW. Table

grapes have been effectively taken off
the shelves, he added.
Coleman estimated that the
boycott has reduced Gallo sales in the
Bay Area by 20 percent. Nationwide,
the figure varies between nine and 22
percent, he said.
Official Gallo publications deny
that the boycott is significantly
decreasing sales. Gallo points out that
"beverage wine" sales are down for all
distributors.
Gallo Campaign
Gallo, which claims to be neutral,
has started a campaign to present the
other side of the farmworker dispute.
Undergraduate Steve Westly
distributes literature in the dorms and
attends monthly meetings with Gallo
representatives to discuss the
company's image on campus.
The dispute started in 1973, when
the contract between Gallo and the
UFW expired. When three months of
negotiations failed to produce a new
agreement, Gallo signed a contract
with the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, who claimed to represent
the workers.
UFW has been picketing for 19
months, hoping to regain its position
representing farm labor. This weekend
marks the beginning of a week-long
symbolic march to Modesto, where
UFW groups from the Bay Area,
Southern California, and the Central
Valley will meet on Saturday,
March 1. The march will start from a
noon rally in Union Square this
Saturday.

Gallo Campaign
Gallo, which claims to be neutral,
has started a campaign to present the
other side of the farmworker dispute.
Undergraduate Steve Westly
distributes literature in the dorms and
attends monthly meetings with Gallo
representatives to discuss the
company's image on campus.
The dispute started in 1973, when
the contract between Gallo and the
UFW expired. When three months of
negotiations failed to produce a new
agreement, Gallo signed a contract
with the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, who claimed to represent
the workers.
UFW has been picketing for 19
months, hoping to regain its position
representing farm labor. This weekend
marks the beginning of a week-long
symbolic march to Modesto, where
UFW groups from the Bay Area,
Southern California, and the Central
Valley will meet on Saturday,
March 1. The march will start from a
noon rally in Union Square this
Saturday.
Supporters of the United Farm
Workers (UFW) will shift their
emphasis this week from picketing
liquor stores to participation in a
march to Modesto, the home of Gallo
wines.
Undergraduate Chris Coleman, a
chairman of the UFW Support
Committee, said this march is an
important demonstration of solidarity
and will not permanently interrupt
picketing.
Pickets have been concentrating
their efforts on Beltramo's Liquors
this quarter. Protestors are trying to
convince local liquor store owners, one
at a time, to remove Gallo wines from
their shelves, Coleman e>pltined.
The first two stores the UFW
supporters approached, Rol ! v Somer
and U-Save, agreed to stop c "lling
Gallo, after talking with pr ♦csi.ors,
Coleman said. The third store <, . their
list, Beltramo's Liquors, refused, and
the UFW Support Committee is now
picketing there on Friday and
Saturday nights.
Since the picketing at Beltramo's
has begun, Roily Somer and U-Save
have returned Gallo wine to their
shelves.

"We're staying with Beltramo's
because they're influential. Several
other owners have said they will take
Gallo off the shelves if Beltramo
does," Coleman said.
John Beltramo, owner of

Beltramo's Liquors, said he does not
think his actions will influence other
stores. He maintained that he will not
take Gallo off his shelves, describing
the pickets as more of a "nuisance"
than a serious threat to his business.
The pickets have been turning away
some customers, "but not many,
really," Beltramo reported. He added
that some people buy Gallo after they
get inside because they are irritated by
the pickets.
A group in Palo Alto has convinced
A-l Liquors on El Camino to put its
Gallo in storage. Pickets now try to
divert customers from the nearby
Ernie's to A-l on Friday and Saturday
nights.
This "secondary boycott" strategy
is directed at stores carrying the
product instead of at the specific item.
Secondary boycotts are forbidden by
the Taft-Hartley amendment to the
National Labor Relations Act
(NLRA), but agricultural workers are
not covered by the NLRA. As a result,
secondary wine and produce boycotts
are legal.
'Victim'
Beltramo, however, said he felt
"the boycott must be illegal" because
it is "forcing him to act as a court of
law." He said his store is a victim of
the dispute between the UFW and the
Teamsters and he does not want to
pass judgment.
Coleman said that the lettuce and
table grape boycotts are still
continuing, but Gallo wine is now the
main concern of the UFW. Table

grapes have been effectively taken off
the shelves, he added.
Coleman estimated that the
boycott has reduced Gallo sales in the
Bay Area by 20 percent. Nationwide,
the figure varies between nine and 22
percent, he said.
Official Gallo publications deny
that the boycott is significantly
decreasing sales. Gallo points out that
"beverage wine" sales are down for all
distributors.
