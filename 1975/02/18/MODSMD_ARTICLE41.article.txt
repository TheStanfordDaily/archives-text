# Draft of C-UAFA Recommendations

### 
On Feb. 5, the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions
and Financial Aid approved significant changes in financial
aid packaging. They involve I) a change in criteria used to
assign students to aid categories and, II) modification of the
financial components in the various aid groups, particularly
an increase in the amount of self-help (assigned job or loan)
in all categories.
I. Changes in Criteria
In the past a special aid package was automatically given
to all students in those three minority groups (Black, Chicano
and Native American) on whose behalf the University has
undertaken a commitment to significantly increase enroll
ment. This package was exceptional in exceptional in that
self-help was eliminated in the first year and minimized
thereafter.
This package was presumed to have two functions:
a) It would alleviate financial burdens considered to be
unusually heavy for minority students, most of whom were
of very low income (VLI) background. This would facilitate
academic adjustment.
b) It would serve to make Stanford more attractive and
thereby increase the enrollment percentage for those minor
ity candidates who were admitted.
The impetus to modify the criterion came from a recogni
tion of the fact that the condition described in a) above is
one not found only among students in the three minorities
mentioned above. It was decided to retain the special package
concept but to remove the ethnic standard for eligibility and
replace it with an economic one, very low income status.
To illustrate, a student who comes from a three-child
family with a net income of $9,070 would Fit this category,
according to data developed by the Bureau of Labor Statis
tics and updated by the College Scholarship Service. A large
number of minority candidates are projected to fall in this
gToup, as are a number of students not in the three minor
ities. Because this package is close to the most favorable of all
University packages, it is considered to serve both functions
described above for the VLI minority student.
It was decided to keep an ethnic criterion in the aid
program in order to continue the second function above
(enhancement of enrollment probability) for those minority
candidates who were not of very low income background.
This is to be done by favorable modification of the aid
package that such students would otherwise receive were
they not members of the three minority groups on whose
behalf the University commitment was made.
For minority students, the self-help requirement would be
reduced to 5/6 of the regular obligation. This modification is
viewed as an inducement, in parallel with the reduced
self-help expectation applied to other groups of students (e.g.
unusually highly qualified academically) the University is
anxious to enroll.
In brief, the special package concept is kept, but assigned
on an economic rather than an ethnic criterion. The VLI
policy is addressed to a condition prevalent in the minorities
but not confined to them. The contept of preference
applying to all minority students is retained but on the basis
of a specific effort to enhance their enrollment. It takes the
form of a favorable package modification rather than a
separate package.
