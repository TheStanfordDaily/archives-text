11. Changes in the Composition of the Various Aid Packages
The assignment of students to aid categories takes the
following form. First, the classification is into "Very Low
Income" or "Other". Within the VLI there is no subdivision.
It is Category I. In the "Other" groups, three categories are
found. For convenience these may be termed "Highest
Academic" (IIA), "Diversity" (IIB) and "Standard" (IIC).
The proposed changes are to be applied to freshmen entering
in the fall of 1975.
Because expected parental contributions are to be calcu
lated on the basis of revisions in the national need assessment
scale, these contributions will be reduced. This change alone
will enlarge the sum of aid required to fund demonstrated
need. Increasing tuition and other costs enlarge it further.
In light of the limitation of general University funds, it is
appropriate that some of the increased aid take the form of
increased self-help. The apportionment of self-help among all
categories is a committee concern and it was felt no longer
reasonable to have any group of students totally exempt
from self-help, even for one year, while other students were
under sizeable and rising self-help obligations.
Hence there is self-help of $450 in Category I for the first
year. In response to input from an open meeting and from
minority representatives, the committee decided that the first
year obligation should be small (reduced from an original
proposal of $700) and should be capable of being met by
either loan or job, at the student's option.
Flexibility, in the form of departures from the described
schedules, is still to be shown by the Financial Aids Office
whenever extenuating circumstances dictate. For example, it
is recognized that some students, often of minority and/or
VLI background, have difficulty in meeting the summer

moderate income, discretion will be exercised to avoid an
unreasonable amount of loan and job help.
The accompanying table, prepared by Financial Aids
Director Robert Huff, is useful for comparison purposes. It
shows that the new special package Category I, while less
generous than before, none the less is markedly different
from the standard Category (IIC). The total self-help over
four years in Category 1 is $2,850 compared to the $6,200 in
Category lIC. To the extent that parental contributions can
be made, the total self-help obligation in Category lIC is
reduced.

In this schedule, (IIC), the self-help is just about one-fifth
of the total costs over four years, and the accumulated debt
is about 10% of the total cost. For Category I these
expectations are roughly halved.
It is anticipated that non-VLI minority students will
normally fall in Category 118. Their self-help obligations will
be five-sixths of the non-ininority student in that category.
These schedules are considered consonant with the objec
tives of enrolling highly qualified undergraduates, insuring
diversity in the student body, and seeing to it that all
students have a reasonable prospect for meeting the costs of
their education without excessive debt or term-time work.

11. Changes in the Composition of the Various Aid Packages
The assignment of students to aid categories takes the
following form. First, the classification is into "Very Low
Income" or "Other". Within the VLI there is no subdivision.
It is Category I. In the "Other" groups, three categories are
found. For convenience these may be termed "Highest
Academic" (IIA), "Diversity" (IIB) and "Standard" (IIC).
The proposed changes are to be applied to freshmen entering
in the fall of 1975.
Because expected parental contributions are to be calcu
lated on the basis of revisions in the national need assessment
scale, these contributions will be reduced. This change alone
will enlarge the sum of aid required to fund demonstrated
need. Increasing tuition and other costs enlarge it further.
In light of the limitation of general University funds, it is
appropriate that some of the increased aid take the form of
increased self-help. The apportionment of self-help among all
categories is a committee concern and it was felt no longer
reasonable to have any group of students totally exempt
from self-help, even for one year, while other students were
under sizeable and rising self-help obligations.
Hence there is self-help of $450 in Category I for the first
year. In response to input from an open meeting and from
minority representatives, the committee decided that the first
year obligation should be small (reduced from an original
proposal of $700) and should be capable of being met by
either loan or job, at the student's option.
Flexibility, in the form of departures from the described
schedules, is still to be shown by the Financial Aids Office
whenever extenuating circumstances dictate. For example, it
is recognized that some students, often of minority and/or
VLI background, have difficulty in meeting the summer

The accompanying table, prepared by Financial Aids
Director Robert Huff, is useful for comparison purposes. It
shows that the new special package Category I, while less
generous than before, none the less is markedly different
from the standard Category (IIC). The total self-help over
four years in Category 1 is $2,850 compared to the $6,200 in
Category lIC. To the extent that parental contributions can
be made, the total self-help obligation in Category lIC is
reduced.

In this schedule, (IIC), the self-help is just about one-fifth
of the total costs over four years, and the accumulated debt
is about 10% of the total cost. For Category I these
expectations are roughly halved.
It is anticipated that non-VLI minority students will
normally fall in Category 118. Their self-help obligations will
be five-sixths of the non-ininority student in that category.
These schedules are considered consonant with the objec
tives of enrolling highly qualified undergraduates, insuring
diversity in the student body, and seeing to it that all
students have a reasonable prospect for meeting the costs of
their education without excessive debt or term-time work.
