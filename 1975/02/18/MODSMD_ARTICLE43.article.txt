# Statement of Ethnic Minority Task Force
## 
### 
This communique is respectfully submitted to the
Steering Committee of the Senate of the Academic Council
because time constraints prohibited its submission to the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aids
before this Committee submitted its recommendation on
Feb. 6 to the Senate Steering Committee regarding revisions
in financial aid packaging.
Introduction
In late November 1974, Dr. Robert P. Huff, director of
financial aids, distributed request to assist the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aids (C-UAFA) in
considering a change in the packaging of financial aid for
freshman minority students.
In response to this direct request for assistance, Deans
Gwen Shunatona and Harold Boyd cooperatively called
together a body of ethnic minority faculty, staff, and
students. This group reflected the ethnic and cultural con
cerns of Black, Chicano, and Native American students who
would possibly be directly affected by changes proposed in
"Draft Report on Minority Financial Aid Packaging."
The express purpose of this group of ethnic minorities
was and still is solely to assist C-UAFA, the Senate, and the
University in general in our consideration of a change in the
packaging of financial aid for freshman minority students. As
members of the University community, we believe the re
sponsibility of assistance is incumbent upon us.
To bear focus, for ourselves and others, on our intent and
purpose we identified ourselves as the Ethnic Minority Task
Force on Financial Aids (EMTF-FA). After our establish
ment, we invited representation from the Asian American
community. ,
Entering the task we set for ourselves with all seriousness
and good faith, we studied the earlier mentioned documents;
deliberated the affects of the proposed changes; apprised
ourselves of the "legal concerns" (as mentioned in the
November draft) by meeting with University attorneys Iris
Brest and James Siena; informed ourselves of the policy
issues through discussion with authors of the aforementioned
drafts, Drs. Huff and Paul B. Green (in a meeting to which
Dean Fred Hargadon was invited but unable to attend);
communicated directly with C-UAFA members in writing;
and presented our views in terms of cultural perspectives.
In response to our Task Force's request for a meeting
between C-UAFA and EMTF-FA, the Committee eventually
allowed a maximum of two representatives from each ethnic
community to meet with C-UAFA. As a result of this

meeting, the Task Force believes C-UAFA members are
acting in good faith but lack time and adequate facts to make
an informed decision at this time on financial aid packaging
for ethnic minority students.
Recom menda tions:
1. Because of the concerns stated above, the MTF on
Financial Aids recommends that C-UAFA delay the decision
to support or ratify the proposed change in Financial Aid
policy for incoming freshmen. It has become evident that
further investigation is warranted in order to fully assess the
myriad of ramifications that such a change would initiate.
2. That discussions regarding the formulation of changes
in Financial Aid policy be held with representatives from the
Minority Task Force. A cooperative effort is needed in order
to arrive at a cogent policy that addresses the relevant
philosophical, educational, and legal considerations for all
concerned.
3. That a meeting be held with members of the Task
Force before a public statement is made about any change in
the Financial Aids policy.
4. That the Senate Steering Committee refer the docu
ment back to C-UAFA so that discussion can continue with
the cooperation of Minority Task Force representation.
