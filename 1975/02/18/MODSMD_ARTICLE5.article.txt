# Minority Students Want Aid Changes Postponed
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Changes in financial aid for
freshman minority students should be
postponed for further study, according
to a task force claiming to represent
ethnic minority students here.
In an advertisement in today's
Daily, the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (CUAFA) presents its
draft report on an overhaul of the
minority aid structure, with a critical
statement from the self-proclaimed
Ethnic Minority Task Force on
Financial Aid (EMTF-FA).
Harold Boyd, associate dean of
students, and one of the task force
initiators, argued last night that
further study of data is needed before
a final decision is reached.
"The basis of a postponement is
predicated on what we perceived
as . . . the committee's not
understanding the full ramifications of
what they were proposing. We
felt. . . they shouldn't rush into this
thing without full consideration,"
Boyd commented.

But Paul Green, biology professor
and chairman of CUAFA, said that
inaction by the committee would have
placed greater self-help burdens on
non-minority students.
"We know that [postponement] is
their position," Green said last night.
"But it turns out that, if we do
nothing, we would be putting burdens
on all other students. So doing nothing
would have ramifications on all
students."
Green noted that further study
would have been "preferable," but
that time pressures do exist. The
Faculty Senate must pass on CUAFA's
recommendations at its meeting
Thursday in order to state a position
for the March meeting of the Board of
Trustees.
"One never has full consideration,"
Green added. "What we do have to
consider is the whole student body.
We have to do it every year on the
basis of the information we have on
hand."
Anxieties
Boyd said the EMTF-FA had not
publicized its activities previously to
avoid premature anxieties.
"[Early publicity] was one of the
errors made by CUAFA. They
publicized the rough draft of a report
that caused anxiety among minority
communities," Boyd said. "Our task
force came together to examine the
questions raised . . . seeking to find
why the committee has come up with
this recommendation."
Green explained the committee's
rationale for its final draft.
"The old package had two
functions: one, to alleviate the
problems associated with
very-low-income backgrounds — this
should be applied everywhere it's
found; and two, if the University
wants to have an affirmative-action
policy — which I am strongly in favor
of — you give an honorable

inducement.
"The crux of the matter in the
committee was realizing that you can
differentiate between an alleviation
and an inducement. We've been able to
'buy' the two functions, but apply the
alleviation to all very-low-income
students," Green concluded.
But Boyd criticized the committee
for reaching its conclusions "hastily,"
adding that input from the minority
communities was insufficient.
"As one person, I don't think there
was enough input from the minority
communities. This is a serious
thing ... something as serious as this
should require all of the study, all of
the research, all of the information
that is available," Boyd remarked.
Green countered that the minority
task force had not considered the
plight of low-income non-Yninority
students.
Burden ... Or Encourage?
"We have not been met by a task
force representing very-low-income
non-minority students," Green noted.
"You have to ask: 'How much do you
want to burden other students?' Of
course, the (minority] task force
doesn't have to make these
considerations."
Boyd questioned the effect that the
CUAFA recommendation would have
on affirmative action pledges by the
University.
"If you have a commitment to
encourage minority students to pursue
higher education, then you should
view it in that light," Boyd observed.
Green argued that the committee's
recommendations were sufficient to
encourage minority enrollment.
"We could have given both
[minority and very-low-income 1
preferences to ... students, but we
felt it would be sweetening it too
much. We decided [we went] about as
far as we can go," Green said.

"The old package had two
functions: one, to alleviate the
problems associated with
very-low-income backgrounds — this
should be applied everywhere it's
found; and two, if the University
wants to have an affirmative-action

of — you give an honorable

inducement.
"The crux of the matter in the
committee was realizing that you can
differentiate between an alleviation
and an inducement. We've been able to
'buy' the two functions, but apply the
alleviation to all very-low-income
students," Green concluded.
But Boyd criticized the committee
for reaching its conclusions "hastily,"
adding that input from the minority
communities was insufficient.
"As one person, I don't think there
was enough input from the minority
communities. This is a serious
thing ... something as serious as this
should require all of the study, all of
the research, all of the information
that is available," Boyd remarked.
Green countered that the minority
task force had not considered the
plight of low-income non-Yninority
students.
Burden ... Or Encourage?
"We have not been met by a task
force representing very-low-income
non-minority students," Green noted.
"You have to ask: 'How much do you
want to burden other students?' Of
course, the (minority] task force
doesn't have to make these
considerations."
Boyd questioned the effect that the
CUAFA recommendation would have
on affirmative action pledges by the
University.
"If you have a commitment to
encourage minority students to pursue
higher education, then you should
view it in that light," Boyd observed.
Green argued that the committee's
recommendations were sufficient to
encourage minority enrollment.
"We could have given both
[minority and very-low-income 1
preferences to ... students, but we
felt it would be sweetening it too
much. We decided [we went] about as
far as we can go," Green said.
Changes in financial aid for
freshman minority students should be
postponed for further study, according
to a task force claiming to represent
ethnic minority students here.
In an advertisement in today's
Daily, the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (CUAFA) presents its
draft report on an overhaul of the
minority aid structure, with a critical
statement from the self-proclaimed
Ethnic Minority Task Force on
Financial Aid (EMTF-FA).
Harold Boyd, associate dean of
students, and one of the task force
initiators, argued last night that
further study of data is needed before
a final decision is reached.
"The basis of a postponement is
predicated on what we perceived
as . . . the committee's not
understanding the full ramifications of
what they were proposing. We
felt. . . they shouldn't rush into this
thing without full consideration,"
Boyd commented.

But Paul Green, biology professor
and chairman of CUAFA, said that
inaction by the committee would have
placed greater self-help burdens on
non-minority students.
"We know that [postponement] is
their position," Green said last night.
"But it turns out that, if we do
nothing, we would be putting burdens
on all other students. So doing nothing
would have ramifications on all
students."
Green noted that further study
would have been "preferable," but
that time pressures do exist. The
Faculty Senate must pass on CUAFA's
recommendations at its meeting
Thursday in order to state a position
for the March meeting of the Board of
Trustees.
"One never has full consideration,"
Green added. "What we do have to
consider is the whole student body.
We have to do it every year on the
basis of the information we have on
hand."
Anxieties
Boyd said the EMTF-FA had not
publicized its activities previously to
avoid premature anxieties.
"[Early publicity] was one of the
errors made by CUAFA. They
publicized the rough draft of a report
that caused anxiety among minority
communities," Boyd said. "Our task
force came together to examine the
questions raised . . . seeking to find
why the committee has come up with
this recommendation."
Green explained the committee's
rationale for its final draft.
"The old package had two
functions: one, to alleviate the
problems associated with
very-low-income backgrounds — this
