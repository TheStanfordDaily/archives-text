# SCIRE Task Force Makes Effort To Tackle Problems Of Transfers
## 
### RON ELVING 
The list of problems facing
undergraduates who transfer here after
one or more years at another college
has become a familiar litany of
complaints. In an effort to meet these
needs of transfer students, SCIRE
Director Alice Supton established a
task force, in operation for the past
year, combining student, faculty and
administration resources.
Karen Murray, assistant to the dean
of student affairs for residential
education, has called SCIRE's transfer
orientation the first "coherent
program" of its kind here.

Murray estimated that "99 percent
of the transfer's problems" stem from
the shortage of housing. Since
transfers are only assigned spaces left
available after all incoming freshmen
have been given assignments, the great
majority must find accommodations in
the community at-large. Murray also
pointed out that this isolation leads to
social and academic problems.
The SCIRE task force thus
concentrated their first efforts on a
position paper which, Supton pointed
out, advocated the policy of automatic
on-campus placement later adopted in
the Housing Office's proposal for a
new draw system. Although this may
represent an ultimate solution for the
future, Supton and Murray agreed that
the new draw may not be operative
until 1976 at the earliest and other
programs are needed in the interim.
Transfer Edition
To fill the immediate need, Supton
said, the SCIRE task force is writing a
special version of Approaching
Stanford (currently mailed to newly
admitted freshmen) for transfers.
Supton also reported the fall
quarter orientation's emphasis on
housing and a winter quarter revival of
the "buddy" system. Tried once
before (in 1971), this idea calls for
returning students to act as on-call
sources of information and assistance
for incoming transfers.
Moving beyond the housing
problem, the SCIRE task force has
made a considerable contribution to
the transfers' social and academic
integration into the Stanford
environment, Supton said. She noted
the transfer student party organized
with the help of ASSU Special Events,
the sherry hours with faculty, and the
orientation sessions with personnel
from the Dean of Student Affairs
Office.
On the drawing board for next year
is an on-campus lounge for off-campus
students, a home base which would
feature its own facilities, social
schedule, and resident assistant.
On the academic front, Supton
outlined plans for an "Advising Fair,"
tentatively slated for the patio behind
Bowman Alumni House, which would
allow transfers to meet faculty,
personnel from the Academic
Information Center and Career.
Planning and Placement Center, and
other returning students interested in

preparing them for registration and
course work.
Uncertain Future
The questions surrounding SCIRE's
continued existence beyond June have
cast a certain amount of doubt upon
the continuation of the new transfer
progiams. Both Supton and Murray
have discussed possible increases in
commitments from other agencies.
Murray suggested that a portion of
the freshman orientation budget might
be shifted to the transfers, but
stressed that no decision had been
made. ASSU President Mike Herman
commented that "one would hope
that a future Council of Presidents
would consider a commitment to all
incoming students' orientation," but
noted that no promise could be made
for them.
The orientation program this fall
produced a Transfer Student Society
which hopes to work with SCIRE. The
society's treasurer, Liane Collins, said
her group will be working on "setting
up the lounge and the kinds of things
that people in dorms have." Collins
said she could not speculate on the
society's exact role, should the SCIRE
program be discontinued.
Supton stressed that SCIRE's work
on transfer needs should be limited
and short-term.
"My emphasis," she said, "has been
on providing the students with their
own organization so that SCIRE won't
have to play a role."

out, advocated the policy of automatic
on-campus placement later adopted in
the Housing Office's proposal for a
new draw system. Although this may
represent an ultimate solution for the

the new draw may not be operative
until 1976 at the earliest and other
programs are needed in the interim.
Transfer Edition
To fill the immediate need, Supton
said, the SCIRE task force is writing a
special version of Approaching
Stanford (currently mailed to newly
admitted freshmen) for transfers.
Supton also reported the fall
quarter orientation's emphasis on
housing and a winter quarter revival of
the "buddy" system. Tried once
before (in 1971), this idea calls for
returning students to act as on-call
sources of information and assistance
for incoming transfers.
Moving beyond the housing
problem, the SCIRE task force has
made a considerable contribution to
the transfers' social and academic
integration into the Stanford
environment, Supton said. She noted
the transfer student party organized
with the help of ASSU Special Events,
the sherry hours with faculty, and the
orientation sessions with personnel
from the Dean of Student Affairs
Office.
On the drawing board for next year
is an on-campus lounge for off-campus
students, a home base which would
feature its own facilities, social
schedule, and resident assistant.
On the academic front, Supton
outlined plans for an "Advising Fair,"
tentatively slated for the patio behind
Bowman Alumni House, which would
allow transfers to meet faculty,
personnel from the Academic
Information Center and Career.
Planning and Placement Center, and
other returning students interested in

preparing them for registration and
course work.
Uncertain Future
The questions surrounding SCIRE's
continued existence beyond June have
cast a certain amount of doubt upon
the continuation of the new transfer
progiams. Both Supton and Murray
have discussed possible increases in
commitments from other agencies.
Murray suggested that a portion of
the freshman orientation budget might
be shifted to the transfers, but
stressed that no decision had been
made. ASSU President Mike Herman
commented that "one would hope
that a future Council of Presidents
would consider a commitment to all
incoming students' orientation," but
noted that no promise could be made
for them.
The orientation program this fall
produced a Transfer Student Society
which hopes to work with SCIRE. The
society's treasurer, Liane Collins, said
her group will be working on "setting
up the lounge and the kinds of things
that people in dorms have." Collins
said she could not speculate on the
society's exact role, should the SCIRE
program be discontinued.
Supton stressed that SCIRE's work
on transfer needs should be limited
and short-term.
"My emphasis," she said, "has been
on providing the students with their
own organization so that SCIRE won't
have to play a role."

The list of problems facing
undergraduates who transfer here after
one or more years at another college
has become a familiar litany of
complaints. In an effort to meet these
needs of transfer students, SCIRE
Director Alice Supton established a
task force, in operation for the past
year, combining student, faculty and
administration resources.
Karen Murray, assistant to the dean
of student affairs for residential
education, has called SCIRE's transfer
orientation the first "coherent
program" of its kind here.

Murray estimated that "99 percent
of the transfer's problems" stem from
the shortage of housing. Since
transfers are only assigned spaces left
available after all incoming freshmen
have been given assignments, the great
majority must find accommodations in
the community at-large. Murray also
pointed out that this isolation leads to
social and academic problems.
The SCIRE task force thus
concentrated their first efforts on a
position paper which, Supton pointed
out, advocated the policy of automatic
on-campus placement later adopted in
