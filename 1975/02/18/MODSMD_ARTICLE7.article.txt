The California State Senate's Judiciary Committee last
week approved legislation sponsored by State Sen. George
Moscone (D-S.F.) to reduce penalties for possession of
marijuana.
We approve of this legislation, SB-95, and urge our
representatives in the Senate and Assembly to support it.
The legislation reduces the crime of unlawful possession
of "three or less avoir-dupois ounces of marijuana" (up to
$30-60 worth) to a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine cf
not more than $100. At the present time, possession of any
amount of marijuana may be prosecuted as a felony.
The bill also deletes two related "offenses" — possession
of any paraphernalia unlawfully used to smoke marijuana
and being present in a place with the knowledge that
marijuana is being smoked — as criminal offenses.
We do not believe that possession of marijuana should be
any sort of offense at all. Marijuana has not been proven as
dangerous as legal drugs such as alcohol, and even if it were,
we wonder about the state's right to enforce laws as
arbitrarily as it does the marijuana law.
These arguments are in addition to those of Moscone,
which stress the waste of millions of dollars for enforcement
of marijuana laws against those who commit victimless
crimes while many dangerous criminals remain
unapprehended.
We do not think Moscone's bill goes far enough. But it's
better than nothing, and, considering the political climate,
it's about all that can be hoped for.
