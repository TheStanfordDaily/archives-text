# Overseas Study

Recent administrative reforms
in the Overseas Studies Program
suggest the need for a
reevaluation of the goals in a
Stanford liberal arts education. As
the three-week break between
academic quarters is cut to one
week and an emphasis is placed on
the number of hours spent in a
traditional classroom
environment, the overseas
program becomes more
specialized.
As the centers multiply in
number but shrink in size, their
ability to offer a broad range of
courses is limited and their
capacity to attract a large
percentage of the student body
suffers in consequence. The idea
that students can learn about a
foreign culture in a rural
community has been replaced by
an insistence that only at a major
university can knowledge be
properly imparted.
As these pressures for academic
rigor increase, the Stanford
programs begin to migrate into
the great modern cities, and the
outlook for Tours and the
Remstal site becomes grim. As
one former Beutelsbach student
sadly noted, "They have decided
that learning from peasants isn't
up to Stanford's academic
standards."
Meanwhile, at the home
campus, SWOPSI. SCIRE, and the
Humanities Special Program are
faced with pressures for

curtailment or elimination.
Altogether, innovative education
seems to be taking some serious
blows. What is suffering is the idea
of a liberal arts education, that
now rather outdated notion that
every undergraduate ought to
have a general background in a
number of areas of study.
The narrowing or cutting back
in general interdisciplinary
programs merely serves to
accelerate the trend toward
specialization which has already
so compartmentalized our society
that only a few are still able to
comprehend it as a whole. The
pre-professional orientation of
undergraduate study at Stanford
intensifies to increasingly exclude
this type of thinking, and now,
the overseas campuses begin to
limit the variety of their
experience.
In the past, Stanford in Europe
has offered a unique combination
of general academics and travel,
and although there may be good
reason for intensifying the former,
it seems a grave mistake to restrict
the latter to the extent that recent
administrative policy has done. If
the overseas programs become too
academically specialized, they will
become practical for only a few.
If this trend continues, a great
part of Stanford's liberal arts
education will be lost.
