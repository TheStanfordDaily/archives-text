# Support Limited Viet Aid
## William MacDougall 
### 
The Ford Administration has
requested an additional $300
million in aid for South Vietnam.
Unfortunately, it is likely that
Congress will fail to pass the aid
bill.
It should be emphasized that
President Ford is not calling for —
and is not likely to call for —
direct American involvement.
Like Israel, South Vietnam is not
asking that we fight their war for
them, merely that we supply the
equipment they need to fight for
themselves.
Emily Leavitt et al. in their
article (Daily, Jan. 27) implied
that previous aid to South
Vietnam and the current proposal
are in violation of the Paris
Agreement. This is simply not the
case; Article 7 of the Agreement
allows for replacement of
damaged or destroyed equipment.
That is all our aid has done and all
this proposal will do.
However, the question of the
Agreement is mute. Under
international law, a treaty once
violated by one party is no longer
binding on other parties. North
Vietnam has violated the
Agreement since its inception. In
violation of Article 20A, she has
maintained troops in Cambodia.
In violation of Article 7, she has
infiltrated new weapons and over
60,000 new troops into South
Vietnam.
The Communists refused to
cooperate with the International
Control Commission established
by the Agreement. South Vietnam

offered on at least three occasions
to hold internationally supervised
elections pursuant to the
Agreement; each time her offer
was rejected. Because of these
violations, the Administration is
correct in renouncing any further
obligation under the Paris Peace
Agreement.
Of course, South Vietnam has
also violated the Agreement on
occasion. But in the light of North
Vietnam's intervention in
Cambodia, her recent offensive,
and her reinforcement of troops
in South Vietnam, I believe that
North Vietnam's violations have
been more substantial. In any case
we must look at the current
situation. The Agreement is now a
farce and to a large extent was
from the beginning. Its main
purpose was to allow U.S. troops
to withdraw in an orderly and
face-saving manner.
Oppression Exaggerated
Opponents of further aid
frequently exaggerate the
supposed "oppressiveness" of the
Thieu government. Thieu has
carried out a very extensive and
successful land reform program;
over 90 percent of the tenant
farmers have been given the land
they till. This is in marked
contrast to the North in which
over 80 percent of the land is
owned by the state.
Admittedly there are political
prisoners and censorship in South
Vietnam. Though this should be
criticized it is partially
understandable since South

Vietnam is in the midst of a
terrible war. After all, President
Lincoln greatly restricted civil
liberties during our civil war.
However, the opponents of aid
often overstate their case. In
Saigon, there are 15
Vietnamese-language newspapers,
only three of which are strongly
pro-Thieu. Though the more
odious (to Thieu) articles are
censored, there is — unlike in
North Vietnam — daily tolerated
criticism.
There have recently been large
demonstrations in South Vietnam
(none are permitted in the North).
However these demonstrations
have been against the excesses of
the government, not against the
basic war effort.
I believe one should make a
distinction between those
governments which are
totalitarian and those which are
merely authoritarian. The Thieu
Government does have many
authoritarian aspects, but its rule
is not nearly so total as a
communist rule would be.
The Ford Administration is not
asking for — and I would oppose
— many billions of dollars per
year of aid or direct American
involvement. The President is
asking for a relatively minor
expenditure that will help a
potentially democratic country
defend itself against permanent
totalitarianism.

Agreement is mute. Under
international law, a treaty once
violated by one party is no longer
binding on other parties. North
Vietnam has violated the
Agreement since its inception. In
violation of Article 20A, she has
maintained troops in Cambodia.
In violation of Article 7, she has
infiltrated new weapons and over
60,000 new troops into South
Vietnam.
The Communists refused to
cooperate with the International
Control Commission established
by the Agreement. South Vietnam

offered on at least three occasions
to hold internationally supervised
elections pursuant to the
Agreement; each time her offer
was rejected. Because of these
violations, the Administration is
correct in renouncing any further
obligation under the Paris Peace
Agreement.
Of course, South Vietnam has
also violated the Agreement on
occasion. But in the light of North
Vietnam's intervention in
Cambodia, her recent offensive,
and her reinforcement of troops
in South Vietnam, I believe that
North Vietnam's violations have
been more substantial. In any case
we must look at the current
situation. The Agreement is now a
farce and to a large extent was
from the beginning. Its main
purpose was to allow U.S. troops
to withdraw in an orderly and
face-saving manner.
Oppression Exaggerated
Opponents of further aid
frequently exaggerate the
supposed "oppressiveness" of the
Thieu government. Thieu has
carried out a very extensive and
successful land reform program;
over 90 percent of the tenant
farmers have been given the land
they till. This is in marked
contrast to the North in which
over 80 percent of the land is
owned by the state.
Admittedly there are political
prisoners and censorship in South
Vietnam. Though this should be
criticized it is partially
understandable since South

Vietnam is in the midst of a
terrible war. After all, President
Lincoln greatly restricted civil
liberties during our civil war.
However, the opponents of aid
often overstate their case. In
Saigon, there are 15
Vietnamese-language newspapers,
only three of which are strongly
pro-Thieu. Though the more
odious (to Thieu) articles are
censored, there is — unlike in
North Vietnam — daily tolerated
criticism.
There have recently been large
demonstrations in South Vietnam
(none are permitted in the North).
However these demonstrations
have been against the excesses of
the government, not against the
basic war effort.
I believe one should make a
distinction between those
governments which are
totalitarian and those which are
merely authoritarian. The Thieu
Government does have many
authoritarian aspects, but its rule
is not nearly so total as a
communist rule would be.
The Ford Administration is not
asking for — and I would oppose
— many billions of dollars per
year of aid or direct American
involvement. The President is
asking for a relatively minor
expenditure that will help a
potentially democratic country
defend itself against permanent
totalitarianism.
(William MacDougall is a junior
majoring in history and
economics.)
The Ford Administration has
requested an additional $300
million in aid for South Vietnam.
Unfortunately, it is likely that
Congress will fail to pass the aid
bill.
It should be emphasized that
President Ford is not calling for —
and is not likely to call for —
direct American involvement.
Like Israel, South Vietnam is not
asking that we fight their war for
them, merely that we supply the
equipment they need to fight for
themselves.
Emily Leavitt et al. in their
article (Daily, Jan. 27) implied
that previous aid to South
Vietnam and the current proposal
are in violation of the Paris
Agreement. This is simply not the
case; Article 7 of the Agreement
allows for replacement of
damaged or destroyed equipment.
That is all our aid has done and all
this proposal will do.
