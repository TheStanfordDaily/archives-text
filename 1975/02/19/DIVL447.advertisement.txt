STUDU IN SPAIN at tlx
university or Salamanca
This program is designed for majors in Spanish or for
students who are specializing in some area of Spanish
history, political theory, art, or allied fields, but who have
had sufficient training in Spanish to derive benefit from
classes given entirely in Spanish. The program emphasizes a
total immersion into Spanish culture, with excursions
covering the major areas of Spain. Here students are
allowed to view and study Spanish architecture, art and city
life.
The center itself is located in Salamanca, where
students will take five courses related to their interests,
including one on Spanish Sty I istics. History of the Spanish
Language, a general survey of some period of Spanish
Literature, with the remainder chosen from the course
offerings of the University of Salamanca.
Salamanca is a small, typical university town,
analogous to Palo Alto, where students live with native
Spaniards and absorb, during the six-month period, the
culture and an understanding of a people away from the
main stream of American tourism. Professor Phillip
Petersen will direct this year's program, the eighth in series.
This will be Prof. Petersen's third directorship of this
program and he brings to it the considerable experience and
successes of his previous programs.
Deadline for applications to the Program will be
March 7.
