# Trustees' Expenses Defended

### RICHARD FEARON 
A Feb. 10 Board of Trustees
meeting in Los Angeles did not incur
unnecessary expenditures of scarce
funds, according to a University
administrator.
Executive Assistant to the Provost
Edward Shaw claimed there were
justifications for the extra expenses
incurred for the out-of-town meeting.
"It was more than normal, but not
in my judgment inappropriate given
the benefits," he stated. "The return
will be much greater than if we had
not held the meeting."
Shaw claimed that the trustees
annual Los Angeles meeting provided
an excellent opportunity for
University fundraising. It enabled
trustees and officials of the University
x> attend fundraising events and meet
with individuals interested in
contributing money, he said.
The meeting also provided a chance
for trustees to obtain a better gauge of
alumni opinion on pertinent issues,
Shaw stated.
Southern California has the second
largest concentration of Stanford
alumni, Shaw noted. The Los Angeles
area provides the University with a
large sum of donations i *.ch year.
"It [the annual LA trustees'
meeting] gives us a chance to
concentrate on potential donations,
without which the cost of tuition
would be much higher," Shaw stated.
"An awful lot of fundraising dinners
are hosted by alumni."
Efforts were made to reduce
expenditures for this trip, he said. The
number of staff members attending
the meeting was greatly reduced from
previous years. Only two deans made
the trip.
"[President Richard) Lyman was
very sensitive about this journey," said
Shaw. "Because of the budget
constraints, the number of staff other
than the president and vice presidents
was cut at least in half, if not more.
Each of the vice presidents may have
taken one member of their special
staff, but no more.
"It certainly cost more than normal
meetings because we did have to house
the staff in LA," noted Shaw. "This
probably was the only other
incremental cost."
No cost figures for the trip have
been received and they may not be
available for another month. Shaw
emphasized that "costs were heid to
an absolute minimum."
The staff that did attend the
meeting also was able to accomplish
other things, Shaw said. Personally, he
met with a foundation to discuss the
details of a donation it had made.
While in Los Angeles, the entourage
lodged at the Century Plaza hotel.
"That's where the Board meeting is
held each year," Shaw said, "and it's
sort of the epicenter of the area's
alumni."
The schedule for the Los Angeles
meeting provided for a formal meeting
on Monday, allowing the participants
to attend fundraising affairs from
Sunday through Tuesday. Shaw
estimated that 10 to 30 dinners were
given for this purpose, each attended
by a couple of officials.
Stanford's 34 trustees meet once a
month, except during January, July
and August. Two of the nine meetings
are held on campus, six in San
Francisco and one in Los Angeles.
