# Investment Curbs Are Self-Defeating
## 
### William Ross 
One of the surest signs that the
United States is entering a severe
economic recession — if not a
depression — is the growth of
support for economic
provincialism.
The scramble to protect
American interests at the expense
of other nations is both a cause
and effect of the nation's
economic downturn. It is an
effect because recessions always
create an "every nation for itself"
mentality and it is an effect
because this attitude in turn
aggravates economic decline.
The most recent manifestation
of this phenomenon is the
introduction in Congress by Sen.
Harrison Williams (D-N.J.),
chairman of the Senate Banking
Subcommittee on Securities, of a
bill that would permit the

President to prohibit foreign
investments amounting to more
than five percent of the stock of
American companies with assets
of more than $1 million.
Voters Are Scared
The bill is probably a response
to widespread fear by many
Americans that businessmen from
the oil exporting nations will use
their profits to buy controlling
interests in countless United
States companies.
Someone — it doesn't matter
who — pointed out recently that
at their current rate of economic
expansion, the oil producing
countries of the Middle East could
buy out the New York Stock
Exchange in nine years.
This abstract nonsense has
frightened many people into
supporting a discouragement of
foreign investment at the very
time that investment — from any
source — is sorely needed in the
United States.
Public pressure may even
encourage congressmen to crank
out a spate of anti-foreign
investment legislation to show
their constituents during the next
election campaign.
Historical Ignorance
Americans have never been
inclined to learn from their
history—witness American military
participation in Vietnam after the
Korean debacle. So perhaps it is
too much to ask that they recall
the disastrous results during the
Great Depression of attempts to
protect American economic
interests at the expense of other
nations.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff of
1930, for example, failed to
protect American goods from
foreign competition but helped to
dry up the market for American
goous abroad.

The Williams bill could
backfire in the same way. Other
nations would be likely to pass
similar measures discriminating
against U.S. investments abroad,
which currently amount to $120
billion.
U.S. Disadvantage
Considering the recent growth
of American-based multinational
corporations, it is likely that
discouragement of foreign
investment would disadvantage
the United States more than other
nations — even those of the
Middle East — since foreign
investment in the U.S. is currently
only $20 billion.
Some supporters of the
Williams bill argue that it would
give the president only

discretionary powers; it would not
force him to bar any foreign
investment, they point out.
But the popular fear of
investment in American industry
by the potentates of the Middle
East might encourage the President
to acquiesce to public opinion by
blocking such investment.
Likewise, American
businessmen, resenting foreign
intervention in the U.S. economy,
might also encourage the
president to exercise his new
power.
Defense Investment
Proponents of the Williams
measure and bill and similar
measures like to warn of the
dangers posed by foreign —
meaning in this case Arab —
investments in industries vital to
American defense.
Many safeguards, however,
already exist to protect the abuse
of foreign ownership of
defense-related industries.
Already, for example, the
Defense Department can refuse
security clearance to producers
under foreign control.
Furthermore, the Trading With
the Enemy Act gives the president
power to force foreign-dominated
companies to produce defense
equipment during times of
national emergency.
Fears of foreign takeovers of
American industries are greatly
exaggerated, as is anxiety about
such investment endangering
American defense. Rather than
discouraging foreign investment,
Congress should encourage it in
order to help lift the nation from
the doldrums of its recession.

investments in industries vital to
American defense.
Many safeguards, however,
already exist to protect the abuse
of foreign ownership of
defense-related industries.
Already, for example, the
Defense Department can refuse
security clearance to producers
under foreign control.
Furthermore, the Trading With
the Enemy Act gives the president
power to force foreign-dominated
companies to produce defense
equipment during times of
national emergency.
Fears of foreign takeovers of
American industries are greatly
exaggerated, as is anxiety about
such investment endangering
American defense. Rather than
discouraging foreign investment,
Congress should encourage it in

the doldrums of its recession.

One of the surest signs that the
United States is entering a severe
economic recession — if not a
depression — is the growth of
support for economic
provincialism.
The scramble to protect
American interests at the expense
of other nations is both a cause
and effect of the nation's
economic downturn. It is an
effect because recessions always
create an "every nation for itself"
mentality and it is an effect
because this attitude in turn
aggravates economic decline.
The most recent manifestation
of this phenomenon is the
introduction in Congress by Sen.
Harrison Williams (D-N.J.),
chairman of the Senate Banking
Subcommittee on Securities, of a
bill that would permit the

President to prohibit foreign
investments amounting to more
than five percent of the stock of
American companies with assets
of more than $1 million.
Voters Are Scared
The bill is probably a response
to widespread fear by many
Americans that businessmen from
the oil exporting nations will use
their profits to buy controlling
interests in countless United
States companies.
Someone — it doesn't matter
who — pointed out recently that
at their current rate of economic
expansion, the oil producing
countries of the Middle East could
buy out the New York Stock
Exchange in nine years.
This abstract nonsense has
frightened many people into
supporting a discouragement of
foreign investment at the very
time that investment — from any
source — is sorely needed in the
United States.
Public pressure may even
encourage congressmen to crank
out a spate of anti-foreign
investment legislation to show
their constituents during the next
election campaign.
Historical Ignorance
Americans have never been
inclined to learn from their
history—witness American military
participation in Vietnam after the
Korean debacle. So perhaps it is
too much to ask that they recall
the disastrous results during the
Great Depression of attempts to
protect American economic
interests at the expense of other
nations.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff of
1930, for example, failed to
protect American goods from
foreign competition but helped to
dry up the market for American
goous abroad.

The Williams bill could
backfire in the same way. Other
nations would be likely to pass
similar measures discriminating
against U.S. investments abroad,
which currently amount to $120
billion.
U.S. Disadvantage
Considering the recent growth
of American-based multinational
corporations, it is likely that
discouragement of foreign
investment would disadvantage
the United States more than other
nations — even those of the
Middle East — since foreign
investment in the U.S. is currently
only $20 billion.
Some supporters of the
Williams bill argue that it would
give the president only

discretionary powers; it would not
force him to bar any foreign
investment, they point out.
But the popular fear of
investment in American industry
by the potentates of the Middle
East might encourage the President
to acquiesce to public opinion by
blocking such investment.
Likewise, American
businessmen, resenting foreign
intervention in the U.S. economy,
might also encourage the
president to exercise his new
power.
Defense Investment
Proponents of the Williams
measure and bill and similar
measures like to warn of the
dangers posed by foreign —
meaning in this case Arab —
investments in industries vital to
American defense.
Many safeguards, however,
already exist to protect the abuse
of foreign ownership of
defense-related industries.
Already, for example, the
Defense Department can refuse
