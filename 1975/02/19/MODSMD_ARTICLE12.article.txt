# Whites Need Aid
## 
### 
Ricardo Reyna's opinion
(Daily, Feb. 5) concerning
minority students and the
proposed change in financial aid
policy ignores a side of the issue
of which many people are not
aware.
He claims that "a one-year
period in which a chicano can
adjust is essential." Aside from

Greg Beattie

the fact that he gives no evidence
to support this claim, he fails to
take into consideration that white
freshmen, who are not exempt
from the self-help requirement as
it stands now, may also have
trouble adjusting.
It is unfair to allow an
economic advantage to all
minority students, whether they
need it or not, and to deny it to
the low-income white students,
many of whom may have just as
much trouble adjusting to the
predominantly upper-class
atmosphere at Stanford.
Reyna claims that the new
proposal "ignores the necessary
adjustments stemming from
cultural differences." But to the
low-income whites whose
backgrounds are such that they
are jolted by the cultural shift
upon arriving at Stanford, the
present policy not only fails to
consider the "necessary
adjustments stemming from
cultural differences," but also
discriminates against them,
favoring minority students.
The obvious and most
satisfactory solution to the
problem is not to maintain the
present policy, or to adopt the
proposed one, but to make all
freshmen, regardless of race,
exempt from the self-help
requirement.
But short of this (and with the
economic situation what it is at
Stanford, we can be fairly sure the
administration will fall short of
our expectations) the most just
alternative is the proposed change,
according to which all freshme i
receiving aid must meet tu
requirement. After all, ->v>
students who need the ti j
adjust can secure loans insi ol
jobs. It is simply unf? uit
certain students are fret J from
the task of raising a considerable
sum of money purely on the basis
of skin color or national origin,
while others, who may have just
as much trouble coping with the
new environment, are bound to
fulfill the requirement.
