# More About Memo

James Gibbs

The assumptions underlying
the personal views which I
expressed in my memorandum of
Nov. 14, which the Daily printed
Feb. 13, are well known to most
of the persons to whom the
memorandum was addressed.
Therefore, I did not include them,
but without them the memo
easily is misconstrued. During the
past eight years I have stated these
assumptions many times, but let
me state them again.
1 believe that most minority
students will, and should, use
their Stanford undergraduate
education to prepare for positions
of leadership in our society where,
among other things, they will
work to eliminate racism from our
social institutions.
The best preparation during
the undergraduate years for
assuming such positions is to
participate very broadly in the
undergraduate life of Stanford.
This includes broad involvement
with the curriculum and broad
participation in the
extra-curricular activities.
I also believe that minority
group members can be most
effective in later life if, during the
college years, they put their
primary emphasis on utilizing the
system to prepare for future roles
rather than placing their main
emphasis on overhauling it.
Criticism of the University is
beneficial and, often, is justified.
But, in my view, minority
students who spend too much of
their time reacting to racism do
not have enough energy to
channel into their studies and to
promote most effectively their
intellectual development, which is
crucial for future leadership.
In brief, too much emphasis on
day-to-day involvement in
changing Stanford or reacting
negatively may impair a minority
student's ability adequately to
prepare him or her to deal with
the power structure from a
position of strength, rooted in the
best training our society can
provide.
Obviously, the prospect of a
minority student's adhering to
this particular scenario should not
and cannot be a factor in his or
her admission. Nor would it be a
factor in the granting of financial
aid. That would be improper.
But just as admissions and
financial aid policies should not
be weighted toward this particular
view of the purpose of education
neither should they be biased
knowingly against it.
This should make my position
clear to your readers.
