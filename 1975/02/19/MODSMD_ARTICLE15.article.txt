# Roguish Bartenders Bring Touch O' Spice To Perry's

"You tike to fool around?"
asks the man in the black velvet
suit.
"No," she retorts.
"0.K.," he says defensively to
the girl with the short layered
hair. "I just like to get that out of
the way."
Pick-ups aren't uncommon at
the bar inside Perry's Restaurant
on Union Street. But Perry's is
more than a meat rack, especially
at lunchtime.
Jim Plunkett, John Tunney,
Peter Falk and Goldie Hawn have
all had a drink here. Today, Jack
Smith from the San Francisco
Chronicle and Phil Harris of

KRON-TV news are sitting on the
black leather stools.
Why do these people come to
Perry's? Enthusiasts claim Perry's
serves the best hamburgers,
roasted potato chips and onion
soup au gratin around, but
"regular" Terry McGovern, disc
jocky on KSAN, is not alone
when he says, "This is also the
best drinking bar in San
Francisco."
"Yau wanna know why?" asks
McGovem, sipping on his wine
cooler — half white wine, half
orange juice. " 'Cause in a bar
business you gotta have stars, you
gotta have performers, and the
key to the whole thing here is

these two dudes" — Michael
McCourt and Seamus Coyle — the
bartenders. The stars.
Stellar Performers
McCourt and Coyle are both
dressed in conservative,
diagonal-striped ties, white
button-down shirts and dark,
loose-fitting trousers. Their faces
are clean-shaven, and their hair is
cropped medium-short.
Except for short white aprons
they wear around their bellies,
reddened complexions that
suggest earlier days of romping
through wind-swept Irish moors,
and brogues as thick as ale, you'd
think they were regular
businessmen.
Ayyyyy, but they're not. Says
owner Perry Butler, "They were
both born in Ireland, and they're
full of it." They're the grand
masters of the insult and the
darlin's of the poker face.
A Kent cigarette dangles from
Coyle's lips. He slumps over. He is
about to mix a drink. This is the
one time of the day when he is
quiet.
A lady with shoulder-length
auburn hair interrupts his silence.
Quiet Time
"How are you today, Seamus?"
she asks.
"None o' your business," he
replies.
Suddenly a man shouts out
from behind, "Hey Seamus."
"Can't y' see I'm talkin' t'
someone. Goddam Yanks have no
manners."

Meanwhile, at the other end of
the long polished oak bar lined
with dollar bills, Perry's napkins
and water rings from perspiring
glasses, stands McCourt. The
phone rings. He answers. "Hello.
Perry's State Hospital."
At 11:30 a.m., San Franciscans
on their lunch hours swing
through the old English doors,
past the shining brass railings,
around the small round tables
covered with nearly pressed blue
and white checked tablecloths, to
a seat at the bar.
McCourt watches the amorous
encounter between the man and
the girl; he in a black velvet suit
with clashing brown platform
shoes, she with short layered hair.
He performs the proper
