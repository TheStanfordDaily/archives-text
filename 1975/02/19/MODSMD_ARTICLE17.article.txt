# Cruise S.F. For Booze And Views
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Although known around the world for its
restaurants, the variety, excellence and sheer number
of San Francisco's bars surpass any other city of
comparable size.
And that's what it all comes down to when having a
night on the town — bars and the booze served there.
In California, you must be 21 to be served, or at least
be able to prove it with a reasonable looking piece of
identification.
So before listing some of the most interesting bars
in San Francisco (a list which is totally subjective), be
forewarned. If you think there will be any possibility of
a question about your age, take identification.
Now for the information about the best boozeries.
Starting right at the top for sheer volume and
excellence of drinks, Trader Vic's, 20 Cosmo Place,
can't be topped. If you are going to pay from $2 to $5
for a cocktail, rummy or otherwise, go all the way and
get your money's worth. The decor is Polynesian,
dressing up is expected and reservations are a good
idea.
Even before the current inflationary recession, a
night at Trader Vic's always resulted in a sizable tab.
But after you have sampled a Samoan Fogcutter, a
Rum Keg, or a Suffering Bastard, you become more
sanguine about cost. Besides, what are you doing at
Trader Vic's if you're concerned about money?
Revolving Bar
Getting the more expensive places out of the way,
the Equinox Room at the top of the Hyatt Regency,
5 Embarcadero Center, is definitely in the top dollar
category.
Take a Towering Inferno elevator ride after looking
around the lobby, and then get a new thrill when you
discover that you're revolving. But it's not from
grossly overpriced and mediocre drinks; actually a
motor turns the room like a slow merry-go-round.

From $2.40 to $5 a drink, you are paying for the
view, so the best thing to do is sit for one complete
revolution and leave.
More static views of the City are provided from the
well-known but rather decrepit Top of the Mark
Hopkins, 1 Nob Hill, or from the Sir Francis Drake.
Drinks are not inexpensive, but both watering
holes should be included on any more traditional tour
of San Francisco.
San Francisco Tradition
Speaking of traditions, what could be more San
Franciscan than Irish coffee, which was invented in the
City?
Synonymous with Irish coffee is the Buena Vista,
2765 Hyde St., close to the touristy parts of
Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square. However,
few tourists know food is also available, and
inexpensively at that, with filling dinners in the $3 to
$4 range. Add a few 75-cent Irish coffees, and you're
ready to elbow your way through the crowd around
the bar and get back on the street.
For those who find the Irish atmosphere at the
Buena Vista phony, there's the Abbey Tavern, 4100
Geary Blvd., that many believe has the best Irish
coffee in town.
Bohemian Establishment
Vesuvio's Cafe, at 257 Columbus Ave., is a place
where the drinks are relatively inexpensive (Irish
coffee is still 75 cents). It lures the Bohemian and
literary establishment who enjoy not being subjected
to tourist scrutiny.
Carefully drive over Highway 1 and just where it
begins (or ends), at 1090 Point Lobos Ave., is the Cliff
House. The downstairs bar has a fireplace and
excellent view of the Pacific Ocean if you get a seat by
one of the large windows. Drinks are average in price.
Watch the waves break on Seal Rock and if you don't
actually see a seal, you'll probably hear one.

So much for the more traditional aspects of San
Francisco bardom. Two places to hit if you want to
see how a different segment of San Francisco
entertains itself are Peg's Place, 4737 Geary Blvd., and
Cabaret, 936 Montgomery St.
Actually, Cabaret isn't so much a drinking as a
dancing spot. It's also a center for gays to socialize and
tourists to gawk at things they can't see back in
Kokomo. The drinks aren't overpriced, but there is
usually a cover charge at the door.
Peg's Place is a more sedate location for gay women
to socialize. Straight men are not expected to frequent
the premises, which feature unprepossessing decor, a
fake gas-fed fireplace, pool and a Pong machine.
Jamaican Beat
Moving right along, a less well known place than
Cabaret but a dancing spot on Saturdays which is
every bit as classy, is Margo's Lake Merced Lounge,
4075 19th Ave., where Mongo Reggae spins the latest
Jamaican platters. During the rest of the week it's a
warm, mellow bar with fireplace, frequented by
Jamaicans and others whose reggae knowledge didn't
begin with The Harder They Come.
Now a word about fern bars. For those who haven't
heard, a fem bar is filled with ferns, comfortable
antique-type furniture and other assorted plants and
bric-brac.
Add a few people, price drinks somewhere around
95 cents and you have either Henry Africa's, 2260 Van
Ness, or Lord Jim's, 1500 Broadway St.
Then, there's the businessmen's bar scene, like
Breen's at 71 3rd St., which gives a faint reminder of
the days when ladies weren't seen in bars and drinking
was something a man did.
The list could be endless. So if you didn't like this
all-too-brief list of bars, put some money and
identification in your pocket and go out and research
on your own.

Kokomo. The drinks aren't overpriced, but there is
usually a cover charge at the door.
Peg's Place is a more sedate location for gay women
to socialize. Straight men are not expected to frequent
the premises, which feature unprepossessing decor, a
fake gas-fed fireplace, pool and a Pong machine.
Jamaican Beat
Moving right along, a less well known place than
Cabaret but a dancing spot on Saturdays which is
every bit as classy, is Margo's Lake Merced Lounge,
4075 19th Ave., where Mongo Reggae spins the latest
Jamaican platters. During the rest of the week it's a
warm, mellow bar with fireplace, frequented by
Jamaicans and others whose reggae knowledge didn't
begin with The Harder They Come.
Now a word about fern bars. For those who haven't
heard, a fem bar is filled with ferns, comfortable
antique-type furniture and other assorted plants and
bric-brac.
Add a few people, price drinks somewhere around
95 cents and you have either Henry Africa's, 2260 Van
Ness, or Lord Jim's, 1500 Broadway St.
Then, there's the businessmen's bar scene, like
Breen's at 71 3rd St., which gives a faint reminder of
the days when ladies weren't seen in bars and drinking
was something a man did.
The list could be endless. So if you didn't like this
all-too-brief list of bars, put some money and
identification in your pocket and go out and research
on your own.
Although known around the world for its
restaurants, the variety, excellence and sheer number
of San Francisco's bars surpass any other city of
comparable size.
And that's what it all comes down to when having a
night on the town — bars and the booze served there.
In California, you must be 21 to be served, or at least
be able to prove it with a reasonable looking piece of
identification.
So before listing some of the most interesting bars
in San Francisco (a list which is totally subjective), be
forewarned. If you think there will be any possibility of
a question about your age, take identification.
Now for the information about the best boozeries.
Starting right at the top for sheer volume and
excellence of drinks, Trader Vic's, 20 Cosmo Place,
can't be topped. If you are going to pay from $2 to $5
for a cocktail, rummy or otherwise, go all the way and
get your money's worth. The decor is Polynesian,
dressing up is expected and reservations are a good
idea.
Even before the current inflationary recession, a
night at Trader Vic's always resulted in a sizable tab.
But after you have sampled a Samoan Fogcutter, a
Rum Keg, or a Suffering Bastard, you become more
sanguine about cost. Besides, what are you doing at
Trader Vic's if you're concerned about money?
Revolving Bar
Getting the more expensive places out of the way,
the Equinox Room at the top of the Hyatt Regency,
5 Embarcadero Center, is definitely in the top dollar
category.
Take a Towering Inferno elevator ride after looking
around the lobby, and then get a new thrill when you
discover that you're revolving. But it's not from
grossly overpriced and mediocre drinks; actually a
motor turns the room like a slow merry-go-round.

From $2.40 to $5 a drink, you are paying for the
view, so the best thing to do is sit for one complete
revolution and leave.
More static views of the City are provided from the
well-known but rather decrepit Top of the Mark
Hopkins, 1 Nob Hill, or from the Sir Francis Drake.
Drinks are not inexpensive, but both watering
holes should be included on any more traditional tour
of San Francisco.
San Francisco Tradition
Speaking of traditions, what could be more San
Franciscan than Irish coffee, which was invented in the
City?
Synonymous with Irish coffee is the Buena Vista,
2765 Hyde St., close to the touristy parts of
Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square. However,
few tourists know food is also available, and
inexpensively at that, with filling dinners in the $3 to
$4 range. Add a few 75-cent Irish coffees, and you're
ready to elbow your way through the crowd around
the bar and get back on the street.
For those who find the Irish atmosphere at the
Buena Vista phony, there's the Abbey Tavern, 4100
Geary Blvd., that many believe has the best Irish
coffee in town.
Bohemian Establishment
Vesuvio's Cafe, at 257 Columbus Ave., is a place
where the drinks are relatively inexpensive (Irish
coffee is still 75 cents). It lures the Bohemian and
literary establishment who enjoy not being subjected
to tourist scrutiny.
Carefully drive over Highway 1 and just where it
begins (or ends), at 1090 Point Lobos Ave., is the Cliff
House. The downstairs bar has a fireplace and
excellent view of the Pacific Ocean if you get a seat by
one of the large windows. Drinks are average in price.
Watch the waves break on Seal Rock and if you don't
actually see a seal, you'll probably hear one.

So much for the more traditional aspects of San
Francisco bardom. Two places to hit if you want to
see how a different segment of San Francisco
entertains itself are Peg's Place, 4737 Geary Blvd., and
Cabaret, 936 Montgomery St.
Actually, Cabaret isn't so much a drinking as a
dancing spot. It's also a center for gays to socialize and
tourists to gawk at things they can't see back in
Kokomo. The drinks aren't overpriced, but there is
usually a cover charge at the door.

inexpensively at that, with filling dinners in the $3 to
$4 range. Add a few 75-cent Irish coffees, and you're
ready to elbow your way through the crowd around
the bar and get back on the street.
For those who find the Irish atmosphere at the
Buena Vista phony, there's the Abbey Tavern, 4100
Geary Blvd., that many believe has the best Irish
coffee in town.
Bohemian Establishment
Vesuvio's Cafe, at 257 Columbus Ave., is a place
where the drinks are relatively inexpensive (Irish
coffee is still 75 cents). It lures the Bohemian and
literary establishment who enjoy not being subjected
to tourist scrutiny.
Carefully drive over Highway 1 and just where it
begins (or ends), at 1090 Point Lobos Ave., is the Cliff
House. The downstairs bar has a fireplace and
excellent view of the Pacific Ocean if you get a seat by
one of the large windows. Drinks are average in price.
Watch the waves break on Seal Rock and if you don't
actually see a seal, you'll probably hear one.

So much for the more traditional aspects of San
Francisco bardom. Two places to hit if you want to
see how a different segment of San Francisco
entertains itself are Peg's Place, 4737 Geary Blvd., and
Cabaret, 936 Montgomery St.
Actually, Cabaret isn't so much a drinking as a
dancing spot. It's also a center for gays to socialize and
tourists to gawk at things they can't see back in
Kokomo. The drinks aren't overpriced, but there is
usually a cover charge at the door.
Peg's Place is a more sedate location for gay women
to socialize. Straight men are not expected to frequent
the premises, which feature unprepossessing decor, a
fake gas-fed fireplace, pool and a Pong machine.
Jamaican Beat
Moving right along, a less well known place than
Cabaret but a dancing spot on Saturdays which is
every bit as classy, is Margo's Lake Merced Lounge,
4075 19th Ave., where Mongo Reggae spins the latest
Jamaican platters. During the rest of the week it's a
warm, mellow bar with fireplace, frequented by
Jamaicans and others whose reggae knowledge didn't
begin with The Harder They Come.
Now a word about fern bars. For those who haven't
heard, a fem bar is filled with ferns, comfortable
antique-type furniture and other assorted plants and
bric-brac.
Add a few people, price drinks somewhere around
95 cents and you have either Henry Africa's, 2260 Van
Ness, or Lord Jim's, 1500 Broadway St.
Then, there's the businessmen's bar scene, like
Breen's at 71 3rd St., which gives a faint reminder of
the days when ladies weren't seen in bars and drinking
was something a man did.
The list could be endless. So if you didn't like this
all-too-brief list of bars, put some money and
identification in your pocket and go out and research
on your own.
Although known around the world for its
restaurants, the variety, excellence and sheer number
of San Francisco's bars surpass any other city of
comparable size.
And that's what it all comes down to when having a
night on the town — bars and the booze served there.
In California, you must be 21 to be served, or at least
be able to prove it with a reasonable looking piece of
identification.
So before listing some of the most interesting bars
in San Francisco (a list which is totally subjective), be
forewarned. If you think there will be any possibility of
a question about your age, take identification.
Now for the information about the best boozeries.
Starting right at the top for sheer volume and
excellence of drinks, Trader Vic's, 20 Cosmo Place,
can't be topped. If you are going to pay from $2 to $5
for a cocktail, rummy or otherwise, go all the way and
get your money's worth. The decor is Polynesian,
dressing up is expected and reservations are a good
idea.
Even before the current inflationary recession, a
night at Trader Vic's always resulted in a sizable tab.
But after you have sampled a Samoan Fogcutter, a
Rum Keg, or a Suffering Bastard, you become more
sanguine about cost. Besides, what are you doing at
Trader Vic's if you're concerned about money?
Revolving Bar
Getting the more expensive places out of the way,
the Equinox Room at the top of the Hyatt Regency,
5 Embarcadero Center, is definitely in the top dollar
category.
Take a Towering Inferno elevator ride after looking
around the lobby, and then get a new thrill when you
discover that you're revolving. But it's not from
grossly overpriced and mediocre drinks; actually a
motor turns the room like a slow merry-go-round.

From $2.40 to $5 a drink, you are paying for the
view, so the best thing to do is sit for one complete
revolution and leave.
More static views of the City are provided from the
well-known but rather decrepit Top of the Mark
Hopkins, 1 Nob Hill, or from the Sir Francis Drake.
Drinks are not inexpensive, but both watering
holes should be included on any more traditional tour
of San Francisco.
San Francisco Tradition
Speaking of traditions, what could be more San
Franciscan than Irish coffee, which was invented in the
City?
Synonymous with Irish coffee is the Buena Vista,
2765 Hyde St., close to the touristy parts of
Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square. However,
few tourists know food is also available, and
inexpensively at that, with filling dinners in the $3 to
$4 range. Add a few 75-cent Irish coffees, and you're
