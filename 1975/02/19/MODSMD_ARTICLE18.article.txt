# Chinese Persecuted For Efficient Work

### BILL EVERS 
could not be in the laundry
business in certain parts of the
San Francisco without being
vouched for by 12 taxpayers on
his block. Then the Board itself
had to approve the person.
Justice Field considered this
ordinance in Circuit Court. He
believed that the due process
clause guaranteed a constitutional
right to freely contract and do
business. He saw that regulation
of entry into the laundry business
was an abrogation of such
freedom.
He could not see how washing
clothes endangered the public
order, so he said the Board had no
right to regulate laundries per se
and threw out the law.
Constitution Bans Chinese
Meanwhile, California had a
new state constitution which
forbade private corporations from
hiring Chinese workers (these
clauses and the laws enforcing
them were later thrown out of the
courts on freedom of contract
grounds). The new constitution
also denied Chinese the right to
own or inherit land in California.
All this time, parades, rallies,
and demonstrations by the whites
against the Chinese dominated the
public life of San Francisco.
Several local newspapers rivaled
local politicians for leadership of
the anti-Chinese crusade.
In the face of public threats to
destroy Chinatown and massacre
the Chinese, wealthy Chinese
businessmen hired trained private
police, who were called
"specials."
These men have often been

depicted as thugs hired to protect
gambling and prostitution
activities. In fact, as historian
Alexander Saxton points out,
they were "to defend Chinatown
against intrusion from the
non-Chinese city surrounding it."
Chinese Exclusion Act
In 1882, the local -California
anti-Chinese movement achieved
national stature with the passage
by Congress of the Chinese
Exclusion Act. The only real
opponents on the national level of
this move were the old antislavery
Abolitionists (like William Lloyd
Garrison), who had a history of
opposition to racism and defense
of the rights of man.
Social Darwinists, adherents of
a newly influential view that
stressed the functional value of
individualism, also opposed the
new law.
In the wake of the exclusion
law, national labor organizations
began organizing in San Francisco.
By 1885, Samuel Gompers' old
union, the Cigar Makers, had

pressured many city cigar
manufacturers into firing all
skilled Chinese laborers. The
union, in return, guaranteed that
it would supply white
replacements.
In 1902, Gompers himself
co-authored an AFL pamphlet on
the necessity of Chinese
exclusion. In it, he argues that
"the superior whites had to
exclude the inferior Asiatics by
law, or if necessary, by force of
arms." He says,"The Yellow Man
found it natural to lie, cheat, and
murder and 99 out of every 100
Chinese are gamblers."
The pamphlet quotes with
approval a petition some San
Franciscans sent to Congress in
which they warned lawmakers to
beware of the offspring of
interracial unions between whites
and orientals because they have
proved "invariably degenerate."
In addition, Gompers raises the
spectre of Chinese opium fiends
and the possibility that opium use
would spread to white boys and
girls.
