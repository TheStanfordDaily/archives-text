# Chinese Persecuted For Efficient Work

### BILL EVERS 
could not be in the laundry
business in certain parts of the
San Francisco without being
vouched for by 12 taxpayers on
his block. Then the Board itself
had to approve the person.
Justice Field considered this
ordinance in Circuit Court. He
believed that the due process
clause guaranteed a constitutional
right to freely contract and do
business. He saw that regulation
of entry into the laundry business
was an abrogation of such
freedom.
He could not see how washing
clothes endangered the public
order, so he said the Board had no
right to regulate laundries per se
and threw out the law.
Constitution Bans Chinese
Meanwhile, California had a
new state constitution which
forbade private corporations from
hiring Chinese workers (these
clauses and the laws enforcing
them were later thrown out of the
courts on freedom of contract
grounds). The new constitution
also denied Chinese the right to
own or inherit land in California.
All this time, parades, rallies,
and demonstrations by the whites
against the Chinese dominated the
public life of San Francisco.
Several local newspapers rivaled
local politicians for leadership of
the anti-Chinese crusade.
In the face of public threats to
destroy Chinatown and massacre
the Chinese, wealthy Chinese
businessmen hired trained private
police, who were called
"specials."
These men have often been

depicted as thugs hired to protect
gambling and prostitution
activities. In fact, as historian
Alexander Saxton points out,
they were "to defend Chinatown
against intrusion from the
non-Chinese city surrounding it."
Chinese Exclusion Act
In 1882, the local -California
anti-Chinese movement achieved
national stature with the passage
by Congress of the Chinese
Exclusion Act. The only real
opponents on the national level of
this move were the old antislavery
Abolitionists (like William Lloyd
Garrison), who had a history of
opposition to racism and defense
of the rights of man.
Social Darwinists, adherents of
a newly influential view that
stressed the functional value of
individualism, also opposed the
new law.
In the wake of the exclusion
law, national labor organizations
began organizing in San Francisco.
By 1885, Samuel Gompers' old
union, the Cigar Makers, had

pressured many city cigar
manufacturers into firing all
skilled Chinese laborers. The
union, in return, guaranteed that
it would supply white
replacements.
In 1902, Gompers himself
co-authored an AFL pamphlet on
the necessity of Chinese
exclusion. In it, he argues that
"the superior whites had to
exclude the inferior Asiatics by
law, or if necessary, by force of
arms." He says,"The Yellow Man
found it natural to lie, cheat, and
murder and 99 out of every 100
Chinese are gamblers."
The pamphlet quotes with
approval a petition some San
Franciscans sent to Congress in
which they warned lawmakers to
beware of the offspring of
interracial unions between whites
and orientals because they have
proved "invariably degenerate."
In addition, Gompers raises the
spectre of Chinese opium fiends
and the possibility that opium use
would spread to white boys and
girls.
It was a time when politicians
spoke of the "moon-eyed
menace." In the late 19th
century, San Francisco
businessmen tried to destroy their
more efficient competitors by
mobilizing racial antagonism.
They stirred mobs to
physically damage the property of
competitors who employed
Chinese labor. They, along with
organized white labor, induced
the state legislature to pass a law
which said that products had to
carry stamps declaring the race of
the labor used in their production.
*

It was a time when organized
white labor was the mainstay of
anti-Chinese political activity in
San Francisco. The persecution
reached its height in the success of
the Workingmen's Party in the
City during the 1870s.
There had been large numbers
of Chinese in California since the
Gold Rush in the 1850s (a heavy
tax on alien miners was aimed
especially at them). Additional
Chinese later came into the state
to work on the building of Sen.
Leland Stanford's Central Pacific
Railroad.
In the 1870 sand early 1880s,
the Chinese constituted
one-fourth to one-fifth of
California's wage-earning
population. In San Francisco,
Chinese workers predominated in
pork butchering, vegetable and
fish peddling, laundering, and

domestic service.
In addition, the products of
Chinese working in large
manufacturing concerns in cigar
making, shoemaking, and tailoring
were undercutting the products of
smaller, less efficient firms
employing solely white labor.
In the face of competitive
pressure from the hard-working
Chinese immigrants, many whites
turned to the political process in
an effort to suppress the Chinese
through regulation of economic
activity and labor conditions.
They also prohibited further
Chinese immigration. Some
wanted to go so far as to expel all
Chinese from the U.S.
Democratic Party
Anti-Chinese agitation was the
ideological basis for the revival of
the Democratic Party in California
after the Civil War, a conflict

which left the Democrats a
minority in much of the North.
But in San Francisco, the
anticoolie clubs provided an
ongoing organizational base for
the party.
In the wake of summer
anti-Chinese demonstrations in
1870, the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors passed a so-called
cubic air ordinance aimed at
putting out of business boarding
houses in Chinatown.
Three years later, the Board
passed the famous "Queue
Ordinance" which ordered that
every male prisoner sentenced to
jail had to have his hair cut to
within one inch of his scalp. Thus
Chinese were deprived of their
pigtails.
Like Persecuting Jews
Later in 1879, U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Stephen J. Field,
who believed in protecting human
rights via the Constitution's due
process clause, described such a
queue ordinance as special
legislation directed against a class.
He likened it to persecuting Jews
by compelling all prisoners to eat
pork.
At the same time as the first
queue ordinance, the supervisors

placed a schedule of license fees
on laundries that was aimed at
Chinese establishments. The Board
also banned all theatrical
performances from 1 p.m. until 6
a.m. in order to stop late-night
Chinese theater.
In the same period, the state
legislature was induced to
stringently regulate the Chinese
custom of transportation of the
dead to China. The legislature also
voted a subsidy to the California
Labor and Employment Exchange
with the stipulation that it not be
used by orientals.
Generally all the municipal and
state ordinances directed against
the Chinese in this period were
worded in terms of typical welfare
state concern with health, safety,
and sanitation.
Increased Legislation
With the rise of the virulently
anti-Chinese Workingmen's Party
in San Francisco, the pace of
anti-Chinese legislation increased.
In 1880, an elaborate building code
was drafted regulating the
material to be used in and the
design of laundries.
In 1882, the Board passed an
ordinance providing that one
could not be in the laundry
business in certain parts of the
San Francisco without being
vouched for by 12 taxpayers on
his block. Then the Board itself
had to approve the person.

It was a time when organized
white labor was the mainstay of
anti-Chinese political activity in
San Francisco. The persecution
reached its height in the success of
the Workingmen's Party in the
City during the 1870s.
There had been large numbers
of Chinese in California since the
Gold Rush in the 1850s (a heavy
tax on alien miners was aimed
especially at them). Additional
Chinese later came into the state
to work on the building of Sen.
Leland Stanford's Central Pacific
Railroad.
In the 1870 sand early 1880s,
the Chinese constituted
one-fourth to one-fifth of
California's wage-earning
population. In San Francisco,
Chinese workers predominated in
pork butchering, vegetable and
fish peddling, laundering, and

domestic service.
In addition, the products of
Chinese working in large
manufacturing concerns in cigar
making, shoemaking, and tailoring
were undercutting the products of
smaller, less efficient firms
employing solely white labor.
In the face of competitive
pressure from the hard-working
Chinese immigrants, many whites
turned to the political process in
an effort to suppress the Chinese
through regulation of economic
activity and labor conditions.
They also prohibited further
Chinese immigration. Some
wanted to go so far as to expel all
Chinese from the U.S.
Democratic Party
Anti-Chinese agitation was the
ideological basis for the revival of
the Democratic Party in California
after the Civil War, a conflict

which left the Democrats a
minority in much of the North.
But in San Francisco, the
anticoolie clubs provided an
ongoing organizational base for
the party.
In the wake of summer
anti-Chinese demonstrations in
1870, the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors passed a so-called
cubic air ordinance aimed at
putting out of business boarding
houses in Chinatown.
Three years later, the Board
passed the famous "Queue
Ordinance" which ordered that
every male prisoner sentenced to
jail had to have his hair cut to
within one inch of his scalp. Thus
Chinese were deprived of their
pigtails.
Like Persecuting Jews
Later in 1879, U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Stephen J. Field,
who believed in protecting human
rights via the Constitution's due
process clause, described such a
queue ordinance as special
legislation directed against a class.
He likened it to persecuting Jews
by compelling all prisoners to eat
pork.
At the same time as the first
queue ordinance, the supervisors

placed a schedule of license fees
on laundries that was aimed at
Chinese establishments. The Board
also banned all theatrical
performances from 1 p.m. until 6
a.m. in order to stop late-night
Chinese theater.
In the same period, the state
legislature was induced to
stringently regulate the Chinese
custom of transportation of the
dead to China. The legislature also
voted a subsidy to the California
Labor and Employment Exchange
with the stipulation that it not be
used by orientals.
Generally all the municipal and
state ordinances directed against
the Chinese in this period were
worded in terms of typical welfare
state concern with health, safety,
and sanitation.
Increased Legislation
With the rise of the virulently
anti-Chinese Workingmen's Party
in San Francisco, the pace of
anti-Chinese legislation increased.
In 1880, an elaborate building code
was drafted regulating the
material to be used in and the
design of laundries.
In 1882, the Board passed an
ordinance providing that one
could not be in the laundry
business in certain parts of the
San Francisco without being
vouched for by 12 taxpayers on
his block. Then the Board itself
had to approve the person.
Justice Field considered this
ordinance in Circuit Court. He
believed that the due process
clause guaranteed a constitutional
right to freely contract and do
business. He saw that regulation
of entry into the laundry business
was an abrogation of such
freedom.
He could not see how washing
clothes endangered the public
order, so he said the Board had no
right to regulate laundries per se
and threw out the law.
Constitution Bans Chinese
Meanwhile, California had a
new state constitution which
forbade private corporations from
hiring Chinese workers (these
clauses and the laws enforcing
them were later thrown out of the
courts on freedom of contract
grounds). The new constitution
also denied Chinese the right to
own or inherit land in California.
All this time, parades, rallies,
and demonstrations by the whites
against the Chinese dominated the
public life of San Francisco.
Several local newspapers rivaled
local politicians for leadership of
the anti-Chinese crusade.
In the face of public threats to
destroy Chinatown and massacre
the Chinese, wealthy Chinese
businessmen hired trained private
police, who were called
"specials."
These men have often been

depicted as thugs hired to protect
gambling and prostitution
activities. In fact, as historian
Alexander Saxton points out,
they were "to defend Chinatown
against intrusion from the
non-Chinese city surrounding it."
Chinese Exclusion Act
In 1882, the local -California
anti-Chinese movement achieved
national stature with the passage
by Congress of the Chinese
Exclusion Act. The only real
opponents on the national level of
this move were the old antislavery
Abolitionists (like William Lloyd
Garrison), who had a history of
opposition to racism and defense
of the rights of man.
Social Darwinists, adherents of
a newly influential view that
stressed the functional value of
individualism, also opposed the
new law.
In the wake of the exclusion
law, national labor organizations
began organizing in San Francisco.
By 1885, Samuel Gompers' old
union, the Cigar Makers, had

pressured many city cigar
manufacturers into firing all
skilled Chinese laborers. The
union, in return, guaranteed that
it would supply white
replacements.
In 1902, Gompers himself
co-authored an AFL pamphlet on
the necessity of Chinese
exclusion. In it, he argues that
"the superior whites had to
exclude the inferior Asiatics by
law, or if necessary, by force of
arms." He says,"The Yellow Man
found it natural to lie, cheat, and
murder and 99 out of every 100
Chinese are gamblers."
The pamphlet quotes with
approval a petition some San
Franciscans sent to Congress in
which they warned lawmakers to
beware of the offspring of
interracial unions between whites
and orientals because they have
proved "invariably degenerate."
In addition, Gompers raises the
spectre of Chinese opium fiends
and the possibility that opium use
would spread to white boys and
girls.
It was a time when politicians

queue ordinance, the supervisors

placed a schedule of license fees
on laundries that was aimed at
Chinese establishments. The Board
also banned all theatrical
performances from 1 p.m. until 6
a.m. in order to stop late-night
Chinese theater.
In the same period, the state
legislature was induced to
stringently regulate the Chinese
custom of transportation of the
dead to China. The legislature also
voted a subsidy to the California
Labor and Employment Exchange
with the stipulation that it not be
used by orientals.
Generally all the municipal and
state ordinances directed against
the Chinese in this period were
worded in terms of typical welfare
state concern with health, safety,
and sanitation.
Increased Legislation
With the rise of the virulently
anti-Chinese Workingmen's Party
in San Francisco, the pace of
anti-Chinese legislation increased.
In 1880, an elaborate building code
was drafted regulating the
material to be used in and the
design of laundries.
In 1882, the Board passed an
ordinance providing that one
could not be in the laundry
business in certain parts of the
San Francisco without being
vouched for by 12 taxpayers on
his block. Then the Board itself
had to approve the person.
Justice Field considered this
ordinance in Circuit Court. He
believed that the due process
clause guaranteed a constitutional
right to freely contract and do
business. He saw that regulation
of entry into the laundry business
was an abrogation of such
freedom.
He could not see how washing
clothes endangered the public
order, so he said the Board had no
right to regulate laundries per se
and threw out the law.
Constitution Bans Chinese
Meanwhile, California had a
new state constitution which
forbade private corporations from
hiring Chinese workers (these
clauses and the laws enforcing
them were later thrown out of the
courts on freedom of contract
grounds). The new constitution
also denied Chinese the right to
own or inherit land in California.
All this time, parades, rallies,
and demonstrations by the whites
against the Chinese dominated the
public life of San Francisco.
Several local newspapers rivaled
local politicians for leadership of
the anti-Chinese crusade.
In the face of public threats to
destroy Chinatown and massacre
the Chinese, wealthy Chinese
businessmen hired trained private
police, who were called
"specials."
These men have often been

depicted as thugs hired to protect
gambling and prostitution
activities. In fact, as historian
Alexander Saxton points out,
they were "to defend Chinatown
against intrusion from the
non-Chinese city surrounding it."
Chinese Exclusion Act
In 1882, the local -California
anti-Chinese movement achieved
national stature with the passage
by Congress of the Chinese
Exclusion Act. The only real
opponents on the national level of
this move were the old antislavery
Abolitionists (like William Lloyd
Garrison), who had a history of
opposition to racism and defense
of the rights of man.
Social Darwinists, adherents of
a newly influential view that
stressed the functional value of
individualism, also opposed the
new law.
In the wake of the exclusion
law, national labor organizations
began organizing in San Francisco.
By 1885, Samuel Gompers' old
union, the Cigar Makers, had

pressured many city cigar
manufacturers into firing all
skilled Chinese laborers. The
union, in return, guaranteed that
it would supply white
replacements.
In 1902, Gompers himself
co-authored an AFL pamphlet on
the necessity of Chinese
exclusion. In it, he argues that
"the superior whites had to
exclude the inferior Asiatics by
law, or if necessary, by force of
arms." He says,"The Yellow Man
found it natural to lie, cheat, and
murder and 99 out of every 100
Chinese are gamblers."
The pamphlet quotes with
approval a petition some San
Franciscans sent to Congress in
which they warned lawmakers to
beware of the offspring of
interracial unions between whites
and orientals because they have
proved "invariably degenerate."
In addition, Gompers raises the
spectre of Chinese opium fiends
and the possibility that opium use
would spread to white boys and
girls.
It was a time when politicians
spoke of the "moon-eyed
menace." In the late 19th
century, San Francisco
businessmen tried to destroy their
more efficient competitors by
mobilizing racial antagonism.
They stirred mobs to
physically damage the property of
competitors who employed
Chinese labor. They, along with
organized white labor, induced
the state legislature to pass a law
which said that products had to
carry stamps declaring the race of
the labor used in their production.
*

It was a time when organized
white labor was the mainstay of
anti-Chinese political activity in
San Francisco. The persecution
reached its height in the success of
the Workingmen's Party in the
City during the 1870s.
There had been large numbers
of Chinese in California since the
Gold Rush in the 1850s (a heavy
tax on alien miners was aimed
especially at them). Additional
Chinese later came into the state
to work on the building of Sen.
Leland Stanford's Central Pacific
Railroad.
In the 1870 sand early 1880s,
the Chinese constituted
one-fourth to one-fifth of
California's wage-earning
population. In San Francisco,
Chinese workers predominated in
pork butchering, vegetable and
fish peddling, laundering, and

domestic service.
In addition, the products of
Chinese working in large
manufacturing concerns in cigar
making, shoemaking, and tailoring
were undercutting the products of
smaller, less efficient firms
employing solely white labor.
In the face of competitive
pressure from the hard-working
Chinese immigrants, many whites
turned to the political process in
an effort to suppress the Chinese
through regulation of economic
activity and labor conditions.
They also prohibited further
Chinese immigration. Some
wanted to go so far as to expel all
Chinese from the U.S.
Democratic Party
Anti-Chinese agitation was the
ideological basis for the revival of
the Democratic Party in California
after the Civil War, a conflict

which left the Democrats a
minority in much of the North.
But in San Francisco, the
anticoolie clubs provided an
ongoing organizational base for
the party.
In the wake of summer
anti-Chinese demonstrations in
1870, the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors passed a so-called
cubic air ordinance aimed at
putting out of business boarding
houses in Chinatown.
Three years later, the Board
passed the famous "Queue
Ordinance" which ordered that
every male prisoner sentenced to
jail had to have his hair cut to
within one inch of his scalp. Thus
Chinese were deprived of their
pigtails.
Like Persecuting Jews
Later in 1879, U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Stephen J. Field,
who believed in protecting human
rights via the Constitution's due
process clause, described such a
queue ordinance as special
legislation directed against a class.
He likened it to persecuting Jews
by compelling all prisoners to eat
pork.
At the same time as the first
queue ordinance, the supervisors

placed a schedule of license fees
on laundries that was aimed at
Chinese establishments. The Board
also banned all theatrical

In the wake of the exclusion
law, national labor organizations
began organizing in San Francisco.
By 1885, Samuel Gompers' old
union, the Cigar Makers, had

pressured many city cigar
manufacturers into firing all
skilled Chinese laborers. The
union, in return, guaranteed that
it would supply white
replacements.
In 1902, Gompers himself
co-authored an AFL pamphlet on
the necessity of Chinese
exclusion. In it, he argues that
"the superior whites had to
exclude the inferior Asiatics by
law, or if necessary, by force of
arms." He says,"The Yellow Man
found it natural to lie, cheat, and
murder and 99 out of every 100
Chinese are gamblers."
The pamphlet quotes with
approval a petition some San
Franciscans sent to Congress in
which they warned lawmakers to
beware of the offspring of
interracial unions between whites
and orientals because they have
proved "invariably degenerate."
In addition, Gompers raises the
spectre of Chinese opium fiends
and the possibility that opium use
would spread to white boys and
girls.
It was a time when politicians
spoke of the "moon-eyed
menace." In the late 19th
century, San Francisco
businessmen tried to destroy their
more efficient competitors by
mobilizing racial antagonism.
They stirred mobs to
physically damage the property of
competitors who employed
Chinese labor. They, along with
organized white labor, induced
the state legislature to pass a law
which said that products had to
carry stamps declaring the race of
the labor used in their production.

It was a time when organized
white labor was the mainstay of
anti-Chinese political activity in
San Francisco. The persecution
reached its height in the success of
the Workingmen's Party in the
City during the 1870s.
There had been large numbers
of Chinese in California since the
Gold Rush in the 1850s (a heavy
tax on alien miners was aimed
especially at them). Additional
Chinese later came into the state
to work on the building of Sen.
Leland Stanford's Central Pacific
Railroad.
In the 1870 sand early 1880s,
the Chinese constituted
one-fourth to one-fifth of
California's wage-earning
population. In San Francisco,
Chinese workers predominated in
pork butchering, vegetable and
fish peddling, laundering, and

domestic service.
In addition, the products of
Chinese working in large
manufacturing concerns in cigar
making, shoemaking, and tailoring
were undercutting the products of
smaller, less efficient firms
employing solely white labor.
In the face of competitive
pressure from the hard-working
Chinese immigrants, many whites
turned to the political process in
an effort to suppress the Chinese
through regulation of economic
activity and labor conditions.
They also prohibited further
Chinese immigration. Some
wanted to go so far as to expel all
Chinese from the U.S.
Democratic Party
Anti-Chinese agitation was the
ideological basis for the revival of
the Democratic Party in California
after the Civil War, a conflict

which left the Democrats a
minority in much of the North.
But in San Francisco, the
anticoolie clubs provided an
ongoing organizational base for
the party.
In the wake of summer
anti-Chinese demonstrations in
1870, the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors passed a so-called
cubic air ordinance aimed at
putting out of business boarding
houses in Chinatown.
Three years later, the Board
passed the famous "Queue
Ordinance" which ordered that
every male prisoner sentenced to
jail had to have his hair cut to
within one inch of his scalp. Thus
Chinese were deprived of their
pigtails.
Like Persecuting Jews
Later in 1879, U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Stephen J. Field,
who believed in protecting human
rights via the Constitution's due
process clause, described such a
queue ordinance as special
legislation directed against a class.
He likened it to persecuting Jews
by compelling all prisoners to eat
pork.
At the same time as the first
queue ordinance, the supervisors

placed a schedule of license fees
on laundries that was aimed at
Chinese establishments. The Board
also banned all theatrical
performances from 1 p.m. until 6
a.m. in order to stop late-night
Chinese theater.
In the same period, the state
legislature was induced to
stringently regulate the Chinese
custom of transportation of the
dead to China. The legislature also
voted a subsidy to the California
Labor and Employment Exchange
with the stipulation that it not be
used by orientals.
Generally all the municipal and
state ordinances directed against
the Chinese in this period were
worded in terms of typical welfare
state concern with health, safety,
and sanitation.
Increased Legislation
With the rise of the virulently
anti-Chinese Workingmen's Party
in San Francisco, the pace of
anti-Chinese legislation increased.
In 1880, an elaborate building code
was drafted regulating the
material to be used in and the
design of laundries.
In 1882, the Board passed an
ordinance providing that one
