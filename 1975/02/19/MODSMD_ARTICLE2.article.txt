# Economic Factors To Tighten Tenure
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Economic considerations, while not
a primary factor in the evaluation of
individual tenure cases, will lead to the
development of carefully structured
University guidelines for tenure in the
future, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey Royden said last
night.
Royden stated, "I don't see any
decisions, at least in the last year, that
were affected by budgetary
considerations, but it's true that it has
become apparent that each open
position is very precious and should
not be squandered."
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Royden discussed the
ultimate goal of a "steady-state"
faculty, in which an equal number of
faculty would be given tenure as
would retire. He pointed toward the
prospect of "a long-range modeling
plan to tell departments how often
they could make tenure
appointments."
He said, however, that he doesn't
want "to get into the inflexibility of a
Harvard-like system," in which an
extremely small percentage of junior
faculty is promoted. Instead, the goal
of restrictions on tenure would be
reduction of the percentage of
promotions from its present 85 to 90
percent figure to 35 or 40 percent, he
said.
Royden also stated that an early
faculty retirement plan proposed as a
possible solution for staff reduction
was considered but was not "terribly
attractive in the light that one is
reluctant to retire in a bad economy."
Commenting on the balance
between research and teaching in
tenure considerations, Royden cited a
Stanford dean's contention in 1972
that "we ought to have every
candidate good in each and
outstanding in one." He admitted,
however, that recent discussion had
"tended more to scholarship than to
teaching," but stressed that "we
should strive to see that we have
both."
"From my own standpoint,
teaching is every bit as important as
future scholarship, but one of the

things that enter into it is that it is
easier to judge scholarship than it is to
judge teaching," he remarked.
A schedule for granting of tenure
may affect faculty recruitment,
Royden admitted. He stated, however,
that "the problem is not one of
attracting new people, but one of the
commitment you'll get from current
junior faculty."
On undergraduate schooling,
Royden stated, "We have seen a great
shift recently to pre-professional fields
of study, and have been very careful to
maintain the excellence of the
nonprofessional courses."
Emphasizing his belief in the
humanities, he commented, "We tend
to have too much of a narrow focus by
looking at the problems at hand
without realizing the vast experience
in the past that the study of
humanities imparts to us."
