# Cable Cars--Like Rice-A-Roni
## 'The San Francisco Treat' 
### BONNY RODDEN 
If you think cable cars are just
a San Francisco tourist trap,
you're on the wrong track.
Businessmen board the cars,
straightening out their ties on
their way to the financial district.
Old women, one arm cradling a
bag of groceries, struggle onto the
outside bench on their way home
from shopping.
And then there are those who
make a living jerking brakes and
collecting fares — the gripman and
the conductor.
Robust romanticists on their
first day of cable car training soon
learn "it's not as glamorous as
they thought," Sam McDaniel, a
26-year veteran, chuckles.
Those first 25 days of training
are exhausting, he explains as he
pulls the brake, his muscles
bulging with strength.
Lots of Exercise
"You operate a cable car with
your feet and hands. It takes body
coordination; it's a lot of
exercise."
The car stops at the crest of
Powell and California. People
clamor off, dragging cameras and
hesitating mates. People clamor
on, pushing and shoving for the
breezy outside benches.
"Please move from behind the
brake," McDaniel asks of the

newcomers.
As the car jerks to a start he
continues, "The work's a little too
rugged for a girl. A woman can't
handle it. It's even too rugged for
a lot of men."
A few of the passengers glare.
A woman who fits the 175-pound
weight requirement would
probably be allowed to run a
cable car, he adds, qualifying his
first statement.
Loves Work
But even though the work is
rigorous, McDaniel loves it."I feel
I'm contributing to the City," he
remarks. He acts as tour guide,
restaurant connoisseur and lost and
found administrator for his
passengers.
Strangers to the City often
don't realize that there are two
branches to the Hyde Street line.
Frequently families get split up
with some members ending up
near Fisherman's Wharf while the
rest of the crew took another car
which deposited them at
Ghiradelli Square.
"White shoes are a very good
thing to look for," McDaniel
remarks in a discussion on how to
discern tourists. A few glances are
shot his way from bodies
ensconced in maps.
McDaniel comments that he
doesn't mind most tourists'

questions. "They're more jolly,
interested in what's going on than
the regular passengers."
He prefers foreigners as
passengers because "most of the
foreigners enjoy this country
more than we do."
The most embarassing question
he has ever been asked is "Do
they have runaways?" And nearly
everyone asks it.
McDaniel remarks that cable
cars don't just go "flying down
the hill out of control." There is
an elaborate safety device which
grabs the six-strand cables. If one
of the strands is frayed the cable
immediately stops running.
Lack Of Experience
Most of the cable car accidents
have been caused by "lack of
experience on the part of the
gripman," McDaniel states. "Some
of the younger people don't just
heed to responsibility; they're not
concerned enough," he laments.
Also brake failure prompts
accidents too.
At an intersection, the cable
car jerks to a stop, the cable still
humming. McDaniel explains the
cable has hit a "dead spot." He
and the conductor jump off and
push the car over the void area.
McDaniel is always jumping or

LONE RIDERS—In the early hours of the morning it's easy to get a
seat on the outside of a cable car. It may be a bit brisk though.
