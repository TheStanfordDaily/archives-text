## Alvin Lee Returns 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
SAN FRANCISCO—The
balcony was closed off and the
floor was virtually empty for
Alvin Lee's return to Winterland
Friday night.
The British rock star has split
from his seven-year association
with Ten Years After and formed
Alvin Lee and Company,
gathering together Steve
Thompson (bass) and Ronnie
Leahy (keyboards) from Maggie
Bell's backup band Stone the
Crows, plus lan Wallace (drums)
and Mel Collins (sax) from King
Crimson.
Lee doesn't just "wow"
audiences anymore with his
nonstop finger action. The group
performs a mixture of jazz, roc k,
blues, and boogie, providing Lee

with a wider musical framework
than Ten Years After to display
his stylistic versatility on the
electric guitar. Most of the
evening's selections were from the
group's live double album, In
Flight.
The crowd didn't
wholeheartedly approve of Lee's
changes; they wanted to get their
heads kicked with cold hard rock,
and although they got some, it
obviously wasn't enough.
The act opened with "Cot To
Keep Movin,'" a rock song
centered around a repetitive,
steady lead guitar riff, reminiscent
of Lee's older material. The
similarity ended there.
When he broke into a solo, the
speediness was still evident, but he
chose his notes in a more careful,
controlled manner. Each one was
clear, melodious, and distinct.
Mel Collins stole the show with
a blasting tenor sax solo during a
jazzy instrumental number, while
Lee stood quietly in the
background, floating quietly
sustained leads over the basic
rhythm.
Ronnie Leahy picked up the
pace of a second instrumental
number by playing single notes in
incredibly rapid succession on the
electric organ.
Thompson introduced "There's
a Feeling" with solid, guiding bass
playing, which remained
noticeably tight throughout the
set.
Timely backup vocals were lent
by two funky black singers. "I call
these girls the Monotones," said
Lee, flashing a small grin. Their
vocals didn't always match the
group's material, but Lee
definitely needs an addition in
this area as he sings haltingly and
often drops the last syllable of his
words.
"Every Blues You've Ever
Heard" sounds exactly like the
title: plain old classic blues, with a
plaintive lead guitar line. During
this song, plus "Let's Get Back"
and "Money Honey," various
instruments tended to blend
together, causing a muddy effect.
Alvin Lee and Company
finished up the evening with two
heavy rock tunes: "I'm Writing
You a Letter," and "Ride My
Train," which has received wide
FM airplay.
The Winterland audience was
downright mean to Gentle Giant,
whose lead singer was finally
reduced to yelling obscenities
back at the crowd. Despite a
variety of instruments
(xylophone, electric cello,
steel-pedal violin), Gentle Giant's
music is generally noisy and
tedious, and their fooling around
with the synthesizer added to the
confusion.

similarity ended there.
When he broke into a solo, the
speediness was still evident, but he
chose his notes in a more careful,
controlled manner. Each one was
clear, melodious, and distinct.
Mel Collins stole the show with
a blasting tenor sax solo during a
jazzy instrumental number, while
Lee stood quietly in the
background, floating quietly
sustained leads over the basic
rhythm.
Ronnie Leahy picked up the
pace of a second instrumental
number by playing single notes in
incredibly rapid succession on the
electric organ.
Thompson introduced "There's
a Feeling" with solid, guiding bass
playing, which remained
noticeably tight throughout the
set.
Timely backup vocals were lent
by two funky black singers. "I call
these girls the Monotones," said
Lee, flashing a small grin. Their
vocals didn't always match the
group's material, but Lee
definitely needs an addition in
this area as he sings haltingly and
often drops the last syllable of his
words.
"Every Blues You've Ever
Heard" sounds exactly like the
title: plain old classic blues, with a
plaintive lead guitar line. During
this song, plus "Let's Get Back"
and "Money Honey," various
instruments tended to blend
together, causing a muddy effect.
Alvin Lee and Company
finished up the evening with two
heavy rock tunes: "I'm Writing
You a Letter," and "Ride My
Train," which has received wide
FM airplay.
The Winterland audience was
downright mean to Gentle Giant,
whose lead singer was finally
reduced to yelling obscenities
back at the crowd. Despite a
variety of instruments
(xylophone, electric cello,
steel-pedal violin), Gentle Giant's
music is generally noisy and
tedious, and their fooling around
with the synthesizer added to the
confusion.
SAN FRANCISCO—The
balcony was closed off and the
floor was virtually empty for
Alvin Lee's return to Winterland
Friday night.
The British rock star has split
from his seven-year association
with Ten Years After and formed
Alvin Lee and Company,
gathering together Steve
Thompson (bass) and Ronnie
Leahy (keyboards) from Maggie
Bell's backup band Stone the
Crows, plus lan Wallace (drums)
and Mel Collins (sax) from King
Crimson.
Lee doesn't just "wow"
audiences anymore with his
nonstop finger action. The group
performs a mixture of jazz, roc k,
blues, and boogie, providing Lee

with a wider musical framework
than Ten Years After to display
his stylistic versatility on the
electric guitar. Most of the
evening's selections were from the
group's live double album, In
Flight.
The crowd didn't
wholeheartedly approve of Lee's
changes; they wanted to get their
heads kicked with cold hard rock,
and although they got some, it
obviously wasn't enough.
The act opened with "Cot To
Keep Movin,'" a rock song
centered around a repetitive,
steady lead guitar riff, reminiscent
of Lee's older material. The
similarity ended there.
