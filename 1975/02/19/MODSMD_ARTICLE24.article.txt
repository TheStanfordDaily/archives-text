# Inner City Troupe Dances Spottily
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
BERKELEY—UntiI recently, the Los
Angeles-based Inner City Repertory Dance
Company has been synonymous with the name
Donald McKayle. Since its inception in 1970,
McKayle has been the company's artistic director,
principal choreographer and guiding force.
Currently, however, McKayle is on leave, and at
last Wednesday evening's performance in Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium his absence was evident.
The Inner City Dance Company has always tended
toward an ethnic and modern dance eclecticism
that can easily become a liability if not handled
carefully.
While McKayle was around the proper mix of
dance styles was always maintained, but Wednesday
night things were obviously out of balance.
The evening's concert began on a strong note,
with Migrations, a coolly classic modern dance
choreographed by McKayle, and set to an
imaginative sound collage.
Costumed in stark white leotards and tights, and
set off by a radiant blue backdrop, the McKayle
dancers ebbed and flowed across the stage in
continually changing groupings. At one moment six
dancers might come together for a fleeting unison
sequence and the next instant dissolve into three
pairs, with each couple performing unique and
variegated patterns.
It is moments like these that make watching
dance worthwhile. When it's impossible to take in
all that's happening at once, then the very nature of
our perceptions are challenged, and we are forced
to alternate our attention between the parts and
the whole.
One minor, yet disconcerting problem with
Migrations was the fact that almost all McKayle's
dancers have an unusually heavy musculature, and
this coupled with the earth-bound quality of much
of their movement made the dancers seem
unnecessarily ponderous. This was unfortunate
especially in a dance like Migrations, where there is

an emphasis on buoyancy and lightness.
Songs of The Disinherited, the evening's final
dance, was the only other piece choreographed by
McKayle. Song:, like Migrations, was a strong, clean
work both in its conception and execution.
It consisted of four sections each portraying a
different aspect of "voices from the black
diaspora." The most memorable of the four was
Angelitos Negros, a poignant solo set to a mournful
Roberta Flack song.
Throughout the piece there was a compelling
counterpoint of movement and music; as the sound
built, the dancing became more and more
restrained, until at last the dancing figure froze in
momentary stillness, engulfed by the sonorous roar
of Flack's voice.
Sandwiched between Migrations and Songs
were four brief solos choreographed and performed
by various company members. None of these
dances, with the possible exception of Ruby
Millsap's Because My Feet Are Dancing, were
genuinely concert quality pieces.
So instead of rounding out the performance
they had the effect of fragmenting the evening,
making it seem overly long and disjointed.
Perhaps the least appreciated but potentially
most interesting dance Wednesday night was Lester
Horton's Orozco. Horton is a vital, but little known
figure in the annals of modern dance.
He was one of the first individuals to begin
choreographing ethnic dances for a racially mixed
company. And if not for his untimely death in
1953 he would certainly have been a potent force
in today's dance world.
It is fitting therefore that McKayle's company
choose to include a Horton work in their Berkeley
concert, because Horton is really the seminal figure
in the dance genre of people like McKayle.
It is also a credit to the talent of both McKayle
and Horton that this juxtaposition of their dances
worked to advantage for both, especially on the
occasion of such a stylistically mottled evening.

last Wednesday evening's performance in Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium his absence was evident.
The Inner City Dance Company has always tended
toward an ethnic and modern dance eclecticism
that can easily become a liability if not handled
carefully.
While McKayle was around the proper mix of
dance styles was always maintained, but Wednesday
night things were obviously out of balance.
The evening's concert began on a strong note,
with Migrations, a coolly classic modern dance
choreographed by McKayle, and set to an
imaginative sound collage.
Costumed in stark white leotards and tights, and
set off by a radiant blue backdrop, the McKayle
dancers ebbed and flowed across the stage in
continually changing groupings. At one moment six
dancers might come together for a fleeting unison
sequence and the next instant dissolve into three
pairs, with each couple performing unique and
variegated patterns.
It is moments like these that make watching
dance worthwhile. When it's impossible to take in
all that's happening at once, then the very nature of
our perceptions are challenged, and we are forced
to alternate our attention between the parts and
the whole.
One minor, yet disconcerting problem with
Migrations was the fact that almost all McKayle's
dancers have an unusually heavy musculature, and
this coupled with the earth-bound quality of much
of their movement made the dancers seem
unnecessarily ponderous. This was unfortunate
especially in a dance like Migrations, where there is

an emphasis on buoyancy and lightness.
Songs of The Disinherited, the evening's final
dance, was the only other piece choreographed by
McKayle. Song:, like Migrations, was a strong, clean
work both in its conception and execution.
It consisted of four sections each portraying a
different aspect of "voices from the black
diaspora." The most memorable of the four was
Angelitos Negros, a poignant solo set to a mournful
Roberta Flack song.
Throughout the piece there was a compelling
counterpoint of movement and music; as the sound
built, the dancing became more and more
restrained, until at last the dancing figure froze in
momentary stillness, engulfed by the sonorous roar
of Flack's voice.
Sandwiched between Migrations and Songs
were four brief solos choreographed and performed
by various company members. None of these
dances, with the possible exception of Ruby
Millsap's Because My Feet Are Dancing, were
genuinely concert quality pieces.
So instead of rounding out the performance
they had the effect of fragmenting the evening,
making it seem overly long and disjointed.
Perhaps the least appreciated but potentially
most interesting dance Wednesday night was Lester
Horton's Orozco. Horton is a vital, but little known
figure in the annals of modern dance.
He was one of the first individuals to begin
choreographing ethnic dances for a racially mixed
company. And if not for his untimely death in
1953 he would certainly have been a potent force
in today's dance world.
It is fitting therefore that McKayle's company
choose to include a Horton work in their Berkeley
concert, because Horton is really the seminal figure
in the dance genre of people like McKayle.
It is also a credit to the talent of both McKayle
and Horton that this juxtaposition of their dances
worked to advantage for both, especially on the
occasion of such a stylistically mottled evening.
BERKELEY—UntiI recently, the Los
Angeles-based Inner City Repertory Dance
Company has been synonymous with the name
Donald McKayle. Since its inception in 1970,
McKayle has been the company's artistic director,
principal choreographer and guiding force.
Currently, however, McKayle is on leave, and at
