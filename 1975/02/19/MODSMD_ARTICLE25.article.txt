# Jingles To Hit Singles
## Manilow Sparkles 
### KEVIN SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO - It's a
long road from writing advertising
jingles to becoming a singing star.
Very few make it and it is likely
that very few try.
Barry Manilow is an exception.
After taking part in many of the
best-known ad jingles over the last
several years, Manilow decided he
wanted to put his talents to better
use.
So he hooked up with Bette
Midler as her arranger and
conductor, making a name for
himself within the recording
industry. However, he remained
unknown to the listening public.
Then along came a song called
"Mandy." During January,
"Mandy" climbed to the Number
One spot on the charts of
practically every Top 40 radio
station in the country.
But Manilow is not a one-song
artist, as he demonstrated Sunday
during the final night of a six-day
stand at the Boarding House.
As everyone knowns from
"Mandy," Manilow has a great

voice, but the real backbone of his
talent is his versatility. A forceful,
commanding performer, he
performs slow ballads, loud
rockers and big band-style tunes
all with equal skill.
He even throws in a little
classical. Perhaps the most moving
song he performed all night,
"Could It Be Magic," featured a
prelude written by Chopin.
In contrast, he really let loose
when singing "I Want To Be
Somebody's Baby," an infectious
rock-'n'-roller which, next to
"Mandy," is the best cut from his
most recent album, Manilow 11.
Manilow played the piano with
quite a lot of feeling, but he was
often drowned out by the rest of
his band which contained a guitar,
a bass, drums, and organ and a
three-woman chorus.
Strange Medley
Manilow performed several
songs from each of his first two
albums, wrapped around what he
called his "Strange Medley" of
greatest hits.
"I've actually been involved
with each of the tunes you're
about to hear," Manilow said,
introducing the medley. "I've
either sung them or arranged them
or written them."
The "tunes" were a bunch of
the well-known ads for such
companies as Kentucky Fried
Chicken ("Get a bucket of chicken,
have a barrel of fun"), Stridex
("Give your face something to

smile about") and Dr. Pepper
("It's not a cola, there are colas
by the score/ it's not a root beer,
it's much much more!"). The
audience loved them.
Lavender Shirt
Manilow's stage personality is
intriguing. His thick New York
accent and pleasing, non-stop
babble gave him the appearance of
being somewhat confused. And
his lavender shirt with sequins and
white hip-hugging jeans seemed
ludicrously out of place with his
music.
Fortunately, he didn't seem to
take himself too seriously, and
seemed genuinely amazed by the
success of "Mandy" and
embarrassed by the crowd's
overwhelmingly favorable
reaction.
His performance lasted less
than an hour, and there was no
encore, but Manilow certainly
gave the near capacity crowd of
250 people its money's worth. No
one went away grumbling.
Lot Of Mileage
The warm-up performer,
Richie Lecea, was a good
entertainer who got a lot of
mileage out of what little talent
he has.
Accompanied solely by his
six-string accoustic guitar, Lecea
got the crowd going with his
comic manner, but his voice was
very strained on higher notes and
his compositions weren't
particularly noteworthy.

("It's not a cola, there are colas
by the score/ it's not a root beer,
it's much much more!"). The
audience loved them.
Lavender Shirt
Manilow's stage personality is
intriguing. His thick New York
accent and pleasing, non-stop
babble gave him the appearance of
being somewhat confused. And
his lavender shirt with sequins and
white hip-hugging jeans seemed
ludicrously out of place with his
music.
Fortunately, he didn't seem to
take himself too seriously, and
seemed genuinely amazed by the
success of "Mandy" and
embarrassed by the crowd's
overwhelmingly favorable
reaction.
His performance lasted less
than an hour, and there was no
encore, but Manilow certainly
gave the near capacity crowd of
250 people its money's worth. No
one went away grumbling.
Lot Of Mileage
The warm-up performer,
Richie Lecea, was a good
entertainer who got a lot of
mileage out of what little talent
he has.
Accompanied solely by his
six-string accoustic guitar, Lecea
got the crowd going with his
comic manner, but his voice was
very strained on higher notes and
his compositions weren't
particularly noteworthy.
SAN FRANCISCO - It's a
long road from writing advertising
jingles to becoming a singing star.
Very few make it and it is likely
that very few try.
Barry Manilow is an exception.
After taking part in many of the
best-known ad jingles over the last
several years, Manilow decided he
wanted to put his talents to better
use.
So he hooked up with Bette
Midler as her arranger and
conductor, making a name for
himself within the recording
industry. However, he remained
unknown to the listening public.
Then along came a song called
"Mandy." During January,
"Mandy" climbed to the Number
One spot on the charts of
practically every Top 40 radio
station in the country.
But Manilow is not a one-song
artist, as he demonstrated Sunday
during the final night of a six-day
stand at the Boarding House.
As everyone knowns from
"Mandy," Manilow has a great

voice, but the real backbone of his
talent is his versatility. A forceful,
commanding performer, he
performs slow ballads, loud
rockers and big band-style tunes
all with equal skill.
He even throws in a little
classical. Perhaps the most moving
song he performed all night,
"Could It Be Magic," featured a
prelude written by Chopin.
In contrast, he really let loose
when singing "I Want To Be
Somebody's Baby," an infectious
rock-'n'-roller which, next to
"Mandy," is the best cut from his
most recent album, Manilow 11.
Manilow played the piano with
quite a lot of feeling, but he was
often drowned out by the rest of
his band which contained a guitar,
a bass, drums, and organ and a
three-woman chorus.
Strange Medley
Manilow performed several
songs from each of his first two
albums, wrapped around what he
called his "Strange Medley" of
greatest hits.
"I've actually been involved
with each of the tunes you're
about to hear," Manilow said,
introducing the medley. "I've
either sung them or arranged them
or written them."
The "tunes" were a bunch of
the well-known ads for such
companies as Kentucky Fried
Chicken ("Get a bucket of chicken,
have a barrel of fun"), Stridex
("Give your face something to

smile about") and Dr. Pepper
("It's not a cola, there are colas
by the score/ it's not a root beer,
it's much much more!"). The
