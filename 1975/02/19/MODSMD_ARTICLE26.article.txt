# Tower Bombs In Paris

### BOB HENRY 
EDITOR'S NOTE: A Warner
Brothers-sponsored concert tour
of Europe by Tower of Power,
Graham Central Station and the
Doobie Brothers has just
concluded. The Daily's foreign
music correspondent dispatched
the following report.

PARIS—On February 4 at the
Olympic Theatre here, Tower
of Power aggravated a
predominantly French audience
with an excellent performance of
their unique sound.
Two mpdioore and bland rock
V roll bands, Cold Feat and
Montrose, preceded and
followed Tower and fascinated
the crowd with three guitars and a
set of drums while Tower's brassy
jazz-funk-rock mode of music
earned only derisive boos and
whistles.
Tower of Power played tunes
from their newest album. Urban
Renewal, as well as older songs.
The French audience booed and
jeered throughout "What is Hip?,"
"So Very Hard To Go," "This
Time It's Real," "Don't Change

Horses In The Middle Of A
Stream " and "Knock Yourself
Out." It took a masterful and
entertaining organ-synthesizer
electric piano solo by Chester
Thompson to quiet the
dissatisfied crowd.
The band left C.T. alone and
he controlled the crowd with an
amazing display of both
musicianship and mechanical
know-how as the lights slowly
dimmed out. His solo continued
and then simultaneously blinking
lights illuminated the now full
stage, which included the "Tower
of Power Back To Oakland"
freeway sign, as the band began
"Oakland Stroke."
At Circle Star, Winterland, San
Jose Civic or the Oakland Arena,
this finale would have brought
tumultuous applause and an
immediate encore. At the
Olympic, however, it was poorly
received.
The few Americans in the
audience applauded
enthusiastically, but for the
majority Tower was an abysmal
waste of time.
