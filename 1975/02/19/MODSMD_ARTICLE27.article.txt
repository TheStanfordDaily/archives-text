# For Thad And Mel, Big Band Is A Constant Love Affair
## Once Around The Quad 
### DAVE SMITH 
Nine years ago, Thad Jones and
Mel Lewis first brought their big
jazz band together, and its
following has been growing
steadily ever since — culminating
last year in the band's sweeping
the Down Beat and I'layboy
magazine polls as the best big
band in the country.
Although there are only four
original members still with the
17-man band, Jones, who writes
most of the arrangements,
conducts, and plays flugelhorn,
and drummer Lewis have given
the band a distinctive sound that
makes its traditional Monday gig
at New York's Village Vanguard
one of the city's most popular
musical events.
This interview was taped two
weeks ago during the band's stay
at Stanford.
Big bands seem to be a scarce
breed these days; what are your
reasons for keeping up a big band?
Jones: Well, it represents a
lifetime of work, for one thing —
in addition to the special liking we
have for big bands. A big band
leaves you room to do just about
everything you want to do.
In a small group, you have only
a limited number of possibilities,
but in a big band you have that
amount of pieces times three, so
you can do a lot more.
Some people might say that
having a big band cuts down what
each musician can do.
Jones: That's not the way our
band is structured. We're basically
what we refer to as "players" —
we got our apprenticeship in small
groups where we did a lot of
playing, and now we try to
maintain the same feeling in the
big band. That's why you see so
many solos in our band.
Ho uch turnover is there in
your banu's lineup?
Jones: We've more
personnel changes in the past
year, actually, than ever before. . .
Lewis: But always in the same
chairs. Certain chairs are harder to

fill, because there's a more limited
number of players who can handle
them. Bass trombone, for
example: there just aren't that
many bass trombone players. But
we haven't had a change in our
saxophone section in three years.
How much of your drum parts
is written out and how much is
improvisation ?
Lewis: Since it's always me
there and since he knows it's me
and he knows what I will do,
Thad will write certain things —
cues — that are helpful to me, and
he doesn't have to write anything
else, because he knows I'll do it
anyway!
Jones: You know it's really
better that way, because it
doesn't confine you to just notes.

A lot of younger musicians seem
to have a preoccupation with
notes, with playing things just so
in that respect — you have to look
at it in terms of a whole work of
music, not just notes that have to
be played.
You haven Y used too many
electric instruments in your band,
unlike Gil Evans for instance. Why
have you decided to leave them
out?
Jones: I don't feel as though
we're coming up short in any way
by not using them. Electronics
can only do so much. In a way it
detracts from the personal ability
of the musician, because when
you saddle them or shackle them
with these electronic instruments,
you're giving them not the sound

of their horn, and not the sound
of a human voice, but something
entirely inhuman.
Besides, if somebody were to
pull the plug. . .
Lewis: That happened to
Weather Report up in Boston. A
fuse blew and it was 45 minutes
before they could find it, and in
that time the band was dead. The
bass player had no acoustic bass;
he couldn't play a thing.
Jones: Let's just say we're not
into it at the present time.
So you're not thinking of
putting a wah-wah pedal on your
flugelhorn ?
Jones: (laughs) Not at the
moment.
Lewis: All a lot of these
electric instruments are is just
computer aids. A moog is nothing
but a computer, you know, you
can't stretch out on it. Jazz music
should be played on an
instrument that's an extension of
one's personality. A moog is an
extension only of one's technical
ability.
You can't compare a ballad
played by a Ben Webster [tenor
saxophonist] to a ballad played
on a moog synthesizer — it's just
not the same sort of thing.
A lot of your players have been
studio musicians at some time in
their careers. Do you think studio
musicians feel , ustratcd most of
the time?
Jones: Sure. Some of the best
and most qualified musicians are
in studios, and they hate every
minute they spend there. They
like the money, but when you're
playing what someone else wants,
you are denying the creative force
in you.
Lewis: Studio music is just
mass production of whatever the
public wants. So many musicians
feel it's the best — and it is, as far
as money goes — the best part of
the music "business." But it's
stock, it's not creative.
Jones: You become a musician
out of love and respect for the
music, so to be involved and then

to have to do what someone else
wants is bound to cause a backup
of feelings.
How much money in the form
of grants and subsidies is available
to jazz musicians?
Jones: You can just about
count the number of musicians
that are subsidized on the fingers
of one hand. I think that's
changing, though, because the
people with grants are realizing
that jazz is a true art form —
really the only true art form this
country has ever produced.
How much racism and

that the word "jazz" itself was a
slang expression for "copulating"
— but by the musicians keeping it
and having it gain respect, they've
made it a whole different thing.
So you don't mind the word
jazz.
Jones: Not at all.
Lewis: I love it. In the days
when it was first used, musicians
were second class citizens. Now
it's a different situation entirely —
and thank Cod for Louis

THE BIG BAND—-Thad Jones conducts an earlier version of the
Jones-Lewis Orchestra (Mel Lewis on drums). The band has disposed
of its coats and ties in favor of more colorful dashikis, and Lewis
now shows a full beard, but the orchestra's sound is as solid as ever.
