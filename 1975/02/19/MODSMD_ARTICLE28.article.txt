Court:! Nixon Exceeded Authority
WASHINGTON — Ruling for the first time on an
impoundment issue, the Supreme Court declared yesterday
that former President Richard M. Nixon exceeded his
authority in withholding pollution control funds.
A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) said the ruling would have little immediate impact
on the specific funds in question. But government lawyers
were studying the decision's possible impact on the overall
impoundment issue.
The EPA spokesman said the court ruling would have
little practical effect on the pollution control funds, which
would go mostly for sewer construction, because the funds
can be spent only after they are obligated for specific
projects.
He said EPA has been able to obligate only $4 billion of
the $9 billion that already was available before the court's
ruling. The ruling freed an additional $9 billion.
Abortion Legalized In Italy
ROME — Italy's highest court, crossing swords with the
Vatican, ruled yesterday that abortion is legal in this
Roman CaLholic country if pregnancy threatens a woman's
health.
The Vatican reacted in a broadcast, saying: "The ruling
is questionable and of extreme gravity because it backs
killing of the one to be born."
The ruling by the constitutional court, equivalent of the
U.S. Supreme Court, came amid a massive campaign by
feminists and most political parties for a reform of Italy's
Fascist-era abortion law.
Specifically, the court declared unconstitutional Article
516 of the Italian penal code. The law barred abortion
under any circumstance, and set a prison term of two to
five years for women who underwent abortions, as well as
for doctors, nurses and anyone else involved in the
operation.
The law was widely flouted. This nation of 55.6 million
persons has 1.2 million abortions a year, according to U.N.
estimates. Most are performed outside hospitals under
crude medical conditions.
Most of Italy's political parties favor a liberalized
abortion law. But the dominant Christian Democrats
control the votes in parliament, and they along with the
Vatican favor the present law. It was adopted during World
War II to "protect the national stock" as part of dictator
Benito Mussolini's dream to resurrect the Roman Empire.
Iran Guarantees Oil Sales To Israel
PARIS - Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi gave assurances
yesterday that Iran would replace any oil Israel loses as a
result of returning the Abu Rudeis oilfields to Egypt as part
of a Sinai agreement.
"Once the tankers are loaded, we don't mind where the
oil goes. It is a purely commercial transaction for us," the
Shah said after he and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
lunched in Zurich, Switzerland.
In London earlier in the day, the secretary sought to
insure that the Soviet Union will not block another interim
Mideast agreement, by promising not to exclude the Soviets
from his efforts.
"I hope the Soviet Union will understand that any step
toward peace is in the interest of everybody," he said. "We
have always asserted that a final settlement will require the
participation and cooperation of the Soviet Union."
The Soviets, feeling left out of present Mideast
negotiations, favor a quick resumption of the multilateral
Geneva peace talks, which the United States fears would
break down into disputes over Palestinian participation.

Kissinger, who met Monday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei A. Gromyko, is thought willing to resume the
Geneva talks after he gets a Sinai accord.
Ford. Demos Clash On Tariff Hike
WASHINGTON — The first step in a Democratic energy
program must be to defeat President Ford's oil tariff hike,
Sen. John O. Pastore (D-R.1.) said yesterday, only hours
after Ford indicated he plans to veto such a move.
Ford had held out both the stick and the carrot to
Congress on his energy program, threatening to veto oil
tariff legislation but offering to "make accommodations on
details."
Pastore made his statement as the Senate Democratic
Policy Committee unanimously approved a substitute for
Ford's energy program. Pastore heads the seven-member
task force which submitted the program to the policy
committee.
While Pastore declined to make details of the program
available, it is known that it includes gradually higher
gasoline taxes, rising as unemployment declines.
The program emphasizes fighting inflation rather than
cutting oil imports. It now goes before Senate committee
chairmen for consideration.
The Senate program contains essentially the same tax
cuts already approved by the House Ways and Means
Committee, which would be more generous at lower
income levels than those recommended by Ford.
Doctor Released In Abortion Case
BOSTON — Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin was sentenced to one
year's probation yesterday for his manslaughter conviction
in the death of an aborted fetus and later filed an appeal of
the conviction.
Edelin was immediately invited to return to work at the
hospital where he did the abortion and his attorney said the
36-year-old obstetrician was ready to return.
Edelin's lawyer filed his notice of appeal of the
conviction at Suffolk Superior Court yesterday afternoon.
The attorney said he would base his appeal on the
contentions the conviction went against the weight of the
evidence, and that Edelin was not duly informed that his
medical procedure could be grounds for a manslaughter
charge.
Superior Court Judge James P. McGuire, who could have
sentenced Edelin to up to 20 years in prison, said he would
stay Edelin's sentence pending the outcome of the appeal.
Swiss Franc Rises, Dollar Declines
ZURICH — The Swiss franc rose 68.9 percent in value
against the U.S. dollar between May 1971 and the end of
last month, the Swiss Credit Bank said yesterday. The
dollar's decline against the strong franc was worse than that
of most other major currencies.
The bank, one of Switzerland's three largest, said the
franc had risen an average of 47.2 percent against 20 major
currencies since May 1971.
The Swiss franc rose 74.4 percent against the Italian lira
in the same period and 73.6 percent against the British
pound. It rose only 10 percent against the West German
mark, 34.1 percent against the French franc and 38.4
percent against the Japanese yen.

The ruling by the constitutional court, equivalent of the
U.S. Supreme Court, came amid a massive campaign by
feminists and most political parties for a reform of Italy's
Fascist-era abortion law.
Specifically, the court declared unconstitutional Article
516 of the Italian penal code. The law barred abortion
under any circumstance, and set a prison term of two to
five years for women who underwent abortions, as well as
for doctors, nurses and anyone else involved in the
operation.
The law was widely flouted. This nation of 55.6 million
persons has 1.2 million abortions a year, according to U.N.
estimates. Most are performed outside hospitals under
crude medical conditions.
Most of Italy's political parties favor a liberalized
abortion law. But the dominant Christian Democrats
control the votes in parliament, and they along with the
Vatican favor the present law. It was adopted during World
War II to "protect the national stock" as part of dictator
Benito Mussolini's dream to resurrect the Roman Empire.
Iran Guarantees Oil Sales To Israel
PARIS - Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi gave assurances
yesterday that Iran would replace any oil Israel loses as a
result of returning the Abu Rudeis oilfields to Egypt as part
of a Sinai agreement.
"Once the tankers are loaded, we don't mind where the
oil goes. It is a purely commercial transaction for us," the
Shah said after he and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
lunched in Zurich, Switzerland.
In London earlier in the day, the secretary sought to
insure that the Soviet Union will not block another interim
Mideast agreement, by promising not to exclude the Soviets
from his efforts.
"I hope the Soviet Union will understand that any step
toward peace is in the interest of everybody," he said. "We
have always asserted that a final settlement will require the
participation and cooperation of the Soviet Union."
The Soviets, feeling left out of present Mideast
negotiations, favor a quick resumption of the multilateral
Geneva peace talks, which the United States fears would
break down into disputes over Palestinian participation.

Kissinger, who met Monday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei A. Gromyko, is thought willing to resume the
Geneva talks after he gets a Sinai accord.
Ford. Demos Clash On Tariff Hike
WASHINGTON — The first step in a Democratic energy
program must be to defeat President Ford's oil tariff hike,
Sen. John O. Pastore (D-R.1.) said yesterday, only hours
after Ford indicated he plans to veto such a move.
Ford had held out both the stick and the carrot to
Congress on his energy program, threatening to veto oil
tariff legislation but offering to "make accommodations on
details."
Pastore made his statement as the Senate Democratic
Policy Committee unanimously approved a substitute for
Ford's energy program. Pastore heads the seven-member
task force which submitted the program to the policy
committee.
While Pastore declined to make details of the program
available, it is known that it includes gradually higher
gasoline taxes, rising as unemployment declines.
The program emphasizes fighting inflation rather than
cutting oil imports. It now goes before Senate committee
chairmen for consideration.
The Senate program contains essentially the same tax
cuts already approved by the House Ways and Means
Committee, which would be more generous at lower
income levels than those recommended by Ford.
Doctor Released In Abortion Case
BOSTON — Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin was sentenced to one
year's probation yesterday for his manslaughter conviction
in the death of an aborted fetus and later filed an appeal of
the conviction.
Edelin was immediately invited to return to work at the
hospital where he did the abortion and his attorney said the
36-year-old obstetrician was ready to return.
Edelin's lawyer filed his notice of appeal of the
conviction at Suffolk Superior Court yesterday afternoon.
The attorney said he would base his appeal on the
contentions the conviction went against the weight of the
evidence, and that Edelin was not duly informed that his
medical procedure could be grounds for a manslaughter
charge.
Superior Court Judge James P. McGuire, who could have
sentenced Edelin to up to 20 years in prison, said he would
stay Edelin's sentence pending the outcome of the appeal.
Swiss Franc Rises, Dollar Declines
ZURICH — The Swiss franc rose 68.9 percent in value
against the U.S. dollar between May 1971 and the end of
last month, the Swiss Credit Bank said yesterday. The
dollar's decline against the strong franc was worse than that
of most other major currencies.
The bank, one of Switzerland's three largest, said the
franc had risen an average of 47.2 percent against 20 major
currencies since May 1971.
The Swiss franc rose 74.4 percent against the Italian lira
in the same period and 73.6 percent against the British
pound. It rose only 10 percent against the West German
mark, 34.1 percent against the French franc and 38.4
percent against the Japanese yen.

Court:! Nixon Exceeded Authority
WASHINGTON — Ruling for the first time on an
impoundment issue, the Supreme Court declared yesterday
that former President Richard M. Nixon exceeded his
authority in withholding pollution control funds.
A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) said the ruling would have little immediate impact
on the specific funds in question. But government lawyers
were studying the decision's possible impact on the overall
impoundment issue.
The EPA spokesman said the court ruling would have
little practical effect on the pollution control funds, which
would go mostly for sewer construction, because the funds
can be spent only after they are obligated for specific
projects.
He said EPA has been able to obligate only $4 billion of
the $9 billion that already was available before the court's
ruling. The ruling freed an additional $9 billion.

result of returning the Abu Rudeis oilfields to Egypt as part
of a Sinai agreement.
"Once the tankers are loaded, we don't mind where the
oil goes. It is a purely commercial transaction for us," the
Shah said after he and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
lunched in Zurich, Switzerland.
In London earlier in the day, the secretary sought to
insure that the Soviet Union will not block another interim
Mideast agreement, by promising not to exclude the Soviets
from his efforts.
"I hope the Soviet Union will understand that any step
toward peace is in the interest of everybody," he said. "We
have always asserted that a final settlement will require the
participation and cooperation of the Soviet Union."
The Soviets, feeling left out of present Mideast
negotiations, favor a quick resumption of the multilateral
Geneva peace talks, which the United States fears would
break down into disputes over Palestinian participation.

Kissinger, who met Monday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei A. Gromyko, is thought willing to resume the
Geneva talks after he gets a Sinai accord.
Ford. Demos Clash On Tariff Hike
WASHINGTON — The first step in a Democratic energy
program must be to defeat President Ford's oil tariff hike,
Sen. John O. Pastore (D-R.1.) said yesterday, only hours
after Ford indicated he plans to veto such a move.
Ford had held out both the stick and the carrot to
Congress on his energy program, threatening to veto oil
tariff legislation but offering to "make accommodations on
details."
Pastore made his statement as the Senate Democratic
Policy Committee unanimously approved a substitute for
Ford's energy program. Pastore heads the seven-member
task force which submitted the program to the policy
committee.
While Pastore declined to make details of the program
available, it is known that it includes gradually higher
gasoline taxes, rising as unemployment declines.
The program emphasizes fighting inflation rather than
cutting oil imports. It now goes before Senate committee
chairmen for consideration.
The Senate program contains essentially the same tax
cuts already approved by the House Ways and Means
Committee, which would be more generous at lower
income levels than those recommended by Ford.
Doctor Released In Abortion Case
BOSTON — Dr. Kenneth C. Edelin was sentenced to one
year's probation yesterday for his manslaughter conviction
in the death of an aborted fetus and later filed an appeal of
the conviction.
Edelin was immediately invited to return to work at the
hospital where he did the abortion and his attorney said the
36-year-old obstetrician was ready to return.
Edelin's lawyer filed his notice of appeal of the
conviction at Suffolk Superior Court yesterday afternoon.
The attorney said he would base his appeal on the
contentions the conviction went against the weight of the
evidence, and that Edelin was not duly informed that his
medical procedure could be grounds for a manslaughter
charge.
Superior Court Judge James P. McGuire, who could have
sentenced Edelin to up to 20 years in prison, said he would
stay Edelin's sentence pending the outcome of the appeal.
Swiss Franc Rises, Dollar Declines
ZURICH — The Swiss franc rose 68.9 percent in value
against the U.S. dollar between May 1971 and the end of
last month, the Swiss Credit Bank said yesterday. The
dollar's decline against the strong franc was worse than that
of most other major currencies.
The bank, one of Switzerland's three largest, said the
franc had risen an average of 47.2 percent against 20 major
currencies since May 1971.
The Swiss franc rose 74.4 percent against the Italian lira
in the same period and 73.6 percent against the British
pound. It rose only 10 percent against the West German
mark, 34.1 percent against the French franc and 38.4
percent against the Japanese yen.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today with considerable high cloudiness.
Increasing cloudiness tonight leading to a chance of rain
tomorrow. A little warmer nights. Lows tonight in the low
to mid 40s. Highs both days in the mid 50s to low 60s.
Light winds.
Court:! Nixon Exceeded Authority
WASHINGTON — Ruling for the first time on an
impoundment issue, the Supreme Court declared yesterday
that former President Richard M. Nixon exceeded his
authority in withholding pollution control funds.
A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) said the ruling would have little immediate impact
on the specific funds in question. But government lawyers
were studying the decision's possible impact on the overall
impoundment issue.
The EPA spokesman said the court ruling would have
little practical effect on the pollution control funds, which
would go mostly for sewer construction, because the funds
can be spent only after they are obligated for specific
projects.
He said EPA has been able to obligate only $4 billion of
the $9 billion that already was available before the court's
ruling. The ruling freed an additional $9 billion.
Abortion Legalized In Italy
ROME — Italy's highest court, crossing swords with the
Vatican, ruled yesterday that abortion is legal in this
Roman CaLholic country if pregnancy threatens a woman's
health.
The Vatican reacted in a broadcast, saying: "The ruling
is questionable and of extreme gravity because it backs
killing of the one to be born."
The ruling by the constitutional court, equivalent of the
U.S. Supreme Court, came amid a massive campaign by
feminists and most political parties for a reform of Italy's
Fascist-era abortion law.
Specifically, the court declared unconstitutional Article
516 of the Italian penal code. The law barred abortion
under any circumstance, and set a prison term of two to
five years for women who underwent abortions, as well as
for doctors, nurses and anyone else involved in the
operation.
The law was widely flouted. This nation of 55.6 million
persons has 1.2 million abortions a year, according to U.N.
estimates. Most are performed outside hospitals under
crude medical conditions.
Most of Italy's political parties favor a liberalized
abortion law. But the dominant Christian Democrats
control the votes in parliament, and they along with the
Vatican favor the present law. It was adopted during World
War II to "protect the national stock" as part of dictator
Benito Mussolini's dream to resurrect the Roman Empire.
