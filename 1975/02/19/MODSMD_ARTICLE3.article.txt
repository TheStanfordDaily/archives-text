# Doctor Says He's Innocent
## Hearing Probes Laetrile Case 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Palo Alto physician Stewart M.
Jones, currently under investigation by
the California Board of Medical
Examiners for allegedly administering
Laetrile as a cure for cancer, said
yesterday that the Board doesn't have
a solid case.
"To prove I broke a law, the
prosecutor must prove that I willfully
and falsely represented any substance
as a preventive of cancer. I have not."
Laetrile, a substance made from
apricot pits, is banned from
distribution as a cure for cancer by
state and federal law.
Jones admitted he administered
Laetrile to more than 150 patients last
year as a "vitamin supplement."
Hearings in Jones' case began last
week. Jerome P. Herst, the state's
hearing officer, will report his findings
to the Board, which will decide what
action, if any, it will take. Jones could
lose his medical license as a result of
the charges.

Last Friday, Mrs. Gene Reinhardt,
an undercover agent for the State
Department of Public Health, testified
that she lied to Jones in order to
obtain Laetrile from him.
Paid by the health department to
visit Jones' Palo Alto office, Reinhardt
said, "I was sent there ... to obtain or
acquire Laetrile with the story that I
lost my parents to cancer and that I
was afraid to get cancer myself."
Reinhardt admitted the story was
false.
She said that during her first visit
with him on March 21, 1973, Jones
said he had to take a Laetrile tablet
and asked "would I join him."
Handed Her Pill
She said Jones then took two pills
from an unlabeled box in his desk and
handed her one.
Reinhardt said she pretended to
swallow the pill, holding it in her
mouth until she left the office.
Reinhardt also testified that during
her next visit to Jones' office on April

10, 1973, he offered her more Laetrile
while conducting a physical
examination of her. She said she again
didn't swallow it.
Called It 'Cure'
Reinhardt later said that on each of
her four visits to Jones' office, he told
her that Laetrile would "prevent
cancer."
She said Jones told her he could
not legally give her Laetrile himself.
However, Jones later arranged for her
to meet a San Fernando doctor and a
Dr. Harvey Howard in the
Hollywood-Burbank airport in June
1973, she said.
Reinhardt met Howard at the
airport and purchased 200 Laetrile
tablets for $300, she stated.
'Everything True'
Jones said that "everything
Reinhardt testified to is true," but
claimed the testimony was not
damaging. Jones said, "The only thing
said [at the hearing] that was
damaging" came from Laura
Richardson, another undercover agent
who had also visited Jones' office.
Jones said Richardson accused him
at the hearing of "giving her Laetrile
for her cancer. She's lying."
Earlier Friday, Louis Castro,
deputy state attorney general
prosecuting Jones, said that many
patients died "a very miserable and
painful death because they were
relying on Laetrile."
Compared To Quack
Castro compared Jones to a quack
physician.
"There is one thing that all quacks
have in common: they disregard the
rules of evidence," Castro said,
quoting from Hie Cancer Quacks by
Dr. Charles Cameron, a private
physician. "The scientific method
simply does not exist in the quack
mind."
As evidence that Laetrile works,
Jones said that of 200 patients he
administered the drug to last year,
approximately 150 "were benefitted."
According to Jones, the benefits for
the patient included an improvement
of the sense of well-being,
improvement of appetite, gain in
weight and remission or reduction in
pain.
Last year, Stanford Hospital
officials refused to allow Jones to
continue administering the drug to a
Los Altos woman, Josephine
Bergman, at the hospital.

Examiners for allegedly administering
Laetrile as a cure for cancer, said
yesterday that the Board doesn't have
a solid case.
"To prove I broke a law, the
prosecutor must prove that I willfully
and falsely represented any substance
as a preventive of cancer. I have not."
Laetrile, a substance made from
apricot pits, is banned from
distribution as a cure for cancer by
state and federal law.
Jones admitted he administered
Laetrile to more than 150 patients last
year as a "vitamin supplement."
Hearings in Jones' case began last
week. Jerome P. Herst, the state's
hearing officer, will report his findings
to the Board, which will decide what
action, if any, it will take. Jones could
lose his medical license as a result of
the charges.

Last Friday, Mrs. Gene Reinhardt,
an undercover agent for the State
Department of Public Health, testified
that she lied to Jones in order to
obtain Laetrile from him.
Paid by the health department to
visit Jones' Palo Alto office, Reinhardt
said, "I was sent there ... to obtain or
acquire Laetrile with the story that I
lost my parents to cancer and that I
was afraid to get cancer myself."
Reinhardt admitted the story was
false.
She said that during her first visit
with him on March 21, 1973, Jones
said he had to take a Laetrile tablet
and asked "would I join him."
Handed Her Pill
She said Jones then took two pills
from an unlabeled box in his desk and
handed her one.
Reinhardt said she pretended to
swallow the pill, holding it in her
mouth until she left the office.
Reinhardt also testified that during
her next visit to Jones' office on April

10, 1973, he offered her more Laetrile
while conducting a physical
examination of her. She said she again
didn't swallow it.
Called It 'Cure'
Reinhardt later said that on each of
her four visits to Jones' office, he told
her that Laetrile would "prevent
cancer."
She said Jones told her he could
not legally give her Laetrile himself.
However, Jones later arranged for her
to meet a San Fernando doctor and a
Dr. Harvey Howard in the
Hollywood-Burbank airport in June
1973, she said.
Reinhardt met Howard at the
airport and purchased 200 Laetrile
tablets for $300, she stated.
'Everything True'
Jones said that "everything
Reinhardt testified to is true," but
claimed the testimony was not
damaging. Jones said, "The only thing
said [at the hearing] that was
damaging" came from Laura
Richardson, another undercover agent
who had also visited Jones' office.
Jones said Richardson accused him
at the hearing of "giving her Laetrile
for her cancer. She's lying."
Earlier Friday, Louis Castro,
deputy state attorney general
prosecuting Jones, said that many
patients died "a very miserable and
painful death because they were
relying on Laetrile."
Compared To Quack
Castro compared Jones to a quack
physician.
"There is one thing that all quacks
have in common: they disregard the
rules of evidence," Castro said,
quoting from Hie Cancer Quacks by
Dr. Charles Cameron, a private
physician. "The scientific method
simply does not exist in the quack
mind."
As evidence that Laetrile works,
Jones said that of 200 patients he
administered the drug to last year,
approximately 150 "were benefitted."
According to Jones, the benefits for
the patient included an improvement
of the sense of well-being,
improvement of appetite, gain in
weight and remission or reduction in
pain.
Last year, Stanford Hospital
officials refused to allow Jones to
continue administering the drug to a
Los Altos woman, Josephine
Bergman, at the hospital.
