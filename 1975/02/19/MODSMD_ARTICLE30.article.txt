# Don't Miss Out On Fisherman's Wharf, Japanese Tea Garden
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
From a walk across the Golden
Gate Bridge to watching a sunset
off the sea cliffs of Pacifica, San
Francisco has something for every
person. For the newcomer, the
City offers countless nooks and
crannies.
However, a few major sites
must be seen at least once. Like
the Golden Gate Bridge and the
fog, they are what San Francisco
is known for.
Fisherman's Wharf is perhaps
as fine an introduction to San
Francisco as any other place. With
its many restaurants, shops,
galleries, wax museums and fresh
fish stands, the Wharf is an avid
tourist attraction. A word of
caution: it is also a tourist "trap."
Ghirardelli Square, a complex
of buildings that once was a
chocolate factory, now houses
many good but extremely
expensive restaurants. Of these,
perhaps the least expensive and
perhaps the most enjoyable is the
Chocolate Factory, an ice cream
shop located in the southeastern

corner of the square.
The Cannery, two blocks east, is
another complex of restaurants,
galleries and shops. Again
expensive. Called "The Walled
City of San Francisco," the brick
buildings, like Qiirardelli, overlook
the Bay.
Perhaps most worthwhile of
the attractions at Ghirardelli, the
Cannery and other parts of the
Wharf are the street musicians.
For a quarter thrown into a
strategically placed hat or
instrument case, the visitor can
listen to classical, folk or rock
music played on guitars, violins,
violas, flutes and drums.
The music is usually good on
weekends. Beware of the Wharf
on a rainy day, however. Bad
weather scares most of the
musical groups away.
Near the Cannery on Beach
and Hyde is perhaps the best
place to catch a cable car. The
cars turn around there at the
gazebo, the site of many Big
Game concerts.
From the Wharf, up and down

steep Hyde Street, to Powell and
Grant Streets, the cable car ride is
a scenic one; looking back
towards the Wharf on a clear day
is a picture postcard view. When
the car crosses the Broadway
tunnel, a quick glimpse to the left
reveals the flashing lights of
Broadway.
Chinatown is just two blocks
down the hill if the rider gets off
the cable car at Powell and Grant.
Like sections of any city,
Chinatown has its slums and its
cheap novelty shops.
The streets are uarrow and a
claustrophobic person would be
wise to avoid the place. However,
if you can stand the compactness
of everything, Chinatown has
some of the best relatively
inexpensive Chinese restaurants in
the nation.
Back at the intersection of
Powell and Grant, one can catch a
cable car marked "Hyde and
Beach" back to the Wharf, or take
a car marked "Bay and Taylor" to
another terminal located about
four blocks east of the Cannery.

From the Bay and Taylor
terminal, it's just a one-block walk
north to the Cost Plus Coffees
Teas Et Cetera Store where even
the poorest traveler can get a cup
of coffee because it's free. The
store, which sells more than 10
different teas and coffees and all
kinds of coffee accessories,
usually has two different "coffees
of the day" brewing.
The Ferry Building is just east
of the Wharf along with more
than 40 piers on this shore of San
Francisco Bay. From the Ferry
Building one can catch a ferry to
Sausalito, a small town of
boutiques and galleries nestled in
the hills just across the Bay.
One-way fare for the
30-minute voyage (not enough
time for even the weakest
landlubber to get seasick) is 75
cents. The trip is the best way to
see the Bay itself.
The ferry cruises right by
Alcatraz, a lone island where
stands a once notorious federal
prison. From the ferry, one can
get a good look at the prison walls
and see much of the graffiti left
by the Indians who occupied the
prison in protest during the late
'60s.
"Freedom, Peace On Earth"
reads one message left on a prison
factory smokestack, while right
underneath on the side of a
building are left the state's words,
"Warning Keep Off."
For those who wish to get a
closer look at Alcatraz, there are
harbor excursions leaving from
Pier 41 1 /2. Resrvations, however,
must be made at least a day in
advance.

Back on the mainland, one
must get to the well-known
museums.
The California Palace of the
Legion of Honor crowns the hill
top in Lincoln Park in the western
stretches of San Francisco. The
museum is best known for its
Rodin sculptures, the Spreckels
Collection and three centuries
(16thâ€”19th) of French painting.
The museum has more than 80
pieces of Auguste Rodin,
including 40 bronzes and over 30
plasters. It is open 10 to 5 daily.
The Exploratorium, at 3601

Lyons St., offers more than 300
exhibits which the visitor can
smell, feel, speak into, watch and
hear.
For example, a musical visitor
can sing into a microphone and
watch his voice patterns be
translated onto a television screen,
or he can hold a glass filter up to
his eye and decipher messages
written in various color crayons.
Red-jacketed men and women
on the museum floor are the
Exploratorium's answer to
traditional museum guides. In
addition to conducting tours

through the museum, they are
also available to answer questions.
It's all free.
Golden Gate Park on a good
weather day is a nature lover's
paradise: trees, birds, squirrels,
flowers, lakes, and paths through
lush green foliage. But the park
offers a wide variety of other
activities.
Interested in going sailing?
Stow Lake has a dock where
the avid seaman can rent a small
sailboat by the hour.
The Japanese Tea Garden is an
oasis of beauty and grace, enjoyed

year-round by thousands of
visitors. Trestle bridges, pagodas,
bionoki Cyprus trees, dwarf trees,
blackbirds and squirrels can all be
found in the garden amidst the
eucalyptus trees. Be sure to visit
the garden in March and April
when the cherry trees blossom.
Hidden among the lagoons and
trees is the Tea House where green
tea imported from Japan and
jasmine tea from Taiwan are
served along with almond and
sesame cookies and rice crackers.
The M.H. de Young Memorial
Museum, a permanent collection
of art from ancient Egypt to
20th century America, is located
next to the Tea Garden.
The Avery Brundage Collection
of Asian Art represents over 95
percent of the museum's holdings,
including 8000 sculptures,
architectural elements, paintings,
bronzes, ceramics ai<d a fantasiic
jade collection.
The California Academy of
Sciences consisting of the
Aquarium, Planetarium and Ha'l
of Sciences, is across from the de
Young. More than 1000
specimens of mammals, birds,
reptiles, plants and insects are
included in the Hall.
The Aquarium offers perhaps
the widest variety of live fish on
the West Coast, including a
porpoise and a giant turtle.
The Morrison Planetarium with
its high dome is a great place to
learn about the stars and their
formations.
The Conservatory, which is
open daily from 8 to 4:20,
shelters red, white, purple and
orange orchids in the west wing.

violas, flutes and drums.
The music is usually good on
weekends. Beware of the Wharf
on a rainy day, however. Bad
weather scares most of the
musical groups away.
Near the Cannery on Beach
and Hyde is perhaps the best
place to catch a cable car. The
cars turn around there at the
gazebo, the site of many Big
Game concerts.
From the Wharf, up and down

steep Hyde Street, to Powell and
Grant Streets, the cable car ride is
a scenic one; looking back
towards the Wharf on a clear day
is a picture postcard view. When
the car crosses the Broadway
tunnel, a quick glimpse to the left
reveals the flashing lights of
Broadway.
Chinatown is just two blocks
down the hill if the rider gets off
the cable car at Powell and Grant.
Like sections of any city,
Chinatown has its slums and its
cheap novelty shops.
The streets are uarrow and a
claustrophobic person would be
wise to avoid the place. However,
if you can stand the compactness
of everything, Chinatown has
some of the best relatively
inexpensive Chinese restaurants in
the nation.
Back at the intersection of
Powell and Grant, one can catch a
cable car marked "Hyde and
Beach" back to the Wharf, or take
a car marked "Bay and Taylor" to
another terminal located about
four blocks east of the Cannery.

From the Bay and Taylor
terminal, it's just a one-block walk
north to the Cost Plus Coffees
Teas Et Cetera Store where even
the poorest traveler can get a cup
of coffee because it's free. The
store, which sells more than 10
different teas and coffees and all
kinds of coffee accessories,
usually has two different "coffees
of the day" brewing.
The Ferry Building is just east
of the Wharf along with more
than 40 piers on this shore of San
Francisco Bay. From the Ferry
Building one can catch a ferry to
Sausalito, a small town of
boutiques and galleries nestled in
the hills just across the Bay.
One-way fare for the
30-minute voyage (not enough
time for even the weakest
landlubber to get seasick) is 75
cents. The trip is the best way to
see the Bay itself.
The ferry cruises right by
Alcatraz, a lone island where
stands a once notorious federal
prison. From the ferry, one can
get a good look at the prison walls
and see much of the graffiti left
by the Indians who occupied the
prison in protest during the late
'60s.
"Freedom, Peace On Earth"
reads one message left on a prison
factory smokestack, while right
underneath on the side of a
building are left the state's words,
"Warning Keep Off."
For those who wish to get a
closer look at Alcatraz, there are
harbor excursions leaving from
Pier 41 1 /2. Resrvations, however,
must be made at least a day in
advance.

Back on the mainland, one
must get to the well-known
museums.
The California Palace of the
Legion of Honor crowns the hill
top in Lincoln Park in the western
stretches of San Francisco. The
museum is best known for its
Rodin sculptures, the Spreckels
Collection and three centuries
(16thâ€”19th) of French painting.
The museum has more than 80
pieces of Auguste Rodin,
including 40 bronzes and over 30
plasters. It is open 10 to 5 daily.
The Exploratorium, at 3601

Lyons St., offers more than 300
exhibits which the visitor can
smell, feel, speak into, watch and
hear.
For example, a musical visitor
can sing into a microphone and
watch his voice patterns be
translated onto a television screen,
or he can hold a glass filter up to
his eye and decipher messages
written in various color crayons.
Red-jacketed men and women
on the museum floor are the
Exploratorium's answer to
traditional museum guides. In
addition to conducting tours

through the museum, they are
also available to answer questions.
It's all free.
Golden Gate Park on a good
weather day is a nature lover's
paradise: trees, birds, squirrels,
flowers, lakes, and paths through
lush green foliage. But the park
offers a wide variety of other
activities.
Interested in going sailing?
Stow Lake has a dock where
the avid seaman can rent a small
sailboat by the hour.
The Japanese Tea Garden is an
oasis of beauty and grace, enjoyed

year-round by thousands of
visitors. Trestle bridges, pagodas,
bionoki Cyprus trees, dwarf trees,
blackbirds and squirrels can all be
found in the garden amidst the
eucalyptus trees. Be sure to visit
the garden in March and April
when the cherry trees blossom.
Hidden among the lagoons and
trees is the Tea House where green
tea imported from Japan and
jasmine tea from Taiwan are
served along with almond and
sesame cookies and rice crackers.
The M.H. de Young Memorial
Museum, a permanent collection
of art from ancient Egypt to
20th century America, is located
next to the Tea Garden.
The Avery Brundage Collection
of Asian Art represents over 95
percent of the museum's holdings,
including 8000 sculptures,
architectural elements, paintings,
bronzes, ceramics ai<d a fantasiic
jade collection.
The California Academy of
Sciences consisting of the
Aquarium, Planetarium and Ha'l
of Sciences, is across from the de
Young. More than 1000
specimens of mammals, birds,
reptiles, plants and insects are
included in the Hall.
The Aquarium offers perhaps
the widest variety of live fish on
the West Coast, including a
porpoise and a giant turtle.
The Morrison Planetarium with
its high dome is a great place to
learn about the stars and their
formations.
The Conservatory, which is
open daily from 8 to 4:20,
shelters red, white, purple and
orange orchids in the west wing.





From a walk across the Golden
Gate Bridge to watching a sunset
off the sea cliffs of Pacifica, San
Francisco has something for every
person. For the newcomer, the
City offers countless nooks and
crannies.
However, a few major sites
must be seen at least once. Like
the Golden Gate Bridge and the
fog, they are what San Francisco
is known for.
Fisherman's Wharf is perhaps
as fine an introduction to San
Francisco as any other place. With
its many restaurants, shops,
galleries, wax museums and fresh
fish stands, the Wharf is an avid
tourist attraction. A word of
caution: it is also a tourist "trap."
Ghirardelli Square, a complex
of buildings that once was a
chocolate factory, now houses
many good but extremely
expensive restaurants. Of these,
perhaps the least expensive and
perhaps the most enjoyable is the
Chocolate Factory, an ice cream
shop located in the southeastern

corner of the square.
The Cannery, two blocks east, is
another complex of restaurants,
galleries and shops. Again
expensive. Called "The Walled
City of San Francisco," the brick
buildings, like Qiirardelli, overlook
the Bay.
Perhaps most worthwhile of
the attractions at Ghirardelli, the
Cannery and other parts of the
Wharf are the street musicians.
For a quarter thrown into a
strategically placed hat or
instrument case, the visitor can
listen to classical, folk or rock
music played on guitars, violins,
violas, flutes and drums.
The music is usually good on
weekends. Beware of the Wharf
on a rainy day, however. Bad

the poorest traveler can get a cup
of coffee because it's free. The
store, which sells more than 10
different teas and coffees and all
kinds of coffee accessories,
usually has two different "coffees
of the day" brewing.
The Ferry Building is just east
of the Wharf along with more
than 40 piers on this shore of San
Francisco Bay. From the Ferry
Building one can catch a ferry to
Sausalito, a small town of
boutiques and galleries nestled in
the hills just across the Bay.
One-way fare for the
30-minute voyage (not enough
time for even the weakest
landlubber to get seasick) is 75
cents. The trip is the best way to
see the Bay itself.
The ferry cruises right by
Alcatraz, a lone island where
stands a once notorious federal
prison. From the ferry, one can
get a good look at the prison walls
and see much of the graffiti left
by the Indians who occupied the
prison in protest during the late
'60s.
"Freedom, Peace On Earth"
reads one message left on a prison
factory smokestack, while right
underneath on the side of a
building are left the state's words,
"Warning Keep Off."
For those who wish to get a
closer look at Alcatraz, there are
harbor excursions leaving from
Pier 41 1 /2. Resrvations, however,
must be made at least a day in
advance.

Back on the mainland, one
must get to the well-known
museums.
The California Palace of the
Legion of Honor crowns the hill
top in Lincoln Park in the western
stretches of San Francisco. The
museum is best known for its
Rodin sculptures, the Spreckels
Collection and three centuries
(16thâ€”19th) of French painting.
The museum has more than 80
pieces of Auguste Rodin,
including 40 bronzes and over 30
plasters. It is open 10 to 5 daily.

Lyons St., offers more than 300
exhibits which the visitor can
smell, feel, speak into, watch and
hear.
For example, a musical visitor
can sing into a microphone and
watch his voice patterns be
translated onto a television screen,
or he can hold a glass filter up to
his eye and decipher messages
written in various color crayons.
Red-jacketed men and women
on the museum floor are the
Exploratorium's answer to
traditional museum guides. In
addition to conducting tours

through the museum, they are
also available to answer questions.
It's all free.
Golden Gate Park on a good
weather day is a nature lover's
paradise: trees, birds, squirrels,
flowers, lakes, and paths through
lush green foliage. But the park
offers a wide variety of other
activities.
Interested in going sailing?
Stow Lake has a dock where
the avid seaman can rent a small
sailboat by the hour.
The Japanese Tea Garden is an
oasis of beauty and grace, enjoyed

year-round by thousands of
visitors. Trestle bridges, pagodas,
bionoki Cyprus trees, dwarf trees,
blackbirds and squirrels can all be
found in the garden amidst the
eucalyptus trees. Be sure to visit
the garden in March and April
when the cherry trees blossom.
Hidden among the lagoons and
trees is the Tea House where green
tea imported from Japan and
jasmine tea from Taiwan are
served along with almond and
sesame cookies and rice crackers.
The M.H. de Young Memorial
Museum, a permanent collection
of art from ancient Egypt to
20th century America, is located
next to the Tea Garden.
The Avery Brundage Collection
of Asian Art represents over 95
percent of the museum's holdings,
including 8000 sculptures,
architectural elements, paintings,
bronzes, ceramics ai<d a fantasiic
jade collection.
The California Academy of
Sciences consisting of the
Aquarium, Planetarium and Ha'l
of Sciences, is across from the de
Young. More than 1000
specimens of mammals, birds,
reptiles, plants and insects are
included in the Hall.
The Aquarium offers perhaps
the widest variety of live fish on
the West Coast, including a
porpoise and a giant turtle.
The Morrison Planetarium with
its high dome is a great place to
learn about the stars and their
formations.
The Conservatory, which is
open daily from 8 to 4:20,
shelters red, white, purple and
orange orchids in the west wing.





From a walk across the Golden
Gate Bridge to watching a sunset
off the sea cliffs of Pacifica, San
Francisco has something for every
person. For the newcomer, the
City offers countless nooks and
crannies.
However, a few major sites
must be seen at least once. Like
the Golden Gate Bridge and the
fog, they are what San Francisco
is known for.
Fisherman's Wharf is perhaps
as fine an introduction to San
Francisco as any other place. With
its many restaurants, shops,
galleries, wax museums and fresh
fish stands, the Wharf is an avid
tourist attraction. A word of
caution: it is also a tourist "trap."
Ghirardelli Square, a complex
of buildings that once was a
chocolate factory, now houses
many good but extremely
expensive restaurants. Of these,
perhaps the least expensive and
perhaps the most enjoyable is the
Chocolate Factory, an ice cream
shop located in the southeastern

corner of the square.
The Cannery, two blocks east, is
another complex of restaurants,
galleries and shops. Again
expensive. Called "The Walled
City of San Francisco," the brick
buildings, like Qiirardelli, overlook
the Bay.
Perhaps most worthwhile of
the attractions at Ghirardelli, the
Cannery and other parts of the
Wharf are the street musicians.
For a quarter thrown into a
strategically placed hat or
instrument case, the visitor can
listen to classical, folk or rock
music played on guitars, violins,
violas, flutes and drums.
The music is usually good on
weekends. Beware of the Wharf
on a rainy day, however. Bad
weather scares most of the
musical groups away.
Near the Cannery on Beach
and Hyde is perhaps the best
place to catch a cable car. The
cars turn around there at the
gazebo, the site of many Big
Game concerts.
From the Wharf, up and down

steep Hyde Street, to Powell and
Grant Streets, the cable car ride is
a scenic one; looking back
towards the Wharf on a clear day
is a picture postcard view. When
the car crosses the Broadway
tunnel, a quick glimpse to the left
reveals the flashing lights of
Broadway.
Chinatown is just two blocks
down the hill if the rider gets off
the cable car at Powell and Grant.
Like sections of any city,
Chinatown has its slums and its
cheap novelty shops.
The streets are uarrow and a
claustrophobic person would be
wise to avoid the place. However,
if you can stand the compactness
of everything, Chinatown has
some of the best relatively
inexpensive Chinese restaurants in
the nation.
Back at the intersection of
Powell and Grant, one can catch a
cable car marked "Hyde and
Beach" back to the Wharf, or take
a car marked "Bay and Taylor" to
another terminal located about
four blocks east of the Cannery.

From the Bay and Taylor
terminal, it's just a one-block walk
north to the Cost Plus Coffees
Teas Et Cetera Store where even
the poorest traveler can get a cup
of coffee because it's free. The

museums.
The California Palace of the
Legion of Honor crowns the hill
top in Lincoln Park in the western
stretches of San Francisco. The
museum is best known for its
Rodin sculptures, the Spreckels
Collection and three centuries
(16thâ€”19th) of French painting.
The museum has more than 80
pieces of Auguste Rodin,
including 40 bronzes and over 30
plasters. It is open 10 to 5 daily.

Lyons St., offers more than 300
exhibits which the visitor can
smell, feel, speak into, watch and
hear.
For example, a musical visitor
can sing into a microphone and
watch his voice patterns be
translated onto a television screen,
or he can hold a glass filter up to
his eye and decipher messages
written in various color crayons.
Red-jacketed men and women
on the museum floor are the
Exploratorium's answer to
traditional museum guides. In
addition to conducting tours

through the museum, they are
also available to answer questions.
It's all free.
Golden Gate Park on a good
weather day is a nature lover's
paradise: trees, birds, squirrels,
flowers, lakes, and paths through
lush green foliage. But the park
offers a wide variety of other
activities.
Interested in going sailing?
Stow Lake has a dock where
the avid seaman can rent a small
sailboat by the hour.
The Japanese Tea Garden is an
oasis of beauty and grace, enjoyed

year-round by thousands of
visitors. Trestle bridges, pagodas,
bionoki Cyprus trees, dwarf trees,
blackbirds and squirrels can all be
found in the garden amidst the
eucalyptus trees. Be sure to visit
the garden in March and April
when the cherry trees blossom.
Hidden among the lagoons and
trees is the Tea House where green
tea imported from Japan and
jasmine tea from Taiwan are
served along with almond and
sesame cookies and rice crackers.
The M.H. de Young Memorial
Museum, a permanent collection
of art from ancient Egypt to
20th century America, is located
next to the Tea Garden.
The Avery Brundage Collection
of Asian Art represents over 95
percent of the museum's holdings,
including 8000 sculptures,
architectural elements, paintings,
bronzes, ceramics ai<d a fantasiic
jade collection.
The California Academy of
Sciences consisting of the
Aquarium, Planetarium and Ha'l
of Sciences, is across from the de
Young. More than 1000
specimens of mammals, birds,
reptiles, plants and insects are
included in the Hall.
The Aquarium offers perhaps
the widest variety of live fish on
the West Coast, including a
porpoise and a giant turtle.
The Morrison Planetarium with
its high dome is a great place to
learn about the stars and their
formations.
The Conservatory, which is
open daily from 8 to 4:20,
shelters red, white, purple and
orange orchids in the west wing.





From a walk across the Golden
Gate Bridge to watching a sunset
off the sea cliffs of Pacifica, San
Francisco has something for every
person. For the newcomer, the
City offers countless nooks and
crannies.
However, a few major sites
must be seen at least once. Like
the Golden Gate Bridge and the
fog, they are what San Francisco
is known for.
Fisherman's Wharf is perhaps
as fine an introduction to San
Francisco as any other place. With
its many restaurants, shops,
galleries, wax museums and fresh
fish stands, the Wharf is an avid
tourist attraction. A word of
caution: it is also a tourist "trap."
Ghirardelli Square, a complex
of buildings that once was a
chocolate factory, now houses
many good but extremely
expensive restaurants. Of these,
perhaps the least expensive and
perhaps the most enjoyable is the
Chocolate Factory, an ice cream
shop located in the southeastern

corner of the square.
The Cannery, two blocks east, is
another complex of restaurants,
galleries and shops. Again
expensive. Called "The Walled
City of San Francisco," the brick
buildings, like Qiirardelli, overlook
the Bay.
Perhaps most worthwhile of
the attractions at Ghirardelli, the
Cannery and other parts of the
Wharf are the street musicians.
For a quarter thrown into a
strategically placed hat or
instrument case, the visitor can
listen to classical, folk or rock
music played on guitars, violins,
violas, flutes and drums.
The music is usually good on
weekends. Beware of the Wharf
on a rainy day, however. Bad
weather scares most of the
musical groups away.
Near the Cannery on Beach
and Hyde is perhaps the best
place to catch a cable car. The
cars turn around there at the
gazebo, the site of many Big
Game concerts.
From the Wharf, up and down

steep Hyde Street, to Powell and
Grant Streets, the cable car ride is
a scenic one; looking back
towards the Wharf on a clear day
is a picture postcard view. When
the car crosses the Broadway
tunnel, a quick glimpse to the left
reveals the flashing lights of
Broadway.
Chinatown is just two blocks
down the hill if the rider gets off
the cable car at Powell and Grant.
Like sections of any city,
Chinatown has its slums and its
cheap novelty shops.
The streets are uarrow and a
claustrophobic person would be
wise to avoid the place. However,
if you can stand the compactness
of everything, Chinatown has
some of the best relatively
inexpensive Chinese restaurants in
the nation.
Back at the intersection of
Powell and Grant, one can catch a
cable car marked "Hyde and
Beach" back to the Wharf, or take
a car marked "Bay and Taylor" to
another terminal located about
four blocks east of the Cannery.

From the Bay and Taylor
terminal, it's just a one-block walk
north to the Cost Plus Coffees
Teas Et Cetera Store where even
the poorest traveler can get a cup
of coffee because it's free. The
store, which sells more than 10
different teas and coffees and all
kinds of coffee accessories,
usually has two different "coffees
of the day" brewing.
The Ferry Building is just east
of the Wharf along with more
than 40 piers on this shore of San
Francisco Bay. From the Ferry
Building one can catch a ferry to
Sausalito, a small town of
boutiques and galleries nestled in
the hills just across the Bay.
One-way fare for the
30-minute voyage (not enough
time for even the weakest
landlubber to get seasick) is 75
cents. The trip is the best way to
see the Bay itself.
The ferry cruises right by
Alcatraz, a lone island where
stands a once notorious federal
prison. From the ferry, one can
get a good look at the prison walls
and see much of the graffiti left
by the Indians who occupied the
prison in protest during the late
'60s.
"Freedom, Peace On Earth"
reads one message left on a prison
factory smokestack, while right
underneath on the side of a
building are left the state's words,
"Warning Keep Off."
For those who wish to get a
closer look at Alcatraz, there are
harbor excursions leaving from
Pier 41 1 /2. Resrvations, however,
must be made at least a day in
advance.
