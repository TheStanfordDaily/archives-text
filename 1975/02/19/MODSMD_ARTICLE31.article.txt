# Investigate Boutiques, Outside Elevators, Sea Cliffs

Still can't think of anything to do in the City?
Consider walking across the Golden Gate
Bridge. People whoVe done it say it's totally
invigorating particularly when the fog's rolling in
or 40-mile winds are rocking the structure.
An off-beat activity at night is to go outdoor
elevator hopping. On your way up, you get a
fantastic view of the City, and the more elevators
you hit, the more angles you get to see.
The Fairmont, St. Francis and Hyatt Union
Square Hotels are the ones to catch. Also, for a
different perspective on things, there's the Hyatt
Regency Hotel elevator for a view of the hotel's
interior on your ascent.
Ever consider San Francisco for a walk in
nature? The cliff trail around Land's End —
beginning at Eagle Beach on the north shore of
the City — zigzags for a mile and a half along
perilous cliffs, Seal Rock, Bird Rock and the
Cliff House.
Bird's Eye View
If it's not too foggy, from the cliffs you can
see the green hills of Marin across the Bay and
the boats sailing under the Golden Gate Bridge.
But be sure and keep one eye on where you're

walking. One sign warns: "CAUTION! Cliff and
surf area extremely dangerous. People have been
swept from the rocks and drowned."
For less adventurous types, there's a much
safer walk along Kearny Avenue. Though
camera and photography experts say the only
place to buy photographic equipment is on
"Camera Ave." — 32nd Street in New York —
they add that the next best place in the Bay Area
is Kearny.
One devotee explains, "This one street's gotta
million camera stores and they're all right next
to each other within a one-block radius." He
adds, "It's fun to go into these places — you've
never seen so much camera stuff in your life."
Famous Patrons
And rumor has it that Ansel Adams buys all
of his equipment at Adolph Gasser Inc. (on
nearby Second Avenue).
San Francisco is a kaleidoscope of wonderful
stores for the compulsive shopper with a fat
wallet. Gumps, on Post Street off Union Square,
is a good place to begin. Gumps is famous for its
Steuben glass, Limoges china, designer fashions,
lithographs, antique furniture and most
important of all — JADE.

Next to Gumps, is a Jaegar International
boutique for fabulous sportswear, and Courreges
on nearby Maiden Lane is one of the few
American outlets for this Paris designer's clothes.
Tennis Lady, also on Maiden Lane, is one of
the few tennis clothing stores to have everything
imaginable from pink underwear to gingham
tennis racquet covers.
Gucci Goddies
For authentic, mouth-watering Italian leather
goods, don't miss the Gucci boutique inside
Joseph Magnin's — which is not to be confused
with I. Magnin's. In I. Magnin's, you'll find
everything from I. Magnin's own scented soap, to
Hermes scarfs, Dior bags and Halston miniskirts.
Union Street is another shopper's haven on the
other side of town — but it's worth going out of
your way for. Antique shops and with-it
boutiques line the street for what seems like
miles.
If you think rain has spoiled your trip to the
City — don't let it. A spokesman at the San
Francisco Zoological Gardens (near San
Francisco State University) says,"The gorilla
family often comes out to play in the rain."
