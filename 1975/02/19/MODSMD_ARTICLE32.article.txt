# Night Life Mixes Class With Best Bay Boogie
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Another Saturday night, as
some scruffy balladeer once
commented, and you're through
with booking. .. 0.K., you're not
through, but you're fed up, and
some fool down the hall yells the
immortal, "Hey, yeah, we could
all go to the City."
If your interest is cultural, the
list of theatrical events, dance
companies, and classical music
renderings is bound to turn up
something you will enjoy, San
Francisco being a Mecca for many
with artistic aspirations.
But suppose you're'only 19
and you want to rock out?
If you're underage without a
fake 1.D., you might as well
accept the inevitability of being
turned away from some of the
best places.
Time heals all wounds, but
there are places you can go to
hear the music that made the City
famous.
There's Always Winterland
First and foremost, there is
Winterland. Small clubs come and
go, but Bill Graham still has San
Francisco's monopoly on rock 'n'
roll. There isn't any artist of
international or national standing
that hasn't played at Graham's ice
rink, or the more spacious Cow
Palace.
Ticket prices have soared to
$5.50 in advance at Bay Area

Seating Service (BASS) outlets, or
$6 at the door starting at 6 p.m.
the evening of a concert. The best
advice is don't depend on tickets
at the door, and purchase tickets
for major concerts as soon as
possible after they're announced.
Don't overlook the "Sounds of
the City" series of $2.50 concerts
at Winterland which are now
being given on Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday nights rather than last
year's Tuesday slot. Even though
these shows are cheap, the new
musical talent featured —
Kingfish, Earthquake, Journey for
example — may well lead rock
music through the rest of the 70s.
For those with more mellow
tastes, Keystone Komer at 750
Vallejo offers great jazz artists in
week or two-week engagements,
Tuesday through Sunday. The
club is small, so buy in advance.
Stand-Up Comedy
The Boarding House, 960
Bush, features fine music or
occasional stand-up comedy from
talents such as Mary Travers, The
Pointer Sisters, David Steinberg
and other less-known, equally
talented performers.
Trends at The Boarding House
have been toward classier dinner
club acts and away from hard
rock, but occasionally an
aberration such as Dr. Hook and
the Medicine Show enlivens the
