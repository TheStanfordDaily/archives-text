# Night Life Mixes Class With Best Bay Boogie
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
Another Saturday night, as
some scruffy balladeer once
commented, and you're through
with booking. .. 0.K., you're not
through, but you're fed up, and
some fool down the hall yells the
immortal, "Hey, yeah, we could
all go to the City."
If your interest is cultural, the
list of theatrical events, dance
companies, and classical music
renderings is bound to turn up
something you will enjoy, San
Francisco being a Mecca for many
with artistic aspirations.
But suppose you're'only 19
and you want to rock out?
If you're underage without a
fake 1.D., you might as well
accept the inevitability of being
turned away from some of the
best places.
Time heals all wounds, but
there are places you can go to
hear the music that made the City
famous.
There's Always Winterland
First and foremost, there is
Winterland. Small clubs come and
go, but Bill Graham still has San
Francisco's monopoly on rock 'n'
roll. There isn't any artist of
international or national standing
that hasn't played at Graham's ice
rink, or the more spacious Cow
Palace.
Ticket prices have soared to
$5.50 in advance at Bay Area

Seating Service (BASS) outlets, or
$6 at the door starting at 6 p.m.
the evening of a concert. The best
advice is don't depend on tickets
at the door, and purchase tickets
for major concerts as soon as
possible after they're announced.
Don't overlook the "Sounds of
the City" series of $2.50 concerts
at Winterland which are now
being given on Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday nights rather than last
year's Tuesday slot. Even though
these shows are cheap, the new
musical talent featured —
Kingfish, Earthquake, Journey for
example — may well lead rock
music through the rest of the 70s.
For those with more mellow
tastes, Keystone Komer at 750
Vallejo offers great jazz artists in
week or two-week engagements,
Tuesday through Sunday. The
club is small, so buy in advance.
Stand-Up Comedy
The Boarding House, 960
Bush, features fine music or
occasional stand-up comedy from
talents such as Mary Travers, The
Pointer Sisters, David Steinberg
and other less-known, equally
talented performers.
Trends at The Boarding House
have been toward classier dinner
club acts and away from hard
rock, but occasionally an
aberration such as Dr. Hook and
the Medicine Show enlivens the

line-up.
If dancing is your thing, you
can't depend on any of the three
establishments above. Your best
bets are Peppermint Tree at 660
Broadway and Yellow Brick Road
at 2215 Powell.
Peppermint Tree features
soul/raza rock suitable for dancing
every night from 8:30 p.m.,
including bands such as Azteca

and Dakila. Yellow Brick Road
offers mainstream white boogie
music such as Ana and the
A-Train, Cisum, Nimbus, and Rick
Stevens'new band Brass Horizon.
Back on the sittin' and listenin'
side of things. The Great
American Music Hall offers good
music but an erratic policy on
admitting minors.
Located at 859 O'Farrell, the
Great American has a nasty habit
of pasting up a "no minors" sign
when they expect a heavy turnout
— most recently for the
appearance of The Legion Of
Mary featuring Jerry Garcia and
Merl Saunders.
A Final warning about the
Great American — when they
card, they really card.

The Orphanage at 807
Montgomery is the poshest rock
music club in town, catering to
over-21 types exclusively.
Unfortunately, according to
Chronicle columnist Joel Selvin,
The Orphanage is also losing
money hand over Fist. It seems
that despite excellent local talent
being booked, people can't afford
the complete dining-dancing scene
in these inflationary times.
Still, The Orphanage is worth a
look for those into a complete
dance scene sans teeny boppers.
Finally on the music scene, El
Matador at 492 Broadway is a
small club featuring excellent jazz
and other single artist acts such as
guitarist Gabor Szabo — a quiet
club with the emphasis on serious
music.

On the theater scene, San
Francisco is dominated winter and
spring by the always-excellent
American Conservatory Theatre.
Performing at the Geary Theatre
(Geary and Mason Streets) and
the Marines' Memorial Theatre
(Sutter and Mason Streets),
student rush tickets for weeknight
performances, are almost always
available 20 minutes before
curtain time.
San Francisco also has an
abundance of excellent long-run
small theater productions, led by
the six-year-old One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest at the Little
Fox Theatre, 533 Pacific.
One Flew is finally in its last
weeks, but has been universally
acclaimed as the best show in
town since its opening. If you've

missed it till now, don't miss it
forever.
Evolution of the Blues at the
On Broadway Theatre offers an
entertaining production by local
jazzman Jon Hendricks which,
while long on music, is claimed by
some critics to be short on
historical accuracy.
Recommended for a heavy
evening rivaling Cuckoos Nest:
Adam King, Fridays, Saturdays
and Sundays at the Everyman
Theatre, 24th and Mission. This
black comedy-drama is shaking up
audiences by using theatre to
discuss the possible conspiracies
behind the John F. Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy, and Martin
Luther King assassinations. If you
have time for thinking afterwards,
this production is a must.

Bush, features fine music or
occasional stand-up comedy from
talents such as Mary Travers, The
Pointer Sisters, David Steinberg
and other less-known, equally
talented performers.
Trends at The Boarding House

line-up.
If dancing is your thing, you
can't depend on any of the three
establishments above. Your best
bets are Peppermint Tree at 660
Broadway and Yellow Brick Road
at 2215 Powell.
Peppermint Tree features
soul/raza rock suitable for dancing
every night from 8:30 p.m.,
including bands such as Azteca

and Dakila. Yellow Brick Road
offers mainstream white boogie
music such as Ana and the
A-Train, Cisum, Nimbus, and Rick
Stevens'new band Brass Horizon.
Back on the sittin' and listenin'
side of things. The Great
American Music Hall offers good
music but an erratic policy on
admitting minors.
Located at 859 O'Farrell, the
Great American has a nasty habit
of pasting up a "no minors" sign
when they expect a heavy turnout
— most recently for the
appearance of The Legion Of
Mary featuring Jerry Garcia and
Merl Saunders.
A Final warning about the
Great American — when they
card, they really card.

The Orphanage at 807
Montgomery is the poshest rock
music club in town, catering to
over-21 types exclusively.
Unfortunately, according to
Chronicle columnist Joel Selvin,
The Orphanage is also losing
money hand over Fist. It seems
that despite excellent local talent
being booked, people can't afford
the complete dining-dancing scene
in these inflationary times.
Still, The Orphanage is worth a
look for those into a complete
dance scene sans teeny boppers.
Finally on the music scene, El
Matador at 492 Broadway is a
small club featuring excellent jazz
and other single artist acts such as
guitarist Gabor Szabo — a quiet
club with the emphasis on serious
music.

On the theater scene, San
Francisco is dominated winter and
spring by the always-excellent
American Conservatory Theatre.
Performing at the Geary Theatre
(Geary and Mason Streets) and
the Marines' Memorial Theatre
(Sutter and Mason Streets),
student rush tickets for weeknight
performances, are almost always
available 20 minutes before
curtain time.
San Francisco also has an
abundance of excellent long-run
small theater productions, led by
the six-year-old One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest at the Little
Fox Theatre, 533 Pacific.
One Flew is finally in its last
weeks, but has been universally
acclaimed as the best show in
town since its opening. If you've

missed it till now, don't miss it
forever.
Evolution of the Blues at the
On Broadway Theatre offers an
entertaining production by local
jazzman Jon Hendricks which,
while long on music, is claimed by
some critics to be short on
historical accuracy.
Recommended for a heavy
evening rivaling Cuckoos Nest:
Adam King, Fridays, Saturdays
and Sundays at the Everyman
Theatre, 24th and Mission. This
black comedy-drama is shaking up
audiences by using theatre to
discuss the possible conspiracies
behind the John F. Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy, and Martin
Luther King assassinations. If you
have time for thinking afterwards,
this production is a must.
Another Saturday night, as
some scruffy balladeer once
commented, and you're through
with booking. .. 0.K., you're not
through, but you're fed up, and
some fool down the hall yells the
immortal, "Hey, yeah, we could
all go to the City."
If your interest is cultural, the
list of theatrical events, dance
companies, and classical music
renderings is bound to turn up
something you will enjoy, San
Francisco being a Mecca for many
with artistic aspirations.
But suppose you're'only 19
and you want to rock out?
If you're underage without a
fake 1.D., you might as well
accept the inevitability of being
turned away from some of the
best places.
Time heals all wounds, but
there are places you can go to
hear the music that made the City
famous.
There's Always Winterland
First and foremost, there is
Winterland. Small clubs come and
go, but Bill Graham still has San
Francisco's monopoly on rock 'n'
roll. There isn't any artist of
international or national standing
that hasn't played at Graham's ice
rink, or the more spacious Cow
Palace.
Ticket prices have soared to
$5.50 in advance at Bay Area

Seating Service (BASS) outlets, or
$6 at the door starting at 6 p.m.
the evening of a concert. The best
advice is don't depend on tickets
at the door, and purchase tickets
for major concerts as soon as
possible after they're announced.
Don't overlook the "Sounds of
the City" series of $2.50 concerts
at Winterland which are now
being given on Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday nights rather than last
year's Tuesday slot. Even though
these shows are cheap, the new
musical talent featured —
Kingfish, Earthquake, Journey for
example — may well lead rock
music through the rest of the 70s.
For those with more mellow
tastes, Keystone Komer at 750
Vallejo offers great jazz artists in
week or two-week engagements,
Tuesday through Sunday. The
club is small, so buy in advance.

Francisco is dominated winter and
spring by the always-excellent
American Conservatory Theatre.
Performing at the Geary Theatre
(Geary and Mason Streets) and
the Marines' Memorial Theatre
(Sutter and Mason Streets),
student rush tickets for weeknight
performances, are almost always
available 20 minutes before
curtain time.
San Francisco also has an
abundance of excellent long-run
small theater productions, led by
the six-year-old One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest at the Little
Fox Theatre, 533 Pacific.
One Flew is finally in its last
weeks, but has been universally
acclaimed as the best show in
town since its opening. If you've

missed it till now, don't miss it
forever.
Evolution of the Blues at the
On Broadway Theatre offers an
entertaining production by local
jazzman Jon Hendricks which,
while long on music, is claimed by
some critics to be short on
historical accuracy.
Recommended for a heavy
evening rivaling Cuckoos Nest:
Adam King, Fridays, Saturdays
and Sundays at the Everyman
Theatre, 24th and Mission. This
black comedy-drama is shaking up
audiences by using theatre to
discuss the possible conspiracies
behind the John F. Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy, and Martin
Luther King assassinations. If you
have time for thinking afterwards,
this production is a must.
Another Saturday night, as
some scruffy balladeer once
commented, and you're through
with booking. .. 0.K., you're not
through, but you're fed up, and
some fool down the hall yells the
immortal, "Hey, yeah, we could
all go to the City."
If your interest is cultural, the
list of theatrical events, dance
companies, and classical music
renderings is bound to turn up
something you will enjoy, San
Francisco being a Mecca for many
with artistic aspirations.
But suppose you're'only 19
and you want to rock out?
If you're underage without a
fake 1.D., you might as well
accept the inevitability of being
turned away from some of the
best places.
Time heals all wounds, but
there are places you can go to
hear the music that made the City
famous.
There's Always Winterland
First and foremost, there is
Winterland. Small clubs come and
go, but Bill Graham still has San
Francisco's monopoly on rock 'n'
roll. There isn't any artist of
international or national standing
that hasn't played at Graham's ice
rink, or the more spacious Cow
Palace.
Ticket prices have soared to
$5.50 in advance at Bay Area

Seating Service (BASS) outlets, or
$6 at the door starting at 6 p.m.
the evening of a concert. The best
advice is don't depend on tickets
at the door, and purchase tickets
for major concerts as soon as
possible after they're announced.
Don't overlook the "Sounds of
the City" series of $2.50 concerts
at Winterland which are now
being given on Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday nights rather than last
year's Tuesday slot. Even though
these shows are cheap, the new
musical talent featured —
Kingfish, Earthquake, Journey for
example — may well lead rock
music through the rest of the 70s.
For those with more mellow
tastes, Keystone Komer at 750
Vallejo offers great jazz artists in
week or two-week engagements,
Tuesday through Sunday. The
club is small, so buy in advance.
Stand-Up Comedy
The Boarding House, 960
Bush, features fine music or
occasional stand-up comedy from
talents such as Mary Travers, The
Pointer Sisters, David Steinberg
and other less-known, equally
talented performers.
Trends at The Boarding House
have been toward classier dinner
club acts and away from hard
rock, but occasionally an
aberration such as Dr. Hook and
the Medicine Show enlivens the

line-up.
If dancing is your thing, you
can't depend on any of the three
establishments above. Your best
bets are Peppermint Tree at 660
Broadway and Yellow Brick Road
at 2215 Powell.
Peppermint Tree features
soul/raza rock suitable for dancing
every night from 8:30 p.m.,
including bands such as Azteca

and Dakila. Yellow Brick Road
offers mainstream white boogie
music such as Ana and the
A-Train, Cisum, Nimbus, and Rick
Stevens'new band Brass Horizon.
Back on the sittin' and listenin'
side of things. The Great
American Music Hall offers good
music but an erratic policy on
admitting minors.
Located at 859 O'Farrell, the
Great American has a nasty habit
of pasting up a "no minors" sign
when they expect a heavy turnout
— most recently for the
appearance of The Legion Of
Mary featuring Jerry Garcia and
Merl Saunders.
A Final warning about the
Great American — when they
card, they really card.

The Orphanage at 807
Montgomery is the poshest rock
music club in town, catering to
over-21 types exclusively.
Unfortunately, according to
Chronicle columnist Joel Selvin,
The Orphanage is also losing
money hand over Fist. It seems
that despite excellent local talent
being booked, people can't afford
the complete dining-dancing scene
in these inflationary times.
Still, The Orphanage is worth a
look for those into a complete
dance scene sans teeny boppers.
Finally on the music scene, El
Matador at 492 Broadway is a
small club featuring excellent jazz
and other single artist acts such as
guitarist Gabor Szabo — a quiet
club with the emphasis on serious
music.
