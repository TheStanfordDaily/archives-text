# Romantic Dining Spots

### BONNY RODDEN 
The following is a totally
subjective guide to The City's
restaurants. The list is obviously
incomplete but it does contain
places which I think are
particularly fun for college
students. Use these restaurants as
a starter but be sure to do some
investigating on your own.
Uniqueness, especially in
restaurants, is the essence of San
Francisco.
American
□ Bill's Place (2315 Clement St.)
— The crystal chandeliers in this
hamburger joint prove that Bill's
is a little out of the ordinary.
Hamburgers, hot dogs, etc. range
from $1.25 to $2.70. Go out to
the patio and be surrounded by
orchids while you munch your
burger. And if you get stuck
inside be sure to watch Bill's
toupee; it's always crooked. Open
seven days a week.
Bud's Ice Cream (Castro at
24th Street) — Even though this
isn't a restaurant (there's no place
to sit down) what Bud's has to
offer is so great people are
literally willing to wait hours for
it. Just look at the line sometime.
What Bud's has is creamy, rich
homemade ice cream. Cones 35 to
65 cents.

French
Hie Basque Hotel (15 Romolo
Place)—A great place if you're low
on funds and hungry. Right off
Broadway, this restaurant is a
perfect place to go before the
symphony or A.C.T. because it's
not far from downtown. There's
only one menu nightly, but you
get four or five filling courses. The
night I was there they served roast
beef, clams with rice, a fresh
vegetable, oily French fries, a
delicious homemade soup and an
orange for dessert. Closed
Tuesday. Reservations necessary.
★ Le Beaujolais (2415 Clement
St.)—A dark spot with only 12
tables — perfect for a romantic
date. The food is good but
expensive. Specialties: vea! in
champagne sauce ($6.95) and
rabbit ($6.75). Closed on
Tuesdays.
Le Cyrano (4134 Geary
Blvd.)— Not quite as intimate as
Le Beaujolais but the food is
better. Also has a separate
cocktail area. Price range: $4 25
to $7.50 for a dinner. The salad
and sweetbreads are particularly
tasty. Closed Sunday.
Reservations imperative.
Greek
Minerva Cafe (136 Eddy
St.)—A great place for dancing

Do you like eating with your
hands? Indulge at this fun place
where waiters wash your hands
and you sit on the floor to eat
your food. They specialize in
lamb. A great place for large
groups but make reservations. The
prices are extravagant.
South Vietnamese
Thanh Long Vietnamese

Restaurant (4101 Judah St.) —
You have not tasted crab until
you try their roast crab ($6.35)
cooked in butter and herbs. It's
worth the price. Closed Mondays.
Yugoslavian
★ Gelco's (1450 Lombard St.) —
If you want to be treated like an
eastern European king, this is the

place. You are catered to from the
hon d'oeuvres — which are exotic
with such tidbits as squid — to
dessert. Maybe the waiter just
likes younger people. Specialties:
Rack of Lamb ($9.00). They serve
mostly veal from $7 to $9. Try to
be seated downstairs; it's much
cozier. Closed Sundays.
Reservations necessary.
