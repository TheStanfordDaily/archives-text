# Buildings Capture City's Idiosyncracies
## 
### MARTHA ADAMS 
Some of San Francisco's
unique buildings are noted below
in an architectural tour of the City.
They are loosely organized into
districts to make your
investigation a bit more directed.
However, it is suggested that you
find a San Francisco map before
you set out on your expedition.
Mission Dolores (Dolores, 16th
and 17th Streets) was built in
1782. It is the City's "most
venerable and famous" building,
according to the latest guidebook,
a Peregrine Smith publication — A
Guide to Architecture in San
Francisco and Northern
California. The padres built the
mission on what they considered
the most desolate place on the
peninsula.
MARINA DISTRICT
Golden Gate Bridge (Hwy.
101), now 38 years old, had, until
1959, the longest span in the
world. Art Prof. Paul Turner
termed it "one of the most
beautiful examples of suspension
bridges in the world." He said that
details in the piers and light
fixtures are designed in the "Art
Deco" style of the period.
The Palace of Fine Arts (Baker
at Beach) was designed by
Bernard May beck, one of the Bay
Area's most innovative architects,
for the 1915 Panama-Pacific
Exposition. He uses classical
elements in a wild, fantastic way.
"It's really marvelous," said
Turner. "It has no function at all
... kind of typical of exposition
architecture."
He said it was originally built
out of temporary materials so it
could be pulled down after the
exposition. Finally, in 1962 it was

rebuilt with reinforced concrete
made to look like the former
wood and plaster which has been
painted to imitate marble in the
first place.
Seven row houses (2637-2673
Clay St.) are typical 1870s row
houses, according to Turner. The
two-story townhouses are in the
Italianate style with false fronts to
make them look more ornate.
They were the first stage of
Victorian architecture in San
Francisco.
Headquarters of the Vedanta
Society (Filbert and Webster) is,
said Turner, "sort of a fantasy
building" made entirely of wood
in a vaguely oriental motif meant
to suggest Islamic or Hindu
culture.
The Octagon House (2645
Gough, between Union and
Green) is one of the two surviving
octagonal houses in San
Francisco (The other is at 1067
Green St.). There used to be about
12 in the City.
Orson Fowler, who published
books in 1848 describing the
efficiency of octagon houses,
claimed they were space-saving
and economical. Actually though,
the extra corners waste space.
PRESIDIO HEIGHTS
Roos House (3500 Jackson St.,
between Spruce and Locust) is a
Gothic shingle style house
designed by Maybeck in a very
imaginative interpretation of the
style, according to Turner.
The 3200 block on Pacific
Avenue (between Walnut and
Presidio) is a "marvelous"
example of the shingle style
popular in the 1890 sand early
1900s, Turner said. The
informality of the group creates a

block harmony.
DOWNTOWN
Jackson Square (Jackson
between Montgomery and
Sansome) is the City's first
officially designated historic
district, according to the
guidebook. It is the only group of
downtown business buildings to
survive the 1906 earthquake and
fire.
The Hyatt Regency Hotel (3
Embarcadero Center — Battery to
the Embarcadero, between Clay
and Sacramento) contains one of
the most ingriguing interior spaces
of the City.
It also has a fountain with
running water that looks like
glass, theatrical-looking elevators
and a revolving bar and restaurant
at the top of the building.
The Transamerica Pyramid
(600 Montgomery, between
Washington and Clay) is a
controversial landmark. "It is
disliked by some architects," said
Turner, " 'for being an arbitrary
shape for a skyscraper.' "
Bank of America Building
(California at Kearny), one of the
tallest buildings in San Francisco,
has a plaza at the base of it with
sculpture.
The Hallidie Building (130
Sutter, between Keamy and
Grant), built in 1917, was a
successful effort on the architect's
part to produce a low budget-fast
construction building utilizing an
all-glass facade.
Helga Howie Boutique (140
Maiden Lane adjacent to
Stockton, Grant, Geary and Post)
was designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright. The brick arches are
examples of Wright's fascination
with curves.

City of Paris (Stockton and
Geary) may be torn down, so see
it while you can. It has a "great
central space with a skylight with
stained glass windows," said
Turner.
The interior was modeled
closely on the turn-of-the-century
Parisian department stores.
WESTERN ADDITION
Haas-Lilienthal House (2007
Franklin St., between California
and Sacramento) is the
Stick-Eastlake style monument of
the City, said Turner.

It is also the headquarters of
the Foundation for San
Francisco's Architectural
Heritage, which is an organization
formed to preserve San
Francisco's unique architecture.
Scheduled tours of the house are
given regularly.
The Chrysler Showroom (901
Van Ness, between O'Farrell and
Ellis) is an example of Maybeck
"using classical elements in a very
imaginative way with large areas
of glass," Turner said. The interior
was originally lit by huge
pendants and lights in the column
capitals.
NOB HILL
Grace Cathedral (California,
between Jones and Taylor), begun
before the earthquake, was
rebuilt out of reinforced concrete
in Gothic revival style after the
rumblings partly destroyed it.
The vaulting in the roof hasn't
been finished yet, and the bronze
doors are casts of the Ghiberti
doors on the Baptistry in
Florence.
The Flood House (now the
Pacific Union Club at 1000
California St., between Taylor and
Mason) is built of stone and is the
only one of the original mansions
on Nob Hill that survived the fire.
"San Francisco's charm and
architectural significance is not so
much a result of individual
buildings being fine architecture,"
Turner said, "but more the blend
of streets, neighborhoods,
topographical features and whole
rows of houses."
He urged architecture
enthusiasts to walk through
certain entire areas of the City. He
mentioned Chinatown,
Haight-Ashbury, Telegraph Hill,
Union Square, Russian Hill,
Mission Area, Pacific Heights and
Twin Peaks.
Turner suggested the sightseer
"notice the character of each
neighborhood — street life, type
of people, topography and
architecture."
"San Francisco doesn't have
the bland homogeneity that most
American cities have," he claimed.
"It's more like a European city
where each neighborhood has its
own distinctive character."

for long. Plans are underway to tear down this architectural relic.
