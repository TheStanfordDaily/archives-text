# BART: Disaster Or Deliverance?
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
For years San Franciscans wondered if
BART would ever be finished. Now they
wonder if BART was worth waiting for.
San Franciscans had to pay higher taxes.
They were forced to drive through a
Market Street, cluttered with boards and a
hodgepodge of construction equipment.
And finally the catalyst of annoyance and
frustration has been completed. Bay Area
Rapid Transit (BART), welcome to the
City.
As the country''s first new regional rapid
transit system in more than 50 years,
BART has become one of the most
controversial Bay Area landmarks.
If one descends from the Market Street
crowds to the underground stations at
Montgomery, Powell, or Civic Center (the
Embarcadero station isn't finished yet), it
is easy to forget all the problems one may
have read about since the early 60s.
And when one steps onto the
luxurious-looking trains it makes one
wonder why every other population center
hasn't begun construction of its own mass
transit system.
But, as the train pulls away from one
station it is seemingly just a matter of time
before something goes wrong. Indeed, most
BART critics claim that the system is not
any more reliable today than it was Sept.
11, 1972, when the first trains rolled.
While this might not be quite true, it is
close enough to give plenty of commuters
plenty of headaches.
Like when the train suddenly grinds to a
halt 200 feet beneath the San Francisco

Bay because one of the doors of the train
at the next station won't close.
Like standing among hundreds of other
sardines during the morning or evening
rush hour while cars that could be added to
the train are being repaired.
Like missing a train while you're
searching for a change machine that works
so you'll be able to buy a ticket, if you can
find a ticket machine that works.

The underlying quality of BART is that
the goal of its creators was to make it the
most completely automated system in the
world.
There are virtually no human beings to
deal with. This can occasionally be a bonus
but also can prove to be awfully
frustrating.
Nevertheless, if one has the time, it's
worth taking a ride on BART, even if it's

just to say you've been on it.
In fact, a person can tour the whole
system from Daly City through the City
and Oakland , then on to Richmond,
Concord and Fremont, for 30 cents.
However, be wary of the operating
hours (now 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday
through Friday), or you could end up
stuck in a place like El Cerrito or Union
City for an evening.
But using the system when things are
going right can be an enjoyable experience.
Every station has large maps of the entire
system, as do the trains.
Tickets for any amount from 30 cents
to $20 can be purchased and used
repeatedly until the amount has run out. A
ticket can also be increased in value if
necessary.
The cost of each fare is computed from
the station in which one enters to the
station from which one leaves. Therefore a
BART groupie can ride all day for next to
nothing, as long as he does not want to
leave any of the stations.
And a ride on BART will probably be
worth it, if for no other reason than to tell
one's grandchildren about it. That story
will either start: "I remember my trip on
the $1.5 billion train system that was the
biggest flop of the 20th century." Or, "I
remember when everyone was saying how
it wouldn't make it, but from the first time
I set foot on it, I knew it couldn't fail."
Only time will tell which one of these
stories is told, and whether a great idea
turns out to be a great flop.
