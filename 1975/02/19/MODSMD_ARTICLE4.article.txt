# Students Call Notes 'Life-Savers'
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
Midway through midterms, student response to the
ASSU lecture notes is enthusiastic.
"They are really good," stated Charlie Kert,
sophomore subscriber to notes for Biology 22. "They
may save my life on my midterm Friday."
Generally, though, those who already have had
midterms do not believe that the lecture notes had a
substantial effect on the grades they received.
"I don't think they made my grade any higher," said
freshman chemistry student Hugh Kuhn, "but they sure
made my test easier to study for."
Most students agree with Kuhn that the lecture
outlines are a beneficial addition to their own class notes
and assigned readings.
"My notes are just piles of sentences after sentences,"
said another biology student, Jim Whitmore. "Theirs are
more organized. They outline the information, add a
little bit and clarify a little bit, which is all pretty hard
to do when you're trying to listen at the same time."
Most students said the introduction of the note
service has had little effect on their traditional class
attendance and study habits. Although the notes
apparently have not tempted students to cut more
classes, one student admitted that they "might ease the
pain a little." Still, the notes apparently have not caused
students to neglect daily note-taking.
One Economics 1 student stated that many of his
(jeers use the notes merely as a supplement because the

students "just don't quite trust them yet."
The major student criticism of the lecture notes is
alleged variance in credibility from course to course.
One junior asserted that while notes for her physics
class are "easy to read and often explain the material
better than the professor," those covering her chemistry
class are a "rotten hodgepodge that are hard to
decipher."
A Biology 108 student claimed that while his lecture
notes were excellent during the first few weeks, "they
have gone downhill since, sacrificing the detail of the
lectures for the sake of organization."
This variance may be partially attributable to the
ASSU's choice of notetakers. Several classes, among
them Biology 22, are covered by their own TA's. Notes
for these courses are generally regarded as more
dependable than those taken by just another student. In
fact, students in Biology 22 consider the notes so good
that they feel they would be at a decided disadvantage
without them.
"Everybody else seems to be taking them, so it will
definitely raise the curve. You'd be behind if you didn't
have them, and those who don't subscribe usually end
up borrowing them," said sophomore Kert.
Students do not feel this pressure to subscribe in
most classes not covered by TA's.
A major reason for the difference in note quality,
■ according to note service director Vic Petroff, is the
system the individual note-taker works out with his
professor. Though an ASSU scribe follows general
| guidelines laid down by the service, he works out the

details of his assignment with the professor. In some
classes, the professor corrects the notes if they are
wrong. In others, they don't.
Petroff called the service's opening quarter "very
successful," noting that it overshot its anticipated 70
person-per-class subscription level. He cited Biology 22
as the most successful subscription attraction. Some 240
of its 380 enrolled students have ordered notes. The
largest number of subscribers in any class is 290 for
Psychology 157.
Subscription orders are still coming in. Petroff points
out, adding that just last week the ASSU was averaging
about $100 a day in new subscriptions. He admits,
however, that the amount has dropped substantially this
week, probably because midterms have ended.
Petroff also is pleased with this quarter's results from
a financial standpoint. He reports that the service has
already cleared over $2000, four times the amount it
expected to.
Though Petroff plans to expand the service this fall,
the number of classes for which the notes will be offered
next quarter will remain at 14. "We've had a good
quarter this time, but we can't yet count on that for
great expansion next spring," he said.
Feedback from professors has been positive thus far,
according to Petroff. "Most of those that we've heard
from seem very happy. We haven't had any complaints."
However, several professors have barred the services
from their classes next quarter — among them History 3
Prof. Gordon Wright and Psychology l's Phil Zimbardo.
But Petroff said both instructors were considering using
the notes in their classes next year.

"My notes are just piles of sentences after sentences,"
said another biology student, Jim Whitmore. "Theirs are
more organized. They outline the information, add a
little bit and clarify a little bit, which is all pretty hard
to do when you're trying to listen at the same time."
Most students said the introduction of the note
service has had little effect on their traditional class
attendance and study habits. Although the notes
apparently have not tempted students to cut more
classes, one student admitted that they "might ease the
pain a little." Still, the notes apparently have not caused
students to neglect daily note-taking.

students "just don't quite trust them yet."
The major student criticism of the lecture notes is
alleged variance in credibility from course to course.
One junior asserted that while notes for her physics
class are "easy to read and often explain the material
better than the professor," those covering her chemistry
class are a "rotten hodgepodge that are hard to
decipher."
A Biology 108 student claimed that while his lecture
notes were excellent during the first few weeks, "they
have gone downhill since, sacrificing the detail of the
lectures for the sake of organization."
This variance may be partially attributable to the
ASSU's choice of notetakers. Several classes, among
them Biology 22, are covered by their own TA's. Notes
for these courses are generally regarded as more
dependable than those taken by just another student. In
fact, students in Biology 22 consider the notes so good
that they feel they would be at a decided disadvantage
without them.
"Everybody else seems to be taking them, so it will
definitely raise the curve. You'd be behind if you didn't
have them, and those who don't subscribe usually end
up borrowing them," said sophomore Kert.
Students do not feel this pressure to subscribe in
most classes not covered by TA's.
A major reason for the difference in note quality,
■ according to note service director Vic Petroff, is the
system the individual note-taker works out with his
professor. Though an ASSU scribe follows general
| guidelines laid down by the service, he works out the

details of his assignment with the professor. In some
classes, the professor corrects the notes if they are
wrong. In others, they don't.
Petroff called the service's opening quarter "very
successful," noting that it overshot its anticipated 70
person-per-class subscription level. He cited Biology 22
as the most successful subscription attraction. Some 240
of its 380 enrolled students have ordered notes. The
largest number of subscribers in any class is 290 for
Psychology 157.
Subscription orders are still coming in. Petroff points
out, adding that just last week the ASSU was averaging
about $100 a day in new subscriptions. He admits,
however, that the amount has dropped substantially this
week, probably because midterms have ended.
Petroff also is pleased with this quarter's results from
a financial standpoint. He reports that the service has
already cleared over $2000, four times the amount it
expected to.
Though Petroff plans to expand the service this fall,
the number of classes for which the notes will be offered
next quarter will remain at 14. "We've had a good
quarter this time, but we can't yet count on that for
great expansion next spring," he said.
Feedback from professors has been positive thus far,
according to Petroff. "Most of those that we've heard
from seem very happy. We haven't had any complaints."
However, several professors have barred the services
from their classes next quarter — among them History 3
Prof. Gordon Wright and Psychology l's Phil Zimbardo.
But Petroff said both instructors were considering using
the notes in their classes next year.
Midway through midterms, student response to the
ASSU lecture notes is enthusiastic.
"They are really good," stated Charlie Kert,
sophomore subscriber to notes for Biology 22. "They
may save my life on my midterm Friday."
Generally, though, those who already have had
midterms do not believe that the lecture notes had a
substantial effect on the grades they received.
"I don't think they made my grade any higher," said
freshman chemistry student Hugh Kuhn, "but they sure
made my test easier to study for."
Most students agree with Kuhn that the lecture
outlines are a beneficial addition to their own class notes
and assigned readings.
