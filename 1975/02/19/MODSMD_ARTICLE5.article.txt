# Approval Of Mudd Building Marks Financial Policy Shift
## 
### DON COX 
Trustee approval of the new $9.5
million Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry
Building last week marked a change in
University financial policy that could
result in large, long-term commitments
the University has worked to avoid in
the past.
The chemistry building is just one
of four construction and renovation
projects that will be financed in part
by long-term loans. The University
may borrow up to $11.7 million in
order to pay for the buildings, business
and finance officials said.
In the past, the University has not
borrowed money on a long-term basis
to pay for such "non-income
producing buildings" because the cost
of the loan represented a fixed,
long-term expense in the operating
budget. Such expenses restricted the
flexibility of the financial planners,
according to Executive Assistant to
the Provost Edward Shaw.
Unlike housing, food service and
other buildings the University has
borrowed to pay for in the past, the
new projects produce no direct,
identifiable flow of income to pay off
the loan which financed their
construction, Shaw said.
The trustees have approved plans to
borrow to finance the new chemistry
building and they are expected to
approve similar plans to help pay for a
new library and renovation of the
history corner and Building 460 in the
Quad, he said.
'Represents Change'
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger confirmed
that "this does represent a change of
policy." He said the change was
necessary because of a tight operating
budget and the lack of gifts to finance
any renovation.
"It is unrealistic to think that
donors are going to be able to let us
renovate the physical plant... and
there is no hope of accumulating funds
out of the operating budget to do
anything. They are getting eaten up by
inflation," Augsburger said.

While Augsburger recognized this
new financial policy could mean up to
$1 million in fixed expenses in the
operating budget for the next 25 to 30
years, "the other side is that we really
would hate to go 25 years without
fixing the history corner."
Shaw said the "facilities represent
part of our endowment in a sense. If
we did nothing to maintain them, we
would be living off the past and doing
nothing for the future."
Shaw said the borrowed monies
would be used to close the "gap"
between gift-funding of a building and
its total cost. During the 19605,
grant-matching funds from the Ford
Foundation and federal grants were
used to close this gap. Both of these
sources have subsequently
disappeared, he said.
Because this gap represents the cost
of building bathrooms and other such
unglamorous facilities in the new

buildings, Shaw said donors could not
be expected to provide funds to close
the gap.
Amount Undetermined
The actual amount to be borrowed
has not yet been determined, Shaw
said. This is dependent on how well
fundraising efforts proceed, he said.
"We're doing everything we can to
avoid borrowing. It is conceivable that
we could close the full funding gap on
the projects, but I don't think we can."
When the loans will be taken out is
a financial decision that could occur
anytime in the next three years, Shaw
said.
Though the trustees have approved
borrowing plans only for the
chemistry building to date, Shaw said
he is "sure they will approve" similar
plans for the other three projects.
"There is every indication that the
trustees feel they must maintain the
physical plant, especially the main
Quad," he said.
The trustees will decide at their
March meeting whether to approve the
last increment of a $1 million flow of
funds in the operating budget with
which to borrow up to $11.7 million.
Shaw noted that even with the
borrowing arrangement, the third floor
and the offices and labs in the east end
of the new chemistry building would
be left unfinished until funding
becomes available sometime in the
future.
Construction of the building is
scheduled to start this summer and be
completed next year. It will house
lecture halls and undergraduate
laboratories to replace outdated
facilities in the old chemistry building,
which was built in 1902 and survived
the great San Francisco earthquake of
1906.

Shaw said the borrowed monies
would be used to close the "gap"
between gift-funding of a building and
its total cost. During the 19605,
grant-matching funds from the Ford
Foundation and federal grants were
used to close this gap. Both of these
sources have subsequently
disappeared, he said.
Because this gap represents the cost
of building bathrooms and other such
unglamorous facilities in the new

buildings, Shaw said donors could not
be expected to provide funds to close
the gap.
Amount Undetermined
The actual amount to be borrowed
has not yet been determined, Shaw
said. This is dependent on how well
fundraising efforts proceed, he said.
"We're doing everything we can to
avoid borrowing. It is conceivable that
we could close the full funding gap on
the projects, but I don't think we can."
When the loans will be taken out is
a financial decision that could occur
anytime in the next three years, Shaw
said.
Though the trustees have approved
borrowing plans only for the
chemistry building to date, Shaw said
he is "sure they will approve" similar
plans for the other three projects.
"There is every indication that the
trustees feel they must maintain the
physical plant, especially the main
Quad," he said.
The trustees will decide at their
March meeting whether to approve the
last increment of a $1 million flow of
funds in the operating budget with
which to borrow up to $11.7 million.
Shaw noted that even with the
borrowing arrangement, the third floor
and the offices and labs in the east end
of the new chemistry building would
be left unfinished until funding
becomes available sometime in the
future.
Construction of the building is
scheduled to start this summer and be
completed next year. It will house
lecture halls and undergraduate
laboratories to replace outdated
facilities in the old chemistry building,
which was built in 1902 and survived
the great San Francisco earthquake of
1906.


Proposed Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building
Trustee approval of the new $9.5
million Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry
Building last week marked a change in
University financial policy that could
result in large, long-term commitments
the University has worked to avoid in
the past.
The chemistry building is just one
of four construction and renovation
projects that will be financed in part
by long-term loans. The University
may borrow up to $11.7 million in
order to pay for the buildings, business
and finance officials said.
In the past, the University has not
borrowed money on a long-term basis
to pay for such "non-income
producing buildings" because the cost
of the loan represented a fixed,
long-term expense in the operating
budget. Such expenses restricted the
flexibility of the financial planners,
according to Executive Assistant to
the Provost Edward Shaw.
Unlike housing, food service and
other buildings the University has
borrowed to pay for in the past, the
new projects produce no direct,
identifiable flow of income to pay off
the loan which financed their
construction, Shaw said.
The trustees have approved plans to
borrow to finance the new chemistry
building and they are expected to
approve similar plans to help pay for a
new library and renovation of the
history corner and Building 460 in the
Quad, he said.
'Represents Change'
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger confirmed
that "this does represent a change of
policy." He said the change was
necessary because of a tight operating
budget and the lack of gifts to finance
any renovation.
"It is unrealistic to think that
donors are going to be able to let us
renovate the physical plant... and
there is no hope of accumulating funds
out of the operating budget to do
anything. They are getting eaten up by
inflation," Augsburger said.

While Augsburger recognized this
new financial policy could mean up to
$1 million in fixed expenses in the
operating budget for the next 25 to 30
years, "the other side is that we really
would hate to go 25 years without
fixing the history corner."
Shaw said the "facilities represent
part of our endowment in a sense. If
we did nothing to maintain them, we
would be living off the past and doing
nothing for the future."
Shaw said the borrowed monies
would be used to close the "gap"
between gift-funding of a building and
