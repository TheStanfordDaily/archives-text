# Staff Cuts Oust Bridge Psychologist

### PETER KRETZMAN 
Despite a cutback of counseling
staff by the University which will
crimp its professional services, the
Bridge will continue to offer peer
counseling to Stanford students.
A 20 percent cutback in the
Counseling and Psychological Services
Division of Cowell Student Health
Center, which oversees the Bridge, will
cost the center its funding for the
position of psychologist Martha
McDougle next year, according to
division director Dr. David Dorosin.
"However, our commitments to
peer counseling will continue to be
broadened next year, and our inability
to fund (McDougle's position] is in no
way a diminution of peer counseling
here at Stanford," he emphasized.
The Bridge, essentially a voluntary,
student-run peer counseling service
with headquarters at 640 Campus Dr.,
is one of a variety of similar services
available on campus under the aegis of
Dorosin's division, including Cowell
Health Center and Huston House on
Salvatierra Street.
Presently staffed with an 80
percent part-time psychologist
(McDougle) and a 30 percent part-time
psychiatrist, the organization is mainly
self-supported by an annual Spring
Fair and other projects.
"We see ourselves as an alternative
to the competition of Stanford, as
more of a cooperative community,"
said Mary Shepard, teacher of one of
several peer counseling classes and
workshops held by the Bridge. "The
Bridge is a safe place where people can
come during a transitional period,
losing a boy or girlfriend, changing a
major, etc."
Activities at the Bridge are varied
and numerous. Training sessions in
peer counseling are offered to all who
wish to participate, and the Bridge also
sponsors a SWOPSI course in peer
counseling. Sessions are "formatted
around people getting to know each
other, learning listening skills, helping
others find alternatives for
themselves," according to Shepard.
"We have a large, loose community
of people who frequent the place
because of their interest in peer
counseling and in helping people to
understand themselves," she said.
"Then, we also have a lot of drop-ins
who come in to talk or to check on
workshops or just to relax."
A new activity of the Bridge this
quarter is a regular radio program on
KZSU each Tuesday at 8 p.m. Run by
two Bridge staffers, Karen Egbert and
Daniel Hendrickson, the half-house
show is titled The Other Viewpoint.
According to Egbert, the show tries
to give exposure "to groups and
concepts that don't really get much

exposure on campus." Program topics
have included abortion, alternative
food buying, nuclear reactors and
poetry readings.
The Bridge now focuses largely on
personal growth, according to Egbert.
"Problem counseling used to be our
baseline, but we've expanded our
focus, from heavy-duty counseling to
personal growth work," she said.
According to McDougle, the Bridge

has changed its scope and
concentration in four-and-a-half years
of existence. "We've attempted to stay
in touch with what people want. We've
gone from drug counseling to growth
groups to alternative groups -
essentially out of the encounter group
stage," she said, adding that much
student interest today lies in hypnosis,
meditation and alternatives to
traditional sex roles.
