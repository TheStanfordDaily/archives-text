## Opinions editorial CUAFA Report 
### 
In reviewing the final report of the Committee on
Undergraduate Admission and Financial Aid (CUAFA), we
find that the panel's recommendation for aid to low-income
students is a good one, but disagree with the aid formulas
for middle-income students.
The final CUAFA report states that students from
low-income families will be expected to provide $450 in
self-help during their first year, regardless of the student's
race. This $450 could be covered by a low-interest loan
rather than by work, if the student desires.
This is a significant improvement over the committee's
draft proposal, which recommended a $700 self-help
requirement. We think the lower figure will take some of the
burden off low-income students, and allow them to devote
full-time to their studies during their first year. This would
alleviate some of the burden on minority students who
might need this extra time to adjust to a totally different
environment than that from which they came.
We do not, however, approve of the CUAFA proposal
that minority students outside the low-income category be
required to pay only 84 percent of the self-help expected of
non-minority students. We think that aid should be allocated
by need alone, and not on the basis of race or any other
factor.
This belief leads us to disapprove of the entire CUAFA
proposal for middle-income students, which continues the
present policy of allocating aid not only on the basis of
need, but according to certain characteristics. Students
considered exceptionally academically able, or who bring
"diversity" to the campus are awarded more desirable aid
packages than other students.
We welcome the admission of intellectually able and
diverse students. But we think that all students should be
treated equally once they come to Stanford.
