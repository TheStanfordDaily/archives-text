# Explanation Of COSS Plan
## 
### 
If there has been some confusion in people's
minds concerning the impact on fraternities of the
Committee on Student Services (COSS) housing
proposal, it will not be clarified by the inaccurate
and contradictory reporting of the Feb. 13 Daily
front page article by Richard Fearon and Bonny
Rodden headlined "Pledges To Go Up 45 Percent."
To begin with, the headline itself is grossly
misleading. Under the proposal, in any given year,
the number of sophomores which the fraternity
system must pledge would be 248. Last spring, the
fraternities pledged 210 students. Thus, the
increase in number of pledges would be 18 percent
not 45 percent. In the spring of 1973, the
fraternity system pledged 257 students, or more
than 100 percent of what the quota would be
under the proposed system.
The article goes on to state that "the
study ... would increase the number of students
living in fraternities from 550, this year's frat
population, to 774." In fact, the proposal would
not increase the number of students living in
fraternities at all. It would increase the number of
members.
If every student who pledged a fraternity as a
sophomore remained affiliated with the fraternity
for all three upperclass years, the data model used
at the meeting Fearon and Rodden covered shows
that the fraternity system would have a
membership of 774. Using data supplied by the
fraternities for the past three years, the actual
number corresponding to the 774 is 668.
In other words, there would be a 16 percent

increase in total membership. It is interesting to
note that of the 668 students who pledged
fraternities over the past three years, only 501
members lived in the houses during this past
autumn quarter.
Therefore the current proportion of members
not living in fraternities is 25 percent. Under the
new proposal, 26 percent of the fraternity members
would reside outside of the house.
Furthermore, the proposal does not, as the Daily
article states, "allow all students to remain on
campus for all four years." It allows all students to
try for the spaces not used by students with
guaranteed years. A student's chance of being
assigned housing for his fourth, or non-guaranteed
year, is about 22 percent.
One other glaring inaccuracy appears in the
Daily article. In the section dealing with
"consequences," the writers state that "a fraternity
which fails to meet its quota three out of four
consecutive years will be placed in the draw." The
proposal actually states that, if a house fails to
meet its quota for three out of four consecutive
years, the house officers would have to meet with
University officials to determine if the house
should enter the draw system. It is by no means
automatic.
With a little luck, perhaps the Daily reporting
and headlines on the COSS housing proposal will be
more accurate and less distorted than what it has
been in the past.
