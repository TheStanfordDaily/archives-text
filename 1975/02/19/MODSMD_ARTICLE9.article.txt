# Letters--CUAFA, 'Daily' Errors
## 
### 
The CUAFA Report
Editor:
Bruce Kadden's analysis (Daily, Feb. 14)
concludes that the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aids considers "individuals more similar
within an income group than within an
ethnic group."
As the report hopes to make clear,
—a) When indebtedness is a major issue, as
it can be in self-help, income group is in fact
considered the more pertinent variable.
—b) When minority enrollment is to be
enhanced, ethnic status is the logical criterion
for any measures to bo taken.
Each criterion is used in the aid proposal,
in its own context.

Errors Hurt 'Daily'
Editor:
I must take exception to your article on
the Undergraduate Specials research program
(Daily, Feb. 14). I was truly amazed and
amused when I found my name and a few
passages attributed to me in the article.
I am not in that particular program and I
have never talked to a Daily reporter. The
passages were lifted out of a Campus Report
article on independent student research that
ran recently, even to the extent of retaining a
few minor errors that were unfortunately in
the earlier article. One major alteration was
to bend a quote of mine to reporter
Elizabeth Pollock's own use, by including it
completely out of context.
I notice that two out of the three letters
to the Daily last Friday complained about
similar problems in other articles. These
errors may just be because of carelessness,
but they do definitely downgrade the quality
of the Daily.

Quote Misinterpreted?
Editor:
Well, I guess it's now my turn to protest a
quote. The specific quote being "And when a
guy sees a girl dance — whether she's a Dolly
or not — he's going to look at the same
places," rightly attributed to me in an
Editor's Note (Daily, Feb. 14).
The problem is that the wrong emphasis is
naturally read into the statement. In context,
we were discussing how it feels to know
people are watching you, not any specific
part of the anatomy. The point I was trying
to make is that any girl dancing at a dorm
dance knows there is a group of guys
standing around the dance floor watching. I
see no reason for "her" or a Dolly to be
embarrassed or insulted about it.
If someone has gotten to know me and
then decides I'm an "empty-headed, vain
sexist exploiting my bod," they are entitled
to their opinion. However, I cannot accept
animosity for the single reason that I am a
Dolly any more than I could accept someone
disliking me because I'm chicano or because
I'm a vegetarian.
Thankfully, most Stanford students are
open-minded enough to realize the Dollies
are five different girls who enjoy dancing
together.

UFW Lacks Support
Editor:
Students should realize that there are two
sides to the United Farm Workers
(UFW)-Gallo dispute. It is not a simple black
and white issue, and there are many

complicated problems which must be
understood.
Farm workers in the U.S. are often treated
poorly and payed low wages. However,
workers in California are among the best
treated in the country, and Gallo's workers,
in particular, are the highest paid farm
workers in the country.
There are no laws in California providing
for free elections for farm workers. Gallo
realizes this injustice and supports free
elections.
Gallo signed three year contracts with the
UFW in 1967 and 1970. Since Feb. 1,1973,
Gallo repeatedly requested meetings with the
UFW in order to negotiate their contract
which would expire April 18, 1973. The
UFW refused to hold negotiations until April
25. These negotiations were soon hopelessly
deadlocked.
On June 25, 1973 the Teamsters
contacted Gallo and claimed that they
represented the farm workers. They
presented GaJlo with a majority of the
workers signature cards saying that the
workers wanted to be represented by the
Teamsters.
These cards were verified with the payroll
signatures. Instead of meeting with Gallo to
dispute this, Chavez immediately called a
strike. If he would have had the signature
cards, he could have presented them to Gallo
or the State Mediation and Conciliation
Service. However, Chavez did neither of
these, and I think it's obvious he did not have
the signature cards.
There are 2.2 million non-union farm
workers in the United States, many of whom
make less than $2.00 an hour. I feel the UFW
could do more for farm workers, and society
as a whole, if they would unionize these
workers rather than boycotting Gallo, which
employs only five hundred farm workers.
