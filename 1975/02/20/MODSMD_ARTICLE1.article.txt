# Tuition Hike Parallels Ivy League
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
"The Harvard of the West" will be
charging slightly higher tuition than its
Eastern counterpart next year, but
Stanford's rates will still be
comparable to those at the average Ivy
League school.
Tuition at Harvard next year will
run $3700, against Stanford's $3810.
But while four Ivy League schools will
charge less than Stanford, an equal
number will charge more. The average
at the eastern universities for 1975-76
will be about $3830.
The Feb. 13 New York Times
quoted the other Ivy League tuitions
for next year: Brown, $3850;
Columbia, $3680; Cornell, $3775;
Dartmouth, $3900; Pennsylvania,
$3790; Princeton, $3900; and Yale,
$4050.
These figures indicate that despite
an unusually large increase in rates
here next year, Stanford only now has
caught up to its eastern counterparts
in fees.
In another Times article on Feb.
11, Provost William Miller was cited as
saying that tuition at Stanford might
easily reach $5500 by 1979.
'Estimating Process'
Yesterday, Miller explained that
making such projections are "clearly
an estimating process."
"We have to make some long-range
assumptions" about such things as the
expected return on endowments and
budget reductions," he added.
Asked if tuition was expected to
continue rising faster than the cost of
living, Miller said, "That's obviously
very speculative." He added, however,
that such behavior is expected.
Reasons for this faster rate of
increase include several general trends
in the economy. Most important is the
disparity between increases in
consumer prices and increases in wages
and salaries since, in Miller's words,
the University's budget has a "heavy
salary and wage component."
While none of the Ivy League
schools are experiencing as large a
According to a Brown University
Herald survey, the average Ivy League
increase amounts to 11 percent. The
largest increase, by percentage, will
come at Princeton â€” 11.4 percent. The
survey adds that the comprehensive
fees at Princeton (including room and
board as well as tuition) will jump 12
percent. Despite the size of this
increase, Princeton still faces a $1.5
million deficit next year.
Other Ivy League increases, as
reported by the Herald, are: Harvard,
Cornell, and Brown, 10 percent;
University of Pennsylvania, 9.6
percent; Dartmouth, 9.2 percent.
The yearly tuition here of $3810,
approved recently by the Board of
Trustees, represents an increase of
12.9 percent.
