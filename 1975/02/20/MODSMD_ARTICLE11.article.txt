Thomas Szasz, Ceremonial Chemistry: The
Ritual Persecution of Drugs, Addicts, and
Pushers. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday,
1974. 243 pages, $6.95.
Thomas Szasz, professor of psychiatry at
the State University of New York's Upstate
Medical Center in Syracuse, is nationally
known for his opposition to involuntary
mental hospitalization. He has now written
the world's first book-length defense of an
absolutely laissez faire policy on drugs.
Early in the book, Szasz closely examines
the language of drug abuse and drug control
that is employed by established institutions.
Using the same techniques of detailed
scrutiny that he has utilized with great
effectiveness in discovering the political
character of government mental health
programs, Szasz shows that official
consideration of drugs is a matter of politics,
not pharmacology.
Several themes are interwoven throughout
Szasz's book. A major theme, reflected in the
book's title, concerns the ceremonial use of
drugs. Szasz contends that certain drugs
(namely, alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea) are
approved by those who are in a political
position enabling them to define some
aspects of the dominant culture.
These approved drugs are ceremonial in a
special social sense. Accompanied by certain
mindsets that have been assigned to them,
these approved drugs function to facilitate
communion and social interaction. On the
other hand, the existence of disapproved
drugs (like marijuana or cocaine) means,
according to Szasz, that their users can be
placed in the politically useful category of
sacrificial scapegoats.
Deviants Are Punished
Yet in a sort of mirror-image existence,
inverting the values of the dominant culture,
the user, seller and producer of illegal drugs
become participants in "a counter-ceremony
celebrating a substance tabooed by society's
dominant ethic." As deviants, those involved
with illegal drugs are persecuted and
punished not so much for association with
the particular chemical substances, Szasz
contends, but for being members of a defiant
counter-culture.
Szasz emphasizes this importance of

looking at the political and moral rather than
pharmacological justifications for drug
policy. To illustrate this thesis, he notes that
to understand the significance of holy water
one examines its religious role in the
interaction of priests and parishioners; one
does not examine the water itself.
In addition to the ceremonial importance
of drugs, Szasz touches on other themes. He
recounts the history of past Chinese
persecution in the United States, stressing the
way Chinese opium use was used as an
ideological weapon by anti-Chinese political
figures (especially racist leaders of working
class groups). Szasz also tells of recent
American efforts to stamp out opium
consumption in Laos and substitute alcohol
consumption.

Szasz also touches on two salient and
interrelated questions: whether one's image
of man has him affected by impulses or by
temptations and whether one's political
society is organized on the basis of social
control or of self-control.
Freedom Of Choice?
Szasz argues that if people's view of
human nature gives primacy to human
differentiation and diversity and to the
capacity for choice-making (and hence to
moral choice in the face of temptation), then
the political organization of the society will
give greater scope to the governance of
human conduct through self-control.
But, Szasz believes, if people's view of
human nature gives primacy to human
sameness (especially as mechanisms or
animals) and to determinism (and hence to
the notion that humans are the helpless
victims of impulses and stimuli), then the
political format will give greater scope to the

governance of human conduct through
external coercion.
In this latter view of man, temptations to
indulge intemperately are no longer seen as
matters to be overcome by willpower and
self-discipline. Instead the availability of
drugs is seen as a powerful "force" that
pushes humans around. "The mechanical
metaphor of a plank or bridge giving way
under a heavy load replaces the moral
metaphor of man resisting or yielding to
evil."
In terms of this new linguistic (and
political) convention, the drug user is "a sick
patient who cannot help what he is doing."
The drug seller (or pusher) is now "a fiendish
criminal who could easily help what he is
doing."
Rhetoric Of Defamation
This defamation of the drug seller has
become a staple of political rhetoric. Szasz
writes: "We are told by a variety of
authorities, that citizens are imprisoned by
pushers [a gem of logic from Vice President
Rockefeller], when, in fact, the citizens'
safety is imperiled by legislators and
politicians who, by prohibiting the sale and
use of heroin, create the crimes associated
with the illegal market in it; ... that
'addiction is a form of genocidal execution,'
when, in fact, it is an expression of
self-determination; and that heroin pushers
are [simply by selling the drug] murderers
who should be killed by giving them an
overdose of heroin, [thus] advocating the
death sentence for metaphorical murderers
even though there is no such sentence for
literal murderers."
Szasz's new book is a good antidote for
this dangerous political bombast. These
illiberal political ideas when put into practice
deprive us of our liberty. In contrast, once
we recognize that human beings are capable
of making choices and exercising
self-control, we can see that it should be
quite legal to sell heroin to the public in
vending machines.
