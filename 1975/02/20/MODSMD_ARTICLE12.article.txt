# Stanford To Abandon Minority Aid?
## 
### 
If the proposed changes
submitted by the Committee on
Undergraduate Financial Aid and
Admissions (CUAFA) are adopted
by the Faculty Senate, the
University's commitment to
minorities, in all but the most
perfunctory acknowledgment, will
have been dissolved.
The Committee proposes, in
brief, to remove ethnic
considerations and replace them
with economic distinctions. With
this change, the creation through
affirmative action of a visible
minority population at Stanford
will erode with the increased
financial demands expected of
minority students and our
families.
Removal of ethnic
considerations, except for a token
one-sixth exemption in the
self-help figure for the middle
income students, effectively
reveals Stanford's goals
concerning continuing minority
participation in the University
student population. We regret this
attitude exceedingly and wish to
articulate our opposition to the
proposed changes.
Ethnic Factors Ignored
Holding income level constant,
the Committee indicates that
minority and non-minority
students from very low income
homes are indistinguishable,
completely dismissing any ethnic
considerations deemed
recognizable by most societal
practices, such as employment
practices.
For non-"very low income"
minorities, ethnicity is worth, on
the average about $200,
completely ignoring the outside
Stanford realities of the families
of black and chicano college
students which earn 40 percent
less than their white counterparts
(College Board Review, 1974), as
well as experiencing" twice the
unemployment rate of white

communities.
Here at Stanford, one out of
four students (entering 1973-74)
has a parental income above
$50,000; the proportion of
students with parental incomes
below $10,000 is one out of ten
(Dean of Students Report, July
1974).
Yet, ethnic minority parents
pay a much higher percentage of
the expected parental
contribution assessed by the
College Scholarship Service than
the significantly more affluent
whites — 118.2 percent compared
to 93.8 percent.
Minority students help create
diversity in the student
population at Stanford. This
diversification from the average
Stanford student includes the
inferior academic preparation of
ghetto, barrio or reservation
schools, disadvantaged economic
situations, and a culture
recognizably different from the
average white American.
To maintain this diverse part of
the student body requires time,
effort, and commitment. It
requires time for the cultural
adjustment and compensatory
academic studies needed by many
minority students, as exemplified
by the present practice of not
requiring freshman minority
students to work — effort from the
minority communities. It requires
commitment from Stanford, as in
maintaining the present policy of
financial aid for minorities.
Affirmative Action
Robert Huff, director of
financial aids,in his responseto the
questions raised by the Ethnic
Minority Task Force on Financial
Aids, cited 12 affirmative
action practices used to increase
the number of black, chicano, and
Native American students at Stanford.
Surely the Committee cannot now
propose the discontinuation of

certain affirmative action
practices, such as financial aids
considerations, and not expect a
resultant disssolution of the
minority communities.
The present financial aid policy
was the result of more than two
years of study and preparation.
Certainly the Committee
proposals, which Prof. Paul Green
stated as being in the "beginning
stages" at the open meeting on
Jan. 21, 1975, could not have
been well researched or carefully
thought out, especially
considering the general lack of

Jaramillo, et. 01.

data to support the changes, the
Committee's unfamiliarity with
most of Huff's statistics, and the
hasty alterations.
We oppose the proposed
changes in financial aids policy
and urge the Faculty Senate to
refer the proposal back to the
Committee.

Reyna are juniors majoring in

Committee's unfamiliarity with
most of Huff's statistics, and the
hasty alterations.
We oppose the proposed
changes in financial aids policy
and urge the Faculty Senate to
refer the proposal back to the
Committee.
(Josefina Jaramillo and Ricardo
Reyna are juniors majoring in
economics. Mario Vasquez is an
undeclared sophomore and
Martina Puente is a senior
majoring in political science.)
If the proposed changes
submitted by the Committee on
Undergraduate Financial Aid and
Admissions (CUAFA) are adopted
by the Faculty Senate, the
University's commitment to
minorities, in all but the most
perfunctory acknowledgment, will
have been dissolved.
The Committee proposes, in
brief, to remove ethnic
considerations and replace them
with economic distinctions. With
this change, the creation through
affirmative action of a visible
minority population at Stanford
will erode with the increased
financial demands expected of
minority students and our
families.
Removal of ethnic
considerations, except for a token
one-sixth exemption in the
self-help figure for the middle
income students, effectively
reveals Stanford's goals
concerning continuing minority
participation in the University
student population. We regret this
attitude exceedingly and wish to
articulate our opposition to the
proposed changes.
Ethnic Factors Ignored
Holding income level constant,
the Committee indicates that
minority and non-minority
students from very low income
homes are indistinguishable,
completely dismissing any ethnic
considerations deemed
recognizable by most societal
practices, such as employment
practices.
For non-"very low income"
minorities, ethnicity is worth, on
the average about $200,
completely ignoring the outside
Stanford realities of the families
of black and chicano college
students which earn 40 percent
less than their white counterparts
(College Board Review, 1974), as
well as experiencing" twice the
unemployment rate of white

communities.
Here at Stanford, one out of
four students (entering 1973-74)
has a parental income above
$50,000; the proportion of
students with parental incomes
below $10,000 is one out of ten
(Dean of Students Report, July
1974).
Yet, ethnic minority parents
pay a much higher percentage of
the expected parental
contribution assessed by the
College Scholarship Service than
the significantly more affluent
whites — 118.2 percent compared
to 93.8 percent.
Minority students help create
diversity in the student
population at Stanford. This
diversification from the average
Stanford student includes the
inferior academic preparation of
ghetto, barrio or reservation
schools, disadvantaged economic
situations, and a culture
recognizably different from the
average white American.
To maintain this diverse part of
the student body requires time,
effort, and commitment. It
requires time for the cultural
adjustment and compensatory
academic studies needed by many
minority students, as exemplified
by the present practice of not
requiring freshman minority
students to work — effort from the
minority communities. It requires
commitment from Stanford, as in
maintaining the present policy of
financial aid for minorities.
Affirmative Action
Robert Huff, director of
financial aids,in his responseto the
questions raised by the Ethnic
Minority Task Force on Financial
Aids, cited 12 affirmative
action practices used to increase
the number of black, chicano, and
Native American students at Stanford.
Surely the Committee cannot now
propose the discontinuation of

certain affirmative action
practices, such as financial aids
considerations, and not expect a
resultant disssolution of the
minority communities.
The present financial aid policy
was the result of more than two
years of study and preparation.
Certainly the Committee
proposals, which Prof. Paul Green
stated as being in the "beginning
stages" at the open meeting on
Jan. 21, 1975, could not have
been well researched or carefully
thought out, especially
considering the general lack of

Jaramillo, et. 01.

data to support the changes, the
Committee's unfamiliarity with
most of Huff's statistics, and the
hasty alterations.
