Why Invite Moynihan?
Editor:
It is an insult to the social
consciousness of the Stanford
community that Daniel P.
Moynihan will speak at
commencement in June.
Aside from his high sounding
credentials, Moynihan is best
known in academic circles as the
author of The Negro Family: The
Case for National Action (The
Moynihan Report) which he
wrote while working for the
Department of Labor during the
Kennedy-Johnson administration.
1 cannot give a full critique of this
work here. Basically he assesses
and interprets his data in such a
way as to place the blame for all
the ills of the black ghetto
community on what he sees as the
"breakdown" of black family
structure, and not with the racist
nature of the wider society.
Implicit in this is the notion
that change must occur within the
black community rather than in
American society as a whole.
Thus, this work serves to further
entrench racist assumptions and
policy orientations widespread in
our society.
In this analysis of social
organization, Moynihan shows
definite race and class bias. And
when research is used to
determine public policy (as in this
case), it is no longer simply an
issue of academic freedom.
Moynihan has to be held
personally accountable for the
racist implications of his work.
I find it impossible to be so
naive as to suppose that whoever
was responsible for inviting the
commencement speaker was
unaware of the nature of
Moynihan's past work.
The question that naturally
poses itself, then, is: Why was
Moynihan selected? I am
indignant at the prospect of
having this man speak, and object
to the implication that his views
reflect those of the Stanford
community at large.

Irish Appeals Case
Editor:
Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish has recently appealed his
case to Provost William Miller
after the Appointments and
Promotions Committee denied
him tenure. We wholeheartedly
support that appeal.
Irish has been penalized for
being a superior teacher. We are
particularly concerned at the
notion that he is popular with
students because he is a
"hand-holder."
This point of view demeans
good students as well as good
teachers. Intellectual rigor
characterizes Irish's classroom. He
pushes students to their potential.
We are thus appalled that the
Committee reached the decision
to deny Irish tenure. The
Committee has apparently refused
to take into account the opinions
of Irish's colleagues and students.
This justifies reconsideration of
Irish's tenure.

the ills of the black ghetto
community on what he sees as the
"breakdown" of black family
structure, and not with the racist
nature of the wider society.
Implicit in this is the notion
that change must occur within the
black community rather than in
American society as a whole.
Thus, this work serves to further
entrench racist assumptions and
policy orientations widespread in
our society.
In this analysis of social
organization, Moynihan shows
definite race and class bias. And
when research is used to
determine public policy (as in this
case), it is no longer simply an
issue of academic freedom.
Moynihan has to be held
personally accountable for the
racist implications of his work.
I find it impossible to be so
naive as to suppose that whoever
was responsible for inviting the
commencement speaker was
unaware of the nature of
Moynihan's past work.
The question that naturally
poses itself, then, is: Why was
Moynihan selected? I am
indignant at the prospect of
having this man speak, and object
to the implication that his views
reflect those of the Stanford
community at large.

Irish Appeals Case
Editor:
Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish has recently appealed his
case to Provost William Miller
after the Appointments and
Promotions Committee denied
him tenure. We wholeheartedly
support that appeal.
Irish has been penalized for
being a superior teacher. We are
particularly concerned at the
notion that he is popular with
students because he is a
"hand-holder."
This point of view demeans
good students as well as good
teachers. Intellectual rigor
characterizes Irish's classroom. He
pushes students to their potential.
We are thus appalled that the
Committee reached the decision
to deny Irish tenure. The
Committee has apparently refused
to take into account the opinions
of Irish's colleagues and students.
This justifies reconsideration of
Irish's tenure.

Why Invite Moynihan?
Editor:
It is an insult to the social
consciousness of the Stanford
community that Daniel P.
Moynihan will speak at
commencement in June.
Aside from his high sounding
credentials, Moynihan is best
known in academic circles as the
author of The Negro Family: The
Case for National Action (The
Moynihan Report) which he
wrote while working for the
Department of Labor during the
Kennedy-Johnson administration.
1 cannot give a full critique of this
work here. Basically he assesses
and interprets his data in such a
way as to place the blame for all
the ills of the black ghetto
community on what he sees as the
"breakdown" of black family
structure, and not with the racist
nature of the wider society.
Implicit in this is the notion
that change must occur within the
black community rather than in
American society as a whole.
