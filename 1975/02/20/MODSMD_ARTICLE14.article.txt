# TAs--An Exploited Group

Reznick, et. al.

Anyone familiar with undergraduate education
at Stanford knows that a large portion of the actual
teaching is done by graduate students. Yet the total
salary paid to teaching assistants (TAs) amounts to
less than $8 per month per student and
has remained fairly constant as tuition and prices
have skyrocketed. The last time that the salary
scale was changed, Lyndon Johnson was president.
We at STREU (Stanford Teaching and Research
Employees Union) are more than 300 graduate
students concerned about these and other
inequities in the Stanford educational system. For
the past few months we have held meetings in
various departments and determined several clear
patterns of inequities that TAs and RAs (research
assistants) face from the administration.
Firstly, salary. In the more than six years since
we last got a pay hike, the cost-of-living index has
increased 50 percent, so our real take-home pay has
fallen commensurately. Since graduate students
have to spend most of their income on basics (food,
rent, books) which have risen faster than the overall
index, the total effect is even worse.
Secondly, there is a wide disparity in what
constitutes a TA among the departments, and what
it is worth. In many departments, for example,
"readers" do everything a TA does (prepare course
material, meet students, grade exams), but receive
less than one-fourth of a TA's salary. Some
departments urge students to "volunteer" teaching

a course without pay for the "experience."
Finally, there are several ways in which graduate
students are treated like indentured servants.
Research and writing done by a graduate student
under the casual eye of a professor emerges with
the name of the professor attached. Teaching and
research positions are often not announced until
they are filled; qualified applicants are unaware of
available positions until departmental "pets" have
gotten their pick.
To rectify these inequities, the STREU council
has developed a four-point proposal:
—A cost-of-living increase in all TA and RA
salaries, retroactive to the time of the last increase
(January 1969), with guarantees of annual
adjustments as to cost-of-living.
—A redefinition of what constitutes a TA and
RA job with maximum class size and frequency of
section provisions, as well as a guarantee that those
who do a TA's job get a TA's pay.
—An agreement that all available jobs will be
posted as well as the qualifications, so that all
graduate students have a fair chance.
—A written contract between the University and
the student to ensure that all items agreed to by
both will be carried out.

and STREU Council member, wrote this column,
which was signed by 10 other Council members.)
