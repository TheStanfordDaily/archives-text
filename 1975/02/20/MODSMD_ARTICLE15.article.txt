## Herbert Gibboney: An Eye For A Wife Personalities Plus 
### Steve Hefter 
PLACERVILLE — Love means
selling an eye for your wife. At
least for Herbert Gibboney it
does.
At 58, savings used up and
medical insurance canceled,
Gibboney placed an ad in a local
paper offering to sell one of his
eyes for $35,000. The money, at
least $20,000 of it, would go to
finance two operations for his
wife, Jean, who's suffering from
severe intestinal ailments and a
deteriorating jaw.
"We can make it with three eyes
if she's well again," Gibboney
says. "All I want is for mama to
be better."
In a time of depressing
economic hardship, Gibboney is
the epitome of a man facing
unbearable problems without
money or power, but merely with
love.
His story is one which
refurbishes the ideals of an
America in which audacious men
rise above the troubles of their
time. His is a poem of spirit; a

singular spirit to survive and a
spirit among Americans to help
each other in times of need.
Disabled From a Heart Attack
Herbert Gibboney is but a thin,
almost fragile man with a face
well-defined in indelible scars
ingrained from years of privation.
He wears broken, square-shaped
eyeglasses which rest so
comfortably on his nose and hug
his face like a second skin.
He walks slowly and
contemplatively, with limbs
faltering in the grip of distress and
on the brink of utter collapse.
Two years ago, Gibboney and
his wife ran a small cocktail bar in
Los Angeles. Then, without prior
illness or warning, he suffered a
severe heart attack which left him
partially disabled and unable to
work.
The Gibboneys then moved to
Grass Valley where they planned
to build a house. Two months
later their medical insurance was
canceled.
At about the same time, Jean
Gibboney entered the hospital for
the first of many operations to
cure her abdominal pains. Without
insurance, and on a mere $200 a
month from Social Security they
couldn't pay the medical costs.
They were left $11,000 in debt.
Abdominal Pains Worsen
"When mama got sick we blew
all our money," Gibboney recalls
while restraining the tears. "We
didn't even have enough to finish
the house."
Without money, the Gibboneys
continued to live in Grass Valley,
in a blue-painted plywood shack
about the size of a Wilbur double.
Within a short time, Jean
Gibboney's health became worse.
Her jaw was deteriorating rapidly
and her abdominal pains had
become unbearable.
Herbert Gibboney spent his
nights thinking of ways to finance

another operation.
"When the money ran out," he
says softly, "there was no choice
but to stop everything but our
prayers for mama.
"When I went to bed every
night she was crying with pain.
She was plain dying. What was I
supposed to do? She was more
dead than alive.
"I thought about it for a
month, but never let her catch
on. I figured I could get by on
one. I wouldn't like it, but it was
the only thing I could think of."
He'd Give Both Eyes
Gibboney pauses. He's
stuttering and moving his mouth,
but words fail to emerge.

"If she needs both of 'em," he
manages to say, "she can have
'em. I just get such a lotta love
from my wife."
But Gibboney got more than
just love from his wife. His ad in
the paper was spotted by a local
reporter the day after it was
printed, and an article was
written.
On Feb. 1, Associated Press
picked up the story and ran it on
their wires around the world.
Soon, newspapers and television
sets brought the saga of the
Gibboneys to millions of
Americans.
But most importantly, the saga
came to the attention of Pioneer
Community Hospital in
Placerville, and Administrator

Gary Jones. Jones volunteered the
hospital's services, offering to
cover all expenses.
During the first week of Jean
Gibboney's stay there, the blood
bill alone was over $140.
"What has happened to the
idea of Americans being
neighbors?" questioned Jones
when asked about his benevolent
act.
"We're not an institution or
organization or hospital even.
We're people."
Public Responds To Gibboney
Standing outside his wife's
room at the one-story Placerville
hospital, Gibboney explains that
he's now a believer in people.
"I used to be a pretty sorry
fellow who took the attitude,
'you look after yourself and I'll
look after myself.' But now I'm
gettin' all the lookin' after and I
feel real good about everybody.
Even the guy who punched me
out a half a year ago gave me a
$25 check for mama. I feel good
about him now too."
Gibboney stands a man of
mixed emotions. He is for the first
time appreciating the love of
strangers and the warmth of many
people. But at the same time he's
worrying about his ailing wife
who remains today in serious
condition. But for a man who
lives alone in a shack in Grass
Valley the response to his plight
has been startling.
A Letter From Kenya
"I just can't believe it. People
have bubbled up all over," he
smiles. "We've gotten letters from
people everywhere.
"Just yesterday we got one
from all the way over in Nairobia,
[sic] Kenya. It was from a gal
witchdoctor who said that if we'd
send her a picture of mama she'd
take care of everything for us.
"And then there was the letter
with three dollar bills inside. It

wasn't signed, but I could tell it
was from a young child.
"It said, 'Here's $3 from my
auntie, mommy and me. I love
you and we love you.'
"That just made me sit down
and cry. And it wasn't the money.
It could have been three thousand
dollars.
"The thing that meant the most
to me was the 'I love you.' The
'we love you.' "
The Offer Still Remains
Gibboney cherishes it. He is
really overwhelmed by the letters
he's received and the free care his
wife's been given. But if the
charity ever runs out, "the offer
to sell the eye still remains."
"There's no way we're not
gonna save mama," he says,"I just
know everything's gonna turn out
all right. It's got to."
Fragile, but determined he goes
on.
"You know — I'm a Quaker. I

haven't been the best though. But
I've given my wife all the love I
have in me. And she's given me
more.
"And let me tell you
something. Look up there. Go

ahead. There's someone up there
who's takin' care of us," he says.
For one Herbert Gibboney the
world's an okay place. And in
times like today, it's nice to
know.

NO PLACE LIKE HOME—A year ago, Herbert and Jean Gibboney
stand by the foundation of the home they were never able to build
because all their money was spent on medical fees. Today, Herbert
Gibboney's offer to sell his eye has allowed Mrs. Gibboney to receive
proper medical services. However, both still live in the blue plywood
shack in the background.
