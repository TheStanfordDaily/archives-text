Why was the Egyptian physical chemist at the
Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Basel,
dismissed in 1959? Why was the American
destroyed? —A.S.
Frank Weinhold, assistant professor of
chemistry, suggests that the Egyptian physical
chemist was dismissed by Institute authorities after
heeding an American colleague's advice to
seek a new medical career in Cairo practice. Our
sources tell us that the American was destroyed
when he stupidly blundered into direct sunlight
after leaving his coffin during the day.

Why did the residence manager's office leave
refrigerators running and the heat and hot water on

in unoccupied trailers and apartments this summer?
It was cool enough at night that the heat must have
run many times, wasting an enormous amount of
gas and electricity in each of these many units. —
D.R.
The heat was not left on in the trailers,
according to Levi Richardson, maintenance
supervisor of University housing. The refrigerators
in the empty trailers were left running but were
turned to the warmest setting. Richardson
explained that when the refrigerators are turned off
completely, the seals dry up and the freon leaks
out. Therefore they are left running during the
summer — for a cost of about 30 cents per trailer.
