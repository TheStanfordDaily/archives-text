# Houston Flournoy Returns To His Books

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -
Houston I. Flournoy, defeated
Republican candidate in the 1974
governor's race, became a
professor again last week.
At the University of Southern
California, the 45-year-old former
state controller began teaching a
course on state and local
government politics.
It was Flournoy's first venture
back into acadernia since 1966
when he left his teaching job at
Pomona College and moved to
Sacramento.
As time passes, placing Gov.
Edmund Brown Jr.'s Nov. 5
election victory further and
further in the past, Flournoy says
he is coping with his defeat very
well.
He gets tired of supporters
coming up to him on the street
and telling him they wish he had
won the election because he is
trying to look forward. He terms
his attitude "not looking back."
Life Not Ruined
"I never felt my life would be
somehow ruined if I wasn't
governor of California. In some
ways I knew full well my life
would be a lot happier if I wasn't
governor of the state of
California," Flournoy said with a
short, dry-humored laugh.
Flournoy paused, and then
added: "I will not go to my grave
wondering why I didn't win."
In Sacramento, Flournoy has
put his modern four-bedroom
home up for sale. He refused to
disclose the asking price in a
recent interview at his home.
And Flournoy is house hunting
in the Palos Verdes area of Los
Angeles County, a well-to-do
residential section where many
homes overlook the Pacific Ocean.
Needs Big House
Flournoy needs a home with at
least four bedrooms for- his wife
Midge and their three children.
"We are kind of interested in
living down near the ocean

someplace if we can afford it.
Land is so damned expensive,"
Flournoy said.
About his political future,
Flournoy is vague. He won't rule
out the 1976 U.S. Senate race. But
he is not hungering to get back on
the campaign trail either, he says.
Back in 1966 Flournoy quit
being a government professor at
Pomona College when he was
elected state controller — a post
he went on to hold for two
four-year terms.


IN AND OUT—Manuel Aragon, shown here with his children, doubles
as deputy mayor of Los Angeles. He is simply "in a temporary role of
public service," he told three seminars on Tuesday, because he
believes anyone who stays in such a role too long grows stale.
