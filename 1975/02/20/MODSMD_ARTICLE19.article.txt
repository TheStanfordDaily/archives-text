# Augsburger On Task Force To Examine College Finance
## 
### PAM WOODS 
Robert R. Augsburger,vice president for business
and finance, has begun work as a member of a
nationwide independent task force examining
college and university endowment policy in a
period of growing financial strain.
The task force, sponsored by the Twentieth
Century Fund, will consider issues such as the
suitability of investing endowment funds in
common stock, the comparative roles that university
trustees and professional investment managers
should take in the investment procedure, and the
proper level of risk that should be taken with
endowment investments.
Stanford, with a total endowment fund of $340
million and a managed (invested) endowment fund
of $230 million, presently invests 50 to 60 percent
of its managed endowment funds in common stock,
and Augsburger calls this "the right place to be on a
long term basis."
"Many trustees have worried that it is
inappropriate to own common stocks," with
market averages at such a low point, says
Augsburger. But, he adds, most institutions invest a
large portion of their endowment funds in this
manner. He predicts that the task force will find
common stocks "a reasonable investment."
'Appropriate Balance'
"Common stocks provide an appropriate balance
â€” you have a reasonable rate of current income as
well as stability and growth in the long-range
future," he points out.

The University will continue to invest heavily in
common stocks, and will put less money into
investments such as real estate (mainly Stanford
Shopping Center) and other securities, Augsburger
says. It will also keep some funds in private trusts.
Another recent trend in college and university
endowment policy has been to employ private
investment managers to pick investment securities,
instead of leaving the decision to the institution's
trustees. Stanford has been doing this since 1968,
according to Augsburger.
Innovation 'Good Idea'
He calls this innovation "a good idea," and
suggests that "this job should be delegated to
professional investment managers. Trustees, he
adds, should be involved in supervising managers'
activities and formulating overall investment policy.
Augsburger says he would also like the task
force to look at the "critical issues" of the impact
of investment performance on fund-raising; tax
policies and how they relate to endowment
investing; and the amount of risk that should be
taken with various endowment funds.
The task force will act as a source of feedback
and ideas to J. Peter Williamson of the Tuck School
of Business Administration who is preparing the
final report for the Twentieth Century Fund.
Other members of the task force include
university and college trustees, professors and
presidents, professional investment managers and
university business and financial administrators.
