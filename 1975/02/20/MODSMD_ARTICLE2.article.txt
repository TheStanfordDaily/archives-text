# Petrodollars..New Source Of University Funding?
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Fundraisers here are wondering if
the widening gap between tuition
and operating costs can be filled with
recycled petrodollars from energy
exporting countries in the Middle
East.
The Shah of Iran recently
surprised the University of Southern
California with $1 million for an
endowed chair in petroleum
engineering. Already, Stanford and
other major universities are preparing
to bid for a share in Middle Eastern
oil revenues — that may come only
with strings attached.
In a time of extreme financial
uncertainty in higher education,
"those dollars are an incentive —
especially if we can get them on our
own terms," said William F. Massy,
vice provost for research.
"There is a correlation between
their wealth and our interest,"
acknowledged Jon C. Cosovich,
associate general secretary and
director of major gifts.
"We have been observing Iran
with much greater interest during the
past two years," Cosovich continued.
"We are thinking about going to
Saudi Arabia, and we probably will
before much time goes by."
Closer Contacts
Fundraisers and administrators
agree on the potential of funding
sources in the Middle East; but no
one is sure what kinds of projects the
oil exporting nations are willing to
support.
Foreign nationals who have
studied at Stanford are now being
contacted with greater frequency,
Cosovich said. "We never really asked
them to give before. Now we are
trying to establish closer contact that
goes beyond mailing out the
Stanford Observer."
Fundraisers approach Middle
Eastern alumni with the same "direct
approach" that characterizes the
University's appeal tp potential
American donors: "When you need a
$25,000 scholarship it doesn't matter
whether they're Iranian, French or
Japanese," Cosovich declares.
"As more people with Stanford
degrees return to their home
countries they are in a position to
give between $20 and $100 annually
to Stanford," Cosovich said.
But Stanford has only 50 living
alumni in Iran, and 26 in Lebanon,

according to Cosovich. University
records of their addresses are about
30 percent accurate. The foreign
donor comes from a culture where
voluntary contributions to education
are not an established tradition, and
cannot benefit from U.S. tex
incentives if he does decide to
contribute.
"Foreign alumni donations are
only worth looking into on a
long-term basis," Cosovich added.
"After all, it's a $1700 round trip
from San Francisco to Iran while it
only costs $1.70 to drive to San Jose.
We have 50 alumni in Iran, and over
500 in San Jose."
That gap may soon be bridged by
an influx of foreign students.
According to Clifford H. Clarke, a
foreign student advisor at Bechtel
International Center, the influx has
already begun. Clarke said he has
noticed an increase in the number of
students coming from Egypt and
Saudi Arabia within the last 18
months.
And according to a spokesperson
at the Iranian Embassy in
Washington D.C., it is only just
beginning.
"Most of our students in this
country now are self-supported," the
spokesman said. "But the
government is undergoing
consideration of certain programs to
provide financial aid to these
students. The plans will be
completed by next year."
Gas Lines
Despite the potential rewards of
encouraging foreign students to
attend Stanford, there have been a
few minor frustrations.
Last winter, the Admissions
Office received a phone call from an
official in the San Francisco
consulate of an oil exporting
country. The official requested
information on the status of a
particular foreign student's
application. He was told to call back
later — the admissions officer
handling the application was tied up
in a gas station line.
"I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of
universities are getting more students
from oil-exporting countries," says
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan. He added that he has
noticed a recent increase in Middle
Eastern students enrolled in Energy
