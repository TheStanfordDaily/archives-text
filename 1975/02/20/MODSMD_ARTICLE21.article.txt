# Deputy Mayor of L.A.
## 'Lifestyle Not Boring' 
### KATHY ALCALA 
"I've never wanted to look at
life as a career to be gotten
through somehow," said Manuel
Aragon, deputy mayor of Los
Angeles, "because that's a very
boring way to look at life."
In one of three seminars he
conducted here Tuesday, Aragon
outlined the managerial, policy,
and political roles that an urban
manager needs to cope with the
problems facing cities in the near
future. He also gave his "very
personal philosophy" in
approaching public service.
Aragon was appointed in 1973
by Tom Bradley when he became
the first black mayor of Los
Angeles. In the past, Aragon has
served as manager of the
Department of Commerce's
Economic Development
Administration, and executive
director of the Economic and
Youth Opportunities Agency of
Los Angeles, one of the nation's
largest antipoverty programs.
He also produced and hosted
KNBC-TV's program Impacto, a
public affairs program
concentrating on the plight of the
chicano.
Aragon sees public service as
"something beneficial to go into
and go out of . .. moving between
the two worlds." Otherwise,
"intellectual, emotional and
psychological resources get
drained away."
"Many career civil servants are
just sitting in their chairs because
they're burned out," said Aragon.
"At that point, they should leave
and do something else, and maybe
come back to public service
later."
Aragon feels that he is now in a
"temporary role of public service
... I wouldn't want to be a career

public servant." He thinks that
some people begin looking at their
job as a "proprietary right.. . My
office. People are trying to tell me
how to do my job."
"You should be secure enough,
yet flexible enough, not to feel
threatened," Aragon stressed.
He also talked about the
problems associated with trying to
run a city the size of Los Angeles.
During the recent bus driver
strike, the rapid transit manager
wanted to hire strikebreakers.
Although the city had no direct
control, Mayor Bradley said he
would personally lead the picket
line if strike-breakers were hired.
When it was known that the
engineers for water and power
were going to strike, Aragon met
with the management to see what
was going on. In order to maintain
power, the managers were
counting on about 100 supervisors
to stay on the job.
When only about two dozen
supervisors did not strike with the
workers, the air conditioning went
out in the main building. No one
knew how to fix it, and the
computers were unusable without
it.
"Look in the Yellow Pages,"
suggested Aragon. They did, and
got the air conditioning fixed.
"No matter how good a plan
looks on paper," said Aragon, "if
the people are not emotionally
prepared for the situation, it
won't work."
Aragon also discussed his

extensive experience with
community action agencies. He
feels that they have been
"basically discredited" in Los
Angeles, because they have been
reorganized so many times.
Every time the system changes,
said Aragon, they have to retrain
everyone in Washington, if it is a
federally funded program. Soon
they have an organization that
"doesn't relate to anything real."
He also feels that federal programs
should be linked to local
governments so that they don't
collapse as soon as the initial
funds are exhausted.
In the other seminars, Aragon
discussed "Prospects for
Minority-Owned Small Business,"
using his experience as president
of a Minority Enterprise Small
Business Investment Company as
background. He also addressed
"Urban Politics in Los Angeles,"
taking a micro-model perspective
on public policy impacts in
transportation, education,
poverty, and urban growth.

problems associated with trying to
run a city the size of Los Angeles.
During the recent bus driver
strike, the rapid transit manager
wanted to hire strikebreakers.
Although the city had no direct
control, Mayor Bradley said he
would personally lead the picket
line if strike-breakers were hired.
When it was known that the
engineers for water and power
were going to strike, Aragon met
with the management to see what
was going on. In order to maintain
power, the managers were
counting on about 100 supervisors
to stay on the job.
When only about two dozen
supervisors did not strike with the
workers, the air conditioning went
out in the main building. No one
knew how to fix it, and the
computers were unusable without
it.
"Look in the Yellow Pages,"
suggested Aragon. They did, and
got the air conditioning fixed.
"No matter how good a plan
looks on paper," said Aragon, "if
the people are not emotionally
prepared for the situation, it
won't work."
Aragon also discussed his

extensive experience with
community action agencies. He
feels that they have been
"basically discredited" in Los
Angeles, because they have been
reorganized so many times.
Every time the system changes,
said Aragon, they have to retrain
everyone in Washington, if it is a
federally funded program. Soon
they have an organization that
"doesn't relate to anything real."
He also feels that federal programs
should be linked to local
governments so that they don't
collapse as soon as the initial
funds are exhausted.
In the other seminars, Aragon
discussed "Prospects for
Minority-Owned Small Business,"
using his experience as president
of a Minority Enterprise Small
Business Investment Company as
background. He also addressed
"Urban Politics in Los Angeles,"
taking a micro-model perspective
on public policy impacts in
transportation, education,
poverty, and urban growth.
"I've never wanted to look at
life as a career to be gotten
through somehow," said Manuel
Aragon, deputy mayor of Los
Angeles, "because that's a very
boring way to look at life."
In one of three seminars he
conducted here Tuesday, Aragon
outlined the managerial, policy,
and political roles that an urban
manager needs to cope with the
problems facing cities in the near
future. He also gave his "very
personal philosophy" in
approaching public service.
Aragon was appointed in 1973
by Tom Bradley when he became
the first black mayor of Los
Angeles. In the past, Aragon has
served as manager of the
Department of Commerce's
Economic Development
Administration, and executive
director of the Economic and
Youth Opportunities Agency of
Los Angeles, one of the nation's
largest antipoverty programs.
He also produced and hosted
KNBC-TV's program Impacto, a
public affairs program
concentrating on the plight of the
chicano.
Aragon sees public service as
"something beneficial to go into
and go out of . .. moving between
the two worlds." Otherwise,
"intellectual, emotional and
psychological resources get
drained away."
"Many career civil servants are
just sitting in their chairs because
they're burned out," said Aragon.
"At that point, they should leave
and do something else, and maybe
come back to public service
later."
Aragon feels that he is now in a
"temporary role of public service
... I wouldn't want to be a career

public servant." He thinks that
some people begin looking at their
job as a "proprietary right.. . My
office. People are trying to tell me
how to do my job."
"You should be secure enough,
yet flexible enough, not to feel
threatened," Aragon stressed.
