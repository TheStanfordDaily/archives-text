## Movies: A Thriller, Two Libbers And A Rocker 
### 
Attention, fans of the macabre,
mystery and Alfred Hitchcock! If
you want an evening of
tooth-tightening, knuckle
whitening, spine-tingling,
hand-wringing, mind-shattering,
terrifying suspense, do not miss
The Stepford Wives, a
wonderfully excruciating
experience from the book by Ira
Levin, who gave us Rosemary's
Baby.
It is so eerie and scary — not in
its delivery but in its portent —
that you will be quaking in your
boots coming out of the theatre.
The male chauvinists will cheer,
the feminists will jeer, and the rest
of us will be in a stunned state of
disbelief.
The Stepford Wives, with
Katharine Ross (The Graduate) as
Joanna and Paula Prentiss (The
Parallax View) as Bobby, two
newcomers to the village of
Stepford, Connecticut, starts off
as a deceptively normal movie,
with Joanna and her husband
(Peter Masterson) and two
children leaving New York to start
a new life in the countryside,
where everything is quiet and
peaceful and the high point of
excitement is a minor auto scrape
in the supermarket parking lot.
Mysterious Ladies
But from the first appearance
of these mysterious Stepford
wives, ladies so charming, so
sweet, so docile, that they look
like they've been mass-produced
out of Madison Avenue, Joanna is
suspicious.
And little things begin to make
her wonder more — the wives'
disinterest in anything that
doesn't have to do with
homemaking, the foreboding
Stepford Men's Association, and
assorted uncharacteristic actions

of her friends and neighbors.
Across the road is Carol Van
Sant (Nanette Newman), a calm,
reserved woman whose main
ambition in life is to win the
Pillsbury bake-off (Gloria Steinem
is going to skyrocket through the
ceiling when she sees this); and
Dale Coba (Patrick O'Neal), a
high-ranking member of the Men's
Association, whose claim to fame
is having been employed at
Disneyland.
Too, there are Charmaine
Wimpiris (who thinks up these
names?), played by Tina Louise
(who, alas, will always be
remembered as Ginger on
Gilligan's Island), who suddenly
decides after four months of living
in Stepford that she wants what
her husband wants, and has her
tennis court replaced by a
swimming pool; and a host of
weirdos that make Joanna
panicked and paranoid — with
good reason.
Great Elements
The movie has every element
of the great mystery movie — the
mystifying behavior of the
townspeople, the heroine
wondering if she's crazy or if the
world is, and the final
confrontation in the foreboding
mansion on the hill in the
rainstorm.
Giving the comedy
performance of this year and any
other year is Paula Prentiss, who
adds to the film's deceptive
normality. She is so vibrant and
charismatic that she almost makes
the movie.
The rest of the performances,
especially Katharine Ross', are
great, the direction by Bryan
Forbes perfect, and the screenplay
by William Goldman (Butch

Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,
The Hot Rock) is a masterpiece.
The photography of
Connecticut added its own
mystifying effect to the movie. If
you want some high-class
entertainment that will not make
you feel like you've wasted your
time or your money in these days
when both are precious, go see
The Stepford Wives, and I
guarantee- that you will never ask
anyone "how are you?" again.

"77ie Stepford Wives" is at the
Altos Theatre in Los Altos.
Woman Under the Influence,
John Casavetes' newest film,
spares no discomfort in laying
bare the cruel circumstances of
modern middle-class life.
Woman is a bold and
unflinching portrait of Nick (Peter
Falk) and Mabel (Gena Rowlands)
Longetti,a suburban couple who,
despite Nick's high-powered
energy and Mabel's frenetic
histrionics, cannot communicate
at those crucial moments when
communication is vital.
This film focuses on Mabel
("Don't call her crazy," Nick says,
"she's unusual, but she's not
crazy") and shows from her
perspective the inevitable closing
of the ring as Nick, the family,
and the neighbors decide that the
best thing for her is time in a
mental institution.
Mabel is, as her children tell
her, "pretty, smart, and a little
nervous." Like too many women
today, she is bound to a three
bedroom two bath prison cell on
a quiet street in suburbia's
never-never land.
Fantastic Stew
Having all day to stew her ideas
and fantasies in solitude while

Nick and the children are away,
Mabel builds up a wealth of
creative energy that is always just
below the boiling point.
Holding Mabel down, though,
is good old middle-class
don't-make-a-scene decorum. It is
clear that Mabel's playful behavior
is appropriate only with the
children and it is equally clear
that the behavior of children is
not compatible with that of
adults.
Casavetes uncovers many of
the warring forces that pull on
this not unusual middle-class
family. Nick's work chums, who
form a a team-like camaraderie full
of the usual masculine
characteristics of slap-fighting and
macho-gaming, draw Nick away
from the house much of the time,
taking a higher priority in his life
than Mabel and the children.
Mabel, on the other hand, is
constantly trying to draw people
out, trying to get them to break
down their barriers the way she
draws a shy child into uninhibited
play.
Her free and unrestrained way
of life is wholly inappropriate in
the restrained and serious
middle-class world. In an
incredibly tense scene, Nick tells
her to "get your ass down."
Here is the crux of this
beautiful film's tension. Mabel's
struggle to control herself, her
attempt to conform to the proper
social behavior, tells dramatically
in her face.
Great Faces
With facial expressions and
inaudible conversations with
herself, Gena Rowlands, as Mabel,
moves this film into a class by
itself.
In the end, when Mabel returns
from a six month incarceration in
an institution, her body is a
battlefield for her emotions. She
is broken. She knows she must

conform or she will be locked up
again.
But the home to which she
returns is too rich with people and
things to which she cannot help
but respond. The result of her
return is brilliant and frightening.
As she moves slowly back into
her household, one emotion
begins to wash across her face, is
stifled by another and then is
overrun by a third.
The genius of this film is in
showing the roots of middle-class
madness. Finally, because we have
followed the action from Mabel's
point of view, we see that it is not
the women in our society who
gobble downers and suffer
nervous breakdowns that need
treatment, but rather it is the
society itself, with its doctors,
mothers-in-law and husbands, that
needs therapy.

"A Woman Under the Influence"
is at the Larkin and Music Hall
Theatres in San Francisco.
Stardust is the story of the rise
and fall of a rock and roll star
who is lucky enough to be in the
right place at the right time, all
the time. I have to confess my
ignorance of rock and roll history.
I wouldn't know whether the
character of Jim MacLaine
(played by David Essex) is based
on Paul McCartney, Jim Morrison,
Jimi Hendrix, or George Harrison,
nor am I sure of the film's
connection with That'll Be The
Day, also with Essex and Keith
Moon, which was released late in
1974.
Thus, I have to review
Stardust simply as a movie. And
as a movie, it's great. On the
whole, everything from the
performances to the directing by
Michael Apted and screenplay by
Ray Connolly all the way down to
the editing (masterful!) are

superb.
Jim MacLaine is a member of a
group called the Stray Cats
formed in the early 60s, on the
ground floor of the British music
explosion, and, in the space of a
year, are the number one group in
England.
Top Billing
By accident, though, they
become Jim MacLaine and the
Stray Cats, much to the chagrin of
the group. In well-produced
progression we are taken through
the steps of success, with the
groupies and the money and the
managers and the screaming
audiences.
Pressured to shed the Stray
Cats, MacLaine still goes up,
fulfilling all his ambitions, his
final one being to write and
perform an opera. From there,
both the pace of the picture and
pace of his life slow down to an
almost unbearable speed.
That the movie slows down too
may not have been intentional,
but it shows perfectly how life for
MacLaine has deteriorated. We see
him slide slowly down, further
and further into a pit of
decadence that his money has
created for him.
Background Sounds
There is background music of
the era, much as in American
Graffiti, which adds to the
atmosphere. However, there is one
thing that detracts from it — the
sin of unauthenticity. If a movie
takes place in the mid-60s, cars
from the 70s cannot be in the
picture.
If Sydney Pollack could
recreate the 1950s in front of the
Plaza Hotel in New York City for
The Way We Were, then anything
is possible — there is no excuse for
sloppiness. Another minor mark
against the movie is that
sometimes in the beginning, the
Cockney accents are so thick that
there should have been subtitles.
Once the ear becomes tuned to
the English as spoken by the
British, things get better.
Certain actors have to be
singled out for their
performances. If I hadn't known
David Essex was a rock star, I
would have assumed he has great
potential as an actor. His
performance cannot be dismissed
by saying that he was playing a
rock singer which is what he is.
Star Is Made
It would be like saying that
James Mason did a great job in A
Star Is Born just because he was
playing an actor, which is what he
was in real life. Adam Faith, as
the manager, is just as good, being
subtle and wise like a good
manager.
MacLaine's girlfriend, Danielle,
played by Ines Des Longchamps
in her first movie, is not only
beautiful, but talented. But, as the
entrepreneur who buys the Stray
Cats' American contract, Porter
Lee Austin, Larry Hagman once
again triumphs.
If I remember correctly, That'll
Be The Day did not receive
widespread distribution in the Bay
Area. I hope that is not a mistake
repeated with Stardust, for it is
well worth seeing.

"Stardust" is at the Aquarius
Theatre in Palo Alto.
The label "documentary"
should not discourage movie-goers
from seeing the film Antonia — A

Portrait of a Woman. Directed by
folksinger Judy Collins and Jill
Godmilow, Antonia vividly
demonstrates the power and
depth that the film medium can
bring to portraiture.
The film deals with musician
Antonia Brico's struggle to
become a professional symphony
director. Now 74, Antonia
decided at age 12 that she would
make conducting her life's
profession.
Though she made brilliant
debuts in her youth, and was then
encouraged by some of the
world's greatest musicians to
continue, she has never been able
to achieve full stature as a
conductor.
The film powerfully
demonstrates Antonia's plight. It
opens with close-up shots of old
newspaper stories, whose
headlines, such as "Hometown
Girl Makes Good," shout of
Antonia's initial success. Then the
camera focuses on a dumpy,
isolated building, the rehearsal
hall for the non-profit community
orchestra of Denver.
Shut Out
Antonia directs community
orchestra because professional
symphonies in the United States
have never hired women as
conductors.
Yet, even watching her direct
the struggling community
orchestra, her severe eyebrows
adding expression to the motions
of her hands, we feel a sense of
Antonia's vibrancy, the
excitement of her artistry. And
we can understand why, later in
the film, she says she feels
"perpetual heartbreak" being
unable to fulfill herself in a
male-dominated profession.
She directs four times a year,
but states that she would gladly
play four times a month if she
could. "I'm squeezed. I'm
frustrated," she says at one point
in the film. "I cannot play my
instrument, which is the
orchestra."
No Sounding Board
Fortunately, the film is not a
mere sounding board for feminist
doctrine. Antonia is above all else
an artist and the film directors
never allow the movie to become
bogged down in resentment.
It is an extremely narrow film,
in that no one speaks about
Antonia except Antonia herself.
Yet, this narrowness is the film's
overall force, because it can ride
solely on the strength and beauty
of the musician's character.
Appropriately, the soundtrack
consists of various classical pieces
that provide a resonant
background for understanding the
artist and her work.
At the film's conclusion, as
Antonia recalls the great
musicians and conductors she has
known and admired, we feel a
distinct, sad sense of things that
might have been. Yet, the film
successfully avoids sentimentality.
Antonia is an inspirational film
that stands out in a period of
particularly shallow movies. It is
an impressive tour de force, that
with less skill and feeling behind
it, might not have worked.
Antonia was Judy Collins' piano
teacher, and we can not help but
feel the tenderness and respect
that prompted Judy Collins to
make the film.
