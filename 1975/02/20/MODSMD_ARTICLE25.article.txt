# Best Bets
## 
### 
If you're looking for a myriad of
interesting and exciting activities, then
erase the upcoming week from your
schedule. Although you won't have to
limit yourself to watching haircuts and
counting leaves as they fall, you may
have to venure away from campus and
even then, you may wonder why there
isn't more to do and see. In our usual
autocratic style, we'll now try to guide
your exploits.
In the Stanford area, this week's
best bets are movies. At the Fine Arts
in Palo Alto, Mel brook's hilarious film
Young Frankenstein is well worth
experiencing.
"What I wanted," Brooks recently
told Newsweek, "was the truth behind
the horror conventions, the way real
people — crazy but real — would
behave in that castle. And I wanted tc
do it with the greatest affection for
those old films."
According to most critics, that he
has done — complete with a hump
back whose hump changes sides and a
woman whose name provokes horses
to neigh.
If one woman isn't enough in a
film, try The Stepford Wives, at the
Altos, which contains many.
According to the Daily's resident
chauvinist, the film stars Katharine
Ross, Paula Prentiss and "some other
women's lib types who get theirs from
the men" (and Billy Jean King isn't
even in it!).
If mystery is your goal, try Murder
On the Orient Express which is still
playing at the Palo Alto Square and
contains enough intrigue for everyone.
You may prefer live mystery; that
comes this week in the form of
Stanford basketball. On Friday night,
the Cards meet surprisingly powerful
Oregon State and, on Saturday,
aggressive Oregon.
A complete weekend of Stanford
sports should also include attendance
at the baseball doubleheader with
Fresno State on Sunday.

And to top the weekend, don't miss
the ASSU Sunday Flick, Cinderella
Liberty starring james Caan.
Musical entertainment on campus
this week is limited, but the music
department is presenting three fine
baroque musicians from the
Netherlands on Tuesday night.
According to a press release, violinist
Sigiswald Kuyken, his brother and
bassist Robert and harpsichordist
Robert Kohnen will "create music of
today in the spirit of history "

If you dare to be bold and can
stand Victor Borge, don't miss his
performance at the Oakland
Symphony Pops Concert on Sunday.
You remember him; he's the one who
tries to be funny and never plays the
piano — we're told that in person he is
and he does.
For straightforward comedy billed
as such, try Ruth Buzzi (yes, Gladys
from Laugh-In) at the Venetian Room
of the Fairmont. She sings and dances,
but her characterizations, including
gossip columnist "Busy Buzzi" and
drunk Doris Sidebottom, are the
mainstays of her act. And at Fairmont
prices, the least she can do is give you
a walnetto.

If you can't get a walnetto, at least
try exploring the mind of a man who
might hand you one — his name is Art
Hoppe, syndicated San Francisco
columnist, political satirist and a wild,
crazy thinker. At the Montgomery
Playhouse, The Gospel According To
Art Hoppe will portray several of his
characters, including Fred Frisbee and
Homer T. Pettibone, and each month
Hoppe will add a new skit to the show.
Yes, serious shows still exist too,
and to explain their form and content,
ACT is sponsoring a four part theater
lecture series conducted by Stanford
drama chairman Charles Lyons. The
first is Monday night and will cover
realism in Ibsen, Chekhov and others.
The lectures will concentrate on past
and current theater developments,
focusing in particular on ACT
productions.
Though such quality productions
are valuable, you may be a Stanford
student without transportation to get
to them. This week you are in luck;
television will feature a respectable
production. It is a two part (Thursday
and Friday) movie made for television
called Attack on Terror, concerning
the actions of the Ku Klux Klan in the
South in the early 60s.
The show is produced by Quinn
Martin (whose FBI series was
cancelled) and is intended as a
continuation of Martin's pro-FBI bias.
But in spite of such a bias, it promises
good entertainment and moral
seriousness.
If you don't care abou moral
seriousness, then just watch the movie
on Creature Features — The Demon
Planet, starring Barry Sullivan. It
concerns a planet inhabited by minds
searching for bodies. Next week, we
may see its writer's autobiography — a
film about bodies searching for minds.
Finally, if you're searching for
bodies or minds, call 982-8778 and ask
for Don. He'll make you feel glad
you're you.
