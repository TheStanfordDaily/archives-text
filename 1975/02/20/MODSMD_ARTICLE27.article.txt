Senate Bloeks Oil Import Tax
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to block
for 90 days President Ford's $3-per-barrel special tax on
imported oil, mustering more than enough votes to override
a promised veto.
The 66-28 vote, three more than what would be needed,
sent the House-passed bill to Ford.
There was still doubt, however, that Democrats could
muster the required two-thirds majority after a veto.
Democrats hope to use this issue as a first step in imposing
a substitute for the Ford program, which is intended to
discourage gasoline use by driving prices up.
Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee
approved a $21.28 billion tax cut bill, 29-6, after defeating
a Republican attempt to substitute a $12.4 billion rebate
program for it.
The bill, which now goes to the Rules Committee,
includes $16.21 billion in individual tax rebates for 1974
and tax cuts for this year; and $5.07 billion in tax cuts for
business this year and next.
President Ford issued a written statement saying: "I
intend to veto this legislation.
"I could not do otherwise and be faithful to my oath of
office. I deeply believe a prompt solution to our energy
problems is essential to the safety and progress of the
United States. I cannot be party to further delay," he said.
Ford contended that "the issue before the Senate was
very simple — to vote for delay or to vote for doing
something about our growing energy vulnerability."
Grand Jury Indiets Nixon's Lawyer
WASHINGTON — A federal grand jury indicted
Richard M. Nixon's tax lawyer and a Chicago appraiser
yesterday on criminal charges of faking a $576,000 income
tax deduction for Nixon while he was president.
Nixon's 1969 tax return stated that he had given the
government papers and other materials valued at $576,000.
Nixon claimed a deduction of $95,298.45 that year and
said the balance would be carried over for future use. This
was disallowed.
Frank Demarco Jr., 49, of Los Angeles, whose firm
prepared the tax papers, was charged with conspiracy to
defraud the United States, lying to the Internal Revenue
Service and obstructing a congressional inquiry into the tax
case. The three counts carry a maximum penalty of 15
years in prison and $25,000 in fines.
The appraiser, Ralph G. Newman, 63, also was charged
with conspiracy, and of aiding and assisting in preparation
of a false document to back up the claimed deduction. The
two counts carry a maximum penalty of eight years in
prison and a $15,000 fine.
A third man involved in the tax case, Edward L. Morgan,
pleaded guilty Nov. 8 to a conspiracy count and is serving a
four-month prison term.
An IRS spokesman said last month that Nixon has paid
what he owed for the years 1970 through 1972. Much of
the taxes which the IRS ruled that Nixon owed came from
the disallowed claims for deductions for donation of his
pre-presidential papers and for disallowed business
expenses.
Nevada Rejeets ERA
CARSON CITY, Nev. — The Equal Rights Amendment
was defeated by the state Senate yesterday, making Nevada
the third state to reject the proposed amendment to the
Constitution in as many days.
The Nevada Senate action followed defeat for the
amendment Tuesday in the Utah House of Representatives
and rejection by the Georgia General Assembly on Monday.

LOS ANGELES — The Prop. 9 ban on lobbyist
contributions to political candidates was upheld yesterday
by a Superior Court judge.
The judge also said he didn't think such gifts represented
a form of free speech, rejecting a suit by a group of 35
lobbyists that the new law violated the First Amendment
A compelling state interest is found in the necessity to
protect the lawmaking and administrative process against
improper influences," the judge said in a four-page ruling.
Ihe judge said that free speech rights would permit
to make recommendations — but not be
brokers in setting up a contribution from a client to a
legislator.
The judge earlier had upheld the constitutionality of
most sections of the political reform measure, approved
overwhelmingly by voters at the November general election.
Kissinger Returns From Middle East
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
returned yesterday from his tour of the Middle East.
Kissinger is understood to be confident that he has
narrowed the gap between Egypt and Israel to the point
where he can hope to achieve an agreement during a
two-week shuttle trip next month.
But Syria's mounting anxiety about gaining nothing
itself while Egypt moves toward acceptance of Israel lends
substance to reports that President Hafez Assad is urging
other Arab nations to resist so-called "partial settlements"
that could divide the Arabs.
U.S. officials said apparent efforts by Syria to thwart a
separate Egyptian deal with Israel is one of Kissinger's
principal worries.
As a result, as Kissinger plans strategy for his return in
March, he is exploring ways of linking a Sinai agreement to
Syria's drive for a further Israeli withdrawal on the Golan
Heights.
Hearsts Move To San Franeisco
SAN FRANCISCO — Randolph and Catherine Hearst
were moving yesterday into a Nob Hill apartment to escape
some of the memories associated with the Hillsborough
home where their fugitive daughter, Patricia, grew up.
Patricia turns 21 today, a year after a tense band of
reporters and photographers waited outside the 22-room
French provincial mansion for some word of the kidnaped
newspaper heiress. Her father is editor and publisher of the
San Francisco Examiner.
A year ago, on Patricia's 20th birthday, dozens of
reporters and cameramen waited in the road outside the
Hillsborough home for some word of the kidnaped
newspaper heiress.
The Hearsts reportedly plan no special observance of
Patricia's birthday and will have with them only one of
their five daughters, Vickie.
The Hearsts started moving into their sixth floor
penthouse apartment Tuesday, away from the memories
harbored in the San Francisco Peninsula house about 20
miles south of San Francisco.
Mrs. Hearst reportedly expressed the wish to move from
the house in Hillsborough, where a year ago Feb. 4 the
violent kidnapping 35 miles away in Berkeley left them full
of terror and bewilderment.
