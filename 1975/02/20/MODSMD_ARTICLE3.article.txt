# Rally Held For Minority Aid, UFW
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
About 100 students gathered in
White Plaza at noon yesterday to show
support for the United Farm Workers
and to protest the proposed change in
financial aid policy by the University.
Despite a light rain, several speakers
representing different ethnic groups on
campus addressed the crowd, and
several short skits were performed.
One was a parody of Dean James
Gibbs expressing his view of the role
of minorities here, with several quotes
from his controversial memo of
last Nov. 3.
Some of the speakers at the rally
were Ricardo Reyna of the Chicano
community, Doug Chan of the
Concerned Asian-American Students
and Charles Ogletree of the Black
Student Union.
Chan pointed to the
Asian-American community at the
University as an example of what the
administration would like to do with
all minority groups. He claimed that
Asians are included in the University's
report to the Department of Health,

Education and Welfare as a minority
statistic, while no "clear cut policy"
towards Asian-Americans exists.
Reyna quoted several statistics
which he claimed the University has
not considered in changing its policy.
According to Reyna, the average
income of minorities is 40 percent
below that of non-minorities at the
University, while the earning power of
a minority graduate remains below
that of a non-minority person with the
same degree.
Reyna also said that minority
families contribute more to the
education of their children at the
University than non-minorities because
"education is more valuable to them."
He claimed that Financial Aids
Director Robert Huff agrees with this
statement.
The rally was also intended to
publicize a march for the United Farm
Workers (UFW) on March 1. The
march will begin at noon in Union
Square in San Francisco and end in
Modesto.
