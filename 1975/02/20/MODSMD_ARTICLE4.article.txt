# Prof Manages Kings' Tennis America Venture
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
Making a success of a new company
is always a risky venture, states
Stanford Management Lecturer Steven
C. Brandt.
Exemplifying the risks encountered
is Brandt's involvement with
TennisAmerica Inc., a tennis-teaching
company begun by Billie Jean King,
her husband Larry and well-known
tennis coach Dennis Van der Meer in
1969. TennisAmerica Inc. is now
considering filing for court protection
under federal bankruptcy laws.
Brandt became involved with
TennisAmerica in 1972, assuming the
role of chairman of the board.

"They came to the Business School
when they had severe growing pains
and wanted some guidance of where to
go next," he explained. "I went in on
it, along with one other Bay Area
businessman, and tried to guide them
through the maze."
When he assumed his position in
the company early in 1973,
TennisAmerica already was on very
shaky ground. "The corporation
outgrown its resources and was in an
extremely tight financial situation,"
said Brandt.
Expansion
By the end of 1972, TennisAmerica
had expanded from its single original
site at Lake Tahoe to 14 locations.
Although King and Van der Meer did
some of the teaching, most was
handled by TennisAmerica
professionals.
Under Brandt's control,
TennisAmerica broke even in 1973,
and he then began to develop plans for
further growth and expansion.
"Essentially, in 1974 the plan was
to firmly establish the company in the
market," Brandt stated. "We felt that
the industry's life was such that it was
important to establish it at that time,
before any of the big companies came

Brandt pointed out that there
weren't any tennis corporations in the
$50 million to $250 million range at
that particular time. "There were no
middle-sized independent companies,"
he said. "We just weren't an affiliate
like so many other companies."
The other goal of Brandt and his
administration was to bring in
quality-controlled tennis instruction.
"We felt that we had an obligation
to bring some quality tennis
instruction to the tennis-playing

public. Our opinion was that the
tennis jocks were ripping off the
public," Brandt emphasized.
New Product Lines
Consequently, TennisAmerica
introduced sequential instruction,
standardized throughout the country,
and had these methods taught by its
own instructors, whom it certified as
qualified to teach tennis.
Feeling that "1974 was the year to
make our move," TennisAmerica
expanded to 24 locations and
introduced three new product lines.
The first was the TennisAmerica
Affiliates Program, consisting of
teaching aids and tennis handbooks for
players and their coaches.
Brandt also introduced the Winner's
Mark Program. This teaching method
involved testing and awarding medals
for improvement.
• Finally, TennisAmerica marketed a
new approach to the design of indoor
facilities," Brandt said. "This enabled

developers to build tennis facilities
that were something more than
converted warehouses."
To implement these programs,
TennisAmerica spent from $150,000
to $200,000 on advertising last year.
These investments proved to be a great
drain on the company's resources,
while yielding less than phenomenal
results.
All of the programs instituted were
contingent upon one factor, though —
adequate financing.
Said Brandt, "We developed and
introduced these products in the
anticipation of having sufficient equity

money. The plans for 1974-75 were
dependent on raising approximately
$400,000 in additional investment."
Brandt feels that this failure was
the major stumbling block in the
budding company's development.
He noted that the programs
themselves didn't fail. "The only thing
that failed was that we had to have
money to make the company go and
we couldn't get it," Brandt
commented.
"Money available to young
companies dried up completely," he
continued. "Our inability to attract
that money left us high and dry."

Other methods of raising cash —
borrowing from a bank or selling off
some of its assets — met with equally
little success.
"We tried to sell the Tahoe
property," Brandt said, "but last year
was also a bad time to sell property."
Brandt, who still owns stock in
TennisAmerica, characterizes such a
business failure as an integral part of
entering into any business venture. In
the last 10 years, three of his four
business ventures have successfully
reached fruition. He said he is
accepting this single failure with
resignation.
"I think this is a good example of
entrepreneUrship," he added. "The
risks and awards of a particular
venture have to balance off.
"Entrepreneurs often are viewed as
outlaws rather than as something more
romantic and acceptable," Brandt
continued. "But a giant company such
as IBM only came about because some

guy was willing to put his chin on the
line to win something."
Emotional Investors
Brandt ended his tenure as board
chairman in August 1974. He
explained that the company's
management felt that the tennis
players in the company might be able
to raise the equity money better than
businessmen.
"In effect, we were saying that if
we couldn't get regular investors,
maybe we could get emotional
investors," Brandt noted.
So, Dennis Van der Meer assumed

the chairmanship and Billie Jean King
became president. These two
encounter a bleak situation, for as of
November 30, the company was facing
liabilities of $410,439 against assets of
only $16,999.
Looking back on it all, Jim
Jorgenson, business manager for the
Kings and a director of TennisAmerica
intoned, "It was just a question of
trying to grow too fast."
But as Brandt explained, "This is
what entrepreneurship is all
about.. . Taking risks is the nature of
the business game."

Consequently, TennisAmerica
introduced sequential instruction,
standardized throughout the country,
and had these methods taught by its
own instructors, whom it certified as
qualified to teach tennis.
Feeling that "1974 was the year to
make our move," TennisAmerica
expanded to 24 locations and
introduced three new product lines.
The first was the TennisAmerica
Affiliates Program, consisting of
teaching aids and tennis handbooks for
players and their coaches.

involved testing and awarding medals
for improvement.

developers to build tennis facilities
that were something more than
converted warehouses."
To implement these programs,
TennisAmerica spent from $150,000
to $200,000 on advertising last year.
These investments proved to be a great
drain on the company's resources,
while yielding less than phenomenal
results.
All of the programs instituted were
contingent upon one factor, though —
adequate financing.
Said Brandt, "We developed and
introduced these products in the
anticipation of having sufficient equity

money. The plans for 1974-75 were
dependent on raising approximately
$400,000 in additional investment."
Brandt feels that this failure was
the major stumbling block in the
budding company's development.
He noted that the programs
themselves didn't fail. "The only thing
that failed was that we had to have
money to make the company go and
we couldn't get it," Brandt
commented.
"Money available to young
companies dried up completely," he
continued. "Our inability to attract
that money left us high and dry."

Other methods of raising cash —
borrowing from a bank or selling off
some of its assets — met with equally
little success.
"We tried to sell the Tahoe
property," Brandt said, "but last year
was also a bad time to sell property."
Brandt, who still owns stock in
TennisAmerica, characterizes such a
business failure as an integral part of
entering into any business venture. In
the last 10 years, three of his four
business ventures have successfully
reached fruition. He said he is
accepting this single failure with
resignation.
"I think this is a good example of

risks and awards of a particular

"Entrepreneurs often are viewed as
outlaws rather than as something more
romantic and acceptable," Brandt
continued. "But a giant company such
as IBM only came about because some

guy was willing to put his chin on the
line to win something."
Emotional Investors
Brandt ended his tenure as board
chairman in August 1974. He
explained that the company's
management felt that the tennis
players in the company might be able
to raise the equity money better than
businessmen.
"In effect, we were saying that if
we couldn't get regular investors,
maybe we could get emotional
investors," Brandt noted.
So, Dennis Van der Meer assumed

the chairmanship and Billie Jean King
became president. These two
encounter a bleak situation, for as of
November 30, the company was facing
liabilities of $410,439 against assets of
only $16,999.
Looking back on it all, Jim
Jorgenson, business manager for the
Kings and a director of TennisAmerica
intoned, "It was just a question of
trying to grow too fast."

what entrepreneurship is all
about.. . Taking risks is the nature of
the business game."

her husband Larry and well-known
tennis coach Dennis Van der Meer in
1969. TennisAmerica Inc. is now
considering filing for court protection

Brandt pointed out that there
weren't any tennis corporations in the
$50 million to $250 million range at
that particular time. "There were no
middle-sized independent companies,"
he said. "We just weren't an affiliate

"We tried to sell the Tahoe
property," Brandt said, "but last year
was also a bad time to sell property."
Brandt, who still owns stock in
TennisAmerica, characterizes such a
business failure as an integral part of
entering into any business venture. In
the last 10 years, three of his four
business ventures have successfully
reached fruition. He said he is
accepting this single failure with
resignation.
"I think this is a good example of
entrepreneUrship," he added. "The
risks and awards of a particular
venture have to balance off.
"Entrepreneurs often are viewed as
outlaws rather than as something more
romantic and acceptable," Brandt
continued. "But a giant company such
as IBM only came about because some

guy was willing to put his chin on the
line to win something."
Emotional Investors
Brandt ended his tenure as board
chairman in August 1974. He
explained that the company's
management felt that the tennis
players in the company might be able
to raise the equity money better than
businessmen.
"In effect, we were saying that if
we couldn't get regular investors,
maybe we could get emotional
investors," Brandt noted.
So, Dennis Van der Meer assumed

the chairmanship and Billie Jean King
became president. These two
encounter a bleak situation, for as of
November 30, the company was facing
liabilities of $410,439 against assets of
only $16,999.
Looking back on it all, Jim
Jorgenson, business manager for the
Kings and a director of TennisAmerica
intoned, "It was just a question of
trying to grow too fast."
But as Brandt explained, "This is
what entrepreneurship is all
about.. . Taking risks is the nature of
the business game."
Making a success of a new company
is always a risky venture, states
Stanford Management Lecturer Steven
C. Brandt.
Exemplifying the risks encountered
is Brandt's involvement with
TennisAmerica Inc., a tennis-teaching
company begun by Billie Jean King,
her husband Larry and well-known
tennis coach Dennis Van der Meer in
1969. TennisAmerica Inc. is now
considering filing for court protection
under federal bankruptcy laws.
Brandt became involved with
TennisAmerica in 1972, assuming the
role of chairman of the board.

"They came to the Business School
when they had severe growing pains
and wanted some guidance of where to
go next," he explained. "I went in on
it, along with one other Bay Area
businessman, and tried to guide them
through the maze."
When he assumed his position in
the company early in 1973,
TennisAmerica already was on very
shaky ground. "The corporation
outgrown its resources and was in an
extremely tight financial situation,"
said Brandt.
Expansion
By the end of 1972, TennisAmerica
had expanded from its single original
site at Lake Tahoe to 14 locations.
Although King and Van der Meer did
some of the teaching, most was
handled by TennisAmerica
professionals.
Under Brandt's control,
TennisAmerica broke even in 1973,
and he then began to develop plans for
further growth and expansion.
"Essentially, in 1974 the plan was
to firmly establish the company in the
market," Brandt stated. "We felt that
the industry's life was such that it was
important to establish it at that time,
before any of the big companies came

Brandt pointed out that there
weren't any tennis corporations in the
$50 million to $250 million range at
that particular time. "There were no
middle-sized independent companies,"
he said. "We just weren't an affiliate
like so many other companies."
The other goal of Brandt and his
administration was to bring in
quality-controlled tennis instruction.
"We felt that we had an obligation
to bring some quality tennis
instruction to the tennis-playing

public. Our opinion was that the
tennis jocks were ripping off the
public," Brandt emphasized.
New Product Lines
Consequently, TennisAmerica
introduced sequential instruction,
standardized throughout the country,
and had these methods taught by its
own instructors, whom it certified as
qualified to teach tennis.
Feeling that "1974 was the year to
make our move," TennisAmerica
expanded to 24 locations and
introduced three new product lines.
The first was the TennisAmerica
Affiliates Program, consisting of
teaching aids and tennis handbooks for
players and their coaches.
Brandt also introduced the Winner's
Mark Program. This teaching method
involved testing and awarding medals
for improvement.
• Finally, TennisAmerica marketed a
new approach to the design of indoor
facilities," Brandt said. "This enabled

developers to build tennis facilities
that were something more than
converted warehouses."
To implement these programs,
TennisAmerica spent from $150,000
to $200,000 on advertising last year.
These investments proved to be a great
drain on the company's resources,
while yielding less than phenomenal
results.
All of the programs instituted were
contingent upon one factor, though —
adequate financing.
Said Brandt, "We developed and
introduced these products in the
anticipation of having sufficient equity

money. The plans for 1974-75 were
dependent on raising approximately
$400,000 in additional investment."
Brandt feels that this failure was
the major stumbling block in the
budding company's development.
He noted that the programs
themselves didn't fail. "The only thing
that failed was that we had to have
money to make the company go and
we couldn't get it," Brandt
commented.
"Money available to young
companies dried up completely," he
continued. "Our inability to attract
that money left us high and dry."

Other methods of raising cash —
borrowing from a bank or selling off
some of its assets — met with equally
little success.
