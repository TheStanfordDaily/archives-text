# 'Compact Cities' May Be Answer To Urban Spraw' Scientist Says
## 
### MARC STRASSMAN 
Dr. Oliver Yu's solution to urban
crowding and suburban sprawl is to
put everybody and everything in one
place. And if his suggestions didn't
surprise or satisfy everyone, they at
least injected a few new scenarios into
the collective planning consciousness.
Yu, a research technician at the
Electric Power Research Institute,
spoke to a crowd of 60 in Tresidder
Lounge about his concept of compact
cities.
Yu's model for the future is called a
compact interiorally spacious
multi-layered megastructure —
supurbia for short. It combines,
according to the researcher, the
tranquility of suburban life, the
peacefulness of nature, and the
excitement of an urban center. But to
some of the audience, it appeared to
be more like a plush zoo than anything
else.
Yu began his talk with a brief
overview of the history of cities,
including slides of Florence, Cologne,
and Athens, pointing out how these
older cities were built to human scale,
being compact, with narrow streets,
and only moderately high buildings.
Modern cities, he said, are not built
to human scale, are too crowded and
high-rise, and give residents a feeling of

dehumanization. This leads, he
pointed out, to an exodus to the
suburbs, leaving the cities to the poor
and feeble, not really creating the
paradise sought by those fleeing the
city.
Another adverse effect of the
exodus, he added, is the need for
commuting that separating domicile
and workplace creates.
To solve these problems Yu
suggested building a megastructure,
made up of four sections, a core, a
mid-plaza district, and inner and outer
residential areas. Internal movement
would be accomplished by monorail
and shuttles. The mid-plaza district
would include schools, shops,
hospitals, and offices.
The inner residential areas would
consist of single family houses,
supplied by an elaborate system of
conveyor belts. The outer residential
areas would be chiefly apartment
houses.
Asked how the numerous plants
pictured in his drawings of the city
could survive, Yu offered three
possibilities: make sure they are
varieties that could grow under
artificial lights; hire a plant service to
bring in fresh plants from outdoors, or
make them of plastic.
Yu said he envisioned the

megastructure housing 250,000
people, costing $10 billion
(standard, he said, for a city that size),
financed by private developers, and
located in Alaska or along Interstate
Five.
Asked how people might be
expected to react to prolonged
isolation from the natural world, Dr.
Yu replied that if people would go
crazy in it, then it wouldn't be built.
