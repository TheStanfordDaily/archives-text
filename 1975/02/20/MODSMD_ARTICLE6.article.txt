# ASSU Supports Aid Vigil, Mock 'Funeral'
## 
### 
By ANN AMIOKA
The ASSU Senate voted 11-2 last
night to support both today's student
vigil on the financial aid proposal of
the Committee on Undergraduate and
Financial Aids (CUAFA) and the
"funeral" for the "death of
undergraduate education" today.
The Senate also passed 10-3 a
resolution urging that the Faculty
Senate reject CUAFA's plan and
return it to the CUAFA for "further
consideration open to more
community input without oppressing
time constraint."
About 30 students appeared at the
Senate meeting to show their support
for the resolutions, both submitted by
Sen. Debbi Silton.
The first resolution also urged the

administration to listen to student
opinion on "important issues such as
undergraduate education and its
priorities, tenure procedures, financial
aids and other budget priorities."
The resolution declared that the
administration's recognition of the
importance of student input has been
"negligible."
Hasty Stand 'Hypocritical'
Discussion centered around the
resolution to urge rejection of the
CUAFA proposal, mainly because the
original resolution also contained the
resolution to support the student vigil.
Several senators declined to take a
stand on the CUAFA proposal without
knowing more about it.
"It would be hypocritical to take a
stand hastily," said Sen. Tom Price.
Sen. Tim Conway opposed support
of the student vigil saying he had seen
"no overwhelming student support"
for the rally against CUAFA's
proposal.
Conway also opposed rejection of
the CUAFA proposal, and said that
coming to Stanford was a "cultural
shock for everyone" so minorities
should not receive special
consideration.
Silton claimed the resolution was
also aimed against the "elite
atmosphere" that the University
would be creating if the CUAFA
proposal is accepted, and not just the
problems of culture shock for
minority students.
Didn't Consider Ramifications
Sen. Maria Echaveste urged Senate
support of the resolution, saying that
CUAFA "did not consider the
ramifications of the proposal."
The Senate finally voted 8-6 to
drop the resolution to support the
student vigil for the resolution against
the CUAFA proposal. Silton then
added it to her other resolution.
In other action, the Senate:
— voted 10-1 to give $50 to the
Stanford Support Committee for the
United Farm Workers to help pay for a
bus for the upcoming march to
Modesto.
— approved the Council of
Presidents' nominations for the
Speaker's Bureau.
— placed Sens. Tim Conway and
Robert Nelson on the elections
commissioner selection panel.

About 30 students appeared at the
Senate meeting to show their support
for the resolutions, both submitted by
Sen. Debbi Silton.
The first resolution also urged the

administration to listen to student
opinion on "important issues such as
undergraduate education and its
priorities, tenure procedures, financial
aids and other budget priorities."
The resolution declared that the
administration's recognition of the
importance of student input has been
"negligible."
Hasty Stand 'Hypocritical'
Discussion centered around the
resolution to urge rejection of the
CUAFA proposal, mainly because the
original resolution also contained the
resolution to support the student vigil.
Several senators declined to take a
stand on the CUAFA proposal without
knowing more about it.
"It would be hypocritical to take a
stand hastily," said Sen. Tom Price.
Sen. Tim Conway opposed support
of the student vigil saying he had seen
"no overwhelming student support"
for the rally against CUAFA's
proposal.
Conway also opposed rejection of
the CUAFA proposal, and said that
coming to Stanford was a "cultural
shock for everyone" so minorities
should not receive special
consideration.
Silton claimed the resolution was
also aimed against the "elite
atmosphere" that the University
would be creating if the CUAFA
proposal is accepted, and not just the
problems of culture shock for
minority students.
Didn't Consider Ramifications
Sen. Maria Echaveste urged Senate
support of the resolution, saying that
CUAFA "did not consider the
ramifications of the proposal."
The Senate finally voted 8-6 to
drop the resolution to support the
student vigil for the resolution against
the CUAFA proposal. Silton then
added it to her other resolution.
In other action, the Senate:
— voted 10-1 to give $50 to the
Stanford Support Committee for the
United Farm Workers to help pay for a
bus for the upcoming march to
Modesto.
— approved the Council of
Presidents' nominations for the
Speaker's Bureau.
— placed Sens. Tim Conway and
Robert Nelson on the elections
commissioner selection panel.

The ASSU Senate voted 11-2 last
night to support both today's student
vigil on the financial aid proposal of
the Committee on Undergraduate and
Financial Aids (CUAFA) and the
"funeral" for the "death of
undergraduate education" today.
The Senate also passed 10-3 a
resolution urging that the Faculty
Senate reject CUAFA's plan and
return it to the CUAFA for "further
consideration open to more
community input without oppressing
time constraint."
