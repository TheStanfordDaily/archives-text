The University decided last week to deny a radical former
student access to a number of files he had requested to see
under the provisions of the "Buckley" Amendment.
The amendment to the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974, sponsored by Sen. James L. Buckley
(Cons.-N.Y.), grants any student, former student or his
parents "the right to inspect and review the education
records" of that student.
The alumnus said James V. Siena, legal adviser to
President Lyman, refused to show him certain files which
Siena claimed were non-academic, and therefore not covered
by the amendment.
These files included all material from the General
Secretary's Office and internal memoranda between
administrators and lawyers. The alumnus said these files
were the most interesting ones, because they "were the bases
for deciding things like whom they would press criminal
charges against."
We think that all files kept on a student by agencies of
the University should be open to that student. All these
files, not just "academic" ones, can be used by University
officials against a student.
The University's unwillingness to release all files is
potentially dangerous, in that it could open the way for the
retention of secret "enemies lists." The University's position
also shows that it will dodge and duck behind every comma
in the law to avoid opening as many files as it legally can.
Therefore, the only solution as we see it, is for Congress
to clarify the nebulous term "education records," so that all
files kept on a student are clearly open to that student.
