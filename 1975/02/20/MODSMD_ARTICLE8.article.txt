# Moynihan-Yawn
## 
### 
The selection of Daniel Patrick Moynihan to be the
speaker at this year's commencement disturbs us. Though
we recognize that Moynihan is an excellent scholar, we go to
sleep at the very mention of his name.
We do not believe the graduating class would have chosen
Moynihan if it had been permitted to choose its own
commencement speaker. Seniors did, in fact, recommend
several other speakers, including such persons as Barbara
Jordan, Walter Cronkite and Woody Allen. But, as we
understand it, the University frowned on these choices as
being too non-academic.
The position of the University is that the major
qualification for a commencement speaker is that he or she
has attained eminence in academia. We don't believe this
should be the sole qualification; rather, we think that other
eminent persons should be considered, and that ability to
give an interesting speech should also be a factor.
The University argues that commencement is not
primarily for the graduates but for their parents and for the
University community as a whole. We agree that the speaker
chosen should be acceptable to the parents, who deserve
something for their $20,000.
We think, however, that students and parents alike would
prefer a speaker who, if not perfectly captivating, can at
least keep them awake.
