| What is a BIRKENSTOCK?
The distinguishing feature
of the Birkenstock sandal
is the molded footprint
contour. It was inspired bv <<
observing the natural
function of the foot on
soft earth. A yielding
surface supports the arch
of the foot and invites the
N- gripping action of the toes.
The patented footprint
contour is composed of
highly elastic cork. It
3>> becomes flexible with
S. body warmth and molds
itself to your feet â€”
becoming more "your
own" with every step you
take.
