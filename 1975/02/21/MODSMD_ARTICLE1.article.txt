# Faculty Panel Modifies, OKs Aid Plan
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
adopted the bulk of the controversial
financial aid packaging proposal for
minority students from the Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids (C-UAFA).
By voice vote, the Senate accepted
the basic principles of the proposal but
made two key modifications which
may make it more palatable to
protesting minority group members.
Faculty representatives decided to
extend special benefits to minority
students from very low income
backgrounds. These benefits would be
similar to those C-UAFA had proposed

previously only for minority students
from middle income backgrounds.
In realigning the financial need
categories, C-UAFA originally
proposed that all students from very
low income backgrounds be treated
equally, regardless of race.
The Senate also accepted the report
with the understanding that there were
no "implications that the University's
commitment to recruitment of
minorities has diminished."
Cutback Charged
Protesting minority students have
charged throughout the week that the
C-UAFA proposal represents a
University cutback in minority student
recruitment.
While senators debated inside,
about 150 people organized by
Students for Equity sat outside the
Senate chambers "quietly making our
presence felt," according to one
student.
The group had marched silently
from the front steps of Old Union to
the Senate forum in the Graduate
School of Business.
Chilly Vigil
About 20 minority students spent a
chilly, almost sleepless night on those
same Old Union steps Wednesday
night in an all-night vigil and fast
protesting not only the financial aid
changes but also University tenure
procedures and the proposed
elimination of existing innovative
education programs.
The vigil and fast continued into
yesterday and culminated with the
march to the Faculty Senate meeting.
Senate action on the C-UAFA
proposal came amidst motions from a
few faculty representatives to send the
aids-package scheme back to the

committee for further study and
consideration of complaints from
minority students.
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo, acting as a spokesman for
disgruntled students, explained that
minority student feeling against the
original form of the C-UAFA proposal
ran "very deep."
Discussion Planned
Rosaldo and other minority student
spokesmen refused comment on the
Senate action after the meeting. "We'll
be meeting tonight to discuss what
happened," Rosaldo said following
yesterday's proceedings.
During the debate, several senators
complained that the C-UAFA proposal
was being rushed through the Senate
"too hastily." Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Bernard Roth, considering the
minority students' appeals, cautioned
his colleagues that it would "be
insensitive of us to steamroll over their
wishes."
But Financial Aids Director Robert
Huff stressed that the new guidelines
must be ready within 10 days because
his office will begin processing
applications from prospective
freshmen by then.
Biology Prof. Paul Green, C-UAFA
chairman, termed lack of action on the
proposal "impossible." Huff estimated
that if the University retained its
present financial aids guidelines, the
financial aids revenues would fall
$80,000 short of student need.
'Not Overnight'
Green added that the C-UAFA
report was not drafted "overnight"
and that the committee had submitted
a "highly explicit draft proposal" last
December which was subsequently
modified.

"We listened to a lot of criticism,"
Green said, "and a lot of that is
incorporated in this report."
Senators also asked Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon if the shift
away from total gift aid for minority
freshmen would discourage those
students from attending Stanford.
Hargadon maintained that the aid shift
"wouldn't have a marked effect on our
ability to recruit [minority
students]."
In other Senate business, faculty
representatives approved a proposal
for a new interdisciplinary major in
international relations.
The faculty has been studying
the international relations major since
1967.

"DEATH" MARCH — About 150 students met with President Richard Lyman yesterday to discuss what they claimed was
the "death" of undergraduate studies at Stanford. The meeting followed a rally attended by some 300 people and a mock
funeral procession to the offices of Lyman and Provost William Miller.
