# Minority Quotas May Be Needed
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This column was
written before the Faculty Senate
met yesterday to vote on
questions of financial aid to
minority students.)
The Faculty Senate has voted
on a proposal by the Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid that would "treat
all low-income students the same
regardless of race, in matters of
financial aid" (Daily, Feb. i3).
If the Senate voted favorably
upon the proposal, 1 contend that
Stanford will have to walk very
carefully not to eliminate all
low-incomt minority students.
(Of course, this could be an
objective, but let's assume it's not.
"Black" and "chicano"
lowerclassness always seems more
reprehensible to anglos than
anglo lowerclassness.)
Quotas Needed
The only way to keep from
eliminating low-income minorities

entirely is to deliberately allocate
a proportion within the
low-income freshman total for
each minority. If the figure is set
at no less than the proportion
each was in the low-income
segment of the 1974-75 entering
class, some semblance of equity
may be achieved. (Admission
standards need not be tampered
with.)
This would "freeze" the social
class structure of minority
representation on campus (a
concession to the "elitists") but
would insure against the
elimination of minorities (a
response to the legitimate fears of
those who believe that this will
happen if action is not taken to
see that it doesn't).
Let's not drag in hypocritical
arguments about the illegality or
immorality of "quotas." If the
foundations, some trade unions,
the Federal Government and

other agencies in this racist
society are willing to use "quotas"
to rectify the evils of the past,
why are universities so
self-righteous about this matter?
And it doesn't have to have
anything to do with so-called
"lowering standards" at all!
'Moynihan Mystificiation'
Much of the argument that has
been involved in the campus' great
debate about financial aids is
predicated upon what I call the
syndrome of "Moynihan
Mystification." This high priest of
"benign neglect," along with some
other so-called social scientists,
has been perpetuating the
nonsense that race and ethnicity
are really not the problem
anymore, but only
socio-economic status.
But treating all low-income
people the same does not assure
equality of opportuntiy. There are
still special disabilities whether we
want to face them or not. Black
unemployment rates are twice the
rate for whites. Minority students
often have commitments to their
poverty-stricken extended families
that anglo poor do not.
But of even greater relevance is
the fact that minority students
cannot afford to start piling up
debts during their freshman yar,
because when they graduate their
average earnings over a period of
years are likely to be smaller than
they will be for their white fellow
alumni.
Half-Truths
Whatever decision is made
should not be hidden behind
Moynihan Mystification â€” "most
blacks are middle-class now,"
there isn't as much need among
minorities as there used to be,"
etc., etc.
. When I first came here in 1969
as many as 200 students a year
used to take a course called
"Racism and Prejudice." Fewer
white students understand what
it's all about now and are likely to
say, "Ah, reverse racism is over;
equity has prevailed." Many of
our faculty and administration
have similar ideas. Maybe these
matters shouldn't concern them,
but, if so, they should stop
leaning on that book which
includes the words "woe unto
them that are at east in Zion."

we'll note that he, too, was
concerned that the action taken
should not reduce the total
proportion of minorities at
Stanford. He also said, "I am not
saying that we should seek to find
and admit only minority students
who find Stanford congenial in
every way." Some "mix" will
come only if there is a will to
make it so and measures to
achieve that goal are taken.
