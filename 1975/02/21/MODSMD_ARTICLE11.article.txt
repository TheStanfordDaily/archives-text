# Crime Can Pay

Colleges are closing or freezing
for lack of funds. Their libraries
are cancelling important
subscriptions. Their presses are
going bankrupt. Their scholars are
frustrated because they are
expected to publish books, but
even reputable publishers demand
something such as pornography
which sells.
Students are well aware of
these and other woes, yet all over
the country they are offering
sums as high as $4000 to
individuals whose only claim to
"fame" is that they were caught
in a silly crime and whose talks
add nothing to what the press has
already told us.
These invitations are a measure
of the degree of maturity of
student governments. They are
sometimes the result of the
infiltration of such governments
by activists whose aim is to create
hostility to U.S. government
(which really should be proud of
Watergate, since a world-wide
Watergate would be a splendid
purge).
Administrating Fear
Only in a few institutions have
the administration and faculty
spoken out on this issue. This is
partly because they are frightened
of the students, but they and the
students should realize that
criticism is not a one-way street.
On many campuses distinguished
scholars have been unable to
speak because of student
opposition.
As members of the community,
we have the obligation to speak
up on such matters. We cannot
wash our hands, as some
presidents have done, and say that
their administrations let students
choose their own speakers. They
have at least the right to express
an opinion.
Complicity
Allowing such speakers to use
university facilities involves
complicity and consent, although
not of course agreement with any
ideas expressed.
Nor should it be argued that
sometimes the fees are covered by
admission charges. If an academic
community has $4000 to spend,
there are urgent needs, and what
kind of a community is Academe
if it has no sense of priorities?
A time has come to put an end
to the habit of paying large fees to
any speakers. Many well-paid
senators and other public officials,
as well as some of ou" - well-known
faculty members, make large
supplementary incomes by going
on the lecture circuit when they
should be in Washington or on
their campuses attending to
business.
$100 Plus Expenses
For anyone with a spark of
idealism, lecture fees are a minor
consideration if one has
something to tell students. In this
period of austerity there should
be a national agreement that no
campus speaker will be paid more
than $100 and expenses.
By removing the trash, campus
lectures would recover some of
their lost prestige. Many
distinguished organizations such
as the Commonwealth Club of
San Francisco pay no fees to
speakers, and yet they attract the
most famous people in the world,
as well as attentive crowds.
It is regarded as an honor to
address them, and not simply as
what must be described as a
racket which discredits not only
the institutions but also the
United States; as Editor of the
World Affairs Report, I know
only too well how Soviet
propaganda loves to discredit this
country through its own
"spokesmen."
