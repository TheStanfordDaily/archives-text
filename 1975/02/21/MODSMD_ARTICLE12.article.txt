# 'Live Oak' Publishes Even Minus Weinstein
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
You may have missed Live Oak last week.
Well, fear not, another issue of that upstart
news-features weekly should hit the streets
today.
In the interim, Live Oak seems to have
weathered its first transition of power
and perhaps proved to the community that it is
a paper built on the talents of more than one
man.
Rumors flew thick last week that Live Oak
would fold because editor Bill Weinstein had
decided to call it quits.
These rumors carried a hefty amount of
credibility because Live Oak is Weinstein's
"brain child" and the two have been almost
inseparable from the beginning. During the
first months, Weinstein was both editor and
business manager for the fledgling paper.
Now, almost two quarters of publication
later, Weinstein has wearied of the burdens of
the editorship and has chosen to step down.
From all indications, his decision was a
personal one — not one forced upon him by a
rebellious editorial board. Editors emphasized
the move was "not a coup."
Most of the paper's staff seemed a bit
dismayed at Weinstein's decision, but they
also showed a determination to keep the
paper publishing.
Live Oak staffers met throughout last week
to determine the editorial course of the paper.
Today's issue will be the first indication of
their deliberations.
Managing Editor Charlie Hall said in an
interview last week that he looked for the
paper to move away from theme issues and
focus more on investigative journalism
balanced with features.
This approach should widen the paper's

readership appeal, if the stories are
well-written. A decline in quality now could
permanently damage Live Oak's reputation
among its readers and advertisers, as well as
demoralize the editorial itaff.
The publication also faces narrowing
financial straits. Winter is a bad season for
advertising,so advertisers say, and the paper
is already treading the financial tight wire.
it would be foolish to predict Live Oak's
demise, though. The publication has
continually fought hard for its existence. And
last week's editorial reshuffling looks like just
one more hurdle behind the paper now.
