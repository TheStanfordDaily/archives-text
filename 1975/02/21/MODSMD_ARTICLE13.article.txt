# What Role Should Lecture Notes Play?
## 
### BETSY MORRIS 
What is the role of the ASSU lecture notes
in the educational process of the Stanford
student?
According to Vic Petroff, director of the
project, the lectures are a relatively low cost
ASSU service offered to the students. Beyond
that, the ASSU's concern with the notes has
been primarily with the service's financial
success rather than with its educational value.
At the beginning of the quarter Petroffs
goal was to make the program financially
solvent. He hoped to collect an average of 70
subscriptions from each of the 14 classes in
which the notes were offered.
Petroff admits that the material content of
the course made little difference in deciding
which classes were selected.
Instead, larger classes were chosen because
they promised a greater number of
subscribers than did smaller seminars. The
largest classes happened to be some of the
most competitive, among them several biology
and chemistry classes.
Successful Project
Petroff considers the lecture project a
success this quarter. It has proved popular,
averaging far more than 70 subscriptions per
class. Financially it has netted over four times
the amount its sponsors had hoped.
But many others are seriously concerned
about the educational value of the notes and
their effect on the student.
Economics 1 Prof. George L. Bach was

hesitant about permitting the ASSU to cover
his class. His concern — "that people
wouldn't come to class" — has been shared by
Prof. Gordon Wright of History 3 and others.
Educational Process
Wright and Prof. Philip G. Zimbardo of
Psychology 1, who have both turned down
the service for next quarter, fear the notes
might cheapen the educational process by
encouraging, if not lack of attendance, at least
a lack of attention in class.
Curiously enough, students claim that the
lecture notes have not substantially affected
their educational involvement. Most

subscribers vouched both on the record and
off, that the notes had had little effect on
their class attendance.
Several students stressed that they not only
take notes in class, but they even continue
their traditional practice of recopying their
notes nightly.
Sounds Self-Serving
Some student and faculty skeptics doubt
the truth of the students' claims. Many agree
with Zimbardo that it all "sounds a little too
self-serving."
But judging the types of classes and the
nature of the students enrolled in them, there
may be more truth to the theory of notes as
reference rather than as the lazy way out.
Subscription levels for the notes are highest
in what students generally regard as Stanford's
most competitive classes, including Biology
22, Biology 108 and Human Biology 3A.
Students in these classes say they do not
directly feel pressured to subscribe to the
lecture notes. It seems the high degree of
competition in the courses may be an indirect
motivation to seek the ASSU lecture notes as
an extra reference. «
Currently students are using the lecture
notes as an extra resource rather than as a
substitute for lectures and notetaking. But as
the note service is expanded to cover less
competitive classes, and as students become
accustomed to depending upon them, this role
may change.

and chemistry classes.
Successful Project
Petroff considers the lecture project a
success this quarter. It has proved popular,
averaging far more than 70 subscriptions per
class. Financially it has netted over four times
the amount its sponsors had hoped.
But many others are seriously concerned
about the educational value of the notes and
their effect on the student.
Economics 1 Prof. George L. Bach was

hesitant about permitting the ASSU to cover
his class. His concern — "that people
wouldn't come to class" — has been shared by
Prof. Gordon Wright of History 3 and others.
Educational Process
Wright and Prof. Philip G. Zimbardo of
Psychology 1, who have both turned down
the service for next quarter, fear the notes
might cheapen the educational process by
encouraging, if not lack of attendance, at least
a lack of attention in class.
Curiously enough, students claim that the
lecture notes have not substantially affected
their educational involvement. Most

subscribers vouched both on the record and
off, that the notes had had little effect on
their class attendance.
Several students stressed that they not only
take notes in class, but they even continue
their traditional practice of recopying their
notes nightly.
Sounds Self-Serving
Some student and faculty skeptics doubt
the truth of the students' claims. Many agree
with Zimbardo that it all "sounds a little too
self-serving."
But judging the types of classes and the
nature of the students enrolled in them, there
may be more truth to the theory of notes as
reference rather than as the lazy way out.
Subscription levels for the notes are highest
in what students generally regard as Stanford's
most competitive classes, including Biology
22, Biology 108 and Human Biology 3A.
Students in these classes say they do not
directly feel pressured to subscribe to the
lecture notes. It seems the high degree of
competition in the courses may be an indirect
motivation to seek the ASSU lecture notes as
an extra reference. «
Currently students are using the lecture
notes as an extra resource rather than as a
substitute for lectures and notetaking. But as
the note service is expanded to cover less
competitive classes, and as students become
accustomed to depending upon them, this role
may change.

What is the role of the ASSU lecture notes
in the educational process of the Stanford
student?
According to Vic Petroff, director of the
project, the lectures are a relatively low cost
ASSU service offered to the students. Beyond
that, the ASSU's concern with the notes has
been primarily with the service's financial
success rather than with its educational value.
At the beginning of the quarter Petroffs
goal was to make the program financially
solvent. He hoped to collect an average of 70
subscriptions from each of the 14 classes in
which the notes were offered.
Petroff admits that the material content of
the course made little difference in deciding
which classes were selected.
Instead, larger classes were chosen because
they promised a greater number of
subscribers than did smaller seminars. The
largest classes happened to be some of the
most competitive, among them several biology
and chemistry classes.
