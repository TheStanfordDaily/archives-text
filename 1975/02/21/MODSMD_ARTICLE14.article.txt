# Parking Fee Meetings Raise Issues
## 
### AARON WEINER 
The most crucial questions raised by recent
conflicts over the $7.50 parking fee have not
yet been answered.
The issue at hand is not the exorbitance of
the charge — presently only two or three cents
per car, per day — so much as its inequity.
Most crucial of all is the need to lessen car
traffic on University property and supply
alternate modes of transportation.
These comments outline several complaints
and suggestions that have surfaced during the
recent public hearings on parking policies
here.
The task of conducting the hearings has
been that of Peter Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs.
His duty has been to get input from the
community concerning deficiencies and
redesign of the present parking system.

Separate hearings have been held for
faculty, staff, on-campus students, off-campus
students, non-drivers, and of course, the
distressed Escondido Village residents.
One point made at all of the hearings was
that the entire Stanford community should be
responsible for a parking fee, not just
students. Nevertheless, some staff members
argued that because they already pay street
taxes where they live, they shouldn't be
charged where they work.
Fee Proposals
Fee proposals included $5 per year, $50
per year, and no prescribed fee with pay
parking lots.
In fact, this last suggestion focuses on an
important dilemma of the present parking
situation on campus.
It is clear that certain lots near the nucleus
of campus (i.e. Crothers Memorial, Main

Library) are more in demand during the day
than others. Most students agreed that
something has to be done about priorities for
choice spaces.
One student suggested applying simply
supply-demand economics — charge higher
fees for lots with greater demand and make
them self enforcing with electric gate
entrances.
Carpenter also related that some schools
charge a parking fee inversely proportional to
the distance the person lives from campus.
Actually, there is not so much a physical
deficiency of parking spaces on the campus as
there are not enough parking places where
people want them.
Staff members who don't have to be at
work until late morning complained about
having to park as far as three blocks away
from their worklocation.This inconvenience is
magnified by foul weather and late-afternoon
darkness.
More Parking Surfaces
This complaint, in fact, suggests the
creation of more parking surfaces.
Meanwhile, non-drivers complained of
having to walk across a "sea" of pavement to
get anywhere. At one of the student hearings,
ASSU Sen. Peter Winsemius said he voiced
the common sentiment of the Senate by being
"against turning the place [the University]
into a big parking lot."
But does all of this discussion really deal
with sensible solutions for the problem at
hand?
So the University is eliminating parking
spaces in an attempt to cut down on cars
present on campus, yet no alternate
transportation is prevalent. At the same time,
students forced to live off campus are
pressured into buying cars.
The University pays "its fair share of
taxes," said one concerned staff member, yet
county transit services shy away (Dial -A-Bus
is available on campus, though scarcely used).
On the other hand, several respondents at
the hearings dreaded sacrificing convenience
of mobility by switching over to mass
transportation.
It has been made clear from these hearings
that more than just the parking fee must be
reviewed or revised; for instance, present
forms of transportation and the efficiency of
the road system.
"You expect a university to be a leading
edge in society; to set a progressive example,"
said one student at the non-drivers' hearing.
"Research-wise and scientifically, Stanford
plays the part, but socially, it does not."

reviewed or revised; for instance, present
forms of transportation and the efficiency of
the road system.
"You expect a university to be a leading
edge in society; to set a progressive example,"
said one student at the non-drivers' hearing.
"Research-wise and scientifically, Stanford
plays the part, but socially, it does not."
The most crucial questions raised by recent
conflicts over the $7.50 parking fee have not
yet been answered.
The issue at hand is not the exorbitance of
the charge — presently only two or three cents
per car, per day — so much as its inequity.
Most crucial of all is the need to lessen car
traffic on University property and supply
alternate modes of transportation.
These comments outline several complaints
and suggestions that have surfaced during the
recent public hearings on parking policies
here.
The task of conducting the hearings has
been that of Peter Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs.
His duty has been to get input from the
community concerning deficiencies and
redesign of the present parking system.

Separate hearings have been held for
faculty, staff, on-campus students, off-campus
students, non-drivers, and of course, the
distressed Escondido Village residents.
One point made at all of the hearings was
that the entire Stanford community should be
responsible for a parking fee, not just
students. Nevertheless, some staff members
argued that because they already pay street
taxes where they live, they shouldn't be
charged where they work.
Fee Proposals
Fee proposals included $5 per year, $50
per year, and no prescribed fee with pay
parking lots.
In fact, this last suggestion focuses on an
important dilemma of the present parking
situation on campus.
It is clear that certain lots near the nucleus
of campus (i.e. Crothers Memorial, Main

Library) are more in demand during the day
than others. Most students agreed that
something has to be done about priorities for
choice spaces.
One student suggested applying simply
supply-demand economics — charge higher
fees for lots with greater demand and make
them self enforcing with electric gate
entrances.
Carpenter also related that some schools
charge a parking fee inversely proportional to
the distance the person lives from campus.
Actually, there is not so much a physical
deficiency of parking spaces on the campus as
there are not enough parking places where
people want them.
Staff members who don't have to be at
work until late morning complained about
having to park as far as three blocks away
from their worklocation.This inconvenience is
magnified by foul weather and late-afternoon
darkness.
More Parking Surfaces
This complaint, in fact, suggests the
creation of more parking surfaces.
Meanwhile, non-drivers complained of
having to walk across a "sea" of pavement to
get anywhere. At one of the student hearings,
ASSU Sen. Peter Winsemius said he voiced
the common sentiment of the Senate by being
"against turning the place [the University]
into a big parking lot."
But does all of this discussion really deal
with sensible solutions for the problem at
hand?
So the University is eliminating parking
spaces in an attempt to cut down on cars
present on campus, yet no alternate
transportation is prevalent. At the same time,
students forced to live off campus are
pressured into buying cars.
The University pays "its fair share of
taxes," said one concerned staff member, yet
county transit services shy away (Dial -A-Bus
is available on campus, though scarcely used).
On the other hand, several respondents at
the hearings dreaded sacrificing convenience
of mobility by switching over to mass
transportation.
It has been made clear from these hearings
that more than just the parking fee must be
reviewed or revised; for instance, present
forms of transportation and the efficiency of
the road system.
