# Faculty Grants Concession On Financial Aid
## 
### JOHN FREED 
A week of charges, countercharges,
demonstrations and confusion was capped
yesterday when the Faculty Senate voted a
concession to minority students on financial
aid.
What the outcome of the Senate's vote will
be is uncertain — groups of minority students
met last night to determine whether they
approved the decision or not.
The controversy has centered around the
amount of "self-help" in the form of loans or
term-time jobs to be provided by minority
students. The Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid (C-UAFA)
suggested that very-low-income students
should be treated alike — regardless of race —
while middle/low income minority students
would get one-sixth off on self-help
requirements.
C-UAFA Chairman Paul Green defended
the committee's recommendations as
consistent.
"This isn't a matter of statistics or
ramifications or anything else," Green
declared. "It's a matter of internal
consistency. There's nothing more to it than
that."
But some faculty senators criticized the
proposal as inconsistent, because it did not
extend minority-student exemptions to the
very poor — "those who need it most."
The C-UAFA proposal would require $6200
in self-help for "standard" cases; $4600 for
minority students; $2400 for "highest
academic" students; and $2850 for all
very-low-income students.
The Faculty Senate rejected this last figure,
telling C-UAFA to set the figure at about
$2400 for very-low-income minority students.

Green said that C-UAFA had considered the
$2400 figure for that group, but eventually
rejected it.
"We decided that by a factor of two [from
$6200 to $2850 in self-help] is about as far as
we can go," Green explained. "You have to
ask, 'How much do you want to burden other
students?' "
In a statement released Tuesday, an Ethnic
Minority Task Force on Financial Aids
(EMTF-FA) urged the Faculty Senate Steering
Committee to "refer the document back to
C-UAFA so that discussion can continue with
the cooperation of Minority Task Force
representation."
Harold Boyd, associate dean of students
and one of the task force initiators, said
before yesterday's Senate meeting that he felt
the Senate would not overlook the task
force's report.
The Senate's action will help ameliorate
some of the problems forecast by minority
students, but did not answer the main
question posed by EMTF-FA: Was the
decision made too quickly without full access
to information?
"One never has full consideration," Green
lamented. "We have to do it every year on the
basis of the information we have."
C-UAFA took a few months to form its
judgment on the information available. The
Faculty Senate spent a few hours dealing with
the same material.
Whether the groups' hurried decisions will
prove too hasty remains to be seen.
