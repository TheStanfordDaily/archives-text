# Results From Heart Researchers Study
## Transplant Success More Predictable 
### ELIZABETH POLLOCK 
The likelihood of heart
transplant success has become
more predictable because of
recent work done by a Stanford
medical research team.
Drs. Alan S. Coulson, Fran
MacMillan, Randall B. Griepp,
Edward B. Stinson, Eugene Dong
Jr., and Norman E. Shumway
have been working together to
find a correlation between the

reaction of a patient's white blood
cells to foreign stimulants and the
likelihood of transplant rejection
by the patient's body.
Blood cultures containing
white blood cells were prepared
for each of 11 transplant
candidates during 1973. Antigens
were added to each sample to
determine whether the patient's
white cells would try to immunize
the body against the foreign

stimuli.
If the cells responded by
transforming into larger cells that
would fight the introduced
stimuli, the patient was
considered to have a high profile.
If the cells did not react strongly,
the patient had a low profile.
A high profile was found to
correlate with increased likelihood
of rejection in transplant cases as
the white cells would be more

likely to immunize the body
against the foreign tissue.
The researchers' results
appeared in the November 1974,
issue of Transplantation magazine.
Since March 1974, the team has
been trying to predict transplant
success based on their research.
A total of 16 transplants have
been performed since last March,
but prediction data are presently
available for only 10 patients.
Two of those were predicted to
face problems of rejection based on
their high profiles. One received a
transplant last April 27 and died
of late rejection Jan. 15. The
other received a first transplant
last Aug. 19 but had to undergo a
second operation last Oct. 15. He
is still alive.
Patients with high profiles face
a difficult decision as their
alternative to transplantation is
probably imminent death.

Presently Shumway makes the
decision whether the operation is
to be performed.
The prediction procedure is
not yet developed enough for
potential legal implications to
have surfaced.
Stanford's transplant team has
performed 79 heart transplants
since Shumway did the first on
Jan. 6,1968.
