CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) - John W.
Dean 111 says criticism that he is earning large
lecture fees for talking about his criminal
involvement in Watergate may lead him to cancel a
nationwide speaking tour of college campuses.
Dean, who was the first person to detail
President Richard M. Nixon's role in Watergate,
opened the nine-week tour at the University of
Virginia last week drawing about 5000 persons,
mostly students.
The 35-year-old former White House counsel is
scheduled to speak at about 40 colleges from Maine
to California. There have been calls at some schools
for a boycott of Dean. Each appearance earns him
between $3000 and $4000.
Andy Leuchter, director of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, stated that he had considered inviting Dean
here "until we heard the price."
Leuchter said, "Dean wanted $3500 plus
expenses and with our budget [$10,000 for the
year] it was an automatic rejection."
He added that it "never got to the point where
we had to consider the moral aspects" of helping
someone profit from Watergate. However, he
claimed the reaction in the Bureau would have been
mixed if the money had been available.
At Virginia, Dean had no prepared text and

spoke from notes for about 20 minutes. For the
remainder of his one hour appearance, Dean took
questions from the floor, answering in relaxed
tones while seated in a large, red leather chair. He
received applause four times.
Dean was released from prison Jan. 8 after
serving four months of a one-to-four year term for
his confessed role in the Watergate cover-up.
Dean told his student audience that while he
questioned the timing of the pardon granted Nixon
he never doubted that Nixon should go free.
"I for one never want to see a former president
no matter who he is go to jail," he said. If Nixon
were agreeable, Dean said he would like to meet
with him to tell the former president of what Dean
said were the many positive achievements of the
Nixon administration.
Dean said his motive was to speak out so that
"others might profit from what I learned about my
own blinded ambition of yesterday."
As Dean's audience filed into the Virginia
fieldhouse they were greeted by about 25 pickets
urging a boycott.
They carried signs saying "Four Thousand Pieces
of Silver," "Do You Really Think Hell Tell The
Truth Tonight?" "The Bigger the Crime the Bigger
the Payoff," and "Who Says Crime Doesn't Pay?"

Dean said his motive was to speak out so that
"others might profit from what I learned about my
own blinded ambition of yesterday."
As Dean's audience filed into the Virginia
fieldhouse they were greeted by about 25 pickets
urging a boycott.
They carried signs saying "Four Thousand Pieces
of Silver," "Do You Really Think Hell Tell The
Truth Tonight?" "The Bigger the Crime the Bigger
the Payoff," and "Who Says Crime Doesn't Pay?"
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) - John W.
Dean 111 says criticism that he is earning large
lecture fees for talking about his criminal
involvement in Watergate may lead him to cancel a
nationwide speaking tour of college campuses.
Dean, who was the first person to detail
President Richard M. Nixon's role in Watergate,
opened the nine-week tour at the University of
Virginia last week drawing about 5000 persons,
mostly students.
The 35-year-old former White House counsel is
scheduled to speak at about 40 colleges from Maine
to California. There have been calls at some schools
for a boycott of Dean. Each appearance earns him
between $3000 and $4000.
Andy Leuchter, director of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, stated that he had considered inviting Dean
here "until we heard the price."
Leuchter said, "Dean wanted $3500 plus
expenses and with our budget [$10,000 for the
year] it was an automatic rejection."
He added that it "never got to the point where
we had to consider the moral aspects" of helping
someone profit from Watergate. However, he
claimed the reaction in the Bureau would have been
mixed if the money had been available.
At Virginia, Dean had no prepared text and

spoke from notes for about 20 minutes. For the
remainder of his one hour appearance, Dean took
questions from the floor, answering in relaxed
tones while seated in a large, red leather chair. He
received applause four times.
Dean was released from prison Jan. 8 after
serving four months of a one-to-four year term for
his confessed role in the Watergate cover-up.
Dean told his student audience that while he
questioned the timing of the pardon granted Nixon
he never doubted that Nixon should go free.
"I for one never want to see a former president
no matter who he is go to jail," he said. If Nixon
were agreeable, Dean said he would like to meet
with him to tell the former president of what Dean
said were the many positive achievements of the
Nixon administration.
Dean said his motive was to speak out so that
"others might profit from what I learned about my
own blinded ambition of yesterday."
As Dean's audience filed into the Virginia
fieldhouse they were greeted by about 25 pickets
urging a boycott.
They carried signs saying "Four Thousand Pieces
of Silver," "Do You Really Think Hell Tell The
Truth Tonight?" "The Bigger the Crime the Bigger
the Payoff," and "Who Says Crime Doesn't Pay?"
