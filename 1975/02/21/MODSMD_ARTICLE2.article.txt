# SLA Had Dossier On Trustee
## 
### 
A dossier on Stanford Trustee Peter
E. Haas was among selected
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA)
documents released in Alameda
County Superior Court Wednesday.
The SLA kept detailed files on
more than two dozen prominent Bay
Area industrialists and financiers,
including Haas, who is president of
Levi Strauss and Co.
Haas could not be reached for
comment by the Daily last night.
Yesterday's San Francisco
Examiner reported that "sources close
to the investigation said the names
were marked for some kind of action
by the SLA," but did not disclose
what those goals might have been.
Another list also released
Wednesday included the names of five
other "possible people to snatch in
order to deliver food to the
community." These included two
bankers, two businessmen and Owsley
Hammond, the treasurer of the
University of California Board of
Regents.
Pre-Trial Hearing
The dossiers and the kidnap list
were introduced into evidence by the
prosecution during pre-trial hearings
for SLA members Russell Little and
Joseph Remiro, who are accused of
murdering Oakland School
Superintendent Marcus A. Foster on
Nov. 6, 1973.
FBI agents discovered the
documents during a search of an SLA
hideout in Los Angeles last May. The
hideout was empty when police and
FBI agents arrived, but it held an
estimated 2000 pieces of evidence.
Another of the SLA dossiers was on
Charles Theriot, publisher and editor
of the San Francisco Chronicle and
president of television station
KRON-TV (Channel 4). Theriot is a
business associate and friend of San
Francisco Examiner President and
Editor Randolph A. Hearst, whose
daughter Patty was allegedly kidnaped
by the SLA on Feb. 4, 1974.
Joined SLA
Patty subsequently claimed that she
had joined the SLA. She and
self-proclaimed SLA members William
and Emily Harris are still at large and
wanted by the FBI.
The documents came to light while
Superior Court Judge Gordon Minder
was hearing a motion by attorneys for
Little and Remiro to suppress the
evidence in their upcoming murder
trial, on the ground that it was seized
illegally.
