George Harrison
Dark Horse
Apple SMAF 3148
This album bears the
distinction of being the worst ever
released by an ex-Beatle. Even
Paul McCartney's Red Rose
Speedway can't compare with
Dark Horse for sheer
embarassment.
The worst thing about Horse is
that Harrison's backup musicians,
by playing only competently,
make Harrison sound terrible. A
few clavinet chords by Billy
Preston or a simple Robben Ford
guitar lick are enough to cause the
uneasy feeling that Harrison might
just be a total hack.
The title tune, for instance, is a
nice composition, and Tom Scott
plays a smooth flute line, but ugh!
— the vocal sounds like the last
groans of a dying something-or
other, and the song changes from
pleasant to unlistenable.
Add one of the most silly,
maudlin ideas in pop music
history — Harrison joining his
estranged wife Patty and her
current lover Eric Clapton for a
performance of "Bye, Bye Love"
— and already the record is
something of a disaster.

Even when Harrison doesn't
sing, as on "Hari's On Tour —
Express," the results are at best a
bore, and even the least offensive
material is hardly of album
quality.
Of course, there is the idiotic
ditty "Ding Dong Ding Dong,"
which was released as a single.
This song, with lyrics that fit its
title, sounds like a reject from a
Ringo Starr session.
So Joe Cocker can move over
— he's no match for George as the
most ravished singer around.

Charlie Musselwhite
Goin' Back Down South
Arhoolie 1074
Night club appearances by
blues harpist Charlie Musselwhite
are generally hang loose affairs.
Charlie usually sits drinking at a
corner table while the band, with
slight personnel variations from
night to night, lays down a couple
of warm-up numbers.
The group looks to their leader
after each song; he continues to
signal them to do one more
number, and ambles up to the
stage by the third or fourth tune
without fanfare save "How 'bout
a hand for the band? Ain't they
fine?" which draws scattered
applause.
But last August on a Saturday
morning, Charlie was up bright
and early at Wally Heider Studios
in San Francisco laying down
track after tack for his
newly-released Arhoolie LP, Goin'
Back Down South. He was
relaxed, straight (downing club
sodas), and creative; takin' care of
business, to use one of his own
favorite expressions.
The spur-of-the-moment
session came about when Willie
Dixon's Blues Band came to town
and Arhoolie's Chris Strackwitz
recruited pianist Lafayette Leake
to join Charlie in a few numbers.
A feeling of mutual respect and
kinship was evident between
Charlie and Lafayette, old blues
colleagues from Chicago. Charlie's
young rhythm section — Tim
Kaihatsu (guitar), Karl Severeid
(bass), Larry Martin (drums) —
looked on with high esteeem, and
Charlie rose to the occasion.

The quintet ran through 10
numbers in three hours, recording
most in one take, seven of which
appear on the album.
The two remaining cuts were
done four years ago for the Takin'
My Time session (Arhoolie 1056)
which coupled Charlie with
guitarist-saxophonist Robben
Ford, now a member of the L.A.
Express (having backed rock stars
Joni Mitchell and George Harrison
last year).
Ford's musical genius and
knack for inspiring added
enthusiasm in fellow musicians is
evidenced by the fact that his two
contributions are the best tunes
on the LP. "Blue Stu," his own
instrumental contribution,
features unison duets with
Charlie's harp and Ford's alto, and
is probably the album's best track
overall.
Further variety is added with
the premier of Charlie
Musselwhite as a guitarist on two
selections from the more recent
session. "Blue Steel" shows
Charlie to be a tasty slide guitarist
in the Earl Hooker vein, while
"Taylors, Arkansas" illustrates
Charlie's background in country
blues.
Lafayette meanwhile comes
close to stealing the show
altogether, with his rocking "On
the Spot Boogie" which was
composed as the title indicates.
Possibly the best of Charlie's
even albums, this one should be a
must for blues and jazz fans.

Slow Motion
United Artists LA34SG
People who have spent years in
the music industry often judge an
album's worth by the amount of
money and effort expended in its
packaging. When a company goes
to the extra expense of making
sure a record is packaged
attractively and has extensive liner
notes for a product, it is a good
bet that the music is good.
That is to say that at least in
this case, you can judge the record
by its cover. The cover art on
Slow Motion depicts Alfred E.
Newman playing guitar on a fish.
It's super, and so is the disc.

The Man band hails from Wales
and is inspired by zany Deke
Leonard, a superlative guitarist
and songwriter, who's appeared
on perhaps a dozen albums with
various performers. This is his
best.
The album is based on a
standard rock format. Four songs
to a side, four to five minutes
each, and lots of lyrics about love,
women and music. The only thing
exceptional about this album is its
overall quality. Each of the eight
tunes is memorable for its own
merit, and indeed every cut has
gotten airplay.
The most popular song is
"Rainbow Eyes," a ballad about a
believable "superchick" who has
them. The lyrics are displayed on
a background of acoustic guitars
and understated keyboards and as
on the rest of the album, they
shine.
"She thinks she going crazy,
but that's just her disguise,
she goes through fire and water,
but gets hurt with people's lies. .."
The lead and backup vocals are
consistently flawless, and they fit
well with Leonard's simple but
catchy guitar riffs — but the
success of the work lies in the
material. Man has written, sung
and produced eight great songs.

DARK HORSE—George Harrison's new album may make him a very dark horse in the music world.

exceptional about this album is its
overall quality. Each of the eight
tunes is memorable for its own
merit, and indeed every cut has
gotten airplay.
The most popular song is
"Rainbow Eyes," a ballad about a
believable "superchick" who has
them. The lyrics are displayed on
a background of acoustic guitars
and understated keyboards and as
on the rest of the album, they
shine.
"She thinks she going crazy,
but that's just her disguise,
she goes through fire and water,
but gets hurt with people's lies. .."
The lead and backup vocals are
consistently flawless, and they fit
well with Leonard's simple but
catchy guitar riffs — but the
success of the work lies in the
material. Man has written, sung
and produced eight great songs.

DARK HORSE—George Harrison's new album may make him a very dark horse in the music world.
Despite such talented sidemen as Billy Preston, Tom Scott and Eric Clapton, the record is less than a
success.
George Harrison
Dark Horse
Apple SMAF 3148
This album bears the
distinction of being the worst ever
released by an ex-Beatle. Even
Paul McCartney's Red Rose
Speedway can't compare with
Dark Horse for sheer
embarassment.
The worst thing about Horse is
that Harrison's backup musicians,
by playing only competently,
make Harrison sound terrible. A
few clavinet chords by Billy
Preston or a simple Robben Ford
guitar lick are enough to cause the
uneasy feeling that Harrison might
just be a total hack.
The title tune, for instance, is a
nice composition, and Tom Scott
plays a smooth flute line, but ugh!
— the vocal sounds like the last
groans of a dying something-or
other, and the song changes from
pleasant to unlistenable.
Add one of the most silly,
maudlin ideas in pop music
history — Harrison joining his
estranged wife Patty and her
current lover Eric Clapton for a
performance of "Bye, Bye Love"
— and already the record is
something of a disaster.

Even when Harrison doesn't
sing, as on "Hari's On Tour —
Express," the results are at best a
bore, and even the least offensive
material is hardly of album
quality.
Of course, there is the idiotic
ditty "Ding Dong Ding Dong,"
which was released as a single.
This song, with lyrics that fit its
title, sounds like a reject from a
Ringo Starr session.
So Joe Cocker can move over
— he's no match for George as the
most ravished singer around.

Charlie Musselwhite
Goin' Back Down South
Arhoolie 1074
Night club appearances by
blues harpist Charlie Musselwhite
are generally hang loose affairs.
Charlie usually sits drinking at a
corner table while the band, with
slight personnel variations from
night to night, lays down a couple
of warm-up numbers.
The group looks to their leader
after each song; he continues to
signal them to do one more
number, and ambles up to the
stage by the third or fourth tune
without fanfare save "How 'bout
a hand for the band? Ain't they
fine?" which draws scattered
applause.
But last August on a Saturday
morning, Charlie was up bright
and early at Wally Heider Studios
in San Francisco laying down
track after tack for his
newly-released Arhoolie LP, Goin'
Back Down South. He was
relaxed, straight (downing club
sodas), and creative; takin' care of
business, to use one of his own
favorite expressions.
The spur-of-the-moment
session came about when Willie
Dixon's Blues Band came to town
and Arhoolie's Chris Strackwitz
recruited pianist Lafayette Leake
to join Charlie in a few numbers.
A feeling of mutual respect and
kinship was evident between
Charlie and Lafayette, old blues
colleagues from Chicago. Charlie's
young rhythm section — Tim
Kaihatsu (guitar), Karl Severeid
(bass), Larry Martin (drums) —
looked on with high esteeem, and
Charlie rose to the occasion.

The quintet ran through 10
numbers in three hours, recording
most in one take, seven of which
appear on the album.
The two remaining cuts were
done four years ago for the Takin'
My Time session (Arhoolie 1056)
which coupled Charlie with
guitarist-saxophonist Robben
Ford, now a member of the L.A.
Express (having backed rock stars
Joni Mitchell and George Harrison
last year).
Ford's musical genius and
knack for inspiring added
enthusiasm in fellow musicians is
evidenced by the fact that his two
contributions are the best tunes
on the LP. "Blue Stu," his own
instrumental contribution,
features unison duets with
Charlie's harp and Ford's alto, and
is probably the album's best track
overall.
Further variety is added with
the premier of Charlie
Musselwhite as a guitarist on two
selections from the more recent
session. "Blue Steel" shows
Charlie to be a tasty slide guitarist
in the Earl Hooker vein, while
"Taylors, Arkansas" illustrates
Charlie's background in country
blues.
Lafayette meanwhile comes
close to stealing the show
altogether, with his rocking "On
the Spot Boogie" which was
composed as the title indicates.
Possibly the best of Charlie's
even albums, this one should be a
must for blues and jazz fans.

People who have spent years in
the music industry often judge an
album's worth by the amount of
money and effort expended in its
packaging. When a company goes
to the extra expense of making
sure a record is packaged
attractively and has extensive liner
notes for a product, it is a good
bet that the music is good.
That is to say that at least in
this case, you can judge the record
by its cover. The cover art on
Slow Motion depicts Alfred E.
Newman playing guitar on a fish.
It's super, and so is the disc.

The Man band hails from Wales
and is inspired by zany Deke
Leonard, a superlative guitarist
and songwriter, who's appeared
on perhaps a dozen albums with
various performers. This is his
best.
The album is based on a
standard rock format. Four songs
to a side, four to five minutes
each, and lots of lyrics about love,
women and music. The only thing
exceptional about this album is its
overall quality. Each of the eight
tunes is memorable for its own

People who have spent years in
the music industry often judge an
album's worth by the amount of
money and effort expended in its
packaging. When a company goes
to the extra expense of making
sure a record is packaged
attractively and has extensive liner
notes for a product, it is a good
bet that the music is good.
That is to say that at least in
this case, you can judge the record
by its cover. The cover art on
Slow Motion depicts Alfred E.
Newman playing guitar on a fish.
It's super, and so is the disc.

The Man band hails from Wales
and is inspired by zany Deke
Leonard, a superlative guitarist
and songwriter, who's appeared
on perhaps a dozen albums with
various performers. This is his
best.
The album is based on a
standard rock format. Four songs
to a side, four to five minutes
each, and lots of lyrics about love,
women and music. The only thing
exceptional about this album is its
overall quality. Each of the eight
tunes is memorable for its own
merit, and indeed every cut has
gotten airplay.
The most popular song is
"Rainbow Eyes," a ballad about a
believable "superchick" who has
them. The lyrics are displayed on
a background of acoustic guitars
and understated keyboards and as
on the rest of the album, they
shine.
"She thinks she going crazy,
but that's just her disguise,
she goes through fire and water,
but gets hurt with people's lies. .."
The lead and backup vocals are
consistently flawless, and they fit
well with Leonard's simple but
catchy guitar riffs — but the
success of the work lies in the
material. Man has written, sung
and produced eight great songs.

DARK HORSE—George Harrison's new album may make him a very dark horse in the music world.
Despite such talented sidemen as Billy Preston, Tom Scott and Eric Clapton, the record is less than a
success.
George Harrison
Dark Horse
Apple SMAF 3148
This album bears the
distinction of being the worst ever
released by an ex-Beatle. Even
Paul McCartney's Red Rose
Speedway can't compare with
Dark Horse for sheer
embarassment.
The worst thing about Horse is
that Harrison's backup musicians,
by playing only competently,
make Harrison sound terrible. A
few clavinet chords by Billy
Preston or a simple Robben Ford
guitar lick are enough to cause the
uneasy feeling that Harrison might
just be a total hack.
The title tune, for instance, is a
nice composition, and Tom Scott
plays a smooth flute line, but ugh!
— the vocal sounds like the last
groans of a dying something-or
other, and the song changes from
pleasant to unlistenable.
Add one of the most silly,
maudlin ideas in pop music
history — Harrison joining his
estranged wife Patty and her
current lover Eric Clapton for a
performance of "Bye, Bye Love"
— and already the record is
something of a disaster.

Even when Harrison doesn't
sing, as on "Hari's On Tour —
Express," the results are at best a
bore, and even the least offensive
material is hardly of album
quality.
Of course, there is the idiotic
ditty "Ding Dong Ding Dong,"
which was released as a single.
This song, with lyrics that fit its
title, sounds like a reject from a
Ringo Starr session.
So Joe Cocker can move over
— he's no match for George as the
most ravished singer around.

Charlie Musselwhite
Goin' Back Down South
Arhoolie 1074
Night club appearances by
blues harpist Charlie Musselwhite
are generally hang loose affairs.
Charlie usually sits drinking at a
corner table while the band, with
slight personnel variations from
night to night, lays down a couple
of warm-up numbers.
The group looks to their leader
after each song; he continues to
signal them to do one more
number, and ambles up to the
stage by the third or fourth tune
without fanfare save "How 'bout
a hand for the band? Ain't they
fine?" which draws scattered
applause.
But last August on a Saturday
morning, Charlie was up bright
and early at Wally Heider Studios
in San Francisco laying down
track after tack for his
newly-released Arhoolie LP, Goin'
Back Down South. He was
relaxed, straight (downing club
sodas), and creative; takin' care of
business, to use one of his own
favorite expressions.
The spur-of-the-moment
session came about when Willie
Dixon's Blues Band came to town
and Arhoolie's Chris Strackwitz
recruited pianist Lafayette Leake
to join Charlie in a few numbers.
A feeling of mutual respect and
kinship was evident between
Charlie and Lafayette, old blues
colleagues from Chicago. Charlie's
young rhythm section — Tim
Kaihatsu (guitar), Karl Severeid
(bass), Larry Martin (drums) —
looked on with high esteeem, and
Charlie rose to the occasion.

The quintet ran through 10
numbers in three hours, recording
most in one take, seven of which
appear on the album.
The two remaining cuts were
done four years ago for the Takin'
My Time session (Arhoolie 1056)
which coupled Charlie with
guitarist-saxophonist Robben
Ford, now a member of the L.A.
Express (having backed rock stars
Joni Mitchell and George Harrison
last year).
Ford's musical genius and
knack for inspiring added
enthusiasm in fellow musicians is
evidenced by the fact that his two
contributions are the best tunes
on the LP. "Blue Stu," his own
instrumental contribution,
features unison duets with
Charlie's harp and Ford's alto, and
is probably the album's best track
overall.
Further variety is added with
the premier of Charlie
Musselwhite as a guitarist on two
selections from the more recent
session. "Blue Steel" shows
Charlie to be a tasty slide guitarist
in the Earl Hooker vein, while
"Taylors, Arkansas" illustrates
Charlie's background in country
blues.
Lafayette meanwhile comes
close to stealing the show
altogether, with his rocking "On
the Spot Boogie" which was
composed as the title indicates.
Possibly the best of Charlie's
even albums, this one should be a
must for blues and jazz fans.
