# Christo Speaks
## 
### 
Christo, the artist who a
few years ago suspended a
massive nylon curtain across
Rifle Gap, Colorado, will
present a lecture/slide show at
3 p.m., Wednesday, Feb. 26 in
San Jose State University's
Loma Prieta Room, Student
Union.
The lecture, open to the
public without charge, will
include a showing of the
Maysles Brothers' film of the
"Valley Curtain" and slides of
the "Running Fence," his new
project in California.
The "Running Fence" is a
24-mile white nylon screen
that will run from Petaluma
to the ocean. It has sparked
controversy between local
residents and proponents of the
project, one of whom is Harry
Hopkins, Director of the San
Francisco Museum of Art.
