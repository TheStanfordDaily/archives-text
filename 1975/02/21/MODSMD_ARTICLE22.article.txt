# S.F. Symphony Nearly Perfect
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
A symphony orchestra is often
as good as its conductor, and
Wednesday night's San Francisco
Symphony concert was a good
illustration of this.
Guest conductor Zdenek Macal
and the Orchestra created an
evening of musical perfection and
possibly one of the best concerts
of the season.
They opened with Haydn's
Symphony No. 91 in E Flat
Major, a work that exemplifies the
classical symphonic form of the
18th century.
The symphony was performed
neatly and flawlessly. Intonation
and phrasing were perfect, and the
vivid dynamic contrasts further
enhanced the piece. The Andante
was particularly light and
buoyant, highlighting the themes
and variations. Haydn would have
been pleased with this expressive
interpretation.
For a complete change of
mood and century, the Orchestra
performed Roussel's Bacchus et
Ariane, Suite No. 2. Premiered in
1936, the piece portrays a range

of emotions from the mysterious
and melancholy to a tempestuous,
feverish excitement.
Again, the Orchestra
performed flawlessly. Nearly
every instrument has a solo in the
work, and the soloists proved
their fine musicianship. Special
note should go to the trumpets
for their fine performances.
The Orchestra closed with,
again, a flawless performance of
Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 h
A Major, Opus 92. In 1813, its
second performance in Germany
met with astounding success
partially because of the political
events of the times. Napoleon had

just been defeated, and the
Germans were in a state of
ecstatic excitement. Beethoven's
Seventh was a perfect musical
interpretation of their emotions.
Macal exhibited no less genius
with his interpretation. He led the
Orchestra in a powerful, joyous
performance that earned cheers
and a standing ovation.
Young Macal, from
Czechoslovakia, made his San
Francisco conducting debut with
the Orchestra Wednesday night,
and he should be greatly pleased
with his results.
