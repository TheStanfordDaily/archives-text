# Panov Debut Sparks S.F. Ballet
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
SAN FRANCISCO—The
winter/spring season of the San
Francisco Ballet opened in the
War Memorial Opera House two
weeks ago, and the audience had
at least two good reasons to stand
up and cheer.
The first was consistently
high quality of the company's
dancing, in spite of some rather
boring choreography.
The second was the Bay Area
debut of former Kirov stars
Valery and Galina Panov.
The Panovs reportedly chose to
dance in San Francisco to thank
the Bay Area Council on Soviet
Jewry, one of many American
support groups that campaigned
for their release from the Soviet
Union.
Charming Pas
However, the Panovs' charming
interpretation of the Harlequinade
pas de deux left no doubt that
they are first-rate artists as well as
political celebrities.
Panov choreographed the pas
de deux, based on a full-length
ballet by Marius Petipa. The lilting

commedia dell'arte spirit of the
work gave both dancers an
excellent opportunity to display
both dramatic skill and
spectacular dancing talent.
Although Mrs. Panov's heavy
black and white costume was less
than flattering to her somewhat
chunky build, her doll-like
blondeness enhanced her
coquettish interpretation of
Columbine.
She thrilled the audience with
unbelievable high extensions and
quick turns, but her style is
ground in strength, not bravado.
One has only to watch her
supporting foot and ankle
working against the floor to
realize the technical strength that
made her one of the Kirov's rising
stars.
Short Performance
There was little to criticize in
Panov's performance, except that
it was far too short. From the
moment he appeared on stage he
remained perfectly in character as
Harlequin, the lovesick young
swain who plays pranks on
Columbine's father in order to
win her hand. He wore a black
mask that gave him the appearance
of a rakish raccoon.
The most memorable moment
of his solo was a sequence of
jet-propelled leaps in which his
legs seemed to flail in every
possible direction before he again
touched ground. But his variation
was not merely a collection of
gymnastic feats — every move
oozed with Harlequin's love for
Columbine.
As the audience leaped to its
feet clapping and cheering, the
Panovs remained in character and
took their bows as lovesick
pranksters, not international
dance superstars. It was the most
spontaneous, most entertaining
curtain call this reviewer has seen.

The Panovs were unable to
practice dancing during their
two-year struggle to leave the
U.S.S.R. together. Because their
appearance was so brief, it is
impossible to say whether the
lapse affected their endurance.
But their technical ability to
dance remains strong and their
stage presence is almost
triumphant.
Michael Filipov, another Soviet
dancer who defected several years
ago and later joined the San
Francisco Ballet, delivered the
most moving performance of the
evening in For Valery Panov. The
solo work was choreographed by
the company's associate artistic
director, Michael Smuin, as a
tribute to Panov.
It was first danced in 1973,
shortly after Panov applied for an
exit visa to Israel. He was fired
from the Kirov, and then granted
permission to leave — but without
his wife. Panov continued to
struggle for her release, refusing to
leave her behind. The Panovs
finally received permission to
leave the U.S.S.R. last June.
Ordeal
For Valery Panov, set to
driving music by Rachmaninoff, is
a moving interpretation of Panov's
ordeal. Panov is portrayed in
Russian costume, first dancing
joyously about the stage and then
suddenly discovering that he is
trapped.
Filipov's performance was
chilling as he slapped his palms
against the sides of an invisible
box and struggled to free his
bound wrists. The lights dimmed
slowly and dissolved to blackness
just after Filipov raised his arms,
half-pleading, half-defiant.
When the lights came up,
Filipov ripped the rope from his
wrists and threw it on the floor.
Panov dashed on stage to embrace

him, but stopped to pick up the
rope and hurl it into the wings. It
was an appropriate symbol.
Learning Plans
Panov reportedly plans to learn
For Valery Panov and dance it at
a future concert. He also hopes to
begin doing some choreography.
It is not known whether he will
choose to work in San Francisco,
but if his debut here was an
indication, his creativity would
provide just the kind of spark the
San Francisco Ballet now needs.
In their opening performance
the company's dancers far
outclassed the choreography in
the works they performed. The
opening number, Variations de
Ballet was pretty, but bland. If
attempted by a company with
dancers of lesser ability, it would
put the audience to sleep. But fine
dancing by Betsy Erickson, Vane
Vest, Filipov and Diana Weber
kept nearly everyone awake.
Watching the company's
leading ballerina, Linda Meyer,
dance the leading role in Beauty
and the Beast was like watching

Chris Evert at the baseline. Like
Evert, Meyer does everything
right. She dances smoothly and
even managed to bring some
depth to a seemingly superficial
role. She is dependable, but not
dazzling.
The potential of the company
was evidenced by Robert
Gladstein as the Beast and John
McFall as the marmoset. Anita
Paciotti and Damara Bennet
provided some amusing moments
as Beauty's ugly and obnoxious
sisters. But most of the dancers
are not given a chance to perform
choreography that will capitalize
on the full extent of their talents.
Now that the company's
financial and management
structure is on firmer ground, one
can only hope that artistic
director Lew Christiansen will
take some bold steps in the
direction of artistic innovation.
Only then will the San
Francisco Ballet make the
from a good company to a great
one.

made her one of the Kirov's rising
stars.
Short Performance
There was little to criticize in
Panov's performance, except that
it was far too short. From the
moment he appeared on stage he
remained perfectly in character as
Harlequin, the lovesick young
swain who plays pranks on
Columbine's father in order to
win her hand. He wore a black
mask that gave him the appearance
of a rakish raccoon.
The most memorable moment
of his solo was a sequence of
jet-propelled leaps in which his
legs seemed to flail in every
possible direction before he again
touched ground. But his variation
was not merely a collection of
gymnastic feats — every move
oozed with Harlequin's love for
Columbine.
As the audience leaped to its
feet clapping and cheering, the
Panovs remained in character and
took their bows as lovesick
pranksters, not international
dance superstars. It was the most
spontaneous, most entertaining
curtain call this reviewer has seen.

The Panovs were unable to
practice dancing during their
two-year struggle to leave the
U.S.S.R. together. Because their
appearance was so brief, it is
impossible to say whether the
lapse affected their endurance.
But their technical ability to
dance remains strong and their
stage presence is almost
triumphant.
Michael Filipov, another Soviet
dancer who defected several years
ago and later joined the San
Francisco Ballet, delivered the
most moving performance of the
evening in For Valery Panov. The
solo work was choreographed by
the company's associate artistic
director, Michael Smuin, as a
tribute to Panov.
It was first danced in 1973,
shortly after Panov applied for an
exit visa to Israel. He was fired
from the Kirov, and then granted
permission to leave — but without
his wife. Panov continued to
struggle for her release, refusing to
leave her behind. The Panovs
finally received permission to
leave the U.S.S.R. last June.
Ordeal
For Valery Panov, set to
driving music by Rachmaninoff, is
a moving interpretation of Panov's
ordeal. Panov is portrayed in
Russian costume, first dancing
joyously about the stage and then
suddenly discovering that he is
trapped.
Filipov's performance was
chilling as he slapped his palms
against the sides of an invisible
box and struggled to free his
bound wrists. The lights dimmed
slowly and dissolved to blackness
just after Filipov raised his arms,
half-pleading, half-defiant.
When the lights came up,
Filipov ripped the rope from his
wrists and threw it on the floor.
Panov dashed on stage to embrace

him, but stopped to pick up the
rope and hurl it into the wings. It
was an appropriate symbol.
Learning Plans
Panov reportedly plans to learn
For Valery Panov and dance it at
a future concert. He also hopes to
begin doing some choreography.
It is not known whether he will
choose to work in San Francisco,
but if his debut here was an
indication, his creativity would
provide just the kind of spark the
San Francisco Ballet now needs.
In their opening performance
the company's dancers far
outclassed the choreography in
the works they performed. The
opening number, Variations de
Ballet was pretty, but bland. If
attempted by a company with
dancers of lesser ability, it would
put the audience to sleep. But fine
dancing by Betsy Erickson, Vane
Vest, Filipov and Diana Weber
kept nearly everyone awake.
Watching the company's
leading ballerina, Linda Meyer,
dance the leading role in Beauty
and the Beast was like watching

Chris Evert at the baseline. Like
Evert, Meyer does everything
right. She dances smoothly and
even managed to bring some
depth to a seemingly superficial
role. She is dependable, but not
dazzling.
The potential of the company
was evidenced by Robert
Gladstein as the Beast and John
McFall as the marmoset. Anita
Paciotti and Damara Bennet
provided some amusing moments
as Beauty's ugly and obnoxious
sisters. But most of the dancers
are not given a chance to perform
choreography that will capitalize
on the full extent of their talents.
Now that the company's
financial and management
structure is on firmer ground, one
can only hope that artistic
director Lew Christiansen will
take some bold steps in the
direction of artistic innovation.
Only then will the San
Francisco Ballet make the
from a good company to a great
one.
SAN FRANCISCO—The
winter/spring season of the San
Francisco Ballet opened in the
War Memorial Opera House two
weeks ago, and the audience had
at least two good reasons to stand
up and cheer.
The first was consistently
high quality of the company's
dancing, in spite of some rather
boring choreography.
The second was the Bay Area
debut of former Kirov stars
Valery and Galina Panov.
The Panovs reportedly chose to
dance in San Francisco to thank
the Bay Area Council on Soviet
Jewry, one of many American
support groups that campaigned
for their release from the Soviet
Union.
Charming Pas
However, the Panovs' charming
interpretation of the Harlequinade
pas de deux left no doubt that
they are first-rate artists as well as
political celebrities.
Panov choreographed the pas
de deux, based on a full-length
ballet by Marius Petipa. The lilting

commedia dell'arte spirit of the
work gave both dancers an
excellent opportunity to display
both dramatic skill and
spectacular dancing talent.
Although Mrs. Panov's heavy
black and white costume was less
than flattering to her somewhat
chunky build, her doll-like
blondeness enhanced her
coquettish interpretation of
Columbine.
She thrilled the audience with
unbelievable high extensions and
quick turns, but her style is
ground in strength, not bravado.
One has only to watch her
supporting foot and ankle
working against the floor to
realize the technical strength that
made her one of the Kirov's rising
stars.

the company's associate artistic
director, Michael Smuin, as a
tribute to Panov.
It was first danced in 1973,
shortly after Panov applied for an
exit visa to Israel. He was fired
from the Kirov, and then granted
permission to leave — but without
his wife. Panov continued to
struggle for her release, refusing to
leave her behind. The Panovs
finally received permission to
leave the U.S.S.R. last June.
Ordeal
For Valery Panov, set to
driving music by Rachmaninoff, is
a moving interpretation of Panov's
ordeal. Panov is portrayed in
Russian costume, first dancing
joyously about the stage and then
suddenly discovering that he is
trapped.
Filipov's performance was
chilling as he slapped his palms
against the sides of an invisible
box and struggled to free his
bound wrists. The lights dimmed
slowly and dissolved to blackness
just after Filipov raised his arms,
half-pleading, half-defiant.
When the lights came up,
Filipov ripped the rope from his
wrists and threw it on the floor.
Panov dashed on stage to embrace

him, but stopped to pick up the
rope and hurl it into the wings. It
was an appropriate symbol.
Learning Plans
Panov reportedly plans to learn
For Valery Panov and dance it at
a future concert. He also hopes to
begin doing some choreography.
It is not known whether he will
choose to work in San Francisco,
but if his debut here was an
indication, his creativity would
provide just the kind of spark the
San Francisco Ballet now needs.
In their opening performance
the company's dancers far
outclassed the choreography in
the works they performed. The
opening number, Variations de
Ballet was pretty, but bland. If
attempted by a company with
dancers of lesser ability, it would
put the audience to sleep. But fine
dancing by Betsy Erickson, Vane
Vest, Filipov and Diana Weber
kept nearly everyone awake.
Watching the company's
leading ballerina, Linda Meyer,
dance the leading role in Beauty
and the Beast was like watching

Chris Evert at the baseline. Like
Evert, Meyer does everything
right. She dances smoothly and
even managed to bring some
depth to a seemingly superficial
role. She is dependable, but not
dazzling.
The potential of the company
was evidenced by Robert
Gladstein as the Beast and John
McFall as the marmoset. Anita
Paciotti and Damara Bennet
provided some amusing moments
as Beauty's ugly and obnoxious
sisters. But most of the dancers
are not given a chance to perform
choreography that will capitalize
on the full extent of their talents.
Now that the company's
financial and management
structure is on firmer ground, one
can only hope that artistic
director Lew Christiansen will
take some bold steps in the
direction of artistic innovation.
Only then will the San
Francisco Ballet make the
from a good company to a great
one.
SAN FRANCISCO—The
winter/spring season of the San
Francisco Ballet opened in the
War Memorial Opera House two
weeks ago, and the audience had
at least two good reasons to stand
up and cheer.
The first was consistently
high quality of the company's
dancing, in spite of some rather
boring choreography.
The second was the Bay Area
debut of former Kirov stars
Valery and Galina Panov.
The Panovs reportedly chose to
dance in San Francisco to thank
the Bay Area Council on Soviet
Jewry, one of many American
support groups that campaigned
for their release from the Soviet
Union.
Charming Pas
However, the Panovs' charming
interpretation of the Harlequinade
pas de deux left no doubt that
they are first-rate artists as well as
political celebrities.
Panov choreographed the pas
de deux, based on a full-length
ballet by Marius Petipa. The lilting

commedia dell'arte spirit of the
work gave both dancers an
excellent opportunity to display
both dramatic skill and
spectacular dancing talent.
Although Mrs. Panov's heavy
black and white costume was less
than flattering to her somewhat
chunky build, her doll-like
blondeness enhanced her
coquettish interpretation of
Columbine.
She thrilled the audience with
unbelievable high extensions and
quick turns, but her style is
ground in strength, not bravado.
One has only to watch her
supporting foot and ankle
working against the floor to
realize the technical strength that
made her one of the Kirov's rising
stars.
Short Performance
There was little to criticize in
Panov's performance, except that
it was far too short. From the
moment he appeared on stage he
remained perfectly in character as
Harlequin, the lovesick young
swain who plays pranks on
Columbine's father in order to
win her hand. He wore a black
mask that gave him the appearance
of a rakish raccoon.
The most memorable moment
of his solo was a sequence of
jet-propelled leaps in which his
legs seemed to flail in every
possible direction before he again
touched ground. But his variation
was not merely a collection of
gymnastic feats — every move
oozed with Harlequin's love for
Columbine.
As the audience leaped to its
feet clapping and cheering, the
Panovs remained in character and
took their bows as lovesick
pranksters, not international
dance superstars. It was the most
spontaneous, most entertaining
curtain call this reviewer has seen.

The Panovs were unable to
practice dancing during their
two-year struggle to leave the
U.S.S.R. together. Because their
appearance was so brief, it is
impossible to say whether the
lapse affected their endurance.
But their technical ability to
dance remains strong and their
stage presence is almost
triumphant.
Michael Filipov, another Soviet
dancer who defected several years
ago and later joined the San
Francisco Ballet, delivered the
most moving performance of the
evening in For Valery Panov. The
solo work was choreographed by
the company's associate artistic
director, Michael Smuin, as a
