## Cardinals Announce Recruits 
### RON BECK 
A group of 25 football recruits
have signed national letters of
intent to attend Stanford next
fall, announced Sports
Information Director Gary Cavalli
last night.
Headlining the list are two prep
All-Americans, a place-kicker who
Denver Bronco scouts say is
already pro-caliber and a
linebacker who earned Chicago
player-of-the-year honors.
Twenty high school players
and five JC transfers are
represented in the group. Five
recruits are from the Bay Area,
nine from Southern California,
four from Oregon and one each
from Wheatridge, Colo, and
Chicago, 111.
Jack Moller, the Chicago MVP,
and Gordon Ceresino, a two-time
Ail-American from Canoga Park,
both starred as linebackers during
their prep careers.
Roger May, the place-kicker
from Wheatridge, Colo., has
distinguished himself in high
school with field goals from
distances of 57 and 53 yards.
The other All-American is
quarterback Turk Schonert from
Placentia, Calif. Schonert was
named to the All-American team
for his junior season, but was not
renamed after an injury marred
his senior season.
Three of the four Oregon
recruits were all-state players.
John Pyle, a defensive back/
quarterback recruit from Eugene,
chose Stanford over his
hometown school, the University
of Oregon. Larry Reynolds of
Corvallis, brother of Oregon's star
running back Don Reynolds, also
passed up his hometown school of
Oregon State for Stanford.
The Cards added the most to
the defensive squad with 15 of the
25 recruits listed at defensive
positions. Seven of the prospects
are defensive backs, and six are
listed at linebacker.

A group of 25 football recruits
have signed national letters of
intent to attend Stanford next
fall, announced Sports
Information Director Gary Cavalli
last night.
Headlining the list are two prep
All-Americans, a place-kicker who
Denver Bronco scouts say is
already pro-caliber and a
linebacker who earned Chicago
player-of-the-year honors.
Twenty high school players
and five JC transfers are
represented in the group. Five
recruits are from the Bay Area,
nine from Southern California,
four from Oregon and one each
from Wheatridge, Colo, and
Chicago, 111.
Jack Moller, the Chicago MVP,
and Gordon Ceresino, a two-time
Ail-American from Canoga Park,
both starred as linebackers during
their prep careers.
Roger May, the place-kicker
from Wheatridge, Colo., has
distinguished himself in high
school with field goals from
distances of 57 and 53 yards.
The other All-American is
quarterback Turk Schonert from
Placentia, Calif. Schonert was
named to the All-American team
for his junior season, but was not
renamed after an injury marred
his senior season.
Three of the four Oregon
recruits were all-state players.
John Pyle, a defensive back/
quarterback recruit from Eugene,
chose Stanford over his
hometown school, the University
of Oregon. Larry Reynolds of
Corvallis, brother of Oregon's star
running back Don Reynolds, also
passed up his hometown school of
Oregon State for Stanford.
The Cards added the most to
the defensive squad with 15 of the
25 recruits listed at defensive
positions. Seven of the prospects
are defensive backs, and six are
listed at linebacker.
