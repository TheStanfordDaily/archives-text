# Cards Face More 'Must-Win' Games
## 
### DAN PYNE 
You realize, of course, that this
might as well be a fill-in-the-blank
story.
"The Stanford Cardinal
basketball team, still fighting for a
playoff berth with a
record, faces a crucial test this
weekend when they meet
tonight and
tomorrow.
"Card Coach Howie Dallmar
says, 'We've got to win both of
our games this weekend to stay in
the running.'
" teams are still
closely bunched behind
league-leading UCLA with
games left to play."
It's true. All of it.
The never-say-die Stanford
basketball team, 11-10 overall, 5-4
in league play, floating in third
place between USC and Cal, can
make it to a post-season
tournament yet. They'll have to
win tonight to do it.
"The games this weekend are
obviously very important to us"
is the way Dallmar put it this
week. He's not fooling.
First on the agenda is Oregon
State, the Cinderella of
West Coast basketball, somehow

in second place with a 6-3 record.
Stanford whupped the socks off
the Beavers in Corvallis earlier this
year, 71-63, back when everyone
thought the motley crew in orange
and black would be somewhere
close to the bottom of the league
by the time this season ended.
Since then, however, the
Beavers have registered victories
over Washington, Oregon and USC
twice (the Cards have fallen to two
of them). And they show
no signs of letting up. Consider
them dangerous.
Tomorrow the Cards play
Oregon. The Ducks are in a
four-game losing tailspin, but not
a slump. The "Kamikaze Kids"
are never in a slump. They may
indeed by angry, which
(considering the way they play
when they're happy) is not a
conforting thought.
Stanford lost to the Ducks and
the Ducks' rabid fans, in Eugene
in January, and by only one point
(84-83). Consider them
poisonous.
Howie Dallmar has been trying
to fight off the flu this week, and
it rained on Wednesday giving
ominous greetings to the soggy
Oregon duo. But the Cards are

catching on to the craziness of
this Pac-8 season, and could send
the foul-weather friends back
north with no goodies.
Cardinal Notes: Rich Kelley

now needs only 21 points to
capture fourth piace in Stanford's
all-time scoring list ... with 111
points in the next five games he
can take third . . .
