# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
luist Friday, our fearful
forecaster made eight predictions,
getting only four right, no better
than a flip of a coin.
But we will not resign
(haven't you heard that
somewhere before?). Our season
record is 31-14 (.688), still a
respectable one. And besides,
after that editor's note the big
dumb redhead added to our last
predictions, we have to prove
exactly who the real genius is. To
quote Quick Draw McGraw, "I'll
do the thin 'in around here. "
This week, Stanford plays
Oregon State and Oregon. OSU
has been playing much better
basketball than anyone expected,
while Oregon has been losing lots
of close ones.

We think it'll be a weir J
weekend in the Bay Area, with all
four teams (including Cal) coming
out with a 1-1 mark (this pick is
a real gamble, as we could be right
about the l-l records but still
miss all four predictions).
Up north, UCLA (which is near
to sewing up the league
championship) and USC both
should have little problem
Saturday night.
Predictions
Stanford 71, Oregon St. 68
California 78, Oregon 75
Oregon 79, Stanford 75
Oregon St. 81, California 71
UCLA 90, Washington 83
USCBS, WSU69
(Editor's note: Another week like last
week, and our fearful forecaster will be
added to the unemployment rolls. 4-4
. . . phooey.)
