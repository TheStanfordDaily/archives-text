Women's Tennis
This weekend the top four
members of the women's tennis
team will play in a prestigious
invitational tournament in
Tuscon, Ariz. More than 15 teams
from California, Nevada, Arizona
and Texas will participate in the
event at the University of Arizona
campus.
Representing Stanford will be
sophomore Marci O'Keefe at first
singles, freshman Lele Forood at
second singles, senior Andrea
Barnes at third singles and
freshman Joy Hahn at fourth
singles. The teams of
O'Keefe-Forood and Barnes-Hahn
are also entered in the doubles
division.
With one point awarded for
each match won, Stanford's
depth, as well as the strength of
its individual members, will be
advantageous.
This depth will also be tested
on Friday, March 7, when last
year's national collegiate

champion, Trinity University of
San Antonio, Texas, will meet
Stanford in a practice match.
Trinity will travel to California
to play against Stanford as well as
against the top teams of USC.
UCLA and UC-Irvine. The match,
to begin at 1:30, will certainly be
a display of some of the best
women's tennis the campus has
ever seen.
With the new talents of
O'Keefe, Forood, Nancy Rudd
and Audrey Kemp in addition to
those of returnees Barnes and
Nancy Anderson, Stanford will
have a good chance to beat the
nation's number one team.

DAVIS—If at first you don't
succeed . ..
The UC-Davis Aggies followed
the proverb to the letter in their
basketball game with the visiting
Stanford women's team on
Tuesday night. Trailing the Cards

by eight with nine minutes to go,
the Aggies tried and tried and
finally sent the game into
overtime. The extra five minutes
were anti-climatic as Davis
outscored Stanford 9-2 to give the
Cards their first loss of the season,
58-51.
Aggie freshman Carol Harrison
proved impossible to stop as she
poured in 24 points. Stanford
Coach Gay Coburn tried at least
four different players on Harrison,
but none proved very effective.
There were several bright
points in the Cards' play. Martha
Andersen threw in four long set
shots and finished with a strong
5 of 12 from the field. Sukie
Jackson made her usual
well-balanced contribution,
scoring 13 points and pulling
down 15 rebounds in tough
situations.
The Davis student newspaper
emphasizes the Aggie JV team in
its sports section, and after their
51-26 romp over the Stanford
junior varsity, it's easy to
understand why.
In play as rough as in the
varsity contest, Davis combined
tough defense and good foul
shooting to demolish the Cards.
Stanford started slowly, making
several costly turnovers and falling
behind 12-0 before Lisa Kolp

scored the Cards' first basket with
11:56 to go in the first half.
The Cards have now finished
thei* regular season games on the
road. The varsity record is now
4-1 and the JV's record stands at
2-2. The Cards play three home
games in the next five days. The
varsity plays Nevada-Reno this
afternoon at five o'clock and Cal
State-Humboldt tomorrow at
12:30 p.m. The JVs play before
the varsity matches at 3 p.m. and
10:30 a.m. respectively.

The Stanford wrestling team is
in Corvallis, Ore., today for the
first round of the Pacific Eight
tournament.
Head coach Joe DeMeo was
carefully optimistic about his
team's chances of moving out of
the Pac-8 wrestling cellar it
occupied last year. "I have seven
kids who I think might have a
chance of placing at the
tournament," he said. "We are
healthy and our line-up is the
strongest it has been all year."
Oregon is the odds on favorite
to take the tournament. The
Ducks are currently ranked sixth
in the nation. Host Oregon State
and Washington are expected to
be strong challengers.

DeMeo said that he felt Chris
Horpel, Stanford All-American
150 pounder, Ken Krebs at 142
and John Govea at 190 had good
chances of taking championships
in their weight categories. "Both
Horpel and Krebs are wrestling
extremely well right now,"
DeMeo said. "They should place
high." DeMeo said that Govea
might have a tougher road to hoe
at 190.
Four other wrestlers are given
outside chances for places in
Corvallis, including Malcolm Scott
at 118, 134-pounder Mark Yancy,
Craig Reynolds at 158 and Gary
Lynn at 167. "118 is wide open
this year," DeMeo said. "If Scott
has a good day he could go all the
way."
The top four place winners will
advance to the NCAA finals at
Princeton, N.J.,March 1 and 2.

Coach Jean Helliwell's
eleven-year effort to build and
maintain a fencing program at
Stanford culminated in an
impressive display of depth and
talent at the Nor-Cal
Intercollegiate Fencing
Championships held last weekend
in San Francisco. Six colleges
from Northern and Central

California qualified to send teams
to the championships for each
event.
In men's epee, the Stanford
team of Mark Eaton, Jack Handy,
Steve Walt and Bob Wilder went
undefeated in team rounds to
capture first place in that event.
Then Walt, a first-year epee man,
went on to capture the individual
title.
On Sunday, the men and
women's foil teams competed
against other Nor-Cal schools in
their team event. The women's
team, Marie Fiatarone, Claudia
Tei.iby, Stacey Yoon and Ann
Williams placed third with
Fiatarone advancing to the
individual finals.
The men's team of Jack
Handy, Madison Grose, Dennis
Leybold and Jim Crumly
overpowered all competition to
place first.
Senior Handy then secured the
coveted individual title utilizing
unmatched technique and
strategy.
Stanford's undefeated men's

weeks for the Western
Intercollegiate Fencing

expected to make a strong

Women's Tennis
This weekend the top four
members of the women's tennis
team will play in a prestigious
invitational tournament in
Tuscon, Ariz. More than 15 teams
from California, Nevada, Arizona
and Texas will participate in the
event at the University of Arizona
campus.
Representing Stanford will be
sophomore Marci O'Keefe at first
singles, freshman Lele Forood at
second singles, senior Andrea
Barnes at third singles and
freshman Joy Hahn at fourth
singles. The teams of
O'Keefe-Forood and Barnes-Hahn
are also entered in the doubles
division.
With one point awarded for
each match won, Stanford's
depth, as well as the strength of
its individual members, will be
advantageous.
This depth will also be tested
on Friday, March 7, when last
year's national collegiate

champion, Trinity University of
San Antonio, Texas, will meet
Stanford in a practice match.
Trinity will travel to California
to play against Stanford as well as
against the top teams of USC.
UCLA and UC-Irvine. The match,
to begin at 1:30, will certainly be
a display of some of the best
women's tennis the campus has
ever seen.
With the new talents of
O'Keefe, Forood, Nancy Rudd
and Audrey Kemp in addition to
those of returnees Barnes and
Nancy Anderson, Stanford will
have a good chance to beat the
nation's number one team.

DAVIS—If at first you don't
succeed . ..
The UC-Davis Aggies followed
the proverb to the letter in their
basketball game with the visiting
Stanford women's team on
Tuesday night. Trailing the Cards

by eight with nine minutes to go,
the Aggies tried and tried and
finally sent the game into
overtime. The extra five minutes
were anti-climatic as Davis
outscored Stanford 9-2 to give the
Cards their first loss of the season,
58-51.
Aggie freshman Carol Harrison
proved impossible to stop as she
poured in 24 points. Stanford
Coach Gay Coburn tried at least
four different players on Harrison,
but none proved very effective.
There were several bright
points in the Cards' play. Martha
Andersen threw in four long set
shots and finished with a strong
5 of 12 from the field. Sukie
Jackson made her usual
well-balanced contribution,
scoring 13 points and pulling
down 15 rebounds in tough
situations.
The Davis student newspaper
emphasizes the Aggie JV team in
its sports section, and after their
51-26 romp over the Stanford
junior varsity, it's easy to
understand why.
In play as rough as in the
varsity contest, Davis combined
tough defense and good foul
shooting to demolish the Cards.
Stanford started slowly, making
several costly turnovers and falling
behind 12-0 before Lisa Kolp

scored the Cards' first basket with
11:56 to go in the first half.
The Cards have now finished
thei* regular season games on the
road. The varsity record is now
4-1 and the JV's record stands at
2-2. The Cards play three home
games in the next five days. The
varsity plays Nevada-Reno this
afternoon at five o'clock and Cal
State-Humboldt tomorrow at
12:30 p.m. The JVs play before
the varsity matches at 3 p.m. and
10:30 a.m. respectively.

The Stanford wrestling team is
in Corvallis, Ore., today for the
first round of the Pacific Eight
tournament.
Head coach Joe DeMeo was
carefully optimistic about his
team's chances of moving out of
the Pac-8 wrestling cellar it
occupied last year. "I have seven
kids who I think might have a
chance of placing at the
tournament," he said. "We are
healthy and our line-up is the
strongest it has been all year."
Oregon is the odds on favorite
to take the tournament. The
Ducks are currently ranked sixth
in the nation. Host Oregon State
and Washington are expected to
be strong challengers.

DeMeo said that he felt Chris
Horpel, Stanford All-American
150 pounder, Ken Krebs at 142
and John Govea at 190 had good
chances of taking championships
in their weight categories. "Both
Horpel and Krebs are wrestling
extremely well right now,"
DeMeo said. "They should place
high." DeMeo said that Govea
might have a tougher road to hoe
at 190.
Four other wrestlers are given
outside chances for places in
Corvallis, including Malcolm Scott
at 118, 134-pounder Mark Yancy,
Craig Reynolds at 158 and Gary
Lynn at 167. "118 is wide open
this year," DeMeo said. "If Scott
has a good day he could go all the
way."
The top four place winners will
advance to the NCAA finals at
Princeton, N.J.,March 1 and 2.

and John Govea at 190 had good

in their weight categories. "Both
Horpel and Krebs are wrestling
extremely well right now,"
DeMeo said. "They should place
high." DeMeo said that Govea
might have a tougher road to hoe

Four other wrestlers are given
outside chances for places in
Corvallis, including Malcolm Scott
at 118, 134-pounder Mark Yancy,
Craig Reynolds at 158 and Gary
Lynn at 167. "118 is wide open

The top four place winners will

Coach Jean Helliwell's
eleven-year effort to build and
maintain a fencing program at
Stanford culminated in an
impressive display of depth and
talent at the Nor-Cal
Intercollegiate Fencing
Championships held last weekend
in San Francisco. Six colleges
from Northern and Central

California qualified to send teams
to the championships for each
event.
In men's epee, the Stanford
team of Mark Eaton, Jack Handy,
Steve Walt and Bob Wilder went
undefeated in team rounds to
capture first place in that event.
Then Walt, a first-year epee man,
went on to capture the individual
title.
On Sunday, the men and
women's foil teams competed
against other Nor-Cal schools in
their team event. The women's
team, Marie Fiatarone, Claudia
Tei.iby, Stacey Yoon and Ann
Williams placed third with
Fiatarone advancing to the
individual finals.
The men's team of Jack
Handy, Madison Grose, Dennis
Leybold and Jim Crumly

Women's Tennis
This weekend the top four
members of the women's tennis
team will play in a prestigious
invitational tournament in
Tuscon, Ariz. More than 15 teams
from California, Nevada, Arizona
and Texas will participate in the
event at the University of Arizona
campus.
Representing Stanford will be
sophomore Marci O'Keefe at first
singles, freshman Lele Forood at
second singles, senior Andrea
Barnes at third singles and
freshman Joy Hahn at fourth
singles. The teams of
O'Keefe-Forood and Barnes-Hahn
are also entered in the doubles
division.
With one point awarded for
each match won, Stanford's
depth, as well as the strength of
its individual members, will be
advantageous.
This depth will also be tested
on Friday, March 7, when last
year's national collegiate

champion, Trinity University of
San Antonio, Texas, will meet
Stanford in a practice match.
Trinity will travel to California
to play against Stanford as well as
against the top teams of USC.
UCLA and UC-Irvine. The match,
to begin at 1:30, will certainly be
a display of some of the best
women's tennis the campus has
ever seen.
With the new talents of
O'Keefe, Forood, Nancy Rudd
and Audrey Kemp in addition to
those of returnees Barnes and
Nancy Anderson, Stanford will
have a good chance to beat the
nation's number one team.

DAVIS—If at first you don't
succeed . ..
The UC-Davis Aggies followed
the proverb to the letter in their
basketball game with the visiting
Stanford women's team on
Tuesday night. Trailing the Cards

by eight with nine minutes to go,
the Aggies tried and tried and
finally sent the game into
overtime. The extra five minutes
were anti-climatic as Davis
outscored Stanford 9-2 to give the
Cards their first loss of the season,
58-51.
Aggie freshman Carol Harrison
proved impossible to stop as she
poured in 24 points. Stanford
Coach Gay Coburn tried at least
four different players on Harrison,
but none proved very effective.
There were several bright
points in the Cards' play. Martha
Andersen threw in four long set
shots and finished with a strong
5 of 12 from the field. Sukie
Jackson made her usual
well-balanced contribution,
scoring 13 points and pulling
down 15 rebounds in tough
situations.
The Davis student newspaper
emphasizes the Aggie JV team in
its sports section, and after their
51-26 romp over the Stanford
junior varsity, it's easy to
understand why.
In play as rough as in the
varsity contest, Davis combined
tough defense and good foul
shooting to demolish the Cards.
Stanford started slowly, making
several costly turnovers and falling
behind 12-0 before Lisa Kolp

scored the Cards' first basket with
11:56 to go in the first half.
The Cards have now finished
thei* regular season games on the
road. The varsity record is now
4-1 and the JV's record stands at
2-2. The Cards play three home
games in the next five days. The
varsity plays Nevada-Reno this
afternoon at five o'clock and Cal
State-Humboldt tomorrow at
12:30 p.m. The JVs play before
the varsity matches at 3 p.m. and
