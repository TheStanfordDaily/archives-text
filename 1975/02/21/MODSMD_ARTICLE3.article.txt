# The 						'Chron' Takes A Beating
## Eastern Newsmen Rap Region's Papers 
### KAREN CAESAR 
The San Francisco Chronicle took a
beating yesterday as a panel of three
top East Coast journalists gathered to
compare Eastern and Western
newspapers before the Communication
225 class.
"The Chronicle plays games with
readers," Newsweek associate editor
Art Zich said. While claiming to use
"foreign correspondents, it uses wire
service stuff. It doesn't have folks on
the scene, and it suffers for it. It
accepts the services of the Los Angeles
Times and the New York Times, and
insists on misusing all of them."
Zich appeared with New York
Times sportswriter Leonard Koppett
and ABC foreign news assignment
editor Eric Tait.
Speaking of the Chronicle's alleged
overemphasis on unusual local stories,
Zich continued, "I find the
navel-hunting, Baghdad-by-the-Bay
crap a phony feud [Chronicle
columnist] Herb Caen perpetuates
between San Francisco and L.A. You
go to L.A. and you find out it's too
busy being a great city to care."
The journalists unanimously agreed
on the poor quality of Western
newspapers, with the single exception
of the Los Angeles Times. They said
that the Times, with reporters outside
of its home base, is not overly
dependent on wire service reports. As
sportswriter Koppett put it, "If you
don't commit yourself to a national
staff, you become like the San

Francisco Chronicle."
Later, however, Zich acknowledged
"the high quality of Chronicle
newsmen" and surmised that it is the
"question of news selection and
editorial judgement and not the level
of the reporter" that gives the paper
its notoriety.
"The Western press," according to
Zich, "suffers from a considerable
degree of provincialism and
considerable disorganization in its
presentation of the news."
In reference to the local perspective
of the Palo Alto Times, Tait remarked
that "it is provincial in the sense that
the national news is on page 42. The
editors feel that what is important to
Palo Alto residents is what is
happening here."
Locally Oriented
Koppett countered by saying that
"newspapers by their nature should be
primarily locally oriented."
Whereas national and international
events will be mentioned on national
television news, the only appropriate
place for important local events may
be the first pages of the local paper.
"There is a difference in urgency
between the two kinds of news,"
Koppett said.
"Local news is important, but it
should be done better" than it is in
many "provincial" newspapers, said
Stanford Observer editor Harry Press,
who moderated the panel.
Koppett also spoke on the

EAST BEATS WEST — Leonard Koppett, New York Times sportswriter, met
with other professional journalists to compare eastern and western newspapers.
Koppett spoke about "the damage done by not challenging the monopoly of
newspaper ownership." The panel appeared before a Communication 225 class.
purported adverse effects of
concentrated newspaper ownership.
"The problem of monopoly that exists
locally is the fact that in one
community tnere is only one voice
speaking," he said. "The damage
comes from the fact that it [the
monopoly] is not being challenged;
it's been bad for American society.
[For example] there is no way that
circulation of one of the New York
papers will be affected by anything
one of the other papers does."
Questioned about the public's
inclination toward TV news as
opposed to newspapers, Tait
responded that most "national
newspapers are so bad, people should
turn to TV news. There are
approximately 2314 minutes to run six
major news stories around the globe.
By virtue of the time limitation you
have to get to the meat of [ the news
story] fast. If a viewer wanted more
in-depth material, he could read the
Los Angeles Times or the New York
Times."
However, Koppett said that the
public is much to blame for the
quality of news coverage. "Readers of
local papers don't demand that they
do better." Consequently, what is
turned out is what can be assembled
and distributed in the cheapest
manner, Koppett said.
But panelists sloughed off the
notion of establishing a "reputable"
paper in the Bay Area.
"I am very pessimistic about the
possibility of anybody anywhere
starting a good newspaper," said
Koppett. "No one could start a New
York Times today; it's living off its
tradition. No one would touch a
blueprint for it with a 10-foot pole,"
Koppett added.
