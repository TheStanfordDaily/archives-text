# Aquamen Take On Cal In Dual Meet
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The Stanford swimmers travel
to Berkeley tomorrow to take on
California's Bears in their Pac-8
dual meet finale.
Cal, whose swim team has
never achieved anywhere near the
success of its NCAA champion
water polo team, has
nevertheless vastly improved over
last year's dismal performance.
One reason for its turn around is
th* addition of Coach Nort
Thorton, former mentor at
Foothill (where Stanford's Craig
Van Zandt was one of his stars),
as well as "a whole new team" in
the words of Stanford Coach Jim
Gaughran.
Despite their improvement,
however, the Bears should be little
match for the talented Cards.
The meet is important for many
of the Stanford for it
will be their last chance to qualify
for the upcoming Pac-8
Championship meet in Los
Angeles.
Unworried Swimmer
One swimmer who has no
worries about qualifying for any
meet is Dave Fairbank, the
talented sprinterfrom Sacramento.
Fairbank has been nothing short
of spectacular this year, especially
in last week's loss to USC when he
out-dueled Trojan ace Joe Bottom
to win both the 50 and 100 yard
free.
The sophomore currently ranks
first in the nation in the 50 free
and third in the 190. Being
number one, he thinks, "puts the
pressure on when I'm standing on
the blocks at the NCAAs[in
Cleveland next month], but it
helps, too, by putting more
pressure on everyone else." USC's
Bottom is his chief competition,
but that is nothing new to either
of them. "I've been racing Bottom
since I was 10 years old," he

laughs.
Fairbank, who began
swimming competitively at the
age of six, has been rewarded richly
for his talent. He has competed all
over the world. Fairbank was a
member of the 1972 Olympian
where "my relay team held a
world record for half of a day."
"After Munich, we went to an
international meet in London,
and then six of us went on to
Tunisia and Morocco giving
demonstrations and clinics,"
Fairbank recalls. All of that was
while he was still in high school,
swimming for Arden Hills Swim
Club with Mark Spitz and several
other world-class swimmers. He
went with the Swim Club to
Portugal last summer as well.
"The trips really help keep
your interest up," says Fairbank,
who figures that he has "at least
two solid years of swimming left."
The next two years would begin
with a summer tour of Portugal,
Madeira and Rome, followed by
the World Games in Columbia, the
Pan-Am games in October, and
finally the 1976 Olympics.
There's only one catch,
however. "I've still got to
qualify," he says. Furthermore,
"with the sprints, you can't ever
tell what's going to happen. There
are eight guys coming up all the
time," which means that one bad
race, even one bad start, can easily
eliminate a sprinter from the
competition.
Fairbank, an NCAA finalist last
year, is expected to be there again
this year in the 50 and 100 free
and probably the freestyle relay.
In the 50, one of his goals will be
to become the first human to ever
go under 20 seconds (his best time
is 20.4), which would be
somewhere in the neighborhood
of five miles per hour. It's faster
than you can imagine.
