# Card Pitchers Thrashed In Southwest
## 
### TOM GALLIGAN 
The Stanford baseball team's
road trip to Arizona was right out
of a Bob Hope — Dorothy
Lamour script. Nothing but
trouble.
The Cards dropped four out of
five games and sustained injuries
to three key pitchers and catcher
Dave Baker. There was more
hitting than at a second-rate
Golden Gloves match in a series
which turned out to be a pitcher's
nightmare.
Arizona State University is a
nice place to visit but you don't
want to play baseball there. ASU
is always strong. They take their
baseball seriously and have
produced such great pros as
Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando and

Rick Monday. Former ASU head
coach Bobby Winkles is one of the
few coaches to move from the
college to pro ranks.
The Cardinals opened against
Arizona State in Tempe last
Thursday and lost their first of
three games 18-8. The following
two contests stretched into extra
innings but the Cards still came up
short, 10-8 and 4-3.
Baker was hurt in the second
game when he seriously bruised
his leg sliding home in the ninth
with the tying run. The injury
could keep him from catching for
as long as two weeks but Card
Coach Ray Young hopes he might
be able to hit or play the outfield
sooner.
Young says that Arizona State

is extremely strong this year and
definitely has its eyes on the
national championship.
The Cards travelled to Tucson
on Monday to meet the University
of Arizona in a doubleheader.
Arizona won the first game, 21-7,
but Stanford came back to take
the second, 8-7, breaking a
five-game losing streak. The
Cardinals scored the winning run
when three singles knocked
pinch-runner Gary Bei home.
Coach Young was disappointed
that the pitching did not hold up.
He said the Card hurlers were
falling behind, which forced them
to "throw to the hitters." To
make things worse, arm troubles
began in Tempe. Ken Grolle, who
started the first ASU game and
worked only two innings, is having

trouble with tendonitis in his
shoulder. Jerry Argust has an
elbow injury and Jim
Scharffenberger has an extremely
sore shoulder.
Young refuses to dwell on
defeat, mentioning instead the
"bright spots" of the trip; the
hitting was excellent, and the
defense was very good.
He commended several players
on their performance over the
long weekend. Tom Guardino did
a great job and showed "great
maturity with the bat and the
glove," Young said; Pepe Hinojosa
swung the bat well, got on base
and ran well. Young also praised
Randy Wong (who came in to play
the outfield when Baker was hurt,
and went 8 for 12 in the three
games he played), Bruce Robinson,
Gary Pitchford, Steve Davis and
Bob Hampton.
Young also indicates that, if
needed, Hampton will see work as
a relief pitcher. "He has good
stuff and can throw strikes,"
Young said. He added, however,
that he does not expect his
pitchers to have anywhere near as
much trouble in the future as they
did during the Arizona series.

produced such great pros as
Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando and

Rick Monday. Former ASU head
coach Bobby Winkles is one of the
few coaches to move from the
college to pro ranks.
The Cardinals opened against
Arizona State in Tempe last
Thursday and lost their first of
three games 18-8. The following
two contests stretched into extra
innings but the Cards still came up
short, 10-8 and 4-3.
Baker was hurt in the second
game when he seriously bruised
his leg sliding home in the ninth
with the tying run. The injury
could keep him from catching for
as long as two weeks but Card
Coach Ray Young hopes he might
be able to hit or play the outfield
sooner.
Young says that Arizona State

is extremely strong this year and
definitely has its eyes on the
national championship.
The Cards travelled to Tucson
on Monday to meet the University
of Arizona in a doubleheader.
Arizona won the first game, 21-7,
but Stanford came back to take
the second, 8-7, breaking a
five-game losing streak. The
Cardinals scored the winning run
when three singles knocked
pinch-runner Gary Bei home.
Coach Young was disappointed
that the pitching did not hold up.
He said the Card hurlers were
falling behind, which forced them
to "throw to the hitters." To
make things worse, arm troubles
began in Tempe. Ken Grolle, who
started the first ASU game and
worked only two innings, is having

trouble with tendonitis in his
shoulder. Jerry Argust has an
elbow injury and Jim
Scharffenberger has an extremely
sore shoulder.
Young refuses to dwell on
defeat, mentioning instead the
"bright spots" of the trip; the
hitting was excellent, and the
defense was very good.
He commended several players
on their performance over the
long weekend. Tom Guardino did
a great job and showed "great
maturity with the bat and the
glove," Young said; Pepe Hinojosa
swung the bat well, got on base
and ran well. Young also praised
Randy Wong (who came in to play
the outfield when Baker was hurt,
and went 8 for 12 in the three
games he played), Bruce Robinson,
Gary Pitchford, Steve Davis and
Bob Hampton.
Young also indicates that, if
needed, Hampton will see work as
a relief pitcher. "He has good
stuff and can throw strikes,"
Young said. He added, however,
that he does not expect his
pitchers to have anywhere near as
much trouble in the future as they
did during the Arizona series.
The Stanford baseball team's
road trip to Arizona was right out
of a Bob Hope — Dorothy
Lamour script. Nothing but
trouble.
The Cards dropped four out of
five games and sustained injuries
to three key pitchers and catcher
Dave Baker. There was more
hitting than at a second-rate
Golden Gloves match in a series
which turned out to be a pitcher's
nightmare.
Arizona State University is a
nice place to visit but you don't
want to play baseball there. ASU
is always strong. They take their
baseball seriously and have
produced such great pros as
Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando and

Rick Monday. Former ASU head
coach Bobby Winkles is one of the
