### PETE BHATIA 
Soccer playoffs get under way
tomorrow with six "B" division
games on the schedule. At 10
a.m., Adelfa (4-1) meets the
Abberations (4-1); Faisan (4-1)
takes on Hammarskjold (4-1);
JRA (4-1) tackles Germany (4-1);
Theta Chi (4-1) faces the Nads
(4-1); and ZAP (4-1) takes on
Serra (5-0). At 11 a.m., Munchem
Crunchem (4-1) tries Aponeurosis
(4-1). Other first round pairings
include Harvard (3-2) vs. Cardenal
(4-1) and Theta Delt "B" (5-0),
led by the awesome fullback Rick
"Pele" Tuttle vs. Otero (4-1). Top
seeded CSA and second seed Cro
Mem both have bys this
weekend.
In the "A" playoffs, official
seedings place the defending
champion Bachacs (5-0) first,
followed by Education, last
year's runnerup, the International
Association and Engineers, all 5-0.
First round pairings, pending
this week's results, have Biz I A 2
(4-1) against SAE (4-1); Biz II A 2

(4-1) vs. Team Twain Reunited
(4-1); Biz II A 1 (4-1) vs. the
fifth-seeded Wildmen (5-0); Theta
Delt "A" (4-1) vs. Synergy; and
ATO (4-1) vs. the Engineers.
Basketball playoffs will be
getting under way Monday night
with JRA's Seek and Destroy
seeded number one in the A
bracket. They won their games by
margins of 104-30, 67-8, 74-25
and 75-32.
In the B's, the odds-on favorite
is the Wasted Parrots. The Parrots
won their regular season contests
by scores of 76-46, 80-33, 70-57,
48-28 and 61-21. Teams figured
to give them their toughest battle
include Moose and Babikan and
Company, an A team last year at
Larkin.
And, in an amazing
development, Gavilan '72 won
their first game in intramural
history. In a game which brought
tears to the eyes of the assembled
throng, the Gavilaners dumped
the Gargoyles — by forfeit. And as
an ancient sage once said — Take a

win any way you can get it. Even
though they only won by forfeit,
its good to see such a great bunch
of people win. Unfortunately,
that doesn't happen very often.

Theta Chi (4-1) faces the Nads
(4-1); and ZAP (4-1) takes on
Serra (5-0). At 11 a.m., Munchem
Crunchem (4-1) tries Aponeurosis
(4-1). Other first round pairings
include Harvard (3-2) vs. Cardenal
(4-1) and Theta Delt "B" (5-0),
led by the awesome fullback Rick
"Pele" Tuttle vs. Otero (4-1). Top
seeded CSA and second seed Cro
Mem both have bys this
weekend.
In the "A" playoffs, official
seedings place the defending
champion Bachacs (5-0) first,
followed by Education, last
year's runnerup, the International
Association and Engineers, all 5-0.
First round pairings, pending
this week's results, have Biz I A 2
(4-1) against SAE (4-1); Biz II A 2

(4-1) vs. Team Twain Reunited
(4-1); Biz II A 1 (4-1) vs. the
fifth-seeded Wildmen (5-0); Theta
Delt "A" (4-1) vs. Synergy; and
ATO (4-1) vs. the Engineers.
Basketball playoffs will be
getting under way Monday night
with JRA's Seek and Destroy
seeded number one in the A
bracket. They won their games by
margins of 104-30, 67-8, 74-25
and 75-32.
In the B's, the odds-on favorite
is the Wasted Parrots. The Parrots
won their regular season contests
by scores of 76-46, 80-33, 70-57,
48-28 and 61-21. Teams figured
to give them their toughest battle
include Moose and Babikan and
Company, an A team last year at
Larkin.
And, in an amazing
development, Gavilan '72 won
their first game in intramural
history. In a game which brought
tears to the eyes of the assembled
throng, the Gavilaners dumped
the Gargoyles — by forfeit. And as
an ancient sage once said — Take a

win any way you can get it. Even
though they only won by forfeit,
its good to see such a great bunch
of people win. Unfortunately,
that doesn't happen very often.
Our IM Roundup visor is off to
Gavilan '72.
