# Cards Survive Budget Cuts
## Gymnasts Get Reprieve 
### 
By GEORGE ANDERS
There's been a Lazarus-like
resurrection of the Stanford
gymnastics team.
For several weeks in January,
the Athletic Department planned
to terminate intercollegiate
gymnastics after this season.
But now the department will
keep the team, and, in addition,
start a women's gymnastics team
next year. Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli noted that,
"letters from students and alumni
expressing interest in keeping
gymnastics" and"the great
possibilities of co-ed gymnastics"
were factors in the decisions.
Coach Sadao Hamada first
heard rumors of the team's end
from high school prospects in
December.
When the official
announcement came out Jan. 10,
Ted Marcy recalled that like other
team members. he "felt

discouraged. You'd ask yourself
'What am I doing on the team"?
"But in many ways, it worked
the opposite way. It brought us
together. We decided the
department's reasons weren't
good enough," last year's NCAA
pommel horse champ added.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
had justified terminating
gymnastics because of demands
by intramural and club sports for
the facilities. Cavalli said budget
reasons and difficulties with Title
IX of the Education Amendments
Act also played a role.
Hamada's recruiting efforts
were completely shut down
during the period when he would
have been encouraging prospects
to apply. "For a while it looked
really bad," he noted. The coach
usually expects about 20
prospects each year. By now 10
have applied, and "a lot of guys

are kind of wondering whether to
apply."
Obscured Talents
All these developments have
obscured first-rate individual
performances. Marcy's scores for
the pommel horse are ahead of all
NCAA competition. He's changed
his routine from last year,
explaining "it's about time i did
something more difficult."
March has found the judging
erratic this year, noting that he
got a 9.65 for a "fiat" routine,
and the next night got the same
score for "one of my top
performances ever."
Freshman Bob Farb "has
shown a lot of potential,"
according to Hamada. Although
hs is still working on his basics,
Farb has turned in some fine
performances. Farb received a
first in the All-Around against Cal.
Farb credits much of his
development to help from
teammate Bob Anderson, who has
consistently been near the top.
Good NCAA Chances
"Both of them have a good
chance to place in the top six at
the NCAAs" in the Ail-Around,
Hamada predicted.
Despite these efforts, the team
won only one dual meet of three,
finished third in two triangulars
and last in a four team meet.
Hamada pointed to a chronic lack
of depth on the squad. "Other
teams could always field five men
in an event,"he noted. Sometimes
the Cards couldn't come up with
four.
Since the top four scores in
each event now count towards the
team score the Cards left spots
unfilled, or had to count all
scores, while opponents could
pick their best four scores.
Marcy sees the long-range
future of Stanford gymnastics as
good. "We're not Berkeley, but
we can still go good enough
gymnastics that we're enjoyable
to watch."
Attendance at the first home
meet was 800 and fell off at later
meets. But March attributes that
to bad weather and worse
publicity. He pointed to high
school meets that drew 3000, and
declared, "Of course gymnastics
can make it as a spectator sport.
It's artwork."

teammate Bob Anderson, who has
consistently been near the top.
Good NCAA Chances
"Both of them have a good
chance to place in the top six at
the NCAAs" in the Ail-Around,
Hamada predicted.
Despite these efforts, the team
won only one dual meet of three,
finished third in two triangulars
and last in a four team meet.
Hamada pointed to a chronic lack
of depth on the squad. "Other
teams could always field five men
in an event,"he noted. Sometimes
the Cards couldn't come up with
four.
Since the top four scores in
each event now count towards the
team score the Cards left spots
unfilled, or had to count all
scores, while opponents could
pick their best four scores.
Marcy sees the long-range
future of Stanford gymnastics as
good. "We're not Berkeley, but
we can still go good enough
gymnastics that we're enjoyable
to watch."
Attendance at the first home
meet was 800 and fell off at later
meets. But March attributes that
to bad weather and worse
publicity. He pointed to high
school meets that drew 3000, and
declared, "Of course gymnastics
can make it as a spectator sport.
It's artwork."

There's been a Lazarus-like
resurrection of the Stanford
gymnastics team.
For several weeks in January,
the Athletic Department planned
to terminate intercollegiate
gymnastics after this season.
But now the department will
keep the team, and, in addition,
start a women's gymnastics team
next year. Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli noted that,
"letters from students and alumni
expressing interest in keeping
gymnastics" and"the great
possibilities of co-ed gymnastics"
were factors in the decisions.
Coach Sadao Hamada first
heard rumors of the team's end
from high school prospects in
December.
When the official
announcement came out Jan. 10,
Ted Marcy recalled that like other
team members. he "felt

discouraged. You'd ask yourself
'What am I doing on the team"?
"But in many ways, it worked
the opposite way. It brought us
together. We decided the
department's reasons weren't
good enough," last year's NCAA
pommel horse champ added.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
had justified terminating
gymnastics because of demands
by intramural and club sports for
the facilities. Cavalli said budget
reasons and difficulties with Title
IX of the Education Amendments
Act also played a role.
Hamada's recruiting efforts
were completely shut down
during the period when he would
have been encouraging prospects
to apply. "For a while it looked
really bad," he noted. The coach
usually expects about 20
prospects each year. By now 10
have applied, and "a lot of guys

are kind of wondering whether to
apply."
Obscured Talents
All these developments have
obscured first-rate individual
performances. Marcy's scores for
the pommel horse are ahead of all
NCAA competition. He's changed
his routine from last year,
explaining "it's about time i did
something more difficult."
March has found the judging
erratic this year, noting that he
got a 9.65 for a "fiat" routine,
and the next night got the same
score for "one of my top
performances ever."
Freshman Bob Farb "has
shown a lot of potential,"
according to Hamada. Although
hs is still working on his basics,
Farb has turned in some fine
performances. Farb received a
first in the All-Around against Cal.
Farb credits much of his
development to help from
teammate Bob Anderson, who has
consistently been near the top.
