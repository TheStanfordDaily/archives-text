Colby Admits Congressional Files
WASHINGTON - Director William E. Colby said
yesterday the Central Intelligency Agency once kept
files on four congressmen and did not deny that the
agency has used sex traps to gain information from
foreigners.
But Colby said these and other activities by the
agency have been greatly exaggerated in a way that
has "placed American intelligence in danger."
"I won't say that sex and intelligence never got
together," Colby testified before an open meeting
of the House defense appropriations subcommittee.
But he told the subcommittee in his first public
testimony on alleged domestic spying by the CIA
that he preferred to withhold for a closed session
any further comment on a published account of sex
traps.
Columnist Jack Anderson has reported that the
Drug Enforcement Administration had maintained
apartments that it allowed the CIA to use as sex
lairs to obtain information from foreigners.
Colby said the CIA has discovered several
mistakes in his earlier testimony before a closed
meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Panel Rejeets Low-Interest Bill
WASHINGTON — House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry Reuss (D-Wis.), pulled back a
controversial bill yesterday ordering allocation of
credit according to national priorities in hopes of
working out a compromise with the administration.
But the committee did adopt, 26-10, a
nonbinding sense of Congress resolution urging the
Federal Reserve Board to change its money
management in order to lower long-term interest
rates and ultimately decrease employment.
Critics of the resolution said it was virtually
meaningless because it would not have the force of
law.
The committee first tabled, then revived
temporarily and ultimately defeated, a bill by Reuss
that would have ordered the Federal Reserve to
lower long-term interest rates and bring about a
lower jobless rate.
The committee then approved the nonbinding
resolution.
Chairman Arthur Burns of the Federal Reserve
Board, in an unusual 3'/2-hour meeting with the
Banking Committee on Wednesday night, opposed
both the credit allocation and interest rate
reduction bills.
Zebra Witness MLied*
SAN FRANCISCO — The prosecution's key
witness in the Zebra murder case was intimidated by
police and now has recanted some of his testimony,
the defense counsel says.
Clinton White, attorney for three of the four
defendants, has asked Superior Court Judge Joseph
Karesh to order a private interview for defense
counsel with informant Anthony C. Harris, the key
witness.

Harris, 29, a paroled burglar, had testified before
a grand jury that he witnessed seven of the 13 Zebra
murders of white victims by black assailants.
White disclosed Wednesday that Harris recently
sent him two letters claiming he had been
intimidated by San Francisco police and that the
state is threatening to revoke his parole unless he
testifies. He currently is in custody as a parole
violator.
White said he and defense attorney Roger
Pierucci later had a tape-recorded interview with
Harris in the presence of Assistant Dist. Atty.
Robert Podesta, Homicide Inspector Gus Coreris
and Harris' court-appointed lawyer.
"We've got authenticiation and verification on
tape recanting his testimony," White told the judge.
"They've got a witness who has now said in the
presence of all these persons that he was intimidated
into saying these things, in effect, he was lying."
Betty Ford Reeeives Anti-ERA Mail
WASHINGTON — Betty Ford's mail at the White
House is running 3 to 1 against her outspoken
support of passage of the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) to the Constitution to end sex
discrimination.
Press Secretary Sheila Weidenfeld said yesterday
that mail the White House has counted so far shows
360 in praise of Mrs. Ford's efforts and 1,128
against.
The First Lady's staff was not reluctant to
announce the figures and Mrs. Ford was reported
unperturbed by the reaction. "She expected it,"
said Weidenfeld,
Mrs. Ford has been telephoning and writing
legislators in several states where ERA has come up
for action recently, including Illinois, Missouri,
North Dakota, Arizona and Nevada. Thirty-four of
the necessary 38 states have ratified the
amendment.
She says she plans to continue her personal effort
despite the setback of votes in states such as
Arizona, Nevada and Utah.
Irish Union Postponed
DUBLIN, Ireland — Irish Foreign Minister Garret
Fitzgerald says sectarian strife in Northern Ireland,
including "the murderous campaign" of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) and Protestant paramilitary
gangs reacting against IRA activities, has postponed
a reunion of divided Ireland indefinitely.
He also says a search for a solution "curiously"
has intensified contacts between politicians from
Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, "but the
gulf created by the IRA activity will take a long
time to bridge."
Fitzgerald expressed the view that the gulf
between Ireland's feuding Roman Catholics and
Protestants ultimately may be bridged through the
interests they both share in the European Common
Market.
He said "it would involve a period of peace
during which people can turn their minds away

from their own miseries in this terrible situation and
look further afield and see what's happening."
"We in the south and north have common
interests not shared with Great Britain," he added.
Among these, Fitzgerald cited the agricultural
benefits to both parts of Ireland in remaining part
of the Common Market even if Britain decides to
pull out.
Court Extends Search Protection
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme
Court declared yesterday that the state constitution
guarantees greater protection against unreasonable
search than the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Supreme
Court.
In a 4-3 decision, the court ruled that law
enforcement officers may not make full body
searches of persons arrested for minor citation
offenses.
The state court's decision opposed the doctrine
in two 1973 U.S. Supreme Court rulings allowing
unrestricted searches of all persons subjected to
"custodial arrest."
The state court's ruling came on the appeal of a
man convicted of marijuana possession after officers
stopped him for a campground violation and
searched him.
"In determining that California citizens are
entitled to greater protection under the California
constitution against unreasonable searches and
seizures than that required by the U.S. Constitution,
we are embarking on no revolutionary course,"
Justice Stanley Mosk said in the majority opinion.
"Rather, we are simply affirming the basic
principles of federalism — that the nation as a whole
is composed of distinct geographical and political
entities bound together by a fundamental federal
law but nonetheless independently responsible for
safeguarding the rights of their citizens," Mosk said.
Montreal Will Host Olympics
LAUSANNE, Switzerland — The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) announced firmly last
night that the 1976 Summer Games will go on in
Montreal as planned, with only minor
modifications.
The lOC executive board spent five hours
questioning the Montreal Organizing Committee
about soaring costs and strikes that have set the
construction program months behind schedule.
Afterward, Lord Kjllanin, president of the lOC,
told a news conference: "On the evidence presented
to us today, and with the good will and support of
the people of Quebec and Montreal, I have no doubt
that the Olympic buildings will be completed in
ample time ... and the Olympic Games will open in
Montreal on July 17, 1976."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today and tonight with chance of
sprinkles. Fair tomorrow. Little temperature

House is running 3 to 1 against her outspoken
support of passage of the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) to the Constitution to end sex
discrimination.
Press Secretary Sheila Weidenfeld said yesterday
that mail the White House has counted so far shows
360 in praise of Mrs. Ford's efforts and 1,128
against.
The First Lady's staff was not reluctant to
announce the figures and Mrs. Ford was reported
unperturbed by the reaction. "She expected it,"
said Weidenfeld,
Mrs. Ford has been telephoning and writing
legislators in several states where ERA has come up
for action recently, including Illinois, Missouri,
North Dakota, Arizona and Nevada. Thirty-four of
the necessary 38 states have ratified the
amendment.
She says she plans to continue her personal effort
despite the setback of votes in states such as
Arizona, Nevada and Utah.
Irish Union Postponed
DUBLIN, Ireland — Irish Foreign Minister Garret
Fitzgerald says sectarian strife in Northern Ireland,
including "the murderous campaign" of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) and Protestant paramilitary
gangs reacting against IRA activities, has postponed
a reunion of divided Ireland indefinitely.
He also says a search for a solution "curiously"
has intensified contacts between politicians from
Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, "but the
gulf created by the IRA activity will take a long
time to bridge."
Fitzgerald expressed the view that the gulf
between Ireland's feuding Roman Catholics and
Protestants ultimately may be bridged through the
interests they both share in the European Common
Market.
He said "it would involve a period of peace
during which people can turn their minds away

from their own miseries in this terrible situation and
look further afield and see what's happening."
"We in the south and north have common
interests not shared with Great Britain," he added.
Among these, Fitzgerald cited the agricultural
benefits to both parts of Ireland in remaining part
of the Common Market even if Britain decides to
pull out.
Court Extends Search Protection
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme
Court declared yesterday that the state constitution
guarantees greater protection against unreasonable
search than the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Supreme
Court.
In a 4-3 decision, the court ruled that law
enforcement officers may not make full body
searches of persons arrested for minor citation
offenses.
The state court's decision opposed the doctrine
in two 1973 U.S. Supreme Court rulings allowing
unrestricted searches of all persons subjected to
"custodial arrest."
The state court's ruling came on the appeal of a
man convicted of marijuana possession after officers
stopped him for a campground violation and
searched him.
"In determining that California citizens are
entitled to greater protection under the California
constitution against unreasonable searches and
seizures than that required by the U.S. Constitution,
we are embarking on no revolutionary course,"
Justice Stanley Mosk said in the majority opinion.
"Rather, we are simply affirming the basic
principles of federalism — that the nation as a whole
is composed of distinct geographical and political
entities bound together by a fundamental federal
law but nonetheless independently responsible for
safeguarding the rights of their citizens," Mosk said.
Montreal Will Host Olympics
LAUSANNE, Switzerland — The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) announced firmly last
night that the 1976 Summer Games will go on in
Montreal as planned, with only minor
modifications.
The lOC executive board spent five hours
questioning the Montreal Organizing Committee
about soaring costs and strikes that have set the
construction program months behind schedule.
Afterward, Lord Kjllanin, president of the lOC,
told a news conference: "On the evidence presented
to us today, and with the good will and support of
the people of Quebec and Montreal, I have no doubt
that the Olympic buildings will be completed in
ample time ... and the Olympic Games will open in
Montreal on July 17, 1976."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today and tonight with chance of
sprinkles. Fair tomorrow. Little temperature
change. Low both nights in the 40s. High today and
tomorrow in the mid to upper 50s.
Colby Admits Congressional Files
WASHINGTON - Director William E. Colby said
yesterday the Central Intelligency Agency once kept
files on four congressmen and did not deny that the
agency has used sex traps to gain information from
foreigners.
But Colby said these and other activities by the
agency have been greatly exaggerated in a way that
has "placed American intelligence in danger."
"I won't say that sex and intelligence never got
together," Colby testified before an open meeting
of the House defense appropriations subcommittee.
But he told the subcommittee in his first public
testimony on alleged domestic spying by the CIA
that he preferred to withhold for a closed session
any further comment on a published account of sex
traps.
Columnist Jack Anderson has reported that the
Drug Enforcement Administration had maintained
apartments that it allowed the CIA to use as sex
lairs to obtain information from foreigners.
Colby said the CIA has discovered several
mistakes in his earlier testimony before a closed
meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Panel Rejeets Low-Interest Bill
WASHINGTON — House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry Reuss (D-Wis.), pulled back a
controversial bill yesterday ordering allocation of
credit according to national priorities in hopes of
working out a compromise with the administration.
But the committee did adopt, 26-10, a
nonbinding sense of Congress resolution urging the
Federal Reserve Board to change its money
management in order to lower long-term interest
rates and ultimately decrease employment.
Critics of the resolution said it was virtually
meaningless because it would not have the force of
law.
The committee first tabled, then revived
temporarily and ultimately defeated, a bill by Reuss
that would have ordered the Federal Reserve to
lower long-term interest rates and bring about a
lower jobless rate.
The committee then approved the nonbinding
resolution.
Chairman Arthur Burns of the Federal Reserve
Board, in an unusual 3'/2-hour meeting with the
Banking Committee on Wednesday night, opposed
both the credit allocation and interest rate
reduction bills.
Zebra Witness MLied*
SAN FRANCISCO — The prosecution's key
witness in the Zebra murder case was intimidated by
police and now has recanted some of his testimony,
the defense counsel says.
Clinton White, attorney for three of the four
defendants, has asked Superior Court Judge Joseph
Karesh to order a private interview for defense
counsel with informant Anthony C. Harris, the key
witness.

Harris, 29, a paroled burglar, had testified before
a grand jury that he witnessed seven of the 13 Zebra
murders of white victims by black assailants.
White disclosed Wednesday that Harris recently
sent him two letters claiming he had been
intimidated by San Francisco police and that the
state is threatening to revoke his parole unless he
testifies. He currently is in custody as a parole
violator.
White said he and defense attorney Roger
Pierucci later had a tape-recorded interview with
Harris in the presence of Assistant Dist. Atty.
Robert Podesta, Homicide Inspector Gus Coreris
and Harris' court-appointed lawyer.
"We've got authenticiation and verification on
tape recanting his testimony," White told the judge.
"They've got a witness who has now said in the
presence of all these persons that he was intimidated
into saying these things, in effect, he was lying."

night that the 1976 Summer Games will go on in
Montreal as planned, with only minor
modifications.
The lOC executive board spent five hours
questioning the Montreal Organizing Committee
about soaring costs and strikes that have set the
construction program months behind schedule.
Afterward, Lord Kjllanin, president of the lOC,
told a news conference: "On the evidence presented
to us today, and with the good will and support of
the people of Quebec and Montreal, I have no doubt
that the Olympic buildings will be completed in
ample time ... and the Olympic Games will open in
Montreal on July 17, 1976."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today and tonight with chance of
sprinkles. Fair tomorrow. Little temperature
change. Low both nights in the 40s. High today and
tomorrow in the mid to upper 50s.
Colby Admits Congressional Files
WASHINGTON - Director William E. Colby said
yesterday the Central Intelligency Agency once kept
files on four congressmen and did not deny that the
agency has used sex traps to gain information from
foreigners.
But Colby said these and other activities by the
agency have been greatly exaggerated in a way that
has "placed American intelligence in danger."
"I won't say that sex and intelligence never got
together," Colby testified before an open meeting
of the House defense appropriations subcommittee.
But he told the subcommittee in his first public
testimony on alleged domestic spying by the CIA
that he preferred to withhold for a closed session
any further comment on a published account of sex
traps.
Columnist Jack Anderson has reported that the
Drug Enforcement Administration had maintained
apartments that it allowed the CIA to use as sex
lairs to obtain information from foreigners.
Colby said the CIA has discovered several
mistakes in his earlier testimony before a closed
meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Panel Rejeets Low-Interest Bill
WASHINGTON — House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry Reuss (D-Wis.), pulled back a
controversial bill yesterday ordering allocation of
credit according to national priorities in hopes of
working out a compromise with the administration.
But the committee did adopt, 26-10, a
nonbinding sense of Congress resolution urging the
Federal Reserve Board to change its money
management in order to lower long-term interest
rates and ultimately decrease employment.
Critics of the resolution said it was virtually
meaningless because it would not have the force of
law.
The committee first tabled, then revived
temporarily and ultimately defeated, a bill by Reuss
that would have ordered the Federal Reserve to
lower long-term interest rates and bring about a
lower jobless rate.
The committee then approved the nonbinding
resolution.
Chairman Arthur Burns of the Federal Reserve
Board, in an unusual 3'/2-hour meeting with the
Banking Committee on Wednesday night, opposed
both the credit allocation and interest rate
reduction bills.
Zebra Witness MLied*
SAN FRANCISCO — The prosecution's key
witness in the Zebra murder case was intimidated by
police and now has recanted some of his testimony,
the defense counsel says.
Clinton White, attorney for three of the four
defendants, has asked Superior Court Judge Joseph
Karesh to order a private interview for defense
counsel with informant Anthony C. Harris, the key
witness.

Harris, 29, a paroled burglar, had testified before
a grand jury that he witnessed seven of the 13 Zebra
murders of white victims by black assailants.
White disclosed Wednesday that Harris recently
sent him two letters claiming he had been
intimidated by San Francisco police and that the
state is threatening to revoke his parole unless he
testifies. He currently is in custody as a parole
violator.
White said he and defense attorney Roger
Pierucci later had a tape-recorded interview with
Harris in the presence of Assistant Dist. Atty.
Robert Podesta, Homicide Inspector Gus Coreris
and Harris' court-appointed lawyer.
"We've got authenticiation and verification on
tape recanting his testimony," White told the judge.
"They've got a witness who has now said in the
presence of all these persons that he was intimidated
into saying these things, in effect, he was lying."
Betty Ford Reeeives Anti-ERA Mail
WASHINGTON — Betty Ford's mail at the White
House is running 3 to 1 against her outspoken
support of passage of the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) to the Constitution to end sex
discrimination.
Press Secretary Sheila Weidenfeld said yesterday
that mail the White House has counted so far shows
360 in praise of Mrs. Ford's efforts and 1,128
against.
The First Lady's staff was not reluctant to
announce the figures and Mrs. Ford was reported
unperturbed by the reaction. "She expected it,"
said Weidenfeld,
Mrs. Ford has been telephoning and writing
legislators in several states where ERA has come up
for action recently, including Illinois, Missouri,
North Dakota, Arizona and Nevada. Thirty-four of
the necessary 38 states have ratified the
amendment.
She says she plans to continue her personal effort
despite the setback of votes in states such as
Arizona, Nevada and Utah.
Irish Union Postponed
DUBLIN, Ireland — Irish Foreign Minister Garret
Fitzgerald says sectarian strife in Northern Ireland,
including "the murderous campaign" of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) and Protestant paramilitary
gangs reacting against IRA activities, has postponed
a reunion of divided Ireland indefinitely.
He also says a search for a solution "curiously"
has intensified contacts between politicians from
Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, "but the
gulf created by the IRA activity will take a long
time to bridge."
Fitzgerald expressed the view that the gulf
between Ireland's feuding Roman Catholics and
Protestants ultimately may be bridged through the
interests they both share in the European Common
Market.
He said "it would involve a period of peace
during which people can turn their minds away

from their own miseries in this terrible situation and
look further afield and see what's happening."
"We in the south and north have common
interests not shared with Great Britain," he added.
Among these, Fitzgerald cited the agricultural
benefits to both parts of Ireland in remaining part
of the Common Market even if Britain decides to
pull out.
Court Extends Search Protection
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme
Court declared yesterday that the state constitution
guarantees greater protection against unreasonable
search than the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Supreme
Court.
In a 4-3 decision, the court ruled that law
enforcement officers may not make full body
searches of persons arrested for minor citation
offenses.
The state court's decision opposed the doctrine
in two 1973 U.S. Supreme Court rulings allowing
unrestricted searches of all persons subjected to
"custodial arrest."
The state court's ruling came on the appeal of a
man convicted of marijuana possession after officers
stopped him for a campground violation and
searched him.
"In determining that California citizens are
entitled to greater protection under the California
constitution against unreasonable searches and
seizures than that required by the U.S. Constitution,
we are embarking on no revolutionary course,"
Justice Stanley Mosk said in the majority opinion.
"Rather, we are simply affirming the basic
principles of federalism — that the nation as a whole
is composed of distinct geographical and political
entities bound together by a fundamental federal
law but nonetheless independently responsible for
safeguarding the rights of their citizens," Mosk said.

murders of white victims by black assailants.
White disclosed Wednesday that Harris recently
sent him two letters claiming he had been
intimidated by San Francisco police and that the
state is threatening to revoke his parole unless he
testifies. He currently is in custody as a parole
violator.
White said he and defense attorney Roger
Pierucci later had a tape-recorded interview with
Harris in the presence of Assistant Dist. Atty.
Robert Podesta, Homicide Inspector Gus Coreris
and Harris' court-appointed lawyer.
"We've got authenticiation and verification on
tape recanting his testimony," White told the judge.
"They've got a witness who has now said in the
presence of all these persons that he was intimidated
into saying these things, in effect, he was lying."
Betty Ford Reeeives Anti-ERA Mail
WASHINGTON — Betty Ford's mail at the White
House is running 3 to 1 against her outspoken
support of passage of the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) to the Constitution to end sex
discrimination.
Press Secretary Sheila Weidenfeld said yesterday
that mail the White House has counted so far shows
360 in praise of Mrs. Ford's efforts and 1,128
against.
The First Lady's staff was not reluctant to
announce the figures and Mrs. Ford was reported
unperturbed by the reaction. "She expected it,"
said Weidenfeld,
Mrs. Ford has been telephoning and writing
legislators in several states where ERA has come up
for action recently, including Illinois, Missouri,
North Dakota, Arizona and Nevada. Thirty-four of
the necessary 38 states have ratified the
amendment.
She says she plans to continue her personal effort
despite the setback of votes in states such as
Arizona, Nevada and Utah.
Irish Union Postponed
DUBLIN, Ireland — Irish Foreign Minister Garret
Fitzgerald says sectarian strife in Northern Ireland,
including "the murderous campaign" of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) and Protestant paramilitary
gangs reacting against IRA activities, has postponed
a reunion of divided Ireland indefinitely.
He also says a search for a solution "curiously"
has intensified contacts between politicians from
Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, "but the
gulf created by the IRA activity will take a long
time to bridge."
Fitzgerald expressed the view that the gulf
between Ireland's feuding Roman Catholics and
Protestants ultimately may be bridged through the
interests they both share in the European Common
Market.
He said "it would involve a period of peace
during which people can turn their minds away

from their own miseries in this terrible situation and
look further afield and see what's happening."
"We in the south and north have common
interests not shared with Great Britain," he added.
Among these, Fitzgerald cited the agricultural
benefits to both parts of Ireland in remaining part
of the Common Market even if Britain decides to
pull out.
Court Extends Search Protection
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme
Court declared yesterday that the state constitution
guarantees greater protection against unreasonable
search than the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Supreme
Court.
In a 4-3 decision, the court ruled that law
enforcement officers may not make full body
searches of persons arrested for minor citation
offenses.
The state court's decision opposed the doctrine
in two 1973 U.S. Supreme Court rulings allowing
unrestricted searches of all persons subjected to
"custodial arrest."
The state court's ruling came on the appeal of a
man convicted of marijuana possession after officers
stopped him for a campground violation and
searched him.
"In determining that California citizens are
entitled to greater protection under the California
constitution against unreasonable searches and
seizures than that required by the U.S. Constitution,
we are embarking on no revolutionary course,"
Justice Stanley Mosk said in the majority opinion.
"Rather, we are simply affirming the basic
principles of federalism — that the nation as a whole
is composed of distinct geographical and political
entities bound together by a fundamental federal
law but nonetheless independently responsible for
safeguarding the rights of their citizens," Mosk said.
Montreal Will Host Olympics
LAUSANNE, Switzerland — The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) announced firmly last
night that the 1976 Summer Games will go on in
Montreal as planned, with only minor
modifications.

questioning the Montreal Organizing Committee
about soaring costs and strikes that have set the
construction program months behind schedule.
Afterward, Lord Kjllanin, president of the lOC,
told a news conference: "On the evidence presented
to us today, and with the good will and support of
the people of Quebec and Montreal, I have no doubt
that the Olympic buildings will be completed in
ample time ... and the Olympic Games will open in
Montreal on July 17, 1976."
