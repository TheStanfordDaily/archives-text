# Crowd Mourns 'Death' Of Undergrad Education
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
Some 300 students yesterday
attended a noon rally in White Plaza
and then marched in a mock funeral
procession protesting what they called
"the death of undergraduate
education" at Stanford.
The demonstration was called to
emphasize the impact on
undergraduates of tenure cutbacks,
innovative program and financial aid
cuts and increased tuition, according
to ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton.
Under bright sunshine, about 10
Stanford Bandsmen played a funeral
dirge to begin the rally.
"We have gathered here to bid a
fond farewell to one who has always
been close to our hearts," said Silton,
delivering a mock eulogy for the
"death" of undergraduate education.
"I know her death may come as a
surprise to many of you . . . The illness
has been a long, painful, lingering one
and there were many who predicted
that there could be no recovery. And
yet, many of us did hold out hope

until the very end . .
Standing next to a black mock
casket, Silton added, "The heavy doses
of minority admissions, academic
freedom, political awareness and
student involvement brought about
marked changes for the better. But as
the supply of student involvement ran
low, the administration started
withdrawing the patient from the
other preparations, and we all know
what it has led to. Another death in
the family."
'More Like Corporation'
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Michelle
Rosaldo, a SWOPSI Policy Board
member, said students should continue
to voice their concerns for projects
like SCIRE and SWOPSI because
"someone wants to turn this place into
a place more like a corporation than a
school."
Political Science Prof. Charles
Drekmeier said the University faced
"increased dependence on outside
funding" which threatens its
independence and, "most
importantly," projects like SWOPSI
and SCIRE.
Ricardo Reyna, a junior
representing a group called Students
for Equity, noted his group supported
the demonstration. Students for
Equity, according to Reyna, is an
"umbrella organization for all
minorities" organized to oppose the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA) proposal to the Faculty
Senate (see story on this page).
'Homogenized Students'
"The University is trying to create a
homogenized student population and
destroy dissidents," Reyna charged.
Mike Kieschnick, one of the
student organizers of the rally,
concluded, saying, "We should be
angry with people like Dean [of
Undergraduate Studies James] Gibbs,
President [Richard) Lyman and
Provost [William F.j Miller, but we
should remember that they were

carefully trained for the roles they're
playing."
He charged that at the University,
"There's no commitment to teaching,
no commitment to minorities, and no
commitment to innovation — that's
clear."
'Fire Gibbs'
Kieschnick received the loudest
applause of the day when he
concluded his speech by calling on the
students to "work to have Dean Gibbs
fired."
After the speeches, Silton, wearing
a long black cape, led a procession
from White Plaza to the President's
Office in the Quad.
Four student pallbearers, carrying
the mock casket, walked solemnly
behind her. Four drummers playing a
cadence came next, followed by
approximately 150 students, some
carrying signs protesting the C-UAFA
proposal and the SWOPSI-SCIRE
cutbacks.
Petition
Lyman and Miller met the marchers
in front of the president's office. The
crowd cheered when Silton handed
Miller a petition with what she said
were over 2000 student signatures.
The petition protested the proposed
elimination of SWOPSI and SCIRE. "I
think I've seen some of these
signatures before," Miller replied.
Lyman commented that the
procession was "more like an Irish
wake than a funeral."
"Bullshit," said one student.
"Now that's not nice language for a
funeral," Lyman retorted.
Packard Gift?
"How many millions did David
Packard [electronics magnate] give
you after [former Prof. H. Bruce]
Franklin was fired?" one angry
student asked Lyman.
"Zero," replied Lyman through
clenched teeth.
Responding to the student protest,
Miller said, "Reports of what the
