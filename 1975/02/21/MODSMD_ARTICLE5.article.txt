# Fee Assessment Possible?
## Parking Suit Money Gone 
### KATHY BATTS 
Escondido Village Council
President Cathy Colson said yesterday
that legal funds financing the ASSU's
class action suit against the University
over parking stickers have been
exhausted.
She said the $3000 in ASSU and
Escondido Village funds had been used
up in preparing the suit and in the
unsuccessful request for a preliminary
injunction to prevent ticketing of
stickerless cars.
ASSU Sen. Mike Lindsey said he
plans to introduce a resolution at the
next Senate meeting calling for a $1
fee assessment on the spring ballot to
finance the suit.

Colson said attorney Dent Hand
still thinks "we've got a good case"
and wants to continue with the suit.
She claimed that Hand has only lost
one jury trial in his career.
A fee assessment could generate
some $10,000 in revenue for a legal
fund. Historically, approximately 10
percent of the student body applies
for refunds from assessments.
Lindsey charged the University
with using delaying tactics, waiting
until the ASSU ran out of money.
'Fighting Ourselves'
"In a way, the students are getting
socked twice," he said. "Not only will
they pay a fee assessment, but the
University is paying its legal fees out

of the general fund, which is made up
of our tuition money. It's practically
like fighting ourselves."
Lindsey said he had discussed the
assessment proposal with Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Dale Snape last
night. He said Snape had indicated a
willingness to seek out administrative
reaction to the proposal.
However, he added that Snape
thought the University would refuse to
collect an assessment which would be
used against itself.
'Would Pass*
Lindsey said he thought an
assessment would pass
overwhelmingly. He likened it to a
referendum on the entire issue.
Colson said she was again going to
talk with Ombudsman John Goheen in
an effort to negotiate with the
University. She said she had tried to
negotiate twice before beginning legal
action but said the University had
refused to cooperate.
In a separate but similar case,
business student Steve Finkler, a
resident of Escondido Village, is
challenging his parking ticket in Palo
Alto-Mountain View Municipal Court
Monday. Finkler said he was cited for
parking his car in his parking space
without a sticker.
"I only wanted to use my ticket as
a test case," he added. "I went out and
bought a sticker the next day."
Other Escondido residents
challenging their tickets in municipal
court are Thomas Yarnell (March 3)
and OmerGokcek (March 12).
Policy Delay
Colson added that the University's
decision on a parking policy for next
year would not be finalized until
summer. Originally, Peter Carpenter,
vice president for medical affairs, had
said he hoped that the final
recommendations of his parking study
would be available by late February,
and that a University decision would
be reached before the end of spring
quarter.
"That's just ridiculous," Colson
said. "The University always reaches
big decisions when there are very few
students around. When they decided
to charge a parking fee for the rest of
the year, it was during Christmas
break."
Citing a further legal entanglement,
Colson claimed that some campus
police ticketers are not deputized
Santa Clara County sheriffs, but
simply community safety officers.
