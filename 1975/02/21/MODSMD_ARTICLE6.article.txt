Stanford's Overseas Studies Office seems to be sailing
away from the wants of students. We believe that in recent
months officials of the program have made several
unfortunate decisions.
First, the office has imported misinformation harmful to
the plans of many students. Autumn quarter, it said that
half the spaces at Cliveden this summer would be available
to students not enrolled in the special health care and
delivery program.
Then, after demand for the focus program exceeded
expectations, officials reversed their field and decided to fill
all spaces with students attending the special program.
This is particularly unfair to those students who are
leaving for Britain spring quarter. They will not be able to
continue their studies there in the summer. Instead, overseas
studies officials are telling them, "We're sorry. Wouldn't you
like to transfer to Florence?"
Furthermore, it is very late to tell those students who
were planning to spend the summer at Cliveden that there is
no space for them. It is rather late for students who had
made such plans to make alternate plans or find summer
jobs, especially during the current economic squeeze.
Second, we think it is generally undesirable lo limit
overseas campuses to only those persons wishing to
participate in special programs. Some students can only
attend overseas programs during specified quarters during
their four yeas. It's unfair to limit their opportunities.
We think at least 50 percent of all spaces at overseas
campuses should be reserved for the general student.
Finally, we oppose such measures as elimination of the
three-week travel break and four-day academic week. Travel
is an important part of studying overseas, and we think these
changes unduly restrict such travel.
We do, however, favor increasing the academic rigor of
overseas campuses to a level similar to that on the home
campus. But there is no reason that rigorous classwork
cannot be confined to four days a week, giving the student
the option of taking a three-day trip or studying on
weekends.
