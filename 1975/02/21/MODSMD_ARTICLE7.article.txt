# Reinstate The 'D'
## 
### 
I heartily agree with the
recommendations of the Ad Hoc
Panel on the Grading System, but
they did not go far enough. The
concentration of grades in the A
and B categories is vicious and all
the ill effects mentioned by Prof.
David Kennedy are apparent.
C should be the grade
indicating satisfactory work "by
Stanford standards." It is idiotic
to say that Stanford students are
better than others and so should
receive better grades. C has always
meant average work and hence
should be the average grade given.
This can only be accomplished if
there is an appropriate grade for
below average work, namely a D.
It is a statistical fact that not
everyone can be above average.
The following would be valid
and useful changes, in my
opinion:
1) Make A, B, C, D, P (for
Pass), and NC (for No Credit) the
only permanent grades. I (for
Incomplete) would be the only
temporary grade.
2) The pass option must be
made on the study list submitted
at the beginning of the quarter
and would be restricted to only
two courses a quarter outside of
the student's major department.
3) CPA would only be
calculated on the letter grades A,
B, C, D received for courses that

count, i.e., for graduation. NC
should not be figured in the GPA
as at some universities.
4) All courses dropped or
failed after study lists are
submitted (two to three weeks into
the quarter) would receive a NC
grade. The University will merely
be stating a fact: the course was
taken but credit was not received.
5) Courses (either passed or
failed) may freely be retaken, in
which case the old record will be
preserved but not counted for
graduation or GPA.
Theoretically the "pass option"
is supposed to be made at the
middle of the quarter, but this is
not always done and certainly
some professors have difficulty
getting students' decisions.
If the decision were made on
the study list, an advisor might be
able to exert some influence and
the decision would be indicated
on the grade list given to the
faculty, thus avoiding a lot of
confusion.
Grades should indicate the
quality of work done, and if
students became less protective
and defensive, they would realize
that a system with more variety
and less loopholes would be
better.
