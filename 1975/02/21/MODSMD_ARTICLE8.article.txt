### 
Who's Exploiting Whom?
Editor:
For myself, and for most of us
on the Stanford UFW support
committee, the reaction to Peter
I. Ferrara's pessimistic report of
the UFW's status in this country
(Daily, Feb. 18) was both
saddened and amused.
The writer of that article is,
indeed, a knowledgeable person
who can support his opinions with
many carefully chosen facts,
financial records, and statistical
tables from reliable sources.
He exemplifies the calm,
rational, businesslike approach to
UFW concerns that has been
employed by so many of our
opponents, in an effort to
discredit Cesar Chavez, the farm
workers of California, and the
many support groups throughout
the U.S. This is sad!
More humorous and ironic is
that the report came to us all the
way from the ivy-covered walls of
Harvard University, physically
about as far removed from the
California struggle as one could
get in this country. Therefore, I
question whether Ferrara can

validly criticize the UFW, and the
boycott, as he has just done.
I doubt if he ever stood on a
picket line, or whether he
presently pays any attention to
lines outside the big New England
chain stores. Perhaps he once
attended a support meeting at his
school, or nearby, and reacted
negatively to our methods and
motives.
It's unfortunate that he, and
many others, have never
encountered the spirit of a UFW
rally in Salinas, or a candlelight
march in San Francisco. Nor have
they been part of a union meeting
on Friday evening at the hiring
hall in Delano, nor felt the good
energy generated during a work
weekend at the retirement village
there.
It is unfortunate, because
without these solidarity
experiences as a part of us, it is
very easy to become discouraged
with, and disillusioned in, the
UFW boycott.
I'd like to invite Ferrara and
his Harvard friends to take a study
break next weekend, to be present
at and to share in the Modesto
rally on March 1. There, I think,
he'd be able to get first-hand
accounts, from the farm workers

themselves, as to who's been
exploiting whom in the fields.

Flo Mo Is Noisy
Editor:
Larry Horton has again
demonstrated his total disregard
for the rights of the students. He
has pushed through the Florence
Moore additions without the least
regard for present residents. At
Horton's initial meeting with Flo
Mo students he assured them that
a committee made up of Flo Mo
residents would be formed.
He gave the specific impression
that this group would have the
ability to stop the project. At the
first meeting the group was told
that they were merely an advisory
group with no real power over the
eventual decision. It was clear
from the beginning that Horton
had already decided to go through
with the plan. Horton asked that
the committee not address itself
to compensation until after the
project had begun.
Now that the project has begun -
complete with buzz saws, jack
hammers, and diesel fumes â€” all
discussion of compensation
given a negative response. I must

admit I was deceived by Horton. I
hope that everyone in Stanford
can learn from Flo Mo's
experience with Horton.
Perhaps the day will come
when everyone appreciates
Horton for what he really is, and
no longer falls prey to his
multitude of lies.

Editor:
With regard to Douglas Oles'
column entitled "Overseas Study"
(Daily, Feb. 18), we here at
Humanities Special Programs are
completely unaware of any
"pressures for curtailment or
elimination" of any of our
programs.
We are sure that Oles has made
an honest error, but we hasten to
stress, in particular for those
students involved in our various
programs, that we are still
prospering and expect to continue
to do so without serious
curtailment of our offerings as a
result of the current budget crisis.
