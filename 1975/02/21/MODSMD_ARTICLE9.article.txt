# Thatcher, Hills Not Two Of A Kind

### Stephen Carter 
What future can there be for a
middle-aged former Oxford student who just
happens to be female?
In Great Britain and the United States,
these seem sufficient qualifications for a
woman to become the center of political
controversy.
The women, of course, are Margaret
Thatcher, newly elected head of Britain's
Conservative Party, and Carla Anderson Hills,
whom President Ford has just nominated as
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development.
Both women replace men who were
notoriously unsuccessful at their posts.
If confirmed by the Senate, Hills, a
Stanford alumna who earlier studied at
Oxford, would replace James T. Lynn. Lynn,
having managed the housing industry into an
ever-deepening depression, has moved on to
head the Office of Management and Budget,
where he wiL undoubtedly carry on that
agency's glorious record of achievement.
Replaced Heath
Thatcher rather predictably replaced
former Prime Minister Edward Heath as the
Party's leader. Heath had led the Tories to
ignominious defeat in two successive national
elections.
Both women have come under fire of late,
Hills from members of the Senate which
must confirm her and lobbying organizations
she must deal with, Thatcher from some
within her party and many without.
Hills has been attacked primarily because
she lacks experience and qualifications —
which is true. Sen. William Proxmire
(D-Wisc.), chairman of the committee which
must hold hearings on the nomination
immediately, lambasted the nomination.

"This is not the time for on-the-job training
of a new Secretary of H.U.D.," he stated.
Others — among them that bastion of
liberalism (and hence, ipso facto defender of
all women in government), the New York
Times — leaped to her defense.
'Times' Defense
"In an area such as housing and urban
affairs, where stale approaches have failed to
solve long-festering problems — made more
acute by the recession — new ideas may be
worth more than mere familiarity with
established custom," the Times reasoned. It
cited Hills' "impressive credentials as a
lawyer."

It neglected to mention, of course, that
these same arguments were put forth in
defense of Lynn, who was also charged with
a lack of experience. His critics were right.
Thatcher has also been criticized roundly
for inexperience, but in her case, critics bring
back the spirit of Neville Chamberlain,
claiming Thatcher lacks experience in foreign
affairs. Her main experience in government
came as Secretary of State for Education and
Science under the Heath regime, but she has
been recognized as the main Conservative
economic spokesman in Parliament.

Her crjtics also contend, with some
justification, that she is "cold" and
"devious." For example, while serving as
Education Minister, she abolished free milk
in the schools.
Saved $20 Million
But even granting Thatcher's coldness, her
decision did save $20 million. And she was
the only major Conservative with the courage
to campaign openly against Heath. In fact,
newspapers in Britain have taken to
criticizing her clothes and the way she runs
her home — presumably because they have
exhausted the few valid criticisms.
Perhaps they fear her dazzling wit. She
once silenced the Chancellor of the
Exchequer during debate in Commons with
the observation: "Some Chancellors are
macro-economic, some just fiscal — but this
one is plain cheap."
Hills' wit — and perhaps her political
acumen as well — are evidenced by her
comment on the Justice Department, where
she is currently a top attorney: "I'm in love
with this institution."
True, all her colleagues speak well of her
— but their favorable comments all seem to
bear on her excellence as a lawyer, which no
one denies and which is not an issue, or on
her administrative capabilities, which will be
helpful, but insufficient.
Would the Times have praised Hills so
highly, were she a male? And would
Thatcher's critics quiet, were she one?
It seems Ron Nessen, presidential press
secretary, was wrong when he claimed, "Sex
is not an issue."
