# ASSU Referendum: Grading Views Poll
## 
### PETE ALESHIRE 
An ASSU referendum Wednesday
and Thursday will measure student
reactions to proposed changes in the
grading system here.
Recommendations by the Ad Hoc
Panel to Study the Grading System, a
subcommittee of the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
C-AAA), provoked student criticism
last week and spurred the ASSU
Senate to put the issue on the ballot.
The election, limited to
undergraduates and costing $300,
comes just two weeks before a report
from the full C-AAA to the Faculty
Senate is expected. Referendum
supporters have said they are hoping
the voter turnout will be heavy enough
and one-sided enough, to influence the
Faculty Senate's final decision.
Drop Deadline Vote
According to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald,
students can vote "Approve,"
"Disapprove" or "Undecided" on each
of the panel's recommendations. The
first two recommendations, which
must be voted on together, would
reinstate the deadline for dropping
courses and would return the "no
credit (NC)"notation on transcripts for
failure to complete a course dropped
after the deadline.
Other recommendations on the
ballot include requiring the Registrar's
Office to collect, distribute to deans
and publicize statistics on grading in
each school; a requirement that
incompletes be given only when most
course work has been completed, and
that other work be completed within a
year; and a provision that the
Registrar's Office should widely
publicize drop deadlines.
Heavy Turnout Needed
Both supporters and opponents of
the changes have stressed the
importance of a heavy turnout. "I
hope they get a large vote," said
Prof. Alexander Fetter, chairman
of the C-AAA. "It won't prove very
much if only 10 percent of the vote
comes out."
Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron,
the panel chairman . who voted
against the majority recommendation,
said "If it was accompanied by some
show of real interest it might affect
the outcome. If it was clear that the
ASSU had really prepared a position
and carried it to the Faculty Senate
and presented it, that would really
have an effect."
However, Fitzgerald said he doesn't
expect an unusual turnout. He
predicted a 20 to 25 percent showing.
,Andy Hsi, a senior who has
organized opposition to the panel's
recommendations, said he hopes the
referendum will be effective.
Referendum 'Crucial'
"Some of the Faculty Senate
people have given us a pretty fair
indication that the result of the
referendum will be a crucial factor in
their decision-making process," he
said. "I would like to believe faculty
people will not vote for these
proposals if many people feel this will
be detrimental to the student's
education," so in that respect the
numbers will be almost as important as
how the vote goes.
Hsi, who also helped write the
ballot, said door-to-door and leafleting
campaigns are planned.
"I would be so happy if people
would contact me," he said, "I'll be

jumping up and down in my room."
ASSU President Mike Herman was
also optimistic about the referendum.
"I think the C-AAA is very interested
in hearing what the student body has
to say. There are two levels of
effectiveness here. One is the campaign
which educates the students and the
other is the results of the vote itself."
Close Vote Likely
Fetter predicted the voting of the
full Committee will closely parallel the
5-4 vote of the Panel, and said it was
too late for the referendum to have
much effect on the C-AAA report. "I
think ultimately the issue will be
decided in the Faculty Senate and the
referendum will have value as an input
to them."
Fitzgerald pointed out that the
procedure for this election w?s
irregular because the ASSU Senate
does not have the power to call a
referendum except in the case of a
special fee assessment, and then only
by a two-thirds vote. (The Senate vote
calling for this election was 6-5). The
ASSU Constitution does, however,
make the Senate the final interpreter
of the by-laws, and Fitzgerald said he
assumed the Senate considered this a
matter of interpretation.
