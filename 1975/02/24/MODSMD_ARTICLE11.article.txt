# Minority Privileges: Discriminatory?
## 
### Jim Wascher 
Racial discrimination — that's an ugly
phrase. If you discuss it with your neighbor
in class this morning, or with your colleague
over lunch at the Faculty Club, you'll
probably find a remarkable level of consensus
opposing any manifestation of it.
Stanford people have traditionally been in
the front rank when it comes to fighting
discrimination. Eleven years ago, Stanford
students faced arrest — and even abductions
and beatings — to register black voters in
Mississippi.
Those Mississippi Freedom Riders put
their lives on the line by standing up for
equal opportunity for all Americans. And
students and faculty members back here
contributed thousands of dollars to a bail
fund for the Freedom Riders.
In 1968, only days after the assassination
of Martin Luther King, the good liberals in
the University Administration committed
themselves to an affirmative program of
minority student recruitment. And,
considering the small number of black and
chicano students here then, this was an
admirable goal.
At the time, then-Provost Richard W.
Lyman said the University "ought to strive
for social justice in everything it does."
Again, one must assume that Lyman was
advocating equal opportunity for all.
In recent years, however, Stanford and
other colleges and universities across the
country have perverted that goal — and
instituted quotas and other forms of
preferential treatment for minority students.
Hence, the birth of a new phrase: reverse
discrimination.
Recently, the Committee on

Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA) here undertook the first
institutional attempt to grapple with the
issue of reverse discrimination, although they
did not label their efforts as such.
In considering the so-called "special
package" of financial aid currently offered to
needy students, C-UAFA "decided to retain
the special package concept but to remove
the ethnic standard for eligibility and replace
it with an economic one, very low income
status."

What C-UAFA wanted to do was return to
the old standard which Stanford people
fought for in the '60s: equal opportunity
regardless of race. And C-UAFA was right.
Blacks and other minorities should be
encouraged to apply here, should have the
same chance for admission as whites, and
upon admission, should be guaranteed
financial aid if they need it. This is not
racism; it is egalitarianism.
In response to protests from minority
student groups, the Faculty Senate Thursday
stepped back somewhat from the C-UAFA
recommendations, but still abolished race as

an original criterion for determining who
shall or shall not receive various forms of
assistance.
Eventually, though, the University is also
going to have to tackle the issue of
preferential admissions consideration for
minority students applying to the law,
medical and other pre-professional schools.
A Yolo County Superior Court judge
handed down a preliminary ruling last
month, opining that the UC-Davis Medical
School's admissions policy violated a white
applicant's right to the equal protection of
the laws. The applicant, one Allan Bakke,
alleged that he was twice denied admission
despite being more qualified than minority
applicants who were admitted.
Some legal observers believe that Bakke's
case stands an excellent chance of eventually
reaching the U.S. Supreme Court on appeal.
In fact, attorneys for the University of
California are anxious to have a definitive
ruling from the High Court, which left the
issue of reverse discrimination clouded in
1973, when it refused to consider a case
similar to Bakke's arising out of the
University of Washington's law school
admissions policies (DeFunis v. Odegaard).
But even before the Supreme Court settles
the legal issues, Stanford's Administration
and Board of Trustees ought to consider the
moral issues involved in reverse
discrimination.
Is it any more just to give minorities
special privileges than it was to give those
privileges to whites?
