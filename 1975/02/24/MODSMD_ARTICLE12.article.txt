# Roots Of Iranian Tyranny Are Deep
## 
### 
First Of Two Parts
One must study Iranian history
if one is to understand the
repressiveness of its current
regime.
In 1941, the Allied invasion of
Iran ended the dictatorial Reza
khan regime and brought his son,
the present monarch, to the
throne. With the erosion of a
strong central government and
fueled by the obstinacy of
Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in
perpetuating a colonialist

situation, the Iranian National
Front emerged and gained
influence.
By strong popular will, in May
1951, Mossadegh became Prime
Minister and shocked the world
by nationalizing the oil industry
and expelling the British
technicians. This was the first
time a Middle Eastern country
had dared attack Western
interests-expelling , expropriating,
nationalizing.
The British government,
unwilling to resort to gunboat
diplomacy because of strong
anti-British feeling in Iran, as well
as Soviet proximity, turned to the
United States for help:
Washington responded favorably
to London's request, for not only
were the Americans worried that
Mossadegh's action might set an
example for other Third World
countries to follow, but they were
eager to move in where the British
had previously ruled
unchallenged.
Consequently, the
Anglo-Americans reacted to
Mossadegh's move by declaring a
world-wide boycott of Iran's oil,
and by backing reactionary
elements inside Iran who, fearful
of the reforms the National Front
planned to implement, had
gathered around the Shah, openly
plotting the overthrow of the
government.
Despite the lack of all oil
revenues the Mossadegh
government was able to survive
through wide public support.
Thus the Shah left the country to
lay the ground for a military
coup.
On Aug. 19, 1953, General
Zahedi, at the head of the
pro-Shah army elements of which
some were bribed with $10
million in American money, and
with the active participation of
CIA agents (H. Norman
Schwartzkopf and Kim Roosevelt)
marched on the capital -and after

a fierce street battle which raged
for two days, overthrew
Mossadegh and regained the
throne for the Shah.
A few months later, on Dec. 7,
1953, on the eve of Vice President
Richard Nixon's visit to Iran,
army units invaded a university
and shot three students in their
classrooms to insure political
stability. Twenty years later, a
month before the coup
overthrowing Chilean President
Allende, Nixon threatened the
"rebellious" third world countries
with the fate of Mossadegh.
The fall of Mossadegh marked
a definite turning point in Iranian
life: it put an end to democratic
government and to national
sovereignty, both replaced by
imperial dictatorship and
American hegemony.
In 1954, the right to extract oil
was granted to a consortium
giving a 40 percent share to U.S.
based companies equal to that
given to the British. Also, the
newly established American
presence in Iran would help
protect its vast economic interests.
It soon became apparent that
the imperial system's survival
depended less on its ability to
neutralize all immediate
opposition, than on a long-term
policy aimed at eradicating all
forms of expression other than
those offering total submission to
the imperial will.
From 1953, the Shah began to
grant ever-increasing powers to
the army and to the SAVAK, the
deadly, efficient political police
that was created, trained,
equipped and actively aided by
the CIA to crush all opposition to
the throne.
The 1950s ended in great
economic crisis, student-teacher
unrest and mass agitations
toppling three prime ministers
after a period of calm in the latter
half of the 19505. But this
eruption was only the culmination

Stephanie Br own

of gross injustices and
contradictions which could not
lie dormant for long.
The Kennedy Administration,
cognizant of the prophetic
rumblings for self-determination
and economic independence in
the Third World, developed a
world strategy for diffusing (and
eliminating where possible)
revolutionary potential through
reforms, civil action projects and
sophisticated police networks.

Despite the lack of all oil
revenues the Mossadegh
government was able to survive
through wide public support.
Thus the Shah left the country to
lay the ground for a military
coup.
On Aug. 19, 1953, General
Zahedi, at the head of the
pro-Shah army elements of which
some were bribed with $10
million in American money, and
with the active participation of
CIA agents (H. Norman
Schwartzkopf and Kim Roosevelt)
marched on the capital -and after

a fierce street battle which raged
for two days, overthrew
Mossadegh and regained the
throne for the Shah.
A few months later, on Dec. 7,
1953, on the eve of Vice President
Richard Nixon's visit to Iran,
army units invaded a university
and shot three students in their
classrooms to insure political
stability. Twenty years later, a
month before the coup
overthrowing Chilean President
Allende, Nixon threatened the
"rebellious" third world countries
with the fate of Mossadegh.
The fall of Mossadegh marked
a definite turning point in Iranian
life: it put an end to democratic
government and to national
sovereignty, both replaced by
imperial dictatorship and
American hegemony.
In 1954, the right to extract oil
was granted to a consortium
giving a 40 percent share to U.S.
based companies equal to that
given to the British. Also, the
newly established American
presence in Iran would help
protect its vast economic interests.
It soon became apparent that
the imperial system's survival
depended less on its ability to
neutralize all immediate
opposition, than on a long-term
policy aimed at eradicating all
forms of expression other than
those offering total submission to
the imperial will.
From 1953, the Shah began to
grant ever-increasing powers to
the army and to the SAVAK, the
deadly, efficient political police
that was created, trained,
equipped and actively aided by
the CIA to crush all opposition to
the throne.
The 1950s ended in great
economic crisis, student-teacher
unrest and mass agitations
toppling three prime ministers
after a period of calm in the latter
half of the 19505. But this
eruption was only the culmination

of gross injustices and
contradictions which could not
lie dormant for long.
The Kennedy Administration,
cognizant of the prophetic
rumblings for self-determination
and economic independence in
the Third World, developed a

First Of Two Parts
One must study Iranian history
if one is to understand the
repressiveness of its current
regime.
In 1941, the Allied invasion of
Iran ended the dictatorial Reza
khan regime and brought his son,
the present monarch, to the
throne. With the erosion of a
strong central government and
fueled by the obstinacy of
Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in
perpetuating a colonialist

situation, the Iranian National
Front emerged and gained
influence.
By strong popular will, in May
1951, Mossadegh became Prime
Minister and shocked the world
by nationalizing the oil industry
and expelling the British
technicians. This was the first
time a Middle Eastern country
had dared attack Western
interests-expelling , expropriating,
nationalizing.
The British government,
unwilling to resort to gunboat
diplomacy because of strong
anti-British feeling in Iran, as well
as Soviet proximity, turned to the
United States for help:
Washington responded favorably
to London's request, for not only
were the Americans worried that
Mossadegh's action might set an
example for other Third World
countries to follow, but they were
eager to move in where the British
had previously ruled
unchallenged.
Consequently, the
Anglo-Americans reacted to
Mossadegh's move by declaring a
world-wide boycott of Iran's oil,
and by backing reactionary
elements inside Iran who, fearful
of the reforms the National Front
planned to implement, had
gathered around the Shah, openly
plotting the overthrow of the
government.
Despite the lack of all oil
revenues the Mossadegh
government was able to survive
through wide public support.
