In Susan Luttner's Feb. 14
Daily article, "Politics Could
Underlie University/Iran
Broadcast Project," there are
three obvious errors.
First, the population of Iran is
32 million (estimated, 1973)
rather than 3.5 million.
Second, Iran is not an Arab
country as its population is
predominantly Aryan and speaks
Persian (Farsi), an Indo-European
language. Third, the CIA cannot
be blamed for putting the present
Shah in power since the CIA was
established only in 1947 while the
Shah ascended the throne in
1941. Are Luttner's other
statements equally unreliable'?

Editor:
Dean Gibbs' rationale for
cutting financial aid to incoming
minority students reflects an
elitist conception of university
education. In essence, what Gibbs
is suggesting is that Stanford is to
be accepted as it is; the student
must change to fit the university.
Those students who feel the
university should change to meet
their needs are not wanted.
By seeking minority students
of "quality" all hopes of achieving
cultural diversity are denied. The
University becomes, not a meeting
place for students from various
backgrounds, but an institution
dedicated to perpetuating the
economic and educational
cleavages evident in society at
large.
The assertion that Stanford is
becoming an increasingly
homogeneous community,
unfortunately, gains credence in
light of Gibbs' suggestions.

Bill Evers' article "Chinese
Persecuted For Efficient Work"
Daily Feb. 19, strikingly brought
to light the oppressive conditions
that confronted Chinese-American
workers and led to the formation
of the Chinatowns of the 1800s.
While Evers did a fair job in
tracing early Chinese labor
hstory, he neglected to mention
that the exploitation of the
immigrant workers was carried
out only in the face of strong
resistance. Indeed, the history of
Chinese-American workers has
been one of long and intense
struggle against the kind of
exploitative conditions which
Evers discussed.
The Jung Sai and Lee Mah
workers' strikes and the fight to
save the International Hotel in
Chinatown illustrate that this
struggle continues.
Nevertheless, the Daily is to be
commended for taking a step in
the right direction.

In Susan Luttner's Feb. 14
Daily article, "Politics Could
Underlie University/Iran
Broadcast Project," there are
three obvious errors.
First, the population of Iran is
32 million (estimated, 1973)
rather than 3.5 million.
Second, Iran is not an Arab
country as its population is
predominantly Aryan and speaks
Persian (Farsi), an Indo-European
language. Third, the CIA cannot
be blamed for putting the present
Shah in power since the CIA was
established only in 1947 while the
Shah ascended the throne in
1941. Are Luttner's other
statements equally unreliable'?

Is Diversity Lost?
Editor:
Dean Gibbs' rationale for
cutting financial aid to incoming
minority students reflects an
elitist conception of university
education. In essence, what Gibbs
is suggesting is that Stanford is to
be accepted as it is; the student
must change to fit the university.
Those students who feel the
university should change to meet
their needs are not wanted.
By seeking minority students
of "quality" all hopes of achieving
cultural diversity are denied. The
University becomes, not a meeting
place for students from various
backgrounds, but an institution
dedicated to perpetuating the
economic and educational
cleavages evident in society at
large.
The assertion that Stanford is
becoming an increasingly
homogeneous community,
unfortunately, gains credence in
light of Gibbs' suggestions.

Empty benches, empty halls.

Asian Struggle
Editor:
Bill Evers' article "Chinese
Persecuted For Efficient Work"
Daily Feb. 19, strikingly brought
to light the oppressive conditions
that confronted Chinese-American
workers and led to the formation
of the Chinatowns of the 1800s.
While Evers did a fair job in
tracing early Chinese labor
hstory, he neglected to mention
that the exploitation of the
immigrant workers was carried
out only in the face of strong
resistance. Indeed, the history of
Chinese-American workers has
been one of long and intense
struggle against the kind of
exploitative conditions which
Evers discussed.
The Jung Sai and Lee Mah
workers' strikes and the fight to
save the International Hotel in
Chinatown illustrate that this
struggle continues.
Nevertheless, the Daily is to be
commended for taking a step in
the right direction.
