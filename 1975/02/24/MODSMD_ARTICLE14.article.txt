## The
						Engineering Building May Fall But... Earthquake Would Leave Stanford Standing 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
How would Stanford fare in a
major earthquake?
During the last massive
earthquake in 1906, many of
Stanford's structures were
particularly hard hit. The
chemistry building lost its
chimneys, Memorial Church lost
its front mosaic, and the whole
front of the geology corner
collapsed.
In addition, the statue of Louis
Agassiz in front of the Quad
toppled head first onto the
pavement.
A common belief at the time
was that with such severe
shakings, extreme damage was
unavoidable. Now it is known that
those buildings suffering the most
destruction were poorly
constructed and of inferior
materials.
Agassiz Has A New Head
"In order for a building tc
stand up in an earthquake," says
Ray Ingersoll, Ph.D. candidate in
geology,"parts must move together
and the masonry must be securely
connected. When originaily built,
the Quad consisted of sandstone
blocks that each went its own
direction in the quake, instead of
moving together.

Had they moved together, the
Quad would have survived better."
Reconstruction since the 1906
quake has been sporadic because
of financial obstacles. Some pillars
and chimneys have been replaced
and all red roof tiles have been
tied down with copper wire.
Memorial Arch has been torn
down completely, and Louis
Agassiz has been bolted down and
has a new head.
All the internal damage has
been repaired.
However, according to a report,
for Geophysics 13 by Brian C.
Aronstam, the Quad still is unsafe,
having "no system of ties and
bracings."

"If a building doesn't
fall during a main
shock it may fall
in aftershocks/'

Aronstam notes that some
buildings do not meet Santa Clara
building codes, but the University
hopes that all repairs will be
completed by 1980.

Aronstam believes that the
history, and geology corners and
engineering and physiology
buildings are most likely to be
damaged in another quake. Also
dangerous could be the keystones
from the arches if they were to
become dislodged.
Those buildings that shouldn't
suffer too much damage,
according to Aronstam, are the
Old Union, the Main Library,
Meyer Library, Memorial
Auditorium and Hoover Tower,
as they are of reinforced concrete.
The Mitchell Earth Sciences
Building, in spite of its large glass
panes, should fare as well, as the
glass is designed to give in the
event of shaking.
Everyone would like to be
prepared for an earthquake, but
it's difficult to know when the
next one will strike. Geophysics
Prof. David M. Boore says,"The
art of earthquake prediction is in
a state of flux.
"We might be able to predict
some ... based on premonitory
effects. An earthquake may not
occur for another 100 years.
Right now we cannot predict over
a long period, but yes, there will
be earthquakes."

Boore points out that one of
the biggest dangers of earthquakes
is the fires that result. San
Francisco has built water
systems to cope with a fire, but
Boore is not sure that they are
adequate. Fortunately, Stanford is
probably better off.

"University Receiving
has supplies ranging
from buzz saws
to pencil erasers."

"We don't have the density
here as does the city," he says,
"and the roads would all be
passable."
Safety Officer Hilary
Ryniewicz of Occupational Health
and Safety says that the
University has "back-up water
supplies, emergency power units,
and the ground floor of the
Medical Center is earthquake
proof."
Aronstam writes that the
University has shelters with food
supplies, and "University
Receiving has supplies ranging
from buzz saws to pencil erasers

to keep Stanford functioning in
the event that the University is
self-dependent the first few days."
'Be Aware Of Aftershocks'
The University also has oil
reserves for heat and water. If the
water lines were broken,
Aronstam writes that water would
come from Searsville, Felt, and
Lagunita reservoirs.
"If the earthquake should
cause fires, the fire department
may use either of the two water
mains off campus, or the new 1
million gallon Olympic swimming
p001...
One of the most important
factors to survival is knowing
what to do in an earthquake.
Boore says, "Don't panic . • • be
aware of aftershocks. If a building
doesn't fall during a main shock,
it may fall in aftershocks."
When asked what he would do
in the event of a major
earthquake, one candid geology
professor said, "I'd get the hell
out of here."

FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM?—Fortunately enough, if Stanford
were ever hit by another earthquake like the one back in 1906,
Hoover Tower would most likely stay standing. But don't get too
complacent. As one geologist puts it, if an earthquake hits, I'd get
the hell out of here."
