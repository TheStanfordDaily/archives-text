## Card Cagers Toppled By Beavers, But Sink Ducks OSU Wins Weird One 
### DAN PYNE 
Someone suggested that an appropriate recap of the Oregon State
Affair should begin with a long string of expletives accusing officials
Mel Ross and Frank Buckiewicz of everything from incest to
blindness.
After all, it is sort of hard to explain how Stanford lost 74-68 when
Rich .Kelley had a career-high 35 points and Beavers' star Lonnie
Shelton played with four fouls hanging over his head for almost the
entire second half.
But, hard-pressed explanations are reserved for games with
Oregon. The Cards did not quite have the stuff to beat Oregon State
on Friday night.
"We started off on the wrong foot in both halves," Stanford coach

Howie Dallmar said. Indeed they
did.
Card Scott Trobbe got things
rolling after the opening tip-off,
scoring an unmolested layup in
the wrong basket. Then both
teams played some really weird
basketball for almost a half, and
then Mike Bratz dropped in a
25-footer at the halftime buzzer
to give Stanford a 40-36 lead.
Kelley had 19 points, and Shelton
had three fouls.
Shelton picked up his fourth at
the beginning of the second half,
but something happened. The
Beavers started to play well. They
opened up a 50-42 lead at 15:23,
playing a modified four-corner,
slow-down offense and scoring
mainly on short shots and lay-ins.
The Cards pulled within two,
then went ahead for a moment,
continually going to Kelley in the
middle with the hope of fouling
Shelton out. A futile effort. He
stayed in the game long enough to
score 23 points and keep the
Beavers mainly in front; fouling
out with 1:57 remaining, Oregon
State ahead 68-64.
Unfortunately, Kelley managed
to pick up his fourth and fifth
fouls during the next minute and
a half. Which is where the officials
come in.
Beaver center Doug Oxsen
took a shot with 24 seconds left,
and the Cards down by two.
Kelley blocked it, but was called
for a foul. The fans threw stuff on
the court and booed. Kelley said
afterward he didn't think he had
fouled Oxsen, and even if he had
it was a body foul, not on the
hand as the official had called.
Oxsen said, "I went up for the
shot and he [Kelley] went right
through my body and hit both
arms."
The OSU center hit both
ensuing free-throws, and that was
that. The refs were escorted out
of Maples by projectiles and
police.
The loss is crucial to the Cards,
but Kelley described the scrappy
Beavers well. "They've won most
of the close ones, and in the Pac-8
that means a lot."
Now, for those
afore-mentioned expletives.

fouled Oxsen, and even if he had
it was a body foul, not on the
hand as the official had called.
Oxsen said, "I went up for the
shot and he [Kelley] went right
through my body and hit both
arms."
The OSU center hit both
ensuing free-throws, and that was
that. The refs were escorted out
of Maples by projectiles and
police.
The loss is crucial to the Cards,
but Kelley described the scrappy
Beavers well. "They've won most
of the close ones, and in the Pac-8
that means a lot."
Now, for those

BUMP AND RUN—Lonnie Shelton gives Rich Kelley a hip as the
latter goes up for a shot in Friday night's Stanford-Oregon State (
basketball game. Referee Mel Ross, who didn't see this one (and a few
more), pleads for sympathy (insert) but got none from the Maples
crowd. The Cards lost this one, but the worst for Kelley and the refs
was yet to come. (
(
Someone suggested that an appropriate recap of the Oregon State
Affair should begin with a long string of expletives accusing officials
Mel Ross and Frank Buckiewicz of everything from incest to
blindness.
After all, it is sort of hard to explain how Stanford lost 74-68 when
Rich .Kelley had a career-high 35 points and Beavers' star Lonnie
Shelton played with four fouls hanging over his head for almost the
entire second half.
But, hard-pressed explanations are reserved for games with
Oregon. The Cards did not quite have the stuff to beat Oregon State
on Friday night.
"We started off on the wrong foot in both halves," Stanford coach

Howie Dallmar said. Indeed they
did.
Card Scott Trobbe got things
rolling after the opening tip-off,
scoring an unmolested layup in
the wrong basket. Then both
teams played some really weird
basketball for almost a half, and
then Mike Bratz dropped in a
25-footer at the halftime buzzer
to give Stanford a 40-36 lead.
Kelley had 19 points, and Shelton
had three fouls.
Shelton picked up his fourth at
the beginning of the second half,
but something happened. The
Beavers started to play well. They
opened up a 50-42 lead at 15:23,
playing a modified four-corner,
slow-down offense and scoring
mainly on short shots and lay-ins.
The Cards pulled within two,
then went ahead for a moment,
continually going to Kelley in the
middle with the hope of fouling
Shelton out. A futile effort. He
stayed in the game long enough to
score 23 points and keep the
Beavers mainly in front; fouling
out with 1:57 remaining, Oregon
State ahead 68-64.
Unfortunately, Kelley managed
to pick up his fourth and fifth
fouls during the next minute and
a half. Which is where the officials
come in.
Beaver center Doug Oxsen
took a shot with 24 seconds left,
and the Cards down by two.
Kelley blocked it, but was called
for a foul. The fans threw stuff on
the court and booed. Kelley said
afterward he didn't think he had
fouled Oxsen, and even if he had
it was a body foul, not on the
hand as the official had called.

Someone suggested that an appropriate recap of the Oregon State
Affair should begin with a long string of expletives accusing officials
Mel Ross and Frank Buckiewicz of everything from incest to
blindness.
After all, it is sort of hard to explain how Stanford lost 74-68 when
Rich .Kelley had a career-high 35 points and Beavers' star Lonnie
Shelton played with four fouls hanging over his head for almost the
entire second half.
But, hard-pressed explanations are reserved for games with
Oregon. The Cards did not quite have the stuff to beat Oregon State
on Friday night.
"We started off on the wrong foot in both halves," Stanford coach

Howie Dallmar said. Indeed they
did.
Card Scott Trobbe got things
rolling after the opening tip-off,
scoring an unmolested layup in
the wrong basket. Then both
teams played some really weird
basketball for almost a half, and
then Mike Bratz dropped in a
25-footer at the halftime buzzer
to give Stanford a 40-36 lead.
Kelley had 19 points, and Shelton
had three fouls.
Shelton picked up his fourth at
the beginning of the second half,
but something happened. The
Beavers started to play well. They
opened up a 50-42 lead at 15:23,
playing a modified four-corner,
slow-down offense and scoring
mainly on short shots and lay-ins.
The Cards pulled within two,
then went ahead for a moment,
continually going to Kelley in the
middle with the hope of fouling
Shelton out. A futile effort. He
stayed in the game long enough to
score 23 points and keep the
Beavers mainly in front; fouling
out with 1:57 remaining, Oregon
State ahead 68-64.
Unfortunately, Kelley managed
to pick up his fourth and fifth
fouls during the next minute and
a half. Which is where the officials
come in.
Beaver center Doug Oxsen
took a shot with 24 seconds left,
and the Cards down by two.
Kelley blocked it, but was called
for a foul. The fans threw stuff on
the court and booed. Kelley said
afterward he didn't think he had
fouled Oxsen, and even if he had
it was a body foul, not on the
hand as the official had called.
Oxsen said, "I went up for the
shot and he [Kelley] went right
through my body and hit both
arms."
The OSU center hit both
ensuing free-throws, and that was
that. The refs were escorted out
of Maples by projectiles and
police.
The loss is crucial to the Cards,
but Kelley described the scrappy
Beavers well. "They've won most
of the close ones, and in the Pac-8
that means a lot."
Now, for those
afore-mentioned expletives.
