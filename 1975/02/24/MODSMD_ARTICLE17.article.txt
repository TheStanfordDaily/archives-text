# Horpel Nabs Mai Crown
## 
### MARK FUNK 
Chris Horpel proved to the rest
of the Pacific Eight what Stanford
wrestling enthusiasts have been
saying this whole season: The
Cardinal Ail-American, sidelined
by an injury all last year, is back
with a vengeance.
And now he's got a Pac-8
wrestling crown to prove it.
Horpel took first place at 150
pounds when he defeated
Oregon's Doug Ziebert 9-1
Saturday night in Corvallis. It was
the zenith of an evening which
saw two other Card wrestlers
qualify for the NCAA finals at
Princeton, N.J., March 7 and 8.
Ken Krebs and John Govea
each took third place at 142 and
190 respectively and will make
the trip with Horpel back east.
In addition to the three
outstanding individual efforts,
Stanford escaped from the Pac-8
cellar. The Cards finished in sixth
place ahead of Washington State
and Southern Cal.
The meet was won by Oregon,
which scored 140 points and
racked up six individual
championships. Stanford trailed
the Ducks by 99VÂ£ points.
