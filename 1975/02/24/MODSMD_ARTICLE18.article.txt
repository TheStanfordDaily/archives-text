# Cards Face Miami At Home
## Netters Dominate NorCals 
### RON BECK 
After winning the Northern
California Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships Saturday in San
Jose and winning the National
Team Indoor Championships the
week before in Madison, Wis.,
what is the Stanford tennis team
going to do for an encore?
«"Rest," says coach Dick
Gould.
But the team won't get a
chance to rest until after this
afternoon's match against Miami,
which finished fourth in last
year's NCAA tournament.
"We've been playing for two
straight weeks now," says Gould.
"That's a lot of tennis, and we're
tired. I can't wait until after
[Miami]."
The team doesn't play in
another tournament for three
weeks and can nowget settled into
a schedule of dual match
competition. The NorCal was an
NCAA-style tournament, where
every individual match win
counted in the team's standings.
Singles The Key
Stanford outdistanced the
other five schools in the tourney
with some sharp singles playing
that placed three Card netters into
the four semifinal spots.
NCAA champ John Whitlinger
took his second NorCal singles
title in a row by beating Pat
DuPre in the semis and Joe
Meyers of San Jose State in the
finals. Meyers had topped Mark
Mitchell in the other semifinal
round.
In the doubles bracket, it was
the first time in four years that a
Chip Fisher team didn't win the
title. It was the first time in even
longer that a team from Stanford
didn't win the doubles.
Doubles Results
San Jose State and Stanford
each placed two teams in the
semis of the doubles, and while
Card freshmen Bill Maze and
Peiry Wright downed one Spartan
team, top-seeded Nick Saviano
and Mark Mitchell lost to the
other. Hank Pfister and Bob
Hansen of San Jose State then
beat Maze-Wright by a 7-5, 7-6
score.
San Jose State came within five
points of Stanford's final score

and elicited acclaim from Gould.
Gould described the Spartans as
"possibly one of the five best
teams in the nation." Stanford
plays San Jose State twice
this year in dual matches.
Today's match against Miami
won't give Gould a chance to
experiment with any radical
lineup changes.
Admission is free to the 2:30
p.m. match at the varsity

courts.

Chip Fisher team didn't win the
title. It was the first time in even
longer that a team from Stanford
didn't win the doubles.
Doubles Results
San Jose State and Stanford
each placed two teams in the
semis of the doubles, and while
Card freshmen Bill Maze and
Peiry Wright downed one Spartan
team, top-seeded Nick Saviano
and Mark Mitchell lost to the
other. Hank Pfister and Bob
Hansen of San Jose State then
beat Maze-Wright by a 7-5, 7-6
score.
San Jose State came within five
points of Stanford's final score

and elicited acclaim from Gould.
Gould described the Spartans as
"possibly one of the five best
teams in the nation." Stanford
plays San Jose State twice
this year in dual matches.
Today's match against Miami
won't give Gould a chance to
experiment with any radical
lineup changes.
Admission is free to the 2:30

After winning the Northern
California Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships Saturday in San
Jose and winning the National
Team Indoor Championships the
week before in Madison, Wis.,
what is the Stanford tennis team
going to do for an encore?
«"Rest," says coach Dick
Gould.
But the team won't get a
chance to rest until after this
afternoon's match against Miami,
which finished fourth in last
year's NCAA tournament.
"We've been playing for two
straight weeks now," says Gould.
"That's a lot of tennis, and we're
tired. I can't wait until after
[Miami]."
The team doesn't play in
another tournament for three
weeks and can nowget settled into
a schedule of dual match
competition. The NorCal was an
NCAA-style tournament, where
every individual match win
counted in the team's standings.
Singles The Key
Stanford outdistanced the
other five schools in the tourney
with some sharp singles playing
that placed three Card netters into
the four semifinal spots.
NCAA champ John Whitlinger
took his second NorCal singles
title in a row by beating Pat
DuPre in the semis and Joe
Meyers of San Jose State in the
finals. Meyers had topped Mark
Mitchell in the other semifinal
round.
In the doubles bracket, it was
