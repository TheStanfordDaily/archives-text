# Stanford Edges 'Super-Dirty' Oregon
## 
### 
By VLAE KERSHNER
Ordinarily, you'd be hard
pressed to explain why Rich
Kelley got himself kicked out of a
basketball game for kicking an
opponent who was on the ground,
and why Stanford, sans' Kelley,
played superb basketball in
beating Oregon 71-70 Saturday
night at Maples.
Ordinarily when you play
Oregon, it isn't ordinary.
Stanford's players hate Oregon.
Not the garden-variety hate
associated with superb teams like
UCLA, but unbridled fury
directed at a super-dirty team that
does anything to win.
Whenever Oregon plays
Stanford, it uses every tactic
possible to get Kelley out of the
game. With five minutes gone in
the game Saturday, Webfoot
guard Mike Drummond undercut
Kelley — or "leg-whipped" him in
Kelley's words. Kelley got mad
and kicked Drummond in the leg
while the latter was lying on the
floor.
Not A Vicious Kick
The kick wasn't particularly
vicious, but referee Lou Soriano
saw it and threw Kelley out of the
game. Oregon forward Stu
Jackson started leaping up and
down and shouting, "We did it.
We got Kelley out."
According to Stanford assistant
coach Bub Bowling, kicking a man
on the floor is an automatic
ejection. Still, the Maples crowd
went crazy, throwing projectiles
at Soriano, whose major fault in
the whole affair was that he didn't
see Oregon repeatedly provoke
Kelley.
When play was resumed,
Oregon began running away from
Stanford, taking a 30-22 lead. But
then the Ducks tried a very stupid
strategy (stalling) and Howie Dallmar
had time to regroup his forces and
get Stanford back into the game.
Refs Lost Control
Meanwhile, Soriano and
Booker Turner lost control of the
game, as players on both teams
exchanged shots behind their

backs. "It's lousy basketball,"
Dallmar said after the game. "I
will not apologize for the actions
of our team or of Rich Kelley."
The inference was clear. When
playing Oregon, anything goes.
With Kelley out of the game,
Tim Patterson and Dale Peters had
to play the post. Patterson broke
out of a long slump, dominating
offensively (scoring 18 points)
and playing really aggressive
defense. Peters, who spelled
Patterson for six minutes, played
better than anyone thought he
could — considerably better than
Patterson had played up until this
game — and got a standing ovation
when he returned to the bench.
Throughout the second half,
the two teams exchanged the lead.
Stanford went ahead 69-65 with
two minutes to go, but two Ron
Lee jumpers tied it up.
Jackson Fouled
At that score with 21 seconds
left to play, Jackson was fouled.
Dallmar called three time-outs in a
row in an effort to unnerve
Jackson. The strategy
semi-worked, as Stu missed one of
two.
Stanford, now trailing by one,
quickly got the ball downcourt
and into Ed Schweitzer under the
bucket, who scored the winning
layup with five seconds to play.
Kelley called the game "the
most satisfying win I have ever
been associated with." That's how
much he hates Oregon. That's
how much everyone hates Oregon,
which had beaten Stanford five
straight times, the last three by
one point.
Duck coach Dick Harter
restrained his anger after the
game, but took his team out of
Maples still in uniform.

Cardinal Notes: A group of
Theta Delts kidnaped Oregon's
mascot and stole the Duck's head,
as the crowd went crazy. After
the game, the head was returned
to police.

two minutes to go, but two Ron
Lee jumpers tied it up.
Jackson Fouled
At that score with 21 seconds

Dallmar called three time-outs in a
row in an effort to unnerve
Jackson. The strategy
semi-worked, as Stu missed one of
two.
Stanford, now trailing by one,
quickly got the ball downcourt
and into Ed Schweitzer under the
bucket, who scored the winning
layup with five seconds to play.
Kelley called the game "the
most satisfying win I have ever
been associated with." That's how
much he hates Oregon. That's
how much everyone hates Oregon,
which had beaten Stanford five
straight times, the last three by
one point.
Duck coach Dick Harter

Ordinarily, you'd be hard
pressed to explain why Rich
Kelley got himself kicked out of a
basketball game for kicking an
opponent who was on the ground,
and why Stanford, sans' Kelley,
played superb basketball in
beating Oregon 71-70 Saturday
night at Maples.
Ordinarily when you play
Oregon, it isn't ordinary.
Stanford's players hate Oregon.
Not the garden-variety hate
associated with superb teams like
UCLA, but unbridled fury
directed at a super-dirty team that
does anything to win.
Whenever Oregon plays
Stanford, it uses every tactic
possible to get Kelley out of the
game. With five minutes gone in
the game Saturday, Webfoot
guard Mike Drummond undercut
Kelley — or "leg-whipped" him in
Kelley's words. Kelley got mad
and kicked Drummond in the leg
while the latter was lying on the
floor.
Not A Vicious Kick
The kick wasn't particularly
vicious, but referee Lou Soriano
saw it and threw Kelley out of the
game. Oregon forward Stu
Jackson started leaping up and
down and shouting, "We did it.
We got Kelley out."
According to Stanford assistant
coach Bub Bowling, kicking a man
on the floor is an automatic
ejection. Still, the Maples crowd
went crazy, throwing projectiles
at Soriano, whose major fault in
the whole affair was that he didn't
see Oregon repeatedly provoke
Kelley.
When play was resumed,
Oregon began running away from
Stanford, taking a 30-22 lead. But
then the Ducks tried a very stupid
strategy (stalling) and Howie Dallmar
had time to regroup his forces and
get Stanford back into the game.
Refs Lost Control
Meanwhile, Soriano and
Booker Turner lost control of the
game, as players on both teams
exchanged shots behind their

backs. "It's lousy basketball,"
Dallmar said after the game. "I
will not apologize for the actions
of our team or of Rich Kelley."
The inference was clear. When
playing Oregon, anything goes.
With Kelley out of the game,
Tim Patterson and Dale Peters had
to play the post. Patterson broke
out of a long slump, dominating
offensively (scoring 18 points)
and playing really aggressive
defense. Peters, who spelled
Patterson for six minutes, played
better than anyone thought he
could — considerably better than
Patterson had played up until this
game — and got a standing ovation
when he returned to the bench.
Throughout the second half,
the two teams exchanged the lead.
Stanford went ahead 69-65 with
two minutes to go, but two Ron
Lee jumpers tied it up.

Ordinarily, you'd be hard
pressed to explain why Rich
Kelley got himself kicked out of a
basketball game for kicking an
opponent who was on the ground,
and why Stanford, sans' Kelley,
played superb basketball in
beating Oregon 71-70 Saturday
night at Maples.
Ordinarily when you play
Oregon, it isn't ordinary.
Stanford's players hate Oregon.
Not the garden-variety hate
associated with superb teams like
UCLA, but unbridled fury
directed at a super-dirty team that
does anything to win.
Whenever Oregon plays
Stanford, it uses every tactic
possible to get Kelley out of the
game. With five minutes gone in
the game Saturday, Webfoot
guard Mike Drummond undercut
Kelley — or "leg-whipped" him in
Kelley's words. Kelley got mad
and kicked Drummond in the leg
while the latter was lying on the
floor.
Not A Vicious Kick
The kick wasn't particularly
vicious, but referee Lou Soriano
saw it and threw Kelley out of the
game. Oregon forward Stu
Jackson started leaping up and
down and shouting, "We did it.
We got Kelley out."
According to Stanford assistant
coach Bub Bowling, kicking a man
on the floor is an automatic
ejection. Still, the Maples crowd
went crazy, throwing projectiles
at Soriano, whose major fault in
the whole affair was that he didn't
see Oregon repeatedly provoke
Kelley.
When play was resumed,
Oregon began running away from
Stanford, taking a 30-22 lead. But
then the Ducks tried a very stupid
strategy (stalling) and Howie Dallmar
had time to regroup his forces and
get Stanford back into the game.
Refs Lost Control
Meanwhile, Soriano and
Booker Turner lost control of the
game, as players on both teams
exchanged shots behind their

backs. "It's lousy basketball,"
Dallmar said after the game. "I
will not apologize for the actions
of our team or of Rich Kelley."
The inference was clear. When
playing Oregon, anything goes.
With Kelley out of the game,
Tim Patterson and Dale Peters had
to play the post. Patterson broke
out of a long slump, dominating
offensively (scoring 18 points)
and playing really aggressive
defense. Peters, who spelled
Patterson for six minutes, played
better than anyone thought he
could — considerably better than
Patterson had played up until this
game — and got a standing ovation
when he returned to the bench.
Throughout the second half,
the two teams exchanged the lead.
Stanford went ahead 69-65 with
two minutes to go, but two Ron
Lee jumpers tied it up.
Jackson Fouled
At that score with 21 seconds
left to play, Jackson was fouled.
Dallmar called three time-outs in a
row in an effort to unnerve
Jackson. The strategy
semi-worked, as Stu missed one of
two.
Stanford, now trailing by one,
quickly got the ball downcourt
and into Ed Schweitzer under the
bucket, who scored the winning
layup with five seconds to play.
Kelley called the game "the
most satisfying win I have ever
been associated with." That's how
much he hates Oregon. That's
how much everyone hates Oregon,
which had beaten Stanford five
straight times, the last three by
one point.
Duck coach Dick Harter
restrained his anger after the
game, but took his team out of
Maples still in uniform.
* * *
Cardinal Notes: A group of
Theta Delts kidnaped Oregon's
mascot and stole the Duck's head,
as the crowd went crazy. After
the game, the head was returned
to police.
