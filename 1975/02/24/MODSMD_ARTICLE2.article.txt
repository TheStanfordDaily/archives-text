"I'm sorry, you didn't make it,"
said the voice on the other end of the
telephone.
"Oh, I knew I wouldn't," was the
usual reply.
It was 7 a.m. Friday, and five of the
10 Dolly semifinalists were finding
out they wouldn't be Dollies next
year.
But for five others, there were no 7
a.m. phone calls. That is Dolly
tradition.
For Linda Bridgford, Toni Hunter,
Bonnie McColl, Kathy Cannell and
Terry Elms, a silent telephone meant
that they had been selected as the
1975-76 Stanford Dollies.
Better known as numbers 8, 29, 27,
9 and 18 to the 30 judges who judged
the tryouts, the five new Dollies were
among 37 women who made their way to
Maples Pavilion last Thursday. For
over four-and-a-half hours the Dolly
hopefuls danced and kicked and
pom-ponned to the music before the
attentive judges and a crowd of about
200.
Judges included Dean of

Admissions Fred Hargadon, ASSU
Vice President Ann Carter, the current
Dollies and members of the football
team, basketball team, Daily, KZSU,
and the Dolly families with whom the
women stay during the summer. They
were asked to judge the women on
appearance, personality and poise,
originality and execution. It wasn't
easy.
The final decision wasn't reached
until 3 a.m. after hours of Band
interview.} with the 10 semi-finclists.
The new Dollies, although cognizant
of their selection, weren't actually
notified until dinner.
"We came around and got them at
the dinner tables," said present Dolly
Terry Bowman. "Everybody clapped
and cheered and the girls would blush,
but inside they were filled with glee."
The new Dollies, accompanied by
this year's group, celebrated at Edy's
ice cream shop with the traditional ice
cream sundaes and banana splits.
Then they were off to the
basketball game against Oregon State
to watch the present Dolly crew in
action.
