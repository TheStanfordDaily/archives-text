Golf
Senior Conrad Nilmeier
finished second this weekend as a
field of 320 was trimmed to 64
qualifiers in the San Francisco
City golf championships.
Nilmeier, who shot a
two-under-par 66 Saturday at
Lincoln Park, fired a four-over-par
76 yesterday at Harding Park. His
142 total was one shot behind
medalist Doug Boston.
Two other Stanford golfers
also qualified for the match-play
portion of the tournament. Dave
Baskins shot 73-74—147, and Aly
Trompas shot 76-74—150. Match
play begins next weekend at
Harding Park and continues on
successive weekends until the
semifinals and finals March 15
and 16.

Baseball
The Stanford baseball team
split a doubleheader with Fresno
State Saturday at Sunken
Diamond. The Cardinals won the
first game 2-1 in extra innings, but

couldn't muster anything close to
an offense in the nightcap, losing
4-0.
Freshman first baseman Tom
Guardino blasted a 340-foot shot
over the left field fence in the
bottom of the eighth to end the
first game.
The second game was long and
slow and belonged to Fresno
State. John Yandle started for the
Cards but had trouble finding the
plate as he walked seven, and gave
up two runs in the third. Ed
Matta, who came on to pitch in
the seventh with bases loaded,
also had control problems, and
Fresno scored two more.
Last Thursday Stanford beat
Stanislaus State 10-4.

Rugby
The Stanford rugby team
finally found a way to snap its
five game losing streak —
overtime. With the score
deadlocked at six-all as time ran
out on the Los Angeles Coliseum
clock, captain Lawrie Lieberman

did some fast talking to get USC
to agree to a 15 minute overtime
period (under rugby regulations
there is no overtime period).
The Trojans should have
accepted the tie though, for the
Card scrum completely shut down
the Trojan backfield and Mike
Yancey seized a USC fumble early
in the period and rambled
40-yards for the winning try, to
give the ruggers a 12-6 win.

Swimming
The Stanford swimmers closed
out their regular dual-meet season
Saturday with a 70-43 shellacking
of cross-bay rival Cal.
"The meet went pretty well,"
said Coach Jim Gaughran, "we got
a lot of good times and some
more swimmers qualified for the
Pac-B's."
Two swimmers who qualified
were freshmen John Powell and
Marty Davis in the 50 yard
freestyle.
Sophomore Eric Rasmussen
also had a great day, turning in

the best times of his life in both
the 100 back and 200 IM.
A few other swimmers also
achieved lifetime bests, including
junior Jeff Leicher in the 200
free; Stu Seiff and Dave Fryfield
in the 100 fly; and Bruce Craig
and Stu Corliss in the 100 Breast.

JV Basketball
It was like a one-on-one game
between Wilt Chamberlain and
Willie Shoemaker.
Stanford JVs 111, UC Medical
School 66.
Stanford JVs 88, College of
Notre Dame 46.
Against Notre Dame on Friday,
the Cards led 82-36 with five
minutes to go. Against the Cal
Med School on Saturday,
Stanford led 70-32 at halftime.
Stanford displayed soLd overall
basketball both nights. Tomorrow
the Cards play San Jose State —
the only team to defeat them in
the last five weeks — at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.

The Stanford women's swim -
team placed second yesterday in
the Stanford Invitational swim -

Arizona State University.
