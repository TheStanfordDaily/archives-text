Tax Cut Bill Awaits House Aetion
WASHINGTON - A $21.28 billion tax cut bill
to combat recession awaits action in the House this
week while Democrats argue over whether to use it
to kill the depletion allowance worth $2.5 billion a
year to oilmen.
Energy tax hearings open March 3, but some
anti-oil forces are demanding the 22 percent
petroleum depletion allowance be killed
immediately as part of the urgent tax cut bill
congressional Democrats want to rush to President
Ford to help pull the nation out of economic
quicksand.
In the Senate, liberals plan a new effort, possibly
tomorrow, to make it easier to cut off filibusters.
At present, the Senate is at an impasse, with the
filibuster fight blocking action on a House-passed
bill to keep the Penn Central and other Northeast
railroads in operation.
Arabs Confer On Economic Boycott
CAIRO — Calling the economic boycott of Israel
one of the "most strategic weapons" in the Arab
arsenal, commissioner General Mohammed Mahgoub
opened a 10-day conference of the Boycott of Israel
organization yesterday to review requests from 60
firms to be removed from the blacklist.
The blacklist includes Ford Motor Co., Revlon
cosmetics and Coca Cola.
In addition to companies, the Arab boycott list
includes movie actors such as Paul Newman and
Elizabeth Taylor and singers Frank Sinatra and
Harry Belafonte — all taboo because of the help
they have given Israeli causes such as bond drives in
the United States.
AFL-CIO: Regulate Oil Firms
MIAMI BEACH — The AFL-CIO proposed
yesterday new antitrust legislation to break up the
giant oil companies and place them under strict
government regulation.
In a statement approved by its executive council
the AFL-CIO blamed multinational oil companies
for the energy crisis and recommended "a

comprehensive energy policy" which would reduce
imports, cut consumption and increase domestic
energy supplies.
Among measures proposed by the council was
legislation to:
—prohibit a single company from owning
competing sources of energy; a number of major
coal, natural gas and uranium producers are owned
by the major oil companies, a practice which the
AFL-CIO said has hampered the development of
alternative energy sources;
—treat the oil companies as public utilities
subject to stringent federal regulation.
—remove the importation of oil from private
hands and place it under government authority.
Cambodian Crisis Could Worsen
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia - The U.S. financed
airlift into isolated Phnom Penh is meeting daily

battlefield supply requirements but the situation
quickly could become critical if fighting escalates,
diplomatic sources say.
They add that if the Mekong River remains
closed to river convoys much longer, an expensive
airlift of rice and fuel may be needed to keep
the Cbmbocian capital's population alive.
Communist-led insurgents, only six weeks into
their dry season offensive, have consolidated their
grip on all the nation's roads, whittled down
government troops trying to reopen the mined
Mekong and kept the capital's airport under daily
rocket fire.
Today's Weather
Fair today and tomorrow. Little temperature
change. Low both nights in the upper 30s and 40s.
High today and Tuesday in the 60s. Light winds.

Arabs Confer On Economic Boycott
CAIRO — Calling the economic boycott of Israel
one of the "most strategic weapons" in the Arab
arsenal, commissioner General Mohammed Mahgoub
opened a 10-day conference of the Boycott of Israel
organization yesterday to review requests from 60
firms to be removed from the blacklist.
The blacklist includes Ford Motor Co., Revlon
cosmetics and Coca Cola.
In addition to companies, the Arab boycott list
includes movie actors such as Paul Newman and
Elizabeth Taylor and singers Frank Sinatra and
Harry Belafonte — all taboo because of the help
they have given Israeli causes such as bond drives in
the United States.
AFL-CIO: Regulate Oil Firms
MIAMI BEACH — The AFL-CIO proposed
yesterday new antitrust legislation to break up the
giant oil companies and place them under strict
government regulation.
In a statement approved by its executive council
the AFL-CIO blamed multinational oil companies
for the energy crisis and recommended "a

comprehensive energy policy" which would reduce
imports, cut consumption and increase domestic
energy supplies.
Among measures proposed by the council was
legislation to:
—prohibit a single company from owning
competing sources of energy; a number of major
coal, natural gas and uranium producers are owned
by the major oil companies, a practice which the
AFL-CIO said has hampered the development of
alternative energy sources;
—treat the oil companies as public utilities
subject to stringent federal regulation.
—remove the importation of oil from private
hands and place it under government authority.
Cambodian Crisis Could Worsen
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia - The U.S. financed
airlift into isolated Phnom Penh is meeting daily

battlefield supply requirements but the situation
quickly could become critical if fighting escalates,
diplomatic sources say.
They add that if the Mekong River remains
closed to river convoys much longer, an expensive
airlift of rice and fuel may be needed to keep
the Cbmbocian capital's population alive.
Communist-led insurgents, only six weeks into
their dry season offensive, have consolidated their
grip on all the nation's roads, whittled down
government troops trying to reopen the mined
Mekong and kept the capital's airport under daily
rocket fire.
Today's Weather
Fair today and tomorrow. Little temperature
change. Low both nights in the upper 30s and 40s.
High today and Tuesday in the 60s. Light winds.
Tax Cut Bill Awaits House Aetion
WASHINGTON - A $21.28 billion tax cut bill
to combat recession awaits action in the House this
week while Democrats argue over whether to use it
to kill the depletion allowance worth $2.5 billion a
year to oilmen.
Energy tax hearings open March 3, but some
anti-oil forces are demanding the 22 percent
petroleum depletion allowance be killed
immediately as part of the urgent tax cut bill
congressional Democrats want to rush to President
Ford to help pull the nation out of economic
quicksand.
In the Senate, liberals plan a new effort, possibly
tomorrow, to make it easier to cut off filibusters.
At present, the Senate is at an impasse, with the
filibuster fight blocking action on a House-passed
bill to keep the Penn Central and other Northeast
railroads in operation.
