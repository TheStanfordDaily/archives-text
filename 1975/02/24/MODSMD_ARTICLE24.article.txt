# World Economy Facts Provided By Computers

### JAN PEPPER 
A computer which allows students
to have immediate access to facts
about the population and economy of
some 120 countries has been in use
since November by the Stanford World
Analysis Committee (SWAC).
The computer "allows students to
have data on 30 variables in over 120
countries, which allows them to get a
bird's eye view of major trends in
different countries," said Dr. Kenneth
Cooper, former director of the Bechtel
International Center and a founder of
SWAC. "The computer shortcuts
weeks of data-collecting, presenting
graphs and curves on a visual television
screen."
The computer, PLATO, consists of
four terminals connected by telephone
with the main computer at the
University of Illinois' Urbana campus.
Several seminars have already been
organized around PLATO. One
seminar, "Prospect for Survival,"
coordinated by Cooper, Electrical
Engineering Prof. Malcolm McWhorter,
and Political Science Prof. Robert
North, looks at key trends in the
world today that will affect long-term
survival.
"Two problems present
themselves," continued Cooper. "The
developed countries are over-using the
earth and the developing countries
want to go through the same economic
development we had. The trends are
obvious. Unless they are checked,
more and more people are going to be
miserable, and eventually a disaster
will occur."
"The seminar is intended primarily
for foreign students," said McWhorter.
These students, once they return to

their native countries, often reach
positions of authority and can
therefore influence the course their
country is taking, he continued.
Education and Anthropology Prof.
Robert Textor, who coordinates two
seminars with students from Third
World areas, said, "The student can, in
effect, talk to the computer, and ask
questions, since the computer can
store data in its memory. He can
compare two countries at once, and
see how two different systems will
differ in their growth patterns."
"Foreign students can try things
that may not occur to us. It's very
important that the student can put in
what he wants," continued Textor.
The system is still in the
experimental stages, and when more
time and staff are available, "we will
want to elaborate much more on
where the information came from. We
also need to develop some new
variables. Hopefully, we can have our
own hardware and software at
Stanford where we can develop more
complex and satisfactory algorithms,"
said Textor.
"There is increasing awareness that
everyone is in the same boat. With the
organization of SWAC, we can take an
interdisciplinary approach to look at
global problems. By putting the
knowledge and talent of separate
departments together, we can relate
academic knowledge to finding
solutions for these problems," said
Cooper.
The terminals are located in
Ventura Hall and the International
Center, and may be used by interested
people when classes are not using
them, said McWhorter.
