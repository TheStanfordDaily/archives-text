# French Theme House Ici In Fall
## 
### RANDY TURK 
The University has said "oui" to
the idea of an on-campus French
theme house.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton said Friday that the French
house, to begin next fall, is "99
percent on the way." The theme house
is one of two residential programs
confirmed by the Housing
Configuration Advisory Panel.
Expressing enthusiasm for the new
program, Horton asserted "We have
every intention of going ahead with it,
and will announce all details when we
know which house will be used,"
probably before dead week of this
quarter.
Sponsored by a group of faculty
and students from both the French
and Overseas Studies Departments, the
French theme house is designed to
accommodate a broad range of
Francophiles, from those whose
interests are purely linguistic to others
who may be more concerned with
French civilization or culture.
As a result, residency requirements
will entail either passing a language
proficiency test or agreeing to enroll in
at least one French course some time
during the year. The course may be in
either language or a related field such
as French history, art or literature.
Seminar Participation
In addition, each student will be
expected to participate in at least one
of the seminars to be offered on a
variety of topics such as French art,
medicine, music, gastronomy,
literature, history, drama and cinema.
Students with particular interest in
other areas of French study will be
urged to organize their own seminars.
"We want to provide students with
a French environment which will
entice, rather than force, them to
speak French and pursue French
studies," stressed French Dept.
Chairman Alphonse Juilland.
Part of that enticement will be a
daily fare of French cuisine prepared
by the house's own chef — "an

important factor in creating a total
French melieu," noted Acting Asst. French
Prof, of Medieval Literature David
Brostoff, who will be the house's
resident adviser.
'Animateur'
Brostoff, whose main concern is
that the house be "a good place to
live," was chosen for the spot of
animateur because of his experience
with student counseling and similar
kinds of programs, notably at an
American cultural center in Paris and a
residential college at Berkeley where
he recently lived and taught history
and literature.
Although Assoc. French Prof. Ralph
Hester points out that the idea of a
French theme house here is not new,
he explains that "for many years the
lack of student interest and a suitable
animateur as well as questions
concerning the role of the French
Department in Stanford's residential
program" precluded the actualization
of the idea.
Juilland remarks that the declining
enrollment in Overseas Studies centers
has raised the need for "a local
substitute for those students not able
or interested in going to France,"and,
for those students who have been
abroad a place to continue their
language practice and study of France
when they return.
The French theme house will
provide everything from a French
decor, including a library with French
newspapers ana bestsellers, to French
movies, radio programs and music.
Visiting writers and lecturers will be
able to stay in the house's guest room,
offering students casual and lengthy
contact with French dignitaries.
Foreign Students Welcome
French students, the largest
contingent of Stanford's foreign
students, will be welcome and
encouraged to participate in the
house's seminars and activities, as will
all other Francophiles on campus.
Anticipating the number of
applicants to exceed the proposed

30-50 available spaces, Horton has said
that the selection process will
probably "fit neatly into the draw
system," with those students who
meet the program's requirements then
being chosen on a "first come first
serve basis." He noted that this has not
been discussed in detail yet.
Freshmen will not be eligible for
the program.
"We certainly expect to learn a lot
this year," acknowledged Juilland. He
has requested that anyone with
suggestions come to discuss them with
him or Brostoff, or submit them in
writing to the French Department
office.

been discussed in detail yet.
Freshmen will not be eligible for
the program.
"We certainly expect to learn a lot
this year," acknowledged Juilland. He
has requested that anyone with
suggestions come to discuss them with
him or Brostoff, or submit them in
writing to the French Department
office.
The University has said "oui" to
the idea of an on-campus French
theme house.
Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton said Friday that the French
house, to begin next fall, is "99
percent on the way." The theme house
is one of two residential programs
confirmed by the Housing
Configuration Advisory Panel.
Expressing enthusiasm for the new
program, Horton asserted "We have
every intention of going ahead with it,
and will announce all details when we
know which house will be used,"
probably before dead week of this
quarter.
Sponsored by a group of faculty
and students from both the French
and Overseas Studies Departments, the
French theme house is designed to
accommodate a broad range of
Francophiles, from those whose
interests are purely linguistic to others
who may be more concerned with
French civilization or culture.
As a result, residency requirements
will entail either passing a language
proficiency test or agreeing to enroll in
at least one French course some time
during the year. The course may be in
either language or a related field such
as French history, art or literature.
Seminar Participation
In addition, each student will be
expected to participate in at least one
of the seminars to be offered on a
variety of topics such as French art,
medicine, music, gastronomy,
literature, history, drama and cinema.
Students with particular interest in
other areas of French study will be
urged to organize their own seminars.
"We want to provide students with
a French environment which will
entice, rather than force, them to
speak French and pursue French
studies," stressed French Dept.
Chairman Alphonse Juilland.
Part of that enticement will be a
daily fare of French cuisine prepared
by the house's own chef — "an

important factor in creating a total
French melieu," noted Acting Asst. French
Prof, of Medieval Literature David
Brostoff, who will be the house's
resident adviser.
'Animateur'
Brostoff, whose main concern is
that the house be "a good place to
live," was chosen for the spot of
animateur because of his experience
with student counseling and similar
kinds of programs, notably at an
American cultural center in Paris and a
residential college at Berkeley where
he recently lived and taught history
and literature.
Although Assoc. French Prof. Ralph
Hester points out that the idea of a
French theme house here is not new,
he explains that "for many years the
lack of student interest and a suitable
animateur as well as questions
concerning the role of the French
Department in Stanford's residential
program" precluded the actualization
of the idea.
Juilland remarks that the declining
enrollment in Overseas Studies centers
has raised the need for "a local
substitute for those students not able
or interested in going to France,"and,
for those students who have been
abroad a place to continue their
language practice and study of France
when they return.
The French theme house will
provide everything from a French
decor, including a library with French
newspapers ana bestsellers, to French
movies, radio programs and music.
Visiting writers and lecturers will be
able to stay in the house's guest room,
offering students casual and lengthy
contact with French dignitaries.
Foreign Students Welcome
French students, the largest
contingent of Stanford's foreign
students, will be welcome and
encouraged to participate in the
house's seminars and activities, as will
all other Francophiles on campus.
Anticipating the number of
applicants to exceed the proposed

30-50 available spaces, Horton has said
that the selection process will
probably "fit neatly into the draw
system," with those students who
meet the program's requirements then
being chosen on a "first come first
serve basis." He noted that this has not
been discussed in detail yet.
Freshmen will not be eligible for
the program.
