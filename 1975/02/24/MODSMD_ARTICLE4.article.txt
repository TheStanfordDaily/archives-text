# Carmichael: 'Africans, Not Afro- Americans'

''We're Africans, not
Afro-Americans," black activist
Stokely Carmichael told an audience
of more than 300 people in Bishop
Auditorium yesterday.
Sharply criticizing the "backwards"
style in which history was written and
the cultural biases inherent in the way
history is taught in American schools,
Carmichael said that blacks must trace
their history back to their origins in
Africa if they are to get the proper
perspective on their identity.
"It's bad for the black student if he
doesn't go back to Africa since
otherwise his history stops at 1619. If
I stop at 1619, I couldn't compete
with the whites in this university," he
said.
"We have to take our history back
from people who are culturally trying
to subjugate us. Our history has its
own integrity, its own foundations,"
Carmichael said.
History A Weapon
"History is a weapon. In the hands
of reactionaries, history can mobilize
noble people to fight for the forces of
injustice," he said.
Carmichael said use of the
term Afro-American to identify blacks
was '"a calculated trick by reactionary
forces in the country to confuse us as
to who we really are. We're Africans.
America is not our home. If a cat has
kittens in the oven, you don't call the
kittens biscuits," he said.
"Unless I have my history behind
me, I can't struggle," he said,
emphasizing the importance of firmly
establishing a true identity and
history.
Scientific Approach
Carmichael stressed that blacks
must take a scientific approach toward
the world-wide problems confronting
them.
The world-wide objective of all
"Africans" must be the "total
liberation and unification of Africa
under scientific socialism."

"When this objective is achieved,
the blacks will have solved their
problems and have aided the worid
socialist movement," he said.
Carmichael stressed the importance
of the "scientific method" in the
revolution to liberate blacks
throughout the world. "We come to
the conclusion and understanding that
if we are to talk about liberating our
people or any people we must use a
scientific method. That method we
must strip of all mysticism and
sentimentality," he said.
Problems
World-wide problems blacks face
include economic exploitation, racism,
miseducation, lack of political power,
lack of unity, psychological
exploitation and deceptive historical
accounts of blacks, Carmichael said.
"Only the masses make history. Dr.
[Martin Luther] King didn't make
history, Malcolm [X] didn't make
history. The best a King can do is to
represent the needs, aspirations and
interests of the people at the proper
time," Carmifchael said.
"We came from Africa, we came
against our will, our continent was
divided, to accumulate anything our
people have had to shed blood. Every
damned thing we have in this country
we have had to struggle for," he said
to the crowd.
Carmichael said blacks appeared in
history to owe all of their advances to
a few whites such as Franklin
Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson.
"The way history is written, if it
were not for them, I'd be in trouble,"
Carmichael said.
"If we don't want to go back home,
the reason is because we accept the
European explanation that we are
thankful for our liberation by whites.
But this is backwards," he said.
The masses were actually
responsible for their own liberation, he
said.
