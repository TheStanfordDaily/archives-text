# Despite Financial Aid Changes
## Lyman Expects No Minority Drop 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The proposed reduction of special financial aid to
minority students probably wouldn't cause minority
enrollment to decline, according to President Richard
Lyman.
Speaking Friday on KZSU's Campus Conference, Lyman
asserted that the new minority aid program "isn't a big
change" from the current program.
The new plan is still "a considerably more generous
program" than those offered by other comparable
universities, he noted.
Lyman warned, however, that if members of the
minority community exaggerate the decision's effect, fewer
minority students might apply to Stanford.
"The decision is not a breach of commitment, but if
people say enough times that it is a breach of commitment,
then it will become one," Lyman said. "I'm not asking
minorities to shut up and go along with the plan, but I am
asking them not to exaggerate its effects."
Approves Of Recommendation
Lyman expressed approval of the Faculty Senate's
recent recommendation to extend special benefits to
minorities from very low income families.
He said he disagreed with charges that the new aid
package was developed too hastily, adding that he has no
plans for delaying its implementation.
"Policy on financial aids is in the hands of the Faculty
Senate," Lyman said. "I would be very reluctant to
interfere with its decision."

He asserted that the University is moving in the right
direction by trying to base financial aid more on economic
need and less on ethnic background.
'Uneasy'
Although Lyman conceded that special financial aid
incentives were necessary at one time to encourage
minority enrollment, he said he has always been "uneasy
about straight preferences on the basis of ethnicity."
Responding to question's about Thursday's "Funeral for
Undergraduate Education," he said that while Stanford still
has strong undergraduate programs, some are bound to be
cut in a time of financial stress.
"When you try to close a $10 million budgetary gap over
a few years, you're going to upset some people," Lyman
said.
While he said he doesn't expect to see "a dramatic
contraction in undergraduate programs," he predicted that
"there will be some other controversial decisions."
'Watchdog' Office
He claimed that Stanford created an office of
undergraduate studies — an office not found at most other
schools — to act as a watchdog in the interests of
undergraduate education.
"One has to be particularly careful with undergraduate
education," Lyman said. "Some powerful forces are
directed toward graduate education."
Lyman also revealed Friday that he will spend several
weeks this spring in Israel and Lebanon, where he will
deliver lectures and meet with educators.

universities, he noted.
Lyman warned, however, that if members of the
minority community exaggerate the decision's effect, fewer
minority students might apply to Stanford.
"The decision is not a breach of commitment, but if
people say enough times that it is a breach of commitment,
then it will become one," Lyman said. "I'm not asking
minorities to shut up and go along with the plan, but I am
asking them not to exaggerate its effects."
Approves Of Recommendation
Lyman expressed approval of the Faculty Senate's
recent recommendation to extend special benefits to
minorities from very low income families.
He said he disagreed with charges that the new aid
package was developed too hastily, adding that he has no
plans for delaying its implementation.
"Policy on financial aids is in the hands of the Faculty
Senate," Lyman said. "I would be very reluctant to
interfere with its decision."

He asserted that the University is moving in the right
direction by trying to base financial aid more on economic
need and less on ethnic background.
'Uneasy'
Although Lyman conceded that special financial aid
incentives were necessary at one time to encourage
minority enrollment, he said he has always been "uneasy
about straight preferences on the basis of ethnicity."
Responding to question's about Thursday's "Funeral for
Undergraduate Education," he said that while Stanford still
has strong undergraduate programs, some are bound to be
cut in a time of financial stress.
"When you try to close a $10 million budgetary gap over
a few years, you're going to upset some people," Lyman
said.
While he said he doesn't expect to see "a dramatic
contraction in undergraduate programs," he predicted that
"there will be some other controversial decisions."
'Watchdog' Office
He claimed that Stanford created an office of
undergraduate studies — an office not found at most other
schools — to act as a watchdog in the interests of
undergraduate education.
"One has to be particularly careful with undergraduate
education," Lyman said. "Some powerful forces are
directed toward graduate education."
Lyman also revealed Friday that he will spend several
weeks this spring in Israel and Lebanon, where he will
deliver lectures and meet with educators.
