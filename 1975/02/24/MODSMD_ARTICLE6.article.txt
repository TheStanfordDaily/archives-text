HELLO DOLLIESâ€”Backed by the LSJUMB, next year's Dollies made their debut at Friday's basketball game against Oregon State. From left, they are Terry
Elms, Toni Hunter, Kathy Cannell, Linda Bridgford and Bonnie McColl. Thirty-seven women tried out, going through over four hours of dancing and pom-pon
waving as the judges made their selections. TTiis year's Dollies notified the gleeful winners as they were eating dinner, and then took them out for ice cream at
Edy's.
