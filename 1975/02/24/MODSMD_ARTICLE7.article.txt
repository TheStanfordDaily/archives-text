## Grading Vote 
### 
On Wednesday, the ASSU will sponsor a referendum on
the five recommendations of the Ad Hoc Panel on the
Grading System. The Daily urges students to vote against all
recommendations except the third one.
Recommendations 1 and 2 DISAPPROVE
These recommendations, which will be voted on together,
urge the reinstitution of the NC (no credit) grade to indicate
either unauthorized withdrawal from a course or
unsatisfactory performance in a course. A drop deadline
would be reinstituted, and students withdrawing after that
deadline would receive an NC grade.
We do not believe that reinstituting the NC grade is wise.
A student's transcript should be, in our opinion, a measure
of what that student has achieved, and grades should not be
used for punitive purposes.
In addition, the institution of the NC will discourage
students from taking difficult courses outside their
specialized field.
Recommendation 3 APPROVE
This plan asks the registrar to collect and make public grade
distributions in the various schools of the University, and
further requests department chairmen to "receive reports of
grade distributions in individual courses along with an
indication of any large discrepancies from relevant
University averages."
This plan is an effective way of monitoring grade
inflation and making professors more responsible in giving
grades.
Recommendation 4 DISAPPROVE
This plan restricts giving of the incomplete "to cases
where the student has completed a substantial portion of the
course work at passing level." We are opposed to it on the
grounds that the incomplete should not be so restricted in
all cases. Furthermore, we find the recommendation useless
in that professors will still have discretion to determine what
comprises "a substantial portion of the course work."
Recommendation 5 ; DISAPPROVE
All this plan requires is that the registrar's office "widely
publicize the approach of each quarter's final date for
choosing the pass option." We oppose it because we don't
believe the pass/no credit deadline should be enforced under
present conditions. In courses where there is no basis for
grading other than the final exam, the student has no
feedback on how well he is doing by the time the deadline
approaches, and requiring an early "pass" decision would be
unfair.
