# Moynihan Lauded

### 
I feel that some response is
necessary after reading the Feb.
20 Daily editorial
" Moynihan—Yawn." The
presentation of the misused facts
results in a distorted presentation
of what actually occurred in the
choice of commencement speaker.
.. Sometime last week a Daily
reporter phoned me to gather
some facts about how Moynihan
was chosen as speaker. Nothing,
however, is said in your editorial
about how or why Moynihan was
chosen.
Rather, it is stating without
proper foundation that Moynihan
is a boring speaker without
interest to anyone, particularly
the graduates. When compiled in
the editorial, the skeletal facts
appear as a verdict of a kangaroo
University court. This is untrue.
The selection of Moynihan as
1975 commencement speaker is a
result of three months of careful
canvassing and research resulting
in a joint choice by a committee
composed of the three senior class
officers and four University
administrators.
The three senior class officers
spent two weeks in early October
gathering a general consensus of
whom the seniors would like to
hear speak at graduation. This
original list of approximately 40
suggestions was gradually
narrowed down to five choices
after two months of research to
compile resumes and dossiers,
followed by discussions of the
candidates' speaking abilities.

Some of the senior dass's
favorite choices were discarded,
but only after consideration of
their previous record as speakers
proved them to be incompetent or
downright boring. For example,
many seniors indicated a desire to
hear Bob Dylan, but his previous
speaking engagements, especially
one at a commencement at
Harvard, illustrated his total
incompetency to deliver an
address of any sort — which is the
purpose of a speaker at
graduation.
Moynihan is the seniors' fourth
choice, as the first three were
unable to speak due to prior
engagements. They are Katherine
Graham of the Washington Post,
Shirley Hufstetler, Eight Circuit
Court judge, and Robert
Penn Warren, author of All the
King's Men.
Many students are enthused
about Moynihan's choice,
including the senior class officers
and others involved in his
selection. He has, aside from his
"high sounding credentials" (Ben
Brown, Daily, Feb. 20), proven to
be an interesting and enthusiastic
speaker.
In short, we wish to clarify the
misconception that the choice of
Moynihan was a University
decision. Rather, it was a choice
of both seniors and administrators
arrived at after careful
consideration.

presentation of the misused facts
results in a distorted presentation
of what actually occurred in the
choice of commencement speaker.
.. Sometime last week a Daily
reporter phoned me to gather
some facts about how Moynihan
was chosen as speaker. Nothing,
however, is said in your editorial
about how or why Moynihan was
chosen.
Rather, it is stating without
proper foundation that Moynihan
is a boring speaker without
interest to anyone, particularly
the graduates. When compiled in
the editorial, the skeletal facts
appear as a verdict of a kangaroo
University court. This is untrue.
The selection of Moynihan as
1975 commencement speaker is a
result of three months of careful
canvassing and research resulting
in a joint choice by a committee
composed of the three senior class
officers and four University
administrators.
The three senior class officers
spent two weeks in early October
gathering a general consensus of
whom the seniors would like to
hear speak at graduation. This
original list of approximately 40
suggestions was gradually
narrowed down to five choices
after two months of research to
compile resumes and dossiers,
followed by discussions of the
candidates' speaking abilities.

Some of the senior dass's
favorite choices were discarded,
but only after consideration of
their previous record as speakers
proved them to be incompetent or
downright boring. For example,
many seniors indicated a desire to
hear Bob Dylan, but his previous
speaking engagements, especially
one at a commencement at
Harvard, illustrated his total
incompetency to deliver an
address of any sort — which is the
purpose of a speaker at
graduation.
Moynihan is the seniors' fourth
choice, as the first three were
unable to speak due to prior
engagements. They are Katherine
Graham of the Washington Post,
Shirley Hufstetler, Eight Circuit
Court judge, and Robert
Penn Warren, author of All the
King's Men.
Many students are enthused
about Moynihan's choice,
including the senior class officers
and others involved in his
selection. He has, aside from his
"high sounding credentials" (Ben
Brown, Daily, Feb. 20), proven to
be an interesting and enthusiastic
speaker.
In short, we wish to clarify the
misconception that the choice of
Moynihan was a University
decision. Rather, it was a choice
of both seniors and administrators
arrived at after careful
consideration.

major, is a co-president of the
senior class.)
I feel that some response is
necessary after reading the Feb.
20 Daily editorial
" Moynihan—Yawn." The
presentation of the misused facts
results in a distorted presentation
of what actually occurred in the
