# Grade Plan: Self-Defeating
## 
### 
The grading proposals of the Ad Hoc Committee
on Grading will not serve their intended purposes.
Both majority and minority members agreed
that the new proposals will have no effect on grade
inflation. The causes of higher grades are students'
desire to get them and professors' desire to give
them. Neither of these factors will be changed.
Furthermore, the argument that the new
proposals' drop deadline will save University
resources erroneously assumes that many students
presently register for classes intending to not
complete them, which forces more sections to be
offered and more teachers to be hired.
Even if this had any validity, the only way
resources could be saved would require the
institution of a drop deadline at two weeks instead
of the proposed seven. Nobody on the Panel was
"willing to endorse such an inflexible policy."
Individual Process
Learning is an intensely individual process, so
that students should make their own decisions
about completing classes and the mode of grading
used for evaluation. These decisions should be
made with a minimum of bureaucratic involvement.
One of the most important aspects of a
university education is taking responsibility for
one's personal intellectual growth. That requires
experimentation and sometimes failure. A dr>f
deadline/punitive grade system would replac<
individual struggle in crucial academic decisions
with an impersonal mechanism and the fear ol
failure. Responsibility is not induced hy
mechanisms, and personal growth rarely develops

through fear.
The majority argument claims that the present
grading system really aids less-prepared students. To
alleviate the effect of the new proposals on these
students, they offer the auditing option and better
advising as viable replacements.
Auditing is a dubious alternative. Auditors in
large classes are excluded from discussion sections
and labs. As classes become smaller, auditors
become less welcome. Because auditing allows only
limited participation in a limited number of classes,
less-prepared students will be unable to prepare
adequately in areas of difficulty resulting from
their academic background.
The majority seems unaware of the inequities of
the present advising system. Most advisers,
freshman and departmental, have little time to
spend on their advisees' course selection and
experiences. Very few make any special effort to
offer assistance in critical academic decisions.
The proposed drop deadline seven weeks into
the quarter is no solution. By the time the Registrar
has processed the drop cards and notified the
advisers it will be too late for the advisers, to aid
their advisees. Advising will not ameliorate the new
proposals' effects.
We feel that the new grading proposals provide
very poor solutions to the issue of higher grades
and use of resources.
