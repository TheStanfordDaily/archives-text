# Shuttle Bus Service To Cruise Through Stanford Streets In April
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Dial-A-Ride and shuttle bus service
will be offered on campus next
quarter, the Daily has learned.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
confirmed yesterday that Dial-A-Ride
services will begin "as soon as we get
everything together." A formal
announcement of the service is
planned for today.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape also acknowledged that shuttle
bus service will begin on a trial basis
on April 6 or 7, and will continue

through April 26 or 27. Final details
of the temporary plan will be released
at the beginning of spring quarter.
Students overwhelmingly indicated
in response to a questionnaire their
willingness to pay 25 cents for
dial-a-ride type service, according to
Mayer. The 1016 students who
returned the form voted by a two to
one margin in favor of the service.
'Green Light'
"I considered that the green light,"
Mayer explained, adding that he has
been negotiating the arrangements ever

since.
The service will not begin, however,
until a central dispatch number can be
arranged, Mayer said. "When students
call, I want someone on the other end
of that phone," he added.
Originally the Bridge may provide
the central dispatching, with phones
manned on a voluntary basis. Mayer is
meeting this morning with Snape and a
representative of the Bridge to finalize
the dispatch plans.
The University will not charge for
the shuttle buses, Snape said. Current
plans call for the buses to "make a
fixed loop of the campus, covering all
major areas," Snape added. The buses
would run every half hour from 8 p.m.
until 12:30 a.m.
'Rounded Up'
"We just rounded up enough money
to get started," he explained.
However, he noted, arrangements still
have to be made for hiring drivers and
for similar details.
The funding came from numerous
sources, but "there are no plans to
continue the service beyond the trial
period," Snape said. At that time, the
service's effectiveness will be
evaluated, and further plans made, he
added.
The Dial-A-Ride service, on the
other hand, "will continue
indefinitely, regardless of how it's
received," according to Mayer.
Although admitting he himself
would have preferred "fixed arterial
service," Mayer called the new plan "a
logical beginning."

MINORITY DEMONSTRATION—CharIes Ogletree, member of the central committee of Students for Equity—the
minority group that organized yesterday's protest in White Plaza — points skyward to direct the crowd's attention towards
a mystical voice he called "God." The voice, a tape-recorded message, bore a striking resemblance to Ogletree's.
