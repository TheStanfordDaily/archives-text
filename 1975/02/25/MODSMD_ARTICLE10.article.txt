## Nude Dancing: Men's Lib In San Jose Personalities Plus 
### Steve Hefter 
SAN JOSE—There was no
piano music. Just the cranking of
the 16 mm projector and the
self-perpetuated coughs of the
lascivious, topcoated customers.
The room was plugged with
smoke that seemed to rise from
the floor, and glasses clattered
when set on Coke-stained
tabletops.
It was dark; almost
somberingly so. Somberingly isn't
a word, but that's the kind of
darkness it almost was.
Danny Zezzo stood by the bar
with his arm around a vivacious
brunette wearing a panty-high
skirt, black high heels, and a 10
cent smile.
Danny is the man who books
the girls into the small joint on
Bascom street. And all the
G-string clad bar maids shuffling
drinks to shady-looking patrons
sitting one and two at a table are
his. So to speak.
I mean if all those quasi-naked
females were really his, his
5-foot-6 frame would not be in
good enough shape to squeeze a
lemonade tap, let alone a fleshy

thigh. And Danny certainly
wouldn't want that.
Bogartian Atmosphere
All around Danny Zezzo, an
incessant mist pervaded the room
and brewed with the idle
conversation stirring from the
licentious and the curious, if there
is a distinction.
It was almost as if you
expected Humphrey Bogart to
step out of a cigarette-smoke
cloud and approach some bar
maid through the übiquitous haze
with an un-Bogartian, "Hey
baby—wanna be my partner in the
nude dancing contest?"
But no such luck.
Instead, on the screen, three
women, two bananas, a peanut

butter sandwich and a rhubarb
plant enjoyed oral copulation on
an overworked nine-foot pool
table. In living color.
Men's Lib Bears Its Mark
Danny Zezzo came over and
talked about Thursday night
dancing. For on Thursday nights
at the Pink Poodle in San Jose,
the accomplishments of men's lib
have stripped their way through
the egregious days of yesteryear
when only females were allowed
to bounce around in all their
glory.
Now, on stage, nude couples
bounce, shake, entangle, prance,
simulate, swirl, pretend and wish
they could to the tunes of three
numbers chosen by the couples
themselves. They do this before
an audience, mostly of men, who
pay $5 a head to watch
pornographic movies and the nude
dancers while sipping
non-alcoholic beverages and
smoking cigarettes (the club's
liquor license was suspended two
years ago).
Zezzo is the "genius" behind
the idea.
"I thought that as long as the
girls were out there having a good
time we may as well allow the
men to do the same," he says.
"Actually, some men were
complaining that it was
discriminatory for us not to allow
males to dance nude. After all,
there is money involved and our
Monday night amateur nude
contests [for females] have been
paying off girls $40 and $50
dollars a shot.
"I suppose what it comes down
to is women's lib in reverse."
Taking It All Off
On stage, Mike and Susie (last
names have been left out to
protect the innocent) are dancing
cheek to cheek. Susie reaches
back and unties the strap at the
back of her long black dress with
slits up both sides. She lets the
shoulder straps slide down her
arms and she puckers her lips at
the crowd.
The dress slowly begins
slipping down her body. You can
hear the audience. They all
swallow at the same time.
Susie helps the dress along.
She's still puckering. She reaches
down to her slender waist and

with one sexy leg at a time
provocatively steps out of it.
The man in the front row, with
the steamed-up glasses, glances at
his watch and then at the ceiling
between healthy stares at the
naked body before him.
Perhaps he was brought up that
way.
Nude Dancing Is An Art
Susie undoes Mike's pants and
begins on his undershorts.
"They're doing well,"
comments another dancer named
Tony. "They've got some good
moves."
Tony should know. He's
danced in the amateur nude
couples competition before and
will soon be nuding it again. F'or
Tony, nude dancing is an art.
"You've got to think of
something original in your
routine. I change mine from
week to week."
Lori is Tony's partner. They

met last Monday at another club
where Lori performed in another
amateur nude contest.
Performed At Stanford
It is the same club where Lori
met members from Stanford's
K.A. fraternity, where she later
did a private strip show for the
frat. At present, Lori makes her
living this way.
"It's an ego trip," she says
about dancing naked.
"Everybody's looking at you and
all the applause and stuff. It's
kind of neat."
Lori sits there smiling
sagaciously. Amateur nude
dancing, in a perverse sort of way,
has given her notoriety and
self-confidence. It has become an
obsession which Lori playfully
enjoys.
Tony comes closer: "You
know, I only wish they had clubs
where males could dance nude
professionally. I mean, I'm an

electrician, but it's more exciting
out there on the stage than it is
messing around with wires."
Tony's wife thinks so too. She
watches Tony from the audience
and doesn't mind his
performance. "Money's money,"
she says. "I'd be out there myself
if it wasn't for this"(she points to
a bulging stomach).
Linda Lovelace Is Jealous
Once on stage, with clothes
off, Tony and Lori go at it like
none of the three couples before
them. Tony holds Lori by the
waist and lifts her whole body
into the air. Then Lori gets down
on the floor and begins making
strange oral gestures which would
even make Linda Lovelace
relocate one of her organs.
While the writhing is going on,
Pete Kuzinich, the owner of the
club, saunters over. He is a nice,
soft-speaking man, a little on the
heavy side. He and Danny Zezzo
have worked closely together to
come up with new ideas to
stimulate business. Now he has
another one.
"We'd call it college night," he
says voraciously. "We'd invite
couples from Stanford, San Jose
State, Foothill College and others
to come up here and dance. It
would make it real competition."
Kuzinich is serious.
Another Rose Bowl
"It would get some spirit going
between the various sororities and
fraternities to see which one
would win," he continues. "Nude
couples from one house would be
matched up against another and
then the winners would come
back and go against the different
schools. It would be great
competition."
As Kuzinich speaks, my mind
wanders. I see the Stanford Band
standing behind the bar playing
"It's All Right Now" while the
Dollies cheer on Stanford's nude
couple, pom-ponning across the
tabletops. It's another Rose Bowl.
KZSU's Mike Tollin perches
himself high above the stage and
calls out the play-by-play: "And
the Stanford couple removes a
skirt. What thighs! But USC is
coming back with some great
breasts, and wow, look at that!"
It's all pretty absurd but

Kuzinich goes on. "I think the
kids would really enjoy it."
Must We Abandon Everything?
And of course Kuzinich would
pack them in. But that's what it's
all about, isn't it?
I mean, with today's

unemployment and all, perhaps
nude dancing is the future.
But on second thought, when
the mist clears, perhaps nude
dancing will have marked the end.
Then maybe Lori will realize what
her ego trip was all about.

BARING THE FACTS—Every Thursday night at the Pink Poodle in
San Jose, nude couples dance for prizes. Last Thursday, Lori (back to
the audience) and Tony (with the tatoo) took first prize. Says Lori,
"It's an ego trip ... all that applause. It's kind of neat."

THE BRAINS BEHIND IT-When men began complaining that nude
dancing was discriminatory against males, Danny Zezzo came up with
"Nude Amateur Couples Night." Zezzo says: "What it comes down to
is women's lib in reverse."
