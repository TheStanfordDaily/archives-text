## Shuffling The Cards Harter Is... 
### Dave Robinson 
If Rich Kelley deserved to be kicked out
of the game Saturday night, Dick Harter
deserves to be kicked out of the Pacific-
Eight conference.
The feisty Oregon coach has made
significant contributions to Pac-8
basketball since traveling west in 1971
after five years as head coach at
Pennsylvania. He recruited Ron Lee, for
instance, allowing fans up and down the
coast to marvel at Lee's abilities. He lifted
Oregon from an 0-14 record to third place
in the conference in three short years,
creating basketball hysteria in Eugene.
Creaky McArthur Court is filled to
capacity every game, and it is a truly
exciting place to watch a basketball game.
But Dick Harter has also contributed a
lot of ugliness. His teams play kamikaze
basketball, and for most Oregon players,
kamikaze is a euphemism for cheap.
The Ducks simply play dirty. Mark
Barwig constantly plants himself in players'
paths as they jog downcourt, and then falls
down dramatically in often-successful
efforts to draw offensive fouls. Stu Jackson
grabs and shoves under the basket. Even
freshman Mike Drummond, who may have
been perfectly innocent four months ago,
showed signs of Barwig-like tenacity
Saturday night.
He poked, tripped and fell down as the
man who corrupted him roared approval
from the sidelines. And finally, Drummond
took a kick from Kelley while sprawled on
the ground. Kelley was ejected from the
game, just as the Ducks bad planned.
"We did it. We got Kelley out," Jackson
exclaimed.
Kelley's actions were hardly
commendable, and according to the rules,
his ejection was justified.
But he has been unmercifully provoked
by Harter's cheap tactics the past three
seasons. When Drummond "leg-whipped"
him, Kelley could stand no more. He lost
his temper and was kicked out of the game.

Somehow, it didn't seem justified.
Kelley's instantaneous anger drew a stiff
penalty from the officials, but Oregon's
premeditated dirty tricks go unpunished
except for occasional trips to the foul line
for Duck opponents.
Dick Harter has caused a wave of anger
and violence in the Pac-8. Barwig and Cal's
John Terry squared off in a brief fist fight
Friday night at Berkeley, and every Duck
game provokes unnecessary anxiety and
hatred for a collegiate sporting event.
Let's not even consider Harter's recent
arrest for drunk driving, or rumors that he
spends 80 percent of his time on recruiting
trips chasing girls instead of high school
basketball stars.
He has simply contributed a lot of
ugliness to Pac-8 basketball.
I left Maples Pavilion Saturday night
with a hollow feeling in my stomach. I was
happy that Stanford won, but the
post-game exhilaration of the hard-fought
— and cleanly fought — UCLA and USC
games was absent.
Stanford won, but the game represented
another notch in the loss column for Pac-8
basketball.

him, Kelley could stand no more. He lost
his temper and was kicked out of the game.

Somehow, it didn't seem justified.
Kelley's instantaneous anger drew a stiff
penalty from the officials, but Oregon's
premeditated dirty tricks go unpunished
except for occasional trips to the foul line
for Duck opponents.
Dick Harter has caused a wave of anger
and violence in the Pac-8. Barwig and Cal's
John Terry squared off in a brief fist fight
Friday night at Berkeley, and every Duck
game provokes unnecessary anxiety and
hatred for a collegiate sporting event.
Let's not even consider Harter's recent
arrest for drunk driving, or rumors that he
spends 80 percent of his time on recruiting
trips chasing girls instead of high school
basketball stars.
He has simply contributed a lot of
ugliness to Pac-8 basketball.
I left Maples Pavilion Saturday night
with a hollow feeling in my stomach. I was
happy that Stanford won, but the
post-game exhilaration of the hard-fought
— and cleanly fought — UCLA and USC
games was absent.
Stanford won, but the game represented
another notch in the loss column for Pac-8
basketball.

DICK HARTER
If Rich Kelley deserved to be kicked out
of the game Saturday night, Dick Harter
deserves to be kicked out of the Pacific-
Eight conference.
The feisty Oregon coach has made
significant contributions to Pac-8
basketball since traveling west in 1971
after five years as head coach at
Pennsylvania. He recruited Ron Lee, for
instance, allowing fans up and down the
coast to marvel at Lee's abilities. He lifted
Oregon from an 0-14 record to third place
in the conference in three short years,
creating basketball hysteria in Eugene.
Creaky McArthur Court is filled to
capacity every game, and it is a truly
exciting place to watch a basketball game.
But Dick Harter has also contributed a
lot of ugliness. His teams play kamikaze
basketball, and for most Oregon players,
kamikaze is a euphemism for cheap.
The Ducks simply play dirty. Mark
Barwig constantly plants himself in players'
paths as they jog downcourt, and then falls
down dramatically in often-successful
efforts to draw offensive fouls. Stu Jackson
grabs and shoves under the basket. Even
freshman Mike Drummond, who may have
been perfectly innocent four months ago,
showed signs of Barwig-like tenacity
Saturday night.
He poked, tripped and fell down as the
man who corrupted him roared approval
from the sidelines. And finally, Drummond
took a kick from Kelley while sprawled on
the ground. Kelley was ejected from the
game, just as the Ducks bad planned.
"We did it. We got Kelley out," Jackson
exclaimed.
Kelley's actions were hardly
commendable, and according to the rules,
his ejection was justified.
But he has been unmercifully provoked
by Harter's cheap tactics the past three
seasons. When Drummond "leg-whipped"
him, Kelley could stand no more. He lost
his temper and was kicked out of the game.
