Pucker Leads Golfers
Jay Johnston, who recently
traded his hockey stick for golf
clubs, fired a 69 yesterday to lead
Stanford to a 27-0 whitewash over
USF at San Geronimo golf course.
Johnston, the leading scorer on
Stanford's ice hockey team, shot
n]nes of 34-35 en route to his
three-under-par total.
Aly Trompas and Dave Baskins
each fired two-under-par 70s,
while Mike Peck shot 74. Conrad
Nilmeier contributed a 76, and
Mike Mcßride shot 81. USF's best
score was an embarassing 84.
The Cards, now 3-0 for the
season, travel to Silverado
Country Club in Napa Friday for
the Hayward Collegiate
Invitational.
Netters Over Miami
Stanford's tennis team showed
an estimated home court crowd of
1000 persons Monday why it's
still the premier team in the
nation as the Cards walloped a
strong Miami team, 7-2.
Stanford held a 6-0 lead (and
an assured victory) after the

singles matches which enabled
coach Dick Gould to experiment
with the doubles pairings. Miami
downed two of the three doubles
teams for its only points.
Nick Saviano, at second singles,
started the scoring by polishing
off Ail-American Joaquim
Rasgado in a quick 6-2, 7-5
match.
The Cards' number one man,
John Whitlinger, had to come
from behind to beat Alvaro Fillol,
a junior Davis Cup player from
Chile. Whitlinger had trouble with
his backhand in the first set, but
was still able to overtake Fillol,
5-7, 6-4, 6-4.
The Cards face Canada College
Friday on the varsity courts at
2:30 p.m.

Hold The Anchovies
The voting for the Pizza Hut
Basketball Classic is nearing its
home stretch, and Stanford's Rich
Kelley is only about 7000 votes
away from a guaranteed invitation
to appear in the event. Kelley is
trailing such basketball luminaries
as Maurice Harper, Roger
Momingstar and the amazing
Grasshopper Smith.
The top eight vote getters
receive invitations to play, and
Kelley is at number nine with 70,
829 votes. In eighth position is
Lionel Hollins of Arizona St. with
76,721 votes.
Senior Athletes' Speaker
Joe Patemo, head football
coach at Penn State, will be the
featured speaker tonight at the
annual Stanford Senior Athletes
Banquet at Rickey's Hyatt House.
Patemo's Nittany Lions will be

the first team the Stanford
football squad faces next season.
Last September, the Cards
dropped a 24-20 decision to the
Lions in a nationally televised
game.
JV Streak Continues
Stanford's JV cagers (12-4)
defeated San Jose State (17-5)
79-67 last night at Maples Pavilion
behind Sven Walker's 16 points
and Tony Hill's board play,
avenging a loss to the Spartans
earlier in the season.
The win was the Cards' sixth in
a row and 11th in their last
12. With two games remaining
in the season, Stanford is assured
of topping last year's record of
11-6.
