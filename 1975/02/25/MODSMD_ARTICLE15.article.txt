Ford Says Cambodia May Fall
WASHINGTON — The Ford administration
warned Congress yesterday that Cambodia is
running out of ammunition and will fall to
Communist insurgents within the next few weeks
unless it is given $222 million in supplemental
military aid.
"This is a moral question that must be faced
squarely," President Ford said in a letter to Speaker
Carl Albert, which was read to the House. "Are we
to deliberately abandon a small country in the midst
of its life and death struggle?"
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in much the
same terms, told a news conference that "if
supplemental aid is not voted within the next few
weeks it is certain that Cambodia must fall."
Appealing also for support of a $300 million
military aid request for South Vietnam, Kissinger
said "We are facing a more long-term situation of
the same order."
In a gloomy forecast, Kissinger said that "if
Vietnam falls as a result of an American decision to
cut off its aid that will have, over a period of time,
the most serious consequences for the conduct of
our foreign policy.
"This will not be immediately apparent, but over
a period of years it must raise the gravest doubts in
the minds of many countries that have been
associated with us."
Meanwhile, rebel gunners stepped up shelling of
Cambodian capital Phnom Penh and military
sources reported an isolated provincial capital in the
north fell to insurgents yesterday.
Demos Attack Oil Allowances
WASHINGTON — Democrats struck a blow at
the controversial oil depletion allowance yesterday,
agreeing to let the full House consider its
elimination as part of an emergency tax package.
The caucus of House Democrats voted 153-98 to
instruct the Rules Committee to clear the way for a
vote on an amendment killing the depletion
allowance for oil and virtually all natural gas
retroactive to the start of this year. Their action
overruled the Ways and Means Committee.
The amendment, sponsored by Rep. William
Green (D-Pa.), would be attached to the economic
emergency tax cut bill now under consideration.

The caucus action also will allow a vote on a
proposal by Rep. Charles Wilson (D-Tex.) to let
small independent producers continue to receive the
depletion allowance for up to 3000 barrels of
production a day if these producers have no interest
in service stations or refining.
Daley Defeats Three Challengers
CHICAGO — Mayor Richard Daley, attacked on
the issues of age and political corruption in his
Democratic party, brushed aside his first primary
election challenge in 20 years yesterday.
Daley, 72, rolled up one of his most impressive
victories in defeating three candidates who had
posed the most formidable challenge for the City
Hall office which had made Daley one of nation's
most powerful mayors and had earned him a seat in
the inner circle of the national Democratic party.
With 2898 of 3146 precincts counted, Daley
had 428,539 votes to 215,904 for his major rival,
liberal independent City Council member William S.
Singer, who began his primary campaign 18 months
ago and reportedly spent more than $700,000 to
dethrone Daley.
Ford Expects Oil Veto To Hold
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — President Ford voiced
confidence yesterday he will win his fight with
Congress over oil import tariffs. He also predicted
that Democrats will join hands and work together
with him in solving America's energy problems.
Addressing a White House-sponsored conference,
Ford departed from his prepared text to delete a
charge that Congress is courting disaster by failing
to act on his proposals.
In place of that criticism, Ford substituted praise
for the Democratic-controlled Congress for focusing
on the problem America faces in overcoming
dependence on foreign oil.
"They've finally decided to come up with some
answers," Ford said of the Democrats in Congress.
He told the gathering of government officials and
business leaders "we can argue about
differences ... but the main point is Congress now
is beginning to realize" that the problem must be
met.
He said he expects Congress to sustain his
promised veto of legislation blocking the tariffs of

up to $3 per barrel he imposed on imported oil.
Ford's optimism reflected a report he had been
given earlier in the day by his chief congressional
lobbyists that he had picked up enough votes in the
Senate to ward off the veto override attempt.
Black Muslim Leader Dies
CHICAGO — Elijah Muhammad, a sharecropper's
son who became the leader of the Black Muslim
religious sect that preached black supermacy, died
yesterday after a month-long illness. He was 77.
Muhammad, a millionaire and leader for more
than 40 years of the Nation of Islam, whose
members were popularly known as Black Muslims,
had been hospitalized since Jan. 29 and listed in
critical condition since Feb. 8. He died of congestive
heart failure, said James Barkley, a spokesman at
Mercy Hospital.
OPEC Considers Oil Pricing
VIENNA, Austria — Oil-exporting countries,
bitter over inflation and currency fluctuations,
began considering ways yesterday to price oil that
would exclude the U.S. dollar.
As a result, the dollar slid to new lows in
European markets but recovered slightly late in the
day after the central banks of Britain, France,
Switzerland and West Germany bought dollars to
support the rate. The U.S. Federal Reserve was also
reported selling foreign currencies to buy dollars.
As the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) began deliberations Iranian
Interior Minister Jamshid Amouzegar said he
believes the price of oil may end up being tied to
Special Drawing Rights, a unit of the International
Monetary Fund based on the value of 16 major
currencies.
Because most of the 16 currencies are now
stronger than the dollar, such a move would
effectively increase the cost of oil to the United
States. But countries with stronger currencies could
benefit.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with variable high clouds and patchy
night and morning fog or low clouds through
tomorrow. Slightly cooler days. Lows in the upper
30s and 40s. Highs in the upper 50s and 60s.
