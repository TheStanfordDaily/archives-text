# No Guest Professor To Use ASSU Funds
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The last two ASSU guest professors
invited to the University have been
unable to leave their countries, while
the nearly $12,000 collected in last
year's fee assessment sits in an ASSU
account.
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
reported that only about $100 has
been spent, for miscellaneous costs of
inviting Nguyen Huu Thai from South
Vietnam, including phone calls and
cables. The rest of the money "just
stays there waiting for a guest
professor," Olivieri said.
He added that the money "doesn't
revert to anybody." No one else will
get the money, including the students
who paid it, Olivieri said.
Thai, a journalist, was in jail when
he was invited to come as a guest
professor for this year. He was released
from prison last spring shortly after
students approved the choice, but he
has not been allowed to leave South
Vietnam.
Alternative Prof. Chosen
Thai has also not been granted an
entry visa into the United States,
according to the Committee To Bring
Nguyen Huu Thai To Stanford.
Committee member Jim Regan said
that the guest professorship board has
put aside $2000 in case Thai can get
into this country. As an alternative,
the board invited Hermann
Schwember to come from Chile.
Schwember had been a prisoner of the
military junta which took over Chile in
October of 1973. He and his family
were ready to leave for the United
States when he was arrested again,
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen
reported.
Schwember was supposed to arrive
by winter quarter. He holds a Ph.D. in
Electrical Engineering from the
University of California at Berkeley,
and has been working on both applied
and academic projects in Chile.
Fagen said that he had been
optimistic that Schwember would be
able to come, but "the hopes are
dimming again."
Visa May Be Delayed
Chile has been releasing some
political prisoners, ordering them to
leave the country immediately. But
Fagen said he now fears that the U.S.
might delay granting Schwember an
entry visa if he is released.
"We have heard rumors that have
not been denied . . . that the State
Department is making it hard for
prisoners now being expelled from
Chile to get into this country," he
said. A delay in getting his entry visa
could force Schwember to go to
another country.
Should Schwember not be allowed
into the United States, the board will
have to choo* another guest
professor. Selected by the ASSU

Senate last year, board members
include Don Mensinger, Kevin
O'Grady, Michelle de Planque and
Gerald Koblentz.
Schwember is now in Los Tres
Alamos, a prison outside of Santiago,
Fagen said. At one point Schwember
was charged with directing funds to
aid the families of political prisoners.
O'Grady said that he has little
hope for getting a guest professor this
year.
"We didn't want to rush out and
spend the money" on a less desirable
guest, he explained.
He said the money collected in last
spring's fee assessment will remain in
the account for next year's guest
professorship board.

been spent, for miscellaneous costs of
inviting Nguyen Huu Thai from South
Vietnam, including phone calls and
cables. The rest of the money "just
stays there waiting for a guest
professor," Olivieri said.
He added that the money "doesn't
revert to anybody." No one else will
get the money, including the students
who paid it, Olivieri said.
Thai, a journalist, was in jail when
he was invited to come as a guest
professor for this year. He was released
from prison last spring shortly after
students approved the choice, but he
has not been allowed to leave South
Vietnam.
Alternative Prof. Chosen
Thai has also not been granted an
entry visa into the United States,
according to the Committee To Bring
Nguyen Huu Thai To Stanford.
Committee member Jim Regan said
that the guest professorship board has
put aside $2000 in case Thai can get
into this country. As an alternative,
the board invited Hermann
Schwember to come from Chile.
Schwember had been a prisoner of the
military junta which took over Chile in
October of 1973. He and his family
were ready to leave for the United
States when he was arrested again,
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen
reported.
Schwember was supposed to arrive
by winter quarter. He holds a Ph.D. in
Electrical Engineering from the
University of California at Berkeley,
and has been working on both applied
and academic projects in Chile.
Fagen said that he had been
optimistic that Schwember would be
able to come, but "the hopes are
dimming again."
Visa May Be Delayed
Chile has been releasing some
political prisoners, ordering them to
leave the country immediately. But
Fagen said he now fears that the U.S.
might delay granting Schwember an
entry visa if he is released.
"We have heard rumors that have
not been denied . . . that the State
Department is making it hard for
prisoners now being expelled from
Chile to get into this country," he
said. A delay in getting his entry visa
could force Schwember to go to
another country.
Should Schwember not be allowed
into the United States, the board will
have to choo* another guest
professor. Selected by the ASSU

Senate last year, board members
include Don Mensinger, Kevin
O'Grady, Michelle de Planque and
Gerald Koblentz.
Schwember is now in Los Tres
Alamos, a prison outside of Santiago,
Fagen said. At one point Schwember
was charged with directing funds to
aid the families of political prisoners.
O'Grady said that he has little
hope for getting a guest professor this
year.
"We didn't want to rush out and
spend the money" on a less desirable
guest, he explained.
He said the money collected in last
spring's fee assessment will remain in
the account for next year's guest
professorship board.
The last two ASSU guest professors
invited to the University have been
unable to leave their countries, while
the nearly $12,000 collected in last
year's fee assessment sits in an ASSU
account.
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
reported that only about $100 has
been spent, for miscellaneous costs of
inviting Nguyen Huu Thai from South
Vietnam, including phone calls and
cables. The rest of the money "just
stays there waiting for a guest
professor," Olivieri said.
He added that the money "doesn't
