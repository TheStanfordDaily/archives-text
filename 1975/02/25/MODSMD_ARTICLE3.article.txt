# Feinstein:
## Don't 'Spread Yourself Too Thin' 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Women who want to hold political office should
approach the field with a background in a specific
area rather than "spread themselves too thin," San
Francisco Board of Supervisors President Dianne
Feinstein suggested last night.
Addressing barely 50 people in Cubberley
Auditorium as part of the four-day symposium on
"Women In Politics," Feinstein said women should
"gain a portfolio of expertise" instead of involving
themselves in numerous activities.
A speech by Frances "Sissy" Farenthold, head of
the National Women's Political Caucus, tomorrow
night will conclude the conference, sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and the Center for
Research on Women (CROW).
Feinstein attributed her political success in the
supervisorial election of 1969 to her knowledge of
crime. She won the most votes among all the
candidates, entitling her to the post of president of
the board. She said that she spent two and a half
years "behind bars."
She said she visited numerous penal institutions
all over the country in order to study the criminal
system.
Drudgery
Feinstein demanded that candidates be elected on
"their willingness to put in hour after hour of
drudgery" working on issues they consider
important.
She said men are frequently elected because of
their campaign rhetoric. "The fact of the matter is
government is not rhetoric," she said. People should
be elected on their "ability to work with their
colleagues."
"We tend to function under a male ethic," she
continued. "We tend to elect a man because we
think "he can take care of us."
Feinstein accused some politicians of promoting a
paternal image simply to win votes. She said San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto spends a great deal
of time cultivating a smooth facade to present to
the public.
Mayor's Job
Feinstein said her perspectives on the mayor's job

— which she may be gunning for soon — differ from
Alioto's. A mayor should spend more time on the
grubby day-to-day details of running the city than
on the more glamorous public relations end,
Feinstein explained.
Feinstein said that despite the new prominance of
women's liberation, women still face a severe
handicap when it comes to elective politics. She said
a poll during the last presidential election showed
that most voters would prefer a black to a woman

for the vice presidency.
Feinstein said she doubted she would ever seek a
high national office, since in addition to being
female she's Jewish, another major drawback.
Feinstein said that during her stint as student
body vice president she had "no power" and spent
most of her time on social activities. She said she
wanted to run for president, but stood at the
history corner and took a poll of passing men —
which showed she would lose.
Feinstein graduated in 1955, and knew Carla
Anderson Hills — another member of the class of 55
who was recently appointed secretary of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
She explained that as a former student body vice
president here she feels a certain dedication to the
University.
Feinstein said she has found women in politics
"less corruptable than men because they haven't
been exposed to power for so long." Unlike men in
city government who owe something to their law or
business firm, women are "independent." They
don't have to profit from the system, she said.
Corruption
Questioned by Susan Nelson, a Chicago Tribune
reporter, during a panel discussion after the speech,
Feinstein stated that women who had been exposed
to power wouldn't necessarily be less corrupt than
men.
She said she opposed tenure because "anyone can
become corrupted if they're in a given office too
long."
Feinstein said the assumption that women are
more emotional than men is merely a "myth." She
claimed that women are more open and direct while
men harbor their emotions.
Palo Alto City Councilwoman Enid Pearson, who
also participated in the panel discussion, mentioned
some of the remarks she's heard during her 10 years
on the Council.
She said when she tries to get support for issues
she is termed "sly and using her womenly wile"
while a man would be considered politically astute.

crime. She won the most votes among all the
candidates, entitling her to the post of president of
the board. She said that she spent two and a half
years "behind bars."
She said she visited numerous penal institutions
all over the country in order to study the criminal
system.
Drudgery
Feinstein demanded that candidates be elected on
"their willingness to put in hour after hour of
drudgery" working on issues they consider
important.
She said men are frequently elected because of
their campaign rhetoric. "The fact of the matter is
government is not rhetoric," she said. People should
be elected on their "ability to work with their
colleagues."
"We tend to function under a male ethic," she
continued. "We tend to elect a man because we
think "he can take care of us."
Feinstein accused some politicians of promoting a
paternal image simply to win votes. She said San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto spends a great deal
of time cultivating a smooth facade to present to
the public.
Mayor's Job
Feinstein said her perspectives on the mayor's job

— which she may be gunning for soon — differ from
Alioto's. A mayor should spend more time on the
grubby day-to-day details of running the city than
on the more glamorous public relations end,
Feinstein explained.
Feinstein said that despite the new prominance of
women's liberation, women still face a severe
handicap when it comes to elective politics. She said
a poll during the last presidential election showed
that most voters would prefer a black to a woman

for the vice presidency.
Feinstein said she doubted she would ever seek a
high national office, since in addition to being
female she's Jewish, another major drawback.
Feinstein said that during her stint as student
body vice president she had "no power" and spent
most of her time on social activities. She said she
wanted to run for president, but stood at the
history corner and took a poll of passing men —
which showed she would lose.
Feinstein graduated in 1955, and knew Carla
Anderson Hills — another member of the class of 55
who was recently appointed secretary of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
She explained that as a former student body vice
president here she feels a certain dedication to the
University.
Feinstein said she has found women in politics
"less corruptable than men because they haven't
been exposed to power for so long." Unlike men in
city government who owe something to their law or
business firm, women are "independent." They
don't have to profit from the system, she said.
Corruption
Questioned by Susan Nelson, a Chicago Tribune
reporter, during a panel discussion after the speech,
Feinstein stated that women who had been exposed
to power wouldn't necessarily be less corrupt than
men.
She said she opposed tenure because "anyone can
become corrupted if they're in a given office too
long."
Feinstein said the assumption that women are
more emotional than men is merely a "myth." She
claimed that women are more open and direct while
men harbor their emotions.
Palo Alto City Councilwoman Enid Pearson, who
also participated in the panel discussion, mentioned
some of the remarks she's heard during her 10 years
on the Council.
She said when she tries to get support for issues
she is termed "sly and using her womenly wile"
while a man would be considered politically astute.

FIRST STEP—Women who want to become
involved in politics should ' ;*in a portfolio of
expertise" and "not spread themselves too thin,"
Dianne Feinstein, president of the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors, suggested in a speech in
Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Women who want to hold political office should
approach the field with a background in a specific
area rather than "spread themselves too thin," San
Francisco Board of Supervisors President Dianne
Feinstein suggested last night.
Addressing barely 50 people in Cubberley
Auditorium as part of the four-day symposium on
"Women In Politics," Feinstein said women should
"gain a portfolio of expertise" instead of involving
themselves in numerous activities.
A speech by Frances "Sissy" Farenthold, head of
the National Women's Political Caucus, tomorrow
night will conclude the conference, sponsored by
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and the Center for
Research on Women (CROW).
Feinstein attributed her political success in the
supervisorial election of 1969 to her knowledge of
crime. She won the most votes among all the
candidates, entitling her to the post of president of
the board. She said that she spent two and a half
years "behind bars."
