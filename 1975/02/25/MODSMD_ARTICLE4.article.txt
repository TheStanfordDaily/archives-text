# Minority Groups Decry Proposed Aid Changes
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
About 350 students, protesting the
proposed cutbacks in financial aid to
minority students, rallied yesterday at
noon in White Plaza and then marched
to President Richard Lyman's office.
Although Lyman was not present,
Assistant to the President William
Stone told the group Lyman would
meet with their representatives on
Friday. In the meantime, Stone said,
the President's Office would "digest" a
statement written by Charles Ogletree,
a member of the central committee of
Students for Equity, which organized
the protest.
Ogletree's statement asks that the
University "follow through on its
consistent vocal commitments of
affirmative action practices toward
minority students in recruitment,
admissions and financial aid, by
presenting a written commitment of
this often stated position." It also asks
that affirmative action status be
extended to Asian-American students.
The rally, the third in six days,
featured four presentations which
repeatedly made use of humor and
satire.
Innovative Innovation?
The protest began with a skit
making fun of student apathy and the
University's positions on the SWOPSI
program cut as well as the minority aid
issue. A mock administrator told the
crowd that SWOPSI must be
eliminated because of the University's
commitment to "innovative
innovation."
Doug Chan, a member of Students
for Equity's central committee, spoke
next and called the plan to equalize
financial aid for minority and other
students "pseudo-egalitarian shucket
jive which will set back all low-income
people, including whites."
Chan said that the real issue was not
race but "class and class bias" at
Stanford. He also called for treatment
of Asian-American students as a
minority, noting that "the average
Asian-American graduate earns less
than the white graduate," and that
Asian-Americans are at as much of a
cultural disadvantage as other
minorities.
Another central committee
member, Loren Bloch, urged the
University to improve the financial aid
package for low-income whites as well
as minorities. Bloch's speech
emphasized the unity of purpose he
said all Stanford students have,
regardless of race.
Bloch read portions of Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs'
much-publicized memo on minority
financial aid. The crowd hissed at
Gibbs' statements, particularly the

passage noting "the elitist nature of
the institution."
'A Blatant Challenge'
Bloch concluded: "The Dean
advocates a socio-economic and
ideologically dogmatic elite at this
University which [is]. .. blatantly
challenging the American way of life."
Ogletree, the final speaker, told the
crowd to gaze into the blue heavens
and listen to a cassette tape he had
received from "God."
"God," whose voice bore a curious
resemblance to that of Ogletree, told
the crowd "I'm here in spirit," and
said he was sorry to see "Dick
[Lyman], Fred (Hargadon], Jim
[Gibbs] and Bob [Huff] giving you a
hard time." He urged the crowd to go
with him "to Dick's office" to protest
the minority aid cutbacks, and ended
with a humorous plea for church
attendance.

Ogletree, speaking for himself, also
criticized the argument that more
financial aid for minorities constitutes
"reverse racism." He likened the plight
of minority students to that of runners
who must start a 100-yard dash 20
yards behind the other competitors.
The crowd, approximately evenly
divided between black, white, Latino
and Asian-American students, then
marched over to Lyman's office in the
Quad, chanting slogans like "one
struggle, many fronts," and "diverse
yes, elitist no."
Stone, who obviously knew in
advance that the protesters were
coming, received Ogletree's statement
and immediately said that Lyman
would meet with Students for Equity
representatives this Friday.
His barely audible response drew
little reaction from the crowd, which
then marched to Old Union. After a
fi-w announcements and chants, the
rally dispersed at 1:30 p.m.
At the Old Union, Students for
FCquity circulated sign-up sheets for
volunteers. The group will continue its
protest by scheduling teach-ins "to
clear up the misconceptions implicit"
in most people's understanding of the
minority aid situation, according to
Ogletree.
Ogletree called yesterday's
demonstration a success, and urged
students to attend a planning meeting
tonight at 7 in Junipero Lounge.

The protest began with a skit
making fun of student apathy and the
University's positions on the SWOPSI
program cut as well as the minority aid
issue. A mock administrator told the
crowd that SWOPSI must be
eliminated because of the University's
commitment to "innovative
innovation."
Doug Chan, a member of Students
for Equity's central committee, spoke
next and called the plan to equalize
financial aid for minority and other
students "pseudo-egalitarian shucket
jive which will set back all low-income
people, including whites."
Chan said that the real issue was not
race but "class and class bias" at
Stanford. He also called for treatment
of Asian-American students as a
minority, noting that "the average
Asian-American graduate earns less
than the white graduate," and that
Asian-Americans are at as much of a
cultural disadvantage as other
minorities.
Another central committee
member, Loren Bloch, urged the
University to improve the financial aid
package for low-income whites as well
as minorities. Bloch's speech
emphasized the unity of purpose he
said all Stanford students have,
regardless of race.
Bloch read portions of Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs'
much-publicized memo on minority
financial aid. The crowd hissed at
Gibbs' statements, particularly the

passage noting "the elitist nature of
the institution."
'A Blatant Challenge'
Bloch concluded: "The Dean
advocates a socio-economic and
ideologically dogmatic elite at this
University which [is]. .. blatantly
challenging the American way of life."
Ogletree, the final speaker, told the
crowd to gaze into the blue heavens
and listen to a cassette tape he had
received from "God."
"God," whose voice bore a curious
resemblance to that of Ogletree, told
the crowd "I'm here in spirit," and
said he was sorry to see "Dick
[Lyman], Fred (Hargadon], Jim
[Gibbs] and Bob [Huff] giving you a
hard time." He urged the crowd to go
with him "to Dick's office" to protest
the minority aid cutbacks, and ended
with a humorous plea for church
attendance.

Ogletree, speaking for himself, also
criticized the argument that more
financial aid for minorities constitutes
"reverse racism." He likened the plight
of minority students to that of runners
who must start a 100-yard dash 20
yards behind the other competitors.
The crowd, approximately evenly
divided between black, white, Latino
and Asian-American students, then
marched over to Lyman's office in the
Quad, chanting slogans like "one
struggle, many fronts," and "diverse
yes, elitist no."
Stone, who obviously knew in
advance that the protesters were
coming, received Ogletree's statement
and immediately said that Lyman
would meet with Students for Equity
representatives this Friday.
His barely audible response drew
little reaction from the crowd, which
then marched to Old Union. After a
fi-w announcements and chants, the
rally dispersed at 1:30 p.m.
At the Old Union, Students for
FCquity circulated sign-up sheets for
volunteers. The group will continue its
protest by scheduling teach-ins "to
clear up the misconceptions implicit"
in most people's understanding of the
minority aid situation, according to
Ogletree.
Ogletree called yesterday's
demonstration a success, and urged
students to attend a planning meeting
tonight at 7 in Junipero Lounge.
About 350 students, protesting the
proposed cutbacks in financial aid to
minority students, rallied yesterday at
noon in White Plaza and then marched
to President Richard Lyman's office.
Although Lyman was not present,
Assistant to the President William
Stone told the group Lyman would
meet with their representatives on
Friday. In the meantime, Stone said,
the President's Office would "digest" a
statement written by Charles Ogletree,
a member of the central committee of
Students for Equity, which organized
the protest.
Ogletree's statement asks that the
University "follow through on its
consistent vocal commitments of
affirmative action practices toward
minority students in recruitment,
admissions and financial aid, by
presenting a written commitment of
this often stated position." It also asks
that affirmative action status be
extended to Asian-American students.
The rally, the third in six days,
featured four presentations which
repeatedly made use of humor and
satire.
