# Buddhist Students To Form Campus Meditation Group
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Buddhist students wishing to share
in "meditation, discussion and
furthering joint experiences" are
banding together in a campus
Buddhist society according to
Religious Studies Prof. Nancy
Lethcoe.
"So far, students have practiced
individually. Now they can come
together every week and identify as a

group," she said.
Peter Meic, a co-terminal student in
religious studies, said, "There is a
precedent for a lay type of
organization on the campus."
He said he is acquainted "first or
second hand" with "a good 40
people with serious interests in
Buddhism.
"There are enough people with
training in Buddhism to share their
experiences," he said.
Need Diversity
"There are many different forms of
religious study. Different people need
different forms. We need a diversity of
people, both foreign and American
students."
Michael Fossel, a first-year graduate
student in psychology, originated the
program. He said that "there was
nothing on campus, and we needed to
do something about it."
His idea for the society is a "very
non-denominational, very practical
social gathering. Its purpose can be of
ceremony, meditation, or discussion,
or the society can be of a devotional
nature."
He said that the formation of such
a society that calls itself meditational
or discussion-oriented often carries
misleading connotations.
'Looking For Extremes'
"The society is not meant to be
weird or far-flung," he said. "It's for
anybody — from the very religious to
those who couldn't give a damn."
"The society is looking for
extremes of people," he added. "We'd
like people from Scarsdale to Thailand
who have a variety of religious
experiences."
Lethcoe emphasized that "there are
a lot of quacks around" who pretend
to preach about Buddhism. She said
that the students would like to form a
"legitimate group" that performs
different functions for different needs.
Like Fossel, she stressed the fact
that they would like foreign or
American students with experience in
Buddhism to join the group as well as
people who are interested but lack
experience.
Fossel said that an earlier attempt
at creating a Buddhist society was
unsuccessful due to poor
communications and publicity.
Realizing that "we needed to do
something" for the number of
students interested, he and Meic have
initiated a second attempt by giving it
"more advertising."
