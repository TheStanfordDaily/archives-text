## Opinions editorial On Parking 
### 
ASSU Sen. Mike Lindsey said last week he will offer a
resolution to the Student Senate calling for a $1 fee
assessment proposal to be put on the spring ballot to finance
the ASSU's suit against the University on the parking issue.
It is likely that unless such an assessment is passed, the
class-action suit will die from lack of funds. The $3000
allocated by the Senate and the Escondido Village Council
to finance the suit is just about gone.
Still, we oppose such an assessment. We do not think it
would be worth the price. We don't think it's worthwhile to
charge every Stanford student $1 in an effort to save $7.f>o
for those with cars. In addition, students would not only be
paying for their own attorneys, but also indirectly (through
tuition) financing the University's expensive defense of the
suit.
We think that several ways of fighting the parking fees
will have a better chance of success for a smaller outlay.
We reiterate our recommendation that students fight each
and every ticket in court.
If every student who received a ticket for failure to
display a sticker would fight it, it's doubtful campus police
would have the resources or inclination to continue the
ticketing.
We also urge both the ASSU and the administration to
come to an agreement that the legal issues involved be
submitted to binding arbitration. Arbitration takes far less
time than a lawsuit, and would be far less costly if the
arbiter's decision is considered binding. Arbitration also
engenders less ill will than does a lengthy court battle.
We think a competent arbiter agreeable to both sides
might be found among the tenured law faculty at Stanford.
In future cases where the ASSU disagrees with a
University interpretation of a law, we suggest that both
parties consider settling by arbitration rather than going to
court. As we have seen, students can't afford to go to court
with the University.
