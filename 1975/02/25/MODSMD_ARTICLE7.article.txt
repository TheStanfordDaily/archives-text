# Terror Still Rules Iranian Nation

Last of two parts
As a part of the enactment of the
American strategy, Vice President Lyndon
Johnson brought to Iran reform proposals
which were to be called the "White
Revolution," to change the Iranian feudal
—oeanomic structure and introduce a
ii impendent capitalistic sector which would
facilitate and protect foreign and particularly
American capital penetration.
Besides shifting the Iranian economy from
~«aL£-sufficiency to total dependency upon the
7*WPst. these so-called reforms have also
fostered a repressive imperialist tool — the
Iranian army.
On June 5, 1963, in violent reaction to
, the Shah's "White Revolution," and in
1 protest of the arrest of the outspoken critic
, of the regime, Khomeini, a mass revolt broke
out all over the country. The army was
hastily called in to restore imperial law and
order. The ensuing ruthless military
repression resulted in thousands of deaths in
the three-day battles.
The prevailing climate of terror of the past
11 years has begun to produce disturbing
socio-political phenomena that are rapidly
altering the course of Iran's natural
development. The aim of the regime is to
westernize Iranian culture, to cut it away
from its national roots and to domesticate all
j efforts of cultural creation, whether in art,
philosophy or science.
| Flagging Iranian cultural endeavors are
counter-balanced by an onslaught of western
(mostly American) cultural propaganda

which would help to uphold imperialist and
capitalist ideology.
All other trends and currents wnich
contrast or question the existing western
system are carefully eliminated. Already, this
new cultural orientation has seriously begun
to undermine Iranian life. Iranian cultural
values are presented as retrograde, and
western values as progressive, upsetting the
psychological balance of the nation.
Consequently, the Iranian people, to
whom all possibility of freedom of
expression and cultural identity is denied
while facing the ever-present plundering by
the ruling class and imperialist powers, have
had no other choice but to resort to armed
resistance which explains the tragic violence
prevailing in Iran today.
In the past three years, though more than
200 political dissidents have been
executed and thousands linger behind bars,
the struggle against foreign dominance and
for social justice goes on.
In regard to tie contract between
National Iranian Radio and Television and
the Stanford Communication and Electrical
Engineering depsrtments, the General
Assembly of Iranian Students at Stanford
(GAISS) has issued the following resolution:
Due to the political repression in Iran and
its extension abroad, we are unable to
present this resolution ourselves and
therefore thank all those willing to act on our
behalf.
We strongly oppose the Stanford contract
and request the University to withdraw its
approval. We also support those Stanford

Brown, GAISS

groups in their opposition to the contract.
From 1953, when the CIA-led coup
brought the Shah back to power until the
present day, the Iranian regime has had one
main directive: to suppress those rising
against the ever widening class disparity, the
ever-increasing corruption at all levels of
political life, the lack of the most primitive
forms of freedom, democracy and social
expression and the continual naked
exploitation of Iranian human and natural
resources rendering masses more and more
impoverished and destitute.
This dynamic of suppression/oppression
has been carried out through large-scale mass
propaganda engraving the "imperial
ideology" onto Iranian society. Where
unsuccessful, the police-military-SAVAK
machine is operative which has resulted in
many many deaths and more than 20,000
political prisoners.
In compliance with the Shah's
self-declared intention of policing the Persian
Gulf and the Indian Ocean, the army's role
has been extended to neighboring countries
in order to defeat the revolutionary forces
opposing foreign dominance in their lands.
Thus, we believe that the $4 billion
satellite will be merely a coercive element of
the state's apparatus in its twofold purpose
of oppression and indoctrinization serving
only the U.S. world strategy of dominance.
