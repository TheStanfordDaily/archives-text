# Stalling On Frenchman's Terrace
## 
### William Ross 
Negotiations over Frenchman's
Terrace seem almost hopelessly
mired in a bog of bureaucratic
entanglements.
Frenchman's Terrace, a
225-unit housing complex for
Stanford employees, would be
built on Stanford land with funds
provided by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). The Urban Coalition
would manage the project and
Palo Alto would annex the land
on which it would stand.
If the project were built, both
Stanford employees and students
would benefit. Many employees
who now drive long distances to
reach the University would enjoy
the benefits of living near work.
Students would benefit from the
not inconsiderable income
brought to the University by the
lease of the land to the
government.

Since 1968, plans for the
project have encountered endless
obstacles.
First, many local residents and
some Palo Alto officials opposed
Frenchman's Terrace. No sooner
had the Palo Alto City Council
overriden that opposition to the
plan than the Nixon
Administration imposed a
moratorium for funds on certain
projects, including Frenchman's
Terrace.
Shortly after the freeze was
lifted, Nathaniel Colley, an
attorney for the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP), filed
a suit against the project, claiming
it would divert funds from
projects that would help the poor.
The suit was later withdrawn after
Colley studied the project more
carefully.
The most recent in the long

series of Frenchman's Terrace
misfortunes is the opposition to
the project that has been
generated by James Price, HUD's
regional director.
Price originally objected to the
plan because the University

insisted upon allocating 50
percent of the units to University
employees and 25 percent to
employees of firms located on
Stanford land.
Compromise
A compromise was reached last
summer. Half the units would be
allocated to University employees
under the new agreement, but
employees of firms located on
Stanford land would receive no
special reservations.
This compromise, however,
was not enough for Price. He also
continued to question the
University's plan to build 40
percent market-priced units, 40
percent moderately priced units
and 20 percent low-income units.
Price claimed that he was not
certain of the legality of the
restrictions under Section 236 of
the National Housing Act of 1965
under which the project would be
built. Price ordered his staff to
investigate its legality and added
that he would not recommend the
construction of the project to the
national office until all doubts
about its legality had been
resolved.
Justifiable Concern
Price's concern was justifiable.
Unfortunately, however, his order
went out a year ago today, and at
last report his staff was still hard
at work studying the matter.
Of course, now the office has
more than the legality of the act to
explore — it also must decide
whether the inflation of the past
year has made the project
infeasible.
Meanwhile, the office can't
seem to decide where it stands on
the issue of the project's legality.
Dirk Murphy, an assistant to
Price, told me last spring in a
Daily interview that there was no
question about the project's

legality. Last month, he said that
legal problems still remained.
And last month. Price wrote a
letter to Robert Moulton, director
of the Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, stating that he believed
that most problems with the
project had been resolved. But
Murphy told the Daily that the
HUD staff was still as uncertain as
ever about the project.
It is now obvious that Price
and his associates are not
enthused about building the
project. If this is true, then they
should report their findings to the
Washington office and let it
decide the project's fate.
If the report were unfavorable
— and it probably would be — the
University could present its
arguments to the government.
Indeed, Moulton will be in
Washington late this week to
attempt to find ways to get some
action on the project.
But whatever its views, it is
highly unfair of HUD's regional
office to stall on the project by
refusing to take any action on it
whatsoever.

insisted upon allocating 50
percent of the units to University
employees and 25 percent to
employees of firms located on
Stanford land.
Compromise
A compromise was reached last
summer. Half the units would be
allocated to University employees
under the new agreement, but
employees of firms located on
Stanford land would receive no
special reservations.
This compromise, however,
was not enough for Price. He also
continued to question the
University's plan to build 40
percent market-priced units, 40
percent moderately priced units
and 20 percent low-income units.
Price claimed that he was not
certain of the legality of the
restrictions under Section 236 of
the National Housing Act of 1965
under which the project would be
built. Price ordered his staff to
investigate its legality and added
that he would not recommend the
construction of the project to the
national office until all doubts
about its legality had been
resolved.
Justifiable Concern
Price's concern was justifiable.
Unfortunately, however, his order
went out a year ago today, and at
last report his staff was still hard
at work studying the matter.
Of course, now the office has
more than the legality of the act to
explore — it also must decide
whether the inflation of the past
year has made the project
infeasible.
Meanwhile, the office can't
seem to decide where it stands on
the issue of the project's legality.
Dirk Murphy, an assistant to
Price, told me last spring in a
Daily interview that there was no
question about the project's

legality. Last month, he said that
legal problems still remained.
And last month. Price wrote a
letter to Robert Moulton, director
of the Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, stating that he believed
that most problems with the
project had been resolved. But
Murphy told the Daily that the
HUD staff was still as uncertain as
ever about the project.
It is now obvious that Price
and his associates are not
enthused about building the
project. If this is true, then they
should report their findings to the
Washington office and let it
decide the project's fate.
If the report were unfavorable
— and it probably would be — the
University could present its
arguments to the government.
Indeed, Moulton will be in
Washington late this week to
attempt to find ways to get some
action on the project.
But whatever its views, it is
highly unfair of HUD's regional
office to stall on the project by
refusing to take any action on it
whatsoever.

Negotiations over Frenchman's
Terrace seem almost hopelessly
mired in a bog of bureaucratic
entanglements.
Frenchman's Terrace, a
225-unit housing complex for
Stanford employees, would be
built on Stanford land with funds
provided by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). The Urban Coalition
would manage the project and
Palo Alto would annex the land
on which it would stand.
If the project were built, both
Stanford employees and students
would benefit. Many employees
who now drive long distances to
reach the University would enjoy
the benefits of living near work.
Students would benefit from the
not inconsiderable income
brought to the University by the
lease of the land to the
government.

Since 1968, plans for the
project have encountered endless
obstacles.
First, many local residents and
some Palo Alto officials opposed
Frenchman's Terrace. No sooner
had the Palo Alto City Council
overriden that opposition to the
plan than the Nixon
Administration imposed a
moratorium for funds on certain
projects, including Frenchman's
Terrace.
Shortly after the freeze was
lifted, Nathaniel Colley, an
attorney for the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP), filed
a suit against the project, claiming
it would divert funds from
projects that would help the poor.
The suit was later withdrawn after
Colley studied the project more
carefully.
The most recent in the long

series of Frenchman's Terrace
misfortunes is the opposition to
the project that has been
generated by James Price, HUD's
regional director.
Price originally objected to the
plan because the University

insisted upon allocating 50
percent of the units to University
employees and 25 percent to
