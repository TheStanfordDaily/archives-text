Wright 'Misquoted'
Editor:
After 30 years of experience, I
ought to be hardened against
misquotation in the press. But
when it's egregious, I still get
riled.
Your reporter asked me a
direct question: was I concerned
that the use of the ASSU lecture
note service would cause students
to skip classes? My reply was
equally direct: 1 have no such
concern, since I believe that
Stanford students should make up
their own minds about whether a
class is worth attending.
Yet your story (Daily, Feb. 21)
reads thus: "| Professor Bach's]
concern — 'that people wouldn't
come to class' — has been shared
by Prof. Gordon Wright and
others."
1 am further quoted as
expressing a fear that "the notes
might cheapen the educational
process by encouraging, if not
lack of attendance, at least a lack
of attention in class." In fact, I
said no such thing.

CIA Helped Shah
Editor:
In Nicholas HofFs letter
(I)aily, Feb. 24), he makes one
hasty criticism of my facts about
Iran. I will admit to sloppiness in
referring to Iran as an Arab nation
(Daily, Feb. 14), while denying
responsibility for the typesetting
error which set Iran's population
at 3.5 instead of 35 million.
HofFs major charge, however,
is that the current Shah came to
power without the aid of the CIA.
The Shah did indeed ascend the
throne in 1941, six years before
the CIA was created. But he fled
the country in 1953, when
then-Prime Minister Mohammed
Mossadegh refused to step down
upon the Shah's request.
Mossadegh was unpopular with
the Eisenhower Administration,
which contributed some $10
million and several CIA agents to
help overthrow Mossadegh.
Not until after this coup did
the Shah gain the complete power
he now holds. The CIA has
admitted its involvement in this
overthrow.
