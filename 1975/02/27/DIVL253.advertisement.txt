The Admiralty Sandwich
One evening in the club at the Admiralty, Lord Ramsbottom was
going on, as usual, about a certain young Burnley, recently named
Commandant of the Bay of Bengal fleet. The Lord continued in his
regular orotund tones of condescension, speaking of Burnley as not
only a "shirty upstart," but as "a fellow lacking in all degrees of
refinement and taste."
It is true that Burnley was not one privileged with birth in the
aristocracy, (being the younger son of a prosperous Dunstable
tanner), but Richard Burnley was certainly not the boor Lord
Ramsbottom had painted him. He had risen by dint of skill and
alacrity from the ranks, starting as ship's boy at thirteen, and he
later became second Lord of the Admiralty, as Lord Duggan. His
career had been long and distinguished; he was famed for his
daring and brilliance in combat, and for his attention to his duties
in office. He married Margaret deWare, daughter of that family of
Northern magnates, and exhibited taste and refinement on all
occasions.
On this particular evening, young Burnley — who had just
returned from successful service off Greenland — proposed to
present dinner before the Club, suggesting to the chef sandwiches
after his own recipe. The chef obeyed, and soon the Admiralty were
treated to fresh crabmeat, mushrooms, and sharp cheddar cheese
over toasted rolls. The members tasted, paused — and then as one
raised their gleaming glasses on high, with huzzahs. Young Burn
ley's future was assured, although Lord Ramsbottom, it must be
said, demurred.
Today at the Drones Club you may have a sandwich much like
the one young Burnley offered to the Admiralty on that brisk
Victorian evening, and pronounce your own opinion upon /oung
Burnley.
We have 4 special sandwiches along with our regular
meals and daily specials. Serving continuously from 11 a.m.
