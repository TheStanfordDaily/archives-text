# Student Rep To Trustees Unlikely
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The University of California Board
of Regents' recent decision to add a
voting student member to their board
has so far sparked no move to add
students to the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
The question has not come up since
1969, when the Board rejected the
idea of having voting student and
faculty Board members and voted to
have them serve as voting members of
Board committees instead.
"I'm sure the item will be discussed
again," said W. Parmer Fuller III, one
of the Board's three vice-presidents.
Because of the large size of the
Board, Fuller said he could not predict
whether or not the Board would agree
to allow students and faculty as actual
Board members.
"I think it's unlikely at the
moment, but I certainly don't rule out
the possibility," he said.
Trustee Or Advocate?
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell, a member of the UC
Board of Regents, voted against
appointing a voting student regent. He
said he had doubts as to whether a
student regent would perform "as a
trustee and not as an advocate."
Campbell said he also felt the
existing system gave adequate
possibility for student input.
Previously, however, UC students did
not sit on Regents' committees.
ASSU President Mike Herman
noted that the idea of getting faculty
and students on the Stanford Board
has been "kicked around for several
years" by ASSU presidents.
Herman said he thought it was
"very important to have student
representation" in every step of the
decision-making process. However, he
foresaw difficulties in deciding "how
that person would be selected and
what he would do" once he got on the
Board.
ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott, a
member of the Board's Committee for
Finance and Development, said he did
not see much difficulty in the
selection process of a student board
member.
'Not The Next Step'
He noted that the five-year term
Board members are expected to serve
could be a problem for a student
trustee. McDermott was "not sure"
that it would be wise to select a
student to serve for the next five
years, but observed that otherwise
there would be a problem of
discontinuity.
In terms of student influence,"I do
not think the next step immediately is
to get a student on the Board,"
McDermott said.
A more important step, he said, is
getting a student onto the trustees' Ad
Hoc Budget Committee "because
basically it has the most power of any
