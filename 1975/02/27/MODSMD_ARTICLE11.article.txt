## Opinions editorials On Abortion.... 
### 
The recent conviction of Boston physician Kenneth
Edelin on manslaughter charges for performing an abortion
on a six-month old fetus strikes us as a ridiculous attempt to
circumvent the Supreme Court's 1973 ruling on abortion.
The decision of the jury appears to defy common
understanding of what an abortion is. The jury is apparently
saying that the Supreme Court ruling defines abortion as
"termination of pregnancy," when common understanding
of abortion indicates that it is "termination of the fetus."
It would be paradoxical to allow a physician to perform
an abortion only if he attempted to save the fetus
afterwards. There would be no logical reason for a woman to
seek an abortion if the fetus were to be kept alive after being
removed.
We urge the Supreme Court to clarify its ruling, if
necessary, to say what it obviously meant to say â€” that
abortion means termination of the fetus.
We don't think this case ever should have been brought
before a jury in the first place. While the age of the fetus was
debated in court, it seems reasonably clear that the abortion
was performed before the fetus reached "viability,"
generally considered 24 to 28 weeks after conception.
We are sorry that opponents of abortion fought their case
by turning a physician into a criminal while he was doing
what is commonly accepted as legal. We hope the conviction
will be speedily overturned.
