# ...And Watergate
## 
### 
Judge John J. Sirica last week sentenced three of former
President Richard M. Nixon's closest aides to jail terms of
two-and-a-half to eight years. He also decided that the three,
H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and John Mitchcll, must
serve a minimum of two-and-a-half years before becoming
eligible for parole.
We think Sirica's relatively strict sentences are deserved
ones. While Ehrlichman's plea that he be allowed to do legal
work for Native Americans in New Mexico in lieu of
imprisonment is not an unworthy one, we think that in a
case of this magnitude, imprisonment is necessary to restore
confidence in the American judicial system. We find it
satisfying to realize that even the mighty can be brought to
justice if they abuse their power.
Despite these sentences, however, we cannot have total
faith in equality of American justice. We're sorry that the
pardon granted to Nixon will most likely prevent the whole
truth about his role in Watergate from coming out even as
the men who worked for him suffer the punishment they
deserve.
