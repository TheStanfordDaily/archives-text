# UFW Defends Exploited Workers
## 
### 
The Feb. 18 Daily printed a column, by
Peter Ferrara of Harvard University, on the
alleged exploitation of farmworkers by Cesar
Chavez and the United Farmworkers Union
(UFW).
Ferrara claims that the UFW has greatly
exaggerated the number of migrant
farmworkers following crops from harvest to
harvest, and cites Department of Agriculture
statistics which show that eight percent of
farmworkers nationwide, and nine percent in
California, are deemed migrants.
What he fails to consider is the fact that
these figures represent workers in all sectors
of American agriculture, many of which only
require permanent work forces. However, the
percentage of migrant workers in grape,
lettuce and tomato fields is much higher than
eight or nine percent, since these crops
demand a great increase in the labor supply
at harvest time.
The same can be said of his statements
concerning wage rates for grape and lettuce

workers, which he maintains are quite high.
The $2.89 an hour figure for Callo
workers and the $5.70 an hour for lettuce
workers sound fine until one realizes that
those numbers get chipped down by fees paid
to the labor contractors for "services
rendered," outlandish housing and utility
payments (for definitely sub-standard
facilities) and by various and vague fringe
benefit plans which seldom materialize for
workers with little job security.
Finally, and most appallingly, Ferrara
maintains that UFW strikes, from Delano on,
have never been supported by workers and
that this lack of worker support forced
Chavez into the tactic of the consumer
boycott aimed at grape and lettuce growers.
He bases this claim on the fact that during
the various strikes relatively few workers
were missing from the fields despite the
crowds on the strike lines.
Attributing the great number of strikers to
the presence of radical student groups (an

Terrence Kenny j

utterly outlandish assumption), Ferrara
blithely skips over an obvious conclusion:
there were workers in the fields because
strikebreakers had been brought in to crush
the UFW effort.
Strikebreaking has been standard grower
practice since the beginnings of the UFW,
and great numbers of poor and desperate
Mexican nationals have been spirited into the
U.S. illegally by labor contractors for the
dual purpose of weakening UFW strikes and
assuring a cheap and unquestioning labor
supply.
Thus, the UFW resorted to the consumer
boycott of grapes, lettuce and Gallo wines,
not because of a lack of worker support, but
because the strikebreaking tactics of growers
forced the union into taking its struggle for
justice directly to the cities and towns of the
United States.

workers, which he maintains are quite high.
The $2.89 an hour figure for Callo
workers and the $5.70 an hour for lettuce
workers sound fine until one realizes that
those numbers get chipped down by fees paid
to the labor contractors for "services
rendered," outlandish housing and utility
payments (for definitely sub-standard
facilities) and by various and vague fringe
benefit plans which seldom materialize for
workers with little job security.
Finally, and most appallingly, Ferrara
maintains that UFW strikes, from Delano on,
have never been supported by workers and
that this lack of worker support forced
Chavez into the tactic of the consumer
boycott aimed at grape and lettuce growers.
He bases this claim on the fact that during
the various strikes relatively few workers
were missing from the fields despite the
crowds on the strike lines.
Attributing the great number of strikers to
the presence of radical student groups (an

utterly outlandish assumption), Ferrara
blithely skips over an obvious conclusion:
there were workers in the fields because
strikebreakers had been brought in to crush
the UFW effort.
Strikebreaking has been standard grower
practice since the beginnings of the UFW,
and great numbers of poor and desperate
Mexican nationals have been spirited into the
U.S. illegally by labor contractors for the
dual purpose of weakening UFW strikes and
assuring a cheap and unquestioning labor
supply.
Thus, the UFW resorted to the consumer
boycott of grapes, lettuce and Gallo wines,
not because of a lack of worker support, but
because the strikebreaking tactics of growers
forced the union into taking its struggle for
justice directly to the cities and towns of the
United States.

The Feb. 18 Daily printed a column, by
Peter Ferrara of Harvard University, on the
alleged exploitation of farmworkers by Cesar
Chavez and the United Farmworkers Union
(UFW).
Ferrara claims that the UFW has greatly
exaggerated the number of migrant
farmworkers following crops from harvest to
harvest, and cites Department of Agriculture
statistics which show that eight percent of
farmworkers nationwide, and nine percent in
California, are deemed migrants.
What he fails to consider is the fact that
these figures represent workers in all sectors
of American agriculture, many of which only
require permanent work forces. However, the
percentage of migrant workers in grape,
lettuce and tomato fields is much higher than
eight or nine percent, since these crops
demand a great increase in the labor supply
at harvest time.
The same can be said of his statements
concerning wage rates for grape and lettuce

workers, which he maintains are quite high.
The $2.89 an hour figure for Callo
workers and the $5.70 an hour for lettuce
workers sound fine until one realizes that
those numbers get chipped down by fees paid
