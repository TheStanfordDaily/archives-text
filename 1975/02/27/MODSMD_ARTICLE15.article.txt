# A 						Call To Escape From America
## 
### 
Some two decades after Ayn
Rand finished her prophetic, epic
novel Atlas Shrugged, a band of
United States citizens is preparing
an escape from the collectivist
morass she correctly foresaw as
the culmination of modern
American ethos.
But unlike Rand's "men of the
mind," who sought refuge from
the government's tyranny over
their economic freedom in a
secluded hideout in the mountains
of Colorado, today's individualists
cannot expect to maintain
residence in the country whose
founding principles were a
beckoning call to such men.
Instead, the group of self-made
wealthy capitalists has embarked
upon a project called "The Search
for a New Country." It seeks to
locate the home base for "a
sovereign nation in which
government is limited to the sole
function of protecting its citizens
from force and fraud."
Shocking Idea
The idea is rather shocking to
those in the United States who
have long condemned evil
capitalists while living off the
wealth they produced. A largely
defamatory article in the
February Esquire began:
"For the first time in history,
the successful managers of
America's economy — its
entrepreneurs, financiers.

merchandisers, investors — are
talking rebellion. A kind of
rebellion, anyway. There is no call
to subvert the Republic, only to
abandon it. In increasing numbers,
America's most affluent and
active elites are threatening to
withdraw their funds, their assets,
ultimately even themselves and
their families from the centers of
the U.S. economy, which many of
them seem to consider done for."
The target of most New
Country efforts has been the
Bahamian province of Abaco, an
archipelago some 170 miles east
of Florida.
Abaconian voters have
consistently opposed the
socialistic policies of Bahamian
Prime Minister Lyndon Pindling,
and a delegation from Abaco
requested an exception from
Queen Elizabeth when the
Bahamas were granted
independence from Britain in the
19605. It was denied.
The Abaco Independence
Movement (AIM), which
according to the October 1974
Reason magazine is half black, in
proportion to the province's racial
makeup, is currently circulating a
petition seeking home rule. One
New Country source claims the
petition already contains names of
over half of the adult population.
Moral Experiment
"Abaco is not going to be

another banana republic," says
Mike Oliver, a leader of the New
Country movement, in Esquire.
"That's not the point; I wouldn't
spend an hour's time just to make
some money that way. The point
is that the Republic of Abaco will
be, / first of all, a moral
experiment, a place where we'll

try to keep individual freedom
alive even if it doesn't survive in
America."
But Oliver, in a February
newsletter to New Country
backers, is not optimistic over the
short-term prospects for Abaco,
essentially a backward region still
living in the age of paternalistic
colonialism. "Ultimately,
whatever help and assistance we
give, the success of the | AIM |
movement rests with the people
of Abaco. The choice is theirs."
The New Countryites have not
confined their search to Abaco.
But Reason said the quest has
been difficult because of the
"incredible unwillingness on the
part of established governments to
relinquish sovereignty over even
the smallest, most worthless piece
of land (even the worst collectivist
bureaucrat is apparently aware of
the remarkable power of truly
free enterprise to turn barren
islands and deserts into centers of
commerce — and he's not about
to relinquish his 'sovereign right'
to move in and tax what the
newcomer capitalists might
produce)."
In his book A New
Constitution For A New Country,
Oliver seeks to separate economy
and state by law. His work, which
has become the basis for New
Country political organization,
descends from the theories of
Austrian economist Ludwig von
Mises.
The document bars the
government from restricting trade
in any way, establishing any
school or church, owning any
property, supporting any welfare
program or interfering with wages
and prices. It conceives a plan for
voluntary funding of government

to avoid taxation.
Writes Oliver in his book, "The
United States can no longer be
saved from severe crisis. . .
Though not >et under complete
tyranny, prevalence of totalitarian
ideas and increased use of
suppressive measures prove that
the end of freedom is in sight . . .
only those who arrange for a
timely departure will escape th,?
coming horror."
New Country backers, whose
immediate economic plans are
consistent with those in Harry
Browne's You Can Profit From A
Monetary Crisis, are convinced
that the time has come to
abandon America to the
altruist/statist axis which has
perverted the country's political
and social mores.

archipelago some 170 miles east
of Florida.
Abaconian voters have
consistently opposed the
socialistic policies of Bahamian
Prime Minister Lyndon Pindling,
and a delegation from Abaco
requested an exception from
Queen Elizabeth when the
Bahamas were granted
independence from Britain in the
19605. It was denied.
The Abaco Independence
Movement (AIM), which
according to the October 1974
Reason magazine is half black, in
proportion to the province's racial
makeup, is currently circulating a
petition seeking home rule. One
New Country source claims the
petition already contains names of
over half of the adult population.
Moral Experiment
"Abaco is not going to be

another banana republic," says
Mike Oliver, a leader of the New
Country movement, in Esquire.
"That's not the point; I wouldn't
spend an hour's time just to make
some money that way. The point
is that the Republic of Abaco will
be, / first of all, a moral
experiment, a place where we'll

try to keep individual freedom
alive even if it doesn't survive in
America."
But Oliver, in a February
newsletter to New Country
backers, is not optimistic over the
short-term prospects for Abaco,
essentially a backward region still
living in the age of paternalistic
colonialism. "Ultimately,
whatever help and assistance we
give, the success of the | AIM |
movement rests with the people
of Abaco. The choice is theirs."
The New Countryites have not
confined their search to Abaco.
But Reason said the quest has
been difficult because of the
"incredible unwillingness on the
part of established governments to
relinquish sovereignty over even
the smallest, most worthless piece
of land (even the worst collectivist
bureaucrat is apparently aware of
the remarkable power of truly
free enterprise to turn barren
islands and deserts into centers of
commerce — and he's not about
to relinquish his 'sovereign right'
to move in and tax what the
newcomer capitalists might
produce)."
In his book A New
Constitution For A New Country,
Oliver seeks to separate economy
and state by law. His work, which
has become the basis for New
Country political organization,
descends from the theories of
Austrian economist Ludwig von
Mises.
The document bars the
government from restricting trade
in any way, establishing any
school or church, owning any
property, supporting any welfare
program or interfering with wages
and prices. It conceives a plan for
voluntary funding of government

to avoid taxation.
Writes Oliver in his book, "The
United States can no longer be
saved from severe crisis. . .
Though not >et under complete
tyranny, prevalence of totalitarian
ideas and increased use of
suppressive measures prove that
the end of freedom is in sight . . .
only those who arrange for a
timely departure will escape th,?
coming horror."
New Country backers, whose
immediate economic plans are
consistent with those in Harry
Browne's You Can Profit From A
Monetary Crisis, are convinced
that the time has come to
abandon America to the
altruist/statist axis which has
perverted the country's political
and social mores.

Some two decades after Ayn
Rand finished her prophetic, epic
novel Atlas Shrugged, a band of
United States citizens is preparing
an escape from the collectivist
morass she correctly foresaw as
the culmination of modern
American ethos.
But unlike Rand's "men of the
mind," who sought refuge from
the government's tyranny over
their economic freedom in a
secluded hideout in the mountains
of Colorado, today's individualists
cannot expect to maintain
residence in the country whose
founding principles were a
beckoning call to such men.
Instead, the group of self-made
wealthy capitalists has embarked
upon a project called "The Search
for a New Country." It seeks to
locate the home base for "a
sovereign nation in which
government is limited to the sole
function of protecting its citizens
from force and fraud."
Shocking Idea
The idea is rather shocking to
those in the United States who
have long condemned evil
capitalists while living off the
wealth they produced. A largely
defamatory article in the
February Esquire began:
"For the first time in history,
the successful managers of
America's economy — its
entrepreneurs, financiers.

merchandisers, investors — are
talking rebellion. A kind of
rebellion, anyway. There is no call
to subvert the Republic, only to
abandon it. In increasing numbers,
America's most affluent and
active elites are threatening to
withdraw their funds, their assets,
ultimately even themselves and
their families from the centers of
the U.S. economy, which many of
them seem to consider done for."

Some two decades after Ayn
Rand finished her prophetic, epic
novel Atlas Shrugged, a band of
United States citizens is preparing
an escape from the collectivist
morass she correctly foresaw as
the culmination of modern
American ethos.
But unlike Rand's "men of the
mind," who sought refuge from
the government's tyranny over
their economic freedom in a
secluded hideout in the mountains
of Colorado, today's individualists
cannot expect to maintain
residence in the country whose
founding principles were a
beckoning call to such men.
Instead, the group of self-made
wealthy capitalists has embarked
upon a project called "The Search
for a New Country." It seeks to
locate the home base for "a
sovereign nation in which
government is limited to the sole
function of protecting its citizens
from force and fraud."
Shocking Idea
The idea is rather shocking to
those in the United States who
have long condemned evil
capitalists while living off the
wealth they produced. A largely
defamatory article in the
February Esquire began:
"For the first time in history,
the successful managers of
America's economy — its
entrepreneurs, financiers.

merchandisers, investors — are
talking rebellion. A kind of
rebellion, anyway. There is no call
to subvert the Republic, only to
abandon it. In increasing numbers,
America's most affluent and
active elites are threatening to
withdraw their funds, their assets,
ultimately even themselves and
their families from the centers of
the U.S. economy, which many of
them seem to consider done for."
The target of most New
Country efforts has been the
Bahamian province of Abaco, an
archipelago some 170 miles east
of Florida.
Abaconian voters have
consistently opposed the
socialistic policies of Bahamian
Prime Minister Lyndon Pindling,
and a delegation from Abaco
requested an exception from
Queen Elizabeth when the
Bahamas were granted
independence from Britain in the
19605. It was denied.
The Abaco Independence
Movement (AIM), which
according to the October 1974
Reason magazine is half black, in
proportion to the province's racial
makeup, is currently circulating a
petition seeking home rule. One
New Country source claims the
petition already contains names of
over half of the adult population.
Moral Experiment
"Abaco is not going to be

another banana republic," says
Mike Oliver, a leader of the New
Country movement, in Esquire.
"That's not the point; I wouldn't
spend an hour's time just to make
some money that way. The point
is that the Republic of Abaco will
be, / first of all, a moral
experiment, a place where we'll

try to keep individual freedom
alive even if it doesn't survive in
America."
But Oliver, in a February
newsletter to New Country
backers, is not optimistic over the
short-term prospects for Abaco,
essentially a backward region still
living in the age of paternalistic
colonialism. "Ultimately,
whatever help and assistance we
give, the success of the | AIM |
movement rests with the people
of Abaco. The choice is theirs."
The New Countryites have not
confined their search to Abaco.
But Reason said the quest has
been difficult because of the
"incredible unwillingness on the
part of established governments to
relinquish sovereignty over even
the smallest, most worthless piece
of land (even the worst collectivist
bureaucrat is apparently aware of
the remarkable power of truly
free enterprise to turn barren
islands and deserts into centers of
commerce — and he's not about
