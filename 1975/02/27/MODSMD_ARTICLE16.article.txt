Teaching Counts, Too

Editor:
In his column "Questions
Remain Unanswered" (Daily, Feb.
25), William Ross stated that
"Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Lewis Spitz
explained that teaching and
participation in University
activities are not as highly valued
as is research." This statement is
simply wrong. Teaching and
research are both highly and
equally regarded in making tenure
decisions.
I told the Daily reporter that
from what I have seen of the
deliberations and decisions of the
Appointments and Promotions
Committee over the past year and
a half, the Committee has given
full weight to the importance of
outstanding teaching. University
service and campus activities are
not given the same significance as
teaching and research and I
counseled young faculty
members not to devote an
inordinate amount of time to such
things until they are well
established professionally as
teachers and scholars.
While many able young faculty
members can and do excel in all
three areas, teaching, research and
University service, this last is no
substitute for the first two,
though it is admirable and
appreciated. Let me say once
again, categorically and clearly,
that the University values
outstanding teaching quite as
much as brilliant research.
As Dean Halsey Royden
recently explained, an individual
who is to be recommended for
appointment or promotion to
tenure must be truly superior as
either a teacher or a scholar and at
least very good at the other. He or
she should be demonstrably the
best person available. These are
very demanding criteria, but they
have made Stanford the excellent
university it is today and must
remain in the future.
