## Personalities Plus: Footnote Mrs. Gibboney Dies In Placerville 
### STEVE HEFTER 
The saga of Herbert and Jean
Gibboney has come to an end.
Last Sunday, at Pioneer
Community Hospital in
Placerville, Jean Gibboney passed
away at age 54.
She was a woman who brought
so much love into her husband's
life that he offered to sell one of
his eyes to help finance her
medical care. As we reported last
week, that offer prompted Pioneer
Hospital to volunteer their
services for free.
As our story went to print last
Wednesday night, doctors were
announcing that exploratory
surgery had revealed Mrs.
Gibboney had cancer of the colon
which had spread extensively
throughout the abdomen. Her
chances did not look good and
doctors fought for her life with
chemotherapy treatments to halt
the spread of disease.
To the end, Herbert Gibboney
did not give up. "I know the
prognosis isn't good, but I still
have faith," he said. With tears in
his voice he added, "Neither one
of us has a fear of death but she's
going to be hard to give up if the
good Lord wants her. I wish 1
could change places with her."
The death of Jean Gibboney is
an unjust end to the story of a
noble gesture. A noble gesture on
the part of a man who faced the
world all alone, with nothing but
love.

THE END OF A STORY — When Jean Gibboney became ill, her
husband Herbert had no money left to pay for her medical care. So
late last month he took an ad in the Grass Valley Union offering to
sell one of his eyes for $35,000. In response, Pioneer Hospital in
Placerville volunteered free medical services. On Sunday, in the
hospital, Jean Gibboney, died of cancer at age 54.
