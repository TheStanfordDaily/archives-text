# Bug Me
## 
### Potty Fels 
If a person living in an independent house
wants to eat on the Row, he can't simply
exchange with a person on the Row who
wants to eat in his house. Instead, he has to
find four other people who want to exchange
with five people at the Row. This makes it
almost impossible to exchange, since it is
unlikely that there will be nine other people
who want to do the same thing on the same
night. In addition, this policy applies only to
the independent houses, not to eating clubs. I
don't understand the reason for this policy.
Why can't there be a one for one exchange?
—M.P.
Lynn Anderson, food service manager,
began her reply by saying, "I don't think
you're going to get a very satisfactory
answer."
She was right.
Apparently the five for five figure was "an
arbitrary decision" made by the food service.
"Five persons seemed to us to be more
program oriented," said Anderson. "There
should be a purpose why people are coming."
According to Anderson, the one for one
system would be impossible. "You can't just
get one person to go over and one to come
back," she said. "It just doesn't work that
way." Exactly why it doesn't work that way
was unclear.
It was also unclear why the Row and
independent houses are the only ones

affected. "I can't explain it but on the Row
this has seemed to work the best this year."
Anderson said.
"I'm sorry that 1 can't be more explicit
but it's a complicated system," Anderson
finished. We're sorry too.

Perhaps the "Bug Me" column could report
on the steps by which one gets a letter
printed in the Daily. I sent a letter to the
editor in the first week of school of the
present quarter (admittedly criticizing the
Daily) and it has yet to be printed, despite
the fact that Bruce Kadden promised that ii
would be. I look forward to your
presentation of why that letter wasn't
printed —M.K.
The following information is largely from
Bill Ross, Daily opinions co-editor.
First of all, Bruce Kadden has never been
opinions editor, and shouldn't have made any
promises to you. (He denies it.) Only the
opinions editor and editor-in-chief can
choose opinions page material.
The opinions page publishes about
one-third of the material that it receives since
there is not enough room on the opinions
page for everything, and also many letters are
very much the same on certain issues.
Occasionally, copy is not considered of

sufficient interest to a general audience or is
not written coherently enough.
However, you can rest assured that your
letter was not suppressed because it was
critical of the paper. Try reading the opinions
pages published after the Billie Jean King
article. The Daily regularly and exuberantly
publishes letters attacking it.
If you would like to discuss the issue,
come to the office and talk to Bill. He saves
all rejected copy and would be glad to tell
you why your letter wasn't published.

I um tired of looking at the mudhole and
untrimmed palm trees on the property
around the DU and Beta houses. Since the
I 'ni versify is responsible for that property
now, does it plan to do some landscaping in
the near future? —C.L.
Oscar Nelson says it does. So far, the
University has gone through a series of review
sessions to get the cost of the proposed
improvements estimated. The improvements
include grading and reseeding the lawn, doing
supplemental planting, and hopefully
installing some irrigation systems and doing
maintenance work on the existing trees.
The work won't start until the rainy
season has passed, probably in the late spring,
according to Nelson.

promises to you. (He denies it.) Only the
opinions editor and editor-in-chief can
choose opinions page material.
The opinions page publishes about
one-third of the material that it receives since
there is not enough room on the opinions
page for everything, and also many letters are
very much the same on certain issues.
Occasionally, copy is not considered of

sufficient interest to a general audience or is
not written coherently enough.
However, you can rest assured that your
letter was not suppressed because it was
critical of the paper. Try reading the opinions
pages published after the Billie Jean King
article. The Daily regularly and exuberantly
publishes letters attacking it.
If you would like to discuss the issue,
come to the office and talk to Bill. He saves
all rejected copy and would be glad to tell
you why your letter wasn't published.

I um tired of looking at the mudhole and
untrimmed palm trees on the property
around the DU and Beta houses. Since the
I 'ni versify is responsible for that property
now, does it plan to do some landscaping in
the near future? —C.L.
Oscar Nelson says it does. So far, the
University has gone through a series of review
sessions to get the cost of the proposed
improvements estimated. The improvements
include grading and reseeding the lawn, doing
supplemental planting, and hopefully
installing some irrigation systems and doing
maintenance work on the existing trees.
The work won't start until the rainy
season has passed, probably in the late spring,
according to Nelson.


If a person living in an independent house
wants to eat on the Row, he can't simply
exchange with a person on the Row who
wants to eat in his house. Instead, he has to
find four other people who want to exchange
with five people at the Row. This makes it
almost impossible to exchange, since it is
unlikely that there will be nine other people
who want to do the same thing on the same
night. In addition, this policy applies only to
the independent houses, not to eating clubs. I
don't understand the reason for this policy.
Why can't there be a one for one exchange?
—M.P.
Lynn Anderson, food service manager,
began her reply by saying, "I don't think
you're going to get a very satisfactory
answer."
She was right.
Apparently the five for five figure was "an
arbitrary decision" made by the food service.
"Five persons seemed to us to be more
program oriented," said Anderson. "There
should be a purpose why people are coming."
According to Anderson, the one for one
system would be impossible. "You can't just
get one person to go over and one to come
back," she said. "It just doesn't work that
way." Exactly why it doesn't work that way
was unclear.
It was also unclear why the Row and
independent houses are the only ones

affected. "I can't explain it but on the Row
this has seemed to work the best this year."
Anderson said.
"I'm sorry that 1 can't be more explicit
but it's a complicated system," Anderson
finished. We're sorry too.
