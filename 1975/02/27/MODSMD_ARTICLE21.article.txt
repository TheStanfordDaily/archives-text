# Best Bets
## 
### 
To make this week's column
exciting, we'll begin by telling you
what you can't do and see. There
are no varsity basketball games here
this weekend, though you can listen
to KSFO to find out what happens
in Southern California.
There are no public events
productions and there are no ASSU
special events concerts. In short,
there are only a very few activitier
meriting your attention. And mn«t

of them are off campus.
We'll stick our neck out and say
that this week's best bets are twe
plays. One is ACT's production of
Father's Day, starring Carole Cook
and Barbara Rush. The play
concerns divorce ana marriage and
received the LA Drama Critic's
Circle Award in 1973.
In spite of the fact that Los
Angeles critics like it and that the

play opened and closed in the same
night at the Berkeley Repertory
Theater in 1972, we think it might
be worth your while. If not, don't
come to the Daily asking for
refunds. We're still paying for
parking tickets.
If you desire cheaper tickets, try
the i oyon Hall production of Man
of La Mancha this weekend — it's
free. Toyon's players consistently
put on quality productions and this
one should be no different. You
may not see Richard Kiley, but
you'll have a good time.
Should you seek music without
scheduled comedy, try Dave Mason
and Commander Cody at
Winterland this weekend. For jazz
music enthusiasts, alto saxophonist
and contra bass clarinetist Anthony
Braxton will play at UC-Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium on Saturday
night — despite where he's
appearing, we're told he's worth
hearing. (Sorry for the bad poetry.)
If you seek music with good
poetry try the dynamic
combination of folksingers Arlo
Guthrie ("Alice's Restaurant") and
Pete Seeger ("If I had a Hammer")
Wednesday night at the Berkeley
Community Theater. How come
Berkeley?
A place called the
Exploratorium in San Francisco
features a light show and music.
This week, "new primitive music"
will be played by the "Pygmy
Unit." Instruments scheduled to be
played include: water flutes,
bootars, shakers, bells, gongs and

whistles.
If you don't know what a bootar
is and you seek music that's merely
culturally sound, don't miss
tonight's special performance by
the San Francisco Symphony of
Mozart Symphony No. 40 and
Brahms' "A German Requiem."
If it's hard for you to venture far,
then try our old standbys — the
local movie houses. Stardust
opened this week at the Aquarius
Theater in Palo Alto. It stars rock
singer David Essex as the leader of a
rock group in the sixties.
The film traces the rise and fall
of that group and features groupies
and the bubblegum set. And since
Essex doesn't sing his recent hit
"Rock On," you probably won't
become nauseated.
Note that Mel Brooks' Young
Frankenstein is still playing at the
Fine Arts Theater. Make every
effort to see it. Also, make a good
effort to see the ASSU Sunday
Flick, King of Flearts.
Finally, if you're besieged by
utter boredom this week, then
make yourself feel better by
watching Creature Feature on
Saturday night. One of this week's
films is called "Face of Terror"
(1960).
According to a press release, the
plot of this film is as follows: "A
woman's disfigured face is restored
by experimental surgery but reverts
during the midst of a romance."
Different strokes for different
folks, indeed.

music enthusiasts, alto saxophonist
and contra bass clarinetist Anthony
Braxton will play at UC-Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium on Saturday
night — despite where he's
appearing, we're told he's worth
hearing. (Sorry for the bad poetry.)
If you seek music with good
poetry try the dynamic
combination of folksingers Arlo
Guthrie ("Alice's Restaurant") and
Pete Seeger ("If I had a Hammer")
Wednesday night at the Berkeley
Community Theater. How come
Berkeley?
A place called the
Exploratorium in San Francisco
features a light show and music.
This week, "new primitive music"
will be played by the "Pygmy
Unit." Instruments scheduled to be
played include: water flutes,
bootars, shakers, bells, gongs and

whistles.
If you don't know what a bootar
is and you seek music that's merely
culturally sound, don't miss
tonight's special performance by
the San Francisco Symphony of
Mozart Symphony No. 40 and
Brahms' "A German Requiem."
If it's hard for you to venture far,
then try our old standbys — the
local movie houses. Stardust
opened this week at the Aquarius
Theater in Palo Alto. It stars rock
singer David Essex as the leader of a
rock group in the sixties.
The film traces the rise and fall
of that group and features groupies
and the bubblegum set. And since
Essex doesn't sing his recent hit
"Rock On," you probably won't
become nauseated.
Note that Mel Brooks' Young
Frankenstein is still playing at the
Fine Arts Theater. Make every
effort to see it. Also, make a good
effort to see the ASSU Sunday
Flick, King of Flearts.
Finally, if you're besieged by
utter boredom this week, then
make yourself feel better by
watching Creature Feature on
Saturday night. One of this week's
films is called "Face of Terror"
(1960).
According to a press release, the
plot of this film is as follows: "A
woman's disfigured face is restored
by experimental surgery but reverts
during the midst of a romance."
Different strokes for different
folks, indeed.

To make this week's column
exciting, we'll begin by telling you
what you can't do and see. There
are no varsity basketball games here
this weekend, though you can listen
to KSFO to find out what happens
in Southern California.
There are no public events
productions and there are no ASSU
special events concerts. In short,
there are only a very few activitier
meriting your attention. And mn«t

of them are off campus.
We'll stick our neck out and say
that this week's best bets are twe
plays. One is ACT's production of
Father's Day, starring Carole Cook
and Barbara Rush. The play
concerns divorce ana marriage and
received the LA Drama Critic's
Circle Award in 1973.
In spite of the fact that Los
Angeles critics like it and that the

play opened and closed in the same
night at the Berkeley Repertory
Theater in 1972, we think it might
be worth your while. If not, don't
come to the Daily asking for
refunds. We're still paying for
parking tickets.
If you desire cheaper tickets, try
the i oyon Hall production of Man
of La Mancha this weekend — it's
free. Toyon's players consistently
put on quality productions and this
one should be no different. You
may not see Richard Kiley, but
you'll have a good time.
Should you seek music without
scheduled comedy, try Dave Mason
and Commander Cody at
Winterland this weekend. For jazz
music enthusiasts, alto saxophonist
and contra bass clarinetist Anthony
Braxton will play at UC-Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium on Saturday
night — despite where he's
appearing, we're told he's worth
hearing. (Sorry for the bad poetry.)
