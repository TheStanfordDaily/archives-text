Diplomats: Aid May Not Save Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Diplomatic sources
predicted yesterday nothing would save Cambodia from
eventual collapse — even if the U.S. Congress votes all or
part of the supplementary military aid requested by the
Ford administration.
Sources said it will take more than money to rescue the
government of President Lon Nol, pointing out that it
suffers a severe manpower shortage. The diplomats also
believe the vital Mekong River supply line into Phnom Penh
will never be reopened.
However, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger said
yesterday in Washington that the probability is "extremely
high" Cambodia could survive if Congress approves the
$222 million emergency aid. But he added: "There is no
such thing as a guarantee."
President Ford told a Florida news conference the
situation is "extremely critical." He said, "Cambodia will
run out of ammunition in a relatively short period of time"
unless it gets new aid. Pentagon officials say Cambodia will
run out of essential supplies in March or early April.
Ford Compromises With Congress
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — President Ford signaled a
willingness yesterday to accept a tax cut larger than the
$16.5 billion reduction he has proposed, and he pressured
Congress to act quickly on the economic stimulant.
The indication came in a wide-ranging news conference
as Ford wrapped up two days of public appearances in
Florida designed to promote his economic and energy
proposals.
In addition to signaling a willingness to accept a larger
tax cut than he has proposed, Ford again indicated he is
ready to work out a compromise energy program with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
"What we need is a plan that the Democrats can agree
0n... and then we can sit down and, hopefully,
negotiate," he said. "I am willing to cooperate, but we have
to have something to cooperate with."
Daley's Opposition Withdraws
CHICAGO — The Republican candidate for mayor said
he was withdrawing from the race yesterday citing what he
called the "raw power and brute force" displayed in Mayor
Richard Daley's easy primary election victory over three
Democratic challengers.
"The machine has reached its ultimate peak. I've had it,"
said Republican John Hoellen, who was slated to face Daley
in the April mayoral election. "It's impossible in the
climate of total control by the Democratic organization for
any opponent to survive its raw power and brute force."
Even though Hoellen easily won the Republican mayoral
primary, he said he will ask the Republican leadership to

pick a more viable opponent to face Daley in April. Hoellen
had headed a search committee for several months to find a
candidate and agreed to run only after others refused.
Daley, 72, seeking his sixth four-year term, was
challenged in a party primary for the first time in the two
Hprades he has been mayor.
Assad Criticizes Kissinger Diplomacy
DAMASCUS — Syrian President Maiez Assad said
yesterday that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has left a
crucial element out of his Middle East diplomacy by failing
to consult the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
"It is not Cairo, nor Damascus, which decides peace
terms but the Arab people of Palestine ..." Assad told the
National Union of Syrian Students in Damascus. "The
rights of the Palestinians are detennined by the PLO and we
support the PLO in its claims."
Assad's bolstering of the Palestinians coincided with
reports in the semiofficial Cairo press that PLO chief Yasir
Arafat and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat will meet in
Cairo within the next two days.
U.S. General Warns 01 Soviet Build-Up
HEIDELBERG, Germany — Gen. Michael Davison,
commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, warned yesterday
of a Soviet military buildup and said congressional
troop-cut advocates should not be blinded by "the fog of
detente."
"The Soviet Union still desires to be the politically
predominant power on the European continent," Davison
said. "It would very much like to see the United States
presence removed from Europe."
Family Grocery Prices Still Rising
WASHINGTON — Higher middleman charges for food
continued to boost family grocery bills last month,
although the rate of increase was subsantially less than a
year ago, the Agriculture Department said yesterday.
The retail cost of a hypothetical market basket of
domestically produced food rose $10 on an annual basis, or
six-tenths of one percent from December. That compared
with a 5 percent increase during the first three months of
1974, officials said.
The USDA figures, supplied at the request of newsmen,
showed that the annual market basket price in January was
up $143 from January last year. The middleman share —
also called the farm-retail spread was up $199 while the
farmer's share was down $56 from a year earlier.
Today's Weather
Variable fog and low clouds night and morning but fair
otherwise through tomorrow. Little temperature change.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in
upper 50s to mid 60s. Westerly wind 10 to 20 mph in
afternoons.

U.S. General Warns 01 Soviet Build-Up
HEIDELBERG, Germany — Gen. Michael Davison,
commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, warned yesterday
of a Soviet military buildup and said congressional
troop-cut advocates should not be blinded by "the fog of
detente."
"The Soviet Union still desires to be the politically
predominant power on the European continent," Davison
said. "It would very much like to see the United States
presence removed from Europe."
Family Grocery Prices Still Rising
WASHINGTON — Higher middleman charges for food
continued to boost family grocery bills last month,
although the rate of increase was subsantially less than a
year ago, the Agriculture Department said yesterday.
The retail cost of a hypothetical market basket of
domestically produced food rose $10 on an annual basis, or
six-tenths of one percent from December. That compared
with a 5 percent increase during the first three months of
1974, officials said.
The USDA figures, supplied at the request of newsmen,
showed that the annual market basket price in January was
up $143 from January last year. The middleman share —
also called the farm-retail spread was up $199 while the
farmer's share was down $56 from a year earlier.
Today's Weather
Variable fog and low clouds night and morning but fair
otherwise through tomorrow. Little temperature change.
Lows tonight in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in
upper 50s to mid 60s. Westerly wind 10 to 20 mph in
afternoons.
Diplomats: Aid May Not Save Cambodia
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Diplomatic sources
predicted yesterday nothing would save Cambodia from
eventual collapse — even if the U.S. Congress votes all or
part of the supplementary military aid requested by the
Ford administration.
Sources said it will take more than money to rescue the
government of President Lon Nol, pointing out that it
suffers a severe manpower shortage. The diplomats also
believe the vital Mekong River supply line into Phnom Penh
will never be reopened.
However, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger said
yesterday in Washington that the probability is "extremely
high" Cambodia could survive if Congress approves the
$222 million emergency aid. But he added: "There is no
such thing as a guarantee."
President Ford told a Florida news conference the
situation is "extremely critical." He said, "Cambodia will
run out of ammunition in a relatively short period of time"
unless it gets new aid. Pentagon officials say Cambodia will
run out of essential supplies in March or early April.
Ford Compromises With Congress
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. — President Ford signaled a
willingness yesterday to accept a tax cut larger than the
$16.5 billion reduction he has proposed, and he pressured
Congress to act quickly on the economic stimulant.
The indication came in a wide-ranging news conference
as Ford wrapped up two days of public appearances in
Florida designed to promote his economic and energy
proposals.
In addition to signaling a willingness to accept a larger
tax cut than he has proposed, Ford again indicated he is
ready to work out a compromise energy program with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
"What we need is a plan that the Democrats can agree
0n... and then we can sit down and, hopefully,
negotiate," he said. "I am willing to cooperate, but we have
to have something to cooperate with."
Daley's Opposition Withdraws
CHICAGO — The Republican candidate for mayor said
he was withdrawing from the race yesterday citing what he
called the "raw power and brute force" displayed in Mayor
Richard Daley's easy primary election victory over three
Democratic challengers.
"The machine has reached its ultimate peak. I've had it,"
said Republican John Hoellen, who was slated to face Daley
in the April mayoral election. "It's impossible in the
climate of total control by the Democratic organization for
any opponent to survive its raw power and brute force."
Even though Hoellen easily won the Republican mayoral
primary, he said he will ask the Republican leadership to

pick a more viable opponent to face Daley in April. Hoellen
had headed a search committee for several months to find a
candidate and agreed to run only after others refused.
Daley, 72, seeking his sixth four-year term, was
challenged in a party primary for the first time in the two
Hprades he has been mayor.
Assad Criticizes Kissinger Diplomacy
DAMASCUS — Syrian President Maiez Assad said
yesterday that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has left a

terms but the Arab people of Palestine ..." Assad told the
National Union of Syrian Students in Damascus. "The

Florida designed to promote his economic and energy
proposals.
In addition to signaling a willingness to accept a larger
tax cut than he has proposed, Ford again indicated he is
ready to work out a compromise energy program with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
"What we need is a plan that the Democrats can agree
0n... and then we can sit down and, hopefully,
negotiate," he said. "I am willing to cooperate, but we have
to have something to cooperate with."
Daley's Opposition Withdraws
CHICAGO — The Republican candidate for mayor said
he was withdrawing from the race yesterday citing what he
called the "raw power and brute force" displayed in Mayor
Richard Daley's easy primary election victory over three
Democratic challengers.
"The machine has reached its ultimate peak. I've had it,"
said Republican John Hoellen, who was slated to face Daley
in the April mayoral election. "It's impossible in the
climate of total control by the Democratic organization for
any opponent to survive its raw power and brute force."
Even though Hoellen easily won the Republican mayoral
primary, he said he will ask the Republican leadership to

pick a more viable opponent to face Daley in April. Hoellen
had headed a search committee for several months to find a
candidate and agreed to run only after others refused.
Daley, 72, seeking his sixth four-year term, was
challenged in a party primary for the first time in the two
Hprades he has been mayor.
Assad Criticizes Kissinger Diplomacy
DAMASCUS — Syrian President Maiez Assad said
yesterday that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has left a
crucial element out of his Middle East diplomacy by failing
to consult the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
"It is not Cairo, nor Damascus, which decides peace
terms but the Arab people of Palestine ..." Assad told the
National Union of Syrian Students in Damascus. "The
rights of the Palestinians are detennined by the PLO and we
support the PLO in its claims."
Assad's bolstering of the Palestinians coincided with
reports in the semiofficial Cairo press that PLO chief Yasir
Arafat and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat will meet in
Cairo within the next two days.
U.S. General Warns 01 Soviet Build-Up
HEIDELBERG, Germany — Gen. Michael Davison,
commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, warned yesterday
of a Soviet military buildup and said congressional
troop-cut advocates should not be blinded by "the fog of
detente."
"The Soviet Union still desires to be the politically
predominant power on the European continent," Davison
said. "It would very much like to see the United States
presence removed from Europe."
Family Grocery Prices Still Rising
WASHINGTON — Higher middleman charges for food
continued to boost family grocery bills last month,
although the rate of increase was subsantially less than a
year ago, the Agriculture Department said yesterday.
The retail cost of a hypothetical market basket of
domestically produced food rose $10 on an annual basis, or
six-tenths of one percent from December. That compared
with a 5 percent increase during the first three months of
1974, officials said.
The USDA figures, supplied at the request of newsmen,
showed that the annual market basket price in January was
up $143 from January last year. The middleman share —
also called the farm-retail spread was up $199 while the
farmer's share was down $56 from a year earlier.
