# Foundation Donates $3000 To Aid ARLO
## 
### 
The Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) received a $3000 grant from
the Laras Foundation Monday, ARLO
Co-director Bill Leland announced
yesterday.
The money, increasing ARLO's
funds to $19,200, will insure the
program's operation until August,
Leland said. He added that the money
will be used "primarily for salaries"
for two half-time co-directors and a
three-eighths time office manager.
ARLO matches students wanting to
receive academic credit for research
within the community with local
organizations that need research done.
Our job is "developing projects with
community organizations and defining
the projects so they'd be meaningful
to students," Leland said.
About 150 students have registered

with ARLO this year, according to
director Leland. Projects range from
studies of rape and suicide in Santa
Clara County to an investigation of
fair housing in Palo Alto.
Since ARLO was created in Fall,
1973 by the ASSU Senate, it has
received a $10,000 grant from the
Hancock Foundation and additional
funds from the ASSU Senate, the
Council of Presidents and the
University Relations Office.
Leland said asking the students for a
$1 fee assessment this spring is under
consideration.
He explained that the assessment
money would be used "to insure our
existence for about six additional
months." During that time, grants
would be sought from the government
and various foundations.
