# Santa Clara's Dial-A-Ride Buses To Be Offered Here Next Quarter
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Regularly scheduled buses will
cruise along Campus Drive beginning
next quarter, with full Dial-A-Ride
privileges extended to Stanford
students, ASSU Vice President Quinn
Mayer announced yesterday.
The bus service will be provided
through the regular Santa Clara
County Dial-A-Ride system, Mayer
explained. The ASSU will place a
"standing order" with the county for a
bus to stop regularly at specific points.
Locations and times for the service
have not yet been determined, Mayer
explained, and will be flexible even
after the initial setup is announced.
"What we're waiting for now is
another computer run to determine
bus stops," Mayer said. "I want to
change the form of dial-a-ride as used
by Santa Clara County, to implement
several regular bus stops. It will be
possible to set up as many as eight
stops around Campus Drive and Galvez
and Serra Streets."
Mayer said arrival times for the

buses would be publicized.
"That would provide what amounts
to a scheduled bus service," he
claimed.
Mayer said a bus will halt at a bus
stop as long as at least one person is
waiting to be picked up. If no one is
there, the bus will go on.
"If there is no one at a given stop,
pretty soon buses would stop coming"
to that stop, he added. "I don't
anticipate that happening."
Students will also be able to make
individual requests for service.
Volunteers from the Bridge will man a
special phone line to be installed soon,
according to Mayor.
Seeking Student Preferences
"We will be soliciting information
from students . . . the location of the
stops that are most convenient for
them and the times," Mayer noted.
He said off-campus students
desiring regular transportation to
campus will also be accomodated.
"We will have operators manning

phones from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to take
orders for same-day or next-day
service. People can phone in for
same-day service if it's more than two
hours ahead," Mayer continued.
The service's only initial expenses
will involve telephone service, he said.
"The major snag right now is
installing the phones.
Telecommunications tells me it will
take about 10 days," Mayer reported.
COP Funding
Expenses will be paid from the
Council of Presidents (COP)
discretionary fund, according to
Mayer, with possible additional
funding from the Dean of Student
Affairs' initiative fund.
Mayer predicted that part-time
student telephone operators may be
needed if the service proves too
popular.
"If there is a lot of activity, we'd
have to expand beyond the staff of the
Bridge. That money I for new staffers |
would probably come, again, from the
Dean of Student [ Affairs'| initiative
fund," he said. "I have very reasonable
assurance of outside funding, in any
case," he concluded.
Stanford's "service area" for
Dial-A-Ride is roughly bounded by
Junipero Serra Boulevard, the San
Francisquito Creek, San Antonio Road
and Highway 101. Dial-A-Ride buses
will carry students directly between
any two points in the service area.
Arterial bus routes connect
Stanford's service area with others
throughout the county, enabling
riders to travel directly between any
two points in the county with at most
two transfers. All rides, regardless of
length, cost 25 cents.

Students will also be able to make
individual requests for service.
Volunteers from the Bridge will man a
special phone line to be installed soon,
according to Mayor.
Seeking Student Preferences
"We will be soliciting information
from students . . . the location of the
stops that are most convenient for
them and the times," Mayer noted.
He said off-campus students
desiring regular transportation to
campus will also be accomodated.
"We will have operators manning

phones from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to take
orders for same-day or next-day
service. People can phone in for
same-day service if it's more than two
hours ahead," Mayer continued.
The service's only initial expenses
will involve telephone service, he said.
"The major snag right now is
installing the phones.
Telecommunications tells me it will
take about 10 days," Mayer reported.
COP Funding
Expenses will be paid from the
Council of Presidents (COP)
discretionary fund, according to
Mayer, with possible additional
funding from the Dean of Student
Affairs' initiative fund.
Mayer predicted that part-time
student telephone operators may be
needed if the service proves too
popular.
"If there is a lot of activity, we'd
have to expand beyond the staff of the
Bridge. That money I for new staffers |
would probably come, again, from the
Dean of Student [ Affairs'| initiative
fund," he said. "I have very reasonable
assurance of outside funding, in any
case," he concluded.
Stanford's "service area" for
Dial-A-Ride is roughly bounded by
Junipero Serra Boulevard, the San
Francisquito Creek, San Antonio Road
and Highway 101. Dial-A-Ride buses
will carry students directly between
any two points in the service area.
Arterial bus routes connect
Stanford's service area with others
throughout the county, enabling
riders to travel directly between any
two points in the county with at most
two transfers. All rides, regardless of
length, cost 25 cents.
Regularly scheduled buses will
cruise along Campus Drive beginning
next quarter, with full Dial-A-Ride
privileges extended to Stanford
students, ASSU Vice President Quinn
Mayer announced yesterday.
The bus service will be provided
through the regular Santa Clara
County Dial-A-Ride system, Mayer
explained. The ASSU will place a
"standing order" with the county for a
bus to stop regularly at specific points.
Locations and times for the service
have not yet been determined, Mayer
explained, and will be flexible even
after the initial setup is announced.
"What we're waiting for now is
another computer run to determine
bus stops," Mayer said. "I want to
change the form of dial-a-ride as used
by Santa Clara County, to implement
several regular bus stops. It will be
possible to set up as many as eight
stops around Campus Drive and Galvez
and Serra Streets."
Mayer said arrival times for the

buses would be publicized.
"That would provide what amounts
to a scheduled bus service," he
claimed.
Mayer said a bus will halt at a bus
stop as long as at least one person is
waiting to be picked up. If no one is
there, the bus will go on.
"If there is no one at a given stop,
pretty soon buses would stop coming"
to that stop, he added. "I don't
anticipate that happening."
Students will also be able to make
individual requests for service.
