# Students Want More Radical Econ Profs
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
A recent study of student opinion
concerning the teaching of so-called
"radical economics" courses concludes
that sufficient interest exists for an
increased number of comparative
economics classes. The report also
recommends additional hiring of
professors who support radical
economic policies.
The survey, conducted by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Curriculum, was prompted by growing
student dissatisfaction expressed with
the courses offered in the field of
radical economics last year.
In its final report, published last
November, the Committee noted that
most juniors and seniors feel that not
enough effort is made to explain and
"contrast different [e.g., Marxist]
perspectives" in the core economic
courses (51 and 52, especially).
Sympathetic Faculty Preferred
Chaired by Asst. Economics Prof
Bruce Owen, the Committee also
concluded that "most students feel
that if an attempt is made ... [it is ]
preferable to have the presentation
made by a faculty member working in
and sympathetic to the Marxist
tradition."
In its concluding statement, the
Committee recommended "that
faculty members teaching these

courses either attempt to include
Marxist and other non-neoclassical
perspectives to the extent appropriate,
or to provide a multitude of options
for the student to make sure that these
alternative perspectives are presented
appropriately.
'Specious' Conclusions
Owen cautioned that there was
substantial disagreement among the
Committee members concerning these
conclusions, and that some members
"regard them as specious."
Assoc. Prof. James Rosse, Chairman
of the Economics Department, feels
that his department does encompass a
"reasonably large field of opinion.
"The department recognizes that
not all solutions are created by the
neoclassical point of view and shares
the concern with many students that a
number of different approaches be
presented,"he said.
"Our highest priority right now is in
the alternatives area," he said.
Rosse added that the department
has instituted a "search committee"
to look for new appointments to the
alternatives field.
This committee currently has been
inactive because of the University's
freeze on new hiring.
Rosse noted, however, that, "We
really have a number of very fine
young faculty members," in the
Economics Department.
The great majority of radical
economists tend to be rather young,
said Economics Prof. John Gurley,
who, at 55, is one of the country's
oldest converts to radical economics.
Gurley believes that the reason so
many young people espouse radical
economics is that radical
economics only recently has enjoyed a
great resurgence of popularity.
"Vietnam was the catalyst," said
Gurley. "It [the development of
radical economics) was an attempt to
understand why we were killing people
in Vietnam.
"Many became Marxists, as a
positive response to a negative feeling
about the war," he said.
"This brought into question the
other 40 or 41 national invasions by
the United States since the
Spanish-American War," he continued.
Gurley added that the view finally
arrived at suggested that conventional
economics was not addressing itself to
the real problems in the world.
