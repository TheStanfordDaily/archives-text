# Irish Blasts University Over Tenure Decision
## 
### RON ELVING 
Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish yesterday criticized the low
priority he feels the University is
placing on teaching, as evidenced by
his own tenure denial, at a lunch-hour
discussion in Memorial Church's
Round Room.
Speaking before nearly 40 people,
Irish said: "I am not a perfect teacher,
and my publications are not above
reproach, but am confident that I am
qualified for tenure at Stanford
according to the published criteria."
Referring to the criteria defined by
last year's Committee on the
Professoriate, Irish said he believed his
teaching met the "clearly superior"
standard and that his publications

fulfilled the "at least very good"
criterion.
Meanwhile, the Daily learned that
three other assistant professors have
been denied tenure for next year.
They are: Asst. Psychology Prof.
Cedric X, Asst. Political Science Prof.
Paul Sniderman and Asst. Chemistry
Prof. Leonard Stephenson.
X was unavailable for comment
yesterday. Sniderman and Stephenson
refused to comment as their appeals
for tenure are still pending.
'Puzzled'
Irish was the recipient of the Walter
Gores Award for superior teaching in
1971. "The Gores Award told me,
loud and clear, that there was a place
for people like me at Stanford," he
said.
Discussing his attempts to obtain
more information on the decision,
Irish admitted that he remains
"puzzled." The School of Humanities
and Sciences's Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee does
not keep minutes, and a candidate's
dossier is not open to him even when
the case is appealed.
Irish referred to two "lengthy
interviews" with Lewis Spitz,
associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, who participated in the
review.
"Dean Spitz has repeatedly assured
me," Irish said, "that he has great
confidence in me as a scholar and
considers me a giant as a teacher."
Although he cannot see the
critiques of "outside referees" who are
called upon to review his publications
for their value to the field, Irish
reported that "all indications are that
my writing has received very high
marks outside the University."
Given these impressions, Irish said
he believes his tenure was essentially
denied by "the other members of the
A & P Committee who were not
familiar with the field of my
publications."
Bases For Reconsideration
Touching upon the quantity of his
Women Speak

publications, Irish said he had received
publication commitments for "four
completely distinct written works"
since his manuscript on
p hi l oso p her-theologian Reinhold
Niebuhr was accepted for publication.
On February 11, Irish submitted a
formal appeal to Provost William F.
Miller. In his appeal, Irish presented two
bases for reconsideration: "insufficient
weight given to teaching superiority"
and "judgment of publications
provided by reviewers outside the
field."
If the appeal to the provost does
not overturn the original verdict, Irish
has the option of appealing to
University President Richard Lyman.
Irish also touched upon the
"message" he believes might be
derived from his tenure denial. "If a
junior faculty member is going to
concentrate on one area or the other,"
Irish said, "he had best make it
publishing."
Moreover, he added, "superior
teaching may even be used against
you, because it tends to make your
writing commitment suspect."

more information on the decision,
Irish admitted that he remains
"puzzled." The School of Humanities
and Sciences's Appointments and
Promotions (A&P) Committee does
not keep minutes, and a candidate's
dossier is not open to him even when
the case is appealed.
Irish referred to two "lengthy
interviews" with Lewis Spitz,
associate dean of Humanities and
Sciences, who participated in the
review.
"Dean Spitz has repeatedly assured
me," Irish said, "that he has great
confidence in me as a scholar and
considers me a giant as a teacher."
Although he cannot see the
critiques of "outside referees" who are
called upon to review his publications
for their value to the field, Irish
reported that "all indications are that
my writing has received very high
marks outside the University."
Given these impressions, Irish said
he believes his tenure was essentially
denied by "the other members of the
A & P Committee who were not
familiar with the field of my
publications."
Bases For Reconsideration
Touching upon the quantity of his
Women Speak

publications, Irish said he had received
publication commitments for "four
completely distinct written works"
since his manuscript on
p hi l oso p her-theologian Reinhold
Niebuhr was accepted for publication.
On February 11, Irish submitted a
formal appeal to Provost William F.
Miller. In his appeal, Irish presented two
bases for reconsideration: "insufficient
weight given to teaching superiority"
and "judgment of publications
provided by reviewers outside the
field."
If the appeal to the provost does
not overturn the original verdict, Irish
has the option of appealing to
University President Richard Lyman.
Irish also touched upon the
"message" he believes might be
derived from his tenure denial. "If a
junior faculty member is going to
concentrate on one area or the other,"
Irish said, "he had best make it
publishing."
Moreover, he added, "superior
teaching may even be used against
you, because it tends to make your
writing commitment suspect."

Irish yesterday criticized the low
priority he feels the University is
placing on teaching, as evidenced by
his own tenure denial, at a lunch-hour
discussion in Memorial Church's
Round Room.
Speaking before nearly 40 people,
Irish said: "I am not a perfect teacher,
and my publications are not above
reproach, but am confident that I am
qualified for tenure at Stanford
according to the published criteria."
Referring to the criteria defined by
last year's Committee on the
Professoriate, Irish said he believed his
teaching met the "clearly superior"
standard and that his publications

fulfilled the "at least very good"
criterion.
Meanwhile, the Daily learned that
three other assistant professors have
been denied tenure for next year.
They are: Asst. Psychology Prof.
Cedric X, Asst. Political Science Prof.
Paul Sniderman and Asst. Chemistry
Prof. Leonard Stephenson.
X was unavailable for comment
yesterday. Sniderman and Stephenson
refused to comment as their appeals
for tenure are still pending.
'Puzzled'
Irish was the recipient of the Walter
Gores Award for superior teaching in
1971. "The Gores Award told me,
loud and clear, that there was a place
for people like me at Stanford," he
said.
Discussing his attempts to obtain
more information on the decision,
Irish admitted that he remains
"puzzled." The School of Humanities
