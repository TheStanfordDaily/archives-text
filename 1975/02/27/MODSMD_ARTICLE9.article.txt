### DON LINDEMANN 
Second of Tltrec Parts

Voters in the Palo Alto Unified
School District will choose Tuesday
among four diverse candidates to
replace retiring school board trustee
Preston Cutler.
Two researchers at Stanford,
Joshua Goldstein and June Genis, are
in the running. The other candidates
are Jean Amick and Robert Tavlor.
The winner in Tuesday's election
will serve a five-year term in the
I non-paying trustee position.
| * * *
| Jean Amick, 38, is a homemaker
| who has served as president in two
; district PTA's and been active with
1 various school committees. She
M
| attended Stockton and Foothill Junior
I Colleges.
| A supporter of the three-year
| revenue limit increase measure
I appearing on Tuesday's ballot, Amick
I said she would "work for setting goals
and objectives for the district and each
program, then having programs and
staff evaluated, and cutting in those

areas not meeting the objectives."
She said she would establish
"citizen advisory committees" at each
school to gather information and
report to the Board at intervals, and
generally "encourage community
input for local school budget
decisions." She favors more local
autonomy, but "guided by Board
policy."
One of Amick's central priorities
for the district is improved career and
vocational education. Schools should
"provide each child with the necessary
skills to be self-supporting," she said.
According to Amick's statement of
candidacy, "future Board decisions
will not be easy, but with the
cooperation of the staff, students and
community, good decisions can be
made."
* * *
June Genis, 27, a researcher in the
Stanford Center for Information
Processing, is running on the platform
that "all taxation is coercive."
A graduate of the State University
of New York at Buttaio, she is
chairman of the Stanford Libertarian
Society and plays active roles in
regional libertarian and anti-taxation
groups.
The only candidate to oppose the
revenue base measure, Genis said. "1
don't believe that people should be
forced to do anything they disagree
with, and that includes participating
in, and paying for, the public school
system.
"I see no reason why parents must
accept for their children the
educational standards of a tyrannical
majority, or pay twice for the luxury
of dissent." she added.
"I propose that as a first step
toward the elimination of coercive
taxation, any tax payer may be
granted a rebate equivalent to amounts
contributed to, or expended at, any
educational institution."
Tomorrow: Candidates Joshua
Goldstein and Robert Taylor.

She said she would establish
"citizen advisory committees" at each
school to gather information and
report to the Board at intervals, and
generally "encourage community
input for local school budget
decisions." She favors more local
autonomy, but "guided by Board
policy."

don't believe that people should be

with, and that includes participating
in, and paying for, the public school
system.
"I see no reason why parents must
accept for their children the
educational standards of a tyrannical
majority, or pay twice for the luxury
of dissent." she added.
"I propose that as a first step
toward the elimination of coercive
taxation, any tax payer may be
granted a rebate equivalent to amounts
contributed to, or expended at, any
educational institution."
Tomorrow: Candidates Joshua
