I appearing on Tuesday's ballot, Amick
I said she would "work for setting goals
and objectives for the district and each
program, then having programs and
staff evaluated, and cutting in those

areas not meeting the objectives."
She said she would establish
"citizen advisory committees" at each
school to gather information and
report to the Board at intervals, and
generally "encourage community
input for local school budget
decisions." She favors more local
autonomy, but "guided by Board
policy."
One of Amick's central priorities
for the district is improved career and
vocational education. Schools should
"provide each child with the necessary
skills to be self-supporting," she said.
According to Amick's statement of
candidacy, "future Board decisions
will not be easy, but with the
cooperation of the staff, students and
community, good decisions can be
made."
