WOMEN IN THE DRONES CLUB?
"Women in the Drones Club?" Freddie Saplington-Wedge
cried, attempting unsuccessfully to thunder as he thumped a fist
upon a table at the Club, upsetting a salt cellar and thereby
incurring the considerable wrath of Bevens, the aloof but
nonetheless omnipotent major-domo, "never!"
"Tush!" replied Jinkie Holborne, his older friend and mentor,
as he keenly eyed the effervescent daughter of the
irreproachably wealthy Lord Deemings crossing the room in
her unremitting sashay, "times have changed, old chap. These
days women are welcome everywhere, you know. And I think
it's a jolly good idea, myself." Leonore Deemings flashed him
an unforgettable moment of smile.
"But dash it all," Freddie said, even further from thunder, "I
know as well as I know that precise turn of the tie which makes
maiden aunts happy to see you that Pamela Gussington-Fodge
— she of the Hellenic grace and marvelous patrimony — (yes,
I've been seeing her, Jinkie) would never condescend to enter a
club full of men talking foxes and inhaling claros — I just know
it. Why she has — "
Freddy was at this very moment in for the shock of his in
considerable life, for the young lady in question just then
strolled, in her ineffible manner, into the Main Room of the
Drones Club. Freddy, in truth, gasped.
"Dash!" he stated, still missing thunder, and he attempted to
catch Bevens' eye for another glass of rare Port. Bevens had,
pointedly, turned the other way.
Women in the Drones Club? Most assuredly. Times have
indeed changed, women are very welcome. Even preferred—for
every Wednesday and Thursday they are presented with a glass
of Cold Duck with their meal. And even Bevens approves of this
