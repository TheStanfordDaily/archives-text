# Six Sites Considered For Theme Houses
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The Committee on Services to Students' subcommittee on residences has
narrowed down the possible locations for the French theme house and the
Stanford-in-Stanford program from 26 choices to six.
Four Row houses — Hurlburt, Guthrie, Storey and Jordan — and two
residences in the Cowell Cluster ZAP and Terra — are being considered.
The subcommittee will be holding separate meetings with representatives from
these residences Sunday evening.
Because of the nature of the new theme houses, only residences housing from
35 to 50 students were considered, thus making most dormitories too large,
subcommittee Co-chairman Bill Rifkin noted.
From there, selection of the final six possibilities was made "through the
process of elimination," Rifkin said.
Residences already devoted to 2 theme were dropped first, followed by those
with existing alumni corporations which had originally donated part or all of the
money to build the house.
Popularity of the residence based on the first choice ratio in the spring
housing draw was another consideration, Rifkin said. The six houses being
considered were among the lowest in priority, Rifkin said.
Another consideration was the potential displacement of current residents(and
therefore the number of seniors

graduating).
All-freshman dorms were counted
out because "we don't quite meet all
the [frosh) demand now," said Larry
Horton, associate dean of students.
'Easy Decision'
"Although it would now seem to be
an easy decision" to convert a
freshman dorm, Horton said, "next
year's freshmen wouldn't appreciate
that."
For the French theme house the
need for a separate kitchen was
deemed "extremely important" by the
program's organizers, Horton said.
Because two existing houses will be
displaced by the new programs, "we
expect people to be upset," said
Rifkin. "We can't just put up tents,"
for the new programs, he added. He
expressed the hope that some house
would "volunteer itself."
'Lack Of Precision'
"It'll be a difficult choice," Horton
said. "None of us is wholly pleased
with the lack of precision" in the
selection process.
"Above all, we want to maintain a
spirit of vitality and innovation," said
Horton.
"If we did not have a policy of
innovation, we would not have some
of the successful houses we do now,"
he emphasized, pointing to Whitman,
Columbae, Synergy and Hammarskjold
as examples.
Get Priority
Horton said that students who are
eventually displaced by the new
programs will "for sure" get priority
elsewhere. The nature of the priority
has yet to be decided, he added.
Citing the 400 separate priorities
that were offered to 100
Olivo-Magnolia residents last year
when the black theme house was
relocated there, Horton said students
would receive "excellent and desirable
priorities."
Tim Peterson, resident assistant
(RA) at Terra House, expressed
concern about the lack of input from
residents of the houses under
consideration.
"There hasn't been any input from
us yet and that's why we're upset,' he
said.
Rifkin said the subcommittee had
decided it was "physically impossible
to talk to representatives from 26
houses at once."
Peterson said that Terra's priority
rating is not a true indication of its
popularity. "A co-op rating is not a
true indication of its popularity. A
co-op takes more of a commitment."
he said.

GRADE RECOMMENDATION--Alexander Fetter, chairman of C-AAA, said the
committee most likely would confirm its preliminary vote to reinstitute the D
grade, and not to restore an early drop deadline or recorded "no-credit" grades.
