# Moynihan+ Stanford= Neglect
## 
### 
The decision to invite Daniel Moynihan to
address the 1975 commencement should
come as no surprise to the brothers and
sisters insulted by the invitation. The
Moynihan choice brings into clear focus the
University's policy shift in its commitment to
minority students.
Moynihan is the man who advocated an
approach of "benign neglect" toward the
eradication of racism and injustice suffered
by black Americans, in a nation saturated
with race prejudice.
Moynihan wanted the federal government
to pursue "benign neglect" at the same time
that the Kerner Commission told America
that the number one problem in America was
white racism.
As a black freshman in 1971-72, I
experienced this "benign neglect" when
Stanford University failed to punish William
Shockley for refusing to teach an African
student in his class.
Veiled Hypocrisy
At that point I realized that if Shockley
could treat blacks this way without
reprimand it was possible for others to
manipulate the education of blacks as well, in
other ways. It became clear that the
University's definition of academic freedom
was nothing more than veiled hypocrisy.
' This year, Cedric X, a black professor who
debated Shockley's theories in a public
forum in Mem Aud two years ago, was

denied tenure. Black faculty tenure continues
to remain at a low level.
Black admissions have been on the decline
for the past several years, and now we find
that a University memo from Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs to
Director of Financial Aid Robert Huff urges
the selection of minority students "attuned
to the elitist ... nature of the institution,"
i.e., "The natives are getting restless, Bwana."
Pervasive Strategy
Now the strategy of benign neglect is
being applied to financial aid to minority
students. Sure we're in a depression, but who
has been hit the hardest? Who has always
been hit the hardest? Blacks.
Look at black unemployment in relation
to the national figure. The difference is
staggering. If you follow administration logic
you would believe that everything was equal,
"across the board."
In addition, the University fails to
recognize the problem of adjustment facing
the minority student. As a black freshman, I
found it hard to adjust to a University which
allowed a professor to discriminate against a
student because of his race, my race.
The 'Indians'
Imagine the reaction of native American
students arriving on the "Farm" only to
discover their ethnicity dragged to low depths
by elitists who fielded teams nicknamed
"Indians." How does a chicano feel when he

sees people chugging Gallo wine and eating
scab grapes and lettuce? Add to this the
realization of the Hoover Institution's
research on/in the Third World and the last
piece of the puzzle fits into place.
Culture shock does exist at Stanford. It
has always existed in this nation built upon
native American genocide and black slave
labor. It's time, as James Brown says, for the
"payback."
31ack protests in the last decade not only
began to open America up to blacks and
other minorities, but gave impetus to the
women's liberation struggle as well.
After the murder of Dr. Martin Luther
King in 1968, Stanford saw the handwriting
on the wall and announced a firm
commitment to minority admissions. This
commitment included substantial financial
aid to the minority matriculant in order to
help him/her meet the challenge of that first
year in a highly competitive major white
university. However, as I have pointed out,
the pendulum has now swung back with the
implementation of Moynihanian "benign
neglect."
Thus, Moynihan's appearance before
distinguished faculty, proud parents, and
anxious seniors, brown, yellow, black, and
white alike will, "with all deliberate speed,"
christen the return to "benign neglect."
