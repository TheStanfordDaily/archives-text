# Elijah Muhammad--Power Corrupts
## 
### Stephen Carter 
With the death of Elijah Muhammad at
the beginning of the week, the black
community and America as a whole have lost
one of the most colorful, controversial and
powerful figures of the 20th century.
Muhammad, as spiritual leader of an
estimated 100,000 members of the Nation of
Islam in this country, wielded great —
perhaps absolute — power over them. "All
Muslims are number two — after Mr.
Muhammad," Malcolm X once said.
Under Muhammad's leadership, the
Nation of Islam grew from a single temple
erected in Detroit in 1934 to a thriving,
profitable enterprise, with 79 temples in 70
cities.
That the Nation has done much to help
black America is, of course, undeniable.
Improved health care, education and
nutrition for many blacks all across the
country have been among its achievements.
But both the Nation and Muhammad
himself have long been centers of
controversy. Through its official publication,
Muhammad Speaks, the Nation of Islam has
regularly denounced white people as
"devils," and has attacked the white power
structure.
Nation Is Big Business
An investigation by the New York Times,
however, revealed some years ago that the
Nation has grown into a multi-million dollar
enterprise, which could not exist
independent of the American capitalist
structure. Muhammad employed white
people in managerial positions in many of his
numerous business ventures. And W.D. Fard,
the man Muhammad said he followed, and
who founded the original Temple of Islam in
Detroit, was white.
There have been other apparent
contradictions between Muhammad's
teachings and his actions. He preached
austerity, but his own home was a 19-room

mansion in the fashionable Hyde Park area of
Chicago. In the early 19605, he recuperated
from illness in similar quarters in Phoenix.
The sect taught chastity — but in July
1963, two former secretaries brought
paternity suits against Muhammad, then in
his late 60s. According to Malcolm X, when
confronted with these charges, Muhammad
calmly replied:

"I'm David. When you read about how
David took another man's wife, I'm that
David. You read about Noah, who got drunk
— that's me. You read about Lot, who went
and laid up with his own daughters. I have to
fulfill all of those things."
Faith Wavered
Later, Malcolm's own faith in the Muslims
began to waver. A vital reason for this, he
explained in his autobiography, was "that
Mr. Muhammad, instead of facing what he
had done before his followers, as a human
weakness or as fulfillment of prophecy —
which I sincerely believe that Muslims would
have understood, or at least they would have
accepted — Mr. Muhammad had, instead,
been willing to hide, to cover up what he had
done.
"That was the major blow."
In his later years, Malcolm was convinced
that the Nation that Muhammad himself —

had passed the sentence of death upon him.
In 1964, he was indeed shot to death at a
rally in New York City, in what
commentators still call "sectarian
squabbling."
Not only Malcolm X, but many other
black Americans as well, made pilgrimages to
Mecca, and returned with the conviction that
Muhammad's version of Islam was a far cry
from the real thing.
Yet the black Muslims in America remain
strong, and have been gaining, both in
economic strength and in numbers, in recent
years. In many areas, the Nation of Islam
seems to have succeeded where the rhetoric
of militancy failed.
Hard To Fight
Shrouded in secrecy and preaching
separatism, the Muslims have always been
hard for the white man to fight. So where a
Stokely Carmichael or Huey Newton might
make a comment which others can pounce
on and label "militant," the Nation has been
more cautious.
Muslims stand on street corners selling
copies of Muhammad Speaks, and soliciting
donations and assistance. Their dress is clean
and neat, their manners impeccable, except,
occasionally, when a black brother or sister
refuses to see the light.
Unable to pierce the secrecy or seize on
the rhetoric as truly inflammatory, the white
power structure has allowed the Muslims to
grow strong. Muhammad undoubtedly
foresaw all this in his planning, which
demonstrates his political acumen.
That he chose to turn such a powerful
and, to a great extent, benevolent
organization to personal profit only serves to
show again what a person really must do to
come to power in this society.
