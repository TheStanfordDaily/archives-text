# UFW Versus Gallo
## 
### 
Anne Loftis

In the Feb. 19 Daily, Steven
Westly suggested that the United
Farm Workers (UFW) should be
organizing non-union farm
workers rather than boycotting
Gallo.
This statement ignores UFW's
long connection with Gallo as well
as the importance of Gallo's
position as the dominant
company in the wine industry of
the nation's largest agricultural
state.
Gallo's several hundred farm
workers were covered by two
successive UFW contracts from
1967 to 1973, during which time
the union's ranch committees
insisted that the terms of the
contract be followed by the
company. In 1972, workers at the
Livingston vineyards under
contract initiated a strike to gain
access to time sheets showing
rates of pay which varied
according to whether the grape
crop was full or sparse.
It was perhaps because of its
experience with the aggressive
action of the UFW on behalf of its
members that the Gallo
management, while ostensibly
negotiating with the UFW for the
renewal of the contract in the
spring of 1973, permitted
Teamster organizers to come onto
the Livingston ranch and gave
them access to files of workers'
names and addresses.
The UFW withdrew from the
negotiations in protest and
announced a strike, whereupon
Gallo accepted petitions from an
alleged majority of its workers
asking for Teamster
representation. Yet three months
later when a Los Angeles Times
reporter visited Livingston, he
found veteran Gallo employees on
the picket line, both Portuguese
and Mexican, who also claimed to
represent a majority of the
workers.
"I'm not angry at the
company," said one crew
supervisor who had been with
Gallo six years, "but we strikers
want to show them that if they
don't want Chavez, we don't want
the Teamsters" (Times, Sept. 23,
1972).
The strike at most could halt
the harvesting of the ?rapes Gallo
grows itself, less than 10 percent
of the total used in the
production of their wine.
The UFW therefore turned to
its most effective weapon, the
nationwide boycott, to fight the
Teamsters' incursion into their
territory. If the UFW can win
back its Gallo contract, it will be
in a position to negotiate with
Gallo's suppliers as well.

Gallo.
This statement ignores UFW's
long connection with Gallo as well
as the importance of Gallo's
position as the dominant
company in the wine industry of
the nation's largest agricultural
state.
Gallo's several hundred farm
workers were covered by two
successive UFW contracts from
1967 to 1973, during which time
the union's ranch committees
insisted that the terms of the
contract be followed by the
company. In 1972, workers at the
Livingston vineyards under
contract initiated a strike to gain
access to time sheets showing
rates of pay which varied
according to whether the grape
crop was full or sparse.
It was perhaps because of its
experience with the aggressive
action of the UFW on behalf of its
members that the Gallo
management, while ostensibly
negotiating with the UFW for the
renewal of the contract in the
spring of 1973, permitted
Teamster organizers to come onto
the Livingston ranch and gave
them access to files of workers'
names and addresses.
The UFW withdrew from the
negotiations in protest and
announced a strike, whereupon
Gallo accepted petitions from an
alleged majority of its workers
asking for Teamster
representation. Yet three months
later when a Los Angeles Times
reporter visited Livingston, he
found veteran Gallo employees on
the picket line, both Portuguese
and Mexican, who also claimed to
represent a majority of the
workers.
"I'm not angry at the
company," said one crew
supervisor who had been with
Gallo six years, "but we strikers
want to show them that if they
don't want Chavez, we don't want
the Teamsters" (Times, Sept. 23,
1972).
The strike at most could halt
the harvesting of the ?rapes Gallo
grows itself, less than 10 percent
of the total used in the
production of their wine.
The UFW therefore turned to
its most effective weapon, the
nationwide boycott, to fight the
Teamsters' incursion into their
territory. If the UFW can win
back its Gallo contract, it will be
in a position to negotiate with
Gallo's suppliers as well.
