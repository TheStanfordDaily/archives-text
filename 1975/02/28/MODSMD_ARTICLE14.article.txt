Cheap Shot
Editor:
Dave Robinson's cheap attacks
on Oregon coach Dick Harter's
personal behavior (Daily, Feb. 26)
are no less "dirty" than the brand
of basketball he accuses Harter of
coaching.
Robinson should be ejected for
such a flagrant foul.

Praise For Gibbs
I would like to give Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs a vote of confidence for the
years and effort he has invested in
building undergraduate education
at Stanford.
One can disagree with any one
of his specific decisions during
this time of budget tightening, but
there should be no confusion as to
his basic commitment to the

needs of undergraduate education
and his integrity.

Whites And Self-Help
Editor:
In order to explain cultural
shock, a group of students
interrupted dinner at Branner Hall
Monday night with a skit showing
a "typical anglo" and a "typical
minority student." This skit
portrayed white students as
socially and economically naive,
and Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs as deaf to
minority students' "special needs."
After the skit, Branner residents
were invited to discuss the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
(C-UAFA) proposal in the lounge.
Some whites could not attend
the discussion because they had to
work to fulfill their self-help
requirement.
Perhaps there would be some
better opportunity for working
white students to speak with some
"adjusting" minority students on
this subject.

Compact Cities
Editor:
I was astonished to read the
article "Compact Cities..." in the
Feb. 20 Daily. The whole idea of
a compact city has been conceived
by George B. Dantzig of the
Operations Research Department.
Furthermore, Dantzig is the
co-author (with T.L. Saaty) of the
book Compact City, published in
1973.
However, your reporter does
not bother at all to mention
Dantzig's name. On the contrary,
his article conveys the impression
that Oliver Yu spoke about his

own concept. The article distorts
the truth, denies Dantzig credit
for his work, and puts Yu in a
rather embarassing position.

Hasty Quorum
Editor:
We wish to express our
objections to the process of
deciding today's Daily
endorsements, whereby a
"quorum" of Editorial Board
members was hurriedly assembled
and then allowed to disperse.
We do not consider the
resultant endorsements, approved
by less than one-seventh of the
members, to be reflective of the
sentiments of the Editorial Board.

Editorial Board Members
(Editor's note: These Edit Board
members are well aware that very
few of the Daily's editorials are
actually voted on by a majority of
the Editorial Board. Our
long-standing policy has been that
editorials are voted on by those
members of the Edit Board who
have sufficient interest in the
matter to show up at the meeting.
The only reason a quorom was at
all necessary at Wednesday's
meeting was that it was a special
meeting at an irregular time. In
fact, only one of these five
members bothered to show up for
the meeting.)
