# How Can Student Opinions Be Best Voiced?
## Ramming Through Referenda 
### TIM FERGUSON 
A two-day referendum on University
grading policies this week raised questions
about the propriety of this and other mass
opinion polls of the student body.
Opponents of the recommendations of the
Ad Hoc Panel to Study the Grading System
approached members of the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP) some weeks ago about the
possibility of a referendum on the issue,
according to ASSU Vice President Quinn
Mayer.
The opponents, led by senior Andy Hsi,
were referred to the ASSU Senate. By a bare
6-5 margin, the Senate approved the request
for a special election which costs the students
from $350 to $400.
Hsi then asked Mayer to finance a publicity
campaign on behalf of Hsi's cause with money
from the COP discretionary fund.
Mayer allocated $25 to Hsi, insisting that
the purpose of the gift was merely to instill
sufficient interest in the student body to
avoid an under-20 percent turnout like the
one at the Live Oak/Record Co-op fee
assessment vote earlier this year.
No Favoritism
Mayer says the money would have been
available to advocates from either side, but
only one side approached him.
"My interest was in getting people
involved," Mayer states. "If we're going to
be spending $400 to get people involved, the
marginal cost of $25 to publicize it is pretty
low."
Mayer's fellow COP members thought it
was pretty high, however — about $25 too
high—and they didn't warm to the idea of
aiding one side in the grading fight.
Mindful Of Commitment
Mayer revoked the COP's financial gift but,
mindful of his commitment to Hsi, picked up
the $25 tab out of his own pocket. Hsi's
group later went on to spend an additional
$20 to urge students to vote "no" on all the
Ad Hoc Committee's proposals.
The result was a decidedly one-sided
campaign, reflected in yesterday's vote. The
whole affair prompted apprehension over the

legitimacy of all student referenda.
If student opposition to stricter grading
standards was assumed prior to the vote (as it
was by many campus observers, including
ASSU President Mike Herman), what purpose
did the $400 expenditure serve, other than to
further Hsi's cause? A similar question was
asked by University President Richard Lyman
last year after a referendum on the emeritus
housing project.
Student Input
Herman defends this week's referendum
because "there was reasonable assurance that
[the] committee [on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA)] wanted to hear
student input" on the issue.
But a preliminary vote by the C-AAA
announced yesterday indicated that it was not
waiting with baited breath for the referendum
results.
But the issue raised by this referendum
goes deeper: what are the limits on hauling
any campus issue before the voters at $400 a
shot?
Mature Senate
The answer, according to Herman, is a
mature ASSU Senate. The Dean of Student
Affairs' Office provides the ASSU with enough
money to conduct two major (COP and
Senate) and three minor elections each year.
Given such a constraint, the Senate must
exercise a judgment on the worth of each
referendum brought to it.
Herman urges that referenda be judged on
two criteria: what they will prove and
whether they will change anything.
The result: more judgments. If a line has
been drawn against an influx of referenda, it
isn't very visible.
As Herman points out, a vote like the one
this week "is a hassle, it's expensive, it's
time-consuming and I don't particularly know
if students enjoy voting on things twice a
year."
They may not, nor may they like the
one-sided campaign they saw this week. But
there's nothing to stop them being witness to
more such goings-on in the future.

"My interest was in getting people
involved," Mayer states. "If we're going to
be spending $400 to get people involved, the
marginal cost of $25 to publicize it is pretty
low."
Mayer's fellow COP members thought it
was pretty high, however — about $25 too
high—and they didn't warm to the idea of
aiding one side in the grading fight.
Mindful Of Commitment
Mayer revoked the COP's financial gift but,
mindful of his commitment to Hsi, picked up
the $25 tab out of his own pocket. Hsi's
group later went on to spend an additional
$20 to urge students to vote "no" on all the
Ad Hoc Committee's proposals.
The result was a decidedly one-sided
campaign, reflected in yesterday's vote. The
whole affair prompted apprehension over the

legitimacy of all student referenda.
If student opposition to stricter grading
standards was assumed prior to the vote (as it
was by many campus observers, including
ASSU President Mike Herman), what purpose
did the $400 expenditure serve, other than to
further Hsi's cause? A similar question was
asked by University President Richard Lyman
last year after a referendum on the emeritus
housing project.
Student Input
Herman defends this week's referendum
because "there was reasonable assurance that
[the] committee [on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA)] wanted to hear
student input" on the issue.
But a preliminary vote by the C-AAA
announced yesterday indicated that it was not
waiting with baited breath for the referendum
results.
But the issue raised by this referendum
goes deeper: what are the limits on hauling
any campus issue before the voters at $400 a
shot?
Mature Senate
The answer, according to Herman, is a
mature ASSU Senate. The Dean of Student
Affairs' Office provides the ASSU with enough
money to conduct two major (COP and
Senate) and three minor elections each year.
Given such a constraint, the Senate must
exercise a judgment on the worth of each
referendum brought to it.
Herman urges that referenda be judged on
two criteria: what they will prove and
whether they will change anything.
The result: more judgments. If a line has
been drawn against an influx of referenda, it
isn't very visible.
As Herman points out, a vote like the one
this week "is a hassle, it's expensive, it's
time-consuming and I don't particularly know
if students enjoy voting on things twice a
year."
They may not, nor may they like the
one-sided campaign they saw this week. But
there's nothing to stop them being witness to
more such goings-on in the future.

A two-day referendum on University
grading policies this week raised questions
about the propriety of this and other mass
opinion polls of the student body.
Opponents of the recommendations of the
Ad Hoc Panel to Study the Grading System
approached members of the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP) some weeks ago about the
possibility of a referendum on the issue,
according to ASSU Vice President Quinn
Mayer.
The opponents, led by senior Andy Hsi,
were referred to the ASSU Senate. By a bare
6-5 margin, the Senate approved the request
for a special election which costs the students
from $350 to $400.
Hsi then asked Mayer to finance a publicity
campaign on behalf of Hsi's cause with money
from the COP discretionary fund.
Mayer allocated $25 to Hsi, insisting that
the purpose of the gift was merely to instill
sufficient interest in the student body to
avoid an under-20 percent turnout like the
one at the Live Oak/Record Co-op fee
assessment vote earlier this year.
No Favoritism
Mayer says the money would have been
available to advocates from either side, but
only one side approached him.
"My interest was in getting people
involved," Mayer states. "If we're going to
be spending $400 to get people involved, the
marginal cost of $25 to publicize it is pretty
low."
