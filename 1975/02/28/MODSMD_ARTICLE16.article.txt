# $12,000 Idle While Political Prisoners Entice Board On Guest Professorship
## 
### BONNY RODDEN 
Nearly $12,000 sits unused in the ASSU
guest professorship account. And no wonder.
Last spring students voted a $1 fee
assessment to bring "important political and
social figures to teach on campus," according
to an April 3, 1974 Daily article.
However, the political and social figures
the ASSU Guest Professorship Board has
inivited here have all ended up being political
prisoners.
Nguyen Huu Thai, the Board's initial
choice, was in jail when he was invited to
take the guest professorship post here.
Subsequently released, he was still forbidden
to leave the country.
Hermann Schwember, invited to Stanford
after Thai's prospects looked bleak, is a

Chilean scholar who was held prisoner during
the 1973 military coup in Chile. As he was
arranging to leave Chile to fill the post, he
was arrested again.
Another Chilean prisoner, economist
Fergio Bitar, had been considered before
Schwember was chosen as the guest professor
candidate.
Thai was unable to extricate himself
from the political bindings of his country.
Schwember is up against a different obstacle.
Although Chile has been releasing some
political prisoners, Political Science Prof.
Richard Fagen fears that the U.S. might
delay granting Schwember an entry visa if
Schwember managed to be freed.
A delay in getting his entry visa could

force Schwember to go to another country.
"The hopes [of Schwember coming here) are
dimming again," Fagen said.
Board member Kevin O'Grady doubted
the University would have a guest professor
this year.
"We didn't want to rush out and spend
the money" on a less desirable guest, he j
explained.
The question remains: exactly what is a
desirable guest? If people teetering on the
edge of military government prison walls
continue to entice the Board, students may
wait a long time for a desirable guest.
And while the students stand by the
$12,000 "just stays there waiting for a guest
professor," ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri said.
