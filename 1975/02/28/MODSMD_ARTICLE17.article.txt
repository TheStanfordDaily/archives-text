# Financial Aid Protests Cause Delayed Decision
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If three relatively successful
demonstrations in one week have whetted
your appetite for a return to the days of
student activism, be prepared to go hungry for
awhile.
At least three factors — a narrow
ideological base for protest, the
pre-professionalism of most students and the
cathartic effect of Watergate — imply that the
time is not ripe for a 60s-style radical
movement.
At Tuesday's demonstration, during which
350 people protested cutbacks in minority
financial aid, it seemed clear that the system
itself was not being threatened.
Charles Ogletree, a leader of the Students
for Equity group, presented President
Lyman's office with a very modest list of
demands. All Ogletree asked for was
re-evaluation of the financial aid cutbacks and
inclusion of Asian-Americans as a minority
group.

Granted, these demands aren't ones Lyman
will immediately accede to when he meets
with Students for Equity leaders today. But as
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said in an
interview Wednesday, minority aid and
SWOPSI cutback "protests are at a low level."
Deans' Rights
"Nobody has spoken about what right
deans have to define undergraduate education.
These protests haven't gotten much beyond
asking the University to slightly reallocate
resources," Bernstein, who has studied radical
movements, said.
This doesn't imply that the protests have
been meaningless. In fact, while the University
probably wouldn't admit it, its delay in
chopping undergraduate programs and
willingness to compromise on minority
financial aid are probably direct results of
student protest.
And the more protest, the more delay and
compromise. That's how power games work.
Ogletree, who's turned into a charismatic
leader in the fight to save minority aid
privileges, told the protesters Tuesday "We've
got to keep the ball rolling." And perhaps
Students for Equity and other groups, such ,as
the Alliance for Radical Change, can do so,
when addressing specific issues.
But students don't seem interested in
massively protesting the system from either
the left or right. This basically anti-political
feeling is partially due to the increasing
numbers of students who devote their time to
studying for careers, Bernstein speculates.
Watergate's Cathartic Effect
Bernstein also mentions the cathartic effect
of Watergate in restoring people's confidence
in the system. Students are satisfied now to
confine the boundaries of protest to the
framework of the existing system.
"Watergate has restored the confidence of
many people who wanted their confidence
restored. Most of the complaints now are
personalized comments about Mr. Ford.
There's a belief that a change in occupants
will produce a change in politics."
What circumstances, then, will change the
mood of those persons with latent tendencies
toward radical change? It's hard to see them
at this point.
Bernstein notes that students are not really
concerned with either the demise of the
Allende government in Chile or the continuing
war in Vietnam. It's doubtful that Stanford's
involvement with the Iranian government,
minority financial aid, program cutbacks,
farmworker struggles or any other issue
present on the scene will prove the catalyst
for new radical change.
But then, Bernstein says, people didn't
really see the early 60s civil rights movement
as being a catalyst, either. The issue that will
set the Farm afire again may already have
started to smolder.

massively protesting the system from either
the left or right. This basically anti-political
feeling is partially due to the increasing
numbers of students who devote their time to
studying for careers, Bernstein speculates.
Watergate's Cathartic Effect
Bernstein also mentions the cathartic effect
of Watergate in restoring people's confidence
in the system. Students are satisfied now to
confine the boundaries of protest to the
framework of the existing system.
"Watergate has restored the confidence of
many people who wanted their confidence
restored. Most of the complaints now are
personalized comments about Mr. Ford.
There's a belief that a change in occupants
will produce a change in politics."
What circumstances, then, will change the
mood of those persons with latent tendencies
toward radical change? It's hard to see them
at this point.
Bernstein notes that students are not really
concerned with either the demise of the
Allende government in Chile or the continuing
war in Vietnam. It's doubtful that Stanford's
involvement with the Iranian government,
minority financial aid, program cutbacks,
farmworker struggles or any other issue
present on the scene will prove the catalyst
for new radical change.
But then, Bernstein says, people didn't
really see the early 60s civil rights movement
as being a catalyst, either. The issue that will
set the Farm afire again may already have
started to smolder.
If three relatively successful
demonstrations in one week have whetted
your appetite for a return to the days of
student activism, be prepared to go hungry for
awhile.
At least three factors — a narrow
ideological base for protest, the
pre-professionalism of most students and the
cathartic effect of Watergate — imply that the
time is not ripe for a 60s-style radical
movement.
At Tuesday's demonstration, during which
350 people protested cutbacks in minority
financial aid, it seemed clear that the system
itself was not being threatened.
Charles Ogletree, a leader of the Students
for Equity group, presented President
Lyman's office with a very modest list of
demands. All Ogletree asked for was
re-evaluation of the financial aid cutbacks and
inclusion of Asian-Americans as a minority
group.

Granted, these demands aren't ones Lyman
will immediately accede to when he meets
with Students for Equity leaders today. But as
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said in an
interview Wednesday, minority aid and
SWOPSI cutback "protests are at a low level."
Deans' Rights
"Nobody has spoken about what right
deans have to define undergraduate education.
These protests haven't gotten much beyond
asking the University to slightly reallocate
resources," Bernstein, who has studied radical
movements, said.
This doesn't imply that the protests have
been meaningless. In fact, while the University
probably wouldn't admit it, its delay in
chopping undergraduate programs and
willingness to compromise on minority
financial aid are probably direct results of
student protest.
And the more protest, the more delay and
compromise. That's how power games work.
Ogletree, who's turned into a charismatic
leader in the fight to save minority aid
privileges, told the protesters Tuesday "We've
got to keep the ball rolling." And perhaps
Students for Equity and other groups, such ,as
the Alliance for Radical Change, can do so,
when addressing specific issues.
But students don't seem interested in
massively protesting the system from either
the left or right. This basically anti-political
feeling is partially due to the increasing
numbers of students who devote their time to
studying for careers, Bernstein speculates.
