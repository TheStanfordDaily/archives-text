# Brown Bumps Briefcases

SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” Forty thousand briefcases are enough,
Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. said Wednesday as he ordered a halt in
the distribution of free briefcases to state employees.
Brown said a long-standing policy of issuing attache cases and
briefcases to state bureaucrats only encourages "the blizzard of
state paperwork."
"Too often, I find that the volume of paper expands to fill the
available briefcases," Brown said.
He said 40,000 state-issued briefcases and attache cases are
now in use, and 6142 more cases, ranging in value from $18.05 to
$38.15 each, are on hand in state supplyrooms.
Brown said those cases would be sold at cost to employees
who feel they need them, and then the state "will get out of the
briefcase business." He said there would be no recall of briefcases
previously issued to state bureaucrats.
