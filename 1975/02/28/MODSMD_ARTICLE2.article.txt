# Palo Alto School Board
## Candidates Stress Budget Issues 
### DON LINDEMANN Last of Three Parts 
Opposing Jean Amick and June
Genis in Tuesday's Palo Alto Unified
School District trustee election are
Joshua Goldstein and Robert Taylor.
The winner of the race will serve a
five-year term as an unpaid Board
member.
* * *
Joshua Goldstein, a 22-year-old in
the Stanford Institute of Political
Studies, is the only candidate to
previously have run for the school
board. In last year's election he was
runner-up to Royce Cole, polling 32
percent of the vote.
Goldstein, also the only candidate
educated in Palo Alto schools,
attended Stanford and worked as a
teacher in a child care center for one
year. He helped organize the Sangha
food cooperative in College Terrace as
well as a community garden, and he
serves on the advisory committee of
Ohlone (Palo Alto's "alternative"
school).
Goldstein, who favors passage of the
revenue limit increase measure, says it
will facilitate a gradual reduction of
the school district budget.
An opponent of high
teacher/student ratios, Goldstein
favors cuts in administration and
operational costs rather than teaching
positions. While acknowledging that
"employees will undoubtedly have to
settle for less than cost-of-living salary
increases this year," he advocates "a
sliding scale that cuts back the lowest
salaries proportionately less than the
highest."
He also supports the closing of one
junior high school (consolidating
seventh and eighth grades in the two
remaining schools). But he has been a
strong proponent of the neighborhood
elementary schools, saying that the
increasing number of empty
classrooms should be turned into
community centers for senior citizen
programs, child care and adult
education—operating alongside regular
school activities.
He claims this "would help end the
isolation of each age group, enrich the
children's education and generate
additional revenue to keep
neighborhood schools open."
Goldstein advocates a strong school
board that seeks input from the

community at large to develop District
policies.
Specifically, he proposes
mini-school boards of teachers, parents
and students at each school. These
boards should be involved in
"mainstream decision making," he
says, not just advisory functions.
* * *
Robert Taylor, 51, is the only
professional educator among the
candidates. The holder of a Stanford
M.A. degree in education, he has been
a school principal in Los Altos for 17
years and is a past president in the Los
Altos Kiwanis Club.
Taylor is basing his campaign on his
knowledge of how to deal with school
budgetary problems.
"We must keep a viable school
district in a period of financial chaos,"
says Taylor, who favors the revenue

measure. He stresses the need for
long-term enrollment projections to
guide plans for school reorganization
and possible closures.
Taylor believes that parents are
more interested in being able to
choose a certain kind of education for
their children — "open classroom" vs.
more traditional structures — than in
having a neighborhood school. Thus he
has advocated the closing of some
neighborhood schools and allowing
district-wide open enrollment at the
remaining ones.
"I've gone through the experience
of closing a couple of schools, "says
Taylor. "My education and knowledge
in school finance, curriculum and
organization patterns would be of aid
to help preserve or improve as much of
the Palo Alto School District's
program as possible."

operational costs rather than teaching
positions. While acknowledging that
"employees will undoubtedly have to
settle for less than cost-of-living salary
increases this year," he advocates "a
sliding scale that cuts back the lowest
salaries proportionately less than the
highest."
He also supports the closing of one
junior high school (consolidating
seventh and eighth grades in the two
remaining schools). But he has been a
strong proponent of the neighborhood
elementary schools, saying that the
increasing number of empty
classrooms should be turned into
community centers for senior citizen
programs, child care and adult
education—operating alongside regular
school activities.
He claims this "would help end the
isolation of each age group, enrich the
children's education and generate
additional revenue to keep
neighborhood schools open."
Goldstein advocates a strong school
board that seeks input from the

community at large to develop District
policies.
Specifically, he proposes
mini-school boards of teachers, parents
and students at each school. These
boards should be involved in
"mainstream decision making," he
says, not just advisory functions.

Robert Taylor, 51, is the only
professional educator among the
candidates. The holder of a Stanford
M.A. degree in education, he has been
a school principal in Los Altos for 17
years and is a past president in the Los
Altos Kiwanis Club.
Taylor is basing his campaign on his
knowledge of how to deal with school
budgetary problems.
"We must keep a viable school
district in a period of financial chaos,"
says Taylor, who favors the revenue

measure. He stresses the need for
long-term enrollment projections to
guide plans for school reorganization
and possible closures.
Taylor believes that parents are
more interested in being able to
choose a certain kind of education for
their children — "open classroom" vs.
more traditional structures — than in
having a neighborhood school. Thus he
has advocated the closing of some
neighborhood schools and allowing
district-wide open enrollment at the
remaining ones.
"I've gone through the experience
of closing a couple of schools, "says
Taylor. "My education and knowledge
in school finance, curriculum and
organization patterns would be of aid
to help preserve or improve as much of
the Palo Alto School District's
program as possible."
Opposing Jean Amick and June
Genis in Tuesday's Palo Alto Unified
School District trustee election are
Joshua Goldstein and Robert Taylor.
The winner of the race will serve a
five-year term as an unpaid Board
member.

Joshua Goldstein, a 22-year-old in
the Stanford Institute of Political
Studies, is the only candidate to
previously have run for the school
board. In last year's election he was
runner-up to Royce Cole, polling 32
percent of the vote.
Goldstein, also the only candidate
educated in Palo Alto schools,
attended Stanford and worked as a
teacher in a child care center for one
year. He helped organize the Sangha
food cooperative in College Terrace as
well as a community garden, and he
serves on the advisory committee of
Ohlone (Palo Alto's "alternative"
school).
Goldstein, who favors passage of the
revenue limit increase measure, says it
will facilitate a gradual reduction of
the school district budget.
An opponent of high
teacher/student ratios, Goldstein
favors cuts in administration and
operational costs rather than teaching
positions. While acknowledging that
"employees will undoubtedly have to
settle for less than cost-of-living salary
increases this year," he advocates "a
