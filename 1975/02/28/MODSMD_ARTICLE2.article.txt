Joshua Goldstein, a 22-year-old in
the Stanford Institute of Political
Studies, is the only candidate to
previously have run for the school
board. In last year's election he was
runner-up to Royce Cole, polling 32
percent of the vote.
Goldstein, also the only candidate
educated in Palo Alto schools,
attended Stanford and worked as a
teacher in a child care center for one
year. He helped organize the Sangha
food cooperative in College Terrace as
well as a community garden, and he
serves on the advisory committee of
Ohlone (Palo Alto's "alternative"
school).
Goldstein, who favors passage of the
revenue limit increase measure, says it
will facilitate a gradual reduction of
the school district budget.
An opponent of high
teacher/student ratios, Goldstein
favors cuts in administration and
operational costs rather than teaching
positions. While acknowledging that
"employees will undoubtedly have to
settle for less than cost-of-living salary
increases this year," he advocates "a
sliding scale that cuts back the lowest
salaries proportionately less than the
highest."
He also supports the closing of one
junior high school (consolidating
seventh and eighth grades in the two
remaining schools). But he has been a
strong proponent of the neighborhood
elementary schools, saying that the
increasing number of empty
classrooms should be turned into
community centers for senior citizen
programs, child care and adult
education—operating alongside regular
school activities.
He claims this "would help end the
isolation of each age group, enrich the
children's education and generate
additional revenue to keep
neighborhood schools open."
Goldstein advocates a strong school
board that seeks input from the
