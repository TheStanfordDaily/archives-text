# Pub Board Grants Funds To 'Chappy'
## 
### PETER KREKTZMAN 
The Stanford Chaparral will
publish at least once more this
year as the result of Wednesday's
ASSU Publications Board
meeting.
The Pub Board agreed to grant
the Chaparral a $500 interest free
loan which will be payable in June
of this year. The loan will permit
the magazine to publish once
more in the form of a March 31
"Reg-Pack" issue.
The funding, approved
unanimously by the Board, was
proposed by Chappy editor and
Board member Mike Dornheim.
He maintained that such short

term financing would be needed,
since only $366 remains in the
publication's account.
Repayment of the loan would
occur, Dornheim said, with the
reception of the advertising
revenue from the issue. "We'll
certainly break even, and may
even make money," he said.
The Board also approved a
letter written by the Board to Ed
Shaw, executive assistant to the
provost, protesting the proposed
closing of Lomita Drive due to
construction of the Terman
Engineering Center.
Such a closing, according to
the letter, would severely cramp
operations at the Storke Student
Publications Building, home of
the Daily, the Quad, the Live Oak
and other publications.
The letter asked that Lomita
Drive remain open during
construction, with access from
Santa Teresa Street. Construction
is set to begin May 1.
Also at the meeting, it was
reported that Live Oak would be
resuming normal publication for
spring quarter, with "the only
change being in the staff box,"
according to Live Oak staff
member Bill Grueskin. Crueskin is
replacing Bill Weinstein, former
editor of the publication, on the
Pub Board.
The Board partially discussed
the standing rules of the
Publications Board, following a
presentation by Tim Portwood,
chairman of a subcommittee set
up to examine the Pub Board's
rules and bv-laws.
