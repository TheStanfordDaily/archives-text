# Employee Safety Record --'Excellent'
## 
### KAREN CAESAR 
The University's overall safety
record regarding employees has
been excellent, according to Jack
Sidlow, University health and
safety manager.
"We do have a very good
record," he continued. "We are
trying to be safety conscious."
He went on to say that "out of
the total picture of accidents at
Stanford, it is estimated that most
of them are due to lack of training
or poor employee attitude."
Only 10 percent are due to
unguarded revolving machinery
and electrical equipment or
inadequate ventilation, and only
two percent of the occupational
injuries are caused by so-called
"freak" accidents, Sidlow added.
During 1974 there were 66
cases of occupational injuries and

illnesses here, resulting in a total
of 544 lost workdays, Sidlow said.
In an additional 109 cases,
medical treatment beyond first
aid was required although no
workdays were lost.
First-Aid Accidents
"By and large most accidents
here are classified as first-aid like
cut fingers, pulled shoulders, etc.
We report them to keep in-house
records so the state can check up
on us. When they come to inspect,
the first thing they do is check the
records," Sidlow said.
The federal government
enforces certain standards
established under the
Occupational Health and Safety
Act (OSHA) of 1970.
The OSHA encompasses over
300 pages of legislation with
hundreds of specific rules and

regulations. In California, these
minimum federal standards are
supplemented by general industry
safety/codes which are often far
more stringent than the OSHA
rules.
100 Hazardous Conditions
About 100 hazardous
conditions were noted in one
recent state inspection at
Stanford, resulting in about 25
citations to the University. Oddly
enough, the building in
the agency created by OSHA was
cited for over 300 "hazardous
conditions." These can be
anything from ungrounded
electric typewriters to faulty
handrails.
University Plant Services
Director Jason Mavis said that
Stanford has had "citations
primarily having to do with steam

tunnels, and they are about to
undergo some pretty major
changes." These changes will cost
the University $100,000 and
should take from six to nine
months to accomplish, he said.
The problems with the steam
tunnels, which run from the steam
plant to University buildings,
under the Quad and across the
campus, "currently relate to work
space — adequate space around
pipes in which to work safely,"
said Mavis.
New manholes will be added
and existing ones enlarged.
Barricades will also be installed to
keep non-workers out of the work
area, Mavis added.
Wild Cats
"This should improve our wild
cat problem. We have a whole
population of them running
arounddownthere.. .. They are a
health hazard, and some are wild
enough to attack," he remarked.
There is a five-year program to
improve the "many, many, many
buildings that need work done,
such as plumbing changes and
electrical recircuiting. The long
range plan is to spend tens of
thousands of dollars each year to
improve all the older buildings of
the University.
"There is an expensive list of
things to accomplish, but there is
no critical urgency. Funds don't
have to be allotted all in one
year," Mavis noted.
The University has hired
medical consultants to determine
the "amount of heat stress a
worker can withstand and to
teach people who work in the
steam tunnels how to protect
themselves against heat stress,"
said Mavis.
Adequate Funds
"We have funding being given
to us each year that is adequate to
pursue a good program. I would
guess it would take a good five
years to take care of the problems
that we know about now," Mavis
stated.
Food Service head Maxine
Anderson, questioned about
kitchen conditions and frequency

of staff and hasher accidents, said,
"We're pretty safe. We keep a very
close track of ail OSHA
requirements."
Minor accidents (i.e. dropping
trays, tripping, etc.), do occur, she
said, but for the most part these
are not serious enough to require
medical attention.
Bob Beth, in charge of risk
management at Stanford, said,
"We are in the process of
identifying problems and
formulating time schedules for
voluntarily bringing the University
into compliance with OSHA."
He added that "our accident
rate is very commendable
compared with other universities
and with industry — six times
better than other universities, and
twice as good as industry."

"We're pretty safe. We keep a very
close track of ail OSHA
requirements."
Minor accidents (i.e. dropping
trays, tripping, etc.), do occur, she
said, but for the most part these
are not serious enough to require
medical attention.
Bob Beth, in charge of risk
management at Stanford, said,
"We are in the process of
identifying problems and
formulating time schedules for
voluntarily bringing the University
into compliance with OSHA."
He added that "our accident
rate is very commendable
compared with other universities
and with industry — six times
better than other universities, and
twice as good as industry."
The University's overall safety
record regarding employees has
been excellent, according to Jack
Sidlow, University health and
safety manager.
"We do have a very good
record," he continued. "We are
trying to be safety conscious."
He went on to say that "out of
the total picture of accidents at
Stanford, it is estimated that most
of them are due to lack of training
or poor employee attitude."
Only 10 percent are due to
unguarded revolving machinery
and electrical equipment or
inadequate ventilation, and only
two percent of the occupational
injuries are caused by so-called
"freak" accidents, Sidlow added.
During 1974 there were 66
cases of occupational injuries and

illnesses here, resulting in a total
of 544 lost workdays, Sidlow said.
In an additional 109 cases,
medical treatment beyond first
aid was required although no
workdays were lost.
First-Aid Accidents
"By and large most accidents
here are classified as first-aid like
cut fingers, pulled shoulders, etc.
We report them to keep in-house
records so the state can check up
on us. When they come to inspect,
the first thing they do is check the
records," Sidlow said.
The federal government
enforces certain standards
established under the
Occupational Health and Safety
Act (OSHA) of 1970.
The OSHA encompasses over
300 pages of legislation with
hundreds of specific rules and

regulations. In California, these
minimum federal standards are
supplemented by general industry
safety/codes which are often far
more stringent than the OSHA
rules.
100 Hazardous Conditions
About 100 hazardous
conditions were noted in one
recent state inspection at
Stanford, resulting in about 25
citations to the University. Oddly
enough, the building in
the agency created by OSHA was
cited for over 300 "hazardous
conditions." These can be
anything from ungrounded
electric typewriters to faulty
handrails.
University Plant Services
Director Jason Mavis said that
Stanford has had "citations
primarily having to do with steam

tunnels, and they are about to
undergo some pretty major
changes." These changes will cost
the University $100,000 and
should take from six to nine
months to accomplish, he said.
The problems with the steam
tunnels, which run from the steam
plant to University buildings,
under the Quad and across the
campus, "currently relate to work
space — adequate space around
pipes in which to work safely,"
said Mavis.
New manholes will be added
and existing ones enlarged.
Barricades will also be installed to
keep non-workers out of the work
area, Mavis added.
Wild Cats
"This should improve our wild
cat problem. We have a whole
population of them running
arounddownthere.. .. They are a
health hazard, and some are wild
enough to attack," he remarked.
There is a five-year program to
improve the "many, many, many
buildings that need work done,
such as plumbing changes and
electrical recircuiting. The long
range plan is to spend tens of
thousands of dollars each year to
improve all the older buildings of
the University.
"There is an expensive list of
things to accomplish, but there is
no critical urgency. Funds don't
have to be allotted all in one
year," Mavis noted.
The University has hired
medical consultants to determine
the "amount of heat stress a
worker can withstand and to
teach people who work in the
steam tunnels how to protect
themselves against heat stress,"
said Mavis.
Adequate Funds
"We have funding being given
to us each year that is adequate to
pursue a good program. I would
guess it would take a good five
years to take care of the problems
that we know about now," Mavis
stated.
Food Service head Maxine
Anderson, questioned about
kitchen conditions and frequency

of staff and hasher accidents, said,

have to be allotted all in one
year," Mavis noted.
The University has hired
medical consultants to determine
the "amount of heat stress a
worker can withstand and to
teach people who work in the
steam tunnels how to protect
themselves against heat stress,"
said Mavis.
Adequate Funds
"We have funding being given
to us each year that is adequate to
pursue a good program. I would
guess it would take a good five
years to take care of the problems
that we know about now," Mavis
stated.
Food Service head Maxine
Anderson, questioned about
kitchen conditions and frequency

of staff and hasher accidents, said,
"We're pretty safe. We keep a very
close track of ail OSHA
requirements."
Minor accidents (i.e. dropping
trays, tripping, etc.), do occur, she
said, but for the most part these
are not serious enough to require
medical attention.
Bob Beth, in charge of risk
management at Stanford, said,
"We are in the process of
identifying problems and
formulating time schedules for
voluntarily bringing the University
into compliance with OSHA."
He added that "our accident
rate is very commendable
compared with other universities
and with industry — six times
better than other universities, and
twice as good as industry."
