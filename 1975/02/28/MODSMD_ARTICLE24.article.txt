# Pullover Sweater Provokes State Assembly Controversy

SACRAMENTO (AP) — Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy says he won't try to bar Assemblyman
Ken Meade from wearing a pullover sweater on the
Assembly floor whenever he feels like it.
Meade, a 36-year-old Berkeley Democrat,
recently started showing up on the floor in a
pullover sweater — a move that broke the
Assembly's unwritten coat-and-tie rule for male
members.
"He can wear his pajamas on the floor if he
wishes," McCarthy (D-San Francisco) told
reporters Wednesday at his informal weekly news
conference when they repeatedly pressed him for
his opinion.
There is a point to dress decorum, however, said
McCarthy. He added he thinks male legislators
should at least wear coats on the floor.
"I think the capitol press corps probably would
have a reaction if we all showed up on the floor
wearing Mickey Mouse t-shirts," McCarthy said.
Rules Committee
At another news conference Wednesday, Meade,
a former University of California quarterback, said
he had heard a dress code was being considered by
the Assembly Rules Committee.
But Committee Chairman Leon Ralph, who first
spoke to Meade about his informal dress last week,
said his Committee was not considering a dress code

rule for male members.
"It's an absolute lie. He must be hallucinating,"
Ralph said of Meade, who started the flap last week
when he revealed some legislators had complained
about his attire.
Meade, who backed McCarthy's rival, Willie
Brown, in the speakership fight last year, said the
Rules Committee's concern about his dress was
typical of McCarthy's concern for "form over
substance."
Reporters were given copies of an open letter
Meade wrote to the Oakland Tribune. The letter
said in part:
Freedom
"At the heart of the matter, as I see it, is the
simple issue of freedom of choice, freedom of
expression, or just plain individual freedom which
should not be impinged upon."
If his constituents react favorably to his open
letter, Meade said, he will fight in the courts any
attempt by the Assembly to force him to wear a
coat and tie.
Meade's comments followed an Oakland Tribune
editorial Monday which said critics of Meade
"sound like a bunch of prep school headmasters."
The editorial also said Meade should wear a necktie.
"If we pass a dress code for the legislature, we
are only one step away from passing it for society,"
Meade warned.
