# 'Edges' Gives Science Fiction Angles
## 
### MARK SHAW 
Sci-fi buffs and fantasy freaks
will thrill to the birth of Edge, a
new science fiction-feature
magazine making its debut on the
Stanford literary scene this week.
Edge, which will be published
twice a quarter, features fiction,
reviews, and comics submitted by
students. Steve O'Hara, a
contributing editor for Edge, says,
"We draw from the community,
that is, the Bay Area, but we
prefer to publish articles from
Stanford students. We'd like to fill
a need for people to write. Edge is
designed for latent science fiction
and fantasy writers."
According to O'Hara, the
magazine started as a SCIRE
project, and the first issue will be

funded by SCIRE. But Editor
John Cardosi says, "We want to
become independent of outside
funding. We will start soliciting
advertising for the next issue and
hope to expand."
Edge, sporting a blue cover, is
available at the Stanford
Bookstore and Kepler's this week.
Edge will have a format similar
to such science fiction magazines
as Gafaxy, "We want anything
from Frankenstein to knights in
shining armor," Cardosi said. "We
want to encourage students to
experiment with science fiction
and fantasy, which we consider to
be increasingly essential parts of
our lives."
The magazine's self-proclaimed
purpose is to "shock, challenge.

amuse, and otherwise fry its
readers' minds," to "boldly go
where no man has gone before."
The first issue includes articles
in several areas, and is highlighted
by two fiction pieces, "Andrew"
and"The Wienawt War."
"Andrew" is a far-out fairy tale
about a small boy who is whisked
away by his kite to an Oz-like
land beyond the clouds, where he
falls in love with a princess, meets
God, and encounters Morris
Woody, a somewhat
out-of-the-ordinary firebreathing
dragon. The piece is a very clever
attempt at stream-of-conscious
ness fantasy.
"The Wienawt War" is an
ingenious, semi-political satire of a
future Earth written in a

humorous vein. Done in a
term-paper format (complete with
some pretty wild footnotes) it
deals with the role of Earth in an
interplanetary war with the
'Wienawts.' In accordance with
the magazine's intent, it is a satire
of human actions in fantasy form.
Also included in the issue are
several movie and book reviews,
including one on Arthur C.
Clarke's latest Rendezvous With
Rama, and two superb cartoons.
One of the cartoons, Robot I,
is done in classic comic book
form, and borrows somewhat from
the Questor Tapes, a Gene
Roddenberry film. The other,
Lance Laser, was originally
designed to be a radio program.
The next issue of Edge will be
prepared during Easter vacation,
and should be ready for students
during the first week of Spring
quarter. The editors hope to
include in it an interview with
Robert Silverberg, a well-known
science fiction writer in the area.
Silverberg is a former president
of Science Fiction Writers of
America and has won two Hugo
Awards for his works. He also
won the 1970 Nebula Award for
best short story of the year.
The editors hope to interview
other writers in the Bay Area and
promote films, lectures and books
in the realm of fantasy in future
issues.
