# Jenkins Company Explores Dance 'Interferences'
## 
### JANICE ROSS 
SAN FRANCISCO-
Philosophical speculation and
dance are two areas of human
activity that don't appear to have
much in common.
They don't, that is, unless you
happen to see Interferences, a
collaborative dance work by
choreographer Margaret Jenkins
and poet Michael Palmer, which
premiered last Friday night at
Jenkirs' San Francisco Studio.
Jenkins is a local dancer and
choreographer of unusual insight.
Her aesthetic sensibilities are very
much akin to those of her mentor
and dance colleague Merce
Cunningham.
Like Cunninghams', Jenkins'
art explores those amorphous
peripheries, the boundaries
between life and art. And like
Cunn : ngham, Jenkins recognizes
the problematical nature of their
interplay.
But rather than engaging in
metaphysical theorizing, Jenkins'
newest work, Interferences,
simply presents a contiguous
chain of visual and aural

occurrences for our
contemplation.
Slow Flux
Structurally, Interferences is an
hour-long piece consisting of the
constantly changing groupings,
energies and humors of twelve
dancers. Some phrases, and within
these phrases certain sequences,
repeat themselves, and others do
not.
Occasionally two, three, eight
or even 12 dancers may come
together for a brief unison
pattern; a stuttering step forward,
convulsively twitching shoulders,
frantically beating arms, and the
moment is past as each dancer is
reabsorbed into his own
kinesthetic reflections.
In choreographing her dances,
Jenkins borrows movements from
real life just as freely as she does
from the classical lexicons of
ballet and modern dance. Smiles,
stifled cries, tugs of readjustment
at one's leotards and tights, and
unexpected collisions all become
part of the ongoing activity of the
dance.
In one especially memorable

sequence Friday night, Jenkins,
Michelle Larsson and Patty Smith
stumbled, staggered, showed and
inexorably spilled themselves
across the stage in a comically
intertwined jumble of legs, arms
and heads.
At another point, a dancer
repeatedly pinned and unpinned
her hair with an air of
nonchalance, seemingly unaware
that she was the only one left
onstage.
In yet another sequence,
Jenkins enacted an incredible and
unrelenting medley of mundane
actions and dance movements.
She would accomplish a dazzling
sequence of rapid turns and
dramatic leaps and then casually
shrug her shoulders, readjust her
hair, and stroll to another part of
the performing space to begin
again.
False Finish
She did this several times and
each time with the same sense of
finality and commencement. The
effect of this sequence was to
force a reshuffling of our
expectations about beginnings,
middles and endings.
Jenkins shows us that dance,
like life, can be asyndetonic;
patterns and sequences need not
always be predictable and
successive.
Throughout Interferences there
was a continual panoply of
activities vying for our attention.
There were dancers "onstage" in
the center of the performing
space, waiting dancers warming up
or "marking it"on the sides of the
studio, and then there were the
members of the audience seated

around the perimeters of the
studio, all of whom became facets
of the dance.
Audience In
Here again Jenkins proved
trenchant. Studio performances
have always presented a special
problem because of their
paradoxical informality and
ceremoniousness. But in
Interferences Jenkins cleverly
incorporates the audience so that
we are drawn into the action.
When one has to move one's
feet in order to let the dancers
pass, or when a sweating, panting

dancer reclines nearby between
sections, one can't help but feel a
part of the activity.
In this way the dance becomes
a mutual event; it transcends the
limited participant-viewer
dialectic, and vivifies our whole
notion of performance. As
audience we are engaged in a
process of becoming with the
dancers and this in itself is a work
of genius.
The final two performances of
Interferences will be March 2 and
9 at Jenkins' Studio in San
Francisco.

real life just as freely as she does
from the classical lexicons of
ballet and modern dance. Smiles,
stifled cries, tugs of readjustment
at one's leotards and tights, and
unexpected collisions all become
part of the ongoing activity of the
dance.
In one especially memorable

sequence Friday night, Jenkins,
Michelle Larsson and Patty Smith
stumbled, staggered, showed and
inexorably spilled themselves
across the stage in a comically
intertwined jumble of legs, arms
and heads.
At another point, a dancer
repeatedly pinned and unpinned
her hair with an air of
nonchalance, seemingly unaware
that she was the only one left
onstage.
In yet another sequence,
Jenkins enacted an incredible and
unrelenting medley of mundane
actions and dance movements.
She would accomplish a dazzling
sequence of rapid turns and
dramatic leaps and then casually
shrug her shoulders, readjust her
hair, and stroll to another part of
the performing space to begin
again.
False Finish
She did this several times and
each time with the same sense of
finality and commencement. The
effect of this sequence was to
force a reshuffling of our
expectations about beginnings,
middles and endings.
Jenkins shows us that dance,
like life, can be asyndetonic;
patterns and sequences need not
always be predictable and
successive.
Throughout Interferences there
was a continual panoply of
activities vying for our attention.
There were dancers "onstage" in
the center of the performing
space, waiting dancers warming up
or "marking it"on the sides of the
studio, and then there were the
members of the audience seated

around the perimeters of the
studio, all of whom became facets
of the dance.
Audience In
Here again Jenkins proved
trenchant. Studio performances
have always presented a special
problem because of their
paradoxical informality and
ceremoniousness. But in
Interferences Jenkins cleverly
incorporates the audience so that
we are drawn into the action.
When one has to move one's
feet in order to let the dancers
pass, or when a sweating, panting

dancer reclines nearby between
sections, one can't help but feel a
part of the activity.
In this way the dance becomes
a mutual event; it transcends the
limited participant-viewer
dialectic, and vivifies our whole
notion of performance. As
audience we are engaged in a
process of becoming with the
dancers and this in itself is a work
of genius.
The final two performances of
Interferences will be March 2 and
9 at Jenkins' Studio in San
Francisco.

SAN FRANCISCO-
Philosophical speculation and
dance are two areas of human
activity that don't appear to have
much in common.
They don't, that is, unless you
happen to see Interferences, a
collaborative dance work by
choreographer Margaret Jenkins
and poet Michael Palmer, which
premiered last Friday night at
Jenkirs' San Francisco Studio.
Jenkins is a local dancer and
choreographer of unusual insight.
Her aesthetic sensibilities are very
much akin to those of her mentor
and dance colleague Merce
Cunningham.
Like Cunninghams', Jenkins'
art explores those amorphous
peripheries, the boundaries
between life and art. And like
Cunn : ngham, Jenkins recognizes
the problematical nature of their
interplay.
But rather than engaging in
metaphysical theorizing, Jenkins'
newest work, Interferences,
simply presents a contiguous
chain of visual and aural

occurrences for our
contemplation.
Slow Flux
Structurally, Interferences is an
hour-long piece consisting of the
constantly changing groupings,
energies and humors of twelve
dancers. Some phrases, and within
these phrases certain sequences,
repeat themselves, and others do
not.
Occasionally two, three, eight
or even 12 dancers may come
together for a brief unison
pattern; a stuttering step forward,
convulsively twitching shoulders,
frantically beating arms, and the
moment is past as each dancer is
reabsorbed into his own
kinesthetic reflections.
In choreographing her dances,
Jenkins borrows movements from
real life just as freely as she does
from the classical lexicons of
ballet and modern dance. Smiles,
stifled cries, tugs of readjustment
at one's leotards and tights, and
unexpected collisions all become
part of the ongoing activity of the
