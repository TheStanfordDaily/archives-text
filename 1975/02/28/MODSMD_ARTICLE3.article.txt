# Preliminary Voting By C-AAA Recommends Return Of D Grade
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
In a preliminary vote last week, the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA)
recommended reinstitution of the D
grade, but reversed subcommittee
proposals to restore an early drop
deadline for courses and a recorded
"no-credit" grade on students'
transcripts.
C-AAA Chairman Alexander Fetter,
a physics professor, said yesterday the
committee would vote on a final
report to the Faculty Senate on
Wednesday, and added, "I don't
anticipate any major changes" from
the preliminary vote.
Last month, the Ad Hoc Panel to
Study the Grading System, a C-AAA
subcommittee, voted 5-4 in favor of an
earlier drop deadline and a recorded
"no-credit."
Asst. History Prof. W. Alasdair
MacPhail, a C-AAA member, said
yesterday the full committee's vote to
reverse the drop deadline
recommendation was also 5-4.
The Ad Hoc Panel had voted
unanimously against reinstitution of
the D.
MacPhail added that the
committee's vote for restoration of the
D, which occurred after the drop
deadline vote, was unanimous. The
Committee also voted unanimously
against putting any "no credit"
notation on the transcript in addition
to the D, MacPhail said.
Improving C's Image
According to Fetter, "the feeling of
the committee as we discussed the
D was that one reason for the small
number of Cs currently given is
that there is no grade below C. Under
our proposal, the D would become the
minimal passing grades."
Fetter said he personally "was
impressed with the argument [Assoc.
History Prof. David] Kennedy made
[in a Feb. 4 Daily opinion column]
that when you only grade people with
an A or a B, you really don't provide
very much information to the student
or anyone else. C should be
interpreted as a satisfactory grade, and
the fact is that it's not."

MacPhail agreed that reinstitution
of the D "might tend to reduce the
grade inflation problem. It won't deal
with it en toto, however, and I'm not
pinning great hopes on it."
He did say, however, that bringing
back the D "would help to equate the
A, Band C grades with what they're
meant to stand for."
Changed Mind
Another C-AAA member, senior
civil engineering major Ann
Bamesberger, said she "started out
being in favor of the 'historical record'
system [which includes an early drop
deadline and a recorded 'no-credit']
and I changed over after hearing a lot
of what the students were saying."
The C-AAA had solicited student
opinion in a Daily advertisement
which carried the complete text of the
Ad Hoc Panel's recommendations, and
Bamesberger said "we received some
really good letters," mostly in
opposition to the proposals.
"Student input had a lot to do with
the decision" of the committee,
Bamesberger said.
She added that she voted against an
earlier drop deadline because "this
change wouldrf t really have anything
to do with grade inflation" which was
one of the problems about which she
was most concerned. "No one really
presented strong enough opinions to
justify a change," Bamesberger said.
Bamesberger concluded that the
C-AAA's rejection of the earlier drop
deadline resulted from its "not really
seeing that much wrong with the
present system."
However, MacPhail said "I firmly
believe that it [the earlier drop
deadline] is necessary.
Impair Course
"In a small group course, if one or
two people sit back uncommitted to
the course, this runs the risk of
impairing the intellectual milieu of the
course," MacPhail warned, pointing
out that an earlier deadline would
force students to commit themselves
to the course sooner.
MacPhail also said his support for
the early drop deadline resulted from

"a sort of paternalistic attitude on my
part, by saying to the student, 'Look,
you've got to commit yourself to the
course earlier if you want to avoid
spreading yourself too thin.' "
While MacPhail said he recognized
that such a deadline "might work to
the disadvantage of the student by
discouraging him from experimenting
with courses," he said he believed that
most students' decisions to drop a
course at a late date are "brought
about by fear of the final, rather than
by a rational choice between courses."
Other recommendations approved
in the preliminary vote were:

—what Fetter called "a specific
recommendation that the letter grade
indicator not be regularly computed
by the University and that it not be
included on the student's transcript;"
—an Ad Hoc Panel proposal which
would restrict giving incompletes "to
cases where the student has completed
a substantial portion of the course
vvork at passing level."
In a survey taken during the
1968-1969 academic year, when the
University still recorded D and F
grades, three percent of the students
received Ds while 16 percent received
Cs.

the fact is that it's not."

MacPhail agreed that reinstitution
of the D "might tend to reduce the
grade inflation problem. It won't deal
with it en toto, however, and I'm not
pinning great hopes on it."
He did say, however, that bringing
back the D "would help to equate the
A, Band C grades with what they're
meant to stand for."
Changed Mind
Another C-AAA member, senior
civil engineering major Ann
Bamesberger, said she "started out
being in favor of the 'historical record'
system [which includes an early drop
deadline and a recorded 'no-credit']
and I changed over after hearing a lot
of what the students were saying."
The C-AAA had solicited student
opinion in a Daily advertisement
which carried the complete text of the
Ad Hoc Panel's recommendations, and
Bamesberger said "we received some
really good letters," mostly in
opposition to the proposals.
"Student input had a lot to do with
the decision" of the committee,
Bamesberger said.
She added that she voted against an
earlier drop deadline because "this
change wouldrf t really have anything
to do with grade inflation" which was
one of the problems about which she
was most concerned. "No one really
presented strong enough opinions to
justify a change," Bamesberger said.
Bamesberger concluded that the
C-AAA's rejection of the earlier drop
deadline resulted from its "not really
seeing that much wrong with the
present system."
However, MacPhail said "I firmly
believe that it [the earlier drop
deadline] is necessary.
Impair Course
"In a small group course, if one or
two people sit back uncommitted to
the course, this runs the risk of
impairing the intellectual milieu of the
course," MacPhail warned, pointing
out that an earlier deadline would
force students to commit themselves
to the course sooner.
MacPhail also said his support for
the early drop deadline resulted from

"a sort of paternalistic attitude on my
part, by saying to the student, 'Look,
you've got to commit yourself to the
course earlier if you want to avoid
spreading yourself too thin.' "
While MacPhail said he recognized
that such a deadline "might work to
the disadvantage of the student by
discouraging him from experimenting
with courses," he said he believed that
most students' decisions to drop a
course at a late date are "brought
about by fear of the final, rather than
by a rational choice between courses."
Other recommendations approved
in the preliminary vote were:

—what Fetter called "a specific
recommendation that the letter grade
indicator not be regularly computed
by the University and that it not be
included on the student's transcript;"
—an Ad Hoc Panel proposal which
would restrict giving incompletes "to
cases where the student has completed
a substantial portion of the course
vvork at passing level."
In a survey taken during the
1968-1969 academic year, when the
University still recorded D and F
grades, three percent of the students
received Ds while 16 percent received
Cs.
In a preliminary vote last week, the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA)
recommended reinstitution of the D
grade, but reversed subcommittee
proposals to restore an early drop
deadline for courses and a recorded
"no-credit" grade on students'
transcripts.
C-AAA Chairman Alexander Fetter,
a physics professor, said yesterday the
committee would vote on a final
report to the Faculty Senate on
Wednesday, and added, "I don't
anticipate any major changes" from
the preliminary vote.
Last month, the Ad Hoc Panel to
Study the Grading System, a C-AAA
subcommittee, voted 5-4 in favor of an
earlier drop deadline and a recorded
"no-credit."
Asst. History Prof. W. Alasdair
MacPhail, a C-AAA member, said
yesterday the full committee's vote to
reverse the drop deadline
recommendation was also 5-4.
The Ad Hoc Panel had voted
unanimously against reinstitution of
the D.
MacPhail added that the
committee's vote for restoration of the
D, which occurred after the drop
deadline vote, was unanimous. The
Committee also voted unanimously
against putting any "no credit"
notation on the transcript in addition
to the D, MacPhail said.
Improving C's Image
According to Fetter, "the feeling of
the committee as we discussed the
D was that one reason for the small
number of Cs currently given is
that there is no grade below C. Under
our proposal, the D would become the
minimal passing grades."
Fetter said he personally "was
impressed with the argument [Assoc.
History Prof. David] Kennedy made
[in a Feb. 4 Daily opinion column]
that when you only grade people with
an A or a B, you really don't provide
very much information to the student
or anyone else. C should be
interpreted as a satisfactory grade, and
the fact is that it's not."

MacPhail agreed that reinstitution
of the D "might tend to reduce the

MacPhail also said his support for
the early drop deadline resulted from

"a sort of paternalistic attitude on my
part, by saying to the student, 'Look,
you've got to commit yourself to the
course earlier if you want to avoid
spreading yourself too thin.' "
While MacPhail said he recognized
that such a deadline "might work to
the disadvantage of the student by
discouraging him from experimenting
with courses," he said he believed that
most students' decisions to drop a
course at a late date are "brought
about by fear of the final, rather than
by a rational choice between courses."
Other recommendations approved
in the preliminary vote were:

—what Fetter called "a specific
recommendation that the letter grade
indicator not be regularly computed
by the University and that it not be
included on the student's transcript;"
—an Ad Hoc Panel proposal which
would restrict giving incompletes "to
cases where the student has completed
a substantial portion of the course
vvork at passing level."
In a survey taken during the
1968-1969 academic year, when the
University still recorded D and F
grades, three percent of the students
received Ds while 16 percent received
Cs.
In a preliminary vote last week, the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA)
recommended reinstitution of the D
grade, but reversed subcommittee
proposals to restore an early drop
deadline for courses and a recorded
"no-credit" grade on students'
transcripts.
C-AAA Chairman Alexander Fetter,
a physics professor, said yesterday the
committee would vote on a final
report to the Faculty Senate on
Wednesday, and added, "I don't
anticipate any major changes" from
the preliminary vote.
Last month, the Ad Hoc Panel to
Study the Grading System, a C-AAA
subcommittee, voted 5-4 in favor of an
earlier drop deadline and a recorded
"no-credit."
Asst. History Prof. W. Alasdair
MacPhail, a C-AAA member, said
yesterday the full committee's vote to
reverse the drop deadline
recommendation was also 5-4.
The Ad Hoc Panel had voted
unanimously against reinstitution of
the D.
MacPhail added that the
committee's vote for restoration of the
D, which occurred after the drop
deadline vote, was unanimous. The
Committee also voted unanimously
against putting any "no credit"
notation on the transcript in addition
to the D, MacPhail said.
Improving C's Image
According to Fetter, "the feeling of
the committee as we discussed the
D was that one reason for the small
number of Cs currently given is
that there is no grade below C. Under
our proposal, the D would become the
minimal passing grades."
Fetter said he personally "was
impressed with the argument [Assoc.
History Prof. David] Kennedy made
[in a Feb. 4 Daily opinion column]
that when you only grade people with
an A or a B, you really don't provide
very much information to the student
or anyone else. C should be
interpreted as a satisfactory grade, and
the fact is that it's not."

MacPhail agreed that reinstitution
of the D "might tend to reduce the
grade inflation problem. It won't deal
with it en toto, however, and I'm not
pinning great hopes on it."
He did say, however, that bringing
back the D "would help to equate the
A, Band C grades with what they're
meant to stand for."
Changed Mind
Another C-AAA member, senior
civil engineering major Ann
Bamesberger, said she "started out
being in favor of the 'historical record'
system [which includes an early drop
deadline and a recorded 'no-credit']
and I changed over after hearing a lot
of what the students were saying."
The C-AAA had solicited student
opinion in a Daily advertisement
which carried the complete text of the
Ad Hoc Panel's recommendations, and
Bamesberger said "we received some
really good letters," mostly in
opposition to the proposals.
"Student input had a lot to do with
the decision" of the committee,
Bamesberger said.
She added that she voted against an
earlier drop deadline because "this
change wouldrf t really have anything
to do with grade inflation" which was
one of the problems about which she
was most concerned. "No one really
presented strong enough opinions to
justify a change," Bamesberger said.
Bamesberger concluded that the
C-AAA's rejection of the earlier drop
deadline resulted from its "not really
seeing that much wrong with the
present system."
However, MacPhail said "I firmly
believe that it [the earlier drop
deadline] is necessary.
Impair Course
"In a small group course, if one or
two people sit back uncommitted to
the course, this runs the risk of
impairing the intellectual milieu of the
course," MacPhail warned, pointing
out that an earlier deadline would
force students to commit themselves
to the course sooner.
MacPhail also said his support for
the early drop deadline resulted from

"a sort of paternalistic attitude on my
part, by saying to the student, 'Look,
you've got to commit yourself to the
course earlier if you want to avoid
spreading yourself too thin.' "
