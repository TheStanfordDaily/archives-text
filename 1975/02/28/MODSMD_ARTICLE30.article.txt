# Canin Gives Virtuoso Performance

SAN FRANCISCO—The San
Francisco Symphony is featuring
its concertmaster Stuart Canin as
soloist this week.
Canin displayed remarkable
virtuosity and impeccable
musicianship in his performance
Wednesday night Wieniawski's
Violin Concerto No. 2 in D Minor,
Opus 22.
The concerto, published in
1870, is a romantic "Gypsy
style" piece that only the most
capable musicians can attempt. It
takes the left hand all over the
fingerboard, while the right hand
must cope with incredibly fast
bowings and always maintain
complete control.
The audience responded with
three rounds of applause to
Canin's generally excellent
performance.

The orchestra gave Canin good,
solid accompaniment. The
orchestration is not nearly as
difficult as the soloist's part, but
the steady accompaniment was
instrumental to the success of
Canin's performance.
The orchestra's performance of
Cesar Franck's Symphony in D
Minor began unevenly but ended
quite successfully. In the first
movement visiting conductor
Zdenek Macal took some passages
too fast, causing a poor mesh of
entrances and insecure tempos.
The woodwinds weren't loud
enough in the opening movement
and were occasionally drowned by
the rest of the Orchestra.
The second and third
movements were much more
successful. The English horn,
harps, and trumpets were
particularly good, and dynamic
contrasts were effective
throughout the orchestra. The
orchestra brought the symphony
to a very dramatic close that the
audience loved.
The least successful
performance was the orchestra's
American premiere of Rudolf
Kelterborn's Changements.
Completed in 1973 and premiered
by the Southwest German Radio
Orchestra, the short piece is a
blend of all possible sounds from
each instrument.
Kellerborn's composition
attempts to mimic electronic
music without electronic
equipment, so that the piece is an
often annoying series of
uncomfortable sounds. The
timpani rumble, the brass blare,
and the winds screech in a

bewildering cacaphony.
Considering what the orchestra
had to work with, they performed
quite well. Audience disapproval
of Kelterborn's work was obvious
from hisses and half-hearted
applause.
