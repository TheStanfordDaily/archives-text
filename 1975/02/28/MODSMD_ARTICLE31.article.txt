# CBS Slates 'Blue Knight'
## 
### 
CBS television has
announced it will underwrite
the costs of a pilot show based
on Joseph Wambaugh's novel
The Blue Knights.
NBC adapted the novel into
a mini-series that ran on four
consecutive evenings last
season — but decided it didn't
need another cops-and-robbers
show, since it already had
Police Story — also written,
incidentally, by Wambaugh.
"We figured that any
episode produced for a Blue
Knight series could just as
easily be produced for Police
Story," one NBC executive
said, explaining why his
network didn't pick up the
show. "That would be no
duplication."
Police Story is an anthology
series with no continuing
characters.
But not CBS has announced
it will try to make a go of it,
using George Kennedy in the
series lead. William Holden
played the lead on NBC's
mini-series.
