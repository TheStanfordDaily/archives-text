It was a long time coming, but
full-fledged electronic music has
finally made it to the rock world.
A new musical style, with
influences as diverse as
Stockhausen and Emerson, Lake
and Palmer, is emerging in
Europe, and some of it sounds
fascinating.
Passport, a German quartet
guided by KJaus Doldinger, a
master of the Moog, mello',ron
and electric sax, must have been
listening closely to American
jazz-rockers like Billy Cobham,
because their music has the same
pulsing base.
Atop Curt Cress' steady
drumming (capable, but not
Cobham) and Wolfgang Schmid's
fat bass notes, though, Doldinger
adds a multitude of electronic
sounds from the five instruments
he plays.
Every song on the album shows
off Doldinger's flair for
embellishing his own
compositions: "Homunculus"
with a seductive soprano
saxophone (electric, of course) in
thylead, and a lovely ballad called
"Damals" point up Doldinger's
flair as a soloist.
A 13-minute suite, the
title track captures Passport at
their best: Cress slapping his
drums spiritedly, and Schmid
helping out on guitar and bass
while Doldinger and keyboard
player Kristian Schultze control
the flow of melodies.
Doldinger shines on Moog
synthesizer, at one point using the

traditional Keith Emerson-style
tone to spin off a heady solo.
Schultz provides some spacy
chords on his distorted Fender
piano, and his wah-wah organ solo
in the middle of the piece is
superb.
Froese, also a German and a
member of the avant-garde band
Tangerine Dream, has created
what could be the ultimate sound
effect with this solo keyboard
album Aqua.
For those who don't expect
melodies they can whistle, Aqua
may prove a pleasant diversion
because Froese has used his
imposing Moog synthesizer so
cleverly. The sounds melt
smoothly into each other; fuzzed
bass patterns to shimmering
water-like noises, all marvelously
recorded.
It's certainly not rock — it
might not be music at all — but
Froese's work is remarkably
seductive.
