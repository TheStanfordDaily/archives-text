# Pianist Ax Appears
## 
### 
Pianist Emanuel Ax will play
tonight at Tresidder Lounge at 8
p.m. in a concert sponsored by
the Office of Public Events.
Ax, a Polish-born graduate of
the Juilliard School, is a recent
winner of the International
Chopin Competition. His recent
recitals have earned him praise
from reviewers of such news
papers as the New York Times
and Washington Post.
"A powerhouse technically,
but besides well-schooled fluency
and power, Ax could provide
considerable grace and elegance
when he felt the music called for
it," said the Times critic of one of
Ax's New York recitals.

Ax has appeared at many
colleges as a result of his winning
the Young Concert Artists
auditions.
Ax's concert tonight will
feature a performance of a Mozart
piano Sonata.
Other upcoming Public Events
concerts include a Dinkelspiel
Auditorium performance next
Friday, March 7, by a group of
five musicians from the Marlboro
Festival.
The Claude Kipnis mime
theater will appear for two nights,
March 13 and 14, in Memorial
Auditorium in the final Public
Events production of the quarter.
