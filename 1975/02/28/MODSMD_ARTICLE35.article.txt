# J. Geils Band Stomps At Winterland
## 
### MICHELE FARRAR 
SAN FRANCISCO—They're
your basic neighborhood punks
and schoolyard bullies. They'll
stomp anybody (especially
women) who'll dare to sully their
blue suede shoes; in fact, they'll
goad you into doing it so they can
act ugly. They're a rasty rock
group: the J. Geils Band from
Boston.
Peter Wolf is leader of the
pack, jogging around the stage,
getting worked up. The band
waits silently for him to start
raging.
Banks of colored spotlights
flash on, and there stands Wolf,
defiantly, in a satin
purple-and-black tuxedo, black
beret and aviator glasses.
"We're gonna rip your face
off!" he challenges, drawing
whoops of delight from the
crowd. They were prepared for
some mean rock and roll Sunday
night at Winterland, and the J.
Geils Band gave it to them right
between the eyes with tunes like
"Looin' For Love," "Detroit
Breakdown," "Southside
Shuffle," and "Love Ain't Nothin'
But a Heartache."
Reckless Prancing
Wolf recklessly pranced around
with enough speed and agility to
make the audience dizzy. Before
the band leaped into each n
number, he babbled rhyming
monologues in raspy, demanding
tones, generating high-pitched
excitement.

wound scorching leads into their
music, his mouth wide open in a
silent scream of hysteria. When J.
(that stands for "Jack," trivia
fans) stepped into the spotlight,
even Wolf's antics were
overshadowed.
Magic Dick, one of the all-time
great harmonica players,
contributed to the frenetic pace
while convincing listeners that his
instrument can talk, chortle,
moan and wail. Whatever the
sound, his harmonica remained
distinct in solo as well as in

back-up work.
"First I Look at the Purse"
sums up the bulk of J. Geils Band
lyrics in its pronounced machismo
attitude towards women, but the
group's strength lies not in lyrics,
but in putting on a good, solid
show.
For beginners, its stage crew
carpeted the stage, set up an
unusually high, elevated platform
for drummer Steve Jones, and
placed five sets of extra spotlights
near the ceiling, meticulously
checking their position and
intensity.
The group doesn't scrimp on
its sound system, which is
elaborate, massive, and obviously
expensive. The effect outweighs
the trouble involved: the volume
doesn't have to shatter eardrums
because the sound is clear and
clean, with a minimum of

distortion.
For those who read the
National Enquirer Faye Dunaway
sat backstage for part of the set.
(for those who don't, Faye is
married to Peter Wolf).
Second-billed John Entwistle's
Ox features the Who's bass player.
Unfortunately, Entwistle is an
egomaniac. His bass volume was
so loud that he managed to drown
out his fellow band members.
The lead guitarist managed to
escape the dim by cranking out
piercingly high notes throughout
the set, and the drummer tried to
be heard with harsh pounding.
Entwistle does play excellent
bass: his fingers dart quickly on
the strings, creating intricate
rhythms, but as one observer
aptly put it, "Never seen a bass
try to be a lead, let alone a whole
band."
