# Turrentine's Sax Gives Soul Lesson
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO—The
people who mass-produce
"beautiful music" should take a
lesson from Stanley Turrentine:
his music is smooth, lyrical ard
laid-back, but it still swings
mightily.
A standing-room-only crowd,
probably spurred on by the
success of Turrentine's best-selling
album Pieces of Dreams, came to
hear the tenor saxophonist and his
quartet one night last week at
Keystone Korner — and they
stayed around for almost three
hours of soul-satisfying jazz.
"Mr. T" showed that his hig,
Texas-styled tenor sound hasn't
changed a bit during his rise to
popularity — he plays ballads with
more feeling and control than
anyone since Lester Young.
On relaxed numbers like
"Pieces of Dreams," Turrentine

and his band were all style:
Stanley out front, squuezing long
notes from his horn;
white-turbaned John Miller filling
in soft piano chords; drummer
Bruno Carr laying down the beat
on his snare and cymbals; and
TVrue Nockamoura providing a
I'ttle tension with pounding bass
runs.
Although Turrentine didn't
squawk or shriek with his sax
(except in an amusing parody of
the more intense stylists), his
music contained plent of variety.
"Gibraltar," for instance, was a
soul ballad with a Spanish flavor,
and as usual Stanley spent a lot of
time on the melody before
moving on to his improvised solo.
Nockamoura, whose playing
was the most agitated of any
member of the quartet's, provided
a fine counterpoint to
Turrentine's tenor with rapid
-tacatto base lines.
In fact, Nockamoura plucked
his instrument so violently that he
often had to pause to tune it.
Drummer Carr, a very fine soul
accompanist, added a few brisk
solos, but he spent most of the
evening tapping his two cymbals
to back Turrentine.
Generous Turrentine let his.*
backup trio take over for two
numbers, and on these, especially
"Derek's Dance," Miller's piano
stood out.
The backbone of a unit like the
Turrentine quartet is usually the
pianist, and Miller shone as a
highly melodic soloist and a fine
foil for Turrentine's rich sound.
He also played one of the
mildest-mannered synthesizers ,
around: this one, a small
keyboard, had a pleasant
organ-like sound, and Miller
happily resisted the urge to fiddle
with its nobs.
