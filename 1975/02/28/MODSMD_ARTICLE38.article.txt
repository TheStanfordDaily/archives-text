# Card Cagers Face Los Angeles Duo
## 
### DAN PYNE 
A whole lot of things have happened since Stanford pulled off the
uji-pull-offable basketball trick of the year and beat UCLA and USC
one weekend. A whole lot.
And Card coach Howie Dallmar is at that philosophical part of the
season again when the Cards have to play UCLA and USC and beat
them both to salvage a breath of a playoff hope.
And Dallmar is philosophical. Tonight Stanford faces the
12th-ranked Trojans, with whom the Cards share a Pacific Eight third
place. Tomorrow Stanford plays league-leading UCLA in a place in

which the Bruins have not lost in
a long time.
"They've won 79 in a row at
home, so somebody else has to
win there sometime," Dallmar
says simply. It sounds absurd, but
it is the same logic that enabled
the Cards to upset the Bruins
earlier this year. Uncanny.
o
/ The Cardinal hoop coach is
still somewhat upset about last
weekend and the ejection of Rich
Kelley from the Oregon game. "I
don't expect Kelley to apologize
and i certainly am not going to do
.jk. Rich was kicked once and
tripped twice.
"I've had it with Oregon."
Dallmar added, however, at a
Senior Athlete's Banquet
Wednesday night, that "it was not
a very hard kick . . .if it [Mike
Drummond] had been a football
it would have only gone about six
feet."
r*
Tonight the Cards will have to
contain Gus Williams, among
others, and shoot even better than
they have been shooting at
Maples. USC is 11-1 at home, and
leads the league in offense with an
88 points-per-game average.
Tomorrow the Cards will have
to contain Dave Meyers, among
others, and Dallmar will once
again have to figure out a way to
fool John Wooden.
The last three weeks have been
battering ones .. . where is Air
Force when we really need it?
