# Pac-8 Predictions

### 
We 're almost ashamed to
show up this week, but a
eouple beers have increased the
confidence of our fearful
forecaster so he can go on for
one week at least.
We had our second sub par
(or triple-bogey) week last
weekend, picking only three of
six games correctly. Our season
percentage is now down to
.667(34-17).
Stanford's unpredictable
Cardinals spend the weekend in
Los Angeles against a pair of
bloodthirsty and vengeful
powers. We figure Rich Kelley
will be so glad he's not playing
Oregon he '11 go berserk against
USC and lead an upset.
The next night, against
UCLA, the Cards will probably
stay close for a while before
being blown out of the gym by
a UCLA team that hasn't
forgotten that game in January.
Up north, the best game is
Washington against Oregon
State Saturday night. Both
reams are red-hot, but we think
OSU luck will hold out.
