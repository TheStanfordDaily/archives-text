# 62 Groups Seek Fee Assessment Funds
## 
### RANDALL TURK 
Applications for portions of next year's projected ASSU
program fee assessment have increased 33 percent over this
year because of widespread University cutbacks in program
funding, according to ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri.
All but six of the 42 organizations which received
program fee allocations this year have reapplied, and 26
additional applicants have joined them.
The 62 requests for 1975-76 total $82,000, Olivieri said,
a 41 percent rise over the $58,000 requested from this
year's program fee. Some $19,500 eventually was allotted
by the ASSU Senate from fall and winter quarter $1 fee
assessments.
Olivieri therefore must trim considerably from the
requests if the ASSU is to seek an equally large program fee
assessment for next year.
Olivieri conducted five-minute interviews this week with
representatives of each applying group, clearing up
questions about the applicants proposed budgets in
preparation for his final recommendations to be submitted
to the Senate in four weeks.
The Senate will then vote on the entire package. A
three-fifths approval there will send the assessment to the
student body in the upcoming spring elections. To be
approved, the assessment must gamer majority approval
with at least 20 percent of the students voting.
Olivieri said his recommendations will give priority to
those groups which have traditionally sought funding

through the program fee, "because as far as I'm concerned
the student body should not have to foot the bill for
operations which have been covered by other areas of the
University that are now short of money."
"Both University and outside funds are drying up, and
the first things to go are 'peripheral expenditures,' which in
this case are the student groups, activities and lecture series
that are so very important to the Stanford experience.
"Now everybody and his mother is coming to ASSU for
money."
For those organizations which seek their own fee
assessments rather than rely on the program fee, a petition
carrying the signatures of 10 percent of the student body is
required for placement on the spring ballot.
Although no petitions have yet been submitted, Olivieri
has been informed that the ASSU Publications Board plans
to file, and he assumes that the Daily, the Band, the ASSU
Legal Counseling Service and the ASSU Speakers Bureau
also will file.
Program and other student fee assessments are
refundable, and Olivieri urged students to seek rebates from
approved assessments they consider unworthy.
"That's their prerogative, and I recommend they do it,"
said Olivieri, adding that he took back $4 of the $10
collected at registrations for fall and winter quarters.
"This year's $10 [total in] fee assessments was a record
high over past years when it was never more than $3 or
$4," Olivieri said, noting that as a result, the percentage of
those requesting refunds rose from the past average of seven
or eight percent to 11 percent this year.

representatives of each applying group, clearing up
questions about the applicants proposed budgets in
preparation for his final recommendations to be submitted
to the Senate in four weeks.
The Senate will then vote on the entire package. A
three-fifths approval there will send the assessment to the
student body in the upcoming spring elections. To be
approved, the assessment must gamer majority approval
with at least 20 percent of the students voting.
Olivieri said his recommendations will give priority to
those groups which have traditionally sought funding

through the program fee, "because as far as I'm concerned
the student body should not have to foot the bill for
operations which have been covered by other areas of the
University that are now short of money."
"Both University and outside funds are drying up, and
the first things to go are 'peripheral expenditures,' which in
this case are the student groups, activities and lecture series
that are so very important to the Stanford experience.
"Now everybody and his mother is coming to ASSU for
money."
For those organizations which seek their own fee
assessments rather than rely on the program fee, a petition
carrying the signatures of 10 percent of the student body is
required for placement on the spring ballot.
Although no petitions have yet been submitted, Olivieri
has been informed that the ASSU Publications Board plans
to file, and he assumes that the Daily, the Band, the ASSU
Legal Counseling Service and the ASSU Speakers Bureau
also will file.
Program and other student fee assessments are
refundable, and Olivieri urged students to seek rebates from
approved assessments they consider unworthy.
"That's their prerogative, and I recommend they do it,"
said Olivieri, adding that he took back $4 of the $10
collected at registrations for fall and winter quarters.
"This year's $10 [total in] fee assessments was a record
high over past years when it was never more than $3 or
$4," Olivieri said, noting that as a result, the percentage of
those requesting refunds rose from the past average of seven
or eight percent to 11 percent this year.
Applications for portions of next year's projected ASSU
program fee assessment have increased 33 percent over this
year because of widespread University cutbacks in program
funding, according to ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri.
All but six of the 42 organizations which received
program fee allocations this year have reapplied, and 26
additional applicants have joined them.
The 62 requests for 1975-76 total $82,000, Olivieri said,
a 41 percent rise over the $58,000 requested from this
year's program fee. Some $19,500 eventually was allotted
by the ASSU Senate from fall and winter quarter $1 fee
assessments.
Olivieri therefore must trim considerably from the
requests if the ASSU is to seek an equally large program fee
assessment for next year.
Olivieri conducted five-minute interviews this week with
representatives of each applying group, clearing up
questions about the applicants proposed budgets in
preparation for his final recommendations to be submitted
to the Senate in four weeks.
