# Tankers Ready For Pac-8s
## 
### BOB KUSTEL 
The Stanford swim team enters
its second season — and perhaps
its only season — next Saturday
with the Pacific Eight conference
swim meet. The two day affair,
held in Los Angeles, is important
for two reasons; it determines the
final Pac-8 standings (excluding
the dual meets, in which Stanford
finished with a record of 2-2) and
it is the last chance for several
swimmers to qualify for the
NCAA Championships held next
month in Cleveland, Ohio.
In last year's Pac-8 finals, USC,
the eventual NCAA champion,
ran away from the rest of the
league and Stanford took fourth
place behind UCLA and
Washington.
The Pac-8 should feature some
of the greatest races of the year,
as the conference is by far the
most talented and well-balanced
in the nation. For example,
conference swim teams hold down
four of the top five spots in the
nation in the 400 yard medley
relay.

There will be several Cards
engaged in intense individual
confrontations, as well. John
Hencken, the number-one
breastroker in the conference (and
nation, for that matter), will have
a race on his hands in the 200
yard individual Medley, as he
duels USC's Scott Brown. Brown
touched out Hencken two weeks
ago in the Trojan-Card dual meet.
Mike Bruner and Washington's
Robin Backhaus should also have
quite an interesting weekend, as
each is either the top or
second-best swimmer in the
country in the 1000 free, the 500
free, and the 200 fly. Bruner
currently holds the edge in the
500 free while Backhaus beat
Bruner by .006 seconds in the
Husky-Card dual meet at the
beginning of the season.
Finally, Dave Fairbank, the top
sprinter in the nation, will face
stern challenges in both the 50
and 100 yard freestyle. In the 50,
USC's Joe Bottom and Scott
Findorff offer the stiffest
competition, and in the 100 free,

eight of the top 16 sprinters in the
country are from the Pac-8.
Coach Jim Gaughran, however,
does not seem to be overly
concerned with the meet as long
as he gets a few more of his
swimmers qualified for the
NCAA's. Throughout the season
he has emphasized that he is
pointing toward the national meet
rather than the Pac-B's.

MEI'S DAY—Card swimmer Mei Ong thrashes through the water at
deGuerre pool in a 50 yard backstroke race. Ong tied a school record
in the event last weekend at the women's Stanford Invitational swim
meet, with a clocking of 30.6. The women's team takes on
Washington and Oregon State in a tri-meet at deGuerre pool
tomorrow.
