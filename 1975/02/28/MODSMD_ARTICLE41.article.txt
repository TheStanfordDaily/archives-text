## The 						Right Approach 
### Ron Beck 
If Penn State head football
coach Joe Paterno had his way,
super athletic machines like USC
and Ohio State would be partially
dismantled.
Paterno, addressing a banquet
for graduating Stanford athletes,
criticized those responsible for
overemphasizing the importance
of college athletics.
And there's no question that
Paterno is right.
The Vince Lombardi "win at all
costs" philosophy which prevails
throughout most of the college
athletic scene should be discarded
for a more rational approach.
Outmoded Philosophy
A philosophy which causes
athletes to forget that college is
also for an education, and
encourages coaches to disregard
their own rules is outmoded.
Fortunately, at Stanford, the
athletic machinery has never been
given a chance to get into high

gear. Paterno recognized that as
one of Stanford's best assets.
"You [Stanford] epitomize
everything that I think is right in
college athletics," Paterno said,
and it was a statement based on
fact.
Stanford's easy approach to
athletics has caused it to be the
butt of jokes and the object of
derision. Los Anglees Times
columnists Jim Murray and John
Hall, among others, revealed their
backward thinking when they
mocked Stanford for its attitude
towards athletics.
Little Affect
Insults of that nature haven't
affected Stanford's style, though.
Stringent admissions standards are
rarely, if ever, stretched for
athletes (a particularly galling
point for those who believe that
with a little admissions
department help, Stanford sports
could be in the same "class" as all
of the super powers).
Money that isn't donated
specifically for athletic
scholarships isn't diverted
unnaturally to the athlctic
department.
And that's exactly the way it
should be.
As long as the objective of
increasing an educational
experience is forgotten, college
athletics will remain a dirty
business. Examples of illegal
action involving a David
Thompson, or a Moses Malone or
an Isaac Curtis are increasing in

frequency.
Paterno puts it rather
succinctly. People are just too
"uptight about winning," he
explained. The pressures for
statistical success that face a
coach are tremendous, according
to Paterno, and they result from
an audience that is too eager to
place the value of winning above
everything else.
But until we, as Paterno says,
"keep competition in its proper
perspective in our universities,"
behavior deleterious to an overall
learning experience at the college
level will continue.
The approach that Stanford has
traditionally taken towards
athletics is a good one.
And the day that the machine
starts to crank its way into full
operation will mark the start of an
unfortunate era for Stanford
athletics.

business. Examples of illegal
action involving a David
Thompson, or a Moses Malone or
an Isaac Curtis are increasing in

frequency.
Paterno puts it rather
succinctly. People are just too
"uptight about winning," he
explained. The pressures for
statistical success that face a
coach are tremendous, according
to Paterno, and they result from
an audience that is too eager to
place the value of winning above
everything else.
But until we, as Paterno says,
"keep competition in its proper
perspective in our universities,"
behavior deleterious to an overall
learning experience at the college
level will continue.
The approach that Stanford has
traditionally taken towards
athletics is a good one.
And the day that the machine
starts to crank its way into full
operation will mark the start of an
unfortunate era for Stanford
athletics.

If Penn State head football
coach Joe Paterno had his way,
super athletic machines like USC
and Ohio State would be partially
dismantled.
Paterno, addressing a banquet
for graduating Stanford athletes,
criticized those responsible for
overemphasizing the importance
of college athletics.
And there's no question that
Paterno is right.
The Vince Lombardi "win at all
costs" philosophy which prevails
throughout most of the college
athletic scene should be discarded
for a more rational approach.
Outmoded Philosophy
A philosophy which causes
athletes to forget that college is
also for an education, and
encourages coaches to disregard
their own rules is outmoded.
Fortunately, at Stanford, the
athletic machinery has never been
given a chance to get into high

gear. Paterno recognized that as
one of Stanford's best assets.
"You [Stanford] epitomize
everything that I think is right in
college athletics," Paterno said,
and it was a statement based on
fact.
Stanford's easy approach to
athletics has caused it to be the
butt of jokes and the object of
derision. Los Anglees Times
columnists Jim Murray and John
Hall, among others, revealed their
backward thinking when they
mocked Stanford for its attitude
towards athletics.
Little Affect
Insults of that nature haven't
affected Stanford's style, though.
Stringent admissions standards are
rarely, if ever, stretched for
athletes (a particularly galling
point for those who believe that
with a little admissions
department help, Stanford sports
could be in the same "class" as all
of the super powers).
Money that isn't donated
specifically for athletic
scholarships isn't diverted
unnaturally to the athlctic
department.
And that's exactly the way it
should be.
As long as the objective of
increasing an educational
experience is forgotten, college
athletics will remain a dirty
business. Examples of illegal
action involving a David
Thompson, or a Moses Malone or
an Isaac Curtis are increasing in

frequency.
