71-38 victory over outmanned

outscoring and outplaying Kappa
Sig. The Zeegs had earned their
way into the game by dumping
KA 48-36 earlier in the week.
Gene Mathis led the Kappa Sig
scoring with 18. Mike Henehan
added 16 for S & D while Steve
Kristovich chipped in 14 and Brad

round victories. Wednesday they
trounced ZAP 70-43 with Tom
Sever scoring 29 points. However,
that apparently was an off-night
for the former varsity player; he
scored 40 in Lathrop's Monday

moved into the semifinal round
after defeating SAE Wednesday
afternoon. The E's earned the

right to meet the Bachacs with a
1-0 victory over Biz I which went

over two days. The length of the
SAE-Biz game was so long that
SAE elected to default rather than
play the Bachacs right after
beating Biz. Lack of scheduling
time forced that procedure.
The Bachacs will meet the
winner of the TTR-Engineers
battle scheduled for Monday at 4
p.m. TTR disposed of Biz II A 2
4-0 in the first round while the
Engineers, seeded fourth took

round victories. Wednesday they
trounced ZAP 70-43 with Tom
Sever scoring 29 points. However,
that apparently was an off-night
for the former varsity player; he
scored 40 in Lathrop's Monday

moved into the semifinal round
after defeating SAE Wednesday
afternoon. The E's earned the

right to meet the Bachacs with a
1-0 victory over Biz I which went
to 19 overtimes and stretched
over two days. The length of the
SAE-Biz game was so long that
SAE elected to default rather than
play the Bachacs right after
beating Biz. Lack of scheduling
time forced that procedure.
The Bachacs will meet the
winner of the TTR-Engineers
battle scheduled for Monday at 4
p.m. TTR disposed of Biz II A 2
4-0 in the first round while the
Engineers, seeded fourth took
