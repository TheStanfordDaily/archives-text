I The Stanford ski team competed in the 1975
| Pacific Coast Skiing Championships at Squaw
i Valley over the weekend. Not only did the team
I compete, but its returned to Stanford with an
£ eye-opening second place finish, its highest in
I many years. And in doing so, the team earned
I its "first-ever" berth in the NCAA skiing
championships, to be held this year March 5-8 at
Purgatory, Colorado.
Stanford was runner-up to Nevada-Reno in
1 the 10-team field. Sierra College and the
| University of California placed third and fourth
1 respectively.
§ In one of the meet's biggest surprises,
I freshman Dave Herbert (pictured above) got the
| Skimeister award, emblematic of the meet's best
I all-around skier. Herbert won the honor by
taking first in the downhill, eighth in the slalom,
13th in the 40-meter nordic jumping, and 34th
| in the difficult cross-country event.
Coach Skip Stritter said Herbert's upset
| victory in the downhill "was really incredible.
| No one from Stanford had ever done that well
| in the slalom before."
I Herbert won the downhill by two-tenths of a
second over second-place finisher Mitch Frazier
I of Sierra.
I Herbert wasn't the only Stanford skier who
i turned in an excellent performance. Sophomore
| Tom Hutton did very well in the alpine events,
I taking a third in the slalom and a 13th in
| downhill. Junior Dave Horth placed ninth in the
slalom and tenth in the downhill. Mark Colville
W

was the Cards' top finisher in both the
nordic-jumping event and the cross-country
race, placing sixth and 22nd, respectively.
Freshmen Rusty Schwartz and Kit Weld also
turned in good performances, with Schwartz
finishing seventh in the jump and Weld placing
18th in downhill. Steve Lindbeck added a 26th
in the cross-country race.
The battle with Sierra for the final NCAA
qualifying berth came down to the nordic
jumping, which was the final event of the meet.
"The finishes of Colville and Schwartz helped us
to beat Sierra in the jumping event, and won us
the berth. Up until that point the second-place
fight was very close," said Stritter.
A women's meet was also held at Squaw.
Although only two skiers from Stanford
competed, the final results were interesting, to
say the least. The two members of the team,
Julie Kepler and Carol Wildman, placed fourth
in the team standings out of eight teams. Their
finish is more remarkable when one realizes that
the other teams all had full rosters of five
women.
Kepler took a 10th in the slalom and 13th in
the cross-country race while her teammate
Wildman placed 15th in the slalom and fifth in
the cross-country event.
This weekend, the Stanford 'B' team will
compete in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Invitational, while the varsity
packs its bags and heads to Colorado for the
NCAA's.

was the Cards' top finisher in both the
nordic-jumping event and the cross-country
race, placing sixth and 22nd, respectively.
Freshmen Rusty Schwartz and Kit Weld also
turned in good performances, with Schwartz
finishing seventh in the jump and Weld placing
18th in downhill. Steve Lindbeck added a 26th
in the cross-country race.
The battle with Sierra for the final NCAA
qualifying berth came down to the nordic
jumping, which was the final event of the meet.
"The finishes of Colville and Schwartz helped us
to beat Sierra in the jumping event, and won us
the berth. Up until that point the second-place
fight was very close," said Stritter.
A women's meet was also held at Squaw.
Although only two skiers from Stanford
competed, the final results were interesting, to
say the least. The two members of the team,
Julie Kepler and Carol Wildman, placed fourth
in the team standings out of eight teams. Their
finish is more remarkable when one realizes that
the other teams all had full rosters of five
women.
Kepler took a 10th in the slalom and 13th in
the cross-country race while her teammate
Wildman placed 15th in the slalom and fifth in
the cross-country event.
This weekend, the Stanford 'B' team will
compete in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Invitational, while the varsity
packs its bags and heads to Colorado for the
NCAA's.
