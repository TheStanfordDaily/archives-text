# Cardinal Spikers Set For Season
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
After compiling a 3-9 dual
meet record over the past two
track and field campaigns, it
shouldn't be hard for a coach to
refrain from using superlatives to
describe his latest team.
Yet Stanford track and field
mentor Payton Jordan had
trouble restraining himself as he
looked ahead to the 1975 outdoor
track and field campaign which
gets underway tomorrow
afternoon. The Cards host Fresno
State in Stanford Stadium at 1:15
p.m.
"We're going to be more
exciting at the [starting] line,"
Jordan said. "I think this is going
to be an exciting team."
Part of the excitement will be
due to a number of new recruits.
Topping the list of talented but
untested newcomers are freshman
long jumper James Lofton, and
pole vaulter Bob Flint, a transfer

student from Fresno City College.
Lofton, a high-school football
All-American, won the California
state long jump championship last
year with a jump of 24 feet 4\h
inches.
Flint won the state junior
college pole vault championship
with a vault of 16-6 I A.
Among the veterans Jordan
sees depth.
Lots Of Depth
"For the first time in 10 years
we won't have to overwork people
and ask them to get into too
many events," he said. "We'll have
the flexibility that's been absent
here awhile."
Heading the list of sprinters are
sophomores Marvin Holmes and
Scott Wingo, and freshmen Alan
Sheats and Otto Rossner. Wingo
and Sheats will also run on the
440 and mile relay teams.
The Cards should have one of
the best hurdling crews in the

conference, led by Pac-8 440
intermediate hurdles champion
Matt Hogsett.
"Hogsett is certainly one of the
best intermediate hurdlers in the
nation," Jordan said, "and Dave
Bagshaw and John Foster give us
an outstanding one-two punch in
the 120 highs."
Dominate Distances
Stanford should also continue
its dominance of the conference
in distance events. In the team
time trials two weeks ago seven
distance men finished under 4:19
in the mile. Tony Sandoval, Mark
McConnell, Jack Bellah and Steve
Crowley lead the Card
lung-busters. Bellah will double in
the steeplechase.
The Cards are well-set in the
half mile with Ben Scheible, Jim

Bourdoini and newcomer Mark
Hadley, who ran a 1:52.6 half in
high school.
But the 1975 spikers will be
weak in the field — especially in
the weight events, where Mike
Langford, John Olenchalk, Rich
Merlo and freshman Mark Hill are,
according to Jordan,
"developing."
"Hill and Merlo have excellent
potential in the discus," Jordan
said, "and Olenchalk is improving
all the time in the shot."
Jordan is hesitant to make his
pre-season predictions too
optimistic. "This conference is the
strongest in the nation. We will be
stronger this year, and we'll take
our best guns to the lines." But
this year, unlike previous years, he
may have the guns to do it.

Hadley, who ran a 1:52.6 half in
high school.
But the 1975 spikers will be
weak in the field — especially in
the weight events, where Mike
Langford, John Olenchalk, Rich
Merlo and freshman Mark Hill are,
according to Jordan,
"developing."
"Hill and Merlo have excellent
potential in the discus," Jordan
said, "and Olenchalk is improving
all the time in the shot."
Jordan is hesitant to make his
pre-season predictions too
optimistic. "This conference is the
strongest in the nation. We will be
stronger this year, and we'll take
our best guns to the lines." But
this year, unlike previous years, he
may have the guns to do it.
After compiling a 3-9 dual
meet record over the past two
track and field campaigns, it
shouldn't be hard for a coach to
refrain from using superlatives to
describe his latest team.
Yet Stanford track and field
mentor Payton Jordan had
trouble restraining himself as he
looked ahead to the 1975 outdoor
track and field campaign which
gets underway tomorrow
afternoon. The Cards host Fresno
State in Stanford Stadium at 1:15
p.m.
"We're going to be more
exciting at the [starting] line,"
Jordan said. "I think this is going
to be an exciting team."
Part of the excitement will be
due to a number of new recruits.
Topping the list of talented but
untested newcomers are freshman
long jumper James Lofton, and
pole vaulter Bob Flint, a transfer

student from Fresno City College.
Lofton, a high-school football
All-American, won the California
state long jump championship last
year with a jump of 24 feet 4\h
inches.
Flint won the state junior
college pole vault championship
with a vault of 16-6 I A.
Among the veterans Jordan
sees depth.
Lots Of Depth
"For the first time in 10 years
we won't have to overwork people
and ask them to get into too
many events," he said. "We'll have
the flexibility that's been absent
here awhile."
Heading the list of sprinters are
sophomores Marvin Holmes and
Scott Wingo, and freshmen Alan
Sheats and Otto Rossner. Wingo
and Sheats will also run on the
440 and mile relay teams.
The Cards should have one of
the best hurdling crews in the

conference, led by Pac-8 440
intermediate hurdles champion
Matt Hogsett.
"Hogsett is certainly one of the
best intermediate hurdlers in the
nation," Jordan said, "and Dave
Bagshaw and John Foster give us
an outstanding one-two punch in
the 120 highs."
Dominate Distances
Stanford should also continue
its dominance of the conference
in distance events. In the team
time trials two weeks ago seven
distance men finished under 4:19
in the mile. Tony Sandoval, Mark
McConnell, Jack Bellah and Steve
Crowley lead the Card
lung-busters. Bellah will double in
the steeplechase.
The Cards are well-set in the
half mile with Ben Scheible, Jim

Bourdoini and newcomer Mark
Hadley, who ran a 1:52.6 half in
high school.
