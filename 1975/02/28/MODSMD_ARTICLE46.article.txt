## Hockey Is Not A Killer... 
### Dan Pyne 
It is dangerous to try to follow
in Glenn Garvin's footsteps. In
fact, it is dangerous to try to
follow Glenn Garvin at all,
considering his immense
popularity. But I suppose that in
assuming the responsibility for
this column I face inevitable
comparison with my predecessor.
And I fear that it is the
Garvin-haters who will miss
Garvin the most. All I ask is that
you send no bombs.
Fred "The Fog" Shemo, coach
of the Philadelphia Flyers, said
recently of plans to control
violence in professional hockey,
"There never has been a death
attributed to a hockey fight. Why
don't they write about the good
things for a change?"
Sure Fred.
Pro hockey is not a killing
sport.
Maiming, assaulting,
bludgeoning, de-toothing and
disemboweling maybe, but not
killing.
Consider the plight of poor
Dave Forbes. On Jan. 4, Forbes
was playing in a game against the
highly impotent Minnesota North
Stars. Early in the first period he
chased the puck and Minnesota's
Henry Boucha against the boards
and, like any good hockey player,
Forbes let Boucha have it with a
couple of elbows. Boucha turned
and flattened Forbes. Both were
sent to the penalty box, where
they traded well-chosen insults
and threats.
When the penalties expired,
Boucha headed back for the
Minnesota bench, but Forbes was
not through. With some allegedly
melodramatic statement like "OK,
let's go now," he came up on the
right of Boucha and took a swing
at him with his gloved right hand.
He missed, but the stick he was
holding didn't. Boucha collapsed

like a sack of potatoes, holding his
head, and Forbes, deciding to add
injury to insult, jumped on him
and punched him until
Minnesota's Murray Oliver broke
it up.
Forbes and the Bruins
protested that it was just
one-of-those-things~that-hap
pens-now-and-again, but NHL
President Clarence Campbell
suspended Forbes for 10 games
without pay. Campbell called it
"one of the most vicious incidents
I have ever been called upon to
deal with."
For his role as the victim,
Boucha received double-vision, 25
stitches and minor surgery as well
as a stretcher-ride off the ice.
A Hennepin County (Minn.)
grand jury thought Forbes
deserved more for his efforts, so
they indicted him for aggravated
assault with a dangerous weapon.
Boston howled in dismay.
Commented Harry Sinden of the
Bruins, "They're treating the kid
like John Dillinger." If convicted,
Forbes faces a mandatory
three-year prison sentence.
The charge, needless to say, has
thrown the NHL into an outrage.
Most, including Campbell, claim
civil authorities are not equipped
to deal with this type of incident.
If they're not, one wonders
who is.
This is not the first incident of
its kind. Five years ago Wayne
Maki of the St. Louis Blues reared
back in the course of a fracus and
almost successfully de-brained
Ted Green of Boston with the
butt end of his stick. Ottowa
police swore out charges against
both players, but each was found
not guilty by separate judges, one
of whom said, "Hockey cannot be
played without what normally are
called assaults."
The Forbes incident is the
culmination of the two most
violent years in professional ice
hockey history, and serves as a
warning that there is a fine line
between aggressiveness and
aggression.
Part of the wave of violence
could be due to the success of the
stick-swinging, fist-checking,
Stanley Cup champion
Philadelphia Flyers. Led by
toothless (and mindless) Bobby
Clarke, the Flyers are not bad
hockey players, but they prefer to
win by disabling their opponents.
Their chief hatchet-man is Dave
"Hammer" Shultz, who led the

league in penalty-minutes last
year, but Clarke set a
personal-high 18 minutes in the
box this year in a game in which
he speared his close friend Rod
Seiling of Toronto.
Clarke explained afterward, "I
speared him, I pole-axed him and
I cut him close to the eye. Things
like that happen in the heat of the
game, I'm afraid..."
But in defense of Clarke and
his gang of hoodlums, most of the
violence is due to the NHL's
persistent refusal to clean up the
league.
Says Campbell, "People keep
telling us that we are teaching kids
to poke each other's eyes out, but
I feel that is hardly the case. In
the end the trial judge has
ultimate jurisdiction, and I'm sure
he will look at the total picture,
the same way the judges did in
Ottowa."
In other words, Henry Boucha
didn't lose his eye, and Maki and

It fits, I suppose, with
everyone's image of ice hockey as
a game played by scarred
ex-convicts with glazed eyes arid
broken noses and who have a hard
time pronouncing linoleum. Yet
hockey is a game that can be
played with finesse by intelligent
beings. Ken Dryden is an excellent
example. Or Bobby Orr. Or Stan
Mikita.
Forbes will probably be
acquitted when his trial comes up
after the season has ended. But
sooner or later, if league rules
don't crack down on this new
crop of violence, someone is going
to get convicted for something,
and hockey will be on the road to
Folsom Prison, to be played by
scarred convicts with glazed eyes
and broken noses and who have a
hard time pronouncing linoleum.


Green didn't kill each other, so
things aren't all that bad,
la-dee-dah.
