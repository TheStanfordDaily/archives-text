Levi: FBI Kept Derogatory Files
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi confirmed
yesterday that the late J. Edgar Hoover filed derogatory
information about presidents and congressmen in his FBI
office.
In an appearance before a House Judiciary
subcommittee, Levi also cited cases in which he said the
FBI was used by presidents and White House aides for
political purposes.
Levi said the FBI now has six-and-a-half million files,
including 1605 involving congressmen.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Lawrence Silberman told newsmen
that the misuse of the agency included investigation of
congressional critics for former Presidents Richard M.
Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson and political work for
Johnson.
Levi said that Hoover kept in his office 48 files that
included derogatory information on officials, including
presidents and 17 congressmen, two of whom are still in
Congress.
In the most detailed public airing yet, Levi, FBI Director
Clarence M. Kelley and Silberman also said that derogatory
material has been given to congressmen to use against other
congressmen.
House Kills Depletion Allowanee
WASHINGTON — The House passed a $21.3 billion
economic emergency tax cut bill last night after taking the
historic step of attaching to it an amendment which would
kill the controversial petroleum depletion allowance.
The vote was 317 to 97.
The legislation now goes to the Senate, where it could
run into trouble from oil-state forces opposing the oil
depletion provision.
Passage of the bill came just minutes after the House
rejected by 251-160 a Republican-backed alternative tax
cut proposal which would have lumped $12.2 billion into a
1974 tax rebate, instead of the bill's blend of 1974 tax
rebates and 1975 tax cuts.
Earlier, by a vote of 248 to 163, the House accepted a
proposal by Rep. William J. Green (D-Pa.) which would
abolish the famous 22 percent petroleum depletion
allowance, retroactive to the start of this year.
Demoerats Propose Energy Program
WASHINGTON — A panel of congressional Democrats
reached agreement on an energy program yesterday, and
President Ford agreed to discuss it with Democratic leaders
today.
The program, designed as an alternative to Ford's energy
conservation plan, would raise the gasoline tax by five cents
a gallon and reward motorists who buy fuel-efficient cars.
The caucus of all Senate Democrats quickly adopted it
and instructed Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield to
seek a meeting between Ford and congressional Democrats

in an effort to reach a compromise on a national energy
policy.
Mansfield said Ford agreed to a meeting at the White
House this afternoon with six Democratic leaders.
The proposed Democratic program is based on the
assumption that it is more important to fight recession than
to reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil.
Eeoriomie Index Seores Another Drop
WASHINGTON — The government index designed to
predict future economic trends plunged in January, the
sixth consecutive month the statistical crystal ball forecast
financial gloom.
The Commerce Department said the drop in January
registered 1.3 percent for a six-month decline totaling 12.6
percent, a record.
It marked the first six-month fall since the 1957-58
recession, when the cumulative index fell nine percent.
Judjje Rejeets Trial For Ray
MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A federal judge refused yesterday to
allow James Earl Ray to withdraw his guilty plea and stand
trial on charges that he murdered Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert M. Mcßae Jr. found
that none of Ray's constitutional rights were violated in the
events leading up to the guilty plea in 1969.
Ray's attorney said he plans to appeal yesterday's
decision to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Ray is serving a 99-year term in the state prison at
Nashville. He has waged a legal battle, almost from the day
he started his prison term, to obtain a trial he avoided when
he pleaded guilty and accepted the sentence on March 10,
1969.
Oakland Prostitution Law Overturned
OAKLAND — A Superior Court judge ruled yesterday
for the first time in California that a prostitution ordinance
is unconstitutional because the women and their customers
"are not treated equally."
The customer should be subjected to the same citation,
arrest and quarantine procedures as the prostitute, Judge
Spurgeon Avakian said, issuing a preliminary injunction
prohibiting enforcement of the Oakland prostitution
ordinance.
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Condit said the city would
comply with the order but probably will ask a state appeals
court to overturn the decision.
Today's Weather
Increasing cloudiness today with chance of rain in the
afternoon. Rain likely at times tonight and tomorrow.
Slightly cooler tomorrow. Lows tonight in mid 40s to low
50s. Highs today in upper 50s to mid 60s and tomorrow in
mid 50s to low 60s.

It marked the first six-month fall since the 1957-58
recession, when the cumulative index fell nine percent.
Judjje Rejeets Trial For Ray
MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A federal judge refused yesterday to
allow James Earl Ray to withdraw his guilty plea and stand
trial on charges that he murdered Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert M. Mcßae Jr. found
that none of Ray's constitutional rights were violated in the
events leading up to the guilty plea in 1969.
Ray's attorney said he plans to appeal yesterday's
decision to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Ray is serving a 99-year term in the state prison at
Nashville. He has waged a legal battle, almost from the day
he started his prison term, to obtain a trial he avoided when
he pleaded guilty and accepted the sentence on March 10,
1969.
Oakland Prostitution Law Overturned
OAKLAND — A Superior Court judge ruled yesterday
for the first time in California that a prostitution ordinance
is unconstitutional because the women and their customers
"are not treated equally."
The customer should be subjected to the same citation,
arrest and quarantine procedures as the prostitute, Judge
Spurgeon Avakian said, issuing a preliminary injunction
prohibiting enforcement of the Oakland prostitution
ordinance.
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Condit said the city would
comply with the order but probably will ask a state appeals
court to overturn the decision.
Today's Weather

mid 50s to low 60s.
Levi: FBI Kept Derogatory Files
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi confirmed
yesterday that the late J. Edgar Hoover filed derogatory
information about presidents and congressmen in his FBI
office.
In an appearance before a House Judiciary
subcommittee, Levi also cited cases in which he said the
FBI was used by presidents and White House aides for
political purposes.
Levi said the FBI now has six-and-a-half million files,
including 1605 involving congressmen.
Deputy Atty. Gen. Lawrence Silberman told newsmen
that the misuse of the agency included investigation of
congressional critics for former Presidents Richard M.
Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson and political work for
Johnson.
Levi said that Hoover kept in his office 48 files that
included derogatory information on officials, including
presidents and 17 congressmen, two of whom are still in
Congress.
In the most detailed public airing yet, Levi, FBI Director
Clarence M. Kelley and Silberman also said that derogatory
material has been given to congressmen to use against other
congressmen.
House Kills Depletion Allowanee
WASHINGTON — The House passed a $21.3 billion
economic emergency tax cut bill last night after taking the
historic step of attaching to it an amendment which would
kill the controversial petroleum depletion allowance.
The vote was 317 to 97.
The legislation now goes to the Senate, where it could
run into trouble from oil-state forces opposing the oil
depletion provision.
Passage of the bill came just minutes after the House
rejected by 251-160 a Republican-backed alternative tax
cut proposal which would have lumped $12.2 billion into a
1974 tax rebate, instead of the bill's blend of 1974 tax
rebates and 1975 tax cuts.
Earlier, by a vote of 248 to 163, the House accepted a
proposal by Rep. William J. Green (D-Pa.) which would
abolish the famous 22 percent petroleum depletion
allowance, retroactive to the start of this year.
Demoerats Propose Energy Program
WASHINGTON — A panel of congressional Democrats
reached agreement on an energy program yesterday, and
President Ford agreed to discuss it with Democratic leaders
today.
The program, designed as an alternative to Ford's energy
conservation plan, would raise the gasoline tax by five cents
a gallon and reward motorists who buy fuel-efficient cars.
The caucus of all Senate Democrats quickly adopted it
and instructed Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield to
seek a meeting between Ford and congressional Democrats

in an effort to reach a compromise on a national energy
policy.
Mansfield said Ford agreed to a meeting at the White
House this afternoon with six Democratic leaders.
The proposed Democratic program is based on the
assumption that it is more important to fight recession than
to reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil.
Eeoriomie Index Seores Another Drop
WASHINGTON — The government index designed to
predict future economic trends plunged in January, the
sixth consecutive month the statistical crystal ball forecast
financial gloom.
The Commerce Department said the drop in January
registered 1.3 percent for a six-month decline totaling 12.6
percent, a record.
It marked the first six-month fall since the 1957-58

The vote was 317 to 97.
The legislation now goes to the Senate, where it could
run into trouble from oil-state forces opposing the oil
depletion provision.
Passage of the bill came just minutes after the House
rejected by 251-160 a Republican-backed alternative tax
cut proposal which would have lumped $12.2 billion into a
1974 tax rebate, instead of the bill's blend of 1974 tax
rebates and 1975 tax cuts.
Earlier, by a vote of 248 to 163, the House accepted a
proposal by Rep. William J. Green (D-Pa.) which would
abolish the famous 22 percent petroleum depletion
allowance, retroactive to the start of this year.
Demoerats Propose Energy Program
WASHINGTON — A panel of congressional Democrats
reached agreement on an energy program yesterday, and
President Ford agreed to discuss it with Democratic leaders
today.
The program, designed as an alternative to Ford's energy
conservation plan, would raise the gasoline tax by five cents
a gallon and reward motorists who buy fuel-efficient cars.
The caucus of all Senate Democrats quickly adopted it
and instructed Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield to
seek a meeting between Ford and congressional Democrats

in an effort to reach a compromise on a national energy
policy.
Mansfield said Ford agreed to a meeting at the White
House this afternoon with six Democratic leaders.
The proposed Democratic program is based on the
assumption that it is more important to fight recession than
to reduce U.S. reliance on imported oil.
Eeoriomie Index Seores Another Drop
WASHINGTON — The government index designed to
predict future economic trends plunged in January, the
sixth consecutive month the statistical crystal ball forecast
financial gloom.
The Commerce Department said the drop in January
registered 1.3 percent for a six-month decline totaling 12.6
percent, a record.
It marked the first six-month fall since the 1957-58
recession, when the cumulative index fell nine percent.
Judjje Rejeets Trial For Ray
MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A federal judge refused yesterday to
allow James Earl Ray to withdraw his guilty plea and stand
trial on charges that he murdered Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert M. Mcßae Jr. found
that none of Ray's constitutional rights were violated in the
events leading up to the guilty plea in 1969.
Ray's attorney said he plans to appeal yesterday's
decision to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Ray is serving a 99-year term in the state prison at
Nashville. He has waged a legal battle, almost from the day
he started his prison term, to obtain a trial he avoided when
he pleaded guilty and accepted the sentence on March 10,
1969.
Oakland Prostitution Law Overturned
OAKLAND — A Superior Court judge ruled yesterday
for the first time in California that a prostitution ordinance
is unconstitutional because the women and their customers
"are not treated equally."
The customer should be subjected to the same citation,
arrest and quarantine procedures as the prostitute, Judge
Spurgeon Avakian said, issuing a preliminary injunction
prohibiting enforcement of the Oakland prostitution
ordinance.
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Condit said the city would
comply with the order but probably will ask a state appeals
court to overturn the decision.
