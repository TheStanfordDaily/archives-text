# Undergraduate Voters Nix 'No Credit' Marks
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Undergraduates voted overwhelmingly to disagree with a proposal reinstating
both firm drop deadlines and the "no credit" notation on transcripts in the
special ASSU referendum held yesterday and Wednesday.
With a surprisingly heavy turnout of 2516 students or 40 percent, undergrads
narrowly disapproved of recommendations to restrict the incomplete grade and
approved authorizing the Registrar's Office to regularly collect and make public
grade distributions in various schools.
Students also agreed that the Registrar's Office should widely publicize the
final date for choosing the pass option.
The referendum was spurred by student criticism of the proposed changes in
the grading system as recommended by the Ad Hoc Panel to Study the Grading

System, a subcommittee of the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA).
The election, limited to
undergraduates, came just two weeks
before the full C-AAA is expected to
report to the Faculty Senate.
Referendum supporters said earlier
they hoped the turnout would be
heavy enough and one-sided enough to
influence the final Faculty Senate
decision. Referendum spokesmen and
Faculty Senate Chairman Gordon
Craig were unavailable for comment
last night.
Undergrads voted 334 "agree" (13
percent) to 2138 "disagree" (85
percent) with 40 "undecided' (2
percent) on the panel's
recommendation to reinstate jointly
drop deadlines for courses and the "no
credit" (NC) notation for either
unauthorized withdrawal from a
course or unsatisfactory performance
in a course.
Students voted 1200 "agree" (47
percent) to 1219 "disagree" (48
percent) with 128 "undecided" (5
percent) on the proposal to restrict the
incomplete grade to cases where the
student has completed a substantial
portion of the course work at passing
level.
On other recommendations,
undergrads turned out 1166 "agree"
(46.5 percent) to 1151 (46.0 percent)
with 191 "undecided" (7.5 percent)
on the proposal to have the registrar
regularly collect and make public
grade distributions in the various
schools of the University.
Students also voted 1646 "agree"
(66 percent) to 736 "disagree" (19
percent) with 119 "undecided" (5
percent) on the suggestion to have the
Registrar's Office widely publicize the
approach of each quarter's final date
for choosing the pass option.
Asst. ASSU Financial Manager Tom
Fitzgerald, serving as elections
commissioner, termed the voter
turnout "pretty good," adding that
the totals "exceeded everybody's
expectations."

Undergraduates voted overwhelmingly to disagree with a proposal reinstating
both firm drop deadlines and the "no credit" notation on transcripts in the
special ASSU referendum held yesterday and Wednesday.
With a surprisingly heavy turnout of 2516 students or 40 percent, undergrads
narrowly disapproved of recommendations to restrict the incomplete grade and
approved authorizing the Registrar's Office to regularly collect and make public
grade distributions in various schools.
Students also agreed that the Registrar's Office should widely publicize the
final date for choosing the pass option.
The referendum was spurred by student criticism of the proposed changes in
the grading system as recommended by the Ad Hoc Panel to Study the Grading

System, a subcommittee of the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA).
The election, limited to
undergraduates, came just two weeks
before the full C-AAA is expected to
report to the Faculty Senate.
Referendum supporters said earlier
they hoped the turnout would be
heavy enough and one-sided enough to
influence the final Faculty Senate
decision. Referendum spokesmen and
Faculty Senate Chairman Gordon
Craig were unavailable for comment
last night.
Undergrads voted 334 "agree" (13
percent) to 2138 "disagree" (85
percent) with 40 "undecided' (2
percent) on the panel's
recommendation to reinstate jointly
drop deadlines for courses and the "no
credit" (NC) notation for either
unauthorized withdrawal from a
course or unsatisfactory performance
in a course.
Students voted 1200 "agree" (47
percent) to 1219 "disagree" (48
percent) with 128 "undecided" (5
percent) on the proposal to restrict the
incomplete grade to cases where the
student has completed a substantial
portion of the course work at passing
level.
On other recommendations,
undergrads turned out 1166 "agree"
(46.5 percent) to 1151 (46.0 percent)
with 191 "undecided" (7.5 percent)
on the proposal to have the registrar
regularly collect and make public
grade distributions in the various
schools of the University.
Students also voted 1646 "agree"
(66 percent) to 736 "disagree" (19
percent) with 119 "undecided" (5
percent) on the suggestion to have the
Registrar's Office widely publicize the
approach of each quarter's final date
for choosing the pass option.
Asst. ASSU Financial Manager Tom
Fitzgerald, serving as elections
commissioner, termed the voter
turnout "pretty good," adding that
the totals "exceeded everybody's
expectations."
