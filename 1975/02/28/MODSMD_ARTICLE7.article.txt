# Farenthold: Women Lack Real Power

A caste society exists in any "rigid
social system" and has "the
unmistakable characteristics of racism
and sexism," Frances "Sissy"
Farenthold said in a speech before an
audience of 80 at Cubberley
Auditorium last night.
Farenthold is the head of the
National Women's Political Caucus, a
former Texas legislator and twice
candidate for governor of that state.
She said racism and sexism are
characterized by force and violence
and she believes "in part, that change
can come through awareness" of these
characteristics.
"We've lived with myths so long and
have just begun to question them," she
said, adding that bringing feminine
values into the power structure may
facilitate change. She charged that few
women are in positions of real power
in our society.
Women are anxious to participate in
government, Farenthold claimed.
"They are just as good intentioned but
just as powerless as they were in
1943."
Political Charade
"Women participate in the charade
of politics," but many are are not
taken seriously, she claimed. "You
need more training and qualifications
to even be on par with the male
candidates."
"If you have no power you're
willing or more keenly conscious of
the need for reform," she said.
Farenthold theorized that women in
government might be able to function
as a bridge to minorities.
Now, however, women are forced to
play the "numbers game," counting
how many women are in positions of
power throughout the country, she
said. "I personally weary of being a
professional woman and would like to
move on to more substantial issues."
Three Key Words
Farenthold cited three key words
for the political process: "awareness,
assertiveness and audacity," and said
they are essential characteristics for
women in politics. "Unfortunately,"
she said, "we haven't got much else."
Farenthold concluded by saying the
would like to see the day "when she
'unqualified' blacks, the 'unqualified'
browns and the 'unqualified' women
join the 'unqualified' white men in the
pursuit and holding of public office."
