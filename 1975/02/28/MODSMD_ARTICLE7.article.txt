# Farenthold: Women Lack Real Power
## 
### PATRICIA CLAPPISON 
A caste society exists in any "rigid
social system" and has "the
unmistakable characteristics of racism
and sexism," Frances "Sissy"
Farenthold said in a speech before an
audience of 80 at Cubberley
Auditorium last night.
Farenthold is the head of the
National Women's Political Caucus, a
former Texas legislator and twice
candidate for governor of that state.
She said racism and sexism are
characterized by force and violence
and she believes "in part, that change
can come through awareness" of these
characteristics.
"We've lived with myths so long and
have just begun to question them," she
said, adding that bringing feminine
values into the power structure may
facilitate change. She charged that few
women are in positions of real power
in our society.
Women are anxious to participate in
government, Farenthold claimed.
"They are just as good intentioned but
just as powerless as they were in
1943."
Political Charade
"Women participate in the charade
of politics," but many are are not
taken seriously, she claimed. "You
need more training and qualifications
to even be on par with the male
candidates."
"If you have no power you're
willing or more keenly conscious of
the need for reform," she said.
Farenthold theorized that women in
government might be able to function
as a bridge to minorities.
Now, however, women are forced to
play the "numbers game," counting
how many women are in positions of
power throughout the country, she
said. "I personally weary of being a
professional woman and would like to
move on to more substantial issues."
Three Key Words
Farenthold cited three key words
for the political process: "awareness,
assertiveness and audacity," and said
they are essential characteristics for
women in politics. "Unfortunately,"
she said, "we haven't got much else."
Farenthold concluded by saying the
would like to see the day "when she
'unqualified' blacks, the 'unqualified'
browns and the 'unqualified' women
join the 'unqualified' white men in the
pursuit and holding of public office."
Farenthold came to the women's
movement through politics. She is also
a practicing attorney and a lecturer in
law at the University of Houston.
Noticed Issues
Through politics she noticed that
issues suffering a lack of attention are
ones which lack the people's interest
because "to reflect values of racism
and sexism is to be normal in our
society," Farenthold said.
In a press conference yesterday,
Farenthold confirmed her sponsorship
of the Committee for Justice for Huey
P. Newton.
She said she was impressed by
Newton when she met him personally,
and wanted justice to be done in his
case. She quoted Newton as saying,
"Justice ought to take that blindfold
off and see what's being done in their
[sic] name."
Farenthold claimed that some
information in Black Panther
newspapers never appears in
white-owned papers, and as a sidelight
noted that she gets better coverage in
newspapers outside of her home state.
Also at the press conference,
Farenthold described two strands of
the women's movement, one that
rights for women is a matter of human

justice, the other that women have a
greater social conscience and would
therefore make better political
representatives. Irregardless, she said,
women have "as much right to be in
there and make the same mistakes."
Women's disinclination to join
associations after being brought up
isolated was another target of
Farenthold's. Such disinterest
transmits itself to political parties,
which are essential to politics, she said.
Much resistance to women exists in
her own Democratic party, Farenthold
claimed. Party reform is thus a priority
of the women's movement, she said.
Because of the party structure's
resistance, Farenthold said, "we never
know today we will lose
tomorrow. It's one step forward and
two steps back" often for the
movement.
At the press conference Farenthold
was also asked if the National
Women's Political Caucus ever
endorsed male political candidates.
Farenthold said that in the charter of
the women's caucus she heads, it is
stated that it will give endorsement
"to individrals who oppose racism,
sexism, and institutionalized values,"
whether they are male or female.
