## Endorsements 
### 
On Tuesday, the Stanford community will get an opportunity to
vote for members of various school district governing boards in the
area. While the turnout for such elections at Stanford is generally nil,
we feel it is important for students as well as others to help determine
the directions local school systems will take, especially since
University taxes help support those functions. Accordingly, we have
endorsed the candidates we feel are best qualified.
PALO ALTO UNI FIED SCHOOL DISTRICT... JOSHUA GOLDSTEIN
iU - Of the four candidates in the race, Joshua Goldstein is the only
Strong supporter of the concept of neighborhood schools. Goldstein
advocates programs for senior citizens, child care centers and an
expanded adult education program. These programs would all be of
great benefit to the community. Goldstein,22, spent 12 years in Palo
Alto schools, so he has first-hand knowledge of student needs.
While we're somewhat skeptical of Goldstein's assertion that such
programs could "pay for themselves," we note he has formulated a
plan to reduce the budget. Goldstein's plan would cut back on capital
expenditures, reduce administration and close one junior high school.
FOOTHILL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT . ..
ANDREW M.COHEN, THOMAS FRANKUM, L. DOUGLAS SMITH. Jr.
In this race, six challengers are seeking to unseat three incumbents.
While we note that Foothill is one of the finest community college
districts in the United States, we believe the district would be best
served by the infusion of new people and ideas.
Cohen, a 1968 graduate of Stanford Law School, supports increased
vocational education and seems genuinely interested in soliciting
community input.
Frankum opposes what he calls "high handed" policies of the
board in dealing with local governments in recent years. He also favors
more vocational education.
Smith, a psychologist, is particularly concerned in the role of the
community college in providing continuing education for adults, as
well as vocational education.
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION . . . MARY HAMILTON
Mary Hamilton, a recent Foothill student body president, stresses
citizen input in school board decisions and wants the gap between
high schools and the outside world reduced. Her opponent, incumbent
Harry Kallshian, favors increased concern for the children of migrant
workers, as does Hamilton. We hope that Kallshian will, if re-elected,
follow through on this stand.
PALO ALTO SCHOOL DISTRICT PROPOSITION ... YES
This measure asks whether the citizens of Palo Alto will authorize
expenditure per pupil above the state ceiling for such expenditure.
Without approval, the Palo Alto School District would be forced to
cut back many of its innovative programs all at once rather than faze
them out gradually as it now plans.

them out gradually as it now plans.
On Tuesday, the Stanford community will get an opportunity to
vote for members of various school district governing boards in the
area. While the turnout for such elections at Stanford is generally nil,
we feel it is important for students as well as others to help determine
the directions local school systems will take, especially since
University taxes help support those functions. Accordingly, we have
endorsed the candidates we feel are best qualified.
PALO ALTO UNI FIED SCHOOL DISTRICT... JOSHUA GOLDSTEIN
iU - Of the four candidates in the race, Joshua Goldstein is the only
Strong supporter of the concept of neighborhood schools. Goldstein
advocates programs for senior citizens, child care centers and an
expanded adult education program. These programs would all be of
great benefit to the community. Goldstein,22, spent 12 years in Palo
Alto schools, so he has first-hand knowledge of student needs.
While we're somewhat skeptical of Goldstein's assertion that such
programs could "pay for themselves," we note he has formulated a
plan to reduce the budget. Goldstein's plan would cut back on capital
expenditures, reduce administration and close one junior high school.
FOOTHILL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT . ..
ANDREW M.COHEN, THOMAS FRANKUM, L. DOUGLAS SMITH. Jr.
In this race, six challengers are seeking to unseat three incumbents.
While we note that Foothill is one of the finest community college
districts in the United States, we believe the district would be best
served by the infusion of new people and ideas.
Cohen, a 1968 graduate of Stanford Law School, supports increased
vocational education and seems genuinely interested in soliciting
community input.
Frankum opposes what he calls "high handed" policies of the
board in dealing with local governments in recent years. He also favors
more vocational education.
Smith, a psychologist, is particularly concerned in the role of the
community college in providing continuing education for adults, as
well as vocational education.
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION . . . MARY HAMILTON
Mary Hamilton, a recent Foothill student body president, stresses
citizen input in school board decisions and wants the gap between
high schools and the outside world reduced. Her opponent, incumbent
Harry Kallshian, favors increased concern for the children of migrant
workers, as does Hamilton. We hope that Kallshian will, if re-elected,
follow through on this stand.
PALO ALTO SCHOOL DISTRICT PROPOSITION ... YES
This measure asks whether the citizens of Palo Alto will authorize
expenditure per pupil above the state ceiling for such expenditure.
Without approval, the Palo Alto School District would be forced to
cut back many of its innovative programs all at once rather than faze
them out gradually as it now plans.
