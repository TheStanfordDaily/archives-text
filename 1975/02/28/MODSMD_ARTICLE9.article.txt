# What Is Equality?

### 
Please tell Jim Wascher before
he castigates affirmative action
programs in columns such as
"Minority Privileges
Discriminatory?" (Daily, Feb.
24), that he talk to someone
knowledgeable about the subject.
Affirmative action means that
institutions must affirmatively
look for minorities and women to
remedy past discriminatory
practices. The liberals of 1968
implemented the current
ypdergraduate admissions and
financial aids policies with this
goal in mind.
Affirmative action seeks to
utilize goals and time tables to
bring up to par the recruitment
of minorities in relation to their
labor or population force. It
offers relief to people denied
entry to various fields.
As Henry Der, executive
director of Chinese for
Affirmative Action, has stated:
"It's no different than if you were
in a car accident and you asked
for punitive damages and money
for emotional pain and suffering."
Affirmative action does not
stipulate a lowering of
qualifications. It does not mean
looking for the qualified. It
assumes that the ability to acquire
the necessary skills and expertise
in a reasonable time is all that is
needed.
Says Armando Cabezas of
Asian American Service Institute
for Assistance to Neighborhoods,
"A claim that 'the best qualified
be hired' is errant in that it
perpetuates the problem of
discrimination."
Affirmative action means that

traditional channels. It means
going out affirmatively to the
people who have direct contact
with minorities to correct the
problem of disparity.
Treating all low-income people
the same is a lazy, catch-all
formula. It pays lip service to
equality, but it fails to deal
critically with the problems of
race and ethnicity.
I found it doubly offensive
that Wascher cited the
accomplishments of Stanford civil
rights workers — as if that
somehow vindicates his own lack
of sensitivity.
The minority financial aids
issue ultimately boils down to
"Who gets to come here?" Using
the minority/non-minority trade
off obfuscates the issue and only
serves to divide the student body
further.
The tactic has been used
before. From the 1870s to the
turn of the century,
Chinese-Americans were targets of
the Knights of Labor and other
white labor organizations'
anti-Chinese campaigns. Very
little violence was directed against
the real sources of exploitation —
Leland Stanford, for one.
Maybe all this isn't new to
Wascher, but in a university where
a Thai-student, IM soccer team
can be labeled a bunch of
"chinks," it doesn't surprise me at
all.
P.S. Shuck and jive.

in political science, is a member of
the Stanford Asian Students
Coordinating Committee.)
