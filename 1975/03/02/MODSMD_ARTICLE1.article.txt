# New Group Examines Undergrad Education
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Possible changes in undergraduate
distribution requirements,
extradepartmental courses and ways of
increasing faculty interest in
undergraduate education are targets of
the recently formed Committee on the
Reform and Renewal of Liberal
Education at Stanford (CRR).
Conducting the first general review
of undergraduate education here since
the three-year Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) report in 1969, the
Committee is set to report its
suggestions "by the end of spring
quarter," according to committee
member Eileen Serene, assistant
professor of philosophy.
The committee is chaired by Assoc.
Religious Studies Prof. Lee Yearley.
A basic question facing the
Committee is "how to provide a sound
... curriculum under conditions of
severe financial constraint and without
increasing .. . faculty," its charge
states.
The group also will study ways to
maintain a "central position of
educational curriculum in a time of
strong undergraduate interest in
pre-professional training," according
to the charge.
Royden Selected
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Halsey Royden, who selected the
Committee following consultation with
President Richard Lyman (both will
serve on the group), said that its
initiation was "prompted by concern
for what students receive for
education outside their major."
Calling the present distribution and
course planning system "chaotic,"
Royden said that "when we loosened
up the requirements [as a result of
SES], we tended to lose many of the
structured courses. My view is that
that change went too far."
Royden emphasized, "We must
maintain a great deal of flexibility, but
I think that .. . students who are well
informed as to what they can study
are in the minority, and that a number

of the rest want more structure in
their education."
Provide Choices
Asst. Humanities and Sciences Dean
Sally Monfort, who will serve as the
principal staff support for the
committee, stated that the view of
some Committee members was that
"specific choices within a particular
field [i.e., humanities, sciences, social
sciences] would be provided for the
new student. [The University]
wouldn't necessarily be giving
directives, but instead providing
guidelines and protecting flexibility."
Many members of the Committee
favor "coherent sequences" along
the lines of the History 1-2-3 series.
Interdisciplinary courses also are
widely praised.
Chairman Yearley claimed, "There
is now a great deal of randomness in
course selection, and I'm disturbed by
it." He said the University "has a need
and desire to guide the student in that
selection."
'Not Answer'
However, sophomore Chris
Gutierrez, one of two students on the
Committee said, "Requirements aren't
necessarily the answer."
The current distribution
requirement, Serene said, "allows for a
lot of independence. Some students
use that independence wisely."
She added, "I think that proposals
for change in the requirements are
often prompted by frustration or
unhappiness at students' misuse of
their course selection freedom."
However she said she would be
"unhappy at this point to see students
lose a significant part of that freedom
on the grounds that some students
have not [ used it wisely ]."
Yearley said that the CRR
suggestions will be given to the
Academic Senate following review by
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. "I would find it difficult to
believe that anything substantial in
terms of change would be in effect
next year," he said.
