The local elections tomorrow are going to be
interesting and important from a student point of
view. There are three different races (Palo Alto
School Board, Foothill College Trustee, and
County Board of Education) with a total of five
seats open as well as a measure for a revenue limit
increase for the Palo Alto School District.
While the revenue limit increase is important, it
is the five seats on the various boards that should
be of real interest to students throughout the
northern part of Santa Clara County.
There is one seat open on the Palo Alto School
District Board. Joshua Goldstein, who spent 12
years in the Palo Alto school system, is running a
very strong campaign for the empty seat. Last year
he came in a close second against the incumbent.
This year, with no incumbent running, he is given
good odds to gather the necessary votes. His
campaign is important because he brings a very
fresh and a very different perspective to the board.
A notable aspect about his campaigns both last
year and this year is the strong support he receives
from students in the Palo Alto system. Since
Goldstein graduated from Gunn High just five years
ago, he has been active in a number of
projects involving students.
It is sad but true that often those for whom the
system is theoretically created don't have any say
in how it is run. Goldstein will change that.
A very similar thing is happening in reference to
the three seats open on the Foothill Junior College
Board of Trustees. Andrew Cohen was asked by a
number of Foothill students to run so that the
board might begin to consider the student
perspective.
Andrew Cohen is an attorney who got to know

Gordon Wheat

many students when he represented the student
government against the Board of Trustees a few
years ago. He is critical of the priorities the Board
has been setting as well as the fact that many
people agree that student-Board relations are
terrible. It is not surprising that students don't
think highly of a board that spent $870,000 to
relocate 300 parking spaces closer to the Flint
Center while at the same time it couldn't spend
$6000 for minority counseling. It is not surprising
that there are now a number of discrimination suits
pending against the district.
Both Raj Prasad, a public school administrator,
and Thomas Frankum, a Palo Alto teacher, are
considered to be both more open-minded and
competent than any of the incumbents running for
re-election. Foothill and De Anza College student
support for them is also strong.
The race for the local seat on the County Board
of Education is a relatively simple one. Mary
Hamilton, an ex-student body president of
Foothill, is running against the incumbent who was
appointed three years ago.
Although it has a large budget that includes such
luxuries as a gigantic computer and a TV station, the
Board's effect on the individual level has not been
very great because of a lack of community imput
and the complacency of the present board. These
are just the things Hamilton wants to change.
So in all the races on the ballot tomorrow there
will be strong capable candidates who can and will
represent the perspective and interests of the
student.

from students in the Palo Alto system. Since
Goldstein graduated from Gunn High just five years
ago, he has been active in a number of
projects involving students.
It is sad but true that often those for whom the
system is theoretically created don't have any say
in how it is run. Goldstein will change that.
A very similar thing is happening in reference to
the three seats open on the Foothill Junior College
Board of Trustees. Andrew Cohen was asked by a
number of Foothill students to run so that the
board might begin to consider the student
perspective.

many students when he represented the student
government against the Board of Trustees a few
years ago. He is critical of the priorities the Board
has been setting as well as the fact that many
people agree that student-Board relations are
terrible. It is not surprising that students don't
think highly of a board that spent $870,000 to
relocate 300 parking spaces closer to the Flint
Center while at the same time it couldn't spend
$6000 for minority counseling. It is not surprising
that there are now a number of discrimination suits
pending against the district.
Both Raj Prasad, a public school administrator,
and Thomas Frankum, a Palo Alto teacher, are
considered to be both more open-minded and
competent than any of the incumbents running for
re-election. Foothill and De Anza College student
support for them is also strong.
The race for the local seat on the County Board
of Education is a relatively simple one. Mary
Hamilton, an ex-student body president of
Foothill, is running against the incumbent who was
appointed three years ago.
Although it has a large budget that includes such
luxuries as a gigantic computer and a TV station, the
Board's effect on the individual level has not been
very great because of a lack of community imput
and the complacency of the present board. These
are just the things Hamilton wants to change.
So in all the races on the ballot tomorrow there
will be strong capable candidates who can and will
represent the perspective and interests of the
student.

The local elections tomorrow are going to be
interesting and important from a student point of
view. There are three different races (Palo Alto
School Board, Foothill College Trustee, and
County Board of Education) with a total of five
seats open as well as a measure for a revenue limit
increase for the Palo Alto School District.
While the revenue limit increase is important, it
is the five seats on the various boards that should
be of real interest to students throughout the
northern part of Santa Clara County.
There is one seat open on the Palo Alto School
District Board. Joshua Goldstein, who spent 12
years in the Palo Alto school system, is running a
very strong campaign for the empty seat. Last year
he came in a close second against the incumbent.
This year, with no incumbent running, he is given
good odds to gather the necessary votes. His
campaign is important because he brings a very
fresh and a very different perspective to the board.
A notable aspect about his campaigns both last
year and this year is the strong support he receives
from students in the Palo Alto system. Since
Goldstein graduated from Gunn High just five years
ago, he has been active in a number of
projects involving students.
