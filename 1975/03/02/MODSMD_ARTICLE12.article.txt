# Minority Aid Issue Raises Questions
## 
### Rich Jaroslovsky 
In the highly emotional debate over
minority financial aids, more than a few
crucial points have been, if not ignored, then
deemphasized. And that's a shame, because
all too often, adversaries on both sides — not
to mention commentators on this page —
have failed to come to grips with many of the
real issues involved.
The action urged by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid
— and later adopted, with modifications, by
the Faculty Senate — is deceptively simple. It
basically said that race should be abandoned
as a criterion for financial aid. This would be
most strongly felt, it seems, in the area of
"self-help" — that portion of a student's
budget that he's expected to provide himself,
either through jobs or loans.
Formerly, minority students were
expected to contribute less in the area of
"self-help" - and were thus given
compensating larger scholarships to make up
the difference — than white students in the
same economic bracket. The C-UAFA plan
aimed at minimizing this "preferential
treatment," and, while the Faculty Senate
made some modifications in the plan, it
accepted the bulk of the proposal.
Contradictions
In any event, more than a few questions
still remain either unanswered or answered
by contradicting statements. Among them:
1) Will the aid changes result in any fewer
minority students attending Stanford?
At the Faculty Senate meeting, Dean of
Admissions Fred A. Hargadon was asked if
the shift away from all-scholarship aid for
minority students to combination
scholarship/self-help aid would affect
minority recruitment. His answer: it
wouldn't have a "marked effect."
But among groups protesting the change,
there have been intimations and outright
statements that the switch indicates, if

nothing else, a lack of commitment to
minority admissions by making it more
expensive — and hence more difficult — for
minority students to attend Stanford than it
has been in the past.
And even Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs, in his controversial memo on
the aid plan, noted the danger of "an initial
drop in acceptance by minority students
admitted." He urged steps be taken to insure

that this doesn't happen. Have such steps
been taken?
* Different Mix?
2) Will the aid changes result in a different
kind of minority student being admitted to
Stanford?
In that Gibbs memo ~ much of which he
has never been able to satisfactorily explain
— he suggested that a plan requiring at least
some minority self-help would draw students
"more attuned to the intellectual goals that
we espouse and to the elitist nature" of the
University. More attuned than whom? Than
the "many" minority students currently here
who "spend too much time trying to 'turn
the institution around'...."
This raises more than a few questions
itself. Is what Gibbs says about the aid policy
bringing in a "better mix" of students true?
If so, is financial aids policy a legitimate tool
to use to weed out the kind of student Gibbs
dislikes? Previously, the enunciated

University position has been to accept
it wants, then figure out a way for them to
pay for Stanford. If what Gibbs said is true,
then this would be a way for the University
to accept people it really didn't want, then
discourage their attendance.
3) Will the aid changes result in a larger
number of wealthier minority students
attending Stanford?
This goes hand-in-glove with question
number two. The assumption is often made
— how valid it is, I doubt if anyone really
knows — that the better off one is, the less
likely he is to rock the boat or try to "turn
the institution around."
The fact is that this trend of wealthier
minority students is already in evidence. In
1969-70, for instance, some nine percent of
minority freshmen came from families with
annual incomes of over $15,000. By last fall,
with overall minority admissions increased,
that number had jumped to 27 percent.
Something tells me the minority standard of
living hasn't risen quite that dramatically.
In short, the issue here extends well
beyond the bounds of "preferential
treatment." Linking opponents of the plan
with "reverse discrimination" strikes me as
being almost as silly as linking proponents of
it with Watergate (both have been done).
Such loaded terms and emotionalism do no
one any good.
Rather, the questions still unanswered are
ones of diversity. If you philosophically
accept the ideal of a diversified student body
brought together for a common purpose —
education — as a valid one, you can't help
but wonder if the aids policy change is at
least in part a way of doing something
through the back door — limiting that
diversity — that would be almost universally
condemned were it done through the front.

number of wealthier minority students
attending Stanford?
This goes hand-in-glove with question
number two. The assumption is often made
— how valid it is, I doubt if anyone really
knows — that the better off one is, the less
likely he is to rock the boat or try to "turn
the institution around."
The fact is that this trend of wealthier
minority students is already in evidence. In
1969-70, for instance, some nine percent of
minority freshmen came from families with
annual incomes of over $15,000. By last fall,
with overall minority admissions increased,
that number had jumped to 27 percent.
Something tells me the minority standard of
living hasn't risen quite that dramatically.
In short, the issue here extends well
beyond the bounds of "preferential
treatment." Linking opponents of the plan
with "reverse discrimination" strikes me as
being almost as silly as linking proponents of
it with Watergate (both have been done).
Such loaded terms and emotionalism do no
one any good.
Rather, the questions still unanswered are
ones of diversity. If you philosophically
accept the ideal of a diversified student body
brought together for a common purpose —
education — as a valid one, you can't help
but wonder if the aids policy change is at
least in part a way of doing something
through the back door — limiting that
diversity — that would be almost universally
condemned were it done through the front.

In the highly emotional debate over
minority financial aids, more than a few
crucial points have been, if not ignored, then
deemphasized. And that's a shame, because
all too often, adversaries on both sides — not
to mention commentators on this page —
have failed to come to grips with many of the
real issues involved.
The action urged by the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid
— and later adopted, with modifications, by
the Faculty Senate — is deceptively simple. It
basically said that race should be abandoned
as a criterion for financial aid. This would be
most strongly felt, it seems, in the area of
"self-help" — that portion of a student's
budget that he's expected to provide himself,
either through jobs or loans.
Formerly, minority students were
expected to contribute less in the area of
"self-help" - and were thus given
compensating larger scholarships to make up
the difference — than white students in the
same economic bracket. The C-UAFA plan
aimed at minimizing this "preferential
treatment," and, while the Faculty Senate
made some modifications in the plan, it
accepted the bulk of the proposal.
Contradictions
In any event, more than a few questions
still remain either unanswered or answered
by contradicting statements. Among them:
1) Will the aid changes result in any fewer
minority students attending Stanford?
At the Faculty Senate meeting, Dean of
Admissions Fred A. Hargadon was asked if
the shift away from all-scholarship aid for
minority students to combination
scholarship/self-help aid would affect
minority recruitment. His answer: it
wouldn't have a "marked effect."
But among groups protesting the change,
there have been intimations and outright
statements that the switch indicates, if

nothing else, a lack of commitment to
minority admissions by making it more
expensive — and hence more difficult — for
minority students to attend Stanford than it
has been in the past.
And even Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs, in his controversial memo on
the aid plan, noted the danger of "an initial
drop in acceptance by minority students
admitted." He urged steps be taken to insure

that this doesn't happen. Have such steps
been taken?
* Different Mix?
2) Will the aid changes result in a different
kind of minority student being admitted to
Stanford?
In that Gibbs memo ~ much of which he
has never been able to satisfactorily explain
— he suggested that a plan requiring at least
some minority self-help would draw students
"more attuned to the intellectual goals that
we espouse and to the elitist nature" of the
University. More attuned than whom? Than
the "many" minority students currently here
who "spend too much time trying to 'turn
the institution around'...."
This raises more than a few questions
itself. Is what Gibbs says about the aid policy
bringing in a "better mix" of students true?
If so, is financial aids policy a legitimate tool
to use to weed out the kind of student Gibbs
dislikes? Previously, the enunciated

University position has been to accept
it wants, then figure out a way for them to
pay for Stanford. If what Gibbs said is true,
then this would be a way for the University
to accept people it really didn't want, then
discourage their attendance.

nothing else, a lack of commitment to
minority admissions by making it more
expensive — and hence more difficult — for
minority students to attend Stanford than it
has been in the past.
And even Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs, in his controversial memo on
the aid plan, noted the danger of "an initial
drop in acceptance by minority students
admitted." He urged steps be taken to insure

that this doesn't happen. Have such steps
been taken?
* Different Mix?
2) Will the aid changes result in a different
kind of minority student being admitted to
Stanford?
In that Gibbs memo ~ much of which he
has never been able to satisfactorily explain
— he suggested that a plan requiring at least
some minority self-help would draw students
"more attuned to the intellectual goals that
we espouse and to the elitist nature" of the
University. More attuned than whom? Than
the "many" minority students currently here
who "spend too much time trying to 'turn
the institution around'...."
This raises more than a few questions
itself. Is what Gibbs says about the aid policy
bringing in a "better mix" of students true?
If so, is financial aids policy a legitimate tool
to use to weed out the kind of student Gibbs
dislikes? Previously, the enunciated

University position has been to accept
it wants, then figure out a way for them to
pay for Stanford. If what Gibbs said is true,
then this would be a way for the University
to accept people it really didn't want, then
discourage their attendance.
3) Will the aid changes result in a larger
number of wealthier minority students
attending Stanford?
This goes hand-in-glove with question
number two. The assumption is often made
— how valid it is, I doubt if anyone really
knows — that the better off one is, the less
likely he is to rock the boat or try to "turn
the institution around."
The fact is that this trend of wealthier
minority students is already in evidence. In
1969-70, for instance, some nine percent of
minority freshmen came from families with
annual incomes of over $15,000. By last fall,
with overall minority admissions increased,
that number had jumped to 27 percent.
Something tells me the minority standard of
living hasn't risen quite that dramatically.
In short, the issue here extends well
beyond the bounds of "preferential
treatment." Linking opponents of the plan
with "reverse discrimination" strikes me as
being almost as silly as linking proponents of
it with Watergate (both have been done).
Such loaded terms and emotionalism do no
one any good.
Rather, the questions still unanswered are
ones of diversity. If you philosophically
accept the ideal of a diversified student body
brought together for a common purpose —
education — as a valid one, you can't help
but wonder if the aids policy change is at
least in part a way of doing something
through the back door — limiting that
diversity — that would be almost universally
condemned were it done through the front.
