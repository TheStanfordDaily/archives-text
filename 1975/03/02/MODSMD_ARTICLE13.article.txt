Men Can Aid Feminism
Editor:
As feminists, we are more than
aware of the necessity of
affirmative action in all facets of
our life. Because of the
pervasiveness and strength of
sexism, not to mention its
unconscious manifestations,
women should be supported as a
better choice over men when all
other things are basically equal.
But this conscious bias towards
women is not to mean that
women who don't recognize the
existence of sexism should be
supported over a non-sexist male.
In fact, we many times find our
interests served better by this type
of qualified non-sexist male.
For this reason, we, as
feminists, support Joshua
Goldstein for Palo Alto School
Board over two female opponents.
We support Andrew Cohen for
Foothill Board of Trustees over a
large mixed field of contenders.
Both of these men have been
endorsed by the National
Women's Political Caucus, and we
find them to be the most skilled,
honest and creative of the
candidates.
In another race for County
Board of Education, we also
recommend Mary I. Hamilton, a
strong grass-roots candidate.
We strongly urge other
feminists, and all people
concerned with eradicating
sexism, to consider these
candiates' understanding of the
realities of sexism and how much
conditioning is fostered in the
schools, and support them with
a vote on March 4.

Vote 'Yes' Tomorrow
Editor:
Students fought for the right
to register to vote as residents in
your local campus community.
Now students have the
responsibility to exercise that
right and vote in the local Palo
Alto Unified School District
Election tomorrow.
At stake are seats on the local
school boards and college district.
Of prime importance is the
Revenue Limit Proposition, Page
5 on your ballot.
A "Yes" vote means orderly
reductions and maintenance of
quality education while cutting
$1.2 million from next year's
budget.
A "No" vote means the
immediate slashing of at least $3
million from the budget which
would cripple the educational
program.
We urge all Santa Clara County
registered voters who live in the
Stanford-PAUSD community to
vote "Yes."
