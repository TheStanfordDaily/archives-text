# Palestinian Group Promotes Bogus Cause
## 
### 
Many supporters of the
Palestinian cause claim that the
Palestinians have their own
national aspiration, which they
insist is suppressed by Israel. They

also argue that Palestinians are
represented by the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO),
which they say is not a terrorist
organization. Meanwhile, they cite
the 1948 massacre at Deir Yassin
as an example of Zionist
terrorism.
But the pro-Palestinian,
anti-Zionist arguments are rife
with fallacies.
It is true that some Arab
citizens (never thousands) were
hurt by war activities in the
Middle East and in my opinion
there is no justification for such
cases. However, Arab propaganda
claims that Deir Yassin's tragedy
is a typical example for Israel's
policy. This is misleading and
sounds like someone claiming that
Mai Lai was a typical tactic of
American troops in Vietnam.
Contradictions
The contradicting evidence
shows 400,000 safe Arab Isareli
citizens as well as a permanent
military regulation in Israel of not
hurting citizens. Additional
evidence is what Yunes Assad, a
prominent survivor of Deir Yassin
said: "The Jews never intended to
hurt the population of the village,
but were forced to do so when
they met enemy fire from the
village which appeared to be
surrendering."
When considering national
aspirations, we must again look on
the history of the two nations
involved. A Jewish independent
kingdom existed in the land of
Israel for hundreds of years until
it was conquered by the Roman
Empire in the year 70 A.D.
Every stone in Israel represents
the strong connection between
the Jews and their land. On the
other hand, the Palestinians were

never a separate nation or an
independent state.
Independence Refused
Even in 1956 Ahmed Shukeiry
(later the PLO leader) said in the
U.N. as a Saudi Arabia delegate:
"Palestine is nothing but southern
Syria." In 1923 the Arabs of
Palestine refused a British offer to
establish an elected representation
agency, similar to the Jewish one.
They are the only "national
liberation movement" in history
to reject independence (when
offered their liberty under the
1947 plan) and to opt voluntarily
to be annexed by King Abdulla of
Jordan (in the Jericho Conference
of 1949).
These facts do not mean that
the Palestinians' rights should be
disregarded, but rather that, the
creation of Israel was not the
cause of the political community
problems of the Palestinians. This
leads us to the second question:
who is the PLO? The PLO does
not represent the Palestinians'
national aspiration, it was
established in 1964 by Egyptian
president Hassen (in an Arab
summit conference in Cairo) who
decided to use the Palestinians as
a weapon against his enemies.
Use During Cease Fires
The PLO is mainly used by
Egypt and Syria against Israel
during times of ceasefire (after
1967 along the Jordan River and
along Lebanon borders today). It
was also used against Jordan in
1970.
Israel does not need the Arabs
to prove its existence. But many
Palestinians realize that they need
Israel to help solve their problem,
they find out that the self
appointed leaders of the PLO do
not represent them. Therefore

they turn their backs to the PLO
and have economic relations and
mutual businesses with the Jews.
Israel is willing to solve the
problem, but it must resist any
solution which threatens its
future.
I don't think that any
compromise made now by
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
can bring rest to the area. The
reason is that not even one Arabic
leader has shown that he believes

Aaron Shenhar

in Israel's right to exist. Nor has
any Arabic leader shown that ht
opposes the PLO's request that all
the Jews who came to Israel after
1947 return to their previous
countries.
Only when we first see Arabic
leaders accept Israel's existence as
a fact, we will know that a true
step toward peace has been taken
in the Middle East.

decided to use the Palestinians as
a weapon against his enemies.
Use During Cease Fires
The PLO is mainly used by
Egypt and Syria against Israel
during times of ceasefire (after
1967 along the Jordan River and
along Lebanon borders today). It
was also used against Jordan in
1970.
Israel does not need the Arabs
to prove its existence. But many
Palestinians realize that they need
Israel to help solve their problem,
they find out that the self
appointed leaders of the PLO do
not represent them. Therefore

they turn their backs to the PLO
and have economic relations and
mutual businesses with the Jews.
Israel is willing to solve the
problem, but it must resist any
solution which threatens its
future.
I don't think that any
compromise made now by
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
can bring rest to the area. The
reason is that not even one Arabic
leader has shown that he believes

Aaron Shenhar

in Israel's right to exist. Nor has
any Arabic leader shown that ht
opposes the PLO's request that all
the Jews who came to Israel after
1947 return to their previous
countries.
Only when we first see Arabic
leaders accept Israel's existence as
a fact, we will know that a true
step toward peace has been taken
in the Middle East.
(Aaron Shenhar is a graduate
student in electrical engineering.)
Many supporters of the
Palestinian cause claim that the
Palestinians have their own
national aspiration, which they
insist is suppressed by Israel. They

also argue that Palestinians are
represented by the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO),
which they say is not a terrorist
organization. Meanwhile, they cite
the 1948 massacre at Deir Yassin
as an example of Zionist
terrorism.
But the pro-Palestinian,
anti-Zionist arguments are rife
with fallacies.
It is true that some Arab
citizens (never thousands) were
hurt by war activities in the
Middle East and in my opinion
there is no justification for such
cases. However, Arab propaganda
claims that Deir Yassin's tragedy
is a typical example for Israel's
policy. This is misleading and
sounds like someone claiming that
Mai Lai was a typical tactic of
American troops in Vietnam.
Contradictions
The contradicting evidence
shows 400,000 safe Arab Isareli
citizens as well as a permanent
military regulation in Israel of not
hurting citizens. Additional
evidence is what Yunes Assad, a
prominent survivor of Deir Yassin
said: "The Jews never intended to
hurt the population of the village,
but were forced to do so when
they met enemy fire from the
village which appeared to be
surrendering."
When considering national
aspirations, we must again look on
the history of the two nations
involved. A Jewish independent
kingdom existed in the land of
Israel for hundreds of years until
it was conquered by the Roman
Empire in the year 70 A.D.
Every stone in Israel represents
the strong connection between
the Jews and their land. On the
other hand, the Palestinians were

never a separate nation or an
independent state.
Independence Refused
Even in 1956 Ahmed Shukeiry
(later the PLO leader) said in the
U.N. as a Saudi Arabia delegate:
"Palestine is nothing but southern
Syria." In 1923 the Arabs of
Palestine refused a British offer to
establish an elected representation
agency, similar to the Jewish one.
They are the only "national
liberation movement" in history
to reject independence (when
offered their liberty under the
1947 plan) and to opt voluntarily
to be annexed by King Abdulla of
Jordan (in the Jericho Conference
of 1949).
These facts do not mean that
the Palestinians' rights should be
disregarded, but rather that, the
creation of Israel was not the
cause of the political community
problems of the Palestinians. This
leads us to the second question:
who is the PLO? The PLO does
not represent the Palestinians'
national aspiration, it was
established in 1964 by Egyptian
president Hassen (in an Arab
summit conference in Cairo) who
decided to use the Palestinians as
a weapon against his enemies.
