Is a Stanford experience worth
it?
Nine illustrious ex-students talk
about their days on the Farm, and
how Stanford helped get them
where they are today. If it did at
all.
"It didn't," says artist Robert
Motherwell (B.A. 1936), one of
America's most famous abstract
expressionists whose works are
shown in major museums
throughout the world.
Stanford's Women
"I mainly remember the girls,"
he says."I used to go out with
them all the time.
"For my kind of interests,
Stanford was not a good place to
be. My family lived in San
Francisco, and at 17-years-old,
going to Stanford was no choice
at all.
"One went automatically to
Berkeley or Palo Alto. I went to
Palo Alto because Berkeley
refused me. I didn't have the
required courses, and Stanford
only cared about my average."
'My Own Stanford'
In those days, remembers
Motherwell, Stanford was
oriented towards the physical and
social sciences, rather than the
arts and humanities, which were
his main interest. "So I got into
the Philosophy Department — the
freest department possible — and
made my own Stanford," he says.
"I had two or three good
friends and essentially we taught
each other through discussion and
dialogue." Motherwell says that
he and his friends were much less
"passive" than the rest of the
student body. "We picked and
chose."
The most decisive thing to
happen in his art career, however,
did happen here when a friend
took him to the home of Michael
Stein, the brother of Gertrude
Stein.
"There I saw my first Matisse,
and I immediately knew that that
was the direction I wanted to get
into," he says.
Ralph Davidson (B.A. 1950),
publisher of Time magazine, says

he has nothing but the "greatest"
memories of Stanford.
"It was amongst the best four
years I think anyone could have
spent." With Stanford, he says,
"I've had a love affair that has
continued for 25 years.
"It's a school that has a good
reputation and a good education.
A good education makes you a
more curious human being, and
when you graduate, you go out
into the world and pursue those
curiosities."
A former president of Zeta Psi
fraternity here, Davidson says,
"Some of my best friends are
Zetes. Frat life was an integral
part of my life at the University,
but it wasn't for everyone"
Paul McCloskey
Did Stanford help Rep. Paul N.
"Pete" McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo
Park) get where he is today?
"Jesus Christ, 1 don't know,"
answers McCloskey (B.A. 1950;
LL.B. 1953). "There's no way to

predict who the leaders are to
become.
"The top student — a Phi Bete
voted most likely to succeed —
became a failure, while the guy
who flunked out of Econ 1 three
times, became head of the Econ
Department at a University.
"In other words, the guy who's
the campus drunk is likely to
become the bank president."
McCloskey, a member of Phi
Delta Theta fraternity, recalls the
old chant, " 'Lovers, loafers,
meatballs too, you'll find them all
at the Phi Delt Zoo.'
"It wasn't exactly a
law-abiding society," McCloskey
says. "We'd all steal lumber from
whatever was being built on
campus to make Big Game Parade
floats. I finally had to move out
of the house to stay in law
school."
Debate Partner Named Ehrlichman
McCloskey remembers a few of
his colleagues from the law

school: William Rehnquist, Carla
Hills and John Ehrlichman — "my
debate partner."
Of Stanford, he recalls,
"sunshine, green hills, wheat
fields, a lot of laughs and good
people. It was a good education,
the professors were good, the
athletics were great, the social life
was great, but mostly, the best
people I've ever met were friends I
made during those years.
"It's the last great chance you
have to raise hell and not get into
trouble for it."
Harry Reasoner
"What I remember about
Stanford," says Harry Reasoner,
newscaster, correspondent and
commentator on ABC-TV news,
"was either positive or wistful."
Reasoner only spent freshman
year here because, "I ran out of
money and transferred to the
University of Minnesota." He
adds, "In those days, if you had
money and a B+ average, you
could go anywhere."
"However," says Reasoner,
"even though it was only a year, I
think Stanford had a profound
effect on me.
"At that time, it had a
free-ranging intellectual
atmosphere that was a good
influence for a 16-year-old kid. I
didn't have any money and I was

disorganized.
"1 wouldn't have made Phi
Beta Kappa," he recalls of his
academic achievements, "but I
passed. / think.
"I didn t accumulate too many
more units at Minnesota. The war
was a big excuse for not
studying."
A Class From Graham Stewart
Though he says he always had
an interest in writing, he never
pursued it here beyond a
freshman writing class.
"The reason I went to Stanford
was because I thought I was
headed for the Foreign Service,
and I went in order to take a class
from Graham Stewart."
Says Reasoner, "At Minnesota,
I fell into the pattern of writing
with the Minnesota Daily, and
then I switched to journalism."
Reasoner fondly remembers
riding horses around campus ("it
was like country then"), a "lovely
restaurant called L'Omlette," and
that there "weren't enough girls."
He managed to solve that
problem with girls form Mills
College.
Shirley Hufstedler
Shirley A. Mount Hufstedler
(LL.B. 1949) was appointed in
1968 by President Lyndon
Johnson to the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals. She is the highest

ranking woman in the federal
court system.
Says Hufstedler, "Had I not
had the privilege of going to
Stanford, I wouldn't be where I
am today.
"The combination of my
fellow students, the professors
and the then-dean, was an
experience I can't duplicate and
will never forget.
"Only 'two women finished in
my law class, and we were treated
splendidly," she adds.
Tenth In Class
Hufstedler, who graduated
number 10 in that class, met and
married the number one graduate,
Seth Hufstedler, who is now
President of the Los Angeles
County Bar Association. They
spent their honeymoon studying
for the Bar exam.
"I don't think that's so unusual

anymore," she says.
"I was impressed with the
combination of the sense of
community at Stanford and with
the people, who were so very,
very good.
"I remember bull sessions in
the middle of the Quad,
milkshakes and terrible coffee at
the student union, and walking
past Memorial Church in the
middle of the night when it was
very quiet.... It was a very
effecting time."
She adds, "One develops
affections about Stanford that
make the difference of what the
Stanford experience is about.
"My Stanford days were very
important to me."

Head, N. Scott Momaday and
Dixie Lee Ray.

?ETE WHO?—Pete McCloskey, one of Stanford's more illustrious
alumni, retains a special affection for his alma mater. "There's no
place in the world like this funny little area," he says. McCloskey,
who received his B.A. and LL.B. degrees here, is also the son of
a Stanford alumnus.
