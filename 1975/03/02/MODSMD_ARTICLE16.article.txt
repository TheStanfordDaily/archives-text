# BRITISH FILM & BROAD CASTING
## STANFORD IN BRITAIN 
### 
The Department of Communication has developed the pro
gram on BRITISH FILM AND BROADCASTING to be
offered Autumn and Winter Quarters, 1 975-76 at Stanford in
Britain. The program will be of interest not only to those
students majoring in Communication, but to majors in the
humanities and social sciences. The courses have been de
signed to study the structure and function of the communica
tion media in Britain, almost all of which are centered in the
London area, and to examine how they operate in their
national community. The program will also explore the
different conditions that gave rise to a public broadcasting
industry in Britain and to a private one in the United States.
Finally, the program will study the effects of a nation's
society and culture on the content and style of a mass
medium's products.
In addition to the regular courses in this program, students
interested in pursuing specialized topics in depth may arrange
for tutorial or directed reading work in either quarter with
Julian Blaustein, who is supervising the program.
The regular Fall-Winter program in British area studies will be
offered at the same time as this special program for those
students who do not take part in it.
THE BRITISH DOCUMENTARY-Basil Wright
Fall Quarter
The creation and development of the Documentary Film in
Great Britain (with some reference to its influence else
where). The course will begin with a study of the pre-
Grierson factual film, from the Luminere Brothers onward
and including, of course, Robert Flaherty. A study of
Grierson's ideological background will lead to his individual
work (the making of Drifters) and thereto his decision to
become a producer. The key period of development
(1929-39) will be studied, and followed by an analysis of the
work of Documentary during World War 11. Post-war develop
ments, especially Britain's new role in the world, will be seen
to be reflected in documentary, as too will the new inter
nationalism and the increasing specialization of subject (sci
entific films, art films, etc.). Finally, the relations between
documentary film and documentary television will be dis
cussed, with especial reference to cinema verite, video-tape,
and Cable TV. The entire course will be illustrated by films. 4
units.
BRITISH BROADCASTING-Anthony Smith
Fall Quarter
A study of the social and cultural origins of the broadcasting
institutions of Britain, an examination of the operation of
those institutions and their present dilemmas. The course will
examine the main strands of British radio and television and
the production methods currently employed. It will examine
the various styles in entertainment, drama and public affairs
programmes which have evolved in the British context.

Visiting speakers will be chosen from the senior personalities
in the British broadcasting scene, public and commercial,
who will discuss their work and their problems with the class.
The class will gain an understanding of the role of radio and
television in British society. 4 units.
THE BRITISH FlLM — Julian Blaustein
Winter Quarter
This course will observe the development of the British Film
Industry from the 1920's to the present in context with its
surrounding social and economic circumstances. Attention
will be paid to studio productions as well as to those done
independently. The 55 years under examination will be
studied in periods: the '20's and '30's, the '40's and '50's, the
'60's, the '70's, and each period will be represented by lecturers
who are ranking professionals who have functioned within it.
Separate time will also be given to general categories such as
censorship, labor, criticism, film and the Common Market,
distribution and exhibition. 4 units.
POPULAR CULTURE AND THE MASS MEDIA - David
Robinson Winter Quarter
A study of popular culture in Britain, with reference to
history and social structures, but with special stress on the
role of the mass media in shaping and reflecting this popular
culture. The course will attempt some definitions related to
the class generation divisions of contemporary British society
and culture; and will briefly relate recent socio-cultural
development.
The main part of the course will first examine the role of the
media - press, radio and TV, cinema, advertising, popular
entertainment, and leisure - as it relates to the expression and
formation of a popular culture. The second part will analyse
the attitudes reflected by this culture in Britain, particularly
where these relate to youth and youth culture; social and
family roles; politics; sex: violence; and censorship in society.
Certain sessions will be planned as panel discussions. 4 units.
HOW TO APPLY AND DEADLINES - There are no special
entrance requirements for this focus program or for the
courses offered in it; a regular application for Stanford in
Britain will suffice. Students may take one or both courses in
the program each quarter, as well as other courses offered in
the core curriculum at Cliveden.
Application forms are available in 112 Old Union. For all
students, applications are due on March 7, 1975, and selec
tions will be announced on March 13, 1975. After the

Grierson's ideological background will lead to his individual
work (the making of Drifters) and thereto his decision to
become a producer. The key period of development
(1929-39) will be studied, and followed by an analysis of the
work of Documentary during World War 11. Post-war develop
ments, especially Britain's new role in the world, will be seen
to be reflected in documentary, as too will the new inter
nationalism and the increasing specialization of subject (sci
entific films, art films, etc.). Finally, the relations between
documentary film and documentary television will be dis
cussed, with especial reference to cinema verite, video-tape,
and Cable TV. The entire course will be illustrated by films. 4
units.

development.
The main part of the course will first examine the role of the
media - press, radio and TV, cinema, advertising, popular
entertainment, and leisure - as it relates to the expression and
formation of a popular culture. The second part will analyse
the attitudes reflected by this culture in Britain, particularly
where these relate to youth and youth culture; social and
family roles; politics; sex: violence; and censorship in society.
Certain sessions will be planned as panel discussions. 4 units.

national community. The program will also explore the
different conditions that gave rise to a public broadcasting
industry in Britain and to a private one in the United States.
Finally, the program will study the effects of a nation's
society and culture on the content and style of a mass
medium's products.

Industry from the 1920's to the present in context with its
surrounding social and economic circumstances. Attention
will be paid to studio productions as well as to those done
independently. The 55 years under examination will be
studied in periods: the '20's and '30's, the '40's and '50's, the
'60's, the '70's, and each period will be represented by lecturers

POPULAR CULTURE AND THE MASS MEDIA - David
Robinson Winter Quarter
A study of popular culture in Britain, with reference to
history and social structures, but with special stress on the
role of the mass media in shaping and reflecting this popular
culture. The course will attempt some definitions related to
the class generation divisions of contemporary British society
and culture; and will briefly relate recent socio-cultural
development.
The main part of the course will first examine the role of the
media - press, radio and TV, cinema, advertising, popular
entertainment, and leisure - as it relates to the expression and
formation of a popular culture. The second part will analyse
the attitudes reflected by this culture in Britain, particularly
where these relate to youth and youth culture; social and
family roles; politics; sex: violence; and censorship in society.
Certain sessions will be planned as panel discussions. 4 units.
HOW TO APPLY AND DEADLINES - There are no special

The Department of Communication has developed the pro
gram on BRITISH FILM AND BROADCASTING to be
offered Autumn and Winter Quarters, 1 975-76 at Stanford in
Britain. The program will be of interest not only to those
students majoring in Communication, but to majors in the
humanities and social sciences. The courses have been de
signed to study the structure and function of the communica
tion media in Britain, almost all of which are centered in the
London area, and to examine how they operate in their
national community. The program will also explore the
different conditions that gave rise to a public broadcasting
industry in Britain and to a private one in the United States.
Finally, the program will study the effects of a nation's
society and culture on the content and style of a mass
medium's products.
In addition to the regular courses in this program, students
interested in pursuing specialized topics in depth may arrange
for tutorial or directed reading work in either quarter with
Julian Blaustein, who is supervising the program.
The regular Fall-Winter program in British area studies will be
offered at the same time as this special program for those
students who do not take part in it.
THE BRITISH DOCUMENTARY-Basil Wright
Fall Quarter
The creation and development of the Documentary Film in
Great Britain (with some reference to its influence else
where). The course will begin with a study of the pre-
Grierson factual film, from the Luminere Brothers onward
and including, of course, Robert Flaherty. A study of
Grierson's ideological background will lead to his individual
work (the making of Drifters) and thereto his decision to
become a producer. The key period of development
(1929-39) will be studied, and followed by an analysis of the
work of Documentary during World War 11. Post-war develop
ments, especially Britain's new role in the world, will be seen
to be reflected in documentary, as too will the new inter
nationalism and the increasing specialization of subject (sci
entific films, art films, etc.). Finally, the relations between
documentary film and documentary television will be dis
cussed, with especial reference to cinema verite, video-tape,
and Cable TV. The entire course will be illustrated by films. 4
units.
BRITISH BROADCASTING-Anthony Smith
Fall Quarter
A study of the social and cultural origins of the broadcasting
institutions of Britain, an examination of the operation of
those institutions and their present dilemmas. The course will
examine the main strands of British radio and television and
the production methods currently employed. It will examine
the various styles in entertainment, drama and public affairs
programmes which have evolved in the British context.

Visiting speakers will be chosen from the senior personalities
in the British broadcasting scene, public and commercial,
who will discuss their work and their problems with the class.
The class will gain an understanding of the role of radio and
television in British society. 4 units.
