# Not 'Some Far Out Radical Thing'
## Female Law Prof Defends ERA 
### LONNIE ROSENWALD 
In light of recent criticism of the controversial Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA), which opponents see as a threat
to the woman's right to remain in the home, supporters
such as Law Prof. Barbara Babcock have defended the ERA
as "a mandate from the people that this is an important
issue."
Babcock, the Law School's only female professor, has
co-authored with three other prominent lawyers a recently
published source book, Sex Discrimination and the Law:
Cases and Remedies.
With ratification by four more states needed for passage
of the ERA (34 states have already approved it), Babcock
discussed the changes which enactment of the bill would
make.
Significant Effect
"Every kind of law in every area will have to be
re-examined," she said, noting that the ERA "already has
had a significant effect in the states that have ratified it."
Babcock predicted that passage of the ERA will trigger
legal reform in areas such as prostitution, abortion, rape
and homosexuality.
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the bill, an issue
which Babcock conceded has alienated many would-be
supporters, is military service.
Warning that sexual equality involves a taking on of
responsibility as well as privileges," Babcock was also quick
to note that military service could have advantages for some
women. "For some, it's a good method of upward

mobility," she said.
In addition, Babcock advocated sexually neutral rape
laws, and said "homosexual rape should be included."
She blamed opposition to the ERA on misconceptions
which depict the law as "some far-out radical thing." What
opponents do not realize, she contended, is that enactment
of the ERA means "women will have a choice. There won't
be set roles for women."
"The opposition to the ERA in any of the states has
largely come from the right," according to Babcock. She
cited organizations such as the John Birch Society as the
financial backers of the opposition movement.
Babcock insisted that the issue of women's rights is far
from dead.
"Discrimination in the most basic sense still occurs," she
said, contending that "the unequal position of women in
the labor market is true right through from blue-collar to
the universities."
