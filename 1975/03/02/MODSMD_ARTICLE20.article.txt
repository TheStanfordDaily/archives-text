# Tracksters Win Season Opener
## 
### CHRIS KAMEL 
"I think this is going to be an
exciting team," Stanford track
coach Pay ton Jordan said before
the' Cards opened their 1975
season against Fresno State.
The Cardinals didn't take long
to prove Jordan correct as they
held off a late Fresno State
comeback Saturday for a 91-72
victory. The win, which raised
Stanford's series lead to 27-1, was
highlighted by two meet records
and 10 lifetime bests by the Card
trackmen.
Stanford jumped out to an
early 64-40 lead spotlighted by
the performances of freshmen
Stacy Geiken, James Lofton,
Charlie Harwood and Monte
Makous and sophomore Marvin
Holmes. Geiken finished first in
the steeplechase with a time of
9:11.4, eclipsing the old 1973
meet mark by 21 seconds. Lofton
and Harwood combined for first
and second in the long jump with
jumps of 23-feet-5% inches and
22-3 respectively. Holmes was
Stanford's only double-winner of
the day with first-place times of
9.8 in the 100-yard dash and 21.6
in the 220-yard dash. Lofton and
Holmes were also members of the
440 relay team, along with Alan
Sheats and Scott Wingo, that took
first place with a 40.8 clocking.
'Impressive Time'
"I was trying to look at the
team as a whole, but you just
couldn't help but be impressed
with the 440 relay team and with
its impressive time of 40.8.
Holmes gave us a good start in the
relay and in the sprints and we
had personal bests from 10 men,"

Jordan said.
The Cardinals' comfortable lead
was whittled away, however, as
Fresno placed 1-2 in the discus
and the pole vault, and swept the
high jump to make the score
77-72 with only the three-mile
run and the mile relay remaining.
Enter the excitement. Cardinal
Tony Sandoval shaved 30 seconds
off the 1968 meet mark with a
first-place time of 13:57.0 to lead
a blitz in the three-mile run.
Stanford's Mark McConnell and
Jack Bellah finished second and
third with times of 14:07.0 and
14:33.6 respectively. Bellah

earlier finished second behind
Geiken in the steeplechase.
Close Mile Relay
In the mile relay, Stanford
edged Fresno with a winning time
of 3:15.1. Matt Hogsett gave the
Cards some breathing room with a
first-leg time of 49.5, while
Lofton's 48.8, Sheats' 48.3 and
Wingo's 49.0 typified Stanford's
success in the running events
during the afternoon.
Jordan wants, however, to
build Stanford into a track and
field team.
"We need a weight team,"
Jordan said. "If it were not for

guys like John Olenchalk and
Mike Hill, we wouldn't have a
weight team. We are going to have
to work on the field events."
According to Jordan, this year's
team has more talent and youth.
"We have a very young and
inexperienced team. We're not
there yet; we have to improve a
lot more. The Pac-8 is going to be
better balanced, but just as tough
as any year."
Jordan explained that this
team, which travels to San Jose
State next Saturday, is one that
can compete with the best.

first-place time of 13:57.0 to lead
a blitz in the three-mile run.
Stanford's Mark McConnell and
Jack Bellah finished second and
third with times of 14:07.0 and
14:33.6 respectively. Bellah

earlier finished second behind
Geiken in the steeplechase.
Close Mile Relay
In the mile relay, Stanford
edged Fresno with a winning time
of 3:15.1. Matt Hogsett gave the
Cards some breathing room with a
first-leg time of 49.5, while
Lofton's 48.8, Sheats' 48.3 and
Wingo's 49.0 typified Stanford's
success in the running events
during the afternoon.
Jordan wants, however, to
build Stanford into a track and
field team.
"We need a weight team,"
Jordan said. "If it were not for

guys like John Olenchalk and
Mike Hill, we wouldn't have a
weight team. We are going to have
to work on the field events."
According to Jordan, this year's
team has more talent and youth.
"We have a very young and
inexperienced team. We're not
there yet; we have to improve a
lot more. The Pac-8 is going to be
better balanced, but just as tough
as any year."
Jordan explained that this
team, which travels to San Jose
State next Saturday, is one that
can compete with the best.
"I think this is going to be an
exciting team," Stanford track
coach Pay ton Jordan said before
the' Cards opened their 1975
season against Fresno State.
The Cardinals didn't take long
to prove Jordan correct as they
held off a late Fresno State
comeback Saturday for a 91-72
victory. The win, which raised
Stanford's series lead to 27-1, was
highlighted by two meet records
and 10 lifetime bests by the Card
trackmen.
Stanford jumped out to an
early 64-40 lead spotlighted by
the performances of freshmen
Stacy Geiken, James Lofton,
Charlie Harwood and Monte
Makous and sophomore Marvin
Holmes. Geiken finished first in
the steeplechase with a time of
9:11.4, eclipsing the old 1973
meet mark by 21 seconds. Lofton
and Harwood combined for first
and second in the long jump with
jumps of 23-feet-5% inches and
22-3 respectively. Holmes was
Stanford's only double-winner of
the day with first-place times of
9.8 in the 100-yard dash and 21.6
in the 220-yard dash. Lofton and
Holmes were also members of the
440 relay team, along with Alan
Sheats and Scott Wingo, that took
first place with a 40.8 clocking.
'Impressive Time'
"I was trying to look at the
team as a whole, but you just
couldn't help but be impressed
with the 440 relay team and with
its impressive time of 40.8.
Holmes gave us a good start in the
relay and in the sprints and we
had personal bests from 10 men,"

Jordan said.
The Cardinals' comfortable lead
was whittled away, however, as
Fresno placed 1-2 in the discus
and the pole vault, and swept the
high jump to make the score
77-72 with only the three-mile
run and the mile relay remaining.
Enter the excitement. Cardinal
Tony Sandoval shaved 30 seconds
off the 1968 meet mark with a
first-place time of 13:57.0 to lead
a blitz in the three-mile run.
Stanford's Mark McConnell and
Jack Bellah finished second and
third with times of 14:07.0 and
14:33.6 respectively. Bellah
