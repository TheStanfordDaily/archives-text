advanced to the third round of the San Francisco
City Golf Championships Sunday with a pair of 4-3
victories.
Trompas, Baskins and Conrad Nilmeier were
among the field of 64 when match play began
Saturday. Trompas won his first round match 5-4
by playing the best golf in the field. Baskins'victory
was i-up; however Nilmeier, the runnerup in
medalist qualifying, dropped his first-round match
6-5.
Friday Nilmeier teamed with Baskins to lead the
Stanford golf team to a first place finish in the Cal
State-Hayward Invitational in Napa. The Cardinals
finished eight strokes ahead of runnerup San Jose
State. Nilmeier and Baskins finished third and fifth
respectively in the individual standings.
Baskins shot a 74-72 — 146 and Nilmeier had a
71-72 — 143. Trompas was down the list at 150;
Jay Johnston and Mark Mcßride shot 152.
Women's Swimming
Only a loss in the final race of the day prevented
the Stanford Women's Swim Team from pulling off
a major upset over the University of Washington.
Saturday at the DeGuenre pool. The final score was
Washington 98'i, Stanford 92, and Oregon State
47#.
Washington, with the strongest women's swim
team on the coast, won 10 of 16 races. But
surprising (and surprised) Stanford won the other
six races and finished strong in the races it lost.
"We knew we would finish second," said Betsy
Weeks, "but we didn't know how close it would
be." It was close.
Two Stanford swimmers were double winners.
Vicki Hays won the 200 yard individual medley
and the 100 yard breaststroke. Anne Bordelle took
firsts in the 200 and 400 yard freestyles. Other
Stanford victories were in the 50 free won by Holly

Houston and in the 200 individual medley relay.
Stanford now has qualified nine swimmers for
the Women's Nationals scheduled for March 13-14.

Women's Basketball
The Stanford women's basketball schedule came
to a dismal end this weekend. The Cards lost twice
en route to a fourth-place finish in the NCIAC
Pre-Regional Tournament.
Friday night the Cards were beaten 78-45 by
Sacramento State, the team which eventually won
the tournament. UC-Davis, a team which had
beaten Stanford earlier in the season, pulled the
trick again on Saturday moming. The Cards' 67-53
loss made their final record 8-3.
In the Sacramento State game, Stanford
managed to stay close for 20 minutes, trailing only
28-26 at intermission. Fouls hurt the Cards in the
second half. An even bigger factor in the final score
may have been the fact that the Stanford varsity
was playing its third game in four days.
Playing the following morning at 10, Stanford
came out cold. Davis made the game a runaway,
taking a 39-14 halftime lead. The Cards made an
effort to come back in the second half, pulling
within eight and coming on at the end, but it was
too little, too late.

Women's Basketball
The Stanford women's basketball schedule came
to a dismal end this weekend. The Cards lost twice
en route to a fourth-place finish in the NCIAC
Pre-Regional Tournament.
Friday night the Cards were beaten 78-45 by
Sacramento State, the team which eventually won
the tournament. UC-Davis, a team which had
beaten Stanford earlier in the season, pulled the
trick again on Saturday moming. The Cards' 67-53
loss made their final record 8-3.
In the Sacramento State game, Stanford
managed to stay close for 20 minutes, trailing only
28-26 at intermission. Fouls hurt the Cards in the
second half. An even bigger factor in the final score
may have been the fact that the Stanford varsity
was playing its third game in four days.
Playing the following morning at 10, Stanford
came out cold. Davis made the game a runaway,
taking a 39-14 halftime lead. The Cards made an
effort to come back in the second half, pulling
within eight and coming on at the end, but it was
too little, too late.
