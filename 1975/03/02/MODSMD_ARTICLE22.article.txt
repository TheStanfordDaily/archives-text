# Batters Slowed By Fumbling Play
## 
### DAN PYNE 
After nudging Nevada-Reno
4-3 last Friday, a case of the
willy-nillies struck the Stanford
baseball team and it
dropped three straight games to
San Jose State.
The Cards committed nine
errors in the course of a
doubleheader Saturday and
dropped both halves, 4-0 in the
opener, and 10-5 in the nightcap.
And yesterday the Card nine
committed five errors while
picking up only one hit, and lost
to the Spartans again, 5-1.
Stanford's record now stands at
6-10.
On Friday the Cardinals were
in good form. Ken Grolle,
sidelined for fifteen days with
tendinitis in his shoulder, pitched
six strong innings, striking out

eight, walking only two, and
allowing only three singles and
one unearned run. He left the
game with the score tied at
one-all.
Reno picked up runs in the
seventh and eighth off reliever
Bernie Hittner, but the Cards
came back with two in the
bottom of the eighth to tie, and
set the scene for designated hitter
Joe Lamoure.
Bases-Loaded Single
With the bases loaded in the
last of the ninth, two outs,
three-and-two count, Lamoure
drilled a single up the middle to
bring home third baseman Gary
Pitchford and a 4-3 victory.
Hittner picked up the win, his
first of the '75 season.
On Saturday the clouds and
the cold came, however, as the

Cards could not find a handle on
the ball, putting the Spartans on
the scoreboard too soon. SJS
lead-off batter John Guzman
scored on an infield single
bobbled by Card second baseman
Gary Bei.
In the next two innings
shortstop Steve Davis, normally
an infield vacuum cleaner,
committed two fielding and one
throwing error, one of which
allowed a run in the third. Card
hurler A 1 Arthur walked in a
second run and San Jose led 3-0
after three. At the plate the Cards
were stopped cold.
Two Cardinal Hits
Steve Gordon-Forbes, the
Spartan pitcher, held Stanford to
only two hits — a double by
rightfielder Bob Hampton, and an
infield single. Arthur, who pitched
the entire seven innings for
Stanford, allowed nine hits — but
only one of them for more than a
single base.
In all, Stanford collected six
errors.
The nightcap was an
improvement, but still nothing to
write home about. Card coach
Ray Young juggled his line-up.
Hampton moved to left field,
Gary Morton went into right,
Perez moved to third, Davis was
back in at short, and Joe Lamoure
replaced Bei at second.
But the Spartans were still hot.
San Jose State scored two runs in
the first inning on a deep fly
dropped by centerfielder Pepe
Hinojosa. The Card freshman
made a tremendous effort to get
under the ball in right-center,
snagged it in his glove, then lost
his footing and the ball at the
same time.
Diving 'Almost-Catch'
Hinojosa made an almost
identical play in the eighth, diving
for a deep drive and dropping the
ball, but saved a run in the process.
San Jose drove Card starter
John Yandle off the mound in the
top of the third with two gone
and the bases loaded after Yandle
had allowed five runs on five hits
in the game. Ed Matta came in to
retire the side.
The Cards picked up two in the
bottom of the third on a fielder's
choice by Randy Wong and a
single to right by catcher Bruce
Robinson, and three more in the
fifth to tie the game up (Wong
and Robinson again combined for
the RBIs — Wong singled in
Lamoure with two outs, then
Robinson lofted a shot over the

right field fence).
Matta, who pitched SVi
scoreless innings, tired in the
seventh, giving up two runs in that
inning and two more in the eighth
before he was replaced by Mike
Williamson, who walked in the
other San Jose tally.
Steve Friar pitched the
distance for the Spartans, allowing
five runs on six Stanford hits. In
all, the Card pitchers allowed 10
runs on 11 hits in the nightcap.
Stanford had three errors, San
Jose none.
Yesterday, Kent Caldwell
pitched eight innings for the Cards
and picked up the loss. Stanford
had one run on one hit (an infield
single) and five errors.

picking up only one hit, and lost
to the Spartans again, 5-1.
Stanford's record now stands at
6-10.
On Friday the Cardinals were
in good form. Ken Grolle,
sidelined for fifteen days with
tendinitis in his shoulder, pitched
six strong innings, striking out

eight, walking only two, and
allowing only three singles and
one unearned run. He left the
game with the score tied at
one-all.
Reno picked up runs in the
seventh and eighth off reliever
Bernie Hittner, but the Cards
came back with two in the
bottom of the eighth to tie, and
set the scene for designated hitter
Joe Lamoure.
Bases-Loaded Single
With the bases loaded in the
last of the ninth, two outs,
three-and-two count, Lamoure
drilled a single up the middle to
bring home third baseman Gary
Pitchford and a 4-3 victory.
Hittner picked up the win, his
first of the '75 season.
On Saturday the clouds and
the cold came, however, as the

Cards could not find a handle on
the ball, putting the Spartans on
the scoreboard too soon. SJS
lead-off batter John Guzman
scored on an infield single
bobbled by Card second baseman
Gary Bei.
In the next two innings
shortstop Steve Davis, normally
an infield vacuum cleaner,
committed two fielding and one
throwing error, one of which
allowed a run in the third. Card
hurler A 1 Arthur walked in a
second run and San Jose led 3-0
after three. At the plate the Cards
were stopped cold.
Two Cardinal Hits
Steve Gordon-Forbes, the
Spartan pitcher, held Stanford to
only two hits — a double by
rightfielder Bob Hampton, and an
infield single. Arthur, who pitched
the entire seven innings for
Stanford, allowed nine hits — but
only one of them for more than a
single base.
In all, Stanford collected six
errors.
The nightcap was an
improvement, but still nothing to
write home about. Card coach
Ray Young juggled his line-up.
Hampton moved to left field,
Gary Morton went into right,
Perez moved to third, Davis was
back in at short, and Joe Lamoure
replaced Bei at second.
But the Spartans were still hot.
San Jose State scored two runs in
the first inning on a deep fly
dropped by centerfielder Pepe
Hinojosa. The Card freshman
made a tremendous effort to get
under the ball in right-center,
snagged it in his glove, then lost
his footing and the ball at the
same time.
Diving 'Almost-Catch'
Hinojosa made an almost
identical play in the eighth, diving
for a deep drive and dropping the
ball, but saved a run in the process.
San Jose drove Card starter
John Yandle off the mound in the
top of the third with two gone
and the bases loaded after Yandle
had allowed five runs on five hits
in the game. Ed Matta came in to
retire the side.
The Cards picked up two in the
bottom of the third on a fielder's
choice by Randy Wong and a
single to right by catcher Bruce
Robinson, and three more in the
fifth to tie the game up (Wong
and Robinson again combined for
the RBIs — Wong singled in
Lamoure with two outs, then
Robinson lofted a shot over the

right field fence).
Matta, who pitched SVi
scoreless innings, tired in the
seventh, giving up two runs in that
inning and two more in the eighth
before he was replaced by Mike
Williamson, who walked in the
other San Jose tally.
Steve Friar pitched the
distance for the Spartans, allowing
five runs on six Stanford hits. In
all, the Card pitchers allowed 10
runs on 11 hits in the nightcap.
Stanford had three errors, San
Jose none.
Yesterday, Kent Caldwell
pitched eight innings for the Cards
and picked up the loss. Stanford
had one run on one hit (an infield
single) and five errors.
After nudging Nevada-Reno
4-3 last Friday, a case of the
willy-nillies struck the Stanford
baseball team and it

San Jose State.
The Cards committed nine

dropped both halves, 4-0 in the
opener, and 10-5 in the nightcap.
And yesterday the Card nine
