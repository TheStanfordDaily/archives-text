# Trojans, Bruins Trample Stanford
## Card Cage Hopes Shattered 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
LOS ANGELES-With about
six minutes remaining in a game
that was already a rout UCLA's
Andre McCarter lofted a high pass
underneath to Ralph Drollinger.
The pass slipped through the nets
for two points.
For Stanford, it was that kind
of weekend.
The false hopes of three
seasons were shattered at the
Sports Arena and Pauley Pavilion,
as the Cardinals turned the ball
over 53 times while losing to USC
and UCLA, the same two teams
Stanford had upset in a delerious
weekend six weeks ago.
"N-C-A-A, We're on our way,"
chanted the Pauley Pavilion
crowd.
But for Stanford, now 6-7 in
the league, 12-13 for the season,
and 37-38 since the class of'7s
started playing for the varsity,
there will be no post-season
tournaments. All that's left is a
chance to avoid the embarrassment
of a losing three-year record
when the Rich Kelley era comes
to a close Friday night against
California at Maples Pavilion.
'Worst In Three Years'
Saturday night's humbling
93-59 defeat to the Bruins was
"our worst game in three years,"
according to Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar. "The first half
was a nightmare, and the second
half was part two."

The Cardinals started the game
with a turnover, the first of 32 for
the game. They managed to stay
close for a while, trailing only
16-15 eight minutes into the
contest, when the turnovers began
to assume epidemic proportions.
UCLA capitalized on three
consecutive miscues for eight
straight points and a 24-15 lead.
The stage-struck Cardinals never
had a chance.
'Everybody Played Tense'
"We played scared for some
reason," Dallmar said.
"Everybody played tense — one
guy turns it over, then the next
guy does .. . you can't control the
tempo of the game if you're not
going to have any ball handling."
Meanwhile, the Bruins were
playing quite unlike the team that
lost to Stanford at Maples
Pavilion, lost to Washington by 22
points last weekend and barely
outlasted California on Friday
night.
They played tenacious defense,
stormed the offensive boards and
passed crisply. UCLA had four
first half turnovers, compared to
15 for the Cardinals, which easily
explains the Bruins' 42-37
halftime lead.
Good First Half
"It was one of our best first
halves," said UCLA coach John
Wooden, "We played very well."
The most amazing Bruin was
6-foot-6 sophomore forward

Marques Johnson who didn't
score a point against Cal the night
before but Saturday Johnson hit 6
of 7 field goal attempts, 3 of 4
free-throws and grabbed 10
rebounds — six of them off the
offensive board — in a magnificent
first-half performance.
Johnson left the game after
two minutes of the second half,
but there were plenty of Bruins to
pick up the slack. Dave Meyers hit
four long jumpers to push his
scoring total to a game-high 21
points, while Ricn Washington
finished the game with 12. In
all, 11 players scored for the
Bruins.
Rich Kelley, who picked up his
fourth foul only nine seconds into
the second half, led the Cardinals
with 17 points and 12 rebounds.
Kelley eventually fouled out with
5:43 remaining.
The game served a simple
purpose for UCLA. "Even though
Stanford beat us at Palo Alto this
was no grudge match," Johnson
said. "There was no revenge
motif, it was just a very important
conference game because we
know that OSU is on our tail."
The Bruins, now 11-2 in the
league and 22-3 over all, are
assured of at least a tie for the
Pac-8 title.
USC Loss Typical
The night before at the Sports
Arena Stanford suffered a more
typical defeat. The Cards were
lied 36-36 at halftime and trailed
only 69-68 with three minutes
remaining. But Stanford simply
didn't have enough poise in the
stretch.
USC scored eight straight
points at two crucial stages of the
second half, capitalizing on some
turnovers that would put a high
school team to shame. Gus
Williams finally iced the game
with a driving, twisting layup with
2:17 left, giving USC a 77-68 lead.
Williams, the Pac-B's leading
scorer, missed 11 of his first 13
shots, and finished with only 16
points, but USC coach Bob Boyd
said Williams "had as much
influence on the game as
anybody."
Freshman forward Earl Evans
who kept the Trojans in the game

with four baseline jumpers in the
first half, also scored 16.
For Stanford, there were
several telling statistics. Ben Bluitt
had five turnovers in only six
minutes of action, and the Cards
hit only 9-17 freethrows,
including four missed one-and-one
opportunities.
Kelley led all scorers and
rebounders with 2-5 points and 15
boards, while Ed Schweitzer
contributed 14 points and 10
rebounds. But Dal 1 mar lamented
afterward that "we didn't get
enough overall performance from
the other players."
Boyd said, "Stanford looked a
little flat and sluggish the last 10
or 12 minutes."
It was that kind of weekend.
Cardinal Notes: Wooden would
like to see officials crack down on
"intentional" fouls committed by
players who plant themselves in
opponents' paths while trying to
draw offensive fouls.
"I haven't seen any intentional
fouls called this year but I've seen
many intentional fouls
committed." Wooden said. "The
problem is that referees give
players the benefit of the doubt.
But I say if there's any doubt, call
it....1n fact, I'll go one step
further. A player should be kicked
out of the game for an intentional
foul,' 1 \Vooden said.
The Red Vest band, a
subsidiary of the LSJUMB,
emerged victorious Saturday
morning in a four-band basketball
tournament between Stanford,
USC, UCLA and California. The
Red Vests defeated UCLA 33-11
in the opening round and edged
USC 42-40 for the championship.
Complete statistics weren't
available, but Pat Cowlishaw was
Stanford's leading scorer.
