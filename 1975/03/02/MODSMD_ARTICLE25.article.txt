# Pac-8 Roundup
## Beavers Survive 
### 
Oregon State, Cinderella team
of the Pacific Eight conference, is
out of the woods.
The Beavers beat Washington
and Washington State this
weekend to sew up second in the
league and a likely at-large berth
in the NCAA championship
tournament. It wasn't easy.
On Friday, the Flat-tails were
supposed to play hapless
Washington State. Surprise
surprise. George Raveling's
Cougars were not hapless, and
Oregon State won by the skin of
its buck teeth, 44-41. Steve
Puidokas scored all but 13 of the
Cougars' points.
Saturday, the Beavers were
supposed to play powerful
Washington. Surprise surprise. The
Huskies, beaten in a heartbreaker
by Oregon the night before,
couldn't put a game together and
dropped to Oregon State 86-78.
At halftime the Beavers led 47-41.
The Dogs' Larry Pounds was
high-scorer with 25 points.
Meanwhile, those Oregon
ankle-biters broke a six-game
losing streak when they nipped
Washington (in the last few

seconds, of course) and then
sprained Puidokas' ankle ana beai
Washington State 56-52 Saturday.
In the playoffs, it appears, are
UCLA (naturally), Oregon State
(surprisingly) and USC
(conveniently). Washington, Cal,
and Stanford are battling for
fourth.
