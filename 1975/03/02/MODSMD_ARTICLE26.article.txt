# JV Cagers Win Another One

### PAUL BAUMAN 
SANTA CRUZ—Two weeks ago
Stanford's junior varsity
basketball team defeated UC-
Santa Cruz at Maples Pavilion, and
the place couldn't have been
emptier if the Oregon Ducks had
been giving an autograph-signing
party.
Stanford defeated Santa Cruz
again Saturday night in the latter's
field house before a surprising
turnout of howling partisan fans.
How ironic. Stanford won
before 7000 empty seats in

Maples, symbol of the
intercollegiate jock empire, yet
Santa Cruz students, most of
whom think Ed Schweitzer was a
medical missionary in Africa, sat
cramped on the floor (the field
house was not built on the theory
anyone would watch a game
there) and enthusiastically
cheered their team.
Not that Santa Cruz' field
house is small, but can you
picture an igloo? The dome is just
big enough to cover the court, and
consequently the acoustics are

very good. There was so much
noise when Santa Cruz scored,
you'd have thought marijuana had
just been legalized.
By the way, the score was
81-63 — Stanford's seventh
straight win. The Cards (13-4)
have also won 12 of their last 13.
The UC cagers played
determined basketball, but just
didn't have the organization to
seriously threaten Stanford. Santa
Cruz trailed by only seven at the
half, but the Cards continually
inflated their lead until the final
buzzer.
Assistant coach Ken Morgan,
subbing for head coach Percy
Carr, used the game as a respite
between last week's revenge game
against San Jose State and this
Friday's game against an excellent
Cat team.
"It was a chance to have a lot
of fun," he said, 44 and get some
of the pressure off. Santa Cruz is a
good team, but...." Morgan's
voice trailed off but he seemed to
imply 44 . . . but not that good."
Mark Fitzner, looking more and
more like solid varsity material,
led Stanford with 15 points.
Four other Cards, Sven Walker,
Dick Dohrmann, Tony Hill, and
Warner Session, scored in double
figures.
Stanford (81)—Fitzner 15, Walker 11,
Dohrmann 10, Hill 10, Session 10,
McCartln 6, Christopher 4, Erickson 4,
Marion 4, Russell 3, Baker 2, Edwards
2.
Total: FG: 33, FT: 15-23.
UC Santa Cruz (63)~-Krasowski 19,
Lacey 12, Apple 8, Landing 4, Cass 4,
Goelit* 4, Scharf 6, Shapiro 3, Flier 3.
Total: FG: 26, FT: 11-17.
