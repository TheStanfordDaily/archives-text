Democrats Unveil Energy Proposals
WASHINGTON — House Ways and Means Committee
Democrats unveiled a sweeping set of energy proposals
yesterday, including gradual oil import quotas and a tax
hike to 40 cents a gallon by 1979 on "excess gasoline use."
Among other items in what committee Chairman A 1
Uliman (D-Ore.) termed a comprehensive energy plan to
serve as a basis for developing legislation, are proposals for:
—An excise tax on new cars using too much gasoline for
the miles they travel, and a possible special tax credit
incentive for motorists to buy more efficient gas mileage
vehicles;
—A federal petroleum purchasing agency, to which oil
companies and oil-producing nations would have to submit
bids for sale, to control imports in line with congressionally
mandated guidelines and to see to it that these come within
the quotas;
—A "windfall" profits tax on producers based on the
assumption of gradual deregulation of oil and possibly
natural gas prices.
—An energy trust fund to channel energy tax revenue
into energy development and conservation.
Tax Bill May Bring Smaller Refunds
WASHINGTON — Unless Congress takes steps to prevent
it, the tax cut bill as passed by the House could mean
unexpected tax trouble ahead for millions of American
taxpayers.
For these individuals, the least of their problems will be
smaller refunds on 1975 taxes. Uncounted others may find
themselves owing money to Uncle Sam.
The House-passed bill reduced withholding in 1975 for
all taxpayers arid gave a tax cut to low- and middle-income
taxpayers who use the standard deduction.
But for 14.2 million taxpayers with incomes of $7000 to
$20,000 who are expected to itemize, there is no tax cut,
only less money withheld from paychecks.
While the immediate effect will be more money to spend
now, when it comes time to compute 1975 income taxes
the result could mean a smaller refund or taxes to pay.
Filibuster Settlement May Come Today
WASHINGTON — Senate leaders have scheduled another
test vote today in hopes of settling the battle over
filibusters so the calendar can be cleared for major tax and
energy legislation.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield expressed
concern that failure to settle the matter could delay action
later this month on the House-passed tax cut bill, on which
the Senate Finance Committee opens hearings Wednesday.
The House Ways and Means Committee, meanwhile,
turns its attention today to energy legislation with the start
of hearings which Chairman A 1 Ullinan (D-Ore.) hopes will
lead to a bill by April 18.
•> Both houses could vote before the end of the week on
President Ford's veto of the bill to suspend his oil import
tariff increases. Ford must act by tomorrow.
MIA Dispute Explodes In Saigon
SAIGON — A U.S. congressional delegation's attempt to
obtain information on Americans missing in action ended in
a heated exchange yesterday with some of the lawmakers

telling North Vietnamese representatives they were liars and
murderers.
Rep. Bill Chappell Jr. (D-Fla.) accused North Vietnam of
murder in attacks ow Americans searching for graves of
missing U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam, and Sen. Dewey
Bartlett (R-Okla.) called North Vietnamese statements
"hogwash."
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Calif.) told newsmen that
he felt Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had to become
involved in efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the
Cambodian and Vietnam wars.
He said he also visited South Vietnam's national prison
center and "learned that of 32,000 prisoners, over half of
them have not yet been judged."
McCloskey said the political prisoners issue would weigh
heavily on the scheduled congressional vote on
supplemental aid to Saigon.
Algeria Balks At Oil Delegation List
ALGIERS — Algeria announced yesterday it disagreed
with the list of 10 delegations chosen by France to
participate in a preliminary world energy conference to
open in Paris on April 7.
Algerian Industry Minister Belaid Abdessalam told
newsmen that Algeria will delay a formal reply to the
invitation issued by President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
pending discussion of the issue at the summit meeting of oil
exporting countries here tomorrow.
"It is up to the summit to determine the attitude of the
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries [OPEC]," Abdessalam said. "We will make a
united decision."
Earlier, Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika
urged the OPEC nations to take a hardline stand in
defending themselves against "the export of inflation in the
United States to the rest of the world."
Gonorrhea Hits All-Time High
NEW YORK — The reported number of gonorrhea cases
was at an all-time high during 1973-74, up eight percent
over the preceding year, the American Social Health
Association said yesterday.
But the health agency said the eight percent rate of
increase was lower than those of the two previous reported
periods, suggesting that some success was being achieved in
efforts to control this venereal disease.
The agency also reported that for the first time in six
years, the reported number of cases of primary and
secondary syphilis declined.
The 10 cities with the highest reported rate of gonorrhea
per 100,000 population are: Atlanta, Ga., 3272;
Washington, D.C., 3853; San Francisco, 2082; Charlotte,
N.C., 1905; Memphis, Tenn., 1815; Rochester, N.Y., 1750;
New Orleans, 1640; Richmond, Va., 1599; Baltimore, Md.,
1592, and Newark, N.J., 1446.
