# They Came Back--And Are Glad They Did
## Overgrads: Campus 'Senior Citizens' 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
Stanford's "overgrads" are beginning to find
themselves.
Twenty "Undergraduates Over 25" attended a
wine and cheese party last Friday, the first chance
many had to meet their campus peers.
"What was fascinating was the number of people
who came in and said, 'Well, I thought I was the
only one!'
"This was a group that was so glad to discover
each other," enthused Leah Kaplan, a psychiatric
social worker at Cowell Student Health Center and
self-described "catalyst" for the new organization.
There are 90 undergraduates over 25 years old on
campus, part of a national trend for older people to
return to college for a bachelor's degree. The
majority are men — military veterans or "stop-outs"
— but a large number of housewives with families
are also attending full-time.
Golf Not Enough
"My children were growing up, and I decided I
wanted to have a career, but I didn't have the
education to pursue one. I knew that going to
ladies' luncheons and playing golf wasn't what I
wanted to do," explained Jeanne Kennedy, a senior
political science major. She looks forward to
eventually going into city administration, possibly
after graduate school.

Joan Ford, a senior psychology major, had been
doing volunteer teaching and realized that she
"really wanted to be able to enter the education
field on a professional basis."
Probably the most visible overgrad on campus
has been ex-Marine Lacy Atkinson, a 28-year-old
defensive lineman on the varsity football team this
fall. Atkinson, a Vietnam veteran and Purple Heart
recipient, found he could handle the younger
competition on the field well.
"I feel I'm in top condition. A lot of people just
get set to die after they reach their 25th birthday,
but not me."
Enjoys Academic Work
An anthropology major, Atkinson has enjoyed
his work in the academic arena also. He is currently
on an overseas studies tour which includes
archaeological work in Africa.
Margaret Kroells, a junior in sociology, found
concentration difficult after 30 years out of school.
"It's a little more difficult to concentrate. I'd
forgotten how hard it was. I'd gotten out of the
habit of writing or thinking that much about any
particular subject," said Kroells, who hopes to do
social work and is even considering graduate school.
Electrical engineering major Dennis Olds, a
junior, has encountered a few problems familiar to
the older students. Although he "never really

stopped going to school" after dropping out of the
University of Idaho — he attended two technical
schools — he found that "to totally plunge back
into studies is not too easy."
Olds believes that the overgrads sometimes share
difficulties with off-campus transfer students.
"I think transfer students tend to get a little
over-zealous the first quarter. I overloaded myself
this quarter," he said, noting that he could have used
"a little bit of help with the curriculum." Olds
suggested special counseling for the older students.
Solutions Sought
The Undergraduates Over 25 organization is
looking for solutions to such problems of older
students.
"I think that the people in our age group are not
able to take advantage of a lot of things that
younger students can," said Jeanne Kennedy. Thus
the group is planning monthly meetings with
"interesting people in the Stanford community" —
faculty, administrators, and fellow students.
Joan Ford hopes the group can put out a
pamphlet for overgrads. "One of our members,
Gabrielle Edwards, has made up a questionnaire"
whose results could be used for such a pamphlet.
"There's going to be a section in
the new Approaching Stanford for
transfer students that will mention
re-entry problems for students who
return to school," said Karen Murray,
assistant to the dean of students.
On the possibility of a special
orientation fcr older students, Murray
admitted, "There are not any concrete
plans yet. But we're certainly open to
the idea."
A major project of a few of the
overgrads has been development of a
part-time studies plan with the
University. Currently the older
students must pay full tuition and take
full loads, a burden for some overgrads
with families.
An ASSU task force report on
part-time students was prepared by
Joan Ford, Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies B. Michael
Closson and former ASSU Vice
President Beth Garfield. It was
submitted to the Provost's Office last
October.
Closson noted that Provost William
Miller "indicated he was generally
supportive of the idea." Ford and
Closson hope to have a pilot project
underway by autumn, but the plan is
moving slowly.
