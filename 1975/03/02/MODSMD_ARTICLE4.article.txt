# Pre-Meds Crowd British Campus
## 
### PAIGE CHERNO 
Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall says the special summer
program in health care delivery at
Stanford-In-Britain is designed to
co-exist with general studies programs,
despite the fact that the new program
will temporarily crowd general studies
students off the campus.
All 82 spaces at the Cliveden Estate
will be filled by students in the special
program. Twelve general studies
students who applied for the summer
session must now make new plans.
They may transfer to either the
Florence (Italy) or the Tours (France)
campuses. Mancall said students he has
spoken with "love the idea of going to
Florence."

However, Overseas Studies Staff Asst.
Connie Burton said that only one
student has confirmed the transfer to
Florence. Five others, after finding out
they could definitely not stay in
Cliveden (Britain), have made other
arrangements. "We haven't heard yet
from the other six," Burton added.
Mancall said his office had been
"looking for a way to continue the
general program" for the 12 students.
Finding additional housing off the
Cliveden Estate campus was
impossible, he said. Burton said the
students involved "were told their
acceptance for summer was contingent
on the office's finding manageable
housing."
Mancall defended the limiting
aspects of the medical program,
pointing out that it offers pre-meds,
who usually find it difficult to squeeze
in overseas study, the opportunity to
do so. "We might possibly run the
medical program every summer," he
said.
Defends New Calendar
He also defended the new overseas
calendar, which parallels the home
campus schedule and eliminates the
four-day school week and the
three-week break between quarters.
"The break was from the end of the
quarter until the charter [flight] left,"
he explained. Now "there are no more
Stanford charters coming back, so now
we don't limit the break." He said he
hopes people will be encouraged to
travel extensively after their one, two
or three quarters abroad.
Mancall's assistant Ray Higgle said,
"We don't want to de-emphasize
travel. We want to encourage people to
travel inside the area they are
studying." There is a new week-long
break in the middle of the term for
that purpose.

"If you really want to see Europe,"
he added, "it's best done before or
after your stay at a campus or study
center. If you want to see more, you
can always transfer the next quarter."
Mancall said students overseas must
have the same number of class hours as
students at Stanford. With the

addition of the midterm break, the
four-day week became inadequate, he
said.
Riggle said there is not "anybody in
this office who would disagree" that a
large part of the educational
experience comes from traveling
abroad." But "Increasingly, people are
going over for the academic programs."

student has confirmed the transfer to
Florence. Five others, after finding out
they could definitely not stay in
Cliveden (Britain), have made other
arrangements. "We haven't heard yet
from the other six," Burton added.
Mancall said his office had been
"looking for a way to continue the
general program" for the 12 students.
Finding additional housing off the
Cliveden Estate campus was
impossible, he said. Burton said the
students involved "were told their
acceptance for summer was contingent
on the office's finding manageable
housing."
Mancall defended the limiting
aspects of the medical program,
pointing out that it offers pre-meds,
who usually find it difficult to squeeze
in overseas study, the opportunity to
do so. "We might possibly run the
medical program every summer," he
said.
Defends New Calendar
He also defended the new overseas
calendar, which parallels the home
campus schedule and eliminates the
four-day school week and the
three-week break between quarters.
"The break was from the end of the
quarter until the charter [flight] left,"
he explained. Now "there are no more
Stanford charters coming back, so now
we don't limit the break." He said he
hopes people will be encouraged to
travel extensively after their one, two
or three quarters abroad.
Mancall's assistant Ray Higgle said,
"We don't want to de-emphasize
travel. We want to encourage people to
travel inside the area they are
studying." There is a new week-long
break in the middle of the term for
that purpose.

"If you really want to see Europe,"
he added, "it's best done before or
after your stay at a campus or study
center. If you want to see more, you
can always transfer the next quarter."
Mancall said students overseas must
have the same number of class hours as
students at Stanford. With the

addition of the midterm break, the
four-day week became inadequate, he
said.
Riggle said there is not "anybody in
this office who would disagree" that a
large part of the educational
experience comes from traveling
abroad." But "Increasingly, people are
going over for the academic programs."

Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall says the special summer
program in health care delivery at
Stanford-In-Britain is designed to
co-exist with general studies programs,
despite the fact that the new program
will temporarily crowd general studies
students off the campus.
All 82 spaces at the Cliveden Estate
will be filled by students in the special
program. Twelve general studies
students who applied for the summer
session must now make new plans.
They may transfer to either the
Florence (Italy) or the Tours (France)
campuses. Mancall said students he has
spoken with "love the idea of going to
Florence."

However, Overseas Studies Staff Asst.
Connie Burton said that only one
student has confirmed the transfer to
Florence. Five others, after finding out
they could definitely not stay in
