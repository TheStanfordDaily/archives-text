# $12,000 Gold Cross Stolen From Church
## 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputies are following up leads on a
man who allegedly stole a $12,000
solid gold and mosaic cross from
the main altar of Memorial Church
sometime last Thursday morning.
The three-foot-high cross was
reported missing at 9:30 a.m. Friday
by the church janitor. Sheriffs
deputies found that the door to the
organ loft was left unlocked and open,
but were not sure the incident was
connected to the disappearance of the
crucifix.
Though estimating the value of the
cross at $12,000, Art Prof. Lorenz
Eitner noted, "It would be very
difficult to replace. It was made, by
my estimation, in the 1890s by
craftsmen and processes that can no
longer be duplicated."
Lt. Robert Bartoo said his office
has received three reports from
citizens who said they saw the thief
Thursday. The suspect was described
as a white male adult in his early 20s,
wearing a dark grey or black
monk-type robe and sandals. He was
also said to be 5'11" with dark straight

hair, collar-length and combed over
the ears.
Suspect Seen
Barton said the suspect was
reportedly seen asking to have a
wooden staff made for the cross at the
Sequoia High School woodshop in
Redwood City.
He was again observed at 1:30 p.m.
hitch-hiking south on Highway 101
near Millbrae. The cross was partially
concealed in a flannel bag at that time,
Bartoo said.
The suspect was last observed at 6
p.m. Thursday hitch-hiking south on
Highway 101 in Redwood City at the
southbound ramp at Whipple Avenue
and Veterans Boulevard. He was
wearing the monk's outfit and carrying
the cross on the staff, not in the bag,
Bartoo said.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's
office has requested that anyone who
sees a man fitting the description of
the suspect contact the sheriffs
office or the Stanford Department of
Police Services.
Prize Possession
The cross, once the personal
belonging of Mrs. Jane Stanford, was
created for her by the Salviati Studios
of Venice, Italy. It was installed when
the church was dedicated in January
1903, and survived the earthquake of
1906.
The corners of the cross bear
detailed elevations of the four major
basilicas of Rome: St. Peter's, St. John
Lateran, Ste. Maria Maggiore and Sta.
Paul's.
At the crossing is the Lamb of God,
and on the bars are the Sacred Heart,
tilt Chi-Rho monogram of Christ and
the Instruments of the Passion.
