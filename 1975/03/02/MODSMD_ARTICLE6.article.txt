# Marching To Modesto: The Gripe Over Grapes
## 
### RIV WEBER KIM NYEGAARD 
MODESTO—"We want Gallo to
understand we're not going away.
We'll be here for an eternity, if it
takes that long," exclaimed Cesar
Chavez, president and founder of the
United Farmworkers (UFW) at
Saturday's union rally here.
Climaxing a week-long march
from San Francisco, a throng of
UFW supporters, including about 75
Stanford students, met in Modesto's
Gracaeda Park. They joined Chavez
in demanding a secret ballot election
on the choice of unions.
Simultaneously, Ernest Gallo of
the Gallo Wineries issued a
statement saying, "We are surprised
that the UFW have 1 sic ] marched on
Modesto requesting an election by
the 500 Gallo union farmworkers
who are not only in the union of
their choice, but are the highest-paid
farmworkers in the continental
United States."
The marchers arrived here shortly
before noon Saturday in a line thai
stretched two-and-one-half miles.
Estimations of the crowd's size varied
from 6000 to the 10,000 reported by

the San Francisco Examiner.
Modesto police described the march
as "very, very orderly."
Marchers included UFW and
United Auto Workers members and
representatives of California civic
groups and schools.
'65 Workers Marched'
Although Chavez has claimed
support of Gallo workers, Gallo's
director of consumer relations stated
that '"less than 65 of our workers
ever did support the march."
The Modesto Bee published Gallo
charges that the UFW used coercive
measures toward their members in
the Almaden and Paul Masson
wineries. Chavez denied the charge
that he threatened a loss of seniority
for a lack of participation in the
march.
Amid chants of "Cesar Si,
Teamsters No" the marchers
explained their motives for
participating. One woman told a
story of young farmworker's child
who had attempted suicide because
he could not have a second glass of
milk. "I've been hooked ever since.
I've been marching for three days."


CESAR'S CHALLENGE—United Farmworkers (UFW) President Cesar
Chavez declared at a Modesto rally Saturday that he would post a $1 million
bond guaranteeing that if the UFW loses a secret ballot election, "we will call
off a boycott and Gallo and the Teamsters can live happily ever after."
The marchers' intial stop in
Modesto was at the Gallo estate, where
they were met by a banner reading:
"73 more miles to go." Gallo asked
the UFW to support a NLRA
[National Labor Relations Act]-type
law in Sacramento to guarantee
farmworkers' rights."
Ernest Gallo claimed that his firm
"is caught in a jurisdictional dispute
between the UFW and the Teamsters.
We cannot unilaterally break our
contract with the Teamsters. If we did,
we'd be subject to Teamster strikes,
lawsuits and harassment."
The UFW began its boycott of
Gallo in June 1973 when Gallo sent a
letter to his farmworkers stating that
he would recognize the Teamsters as
the new bargaining agent.
Chavez Claims
Chavez claims that "In 1973, while
contract negotiations were underway,
Gallo abruptly ceased discussions,
[and] signed with the Teamster
Union. The majority of the field
workers went out on strike."
In an interview, Gallo cited the
"neutrality" of his company. "Gallo is
an innocent party. It's [a dispute]
between the UFW and the Teamsters.
If the Teamsters and UFW can agree
on the ground rules for an election
that is legally binding on all parties, we
are for it."
Gallo and the Teamsters support
legislation presently pending in
Sacramento which will give
farmworkers the same rights, benefits
and protection given most other
American workers under the National
Labor Relations Act," said Gallo.
Chavez declared at the rally that

the pending legislation is a "carrot and
stick law" which would take away his
boycott weapon. He maintained his
support of worker elections.
Ben Koch, president of the Wine
Distillers and Allied Workers
(AFL-CIO Local 186), described the
relationship between the AFL-CIO and
the UFW. "The AFL-CIO has given
over one-and-a-half million dollars to
the [United Farmworkers]. They |sic]
support the boycott of lettuce and
table grapes, but there is no sanction
of the wine boycott."
Koch described what he called the
self-defeating nature of a boycott of
union-made products [wine bottled in
union plants]: "The AFL-CIO can't
support a wine grape boycott without
slitting our own throats."
Joined AFL-CIO
The UFW joined the AFL-CIO in
1966. AFL-CIO President George
Meany recently revoked support of the
UFW in light of the wine boycott,
AFL-CIO spokesmen said.
Ray Washburn, president of the
Glass Bottle Blowers Local 17 of the
AFL-CIO, said he admired Chavez and
does not believe that the Teamsters
should be in the fields. He continued,
"I am prepared to offer the services of
our local union" to aid in the
settlement of the present dispute.
The conflict is over 200 full-time
workers and 300 part-time workers,
whom Ernest Gallo believes are
"happy." He demanded that the
unions direct their attention to "the
2,300,000 farmworkers who are not
organized, who are making less than
half of what the Gallo workers are
making, who have no fringe benefits.
They are the ones who need the help."

Gallo called the march "a really sad
sight. Children who had been dragged
through the parade, parents who had
been taken from their jobs, some of
them who are well-meaning but
misled."
