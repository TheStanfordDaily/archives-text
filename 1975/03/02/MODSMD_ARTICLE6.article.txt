# Marching To Modesto: The Gripe Over Grapes

### RIV WEBER KIM NYEGAARD 
MODESTO—"We want Gallo to
understand we're not going away.
We'll be here for an eternity, if it
takes that long," exclaimed Cesar
Chavez, president and founder of the
United Farmworkers (UFW) at
Saturday's union rally here.
Climaxing a week-long march
from San Francisco, a throng of
UFW supporters, including about 75
Stanford students, met in Modesto's
Gracaeda Park. They joined Chavez
in demanding a secret ballot election
on the choice of unions.
Simultaneously, Ernest Gallo of
the Gallo Wineries issued a
statement saying, "We are surprised
that the UFW have 1 sic ] marched on
Modesto requesting an election by
the 500 Gallo union farmworkers
who are not only in the union of
their choice, but are the highest-paid
farmworkers in the continental
United States."
The marchers arrived here shortly
before noon Saturday in a line thai
stretched two-and-one-half miles.
Estimations of the crowd's size varied
from 6000 to the 10,000 reported by

the San Francisco Examiner.
Modesto police described the march
as "very, very orderly."
Marchers included UFW and
United Auto Workers members and
representatives of California civic
groups and schools.
'65 Workers Marched'
Although Chavez has claimed
support of Gallo workers, Gallo's
director of consumer relations stated
that '"less than 65 of our workers
ever did support the march."
The Modesto Bee published Gallo
charges that the UFW used coercive
measures toward their members in
the Almaden and Paul Masson
wineries. Chavez denied the charge
that he threatened a loss of seniority
for a lack of participation in the
march.
Amid chants of "Cesar Si,
Teamsters No" the marchers
explained their motives for
participating. One woman told a
story of young farmworker's child
who had attempted suicide because
he could not have a second glass of
milk. "I've been hooked ever since.
I've been marching for three days."


CESAR'S CHALLENGE—United Farmworkers (UFW) President Cesar
Chavez declared at a Modesto rally Saturday that he would post a $1 million
bond guaranteeing that if the UFW loses a secret ballot election, "we will call
off a boycott and Gallo and the Teamsters can live happily ever after."
