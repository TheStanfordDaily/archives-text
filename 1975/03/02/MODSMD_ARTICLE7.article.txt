## Retain Filibusters 
### 
The U.S. Senate will vote today on whether it wants to
â€¢nd one of its most venerable traditions, the filibuster. We
relieve the filibuster has served the nation well over the
years, and urge the Senate to retain it.
The current filibuster rule requires a two-thirds vote of
the Senate to stop debate on any motion. It thus protects
the right of a concerted minority to block legislation to
which it is strongly opposed.
In recent years, the filibuster has been used most often
by conservative senators seeking to block progressive civil
rights legislation. But there is no reason why it cannot be
used by liberal senators as well.
We can foresee a time when public opinion, and a bare
majority of senators, supports potentially repressive and
dangerous legislation. Perhaps a filibuster would be the only
way to block such legislation.
If today's opponents of the filibuster get their way, they
may someday be sorry.
