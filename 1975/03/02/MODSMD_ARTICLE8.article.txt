# Protests: Welcome
## 
### 
Following an absence of more than two years, the
student demonstration has returned to campus. During the
past two weeks, students have mourned the "death of
undergraduate education at Stanford," and protested
cutbacks in minority financial aid. In all, about 1000
students have taken part in three separate rallies.
While we do not necessarily agree with the views of
protesters, we are glad to see students again showing
involvement in issues which are important to them. We think
that the protests have already had some effect in convincing
the University to review its decisions scuttling SWOPSI and
cutting minority aid. We hope that University will continue
listening to what such protesters have to say.
