# Praise For Horton
## 
### 
In a letter to the Daily on Feb.
20, Florence Moore resident Ken
Remson waved the red flag and
urged us all to "appreciate Larry
Horton for what he really is."
I certainly agree with his
suggestion. It's about time we
appreciated Horton for what he
is: an associate dean on housing to
whom we have charged the
impossible task of pleasing all of
the people all of the time.
Horton acted swiftly on a
proposal to create 150 new spaces
for this autumn quarter to relieve
the housing shortage. Students
then complained about
construction noise. Remson states
that Horton has evaded the issue
of compensation for the affected
students. Should that issue be
decided even before the nature of
the inconvenience is really
known?
Remson also states that Horton
has shown "total disregard for the
rights of students." Before issuing
so dramatic a statement, I wish
Remson would be more certain of
his facts. Checking with Karen
Murray, head of the Flo Mo
Advisory Committee, I learned
that Horton never implied to the
group that it would have the
power to stop the construction
project, as Remson maintains.
As with all university
committees, Murray said, the
group was strictly advisory in
nature. What Horton did tell the
committee was that its
recommendations regarding the
project would be seriously
considered, and they have been.

On the general
housing-fraternity issue, Horton
has sought the input of students
and alumni members in more than
56 meetings held since the month
of July.
Horton sought the advice of
the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) as soon as the
school year opened; he had no
intention of solving the housing
issue tyranically and
single-handedly. COSS then
established a subcommittee on
housing, of which Horton was a
key member, but not a voting
one. The subcommittee's final
recommendation combined the
proposals of a student, Suzi
Harmatz, and an alumni member,
Pitch Johnson. It was not the sole
invention of Horton in his reputed
effort to kill fraternities.
On the subcommittee's agenda
now is the decision of where to
place Stanford's two new theme
houses â€” Stanford-in-Stanford
and the French House. Horton has
urged the subcommittee to choose
possible houses for the programs
quickly. In that way, present
residents of the houses will have a
fair opportunity to respond to
and discuss the issue before dead
week and finals.
We've got to realize that
certain difficulties are beyond
Horton's control. He did not
create the housing shortage, nor is
he inventor and dictator of all
housing policy.
