# X Claims Prejudice On Tenure
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS First of Two Parts 
Cedric X, assistant professor of
psychology and communication,
claims that decisions by those
departments to deny him tenure were
based on religious and political
prejudice.
"There is a conspiracy at the high
levels of this University to rid Stanford
of its religious professors and its
religiously oriented professors," X, a
black Muslim, told the Daily last week.
"The administration is conducting a
religious persecution aimed at those
who oppose its materialistic,
aetheistic, pseudo-scientific views."
X explained that he opposes the
"anti-life" population control
philosophy reflected in research
conducted by some University
departments because population
control violates his religious principles.
He insisted that University
researchers are attempting to develop a
scientific way to destroy social
dissidents.
No Plans For Appeal
Although X contended that his
teaching and scholarship are of such
high quality that he merits tenure, he
said that he has no plans to appeal the
decisions of the departments.
"I will appeal to no one but Allah,"
he declared. "It is personally
demeaning for me to beg for tenure."
Nathan Maccoby, director of the
Institute for Communication
Research, categorically denied that X's
controversial religious and political
views played any part in the decision
to deny him tenure.
"Mis political opinions were always
his alone. So were his religious views,"
Maccoby said. "They were not taken
into account by the Communication
Department. There was no prejudice."
Eleanor Maccoby, Psychology
Department chairman, said that her
department did not discriminate
against X on the basis of his views in
religion and politics.
University 'Feared' His Faith
X claimed that after his conversion
to the Islamic faith in 1971, the
University began to harrass him
because it feared that he would
inculcate the "spiritual values of the
East" in what he called the
materialistic students.
X, who taught a freshman seminar
in African Science and Religion during
1973-74, claims that he was forbidden
to teach any more freshman seminars
after University officials recognized
the implications of his Islamic faith.
But Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs claimed yesterday that
religious prejudice had nothing to do
with the decision to refuse X to teach
a seminar.
Gibbs said that a letter to X from
Marvin Chodorow, director of the
freshman seminar program, explained
that the description of the proposed
seminar was insufficient while its
lengthy reading list "did not serve to
clarify its intended content."
No Secretary
X also claimed that the Psychology
Department probably deprived him of
a secretary because he converted to
the Muslim doctrine.
But Mrs. Maccoby explained that X
lost his secretary because no research
funds remained with which to pay her.
"We went to greath lengths not to
fire her," Mrs. Maccoby said. Mrs.
Maccoby added that the obtaining of
research funds for full-time secretary is
the duty of each individual professor.
She added that X was provided with
part-time secretarial services.
Another example of anti-Muslim
prejudice, according to X, was
the ftychology Department's decision
to review his case several months
before that of Asst. Prof. Lee Ross.
Early Decision To Fire
X insisted that his own case was
decided earlier because the Psychology
Department had already made its
decision to fire him.
But Mrs. Maccoby said that X's case
was decided earlier than Ross' because
some information regarding Ross had
not yet been received.
X said that he was particularly
upset that after his conversion, he was
not asked to remain on the
University's Science and Ethics
Committee, which must approve all
research involving human beings.
X specualted that he was dropped
from the committee after he protested
experiments involving methadone,
which he said can cause sterility.
According to X, most experiments
involving human beings are premised
on the assumption that man is material
rather than a spiritual creature.
'Ideological Containment'
"Man is something other than a
material object subject to the whims
of people who take it on themselves to
decide who will live and who will die,"
X declared.
X claimed that his removal from
the committee was probably another
attempt by the University to silence
religious professors.
"The University has a policy of
ideological containment," X said.
"This is in marked contrast to what a
University should be â€” a place where
various views can be freely expressed."
When asked what he plans to do
after he leaves Stanford, X said, "1 am
perfectly content to serve as an
untenured gatekeeper in the kingdom
of Allah."

X's scholarship and teaching.)
