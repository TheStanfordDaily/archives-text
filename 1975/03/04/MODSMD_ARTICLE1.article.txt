# X Claims Prejudice On Tenure
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS First of Two Parts 
Cedric X, assistant professor of
psychology and communication,
claims that decisions by those
departments to deny him tenure were
based on religious and political
prejudice.
"There is a conspiracy at the high
levels of this University to rid Stanford
of its religious professors and its
religiously oriented professors," X, a
black Muslim, told the Daily last week.
"The administration is conducting a
religious persecution aimed at those
who oppose its materialistic,
aetheistic, pseudo-scientific views."
X explained that he opposes the
"anti-life" population control
philosophy reflected in research
conducted by some University
departments because population
control violates his religious principles.
He insisted that University
researchers are attempting to develop a
scientific way to destroy social
dissidents.
No Plans For Appeal
Although X contended that his
teaching and scholarship are of such
high quality that he merits tenure, he
said that he has no plans to appeal the
decisions of the departments.
"I will appeal to no one but Allah,"
he declared. "It is personally
demeaning for me to beg for tenure."
Nathan Maccoby, director of the
Institute for Communication
Research, categorically denied that X's
controversial religious and political
views played any part in the decision
to deny him tenure.
"Mis political opinions were always
his alone. So were his religious views,"
Maccoby said. "They were not taken
into account by the Communication
Department. There was no prejudice."
Eleanor Maccoby, Psychology
Department chairman, said that her
department did not discriminate
against X on the basis of his views in
religion and politics.
University 'Feared' His Faith
X claimed that after his conversion
to the Islamic faith in 1971, the
University began to harrass him
because it feared that he would
inculcate the "spiritual values of the
East" in what he called the
materialistic students.
X, who taught a freshman seminar
in African Science and Religion during
1973-74, claims that he was forbidden
to teach any more freshman seminars
after University officials recognized
the implications of his Islamic faith.
But Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs claimed yesterday that
religious prejudice had nothing to do
with the decision to refuse X to teach
a seminar.
Gibbs said that a letter to X from
Marvin Chodorow, director of the
freshman seminar program, explained
