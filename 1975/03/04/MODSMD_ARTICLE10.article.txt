# Minorities Deserve Extra Assistance
## 
### 
Jim Wascher's column on minority
privileges (Daily, Feb. 24) has forced me to
write my first Daily column in four years as
an undergraduate.
It is practically sacrilege in this country to
espouse anything other than equality, even
though inequality exists in work
opportunities, education, and housing. Yet
now that minorities in this country are
beginning to experience the benefits of first
class citizenship, never has the chorus for
equality been louder among white
Americans.
The reason is, of course, that now whites
are beginning to realize that equality for all
means rectifying the inequality that has
existed for hundreds of years, i.e. taking
from the "haves" to give to the "have nots."
It is a sacrifice that many are apparently
unwilling to make. The speciousness of
Wascher's arguments are pointed out by the
simple fact that minorities in this country are
not equal to whites; minorities on the average
make less money than their white
counterparts (40 percent less for a family of
four), receive poorer educations, and are
discriminated against in finding housing and

jobs.
"Last hired and first fired" has taken on a
cruel new significance in these hard economic
times as minorities who were hired as a part
of "affirmative action" programs find
themselves the first victims of cutbacks; the
black unemployment rate is over twice that
of whites.
Things are not equal, and until they are,
special allowances are going to have to be
made for minorities in terms of the
disadvantaged backgrounds many of them
come from.
It's a dangerous trap to fall into, Stanford
students, to believe that you made it here
because you were better than a number of
other people.
It's important to remember that for every
one of us here, there are dozens who had just
as much potential, but not the same
advantages as we.
For years white Americans tolerated (and
still do) the inequalities and discrimination
that minorities must face whenever they go
to look for housing, or go to look for a job.
Even as a Stanford graduate, it is statistically
probable that I will earn substantially less

Timuel Block
than my white counterpart. Yet now you
want to play fair, as long as whites get to set
the rules.
Wascher mentioned students in the past
who contributed money and even faced
physical dangers to help register black voters
11 years ago. This involved some self-sacrifice
and commitment on their part. Nothing has
changed. In order for equality for all to
become a reality, it will involve over a
substantial period of time some inequality —
at least by white standards — to rectify the
evils of hundreds of years. It was fine and
laudable for whites to express their concern
about wrongs in our society in the past
through sit-ins, voter registration drives, etc.
But in the end, they could go back to their
comfortable homes, while we had to live on a
day to day basis with the problems of racism
and inequality.
The question then is, white America, now
that it begins to affect you personally, do
you still believe in the high ideals you
expressed during the 60s?
Where is your commitment now?

now that minorities in this country are
beginning to experience the benefits of first
class citizenship, never has the chorus for
equality been louder among white
Americans.
The reason is, of course, that now whites
are beginning to realize that equality for all
means rectifying the inequality that has
existed for hundreds of years, i.e. taking
from the "haves" to give to the "have nots."
It is a sacrifice that many are apparently
unwilling to make. The speciousness of
Wascher's arguments are pointed out by the
simple fact that minorities in this country are
not equal to whites; minorities on the average
make less money than their white
counterparts (40 percent less for a family of
four), receive poorer educations, and are
discriminated against in finding housing and

jobs.
"Last hired and first fired" has taken on a
cruel new significance in these hard economic
times as minorities who were hired as a part
of "affirmative action" programs find
themselves the first victims of cutbacks; the
black unemployment rate is over twice that
of whites.
Things are not equal, and until they are,
special allowances are going to have to be
made for minorities in terms of the
disadvantaged backgrounds many of them
come from.
It's a dangerous trap to fall into, Stanford
students, to believe that you made it here
because you were better than a number of
other people.
It's important to remember that for every
one of us here, there are dozens who had just
as much potential, but not the same
advantages as we.
For years white Americans tolerated (and
still do) the inequalities and discrimination
that minorities must face whenever they go
to look for housing, or go to look for a job.
Even as a Stanford graduate, it is statistically
probable that I will earn substantially less

than my white counterpart. Yet now you
want to play fair, as long as whites get to set
the rules.
Wascher mentioned students in the past
who contributed money and even faced
physical dangers to help register black voters
11 years ago. This involved some self-sacrifice
and commitment on their part. Nothing has
changed. In order for equality for all to
become a reality, it will involve over a
substantial period of time some inequality —
at least by white standards — to rectify the
evils of hundreds of years. It was fine and
laudable for whites to express their concern
about wrongs in our society in the past
through sit-ins, voter registration drives, etc.
But in the end, they could go back to their
comfortable homes, while we had to live on a
day to day basis with the problems of racism
and inequality.
The question then is, white America, now
that it begins to affect you personally, do
you still believe in the high ideals you
expressed during the 60s?
Where is your commitment now?

espouse anything other than equality, even
though inequality exists in work
opportunities, education, and housing. Yet
