# Notes On Tenure, Bureaucrats, Frats

News Notes: Rumors that Lewis Spitz will
step down from his position as associate
Dean of Humanities and Scieces have been
denied by Spitz.
Those who have used Spitz as a scapegoat
in recent tenuring decisions will be upset by
the news. Spitz has been surrounded by a
storm of controversy ever since Asst.
Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish was denied
tenure here.
Spitz' now-infamous remark, "If a student
wants a professor to devote full time to him,
he shouldn't come to Stanford," has caused
him to be lambasted by many persons who
have largely overlooked the paramount role
of the Appointments and Promotions
Committee in the whole mess.
Although Spitz has always praised men
who do good research, he has never openly
belittled the importance of teaching in the
tenuring procedures. In private, he still holds
to those views.
But the secret A&P Committee apparently
has no such qualms. Its members, whom
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Halsey
Royden refuses to name, have discouraged
assistant professors from devoting themselves
to teaching and have turned at least one
department here into a "shambles."
One can only assume that members of the
A&P Committee are afraid to sign their work
by admitting their identities, though Royden
offers the sham excuse of shielding members
from undue pressure. President Richard
Lyman, asked recently why the members'
names aren't public, expressed surprise that
the committee was secret and promised to
"check into" the reasons.
At Amherst College in Amherst, Mass.,
students know just who comprises the

tenuring committee (known there as the
Committee of Six). Inconsistent application
of nebulous standards has caused problems
there, according to the Amherst Student,
but committee members still manage to deny
tenure to a select few.

No undue pressure there.
In an editorial, the Student called for
opening up the deliberations of Amherst's.
Committee of Six to public view. How
cruelly farcical that suggestion seems here,
where students don't even know who
committee members are, much less how they
go about their business.

Followups: "How dare you write about
me?" complained one girl after this reporter's
column on Stanford's bungling bureaucracy.
Apparently, the frightful episodes
experienced by Spike Miller had all happened
to her during her Stanford experience.
While each of Spike's confrontations was
based on actual happenings here, details were
changed in each case to protect the innocent.
That girl deserves an apology — from the
smiling secretaries who stepped on her toes.
The Registrar's Office says it does
"everything possible" to maintain correct

mailing addresses. But persons who must deal
with the ASSU Travel Service or the Single
Student Housing Office must still apparently
play an expensive game of Russian roulette
with the officeworkers.
One woman, responding to the same
column, made a kindly suggestion: "Don't
forget to look for the good, too, in our daily
living — though I know it can seem ghastly
and farcical some days."
Thanks for the suggestion, J.G. To start it
off right, I'll wish a happy birthday to March
4 Pisceans.
Another column — written by this
reporter before he became this co-opinions
editor — dealt with the problems of the
fraternities and the housing draw.
At the time, many fraternity friends let it
be known that they were ex-friends. But now
that the disgraceful report from the
Committee On Services to Students has
shown just how bad things can get, more
than a few "bros" have announced that
maybe the plan wasn't so bad, after all.
It was originally intended as a compromise
between positions espoused by the
Inter-Fraternity Council and the housing
office. Unfortunately, the frats stuck to their
guns and so did the housing office.
They may get nothing because Dean of
Students James Lyons has threatened to wipe
out the frat system if students press for
extensions of "subjective selectivity." While
Lyons should be commended for his
opposition to the archaic notion of subjective
selectivity, his belligerence contributes
nothing to the presently strained situation.
