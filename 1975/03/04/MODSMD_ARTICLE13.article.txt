More On Moynihan
Editor:
Regarding the Feb. 20 Daily
editorial entitled "Moynihan—
Yawn," it seems to me
that the selection of the
commencement speaker is
deserving of more than this
flippant headline.
A letter by Ben Brown
appearing in the same issue
addressed the record of Daniel P.
Moynihan's work concerning
blacks in America, and its
implications. I believe that the
Daily should have shown more
sensitivity to the issue.
Brown's letter raised important
questions concerning the position
of Stanford in the larger societal
context. That is, what criteria
would lead this institution to
select an individual with
Moynihan's "credits" to speak at
a ceremony supposedly indicative
of the interests and values of the
Stanford community, and
specifically of the graduating
class?
The Daily emphasized the
selection of Moynihan as an
indication of University bias in

favor of academic prestige over
"non-academic" criteria. Thus,
they totally ignored the issue
raised by Brown — the social
responsibility of this university.
The Daily should have recognized
the necessity of assessing
Moynihan's credentials in terms of
his stance vis a vis black
communities in the United States,
in addition to considering his
standing in academic circles.
I believe that Moynihan's
selection as commencement
speaker should be opposed by
members of the Stanford
community who believe that the
institution of which they are a
part has responsibilities extending
beyond the sterile realm of
academic prestige, responsibilities
which entail the obviously great
influence Stanford's actions have
on the society outside its walls.
Further, I find that the
Daily's remarks concerning
Moynihan's selection constituted
a total disregard of the points
raised in Brown's letter, and
described the situation in a way
both superficial and insulting to
the members of the Stanford

community. I urge caring
members of the community to
make known their concern for
this crucial matter.

Identification Needed
Editor:
The Daily's Feb. 12 account of
Phyllis Schlafly's talk "What's
Wrong With Equal Rights For
Women?", and of the
diametrically opposite position
taken by the panelists, Dr. Rita
Campbell and History Prof. Carl
N. Degler, was generally very good
— both clear and well-balanced. I
was nevertheless disappointed on
two scores.
For one thing the Daily might
well have mentioned the fact that
the remarks of the visiting speaker
and the panelists were followed
by a long period of questions
from the floor. These programs
sponsored by the Stanford
Conservative Forum are designed
to present to the Stanford and
nearby communities, but above all
to Stanford students, well known
and qualified speakers and
panelists who offer decidedly
contrasting points of view on
subjects of national and
sometimes of international
importance and to give students
an opportunity to raise pertinent
questions about the views of both
speaker and panelists.
Those who attended the
program (well over 500 people)
are aware that most of the
questions came from Stanford
students and that many of them
were sharp and penetrating
attempts to probe into a subject
that has stirred a tremendous
amount of discussion and debate
throughout the country.
My second objection arises
from the failure to make any
reference at all to the fact that the
program was sponsored by the
Forum. It does not seem
unreasonable to expect of the
Daily the courtesy of recognizing
and identifying the organizations
that take the initiative and the
time, and make the effort, to
arrange lively programs and
present them to audiences largely
composed of Stanford students.

Kudos For Cast
Editor:
Bravo! for the entire cast of
Beggar's Opera last week. Laurine
Towler's fantastic fete of stepping
into the role of Lucy Lockit that
same afternoon (due to Elizabeth
James's illness) as well as handling
her own role of Jenny Diver was
splendid.
The cast was fantastic in
supporting her throughout the
play and it was a pleasure
watching genuine showman spirit
carry the Stanford Drama
Department's production to a
successful conclusion. Hooray for
everyone.
