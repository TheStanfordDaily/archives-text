# Abortion A Right

The manslaughter conviction ol
Dr. Ken Edelin in Boston last
week for a legal abortion
underlined the threat to women's
choice to discontinue pregnancy.
It threatens to take women from
the hands of the doctors and
throw them into the hands of the
butchers.
The trial revealed the fact that
a resident and a nurse, both
favoring forced pregnancy, lied in
their initial statements to the
prosecutor, which were the
original grounds for the case.
According to the jurors, the
deciding factor was the pictures of
the fetus (a typical emotional
ploy of forced pregnancy groups).
This gross miscarriage of justice is
just one facet of the attempt to
deprive women of their
constitutional right of choice.
Various groups have achieved
increasing success in forcing
women to continue unwanted
pregnancies. These forced
pregnancy groups are attempting
to overturn the Supreme Court
ruling of two years ago by passing
a constitutional amendment.
The one that holds the greatest
danger of being passed is the
Whitehurst amendment which
would return control of abortion
to the states. This would spell the
end to a woman's right to choose,
since the forced pregnancy groups
are well-organized and
well-financed. Yet a strong
majority favors legal abortion.
Already, the use of Medical and
Medicaid for abortions has been
curtailed â€” a clear indication of
prejudice against poor women.
Abortion is needed because
there is no method of
contraception that is safe and 100
percent effective.
Many children are alive and
healthy today because diseases
affecting the fetus and new-born
have been conquered by research
on recently aborted fetuses. But
fetal research is also being
curtailed. The development of a
technique for testing for sickle
cell anemia has been halted by
Congress, pending a Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) study of all fetal research.
Banning further research would
banish untold numbers of children
into lives of lifelong disability or
early death.
Forced pregnancy groups
overlook the many studies that
show that an unwanted child is
much more likely to be beaten or
neglected. Stanford Law School
Assoc. Prof. Michael Wald reports
that there are between 300,000
and four million cases of child
abuse or neglect each year in the
U.S. Most importantly, making
abortions illegal would not
prevent women from aborting
unwanted pregnancies. Before the
Supreme Court decision, it was
estimated that over one million
illegal abortions were performed a
year in the U.S. These resulted in
50 to 100 deaths per 100,000
people and innumerable cases of
infection, sterility and other
complications.
Immediate and continuous
action is needed to prevent the
forced pregnancy groups from
burdening the world with more
unwanted children. Members of
Congress want to hear from
people who favor freedom of
choice. This is one situation where
letters to congressmen count. I
urge students to write to their
congressmen on this issue.
