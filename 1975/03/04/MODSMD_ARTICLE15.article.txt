## Alums Discuss Stanford's Good And Bad 
### BETTY GOODWIN (Last of two parts 
"Academically," says John
Brodie (B.A. 1957), "I don't
think I degenerated here, but I
sure as hell didn't learn much."
Brodie, sports director of
KRON-TV in San Francisco and
former quarterback for the San
Francisco 49ers, is a
champ.
He broke all Stanford passing
records, played in the College
All-Star Game, was named Most
Valuable Player in that game, and
was an unanimous All-American
choice in 1956. His titles continue
ad infinitum.
"As, Bs, Cs and Ds are very
irrelevant," he says."I don't see
why they'd let anyone through a
course unless they knew 100
percent of the information
covered."
Learning Not Academic
Brodie says he wasn't interested
in any area of education where he
couldn't see "an application"
towards what he wanted to do
later in life.
"The whole learning experience
was outstanding," he says, "but in
my case it wasn't academic.
"Stanford was the best place in
the country to play football; I iiad
excellent coaching. So for my
interests, Stanford was just
perfect."
The only difference between

the football here and with the
49ers, Brodie explains,
"was the intensity. In school you
play as a part of your curriculum,
but professionally, you're playing
as a provider."
A Former 'Zete"
A former "Zete," Brodie recalls
the wild group of people living in

the fraternity then.
"We were just trying to stay
above board ... Part of our time
was spent getting out of trouble,
and part of our time was spent
getting in it."
Individually, he says, the
members were "responsible and
had large goals," but collectively,

"we were irresponsible ... It was
a ball."
Of his experiences here, Brodie
adds, "Had I done it again, 1
probably would have done it the
same way. I dug it."
Edith Head
"I didn't have a particularly
good time at Stanford," recalls
costume designer Edith Head
(M.A. 1920), Stanford's most
"Oscared" alumna.
Head has received 30 Academy
Award nominations and eight
Academy Awards in her
unmatched career. The latest
Oscar was for her costumes in
The Sting.
"I didn't have a lot of money
and I don't think Stanford was
particularly in love with people
who" — she stops herself and says,
"I just didn't have a particularly
good time."
"1 have nothing against
Stanford," she explains. "With my
grades I could have gone
anywhere.
"Academically, I picked
Stanford over any university in
the United States. Stanford has
the finest teaching staff in the
world."
But she says she owes none of
her success to Stanford.
"I trained to be a language
teacher at Stanford, but I'm not
in that field now."
Pulitzer Prize winning novelist

N. Scott Momaday (M.A. 1960,
Ph.D. 1963), is a professor of
English and comparative literature
here.
Momaday, the first American
Indian to win the Pulitzer Prize,
won that distinction in fiction
for his novel, House of Dawn.
"I learned a great deal about
writing here," says Momaday. "1
came under the influence of fine
and stimulating professors, more
stimulating than 1 had ever
experienced before."
Momaday says his advisor Yvor
Winters ''made the biggest
impression on me. He knew a lot
about poetry and he inspired me."
'Coming Home'
Momaday knew little about
traditional poetry before he came
here. "I learned about it here and
incorporated it in my writing. It
made a big difference."
After receiving his Ph.D.,
Momaday taught at the University
of California at Santa Barbara and
later at Berkeley until 1972, when
he came here to teach. "I've
always felt deeply about Stanford.
It was great fun to come back; in
sense it was like coming home."
A teaching assistant in
English when he was a student
here, Momaday now sees changes
in the student body. "They seem
to me more mature," he says,

"more intense."
Dr. Dixie Lee Ray (Ph.D.
1958), former chairperson of the
Atomic Energy Commission and
now assistant secretary of state
responsible for oceans and
international environmental and
scientific affairs says, "There's no
question in my mind. I got my
basic professional training in
marine biology from my graduate
work here."
The most important thing a
college education can give a
person, says Ray, is a "thorough
competence" in a field of
knowledge and "expertise," so he can

become a specialist in one area.
But, she explains, while
developing that expertise, you are
simultaneously developing a
"broad base" of knowledge in
that field. In her case, that base of
knowledge was the whole
biological field.
"Both," she says, "are
necessary.
"What I learned at Stanford
was the basis for my whole
professional career," she says.
"Besides, when you get your
degree at Stanford, people look at
you with respect. And that's
nice."

Individually, he says, the
members were "responsible and
had large goals," but collectively,

"we were irresponsible ... It was
a ball."
Of his experiences here, Brodie
adds, "Had I done it again, 1
probably would have done it the
same way. I dug it."
Edith Head
"I didn't have a particularly
good time at Stanford," recalls
costume designer Edith Head
(M.A. 1920), Stanford's most
"Oscared" alumna.
Head has received 30 Academy
Award nominations and eight
Academy Awards in her
unmatched career. The latest
Oscar was for her costumes in
The Sting.
"I didn't have a lot of money
and I don't think Stanford was
particularly in love with people
who" — she stops herself and says,
"I just didn't have a particularly
good time."
"1 have nothing against
Stanford," she explains. "With my
grades I could have gone
anywhere.
"Academically, I picked
Stanford over any university in
the United States. Stanford has
the finest teaching staff in the
world."
But she says she owes none of
her success to Stanford.
"I trained to be a language
teacher at Stanford, but I'm not
in that field now."
Pulitzer Prize winning novelist

N. Scott Momaday (M.A. 1960,
Ph.D. 1963), is a professor of
English and comparative literature
here.
Momaday, the first American
Indian to win the Pulitzer Prize,
won that distinction in fiction
for his novel, House of Dawn.
"I learned a great deal about
writing here," says Momaday. "1
came under the influence of fine
and stimulating professors, more
stimulating than 1 had ever
experienced before."
Momaday says his advisor Yvor
Winters ''made the biggest
impression on me. He knew a lot
about poetry and he inspired me."
'Coming Home'
Momaday knew little about
traditional poetry before he came
here. "I learned about it here and
incorporated it in my writing. It
made a big difference."
After receiving his Ph.D.,
Momaday taught at the University
of California at Santa Barbara and
later at Berkeley until 1972, when
he came here to teach. "I've
always felt deeply about Stanford.
It was great fun to come back; in
sense it was like coming home."
A teaching assistant in
English when he was a student
here, Momaday now sees changes
in the student body. "They seem
to me more mature," he says,

"more intense."
Dr. Dixie Lee Ray (Ph.D.
1958), former chairperson of the
Atomic Energy Commission and
now assistant secretary of state
responsible for oceans and
international environmental and
scientific affairs says, "There's no
question in my mind. I got my
basic professional training in
marine biology from my graduate
work here."
The most important thing a
college education can give a
person, says Ray, is a "thorough
competence" in a field of
knowledge and "expertise," so he can

become a specialist in one area.
But, she explains, while
developing that expertise, you are
simultaneously developing a
"broad base" of knowledge in
that field. In her case, that base of
knowledge was the whole
biological field.
"Both," she says, "are
necessary.
"What I learned at Stanford
was the basis for my whole
professional career," she says.
"Besides, when you get your
degree at Stanford, people look at
you with respect. And that's
nice."

HAVING A BALL—"Stanford was the best place in the country to
play football," says Stanford alum John Brodie. Brodie, now sports
director for KRON-TV, is a former Stanford and San Francisco
Forty-Niner quarterback whose learning experience at Stanford
"wasn't academic."

"Academically," says John
Brodie (B.A. 1957), "I don't
think I degenerated here, but I
sure as hell didn't learn much."
Brodie, sports director of
KRON-TV in San Francisco and
former quarterback for the San
Francisco 49ers, is a
champ.
He broke all Stanford passing
records, played in the College
All-Star Game, was named Most
Valuable Player in that game, and
was an unanimous All-American
choice in 1956. His titles continue
ad infinitum.
"As, Bs, Cs and Ds are very
irrelevant," he says."I don't see
why they'd let anyone through a
course unless they knew 100
percent of the information
covered."
Learning Not Academic
Brodie says he wasn't interested
in any area of education where he
couldn't see "an application"
towards what he wanted to do
later in life.
"The whole learning experience
was outstanding," he says, "but in
my case it wasn't academic.
"Stanford was the best place in
the country to play football; I iiad
excellent coaching. So for my
interests, Stanford was just
perfect."
The only difference between

the football here and with the
49ers, Brodie explains,
"was the intensity. In school you
play as a part of your curriculum,
but professionally, you're playing
as a provider."

A former "Zete," Brodie recalls
the wild group of people living in

the fraternity then.

experienced before."
Momaday says his advisor Yvor
Winters ''made the biggest
impression on me. He knew a lot
about poetry and he inspired me."
'Coming Home'
Momaday knew little about
traditional poetry before he came
here. "I learned about it here and
incorporated it in my writing. It
made a big difference."
After receiving his Ph.D.,
Momaday taught at the University
of California at Santa Barbara and
later at Berkeley until 1972, when
he came here to teach. "I've
always felt deeply about Stanford.
It was great fun to come back; in
sense it was like coming home."
A teaching assistant in
English when he was a student
here, Momaday now sees changes
in the student body. "They seem
to me more mature," he says,

"more intense."
Dr. Dixie Lee Ray (Ph.D.
1958), former chairperson of the
Atomic Energy Commission and
now assistant secretary of state
responsible for oceans and
international environmental and
scientific affairs says, "There's no
question in my mind. I got my
basic professional training in
marine biology from my graduate
work here."
The most important thing a
college education can give a
person, says Ray, is a "thorough
competence" in a field of
knowledge and "expertise," so he can

become a specialist in one area.
But, she explains, while
developing that expertise, you are
simultaneously developing a
"broad base" of knowledge in
that field. In her case, that base of
knowledge was the whole
biological field.
"Both," she says, "are
necessary.
"What I learned at Stanford
was the basis for my whole
professional career," she says.
"Besides, when you get your
degree at Stanford, people look at
you with respect. And that's
nice."

HAVING A BALL—"Stanford was the best place in the country to
play football," says Stanford alum John Brodie. Brodie, now sports
director for KRON-TV, is a former Stanford and San Francisco
Forty-Niner quarterback whose learning experience at Stanford
"wasn't academic."

"Academically," says John
Brodie (B.A. 1957), "I don't
think I degenerated here, but I
sure as hell didn't learn much."
Brodie, sports director of
KRON-TV in San Francisco and
former quarterback for the San
Francisco 49ers, is a
champ.
He broke all Stanford passing
records, played in the College
All-Star Game, was named Most
Valuable Player in that game, and
was an unanimous All-American
choice in 1956. His titles continue
ad infinitum.
"As, Bs, Cs and Ds are very
irrelevant," he says."I don't see
why they'd let anyone through a
course unless they knew 100
percent of the information
covered."
Learning Not Academic
Brodie says he wasn't interested
in any area of education where he
couldn't see "an application"
towards what he wanted to do
later in life.
"The whole learning experience
was outstanding," he says, "but in
my case it wasn't academic.
"Stanford was the best place in
the country to play football; I iiad
excellent coaching. So for my
interests, Stanford was just
perfect."
The only difference between

the football here and with the
49ers, Brodie explains,
"was the intensity. In school you
play as a part of your curriculum,
but professionally, you're playing
as a provider."
A Former 'Zete"
A former "Zete," Brodie recalls
the wild group of people living in

the fraternity then.
"We were just trying to stay
above board ... Part of our time
was spent getting out of trouble,
and part of our time was spent
getting in it."
Individually, he says, the
members were "responsible and
had large goals," but collectively,

"we were irresponsible ... It was
a ball."
Of his experiences here, Brodie
adds, "Had I done it again, 1
probably would have done it the
same way. I dug it."
Edith Head
"I didn't have a particularly
good time at Stanford," recalls
costume designer Edith Head
(M.A. 1920), Stanford's most
"Oscared" alumna.
Head has received 30 Academy
Award nominations and eight
Academy Awards in her
unmatched career. The latest
Oscar was for her costumes in
The Sting.
"I didn't have a lot of money
and I don't think Stanford was
particularly in love with people
who" — she stops herself and says,
"I just didn't have a particularly
good time."
"1 have nothing against
Stanford," she explains. "With my
grades I could have gone
anywhere.
"Academically, I picked
Stanford over any university in
the United States. Stanford has
the finest teaching staff in the
world."
But she says she owes none of
her success to Stanford.
"I trained to be a language
teacher at Stanford, but I'm not
in that field now."
Pulitzer Prize winning novelist

N. Scott Momaday (M.A. 1960,

for his novel, House of Dawn.
