# Bug Me

### Patty Fels 
When "Bug Me" first storied, it
served a real need — getting
answers to puzzles and
frustrations, and making an effort
to create understanding on both
sides of a problem. Now, however,
someone has decided that the
column is cute or amusing, and so
you print stuff like that question
on the Egyptian chemist. Are you
making up questions like some of
the want ads? / don Y think you
need to — there are enough
unresolved questions on campus,
from students, staff and even
faculty, I don't doubt to keep the
column running for years. It
wouldn't hurt the Daily to run
something that adds to its
prestige, and we would certainly
appreciate a place where we can
get straight answers to our
questions—D.T.
First of all, the question about
the Egyptian chemist was not
made up. It was submitted and
answered in the spirit we felt it
deserved. However, I agree with
you about keeping amusing
material out of the Daily at all
costs. From now on every "Bug
Me" column will be read carefully
by a panel of sober reporters and
Ron Ziegler. Any remotely
humorous item will be censored,
immediately.

Now that new telephone books
are coming out, is there anywhere

that the old ones can be
recycled?—M.R.
Is there some place in this area
where one can recycle old
magazines ?—R .C.O.
There is no place in the Palo
Alto area to recycle paper,
according to Stan Shelly, the
environmental specialist for Palo
Alto. Occasionally elementary
school libraries take old
magazines.

Aside from presenting a hazard to
bicyclists, what function do the
posts on the Searsville bike path
serve? With the curb there, cars

certainly couldn't drive on it
anyway, and the posts do not
keep motorcycles off.—S.L.
Actually, cars do drive on the
bike path, according to master
planner Oscar Nelson, and that's
why the posts are there.
"We've seen lots of tire tracks
on the path," Nelson said. "We
already have tracks on the new
Mayfield path."
