# $12 Billion Lost To Third World
## Expropriation Hurts America 
### RICHARD FEARON 
American companies have lost
nearly $12 billion — a sum that
may escalate in the future —
through expropriation of their
assets by Third World countries,
reported Dennis Ray, professor
of political science at Cal
State-Los Angeles, to a conference
on multinational corporations.
Held Friday and Saturday, the
conference was sponsored by the
Stanford Journal of International
Studies. Eight papers, on many
different aspects of giant
corporations, were presented at
the two sessions.
Ray suggested that far from
being merely a "grab" of
American property, expropriation
may be a "necessary prerequisite"
for the transition to a more
modern economy in many
less-developed nations.
"The sequence of events
leading up to an expropriation

tend to parallel the events which
lead to war," stated Ray on the
basis of a three-year study of 98
cases of expropriation.
''In many res pects,
expropriation is a symbolic act of
war," he said, adding that "it is
also a collective action by the
oppressed against their
oppressors."
Spread To Third World
W h ile expropriation was
initially tried in the Soviet Union,
China, Eastern Europe, and Cuba,
"it has spread to most corners of
the Third World," Ray noted.
Host countries which place the
greatest restrictions on foreign
investment and make the largest
initial demands for control or
participation are the least likely to
expropriate, he said.
"Japan or Mexico may have a
rather poor foreign investment
climate ... | but] once entered,
such markets are relatively stable

because the rules of the game are
well established," said Ray.
Short-Lived Hospitality
"On the other hand. Third
World countries may welcome and
even actively solicit foreign
investment, but such hospitality
may be short-lived," he stated.
"American firms which are now
finding the Brazilian market so
attractive might well anticipate
future reversals."
Until the late 1960s many
expropriations wen' total
takeovers, but recently greater
emphasis has been placed on
participation formulas for control
by host countries, Ray stated.
Those situations involving
single companies are the most
susceptible to a complete
takeover, said Ray.
Single Companies
''Single company
expropriations have been total or
complete, irrespective of the type

ot government in power, he
noted. They simply reflect a
"complete breakdown in relations
between the company and the
host government."
In another paper presented at
the conference. R. Michael Allen,
a third-year Stanford law student,
and W. Kip Viscusi, an economics
doctoral candidate at Boston
University, reported that U.S.
multinational corporations have
lost $4.6 billion through
expropriation during the past 50
years.
They noted that the
inadequacies of legal remedies for
expropriation make insurance
against the loss a potential
billion-dollar business.
Lloyd's Of London
Lloyd's of London, a London
insurance firm, already varies
insurance rates according to the
risks believed present in different
situations, they stated.
While Lloyd's has a maximum
rate of 10 percent, they predicted
that even higher rates could open
extremely high-risk areas like
Chile or South Vietnam to
insurance coverage by
multinationals.
And while Lloyd's requires
multinationals to insure their
entire operation, thus spreading
the risk of any loss, less
comprehensive coverage might be
offered at higher rates, in order to
make insurance attractive to more
firms, they suggested.
In another paper, Assoc. Prof.
Jonathan F. Galloway of Lake
Forest College noted that
multinational corporations are
"ambivalent, often saying that
they are patriotic as well as seeing
the national state as an
old-fashioned idea."
He predicted continuation of
the present "untidy system" of
"oligopolistic pluralism," in which
140 countries, 300 supergiant
corporations, and 20 international
trade secretariats contend with
each other and with interested
international organizations.

co-author of the recently
published book Global Reach:
The Power of Multinational
Corporations was scheduled to
end the conference, but his

cancelled.

Single Companies
''Single company
expropriations have been total or
complete, irrespective of the type

ot government in power, he
noted. They simply reflect a

In another paper presented at
the conference. R. Michael Allen,
a third-year Stanford law student,
and W. Kip Viscusi, an economics
doctoral candidate at Boston
University, reported that U.S.
multinational corporations have
lost $4.6 billion through
expropriation during the past 50
years.
They noted that the
inadequacies of legal remedies for
expropriation make insurance
against the loss a potential
billion-dollar business.
Lloyd's Of London
Lloyd's of London, a London
insurance firm, already varies
insurance rates according to the
risks believed present in different
situations, they stated.
While Lloyd's has a maximum
rate of 10 percent, they predicted
that even higher rates could open
extremely high-risk areas like
Chile or South Vietnam to
insurance coverage by
multinationals.
And while Lloyd's requires
multinationals to insure their
entire operation, thus spreading
the risk of any loss, less
comprehensive coverage might be
offered at higher rates, in order to
make insurance attractive to more
firms, they suggested.
In another paper, Assoc. Prof.
Jonathan F. Galloway of Lake
Forest College noted that
multinational corporations are
"ambivalent, often saying that
they are patriotic as well as seeing
the national state as an
old-fashioned idea."
He predicted continuation of
the present "untidy system" of
"oligopolistic pluralism," in which
140 countries, 300 supergiant
corporations, and 20 international
trade secretariats contend with
each other and with interested
international organizations.

American companies have lost
nearly $12 billion — a sum that
may escalate in the future —
through expropriation of their
assets by Third World countries,
reported Dennis Ray, professor
of political science at Cal
State-Los Angeles, to a conference
on multinational corporations.
Held Friday and Saturday, the
conference was sponsored by the
Stanford Journal of International
Studies. Eight papers, on many
different aspects of giant
corporations, were presented at
the two sessions.
Ray suggested that far from
being merely a "grab" of
American property, expropriation
may be a "necessary prerequisite"
for the transition to a more
modern economy in many
less-developed nations.
"The sequence of events
leading up to an expropriation

tend to parallel the events which
lead to war," stated Ray on the
basis of a three-year study of 98
cases of expropriation.
''In many res pects,
expropriation is a symbolic act of
war," he said, adding that "it is
also a collective action by the
oppressed against their
oppressors."
Spread To Third World
W h ile expropriation was
initially tried in the Soviet Union,
China, Eastern Europe, and Cuba,
"it has spread to most corners of
the Third World," Ray noted.
Host countries which place the
greatest restrictions on foreign
investment and make the largest
initial demands for control or
participation are the least likely to
expropriate, he said.
"Japan or Mexico may have a
rather poor foreign investment
climate ... | but] once entered,
such markets are relatively stable

because the rules of the game are
well established," said Ray.
Short-Lived Hospitality
"On the other hand. Third
World countries may welcome and
even actively solicit foreign
investment, but such hospitality
may be short-lived," he stated.
"American firms which are now
finding the Brazilian market so
attractive might well anticipate
future reversals."
Until the late 1960s many
expropriations wen' total
takeovers, but recently greater
emphasis has been placed on
participation formulas for control
by host countries, Ray stated.
Those situations involving
single companies are the most
susceptible to a complete
takeover, said Ray.
