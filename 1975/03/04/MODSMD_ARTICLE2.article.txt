# Construction Noise Downgrades Living Conditions
## Flo Mo Students Voice Demands 
### RICHARD CHONG 
Florence Moore residents are demanding compensation
for the inconveniences created by the construction project
of 100 new rooms.
After a meeting last Thursday night, 14 Flo Mo
representatives demanded compensation in the form of
money, guaranteed housing for next year, or an option of
the two. They presented the demands to Karen Murray,
assistant to the dean of student affairs.
Murray had requested that the students collect a
"summation of the nature of the inconvenience that people
have suffered" in each house. She promised a response to
the demands by dead week.
Many Flo Mo residents claim that it is impossible to sleep
through construction noise that starts at 8 a.m. every
weekday morning. Alan Cummings, manager of student
housing, says the University has "done its absolute best to
eliminate the noise."
'Sporadic' Noise
Residents claimed the "sporadic" noise makes rooms
unusable during the day.
Cummings promised that major construction work will
be discontinued during dead week and finals week of winter
and spring quarters.
Residents also claim that fumes, which seem to pervade
through closed windows, have caused headaches for some.
Sandblasting, which started last week, covered many
rooms with open windows with a blanket of sand.
There were also several complaints about the dust in the
air from the construction work. It irritates those people
who wear contact lenses or suffer from allergies.
Mice And Rats Prevalent
Bikes now hamper and clutter the walkways; many
residents claim that they now have to carry their bikes
through other dorm lounges and hallways. Otherwise, the
bikes are left too close to the street, and too vulnerable to
thefts.
Mice and rats have become much more prevalent than
ever before. One resident reportedly heard rats next to her
head inside the heating system; another reported seeing a
rat run around on the floor of her room.
A physics section, scheduled last week in Flo Mo, was
reportedly forced to move simply because the noise was too
much to handle.

The temperature control problem has been accentuated
because of the construction. Mirlo residents reported that
their upper floor becomes too stuffy, while the lounge and
lower floors are too cold to use. Most of the lounges in Flo
Mo, because of poor ventilation, are reported to be
constantly cold, and therefore ineffective as a central
gathering place.
'General Disgust'
Janice Miyakawa, Mirlo's representative to the meeting,
said, "It [the construction] is reflecting on people's
attitudes toward each other, school and the administration
... there's a feeling of general disgust and frustration."
Loro's representative said "people are bored and sick of
the whole thing ... the head honcho is not taking us
seriously."
The compensation proposal written by Mirlo, which
unanimously passed at the meeting, states, "When the
University makes major capital improvements to residence
facilities while students are living there during the regular
academic year, it should compensate those students for the
material dimunition of the living experience."
Cummings said that should monetary compensation be
granted, it would come from only the room and board
funds of the housing system, and most likely would be in
the form of reduced rates for next quarter or in the form of
a rebate.
With regard to the guaranteed housing option, Cummings
said that that is entirely the housing office's responsibility,
not his.
Options
At present, there are three compensation options granted
to Flo Mo residents from the housing office.
First, if any resident decides to move off campus, they
would not lose his housing priority for next year's draw
into Flo Mo.
Secondly, in hardship cases, students may move to the
few spaces or guest rooms remaining in the housing system.
Thirdly, the University will give priority to individuals
moving at the beginning of the spring quarter for interdorm
transfer.
Many of the Flo Mo representatives refused these options
on the grounds that they would break up the unity of the
dorm built in after living together for two quarters.
