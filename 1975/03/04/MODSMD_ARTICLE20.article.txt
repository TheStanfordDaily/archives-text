# According To S.F. Psychologist
## Homosexuals Called 'Far From Sick' 
### 
Chicago (AP) — Homosexuals,
"far from being sick," often
function better than
heterosexuals, says a San
Francisco psychologist.
The psychologist, Dr. Mark
Freedman, adds, "I am not saying
that millions of gay people in this
country always function better
than heterosexuals."
But he reports in the March
issue of Psychology Today that a
number of studies of homosexual
men and women have shown that
many have what psychologists
regard as valuable personality
traits.
The American Psychiatric
Association in December 1973
removed homosexuality from its
list of mental disorders, and the
American Psychological
Association took similar action in
January.

Freedman cites the work of Dr.
Evelyn I locker, a psychologist at
the University of California, Los
Angeles, who in 1957 found that
homosexual and heterosexual men
rated the same in terms of normal
personalities.
And Freedman himself did his

doctoral research in 1967 on
female homosexuals — lesbians —
and found that they "are no more
neurotic or disturbed than
heterosexual women."
He reported finding that in
certain ways the lesbians actually
functioned better than a
comparable group of heterosexual
women.
Freedman, a staff psychologist at
the Northeast Community Mental
Health Center in San Francisco,
was a founder of the Association
of Gay Psychologists.
Social Pressures
Homosexuals, because of
intense social pressures against
them, begin very early to seek an
individual identity, purpose and
meaning, leading them to discover
and live according to their own
values, he said.
In his research, he reports, he
found that lesbians scored higher
than heterosexual women in
autonomy, spontaneity,
orientation toward the present
and sensitivity to their own needs
and feelings.
He cited studies by others
which showed lesbians to be more
independent, resilient, bohemian,

self-sufficient, goal-directed and
self-accepting.
Reaction To Separateness
Feelings of separateness,
Freedman said, have led some
homosexuals, as well as other
minorities, to oppose the values
and institutions of the dominant
society.
Among homosexuals this has
resulted in an increased sensitivity
to the value of the individual
person in our society, he said.
The psychologist said
homosexual women and men are
not bound by some socially
defined roles — that gentleness,
for example, is feminine and that

aggressiveness is masculine.
Many homosexuals therefore
have "a wider range of emotional
expression because they are not
confined by the standard roles,"
he said. The social stigma which
forces most homosexuals "to hide
behind a mask of heterosexuality
in order to survive" also may be
harmful, the psychologist said.
"Social pressures can narrow
and cripple a person," he said.
"I suspect, in fact, that many
homosexuals end up trying to fit
society's ugly image of 'the
homosexual' rather than pursuing
any of the positive roles and
patterns I've mentioned," he

and institutions of the dominant
society.
Among homosexuals this has
resulted in an increased sensitivity
to the value of the individual
person in our society, he said.
The psychologist said
homosexual women and men are
not bound by some socially
defined roles — that gentleness,
for example, is feminine and that

aggressiveness is masculine.
Many homosexuals therefore
have "a wider range of emotional
expression because they are not
confined by the standard roles,"
he said. The social stigma which
forces most homosexuals "to hide
behind a mask of heterosexuality
in order to survive" also may be
harmful, the psychologist said.
"Social pressures can narrow
and cripple a person," he said.
"I suspect, in fact, that many
homosexuals end up trying to fit
society's ugly image of 'the
homosexual' rather than pursuing
any of the positive roles and
patterns I've mentioned," he
Chicago (AP) — Homosexuals,
"far from being sick," often
function better than
heterosexuals, says a San
Francisco psychologist.
The psychologist, Dr. Mark
Freedman, adds, "I am not saying
that millions of gay people in this
country always function better
than heterosexuals."
But he reports in the March
issue of Psychology Today that a
number of studies of homosexual
men and women have shown that
many have what psychologists
regard as valuable personality
traits.
The American Psychiatric
Association in December 1973
removed homosexuality from its
list of mental disorders, and the
American Psychological
Association took similar action in
January.
Equal Personalities
Freedman cites the work of Dr.
Evelyn I locker, a psychologist at
the University of California, Los
Angeles, who in 1957 found that
homosexual and heterosexual men
rated the same in terms of normal
personalities.
And Freedman himself did his

doctoral research in 1967 on
female homosexuals — lesbians —
and found that they "are no more
neurotic or disturbed than
heterosexual women."
He reported finding that in
certain ways the lesbians actually
functioned better than a
comparable group of heterosexual
women.
Freedman, a staff psychologist at
the Northeast Community Mental
Health Center in San Francisco,
was a founder of the Association
of Gay Psychologists.
Social Pressures
Homosexuals, because of
intense social pressures against
them, begin very early to seek an
individual identity, purpose and
meaning, leading them to discover
and live according to their own
values, he said.
In his research, he reports, he
found that lesbians scored higher
than heterosexual women in
autonomy, spontaneity,
orientation toward the present
and sensitivity to their own needs
and feelings.
He cited studies by others
which showed lesbians to be more
independent, resilient, bohemian,

self-sufficient, goal-directed and
self-accepting.
Reaction To Separateness
Feelings of separateness,
Freedman said, have led some
homosexuals, as well as other
minorities, to oppose the values
and institutions of the dominant
society.
