## Stanford Symphony Starr Debuts 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
The Stanford Symphony
Orchestra's Sunday afternoon
concert of seldom-heard music
was a great success.
Their exciting and vigorous
performance of Dvorak's
Symphony No. 4 in D Minor,
Opus 13, highlighted the concert.
The piece demands a clarity and
precise musicianship that the
orchestra easily achieved and
maintained throughout the
performance. Intonation and
entrances were consistently
accurate.
Particularly good in the second
movement were the winds and
brass, whose opening solos
demand a careful finesse.
Also excellent was the
performance of Scriabin's Poem
of Ecstasy, Opus 54. This
modernistic-romantic composer is
now enjoying a renewed success
and appreciation by music
audiences.
The Poem is simple in form but
its single movement is vastly
orchestrated with complex
textures. It is a difficult,
challenging piece but the
orchestra played it very well. The
cello and violin solos were rich
and beautifully done, and the
clear, vibrant trumpet solo was
perfect.
The Orchestra did its best with
Liszt's Orpheus, Symphonic Poem

No. 4. It is not one of his better
compositions but the Orchestra
did it justice. The Lis/.t Poem's
flaw is a thick, muddled texture
that the Orchestra captured
faithfully. Again, the violin and
cello solos were excellent, but the
harps deserve the most praise.
Perhaps the least-known piece
was Cherubini's Overture to
Medea. The composer was a
contemporary to Beethoven, but
Cherubini's music unfortunately
does not exhibit the same genius.
Conductor Mark Starr, however,
put a lot of energy into the piece,
so that whatever it lacks musically
was interpreted into the piece
emotionally.
The Orchestra's playing was
mechanically precise and spirited,
putting as much into it as the
piece would allow.
Although the Stanford
Symphony and Mark Starr are
new to each other this year, the
results promise a future of many
more excellent concerts.
