# Movies: The Young Monster Isn't Very Funny
## 
### 
It is painful to be a misfit — ask
anyone. Ask your roommate, but
do it nicely. Dare to ask yourself,
for we are all slightly out of
alignment with our fellow
humans.
My particular discrepancy that
differentiates me from the rest of
you (among other things) is that I
don't like Mel Brooks movies. I'm
not apologizing, mind you — it's
my freedom of choice.
His latest opus, a satire of
horror movies, Young
Frankenstein, came to me highly
recommended. I was told to get
an aisle seat so I'd have room to
roll around, but there aren't
enough sidesplitting belly-laughs
in Young Frankenstein to put into
a thimble.
Some Guffaws
There are, admittedly, a lot of
chuckles and some guffaws, but
none of the jokes sent me into
paroxysms of laughter. There is an
irresistible impulse to compare
this to Blazing Saddles, so I will.
I didn't think Saddles was a
side-splitter, either. As I said, my
invulnerability to Brooks humor
seems to be a discrepancy,
something the factory didn't put
in right. And my warranty's

expired, so there's nothing I can
do about it.
Just as in the beginning of
Blazing Saddles, in which Brooks
recreated what looked for a few
minutes like a normal Western,
here he creates the stereotyped
horror movie — filmed in
black-and-white with the
foreboding castle on the hill in the
moonlight, the endless list of
credits, the eerie music in the
background.
Funny Credits
Even though it does look like a
normal horror movie, with Blazing
Saddles in the back of our mind,
we are simply waiting for
something absurd to happen.
Young Frankenstein is the first
movie I've seen where I started
laughing during the credits. It's
too bad the rest of the movie
wasn't as funny.
Gene Wilder plays the grandson
of the original Dr. Frankenstein,
fighting his destiny, which is to
create life from an inanimate
object. Madeline Kahn is his
girlfriend, Elizabeth, much
blander than her other creations
of Eunice Burns, Trixie Delight,
and Lily Von Schtupp, who at
least had charisma.

Dr. Frankenstein goes to
Transylvania to take possession of
his grandfather's castle, as is
requested by the old man's will.
There he stumbles upon the secret
of creation (in a book entitled,
How / Did It, by V.
Frankenstein), and goes on to
create the monster (Peter Boyle),
who in turn breaks loose and
terrorizes the town. The movie
ends with typical Brooks
absurdity, and happily for all.
Impressive Troupe
Brooks has collected an
impressive group of actors, all of
whom have worked together
before in one movie or another,
with the exception of Marty
Feldman (no one else could have
played the deformed Igor,
pronounced eye-gor, with the
possible exception of Robert
Redford) and Teri Garr as Dr.
Frankenstein's assistant (It's
pronounced fron-ken-steen, by
the way). Cloris Leachman
(unrecognizable as Frau Blucher)
and Kenneth Mars are very good
in their roles.
If I seem to hesitate, it's
because I don't think the actors
were taxed very much, but I did
enjoy them, at least. At best, it

was entertaining (how's that for
rationalizing my drawback?).
Using the original novel by
Mary Shelley, Brooks has
incorporated his own unique form
of humor (nothing else can quite
match it, thank God), instigating
some good gags — the horses hate
Frau Blucher so much they
whinny at the sound of her name
(you know, that doesn't sound
funny on paper); Marty Feldman's
transient hump, and his
"werewolf" — "there wolf" joke.
Blind Monk
By far the funniest scene is that
with Gene Hackman in a cameo
role as a blind monk feeding the
monster. If that level of hilarity
had sustained itself throughout
the entire movie, we might have
had quality on the level of The
Groove Tube.
Rib-Tickling?
Since most people found
Blazing Saddles rib-tickling and

thigh-slapping, it would be natural
to expect an equal if not better
masterpiece from such a man.
And nothing can live up to that
kind of expectation.
Young Frankenstein is pure Mel
Brooks, so if you are like me and
don't find him hilarious, don't see
it. It won't set the world on fire.
If you did like its predecessor,
you will probably like it, although
I think you might be
disappointed: the laughs I heard
in Blazing Saddles were generally
more frequent and of a longer
duration than those in Young
Frankenstein.
Disappointment may also come
in expecting the comedy to end
them all and getting only a mildly
funny satirical effort.

nevertheless, all over the place: at
the Fine Arts Theatre in Palo
Alto, for instance.)
