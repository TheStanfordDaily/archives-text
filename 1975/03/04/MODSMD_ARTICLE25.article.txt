# Dr. Hook Band Shines
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
If you thought
that Dr. Hook and the Medicine
Show was a band that had
become famous by acting
demented and singing songs
written by Shel Silverstein, you're
only half right.
At an appearance last
Wednesday night at Sophie's, the
band's resident crazies and
vocalists, Dennis and Ray, were at
their most demented, but
demonstrated talent that nearly
equalled the frenetic stage
presence and actions of the group.
In other words they gave a high
energy, accomplished musical
performance for those who were
over 21, could come up with the
$3 cover charge and wanted to
stay until the bitter end. Palo Alto
isn't known as a late night
entertainment mecca, but Dr.
Hook and company worked to
change that Wednesday, playing
two sets and performing until well
past 1 a.m.
Of course, the group performed
their only number one hit record.

"The Cover of Rolling Stone,"
and other well known numbers
like "Don't Give A Dose to the
One You Love Most," from the
public television special, VD
Blues.
Amazing Nostalgia
But they also proved to be an
amazing nostalgia band, putting
together a medley of 1950s hits
that would have shamed
Sha-Na-Na.
Sophie's smallish dance floor
was actually jammed when Dr.
Hook concluded the blast from
the past that included "Earth
Angel," "For Your Love,"
"Donna," and "What's Your
Name," right down to the last
shoo-be-do-wa.
The band also played
competent, if somewhat
scatological and over long blues;
Ray did a triple yodel right in the
middle of "Acupulco Goldie,"
and everyone took a few stabs at
some loud, heavy metal style
music, with the bass player doing
a Hendrix-like solo right in the
middle of "The Cover or Rolling
Stone," balancing on his
instrument amidst the usual
feedback whines and hisses.
No Hit And Miss
It sounds a lot more hit and
miss on paper than it was in
person. As weird and demented as
it seemed to see some really
scruffy long hairs playing every
style of music with wild abandon,
Dr. Hook's act was both
entertaining and musically
rewarding.
The only flaw in the evening
was caused by the unadvertised
opening band on the bill, the
Valley Boys from Berkeley, who
suffered from one of the ■ most
disgusting sound mixes it should
be anyone's misfortune to hear.

amazing nostalgia band, putting
together a medley of 1950s hits
that would have shamed
Sha-Na-Na.
Sophie's smallish dance floor
was actually jammed when Dr.
Hook concluded the blast from
the past that included "Earth
Angel," "For Your Love,"
"Donna," and "What's Your
Name," right down to the last
shoo-be-do-wa.
The band also played
competent, if somewhat
scatological and over long blues;
Ray did a triple yodel right in the
middle of "Acupulco Goldie,"
and everyone took a few stabs at
some loud, heavy metal style
music, with the bass player doing
a Hendrix-like solo right in the
middle of "The Cover or Rolling
Stone," balancing on his
instrument amidst the usual
feedback whines and hisses.
No Hit And Miss
It sounds a lot more hit and
miss on paper than it was in
person. As weird and demented as
it seemed to see some really
scruffy long hairs playing every
style of music with wild abandon,
Dr. Hook's act was both
entertaining and musically
rewarding.
The only flaw in the evening
was caused by the unadvertised
opening band on the bill, the
Valley Boys from Berkeley, who
suffered from one of the ■ most
disgusting sound mixes it should
be anyone's misfortune to hear.
If you thought
that Dr. Hook and the Medicine
Show was a band that had
become famous by acting
demented and singing songs
written by Shel Silverstein, you're
only half right.
At an appearance last
Wednesday night at Sophie's, the
band's resident crazies and
vocalists, Dennis and Ray, were at
their most demented, but
demonstrated talent that nearly
equalled the frenetic stage
presence and actions of the group.
In other words they gave a high
energy, accomplished musical
performance for those who were
over 21, could come up with the
$3 cover charge and wanted to
stay until the bitter end. Palo Alto
isn't known as a late night
entertainment mecca, but Dr.
Hook and company worked to
change that Wednesday, playing
two sets and performing until well
past 1 a.m.
Of course, the group performed
their only number one hit record.

"The Cover of Rolling Stone,"
and other well known numbers
like "Don't Give A Dose to the
One You Love Most," from the
public television special, VD
Blues.
