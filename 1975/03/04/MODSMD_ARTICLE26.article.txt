Ford Vetoes Anti-Oil Tarill Bill
WASHINGTON - When President Ford vetoes the bill
which would block his oil import tariff hikes for 90 days,
he will delay for 60 days his scheduled two monthly
$l-a-barrel boosts, White House sources indicated
yesterday.
Furthermore, these sources indicated, Ford will also
defer today for 60 days his equally controversial plan to
remove price controls on domestic crude oil April 1.
The goal of both delay actions would be to give Congress
time to produce an energy program.
Such steps toward some compromise would avoid an
energy-economic policy confrontation between the
Democratic-dominated Congress and the Republican-held
White House, these sources suggested.
The steps also would save political face for both sides
and strengthen the President's hand in the veto showdown
— especially in the Senate, where the outcome could be
close.
The sources indicated the White House remained
undecided yesterday on precisely how to make the
announcement, with options ranging from a prime-time
television appearance to a low-key release by spokesmen as
the message is sent to Congress.
The sources commented after top Ford administration
officials and Democrats who control the House Ways and
Means Committee began searching through their rival
proposals yesterday, seeking the elements of an energy
legislative compromise.
Oil Nations Summit Meeting
ALGIERS — Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed yesterday there is no
immediate need for a cutback in oil production to keep
prices high, informed sources said.
The possibility of curtailing oil production because of
the accumulating surplus had been a thorny issue
confronting the oil, finance and foreign ministers of the
13-nation OPEC cartel.
They are preparing for the first-ever OPEC summit
meeting, which opens today. Five heads of state do not
plan to attend for various reasons.
King Faisal of Saudi Arabia was not coming, which was
interpreted as his displeasure with OPEC's rigidity on
prices. Leaders of Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, and Iraq also
were staying away. Nigeria and Indonesia do not want a
confrontation with the West, Iraq has differences with Iran,
and Libya differs with less radical Arab states.
Conference sources said the ministers had decided that
the industrialized countries were revitalizing their
economies enough to consume the petroleum surplus that
has developed since January because of high prices and a
moderate winter.
The ministers have prepared a draft declaration outlining
OPEC's position on oil prices and long-term supplies. With
summit approval the proposals will be on the agenda of an
international conference some time this summer between
oil producing and consuming nations.
German Radieals Land In Middle East
BERLIN — A jetliner carrying five left-wing radicals
released in a bid to gain freedom for the kidnaped leader of
West Berlin Christian Democrats landed yesterday in Aden,
South Yemen, after being barred by several other countries.
German police said they had no word on the fate of
Peter Lorenz, his party's mayoral candidate in Sunday's
elections.
A government spokesman said West Germany has asked

South Yemen to grant the radicals refuge. It was unclear
whether the radicals — three women and two men —
wanted to remain in Aden on the southern part of the
Arabian peninsula or only stopped to refuel the plane.
The Lufthansa Boeing 707 jet carrying the radicals along
with 60-year-old Lutheran Pastor Heinrich Albertz and four
crewmen landed in Aden after it was refused permission to
stop in Syria, French Somaliland and Tripoli. When it
touched down in Aden, ending a zig-zag 10-hour flight from
Frankfurt, Germany, it had only two hours of fuel left.
Communists Shell Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Communist-led insurgents
fired Chinese-made rockets into two crowded sections of
Phnom Penh and its nearby airfield yesterday, killing at
least 19 persons and wounding about 20.
It was the heaviest toll of casualties in the Khmer
Rouge's two-month shelling campaign against the isolated
Cambodian capital. The city is cut off from the outside
world by road and river,* surviving on a U.S.-financed airlift
of ammunition, fuel and rice.
A single rocket struck outside the Monorom Hotel
shortly before dusk. Witnesses said 11 persons were killed
and more than a dozen wounded. Most of the casualties
were hotel employees, pedicab drivers and passers-by.
The hotel, which houses the news teams of two
American television networks, had most of its windows
blown in by the blast, the second time in the past week a
rocket round has struck near the building.
At midday, seven persons were killed and four wounded
when a rocket wrecked a fruit market, Another eight
rockets struck at Pochentong market adjacent to the
airfield outside Phnom Penh, killing one person and
wounding four.
None of the aircraft flying into Pochentorg with supplies
was hit by the rockets.
Conservatives Diseuss GOP Tieket
WASHINGTON — Conservative politicians and
businessmen banding together with the 1976 Republican
presidential ticket in mind will not automatically back
President Ford and are generally opposed to Nelson A.
Rockefeller, Sen. James L. Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.) said
yesterday.
Buckley said the 28 conservatives who met at a Maryland
resort over the weekend, as well as others, will be mustering
forces in order not to be left out of either the presidential
or congressional elections next time.
"This group wants to keep its options open," Buckley
told reporters.
"There was a feeling that it should be known that we're
going to watch the President with care over the next
months. We want to position ourselves so as not to be
caught with a fait accompli."
Buckley noted that the possibility of Ford picking
Rockefeller as No. 2 on the presidential ticket was a fait
accompli.
Buckley said that although Rockefeller's name only came
up peripherally during the meeting, the vibrations suggested
that the former New York governor would not be favored
for the vice presidency again.

German Radieals Land In Middle East
BERLIN — A jetliner carrying five left-wing radicals
released in a bid to gain freedom for the kidnaped leader of
West Berlin Christian Democrats landed yesterday in Aden,
South Yemen, after being barred by several other countries.
German police said they had no word on the fate of
Peter Lorenz, his party's mayoral candidate in Sunday's
elections.
A government spokesman said West Germany has asked

South Yemen to grant the radicals refuge. It was unclear
whether the radicals — three women and two men —
wanted to remain in Aden on the southern part of the
Arabian peninsula or only stopped to refuel the plane.
The Lufthansa Boeing 707 jet carrying the radicals along
with 60-year-old Lutheran Pastor Heinrich Albertz and four
crewmen landed in Aden after it was refused permission to
stop in Syria, French Somaliland and Tripoli. When it
touched down in Aden, ending a zig-zag 10-hour flight from
Frankfurt, Germany, it had only two hours of fuel left.
Communists Shell Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Communist-led insurgents
fired Chinese-made rockets into two crowded sections of
Phnom Penh and its nearby airfield yesterday, killing at
least 19 persons and wounding about 20.
It was the heaviest toll of casualties in the Khmer
Rouge's two-month shelling campaign against the isolated
Cambodian capital. The city is cut off from the outside
world by road and river,* surviving on a U.S.-financed airlift
of ammunition, fuel and rice.
A single rocket struck outside the Monorom Hotel
shortly before dusk. Witnesses said 11 persons were killed
and more than a dozen wounded. Most of the casualties
were hotel employees, pedicab drivers and passers-by.
The hotel, which houses the news teams of two
American television networks, had most of its windows
blown in by the blast, the second time in the past week a
rocket round has struck near the building.
At midday, seven persons were killed and four wounded
when a rocket wrecked a fruit market, Another eight
rockets struck at Pochentong market adjacent to the
airfield outside Phnom Penh, killing one person and
wounding four.
None of the aircraft flying into Pochentorg with supplies
was hit by the rockets.

WASHINGTON — Conservative politicians and
businessmen banding together with the 1976 Republican
presidential ticket in mind will not automatically back
President Ford and are generally opposed to Nelson A.
Rockefeller, Sen. James L. Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.) said
yesterday.
Buckley said the 28 conservatives who met at a Maryland
resort over the weekend, as well as others, will be mustering
forces in order not to be left out of either the presidential
or congressional elections next time.
"This group wants to keep its options open," Buckley
told reporters.
"There was a feeling that it should be known that we're
going to watch the President with care over the next
months. We want to position ourselves so as not to be
caught with a fait accompli."
Buckley noted that the possibility of Ford picking
Rockefeller as No. 2 on the presidential ticket was a fait
accompli.
Buckley said that although Rockefeller's name only came
up peripherally during the meeting, the vibrations suggested
that the former New York governor would not be favored
for the vice presidency again.

Ford Vetoes Anti-Oil Tarill Bill
WASHINGTON - When President Ford vetoes the bill
which would block his oil import tariff hikes for 90 days,
he will delay for 60 days his scheduled two monthly
$l-a-barrel boosts, White House sources indicated
yesterday.
Furthermore, these sources indicated, Ford will also
defer today for 60 days his equally controversial plan to
remove price controls on domestic crude oil April 1.
The goal of both delay actions would be to give Congress
time to produce an energy program.
Such steps toward some compromise would avoid an
energy-economic policy confrontation between the
Democratic-dominated Congress and the Republican-held
White House, these sources suggested.
The steps also would save political face for both sides
and strengthen the President's hand in the veto showdown
— especially in the Senate, where the outcome could be
close.
The sources indicated the White House remained
undecided yesterday on precisely how to make the
announcement, with options ranging from a prime-time
television appearance to a low-key release by spokesmen as
the message is sent to Congress.
The sources commented after top Ford administration
officials and Democrats who control the House Ways and
Means Committee began searching through their rival
proposals yesterday, seeking the elements of an energy
legislative compromise.
Oil Nations Summit Meeting
ALGIERS — Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed yesterday there is no
immediate need for a cutback in oil production to keep
prices high, informed sources said.
The possibility of curtailing oil production because of
the accumulating surplus had been a thorny issue
confronting the oil, finance and foreign ministers of the
13-nation OPEC cartel.
They are preparing for the first-ever OPEC summit
meeting, which opens today. Five heads of state do not
plan to attend for various reasons.
King Faisal of Saudi Arabia was not coming, which was
interpreted as his displeasure with OPEC's rigidity on
prices. Leaders of Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, and Iraq also
were staying away. Nigeria and Indonesia do not want a
confrontation with the West, Iraq has differences with Iran,
and Libya differs with less radical Arab states.
Conference sources said the ministers had decided that
the industrialized countries were revitalizing their
economies enough to consume the petroleum surplus that
has developed since January because of high prices and a
moderate winter.
The ministers have prepared a draft declaration outlining
OPEC's position on oil prices and long-term supplies. With
summit approval the proposals will be on the agenda of an
international conference some time this summer between

WASHINGTON — Conservative politicians and
businessmen banding together with the 1976 Republican
presidential ticket in mind will not automatically back
President Ford and are generally opposed to Nelson A.
Rockefeller, Sen. James L. Buckley (Cons.-N.Y.) said
yesterday.
Buckley said the 28 conservatives who met at a Maryland
resort over the weekend, as well as others, will be mustering
forces in order not to be left out of either the presidential
or congressional elections next time.
"This group wants to keep its options open," Buckley
told reporters.
"There was a feeling that it should be known that we're
going to watch the President with care over the next
months. We want to position ourselves so as not to be
caught with a fait accompli."
Buckley noted that the possibility of Ford picking
Rockefeller as No. 2 on the presidential ticket was a fait
accompli.
Buckley said that although Rockefeller's name only came
up peripherally during the meeting, the vibrations suggested
that the former New York governor would not be favored
for the vice presidency again.
Today's Weather
Fair, but with variable high clouds increasing today.
Chance of rain tonight and tomorrow. Lows both nights in
the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in upper 50s to mid
60s. Light wind becoming southerly 12 to 25 mph today.
Chance of rain 30 percent tonight.
Ford Vetoes Anti-Oil Tarill Bill
WASHINGTON - When President Ford vetoes the bill
which would block his oil import tariff hikes for 90 days,
he will delay for 60 days his scheduled two monthly
$l-a-barrel boosts, White House sources indicated
yesterday.
Furthermore, these sources indicated, Ford will also
defer today for 60 days his equally controversial plan to
remove price controls on domestic crude oil April 1.
The goal of both delay actions would be to give Congress
time to produce an energy program.
Such steps toward some compromise would avoid an
energy-economic policy confrontation between the
Democratic-dominated Congress and the Republican-held
White House, these sources suggested.
The steps also would save political face for both sides
and strengthen the President's hand in the veto showdown
— especially in the Senate, where the outcome could be
close.
The sources indicated the White House remained
undecided yesterday on precisely how to make the
announcement, with options ranging from a prime-time
television appearance to a low-key release by spokesmen as
the message is sent to Congress.
The sources commented after top Ford administration
officials and Democrats who control the House Ways and
Means Committee began searching through their rival
proposals yesterday, seeking the elements of an energy
legislative compromise.
Oil Nations Summit Meeting
ALGIERS — Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed yesterday there is no
immediate need for a cutback in oil production to keep
prices high, informed sources said.
The possibility of curtailing oil production because of
the accumulating surplus had been a thorny issue
confronting the oil, finance and foreign ministers of the
13-nation OPEC cartel.
They are preparing for the first-ever OPEC summit
meeting, which opens today. Five heads of state do not
plan to attend for various reasons.
King Faisal of Saudi Arabia was not coming, which was
interpreted as his displeasure with OPEC's rigidity on
prices. Leaders of Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria, and Iraq also
were staying away. Nigeria and Indonesia do not want a
confrontation with the West, Iraq has differences with Iran,
and Libya differs with less radical Arab states.
Conference sources said the ministers had decided that
the industrialized countries were revitalizing their
economies enough to consume the petroleum surplus that
has developed since January because of high prices and a
moderate winter.
The ministers have prepared a draft declaration outlining
OPEC's position on oil prices and long-term supplies. With
summit approval the proposals will be on the agenda of an
international conference some time this summer between
oil producing and consuming nations.
German Radieals Land In Middle East
BERLIN — A jetliner carrying five left-wing radicals
released in a bid to gain freedom for the kidnaped leader of
West Berlin Christian Democrats landed yesterday in Aden,
South Yemen, after being barred by several other countries.
German police said they had no word on the fate of
Peter Lorenz, his party's mayoral candidate in Sunday's
elections.
A government spokesman said West Germany has asked

South Yemen to grant the radicals refuge. It was unclear
whether the radicals — three women and two men —
wanted to remain in Aden on the southern part of the
Arabian peninsula or only stopped to refuel the plane.
The Lufthansa Boeing 707 jet carrying the radicals along
with 60-year-old Lutheran Pastor Heinrich Albertz and four
crewmen landed in Aden after it was refused permission to
stop in Syria, French Somaliland and Tripoli. When it
touched down in Aden, ending a zig-zag 10-hour flight from
Frankfurt, Germany, it had only two hours of fuel left.
Communists Shell Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Communist-led insurgents
fired Chinese-made rockets into two crowded sections of
Phnom Penh and its nearby airfield yesterday, killing at
least 19 persons and wounding about 20.
It was the heaviest toll of casualties in the Khmer
Rouge's two-month shelling campaign against the isolated
Cambodian capital. The city is cut off from the outside
world by road and river,* surviving on a U.S.-financed airlift
of ammunition, fuel and rice.
A single rocket struck outside the Monorom Hotel
shortly before dusk. Witnesses said 11 persons were killed
and more than a dozen wounded. Most of the casualties
were hotel employees, pedicab drivers and passers-by.
The hotel, which houses the news teams of two
American television networks, had most of its windows
blown in by the blast, the second time in the past week a
rocket round has struck near the building.
At midday, seven persons were killed and four wounded
when a rocket wrecked a fruit market, Another eight
rockets struck at Pochentong market adjacent to the
airfield outside Phnom Penh, killing one person and
wounding four.
None of the aircraft flying into Pochentorg with supplies
was hit by the rockets.
