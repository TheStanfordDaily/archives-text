# Grade Inflation Rampant
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Grade inflation is becoming more
prevalent at schools across the nation,
according to a recent Washington Post
article. So much so, that Dartmouth
and Amherst Colleges report 81 and
85 percent respectively of their grades
as As and Bs.
Although grade inflation has been a
source of controversy here, the study
did not mention Stanford.

A Daily study last January of grade
point averages (GPA) estimated that
the "average undergraduate here
compiled a 3.4 grade average last
year," with 41 percent of all grades As
and 31 percent Bs.
The study was based on a computer
survey taken by the Registrar's Office.
Quoting examples from several
other, well-known eastern schools, the
Post article said that "the old 'bell
curve' system of grading . . . has given
way to a new standard of
measurement ... [in which] C and
below has been relegated to a minor
role, and at some schools upwards of
70 percent of all grades are A or B."
More than 27 percent of all grades
given at Vassar College last year were
As and 54 percent were Bs, according
to the survey, which also stated that
60 percent of seniors at Bowdoin
College in Maine, graduate with
honors.
Dartmouth was the only Ivy League
school covered in the article.
Dickenson College in Pennsylvania
recently abolished the Dean's List,
stating that the 65 percent As and Bs
given there made a high GPA "no
longer an indicator of academic
excellence."
