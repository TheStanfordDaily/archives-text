# McCloskey Urges U.S. Arms Aid To Cambodia Through June 1

### MARK SIMONIAN 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R-Menlo Park) returned from a
week-long tour of Southeast Asia
yesterday and said he favored an
extension of U.S. military aid to
Cambodia through June 1.
McCloskey, who previously
opposed additional arms aid to
Cambodia, said he changed his mind
on the trip after seeing that neither the
government nor the guerillas were
taking prisoners in the bloody battle
around the capital city of Phnom
Penh.
He told the Daily from his
Washington office that the U.S. must
aid Lon Nol in maintaining the city's
perimeter until the start of the rainy
season so that over two million people
have the chance to escape the
Communist onslaught and possible
execution.
Once the monsoons begin, he
explained, the war stops and refugees
can safely infiltrate beyond
Communist lines to safety.
Ceiling Lift
McCloskey said he also supported
lifting the ceiling on U.S. food and
medical aid to the war-torn area.
McCloskey was one of an eight-man

Congressional delegation making the
fact-finding tour of Indochina.
In addition to recommending
increased aid to Cambodia, the group
will draft a report assessing the need
for additional aid to South Vietnam.
McCloskey declined to comment on
the group's report before its release.
He added, however, that he has not
changed his mind as an opponent to
U.S. military aid to Vietnam.
Met Huu Thai
During the tour, McCloskey said, he
also had a chance to meet with South
Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu
Thai. Thai, a former Vietnamese
political prisoner, was selected as an
ASSU guest professor for the 1974-75
academic year, but his emigration was
blocked by the South Vietnamese
government.
McCloskey said he had "hope" that
the government would allow Thai to
leave the country, but cautioned, "I'm
afraid he's the target for arrest and
torture by the police."
Last week, Vietnamese police
arrested 19 journalists, closed five of
the nine Saigon newspapers and
surrounded Thai's house, McCloskey
said. Thai has since gone underground,
he said.

During his meeting with Thai a
week ago Sunday, McCloskey said he
received copies of a letter drafted by
the ASSU and then-Acting Stanford
President William Miller.
Letters
McCloskey said he delivered these
letters, along with a personal letter
