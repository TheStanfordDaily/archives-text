# ZAP, Guthrie Chosen As New Theme Houses
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
The Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) subcommittee on
residences, amid disagreement by
house residents, voted unanimously
yesterday to locate the French theme
house and the Stanford-in-Stanford
program in ZAP and Guthrie houses.
The subcommittee's decision will
be submitted to COSS in the form of a
recommendation, stated
Subcommittee Co-chairman Bill
Rifkin.
Residents in ZAP and Guthrie
objected to the move announced
yesterday.
Originally, four Row houses —
Hurlburt, Guthrie, Storey and Jordan
— and two residences in the Cowell
Cluster — ZAP and Terra — had been
under consideration.
A 1 Tomaszczuk, co-chairman of the
COSS subcommittee, explained that
the decision was based on three
criteria: data from last year's draw; the
number of graduating seniors in each
residence; and "subjective data."
"Subjective data" consisted of
half-hour interviews held last Sunday
with residents of each of the six
houses under consideration, noted
Tomaszczuk.
'Get A Feel'
"We tried to get a feel for the
house. We asked the people why it was

a good house," he explained.
No decision was made concerning
which program would take which
house, said Tomaszczuk. Members of
the Stanford-in-Stanford and French
programs will confer later to decide,
he said.
"The consensus of the house is that
we are very unhappy about the
situation," stated Anna Rehbock, a
resident of Guthrie, one of four
all-female residences on campus. "It
limits our freedom of choice." Noted
another Guthrie resident, "Basically, I
think that the University is trying to
phase out women's housing."
The RAs and two or three residents
from each of the six houses being
considered were invited to a meeting
of the COSS subcommittee Sunday
night to present their cases as to "why
their house should not be chosen."
Many Guthrie women felt that the
decision to replace Guthrie had been
made before the Sunday meeting. "It
seemed like a cut and dried matter to
me," stated one of the residents. "I
wasn't a bit surprised at the action."
Defense
Horton defended the decision,
saying that "when it comes to Guthrie,
if every women in Stanford had
received her first choice, only
one-third of the house would be filled.
"We're certainly agreeable to add
new spaces if there is a demand for
all-women's housing," he said.
However, the residents of Guthrie
contend that those figures are very
misleading.
"These |women's houses] fill up
faster than the coed residences," said
Guthrie RA Angie Bonacquisti. She
observed that freshmen oftentimes are
steered away from all-female houses
by their dorm's RAs, and that those
who are placed in Guthrie, Roth and
Storey, overwhelmingly like them.
Stated Bonacquisti: "I think that in
general the decision will limit the
choice of women. The diversity in

women's housing is going to fade."
At ZAP, the decision met with
varying degrees of anger.
"The house took it stoically," said
HA Dan Brenner. He noted that since
15 of the residents of ZAP are seniors,
the verdict doesn't affect a great deal
of the house.
"1 do feel, though, that ZAP was an
extraordinary living environment that
will be missed on campus simply
because it fostered such a wide
diversity of students," he added.
However, ZAP resident Anne
Brainder said, "I'm really angered. I
really resent the University's actions."
Many said that, although ZAP has
no specific theme, it was a unified
residence, more so than many other on
campus.

all-women's housing," he said.
However, the residents of Guthrie
contend that those figures are very
misleading.
"These |women's houses] fill up
faster than the coed residences," said
Guthrie RA Angie Bonacquisti. She
observed that freshmen oftentimes are
steered away from all-female houses
by their dorm's RAs, and that those
who are placed in Guthrie, Roth and
Storey, overwhelmingly like them.
Stated Bonacquisti: "I think that in
general the decision will limit the
choice of women. The diversity in

women's housing is going to fade."
At ZAP, the decision met with
varying degrees of anger.
"The house took it stoically," said
HA Dan Brenner. He noted that since
15 of the residents of ZAP are seniors,
the verdict doesn't affect a great deal
of the house.
"1 do feel, though, that ZAP was an
extraordinary living environment that
will be missed on campus simply
because it fostered such a wide
diversity of students," he added.
However, ZAP resident Anne
Brainder said, "I'm really angered. I
really resent the University's actions."
Many said that, although ZAP has
no specific theme, it was a unified
residence, more so than many other on
campus.
The Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) subcommittee on
residences, amid disagreement by
house residents, voted unanimously
yesterday to locate the French theme
house and the Stanford-in-Stanford
program in ZAP and Guthrie houses.
The subcommittee's decision will
be submitted to COSS in the form of a
recommendation, stated
Subcommittee Co-chairman Bill
Rifkin.
Residents in ZAP and Guthrie
objected to the move announced
yesterday.
Originally, four Row houses —
Hurlburt, Guthrie, Storey and Jordan
— and two residences in the Cowell
Cluster — ZAP and Terra — had been
under consideration.
A 1 Tomaszczuk, co-chairman of the
COSS subcommittee, explained that
the decision was based on three
criteria: data from last year's draw; the
number of graduating seniors in each
residence; and "subjective data."
"Subjective data" consisted of
half-hour interviews held last Sunday
with residents of each of the six
houses under consideration, noted
Tomaszczuk.
'Get A Feel'
"We tried to get a feel for the
house. We asked the people why it was

a good house," he explained.
No decision was made concerning
which program would take which
house, said Tomaszczuk. Members of
the Stanford-in-Stanford and French
programs will confer later to decide,
he said.
"The consensus of the house is that
we are very unhappy about the
situation," stated Anna Rehbock, a
resident of Guthrie, one of four
all-female residences on campus. "It
limits our freedom of choice." Noted
another Guthrie resident, "Basically, I
think that the University is trying to
phase out women's housing."
The RAs and two or three residents
from each of the six houses being
considered were invited to a meeting
of the COSS subcommittee Sunday
night to present their cases as to "why
their house should not be chosen."
Many Guthrie women felt that the
decision to replace Guthrie had been
made before the Sunday meeting. "It
seemed like a cut and dried matter to
me," stated one of the residents. "I
wasn't a bit surprised at the action."
Defense
Horton defended the decision,
saying that "when it comes to Guthrie,
if every women in Stanford had
received her first choice, only
one-third of the house would be filled.
"We're certainly agreeable to add
new spaces if there is a demand for
all-women's housing," he said.
However, the residents of Guthrie
contend that those figures are very
misleading.
