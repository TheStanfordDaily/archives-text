# Shultz Calls For U.S. Negative Income Tax
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Former Treasury Secretary George
Shultz suggested last night that much
of the current federal welfare system
be junked and replaced by a "negative
income tax" plan.
Shultz, who also headed the
Department and Office of
Management and Budget during his s'/2
years under President Nixon, spoke to
about 325 people in Annenberg
Auditorium. His appearance was
sponsored by the Conservative
Students Union.
Shultz suggested that many of the
so-called "categorical" federal aid
programs for the poor, as well as food
stamps and federally subsidized
housing programs, be "cashed out —
and by cash out I mean that you end
these programs."
The money now allocated to these
programs, as well as that used to fuel
the bureaucracies that run them,
would then be applied to the negative
income tax (sometimes called "income
maintenance") program.
'Honors Individual Choice'
Under the proposal — which has
been championed by conservative
University of Chicago economist
Milton Friedman — aid to the poor
would be linked to the current
"positive" income tax system.
Under the plan, if the sum of a
taxpayer's exemptions and deductions
exceed his income, he or she is eligible
for payments from the government
totalling half the difference.
This money could then be spent by
the individual, without restriction as
to its use. Thus, Shultz argued, the
plan not only "honors the notion of
individual choice," but also "focuses
the money that is appropriated to the
poor, on the poor" — and not on
"college students piggybacking on
the poor" by using food stamps, or on
large bureaucracies needed to run the
program.
Shultz conceded that an income
maintenance program might be
"difficult to administer." But the aid
programs it would replace, he
contended, are already "wild to
administer."
Added Benefits
Shultz said the plan would have an
added benefit in that, unlike the
current federal welfare system, a
worker would not be "punished" for
earning money. He said that under
current programs, it's possible for

someone earning an additional $100
from work to lose more than $100 in
welfare benefits.
According to Shultz, who is now a
vice president of Bechtel Corp. as well
as a business professor here, a family
of four earning no income would, at
current levels, receive about $3250
under the plan.
The former cabinet official said he
would shy away from "cashing out"
the social security and federal
unemployment insurance programs
along with other federal aid programs,
because he thinks people have a
certain right to these plans, rather than
simply receiving their benefits out of
governmental largesse.
He conceded that his espousal of
the plan "may have damaged my
credentials" with some conservatives
suspicious of governmental hand-outs.

programs, as well as that used to fuel
the bureaucracies that run them,
would then be applied to the negative
income tax (sometimes called "income
maintenance") program.
'Honors Individual Choice'
Under the proposal — which has
been championed by conservative
University of Chicago economist
Milton Friedman — aid to the poor
would be linked to the current
"positive" income tax system.
Under the plan, if the sum of a
taxpayer's exemptions and deductions
exceed his income, he or she is eligible
for payments from the government
totalling half the difference.
This money could then be spent by
the individual, without restriction as
to its use. Thus, Shultz argued, the
plan not only "honors the notion of
individual choice," but also "focuses
the money that is appropriated to the
poor, on the poor" — and not on
"college students piggybacking on
the poor" by using food stamps, or on
large bureaucracies needed to run the
program.
Shultz conceded that an income
maintenance program might be
"difficult to administer." But the aid
programs it would replace, he
contended, are already "wild to
administer."
Added Benefits
Shultz said the plan would have an
added benefit in that, unlike the
current federal welfare system, a
worker would not be "punished" for
earning money. He said that under
current programs, it's possible for

someone earning an additional $100
from work to lose more than $100 in
welfare benefits.
According to Shultz, who is now a
vice president of Bechtel Corp. as well
as a business professor here, a family
of four earning no income would, at
current levels, receive about $3250
under the plan.
The former cabinet official said he
would shy away from "cashing out"
the social security and federal
unemployment insurance programs
along with other federal aid programs,
because he thinks people have a
certain right to these plans, rather than
simply receiving their benefits out of
governmental largesse.
He conceded that his espousal of
the plan "may have damaged my
credentials" with some conservatives
suspicious of governmental hand-outs.
Former Treasury Secretary George
Shultz suggested last night that much
of the current federal welfare system
be junked and replaced by a "negative
income tax" plan.
Shultz, who also headed the
Department and Office of
Management and Budget during his s'/2
years under President Nixon, spoke to
about 325 people in Annenberg
Auditorium. His appearance was
sponsored by the Conservative
Students Union.
Shultz suggested that many of the
so-called "categorical" federal aid
programs for the poor, as well as food
stamps and federally subsidized
housing programs, be "cashed out —
and by cash out I mean that you end
these programs."
The money now allocated to these
programs, as well as that used to fuel
the bureaucracies that run them,
would then be applied to the negative
income tax (sometimes called "income
maintenance") program.
