# Zealot May Have Stolen Gold Cross
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Police are now working on a theory
that the man who stole a $12,000 gold
cross from Memorial Church believes
he is on a religious mission, Stanford
Police Services Captain Raoul
Niemeyer said yesterday.
KZSU News reported that police
theorize the suspect may be following
the historic path of Father Junipero
Serra down the state, believing himself
to be a Franciscan father.
Niemeyer told the Daily last night
that the theory was "nothing
concrete." He added that several
people who have spotted the suspect
said the robe-clad nomad "reminded
them of a very sincere religious
student or a monk of some sort."
Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputies have put out a state-wide
all-points bulletin 011 the suspect and
have alerted local law enforcement
agencies along California Highway
101, Sheriffs Lt. Robert Bartoo said
last night.
The suspect was last seen
hitchhiking along 101 Thursday.
"He's acting rather strange," Bartoo
agreed, but Bartoo refused to
speculate whether the suspect had a
religious motive.
Niemeyer added that police believe
the suspect is not from the Stanford
area and is basically a transient.
He said police believe the suspect is
now heading south and they have
warned Santa Cruz and Monterey
police to especially be on the lookout.
"We're hoping someone spots him
along the coast," Niemeyer added.
Bartoo said his office plans to recall
all the eyewitnesses to put together a
better composite drawing for the
suspect.
"None of us think the theft is one
for purely monetary gain," Niemeyer
said. He explained that police believe
the suspect would not have gone to
the Sequoia High School woodshop
Thursday to have a wooden staff made
for the cross if he intended to sell it.
