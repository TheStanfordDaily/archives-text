## Opinions editorial Ration Gasoline 
### 
President Ford has proposed the institution of a tariff on
foreign oil imports so that consumption of foreign oil can be
reduced. We support the idea of lessening oil consumption,
but believe that Ford's program will be ineffective unless
combined with a system for gasoline rationing.
It is obvious that the United States must cut its
consumption of oil. The planet is rapidly running out of
petroleum reserves, and excess consumption by the United
States has been the one factor most responsible for this
unwelcome depletion.
We believe that Ford's program, which would raise the
price of gasoline to an estimated 65 cents per gallon, does
not go far enough in that it will unfairly hamper those with
lower incomes. A rationing system could further reduce
consumption without hurting those in lower income
brackets.
We propose that rationing coupons be given to each
person with a valid driver's license. Coupons could be legally
bought and sold, so persons in upper income brackets who
wished to buy more than their allotment of gasoline could
do so by buying coupons from licensed drivers without cars,
or those who use their cars only minimally. In this way,persons
who did not consume gasoline would be rewarded.
We further propose that this plan be combined with a gas
stamp rebate program similar to the current food stamp
program. Persons with low incomes could buy a specified
amount of gasoline for less than the pump price of at least
65 cents.
We also support the vote by the House of Representatives
to end the oil depletion allowance. Oil companies obviously
do not need this huge tax break in order to survive, and we
doubt that elimination of the depletion allowance will lessen
the search for new oil reserves.
