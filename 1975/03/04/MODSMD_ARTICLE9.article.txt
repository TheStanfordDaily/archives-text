# Inequality Here?
## 
### 
Me and some of my buddies are
kinda new here. We just
transferred in from colleges back
on the plains. We had all kinds of
troubles adjusting to this new
environment; we didn't have no
friends, didn't know where
anything was, didn't know how to
talk to any girls or nothin' like
that, just dumber 'n fence posts,
you might say. And golly did
everybody discriminate against
usâ€”musta had shit on our shoes.
So we went up to the money
office to see if they could give us
some 'aid' ya know, cuz man that
would ease the pain, especially if
one of us was 21.
They asked us first thing if we
was Asian-American or
Afro-American or
Chicano-American or anything
like that. I said, "No, just
Nebraskan but my friend here is
half Norwegian." The chick sorta
frowned and asked if my old man
had any money. I says, "Neither
one of us is too bad off; corn's
three bucks a bushel ya know."
They said we couldn't have no
money. I didn't pay it no real
heed cuz I figured everybody here
was up the same creek.
Then I got to thinkin' and went
back to that chick and asked what
those first questions was for. You

Farris, Karlgaard

know what this school is doin'?
Them first questions is the ones
that count. No fibbin'! If yer
some kinda 'minority' you get all
kinds of' 'aid' and stuff.
Now I don't know what others,
are fixin' to do 'bout it, but back
in Omaha when all this racism and
discrimination get outa hand, we
throw a couple of riots. Works
pretty good.
Here's the plan. I figure we
could ask to get priority put on
need alone. That's only fair, ain't
it? Maybe they could throw in a
little dough for people that gotta
adjust a lot, say, 'bout 7 cents a
mile or so; enough to throw a
good beer party and make some
friends.
And if ya'all don't like riotin',
there's a buncha laws say racial
discrimination ain't no good. I
don't think they expired yet. We
could take the schools to court.
Boy that'd be some shitkickin'
good times!
Hey ... Maybe they'd end up
hangin' our pictures up with
Martin Luther King's in libraries
and stuff. I always liked that guy.
He fought for equality for all
kinds of diverse peoples.
