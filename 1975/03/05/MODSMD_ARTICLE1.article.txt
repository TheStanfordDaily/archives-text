# Minority Aid Discussed
## 'Equity' Students See Lyman 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Ten members of Students for
Equity, a recently forr-ied group to
combat what it calls discrimination,
met yesterday afternoon with
President Richard Lyman and three
other high-ranking University officials
to discanr Stanford's commitment to
minority students.
T v •» discussion focused principally
on the Committee o> Undergraduate
Admissions and . Financial Aid
(C-UAFA) proposal, as amended by
the Faculty Senate, which greatly
increases the self-help requirement for
minority students.
The meeting was scheduled in
response to a demand by Students for
Equity for a discussion on the issue,
following a demonstration and march
to Lyman's office last week to protest
the new policy.
Director of Financial Aid Robert
Huff described the meeting as an
"exchange of points of view." He said
the students stated their opinions and

Lyman and the other administrators
responded. He noted that the
atmosphere was "good." It was one
"in which good discussion occurred,"
he stated.
Focused on Financial Aid
According to Loren Bloch of
Students for Equity, the discussion
was about minority commitment by
the University in general, but the focus
was on the financial aid policy change,
especially on its effects.
The group also discussed budget
priorities and the Ethnic Minority
Task Force, which had been
investigating minority financial aid, he
added.
Bloch said that the atmosphere was
not that of a "tea party" but "not
hostile either." He noted the obviously
different points of view, but added
that "both sides respected each others
views."
Self-Help Defined
The policy change, as amended and
approved by the Faculty Senate at its
last meeting, requires that blacks,
chicanos and Native Americans
provide approximately 80 percent of
the self-help expectation of
non-minority students. Self-help is
money provided either by a job during
the academic year or a long-term,
low-interest loan, as opposed to a
grant. Currently, no minority studnets
on financial aid are required to provide
any self-help during their freshman
year.
The policy change shifts most of the
basis for financial aid from an ethnic
criterion to an economic criterion, with
the 20 percent advantage for minority
students considered an inducement
similar to the reduced self-help
expectation currently extended to
other students the University wishes to
attract
Huff and CUAFA Chairman Paul

Green, a biology professor, said that
C-UAFA is working on its final
proposal. This plan will incorporate
the Faculty Senate amendments into
the original proposal, which did not
extend the financial aid inducement to
low-income minority students.
Figures Being Prepared
Green indicated that the committee
is preparing the new figures for average
aid to minorities in the low-income
group. He said he expects the Steering
Committee of the Senate to conclude
that the proposal now coincides with
the amendments the Senate approved
at its last meeting.
Lyman described the atmosphere at
yesterday's meeting as "not very
heated," though he said there were
disagreements between the two sides.
He said the "admissions office will
do everything it can to recruit
qualified minority students," but that
"if anyone exaggerates the change" it
will not help admissions.
Lyman Letter
In a letter sent to Ogletree last week
which was released Monday, Lyman
said that "on balance" he supported
the new financial aid policy, and that
he believed the C-UAFA "provided
adequate opportunity for comment."
The Ethnic Task Force, however, in
an earlier published report said that
further investigation is warranted in
order to fully assess the myriad of
ramifications such a change would
initiate."
Lyman's letter was written in
response to a letter from Ogletree on
behalf of Students for Equity.
Ogletree's letter requested the meeting
held yesterday, a written commitment
of the University's "affirmative action
practices toward minority students"
and that Asian Americans be treated
similar to the other minorities in

recruitment, admissions and financial
aid.
Commitment Not Diminished
Lyman's letter said that "Stanford's
commitment to the education of
minorities has in no way diminished
since 1968, and it will continue into
the future so long as it is within my
power to make it so."
On the question of including Asian
Americans with other minority groups,
Lyman noted that the Asians'"are
represented in the Stanford student
body out of proportion to their
numbers in the population."

He added that this must be
considered and"it must guide us in
the use of scarce resources."
Other administrators at the meeting
were Raymond Bacchetti, vice-provost
for budget and planning and Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for public
affairs.
The 10 student members are an "ad
hoc central committee" of the
recently formed Students for Equity,
according to Bloch. The group will be
meeting Friday to determine what
further steps to take in response to
yesterday's meeting. No further
meetings between the students and
administrators have been scheduled.
