# Make Tenure Process More Open
## 
### William Ross 
Much of the current controversy regarding
tenure would evaporate if the groups that
make tenure decisions — at every level of the
University — would issue statements
outlining the criteria on which they base
tenure decisions.
While the tenure decision process is — and
should remain— highly private, it is
unnecessary for administrators to cloak it in
such secrecy. No standards are currently
published and professors such as Ronald
Mellor of the Classics Department have been
dismissed with two-sentence explanations of
their cases.
Although University officials have
probably refused to issue general guidelines
on tenure in order to avoid controversy, their
strategy has backfired. The vagueness of the
tfnure process has continually left it at least
partially vulnerable to charges that various
types of prejudice unfairly influence
decisions.
Vague Criteria
This problem was typified by the
complaints of Juan Flores, a professor of
German who was denied tenure last spring by
the Appointments and Promotions (A&P)
Committee after his department voted
unanimously to "grant him tenure.
Claiming that the A&P Committee wanted
him to leave the University because it
objected to his Marxist views, Flores pointed
out that his one book, Poetry In East
Germany, acclaimed by many scholars as a
pioneering study, was enough to warrant him
tenure.
Flores, noting that the Committee
complained that he hadn't published enough,
asked what kind of a trade-off existed
between quality and quantity. I don't believe
that he ever received an answer.
This week, Cedric X, a professor of
psychology and communication, has charged
that bias against black Muslims and ignorance
of his admittedly unorthodox work has cost
him tenure.

X's tenuous claims of religious and
political prejudice can be disposed of in short
order. No one pretends that X has
proselytized students and even his opponents
deny that he has used the classroom as a
forum to present his view that the western
world is excessively materialistic and corrupt.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that the
University, with its penchant for giving
ethnic balance to departments, would deprive
itself of the chance to have a black Muslim
on its faculty. In a Daily interview, X told me

that in grading students, he almost bends
over backwards to give white students good
grades in order to escape charges of
prejudice. No doubt the University similarly
did everything it could to retain X.
Legitimate Questions
But X is right to wonder how the
University arrived at its decision on his case.
Psychology Department officials told me that
they interviewed a large number of students
about X, although their opinions did not
count heavily.
Are students usually interviewed? If so, are
their opinions taken pro forma or can they
make a real difference? Are their opinions
relied on more heavily in certain types of
cases than in others? The University ought to
answer these questions.
In its letter to X, the department
explained that although X had published
many articles, not all of them were in the

most distinguished publications of his
profession.
Departments should list which journals are
the most acceptable and explain the process
for judging the quality of articles appearing
in those journals that fail to receive official
blessings.
Since X objected to the timing of the
decision, department officials might also try
to establish a uniform time limit on all
decisions.
Since the Psychology Department
attempted to solicit the opinions of black
scholars who could interpret some of X's
unorthodox theories, the University might
also explain how it decides which outside
persons to consult on tenure decisions.
Clarification Needed
Departments and schools might also try
explaining what sort of research they prefer
professors to do. For example, many
Graduate School of Business professors and
students are currently disturbed because
Asst. Prof. Keith Lumsden — generally
regarded as an excellent teacher — was denied
tenure even though he has written several
books and dozens of articles. But Lumsden
has concentrated his efforts on textbooks,
which are not highly regarded by the
Business School.
Finally, the people who decide on tenure
cases ought to consider making letters of
recommendation open to the people
whose cases are being decided upon. As one
professor who had been denied tenure told
me last month, "It's hard to challenge a
decision when you are kept in the dark
during the entire process."
If the schools and departments of this
University base tenure decisions as firmly on
academic rather than political criteria as they
claim to do, then they would have nothing to
hide if the process were made more open.
