# Capitalist Opinions Obsolete

Tim Ferguson's column "A Call
to Escape from America" (Daily,
Feb. 27) was very disturbing to
me. Since I arrived at Stanford
last September, I've been shocked
and dismayed at the number of
students who go in for Ayn Rand,
that trashiest of all best-seller
philosophers. Hers is an abstract
philosophy indeed, lacking any
historical understanding or
economic backbone. She is an
odious novelist and a theoretical
quack.
Yet in the tradition of the
"objectivists" and the libertarians,
Ferguson seems rather righteous
about these wealthy capitalists
going off on their own, with only
the noblest intentions, to run the
world from a tiny island in the
Bahamas, where supposedly they
can enjoy the true freedom of
capitalism — making money
without restriction.
Mike Oliver states that he seeks
to "separate economy and state
by law." This is clearly gibberish.
Law is based on economy, in the
broadest sense, and law is never so
important as those who enforce it.
Or would there be any
enforcement in Oliver's world?
A word to Ferguson, the
libertarians, and other Ayn Rand
freaks across campus who are
under the burden of irresponsible
mythology — money doesn't grow
on trees.
The right to make money is not
at all similar to the right to pick
peaches off a tree. This is "Lesson
One" of any sensible economics.
Money isn't an abstract notion.
Money, in capitalist society, is
people, territory, machinery: real
human lives.
For hundreds of years, billions
of people have been bought,
traded and invested by capitalists.
If anyone can successfully create a
"new country" on earth it will be
working people freeing themselves
from the capitalists' "right to
make money."
Socialist revolution is not too
far in the future. Are the
libertarians misguided enough to
act in their rulers' — the
capitalists' — interests to stop
such a revolution?
