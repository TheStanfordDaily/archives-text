More On Quakes
Editor:
Concerning the article on
earthquakes (Daily, Feb. 25), I
have no urge to stay here and test
the theory that Meyer Library and
the Earth Sciences Building would
stay relatively intact if an
earthquake struck.
I believe that I would take the
advice of the candid geologist to
"get the hell out," particularly if I
were in the vicinity of the Meyer
Library skylight.

Striving For Excellence
Editor:
Dean of Humanities aqd
Sciences Halsey Royden and Daily
columnist William Ross gave some
solid reasons why it will be more
difficult to achieve tenure rank at

Stanford (Daily, Feb. 25) to
which I would add this:
Stanford is clearly an
exceptional school with an
inescapable mission to act as
bellwether to higher education
generally. Since the scienccs have
always been stronger here than
the humanities, we have to be
particularly careful to raise
standards in the latter realm if we
are to attain the balance required
for the true excellence that will
put us on a par with the best. It
would be a pity and indeed
unthinkable to come so very close
to distinction and not attain it.
Although superior teaching is
obviously important here, it is
difficult to see how (except in
rare cases such as that of Jerry
Irish) it can be deemed the
primary consideration. The kind
of intensely focused energy and

talent it takes to break new
ground, in the realm of
knowledge, to create, is simply
incommensurable with the
steadier kind of talent required
for even the finest teaching.
It is not a question of absolute
judgment of human types: in the
overall view of things, one hare or
tortoise may be as praiseworthy as
the other. But our overriding
concern is the cultivation of rare
gifts which are extremely valuable
to the development and even, as
C.P. Snow insists, the survival of
our society. These gifts can be
fostered in only a very few places,
of which Stanford is surely one.
This kind of necessity can be
easily demonstrated in kindred
domains of achievement such as
the arts or sports, but the hard
facts of life are well recognized
and accepted in these areas. Our
scholars are usually not extremely
well noted, but the clear case
anyway is that they are on the
whole pretty remarkable each in
his field, ranking near the top as
any instrumentalist in our major
ensembles must do.
These standards will
increasingly prevail out of simple
stringency of which finances are a
part: the scrutiny becomes more
narrow-eyed as the money runs
low. And that freedom, prestige,
security, gentility and comfort
surely go with some extraordinary
contribution. Not all now make it
and not all in the same way. But
we are talking about the future
and the main route which
Stanford must travel for its
fulfillment.

Cheap Shot At Hockey
Editor:
I feel that Dan Pyne's Pro
Prognosis column (Daily, Feb. 28)
on violence in professional hockey
represents a "cheap shot" at what
has become a very serious
problem in this sport.
First, he has ignored the fact
that after the Forbes-Boucha
incident, the NHL Players'
Association proposed that "any
player penalized for deliberate
injury or deliberate attempt to
injure be automatically suspended
pending a hearing."
Does this proposal sound like

the type of reform that would
come from "scarred ex-convicts
with glazed eyes"? It seems more
like an intelligent attempt by the
players themselves to do
something about the growing
violence on the ice.
Second, Pyne seems to forget
that Clarence Campbell has been
trying to prevent more fights by
eliminating the situations that can
ignite these brawls. Last year, he
ruled that penalized players must
automatically proceed to the
penalty box and that players
cannot wear any tape on their
hands (a necessary aid to most
fighters).
In addition, he has decided that
the next game misconduct that
Dave Shultz receives will result in
a two-game suspension. The next
time it occurs, the Philadelphia
Flyer forward will miss three

games. Do these decisions also
sound like the "NHL's persistent
refusal to clean up the league"?
Finally, I was dismayed that
Pyne did not suggest any concrete
plan of reform. As he points out,
there remains a fine line between
agression and agressiveness. But
there also exists a fine line
between constructive criticism
and just plain criticism that will
do nothing to solve the problem.
Of course, more reform will be
necessary. Yet, at least the
players' and Campbell's
actions are steps in the right
direction to hopefully ending
hockey violence. Moreover, for all
Pyne's ranting and raving, they
seem to be already two steps
ahead of him on that road to
reform.
