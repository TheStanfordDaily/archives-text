## Mayor Alioto: Ebullient As Ever Personalities Plus 
### Steve Hefter 
SAN FRANCISCO—Joe Alioto's
mayoral career has been a tur
bulent odyssey through personal
and political troubles.
In September 1969 a Look
magazine article accused him of
consorting with known Mafiosi.
Four months later, the state of
Washington filed a civil suit
against him in an attempt to
recover $2.3 million in legal fees.
To top that off, in March 1971
the federal government indicted
him on charges of bribery.
Of all these accusations, Alioto
has now been cleared. But last
Wednesday there was another
bombshell.
To the mayor's complete
surprise, his wife Angelina filed
for dissolution of their marriage
of 33 years. She cited
"irreconcilable differences" — the
legal grounds for divorce in
California.
For the mayor, the divorce
action left him with only strong
hopes for a quics reconciliation.
But as in the past, despite
personal problems, San
Francisco's mayor continues at his
job with each and every stitch of
his well-known ebullience.
Divorce Is Unfortunate
Sitting behind his huge
mahogany desk in the
distinguished mayoral offices on
the second floor of City Hall, the
mayor calmly and graciously
arg'.ies his case.
"It |the divorce action] doesn't
tax me any differently as mayor
than it would a practicing
lawyer," he says. "These things
are unfortunate, but in private
relationships these things arise.
"I've taken the view that unless
somebody can demonstrate a

public implication or public
impact, private relations are really
not for public discussion."
No Senate Plans
As for the political
consequences of an impending
divorce, only time will tell.
By law, Alioto is prohibited
from running for a third term, and
at 59 his political future is
anybody's guess. And although he
does not think a divorce would
affect any future plans, all he says
about those plans is "who
knows?"
He then continues, "Things can
happen to you very suddenly and
unexpectedly. They did yesterday
[his wife's action]" he says with a

smile.
Even though he does not say
what he will do, Alioto does rule
out what he won't.
"I'm not interested in running
for Senate as some people talk
about," he says."I just don't like
the legislative life."
Picture of Confidence
As he sits back in his majestic
green mayoral throne, the mayor
is a picture of confidence. He is a
proud mayor, but not the "boss"
of a political machine like is
found in Chicago or Philadelphia.
But even without it he has held
San Francisco together during
seven rough years of social and
political unrest.
On his years as mayor he says,
"Nobody's going to judge me
except the passage of time. I'm
not going to judge myself.
"But," he adds, "I think that
they're going to say that San
Francisco weathered the urban
crisis better than any other major
American city."
Public Schools In Trouble
Alioto cites improvements in
race relations, economic
developments in housing and
equal opportunity in civil
employment as some of the
reasons for San Francisco's
success.
But there have always been
trouble spots and there still are.
Today, San Francisco's public
schools face one of the gravest
crises in the history of American
education.
With costs that are rising more
rapidly than the budget, the San
Francisco School Board has been
forced to recommend the
elimination of music, drama,
forensics and sports programs at
city schools.
In addition, the San Francisco
port finds itself in financial
trouble as the major shipping lines
have flocked to Oakland.
Education To The Mayor
To these issues Alioto exhibits
strong concern and offers both
explanations and suggestions.
"I haven't said this publicly
yet," he explains, "but 1 honestly
think that we'd do better with
education if we'd turn it over to
the mayor and the Board of
Supervisors ... in the same way
that police, recreation and public
utilities are.
"The primary business of
public education," he adds, "is to
teach people to be literate. We're
goin* to have to get down to the
serious business of adequately
funding public education in
California.
"It may mean an infusion of
$300 million from the state. But
it can be done."
Port Crisis Not Necessary
As for the port, the mayor
blames those who rejected the
proposal to build a U.S. Steel
building.
"The port of San Francisco

faces deterioration because
economic promises of buildings in
the downtown portion never were
realized," he says.
"If that U.S. Steel building were
built in Ferry-Port plaza ... a low
rise development, it would have
been returning with taxes and
everything else maybe $4 to $5
million a year.
"That would stabilize the
situation and you wouldn't have
the financial crisis.
"What you have instead are just
slum piers. Those who were
responsible for wrecking this thing
must bear the responsibility of the
port."
Stanford Egg Heads
Along with the mayor in the
large mayoral office ensconced
with the American and San
Francisco flags, are two Alioto
aides and former Stanford

students, Press Secretary William
E. O'Brien, and Deputy Mayor
John DeLuca.
One of his own sons a Stanford
graduate, the mayor quips, "We're
not anti-intellectuals around here.
We're actually a bunch of egg
heads."
For Stanford, the mayor has
high praise and notes than many
members of his staff are Stanford
people. He mentions San
Francisco Board of Supervisors
President Dianne Feinstein, and
on her mayoral candidacy says,
"She is a responsible and viable
candidate."
But he doesn't agree with the
statement she made at Stanford
last week — that Alioto
should spend more time on the
grubby day-to-day details of
running the city than on the more
glamorous public relations end.

Alioto responds, "That
statement is false. I'm involved
with city issues both locally and
nationally.
"There are but few of the
grimy details which I don't know
about intimately. I do a lot of
reading and cross-examining
around here."
Half in jest he adds, "She
presented her credentials for this
office and ran third and I told her,
'I don't mind your running against
me. But not to beat Harold
is terrible—terrible!"
No Favorites Foi 75
Of all those wishing to succeed
him, Alioto has no favorite. He
strongly emphasizes, "I do not
intend to take uides in the
mayoral race until at least late
next summer."
And although he has not
endorsed any of the announced or
unannounced Democratic
presidential hopefuls, he feels that
only three, Humphrey, Jackson
and Kennedy have any chance at
the nomination.
And of the three he adds, "I
frankly confess that when you're
dealing with economic problems I
don't think anybody has the
combination of experience and
ability that is possessed by Hubert
Humphrey.
"But Humphrey carries an
albatross around his neck called
Vietnam. He shouldn't but he
does ....
"He has more boundless energy
than the others. And,"he adds,
"energy and stamina are major
attributes in the office of the
President or in any office."
Humphrey In 68
Alioto's admiration for
Humphrey goes back to the 1968
Democratic National Convention
in Chicago, where the rookie
mayor gave the nominating speech
for then-presidential candidate
Humphrey.
At the time, Alioto was among
those considered for selection as
Humphrey's running mate, and
almost everyone considered him a
likely choice for the 1970
California Democratic
gubernatorial nomination.
But then came the Look
magazine story which Alioto
fought in the courts and finally
won. It may have cost him the
nomination, and it is paradoxical
that the print media, which he has
always admired and even worked
on, may have struck him a bad
and perhaps unjust blow.
High School Editor
In high school he was editor of
the school paper, as well as
president of the student body,
and a member of the basketball
and debating teams.
Then at St. Mary's College in
California he was editor of the
yearbook while majoring in

DAY AFTER DIVORCE FILED—In his mayoral offices on the
second floor of City Hall, Alioto discusses his years as mayor and the
days that lie before him. Within those days may be more of his usual
court appearances, as last week his wife Angelina filed for dissolution
of their marriage of 33 years.
