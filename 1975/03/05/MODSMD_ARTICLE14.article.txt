philosophy and English. He was
also valedictorian and graduated
magna cum laude.
On the press, Aiioto says, "I've
always enjoyed meeting with
journalists because it's a two way
street with them.
"You can learr. a lot about
what's going on in the world by
being interviewed by journalists —
because they ask the questions
which are on the minds of the
people.
"I've always taken the view
that I'll meet with the press on
any subject, any time, any place."
Thought He Was Paranoid
Although the Look story may
have cost him the gubernatorial
nomination, the federal
indictments were the ones
brought down against him during
his re-election campaign in 1971.
But despite the allegations he
won the election and continually
charged that the attacks leveled
against him were politically
motivated because he was
becoming a threat to the
Republican hold on the
statehouse.
At the time, his charges against
people like then-Attorney General
John Mitchell were registered by
the San Francisco Chronicle and
others as paranoia.
Republicans Responsible
But as the mayor explains
today, in light of Watergate, his
charges are a lot more real.
"Sam Ervin was here the other
day,"the mayor says smoothly
with his mind clicking away at
100 m.p.h., "and he said
publicly, 'The mayor of San
Francisco was the first man that
brought the hard evidence that
enforcement agencies of the
United States were acting outside
their constitutional rights.'
Nixon Was Always Dirty
"For I had it documented back
then that Mitchell, Ehrlichman
and Krogh were the people
responsible. Now," he adds
triumphantly, "they're all under
indictments themselves."

As for Richard Nixon, Alioto
professes a strong dislike, and the
anger in his voice lets you know
it.
"Richard Nixon never carried
on a clean campaign any time in
his lifetime. So there's no reason
why he should start in the
presidency.
"It was a dirty campaign
against Voorhis [1946 California
congressional race] and a dirty
campaign against Helen G.
Douglas (1950 Senatorial race].
Watergate v:as just the grand
culmination of the whole trail of
crooked campaigns."
S.F. And Salzburg
The mayor's words trail off and
he would just as soon forget about
Richard Nixon and return to his
usual calm and controlled manner.
He is the mayor of one of
America's great cities. And for Joe
Alioto, San Francisco is truly a
great city.
"You know,"he says,"the
Chancellor of Austria once told
me, 'the two greatest political
positions in the whole world are
to be mayor of San Francisco or
mayor of Salzburg!' "
The mayor continues, "San
Francisco is a very exciting city. A
city with a fine and dramatic
quality of life. None other would
be as exciting for me to be mayor
of."
Violinist And Lecturer
So in his last year as mayor of
San Francisco Joe Alioto goes
about his business. In his spare
time he likes to travel and
occasionally lectures at campuses
like Harvard and Yale about
American poets and writers.
A respected literary critic,
Alioto is also a violinist who still
practices regularly.
He is a busy man with a city to
run and a future to plan. It's no
easy job and he has many troubles
ahead in addition to the troubles
behind.
But at 59 he is still going
strong. He remains the Joe Alioto
he's always been. Ebullient as
ever.

LAST STAND AT STANFORD-Mayor Alioto's last appearance at
Stanford was April 19, 1974 during his campaign for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination. Alioto lost in that bid and today his
political future is still in question as he finishes out his last year as
mayor.
