# Computers Add New Dimension To Music
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Take a sound, any sound.
Multiply it a dozen or more times
to create a choral effect. Make the
sound "fly" around the room in a
dozen different directions and in
as many speeds.
A computer at the Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Center has
been programmed to do these
things and more as part of a
computer music project being
worked on by five University
musicians (all either play an
instrument or compose music).
The researchers are John M.
Chowning, former assistant
professor of music here, now
composer in residence for Berlin,
Germany; Music Prof. Leland
Smith; Loren Rush, a composer
who received his doctor of music
arts degree here in 1969; Andy
Moorer, a computer science
doctoral candidate; and John M.
Grey, a psychology doctoral
candidate.
Althougii the computer can
reproduce exactly the sounds of
real instruments, its greatest
potential lies in creating new
sounds, according to Moorer and
Grey.
Creating new sounds from old
cnes has been "a musical tradition
ever since the tape recorder,"
observed Grey.
Spatial Choreography
One of the new sounds involves
what Morer and Grey call
"spatial choreography" â€” creating
the illusion of moving sounds. In
a sample recording, the listener
can almost "see" a sound whiz
across the room. A more elaborate
recording sends 13 gongs of
varying pitches whirling around
the listener's head.
In another piece, a single note
sung by a soprano is multiplied to
produce a choral effect, flung
around the room like angels'
voices and finally blended with
notes from a trombone.
"We haven't gone as far with
the voice as we'd like to," Moorer

commented.
Moorer and Grey emphasized
that the computer will not take
over the roles of performers or
composers. The computer is
"more of an extension that will
aid both performers and
composers," Grey said.
Computer Composers?
Other computer music projects
have concerned programming
computers to compose music. But
Grey added that "we have no
feeling that the computer will be
capable of composing."
Computer music is "a reflection
of whoever the composer is,"
Moorer remarked.
The composer chooses both the
sounds and the instruments of his
orchestra by typing the
appropriate information into the
computer. The computer then
becomes "a medium for the
expression of the composer's ideas
in sound," said Grey.
Fears that computer music will
be "highly academic" are "clearly

silly," Moorer stated. He pointed
out that another electronic
instrument, the synthesizer, is
being used by many pop rock
groups and that the Grateful Dead
already use a computer onstage.
'Laboratory Thing'
Computer music may be a
"laboratory thing" now but in
five to 10 years, Moorer
predicted, it will be a suitcase-size
"performing stage popular
instrument." The computer as a
musical instrument could
eventually "find its way into
everyone's home," Grey added.
Outside of music, the computer
can be used in sound analyzing
experiments, psycho-acoustic
experiments, and electrical
engineering experiments, said
Moorer and Grey.
On a "very, very far out and
tentative level," Grey said, sleep
researcher Prof. William Dement
may use the computer to produce
sounds that might help people go
to sleep (the sound of the sea, for

example).
The group tries to keep in
touch with some of the other
major computer music project
sites. These include Bell
Laboratories, Colgate University,
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT), the University
of Illinois, and Michigan State
University.
International Center
The researchers are trying to
raise funds to establish a
$600,000 international computer
music center here. According to
Moorer, the group must raise
$120,000 in outside donations in
order to receive an equal grant
from the National Endowment for
the Arts (NEA). The National
Science Foundation will supply
the remainder once the NEA
matches the $120,000.
The University approves the
project, but provides no financial
support, Moorer said. The General
Secretary's Office is helping the
group look for outside donors,
