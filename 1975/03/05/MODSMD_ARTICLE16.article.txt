Moorer added.
Popular rock groups don't have
enough money to provide any
funding, but bands like the
Grateful Dead do have a
"tremendous interest" in the
activities of the computer music
project, noted Moorer.
"They are eager to reap the
fruits of our research," he said.
Establishing a separate system
for the computer music project is
important, according to Grey and
Moorer, because it is a heavy
burden on an already overworked
system. The computer music
project shares a system with 110
others at the Artificial Intelligence
Center.
If a computer music center is
established here, it will probably
work closely with an institute for
research in music and acoustics
scheduled to be set up in Paris in
1976.
The researchers are also
planning to give some public
concerts this spring.

Moorer added.
Popular rock groups don't have
enough money to provide any
funding, but bands like the
Grateful Dead do have a
"tremendous interest" in the
activities of the computer music
project, noted Moorer.
"They are eager to reap the
fruits of our research," he said.
Establishing a separate system
for the computer music project is
important, according to Grey and
Moorer, because it is a heavy
burden on an already overworked
system. The computer music
project shares a system with 110
others at the Artificial Intelligence
Center.
If a computer music center is
established here, it will probably
work closely with an institute for
research in music and acoustics
scheduled to be set up in Paris in
1976.
The researchers are also
planning to give some public
concerts this spring.

Moorer added.
Popular rock groups don't have
enough money to provide any
funding, but bands like the
Grateful Dead do have a
"tremendous interest" in the
activities of the computer music
project, noted Moorer.
"They are eager to reap the
fruits of our research," he said.
Establishing a separate system
for the computer music project is
important, according to Grey and
Moorer, because it is a heavy
burden on an already overworked
system. The computer music
project shares a system with 110
others at the Artificial Intelligence
Center.
If a computer music center is
established here, it will probably
work closely with an institute for
research in music and acoustics
scheduled to be set up in Paris in
1976.
The researchers are also
planning to give some public
concerts this spring.

COMPENDIUM OF WOMEN

Moorer added.
Popular rock groups don't have
enough money to provide any
funding, but bands like the
Grateful Dead do have a
"tremendous interest" in the
activities of the computer music
project, noted Moorer.
"They are eager to reap the
fruits of our research," he said.
Establishing a separate system
for the computer music project is
important, according to Grey and
Moorer, because it is a heavy
burden on an already overworked
system. The computer music
project shares a system with 110
others at the Artificial Intelligence
Center.
If a computer music center is
established here, it will probably
work closely with an institute for
research in music and acoustics
scheduled to be set up in Paris in
1976.
The researchers are also
planning to give some public
concerts this spring.
Available at 590-A Old Union.
