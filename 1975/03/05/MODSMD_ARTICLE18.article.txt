## A 						Last Hurrah For Senior Cagers 
### 
There is no doubt that the basketball class of 75
has left its mark in the annals of Maples. Before
they arrived Card hoop hopes were that Claude
Terry would score 30 or someone would start a
fight.
The pre-Kelley Cardinals (alias Indians) were
mediocre. They were predictable. They lost to the
good teams, beat the bad teams and traded with
other mediocre teams.
The class of 75 brought the element of
inconsistency. They'd give UCLA a scare, and then
theyd lose to Air Force. Rich Kelley would score
30 or score only a few. One night they were
flawless, the next night fumblc-fingered and
feeble-footed.
And this year they pulled off a coup de grace,
killing UCLA and USC in one glittering weekend.
Their record, ironically, is one game short of
.500 for the year and for their entire campaign. It
gives the ensuing Cal encounter a bit of belated
meaning.
At the post is Rich Kelley, who John Wooden
considers to be a true center in the tradition of Bill
Walton and Lew Alcindor.
"With Kelley sound, "says USC coach Bob Boyd,
"Stanford can beat anybody." Kelley averaged
nearly 20 points a game this year, scoring 35
against Oregon State.
At forward is Scott Trobbe, averaging about
three points a game, with two 20-point efforts,
against Illinois and Houston.
And at the guards are Melvin Arterberrv and
Mark Gilberg. Card coach Howie Dallmar considers
Arterberrv the best defensive guard in the Pac-8.
Gilberg has electrified fans with his driving layups,
long bombs and deft ball-handling.
And coming off the bench is Ben Bluitt, whose
on-off talents constantly kept the fans guessing.
They are a good basketball team. Perhaps not
great, perhaps not flawless, but they brought
college basketball to the Farm.
When UCLA seniors Pete Trgovich and Dave
Meyers left the game last weekend against Stanford
in their last Pauley Pavilion show, they were given a
long standing ovation.
For the seniors on Stanford who did much to
bring fans into Maples and almost created a real
basketball crowd, some sign of appreciation is
certainly deserving.
