## Harter: Not So Bad 
### Mike Tollin 
Dave Robinson thinks Dick Harter should
be kicked out of the Pacific Eight
Conference. "Th? feisty Oregon coach . . .
has contributed a lot of ugliness to Pac-8
basketball," Robinson opined in these pages
last week, and he is far from alone.
Most of the Pac-8 coaches seem to hold
similar sentiments. Harter's team has been
called "dirty," "cheap" and several other
unprintables, and the Ducks are about as
welcome in opposing gyms these days as
Larry Horton is to a frat party.
The whole thing is very unfortunate. For
Dick Harter is not anywhere near the savage
that some have made him out to be. He is not
the kind of person who would deliberately
hurt or abuse anyone. He is just a basketball
coach who wants to win basketball games
more than anything else in the world. One
Philadelphia reporter says, "[Harter's] drive
to win is almost frightening at times."
Anyone with this kind of intensity is
bound to make some people
unhappy regardless of what he's doing. When

Harter coached for the University of
Pennsylvania in the late 60s, he upset people
by frequently having his team stall the ball.
But no one ever insinuated that Harter's
Quakers were anything close to a dirty ball
club.
Now in his fourth year in the rainy state,
Harter's tenacity has again gotten him into
trouble. Two years ago, Harry Miller, head
coach at Wichita State, blessed Oregon with
the now-famous sobriquet "The Kamikaze
Kids." Since then, the legend of Dick Harter
and the Dirty Ducks has grown and grown.
When Harter speaks of this image now, his
normally unemotional voice rises a pitch.
"This whole Kamikaze thing has been blown
way out of proportion," he says. "Sure we
hustle, sure we go for loose balls, but
basically I coach like I did at Penn." And
that translates into aggressive, scrappy
basketball — not cheating, ugly ball like some
have said.
To show how some have distorted things,
Mark Barwig is called dirty for trying to draw
offensive fouls "dramatically." Yet when

Stanford's Mark Gilberg does it it's called
great basketball.
There are a couple of factors that go a long
way toward explaining Harter's West Coast
reputation. For one thing, Ronnie Lee, Stu
Jackson and the rest of Harter's crew are
unusually physical players, and no coach is
going to tell them not to mix it up a little bit.
In addition. Pac-8 officials allow much less
contact than Harter was accustomed to at
Penn. Plays that would draw raves from Big
Five fans often get whistles out here.
Whatever the causes, the "hard-driving"
Dick Harter of Penn is now the "dirty" Dick
Harter of Oregon. He has gotten a bad rap
that will be difficult to peel away, and when
talking to him about it, the hurt he feels is
obvious. Sure Harter's troops get a bit rowdy
at times, but I can't imagine Harter actually
encouraging on-court brutality. Harter is a
soft-spoken, rather insecure man who only
wants to win. Of his new life on the West
Coast, he says,"I like it when we win, I don't
like it when we don't."
You just have to understand.
