### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Intelligence
chief William E. Colby has told
President Ford that the CIA plotted
assassination attempts of several
foreign leaders, a high-ievel intelligence
source said yesterday.
Details of Colby's conversation with
Ford on Jan. 3 could not be learned,
but former agency officials insisted as
they have in the past that no killings
ever were carried out.
"Of course, there were plans," said
one official who said he did not know
what Colby told Ford. "There were
plans for what you would do to get
some particularly troublesome
international figure out of the wav ...
but none v/as ever approved." The
Wash in gton Star-News said yesterday that
Colby told Ford about the proposed
assassinations in January at the same
time he delivered a written report to
the President responding to charges of
domestic spying.
Both the White House and the CIA
refused to comment on the story.
According to the Star-News, Colby
"disclosed to the President
information about what were
described as several unsuccessful
assassination attempts that had taken
place overseas as far back as the early
19605."
A report by CBS News last Friday
indicated that Colby had told the
President that the CIA had been
involved in at least three successful
assassinations of foreign officials.
Sources' who did not have
knowledge of Colby's meeting with
Ford told the Associated Press that no
one had been killed and that no
attempts had ever been approved by
any of the agency's top officials.
The same officials confirmed the
existence of low-level plans to
assassinate Dominican Republic
dictator Rafael Trujillo and Cuban
Premier Fidel Castro. "If a feasible
plan could have been thought up for
the assassination of Castro, I'm sure
the Kennedy brothers would have
approved it" in the wake of the Bay of
Pigs disaster, one former official said.
