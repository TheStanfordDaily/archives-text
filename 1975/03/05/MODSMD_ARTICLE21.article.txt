# Card Batsmen Break Slump
## 
### DAN PYNE 
Led by the superb pitching of
Ken Grolle, the Stanford baseball
team swamped Santa Clara 4-1
yesterday and proved that the
power-hitting displayed earlier
this season was not an illusion.
Before they left for Arizona in
mid-February, the Cards were
hitting at a .307 clip. But since
returning Stanford has hit about a
feeble .160 and posted a 3-5
record.
Against Santa Clara, however,
Stanford got eight hits, including
two home runs and one triple.
The Cards are batting .235 for the
season.
Shortstop Steve Davis led the
attack with a triple in the second

inning, and a two-run shot over
the left field fence in the fourth.
Davis leads the team in hitting
with a .302 average.
Stanford scored first in the
second when rightfielder Bob
Hampton singled in Davis, and
again in the fourth on Davis'
home run and a subsequent shot
by designated hitter Ray
Cardinally who was moved up to
the varsity from the JV squad.
Davis split the 235-foot markers
with his hit; Cardinally a
freshman, hit a towering drive just
inside the left field post.
Card coach Ray Young also
moved freshman Paul Stewart up
from the JV team, and Stewart
made a great catch against the
deep-centerfield fence in the
fourth inning.
Grolle, now 2-0 for the season,

pitched seven innings for the
Cards, allowing one unearned run
on four scattered hits. The
Stanford righthander struck out
five and dropped his ERA to 1.69
Mike Williamson pitched the
eighth and ninth, retiring the
Santa Clara batters in order.
The win pushed
Stanford's record to 7-10, and left
Santa Clara at 12-2.
Monday the JVs beat San
Francisco State 8-1, and Stewart
got a double and a triple. Rik
Helmke got the win for the Card
JVs, who are now 5-4 with less
than half their season remaining.
