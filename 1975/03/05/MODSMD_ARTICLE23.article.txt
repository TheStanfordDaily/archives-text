Dale Set For Energy Compromise
WASHINGTON — Setting a May 1 goal for an energy
policy compromise with Congress, President Ford
postponed new oil tariff hikes yesterday and agreed to
delay lifting price controls on much domestically produced
petroleum.
At the same time, Ford signed a promised veto to a bill
that would strip him for 90 days of his authority to impose
higher tariffs on imported oil.
The conciliatory moves, which were urged upon him by
leaders of the Democratic-controlled Congress, were
squarely aimed at promoting a compromise energy
blueprint by May 1.
White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen emphasized
anew that the administration believes a draft energy
program chiefly sponsored by Chairman A 1 Ullman
(D-Ore.), of the House Ways and Means Committee will
provide a basis for discussion in fashioning a possible
compromise.
Ullman's plan calls for a gradual tax hike of 40 cents a
gallon on gasoline. Administration officals have estimated
that Ford's tariff increases would have raised gasoline prices
from 10 to 15 cents a gallon.
U.S. And Iran Sign Nuelear Agreement
WASHINGTON — The United States has agreed to sell
Iran eight nuclear power plants as part of an agreement that
will total some $15 billion in non-oil trade over the next
five years.
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, signing a technical
cooperation agreement with Rushang Ansary, minister of
finance and economic affairs, called the pact "the largest
agreement of this kind" between the United States and a
foreign country."
The agreement and a joint communique were signed
yesterday by Kissinger and Ansary after a two-day session
of the joint U.S.-Iran commission.
The atomic project tops off a wide-ranging pact with the
emerging Persian Gulf power that includes technological
assistance on several levels and in many fields, including the
training of Iranian technicians.
Blaek Cabinet Member Confirmed
WASHINGTON — William T. Coleman, the second black
ever named to a cabinet post, has been confirmed by the
Senate to be secretary of transportation.
Coleman, a Philadelphia lawyer, succeeds Claude S.
Brinegar, who resigned. The new secretary's nomination
was approved Monday on a voice vote without dissent.
Coleman is a former president of the NAACP Legal
Defense and Education Fund and was involved in several
landmark civil rights cases. He helped draft the brief that
led to the 1954 Supreme Court ruling outlawing school
desegregation.
Ethiopia Land Reforms End Feudalism
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The six-month-old military
government moved to end 2500 years of rural feudalism
yesterday with a sweeping proclamation placing all farm
land under state ownership, voiding all landlord-peasant
agreements and forbidding use of hired farm hands. •
The land reforms are the key element in thy Provisional
Military Administrative Council's plans to end Ethiopia's
traditional divisions of tribe, religion and class.
Under deposed Emperor Haile Selassie, 60 percent of
Ethiopia's population, some 15.6 million persons, were
sharecroppers on the farms of a handful of noble
landowners — including the imperial family.

MeCloskey Urges Cambodian Aid
WASHINGTON — A member of the congressional
fact-finding group that visited Indochina urged a House
subcommittee yesterday to approve $116.7 million for
ammunition and essentials to keep Cambodian forces
fighting through June 30.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-Calif.) delivered the
recommendation to the House foreign operations
appropriations subcommittee. He said he spoke for a
majority of the eight-member delegation.
The subcommittee was scheduled to take Congress'
initial action on Ford's request for an additional $222
million in aid to Cambodia.
House action is scheduled for next week if the aid is
approved by both the subcommittee and the full House
Appropriations Committee.
Meanwhile, Communist-led insurgents slammed more
than 30 rockets into Phnom Penh's airport yesterday as
American pilots continued to land cargo jets loaded with
rice, fuel and ammunition for the isolated Cambodian
capital. Initial reports indicated light casualties and no
damage.
In Phnom Penh itself, the insurgents fired at least nine
rockets into the downtown area, wounding seven persons.
Pentagon sources reported that a small force of Marines
and helicopters is afloat near the Gulf of Thailand in case
they are needed to evacuate Americans from Phnom Penh.
Algeria Asks Aid In Return For Oil
ALGIERS — Algerian President Houari Boumedienne
urged the oil cartel yesterday to offer the West stable prices
and loans to pay oil bills in return for massive development
aid to poor countries.
His proposals, amounting to the Third World's
oft-repeated call for a new world economic order, opened
the first-ever summit conference of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The national leaders, including Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlevi of Iran, later went into closed session to discuss the
plan.
Kidnappers Free Politieal Leader
BERLIN — Terrorist kidnapers freed political leader
Peter Lorenz early today after five jailed anarchists were
flown from West German to South Yemen where they were
given sanctuary.
Offials said the 52-year-old Lorenz appeared to be "in
very good condition" and was resting before being
questioned about his ordeal.
Convietion In Houston Killings
HOUSTON, Tex. — David Owen Brooks, the second
person to be tried in the largest mass murder case in
modern U.S. history, was convicted yesterday in the slaying
of a 15-year-old boy.
The boy was one of 27 youths killed in a
homosexual-torture ring.
The jury deliberated 90 minutes before returning the
verdict.
Brooks, 20, showed no emotion as he stood and faced
the jury box as the jurors were polled. His young wife wept,
and his father shaded his eyes with his hands.
Today's Weather

temperatures mid 40s to lower 50s. Cooler today and
