# Lyman Laments Perpetual Opposition
## Inertia Law Of Land At Stanford? 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Lamenting that "whatever change is
proposed, we seem to hear immediate
and very vocal opposition," President
Richard Lyman said yesterday,"It
makes us begin to wonder if inertia
isn't the law of the land at Stanford."
Appearing on a taping of KZSU's
Campus Conference, Lyman urged
students to use "some peispective" to
judge whether proposed changes in
Stanford "really are an important
threat to one's education."
Lyman applied the advice to
impending changes in housing options
and minority students' financial aid,
and to the much-touted "death of
undergraduate education" here.
"There is a point where things like
this ['death'] become self-fulfilling
prophecies. We could use a slight
cooling off of the rhetoric," Lyman
said.
"One hears mixed messages" from
undergraduates concerning their
education here, Lyman claimed. "You
don't always hear drum-fire
complaints that 'I'm having a terrible
time here.' The most favorable
comments seem to come from those
who have shown the most initiative to
take advantage of the things that are
offered."
Lyman revealed that he "was not

disposed to amend" the
recommendations of the Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA).
The stricter financial aid policy
advocated by C-UAFA "remains a lot
more beneficial from the point of view
of minorities than policies at
comparable institutions that I'm aware
of," Lyman maintained.
"I remain uneasy," he admitted,
about special treatment for minorities
in the proposed policy. But "it's often
necessary to accept policies that aren't
exactly what you would do if you
were making the decision," Lyman
said.
The president denied that a
Committee on Services to Students'
housing subcommittee
recommendation to convert all-women
Guthrie House into a new coed theme
house represented the beginning of the
end for all-women housing on campus.
"I don't think it's on the way out,"
Lyman said. He added, however, that
"we have supplied more all-women's
housing than the demand really has
justified."
Lyman dismissed complaints from
present Guthrie residents. "I haven't
heard of a dorm yet that was happy
with a change in its arrangements," he
stated.

The president also said:
—he has "never been a great
sympathizer with the D grade," fearing
that the problem of "standards" which
now results in a dearth of Cs merely
will be transferred to the D in a
"tinkering with the number of letters"
by the Committee on Academic
Achievement and Appraisal.
—complaints of some economics
students over the alleged lack of
radical professors may "open the door
to a series of ideological
confrontations in which it is not
obvious to me that radicals will be the
winners";
—he doesn't anticipate any
"sensational news" when the proposed
University budget for next year is
released later this week;
—"no basis whatever" exists for
charges by Asst. Psychology Prof.
Cedric X, recently denied tenure, that
a conspiracy exists to rid the
University of "religious-minded
professors"; and
—there is "no disposition" within
the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at
Stanford toward a reinstitution of
general studies requirements for all
undergraduates, although core
sequences within departments are
being considered.

Guthrie House into a new coed theme
house represented the beginning of the
end for all-women housing on campus.
"I don't think it's on the way out,"
Lyman said. He added, however, that
"we have supplied more all-women's
housing than the demand really has
justified."
Lyman dismissed complaints from
present Guthrie residents. "I haven't
heard of a dorm yet that was happy
with a change in its arrangements," he
stated.

The president also said:
—he has "never been a great
sympathizer with the D grade," fearing
that the problem of "standards" which
now results in a dearth of Cs merely
will be transferred to the D in a
"tinkering with the number of letters"
by the Committee on Academic
Achievement and Appraisal.
—complaints of some economics
students over the alleged lack of
radical professors may "open the door
to a series of ideological
confrontations in which it is not
obvious to me that radicals will be the
winners";
—he doesn't anticipate any
"sensational news" when the proposed
University budget for next year is
released later this week;
—"no basis whatever" exists for
charges by Asst. Psychology Prof.
Cedric X, recently denied tenure, that
a conspiracy exists to rid the
University of "religious-minded
professors"; and
—there is "no disposition" within
the Committee on the Reform and
Renewal of Liberal Education at
Stanford toward a reinstitution of
general studies requirements for all
undergraduates, although core
sequences within departments are
being considered.
Lamenting that "whatever change is
proposed, we seem to hear immediate
and very vocal opposition," President
Richard Lyman said yesterday,"It
makes us begin to wonder if inertia
isn't the law of the land at Stanford."
Appearing on a taping of KZSU's
Campus Conference, Lyman urged
students to use "some peispective" to
judge whether proposed changes in
Stanford "really are an important
threat to one's education."
Lyman applied the advice to
impending changes in housing options
and minority students' financial aid,
and to the much-touted "death of
undergraduate education" here.
"There is a point where things like
this ['death'] become self-fulfilling
prophecies. We could use a slight
cooling off of the rhetoric," Lyman
said.
"One hears mixed messages" from
undergraduates concerning their
education here, Lyman claimed. "You
don't always hear drum-fire
complaints that 'I'm having a terrible
time here.' The most favorable
comments seem to come from those
who have shown the most initiative to
take advantage of the things that are
offered."
Lyman revealed that he "was not

disposed to amend" the
recommendations of the Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (C-UAFA).
The stricter financial aid policy
advocated by C-UAFA "remains a lot
more beneficial from the point of view
of minorities than policies at
comparable institutions that I'm aware
of," Lyman maintained.
"I remain uneasy," he admitted,
about special treatment for minorities
in the proposed policy. But "it's often
necessary to accept policies that aren't
exactly what you would do if you
were making the decision," Lyman
said.
The president denied that a
Committee on Services to Students'
housing subcommittee
recommendation to convert all-women
Guthrie House into a new coed theme
house represented the beginning of the
