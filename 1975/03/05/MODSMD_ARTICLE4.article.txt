# Amick, Tax Rate Victors In School Board Voting
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
Former PTA president Jean Amick
defeated Stanford researcher Joshua
Goldstein for a seat on the Palo Alto
School Board yesterday, winning 6496
to 5658.
It was Goldstein's second loss in a
row. Incumbent Royce Cole beat him
for the same post last year.
District voters approved Proposition
A, a tax rate increase which will pump
some $2 million into District coffers
next year.
In other local races, three
incumbents on the Foothill
Community College Board, Robert
Smithwick, Franklin Johnson and
Howard Diesner, were returned to
office. Harry Kallshian defeated Mary
Hamilton, 10,288 to 7774, for a seat
on the county Board of Education.
Campus Support
Goldstein's campaign stressed the
maintenance of teaching positions
while advocating cuts in
administration and operations budgets.
Goldstein drew vocal support from
some campus groups. He is a
researcher at the Institute for Political
Studies here.
Amick will fill a vacancy left by
Preston Cutler, who is retiring this
year. Trustees receive no pay for their
participation on the Board.
Amick, a housewife, has served on
several school committees as well as
with the PTA. During her campaign,
she came out in support of greater
citizen participation in school board
decision-making, and said she placed a

high priority on career and vocational
training.
School board candidates Robert
Taylor and June Genis trailed badly in
the voting.
Defeat Effects
Many predicted that the defeat of
Proposition A would lead to drastic
cuts in teaching in the district, as well
as to the curtailment of many
programs.
Approval of the measure will permit
a higher ceiling on school
expenditures. AU present, the
maximum level of expenditure per
student in the district is $1777; with

the approval of Proposition A, that
figure will rise to $2058 by the
1977-78 school year.
The three Foothill incumbents won
handily over their closest competitors,
Andrew Cohen and Thomas Frankum,
both of whom received some
on-campus support.
Hamilton's defeat for the county
Board was another defeat for campus
political activists.
Goldstein had been active in the
local community, helping to organize
"alternative" schools, teaching in child
care centers and organizing a food
cooperative.
