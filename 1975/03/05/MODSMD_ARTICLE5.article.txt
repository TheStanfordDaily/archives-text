# X Claims Writings, Teaching Warranted Grant Of Tenure
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS Last Of Two Parts 
Cedric X, assistant professor of
psychology and communication who
has been denied tenure by both
departments, claims that his
scholarship was misunderstood by
professors who evaluated his case.
X, who insists that the departments
were prejudiced against him because of
his Muslim faith, told the Daily last
week that it is difficult for
traditionalist white scholars to
interpret the value of his work.
The letter to X from the Psychology
Department explained that "you have
shifted your interests to an
unorthodox direction in the
psychology field," according to X and
department chairman Eleanor
Maccoby.
"The department claimed to have
seriously considered the opinions of
black scholars [on X] but I know this
to be false," X said.
Calling himself a leader among black
psychologists, X, 38, claimed that he
would have been given tenure if
blacks' opinions of other blacks had
been given their proper role in the
decision-making process.
Luther X's Letter
According to X, Luther X, chairman
of the Psychology Department at

Morehouse College in Atlanta, sent a
copy of his letter of recommendation
to him [Cedric X], praising his
scholarship.
X said the letter stated that "his
scholarship is second to none. His
contributions are of a theoretical
nature and these formulations have
reflected an incisive and critical mind.
The quality of his formulations reflect
an independence of thought and sound
logical formulations that could be the
envy of scholars considerably his
senior."
While denying that all letters of
recommendation were as favorable as
Luther X's, Maccoby nevertheless
agreed that X's work was of high
quality, but not high enough to justify
tenure.
Faculty Voted No
Maccoby revealed that every
member of the psychology faculty —
with the exception of one member
who abstained — voted to deny X
tenure when a consensus was sought
from the group.
Maccoby noted that the unusual
nature of X's scholarship led to the
department's search for outside
opinions.
"We thought it best to go to others
since his research is not in line with
our thinking," Maccoby explained.

"We wanted very much to give a fair
break to a member of a minority that
has not been adequately represented in
our profession in the past."
20 Articles
X said he has published
approximately 20 scholarly articles,
half in psychology and half in
communication journals. He said he
objected to the Psychology
Department's contention that noted
scholars did not review all material
chosen for publication in those
particular journals.
X explained that many of his
articles were published in magazines
such as Black Psychology and Bfock
Health Perspective and claimed that
the department made an inadequate
effort to evaluate their worth.
The Psychology Department
probably objected to or
misunderstood the content of one of
his most notable writings, "The Role
of the White Researcher in Black
Psychology," X charged.
White World
Published in Social Issues, the
article said that "we should stop
viewing the world as if it were white
and all deviations from that view were
abnormal," according to X.
X also claimed that the
