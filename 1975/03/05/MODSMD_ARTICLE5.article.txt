# X Claims Writings, Teaching Warranted Grant Of Tenure
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS Last Of Two Parts 
Cedric X, assistant professor of
psychology and communication who
has been denied tenure by both
departments, claims that his
scholarship was misunderstood by
professors who evaluated his case.
X, who insists that the departments
were prejudiced against him because of
his Muslim faith, told the Daily last
week that it is difficult for
traditionalist white scholars to
interpret the value of his work.
The letter to X from the Psychology
Department explained that "you have
shifted your interests to an
unorthodox direction in the
psychology field," according to X and
department chairman Eleanor
Maccoby.
"The department claimed to have
seriously considered the opinions of
black scholars [on X] but I know this
to be false," X said.
Calling himself a leader among black
psychologists, X, 38, claimed that he
would have been given tenure if
blacks' opinions of other blacks had
been given their proper role in the
decision-making process.
Luther X's Letter
According to X, Luther X, chairman
of the Psychology Department at

Morehouse College in Atlanta, sent a
copy of his letter of recommendation
to him [Cedric X], praising his
scholarship.
X said the letter stated that "his
scholarship is second to none. His
contributions are of a theoretical
nature and these formulations have
reflected an incisive and critical mind.
The quality of his formulations reflect
an independence of thought and sound
logical formulations that could be the
envy of scholars considerably his
senior."
While denying that all letters of
recommendation were as favorable as
Luther X's, Maccoby nevertheless
agreed that X's work was of high
quality, but not high enough to justify
tenure.
Faculty Voted No
Maccoby revealed that every
member of the psychology faculty —
with the exception of one member
who abstained — voted to deny X
tenure when a consensus was sought
from the group.
Maccoby noted that the unusual
nature of X's scholarship led to the
department's search for outside
opinions.
"We thought it best to go to others
since his research is not in line with
our thinking," Maccoby explained.

"We wanted very much to give a fair
break to a member of a minority that
has not been adequately represented in
our profession in the past."
20 Articles
X said he has published
approximately 20 scholarly articles,
half in psychology and half in
communication journals. He said he
objected to the Psychology
Department's contention that noted
scholars did not review all material
chosen for publication in those
particular journals.
X explained that many of his
articles were published in magazines
such as Black Psychology and Bfock
Health Perspective and claimed that
the department made an inadequate
effort to evaluate their worth.
The Psychology Department
probably objected to or
misunderstood the content of one of
his most notable writings, "The Role
of the White Researcher in Black
Psychology," X charged.
White World
Published in Social Issues, the
article said that "we should stop
viewing the world as if it were white
and all deviations from that view were
abnormal," according to X.
X also claimed that the

RICHARD W. LYMAN
Communication Department did not
properly evaluate his research and
publication.
But Nathan Maccoby,
Communication Department
chairman, said, "We felt that X had
made no major or long term
contributions to the department. But
this doesn't mean that we don't think
that his scholarship is not excellent."
Student Support
X said he was strongly supported
for tenure by his students, but added
that he doesn't believe that their
opinions should have mattered much
in the decision.
According to Mrs. Maccoby,
however, many students were
consulted on X's tenure case. Some
students praised him highly while
others said he spent too much time
advocating his belief that the Western
world is materialistic and therefore
corrupt, Maccoby explained.
Several students contacted by the
Daily, however, denied that X uses his
classes as a forum for his beliefs.
Opinion Divided
Nathan Maccoby said that "student
opinions [about X] were very
divided."
X created a controversy in 1971
when he forced white students to sit in
the rear of his classroom. X said he did
this as part of a psychology
experiment to test the effects of racial
prejudice on whites. The University
ordered him to stop the experiment.
Mrs Maccoby said this was not a
factor in the decision to deny him
tenure.
X was at first reluctant to grant a
Daily reporter an interview because he
wrongly thought the reporter was

Jewish. X said readers would believe
the story was prejudiced if it was
written by a Jewish reporter.
Grades Unfairly
According to one white student
who took one of X's classes, X always
grades white students unfairly. The
student asked not to be identified.
But Sarah Kurtz, a white senior
majoring in psychology, said she took
X's course two quarters and received
an A both times. She said X often
gives As to whites and doesn't
discriminate in grading. Several other
students agreed with her.
"X is interested in what all his
students have to say," Kurtz said; "He
always has time to see students as if
he's not busy even though he is very
busy. In my four years of studying
psychology at Stanford, he is the only
professor in the department who
bothered to learn my name."
'Well Informed'
Andrea Love, a graduate student in
education, called X an "excellent
lecturer — very well informed."
Love said that while X "is interested
in issues relevant to minority
students," he also meets the needs of
non-minority students.
In her letter to X, Mrs. Maccoby
pointed out that enrollment in X's
classes is small and is growing smaller.
But X claimed that his classes are
becoming smaller because most of the
minority students interested in them
have already taken them. He predicted
that as new minority students enter
Stanford, enrollment will rise.
Kurtz agreed that enrollment in X's
classes is small, but said the limited
size contributed to better classes.
"X is interested in student input
and a large class is not as effective for

this type of teaching," she pointed
out. "X wants to hear individual
points of view. He has the skills to
draw original thought out of
students."
X's colleagues were generally
reluctant to comment on his case, but
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake —
while refusing to pass judgment on the
tenure decision — said that X's
scholarship is of very high quality.
"X shows a high degree of
resourcefulness in designing research
and scientific rigor in its execution and
interpretation," Drake said.
But Nathan Maccoby, while
expressing a "very high regard for X,"
said that "tenure is judgment of
outstandingness. Not every good
professor can receive tenure. Only a
few people can be given tenure."
Cedric X, assistant professor of
psychology and communication who
has been denied tenure by both

scholarship was misunderstood by

experiment to test the effects of racial
prejudice on whites. The University
ordered him to stop the experiment.
Mrs Maccoby said this was not a
factor in the decision to deny him
tenure.
X was at first reluctant to grant a
Daily reporter an interview because he
wrongly thought the reporter was

Jewish. X said readers would believe
the story was prejudiced if it was
written by a Jewish reporter.
Grades Unfairly
According to one white student
who took one of X's classes, X always
grades white students unfairly. The
student asked not to be identified.
But Sarah Kurtz, a white senior
majoring in psychology, said she took
X's course two quarters and received
an A both times. She said X often
gives As to whites and doesn't
discriminate in grading. Several other
students agreed with her.
"X is interested in what all his
students have to say," Kurtz said; "He
always has time to see students as if
he's not busy even though he is very
busy. In my four years of studying
psychology at Stanford, he is the only
professor in the department who
bothered to learn my name."
'Well Informed'
Andrea Love, a graduate student in
education, called X an "excellent
lecturer — very well informed."
Love said that while X "is interested
in issues relevant to minority
students," he also meets the needs of
non-minority students.
In her letter to X, Mrs. Maccoby
pointed out that enrollment in X's
classes is small and is growing smaller.
But X claimed that his classes are
becoming smaller because most of the
minority students interested in them
have already taken them. He predicted
that as new minority students enter
Stanford, enrollment will rise.
Kurtz agreed that enrollment in X's
classes is small, but said the limited
size contributed to better classes.
"X is interested in student input
and a large class is not as effective for

this type of teaching," she pointed
out. "X wants to hear individual
points of view. He has the skills to
draw original thought out of
students."
X's colleagues were generally
reluctant to comment on his case, but
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake —
while refusing to pass judgment on the
tenure decision — said that X's
scholarship is of very high quality.
"X shows a high degree of
resourcefulness in designing research
and scientific rigor in its execution and
interpretation," Drake said.
But Nathan Maccoby, while
expressing a "very high regard for X,"
said that "tenure is judgment of
outstandingness. Not every good
professor can receive tenure. Only a
few people can be given tenure."
Cedric X, assistant professor of
psychology and communication who
has been denied tenure by both
departments, claims that his
scholarship was misunderstood by
professors who evaluated his case.
X, who insists that the departments
were prejudiced against him because of
his Muslim faith, told the Daily last
week that it is difficult for
traditionalist white scholars to
interpret the value of his work.
The letter to X from the Psychology
Department explained that "you have
shifted your interests to an
unorthodox direction in the
psychology field," according to X and
department chairman Eleanor
Maccoby.
"The department claimed to have
seriously considered the opinions of
black scholars [on X] but I know this
to be false," X said.
Calling himself a leader among black
psychologists, X, 38, claimed that he
would have been given tenure if
blacks' opinions of other blacks had
been given their proper role in the
decision-making process.
Luther X's Letter
According to X, Luther X, chairman
of the Psychology Department at

Morehouse College in Atlanta, sent a
copy of his letter of recommendation
to him [Cedric X], praising his
scholarship.
X said the letter stated that "his
scholarship is second to none. His
contributions are of a theoretical
nature and these formulations have
reflected an incisive and critical mind.
The quality of his formulations reflect
an independence of thought and sound
logical formulations that could be the
envy of scholars considerably his
senior."
While denying that all letters of
recommendation were as favorable as
Luther X's, Maccoby nevertheless
agreed that X's work was of high
quality, but not high enough to justify
tenure.
Faculty Voted No
Maccoby revealed that every
member of the psychology faculty —
with the exception of one member
who abstained — voted to deny X
tenure when a consensus was sought
from the group.
Maccoby noted that the unusual
nature of X's scholarship led to the
department's search for outside
opinions.
"We thought it best to go to others
since his research is not in line with
our thinking," Maccoby explained.

"We wanted very much to give a fair
break to a member of a minority that
has not been adequately represented in
our profession in the past."
20 Articles
X said he has published
approximately 20 scholarly articles,
half in psychology and half in
communication journals. He said he
objected to the Psychology
Department's contention that noted
scholars did not review all material
chosen for publication in those
particular journals.
X explained that many of his
articles were published in magazines
such as Black Psychology and Bfock
Health Perspective and claimed that
the department made an inadequate
effort to evaluate their worth.
The Psychology Department
probably objected to or
misunderstood the content of one of
his most notable writings, "The Role
of the White Researcher in Black
Psychology," X charged.
White World
Published in Social Issues, the
article said that "we should stop
viewing the world as if it were white
and all deviations from that view were
abnormal," according to X.
X also claimed that the

RICHARD W. LYMAN
Communication Department did not
properly evaluate his research and
publication.
But Nathan Maccoby,
Communication Department
chairman, said, "We felt that X had
made no major or long term
contributions to the department. But
this doesn't mean that we don't think
that his scholarship is not excellent."
Student Support
X said he was strongly supported
for tenure by his students, but added
that he doesn't believe that their
opinions should have mattered much
in the decision.
According to Mrs. Maccoby,
however, many students were
consulted on X's tenure case. Some
students praised him highly while
others said he spent too much time
advocating his belief that the Western
world is materialistic and therefore
corrupt, Maccoby explained.
Several students contacted by the
Daily, however, denied that X uses his
classes as a forum for his beliefs.
Opinion Divided
Nathan Maccoby said that "student
opinions [about X] were very
divided."
X created a controversy in 1971
when he forced white students to sit in
the rear of his classroom. X said he did
this as part of a psychology
experiment to test the effects of racial
prejudice on whites. The University
ordered him to stop the experiment.
Mrs Maccoby said this was not a
factor in the decision to deny him
tenure.
X was at first reluctant to grant a

member of the psychology faculty —
with the exception of one member
who abstained — voted to deny X
tenure when a consensus was sought
from the group.
Maccoby noted that the unusual
nature of X's scholarship led to the
department's search for outside
opinions.
"We thought it best to go to others
since his research is not in line with
our thinking," Maccoby explained.

"We wanted very much to give a fair
break to a member of a minority that
has not been adequately represented in
our profession in the past."
20 Articles
X said he has published
approximately 20 scholarly articles,
half in psychology and half in
communication journals. He said he
objected to the Psychology
Department's contention that noted
scholars did not review all material
chosen for publication in those
particular journals.
X explained that many of his
articles were published in magazines
such as Black Psychology and Bfock
Health Perspective and claimed that
the department made an inadequate
effort to evaluate their worth.
The Psychology Department
probably objected to or
misunderstood the content of one of
his most notable writings, "The Role
of the White Researcher in Black
Psychology," X charged.
White World
Published in Social Issues, the
article said that "we should stop
viewing the world as if it were white
and all deviations from that view were
abnormal," according to X.
X also claimed that the

RICHARD W. LYMAN
Communication Department did not
properly evaluate his research and
publication.
But Nathan Maccoby,
Communication Department
chairman, said, "We felt that X had
made no major or long term
contributions to the department. But
this doesn't mean that we don't think
that his scholarship is not excellent."
Student Support
X said he was strongly supported
for tenure by his students, but added
that he doesn't believe that their
opinions should have mattered much
in the decision.
According to Mrs. Maccoby,
however, many students were
consulted on X's tenure case. Some
students praised him highly while
others said he spent too much time
advocating his belief that the Western
world is materialistic and therefore
corrupt, Maccoby explained.
Several students contacted by the
Daily, however, denied that X uses his
classes as a forum for his beliefs.
Opinion Divided
Nathan Maccoby said that "student
opinions [about X] were very
divided."
X created a controversy in 1971
when he forced white students to sit in
the rear of his classroom. X said he did
this as part of a psychology
experiment to test the effects of racial
prejudice on whites. The University
ordered him to stop the experiment.
Mrs Maccoby said this was not a
factor in the decision to deny him
tenure.
X was at first reluctant to grant a
Daily reporter an interview because he
wrongly thought the reporter was

Jewish. X said readers would believe
the story was prejudiced if it was
written by a Jewish reporter.
Grades Unfairly
According to one white student
who took one of X's classes, X always
grades white students unfairly. The
student asked not to be identified.
But Sarah Kurtz, a white senior
majoring in psychology, said she took
X's course two quarters and received
an A both times. She said X often
gives As to whites and doesn't
discriminate in grading. Several other
students agreed with her.
"X is interested in what all his
students have to say," Kurtz said; "He
always has time to see students as if
he's not busy even though he is very
busy. In my four years of studying
psychology at Stanford, he is the only
professor in the department who
bothered to learn my name."
'Well Informed'
Andrea Love, a graduate student in
education, called X an "excellent
lecturer — very well informed."
Love said that while X "is interested
in issues relevant to minority
students," he also meets the needs of
non-minority students.
In her letter to X, Mrs. Maccoby
pointed out that enrollment in X's
classes is small and is growing smaller.
But X claimed that his classes are
becoming smaller because most of the
minority students interested in them
have already taken them. He predicted
that as new minority students enter
Stanford, enrollment will rise.
Kurtz agreed that enrollment in X's
classes is small, but said the limited
size contributed to better classes.
"X is interested in student input
and a large class is not as effective for

this type of teaching," she pointed
out. "X wants to hear individual
points of view. He has the skills to
draw original thought out of
students."
X's colleagues were generally
reluctant to comment on his case, but
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake —
while refusing to pass judgment on the
tenure decision — said that X's
scholarship is of very high quality.
"X shows a high degree of
resourcefulness in designing research
and scientific rigor in its execution and
interpretation," Drake said.
But Nathan Maccoby, while
expressing a "very high regard for X,"
said that "tenure is judgment of
outstandingness. Not every good
professor can receive tenure. Only a
few people can be given tenure."
Cedric X, assistant professor of
psychology and communication who
has been denied tenure by both
departments, claims that his
scholarship was misunderstood by
professors who evaluated his case.
X, who insists that the departments
were prejudiced against him because of
his Muslim faith, told the Daily last
week that it is difficult for
traditionalist white scholars to
interpret the value of his work.
The letter to X from the Psychology
Department explained that "you have
shifted your interests to an
unorthodox direction in the
psychology field," according to X and
department chairman Eleanor
Maccoby.
"The department claimed to have
seriously considered the opinions of
black scholars [on X] but I know this
to be false," X said.
Calling himself a leader among black
psychologists, X, 38, claimed that he
would have been given tenure if
blacks' opinions of other blacks had
been given their proper role in the
decision-making process.
Luther X's Letter
According to X, Luther X, chairman
of the Psychology Department at

Morehouse College in Atlanta, sent a
copy of his letter of recommendation
to him [Cedric X], praising his
scholarship.
X said the letter stated that "his
scholarship is second to none. His
contributions are of a theoretical
nature and these formulations have
reflected an incisive and critical mind.
The quality of his formulations reflect
an independence of thought and sound
logical formulations that could be the
envy of scholars considerably his
senior."
While denying that all letters of
recommendation were as favorable as
Luther X's, Maccoby nevertheless
agreed that X's work was of high
quality, but not high enough to justify
tenure.

Maccoby revealed that every
member of the psychology faculty —
with the exception of one member
who abstained — voted to deny X

classes is small, but said the limited
size contributed to better classes.
"X is interested in student input
and a large class is not as effective for

this type of teaching," she pointed
out. "X wants to hear individual
points of view. He has the skills to
draw original thought out of
students."
X's colleagues were generally
reluctant to comment on his case, but
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake —
while refusing to pass judgment on the
tenure decision — said that X's
scholarship is of very high quality.
"X shows a high degree of
resourcefulness in designing research
and scientific rigor in its execution and
interpretation," Drake said.
But Nathan Maccoby, while
expressing a "very high regard for X,"
said that "tenure is judgment of
outstandingness. Not every good
professor can receive tenure. Only a
few people can be given tenure."
