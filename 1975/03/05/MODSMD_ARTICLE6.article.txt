## Opinions editorial Bring Back Ds 
### 
The Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(C-AAA) will vote today on a final report on reform of the
grading system and present its recommendation to the
Faculty Senate tomorrow.
In a preliminary vote, the C-AAA recommended the
reinstitution of the D grade, but reversed subcommittee
proposals to restore an early drop deadline and a recorded
"no credit" grade on students transcripts.
We support these recommendations. We have already
stated our opposition to bringing back the no credit mark
and drop deadline, noting that their reinstitution would
penalize students without reducing grade inflation.
The D grade would, however, reduce the present grade
point average of about 3.4 without penalizing students. The D
grade would better relate the A, Band C to their proper
meanings.
At present, the B grade stands for no more than average
work in a course, while a C is a minimum pass grade that,
many students are ashamed to see on their transcripts. It a D
grade were instituted, the B would become evidence of good
work, while the C would become satisfactory.
We doubt that professors will give very many Ds. They
will, however, be able to increase their proportion of Cs
without fear of stigmatizing the student.
We also note with favor the statement of C-AAA member
Ann Bamcsberger that "student input had a lot to do with
the decision." We are glad students spoke up. They
apparently succeeded in getting a better grading system than
if they had been silent.
