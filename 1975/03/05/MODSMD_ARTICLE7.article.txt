# The 						'San Jose 30'
## 
### 
On Jan. 23, 30 demonstrators
were arrested outside the San Jose
Court House while Ruchell MaGee
was being sentenced to life
imprisonment inside.
Our demonstration was
intended to draw public as well as
media attention to the injustices
done to MaGee during his 11-year
struggle to obtain a fair trial, and
to call for a mass movement to
free him and all other political
prisoners.
MaGee's case is a clear example
of,, how our legal system
concentrates its oppression on the
poor, and on working-class and
thirdjworld people. It is important
for everyone who is opposed to
racism and exploitation to
support this and other prison
struggles.
Not coincidentally, the
California law (169 PC) under
which we were arrested, "Parading
or picketing in or near a
courthouse with the intent to
obstruct justice or influence the
court: Misdemeanor," was passed
as a result of political education
done around the 1970 Angela
Davis trial (Davis was originally a
co-defendant of MaGee in the trial
following the Marin County
Rebellion). This law was passed to
repress any freedom of speech or
public dissent about treatment of
political prisoners.
We were not there to demand
leniency (from the judge) for

Win go, ef aI.

Magee — the sentence was
mandatory — nor were we a
physical threat to the court.
In fact, no one in the
courtroom could hear or see us.
The police waited until we had
begun to disperse to surround us,
and even arrested two people who
had been spectators at the
sentencing. Since we broke no
law, why were we arrested?
Clearly, the authorities did not
fear our influence on the court,
but rather our public call for
support in Magee's and other
prison struggles.
Repression by the ruling class,
however mild it was in this case,
of public dissent is a consistent
reaction, as the events at Kent
State, Jackson State, and the
recent police riot at the South
Vietnamese embassy in San
Francisco on Jan. 27 attest to.
We have formed the San Jose
30 Defense Committee not
because we feel horribly abused,
but to defend our right to bring
the facts of MaGee's case and the
lessons of solidarity and hope
from all prison struggles to the
public, and we urge everyone to
support us in our upcoming trials.
