# Humanize California's Prisons
## 
### 
First Of Two Parts
California's correctional system has long
since been recognized as the prototype of
American prisons. Its bold and innovative
implementation of the indeterminate
sentence in 1917 ushered in a new approach
to penal reform.
The purpose was twofold: first, it sought
to end the often arbitrary sentencing
practices of the judicial branch by placing a
minimum and maximum limit on sentences,
and second, it encouraged the reformation of
the individual by forcing him to earn his own
release date.
This "model" system subordinated the
punitive and deterrent functions of the past
to the more enlightened rehabilitative
approach, where the inmate was given the
chance to improve himself and demonstrate
his capacity for coping with a normal social
environment.
Humanitarian View
This humanitarian philosophy was
"perfected" in 1944 when the Adult
Authority was created independently of the
California Department of Corrections and
invested with the power to set the inmate's
parole date according to his rehabilitative
progress. The nine members of the board,
appointed every four years by the governor,
could dictate the inmate's program and
thereby insure that he develop into a fit

member of society.
The indeterminate sentence supposedly
offered the final and most effective solution
to the law and order problems of the day.
Recent evidence, however, reveals that this
"innovation" has become as archaic as the
system it was designed to serve. The manifest
attempts by the Adult Authority to prevent
any systemic reform has plunged the
California penal system into stagnation.
Under this system, the median time served
for felony first releases has consistently been
higher for every offense than the national
average.
No Due Process
Although the Adult Authority is a
deliberative body, it is not subject to the due
process provisions of the Constitution, and
hence its power is both arbitrary and
omnipotent. Inmates are eligible for parole
after serving two-thirds of the minimum term,
and come before the board once a year.
Neither his family nor his attorney are
allowed into the hearing, which lasts from 30
seconds to 15 minutes. All relevant
information, including unverified conduct
reports, plea bargaining agreements,
psychiatric evaluations, is included in the
inmate's "jacket" — none of it is made
available at any time to either the prisoner or
his counsel.
If parole is denied, the inmate has no
recourse to judicial review since a transcript

Morrison, Spitzer

of the proceedings is not recorded. He must,
instead, bitterly await the uncertainty of the
upcoming year.
Consequences
Several consequences result from this
rehabilitative model:
—once imprisoned, the length of an
inmate's sentence is no longer necessarily
determined by his crime;
—the emphasis toward rehabilitation is
outer, not inner-directed, i.e., the prisoner
enrolls in those programs which will "look
good" in his jacket;
—he is subjected to the brutalizing
uncertainty of an indefinite release date, a
condition which is undoubtedly behind much
of the violence in state prisons today;
—the arbitrary and abusive power of the
Adult Authority compounds an inmate's
frustration and resentment toward the entire
criminal justice system.
The Department of Corrections has
perpetuated the myth of rehabilitation for
too long. It is essential that the American
people realize the futility of forced
compliance in redirecting an individual's
attitudes and behavior, and insist upon a
more humane and egalitarian system of penal
justice. Society alone will pay for its delay.

California Department of Corrections and
invested with the power to set the inmate's
parole date according to his rehabilitative
progress. The nine members of the board,
appointed every four years by the governor,
could dictate the inmate's program and
thereby insure that he develop into a fit

member of society.
The indeterminate sentence supposedly
offered the final and most effective solution
to the law and order problems of the day.
Recent evidence, however, reveals that this
"innovation" has become as archaic as the
system it was designed to serve. The manifest
attempts by the Adult Authority to prevent
any systemic reform has plunged the
California penal system into stagnation.
Under this system, the median time served
for felony first releases has consistently been
higher for every offense than the national
average.
No Due Process
Although the Adult Authority is a
deliberative body, it is not subject to the due
process provisions of the Constitution, and
hence its power is both arbitrary and
omnipotent. Inmates are eligible for parole
after serving two-thirds of the minimum term,
and come before the board once a year.
Neither his family nor his attorney are
allowed into the hearing, which lasts from 30
seconds to 15 minutes. All relevant
information, including unverified conduct
reports, plea bargaining agreements,
psychiatric evaluations, is included in the
inmate's "jacket" — none of it is made
available at any time to either the prisoner or
his counsel.
If parole is denied, the inmate has no
recourse to judicial review since a transcript

Morrison, Spitzer

of the proceedings is not recorded. He must,
instead, bitterly await the uncertainty of the
upcoming year.
Consequences
Several consequences result from this
rehabilitative model:
—once imprisoned, the length of an
inmate's sentence is no longer necessarily
determined by his crime;
—the emphasis toward rehabilitation is
outer, not inner-directed, i.e., the prisoner
enrolls in those programs which will "look
good" in his jacket;
—he is subjected to the brutalizing
uncertainty of an indefinite release date, a
condition which is undoubtedly behind much
of the violence in state prisons today;
—the arbitrary and abusive power of the
Adult Authority compounds an inmate's
frustration and resentment toward the entire
criminal justice system.
The Department of Corrections has
perpetuated the myth of rehabilitation for
too long. It is essential that the American
people realize the futility of forced
compliance in redirecting an individual's
attitudes and behavior, and insist upon a
more humane and egalitarian system of penal
justice. Society alone will pay for its delay.

First Of Two Parts
California's correctional system has long
since been recognized as the prototype of
American prisons. Its bold and innovative
implementation of the indeterminate
sentence in 1917 ushered in a new approach
to penal reform.
The purpose was twofold: first, it sought
to end the often arbitrary sentencing
practices of the judicial branch by placing a
minimum and maximum limit on sentences,
and second, it encouraged the reformation of
the individual by forcing him to earn his own
release date.
This "model" system subordinated the
punitive and deterrent functions of the past
to the more enlightened rehabilitative
approach, where the inmate was given the
chance to improve himself and demonstrate
his capacity for coping with a normal social
environment.
Humanitarian View
This humanitarian philosophy was
"perfected" in 1944 when the Adult
Authority was created independently of the
California Department of Corrections and
invested with the power to set the inmate's
parole date according to his rehabilitative
progress. The nine members of the board,
appointed every four years by the governor,
