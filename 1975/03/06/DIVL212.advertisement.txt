Protect your Budget!
In this time of inflation your
budget is being squeezed dry.
To beat the squeeze combine
your entertainment with learn
ing. Consider this:
A movie for two costs from
55.00 to 57.00. But a paper
back book costs only 75c to
$2.95.
Join the thousands of other
Peninsulans who each week
enjoy a leisurely browse
through Kepjers Books, home
of all the paperbacks.
