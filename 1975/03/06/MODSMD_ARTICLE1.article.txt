# Reagan: Mild Barbs For Ford, Kudos For Brown
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Hoover Institution's newest
honorary fellow yesterday had some
mild criticism for a Republican
president and some mild praise for a
Democratic governor.
Former California Gov. Ronald
Reagan, who's also depositing his
official papers at the Institution, told
the Daily yesterday that while he
respects President Ford, he fears the
President may not be giving enough
weight to the conservative viewpoint.
At the same time, though, the
Republican Reagan had some kind
words for his Democratic successor,
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. Reagan
said he's been "very pleased" at
Brown's austere approach to the state
budget.
In a telephone interview from his
Westwood office, Reagan, 63,
expressed dissatisfaction with at least
some of President Ford's
appointments.
Without mentioning anybody by
name, Reagan said he thought some
Ford appointments were too
politically diverse. "Instead of trying

to span a spectrum, I've always
thought that a person should surround
himself with people who can help him
implement his own philosophy," he
said.
'An Instant President'
But Reagan softened his criticism of
Ford, noting that "you have to face
the very unique situation, that this
man was really an instant president.
He was an overnight president, in that
he didn't have the time for preparation
he might have." Ford, he said, is
"certainly a most sincere and
dedicated man."
Reagan has often been mentioned as
the presidential candidate of a
potential conservative third-party
movement. But yesterday, he
reiterated his desire to "work for the
reconstruction" of the Republican
Party.
"If you believe the polls, the
overwhelming majority of Republicans
call themselves conservatives and
support a conservative approach." This
bloc, the former governor said, is "just
too large to ignore."
As he has done in the past, Reagan

declined to discuss his future political
plans, saying that "we ought to be
putting our effort into solving these
problems that we face right now. We
are just spinning our wheels by
discussing an election that is still
almost two years away."
Full Calendar
Between now and then, Reagan has
a full calendar. Besides his numerous
speaking engagements, the governor is
also producing syndicated newspaper
and radio commentaries, and is serving
on the President's blue-ribbon
commission investigating the Central
Intelligence Agency. (He expects the
probe to wind up by June, he said.)
In addition, his Hoover duties will
take up an undetermined amount of
time. (Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell has said he thinks Reagan
will be here about one day a month. A
spokesman from Campbell's office said
yesterday thai Reagan will be here
March 14.)
Reagan will reportedly participate
in discussions and workshops at the
Institution, as well as aiding in the
organization of his papers. Reagan aide

Molly Sturges has been named
archivist-researcher for the papers,
which have already begun arriving on
campus.
Reagan said he chose Hoover as
recipient of his papers because he has
been a "great admirer" of the work
done there, and because "I've always
had a kindly feeling towards
independent education in the state."
During hi§ term of office, Reagan also
worked with Campbell, and appointed
him to the University of California's
Board of Regents.
Despite all the claims on his time,
Reagan said he has still kept an eye on
the operations of state government,
and has been pleased by some actions
of his successor. He was particularly
impressed, he said, with Gov. Brown's
"approach to budgeting," saying it's
"in keeping with what's needed."
No Taj Mahal
He disagrees, however, with Brown's
denunciations of the new governor's
mansion currently under construction
just outside the capital. "This thing
has been a political football for 40

years, and I finally decided that the
only way to solve the problem was for
one governor to take the step and
build the home for succeeding
governors."
The new house, he said, "is not a
Taj Mahal, and is not nearly as
gradiloquent as some of those
governors' residences in much smaller
states."
Reagan and his wife recently
attended a gathering in honor of
former President Richard Nixon at
former Ambassador Walter
Annenberg's Palm Springs home. He
described Nixon as "in good spirits,
and coming aloag physically."
But whether Nixon will ever take an
active hand in national or Republican
Party affairs, Reagan said, "only time
will tell; only history can judge."
