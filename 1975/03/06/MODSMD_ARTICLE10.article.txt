Blacks Still Enslaved
Editor:
I would like to comment on
Jim Wascher's Feb. 24 Daily
column, "Minority Privileges:
Discriminatory?"
Personally, I find it difficult to
understand the concern about
reverse discrimination.
Black Americans were brought
to America as slaves; chained and
shackled. For centuries, we have
been in bondage and although we
were granted that great and
glorious document called the
Emancipation Proclamation and
enjoyed the transitory fruits of
the Reconstruction, we are still
slaves. Make no mistake about it.
We are slaves to public policy
decisions and administrative
regulations and "make believe"
affirmative action policies; slaves
to the constantly perpetuated
myth that we, as blacks, are lazy,
shiftless, irresponsible, genetic
inferiors who can not and are not
willing to adhere to the Protestant
work ethic.
How long must the dream be
deferred â€” so eloquently stated in
the Declaration of Independence
that we are all endowed with
fundamental and unalienable
rights?
Who is to assure that there will
be equality under the law? When
will the grievances of centuries,
our slave history, be redressed?
When and how long must we
wait?
How can we be expected to
pull ourselves up by our
bootstraps v when we can't afford
the boots and no one will sell us
the string?
Whites are culpable. They
should not run or hide from their
culpability. I say not that they
must pay a price for their
transgressions. I say only that the
grievances must be addressed.
Such charges of reverse
discrimination only add one more
link in oppression's chains.
