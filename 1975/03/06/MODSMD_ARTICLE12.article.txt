## Women Celebrate Women's Day With Call To Action Women's Day Fair To Be Held In April 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
A coalition from the Women's
Center, the Center for Research
on Women (CROW) and a
SWOPSI class (174 B) are
organizing a week-long fair to
celebrate International Women's
Year.
The United Nations has
declared 1975 as International
Women's Year, not as a
celebration of equality but as a
call to action. The U.N. has
outlined its goals as:
—Promotion of equality between
men and women.
—Integration of women into the
total social and economic
development effort of nations;
—Recognition of women's
increasing contribution to
strengthening world peace.
Women's Day—March 8
This year's Women's Year fair
will be similar to last year's fair
during the week of Women's Day,
which occurs every year on March
8. Sponsors of this fair explain
that Women's Day falls at an
awkward time of winter quarter,
so they will hold the fair the
second week of spring quarter,
April 7-13.
The fair will begin Monday
morning when participants will
build an information booth in
White Plaza. During the week the
women will hold a series of
workshops, panel discussions, and
speeches.
Sponsors say they have two
basic aims for the fair: to reach
and educate people in the
community, and to work with
other women.
"Some of it is like preaching to
the enlightened," says ASSU Sen.
Debbi Silton, but many of the
presentations are designed to give
support and constructive advice to
women who already see
themselves as feminists.
Student-Initiated
Karen Petersen of the Women's
Center says that the fair will also
revitalize the Center, allowing it
to reach more women in the
community.
CROW coordinator Cindy

Davis emphasizes that the fair has
been "completely
student-initiated." Similar events
at Canada College and San Jose
State, "initiated from above,"
lacked the student input this fair
will have, she says.
The coordinators have gotten a
"splendid response" from people
who want to help, according to
Terry Borchers, a Stanford
alumna. The only problem has
been with fund-raising, she adds.
Need For Funds
The organizers have submitted
funding proposals to the
University and several community
organizations, but Borchers says
that funding groups hesitate to
commit themselves until the
sponsors can "guarantee some
big-name speakers."
So far, CROW has arranged a
speech by Phyllis Chessler, author
of Women in Madness, and
tentative arrangements have been
made with Warren Farrell, author
of The Liberated Man. Poet Susan
Gryffin will also come to discuss
her work and if thje organizers can
raise $380, she will also present
her play. Voices.
Borchers is organizing a

"Women's Playday" on Friday,
hopefully with beer and a band.
Borchers says they are trying to
bring together staff women,
graduate students, and
undergraduates in this
"celebratioh of women together."
After a series of workshops on
Saturday, the fair will relax with a
dance Saturday night and an art
festival Sunday.
Davis emphasizes that the
organizers are trying to encompass
as wide a range of interests as
possible, and she invites students
with ideas for the fair to contact
either CROW or the Women's
Center.
