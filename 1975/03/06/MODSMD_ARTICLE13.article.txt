# Women Strive For Education, Equality...

"To be able to work closely
with other women in collective
leadership roles is all too rare for
â€¢most women in today's world,"
declares Vicki Bier of her interest
in coordinating the Committee on
Women in Health, one aspect of
the International Women's Year
Fair.
Ann Garrison, coordinator of
finances, is more practical in
evaluating her responsibilities.
"I'm raising money because it has
to be done for the fair to
happen."
The approach of both of these
women exhibits the combination
of firm ideological commitment
and realistic planning which is
characteristic of the women
organizing the fair, to take place
during the week of April 7-13.
'Bring Women Together'
Sheri Ross, coordinator of
Women in the Arts, has assembled
a diverse array of women artists,
some coming from as far as New
York City to take part in the fair.
"I'm just real interested in what
women have to say and how they
express it,"says Ross.
Terri Borchers, coordinator of
the Women's Play day, explains,
"We see the Playday as a chance
for women to celebrate and play
together in the spirit of the
victories women have won ... and
to break down any alienation
from each other women might
feel."
As chairperson of the
Committee on Women and the
Law, Karen Petersen hopes "to
bring women together not only to
discuss ... the pertinent issues,
but to also provide role-models

for those women at Stanford who
might be interested in a law
related career."
Similar Ideologies
Despite the diverse interests
which spread the coordinators
among various topical sectors of
the fair, they share many
ideological assessments of the
importance of having a women's
fair.
"It is of utmost importance to
present women who have found
their own voice, identified the
particularity of a woman's
experience, and have made
contributions to our male
identified culture," contends
Borchers.
Feedback System
Says Bier, "It provides a forum
for discussing questions critical to
the future development of our
society ... an opportunity for
women and men to educate
themselves on issues pertaining to
feminism."
"What is set up is a feedback
system," says Petersen, "One
begins to relate the ideas that are
being discussed to yourself, the
process of organizing to educate
others becomes an educational

process in itself."
Most of the organizers
expressly indicate concern that
the fair will generate results that
will outlast the week-long event
itself.
Indeed, the organizational
meetings reveal a high level of
commitment and contributions of
time and energy on the part of the
planners. The value of cooperative
effort is evident.
Declares Borchers, "The issues
don't die when the week-long fair
is over.... We're going to keep
telling the University that women
are discriminated against and keep
telling women and men that we
aren't going to sit back and
watch."
