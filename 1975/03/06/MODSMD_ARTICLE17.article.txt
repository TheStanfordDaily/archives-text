# Best Bets
## 
### 
Last week, we told you there was very
little to do and see on campus. This
week, we have happier news.
At Stanford, there are several best
bets. On Friday night, Stanford
concludes the current basketball season
by meeting Berkeley at Maples Pavilion.
If the Cards win (they lost to Cal at
Berkeley), they are assured a fourth
place tie in the league.
This game, by the way, will be the last
Stanford game for both Rich Kelley and
official Ernie Filiberti, who is retiring.
Rumor has it that he will be honored in a
special half time ceremony. (No
comment.)
If you don't prefer to retire but you
wish a less tension-ridden environment,
try Music From Marlboro in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, sponsored by the Public
Events Office. This is the musicians'
sixth appearance at Stanford and each
year they are well received.
Through a combination of
woodwinds, piano and voice, the five
musicians perform seldom-heard
masterworks and more familiar chamber
music from the 16th century to the
present.
On Saturday, for equally good music,
try not to miss the Stanford Wind
Ensemble, which will perform music of
Berg, Schumann and Copland. If you
prefer film, the Law School Film Society
presents a vintage picture The Roaring
Twenties, starring Bogart and Cagney
and, on Sunday, the ASSU Flicks screens
Sleuth, a great mystery, starring Michael
Caine and Laurence Olivier.
A new film Breezy, which is receiving
too much publicity (enough to make

anyone stop listening to AM radio),
is now at the Hacienda Cinema in
Sunnyvale. In spite of the
commercialization, it features William
Holden and might have potential.
And although Clint Eastwood directed
it, we're not sure if it features any
Rawhide. (Sorry about that. You should
have known it was coming.)
For a good laugh, Phyllis Diller opens
tonight at the Venetian Room of the
Fairmont in San Francisco. Diller, who
started in San Francisco at the Purple
Onion in 1955, underwent plastic
surgery four years ago, but says,"I still
project the same image while
performing. I just showed the housewife
that it isn't a sin to look a lot better."
Fang, are you listening? Gloria Steinem,
are you?
If you want a film that finishes what
Phyllis Diller starts, try the Invisible
Man, which shows men up as the evil
creatures we are, particularly one man,
played by Claude Rains, who "sets out
to conquer the world," according to a
press release. The 1933 film was based
on H.G. Wells' novel and will be screened
on Creature Features.
Since we are accused of concentrating
too much on the crass and not enough
on the cultural, let us end on this high
note: the American Ballet Theatre is
tonight presenting Fernando Bujones,
America's answer to Rudolf Nuryev,
performing in "La Bayadere," "A Pas de
Deux," "The River" and "Concerto" at
the Opera House. He is, by all accounts,
magnifique.
