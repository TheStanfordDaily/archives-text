Israelis Capture Arab-Held Hotel
TEL AVIV — Israeli troops early today stormed a Tel
Aviv hotel in which Arab terrorists were holding dozens of
foreign tourists hostage, and after heavy gunfire a
spokesman for the Israeli military command said: "It is all
over."
"The army is in control of the hotel," Radio Israel
reported.
It said there was a short fire-fight as the troops clashed
with the terrorists inside the building.
Soldiers were carrying dead bodies and wounded persons
to waiting ambulances.
The army attacked at 5:15 a.m., following a long lull and
about six hours after the Arab guerrillas stormed ashore
from two rubber rafts with guns blazing and captured the
hotel.
The terrorists took dozens of European tourists hostage,
and the A 1 Fatah guerrilla organization announced in Beirut
that they were demanding the release of 10 prisoners from
Israeli jails, including the Greek Catholic archbishop of
Jerusalem, Msgr. Hilarion Capudji.
Al Fatah also demanded that a United Nations plane take
the 10 prisoners to an Arab capital.
But meanwhile the Israeli government ordered the army
into action, in line with its consistent policy of refusing to
pive in to terrorist demands regardless of the consequences.
Abzug Discloses CIA File Contents
WASHINGTON — Rep. Bella Abzug disclosed yesterday
that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) opened some of
her private mail, reported on a meeting she had with Viet
Cong representatives and collected her speeches and
statements against the Vietnam war.
Abzug (D-N.Y.) held up the CIA file on herself and
disclosed some of its contents at a hearing of the House
subcommittee on individual rights, which she heads.
The file was provided by CIA Director William Colby,
who outlined for the committee the list of files that the
agency keeps on U.S. citizens and acknowledged that some
material in them "may not be appropriate."
Abzug said that the CIA file on her goes back to 1953,
when as a lawyer she represented clients before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities.
Abzug said it contains a report on a meeting she and
another congressman had with Viet Cong representatives,
her attendance at a Women's Strike for Peace conference in
1967 and an anti-war speech at a demonstration in New
York City in 1971.
Meanwhile, leaders of the Senate committee investigating
the CIA and other U.S. intelligence operations met with
President Ford at the White House and told reporters they
got a qualified pledge of cooperation form the the
President.
Bank SI ashes Prime Interest Rate
NEW YORK — Morgan Guaranty Trust dropped its

prime rate yesterday to the lowest level in nearly two years
in a move to encourage businesses to borrow and spend
their way out of the recession. Congressional committees,
meanwhile, considered tax cut legislation designed to get
individuals to do the same thing.
Six California banks followed Morgan's lead.
A spokesman for Morgan said the rate was reduced "in
response to the continuing decline in other short-term
interest rates . . . and the continuing decline in demand by
businesses for loans."
He said an increase in the amount of borrowing "should
have a positive effect on the economy."
The lowering of the prime rate, which has been falling
steadily since the beginning of the year, brought an increase
in stock market prices, encouraging potential investors in
business.
Simon Marks Cloture Breakthrough
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary William Simon
told the Senate Finance Committee yesterday that the
$21.3 billion tax cut approved by the House provides too
much relief for low-income families and not enough for
middle-income consumers who purchase many of the
house-hold appliances, automobiles and other products
whose sales have been affected by the recession.
"It is clear that the purchase of durable goods has to be
increased if the recession is to be turned around," Simon
said, adding that there has been a 34 percent reduction in
the purchase of such items.
The secretary urged the legislators to adopt President
Ford's proposal that would aim 57 percent of its benefits to
families making less than $20,000, but only 15 percent to
taxpayers with incomes under $10,000.
Senate Moves To End Filibuster
WASHINGTON — A key breakthrough was scored
yesterday by members seeking a change in Senate rules to
make it easier to choke off filibusters.
Sen .James Allen (D-Ala.) leader of the fight against a
change, conceded that within a few days he and others
allied with him will go down to defeat.
"We are witnessing the crushing of dissent, the cutting
off of the right of free debate in the Senate," he said.
Cloture, or the limitation of debate, can now be put into
effect under Senate Rule 22 only by a two-thirds majority
of senators voting.
This debate cut-off move was a first step on the way to
getting action on a compromise proposal advanced by
Senate leaders of both parties.

in a move to encourage businesses to borrow and spend
their way out of the recession. Congressional committees,
meanwhile, considered tax cut legislation designed to get
individuals to do the same thing.
Six California banks followed Morgan's lead.
A spokesman for Morgan said the rate was reduced "in
response to the continuing decline in other short-term
interest rates . . . and the continuing decline in demand by
businesses for loans."
He said an increase in the amount of borrowing "should
have a positive effect on the economy."
The lowering of the prime rate, which has been falling
steadily since the beginning of the year, brought an increase
in stock market prices, encouraging potential investors in
business.
Simon Marks Cloture Breakthrough
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary William Simon
told the Senate Finance Committee yesterday that the
$21.3 billion tax cut approved by the House provides too
much relief for low-income families and not enough for
middle-income consumers who purchase many of the
house-hold appliances, automobiles and other products
whose sales have been affected by the recession.
"It is clear that the purchase of durable goods has to be
increased if the recession is to be turned around," Simon
said, adding that there has been a 34 percent reduction in
the purchase of such items.
The secretary urged the legislators to adopt President
Ford's proposal that would aim 57 percent of its benefits to
families making less than $20,000, but only 15 percent to
taxpayers with incomes under $10,000.
Senate Moves To End Filibuster
WASHINGTON — A key breakthrough was scored
yesterday by members seeking a change in Senate rules to
make it easier to choke off filibusters.
Sen .James Allen (D-Ala.) leader of the fight against a
change, conceded that within a few days he and others
allied with him will go down to defeat.
"We are witnessing the crushing of dissent, the cutting
off of the right of free debate in the Senate," he said.
Cloture, or the limitation of debate, can now be put into
effect under Senate Rule 22 only by a two-thirds majority
of senators voting.
This debate cut-off move was a first step on the way to
getting action on a compromise proposal advanced by
Senate leaders of both parties.
Today's Weather

thundershowers. Chance of showers tomorrow. Lows both
nights mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow mid

Israelis Capture Arab-Held Hotel
TEL AVIV — Israeli troops early today stormed a Tel
Aviv hotel in which Arab terrorists were holding dozens of
foreign tourists hostage, and after heavy gunfire a
spokesman for the Israeli military command said: "It is all
over."
"The army is in control of the hotel," Radio Israel
reported.
It said there was a short fire-fight as the troops clashed
with the terrorists inside the building.
Soldiers were carrying dead bodies and wounded persons
to waiting ambulances.
The army attacked at 5:15 a.m., following a long lull and
about six hours after the Arab guerrillas stormed ashore
from two rubber rafts with guns blazing and captured the
hotel.
The terrorists took dozens of European tourists hostage,
and the A 1 Fatah guerrilla organization announced in Beirut
that they were demanding the release of 10 prisoners from
Israeli jails, including the Greek Catholic archbishop of
Jerusalem, Msgr. Hilarion Capudji.
Al Fatah also demanded that a United Nations plane take
the 10 prisoners to an Arab capital.
But meanwhile the Israeli government ordered the army
into action, in line with its consistent policy of refusing to
pive in to terrorist demands regardless of the consequences.
Abzug Discloses CIA File Contents
WASHINGTON — Rep. Bella Abzug disclosed yesterday
that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) opened some of
her private mail, reported on a meeting she had with Viet
Cong representatives and collected her speeches and
statements against the Vietnam war.
Abzug (D-N.Y.) held up the CIA file on herself and
disclosed some of its contents at a hearing of the House
subcommittee on individual rights, which she heads.
The file was provided by CIA Director William Colby,
who outlined for the committee the list of files that the
agency keeps on U.S. citizens and acknowledged that some
material in them "may not be appropriate."
Abzug said that the CIA file on her goes back to 1953,
when as a lawyer she represented clients before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities.
Abzug said it contains a report on a meeting she and
another congressman had with Viet Cong representatives,
her attendance at a Women's Strike for Peace conference in
1967 and an anti-war speech at a demonstration in New
York City in 1971.
Meanwhile, leaders of the Senate committee investigating
the CIA and other U.S. intelligence operations met with
President Ford at the White House and told reporters they
got a qualified pledge of cooperation form the the
President.

Aviv hotel in which Arab terrorists were holding dozens of
foreign tourists hostage, and after heavy gunfire a
spokesman for the Israeli military command said: "It is all
over."
"The army is in control of the hotel," Radio Israel
reported.
It said there was a short fire-fight as the troops clashed
with the terrorists inside the building.
Soldiers were carrying dead bodies and wounded persons
to waiting ambulances.
The army attacked at 5:15 a.m., following a long lull and
about six hours after the Arab guerrillas stormed ashore
from two rubber rafts with guns blazing and captured the
hotel.
The terrorists took dozens of European tourists hostage,
and the A 1 Fatah guerrilla organization announced in Beirut
that they were demanding the release of 10 prisoners from
Israeli jails, including the Greek Catholic archbishop of
Jerusalem, Msgr. Hilarion Capudji.
Al Fatah also demanded that a United Nations plane take
the 10 prisoners to an Arab capital.
But meanwhile the Israeli government ordered the army
into action, in line with its consistent policy of refusing to
pive in to terrorist demands regardless of the consequences.
Abzug Discloses CIA File Contents
WASHINGTON — Rep. Bella Abzug disclosed yesterday
that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) opened some of
her private mail, reported on a meeting she had with Viet
Cong representatives and collected her speeches and
statements against the Vietnam war.
Abzug (D-N.Y.) held up the CIA file on herself and
disclosed some of its contents at a hearing of the House
subcommittee on individual rights, which she heads.
The file was provided by CIA Director William Colby,
who outlined for the committee the list of files that the
agency keeps on U.S. citizens and acknowledged that some
material in them "may not be appropriate."
Abzug said that the CIA file on her goes back to 1953,
when as a lawyer she represented clients before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities.
Abzug said it contains a report on a meeting she and
another congressman had with Viet Cong representatives,
her attendance at a Women's Strike for Peace conference in
1967 and an anti-war speech at a demonstration in New
York City in 1971.
Meanwhile, leaders of the Senate committee investigating
the CIA and other U.S. intelligence operations met with
President Ford at the White House and told reporters they
got a qualified pledge of cooperation form the the
President.
Bank SI ashes Prime Interest Rate
NEW YORK — Morgan Guaranty Trust dropped its

prime rate yesterday to the lowest level in nearly two years
in a move to encourage businesses to borrow and spend
their way out of the recession. Congressional committees,
meanwhile, considered tax cut legislation designed to get
individuals to do the same thing.
Six California banks followed Morgan's lead.
A spokesman for Morgan said the rate was reduced "in
response to the continuing decline in other short-term
interest rates . . . and the continuing decline in demand by
businesses for loans."
He said an increase in the amount of borrowing "should
have a positive effect on the economy."
The lowering of the prime rate, which has been falling
steadily since the beginning of the year, brought an increase
in stock market prices, encouraging potential investors in
business.
Simon Marks Cloture Breakthrough
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary William Simon
told the Senate Finance Committee yesterday that the
$21.3 billion tax cut approved by the House provides too
much relief for low-income families and not enough for
middle-income consumers who purchase many of the
house-hold appliances, automobiles and other products
whose sales have been affected by the recession.
"It is clear that the purchase of durable goods has to be
increased if the recession is to be turned around," Simon
said, adding that there has been a 34 percent reduction in
the purchase of such items.
The secretary urged the legislators to adopt President
Ford's proposal that would aim 57 percent of its benefits to
families making less than $20,000, but only 15 percent to
taxpayers with incomes under $10,000.
Senate Moves To End Filibuster
WASHINGTON — A key breakthrough was scored
yesterday by members seeking a change in Senate rules to
make it easier to choke off filibusters.
Sen .James Allen (D-Ala.) leader of the fight against a
change, conceded that within a few days he and others
allied with him will go down to defeat.
"We are witnessing the crushing of dissent, the cutting
off of the right of free debate in the Senate," he said.
Cloture, or the limitation of debate, can now be put into
effect under Senate Rule 22 only by a two-thirds majority
of senators voting.
This debate cut-off move was a first step on the way to
getting action on a compromise proposal advanced by
Senate leaders of both parties.
