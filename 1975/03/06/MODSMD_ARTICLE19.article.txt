# Hillel Head Won't Resign
## 
### BETTY GOODWIN 
Rabbi Charles Familant, director of
the Hillel Foundation, told the Daily
last week that contrary to his
statement last spring, he intends to
continue in his present capacity next
year.
Familant said last year he would
step down from his post at the end of
this year. That statement came amidst
dissension in the Hillel group over
Familant's role.
Familant, who has been director of
Stanford Hillel for 10 years, had said
he was interested in finding a fulltime
teaching position that would require
less administrative and social
responsibilities.
"I was convinced I was leaving,"
said Familant. But now that responses
from job applications are in, "I realize
that the kind of position I'm looking
for is just not available at this point."
Familant said that next year he
plans to improve the Hillel program.
He hopes to initiate more "creative
programming" and attempt to "reach
a wider spectrum of the Stanford
Jewish community."
Council Request
Though a formal resignation was
never made, Familant's verbal
agreement to resign was prompted by
the Hillel Council's request that he
leave.
Said one • Council member who
wished to remain anonymous, "The
battle is really over what his campus

role should be. He's a dull,
non-organizing type director. He
doesn't take initiative — he responds.
You have to push him to help you on
projects or activities, and now, people
don't bother."
However, Doug Krohn, Council
member and editor of the quarterly
Jewish magazine, On One Foot, said
the Council "didn't serve as a
representative group of Jewish
students."
Self-Appointed
The Council consisted last year of
eight self-appointed students and
faculty members who adopted the
title, "Hillel Council."
Said Krohn, "They were just eight
concerned people who felt widespread
dissatisfaction with Familant and
Hillel, but their dissatisfaction
transferred to Familant — the only
permanent Hillel factor."
According to Famiiant, only two or
three of the Council's members had
any previous connection with Hillel,
and the rest "were non-Hillelites .... I
became the issue for the vitality of the
organization."
Council member Mark Rosekind
said the group last spring wasn't
attempting to "get rid of Familant,"
but rather, "the Council was deciding
what Hillel needed." He cited better
programming, more participation from
students and an effective outreach
program as goals.
"The Council wanted the

pre packaged programs of high school
Hillel directors," said Krohn.
"Familant won't take up the reins and
give you a pre-packaged program. He
hopes an individual will instigate his
own activities."

member and editor of the quarterly
Jewish magazine, On One Foot, said
the Council "didn't serve as a
representative group of Jewish
students."
Self-Appointed
The Council consisted last year of
eight self-appointed students and
faculty members who adopted the
title, "Hillel Council."
Said Krohn, "They were just eight
concerned people who felt widespread
dissatisfaction with Familant and
Hillel, but their dissatisfaction
transferred to Familant — the only
permanent Hillel factor."
According to Famiiant, only two or
three of the Council's members had
any previous connection with Hillel,
and the rest "were non-Hillelites .... I
became the issue for the vitality of the
organization."
Council member Mark Rosekind
said the group last spring wasn't
attempting to "get rid of Familant,"
but rather, "the Council was deciding
what Hillel needed." He cited better
programming, more participation from
students and an effective outreach
program as goals.
"The Council wanted the

pre packaged programs of high school
Hillel directors," said Krohn.
"Familant won't take up the reins and
give you a pre-packaged program. He
hopes an individual will instigate his
own activities."
Rabbi Charles Familant, director of
the Hillel Foundation, told the Daily
last week that contrary to his
statement last spring, he intends to
continue in his present capacity next
year.
Familant said last year he would
step down from his post at the end of
this year. That statement came amidst
dissension in the Hillel group over
Familant's role.
Familant, who has been director of
Stanford Hillel for 10 years, had said
he was interested in finding a fulltime
teaching position that would require
less administrative and social
responsibilities.
"I was convinced I was leaving,"
said Familant. But now that responses
from job applications are in, "I realize
that the kind of position I'm looking
for is just not available at this point."
Familant said that next year he
plans to improve the Hillel program.
He hopes to initiate more "creative
programming" and attempt to "reach
a wider spectrum of the Stanford
Jewish community."
Council Request
Though a formal resignation was
never made, Familant's verbal
agreement to resign was prompted by
the Hillel Council's request that he
leave.
Said one • Council member who
wished to remain anonymous, "The
battle is really over what his campus

role should be. He's a dull,
non-organizing type director. He
doesn't take initiative — he responds.
You have to push him to help you on
projects or activities, and now, people
don't bother."
However, Doug Krohn, Council
member and editor of the quarterly
Jewish magazine, On One Foot, said
the Council "didn't serve as a
