# Prof. Brown: End Cambodian Aid
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Religious Studies Prof. Robert McAfee Brown, recently
returned from an investigative trip to Cambodia, yesterday
expressed his sharp disagreement with Rep. Paul McCloskey
Jr.'s stance on continuing U.S. military aid to Cambodia
through June 1.
Charging that McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) "bought the
(U.S.) Ambassador's [John Gunther Dean] line," Brown
said that "the sooner we are not providing ammunition to
the Lon Nol regime, the sooner the war will end, and the
fewer lives will be lost."
Speaking before a crowd of about 75 in the Round
Room of Memorial Church, Brown said that he was
"appalled by [McCloskey's] notion that we continue to
contribute to the bloodbath by remaining in Cambodia
through June 1."
McCloskey's position, as stated last Monday, is that more
lives will be saved if over two million people have until June
to escape the Communist onslaught and possible execution.
'Vicious Bloodbath'
According to Brown, however, the fighting in Phnom
Penh alone is costing 1000 lives each day."I cannot
conceive of a bloodbath of even the most vicious order that
could compare with the destruction caused by 10 years of
American presence in Southeast Asia or even with the
90,000 lives that would be lost between now and June 1,"
he stated.
Brown also proposed that those concerned about giving
more U.S. aid to Cambodia make their opinions known and
also become familiar with the Paris Peace Accords, which
he called "the vehicle to get peace." He added, "The main
reason that the wars in Indochina go on is the American
presence ... in direct violation of the Paris agreement.
There's no way of getting around that."
Members of the audience, which was more than half
composed of community citizens, generally expressed anger
at McCloskey's new stance on Cambodian aid.
"I've never been so obsessed with anything as I am
obsessed with McCloskey's betrayal," said one woman.
Members of the audience passed around petitions and
solicited contributions for a newspaper ad protesting
McCloskey's position.
McCloskey will speak in Cubberley Auditorium at noon
tomorrow.
Denied Entrance Visa
Brown was invited to participate in a four-team effort
which is to prepare papers on problems in the area, after
visiting North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos and

Cambodia. Originally, he was a member of the team going
to Saigon; however, the Thieu regime denied him an
entrance visa on what Brown said "were purely political
reasons."
Once in Phnom Penh, he said, he was immediately
"struck by the situation of war, hearing artillery every
morning, listening to the rockets bursting in the city, seeing
the barbed wire and the soldiers."
Unfortunately, he said, there was not much opportunity
to see a variety of political points of view, adding that there
was "no possibility of talking with the factions of the
Khmer Rouge insurgents."
The team was given the VIP treatment, according to
Brown. They saw every member of the Cambodian cabinet
and were granted a formal audience with Lon Nol.
Privately-Funded
Brown said the preliminary planning stages of his trip
occurred at a meeting of the Fund for Reconstruction and
Reconciliation in Indochina, which includes most large
church groups with the exception of the Roman Catholic
church.
Using funds raised from private sources, totaling about
$5 million, a 15-member board which heads the Fund
decides on "creative projects to aid those in Indochina,"
Brown said.
Brown also said that $2 million were allocated for aid to
North Vietnam, $1 million to South Vietnam and the rest
to countries and groups in the surrounding area.
