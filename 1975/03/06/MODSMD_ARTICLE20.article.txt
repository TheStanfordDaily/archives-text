In a press release issued yesterday
the Rosenbaum slate said they "would
function as a 'watchdog on the
Administration.' "
According to the ASSU
Constitution, the election will be held
April 16 and 17. Petitions, requiring
100 signatures per slate (which must
have at least two members) will be
available at the beginning of next
quarter and are due in the ASSU office
by 4 p.m., April 7.
ASSU Vice President Ann Carter
said she expected that "more people
would be running seriously" than in
the past because they "realize the
ASSU can and is doing something."
She and Quinn Mayer, another ASSU
vice president, said neither they as
individuals nor the current COP would
endorse a slate. Carter said that she
thought endorsing a slate would be
detrimental to that slate.
