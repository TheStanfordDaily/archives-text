# Three Slates To Enter Race For ASSU Council
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
At least three slates of candidates
are planning to run in next month's
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP)
race, the Daily has learned.
One of the established slates is
headed by ASSU Senate Chairman Lee
Rosenbaum. Another has not yet
decided who will lead it. The third has
not been put together yet, but will be
connected with the campus humor
magazine, Chaparral.
Rosenbaum's slate includes
Charlotte Germane, an ASSU senator
and member of the Campus Judicial
Panel; Dave Galligan, member of the
ASSU Nominations Committee; and
Josie Jaramillo, who has worked with
MEChA and is a member of Students
for Equity.
ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott;
Andrew Leuchter, director of the
Speaker's Bureau; Bonny Rodden,
who has worked on the Daily editorial
staff for two years; and Mark
Simonian, former Daily managing
editor and assistant public affairs
director at KZSU, compose another
slate.
Chaparral Editor Mike Dornheim
the candidates for the Chaparral
slate have not yet been chosen, but
indicated it would be "not too much
of a joke slate," though he expected
an "element of absurdity someplace."
He said he would not be on the slate.
COP As 'Facilitator'
Rosenbaum said his slate was
formed three weeks ago. He claimed it
would be "much more concerned with
student advocacy" than the current
council."The ASSU should represent
students to the administration," he
emphasized.
He said that he views the COP as a
"facilitator in relation to student
services," rather than an initiator. He

added that the council should have the
experience and the ability to be
student advocates in areas of campus
interest.
Rosenbaum added that there is "no
plan to scrap" any of the services that
currently exist."
Leuchter said his slate had been
finalized only Tuesday. He explained
that McDermott and he first got
together and looked for others to be
on the slate, deciding on Rodden and
Simonian.
Since the slate was just recently
formulated, he said it is "hard to say
how we're going to stand on the
issues," though he indicated they
planned to deal with "all the
important" ones.

Both he and Simonian agreed the
slate would balance its roles as student
advocates and as initiator of student
services.
"I don't think we'll be limited to
student services," Simonian stated,
noting that some people may assume
that.
Simonian and Rodden served on the
Daily editorial staff as associate editor,
and associate news editor respectively
through yesterday.
Daily Editor Kevin Smith said he
had decided, after consulting with
others, that it would be best for them
to take a mandatory leave-of-absence
pending the results of the election.
Simonian will continue working for
