# Senate Revokes Support Of Parking Boycott, Suit
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Senate voted unanimously last night to withdraw its support of the
boycott of the motor vehicle registration fee and to refrain from further legal
action against the University.
The Senate also requested the University Ombudsman John Goheen be asked
to serve as arbiter and that the administration reply before April 1.
The Senate also voted 16-0 to place fee assessment requests of one dollar from
both the Speaker's Bureau and the Publications Board on the spring quarter
ballot.
The resolution to withdraw support of the boycott, submitted by Sen. Pieter
Winsemius, noted that a court decision might settle the legality issue "but not
the more important one of fairness and equity." Continued legal action would
also entail a spring quarter fee assessment, the resolution stated.
'Appropriate Channel'
The resolution further noted that President Lyman's response to the Senate's
resolution asking for his personal intervention in the issue had been that he
found himself "unable to meet together on the issues without overtones of legal
confrontation inevitably entering the picture."
Given all this, Winsemius said he thought the ombudsman would be the most
"appropriate channel" through which to settle the parking fee issue.

Sen. William Hoke said he was "very
pessimistic about the chances of the
resolution's being successful."
Hoke was supported by Cathy
Colson, a student who has been
working on settlement of the issue.
Colson said that so far, the
administrators have "not been very
receptive to ideas," calling students
"too idealistic."
'Significantly Different'
Dale Snape, assistant dean of
student affairs, pointed out that
"Arbitration is significantly different
from what an ombudsman does."
After more discussion. Sen. Tim
Conway called the question, and the
resolution was passed unanimously,
16-0.
Next year's Speaker's Bureau
Director Mike Nelson reported that
the Speaker's Bureau may seek another
fee assessment in the fall, contingent
on the success of the first request.
Publications Board Chairman Rich
Jaroslovsky requested the first fee
assessment for the Publication Board
since the spring of 1972. One of the
Pub Board's problems is the
"incredibly skyrocketing costs" of
necessary materials such as paper,
Jaroslovsky noted.
The Quad and the Daily will not be
receiving money from this particular
assessment.
In other action, the Senate voted to
give $300 to the Women's Center to
help defray speakers' costs for the
upcoming International Women's Year
Fair.
—voted $100 to the Committee on
the Lounge for Off-Campus Students
for initial operating costs.
—voted a unanimous endorsement
of the new elections commissioner,
Robert Kenmore, a Ph.D. student in
the Graduate School of Business.
