# Students Protest University-Iranian Contract
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
More than 200 students turned
out yesterday in White Plaza for a
rally protesting the contract soon to
be signed between the University and
Iran,
After the rally, about 150 students
marched to President Richard
Lyman's office, to the McCullough
Building, where Electrical
Engineering (EE) 235 was meeting
and to the Institute for
Communication Research. Under the
contract, EE 235 students would
design a domestic communication
system for Iran, with advice from
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker.
About two dozen members of the
Iranian Students Association of
Northern California (ISANC),
wearing paper bags over their heads,
joined the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC) at the rally. ARC
member Seth Foldy said that the
Iranian students feared reprisals if
their government finds out that they
participated in the demonstration.
'Repressive Regime'
Foldy introduced a speaker from
ISANC, explaining, "I can't reveal his
name for the same reason the other
students are wearing masks." The
Iranian student and ARC member
Cynthia Elliott charged that the
satellite would increase the power of
the Shah who now runs a "repressive
regime."
The University would be giving the
Shah the technology and know-how
to further extend his ability to
indoctrinate and exploit the people

of Iran," the student said.
In an in-class discussion with ARC
members last week, one Iranian
student in EE 235 said that he would
not agree that Iran is a "military
state." He predicted that the Shah
would heavily control the

information broadcast over the
satellite system, but added that any
efforts to educate the people of Iran
would only help them.
Health Care Improvements
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan, who teaches EE 235,

defended the work in a teach-in
Tuesday night. He said that the new
system will improve health care in
remote villages and that the Shah
already has the capacity to spread
propaganda over existing radio and
television broadcast systems.

But the Iranian student who spoke
at the rally said he was not impressed
with Lusignan's "minimal
knowledge" of the Iranian situation.
"We don't think that U.S.
imperialism is going to educate the
Iranian people,"he concluded.
Elliott discussed recent University
policies on minority aid, SWOPSI
and SCIRE, and the safety of women
students. She said that all education
is political, including education here
and in Iran.
She reminded the crowd that, "A
few years ago we succeeded in
getting classified research off
campus," and urged students to try
to prevent the signing of the contract.
ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton said
threats against SWOPSI and SCIRE
represent the same sort of political
repression as active participation in
the Iran contract.
"Lyman says he can't understand
why students are always in
opposition to his policies," she said,
"Maybe it's because his policies are
perfectly wrong."
ARC members presented a
guerrilla theater skit depicting both
the Shah and the University, "a
liberal institution of higher
education," as tools of Monopoly
Capital.
The marching students did not
talk with Lyman, Lusignan or Parker.
ARC nfember Stephane Woolhandler
said that the march after the rally
was meant as an "educational tour'
for the students rather than a forum
for confrontations.

ANONYMOUS DISSENSION—About 200 students protested the University communication system contract with Iran
yesterday. Assembled in White Plaza, Iranian demonstrators wore paper bags to conceal their identity and preserve their
safety.
More than 200 students turned
out yesterday in White Plaza for a
rally protesting the contract soon to
be signed between the University and
Iran,
After the rally, about 150 students
marched to President Richard
Lyman's office, to the McCullough
Building, where Electrical
Engineering (EE) 235 was meeting
and to the Institute for
Communication Research. Under the
contract, EE 235 students would
design a domestic communication
system for Iran, with advice from
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker.
About two dozen members of the
Iranian Students Association of
Northern California (ISANC),
wearing paper bags over their heads,
joined the Alliance for Radical
Change (ARC) at the rally. ARC
member Seth Foldy said that the
Iranian students feared reprisals if
their government finds out that they
participated in the demonstration.
'Repressive Regime'
Foldy introduced a speaker from
ISANC, explaining, "I can't reveal his
name for the same reason the other
students are wearing masks." The
Iranian student and ARC member
Cynthia Elliott charged that the
satellite would increase the power of
the Shah who now runs a "repressive
regime."
The University would be giving the
Shah the technology and know-how
to further extend his ability to
indoctrinate and exploit the people

of Iran," the student said.
In an in-class discussion with ARC
members last week, one Iranian
student in EE 235 said that he would
not agree that Iran is a "military
state." He predicted that the Shah
would heavily control the

information broadcast over the
satellite system, but added that any
efforts to educate the people of Iran
would only help them.
Health Care Improvements
Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan, who teaches EE 235,

defended the work in a teach-in
Tuesday night. He said that the new
system will improve health care in
remote villages and that the Shah
already has the capacity to spread
propaganda over existing radio and
television broadcast systems.

But the Iranian student who spoke
at the rally said he was not impressed
with Lusignan's "minimal
knowledge" of the Iranian situation.
"We don't think that U.S.
imperialism is going to educate the
Iranian people,"he concluded.
Elliott discussed recent University
policies on minority aid, SWOPSI
and SCIRE, and the safety of women
students. She said that all education
is political, including education here
and in Iran.
She reminded the crowd that, "A
few years ago we succeeded in
getting classified research off
campus," and urged students to try
to prevent the signing of the contract.
ASSU Sen. Debbi Silton said
threats against SWOPSI and SCIRE
represent the same sort of political
repression as active participation in
the Iran contract.
"Lyman says he can't understand
why students are always in
opposition to his policies," she said,
"Maybe it's because his policies are
perfectly wrong."
ARC members presented a
guerrilla theater skit depicting both
the Shah and the University, "a
liberal institution of higher
education," as tools of Monopoly
Capital.
The marching students did not
talk with Lyman, Lusignan or Parker.
ARC nfember Stephane Woolhandler
said that the march after the rally
was meant as an "educational tour'
for the students rather than a forum
for confrontations.
