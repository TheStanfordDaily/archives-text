## Opinions editorial Cambodian Aid 
### 
President Ford has asked for $222 million in additional
military aid to support the Lon Nol government in
Cambodia, which appears in imminent danger of collapse.
While we realize that cessation of such aid would likely
hasten Nol's downfall, we still oppose any more aid to
Cambodia.
This war has gone on long enough. The United States
should not do anything to prolong the killing in a war in
which it is not clear that the people of Cambodia support
the Nol regime. As in Vietnam, the U.S. should not be aiding
one side in a civil war.
In addition to this, reports (as from Sen. Barry
Goldwater) that the war is probably already lost lead us to
wonder why the U.S. is so willing to toss $222 million away
money that can only be spent in further killing.
Our congressman, Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park),
said Monday he supported the extension of military aid to
Cambodia until June 1, as well as lifting the ceiling on U.S.
food and medical aid to the war-torn area.
McCloskey's reasoning is that additional aid is necessary
to tide the Nol government over until the rainy season starts
At that point, McCloskey says, residents of the Phnom Penh
perimeter area will have a chance to escape behind enemy
lines and escape killing by the Communists.
We seriously doubt that such a bloodbath could possibly
be averted by an extension of war. It is ridiculous for
McCloskey to argue that, since killing will take place at the
end of the war, killing should be allowed to continue for
several more months.
We are sorry that McCloskey is taking a stand so
contradictory to the positions he took on the Vietnam War.
