# Prisons Need Vast Reforms

Second. Of Two Parts
". . . one can only wonder at a penal system which
purports to protect and connect, does neither, and
then avoids innovation at all costs." (From the
Editor, Criminal Law Bulletin, September, 1974.)
There are gross disparities in our penal system
between objectives and results. Theoretically a just
system of punishment, deterrence, incapacitation,
and rehabilitation, prisons spawn discrimination,
exploitation, manipulation, and denegration. One
basic cause of this disparity is the indeterminate
sentence and the California Adult Authority; the
•system's basic underpinning of discretion.
Discretion assumes an ability to help a person
rehabilitate. One cannot teach or help someone
while one punishes or disables him. Second, crimes
are committed for economic, political, and social
more than psychological reasons. Psychological
help will not alter these factors. The system should
pay attention to the crime and not the criminal.
To eliminate the problems of discretion in
sentencing certain changes in the statutory
structure must be made.
—First, all sentencing, term fixing, releasing,
discharging, and revoking of releases should be
done by trial court judges subject to law and to
standards, guidelines, and review. This would
eliminate the Adult Authority, and require due
process of the law in all proceedings.
Once in prison, a convict would serve time for
his crime, not for his failure to mold himself to the
Adult Authority's model. He would be out of prison
at a specified time, and he would be spared the
brutal uncertainty of a whimsical sentencing
procedure.
—Second, the sentencing structure should be
revised by the legislature so that all offenses should
be classified into a limited number of categories.
This would eliminate disparities in sentences for

crimes of a similar nature. Sentences should be
short; the average time in prison should decrease
significantly. Good time credits should be given,
offering prisoners positive incentives for good
behavior. No sentence would be increased, except
for a conviction by the court for a new crime.
—Third, parole would be abolished. As it exists
today it extends the discretionary power of the
prison authorities beyond the prison gates by
imposing excessive behavioral guidelines in
violation of the parolee's civil rights. The parole
officer serves in a contradictory role of both
policeman and counselor, making the vital bond of
confidence and trust between ex-convict and parole
officer almost impossible.
—Finally, a state sentence review court would be
established as a special division of the present State
Court of Appeals. This would moderate local
sentencing excesses or injustices, eliminating gross
disparities in sentencing.
This plan, admittedly a rough outline, would
limit discretion in the imposition of criminal
sanctions. Judges would still retain sentencing
discretion, yet it would be between smaller bounds
and far shorter sentences.
A prisoner would not be enslaved by a system
denying him due process, brutalizing him with
uncertainty, coercing him to fit the Adult
Authority's model or serving time for his
personality and not his crime. The California state
legislature is now considering legislation to abolish
or modify the indiscriminate sentence. Your
legislator should know your views. Dostoevski
believed that a society's humanity is exposed in its
prisons. Our time to humanize is now.
