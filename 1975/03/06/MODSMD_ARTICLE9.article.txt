# FDR Assaulted Civil Liberties, Too
## 
### Bill Evers 
Now that many people are
sensitive to massive and
systematic violations of civil
liberties by the government as a
result of the revelations of the
Watergate affair, it is historically
instructive to look at similar
activities by administrations
before Richard Nixon's.
A new book by Wayne S. Cole
on * the opponents of U.S.
participation in World War II
details some quite questionable
actions taken by the Franklin
Roosevelt administration against

its anti-war political opponents.
Focusing on World War II is
especially important because this
period has been sanctified in
American popular mythology as a
period of righteous behavior by
the U.S. government.
In his effort to Suppress the
contemporary anti-war
movement, Roosevelt used
wiretapping, secret police
investigations by the FBI and
Secret Service of the
administration's enemies, and an
orchestrated campaign of
guilt-by-association.
On May 21, 1940, Roosevelt
authorized the Attorney General
"to secure information by
listening devices direct to the
conversation or other
communications of persons
suspected of subversive activities
against the Government of the
United States, including suspected
spies."
Security Excuse
This was the same "national
security" excuse for wiretapping
without a warrant that was still
being used by John Mitchell of
the Nixon regime in the 19705.
Governmental wiretapping should
not be permitted with a warrant
either, but it is even more
dangerous in the complete
absence of judicial scrutiny.
During the same month,
Roosevelt turned over to the
Secret Service all letters written to
him criticizing the government's
policy of using American warships
(in a period of supposed American
neutrality) to escort convoys
ferrying supplies to England. He
also turned over to the FBI many
telegrams criticizing his foreign
policy.
A final May achievement was
the establishment of an official
pro-war government propaganda
office. When Roosevelt appointed
New York Mayor Fiorello
LaGuardia as director of
the newly-created Office of
Civilian Defense, he explicitly
assigned LaGuardia the task of
attacking anti-war views.
In November 1941, Roosevelt
asked his Attorney General to
look into the feasibility of a

Grand Jury investigation of the
financial supporters of the
anti-interventionist America First
Committee.
During this period, White
House personnel and spokesmen

like Henry Wallace, Presidential
speechwriter Robert Sherwood,
and Interior Secretary Harold
Ickes called aviator Charles
Lindbergh, who was a major
anti-war leader — an "appeaser,"
and a "Nazi fellow traveler." At
Roosevelt's behest, administration
figures participated in a vicious
campaign of guilt by association
against Lindbergh.
Liberties Deprived
Lindbergh did not favor a
National Socialist dictatorship
either in Germany or in the
United States. He did not want
Germany to conquer either
Britain or the United States. He
believed that the Roosevelt
administration was depriving
Americans of their civil liberties
and acting with deception and
subterfuge in order to bring the
country into the war.
Historian Cole writes: "The
methods used by interventionists
in attacking Lindbergh in 1941
were fundamentally similar to
those used by McCarthyites in
attacking liberal internationalists
in the early 19505.
"The McCarthyites discredited
their adversaries by associating
them with Communist Russia;
interventionists discredited their
adversaries by associating them
with Nazi Germany. Those
' guilt-by-association -with-an
aggressive-totalitarian-power'
methods were effective in
destroying the careers and
reputations of liberal
internationalists in the 19505;

those same methods were even
more effective in destroying the
careers and reputations of
Lindbergh and other leading
isolationists in World War 11.
"Those methods, both in 1941
and 1951, were unfair, intolerant
— and effective. But they were
even more effective in 1941 than
in 1951.
"In the 19505, McCarthyites
were contesting with the so-called
'liberal internationalist
establishment,' which finally
triumphed over Senator Joseph
McCarthy and his followers....
In 1941, however, the 'liberal
internationalist establishment'
shared in the use of those
methods against the isolationists."
