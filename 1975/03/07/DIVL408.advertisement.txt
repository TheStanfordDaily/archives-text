Prestige PlOOB3
fi Gary Bartz stands out among jazz musicians — no one else
* can be so brilliant at times and so hopelessly mediocre at
£ others.
5 Although Singerella, which is billed as "A Ghetto Fairy
5: Tale," represents a novel Bartz does nothing
5 exceptionally interesting on the album. The worst thing about
5 this record is that Bartz has said this album represents a course
2 he would like to take in the future
r : Bartz, who performs with his five-man Ntu Troupe on this
8 album, plays a lot of things here: soprano sax, clarinet,
J harmonica, several electric keyboards and his best instrument,
S the alto sax.
Most of his time, though, is taken up with singing —
S something he does rather badly. He also wrote the lyrics and
j most of the music for the "fairy tale" operetta, and that just
5 goes to show that, try as he may, Bartz can't do every thing
2 musically.
The songs on this record are. as the title might imply, built
5 around a Cinderella theme set in Brooklyn's Bedford Stuyvesant
g ghetto. There are references to the black urban culture —in
8 "Dozens" and "Nation Time" — along with the simple "plot"
g of the operetta.
Singerella's songs are musically dull, though, except for \
5 "Lady Love," which owes a lot to Stevie Wonder. Stevie j
g Wonder influencing Gary Bartz? Guess who makes more )
$ money. j
£ None of the other Ntu Troupe players have much solo space )
g — they are far better represented on some earlier (and better) \
112 albums. Since this album has been constructed as a little opera, J
j6 it's a near-fatal flaw that there isn't more diversity of <
4 characters and moods represented in each song.
2 Hopefully this album won't turn people off to Bartz: his <
jj playing on McCoy Tyner's Soma layuca and Miles Davis' j
2 Live/Evil albums is absolutely stunning.
g Hopefully, too, the unconvincing results of Singerella won't )
* discourage the writing of a jazz opera, because there are jazz j
5 composers who could, I believe, give us the great American j
» opera. Singerella isn't it. |
