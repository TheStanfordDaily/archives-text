# Proposed Budget For 1975-76 Anticipates $1.9 Million Deficit
## 
### LAE KERSHNER 
The University's proposed operating
budget for next year, unveiled
yesterday, calls for a $4 million
belt-tightening but still anticipates a
$1.9 million deficit in 1975-76.
The budget, which administrators
discussed with the Faculty Senate and
student leaders yesterday, will be
considered by the Board of Trustees
on Tuesday.
Next year's operating budget totals
$87 million, compared with $79.8
million this year. Higher costs,
including average faculty and staff
salary increases of eight percent, a 55
percent jump in energy bills and a
large hike in financial aid account for
nearly all of the increase.
The $4 million cost reduction
includes $3.3 million in cutbacks and
$700,000 in new sources of revenue.
Originally, only a $2.5 million
belt-tightening was planned for
1975-76, but the goal was
"overachieved," according to Vice
Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti. In all, the
University plans to reduce costs by
$10 million during the next three
years.
Bacchetti noted that the University
grew until 1973-74, but that income in
constant dollars had dropped since
then, and that cutbacks are needed to
close this gap.
Biggest Cuts
Research, student services,
operations and maintenance, and
administration will all be cut a
disproportionate amount, while
instruction and libraries budgets will
be chopped relatively little.

Major cuts include reductions of
$430,000 in plant services, $201,000
in administrative data processing and
$172,000 in the President's and
Provost's Offices.
In all, 83 staff and 13 faculty
positions will be eliminated. While the
faculty reductions will be
accomplished through attrition, staff
layoffs are a near certainty.
Cuts in the instructional budget do
not include the elimination of SWOPSI
and SCIRE. The fate of these
programs is still up in the air, and
budget planners emphasized that they
are not the ones who will decide
whether to cut them.
Some of the cutbacks involve
shifting expenses from the general
operating budget to various auxiliary
funds, which provide specific services
on a break-even basis. For example,
the residence system, rather than the
University as a whole, will become
responsible for $150,000 in residence
counseling, according to the new
budget. .
Tuition Hike
While the operating budget will rise
by nine percent, tuition increases will
total 12.9 percent. Asked about this
by ASSU Vice President Ann Carter,
Provost William Miller said it "was not
a proper comparison," since income
from the endowment fund actually
will drop because of last year's stock
market nosedive.
The budget states that increases in
financial aid will "offset the
socio-economic bias that high cost
would otherwise invoke."
The budget calls for a $1.4 million

increase in financial aid, out of a total
"impact" of $2.1 million in added
expenses on the 45 percent of
undergraduates who receive financial
aid. The remaining $700,000 in
tuition, room and board increases will
be borne by students and their
parents.
The $1.9 million deficit requires the
University to reach back into its
pocket for money from prepaid land
leases which has previously been

invested. The University's six straight
budget deficits have all been funded
by the uncommitted unrestricted fund
balance, which in 1970 totalled $7.1
million.-That balance, currently only
$945,000, would be more than wiped
out by next year's deficit.
Neither the student leaders nor tne
Faculty Senate voiced any strong
objections to the 122-page budget,
which was submitted to them in
advance. Two faculty members did,
however, suggest methods of further
reducing the deficit.
Assoc. Medical Microbiology Prof.
Leon Rosenberg noted that the
projected budget includes over $1
million in increased energy, water and

sewer costs. He asked that the
University lobby with Pacific Gas and
Electric and the Public Utilities
Commission to reduce the rise in
energy rates. Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger said he would "follow
through" with the suggestion.
Human Biology Prof. Colin
Pittendrigh suggested that the
University consider raising its charge
on research grants to individual
departments and professors.
Pittendrigh said that other schools
charge more than Stanford's 47
percent.
Miller agreed that "47 percent is a
bit low," and said the University is
studying the matter.
