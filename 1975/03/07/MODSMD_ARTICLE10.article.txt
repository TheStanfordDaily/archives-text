# Chavez' Flunkies

What was the motive behind
the march of the United Farm
Workers Union (UFW) on the
Gallo estates? Cesar Chavez, UFW
leader, was one of the few to
understand the essence of the
march â€” a publicity stunt.
Although his ultimate goal was to
attract attention to the plight of
the farm laborers'poor working
conditions, Chavez unjustly
played on the ignorance and
emotions of his supporters.
Questioning marchers last
Saturday, we discovered they had
little or no knowledge of the
jurisdictional dispute involved.
Like marionnettes with Chavez
pulling the strings, the marchers
smiled at the words "United Farm
Workers" and scowled at the
mention of Gallo or Teamsters.
What motivated the marchers
to rally in Modesto Saturday? It
seemed that most of the marchers
participated because of a need to
be active in a crusade. Although
the goal of improving the farm
workers' conditions was genuine,
the procedure they chose in
achieving this goal was proven
unsuccessful.
The UFW is crumbling. George
Meany of the AFL-CIO has
renounced his support of Chavez'
boycott. The UFW's concern over
the farm workers' condition is
well founded, but misdirected.
There is a need for organization if
the UFW wants to become a
moving, respected force.
To victimize Gallo, which has
the best paid farm workers in the
country, is undermining its
cause. The UFW is fighting over
500 workers rather then directing
its efforts and funds to the
unionization of the 140,000
unaffiliated farmworkers in
California or the 2.2 million in the
United States. These other
workers earn only half of what
Gallo pays its workers.
The UFW claims Gallo is
opposed to "free elections." In
reality, Gallo is pressing for
legislation which would secure
"free elections," under the
supervision of a governmental
board. Only this way will the
elections be final and prevent
future boycotts.
The march to Modesto was
unfortunate. Chavez attracted
supporters with emotional
descriptions of the farm workers'
lot. Half-truths led marchers to
misunderstand their mission.
Many of the paraders were more
concerned with condemning an
institution of the establishment,
alias Gallo, rather then learning
the facts.
The sincerity of the marchers
has to be questioned when,
looking around Graceda Park,
bottles of Gallo wine were being
circulated. Now is the time to
look at the realistic facts.
