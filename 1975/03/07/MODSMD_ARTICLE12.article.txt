# Second Goldstein Defeat Raises Doubt
## Can Young People Be Elected? 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
This week's Palo Alto School Board
election pointed up the problems of young
people seeking political office.
Joshua Goldstein, 22, a Stanford political
science researcher, found that while many
older people would not vote for him even
though they agreed with him on the issues,
youthful potential supporters stayed away
fr>m the polls in droves.
Goldstein, who advocated neighborhood
schools and cutbacks in administrative costs,
lost to Jean Amick, a former PTA president.
Amick had supported greater citizen
participation in school board decision-making
and emphasized the need for more vocational
training.
By receiving nearly 40 percent of the vote
to Amick's 45 percent, Goldstein did
considerably better in this year's race than he
cud in a bid for a school board post last year,
when he received 82 percent of thfe vote.
Robert Taylor, a Los Altos school
principal, and June Genis, a libertarian
Stanford computer scientist, ran third and
fourth, respectively, this year.
Goldstein attributed his defeat largely to
his image as a bearded radical.
"A lot of people supported my ideas about
r schools, cutting the

administrative budget and opening schools for
community purposes so that they could
benefit people of all ages," Goldstein told the
Daily after his defeat. "But my image worked
against me."
Goldstein also noted that Amick was the
establishment candidate. She had the support
of most leading school officials in Palo Alto as
well as the endorsement of the Palo Alto
Times, which Goldstein called a "crucial
factor" in her victory.
Goldstein enlisted scores of student
volunteers to work for him, received the
Daily's endorsement and carried Stanford's
three student precincts by overwhelming
margins.
At Wilbur Hall, Goldstein won 87
percent of the vote and at the Bechtel Center
he received 79 percent. Graduate students at
Escondido Village gave him 81 percent of
their votes.
But only 20 percent of the students
registered to vote on the Stanford campus
appeared at the polls on election day.
According to Goldstein, if a large majority of
students had voted and supported him as
strongly as those who did vote, he would
probably have won the election.
Goldstein noted that the small turnout at

Stanford occurred together with an extremely
large turnout in what he called conservative
districts.
Despite his defeat, Goldstein said that if he
ran again, he would not try to change his
image or stress different issues. He noted,
however, that he would attempt to meet more
people.
After his second consecutive defeat,
Goldstein says he does not plan to run again
for the school board although he will continue
to work in Palo Alto's alternative school and
teach in a child care cooperative.
