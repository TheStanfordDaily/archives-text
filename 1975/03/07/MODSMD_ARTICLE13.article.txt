# Need A Lift Around Campus? Try Dial-A-Ride Or A Shuttle

A few well-informed people here have been
quietly taking advantage of a unique public
transportation system which most of we
ignorant souls didn't even know existed.
Slowly, the word has leaked out that,
despite a contrary indication from its maps,
Santa Clara County's Dial-A-Ride bus service
is available throughout the entire Stanford
a r ea.
In fact, many Medical Center employees
and other alert University staffers have been
taking advantage of the demand-responsive
service to commute to and from work each
day ever since the inauguration of Dial-A-Ride
last fall.
Perhaps the low visibility of this broad
service is responsible for the small number of
riders on each campus run (only three or
fo-ir). ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
ho,)es to remedy the low ridership level by
instituting what he calls "scheduled standing
requests" to Dial-A-Ride.
Under Mayer's plan, which takes effect
next quarter, the ASSU will coordinate a
regularly scheduled bus route on campus. The
plan is aimed at increasing ridership as well as
boosting efficiency.
Mayer's proposal will be implemented as
s >n as the ASSU can organize a sufficient
volunteer staff to receive, coordinate and
transmit service requests. In essence, the
volunteers will act as liaisons between
Dial-A-Ride and groups whose service requests

are similar enough to be accommodated by a
single pick-up.
This week brought another bit of good
news for campus residents who lack personal
transportation. The Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs announced plans to introduce
an experimental night shuttle bus service next
quarter. Principally because of an uncertain
demand for the service, it will operate on a
trial basis for its first three weeks.
Free, econo-van-style vehicles, manned by
volunteer and salaried drivers, will operate
once an hour between 8:30 p.m. and 12:30
a.m. along an arterial route.
"Shuttle bus service is directly related to
students' interest in it," commented Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Dale Snape, alluding
to both the student pressure which secured
the service and the patronage needed to
sustain it.
Organizers of the shuttle bus service hope
to reduce their projected budget of $800 by
relying heavily upon volunteer drivers. Alpha
Phi Omega, a campus service fraternity, has
already pledged several volunteers from
among its membership.
One group which lauded the announcement
of the shuttle service was the Ad Hoc
Committee for Safety on Campus, a
recently-formed group which has proposed
safety measures such as lighted walkways and
a nighttime escort service, in addition to the
shuttle buses.
