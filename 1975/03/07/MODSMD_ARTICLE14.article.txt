# Residents Weigh Feasibility, Equity Of Flo Mo Construction Compensation Plans
## 
### RICHARD CHONG 
Florence Moore Hall representatives met
recently to discuss possible forms of
compensation for the inconvenience they
believe they are suffering from construction
of 100 new living spaces at the dorm.
The Flo Mo committee on the construction
problem is now evaluating responses to a
survey conducted among dorm residents on
precisely what sort of compensation plan they
favor most.
The major problem that still remains is

deciding upon a plan which is both feasible
and equitable.
The Housing Office has offered three
compensation plans, but all three involve the
notion of moving students out of the dorms.
Many Flo Mo residents believe these solutions
are feasible, but not equitable.
A compensation proposal drafted by Mirlo
house residents alleges that Flo Mo residents
are suffering "a material dimunition of the
living experience." But if a large number of
residents must vacate Flo Mo, the residents
believe that those remaining would suffer a

similar "dimunition," losing the friendship
and group cohesiveness which has developed
in the last six months.
When the Housing Office first announced
its compensation alternatives, many of the
residents opposed them because of peer
pressure to remain in their dorms. One
house spokesman reported that seven or eight
persons had originally decided to leave, but
stayed in the house to be with close friends.
The residents' committee requested that the
Housing Office guarantee them housing space
in this spring's draw, or rebate a portion of
their room payment, or give residents a choice
between the two alternatives.
Many students living outside Flo Mo
complain that the idea of guaranteed housing
is not fair compensation. They contend that it
would diminish their own chances for
placement in the draw.
Also, a guaranteed housing plan would not
benefit graduating seniors living in Flo Mo.
They would remain uncompensated for the
inconviences of the construction project.
A modified form of guaranteed housing,
suggested by some representatives at the Flo
Mo committee meeting last Thursday night,
would grant higher priority in the draw to
present Ho Mo residents. The representatives
cited this as a more equitable proposal.
However, the Housing Office has yet to decide
whether even this modified plan would be
feasible.
A second alternative offered by residents is
monetary compensation. Feasibility is now
the basic problem. The Housing Office has not
decided if it would offer rebates, but seems
reluctant to do so because of the University's
precarious financial situation.
Monetary compensation, however, would
alleviate the problem which the guaranteed
housing plan would not, by compensating
non-returning students.
The plan which the Flo Mo committee
currently seems to favor involves a
combination of the two alternatives. They
hope to work out a suitable solution with
housing officials in the near future.

persons had originally decided to leave, but
stayed in the house to be with close friends.
The residents' committee requested that the
Housing Office guarantee them housing space
in this spring's draw, or rebate a portion of
their room payment, or give residents a choice
between the two alternatives.
Many students living outside Flo Mo
complain that the idea of guaranteed housing
is not fair compensation. They contend that it
would diminish their own chances for
placement in the draw.
Also, a guaranteed housing plan would not
benefit graduating seniors living in Flo Mo.
They would remain uncompensated for the
inconviences of the construction project.
A modified form of guaranteed housing,
suggested by some representatives at the Flo
Mo committee meeting last Thursday night,
would grant higher priority in the draw to
present Ho Mo residents. The representatives
cited this as a more equitable proposal.
However, the Housing Office has yet to decide
whether even this modified plan would be
feasible.
A second alternative offered by residents is
monetary compensation. Feasibility is now
the basic problem. The Housing Office has not
decided if it would offer rebates, but seems
reluctant to do so because of the University's
precarious financial situation.
Monetary compensation, however, would
alleviate the problem which the guaranteed
housing plan would not, by compensating
non-returning students.
The plan which the Flo Mo committee
currently seems to favor involves a
combination of the two alternatives. They
hope to work out a suitable solution with
housing officials in the near future.

HOW TO COMPENSATE — Two Florence Moore Hall residents, Rubin Griego and Linda
Bernhard, examine the rubble left in the wake of the preliminary stages of construction of
100 new housing spaces at the dorm.
Florence Moore Hall representatives met
recently to discuss possible forms of
compensation for the inconvenience they
believe they are suffering from construction
of 100 new living spaces at the dorm.
The Flo Mo committee on the construction
problem is now evaluating responses to a
survey conducted among dorm residents on
precisely what sort of compensation plan they
favor most.
The major problem that still remains is

deciding upon a plan which is both feasible
and equitable.
The Housing Office has offered three
compensation plans, but all three involve the
notion of moving students out of the dorms.
Many Flo Mo residents believe these solutions
are feasible, but not equitable.
A compensation proposal drafted by Mirlo
house residents alleges that Flo Mo residents
are suffering "a material dimunition of the
living experience." But if a large number of
residents must vacate Flo Mo, the residents
believe that those remaining would suffer a

similar "dimunition," losing the friendship
and group cohesiveness which has developed
in the last six months.
When the Housing Office first announced
its compensation alternatives, many of the
residents opposed them because of peer
pressure to remain in their dorms. One
house spokesman reported that seven or eight
persons had originally decided to leave, but
stayed in the house to be with close friends.
