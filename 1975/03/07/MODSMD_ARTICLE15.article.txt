# Dumbarton Bridge Proposal Sparks Controversy
## 
### CHRIS VALADA 
Recent public meetings to
discuss the proposed replacement
for the 47-year-old Dumbarton
Bridge have given rise to severe
criticism of the new structure.
Donald H. Gleason, spokesman
for the Citizens Against

Dumbarton Bridge (CADB), hopes
this portends a victory for his
organization.
The proposed structure will be
a six-lane, high rise bridge. The
Coast Guard is expected to
announce within six weeks
whether it will permit

construction.
Gleason noted considerably
more opposition to the new
structure than expected at a
meeting in Fremont, usually
considered a stronghold for those
favoring the new bridge. Most of
the 12,000 commuters who use

the Dumbarton daily travel from
the East Bay to jobs in the West
Bay, he explained.
According to Gleason, the
Coast Guard and the Army Corps
of Engineers are the only
government agencies involved in
the Bridge project. He thinks
others should enter the picture.
Many of the new structure's
supporters stress that such an
undertaking would help ease
unemployment in the building
trades. Unemployment in that
area has reached 32 percent,
claimed Robert Gilmore, business
manager for the San Mateo
County Building Trades Council.
TBA Supports It
The California Toll Bridge
Administration (TBA) also
supports the new bridge. The
environmental impact statement
cites traffic safety as "the primary
purpose" of a t.ew Dumbarton
Bridge.
Gleason, however, called this
issue a "red herring." He charged
that from 1966 to 1972, "the
overall accident rate per million
vehicle miles of the Dumbarton
Bridge was more than 20 percent
lower than weighted averages of
all other State toll bridges."
CADB fears that a new bridge
would damage land near the Bay
which has been earmarked for a
new national wildlife refuge.

Gleason added. But the state has
promised to acquire "some other
property" for the purpose.
Price Tag High
The bridge's estimated $93.7
million price-tag would come
from bonds secured by the
revenues from the San Mateo and
Bay Bridges. The TBA will be able
to contribute little if any capital,
because other transit districts have
been pressuring that agency to
distribute more of its surplus
revenue for improvement of
public transportation. The TBA
made over $18 million last year.
Furthermore, both CADB and
the city of Palo Alto have
brought lawsuits against the TBA
proposal The Palo Alto suit is
based on the defeat of a ballot
initiative in 1972 which would
have provided for a "southern
crossing" north of the San Mateo
Bridge and south of the Bay
Bridge.
The CADB has nroposed an
alternative to tin TBA plan, said
Gleason. His organization
supports "modernization of the
present structure to increase
safety, and establishment of
better access roads." He added
that this plan would specifically
address problems of congestion
and of safety on the bridge
approaches.
Gleason also asserted that since
the Dumbarton would not be
widened, traffic would not
increase greatly, which, he
claimed, would be more
consistent with energy
conservation programs.

STACKED DECK?—WeII, not exactly, although the game is Bridge. Some proposed changes in the
Dumbarton have drawn criticism from many of the players. But the bidding isn't quite over.
