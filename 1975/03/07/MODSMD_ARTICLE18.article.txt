# Live Off Campus? Well, Relax!

### MARTHA ADAMS 
Students living off campus will
at last have an on-campus refuge
next quarter. A lounge for
off-campus students, located in
Room 248 of Tresidder Union,
will make its debut with an all-day
open house next quarter.
Accordingto its sponsors, the
lounge will: 1) be a meeting place
on campus for relaxation,
studying and social interaction; 2)
have lockers for storage of books
and stuff; and 3) be a center to
plan and initiate social activities
that on-campus people have
through their houses.
Lianne Collins, a student
member of the Committee on the
Off-Campus Lounge, said many
people have difficulty adjusting to
off campus living because "they
don't have the social
atmosphere."

"What we're trying to do,
really, is simulate the residential
situation for off-campus
students;" she explained. "It has
to do with the sense of
belonging."
With the assistance of SCIRE
Director Alice Supton, two
transfer students submitted a
proposal to the SCIRE program
board last quarter. The SCIRE
Innovation Fund responded with
$400.
Student-Staff Position
The Dean of Student Affairs'
Office gave an additional to cover
the operating costs the remainder
of this year.
Proposals have been made for
next year's funding, and, said
Collins, "if we can show that this
is successful in the spring and that
students are using it, I'm almost
positive we can get funding next

year."
Roger Thacker, Tresidder
program manager and member of
the Off-Campus Lounge
Committee, agreed. "We'd have to
reallocate some money, but if it's
a successful program and there's a
real need for it demonstrated, the
odds are pretty good that it will
get funding for next year," he
explained.
Moved Thing's Around
Thacker currently works in the
room that will soon become the
off-campus lounge. "We had to
move some offices around and
double some people up to get
room, but we thought it was
worth it to give it a shot," he said.
Geophysics Prof. Allan Cox, a
member of the Committee on
Services to Students and one of
the original organizers of the
Off-Campus Lounge Committee,
said, "It suddenly occurred to me
that we're doing a heck of a lot
for people in the dorms and
nothing at all for students off
campus."
He explained that each quarter
money is taken out of tuition and
put into the General Fund to be
used for residential living.
According to Assistant Dean of
Students David Bell $25 of each
undergraduate's tuition goes to

"residential living" each quarter.
Cox admitted that he doesn't
expect the off-campus lounge to
receive a proportional amount,
but said he hoped the lounge
could still produce "more lively
students from off campus."
"All off-campus people," can
use the lounge, stressed Gary
Zinik, another student member of
the committee.
Supton pointed out that, "The
new housing policy indicates that
incoming students may have to
spend one of their four years off
campus."

at last have an on-campus refuge
next quarter. A lounge for
off-campus students, located in
Room 248 of Tresidder Union,
will make its debut with an all-day
open house next quarter.
Accordingto its sponsors, the
lounge will: 1) be a meeting place
on campus for relaxation,
studying and social interaction; 2)
have lockers for storage of books
and stuff; and 3) be a center to
plan and initiate social activities
that on-campus people have
through their houses.
Lianne Collins, a student
member of the Committee on the
Off-Campus Lounge, said many
people have difficulty adjusting to
off campus living because "they
don't have the social
atmosphere."

"What we're trying to do,
really, is simulate the residential
situation for off-campus
students;" she explained. "It has
to do with the sense of
belonging."
With the assistance of SCIRE
Director Alice Supton, two
transfer students submitted a
proposal to the SCIRE program
board last quarter. The SCIRE
Innovation Fund responded with
$400.
Student-Staff Position
The Dean of Student Affairs'
Office gave an additional to cover
the operating costs the remainder
of this year.
Proposals have been made for
next year's funding, and, said
Collins, "if we can show that this
is successful in the spring and that
students are using it, I'm almost
positive we can get funding next

year."
Roger Thacker, Tresidder
program manager and member of
the Off-Campus Lounge
Committee, agreed. "We'd have to
reallocate some money, but if it's
a successful program and there's a
real need for it demonstrated, the
odds are pretty good that it will
get funding for next year," he
explained.
Moved Thing's Around
Thacker currently works in the
room that will soon become the
off-campus lounge. "We had to
move some offices around and
double some people up to get
room, but we thought it was
worth it to give it a shot," he said.
Geophysics Prof. Allan Cox, a
member of the Committee on
Services to Students and one of
the original organizers of the
Off-Campus Lounge Committee,
said, "It suddenly occurred to me
that we're doing a heck of a lot
for people in the dorms and
nothing at all for students off
campus."
He explained that each quarter
money is taken out of tuition and
put into the General Fund to be
used for residential living.
According to Assistant Dean of
Students David Bell $25 of each
undergraduate's tuition goes to

"residential living" each quarter.
Cox admitted that he doesn't
expect the off-campus lounge to
receive a proportional amount,
but said he hoped the lounge
could still produce "more lively
students from off campus."
"All off-campus people," can
use the lounge, stressed Gary
Zinik, another student member of
the committee.
Supton pointed out that, "The
new housing policy indicates that
incoming students may have to
spend one of their four years off
campus."
