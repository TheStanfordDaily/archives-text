The Industrial Engineering
Department ranked first in the
nation in a recent survey of
departments conducted by Prof.
William Biles of Notre Dame
University.
Biles sent surveys to
department chairman of seventeen
schools "reputed to have sound IE
graduate programs," asking them
to rank schools other than their
own. Stanford's department
received a composite 4.63 rating.
Cornell and Michigan followed
with rankings of 5.31 and 5.33
respectively.
