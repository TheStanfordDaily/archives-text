# Children's Hospital: Proceed With Hope
## 
### PATRICK McCARTHY 
The cancer ward of a children's hospital may be a
depressing place. A sense of hopelessness, shared by
patients and staff alike, can pervade the atmosphere, leaving
one impression: kids come here to die.
But it doesn't have to be that way, insists a staff of
doctors, nurses and social workers at the
University-affiliated Children's Hospital at Stanford.
Under the direction of Dr. Jordan Wilbur and social
worker Joy Dutcher, the hospital has developed over the
past three years a revolutionary "Children With Cancer"
program that attempts, through a joint effort of patients,
parents and staff, to replace an air of mystery and
ignorance with one of security and hope.
"The expectation of impending death should be
changed." says Wilbur, director of the hospital's oncology
department. "As improved techniques of therapy are being
developed, our major effort should be devoted to the
achievement of long-term, good-quality survival.
"The patients, his family and the medical staff should all
be working cooperatively with one goal in mind:
eradication of the patient's disease."
Complete Honesty
The first step in achieving this cooperation, says Dutcher,
is complete honesty with both patients and parents. "Prom
the first day [the patients] come in we try to educate them
about what their disease means and what steps we will take
to manage it."
Adults and children then join with the hospital staff, says
Dutcher, and become a "team" that helps in the
"management of the illness." Patients, depending on their
age (the gamut at Stanford runs from five months to 19),
are present along with their parents at many of the doctors'
consultations and conferences, are free to examine all
records and are permitted to enter any part of the hospital
they want.
Also, blood counts are posted daily and patients and
parents are taught how to read them. Thus, when a child s

count is low, and painful treatment is required, both child
and adult expect it and know why it is being done.
Overnight Stays
Even more important in developing this team spirit,
however, is the hospital's extraordinary policy of allowing
parents to stay overnight with their children. At no
additional cost to patients, cots next to a child's bed are
provided for mothers and fathers and, in some cases, other
relatives.
Kitchen facilities also are available for parents to prepare
meals. This policy relieves parents, some of whom travel
from as far away as Oregon and Hawaii, of the burden and
expense of finding a place to stay.
In addition, some parents and relatives are taught how to
administer certain intravenous medications and how to
prepare children for examining procedures. They also are
encouraged to attend to such routine personal needs as
bathing patients and changing bed linen.
Continues Role
Explains Dr. Wilbur, "The parent continues to maintain
the role of managing the child's behavior and entertaining
the child, just as would be done at home. This approach
benefits the patient in terms of the care itself and assures
him that someone he trusts is looking after his interests."
Participation in therapy also helps parents adjust to their
child's illness. "If you sit in the hall and hear your child
scream, it is one thing," explains Dutcher. "But if you're in
the examining room with him you can see what's going on.
Even though it doesn't lessen your concern, it relieves some
of the anxiety."
Dutcher also emphasizes the comfort parents get from
each other. "Experienced parents take new parents under
their wings," she says. "Everybody has ups and downs and
others who are going through the same process are helpful
and supportive. They are simply much more tolerant of the
situation than most people."

When no relative or friend is available for a patient, the
hospital staff "adjusts."
The mother of Rachel, 7, for instance, is the sole support
of 11 other children and has to work at night. "It has been
arranged with her employer," says Dutcher, "that whenever
Rachel is upset she can call her mother at work."
Rachel's situation points up another feature of the
Stanford program. No child, however poor, is turned away.
If a child's parents have no money or insurance, the
hospital pays for his care by tapping funds provided by
several active women's auxiliaries. No distinction is made
between paying and non-paying patients.
Another way the hospital maintains a "normal life"
atmosphere is by requiring children to go to school. Four
fulltime teachers provided by the Palo Alto Unified School

District teach in classrooms adjacent to the hospital. If a
child is too ill to attend classes, a teacher will come to his
bedside.
Despite this "normal" atmosphere, however, many
children still die from cancer. Even though Dutcher
estimates that more than 50 percent of the Stanford
patients "survive" their illnesses, there is no attempt to hide
the other half.
"Death is dealt with honestly, openly and directly," she
insists. "We find that most people are not afraid of dying as
much as they are afraid of not knowing what is going to
happen to them, of being alone and of being in pain.
"That is where our program, and the few others like it in
the country, come in. We have none of the tip-toeing and
whispering that usually goes on. Of course, when a child
dies, the pain and sadness is always there. But at least here
it is a more peaceful and comfortable situation."

parents and staff, to replace an air of mystery and
ignorance with one of security and hope.
"The expectation of impending death should be
changed." says Wilbur, director of the hospital's oncology
department. "As improved techniques of therapy are being
developed, our major effort should be devoted to the
achievement of long-term, good-quality survival.
"The patients, his family and the medical staff should all
be working cooperatively with one goal in mind:
eradication of the patient's disease."
Complete Honesty
The first step in achieving this cooperation, says Dutcher,
is complete honesty with both patients and parents. "Prom
the first day [the patients] come in we try to educate them
about what their disease means and what steps we will take
to manage it."
Adults and children then join with the hospital staff, says
Dutcher, and become a "team" that helps in the
"management of the illness." Patients, depending on their
age (the gamut at Stanford runs from five months to 19),
are present along with their parents at many of the doctors'
consultations and conferences, are free to examine all
records and are permitted to enter any part of the hospital
they want.
Also, blood counts are posted daily and patients and
parents are taught how to read them. Thus, when a child s

count is low, and painful treatment is required, both child
and adult expect it and know why it is being done.
Overnight Stays
Even more important in developing this team spirit,
however, is the hospital's extraordinary policy of allowing
parents to stay overnight with their children. At no
additional cost to patients, cots next to a child's bed are
provided for mothers and fathers and, in some cases, other
relatives.
Kitchen facilities also are available for parents to prepare
meals. This policy relieves parents, some of whom travel
from as far away as Oregon and Hawaii, of the burden and
expense of finding a place to stay.
In addition, some parents and relatives are taught how to
administer certain intravenous medications and how to
prepare children for examining procedures. They also are
encouraged to attend to such routine personal needs as
bathing patients and changing bed linen.
Continues Role
Explains Dr. Wilbur, "The parent continues to maintain
the role of managing the child's behavior and entertaining
the child, just as would be done at home. This approach
benefits the patient in terms of the care itself and assures
him that someone he trusts is looking after his interests."
Participation in therapy also helps parents adjust to their
child's illness. "If you sit in the hall and hear your child
scream, it is one thing," explains Dutcher. "But if you're in
the examining room with him you can see what's going on.
Even though it doesn't lessen your concern, it relieves some
of the anxiety."
Dutcher also emphasizes the comfort parents get from
each other. "Experienced parents take new parents under
their wings," she says. "Everybody has ups and downs and
others who are going through the same process are helpful
and supportive. They are simply much more tolerant of the
situation than most people."

Children's Hospital tries to keep life normal. .. .
When no relative or friend is available for a patient, the
hospital staff "adjusts."
The mother of Rachel, 7, for instance, is the sole support
of 11 other children and has to work at night. "It has been
arranged with her employer," says Dutcher, "that whenever
Rachel is upset she can call her mother at work."
Rachel's situation points up another feature of the
Stanford program. No child, however poor, is turned away.
If a child's parents have no money or insurance, the
hospital pays for his care by tapping funds provided by
several active women's auxiliaries. No distinction is made
between paying and non-paying patients.
Another way the hospital maintains a "normal life"
atmosphere is by requiring children to go to school. Four
fulltime teachers provided by the Palo Alto Unified School

District teach in classrooms adjacent to the hospital. If a
child is too ill to attend classes, a teacher will come to his
bedside.
Despite this "normal" atmosphere, however, many
children still die from cancer. Even though Dutcher
estimates that more than 50 percent of the Stanford
patients "survive" their illnesses, there is no attempt to hide
the other half.
"Death is dealt with honestly, openly and directly," she
insists. "We find that most people are not afraid of dying as
much as they are afraid of not knowing what is going to
happen to them, of being alone and of being in pain.
"That is where our program, and the few others like it in
the country, come in. We have none of the tip-toeing and
whispering that usually goes on. Of course, when a child
dies, the pain and sadness is always there. But at least here
it is a more peaceful and comfortable situation."
The cancer ward of a children's hospital may be a
depressing place. A sense of hopelessness, shared by
patients and staff alike, can pervade the atmosphere, leaving
one impression: kids come here to die.
But it doesn't have to be that way, insists a staff of
doctors, nurses and social workers at the
University-affiliated Children's Hospital at Stanford.

is complete honesty with both patients and parents. "Prom
the first day [the patients] come in we try to educate them
about what their disease means and what steps we will take
to manage it."
Adults and children then join with the hospital staff, says
Dutcher, and become a "team" that helps in the
"management of the illness." Patients, depending on their
age (the gamut at Stanford runs from five months to 19),
are present along with their parents at many of the doctors'
consultations and conferences, are free to examine all
records and are permitted to enter any part of the hospital
they want.
Also, blood counts are posted daily and patients and
parents are taught how to read them. Thus, when a child s

count is low, and painful treatment is required, both child
and adult expect it and know why it is being done.
Overnight Stays
Even more important in developing this team spirit,
however, is the hospital's extraordinary policy of allowing
parents to stay overnight with their children. At no
additional cost to patients, cots next to a child's bed are
provided for mothers and fathers and, in some cases, other
relatives.
Kitchen facilities also are available for parents to prepare
meals. This policy relieves parents, some of whom travel
from as far away as Oregon and Hawaii, of the burden and
expense of finding a place to stay.
In addition, some parents and relatives are taught how to
administer certain intravenous medications and how to
prepare children for examining procedures. They also are
encouraged to attend to such routine personal needs as
bathing patients and changing bed linen.
Continues Role
Explains Dr. Wilbur, "The parent continues to maintain
the role of managing the child's behavior and entertaining
the child, just as would be done at home. This approach
benefits the patient in terms of the care itself and assures
him that someone he trusts is looking after his interests."
Participation in therapy also helps parents adjust to their
child's illness. "If you sit in the hall and hear your child
scream, it is one thing," explains Dutcher. "But if you're in
the examining room with him you can see what's going on.
Even though it doesn't lessen your concern, it relieves some
of the anxiety."
Dutcher also emphasizes the comfort parents get from
each other. "Experienced parents take new parents under
their wings," she says. "Everybody has ups and downs and
others who are going through the same process are helpful
and supportive. They are simply much more tolerant of the
situation than most people."

Children's Hospital tries to keep life normal. .. .
When no relative or friend is available for a patient, the
hospital staff "adjusts."
The mother of Rachel, 7, for instance, is the sole support
of 11 other children and has to work at night. "It has been
arranged with her employer," says Dutcher, "that whenever
Rachel is upset she can call her mother at work."
Rachel's situation points up another feature of the
Stanford program. No child, however poor, is turned away.
If a child's parents have no money or insurance, the
hospital pays for his care by tapping funds provided by
several active women's auxiliaries. No distinction is made
between paying and non-paying patients.
Another way the hospital maintains a "normal life"
atmosphere is by requiring children to go to school. Four
fulltime teachers provided by the Palo Alto Unified School

District teach in classrooms adjacent to the hospital. If a
child is too ill to attend classes, a teacher will come to his
bedside.
Despite this "normal" atmosphere, however, many
children still die from cancer. Even though Dutcher
estimates that more than 50 percent of the Stanford
patients "survive" their illnesses, there is no attempt to hide
the other half.
"Death is dealt with honestly, openly and directly," she
insists. "We find that most people are not afraid of dying as
much as they are afraid of not knowing what is going to
happen to them, of being alone and of being in pain.
"That is where our program, and the few others like it in
the country, come in. We have none of the tip-toeing and
whispering that usually goes on. Of course, when a child
dies, the pain and sadness is always there. But at least here
it is a more peaceful and comfortable situation."
The cancer ward of a children's hospital may be a
depressing place. A sense of hopelessness, shared by
patients and staff alike, can pervade the atmosphere, leaving
one impression: kids come here to die.
But it doesn't have to be that way, insists a staff of
doctors, nurses and social workers at the
University-affiliated Children's Hospital at Stanford.
Under the direction of Dr. Jordan Wilbur and social
worker Joy Dutcher, the hospital has developed over the
past three years a revolutionary "Children With Cancer"
program that attempts, through a joint effort of patients,
parents and staff, to replace an air of mystery and
ignorance with one of security and hope.
"The expectation of impending death should be
changed." says Wilbur, director of the hospital's oncology
department. "As improved techniques of therapy are being
developed, our major effort should be devoted to the
achievement of long-term, good-quality survival.
"The patients, his family and the medical staff should all
be working cooperatively with one goal in mind:
eradication of the patient's disease."
