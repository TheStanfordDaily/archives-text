## Movies: 'Report' Gets A Low Grade, Burt Returns 
### 
In Report To The
Commissioner we have the classic
case of the question, can a movie's
good points outweigh its flaws?
The answer here, regrettably, is
no. We have an award-winning
group of people coming out with
a movie that sometimes resembles
the pre-dress rehearsal confusion
of a high school play.
The report to the commissioner
covers the reasons for the murder
of a girl (Susan Blakely) who
turns out to be an undercover cop
on assignment, by an ignorant, as
well as stupid, detective (Michael
Moriarty), who is trailing her.
It moves in documentary
fashion, flashing back and forth
from the day of the murder
through the training and
orientation of Bo Lockley
(Moriarty), trying to clear up the
jumbled conglomeration of scenes
put forth in the beginning.
This maze is contrived to
heighten the suspense, but it
serves mostly to confuse because
of the frequent travels in time. In
its bumbling fashion, Report is a
third-rate Serpico, chronicling
corruption in high places and
showing ambition to be the root
of all evil.
Due to his superiors' wish to

lend credibility to Patty Butler's
(Blakely) appearance as a heroin
addict in love with a Manhattan
pusher (ex-football star Tony
King), Bo Lockley is put on her
trail after being told she is a
runaway.
Lockley is the film's major
flaw, but I don't think it is
Moriarty's fault. He portrays
Lockley well, but the detective is
so stupid that one wonders how in
the world he got out of junior
high school, much less onto the
police force — but after all that,
assigned as a detective? The film
does not say much for New
York's police department.
He has the motivation to be a
cop — his father was one — but he
doesn't have the intelligence. He
could probably bungle a parking
ticket. Thus, when the main
character is too unbelievable to
generate credibility, the picture
suffers.
Novel Take-Off
The screenplay, taken from the
James Mills novel and laden with
lines that are often meant to be
funny but never are, doesn't help
matters any. Then there's
Lockley's partner, "Crunch"
Blacksonne (played by Yaphet
Kotto of Live and Let Die), whose
best lines come when he

pronounces Lockley's first name,
Beauregard, various ways.
This is the high point of
Kotto's performance. Much of the
time he moves and spurts like a
robot — with as much expression
as one — with worn batteries.
Whoever told him he could act
must have been blind and deaf.
On the plus side we have the
people who, unfortunately, have
the smallest parts of the picture.
Susan Blakely, as the
conscientious woman who joined
the police force to have a job that
she "wouldn't know all about
after two weeks" and had the bad
luck to get in the way of the
moronic Lockley, shows great
potential and a much better
performance than her previous in
The Lords Of Flatbush and The
Towering Inferno.
King Tough
As her boyfriend, "Stick"
Henderson, Tony King has little
more to do than look tough while
the camera is down the street, but
he is very good in the climactic
elevator scene. He is saddled with
bad lines, though, and his
statement that "They is them and
we is us" may be the most
profound comment of the entire
movie.
Hector Klizondo, as the aspiring

police captain, does very well.
Also good as the Times Square
cripple is Robert Balaban
(Midnight Cowboy, Making It).
It is Baiaban who generates the
most excitement in the movie as
he trails Henderson as a favor
to Lockley, scooting down the
streets of New York on his
skateboard, propelling himself
with his hand grips.
Good Stunts
The excellent stunt work of
this scene is balanced by what is
supposed to be an exciting chase
between Lockley and Henderson.
The latter, to add novelty, sprints
half-naked into Saks Fifth
Avenue, in a scene that looks as
if the director told the chasers to
run through the store and knock
over all the props and people set
in the way.
The inconsistency shown in the
two chases is indicative of the
whole movie—partially good, but
more often terrible.
What makes Report To The
Commissioner an even sadder
experience is the realization of the
identities of its creators. It pales
in comparison to their other
achievements.
The movie is like two steps
forward and three steps back for
Abby Mann, who wrote Judgment
At Nuremberg, Ernest Tidyman,
who wrote Shaft and The French
Connection, Milton Katselas and
Mike Frankovich, who directed
and produced Butterflies Are
Free, and the entire New York
police department, who worked as
technical advisors (the most
famous member of them is Sonny
Grosso, Eddie Egan's partner,
whose exploits gave us The
French Connection).
Report To The Commissiooner
takes a grim look at the way New
York really is, but doesn't make
you care about it or believe it very
much.
—Howard Baldwin
("Report to the Commissioner" is
playing at the Aquarius Theatre in
Palo Alto, and over 20 other
theaters in the Bay Area.)
It is an old Hollywood tradition
and necessity to squeeze all the
profits possible out of a movie,
until all its potential appeal is
gone and there's nothing left to
draw customers. They will
probably be running Blazing
Saddles in some theater
somewhere until someone notices
the theaters where it's playing are
empty.
Also, it is provident to bring
out an old movie of a new star
that did not make the big time its

first time out, to capitalize on the
star's popularity. Which is why we
are being treated to a second swig
of Burt Reynolds' White
Lightning.
This is not a new Burt
Reynolds movie — his newest one
is W Wand the Dixie Dance kings,
with Art Carney. However, on the
success of The Longest Yard, they
have re-released this 1973 story of
a rum-runner in Tennessee, so
don't go expecting anything brand
new.
Something Happens
You can, on the other hand, go
and expect something
entertaining, because this, in
many respects, is like The Longest
Yard, a very popular movie. Burt
is up against the law (the man
simply does not get along with

anybody); specifically, he is going
after the corrupt sheriff who
murdered his brother (in a
particularly grisly scene starting
off the movie).
It's what Reynolds does best —
action with sparks of comedy and
violence thrown in for good
measure. Reynolds is not the
world's best actor, but, like
Robert Redford, he- has a
charisma that makes him
enjoyable to watch.
Some Funny Ones
White Lightning has a nice
assortment of funny lines, and the
car chase is one of the best in
terms of comedy (though nothing
will exceed What's Up, Doc?
As I remember, there was a plot,
but who takes note of those trivial
details in a Burt Reynolds movie?

Supporting Big Burt this time
around are Jennifer Billingsley,
Ned Beatty (also of Deliverance
and W.IV.), and Bo Hopkins (head
Pharaoh in American Graffiti).
This movie touched upon
vigilantism long before Magnum
Force or Death Wish. The
director, Joseph Sargent, who
most recently did The Taking Of
Pclham One Two Three, said
recently that he was disturbed
when audiences cheered the
demise of the sheriff, unsure
whether they were honoring the
death of the character or the law
(it was justifiable homicide, of
course, because the sheriff was a
very nasty person).
—H.B.
"White Lightning" is at the
Moffett Drive-In Theatre in
Mountain View.
