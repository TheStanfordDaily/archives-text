# Symphony Features Wind Soloists

SAN FRANCISCO - The San
Francisco Symphony is featuring
four of its own wind players as
soloists this week in Mozart's
Sinfonia Concertante in E Flat
Major, K.Anh.9.
The quartet, oboist Jean-Louis
Leßoux, clarinetist Philip Fath,
bassoonist Ryohei Nakagawa, and
hornist Arthur Krehbiel,

excellently performed this spirited
piece that exhibits the full
technical capabilities of each wind
player.
The oboist and clarinetist
played with good articulation and
smooth tone, and perfectly
gauged the scale runs and difficult
trills. The bassoonist played with
a deep, musical resonance, and the
hornist's clear, unflatering tone
highlighted much of the
performance.
The orchestra's performance of
Mozart's Symphony No. 4 in D
Major, K. 1 9, was marred by a lack
of life and spirit.
The musicians seemed to be
simply going through the motions
of performing this piece. The
strings were often sloppy and
uncaring in passages that demand
rhythmical precision, and bowings
lacked synchronization.
Part of the problem lies in the
piece itself. Composed when
Mozart was only nine years old,
the symphony is simplistic in
form and clearly shows the boy's
lack of musical sophistication and
maturity at the time.
As a complete change of
musical character, the orchestra
presented Prokofieff's

contemporary Classical
Symphony, Opus 25, and music
from the ballet Chout ("The
Buffoon"), Opus 21 bis.
The Classical Symphony is a
short, lighthearted and airy piece
that is a far cry from the typical
somber, serious music of many of
Prokofieff's Russian predecessors.
This Neo-classical piece involves
much contrapuntal material and
an open texture where many of
the instruments are blatant and
exposed. The Orchestra obviously
understood the piece, performing
with clear and accurate
intonation, perfectly timed
entrances and a transparent style
that illuminated each melodic
line.
The music from the ballet
Chout is much more of a typical
serious Russian nature but
Prokofieff's simply melodic lines
are the same. It is a satirical,
comical tale of amorality,
described in seven "dances."
The orchestra performed this
spirited work with vigor and zest.
The violins zipped effortlessly
through their fast passages, and
the horns had particularly good
"blubbery" tone that described
the antics of the buffoon.

line.
The music from the ballet
Chout is much more of a typical
serious Russian nature but
Prokofieff's simply melodic lines
are the same. It is a satirical,
comical tale of amorality,

The orchestra performed this
spirited work with vigor and zest.
The violins zipped effortlessly
through their fast passages, and
the horns had particularly good
"blubbery" tone that described
the antics of the buffoon.
SAN FRANCISCO - The San
Francisco Symphony is featuring
four of its own wind players as
soloists this week in Mozart's
Sinfonia Concertante in E Flat
Major, K.Anh.9.
The quartet, oboist Jean-Louis
Leßoux, clarinetist Philip Fath,
bassoonist Ryohei Nakagawa, and
hornist Arthur Krehbiel,

excellently performed this spirited
piece that exhibits the full
technical capabilities of each wind
player.
The oboist and clarinetist
played with good articulation and
smooth tone, and perfectly
gauged the scale runs and difficult
trills. The bassoonist played with
a deep, musical resonance, and the
hornist's clear, unflatering tone
highlighted much of the
performance.
The orchestra's performance of
Mozart's Symphony No. 4 in D
Major, K. 1 9, was marred by a lack
of life and spirit.
The musicians seemed to be
simply going through the motions
of performing this piece. The
strings were often sloppy and
uncaring in passages that demand
rhythmical precision, and bowings
lacked synchronization.
Part of the problem lies in the
piece itself. Composed when
Mozart was only nine years old,
the symphony is simplistic in
form and clearly shows the boy's
lack of musical sophistication and
maturity at the time.
As a complete change of
musical character, the orchestra
presented Prokofieff's

contemporary Classical
Symphony, Opus 25, and music
from the ballet Chout ("The
Buffoon"), Opus 21 bis.
The Classical Symphony is a
short, lighthearted and airy piece
that is a far cry from the typical
somber, serious music of many of
Prokofieff's Russian predecessors.
This Neo-classical piece involves
much contrapuntal material and
an open texture where many of
the instruments are blatant and
exposed. The Orchestra obviously
understood the piece, performing
with clear and accurate
intonation, perfectly timed
entrances and a transparent style
that illuminated each melodic
line.
