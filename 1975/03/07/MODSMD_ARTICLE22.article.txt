# 'Coppelia' Kicks Off Area Ballet Run
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
CUPERTINO—The American
Ballet Theater opened a run of
Bay Area performances Monday
night with an exhuberant version of
Coppelia that was alternately
amusing and amazing.
The amusement was generated
by staging that updated the
traditional Delibes ballet with
fresh comic touches. Rarely does
a ballet audience laugh more than
it applauds — but it almost
happened Monday night.
The story is set in a European
village several centuries ago. But
every performer — from the
principals to the corps — radiated
the kind of adventurous spirit one
might expect in Rodeo, but not in
a timeworn farytale ballet.
The opening set the tone for
the entire performance. The pit
orchestra, led by travelling ABT
conductor Alex Horvath,
delivered a full-bodied but slightly
speeded-up overture as the
curtains parted in mock-accident
to reveal the village peasants
unconsciously flirting with each
other.
Rowdy Abandon
The acceleration continued
during the mazurka, forcing the
dancers to rush just a bit. Instead
of detracting from the precision
of the corps, this created just the
right amount of rowdy
countrvesque abandon.
Besides that, ABT's Coppelia is
a ballet where a lot of things
happen. Only the third act
indulges in a series of bravado
solos and a sylphic number of the
corps called "dance of the hours."
The rest is pure action — rich in
comic nuances.
Versatile Veteran
lileanor D'Antuono, a versatile
ABT veteran, was a perfect
Swanhilda. In her opening solo,
she earned and then kept the
audience's admiration for her
solid technique. She proceeded to
prove that her ability as a
commedienne is equal to her skill
as a technician.
And she had a perfect partner
in Miami-born Fernando Bujone

ABT's youngest principal at 19.
Bujones, internationally acclaimed
for his technique as the American
answer to Rudolph Nureyev, also
has good looks and commanding
stage presence. He just might turn
out to be the Bjom Borg of the
ballet world.
Counterpoint
He and D'Antuono were
perfectly matched — not with
each other but against each other.
During a variation with her
friends, Swanhilda landed some
well-placed kicks to fight off
Franz's attempts to distract or
upstage her. But Bujones got a
chance to do much more than
play the flirt. Again and again his
leaps elicited awed "oohs" and
"aahs" from the audience.
At one point he literally
outleaped every other male dancer
in the ensemble — that's no small
feat considering that each of the
corpsmen could probably solo in
any decent company.
ABT's Coppelia is more than an
evening of exciting dancing. The
characters develop so well — due
as much to Enrique Martinez's
staging as to the performer's
talents — that the audience
actually gets involved with what
happens to them.
Character Balough
Buddy Balough, as the pathetic,
demented Dr. Coppelius, gave a
superlative character performance.
But so did the entire cast. Even
during the somewhat ostentatious
wedding scene in the third act, the
story continued to unfold on the
sidelines.
While Swanhilda danced, Franz
flirted with a beaming country girl
instead of watching his bride's
efforts. The townspeople strolled
on and off stage unself
consciously, not distracting from
the center stage dancers, but
adding atmosphere.

It was a fast-paced evening of
dance, but apparently not a tiring
one for the dancers or the
audience. D'Antuoao's part called
for more demanding solo work
than virtuallly any ballet this
reviewer can think of.
Two-Hour Toes
Two hours after she first
appeared on stage, she was still
amazing the audience with
virtuoso toe sequences, uncanny

control, and robot-like crispness
in the doll variations.
In fact, when it was all over,
everyone — both cast and viewers
— seemed ready and willing to do
it all again.
The same cast will do it again at
the War Memorial Opera House,
San Francisco, March 8. If you
can get tickets, don't miss it —
unless, of course, you're only
interested in Natalia Makarova.

evening of exciting dancing. The
characters develop so well — due
as much to Enrique Martinez's
staging as to the performer's
talents — that the audience
actually gets involved with what
happens to them.
Character Balough
Buddy Balough, as the pathetic,
demented Dr. Coppelius, gave a
superlative character performance.
But so did the entire cast. Even
during the somewhat ostentatious
wedding scene in the third act, the
story continued to unfold on the
sidelines.
While Swanhilda danced, Franz
flirted with a beaming country girl
instead of watching his bride's
efforts. The townspeople strolled
on and off stage unself
consciously, not distracting from
the center stage dancers, but
adding atmosphere.

It was a fast-paced evening of
dance, but apparently not a tiring
one for the dancers or the
audience. D'Antuoao's part called
for more demanding solo work
than virtuallly any ballet this
reviewer can think of.
Two-Hour Toes
Two hours after she first
appeared on stage, she was still
amazing the audience with
virtuoso toe sequences, uncanny

control, and robot-like crispness
in the doll variations.
In fact, when it was all over,
everyone — both cast and viewers
— seemed ready and willing to do
it all again.
The same cast will do it again at
the War Memorial Opera House,
San Francisco, March 8. If you
can get tickets, don't miss it —
unless, of course, you're only
interested in Natalia Makarova.

A LIVING DOLL—Eleanor D'Antuono dances the title role in the American Ballet Theatre's version of
"Coppelia." Reviewer Terry Anzur found the ballet "pure action, and rich in comic nuances."
CUPERTINO—The American
Ballet Theater opened a run of
Bay Area performances Monday
night with an exhuberant version of
Coppelia that was alternately
amusing and amazing.
The amusement was generated
by staging that updated the
traditional Delibes ballet with
fresh comic touches. Rarely does
a ballet audience laugh more than
it applauds — but it almost
happened Monday night.
The story is set in a European
village several centuries ago. But
every performer — from the
principals to the corps — radiated
the kind of adventurous spirit one
might expect in Rodeo, but not in
a timeworn farytale ballet.
The opening set the tone for
the entire performance. The pit
orchestra, led by travelling ABT
conductor Alex Horvath,
delivered a full-bodied but slightly
speeded-up overture as the
curtains parted in mock-accident
to reveal the village peasants
unconsciously flirting with each
other.
Rowdy Abandon
The acceleration continued
during the mazurka, forcing the
dancers to rush just a bit. Instead
of detracting from the precision
of the corps, this created just the
right amount of rowdy
countrvesque abandon.
Besides that, ABT's Coppelia is
a ballet where a lot of things
happen. Only the third act
indulges in a series of bravado
solos and a sylphic number of the
corps called "dance of the hours."
The rest is pure action — rich in
comic nuances.
Versatile Veteran
lileanor D'Antuono, a versatile
ABT veteran, was a perfect
Swanhilda. In her opening solo,
she earned and then kept the
audience's admiration for her
solid technique. She proceeded to
prove that her ability as a
commedienne is equal to her skill
as a technician.
And she had a perfect partner
in Miami-born Fernando Bujone

ABT's youngest principal at 19.
Bujones, internationally acclaimed
for his technique as the American
answer to Rudolph Nureyev, also
has good looks and commanding
stage presence. He just might turn
out to be the Bjom Borg of the
ballet world.
Counterpoint
He and D'Antuono were
perfectly matched — not with
each other but against each other.
During a variation with her
friends, Swanhilda landed some
well-placed kicks to fight off
Franz's attempts to distract or
upstage her. But Bujones got a
chance to do much more than
play the flirt. Again and again his
leaps elicited awed "oohs" and
"aahs" from the audience.
At one point he literally
outleaped every other male dancer
in the ensemble — that's no small
feat considering that each of the
corpsmen could probably solo in
any decent company.

speeded-up overture as the
curtains parted in mock-accident
to reveal the village peasants
unconsciously flirting with each
other.
Rowdy Abandon
The acceleration continued
during the mazurka, forcing the
dancers to rush just a bit. Instead
of detracting from the precision
of the corps, this created just the
right amount of rowdy
countrvesque abandon.
Besides that, ABT's Coppelia is
a ballet where a lot of things
happen. Only the third act
indulges in a series of bravado
solos and a sylphic number of the
corps called "dance of the hours."
The rest is pure action — rich in
comic nuances.
Versatile Veteran
lileanor D'Antuono, a versatile
ABT veteran, was a perfect
Swanhilda. In her opening solo,
she earned and then kept the
audience's admiration for her
solid technique. She proceeded to
prove that her ability as a
commedienne is equal to her skill
as a technician.
And she had a perfect partner
in Miami-born Fernando Bujone

ABT's youngest principal at 19.
Bujones, internationally acclaimed
for his technique as the American
answer to Rudolph Nureyev, also
has good looks and commanding
stage presence. He just might turn
out to be the Bjom Borg of the
ballet world.
Counterpoint
He and D'Antuono were
perfectly matched — not with
each other but against each other.
During a variation with her
friends, Swanhilda landed some
well-placed kicks to fight off
Franz's attempts to distract or
upstage her. But Bujones got a
chance to do much more than
play the flirt. Again and again his
leaps elicited awed "oohs" and
"aahs" from the audience.
At one point he literally
outleaped every other male dancer
in the ensemble — that's no small
feat considering that each of the
corpsmen could probably solo in
any decent company.
ABT's Coppelia is more than an
evening of exciting dancing. The
characters develop so well — due
as much to Enrique Martinez's
staging as to the performer's
talents — that the audience
actually gets involved with what
happens to them.
Character Balough
Buddy Balough, as the pathetic,
demented Dr. Coppelius, gave a
superlative character performance.
But so did the entire cast. Even
during the somewhat ostentatious
wedding scene in the third act, the
story continued to unfold on the
sidelines.
While Swanhilda danced, Franz
flirted with a beaming country girl
instead of watching his bride's
efforts. The townspeople strolled
on and off stage unself
consciously, not distracting from
the center stage dancers, but
adding atmosphere.

It was a fast-paced evening of
dance, but apparently not a tiring
one for the dancers or the
audience. D'Antuoao's part called
for more demanding solo work
than virtuallly any ballet this
reviewer can think of.
Two-Hour Toes
Two hours after she first
appeared on stage, she was still
amazing the audience with
virtuoso toe sequences, uncanny

control, and robot-like crispness
in the doll variations.
In fact, when it was all over,
everyone — both cast and viewers
— seemed ready and willing to do
it all again.
The same cast will do it again at
the War Memorial Opera House,
San Francisco, March 8. If you
can get tickets, don't miss it —
unless, of course, you're only
interested in Natalia Makarova.
