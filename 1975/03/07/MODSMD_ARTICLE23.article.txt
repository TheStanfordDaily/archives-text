# 'Stage Door' Takes A Look Backwards
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
Stage Door, a light comedy
written in the 1930s by Edna
Ferber and George Kaufman and
being performed at the Little
Theatre through Saturday, is the
kind of play my father would like
to see after a hard day at the
office.
The action moves quickly, the
characters are simple to the point
of being trite, and no mental
effort at all is required. It is just
plain good fun, enjoyable enough
at the moment but easily
forgettable.
Don't get me wrong. We all
need a little of that kind of
entertainment, if only as a study
break or a pleasant filler for an
empty evening. Although the play
sometimes falls short of its
intended comic effect, it is
guaranteed to provoke a few
giggles and lots of smiles.
Director Julie Steiny takes few
liberties in her interpretation of
the play. If she had, it might have
been better. Greater exaggeration
and parody might have heightened
the humor of material which,
played straightforwardly, is
outdated and hackneyed.

The setting is that good ol'
pre-women's lib era when those
rare females unwilling to become
small-town, bridge playing
housewives came to New York
City to make it big on Broadway.
Stage-struck and starry-eyed,
they lived in low-rent but
respectable boarding houses, like
Stage Door's Footlights Club, and
often had little in common but
their frustrated ambitions.
Kathy Lubar gives a fairly good
performance of the leading
character, Terry Randall, the
dedicated young actress
courageously struggling against
Broadway moguls who look for
sex appeal instead of acting
ability.
First Charming
Lu bar's forcefulness and
enthusiasm is, at first, charming,
then somewhat wearisome and
overdone. She seems to be trying
just a bit too hard.
James Cushman, playing the
successful movie producer who
recognizes Terry's talent, has the
opposite problem: he doesn't try
hard enough. He neither pokes
fun at his character nor takes him
seriously.
As a result, the sentimental
ending, which could be hilarious if
parodied almost tearful if not,
leaves the audience unbelieving,
untouched, and indifferent.
Huge Cast
But the cast is huge
(congratulations to Steiny for
organizing so many people in just
five weeks) and the success of the
play does not depend on any one
character. Kasey Arnold makes up
for Cushman's occasional lapses
with her excellent portrayal of the
tough-minded and worldly Judith,
who cuts men down to size with
her sarcastic wit.

Even some of the minor
characters, such as Mattie the
maid played by Anne Henkels, or
southern belle Bobby Melrose
played by Melissa Rick, are
handled deftly enough to
overshadow the few weaknesses in
the acting of the more important
roles. The play has no stars but
lots of good actresses.

Costumes are in true 1930s
style: long dresses and platform
shoes. Although they have no
nostalgic effect on those of us too
young to remember those bygone
days of the Depression, it is
interesting too see how the '70s
do have something in common
with the '30s, if only in clothes.

roles. The play has no stars but
lots of good actresses.

Costumes are in true 1930s
style: long dresses and platform
shoes. Although they have no
nostalgic effect on those of us too
young to remember those bygone
days of the Depression, it is
interesting too see how the '70s
do have something in common
with the '30s, if only in clothes.
Stage Door, a light comedy
written in the 1930s by Edna
Ferber and George Kaufman and
being performed at the Little
Theatre through Saturday, is the
kind of play my father would like
to see after a hard day at the
office.
The action moves quickly, the
characters are simple to the point
of being trite, and no mental
effort at all is required. It is just
plain good fun, enjoyable enough
at the moment but easily
forgettable.
Don't get me wrong. We all
need a little of that kind of
entertainment, if only as a study
break or a pleasant filler for an
empty evening. Although the play
sometimes falls short of its
intended comic effect, it is
guaranteed to provoke a few
giggles and lots of smiles.
Director Julie Steiny takes few
liberties in her interpretation of
the play. If she had, it might have
been better. Greater exaggeration
and parody might have heightened
the humor of material which,
played straightforwardly, is
outdated and hackneyed.

The setting is that good ol'
pre-women's lib era when those
rare females unwilling to become
small-town, bridge playing
housewives came to New York
City to make it big on Broadway.
Stage-struck and starry-eyed,
they lived in low-rent but
respectable boarding houses, like
Stage Door's Footlights Club, and
often had little in common but
their frustrated ambitions.
Kathy Lubar gives a fairly good
performance of the leading
character, Terry Randall, the
dedicated young actress
courageously struggling against
Broadway moguls who look for
sex appeal instead of acting
ability.
First Charming
Lu bar's forcefulness and
enthusiasm is, at first, charming,
then somewhat wearisome and
overdone. She seems to be trying
just a bit too hard.
James Cushman, playing the
successful movie producer who
recognizes Terry's talent, has the
opposite problem: he doesn't try
hard enough. He neither pokes
fun at his character nor takes him
seriously.
As a result, the sentimental
ending, which could be hilarious if
parodied almost tearful if not,
leaves the audience unbelieving,
untouched, and indifferent.
Huge Cast
But the cast is huge
(congratulations to Steiny for
organizing so many people in just
five weeks) and the success of the
play does not depend on any one
character. Kasey Arnold makes up
for Cushman's occasional lapses
with her excellent portrayal of the
tough-minded and worldly Judith,
who cuts men down to size with
her sarcastic wit.

Even some of the minor
characters, such as Mattie the
maid played by Anne Henkels, or
southern belle Bobby Melrose
played by Melissa Rick, are
handled deftly enough to
overshadow the few weaknesses in
the acting of the more important
roles. The play has no stars but
