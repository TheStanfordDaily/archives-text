## Spikers Set For Strong Spartans 
### CHRIS BAKER 
San Jose State track coach
Ernie Bullard did more than
enough traveling, hustling and
non-stop rapping to assure himself
of the best track and field squad
in Northern California. Now if
only he can introduce them to
each other, he'll be in great shape
for his 1975 dual meet opener
with Stanford tomorrow at 11:00
a.m. on San Jose's Bud Winter
Field.
Last year all he had was Pacific
Coast Athletic Association pole
vault king Dan Ripley, who,
vaulted 18-1 two months ago to
set a new world mark in the event.
But Bullard embarked on a
state-wide paper chase that
brought him intermediate hurdler
James Wyatt (52.9), long jumper
Dan Carter (25-6w) and sprinters
John McCollum (9.3) and Mel
Watson (9.5). And that's just for
openers.
Many people in "Speed City,"
including Bullard, feel that the
Spartans have the best team
they've had since John Smith
learned how to clench his fist in
the 1968 Olympics. "Winning is
the only thing. We were ranked
13th last season, but we plan to
be number one this year," said
Bullard. But the extroverted
third-year coach of the Spartans
and Stanford coach Payton
Jordan share different viewpoints
about tomorrow's meet.
Jordan told the Northern
California Track Writers Tuesday
that, "We plan to be competitive
against San Jose." Jordan didn't
say that he's looking for an upset
against the highly touted
Spartans, but he didn't say that in
1971 either, when Stanford pulled
off a 77-68 ambush.
Jordan's tracksters are coming
off an impressive 91-72 opening
win over Fresno State last
Saturday, in which 10 Cards set
new lifetime bests and two others
broke meet records.
"We can compete with the best
of them," said Jordan after the
meet. "Meeting a team of this
calibre brings out the best in any
athlete. We're looking forward to
Saturday's meet. We feel our kids

will compete better because they
know they're up against class
competition."
Class competition is right.
Bullard forsaw some 25-foot long
jumps in a field which pits
Stanford's James Lofton — who
last week leaped 23-s%—against
San Jose's Curtis Davis (25-10'/2w)
and Randy Bacon (24-6).
Marvin Holmes, a double
winner in the sprints for Stanford
last week, will have a tough job
running against McCollum and
Bruce Smiley, two of the nation's
top sprinters.
The Card mile relay quartet
which fell just 4.6 seconds short
of the Stanford record of 3:10.5
last week, will face its first real
test of the young season against a
San Jose squad that includes two
sub 47-second quartermilers.
And then there's Spartan triple
jumper Ron Livers, who last week
leaped 52-2'/2 to set a new school
record in the event. Livers also
had a wind-aided 53-3 3 /4. The
performance earned him NorCal
Track Athlete-of-the -Week
honors.
Pole vaulter Ripley, coming off
a shoulder injury last Saturday,
failed to clear his opening height
of 16-6 in last Saturday's "Small
College Meet," but Bullard isn't
worried. "HeHl be in the 17-foot
range tomorrow," said Bullard. So
Stanford pole vaulter Bob Flint
could get a chance to develop into
the 16-foot vaulter that Jordan
says hell become against such top
competition.
But don't write off Stanford
just yet. Although the Spartans
are deep in the sprints and jumps,
they share Stanford's lack of
depth in the weight events. "We
match up quite well with
Stanford," said Bullard. "We'll
only have one shotputter in the
meet, and they'll have two so
theyll pick up four points there."
According to San Francisco
State coach Jim Jones, whose
squad was decimated by San Jose
in last weekend's meet, an upset is
unlikely. "I can't see them losing
to anyone," said Jones. "They're
just wall-to-wall thick."
