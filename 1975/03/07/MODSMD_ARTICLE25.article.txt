## You're No Good

Picture the scene, if you will. Two weeks ago, at
Maples Pavilion, Stanford is locked in a 69-69 tie
with Oregon. One minute remains in the game and
the Cardinals have called timeout. As they return to
the floor, 6000 fans sit in stony silence.
Now, picture another scene. Last Friday, at
Pauley Pavilion, UCLA is trailing Cal 25-20 at the
half. As the Bruins return to the floor, 12,000 fans
rise to their feet for a lengthy ovation. Few sit
down again for the rest of the game.
The two incidents say something about Stanford
basketball fans â€” and what they say isn't good. The
Maples rooters are, without a doubt, the least
spirited and appreciative fans in the Pacific Eight.
They might be part of the reason why Stanford has
had such a miserable home record recently (13-8 in
the past two years).
The people who planned Maples Pavilion
certainly knew what they were doing when they
only installed 8000 seats in the arena. In fact, even
though Maples is the second smallest gym in the
league, one might even say that they should have
planned for fewer seats.
And that's because Stanford crowds, in addition
to being pathetically quiet, are usually pathetically
small, too. Last year, the Maples crowd averaged
under 6000 people per game. This season, the
average is barely over 5000 per game.
Compare that to Pauley, which never has more
than a few hundred of its 12,800 seats vacant for
any home game. Or how about McArthur Court at
Oregon, where there hasn't been an empty seat in
the house for years? Could that be why UCLA is
149-2 in Pauley, and why the Ducks have won 19
of their last 24 home games?
Most players will acknowledge that a large,
enthusiastically supportive crowd helps set a
positive tone for games. And that sort of tone can

be worth at least a point or two in a close contest.
Stanford fans proved that when the Cards managed
back-to-back upsets of UCLA and USC (by the
way, if you recall, neither game was a sellout).
It might be argued that Maples crowds are small
and silent because there isn't anything worth
coming to see or cheer about at a Stanford game.
Baloney.
A lot of fans at other schools would give up their
jockstraps to get a chance to see players like Rich
Kelley and Ed Schweitzer every other week. And
with the likes of Gus Williams, Dave Meyers and
Ron Lee showing up, it would be hard for them to
stay away. It hasn't proven too hard for Stanford
people.
Which brings us to the crux of the matter: what's
wrong with the sports fans here? The answer is
probably that they expect too much from their
teams.
Most Stanford people think they are outstanding
at whatever they do. So they think they have the
right to expect consistent excellence from all of
their peers. Unfortunately, athletic teams are apt to
meet a superior opponent once in awhile, or to get
a bad break from an official, or simply to have an
off night. They really can't control what happens
every time they go out to compete.
So how can Stanford people possibly expect the
Cards to win every time? If they do expect it,
though, it might behoove them to show up
8000-strong at every game to give the team a hand.
Tonight, four talented senior starters close out
their athletic careers at Stanford. A sellout crowd
really ought to be on hand to applaud Rich, Melvin,
Mark and Scott at every opportunity. But I'll take
odds that it won't even be close to a sell-out. Nuts
to you, too, fans!
