# Cagers In Non-Crucial Game
## 
### DAN PYNE 
For the first time in over a
month the Card Cagers Are Not
Facing A Crucial Weekend.
They're not really facing a
weekend at all. Just the end of a
season. And an era.
All that rests upon the outcome
of tonight's game is a .500 record
and a touch of pride. Card coach
Howie Dallmar indicates he will
pull no punches in tonight's game
with California; the Cards will go
for the win.
"Cal played an outstanding

game both offensively and
defensively in beating us earlier
this year," Dallmar said. "We
anticipate the same type of a
control game and the same style
of defense this time."
That style of control game is a
virtual offensive four-corner stall
that frustrated the Cards all
afternoon in Berkeley. And that
type of control game is a 3-2
collapsing zone defense that
clogged up the middle and that
Stanford could not break due to
poor outside shooting.
Ironically, Cal has a very quick
team with guards Connie White
and Rickie Hawthorne. The latter,
as someone so aptly put it, has
more moves than a can of worms.
At forwards the Bears start Carl
Bird and John Terry. At center is
6-9 Jay Young.

The Kelley era comes to an
end quietly, with no postseason
tournaments and no great fanfare.
Or, to put it in the subjunctive, it
might have been different, but it
wasn't.
