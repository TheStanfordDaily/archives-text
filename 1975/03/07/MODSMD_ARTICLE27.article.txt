Stanford's varsity fencing team made its finest showing ever in the
Western Intercollegiate Championships, concluded last weekend at
Chico State University. The Stanford swordsmen placed third overall
among the 20 participating schools.
The foil team captured the coveted team trophy, marking the first
time a Stanford team has won a Western Regional Championship. A
fourth place finish in Epee, and sixth by the sabre team insured third
place for the Card fencers.
The foil team was paced by team captain Jack Handy, who
finished the day with a 16-2 record. Other team members Maddy
Grose and Dennis Leybold maintained sufficient excellence to bring
home the team title; all three members reached the individual finals.
Grose saved his best for last, placing third individually after Handy
sustained a minor leg injury and finished sixth. Leybold showed great
potential in finishing ninth in his first year at the Westerns.
In the epee competition the team finished a somewhat erratic
fourth, beating the difficult schools, but losing to some lesser
adversaries to finish the day with a team record of 12-5. Stephen Walt

and Mark Eaton both qualified for
the finals, finishing fourth and
fifth respectively. Eaton, a senior,
will not be back next year, but
sophomore Walt returns for two
more tries at the individual title.
He will be joined by another
sophomore, Bob Wilder, who
showed great improvement and
poise in the team round.
The sabre team of Lee
Vanderveld, Chris Burke and
Dave Moyer placed a solid sixth,
with a 9-6 overall record.
