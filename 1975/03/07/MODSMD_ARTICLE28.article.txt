# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
It's the last week of the season
for our fearful forecaster, thank
heavens. No more waking up
Sunday morning and being moved
almost to tears by the realization
that Oregon beat Washington
State, or some such nonsense.
After two straight disastrous
weeks, we hit six of eight last time
to improve our season record to
40-19 (.6 78). If we can get all
four right this week, our final
percentage will be an even . 700.
But that's not easy. The
roughest game to pick is the one
here tonight. The way Stanford
has been playing, and the way Cal
lias been playing, there's no
question the Bears should win.
But this is the last game of the
bittersweet Rich Kelleyera (bitter
we didn't do better, but sweet
compared to what preceded and
what will likely follow it). We'll

go with the Auld Lang Syne boys.
UCLA plays at USC. The
Bruins know that a win will allow
them to win the Pacific Eight title
outright without a bothersome
playoff with Oregon State. That
ought to be enough. When UCLA
really wants to win, it does
(though Indiana will murder the
Bruins if the teams play in the
NCAAs).
Oregon State doesn't usually
beat Oregon in Eugene. But this
time, with a change for the league
title, we 'II bet the Beavers do it.
We'd like to say WSU will beat
Washington in its last chance to
get a league victory. But the
Cougars won't do it. Better luck
next time, Coach Raveling. .. .
