## Tough Cage Finals 
### PETE BHATIA 
To no one's surprise, top seeded
Seek and Destroy and third
seeded Phi Delts both scored
victories in the "A" IM semi-finals
Wednesday night to set up the
battle for the championship
scheduled for Sunday night at
9:30 in Maples Pavilion.
Seek and Destroy was not its
usual awesome self against the
Zetes as they fell behind early 6-2
because of a tight zone by the
Zetes. However, three long
bombers by Marty Moroski
seemed to ignite something under
S & D and they surged to a 21-15
haiftime bulge.
The second half was little
contest as Seek and Destroy
extended its margin for a 45-31
final tally. As always, S & D used
a balanced scoring attack with
Moroski's 10 the highest. Center
ivlike llenehan was next with nine,
followed by Mark Sweeney and
Steve Kristovich with six, George
Pettinger with five and Mark
Florant with four. Craig Johnson
led the Zetes with 12 and Jake
Warde added eight.
In the other semi, the Phi Delts
physically overpowered
outmanned SAE, who had upset
the second seeded Nickel Bag in
the quarters. The margin was
54-46. The E's had jumped to a
12-4 early lead with eight of their
points scored on twisting drives
by Bob Rondeau.
However, the Phi Delts roared
back on reserve Bob Oshetsky's
11 first half points to tie it at the
half, 23-all. In the second half, it
was all Phi Delt with center Mark
Hoaglin scoring 12 points from
close range to pace the Phi attack.
The Phi Delts lead ranged as high
as 16 before the SAE's made a
futile run in the final five minutes.
Oshetsky finished as the game's
high scorer with 15 while Hoaglin
added 14. Dave Tenn scored nine
for the Phi's and Kurt Peterson
added eight. Rondeau led SAE
with 16, while Steve Fulton
managed 10 and Scott Fulton
eight.
In "B" only seeded
learn to make the finals was sixth
seed Phi Chi. They beat the
Muthas 38-32 Wednesday night.

scoring Tom Sever, who had been
averaging 30 points a game in the
playoffs, was held to only 15
points oefore fouling out with
under a minute to play in the
game. For the Phi Chis, Bruce
