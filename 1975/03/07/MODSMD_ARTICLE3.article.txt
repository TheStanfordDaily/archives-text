# New Display Case Planned For Axe
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The Stanford Axe will be on display
again in a new case within two
months, according to Dale Snape,
assistant dean of student affairs.
A plan for the new display case has
been approved, Snape said, but
"exactly where it will be is
undetermined."
If the Tresidder Union wall on
which the present display case is
located is not removed as a result of
current negotiations on the future of
the Union, the new case will be built
there, Snape said.
The Axe is currently stored in the
Wells Fargo Bank vault "to prevent
our friends across the Bay from taking
it," said Sports Information Director
Gary Cavalli.
The present display case, in which a
picture of the Axe has been placed, is
neither good nor safe, Snape said.
"It's too hard to get things in and
out for display purposes," he

commented, "But it's very easy to
steal something."
A thief merely would have to break
the glass cover, Snape said, but for
anyone else "it would take one day to
get the thing out." The process would
involve the use of "special equipment"
to go behind the wall and undo some
hard-to-open locks, said Snape.
The new display case will cost about
$300, reported Claudia Temby,
chairman of the Axe Commission. The
plans for the case, drawn up by
alumnus Rick Miller, call for the
construction of two cases of
bulletproof plate glass, both rigged
with an alarm system.
Entrance into the case will involve
three or four different people together
to open 10 different locks, Temby
said.
The Bowman Alumni House has
promised the commission $100 for the
alarm system and Snape's office has
promised $250 for materials, Temby

added.
The Axe returned to the University
in November 1973, when a triad of
Theta Delta Chi members calling
themselves the "Infamous Three" stole
it from the Cal Rally Committee in a
skirmish in the parking lot of Ming's
Restaurant in Palo Alto. The Axe was
returned to Cal committee before the
1973 Big Game, but reverted to
Stanford once more when the Cardinal
football team won the game, 26-17.
The Infamous Three's goal had been
to increase the Axe's importance as a
symbol of the Stanford-Cal rivalry,
according to one of the three. They
also complained that the Axe was
rarely seen by Stanford students.
At the time, Axe Commission
members "said they were going to
propose an Axe case," Snape said.
Temby promised to take on the
project this year, said Snape. The plans
finally arrived at Snape's office two
weeks ago, he said.
