or around this time next year,"
Lambert said.

■ Russians to field an outstanding
i team.
1 "Many of their players were
members of the Russian national
water polo team that won the
Gold Medal in the 1972
Olympics," Lambert said.
"They'll be bringing the best
players they possibly can. They're
not just coming over to give an
exhibition. They want to win.
"This has to rank as one of the
best water polo events ever in
, Northern California and certainly
! one of the best ever in one
1 locale," Lambert continued. "Cal
, is a proven entity, and we're
( emerging as one of the top teams
. in the country."
