"STANFORD—Trinity University's top-ranked
tennis team will face what could bo one of
Stanford's best ever teams here [today] on the
Stanford varsity courts."—Stanford Sports
Information Office.
Wait a second, if that press release is right then
what happened to the Cards' three-and-a-Jialf week
rest, and why isn't the match being playod on April
11 like the schedule said it would be?
And why isn't there any mention of i\ T «J/vA
champ John Whitlinger (like there always is;, or
Nick Saviano or Dick Gould?
A second reading showed me where the mix-up
was. What the release actually says and I should
have seen was, "Trinity University's top ranked
women's tennis team. . .
And I guess that just points out the recognition
problem that the Stanford women's tennis team
has. Constantly overshadowed by the top men's
team in the nation and forced to cope with a small
budget, the women's team has almost been
forgotten at Stanford.
But it shouldn't be because the Stanford women's
tennis team is one of the most successful sports
squads on the campus.
The team opened their official season with a
second-place finish in the Tucson Invitational
behind the present national champion Arizona
State. Tuesday, the team trounced Cal 7-1 even
without its top three players.

And today the women take on three-time
national champion Trinity in a match which should
indicate just how strong Stanford is in team play
relative to a truly top-notch opponent.
Individually, Stanford's lineup is outstanding.
Playing first singles is "super frosh" Lele Forood,
the Tucson Invitational singles champion and a top
junior piayer.
At second singles will be sophomore Marcy
O'Keefe, the fifth-ranked junior player in the U.S.
in 1973. Andrea Barnes, a former NCIAC singles
champion, will be at third singles.
Rounding out the other singles slots are
freshman Joy Hahn at fourth singles, freshman
Nancy Rudd in the fifth spot and sophomore
Nancy Anderson at sixth singles.
The doubles teams are slated to be:
Forood-O'Keefe, Hahn-Barnes and Rudd-Anderson.
For the Trinity "Tigerettes,", every player who
helped win the national championship for Trinity
in 1973 and took them to the runner-up spot last
year is back. Added to that impressive quartet are
two outstanding freshmen, Sandy Stap and
Stephanie Tolleson, both of whom will probably
play among the top four singles spots.
So for the women's tennis team, the match with
Trinity will be a chance to step out of the shadow
of the men's team, and prove to some tennis fans
that the men's team doesn't have a monopoly on
top-quality tennis here on the Farm.

national champion Trinity in a match which should
indicate just how strong Stanford is in team play
relative to a truly top-notch opponent.
Individually, Stanford's lineup is outstanding.
Playing first singles is "super frosh" Lele Forood,
the Tucson Invitational singles champion and a top
junior piayer.
At second singles will be sophomore Marcy
O'Keefe, the fifth-ranked junior player in the U.S.
in 1973. Andrea Barnes, a former NCIAC singles
champion, will be at third singles.
Rounding out the other singles slots are
freshman Joy Hahn at fourth singles, freshman
Nancy Rudd in the fifth spot and sophomore
Nancy Anderson at sixth singles.
The doubles teams are slated to be:
Forood-O'Keefe, Hahn-Barnes and Rudd-Anderson.
For the Trinity "Tigerettes,", every player who
helped win the national championship for Trinity
in 1973 and took them to the runner-up spot last
year is back. Added to that impressive quartet are
two outstanding freshmen, Sandy Stap and
Stephanie Tolleson, both of whom will probably
play among the top four singles spots.
So for the women's tennis team, the match with
Trinity will be a chance to step out of the shadow
of the men's team, and prove to some tennis fans
that the men's team doesn't have a monopoly on
top-quality tennis here on the Farm.

"STANFORD—Trinity University's top-ranked
tennis team will face what could bo one of
Stanford's best ever teams here [today] on the
Stanford varsity courts."—Stanford Sports
Information Office.
Wait a second, if that press release is right then
what happened to the Cards' three-and-a-Jialf week
rest, and why isn't the match being playod on April
11 like the schedule said it would be?
And why isn't there any mention of i\ T «J/vA
champ John Whitlinger (like there always is;, or
Nick Saviano or Dick Gould?
A second reading showed me where the mix-up
was. What the release actually says and I should
have seen was, "Trinity University's top ranked
women's tennis team. . .
And I guess that just points out the recognition
problem that the Stanford women's tennis team
has. Constantly overshadowed by the top men's
team in the nation and forced to cope with a small
budget, the women's team has almost been
forgotten at Stanford.
But it shouldn't be because the Stanford women's
tennis team is one of the most successful sports
squads on the campus.
The team opened their official season with a
second-place finish in the Tucson Invitational
behind the present national champion Arizona
State. Tuesday, the team trounced Cal 7-1 even
without its top three players.

And today the women take on three-time
national champion Trinity in a match which should
indicate just how strong Stanford is in team play
relative to a truly top-notch opponent.
