## Indoor Soccer A Menace?? 
### Dan Pyne 
America is always messing up world sports
with inane ideas like World Team Tennis.
Tennis isn't exciting enough as it is, you
see. It's un-American. It needs popcorn
sellers and beer and shouting and cursing and
the "old team effort" or it isn't tuned to the
American spectator. After all, a sport isn't a
sport unless it's a team sport like football.
Professional sports promoters claim that,
through such mutations, they're only trying
to "spice up the game" a little. Make it more
viewable for the average American.
Right. So the Denver Racquets, last year's
WTT champion, are being moved to Phoenix
because they couldn't draw enough support
from the 1.2 million local average Americans.
Let's hear it for Billie Jean King.
Move It Indoors
And now there's indoor soccer, an
offshoot of regular soccer that looks like
something your little brother Clyde thought
up on a rainy Saturday afternoon. It's a
pretty silly game for the soccer purist. But
unlike World Team Tennis, World Team
Boxing and World Team Golf, the case
against indoor soccer is not cut and dried. It's
merely a dangerous development.
American professional soccer has shown in
the past few years that there really is a
market in the United States for a game in
which a bunch of guys in long socks and

shorts kick a spotted ball around a sort of
football field. Last year's North American
Soccer League attendance figures confirm it.
Ballan Campeau, Seattle Sounders
goalkeeper, says that NASL soccer has
reached about the level of good B-division
British soccer. Not bad for a country that
five years ago believed soccer was a game for
women's PE.
Admittedly many of the players are
foreign, which makes it difficult for a kid in
Dubuque to identify with a name like Mirko
Stojanovich. But players like Campeau and
Kyle Rote Jr.—home grown (so to speak)—are
making things a little more domestic.
Even advertisers are figuring out ways to
put in plugs for Gillette Foamy (regular or
new menthol-lime) into a game with few
natural interruptions.
Only Minor Adjustments
And the NASL has managed to keep its
hands off of the essence of the game so far,
making only minor adjustments like replacing
sudden-death overtime periods with
sudden-death penalty kicks and putting stars
on the dark squares on the ball.
Indoor soccer is not really a new
invention, either. Previously, it has been used
by foreign teams for conditioning and rainy
day practice. It is fast-paced, played with six
men to a side on Astro Turfed hockey rinks
with goals 16 feet wide and four feet high.

Spectators love it — the recent NASL
mini-tournament held at the Cow Palace
drew 9000-plus crowds. Which ain't bad.
Unfortunately, it may be getting too
popular. (Here's where the reader says "Oh
boy, this Pyne is really going off the deep
end now." The reader is probably correct.) It
would be very convenient to turn indoor
soccer into a sport by itself, especially in
light of its popularity. Not such a good idea.
Bad Blow
While indoor soccer is a good promotional
game and a good game for pre-season
conditioning, to develop an entire league
around it would be a heavy blow to regular
soccer. The NASL is not quite strong enough
to fiood the market with soccer yet.
It sounds pretty paranoid, but in a recent
Tex Maule Sports Illustrated article, Maule
implied that indoor soccer is a lot better than
"normal" soccer. Maule never liked soccer
much anyway. And he is the one who always
picks the Cowboys to win the Super Bowl.
But, he was right once.
Never underestimate Yankee ingenuity.
We're just pompous enough to try to be the
best in the world in everything, and if we
can't do it in soccer, why can't we change the
game?
But now I'm making mountains out of
molehills. I think.

see. It's un-American. It needs popcorn
sellers and beer and shouting and cursing and
the "old team effort" or it isn't tuned to the
American spectator. After all, a sport isn't a
sport unless it's a team sport like football.
Professional sports promoters claim that,
through such mutations, they're only trying
to "spice up the game" a little. Make it more
viewable for the average American.
Right. So the Denver Racquets, last year's
WTT champion, are being moved to Phoenix
because they couldn't draw enough support
from the 1.2 million local average Americans.
Let's hear it for Billie Jean King.
Move It Indoors
And now there's indoor soccer, an
offshoot of regular soccer that looks like
something your little brother Clyde thought
up on a rainy Saturday afternoon. It's a
pretty silly game for the soccer purist. But
unlike World Team Tennis, World Team
Boxing and World Team Golf, the case
against indoor soccer is not cut and dried. It's
merely a dangerous development.
American professional soccer has shown in
the past few years that there really is a
market in the United States for a game in
which a bunch of guys in long socks and

shorts kick a spotted ball around a sort of
football field. Last year's North American
Soccer League attendance figures confirm it.
Ballan Campeau, Seattle Sounders
goalkeeper, says that NASL soccer has
reached about the level of good B-division
British soccer. Not bad for a country that
five years ago believed soccer was a game for
women's PE.
Admittedly many of the players are
foreign, which makes it difficult for a kid in
Dubuque to identify with a name like Mirko
Stojanovich. But players like Campeau and
Kyle Rote Jr.—home grown (so to speak)—are
making things a little more domestic.
Even advertisers are figuring out ways to
put in plugs for Gillette Foamy (regular or
new menthol-lime) into a game with few
natural interruptions.
Only Minor Adjustments
And the NASL has managed to keep its
hands off of the essence of the game so far,
making only minor adjustments like replacing
sudden-death overtime periods with
sudden-death penalty kicks and putting stars
on the dark squares on the ball.
Indoor soccer is not really a new
invention, either. Previously, it has been used
by foreign teams for conditioning and rainy
day practice. It is fast-paced, played with six
men to a side on Astro Turfed hockey rinks
with goals 16 feet wide and four feet high.

Spectators love it — the recent NASL
mini-tournament held at the Cow Palace
drew 9000-plus crowds. Which ain't bad.
Unfortunately, it may be getting too
popular. (Here's where the reader says "Oh
boy, this Pyne is really going off the deep
end now." The reader is probably correct.) It
would be very convenient to turn indoor
soccer into a sport by itself, especially in
light of its popularity. Not such a good idea.
Bad Blow
While indoor soccer is a good promotional
game and a good game for pre-season
conditioning, to develop an entire league
around it would be a heavy blow to regular
soccer. The NASL is not quite strong enough
to fiood the market with soccer yet.
It sounds pretty paranoid, but in a recent
Tex Maule Sports Illustrated article, Maule
implied that indoor soccer is a lot better than
"normal" soccer. Maule never liked soccer
much anyway. And he is the one who always
picks the Cowboys to win the Super Bowl.
But, he was right once.
Never underestimate Yankee ingenuity.
We're just pompous enough to try to be the
best in the world in everything, and if we
can't do it in soccer, why can't we change the
game?
But now I'm making mountains out of
molehills. I think.

America is always messing up world sports
with inane ideas like World Team Tennis.
Tennis isn't exciting enough as it is, you
see. It's un-American. It needs popcorn
sellers and beer and shouting and cursing and
the "old team effort" or it isn't tuned to the
American spectator. After all, a sport isn't a
sport unless it's a team sport like football.
