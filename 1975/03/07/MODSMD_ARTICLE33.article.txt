Council Of Athletes
The Council of Athletes, a
group that hopes to increase
organized student input in
Athletic Department decisions,
will hold its first meeting Monday
night at 7:30 in Room 350,
Encina gym.
The council, an idea developed
by football player Drew Palin, has
no formal structure as yet. "I
don't want anybody to get the
idea that it's representing only
athletes on scholarship," Palin
said. "It's for anyone involved in
athletics — varsity, club,
intramurals or just people who
use the facilities.
"Right now it's just an idea,"
Palin said. "It can take any
direction the participants would
like it to."
The group is designed to
influence the three major
decision-making bodies within the
Athletic Department — the
Athletic Advisory Board; the
Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation
(CAPER); and the Buck Club
Advisory Board.
Palin said the group might also
make suggestions to the Pacific
Eight conference and the NCAA.
"The format, representation
and other details of the council
still have to be decided," said
Palin, who hopes the council can
insure that the athletic
department "be in touch with
student needs and interest."
Pac-8 Swimmers
"This isn't exactly the worst
conference for swimming in the
country," said one member of
Stanford's swim team before
leaving for the Pac-8
Championships in Los Angeles.
That's an understatement,
considering the fact that USC,
Stanford, UCLA and Washington
are all among the top six teams in
the nation (Indiana and Tennessee
round out the list). The three day
affair winds up tomorrow.
Last year the Cards took fourth
place despite early season dual
meet victories over UCLA and
Washington, evidence of the

relative unimportance of those
meets. Stanford has defeated
UCLA and lost to Washington this
season, while UCLA crushed
Washington. It is apparent, then,
that this meet can produce any
number of results.
There has been a great deal of
attention centered around several
of the Cardinal big guns, most
notably sprinter Dave Fairbank,
breastroker John Hencken and
distance-man Mike Bruner, all of
whom lead the nation in their
respective events.
But like Head Coach Jim
Gaughran, these swimmers are
looking ahead to the upcoming
NCAA meet in Cleveland. The real
story of this meet, it seems, will
revolve around many of the
Cardinal swimmers effort to
qualify for the NCAAs.
People like butterflyer Brian
Roux, and sprinters John Powell
and Marty Davis (both freshmen),
will be striving to shave mere
tenths of seconds off their times
in order to qualify, while others,
such as distance man Ron
Longinotti, will be more
concerned with lopping off severai
seconds.

Glovers Win
The Stanford baseball team
beat Cal State Hay ward yesterday.
6-3. The game was originally
scheduled for Wednesday, but was
rained out and replayed at
Hayward yesterday afternoon.
Bernie Hittner pitched seven
innings and allowed only one
earned run in picking up the win
for the Cards. Ray Cardinalli led
the Card battery with a triple and
two RBIs. Bob Hampton also
tripled in one run.
The Cards led 5-0 before
Hayward scored. The win raises
Stanford's record to 8-10.
Netters Get Rest
Following a hectic first three
weeks of the season, the Stanford
tennis team has no team play
scheduled for three-and-a-half
more weeks.
Yesterday's scheduled match

against Foothill College was
canceled due to rain, and that was
supposed to be the Cards' last
match before finals and the spring
break.
Although there won't be any
more team play until April 24,
individual team members will be
competing in tournaments all
across the country. This weekend,
coach Dick Gould has entered
three teams into the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships at La
Jolla.
The doubles tourney will give
Gould a chance to sharpen up the
team's overall playing. In singles
matches, the team has amassed a
35-1 wiri-loss record. But in
doubles, the record is a poor 11-7.
Entered as doubles pairs are
John Whitlinger-Pat DuPre, who
lost in the finals of this
tournament last year, Mark
Mitchell-Chip Fisher, and Bill
Maze-Craig Johnson.
Although Stanford has had
three doubles teams in recenl
finals of this tourney, no Card
pair has ever won the
championships.

Spartans Pass Putters
Four San Jose State players
fired one-over-par 72s yesterday
as the Spartans defeated Stanford
18-9 at Almaden Country Club.
The best the Cards could
manage was a pair of 73s by AJv
Trompas and Conrad Nilineier.
George Pettinger, returning to the
lineup after losing his starting spot
because of several class conflicts,
shot 74, while Jay Johnston shot
75, Dave Baskins 76 and Mike
Peck 77.
The Cards, now 3-1 for the
season, travel to Franklin Canyon
golf course in Berkeley today for
a match against California.
Tomorrow Baskins and Trompas
will compete in the third round of
match play in the San Francisco
City championships at Harding
Park.

manage was a pair of 73s by AJv
Trompas and Conrad Nilineier.
George Pettinger, returning to the
lineup after losing his starting spot
because of several class conflicts,
shot 74, while Jay Johnston shot
75, Dave Baskins 76 and Mike
Peck 77.
The Cards, now 3-1 for the
season, travel to Franklin Canyon
golf course in Berkeley today for
a match against California.
Tomorrow Baskins and Trompas
will compete in the third round of
match play in the San Francisco
City championships at Harding
Park.
Council Of Athletes
The Council of Athletes, a
group that hopes to increase
organized student input in
Athletic Department decisions,
will hold its first meeting Monday
night at 7:30 in Room 350,
Encina gym.
The council, an idea developed
by football player Drew Palin, has
no formal structure as yet. "I
don't want anybody to get the
idea that it's representing only
athletes on scholarship," Palin
said. "It's for anyone involved in
athletics — varsity, club,
intramurals or just people who
use the facilities.
"Right now it's just an idea,"
Palin said. "It can take any
direction the participants would
like it to."
The group is designed to
influence the three major
decision-making bodies within the
Athletic Department — the
Athletic Advisory Board; the
Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation
(CAPER); and the Buck Club
Advisory Board.
Palin said the group might also
make suggestions to the Pacific
Eight conference and the NCAA.
"The format, representation
and other details of the council
still have to be decided," said
Palin, who hopes the council can
insure that the athletic
department "be in touch with
student needs and interest."
Pac-8 Swimmers
"This isn't exactly the worst
conference for swimming in the
country," said one member of
Stanford's swim team before
leaving for the Pac-8
Championships in Los Angeles.
That's an understatement,
considering the fact that USC,
Stanford, UCLA and Washington
are all among the top six teams in
the nation (Indiana and Tennessee
round out the list). The three day
affair winds up tomorrow.
Last year the Cards took fourth
place despite early season dual
meet victories over UCLA and
Washington, evidence of the

relative unimportance of those
meets. Stanford has defeated
UCLA and lost to Washington this
season, while UCLA crushed
Washington. It is apparent, then,
that this meet can produce any
number of results.
There has been a great deal of
attention centered around several
of the Cardinal big guns, most
notably sprinter Dave Fairbank,
breastroker John Hencken and
distance-man Mike Bruner, all of
whom lead the nation in their
respective events.
But like Head Coach Jim
Gaughran, these swimmers are
looking ahead to the upcoming
NCAA meet in Cleveland. The real
story of this meet, it seems, will
revolve around many of the
Cardinal swimmers effort to
qualify for the NCAAs.
People like butterflyer Brian
Roux, and sprinters John Powell
and Marty Davis (both freshmen),
will be striving to shave mere
tenths of seconds off their times
in order to qualify, while others,
such as distance man Ron
Longinotti, will be more
concerned with lopping off severai
seconds.

Glovers Win
The Stanford baseball team
beat Cal State Hay ward yesterday.
6-3. The game was originally
scheduled for Wednesday, but was
rained out and replayed at
Hayward yesterday afternoon.
Bernie Hittner pitched seven
innings and allowed only one
earned run in picking up the win
for the Cards. Ray Cardinalli led
the Card battery with a triple and
two RBIs. Bob Hampton also
tripled in one run.
The Cards led 5-0 before
Hayward scored. The win raises
Stanford's record to 8-10.
Netters Get Rest
Following a hectic first three
weeks of the season, the Stanford
tennis team has no team play
scheduled for three-and-a-half
more weeks.
Yesterday's scheduled match

against Foothill College was
canceled due to rain, and that was
supposed to be the Cards' last
match before finals and the spring
break.
Although there won't be any
more team play until April 24,
individual team members will be
competing in tournaments all
across the country. This weekend,
coach Dick Gould has entered
three teams into the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships at La
Jolla.
The doubles tourney will give
Gould a chance to sharpen up the
team's overall playing. In singles
matches, the team has amassed a
35-1 wiri-loss record. But in
doubles, the record is a poor 11-7.
Entered as doubles pairs are
John Whitlinger-Pat DuPre, who
lost in the finals of this
tournament last year, Mark
Mitchell-Chip Fisher, and Bill
Maze-Craig Johnson.
Although Stanford has had
three doubles teams in recenl
finals of this tourney, no Card
pair has ever won the
championships.

doubles, the record is a poor 11-7.
Entered as doubles pairs are
John Whitlinger-Pat DuPre, who
lost in the finals of this
tournament last year, Mark
Mitchell-Chip Fisher, and Bill
Maze-Craig Johnson.
Although Stanford has had
three doubles teams in recenl
finals of this tourney, no Card
pair has ever won the
championships.

Spartans Pass Putters
Four San Jose State players
fired one-over-par 72s yesterday
as the Spartans defeated Stanford
18-9 at Almaden Country Club.
The best the Cards could
manage was a pair of 73s by AJv
Trompas and Conrad Nilineier.
George Pettinger, returning to the
lineup after losing his starting spot
because of several class conflicts,
shot 74, while Jay Johnston shot
75, Dave Baskins 76 and Mike
Peck 77.
The Cards, now 3-1 for the
season, travel to Franklin Canyon
golf course in Berkeley today for
a match against California.
Tomorrow Baskins and Trompas
will compete in the third round of
match play in the San Francisco
City championships at Harding
Park.
Council Of Athletes
The Council of Athletes, a
group that hopes to increase
organized student input in
Athletic Department decisions,
will hold its first meeting Monday
night at 7:30 in Room 350,
Encina gym.
The council, an idea developed
by football player Drew Palin, has
no formal structure as yet. "I
don't want anybody to get the
idea that it's representing only
athletes on scholarship," Palin
said. "It's for anyone involved in
athletics — varsity, club,
intramurals or just people who
use the facilities.
"Right now it's just an idea,"
Palin said. "It can take any
direction the participants would
like it to."
The group is designed to
influence the three major
decision-making bodies within the
Athletic Department — the
Athletic Advisory Board; the
Committee on Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation
(CAPER); and the Buck Club
Advisory Board.
Palin said the group might also
make suggestions to the Pacific
Eight conference and the NCAA.
"The format, representation
and other details of the council
still have to be decided," said
Palin, who hopes the council can
insure that the athletic
department "be in touch with
student needs and interest."
Pac-8 Swimmers
"This isn't exactly the worst
conference for swimming in the
country," said one member of
Stanford's swim team before
leaving for the Pac-8
Championships in Los Angeles.
That's an understatement,
considering the fact that USC,
Stanford, UCLA and Washington
are all among the top six teams in
the nation (Indiana and Tennessee
round out the list). The three day
affair winds up tomorrow.
Last year the Cards took fourth
place despite early season dual
meet victories over UCLA and
Washington, evidence of the

relative unimportance of those
meets. Stanford has defeated
UCLA and lost to Washington this
season, while UCLA crushed
Washington. It is apparent, then,
that this meet can produce any
number of results.
There has been a great deal of
attention centered around several
of the Cardinal big guns, most
notably sprinter Dave Fairbank,
breastroker John Hencken and
distance-man Mike Bruner, all of
whom lead the nation in their
respective events.
But like Head Coach Jim
Gaughran, these swimmers are
looking ahead to the upcoming
NCAA meet in Cleveland. The real
story of this meet, it seems, will
revolve around many of the
Cardinal swimmers effort to
qualify for the NCAAs.
People like butterflyer Brian
Roux, and sprinters John Powell
and Marty Davis (both freshmen),
will be striving to shave mere
tenths of seconds off their times
in order to qualify, while others,
such as distance man Ron
Longinotti, will be more
concerned with lopping off severai
seconds.

Glovers Win
The Stanford baseball team
beat Cal State Hay ward yesterday.
6-3. The game was originally
scheduled for Wednesday, but was
rained out and replayed at
Hayward yesterday afternoon.
Bernie Hittner pitched seven
innings and allowed only one
earned run in picking up the win
for the Cards. Ray Cardinalli led
the Card battery with a triple and
two RBIs. Bob Hampton also
tripled in one run.
The Cards led 5-0 before
Hayward scored. The win raises
Stanford's record to 8-10.
Netters Get Rest
Following a hectic first three
weeks of the season, the Stanford
tennis team has no team play
scheduled for three-and-a-half
more weeks.
Yesterday's scheduled match

against Foothill College was
canceled due to rain, and that was
supposed to be the Cards' last
match before finals and the spring
break.
Although there won't be any
more team play until April 24,
individual team members will be
competing in tournaments all
across the country. This weekend,
coach Dick Gould has entered
three teams into the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships at La
Jolla.
The doubles tourney will give
Gould a chance to sharpen up the
team's overall playing. In singles
matches, the team has amassed a
35-1 wiri-loss record. But in
doubles, the record is a poor 11-7.
Entered as doubles pairs are
John Whitlinger-Pat DuPre, who
