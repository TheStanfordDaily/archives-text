Ford: House Musi Vote Cambodian Aid
WASHINGTON — Declaring "time is running out,"
President Ford warned last night that Congress must vote
emergency military aid within two weeks if Cambodia is to
survive the current Communist offensive.
In a nationally televised news conference, Ford hinted
for the first time he was willing to see Lon Nol step aside as
Cambodia's president in order to spur negotiations and
end what he called "an unbelieveable horror story.
"If we don't give the aid, there is no hope" and
Cambodia would fall under Communist control, Ford said.
"If we do get the necessary legislation from Congress and it
comes quickly .. . within the next 10 days or two weeks I
believe there is a hope.. ."
The deteriorating situation in Cambodia, where the
capital of Phnom Penh is surrounded by Communist
insurgents, dominated Ford's news conference.
But the President also:
—questioned whether there had been any CIA
connection with attempted assassinations of foreign leaders,
but, citing current investigations into CIA activities, said
further comment from him at this time would be
inappropriate;
—questioned reports that conservative Republicans are
unhappy with his policies and may be considering starting a
third party. Ford said he felt his party should be "a
broad-based, wide-spectrum party" and could broaden its
base without losing its conservative wing, and declined to
comment on whether he would like to have former
President Richard Nixon take an active role in the
Republican party once he recovers from his physical
ailments. Ford said he felt it would be inappropriate for
him to comment at this time.
OPHC Off ers To Negotiate Oil Prices
ALGIERS — Heads of state in the oil cartel, ending their
first Summit, offered yesterday to negotiate conditions for
stabilizing oil prices but said the prices must be tied to the
cost of manufactured goods and services.
They also declared their readiness to assure oil supplies
for the industrialized countries and offered to provide them
with "financial facilities," but vowed to join forces to fight
economic or military aggression" directed against any
cartel member.
The three-day conference of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which Algerian
President Houari Roumedienne, the chairman, called "a
historic success," also provided the opportuntiy for Iran
and Iraq to sign an agreement resolving their long-standing
border conflict.
The OPEC summit ended with adoption of a declaration
to govern long-term relationships between the oil producers
and consumers. The document spoke of general principles
but did not say how they would be applied. OPEC leaders
decided to let experts meeting in Vienna work out details

later.
Terrorist Raid Threatens Mideast Fact
TEL AVIV — The Arab terrorist raid on a hotel here that
claimed 14 lives left Israel shaken and threatening revenge
yesterday and the fate of Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger's newest peace mission uncertain.
Speaking of the A 1 Fatah guerrilla movement headed by
Yasir Arafat, which claimed responsibility for the attack,
Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin said, "They will be
punished."
The implication was that Israel would stage a reprisal.
Seven Arab guerillas died in the hotel before dawn in an
inferno of gunfire and explosions that also killed four
hostages and three Israeli soldiers, the military command
said.
It said five soldiers and six civilians were wounded, and
that an eighth guerrilla was captured and saved from an
angry mob.
Israeli troops stormed the seaside Savoy Hotel in which
the Arab terrorists were holding about 10 hostages after the
guerrillas rejected an Israeli choice between unconditional
surrender or death, the command said.
Cabinet Member Criticizes Ford Plan
WASHINGTON — A member of President Ford's Cabinet
said yesterday that subsidizing jobs in state and local
governments is a basically inefficient way to spend federal
tax dollars to help the unemployed.
Both Ford and congressional Democrats are pressing for
extension of the present program.
The testimony of Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare Caspar W. Weinberger to the House Budget
Committee came one day after Ford's announcement that
he is seeking $1625 billion to extend some 310,000
"public service" jobs for six months.
Ford's announcement followed by one day
announcement by House Democratic leaders that a $5.9
billion special appropriation to stimulate employment
which they are trying to enact by the end of the month
contains $1625 billion for "public service" jobs.
Weinberger's testimony did not rule out "public service"
employment as a stopgap measure during times of high
joblessness.
But, when Rep. Patsy T. Mink (D-Hawaii) reminded him
it appears to be a program on which the administration and
Congress agree, Weinberger said:
"I suggest that, on a longer-range basis, it would be
preferable to have simple cash transfer programs,
automatically providing additional assistance during periods
of unemployment."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy with showers likely through tomorrow.
Lows in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in mid 50s to
low 60s.

Cabinet Member Criticizes Ford Plan
WASHINGTON — A member of President Ford's Cabinet
said yesterday that subsidizing jobs in state and local
governments is a basically inefficient way to spend federal
tax dollars to help the unemployed.
Both Ford and congressional Democrats are pressing for
extension of the present program.
The testimony of Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare Caspar W. Weinberger to the House Budget
Committee came one day after Ford's announcement that
he is seeking $1625 billion to extend some 310,000
"public service" jobs for six months.
Ford's announcement followed by one day
announcement by House Democratic leaders that a $5.9
billion special appropriation to stimulate employment
which they are trying to enact by the end of the month
contains $1625 billion for "public service" jobs.
Weinberger's testimony did not rule out "public service"
employment as a stopgap measure during times of high
joblessness.
But, when Rep. Patsy T. Mink (D-Hawaii) reminded him
it appears to be a program on which the administration and
Congress agree, Weinberger said:
"I suggest that, on a longer-range basis, it would be
preferable to have simple cash transfer programs,
automatically providing additional assistance during periods
of unemployment."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy with showers likely through tomorrow.
Lows in the 40s. Highs today and tomorrow in mid 50s to
low 60s.
Ford: House Musi Vote Cambodian Aid
WASHINGTON — Declaring "time is running out,"
President Ford warned last night that Congress must vote
emergency military aid within two weeks if Cambodia is to
survive the current Communist offensive.
In a nationally televised news conference, Ford hinted
for the first time he was willing to see Lon Nol step aside as
Cambodia's president in order to spur negotiations and
end what he called "an unbelieveable horror story.
"If we don't give the aid, there is no hope" and
Cambodia would fall under Communist control, Ford said.
"If we do get the necessary legislation from Congress and it
comes quickly .. . within the next 10 days or two weeks I
believe there is a hope.. ."
The deteriorating situation in Cambodia, where the
capital of Phnom Penh is surrounded by Communist
insurgents, dominated Ford's news conference.
But the President also:
—questioned whether there had been any CIA
connection with attempted assassinations of foreign leaders,
but, citing current investigations into CIA activities, said
further comment from him at this time would be
inappropriate;
—questioned reports that conservative Republicans are
unhappy with his policies and may be considering starting a
third party. Ford said he felt his party should be "a
broad-based, wide-spectrum party" and could broaden its
base without losing its conservative wing, and declined to
comment on whether he would like to have former
President Richard Nixon take an active role in the
Republican party once he recovers from his physical
ailments. Ford said he felt it would be inappropriate for
him to comment at this time.
OPHC Off ers To Negotiate Oil Prices
ALGIERS — Heads of state in the oil cartel, ending their
first Summit, offered yesterday to negotiate conditions for
stabilizing oil prices but said the prices must be tied to the
cost of manufactured goods and services.
They also declared their readiness to assure oil supplies
for the industrialized countries and offered to provide them
with "financial facilities," but vowed to join forces to fight
economic or military aggression" directed against any
cartel member.
The three-day conference of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which Algerian
President Houari Roumedienne, the chairman, called "a
historic success," also provided the opportuntiy for Iran
and Iraq to sign an agreement resolving their long-standing
border conflict.
The OPEC summit ended with adoption of a declaration
to govern long-term relationships between the oil producers
and consumers. The document spoke of general principles
but did not say how they would be applied. OPEC leaders
decided to let experts meeting in Vienna work out details

later.
Terrorist Raid Threatens Mideast Fact
TEL AVIV — The Arab terrorist raid on a hotel here that
claimed 14 lives left Israel shaken and threatening revenge
yesterday and the fate of Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger's newest peace mission uncertain.
Speaking of the A 1 Fatah guerrilla movement headed by
Yasir Arafat, which claimed responsibility for the attack,
Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin said, "They will be
punished."
The implication was that Israel would stage a reprisal.
Seven Arab guerillas died in the hotel before dawn in an
inferno of gunfire and explosions that also killed four
hostages and three Israeli soldiers, the military command
said.
It said five soldiers and six civilians were wounded, and
that an eighth guerrilla was captured and saved from an
angry mob.
Israeli troops stormed the seaside Savoy Hotel in which
the Arab terrorists were holding about 10 hostages after the
guerrillas rejected an Israeli choice between unconditional
surrender or death, the command said.

with "financial facilities," but vowed to join forces to fight
economic or military aggression" directed against any
cartel member.
The three-day conference of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which Algerian
President Houari Roumedienne, the chairman, called "a
historic success," also provided the opportuntiy for Iran
and Iraq to sign an agreement resolving their long-standing
border conflict.
The OPEC summit ended with adoption of a declaration
to govern long-term relationships between the oil producers
and consumers. The document spoke of general principles
but did not say how they would be applied. OPEC leaders
decided to let experts meeting in Vienna work out details

later.
Terrorist Raid Threatens Mideast Fact
TEL AVIV — The Arab terrorist raid on a hotel here that
claimed 14 lives left Israel shaken and threatening revenge
yesterday and the fate of Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger's newest peace mission uncertain.
Speaking of the A 1 Fatah guerrilla movement headed by
Yasir Arafat, which claimed responsibility for the attack,
Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin said, "They will be
punished."
The implication was that Israel would stage a reprisal.
Seven Arab guerillas died in the hotel before dawn in an
inferno of gunfire and explosions that also killed four
hostages and three Israeli soldiers, the military command
said.
It said five soldiers and six civilians were wounded, and
that an eighth guerrilla was captured and saved from an
angry mob.
Israeli troops stormed the seaside Savoy Hotel in which
the Arab terrorists were holding about 10 hostages after the
guerrillas rejected an Israeli choice between unconditional
surrender or death, the command said.
Cabinet Member Criticizes Ford Plan
WASHINGTON — A member of President Ford's Cabinet
said yesterday that subsidizing jobs in state and local
governments is a basically inefficient way to spend federal
tax dollars to help the unemployed.
Both Ford and congressional Democrats are pressing for
extension of the present program.
The testimony of Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare Caspar W. Weinberger to the House Budget
Committee came one day after Ford's announcement that
he is seeking $1625 billion to extend some 310,000
"public service" jobs for six months.
Ford's announcement followed by one day
announcement by House Democratic leaders that a $5.9
billion special appropriation to stimulate employment
which they are trying to enact by the end of the month
contains $1625 billion for "public service" jobs.
Weinberger's testimony did not rule out "public service"
employment as a stopgap measure during times of high
joblessness.
But, when Rep. Patsy T. Mink (D-Hawaii) reminded him
it appears to be a program on which the administration and
Congress agree, Weinberger said:
"I suggest that, on a longer-range basis, it would be
preferable to have simple cash transfer programs,
automatically providing additional assistance during periods
of unemployment."
