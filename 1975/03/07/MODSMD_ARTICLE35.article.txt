# $95,000 Painting Slashed
## 
### 
A valuable contemporary painting
was slashed shortly before noon
yesterday in the Stanford Museum.
The painting was "Prometheus
Bound," by Baurnett Newman, a
contemporary American artist who
died in 1970.
Officials declined to estimate the
value of the work, but Stanford Police
Captain Rauol Niemeyer said in a
KZSU interview that the painting was
worth about $95,000. Investigators
were told that the painting could be
repaired for a cost of several hundred
dollars. The painting is insured.

The painting is on loan from the
Museum of Modern Art in New York.
It is owned by William Rubin, curator
of painting and sculpture there.
The slash was discovered by a
museum employee soon after the last
of a series of regular morning school
tours had left the museum.
Stanford police and Santa Clara
County Sheriff's investigators reported
that the slash was eight to 10 inches
long, just inside the right-hand frame
of the painting. The painting measures
131 inches by 50 inches.
Museum officials could not be
reached for comment.
