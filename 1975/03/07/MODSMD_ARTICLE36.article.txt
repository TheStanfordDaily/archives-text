CORRECTION
Yesterday's story on the ASSU
Senate neglected to mention that the
Senate's resolution to withdraw
support of the motor vehicle
registration fee and to refrain from
further legal action against the
University is contingent upon "a
mutual agreement between the
administration and the ASSU Senate"
to resolve the parking problem by
arbitration.
The story also failed to mention
that the Senate voted 15-0 to place a
fee assessment to fund legal action on
the spring quarter ballot. If the
arbitration is successful, this
assessment will be automatically
dropped from the ballot.
