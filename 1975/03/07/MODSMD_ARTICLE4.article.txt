# C-US To Propose Stiffer Distribution Requirement
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The Committee of Undergraduati
Studies (C-US) will probablj
recommend early next quarter that tin
current University distributioi
requirement be made slightly les
flexible, some of its members disclose<
yesterday.
Students are currently required t<
take three courses of at least thre<
units each in the areas of humanitie;
and fine arts; social sciences; ant
mathematics, natural sciences ant
technology.
Under the C-US plan, the abovi
distribution would be maintained, bu
certain stipulations would limit th<
options within each area.
In the area of humanities, musit
performance, studio art, creativt
writing and first-year foreign languagt
courses could no longer be countec
toward the distribution requirement
Political Science Prof. Richarc
Brody, chairman of C-US, claimed thai
courses in the four areas "do not fulfil
the rationale of the humanities
requirement," which is to givt
students a general understanding ol
the works in the humanities and arts
'Weak Fit'
Brody said the Committee didn't
want to "denegrate" the skills involvec
in those areas, but noted that it fell
because only three courses wert
required there was a possibility of <
"weak fit between the rationale anc
the courses."
In the social sciences, the
Committee may propose that the three
courses be taken in at least two
different departments, and will suggest
but not require that the courses be
related to a common theme. Brody
said this was to emphasize breadth as
well as depth.
Students would no longer be
allowed to take only math courses to
fulfill the final third of the
requirement. One natural science or
technology course would thus be

mandatory.
Brody stated that "the
understanding of having studied the
natural processes" is "not fulfilled" by
the "straight use" of knowledge as in
mathematics.
'Common Theme'
The Committee may also propose
that the courses be "united with a
common theme" as an
interdepartmental, intradepartmental
or self-designed and approved series,
student member Lisa Lang said.
Student member Lee Rosenbaum
said that C-US would "probably be
recommending that each department"
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences establish an introductory
course in the field which would be
recommended for non-majors and
which would not require prerequisite
knowledge in that area.
Brody emphasized that it was
important that courses students used
to fulfill the requirements fit in with

the reasoning behind having such
requirements.
Approval Likely
Rosenbaum and Lang emphasized
that the proposed changes have not
been finalized, though approval by
C-US is likely.
Brody said there was a "quite strong
consensus on ihe Committee"
supporting the planned
recommendations.
Mathematics Prof. Karel DeLeeuw,
also a C-US member, agreed that the
committee would "most likely go
along with what we have so far."
Lang noted that the ne\y guides,
even if passed by the Committee and
the Faculty Senate early next quarter,
might not' be in effect next year. In
any case, she said, they would not
affect students currently enrolled.
Brody noted that most students fulfill
these more structured requirements
anyway.
