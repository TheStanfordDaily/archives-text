# PIRG Study Reveals Lending Violations
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Over 100 lenders in the Bay Area are in direct violation of the 1968 Federal
Truth-in-Lending Act, according to a study released yesterday by the Northern
California Public Interest Research Group (NorCal PIRG).
Based on research conducted by students at Stanford and Santa Clara
universities, the report cited 82 car dealers and 21 banks in San Francisco, Palo
Alto, San Jose and Stockton that it claimed had violated the law.
The Ralph Nader-inspired research and consumer advocacy group issued a call
to Governor Edmund Brown Jr., Attorney General Evelle Younger, the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) and other federal and state regulatory agencies "to
take remedial action against violators."
Allegations of law violations were based on telephone surveys done by
volunteer students "posing as prospective car buyers seeking loan-interest
information" and using a standardized survey form, according to the report.
The law, said the report, requires that all interest rates quoted by lenders be
expressed through one standard formula, known as the Annual Percentage Rate
(APR). Violators of that law allegedly quoted either both the APR and an
add-on rate, or the add-on rate alone. The add-on rate is an alternate wav of

expressing interest rates.
"Citing add-on or discount rates
instead of APR prevents credit
comparisons between lenders. Giving
other rates in combination with APR
may confuse most consumers who are
unfamiliar with technical terms. For
these reasons, [this practice] has been
outlawed," said Roger Telschow,
NorCal PIRG executive director.
A positive finding of the survey was
that all 19 San Jose banks that were
cited as violators in NorCal PIRG's
April 1974 survey are now in
compliance, according to the study.
Compiled during October through
February, the research was
coordinated at Stanford by
undergraduates Jeffrey Kimball and
Ann Lowery, under the supervision of
Telschow.
The PIRG report planned that 60
percent of all car dealers surveyed
were in violation, as compared to only
11 percent of all banks surveyed.
Telschow commented, "We are
appalled by the widespread use of
illegal add-on rates by car dealers, and
by the failure of some banks to stick
to the APR alone. It demonstrates the
near-total failure of federal and state
agencies to enforce consumer
protection laws."
NorCal PIRG operates mainly out
of Stanford and Santa Clara
universities, and is funded by an ASSU
fee assessment last autumn and a
similar assessment at Santa Clara,
together giving the group about
$20,000.
Telschow and another fulltime stall
member, Lee Jones, are both paid
from those funds, which include
$11,200 for salaries. The two staffers
are in charge of development and
supervision of projects, recruitment of
students, various paper work and other
administrative tasks.
The rest of the money, according to
the NorCal PIRG 1974-1975 budget
summary, goes toward such items as
telephones, postage, supplies, copying
fees and travel.
Kimball and Lowery, who
coordinated the recent surveying done
by Stanford students, were quick to
praise the dedication of Telschow and
Jones. "Telschow is a very efficient
organizer. He virtually eats and sleeps
on PIRG, spending about 70-80 hours
a week on it, as does Jones," said
Kimball.
According to Telschow, the
organization involves a "core" of
about 15 students, with "at least 30
others" working at some time on
assorted tasks.
Telschow delivered testimony last
year to the PTC in Washington
concerning a past PIRG study which
found that many car dealers in the Bay
Area were misquoting gas mileage
figures.

$20,000.
Telschow and another fulltime stall
member, Lee Jones, are both paid
from those funds, which include
$11,200 for salaries. The two staffers
are in charge of development and
supervision of projects, recruitment of
students, various paper work and other
administrative tasks.
The rest of the money, according to
the NorCal PIRG 1974-1975 budget
summary, goes toward such items as
telephones, postage, supplies, copying
fees and travel.
Kimball and Lowery, who
coordinated the recent surveying done
by Stanford students, were quick to
praise the dedication of Telschow and
Jones. "Telschow is a very efficient
organizer. He virtually eats and sleeps
on PIRG, spending about 70-80 hours
a week on it, as does Jones," said
Kimball.
According to Telschow, the
organization involves a "core" of
about 15 students, with "at least 30
others" working at some time on
assorted tasks.
Telschow delivered testimony last
year to the PTC in Washington
concerning a past PIRG study which
found that many car dealers in the Bay
Area were misquoting gas mileage
figures.
Over 100 lenders in the Bay Area are in direct violation of the 1968 Federal
Truth-in-Lending Act, according to a study released yesterday by the Northern
California Public Interest Research Group (NorCal PIRG).
Based on research conducted by students at Stanford and Santa Clara
universities, the report cited 82 car dealers and 21 banks in San Francisco, Palo
Alto, San Jose and Stockton that it claimed had violated the law.
The Ralph Nader-inspired research and consumer advocacy group issued a call
to Governor Edmund Brown Jr., Attorney General Evelle Younger, the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC) and other federal and state regulatory agencies "to
take remedial action against violators."
Allegations of law violations were based on telephone surveys done by
volunteer students "posing as prospective car buyers seeking loan-interest
information" and using a standardized survey form, according to the report.
The law, said the report, requires that all interest rates quoted by lenders be
expressed through one standard formula, known as the Annual Percentage Rate
(APR). Violators of that law allegedly quoted either both the APR and an
add-on rate, or the add-on rate alone. The add-on rate is an alternate wav of

expressing interest rates.
"Citing add-on or discount rates
instead of APR prevents credit
comparisons between lenders. Giving
other rates in combination with APR
may confuse most consumers who are
unfamiliar with technical terms. For
these reasons, [this practice] has been
outlawed," said Roger Telschow,
NorCal PIRG executive director.
A positive finding of the survey was
that all 19 San Jose banks that were
cited as violators in NorCal PIRG's
April 1974 survey are now in
compliance, according to the study.
Compiled during October through
February, the research was
coordinated at Stanford by
undergraduates Jeffrey Kimball and
Ann Lowery, under the supervision of
Telschow.
The PIRG report planned that 60
percent of all car dealers surveyed
were in violation, as compared to only
11 percent of all banks surveyed.
Telschow commented, "We are
appalled by the widespread use of
illegal add-on rates by car dealers, and
by the failure of some banks to stick
to the APR alone. It demonstrates the
near-total failure of federal and state
agencies to enforce consumer
protection laws."
NorCal PIRG operates mainly out
of Stanford and Santa Clara
universities, and is funded by an ASSU
fee assessment last autumn and a
similar assessment at Santa Clara,
together giving the group about
$20,000.
