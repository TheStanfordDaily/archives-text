Last spring, students voted a $12,000 fee assessment for
the ASSU Guest Professorship Board, so that it could bring
South Vietnamese journalist Nguyen Huu Thai to Stanford.
Thai has not been allowed to leave South Vietnam.
This winter, seeing that it couldn't get Thai, the board
selected Chilean engineer Herman Schwember for the guest
professorship.
Schwember has not been allowed to leave Chile.
The ASSU now plans to let the $12,000 sit in an account
for the remainder of the year, pending selection of a third
guest professor by next year's board.
We do not think this is fair to the students who paid $1 to
see Thai come to Stanford. This year's graduating class will
get exactly nothing for its dollars. By the time it is spent,
they will be gone.
It is not only the seniors who are suffering, however, since
the $1 was refundable only during autumn quarter, when it
was assessed.
At that time, many students may have elected not to get
their money back, since they thought Thai .would be
coming. Now Thai is not coming, but the money is forever
lost to the students.
We urge the ASSU to refund $1 to any student who paid
the fee for Thai autumn quarter and now wants his or her
money back. This would not be a difficult process, as
records are kept on which students have already gotten
refunds.
The money that is left over could be used for next year's
guest professor.
