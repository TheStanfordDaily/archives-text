# Fast On Food Day
## 
### 
Food is a pre-eminent political
issue in this country and around
the world. Citizens in the United
States are being assaulted by
ever-rising food prices while every
day at least 400 million persons
around the world go hungry.
America's failure to develop a
national food policy has never
been so keenly felt either at home
or abroad.
The worsening food crisis has
drawn consumer, poverty,
environmental, church, student
and' other public-interest groups
together to confront the problem
next'* April 17 â€” the day
designated as Food Day. Food
Day activities, including a fast,
will focus on three major themes:
the severity of the world food
shortage, rising prices at home,
and the declining quality of the
American diet and its effects on
the public's health.
The Food Service supports the
fast and will issue rebate money in
one lump sum to the Food Day
ASSU account on one condition:
a list of fasting students must be
given to the Food Service some
two weeks in advance of the fast,
Thus, the list will have to be
complete by the first week in
April. To accomplish this, Food
Day representatives will be
stationed at all Food Service lines
the first few days of spring
quarter. At those times, students
who wish to participate may sign
the lists.
The fast is totally voluntary,
and we hope that each student
will seriously consider fasting on
April 17. With the cooperation
and support of the Stanford
community, the fast can be very
effective. In far less inflationary
times, on Feb. 2, 1969, a
Stanford fast for the
Biafran/Nigerian Relief Fund
raised $1943.
Today, if half of the people
taking meals from the Food
Service were to participate in the
fast, more than $2250 would be
collected. Fraternities,
independent houses, eating clubs
and all other Stanford living
groups could, of course, add
significantly to the total sum.
Over the next few weeks,
representatives from the Stanford
Food Day Committee will be
talking to RAs in dorms affiliated
with the Food Service to solicit
support and supply more
information. In addition,
representatives will contact
independent houses, the eating
clubs and fraternities in an effort
to broaden participation in the
fast.
Students living in Mirrielees,
Escondido Village, Manzanita
Park, off campus, and all other
people in the Stanford
community are also urged to take
part in the fast. Those who wish
to contribute to the fund could
donate the money they would
have spent on food that day. For
this purpose, a "crop" table will
be set up in White Plaza on Food
Day.
Money donated to "crop" (not
an acronym) is distributed by
Church World Service, an agency
that is particularly effective both
in sending emergency food and
other aid to disaster victims on

five continents (including North
America), and in helping people in
Third World countries become
self-sufficient by sending them
tools, seeds, and fertilizer.
In 1970, America's wasteful
and destructive attitude toward
the environment led to the
creation of Earth Day. The
success of Earth Day stimulated
continuing conservative efforts.
Food Day will hopefully have a
similar effect, but massive
participation will again be
necessary to develop momentum.
Thus, Food Day needs everyone's
support. The fast is one way to
show such support.
