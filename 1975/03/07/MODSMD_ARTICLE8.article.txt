# Letters--More On Harter, UWP, Housing
## 
### 
Harter Is . . . (Part III)
Editor:
An item in Mike Tollin's latest
column (Daily, March 5) needs a
bit of clarification. Tollin said
Oregon basketball coach Dick
Harter "is not the kind of person
who would deliberately hurt or
abuse anyone."
That's just plain wrong. Each
year, Oregon and Oregon State
play each other three times. The
winner of this so-called "Civil War
Series" used to receive the
Chancellor's Trophy in
recognition of the achievement.
Last season, after Oregon State
had again clinched the series,
Beaver yell leader Rick Coutin
triumphantly bore the trophy
across court. As he passed the
Oregon bench, Coutin was tripped
by Harter and went crashing to
the floor. It didn't do Coutin, or
the trophy, any good.
So Chancellor Roy Lieuallen
has decided to retire the trophy.
Even though Tollin "can't imagine
Harter actually encouraging
on-court brutality," I guess
Lieuallen could. .

UWP Not Dead
Editor:
I take this opportunity to say
that one of the corpses lamented
at the mass Funeral for the Death
of Undergraduate Education on
Feb. 20 is not dead. The
Undergraduate Writing Program
(UWP) lives, and all mourners for
it can dry their eyes.
Its name has been changed to
Freshman English, but (if we are
talking about realities and not
names) virtually everything that
was ever offered under the tag of
the Undergraduate Writing
Program is still being offered.
This seems the appropriate
time to clear up certain other
confusions. The recent obsequies
would suggest that the UWP took
care of the major part of the
writing requirement for Stanford
undergraduates. It did not. It
never handled more than about 16
percent of the courses satisfying
the writing requirement. So all
that has happened is that the
English Department has

reabsorbed that 16 percent —
along with most of the good ideas
that the UWP developed.
There never was any serious
question that the English
Department would do this. I do
not understand why rumors still
circulate that we are not going to
do it.
It is a non-problem. There has
been no death (and will be no
dearth) of courses to meet the
writing requirement. And I like to
think that our program will be
better than ever next year. I
hope soon to be able to tell the
Daily about it in more detail.

We realize much of this letter
does not pertain to students other
than those living in ZAP or
Guthrie at the moment, but it will
pertain to everyone when the
University decides to institute
another theme house and next
year when the students are
looking for inexpensive housing or
a place to live without the
restrictions of a theme.
ZAP would have fulfilled
student needs for a unified house
in an informal atmosphere where
diversity doesn't mean apathy.
In principle, theme houses are
beneficial. However by creating
many such houses, the advantages
of diversity are lost in the
disadvantage of separatism.
Students cannot experience living
with people of different
backgrounds and sharing cultural
differences.
Guthrie, as a women's house,
also adds to the mosaic of
University residences. It seems the
University wants to sacrifice
non-theme houses for the sake of
established, conformed variation.
We realize that Larry Horton is
not totally responsible for the
decision, and that there was an
11-member committee only five
of whom had voting privileges
deciding between the six houses
considered. However, no criteria
were presented for the decision,
and we feel that the committee
should have met with residents of
?ach house to underline
considerations for their choice.

The University has offered to
move students in groups of five to
other houses in attempting to
preserve unity. But ZAP has not
divided into "cliques," making it
difficult to separate residents into
groups of only five.
In previous years, the
University has not been overly
generous monetarily toward ZAP.
Now, to initiate a theme house,
they are willing to invest in the
renovation of ZAP. Where is the
money coming from? In this
period of tight economy there
should be more pertinent
demands for finances.
Improvement of the University
for the student body, rather than
for 50 persons seems more logical.

In regards to the article (Daily,
March 4) concerning the
replacement of Guthrie and ZAP
houses by the two new theme
houses: to begin with, Guthrie's
RA was grossly misquoted while
the other quotes used were bits of
conversation arbitrarily put
together producing a totally
different interpretation than
intended.
Although given short notice
(Thursday afternoon) of the
meeting scheduled during the
dinner hour Sunday night, at least
12 girls accompanied a petition
with signatures of those who
couldn't attend the meeting to
present the house's case. The
consensus of the group was that a
decision to eliminate an all-female
Row house had been reached
before the meeting.
Although Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs,
professed allegiance to women's
rights as a basis on which to judge
the sexism of the fraternities
earlier this year, he has allowed
one third of the all-women's Row
housing to be eliminated.
On March 4, Horton, Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson and a director of the
new French house visited Guthrie
to assess the facilities.
Why wasn't this done before
the decision was made?
At this time Horton informed

the RA that "in all candor" the
decision was made and would not
be revoked.
The elimination of one
all-female house will limit the
diversity of residents within each
house. The discontent being felt
by many Guthrie residents stems
from this decreasing freedom of
choice for women in general.
It's unfortuante that -the
majority of Stanford women will
never experience the cohesiveness
— sisterhood — of the all-female
living situation.
Although Guthrie residents
realize the futility of trying to
reverse the action of Larry
Horton's office, an attempt is
being made by some to vent their
reactions to this decision.

In the early stages of the

Karen Murray, the housing
office's liaison with Flo Mo
residents, came under intense
criticism for her role in the
negotiations. In following her
efforts since that time however, it
has become clear that the
criticism was entirely unfounded.
Many thanks to Murray, for
despite some of the outcomes, she
has personally shown a deep

Don't Ration Gas
Editor:
In its editorial March 4 calling
for gas rationing, the Daily
espouses the popular myth that
rationing is an efficient and
equitable - means of cutting oil
consumption.
In fact, the multitude of special
circumstances and needs insures

that any rationing system, no
matter how carefully designed,
will to some extent be
inequitable.
Furthermore, though gasoline
consumption will decline under
rationing, the exact magnitude
and duration of such a decline
would be subject to the whims of
a politically controlled federal
bureaucracy.
A far simpler and more
efficient means of "rationing"
gasoline is an increased gas tax
which induces conservation
through the market forces of
supply and demand. The burden
that this would place on lower
income groups can be more than
compensated for by the
enactment of long needed
progressive income tax reforms.

An item in Mike Tollin's latest
column (Daily, March 5) needs a
bit of clarification. Tollin said
Oregon basketball coach Dick
Harter "is not the kind of person
who would deliberately hurt or
abuse anyone."
That's just plain wrong. Each
year, Oregon and Oregon State
play each other three times. The
winner of this so-called "Civil War

Chancellor's Trophy in

Last season, after Oregon State
had again clinched the series,
Beaver yell leader Rick Coutin
triumphantly bore the trophy
across court. As he passed the
Oregon bench, Coutin was tripped
by Harter and went crashing to
the floor. It didn't do Coutin, or
the trophy, any good.
So Chancellor Roy Lieuallen

Even though Tollin "can't imagine

I take this opportunity to say
that one of the corpses lamented
at the mass Funeral for the Death
of Undergraduate Education on
Feb. 20 is not dead. The
Undergraduate Writing Program
(UWP) lives, and all mourners for
it can dry their eyes.
Its name has been changed to
Freshman English, but (if we are
talking about realities and not
names) virtually everything that
was ever offered under the tag of
the Undergraduate Writing
Program is still being offered.
This seems the appropriate
time to clear up certain other
confusions. The recent obsequies
would suggest that the UWP took
care of the major part of the
writing requirement for Stanford
undergraduates. It did not. It
never handled more than about 16
percent of the courses satisfying
the writing requirement. So all
that has happened is that the
English Department has

reabsorbed that 16 percent —
along with most of the good ideas
that the UWP developed.
There never was any serious
question that the English
Department would do this. I do
not understand why rumors still
circulate that we are not going to
do it.
It is a non-problem. There has
been no death (and will be no
dearth) of courses to meet the
writing requirement. And I like to

We realize much of this letter
does not pertain to students other

Guthrie at the moment, but it will
pertain to everyone when the
University decides to institute
another theme house and next
year when the students are
looking for inexpensive housing or
a place to live without the
restrictions of a theme.
ZAP would have fulfilled
student needs for a unified house
in an informal atmosphere where
diversity doesn't mean apathy.
In principle, theme houses are
beneficial. However by creating
many such houses, the advantages
of diversity are lost in the
disadvantage of separatism.
Students cannot experience living
with people of different
backgrounds and sharing cultural
differences.
Guthrie, as a women's house,
also adds to the mosaic of
University residences. It seems the
University wants to sacrifice
non-theme houses for the sake of
established, conformed variation.
We realize that Larry Horton is
not totally responsible for the
decision, and that there was an
11-member committee only five
of whom had voting privileges
deciding between the six houses
considered. However, no criteria
were presented for the decision,
and we feel that the committee
should have met with residents of
?ach house to underline
considerations for their choice.

The University has offered to
move students in groups of five to
other houses in attempting to
preserve unity. But ZAP has not
divided into "cliques," making it
difficult to separate residents into
groups of only five.
In previous years, the
University has not been overly
generous monetarily toward ZAP.
Now, to initiate a theme house,
they are willing to invest in the
renovation of ZAP. Where is the
money coming from? In this
period of tight economy there
should be more pertinent
demands for finances.

Although Larry Horton,

In fact, the multitude of special

Furthermore, though gasoline

An item in Mike Tollin's latest
column (Daily, March 5) needs a
bit of clarification. Tollin said
Oregon basketball coach Dick
Harter "is not the kind of person
who would deliberately hurt or
abuse anyone."
That's just plain wrong. Each
year, Oregon and Oregon State
play each other three times. The
winner of this so-called "Civil War
Series" used to receive the
Chancellor's Trophy in
recognition of the achievement.
Last season, after Oregon State
had again clinched the series,
Beaver yell leader Rick Coutin
triumphantly bore the trophy
across court. As he passed the
Oregon bench, Coutin was tripped
by Harter and went crashing to
the floor. It didn't do Coutin, or
the trophy, any good.
So Chancellor Roy Lieuallen
has decided to retire the trophy.
Even though Tollin "can't imagine
Harter actually encouraging
on-court brutality," I guess
Lieuallen could. .

I take this opportunity to say
that one of the corpses lamented
at the mass Funeral for the Death
of Undergraduate Education on
Feb. 20 is not dead. The
Undergraduate Writing Program
(UWP) lives, and all mourners for
it can dry their eyes.
Its name has been changed to
Freshman English, but (if we are
talking about realities and not
names) virtually everything that
was ever offered under the tag of
the Undergraduate Writing
Program is still being offered.
This seems the appropriate
time to clear up certain other
confusions. The recent obsequies
would suggest that the UWP took
care of the major part of the
writing requirement for Stanford
undergraduates. It did not. It
never handled more than about 16
percent of the courses satisfying
the writing requirement. So all
that has happened is that the
English Department has

reabsorbed that 16 percent —
along with most of the good ideas
that the UWP developed.
There never was any serious
question that the English
Department would do this. I do
not understand why rumors still
circulate that we are not going to
do it.
It is a non-problem. There has
been no death (and will be no
dearth) of courses to meet the
writing requirement. And I like to

We realize much of this letter
does not pertain to students other
than those living in ZAP or
Guthrie at the moment, but it will
pertain to everyone when the
University decides to institute
another theme house and next
year when the students are
looking for inexpensive housing or
a place to live without the
restrictions of a theme.
ZAP would have fulfilled
student needs for a unified house
in an informal atmosphere where
diversity doesn't mean apathy.
In principle, theme houses are
beneficial. However by creating
many such houses, the advantages
of diversity are lost in the
disadvantage of separatism.
Students cannot experience living
with people of different
backgrounds and sharing cultural
differences.
Guthrie, as a women's house,
also adds to the mosaic of
University residences. It seems the
University wants to sacrifice
non-theme houses for the sake of
established, conformed variation.
We realize that Larry Horton is
not totally responsible for the
decision, and that there was an
11-member committee only five
of whom had voting privileges
deciding between the six houses
considered. However, no criteria
were presented for the decision,
and we feel that the committee
should have met with residents of
?ach house to underline
considerations for their choice.

The University has offered to
move students in groups of five to
other houses in attempting to
preserve unity. But ZAP has not
divided into "cliques," making it
difficult to separate residents into
groups of only five.
In previous years, the
University has not been overly
generous monetarily toward ZAP.
Now, to initiate a theme house,
they are willing to invest in the
renovation of ZAP. Where is the
money coming from? In this
period of tight economy there
should be more pertinent
demands for finances.

Although given short notice

with signatures of those who

consensus of the group was that a
decision to eliminate an all-female
Row house had been reached
before the meeting.
Although Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs,
professed allegiance to women's
rights as a basis on which to judge
the sexism of the fraternities
earlier this year, he has allowed
one third of the all-women's Row
housing to be eliminated.

The elimination of one

Don't Ration Gas
Editor:
In its editorial March 4 calling
for gas rationing, the Daily
espouses the popular myth that
rationing is an efficient and
equitable - means of cutting oil
consumption.
In fact, the multitude of special
circumstances and needs insures

that any rationing system, no
matter how carefully designed,
will to some extent be
inequitable.
Furthermore, though gasoline
consumption will decline under
rationing, the exact magnitude
and duration of such a decline
would be subject to the whims of
a politically controlled federal
bureaucracy.
A far simpler and more
efficient means of "rationing"
gasoline is an increased gas tax
which induces conservation
through the market forces of
supply and demand. The burden
that this would place on lower
income groups can be more than
compensated for by the
enactment of long needed
progressive income tax reforms.

Harter Is . . . (Part III)
Editor:
An item in Mike Tollin's latest
column (Daily, March 5) needs a
bit of clarification. Tollin said
Oregon basketball coach Dick
Harter "is not the kind of person
who would deliberately hurt or
abuse anyone."
That's just plain wrong. Each
year, Oregon and Oregon State
play each other three times. The
winner of this so-called "Civil War
Series" used to receive the
Chancellor's Trophy in
recognition of the achievement.
Last season, after Oregon State
had again clinched the series,
Beaver yell leader Rick Coutin
triumphantly bore the trophy
across court. As he passed the
Oregon bench, Coutin was tripped
by Harter and went crashing to
the floor. It didn't do Coutin, or
the trophy, any good.
So Chancellor Roy Lieuallen
has decided to retire the trophy.
Even though Tollin "can't imagine
Harter actually encouraging
on-court brutality," I guess
Lieuallen could. .

UWP Not Dead
Editor:
I take this opportunity to say
that one of the corpses lamented
at the mass Funeral for the Death
of Undergraduate Education on
Feb. 20 is not dead. The
Undergraduate Writing Program
(UWP) lives, and all mourners for
it can dry their eyes.
Its name has been changed to
Freshman English, but (if we are
talking about realities and not
names) virtually everything that
was ever offered under the tag of
the Undergraduate Writing
Program is still being offered.
This seems the appropriate
time to clear up certain other
confusions. The recent obsequies
would suggest that the UWP took
care of the major part of the
writing requirement for Stanford
undergraduates. It did not. It
never handled more than about 16
percent of the courses satisfying
the writing requirement. So all
that has happened is that the
English Department has

reabsorbed that 16 percent —
along with most of the good ideas
that the UWP developed.
There never was any serious
question that the English
Department would do this. I do
not understand why rumors still
circulate that we are not going to
do it.
It is a non-problem. There has
been no death (and will be no
dearth) of courses to meet the
writing requirement. And I like to
think that our program will be
better than ever next year. I
hope soon to be able to tell the
Daily about it in more detail.

New Theme Housing
Editor:
We realize much of this letter
does not pertain to students other
than those living in ZAP or
Guthrie at the moment, but it will
pertain to everyone when the
University decides to institute
another theme house and next
year when the students are
looking for inexpensive housing or
a place to live without the
restrictions of a theme.
ZAP would have fulfilled
student needs for a unified house
in an informal atmosphere where
diversity doesn't mean apathy.
In principle, theme houses are
beneficial. However by creating
many such houses, the advantages
of diversity are lost in the
disadvantage of separatism.
Students cannot experience living
with people of different
backgrounds and sharing cultural
differences.
Guthrie, as a women's house,
also adds to the mosaic of
University residences. It seems the
University wants to sacrifice
non-theme houses for the sake of
established, conformed variation.
We realize that Larry Horton is
not totally responsible for the
decision, and that there was an
11-member committee only five
of whom had voting privileges
deciding between the six houses
considered. However, no criteria
were presented for the decision,
and we feel that the committee
should have met with residents of
?ach house to underline
considerations for their choice.

The University has offered to
move students in groups of five to
other houses in attempting to
preserve unity. But ZAP has not
divided into "cliques," making it
difficult to separate residents into
groups of only five.
In previous years, the
University has not been overly
generous monetarily toward ZAP.
Now, to initiate a theme house,
they are willing to invest in the
renovation of ZAP. Where is the
money coming from? In this
period of tight economy there
should be more pertinent
demands for finances.
Improvement of the University
for the student body, rather than
for 50 persons seems more logical.

In regards to the article (Daily,
March 4) concerning the
replacement of Guthrie and ZAP
houses by the two new theme
houses: to begin with, Guthrie's
RA was grossly misquoted while
the other quotes used were bits of
conversation arbitrarily put
together producing a totally
different interpretation than
intended.
Although given short notice
(Thursday afternoon) of the
meeting scheduled during the
dinner hour Sunday night, at least
12 girls accompanied a petition
with signatures of those who
couldn't attend the meeting to
present the house's case. The
consensus of the group was that a
decision to eliminate an all-female
Row house had been reached
before the meeting.
Although Larry Horton,
associate dean of student affairs,
professed allegiance to women's
rights as a basis on which to judge
the sexism of the fraternities
earlier this year, he has allowed
one third of the all-women's Row
housing to be eliminated.
On March 4, Horton, Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson and a director of the
new French house visited Guthrie
to assess the facilities.
Why wasn't this done before
the decision was made?
At this time Horton informed

the RA that "in all candor" the
decision was made and would not
be revoked.
The elimination of one
all-female house will limit the
diversity of residents within each
house. The discontent being felt
by many Guthrie residents stems
from this decreasing freedom of
choice for women in general.
It's unfortuante that -the
majority of Stanford women will
never experience the cohesiveness
— sisterhood — of the all-female
living situation.
Although Guthrie residents
realize the futility of trying to
reverse the action of Larry
Horton's office, an attempt is
being made by some to vent their
reactions to this decision.
