# Greatest 20th Century American?

### Stephen Carter 
Who is "the greatest man who has lived in
the U.S. in this century"?
It depends, of course, on the criteria you
use. But a powerful case can be made for a
once-controversial, now little-known figure,
nominated for the position by political
commentator Murry Kempton.
Kempton wrote: "It is hard to make
anyone who has never met him believe that
A. Philip Randolph must be the greatest man
who has lived in the U.S. in this century. But
it is harder yet to make anyone who has ever
known him believe anything else."
A. Philip Randolph? you might well ask,
especially if you're white. Who's he?
Think hard. If you're old enough, you may
n-member that he had something to do with
the March on Washington in 1963. Or
perhaps you recall that he had something to
do with the AFL-CIO. Think harder — he
organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters.
'Uncle Tom No. 2'
Civil rights. Organized labor. If you're
white, that may be as much as you can recall.
Or if you're black, you may have concluded,
as did one group of black "militants" in
1969, that Randolph should be "Uncle Tom
No. 2" in the nation (they placed him just
behind Roy Wilkins of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People for this dubious honor).
Randolph has a habit of turning people off
when he says things like, "While I do not
share the Panther philosophy, I will defend
their right to exist as a political group and to
propagandize their beliefs." The first part has
helped make Randolph a Tom to many
blacks, the second has helped make him a
militant to many whites.
One black youth wrote of Randolph a few
years ago: "If he is to be accurately described
as a 'black messiah,' all I can say is no
wonder we never got anywhere."

But Randolph has not always had this
image.
During the First World War, Attorney
General A. Mitchell Palmer called him one of
the two "most dangerous Negroes in
America." He published a radical magazine,
the Messenger, at a time when doing so was
often a capital offense.
Randolph remained a bitter critic of World
War I and of wars (although not necessarily
of violence) in general, even after his arrest in
1918 for alleged violation of the Espionage
Act. However, neither Randolph nor his
associate and co-defendant, Chandler Owen,
was convicted. Years later, there was some
evidence that Randolph had evaded the draft,
but he was never brought to trial.

But Randolph's incredible
accomplishments were undoubtedly those in
the field of organized labor. After years c
urging workers to unite, in 1925 he took on
the task of organizing sleeping car porters
into a union. On August 25, 1937, exactly
12 years to the day after organizing the
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters,
Randolph signed the first contract on their
behalf with the Pullman Company.
The previous year, expecting the union to
win what had been a difficult and trying
struggle, the American Federation of Labor
had awarded the Brotherhood a charter.

Randolph suddenly found himself the most
popular — and probably, the most powerful
— black leader in America.
In 1941, certainly before it became
fashionable, Randolph tried to organize a
March on Washington, demanding an end to
both discrimination in defense industry
employment and segregation in the armed
forces. To his apparent surprise, neither the
NAACP nor the National Urban League
offered much support for the venture.
Radicals Attacked Him
Even radical black publications attacked
Randolph when he decided to go ahead with
the March, calling for 100,000 black
protestors to descend upon the nation's
capital. But just six days before the March on
Washington was scheduled to begin, President
Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order
8802, forbidding discrimination in defense
industries. His strategy successful, Randolph
canceled the march (incidentally, some of
the same black publications renewed their
assaults, this time charging that he had not
gone far enough).
Many of Randolph's later achievements are
simply recent history. For years he carried on
a one-man fight within the AFL-CIO against
Jim Crow union locals. But George Meany,
always ready to expel a corrupt or
Communist-controlled local, did not feel
severe measures against merely racist unions
would help — so nothing was done. At one
point, in fact, the AFL-CIO aroused a swarm
of public indignation when it censured
Randolph, who kept up his attacks anyway.
All of this brings us back to the March on
Washington in 1963, the crowning triumph
of Randolph's career. He retired shortly
thereafter. The charges that he is a Tom
simply do not hold water.
As for his greatness — that remains for you
to judge.
