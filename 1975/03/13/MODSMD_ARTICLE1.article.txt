# Men's, Women's, Programs Combined
## Athletic Department Streamlined 
### GLENN KRAMON 
A streamlined athletic department
s been created to oversee all men's
d women's sports programs here in
effort to cut costs and provide
Uality for women athletes.
Approved Monday by the Board of
ustees, the Department of Athletics,
ysical Education and Recreation
rn bines the previously separate
ministrations of the men's and
mien's athletic departments.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz, who
II direct the new department,
lieves the new arrangement "enables
, in an economical fashion, to
mply with Title IX regulations
jquiring equal opportunity for men
and women at federally funded
institutions] and continue to strive for
excellence in our intercollegiate
athletic program."
However, it is unclear whether the
new set-up will allow the University's

sports programs to be in complete
compliance with Title IX.
Assoc. Physical Education Prof.
Pam Strathairn, who will serve as
associate director and chairman of
physical education, notes that "none
of us have seen the latest regulations
submitted to President Eord."
'Good Start'
Vicki Hays, a sophomore who has
represented women athletes on a
University committee dealing with the
subject, calls the new department "a
good start" toward equal opportunity
for women athletes.
Athletic Department administrators
believe the new department will cut
back on duplication at a time when
they hope to trim $120,000 from
University sports programs over the
next three years as part of the
University's overall belt-tightening.
Scheduling, equipment distribution,
training and sports information will be

handled by one department instead of
two.
Unique
One coach will oversee both men's
and women's teams, a situation Ruetz
suggests may be unique among major
universities.
The merger will also free Athletic
Department income reserves, gained
mostly from the football program, for
use as scholarship grants to women
athletes.
Ruetz says he has set aside more
than $100,000 of reserve income to
sustain the equivalent of 20 full-ride
annual grants for women over the next
four years.
Women's Grants
Meanwhile, the Athletic
Department will negotiate with
University fundraisers in an effort to
establish a gift program similar to that
of Buck Club, whose 4800 members
this year donated $530,000 for
financial aid to 124 male athletes.
The women's fundraising program
likely would be coordinated by
Alumni Relations Director Jack Laird,
and Ruetz says he hopes it could raise
$150,000 to $200,000 in the four
years that Athletic Department
reserves pay for the scholarships.
Under the new set-up, the head
coach for each sport will be
responsible for scheduling, recruiting,
scholarships and coaching of both the
men's and women's teams.
Current Coaches
The current head coaches of the
men's teams in tennis and swimming,
Dick Gould and Jim Gaughran, have
been appointed directors of the
programs for their sports.
Both will receive the aid of an
assistant coach. In Gould's case, a new
assistant tennis coach will be hired.
Gould says he has no one in mind for

the job, but hopes such a coach would
be involved in fundraising efforts for
the women's team as he has for the
men's team.
Jean Helliwell, already fencing
coach for both sexes, will direct the
fencing program. Gymnastics Coach
Sadao Hamada will run the gymnastics
program, which will include a women's
team for the first time next autumn.
Cage Director
The University's new head
basketball coach, to be named by
April 1, will direct the basketball
program.
The Athletic Department also will
hire a fulltime female assistant trainer.
Currently, Debbie Jeffries, a physical
therapy intern, serves as the women's
trainer. Both Strathairn and Hays
consider her a viable candidate for the
new position.
In the only exception to the new
policy, the current head coaches of the
men's and women's golf teams, Bud
Finger and Carroll Diaz, will continue
their present jobs.
But Ruetz believes the other
coaches will find the time for their
additional responsibilities.
Swimming coach Gaughran agrees,
though he admits coaching the
women's team "will make the day a
bit longer because we'll have to extend
our workouts to accommodate"
swimmers of both sexes.
Gaughran notes that "the women
swimmers will be expected to do the
same kind of traning as the men,"
working out twice a day instead of
four times weekly "in order to make
them into a strong national team."
In an effort to supply the coaches
with more time, Strathairn says,
"There will be an elimination of some
physical education classes which are
more recreational than instructional."
