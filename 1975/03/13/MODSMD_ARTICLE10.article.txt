# Farewell, Howie
## 
### 
After 21 years of guiding the Stanford basketball team,
Howie Dallmar has decided to retire from coaching. We
appreciate the effort Dallmar has put into his coaching and
thank him for his dedicated service.
While some may question his strategy and tactics, few can
deny that Dallmar has been a good influence on his players.
He never subordinated the welfare of his players to an
all-out desire for victory.
We are glad to see that a committee of diverse individuals
has been chosen to recommend a successor to Dallmar. We
hope the committee conducts an exhaustive nationwide
search for a coach who will not only bring Stanford
basketball to national prominence, but continue Dallmar's
winning-isn 't-everything approach to the game.
