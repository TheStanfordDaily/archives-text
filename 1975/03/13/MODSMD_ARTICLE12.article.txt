# Evaluative Processes Need Change
## 
### 
The Buckley Amendment to the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974
guaranteed to any student access to his or her
own file at an institution receiving federal
funds administered by the U.S. Office of
Education. While many individuals have
welcomed this legislation as a gain in civil
rights, a number of undergraduate and
graduate educational institutions have
expressed fears that letters of evaluation
about a student may now become less frank.
As a long-term member of a medical
school admissions committee, I should like to
express three of my own reactions to this
recent legislation which are at some variance
with either of the above major viewpoints in
this controversy.
First, it is very rare that I see a
well-informed, frank and critical letter from
an undergraduate faculty member or anyone
else about a candidate for medical school.
Even when it has been known that the
candidate will never see the letter, the
epistles have varied from merely laudatory to
outright ecstatic. It is hard to be certain why
this is so; one wonders about the relation of
this phenomenon to rising grade point
averages across the country .
Most testifiers about students these days
seem to be putting mercy to the individual
ahead of taking a responsible position toward
society, a choice which is particularly
dangerous in selecting those who will be the
next generation's physicians.
Perhaps more important is the probability
that those who write letters of evaluation are
in various ways interested parties. The

professor who tries to slip his own
university's pre-medical students into a
medical school is obviously satisfying
institutional interests, and the research
supervisor with whom a medical school
candidate has worked may in a number of
ways be advancing or conserving the interests
of his own research laboratory.
Even the dwindling number of letters
from long-time family friends and other
non-academic observers represent interested
points of view which it would be too much
to expect would ever be critical in tone.
Second, while confidential letters of
recommendation may serve the ease with
which an institution chooses among
candidates (though I doubt that contention),
such private testimony certainly fails to
inform the student on how he is regarded and
what might be appropriate areas for change.
At the School of Medicine, when a
student takes a clinical experience in
obstetrics or medicine or surgery, the
supervising faculty member sends a narrative
evaluation of the student's strengths and
weaknesses to the Office of Student Affairs
at the end of the six or 12 weeks' clerkship,
and a carbon copy of this report is sent to
the student.
As the student receives successive
clerkship evaluations, he gradually gains an
idea of what kind of person he is perceived to
be, such that the final Dean's letter
recommending him for graduate training as a
resident physician does not come as much of
a shock to him.
I am not certain if such a method could be

William Creger

followed in undergraduate teaching, for it
certainly would require more small-group
teaching and much greater familiarity
between faculty and students than now
obtains.
Such alterations in student-teacher
relationships can, of course, be favored on
grounds more important than performance
evaluation. I imagine if this kind of scheme
were employed in undergraduate education,
copies of letters to graduate schools could be
made available to the student, as copies of
Dean's letters are in the medical school,
without much trauma on either side.
The word, "confidentiality," has an
implication of a greater evil in it than the
possibility of Star Chamber proceedings.
Lack of honest feedback to the student
removes a possibility for him to change his
ways.
Third, employing the opposite of
confidentiality in approaching this particular
set of problems may indeed engender some
lawsuits. But I think to have expected that
there would be no legal hazards in higher
education was probably foolish in the first
place.
I believe that if there were a system of
regular feedback to students of the kind I
have described, and ample procedural
possibilities for review and appeal, the
number of suits would be few, and their
outcome would not regularly go against the
university concerned.

I believe that if there were a system of
regular feedback to students of the kind I
have described, and ample procedural
possibilities for review and appeal, the
number of suits would be few, and their
outcome would not regularly go against the
university concerned.

The Buckley Amendment to the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974
guaranteed to any student access to his or her
own file at an institution receiving federal
funds administered by the U.S. Office of
Education. While many individuals have
welcomed this legislation as a gain in civil
rights, a number of undergraduate and
graduate educational institutions have
expressed fears that letters of evaluation
about a student may now become less frank.
As a long-term member of a medical
school admissions committee, I should like to
express three of my own reactions to this
recent legislation which are at some variance
with either of the above major viewpoints in
this controversy.
First, it is very rare that I see a
well-informed, frank and critical letter from
an undergraduate faculty member or anyone
else about a candidate for medical school.
Even when it has been known that the
candidate will never see the letter, the
epistles have varied from merely laudatory to
outright ecstatic. It is hard to be certain why
this is so; one wonders about the relation of
this phenomenon to rising grade point
averages across the country .
Most testifiers about students these days
seem to be putting mercy to the individual
ahead of taking a responsible position toward
society, a choice which is particularly
dangerous in selecting those who will be the
next generation's physicians.
Perhaps more important is the probability
that those who write letters of evaluation are
in various ways interested parties. The

professor who tries to slip his own
university's pre-medical students into a
medical school is obviously satisfying
institutional interests, and the research
supervisor with whom a medical school
candidate has worked may in a number of
ways be advancing or conserving the interests
of his own research laboratory.
Even the dwindling number of letters
from long-time family friends and other
non-academic observers represent interested
points of view which it would be too much
to expect would ever be critical in tone.
Second, while confidential letters of
recommendation may serve the ease with
which an institution chooses among
candidates (though I doubt that contention),
such private testimony certainly fails to
inform the student on how he is regarded and
what might be appropriate areas for change.
At the School of Medicine, when a
student takes a clinical experience in
obstetrics or medicine or surgery, the
supervising faculty member sends a narrative
evaluation of the student's strengths and
weaknesses to the Office of Student Affairs
at the end of the six or 12 weeks' clerkship,
and a carbon copy of this report is sent to
the student.
As the student receives successive
clerkship evaluations, he gradually gains an
idea of what kind of person he is perceived to
be, such that the final Dean's letter
recommending him for graduate training as a
resident physician does not come as much of
a shock to him.
I am not certain if such a method could be

William Creger

followed in undergraduate teaching, for it
certainly would require more small-group
teaching and much greater familiarity
between faculty and students than now
obtains.
Such alterations in student-teacher
relationships can, of course, be favored on
grounds more important than performance
evaluation. I imagine if this kind of scheme
were employed in undergraduate education,
copies of letters to graduate schools could be
made available to the student, as copies of
Dean's letters are in the medical school,
without much trauma on either side.
The word, "confidentiality," has an
implication of a greater evil in it than the
possibility of Star Chamber proceedings.
Lack of honest feedback to the student
removes a possibility for him to change his
ways.
Third, employing the opposite of
confidentiality in approaching this particular
set of problems may indeed engender some
lawsuits. But I think to have expected that
there would be no legal hazards in higher
education was probably foolish in the first
place.
I believe that if there were a system of
regular feedback to students of the kind I
have described, and ample procedural
possibilities for review and appeal, the
number of suits would be few, and their
outcome would not regularly go against the
