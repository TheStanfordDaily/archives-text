# Sororities Deserve A Resurrection
## 
### Tim Ferguson 
Return for a few moments to the Stanford
campus of a generation ago.
The year was 1944. The number of
women at Stanford, limited by edict to 500
until 1933, had jumped to 1050 after the
ceiling was lifted and then bloated to 1350
during Worid War 11.
All Stanford women, save for a selected
portion chosen during late winter, were
required to stay in one of four all-female
residence halls until they graduated from the
University. Social activities for Stanford
women were limited to the confines of an
isolated campus.
Enough history. I rehash it merely to
establish a milieu, one far different from the
contemporary Stanford scene. And yet
amidst this background, a decision of some
moment in 1944 was made which to this day
clouds the policies of the University.
Sororities Abolished
On the night of April 26, 1944, recently
inaugurated University President Donald
Tresidder told an assembly of undergraduate
women that the Board of Trustees had
abolished sororities at Stanford.
As Tresidder finished his speech, the
women (including those in sororities) saluted
him with a rendition of the Stanford Hymn.
As the president returned to his hilltop
home, some of the Greek sisters serenaded
him with their sororities' songs — not in
protest, but in praise.
"I was surprised to learn how many
sorority women have felt from the beginning
that this was the right move," Tresidder said.
The members of the nine Stanford
sororities, which included some of the most
select in all Pan-Hellenia, were sick at heart.
For while the female population had shot
upward at Stanford, the number of campus
sororities had actually declined by one from
the 10 which had colonized here starting
with the University's founding in 1891.
The result was a decade of tumultuous
rushes, with too many women seeking too
few spots. The sororities housed about 30
apiece, and the University refused to bend

regulations which prohibited them from
admitting to membership more than they
could house.
With most of the freshman women
clustered in Roble Hall, the situation lenl
itself to extreme social pressure. Upperclas*
women in Roble complained of rush in 1943:
"The women students are so tense and tired
l hat their college work suffers
unmistakably."

Those selected for membership often were
distraught after finding close companions
turned down. "Kids were caught in a real
bind," a member of the last sorority pledge
class recently told me. "It was very tough to
see good friends who you lived with being
rejected."
Such elitism was intolerable to many
during a time when American "democracy"
was being defended around the globe. One
anti-sorority statement asked the
administration "to repudiate the prevailing
fallacy of social stratification. Perhaps we
should reject it as vigorously as we reject
Hitler's theory of a super-race."
The sorority sisters said to hell with it,
and acquiesced in a discriminatory University
policy which would deny them mutual
selection in housing while maintaining it for
their male counterparts in fraternities.
Which brings us to 1975. The policy, of
course, is still with us. A group of some 20
undergraduate women currently struggling to
restore sororities to Stanford is being met
with blank stares from the administration.
The main arguments against allowing a
return of sororities, even if they were to

build their own houses and thus help alleviate
the campus shortage, are two-fold. First, a
social dichotomy once again would split
Stanford women. Second, insufficient
demand exists for sororities.
The little history lesson, admittedly, was a
counter to the first argument. No similar
circumstances currently exist at Stanford.
Where a Greek system does exist, in the male
sector, it is a strong but by no means
predominant aspect of social life at the
University.
Additionally, because of changed social
attitudes and upgrading of the University
residence system, reoccurrence of the unmet
demand crisis of sororities is well-nigh
impossible.
That presents the question: is there any
demand?
Obviously there is among the 20 now
campaigning for sororities. And, says a
member of the group, "A lot of the women
don't know about it, and others are afraid to
be in the beginning of it, to fight for it.
Maybe after it's established for 10 years
things might be different."
If it's established. Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton points to
limited demand for current all-women Row
houses and extrapolates sorority popularity
from that. He neglects the potent difference
between the cohesion of mutually selective
houses and the often hodge-podge nature of
women's Row housing. For evidence, one
might note the gap in popularity separating
fraternities from former non-fraternal
all-male Row houses.
To get their case before the Board of
Trustees, sorority backers say they must
either file a lawsuit charging discrimination
under the present system or gain approval for
presentation from the Dean of Student
Affairs' Office. If the administrators therein
truly are interested in diversity in campus
housing, sororities will get such a new lease
on life.

women at Stanford, limited by edict to 500
until 1933, had jumped to 1050 after the
ceiling was lifted and then bloated to 1350
during Worid War 11.
All Stanford women, save for a selected
portion chosen during late winter, were
required to stay in one of four all-female
residence halls until they graduated from the
University. Social activities for Stanford
women were limited to the confines of an
isolated campus.
Enough history. I rehash it merely to
establish a milieu, one far different from the
contemporary Stanford scene. And yet
amidst this background, a decision of some
moment in 1944 was made which to this day
clouds the policies of the University.
Sororities Abolished
On the night of April 26, 1944, recently
inaugurated University President Donald
Tresidder told an assembly of undergraduate
women that the Board of Trustees had
abolished sororities at Stanford.
As Tresidder finished his speech, the
women (including those in sororities) saluted
him with a rendition of the Stanford Hymn.
As the president returned to his hilltop
home, some of the Greek sisters serenaded
him with their sororities' songs — not in
protest, but in praise.
"I was surprised to learn how many
sorority women have felt from the beginning
that this was the right move," Tresidder said.
The members of the nine Stanford
sororities, which included some of the most
select in all Pan-Hellenia, were sick at heart.
For while the female population had shot
upward at Stanford, the number of campus
sororities had actually declined by one from
the 10 which had colonized here starting
with the University's founding in 1891.
The result was a decade of tumultuous
rushes, with too many women seeking too
few spots. The sororities housed about 30
apiece, and the University refused to bend

regulations which prohibited them from
admitting to membership more than they
could house.
With most of the freshman women
clustered in Roble Hall, the situation lenl
itself to extreme social pressure. Upperclas*
women in Roble complained of rush in 1943:
"The women students are so tense and tired
l hat their college work suffers
unmistakably."

Those selected for membership often were
distraught after finding close companions
turned down. "Kids were caught in a real
bind," a member of the last sorority pledge
class recently told me. "It was very tough to
see good friends who you lived with being
rejected."
Such elitism was intolerable to many
during a time when American "democracy"
was being defended around the globe. One
anti-sorority statement asked the
administration "to repudiate the prevailing
fallacy of social stratification. Perhaps we
should reject it as vigorously as we reject
Hitler's theory of a super-race."
The sorority sisters said to hell with it,
and acquiesced in a discriminatory University
policy which would deny them mutual
selection in housing while maintaining it for
their male counterparts in fraternities.
Which brings us to 1975. The policy, of
course, is still with us. A group of some 20
undergraduate women currently struggling to
restore sororities to Stanford is being met
with blank stares from the administration.
The main arguments against allowing a
return of sororities, even if they were to

build their own houses and thus help alleviate
the campus shortage, are two-fold. First, a
social dichotomy once again would split
Stanford women. Second, insufficient
demand exists for sororities.
The little history lesson, admittedly, was a
counter to the first argument. No similar
circumstances currently exist at Stanford.
Where a Greek system does exist, in the male
sector, it is a strong but by no means
predominant aspect of social life at the
University.
Additionally, because of changed social
attitudes and upgrading of the University
residence system, reoccurrence of the unmet
demand crisis of sororities is well-nigh
impossible.
That presents the question: is there any
demand?
Obviously there is among the 20 now
campaigning for sororities. And, says a
member of the group, "A lot of the women
don't know about it, and others are afraid to
be in the beginning of it, to fight for it.
Maybe after it's established for 10 years
things might be different."
If it's established. Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton points to
limited demand for current all-women Row
houses and extrapolates sorority popularity
from that. He neglects the potent difference
between the cohesion of mutually selective
houses and the often hodge-podge nature of
women's Row housing. For evidence, one
might note the gap in popularity separating
fraternities from former non-fraternal
all-male Row houses.
To get their case before the Board of
Trustees, sorority backers say they must
either file a lawsuit charging discrimination
under the present system or gain approval for
presentation from the Dean of Student
Affairs' Office. If the administrators therein
truly are interested in diversity in campus
housing, sororities will get such a new lease
on life.

until 1933, had jumped to 1050 after the
ceiling was lifted and then bloated to 1350
during Worid War 11.
All Stanford women, save for a selected
portion chosen during late winter, were
required to stay in one of four all-female
residence halls until they graduated from the
University. Social activities for Stanford
women were limited to the confines of an
isolated campus.
Enough history. I rehash it merely to
establish a milieu, one far different from the
contemporary Stanford scene. And yet
amidst this background, a decision of some
moment in 1944 was made which to this day
clouds the policies of the University.
Sororities Abolished
On the night of April 26, 1944, recently
inaugurated University President Donald
Tresidder told an assembly of undergraduate
women that the Board of Trustees had
abolished sororities at Stanford.
As Tresidder finished his speech, the
women (including those in sororities) saluted
him with a rendition of the Stanford Hymn.
As the president returned to his hilltop
home, some of the Greek sisters serenaded
him with their sororities' songs — not in
protest, but in praise.
"I was surprised to learn how many
sorority women have felt from the beginning
that this was the right move," Tresidder said.
The members of the nine Stanford
sororities, which included some of the most
select in all Pan-Hellenia, were sick at heart.
For while the female population had shot
upward at Stanford, the number of campus
sororities had actually declined by one from
the 10 which had colonized here starting
with the University's founding in 1891.
The result was a decade of tumultuous
rushes, with too many women seeking too
few spots. The sororities housed about 30
apiece, and the University refused to bend

regulations which prohibited them from
admitting to membership more than they
could house.
With most of the freshman women
clustered in Roble Hall, the situation lenl
itself to extreme social pressure. Upperclas*
women in Roble complained of rush in 1943:
"The women students are so tense and tired
l hat their college work suffers
unmistakably."

Those selected for membership often were
distraught after finding close companions
turned down. "Kids were caught in a real
bind," a member of the last sorority pledge
class recently told me. "It was very tough to
see good friends who you lived with being
rejected."
Such elitism was intolerable to many
during a time when American "democracy"
was being defended around the globe. One
anti-sorority statement asked the
administration "to repudiate the prevailing
fallacy of social stratification. Perhaps we
should reject it as vigorously as we reject
Hitler's theory of a super-race."
The sorority sisters said to hell with it,
and acquiesced in a discriminatory University
policy which would deny them mutual
selection in housing while maintaining it for
their male counterparts in fraternities.
Which brings us to 1975. The policy, of
course, is still with us. A group of some 20
undergraduate women currently struggling to
restore sororities to Stanford is being met
with blank stares from the administration.
The main arguments against allowing a
return of sororities, even if they were to

build their own houses and thus help alleviate
the campus shortage, are two-fold. First, a
social dichotomy once again would split
Stanford women. Second, insufficient
demand exists for sororities.
The little history lesson, admittedly, was a
counter to the first argument. No similar
circumstances currently exist at Stanford.
Where a Greek system does exist, in the male
sector, it is a strong but by no means
predominant aspect of social life at the
University.
Additionally, because of changed social
attitudes and upgrading of the University
residence system, reoccurrence of the unmet
demand crisis of sororities is well-nigh
impossible.
That presents the question: is there any
demand?
Obviously there is among the 20 now
campaigning for sororities. And, says a
member of the group, "A lot of the women
don't know about it, and others are afraid to
be in the beginning of it, to fight for it.
Maybe after it's established for 10 years
things might be different."
If it's established. Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Horton points to
limited demand for current all-women Row
houses and extrapolates sorority popularity
from that. He neglects the potent difference
between the cohesion of mutually selective
houses and the often hodge-podge nature of
women's Row housing. For evidence, one
might note the gap in popularity separating
fraternities from former non-fraternal
all-male Row houses.
To get their case before the Board of
Trustees, sorority backers say they must
either file a lawsuit charging discrimination
under the present system or gain approval for
presentation from the Dean of Student
Affairs' Office. If the administrators therein
truly are interested in diversity in campus
housing, sororities will get such a new lease
on life.
