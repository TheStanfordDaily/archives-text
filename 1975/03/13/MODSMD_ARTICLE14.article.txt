# Gallo Supporters Distort The Truth
## 
### 
Steve Westly's column (Daily,
Feb. 19) and the column bv
Kim Nvegaard and Riv Weber
(Daily, Mar. 7) on the United Farm
Workers (UFW)arefilledwith many
disturbing distortions. Using these
articles as a springboard, this issue
deserves clarification.
First, contrary to both authors'
contentions, Gallo's workers are
not the highest paid farmworkers
in the country . By using the labor

contractor system, whereby the
foreman of each field receives up
to 22 percent of each worker's
pay, Teamster union dues that are
three times as high as those of the
UFW, and deductions for benefits
which the workers rarely, if ever,
receive, Gallo and the Teamsters
are able to avoid giving the
workers the wage agreed upon in
the contract.
Indeed, the major difference

between Teamster and UFW
contracts is that Teamster
contracts simply are not enforced.
UFW contracts provide for hiring
halls and ranch committees to
insure job security, seniority, and
the enforcement of all
agreements.
Second, Gallo does not favor
free, secret-ballot elections. Gallo
favors legislation which, although
providing for elections, would
outlaw the secondary boycott and
provide for a 60- to 90-day
"cooling-off" period when a
labor-management dispute occurs.
It is these two aspects of certain
legislation that Gallo finds
attractive.
The secondary boycott is a
democratic, nonviolent tactic
which most labor unions used
while in their infancy.The UFW
feels that it deserves the same
opportunity. The "cooling-off"
period would essentially nullify
strikes since the harvest of most
crops are within this 60-day
period.
Third, Westly, Nyegaard and
Weber recommended that the
UFW try organizing farmworkers
in other crops since Gallo employs
only 500 workers:
—the UFW has begun
organizing workers in tomato,
lettuce, lemon, strawberry,
mushroom, and apple fields;
—the UFW feels obliged to
continue to struggle for its grape
workers;
—although Gallo only employs
500 workers at peak harvest, it
buys one-third of all California
grapes and thus has considerable
influence over the policies of
those ranches. A successful Gallo
boycott would directly benefit
approximately 10,000
farmworkers.
More important than
considering the details of the
1973 negotiations, I urge Westly,
Nyegaard, Weber and the Stanford
community to consider such
questions as:
—What makes Gallo think that
it knows which legislation is best

Chris Co lemon

for the workers?
—Why is Gallo spending
millions of dollars in an anti-UFW
advertising campaign if the
boycott is having no effect?
And, finally, consider this
question: Chavez, like all UFW
staff members, is paid $5 per
week plus room and board for
working 16 hours a day, six days
per week. Can it possibly be
maintained that Chavez and the
hundreds of UFW staff members
have a self-serving purpose in
gaining these contracts? Compare
this with Westly's $10 a week
salary from Gallo.
