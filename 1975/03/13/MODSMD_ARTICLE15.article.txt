From Stanford To Prison
Editor:
I found Betty Goodwin's two
articles on famous alums (Daily,
March 3 and 4) to bo fascinating.
But 1 was sorely disappointed
that the author did not contact
John Ehrlichman to ask him:
"Did Stanford get you where you
are today?"

Maintain Innovation
Editor:
There is substantial and
increasing student concern that
the budget cuts necessitated by
the present financial situation will
lessen the emphasis placed on the
extradepartmental innovative
programs. We contend that these
programs fulfill real educational
needs not satisfied elsewhere.
This is demonstrated by their
continuing high level of student
participation. The present
proposal to end SWOPSI as a
separate program does not seem
to consider the cost effectiveness
of the program, its popularity or
its unique place in the curriculum.
While we are cognizant of the
necessity for budget cuts in all
areas, there seems to exist a
divergence in academic priorities
between the administration and
the student community.
We ask that careful
consideration be given to what we
see as widespread support of the
existing innovative educational
programs at Stanford.

ASSU Council of Presidents
Funds Not Wasted
Editor:
Bonny Rodden's news analysis
in the Feb. 28 Daily said that the
$12,000 ASSU guest
professorship fund "sits unused."
On the contrary, it seems to
me that the fund has been earning
interest at a healthy rate. The
decision to offer a guest
professorship to Nguyen Huu
Thai, and the attendant publicity,
were undoubtedly responsible for
Thai's release from one of
President Thieu's prisons.
Most of us had never heard of
the economist Hermann
Schwember, now imprisoned by
the Chilean junta, until he was
offered a guest professorship.
Now there is hope that his life too
will be saved because his name,
and his fate, have been brought to
public attention.
Perhaps the most profitable use
of the guest professorship fund so
far has been to provide a
community-wide education. We
have learned from immediate
examples how America's "free
world" allies treat intellectuals
who are critical of their
governments, and how reluctant
our State Department is to offer
asylum to the victims of
dictatorship. We have also learned
how many changes must be made
before the United States can live
up to its own rhetoric.
These lessons seem to me as
important as any to be learned
through student activities at
Stanford. As a community
member, I am grateful to the
students who established the guest
professorship fund and I hope it
will continue to be used as wisely
as it has been this year.
