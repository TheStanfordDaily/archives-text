# Administration In Good Position
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate's move last week
to seek an out-of-court settlement
with the University over the parking
sticker controversy has opened the
way for the University to simply
ignore the students' views and to
continue with its present parking
policy for the remainder of the school
year.
The University has until April 1 to
respond to a request by the Senate to
enter into binding arbitration. Should
the University refuse, legal action will
once again be sought. However, to
finance further court action, the ASSU
will be forced to ask for a $1 student
fee assessment on the spring ballot.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape has already implied that the
University will refuse to collect a fee
assessment which will be used in a
court case against itself. Unless it is
done voluntarily, there is no other way
to collect the fee assessment except
through the University. The best
proponents can hope for is that the
assessment vote may provide a
referendum of student opinion. But in
light of the University's track record
for listening to student opinion, that is
a dim hope.

The Escondido Village Council and
the ASSU did have an alternative.
Steve Finkler, a business student and
an Escondido Village resident, filed a
separate suit in Palo Alto-Mt. View
Municipal Court challenging his
parking ticket. Finkler was hoping to
make his a test case. However, when
he appeared in court Monday, ready to
present his case, the arresting officer
was not there. The case was dismissed.
No legal test case was made —nothing
was changed. And the University was
still safe.
Binding arbitration means that both
sides must agree to the decision
reached by the arbiter. For the
University, should it lose, the
compliance will only have to last
between three and six months before a
new parking policy is formulated,
based on the findings of Peter
Carpenter's parking study.
Although Carpenter had originally
planned to release his
recommendations in mid-February so
that the University could formulate a
new parking policy by spring quarter,
those plans were somehow delayed.
The University does not now plan to
change policy until this summer —
when most students are away. (The
decision to reinstitute the $7.50 fee
was reached during winter break.)
Perhaps it is because the University
has taken students for granted for so
long that they have continued to do it
with no qualms. Observers say
President Lyman is angry- with this

entire controversy. He has refused to
intervene and once warned that the
ASSU suit against him gave him "less
motivation to cooperate with the
ASSU."

the pouting child who knows he's

decision to reinstitute the $7.50 fee
was reached during winter break.)
Perhaps it is because the University
has taken students for granted for so
long that they have continued to do it
with no qualms. Observers say
President Lyman is angry- with this

entire controversy. He has refused to
intervene and once warned that the
ASSU suit against him gave him "less
motivation to cooperate with the
ASSU."

the pouting child who knows he's

exactly what's going to happen. The
University will win this one, just as it
has won all the others. And we, the
students, will once again be the losers.

The ASSU Senate's move last week
to seek an out-of-court settlement
with the University over the parking
sticker controversy has opened the
way for the University to simply
ignore the students' views and to
continue with its present parking
policy for the remainder of the school
year.
The University has until April 1 to
respond to a request by the Senate to
enter into binding arbitration. Should
the University refuse, legal action will
once again be sought. However, to
finance further court action, the ASSU
will be forced to ask for a $1 student
fee assessment on the spring ballot.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape has already implied that the
University will refuse to collect a fee
assessment which will be used in a
court case against itself. Unless it is
done voluntarily, there is no other way
to collect the fee assessment except
through the University. The best
proponents can hope for is that the
assessment vote may provide a
referendum of student opinion. But in
light of the University's track record
for listening to student opinion, that is
a dim hope.

The Escondido Village Council and
the ASSU did have an alternative.
Steve Finkler, a business student and
an Escondido Village resident, filed a
separate suit in Palo Alto-Mt. View
Municipal Court challenging his
parking ticket. Finkler was hoping to
make his a test case. However, when
he appeared in court Monday, ready to
present his case, the arresting officer
was not there. The case was dismissed.
No legal test case was made —nothing
was changed. And the University was
still safe.
Binding arbitration means that both
sides must agree to the decision
reached by the arbiter. For the
University, should it lose, the
compliance will only have to last
between three and six months before a
new parking policy is formulated,
based on the findings of Peter
Carpenter's parking study.
Although Carpenter had originally
planned to release his
recommendations in mid-February so
that the University could formulate a
new parking policy by spring quarter,
those plans were somehow delayed.
The University does not now plan to
change policy until this summer —
when most students are away. (The
decision to reinstitute the $7.50 fee
was reached during winter break.)
