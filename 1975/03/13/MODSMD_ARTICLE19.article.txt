# Parking--Here And Elsewhere
## 
### 
The parking system at Stanford must change. For the
past 20 years, it has remained basically the same while
nearly everything around it has not. But how should it
change? How do other universities handle parking? And,
more important, what are the University community's
attitudes and perceptions relative to parking?
A review being conducted by Peter Carpenter, assistant
vice president for medical affairs, has been trying to answer
these and other questions in order to make
recommendations for changes to the vice presidents. The
research has included a review of previous Stanford parking
studies done here, the holding of eight (poorly attended)
public meetings on the parking problem and distribution of
questionnaires.
The recommendations are still being formulated, but
preliminary data have indicated certain trends in practices
and attitudes.
The most significant of these, and those potentially most
relevant to Stanford's particular situation, are summarized
below under three general headings: fees, allocation and
enforcement.
The data is based primarily on two questionnaires, one
sent to over 60 other universities, the other sent by
students in Asst. Business Prof. Francine Gordon's
Organizational Behavior class to 1500 residents of the
University community.
Lack Of Spaces

issue, Stanford's are considerably lower than those levied
by most of the other schools surveyed. â€¢
However, a majority of the schools charge faculty and
staff more than they do students. Such a system would be
more in line with prevailing attitudes here, where faculty
seem willing to pay about 40 percent more than students or
staff.
Interestingly, the amount people are willing to pay (both
for parking fees and violations fines) is closely linked to
how much they think parking costs the University: the
more they think it costs, the more they're willing to pay.
Students seem to have the largest misperceptions in this
area, often believing annual costs to be less than $100,000
when they in fact exceed $200,000.
Most other universities apply all parking income to
support their parking and transportation systems. A similar
user-supporter system is favored by the Stanford
community.
Space Allocation
Allocation of spaces is handled any number of ways at
other universities. Generally, faculty are given preferential
treatment in one way or another, e.g. closer-in spaces, full
access at all times.

Stanford faculty feel, more than any other group, that
such treatment is their due. Students prefer an egalitarian
system, while staff fall between the extremes.
The factors most commonly used by other schools to
assign spaces are almost identical with those the Stanford
community would like to see used here. They are
handicaps, first come-first served, driver's status (i.e.
student, faculty, staff), and carpool participation.
Secondary considerations include desirability of the space
and car size.
Methods and attitudes relative to enforcement vary
considerably, but trends do emerge. Violation fines are
generally higher at other schools. A majority of the
Stanford community has indicated that it would accept
fines up to $4, compared to the current $2 fine.
Several innovative solutions to parking problems have
been developed at other universities. Shuttle buses are used
at many schools to provide intra-campus transportation,
particularly at fairly large campuses. Other schools combine
reserved and "search" lots, often charging less for the latter
and/or placing such lots farther from the campus core.
Although none of the above should be construed as
definite statements of what our recommendations will be,
the data wiil be of enormous import in our final
suggestions. Having gathered the information, we will use it
in striving to strike a balance between conflicting attitudes
and desires. Ultimately, we hope to produce a system that
is equitable, efficient, and viable.
