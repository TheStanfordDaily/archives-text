# P.A. Chaplain Fired By Church Council
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Assoc. Chaplain Miriam Cherry was
fired this week after five years at St.
Ann's Catholic Chapel in Palo Alto.
The 8 to 0 vote by the church
council came after a heated four-hour
council meeting Monday night. There
were three abstentions. The council is
comprised of four Stanford students,
one faculty wife and six Palo Alto
residents.
Cherry's job included fulltime
ministry work at Stanford. She said
her work, termed "prophetic
ministry," involves "supporting justice
for oppressed people."
Cherry had worked closely with
minority groups on campus. She was
involved with the antiwar movement,
labor issues and women's issues.
In 1972 Cherry helped found the
Intercommunal Survival Committee in
Palo Alto. The group sponsored sickle
cell anemia testing in East Palo Alto
and food programs to the poor, and
established the Marie Hill Child Care
Center in Sunnyvale.
Council Intention
Richard Thesing, council chairman,
said the council "did not in any way
mean to vote against the type of
ministry she performed." He added,
"It is more a problem of her not being
able to work with other members of

the staff."
According to Cherry she was never
approached by her immediate
employer, campus Catholic minister
John Duryea. "My work was not being
objected to by the chaplain, but by
people not even connected with
Stanford," said Cherry. Duryea was
unavailable for comment.
Cherry said she was telephoned by
the council last week and told that the
regular monthly council meeting
would include a vote on whether to
retain her position.
'Personality Thing'
A secretary at St. Ann's said the
vote was originally to decide whether
to keep "prophetic ministry. Then it
became apparent that it was a
personality thing," she added.
Cherry said she was given no job
description when she was hired "other
than to assist Father Duryea. And he
was very loose," she added.
Cherry said her problems arose in
1971 when she sold Black Panther
newspapers in front of St. Ann's
"There were varied reactions from
indifference to 'Who's that woman
over there?' " said Cherry. She added
that "prophetic ministry" includes
establishing bonds with allegedly
oppressed people, such as the Black
