# Class Action Suit Better
##

li Steven Finkler ll
The Daily editorial encouraging individuals to fight
parking sticker violations, and discouraging a parking fee
assessment for a class action suit, was somewhat misleading
in two major respects.
First, fighting a parking ticket does not tie up the police
force. A court trial requires the presence of the issuer of the
citation; in most cases this is a civilian employee of the
Department.
Second, in endorsing the individual alternative over the
class action suit, you failed to point out the potential cost
to the individual. While paying a parking ticket costs only
$2, fighting and losing results in conviction of an offense
carrying a penalty of up to $50 plus court costs.
This, combined with the investment in time of the
individual in preparing his case, and going to the courthouse
to arrange a hearing, then to be arraigned, then to have a
trial, makes the whole effort entirely too great for all but
the most incurable of Don Quixote types.
I have seen few such people on this campus. Therefore
the class action suit, employing competent legal assistance
rather than mere student outrage, is vital.
