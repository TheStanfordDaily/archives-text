# University Frustrates Escondido Council Efforts
## 
### 
Village residents have objected to
the $10 per year vehicle registration
fee for years. During the school year
1972-3, the Escondido Village Council
(EVC) met several times with
representatives of the University's
police department to determine why
residents should be subjected to the
fee regulation.
The police department admitted
that there appeared to be no rationale
for the fee for Village residents.
The fee regulation was not enforced
in the Village during the following
year 1973-4. During the summer of
1974 the Governance Advisory
Committee (GAC) of the EVC was
told by Police Chief Marv Herrington
that he didn't like to ignore a
regulation and planned to enforce it
during 1974-5.
He was sympathetic with our
objections and suggested we write to
President Lyman.
Objections
In our letter we outlined our major
objections:
—the registration fee goes into the
General Fund and the Village receives
no monies from that fund;
—the effect of the Village sticker is
to exclude Escondido residents from
parking on most of the campus and it
is a bit much to be told to pay to be
excluded;
—there is nothing in the Village
rental contract that indicates a charge
for parking in the tenant's assigned
parking space;
—faculty and staff living in the
Village don't pay to park in front of
their apartments (they are issued free
stickers) and faculty living elsewhere
on campus are also not required to
pay.
No reply to any of these points was
ever received from Lyman, but an
announcement was made that the fee
was suspended for fall quarter.
Winter/Spring Fee
In November, Harrington showed
the Committee a flyer announcing the
$7.50 fee for winter and spring
quarters. He said the flyer would be
distributed within the week. It never
was. Instead, the date at the top was
changed to December and it was
distributed during the Christmas
break, December 29.
With very little time between the
announcement and the start of winter
quarter, the EVC contacted Provost
William Miller. After hearing the
problem, he suggested we talk to
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger.

After several refusals, Augsburger
finally agreed to see us. At the meeting
he said that the fee was inequitable and
unfair, but that he would not do
anything about it.
Ombudsman
The Ombudsman was contacted
several times. He spoke to members of
the administration but was unable to
get anywhere. We informed the
Ombudsman that we were considering
legal action and again asked him to see
if there were any other channels we
might try within the University system.
He again replied that he couldn't get
anywhere with the University officials.
A lawyer was hired with funds from
the EVC and ASSU. A boycott of the
sticker fee commenced and parking
tickets were collected and given to the
lawyer.

An injunction hearing was held but
the judge refused to stop the
University from issuing further tickets.
Another Meeting
On February 25, two EVC reps met
again with Augsburger, a meeting
arranged by the Ombudsman (who did
not attend) at our request. A plan was
proposed to split the registration fee.
Augsburger was not very receptive,
saying that we could not expect the
University to be fair and equal in all
things, but did ask for a written
proposal.
The written proposal suggesting a
split of 75 percent of the fees to go to
the Village and 25 percent to the
General Fund was sent. A reply has
been received saying that the split was
impossible because then other
residences would request a split. He

did suggest that the University might
offer more parking on the central
campus for residents during the spring
quarter.
The ASSU has proposed binding
arbitration on the fee question and
expects a reply by April 1. If the
University refuses to accept
arbitration, a fee assessment to
support a legal action will be placed on
the spring ballot giving all the students

Cathie Colson

a chance to express their opinion on
the way the University has handled
this question.
The registration fee next fall may
be $20, $40 or $100 (all these figures
have been mentioned in the parking
sub-committee).
The majority of students residing
on campus have no desire to park
anywhere but at their place of
residence, a space that has been paid
for in their rent.
We don't wish to pollute the
campus with more student cars. We
don't wish to continue subsidizing
faculty and staff who park on campus.
We would like to be able to leave
our cars at home in our paid-for spaces
without being hassled by extra fees to
subsidize pollution of the academic
campus.

the EVC and ASSU. A boycott of the
sticker fee commenced and parking
tickets were collected and given to the
lawyer.

An injunction hearing was held but
the judge refused to stop the
University from issuing further tickets.
Another Meeting
On February 25, two EVC reps met
again with Augsburger, a meeting
arranged by the Ombudsman (who did
not attend) at our request. A plan was
proposed to split the registration fee.
Augsburger was not very receptive,
saying that we could not expect the
University to be fair and equal in all
things, but did ask for a written
proposal.
The written proposal suggesting a
split of 75 percent of the fees to go to
the Village and 25 percent to the
General Fund was sent. A reply has
been received saying that the split was
impossible because then other
residences would request a split. He

did suggest that the University might
offer more parking on the central
campus for residents during the spring
quarter.
The ASSU has proposed binding
arbitration on the fee question and
expects a reply by April 1. If the
University refuses to accept
arbitration, a fee assessment to
support a legal action will be placed on
the spring ballot giving all the students

Cathie Colson

a chance to express their opinion on
the way the University has handled
this question.
The registration fee next fall may
be $20, $40 or $100 (all these figures
have been mentioned in the parking
sub-committee).
The majority of students residing
on campus have no desire to park
anywhere but at their place of
residence, a space that has been paid
for in their rent.
We don't wish to pollute the
campus with more student cars. We
don't wish to continue subsidizing
faculty and staff who park on campus.
We would like to be able to leave
our cars at home in our paid-for spaces
without being hassled by extra fees to
subsidize pollution of the academic
campus.


Cathie
Colson
is
Escondido
Village
Council
president.
Village residents have objected to
the $10 per year vehicle registration
fee for years. During the school year
1972-3, the Escondido Village Council
(EVC) met several times with
representatives of the University's
police department to determine why
residents should be subjected to the
fee regulation.
The police department admitted
that there appeared to be no rationale
for the fee for Village residents.
The fee regulation was not enforced
in the Village during the following
year 1973-4. During the summer of
1974 the Governance Advisory
Committee (GAC) of the EVC was
told by Police Chief Marv Herrington
that he didn't like to ignore a
regulation and planned to enforce it
during 1974-5.
He was sympathetic with our
objections and suggested we write to
President Lyman.
Objections
In our letter we outlined our major
objections:
—the registration fee goes into the
General Fund and the Village receives
no monies from that fund;
—the effect of the Village sticker is
to exclude Escondido residents from
parking on most of the campus and it
is a bit much to be told to pay to be
excluded;
—there is nothing in the Village
rental contract that indicates a charge
for parking in the tenant's assigned
parking space;
—faculty and staff living in the
Village don't pay to park in front of
their apartments (they are issued free
stickers) and faculty living elsewhere
on campus are also not required to
pay.
No reply to any of these points was
ever received from Lyman, but an
announcement was made that the fee
was suspended for fall quarter.
Winter/Spring Fee
In November, Harrington showed
the Committee a flyer announcing the
$7.50 fee for winter and spring
quarters. He said the flyer would be
distributed within the week. It never
was. Instead, the date at the top was
changed to December and it was
distributed during the Christmas
break, December 29.
With very little time between the
announcement and the start of winter
quarter, the EVC contacted Provost
William Miller. After hearing the
problem, he suggested we talk to
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger.

After several refusals, Augsburger
finally agreed to see us. At the meeting
he said that the fee was inequitable and
unfair, but that he would not do
anything about it.
Ombudsman
The Ombudsman was contacted
several times. He spoke to members of
the administration but was unable to
get anywhere. We informed the
Ombudsman that we were considering
legal action and again asked him to see
if there were any other channels we
might try within the University system.
He again replied that he couldn't get
anywhere with the University officials.

during 1974-5.
He was sympathetic with our
objections and suggested we write to
President Lyman.
Objections
In our letter we outlined our major
objections:
—the registration fee goes into the
General Fund and the Village receives
no monies from that fund;
—the effect of the Village sticker is
to exclude Escondido residents from
parking on most of the campus and it
is a bit much to be told to pay to be
excluded;
—there is nothing in the Village
rental contract that indicates a charge
for parking in the tenant's assigned
parking space;
—faculty and staff living in the
Village don't pay to park in front of
their apartments (they are issued free
stickers) and faculty living elsewhere
on campus are also not required to
pay.
No reply to any of these points was
ever received from Lyman, but an
announcement was made that the fee
was suspended for fall quarter.
Winter/Spring Fee
In November, Harrington showed
the Committee a flyer announcing the
$7.50 fee for winter and spring
quarters. He said the flyer would be
distributed within the week. It never
was. Instead, the date at the top was
changed to December and it was
distributed during the Christmas
break, December 29.
With very little time between the
announcement and the start of winter
quarter, the EVC contacted Provost
William Miller. After hearing the
problem, he suggested we talk to
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger.

After several refusals, Augsburger
finally agreed to see us. At the meeting
he said that the fee was inequitable and
unfair, but that he would not do
anything about it.
Ombudsman
The Ombudsman was contacted
several times. He spoke to members of
the administration but was unable to
get anywhere. We informed the
Ombudsman that we were considering
legal action and again asked him to see
if there were any other channels we
might try within the University system.
He again replied that he couldn't get
anywhere with the University officials.
A lawyer was hired with funds from
the EVC and ASSU. A boycott of the
sticker fee commenced and parking
tickets were collected and given to the
lawyer.

An injunction hearing was held but
the judge refused to stop the
University from issuing further tickets.
Another Meeting
On February 25, two EVC reps met
again with Augsburger, a meeting
arranged by the Ombudsman (who did
not attend) at our request. A plan was
proposed to split the registration fee.
Augsburger was not very receptive,
saying that we could not expect the
University to be fair and equal in all
things, but did ask for a written
proposal.
The written proposal suggesting a
split of 75 percent of the fees to go to
the Village and 25 percent to the
General Fund was sent. A reply has
been received saying that the split was
impossible because then other
residences would request a split. He

did suggest that the University might
offer more parking on the central
campus for residents during the spring
quarter.
The ASSU has proposed binding
arbitration on the fee question and
expects a reply by April 1. If the
University refuses to accept
arbitration, a fee assessment to
support a legal action will be placed on
the spring ballot giving all the students

a chance to express their opinion on
the way the University has handled
this question.
The registration fee next fall may
be $20, $40 or $100 (all these figures
have been mentioned in the parking
sub-committee).
The majority of students residing
on campus have no desire to park
anywhere but at their place of
residence, a space that has been paid
for in their rent.
We don't wish to pollute the
campus with more student cars. We
don't wish to continue subsidizing
faculty and staff who park on campus.
We would like to be able to leave
our cars at home in our paid-for spaces
without being hassled by extra fees to
subsidize pollution of the academic
campus.
