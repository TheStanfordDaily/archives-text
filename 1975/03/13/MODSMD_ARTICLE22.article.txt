# Dial-A-Ride Use Could Alleviate Problem
## 
### 
The issue of parking, which has recently been the
focus of so much attention on campus, is actually
only a symptom of a much larger problem. Simply
stated, we have more vehicles than the
ever-decreasing space provided for them.
The most satisfactory solutions to the problems
associated with this fact will be those that
incorporate a long term perspective. The
University's Planning Office has a master plan for
street and parking facilities which calls for the
gradual elimination of vehicles from the campus
core. Alterations in the parking fee structure should
be in harmony with that objective.
For aesthetic and safety reasons alone, the
concept of a car-free campus core and the removal
of on-street parking are both laudable suggestions.
But with the student body increasing in size by 50
percent and faculty-staff by 100 percent in the last
15 years, and with one third of on-campus students
now operating automobiles, we are about to be

overtaken with more serious problems.
A SWOPSI study conducted in March 1971
showed that an average of only 1.2 persons were
passengers on each car trip made on campus. The
transportation survey conducted by the Council of
Presidents last quarter showed no indication of any
increase in this figure. By only increasing this
average to 1.6 riders per vehicle, the number of
vehicles coming to the campus each day could be
cut from the usual 10,000 to below 7500.
Not Enough
Still, as on-campus housing is constructed and
new academic buildings are added, it will not be
enough to simply reduce the number of single-rider
automobiles coming to campus.
In the time between when the 1971 SWOPSI study was
conducted and last quarter's survey, the number of
students who said that they frequently walked to
get around on campus increased from roughly 60
percent up to 70 percent. More significantly, the
number of students who cited bicycling as their
preferred choice of campus transportation rose from
40 percent to well over 70 percent.
The tight housing market in the areas
immediately surrounding the University further
exacerbates the problem by forcing additional
numbers of students, faculty, and staff persons to
somehow commute considerable distances from
their homes.
Dial-A-Ride
It is unfortunate that a countywide transit
system, which may well be able to solve some of our
problems, was designed without considering
Stanford. What Santa Clara taxpayers know with
mixed emotions as Dial-A-Ride is more
sophisticated, expansive and expensive than any
similar system in the world.

The service provides demand-responsive
transportation through 35-passenger,
radio-dispatched buses which are requested in
advance by telephone. The buses will provide
door-to-door service within a large service area for 25
cents; trips outside the local service area are possible
without additional charge through transfers.
What Stanford stands to gain from this
unprecedented transportation experiment is a way
to immediately increase the passenger/vehicle ratio
on campus — and best of all, with no parking
problems.
Commuters Use
Off-campus commuters should find advantages in
being able to place a standing order for bus service
that will pick them up at home, drop them off
anywhere on campus and return them to their
doorstep at the end of the day — at prearranged
times, and for 25 cents.
The ASSU Office has available additional
information and maps detailing the Dial-A-Ride
service areas. At this time, possibilities for
campus-wide coordination of bus requests are being
explored — but they, too, are demand-responsive.
If the service could work for you, the best thing to
do is try it. You can order personalized transit
service anvwhere in the North County by dialing
965-3100.
If even the most conservative estimates are used,
each Dial-A-Ride trip can replace between five and
10 automobile trips on campus that would
otherwise be made.
The University community's ability, and more
importantly, willingness to gracefully incorporate
larger-scale transportation mechanisms will soon
dictate whether we are to have mass — or mess —
transit.

The issue of parking, which has recently been the
focus of so much attention on campus, is actually
only a symptom of a much larger problem. Simply
stated, we have more vehicles than the
ever-decreasing space provided for them.
The most satisfactory solutions to the problems
associated with this fact will be those that
incorporate a long term perspective. The
University's Planning Office has a master plan for
street and parking facilities which calls for the
gradual elimination of vehicles from the campus
core. Alterations in the parking fee structure should
be in harmony with that objective.
For aesthetic and safety reasons alone, the
concept of a car-free campus core and the removal
of on-street parking are both laudable suggestions.
But with the student body increasing in size by 50
percent and faculty-staff by 100 percent in the last
15 years, and with one third of on-campus students
now operating automobiles, we are about to be

overtaken with more serious problems.
A SWOPSI study conducted in March 1971
showed that an average of only 1.2 persons were
passengers on each car trip made on campus. The
transportation survey conducted by the Council of
Presidents last quarter showed no indication of any
increase in this figure. By only increasing this
average to 1.6 riders per vehicle, the number of
vehicles coming to the campus each day could be
cut from the usual 10,000 to below 7500.
Not Enough
Still, as on-campus housing is constructed and
new academic buildings are added, it will not be
enough to simply reduce the number of single-rider
automobiles coming to campus.
In the time between when the 1971 SWOPSI study was
conducted and last quarter's survey, the number of
students who said that they frequently walked to
get around on campus increased from roughly 60
percent up to 70 percent. More significantly, the
number of students who cited bicycling as their
preferred choice of campus transportation rose from
40 percent to well over 70 percent.
The tight housing market in the areas
immediately surrounding the University further
exacerbates the problem by forcing additional
numbers of students, faculty, and staff persons to
somehow commute considerable distances from
their homes.
Dial-A-Ride
It is unfortunate that a countywide transit
system, which may well be able to solve some of our
problems, was designed without considering
Stanford. What Santa Clara taxpayers know with
mixed emotions as Dial-A-Ride is more
sophisticated, expansive and expensive than any
similar system in the world.

Quinn Mayer

The service provides demand-responsive
transportation through 35-passenger,
radio-dispatched buses which are requested in
advance by telephone. The buses will provide
door-to-door service within a large service area for 25
cents; trips outside the local service area are possible
without additional charge through transfers.
What Stanford stands to gain from this
unprecedented transportation experiment is a way
to immediately increase the passenger/vehicle ratio
on campus — and best of all, with no parking
problems.
Commuters Use
Off-campus commuters should find advantages in
being able to place a standing order for bus service
that will pick them up at home, drop them off
anywhere on campus and return them to their
doorstep at the end of the day — at prearranged
times, and for 25 cents.
The ASSU Office has available additional
information and maps detailing the Dial-A-Ride
service areas. At this time, possibilities for
campus-wide coordination of bus requests are being
explored — but they, too, are demand-responsive.
