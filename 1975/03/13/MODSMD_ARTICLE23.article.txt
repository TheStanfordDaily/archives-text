# Budget Cuts: Ahead Of Plan But Worst Is Yet To Come
## 
### 
The University's budget-cutting campaign
moved out of the formative stage this quarter,
with initial cutbacks in the 1975-76 operating
budget, unveiled last week, overachieving the
program's goals.
The $10 million, three-year belt-tightening
campaign was formulated and initiated last
quarter when it became clear to University
finance officials that . expenses were
outgrowing income at a critical rate.
The $4 million in cutbacks in the proposed
budget surpassed program goals of $2.5
million for 1975-76. This is significant,
University officials note, because the sooner
funds can be cut out of the budget, the easier
it will be in the future to establish financial
equilibrium.
Despite this initial success, the University
was forced for the first time to borrow money
to construct and renovate aging facilities on
campus. This could result in up to $1 million
in fixed expenses in the operating budget for
the next 25 years, a long-range financial
commitment the University has managed to
avoid until now.

The 1975-76 budget will be $1.9 million in
the red, a loss which will wipe out what is left
of reserve funds. Reserves had stood at a
healthy $7.1 million in 1970.
Most of the cutbacks made in the new
budget were fairly obvious and less painful
than decisions still to be made. Cutbacks in
the 1976-77 budget will form the core of the
program and will necessarily have to chew
into academic budgets.
Administrative and support services'
budgets have borne a disproportionate share
of the budget cuts this year. Faculty members
will continue to ask that these services suffer
most of the cutbacks, though academic
programs cannot escape unscathed.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs announced intention this quarter to
scrap SWOPSI and SCIRE brought a howl of
protests from students. Faculty members
rumbled over admissions that tenure denials
were being motivated by pressing financial
constraints. Thirteen faculty positions will be
eliminated in the 1975-76 budget through
attrition.

United Stanford Employees (USE) union
leaders were not pleased with the
announcement of some June layoffs in Plant
Services. The union feels staff reduction can
be made through attrition and that the
University need not resort to layoffs. A total
of 83 staff positions will be eliminated in the
new budget, up to half of which probably will
result from layoffs.
Meanwhile, skyrocketing tuition rates were
decried by students predicting Stanford would
become the province solely of the rich. A $1.4
million increase in financial aid will offset this
tuition rise, administrators claim.
Tougher decisions remain to be made.
Administrators are organizing for next year's
budget cutting. Notices will be sent to
department and school deans in late spring
outlining the scope of cuts to be made next
year. The financial planners will have more
time to work on the second round of budget
cutting, and administrators have admitted that
they will need it.

be made through attrition and that the
University need not resort to layoffs. A total
of 83 staff positions will be eliminated in the
new budget, up to half of which probably will
result from layoffs.
Meanwhile, skyrocketing tuition rates were
decried by students predicting Stanford would
become the province solely of the rich. A $1.4
million increase in financial aid will offset this
tuition rise, administrators claim.
Tougher decisions remain to be made.
Administrators are organizing for next year's
budget cutting. Notices will be sent to
department and school deans in late spring
outlining the scope of cuts to be made next
year. The financial planners will have more
time to work on the second round of budget
cutting, and administrators have admitted that
they will need it.

The University's budget-cutting campaign
moved out of the formative stage this quarter,
with initial cutbacks in the 1975-76 operating
budget, unveiled last week, overachieving the
program's goals.
The $10 million, three-year belt-tightening
campaign was formulated and initiated last
quarter when it became clear to University
finance officials that . expenses were
outgrowing income at a critical rate.
The $4 million in cutbacks in the proposed
budget surpassed program goals of $2.5
million for 1975-76. This is significant,
University officials note, because the sooner
funds can be cut out of the budget, the easier
it will be in the future to establish financial
equilibrium.
Despite this initial success, the University
was forced for the first time to borrow money
to construct and renovate aging facilities on
campus. This could result in up to $1 million
in fixed expenses in the operating budget for
the next 25 years, a long-range financial
commitment the University has managed to
avoid until now.

The 1975-76 budget will be $1.9 million in
the red, a loss which will wipe out what is left
of reserve funds. Reserves had stood at a
healthy $7.1 million in 1970.
Most of the cutbacks made in the new
budget were fairly obvious and less painful
than decisions still to be made. Cutbacks in
the 1976-77 budget will form the core of the
program and will necessarily have to chew
into academic budgets.
Administrative and support services'
budgets have borne a disproportionate share
of the budget cuts this year. Faculty members
will continue to ask that these services suffer
most of the cutbacks, though academic
programs cannot escape unscathed.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs announced intention this quarter to
scrap SWOPSI and SCIRE brought a howl of
protests from students. Faculty members
rumbled over admissions that tenure denials
were being motivated by pressing financial
constraints. Thirteen faculty positions will be
eliminated in the 1975-76 budget through
attrition.

United Stanford Employees (USE) union
leaders were not pleased with the
announcement of some June layoffs in Plant
Services. The union feels staff reduction can
be made through attrition and that the
University need not resort to layoffs. A total
of 83 staff positions will be eliminated in the
new budget, up to half of which probably will
