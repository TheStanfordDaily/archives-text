## Aid Issue Question Of 'Equity' 
### 
Almost every voice heard in the
quarter-long debate over minority financial
aid has stressed one point — that the position
he/she represented was one which would
ensure equity.
The only problem was that few could agree
on what "equity" meant.
To the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid (C-UAFA),
which drafted a report in January, equity
means that low-income students should
receive aid based on need and not race.
To protesters of the C-UAFA decision,
including a group called (what else?) Students
for Equity, the word means that minority
students should continue to receive more
favorable aid packaging to alleviate an alleged
cultural disadvantage they suffer when coming
to Stanford.
In the end, the Faculty Senate decided that
neither conception of equity is totally
equitable. The Faculty Senate's decision,
made February 20, will give a limited number
of special benefits to minority low-income
students.
Specifically, the Faculty Senate plan means
that students in the lowest income groups will
be required to provide only $2400 in self-help
over four years — as opposed to $2850 for
other low income students.
Green Wonders
The Faculty Senate made its decision after
only a brief debate, causing Biology Prof. Paul
Green, the chairman of C-UAFA, to wonder
whether his group's carefully formulated
recommendations hadn't been dismissed too
easily.
But the Faculty Senate needed to act on
the draft report in February, because the
financial aids office was soon to begin
applications from prospective freshmen.
And the Faculty Senate wasn't just acting
on a report. It also took into consideration
the 150 students who sat outside the hall
"quietly making [their] presence felt," in the
words of one protester.
Effect Of Protests
During the week in which the Faculty
Senate made its decision, several
demonstrations protested the change.

Comments by senators made clear that the
demonstrations had an effect on the Senate's
decision.
Those protests, the first major airing of
gripes at Stanford since 1972, were fueled by
not only the cutback in minority financial aid,
but disclosure of a controversial memo
written by Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs.
Gibbs wrote that the aid cut would draw
minority students "more attuned to the
intellectual goals that we espouse and to the
elitist nature " of Stanford. After publication

of the memo, negative connotations of the
word "elitism" were used as a rallying point
for protestors of the aid cut.
At quarter's end, aid privileges for minority
students had been reduced, but not
eliminated. Neither the student protesters nor
the financial aids office (which must find
about $80,000 in additional revenue to fund
the new aid system) seemed totally satisfied
with the new system.
And the question of "what is equity?"
seemed further from resolution than ever.
