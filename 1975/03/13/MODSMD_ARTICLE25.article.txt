# Parking Fees Purchase ASSU's Ticket To Court
## 
### 
What began as a squabble over a $7.50
parking sticker quickly burgeoned this quarter
into a lawsuit costing the student body at
least $3000. And the price may run up to
$10,000 more if a fee assessment is voted this
spring to finance a major court battle between
students and the University.
For years now, the University has been
plagued with parking problems. Each year
parking was regulated by requiring students to
purchase $10 parking permits, while faculty
and staff parked for free. Although the
University had hoped to come up with a new
parking policy by last fall, the bureaucratic
labyrinth had prevented the new policy from
materializing. The parking fee was suspended
during fall quarter while alternatives were
explored.
During Christmas break, the old parking
policy was reinstituted, with a prorated fee of
$7.50 for winter and spring quarters. Students
were given until Jan. 20 to purchase the
stickers and affix them to their cars. Faculty
and staff were again issued their stickers free
of charge.
Led by President Cathie Colson, the
Escondido Village Council urged a student
boycott of purchase of the stickers. They also
requested that students vehicles were
cited for not displaying stickers challenge
their tickets in court.
But Stanford Police were not to be
deterred. Since Jan. 20, over 2000 tickets
have been issued to students, according to a

rough estimate by Director of Police Services
Marvin Herrington.
The Council had found the parking policy
grossly unfair. Colson claimed that the rental
agreement for Escondido Village already
allowed for one space per apartment, and the
additional parking fee was therefore
unjustified. She called it discriminatory for
students to have to pay for the same parking
privileges that faculty and staff receive free of
charge.
A $3000 legal fund from both the ASSU
and the Council sparked the move to court
action against the University. Retaining Palo
Alto attorney Dent Hand, the ASSU and the
Escondido Village Council filed a brief in
Santa Clara County Superior Court Jan. 31,
requesting a temporary restraining order to
prevent campus police from ticketing student
vehicles while the case was in litigation. The
brief also contained a request for a permanent
injunction against the parking policy.
However, the first crimp in the plaintiffs'
plans came on Feb. 7, when Judge Paul T.
Gallagher denied their request for a temporary
restraining order.
Colson, named as one of the plaintiffs in
the suit, said then that the setback would not
alter plans to go through with legal action.
Slightly two weeks later, though, the
$3000 legal fund was exhausted and the case
was in danger of being abandoned.
Last week, the ASSU Senate voted to send
the controversy to binding arbitration,
pending agreement by the University. A
deadline of April 1 has been set for response
by Stanford.
Should the administration not agree to
arbitration, a fee assessment will be placed on
the spring ballot. Passage could generate
approximately $10,000 in revenue for legal
action.
And yet, the University can't be expected
to collect a fee assessment to be used against
itself in court. If both arbitration and
assessment options backfire, the students may
be back where they started last January with
the same parking policy, the same stickers and
those same tickets.
