# More Housing Brings More Bitching While Frats Battle Their Cold War
## 
### 
Around the middle of winter quarter,
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton was on KZSU's Campus Conference,
saying for the umpteenth time that his
housing office was after a residence plan that
was "eminently fair."
"Fairness" and "equity" are words Horton
always has liked to associate with Stanford's
student residence system. But this quarter, like
most others during the current housing pinch,
found many students complaining that in
their dealings with Horton's office, they were
getting screwed.
The quarter, however, found Horton
making greater use of group decision making:
a subcommittee of the Committee on Services
to Students (COSS) collaborated on most
housing recommendations. But the group was
an ineffective shield; much of the vituperation
landed right on Horton as usual.
The new Stanford-in-Stanford program and
French theme house were given ZAP and
Guthrie houses, and residents there asked,
"Why us?" Preliminary drawings for three
new Row houses were found "unharmonious
with the basic appearance of the Row."
Construction began on 100 new units below
Florence Moore Hall, and dwellers there were

incensed at the noise. The COSS
subcommittee offered embattled fraternities a
reprieve from the draw, and the frats told the
group its report could be put to better use
lining a birdcage.
Consequently, if anyone didn't know
before, everyone discovered that housing at
Stanford was a no-win proposition.
The fraternity issue continued to dominate
the news. COSS spent three pages telling how
bad the "subjective selectivity" of fraternities
was for Stanford, then allowed the Greeks to
keep it because of "historical" considerations.
There was a catch, though. Fraternities
would have to meet quotas for new
membership, based on their "fair share" of
the housing shortage, or risk inclusion into the
draw.
Fratmen grudgingly accepted the burden,
but as the quarter ended were demanding an
arbitration board to oversee the process,
rather than allowing the dean of student
affairs final say. And the fraternities were
rejecting outright the wording of the COSS
report, which many of them suspected was
"another Horton job."
Horton's boss, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, took the heat on the sorority
issue. Some 20 undergraduate women were

propositioning Pan-Hellenia to return to
campus after a 31-year expulsion, and Lyons
told them to forget it if their plans included
the cursed "subjective selectivity." The
women now are considering a sorority theme
house in the draw, but basically the issue has
stalemated.
In the non-Greek world, the COSS report
would offer three years of guaranteed
on-campus housing to all students. The trade
off was that virtually everybody would lose
out during one undergraduate year.
More housing was in the offing —
eventually. As tempers flared in Flo Mo (one
resident accused Horton of a "multitude of
lies"), hard hats pounded out 100 additional
spaces in the breezeways for this fall. As soon
as architects can design three ideal Row
houses, construction of those 150 spaces for
fall 1976 will begin.
Some choice parcels already existent will
be in different hands next year. A residential
college and another theme house, this one in
which the residents look WASPish but talk
funny, were given physically autonomous
houses now held by non-theme groups.
Residents of the latter wondered aloud
whether students who wished to live amidst
diversity weren't being shuffled off to loving
Lucie Stern.

LARRY HORTON
Around the middle of winter quarter,
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Larry
Horton was on KZSU's Campus Conference,
saying for the umpteenth time that his
housing office was after a residence plan that
was "eminently fair."
"Fairness" and "equity" are words Horton
always has liked to associate with Stanford's
student residence system. But this quarter, like
most others during the current housing pinch,
found many students complaining that in
their dealings with Horton's office, they were
getting screwed.
The quarter, however, found Horton
making greater use of group decision making:
a subcommittee of the Committee on Services
to Students (COSS) collaborated on most
housing recommendations. But the group was
an ineffective shield; much of the vituperation
landed right on Horton as usual.
The new Stanford-in-Stanford program and
French theme house were given ZAP and
Guthrie houses, and residents there asked,
"Why us?" Preliminary drawings for three
new Row houses were found "unharmonious
with the basic appearance of the Row."
Construction began on 100 new units below
Florence Moore Hall, and dwellers there were

incensed at the noise. The COSS
subcommittee offered embattled fraternities a
reprieve from the draw, and the frats told the
group its report could be put to better use
lining a birdcage.
Consequently, if anyone didn't know
before, everyone discovered that housing at
Stanford was a no-win proposition.
The fraternity issue continued to dominate
the news. COSS spent three pages telling how
bad the "subjective selectivity" of fraternities
was for Stanford, then allowed the Greeks to
keep it because of "historical" considerations.
There was a catch, though. Fraternities
would have to meet quotas for new
membership, based on their "fair share" of
the housing shortage, or risk inclusion into the
draw.
Fratmen grudgingly accepted the burden,
but as the quarter ended were demanding an
arbitration board to oversee the process,
rather than allowing the dean of student
affairs final say. And the fraternities were
rejecting outright the wording of the COSS
report, which many of them suspected was
"another Horton job."
Horton's boss, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, took the heat on the sorority
issue. Some 20 undergraduate women were

propositioning Pan-Hellenia to return to
campus after a 31-year expulsion, and Lyons
told them to forget it if their plans included
the cursed "subjective selectivity." The
women now are considering a sorority theme
house in the draw, but basically the issue has
stalemated.
In the non-Greek world, the COSS report
would offer three years of guaranteed
on-campus housing to all students. The trade
off was that virtually everybody would lose
out during one undergraduate year.
More housing was in the offing —
eventually. As tempers flared in Flo Mo (one
resident accused Horton of a "multitude of
lies"), hard hats pounded out 100 additional
spaces in the breezeways for this fall. As soon
as architects can design three ideal Row
houses, construction of those 150 spaces for
fall 1976 will begin.
Some choice parcels already existent will
be in different hands next year. A residential
college and another theme house, this one in
which the residents look WASPish but talk
funny, were given physically autonomous
houses now held by non-theme groups.
Residents of the latter wondered aloud
