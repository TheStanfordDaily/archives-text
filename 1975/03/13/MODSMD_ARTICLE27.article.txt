# Grading Reformers Get 'E' For Effort, At Least
## 
### 
"Student GPA: About 3.5." The troubling
news appeared in the Daily five months ago.
Since then, the Registrar's Office has released
a slightly lower estimate of the typical
undergraduate's grade average (3.41), but this
didn't satisfy anyone either. And so D's may
be coming back next year.
Theoretically, at least, the whole grade
inflation controversy here had its origins in a
seemingly innocent evaluation of the new
grading system which the University adopted
in 1970.
But, as a part of its investigation, the Ad
Hoc Panel to Study the Grading System
decided to make a rough estimate of the
typical undergrad's GPA. Panel Chairman
Bradley Efron, a statistics professor, came up
with the figure 3.55. The word leaked out to
the Daily, and all hell broke loose.
Despite evidence that grade inflation is a
nationwide collegiate phenomenon, irate
faculty members and concerned students
demanded that immediate action be taken to
curb the trend at home.
Although each group examined the

problem from a different perspective, each
concluded that grades which are so uniformly
high simply aren't indicative of a student's
true performance in class.
Threat To Prestige
Professors regarded this as a threat to
Stanford's academic prestige, while students
feared that it would diminish their chances for
admission to law, medical and graduate
schools. Because of similarly severe grade
inflation at institutions such as Harvard, Yale,
Dartmouth, Cornell and Amherst, the
students probably had a more legitimate
concern.
Most observers, including graduate school
admissions officers, indicated that the
inflation would force admissions committees
to rely more heavily upon LSAT, MCAT and
GRE scores — data which some students
regard as relatively unreliable.
In response to this pressure, the Efron
Panel voted 5-4 in December to recommend
reinstatement of a recorded "no-credit" on
students' transcripts, as well as an earlier drop
deadline for courses. The Panel's report,
however, emphasized that its members did not
"believe that |the recommendations) will
have much corrective effect on grade
inflation."
C-AAA Grapples
But the Panel's parent body, the
Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA), still had to grapple
with the issue. And last week it settled upon
an entirely different set of recommendations,
the first of which is directly aimed at the
grade inflation predicament.
The Committee stated in its final report
that its proposal to reinstate the D grade
"might be an incentive to move the
distribution of grades downward from the
present concentration at the upper end." A
survey of grades given immediately prior to
the elimination of the D tends to bear out this
hypothesis.
It's unknown what students think about
bringing back the D: a special ASSU
referendum late last month only indicated
opposition to the Ad Hoc Panel's proposals,
which, of course, did not include the return of
the D.
The Faculty Senate will be the,final arbiter
of the grade issue, which it plans to discuss
next quarter. Opinion in the Senate seems to
be evenly divided: it could approve the
C-AAA proposal, revive the Panel's plan, or
scrap both and come up with a new system of
its own. The issue is just that complex.
