# The 						Quarter's Familiar Faces
## Three Share The Farm's Center Stage 
### 
It hasn't been an easy quarter for Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs. He's
insensitive to minorities' financial aid
requests, his opponents say, and he's phasing
out SWOPSI and SCIRE because they're
troublesome innovators.
And, not surprisingly, his image has
suffered. "His actions have reinforced various
opinions that I have had for a while," Black
Students Union President Mae Jemison
commented.
Martina Puente, a chicana who strongly
opposed a tightening of financial aid policies,
agreed that Gibbs' image "has not been helped
at all."
Even ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer,
who supports Gibbs' position on financial aid
though he disagrees with points in his
controversial memo, admits that his image has
suffered. States Mayer, "The minority
community has looked to him to champion
their causes," which he sometimes doesn't.
Though Gibbs' image has suffered, Assoc.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Mason
Yearian points out that his boss has been
"entirely consistent in his viewpoint."
To some minority students, consistently
wrong.

ASSU Special Events used to be a black
sheep in the ASSU money-making family. It
lost money regularly ($25,000 in 1972-73)
and depended upon fee assessments to survive.
In June 1973, something happened. That
something was Danny Scher, hired as
part-time special events director. Scher turned
the organization around — it showed a profit
of $55,000 last year, nearly one-ihird of the
ASSU's total net.
Scher will graduate from the Business
School in June, but ASSU President Mike
Herman wants to keep him working for the
ASSU. Scher, who says he plays with a band
on weekends to "make ends meet" now, has
asked for an annual salary of about $17,000
to handle the job fulltime.
Herman agreed, tying the Scher hiring to
the establishment of a full-time financial
manager's post. "The office dynamics of
having a full-time |special events} manager
responsible to a part-time financial manager
could prove disastrous," Herman argued.
When the Herman proposal came before
the ASSU Senate, it effectively met defeat
when the Senate postponed the matter
indefinitely.
"I've been tabled," Scher stated
matter-of-factly after the Senate action.

During a quarter which saw a rekindling of
protest spirit, the biggest congregation of all
gathered to enter a world of make-believe.
"The Great Cosmic Bird of the Universe,"
Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, lured
some 2300 to Memorial Auditorium for a
rerun of television history.
Of course, only 2000 of them got in, and
many of these weren't Stanfordites. As a
result, the ASSU Speakers Bureau changed its
seating policy for later lectures, but not in
time to stop some angered soul from venting
his frustrations on the whole Roddenberry
audience by forcing them outside with a
bomb threat.
Injection of that note of grim reality may
have brought some Trekkies back to Earth,
but it didn't dim their enthusiasm for
Roddenberry.
The Cosmic Bird himself wasn't too
enthused about network television executives,
some of whom aborted his creation a few
years back. But he said negotiations were
under way for a feature length film next year.
With the size and loyalty of the Trekky
cult now firmly established, even the detached
Mr. Spock would have to agree that the film
idea was only logical.
