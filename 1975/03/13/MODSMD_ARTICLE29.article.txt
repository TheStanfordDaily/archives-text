## 'Funny Lady's' Other Woman 
### LINDA GRIBBIN 
While most Stanford students were suffering
through their last week of classes, Heidi O'Rourke
was swimming in Miami with Flipper, the famous
dolphin.
If you think this smacks of Hollywood, you're
right. O'Rourke is on a promotion tour for Columbia
Pictures' Funny Lady in which she swam last June
(picture right-center). The $11 million sequel to
Funny Girl stars Barbra Streisand, James Caan and
Omar Sharif, tracing the life of comedienne Fanny
Brice.
O'Rourke, a junior German major here, portrays
Eleanor Holm, a 1932 Olympic swimming champion
who became the star of Billy Rose's aquacades and
Busby Berkeley film extravaganzas. She also swam
herself into Rose's heart, splashing cold water on his
marriage with Fanny.
Director Herb Ross traveled to Santa Rosa last
summer in search of a swimmer for the role of
Eleanor. He enlisted the help of Marion Kane, retired
coach of the San Francisco Merionettes, an amateur
synchronized swim team. Kane recalled 25 members
of the team and suggested O'Rourke, her prime
swimmer.

Ross and other Columbia executives inspected the
young women.
"It bothered me because I felt like I was on the
meat rack," said O'Rourke, who was told to lose
weight. "But I decided to play their game."
Two weeks later and 15 lbs. lighter she was given
the part.
The swim team went to Los Angeles, training eight
hours a day for four days. The scenes were then shot
from sunset to sunrise for three nights on a $1 million
set at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
In the film, Fanny, in a jealous fit, dons a silly
costume complete with water wings and tries to
upstage Eleanor during one of her swim numbers.
The water wings were a necessity: Streisand can't
swim and is afraid of the water, according to
O'Rourke. Streisand also insisted that the water
temperature be 92 degrees. It was raised to 88
degrees, which made it difficult for shooting because
of the steam created.
O'Rourke's Hollywood makeup and hairdo took
two-and-a-half hours to accomplish. She wore two
sets of eyelashes sprayed with resin so they would
Stay on in the water.
