## 'Funny Lady's' Other Woman 
### LINDA GRIBBIN 
While most Stanford students were suffering
through their last week of classes, Heidi O'Rourke
was swimming in Miami with Flipper, the famous
dolphin.
If you think this smacks of Hollywood, you're
right. O'Rourke is on a promotion tour for Columbia
Pictures' Funny Lady in which she swam last June
(picture right-center). The $11 million sequel to
Funny Girl stars Barbra Streisand, James Caan and
Omar Sharif, tracing the life of comedienne Fanny
Brice.
O'Rourke, a junior German major here, portrays
Eleanor Holm, a 1932 Olympic swimming champion
who became the star of Billy Rose's aquacades and
Busby Berkeley film extravaganzas. She also swam
herself into Rose's heart, splashing cold water on his
marriage with Fanny.
Director Herb Ross traveled to Santa Rosa last
summer in search of a swimmer for the role of
Eleanor. He enlisted the help of Marion Kane, retired
coach of the San Francisco Merionettes, an amateur
synchronized swim team. Kane recalled 25 members
of the team and suggested O'Rourke, her prime
swimmer.

Ross and other Columbia executives inspected the
young women.
"It bothered me because I felt like I was on the
meat rack," said O'Rourke, who was told to lose
weight. "But I decided to play their game."
Two weeks later and 15 lbs. lighter she was given
the part.
The swim team went to Los Angeles, training eight
hours a day for four days. The scenes were then shot
from sunset to sunrise for three nights on a $1 million
set at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
In the film, Fanny, in a jealous fit, dons a silly
costume complete with water wings and tries to
upstage Eleanor during one of her swim numbers.
The water wings were a necessity: Streisand can't
swim and is afraid of the water, according to
O'Rourke. Streisand also insisted that the water
temperature be 92 degrees. It was raised to 88
degrees, which made it difficult for shooting because
of the steam created.
O'Rourke's Hollywood makeup and hairdo took
two-and-a-half hours to accomplish. She wore two
sets of eyelashes sprayed with resin so they would
Stay on in the water.

"Still one came off and a diver had
to retrieve it," she said.
O'Rourke will tour nine cities in 13
days giving 5-minute exhibitions of her
swimming talents followed by press
conferences.
Columbia Pictures gave her a $650
clothes allowance from Saks Fifth
Avenue for the promotional tour. She
said one Columbia executive was
appalled when she showed up recently
in Hollywood with her backpack.
"Don't you have a purse?" he gasped.
O'Rourke swam as an amateur from
ages 10 to 17, winning 10 national
championships. She was awarded three
gold medals in the 1971 Pan-American
Games for solo, duet and team
synchronized swimming.
Before coming to Stanford two
years ago she went to Switzerland for
nine months to coach the Swiss
National Synchronized Swimming
Team and gave exhibitions throughout
Europe.

Director Herb Ross traveled to Santa Rosa last
summer in search of a swimmer for the role of
Eleanor. He enlisted the help of Marion Kane, retired
coach of the San Francisco Merionettes, an amateur
synchronized swim team. Kane recalled 25 members
of the team and suggested O'Rourke, her prime
swimmer.

Ross and other Columbia executives inspected the
young women.
"It bothered me because I felt like I was on the
meat rack," said O'Rourke, who was told to lose
weight. "But I decided to play their game."
Two weeks later and 15 lbs. lighter she was given
the part.
The swim team went to Los Angeles, training eight
hours a day for four days. The scenes were then shot
from sunset to sunrise for three nights on a $1 million
set at the Los Angeles Coliseum.
In the film, Fanny, in a jealous fit, dons a silly
costume complete with water wings and tries to
upstage Eleanor during one of her swim numbers.
The water wings were a necessity: Streisand can't
swim and is afraid of the water, according to
O'Rourke. Streisand also insisted that the water
temperature be 92 degrees. It was raised to 88
degrees, which made it difficult for shooting because
of the steam created.
O'Rourke's Hollywood makeup and hairdo took
two-and-a-half hours to accomplish. She wore two
sets of eyelashes sprayed with resin so they would
Stay on in the water.

"Still one came off and a diver had
to retrieve it," she said.
O'Rourke will tour nine cities in 13
days giving 5-minute exhibitions of her
swimming talents followed by press
conferences.
Columbia Pictures gave her a $650
clothes allowance from Saks Fifth
Avenue for the promotional tour. She
said one Columbia executive was
appalled when she showed up recently
in Hollywood with her backpack.
"Don't you have a purse?" he gasped.
O'Rourke swam as an amateur from
ages 10 to 17, winning 10 national
championships. She was awarded three
gold medals in the 1971 Pan-American
Games for solo, duet and team
synchronized swimming.
Before coming to Stanford two
years ago she went to Switzerland for
nine months to coach the Swiss
National Synchronized Swimming
Team and gave exhibitions throughout
Europe.
While most Stanford students were suffering
through their last week of classes, Heidi O'Rourke
was swimming in Miami with Flipper, the famous
dolphin.
If you think this smacks of Hollywood, you're
right. O'Rourke is on a promotion tour for Columbia
Pictures' Funny Lady in which she swam last June
(picture right-center). The $11 million sequel to
Funny Girl stars Barbra Streisand, James Caan and
Omar Sharif, tracing the life of comedienne Fanny
Brice.
O'Rourke, a junior German major here, portrays
Eleanor Holm, a 1932 Olympic swimming champion
who became the star of Billy Rose's aquacades and
Busby Berkeley film extravaganzas. She also swam
herself into Rose's heart, splashing cold water on his
marriage with Fanny.
