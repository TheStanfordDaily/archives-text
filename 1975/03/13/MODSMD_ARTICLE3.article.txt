# McCloskey Defends Aid Stance
## 
### PETER KRETZMAN 
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), admitting that if he couldn't
make his views "stand up before | his |
constituents," he would have "to bring
that factor to the attention of the
Congress," defended his
pro-Cambodian aid position last
Friday to a largely hostile overflow
audience in Cubberley Auditorium.
McCloskey came out in favor of
extending American military aid to
Cambodia through June 1 after

returning from a recent 10-day
congressional tour of Southeast Asia.
The statement constituted a reversal of
his previous position.
Crowd reaction was
anti-McCloskey, with boos and hisses
predominant. "We've heard this all
before," shouted several as McCloskey
emphasized his stance that "not a
penny more" be given to Cambodia
after June 1.
At various points during the speech,
one audience member would rise and

scream at McCloskey. "What deal did
you make for what position," she
shouted finally, and then smiled in
satisfaction.
Laughs of scorn and derision met
many of McCloskey's remarks,
particularly when he mentioned the
press coverage of the Cambodian tour.
McCloskey admitted that "none of
us (on the tour) could become experts
in the mere seven hours we spent
there." He related conversations with
Cambodians fleeing from the Khmer
Rouge insurgents, describing incidents
of "indiscriminate execution following
a [Khmer Rouge] village takeover."
All of the refugees with whom he
had spoken, said McCloskey, had fled
because of their fear of the Khmer
Rouge. McCloskey called that fear
"the single factor that caused three of
the eight congressmen there to change
their minds in favor of increased aid."
McCloskey predicted that 30,000
people would die in fighting between
now and the start of monsoon season
June 1 if aid were given. "My
judgment is that more will be killed if
|the Phnom Penh] perimeter is now
overrun. It's a question only God can
answer," he said.
"It's awfully difficult," he said, "to
sit on the Stanford campus, or even in
Washington, for that matter, and try
to understand the people of
Cambodia, and their fear of the Khmer
Rouge."
Referring to President Gerald
Ford's press conference last Thursday,
he stated that "it is quite clear that the
message of outrage towards any more
aid that I delivered to Ford from my
constituents did not get through."
"My decision doesn't have a damn
thing to do with American
credibility," said McCloskey.
Later, McCloskey asked for a hand
showing of those who agreed with his
position. Less than 10 percent of the
audience, according to McCloskey's
own count, expressed such agreement,
with the rest in favor of giving no
more aid.
