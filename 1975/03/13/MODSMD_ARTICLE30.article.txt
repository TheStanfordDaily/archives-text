# Experience Spiritual Soul Travel With Eckankar...
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
"You don't think of it as
science, or religion. It's just the
way things are."
The way things are for Doup
Brightwell, a local photographer
is Eckankar — a spiritual discipline
explained as "the ancient science
of soul travel" by its practitioners.
Claimed to be the forerunriei
of all present religions, the
modern Eckankar movement was
founded in 1965 by Paul
Twitchell, a former public
relations man who was trained by
a Tibetan master, Rebazar Tarzs.
Today there are nearly one
million students of Eckankar.
According to Brightwell, San
Francisco is second only to Los
Angeles in number of students
and approximately 150 students
meet at the Palo Alto Eckankar
Center, 880 Emerson St.
Planes Of Existence
Psychic phenomena and
supernatural powers are not part
of the Eckankar training. "It's a
spiritual path," says Brightwell.
"We're not interested in
phenomena or ESP."
Eckankar views extrasensory
powers as part of the second or
"astral plane," a mental level
which they feel is undesirable.
Brightwell believes that famed
Israeli psychic Uri Geller may be
"trapped" on the astral plane.
"If he stays there for too long,
he's stuck," warns Brightwell.
"He's not on the way."
Trapped On Mental Plane
Brightwell believes that most
Stanford students may be
"trapped" on yet another plane —
the "mental plane."
"At colleges and universities
they over-emphasize the
development of the mental body
to the neglect of spiritual matters
and emotions," argues Brightwell.
The university, according to
Brightwell, "establishes a group
consciousness," with an emphasis
on competition and development
of purely mental, analytical
faculties.
In addition to the physical,
astral and mental planes,
Eckankar teaches that there is
another lower plane, the "causal
plane," which houses memory.
Brightwell explains that spiritual
growth in part entails the
"dropping of attitudes" which
one has learned over time.
No Prejudices
He cites any form of prejudice
— even things as seemingly
insignificant as his own former
dislike of the color red — as a
major setback to spiritual growth.

The physical plane offers "only
a paJe reflection of what's going
on the inner planes," according to
Brightwell. Properly perceived, he
believes "every microsecond of
your life is a spiritual experience."
On the soul plane, students of
Eckankar experience what
Brightwell calls "total awareness
of self. It's not fragmented, it's
complete." He contrasts this with
the purely mental understanding
of the self which is taught at
universities.
It is on the soul plane that
Eckankar students are taught to
"travel," to send their soul out of
their body to places and worlds
undetectable in the physical
universe. .
Soul Travel
According to Brightwell,
founder Paul Twitchell discovered
in his studies that "throughout

history, most of the people that
achieved something spiritual did it
through out-of-the-body
experience or soul travel."
Eckankar teaches that soul
travel is the most direct means of
spiritual growth, citing yoga and
normal meditational practice as
less direct methods.
"Buddhists and Hindus, we
believe, never get past the mental
plane," says Brightwell. He feels
that eastern religions are often
caught in "purely cultural
trappings."
Central to Eckankar is the
concept of a living master,
analogous to a guru or perhaps the
Pope, but having vastly superior
powers. The present living
ECK-master is Twitchell's
successor, Darwin Gross.
Gross, prior to assuming
Twitchell's post in 1971, was an

electrical engineer. He first
became active in Eckankar in
1969, although it is claimed that
he was selected by Twitchell to
head the movement many years
previously through meetings
between the two on the soul
plane.
Individual Emphasis
As Living ECK-master, Gross
has responsibility for teaching
Eckankar's million students not
only on the physical plane, but
also on the other planes.
According to Brightwell, Gross
visits his students on the soul
plane and offers them individual
instruction in Eckankar.
In Eckankar, "the individual is
not sacrificed for the masses,"
says Brightwell. Because of this,
he explains that each Eckankar
student may well have totally
different experiences from any

other student's and be taught by
totally different methods.
A further indication of the
individual emphasis is the
movement's lack of concern about
new recruits. "We don't get into
the area of evangelizing or
recruiting members," says
Brightwell.
Officially a non-profit
corporation, Eckankar operates
largely on a volunteer basis with
no official hierarchy or officers.
The Palo Alto center is, according
to Brightwell, "just a physical
place to hold classes."
On the physical plane, the
world headquarters of Eckankar
will soon be moving from Las
Vegas to Menlo Park, at which
time Brightwell claims that Menlo
Park will in fact become "the
spiritual center of the universe."
