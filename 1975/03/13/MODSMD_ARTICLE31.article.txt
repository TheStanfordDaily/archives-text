# Bug Me

### Patty Fels 
There seems to be a lack of establishments in
Palo Alto or nearby where one can dance.
Know of any? —L.L.
Not many. The Daily's favorite place is
Ethen's — a classy bar across from
L'Omelette where drinks are cheap and you
can dance your heart out to an original
collection of jukebox hits. Sam, the
bartender, is a friendly guy and the crowd is,
well, unusual.
If you wouldn't be caught dead in a Daily
hang-out, here are a few other suggestions:
— Sophie's, 260 California Ave. in Palo
Alto — there is a different live rock 'n' roll
band every night, and supposedly a lot of
people dance:
— Tia Maria, 4470 Ei Camino in Los Altos
— rumored to have a good soul combo which
is "not original but smooth," and a dance
floor;
— The Bucket, 3924 El Camino in Palo
Alto — described as having "good, old-time,
'get down' music";
— Balkan Village, 4898 El Camino in Los
Altos — a Greek restaurant, with traditional
Greek dancing in which the audience is
encouraged to participate;
— Nashville West, 193 Commercial St. in
Sunnyvale — has two bands on weekends,
one country and one rock in separate rooms,
and five dance floors.
And that's about all. One final suggestion
which came to us anonymously is The
Transition, where, according to the unnamed
informant, "you can tango with a salad bowl

and have the floor all to yourself."
I have just graduated and want to donate a
tree or plant to the University with
accompanying plaque so that my name will
be immortalized at Stanford. Whom do I
contact? — L.L.
Donating a tree is no problem. Dan
DeYoung, in Plant Services, said that he and
his staff will be glad to plant any donated
trees. You should buy the tree at a local
nursery and then contact them. According to
DeYoung, a tree can be purchased for as little
as $2.
However, Marjorie Manning in the office of
Donor and Institutional Relations, said that
the University is trying to discourage people
from putting plaques bv their trees, although
this has been done in the past. She noted that
a plaque costs from $75 to $100, and the
University could put that money to better
use in other areas.
"If we do it for a lot of people, the place
is going to look like a graveyard," Manning
said. "It's very understandable that people do
care but there are so many great needs of the
University at this time."
She suggested donating money to the
libraries, where your name will be
immortalized on special bookplates.
In Tuesday's Bug Me," you said there was
no place to recycle paper in the Palo Alto
area. Not quite true. The Community
Association for the Retarded (3864
Middle fie Id in Palo Alto) has large bins

available for newspaper deposits. These are
located behind Spangler School on
Charleston Road, around the corner from
Middlefield. Telephone books can also be
deposited in the C.A.R. bins after the covers
are torn off. C.A.R. sells the newspapers and
uses the money to support its work with
autistic children —J.T.
Sorry about the error. We also found out
that the city recycling center (at the end of
Embarcadero Road, across Bayshore) accepts
newspapers, and also untreated office paper
and computer cards. Still no place for
magazines, though.
What happened to the picture of J. Henry
Meyer that used to hang in the en try way of
UGLY, just past the turnstiles? —C.N.S.
The picture "went on a little Bender,"
according to Detective Don Lillie of the
Stanford Police Department. During spring
quarter of last year, it disappeared from the
library. On graduation day, the police found
it outside the door with a note, saying that it
was time to come home to its resting place.
Lillie said that the picture was undamaged
and that the police returned it to the library.
The library is waiting to rehang the
picture because of a "rash of rip-offs" that
occurred last fall quarter. "They just took
everything that wasn't nailed down, including
the fire exit signs," said Jack Pooler, acting
head librarian at Meyer. "Future plans are to
put it [the Meyer portrait| up in a secure
way so that it can't be removed."

well, unusual.
If you wouldn't be caught dead in a Daily
hang-out, here are a few other suggestions:
— Sophie's, 260 California Ave. in Palo
Alto — there is a different live rock 'n' roll
band every night, and supposedly a lot of
people dance:
— Tia Maria, 4470 Ei Camino in Los Altos
— rumored to have a good soul combo which
is "not original but smooth," and a dance
floor;
— The Bucket, 3924 El Camino in Palo
Alto — described as having "good, old-time,
'get down' music";
— Balkan Village, 4898 El Camino in Los
Altos — a Greek restaurant, with traditional
Greek dancing in which the audience is
encouraged to participate;
— Nashville West, 193 Commercial St. in
Sunnyvale — has two bands on weekends,
one country and one rock in separate rooms,
and five dance floors.
And that's about all. One final suggestion
which came to us anonymously is The
Transition, where, according to the unnamed
informant, "you can tango with a salad bowl

and have the floor all to yourself."
I have just graduated and want to donate a
tree or plant to the University with
accompanying plaque so that my name will
be immortalized at Stanford. Whom do I
contact? — L.L.
Donating a tree is no problem. Dan
DeYoung, in Plant Services, said that he and
his staff will be glad to plant any donated
trees. You should buy the tree at a local
nursery and then contact them. According to
DeYoung, a tree can be purchased for as little
as $2.
However, Marjorie Manning in the office of
Donor and Institutional Relations, said that
the University is trying to discourage people
from putting plaques bv their trees, although
this has been done in the past. She noted that
a plaque costs from $75 to $100, and the
University could put that money to better
use in other areas.
"If we do it for a lot of people, the place
is going to look like a graveyard," Manning
said. "It's very understandable that people do
care but there are so many great needs of the
University at this time."
She suggested donating money to the
libraries, where your name will be
immortalized on special bookplates.
In Tuesday's Bug Me," you said there was
no place to recycle paper in the Palo Alto
area. Not quite true. The Community
Association for the Retarded (3864
Middle fie Id in Palo Alto) has large bins

available for newspaper deposits. These are
located behind Spangler School on
Charleston Road, around the corner from
Middlefield. Telephone books can also be
deposited in the C.A.R. bins after the covers
are torn off. C.A.R. sells the newspapers and
uses the money to support its work with
autistic children —J.T.
Sorry about the error. We also found out
that the city recycling center (at the end of
Embarcadero Road, across Bayshore) accepts
newspapers, and also untreated office paper
and computer cards. Still no place for
magazines, though.
What happened to the picture of J. Henry
Meyer that used to hang in the en try way of
UGLY, just past the turnstiles? —C.N.S.
The picture "went on a little Bender,"
according to Detective Don Lillie of the
Stanford Police Department. During spring
quarter of last year, it disappeared from the
library. On graduation day, the police found
it outside the door with a note, saying that it
was time to come home to its resting place.
Lillie said that the picture was undamaged
and that the police returned it to the library.
The library is waiting to rehang the
picture because of a "rash of rip-offs" that
occurred last fall quarter. "They just took
everything that wasn't nailed down, including
the fire exit signs," said Jack Pooler, acting
head librarian at Meyer. "Future plans are to
put it [the Meyer portrait| up in a secure
way so that it can't be removed."

There seems to be a lack of establishments in
Palo Alto or nearby where one can dance.

Not many. The Daily's favorite place is
Ethen's — a classy bar across from

can dance your heart out to an original
