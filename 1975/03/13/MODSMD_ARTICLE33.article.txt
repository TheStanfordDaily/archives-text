# Or Grasp Inner Joy With Swami Chinmayananda
## 
### SRI KRISHN CHOPRA 
"What is my technique? My
technique is to stand on my nose
and meditate. But I practice it
only in private!"
Swami Chinmayananda laughs
impishly through his graying
beard. Then suddenly he
thunders, "If you are looking for
shortcuts to spiritualism or instant
psychedelic happenings, you have
made a mistake today. But don't
repeat it: DONT COME
TOMORROW."
But they all did come the next
day. And the day after the
next.... Skilling Auditorium at
Stanford overflowed with some
300 people every evening between
7:30 and 9:30 from February 22
to March 2 to listen to Swami
Chinmayananda's free discourses
on the Bhagavad Gita.
Self-Discipline
"And the Gita," the Swami
repeatedly points out in his
vigorous, impeccable English, "is
not meant for effete drop-outs
who are good neither for man nor
God. It is meant for the energetic
and the alert, willing to go
through self-discipline to attain
the highest state of
consciousness."
The Swami's exposition of the
Gita is succinctly depicted on a
two-foot-by-three-foot blue-board
which sits next to him during his
lectures.
At the top of the board is OM,
the highest state of consciousness.
"Call it God, or Allah, or alpha,
that doesn't matter," he says.

The OA/, according to the
Swami, "is in all of us. But we do
not know about its existence
because, uasanas (desires) keep
our mirds in a constant state of
agitation."
Quiet Vasanas
The Swami notes that varying
degrees of vasanas are perpetually
generated in us because of the
attachment of our faculties; the
body, mind and intellect (BMI),
to the outer world of objects,
emotions and thoughts (OET).
"The first step therefore in any
spiritual endeavor towards
attaining self-realization, is to
quiet the mind by exhausting its
existing uasanas and then
preventing a generation of fresh
uasanas," the Swami points out.
"This is a slow and an arduous
process involving the
self-disciplined diversion of the
body, mind and intellect from the
outer world of objects, emotions
and thoughts to the OA/ within us.
The Gita prescribes practical
guidelines for quieting the
mind's turmoil for all categories
of people burdened with different
degress of uasanas."
The Swami explains the subtle
prescription of the Gita by gently
swaying his audience from
raptures of deep thought to bouts
of hilarious laughter with his
inimitable brand of mischievous
humor.
"Chewing-gum in the mouth,
Coke in the hand, television in the
bathroom — you can't buy instant
happiness like vou buv cookies in
the supermarket!" the Swami

proclaims.
He insists on understanding the
path of knowledge because that
was the way he himself evolved.
In 1941 his name was Balakrishna
Menon, the son of a w althy
judge, and he was a post-graduate
in law and literature as well as a
fiercely ambitious journalist and a
socialist.
"I believed religion was a
danger to society," he says of his
thoughts back then.
Skeptic To Activist
The skeptic in him made him

seek out spiritual masters in the
Himalayas, "not to gain
knowledge but to find out how
they were keeping their bluff
among the masses."
But instead of meeting
charlatans as he had expected, he
encountered men of rare greatness
and found himself "caught up" in
the beliefs. "Therefore, I wanted
to study deeper and give my life
to it,"he adds.
Balakrishna spent seven years
of his youth in the numbing cold
of the Himalayas learning the

Vedanta (the essence of
Hinduism) at the feet of some of
the greatest masters of time. He
was then transformed into a new
man, Swami Chinmayananda,
which means bliss attained
through knowledge.
The depth of new conviction
from this knowledge made him
give up the serene atmosphere in
the Himalayas and enter into the
"whirlwind of activity" which has
filled the past 20 years of his life.
Swami Chinmayananda has
organized the famous Sandeepany

Sadhanalva Ashram in Bombay
where hundreds of students from
all over the worid are taught free
of charge. He supervises countless
welfare projects, hospitals and
other social programs all over
India for "alleviating the suffering
of the poor."
inner Peace'
But while the Swami's life may
be as busy as that of the busiest
American executive, the
difference is his "inner peace, joy
and selflessness." He thus
practices what he preaches by
epitomizing the message of the
Gita: to be outwardly active
while being inwardly serene.
Also a prolific writer, he has
written some 30 books on the
Gita and other aspects of Hindu
philosophy, though he dismisses
this achievement with, "I never
write books. They come through
me.
But he does make a big deal
about the 70 to 80 letters he
writes by hand each day,
answering queries from his
followers.
"You know why I write them
myself instead of getting them
typewritten?" he winks. "Because
the moment the disciple receives a
hand-written letter from the
SWAMI himself, he is completely
sold and sealed to me!"
His joke about disciples
reemphasizes what he keeps
reminding them all the time.
"I can only point the way," he
says, "but the experience has to
be your very own. DONT LEAN

ON ME. Get whatever you can
from the Swami, then leave him
alone to point the way to others
like you."
American Slang
That is why he refuses to start
his ashrams (religious instructions)
in America, like most of the other
Gurus. "I don't want to start
monuments for myself,
goddammit!" he emphasizes.
His facility with American
slang and other earthy expressions
startles in the beginning but soon
his humorous explanation sinks
in. "A Swami may have his head
high above everyone. But how can
he point the way unless his legs
are knee-deep in life?"
So, during the more subtle and
weary moments of his discourses,
when many a mentally-tired
listener closes his eyes, the
Swami's powerful voice quickly
jolts him back to wakefulness.
"Don't think you can fool me
by dozing off and trying to give
the impression that you are
meditating." Then in an aside,
"That's because I do it myself!"
Speaking of the meditation
technique he mentioned on the
first day, the Swami explains "All
you have to do is to flatten your
nose on the ground, raise your
hands and legs in the air, and
that's the standing-on-the-nose
technique which will take you
straight to God."
Then he surveys the quizzical
looks all around him. "Do you
guys think I am kidding?" And
the room vibrates with his impisH
laughter once again.

THE SWAMI—As part of his once-a-year-world-tour, Swami Chinmayananda spent 10 days lecturing at
Stanford. Heralded as the "holiest spiritual master from India," by publicity blurbs, the swami can be
both serious and light-hearted. As one of his disciples puts it, "You see, he isn't like the other gurus."
"What is my technique? My

generated in us because of the
attachment of our faculties; the
body, mind and intellect (BMI),
to the outer world of objects,
emotions and thoughts (OET).
"The first step therefore in any
spiritual endeavor towards
attaining self-realization, is to
quiet the mind by exhausting its
existing uasanas and then
preventing a generation of fresh
uasanas," the Swami points out.
"This is a slow and an arduous
process involving the
self-disciplined diversion of the
body, mind and intellect from the
outer world of objects, emotions
and thoughts to the OA/ within us.
The Gita prescribes practical
guidelines for quieting the
mind's turmoil for all categories
of people burdened with different
degress of uasanas."
The Swami explains the subtle
prescription of the Gita by gently
swaying his audience from
raptures of deep thought to bouts
of hilarious laughter with his
inimitable brand of mischievous
humor.
"Chewing-gum in the mouth,
Coke in the hand, television in the
bathroom — you can't buy instant
happiness like vou buv cookies in
the supermarket!" the Swami

proclaims.
He insists on understanding the
path of knowledge because that
was the way he himself evolved.
In 1941 his name was Balakrishna
Menon, the son of a w althy
judge, and he was a post-graduate
in law and literature as well as a
fiercely ambitious journalist and a
socialist.
"I believed religion was a
danger to society," he says of his
thoughts back then.
Skeptic To Activist
The skeptic in him made him

seek out spiritual masters in the
Himalayas, "not to gain
knowledge but to find out how
they were keeping their bluff
among the masses."
But instead of meeting
charlatans as he had expected, he
encountered men of rare greatness
and found himself "caught up" in
the beliefs. "Therefore, I wanted
to study deeper and give my life
to it,"he adds.
Balakrishna spent seven years
of his youth in the numbing cold
of the Himalayas learning the

Vedanta (the essence of
Hinduism) at the feet of some of
the greatest masters of time. He
was then transformed into a new
man, Swami Chinmayananda,
which means bliss attained
through knowledge.
The depth of new conviction
from this knowledge made him
give up the serene atmosphere in
the Himalayas and enter into the
"whirlwind of activity" which has
filled the past 20 years of his life.
Swami Chinmayananda has
organized the famous Sandeepany

Sadhanalva Ashram in Bombay
where hundreds of students from
all over the worid are taught free
of charge. He supervises countless
welfare projects, hospitals and
other social programs all over
India for "alleviating the suffering
of the poor."
inner Peace'
But while the Swami's life may
be as busy as that of the busiest
American executive, the
difference is his "inner peace, joy
and selflessness." He thus
practices what he preaches by
epitomizing the message of the
Gita: to be outwardly active
while being inwardly serene.
Also a prolific writer, he has
written some 30 books on the
Gita and other aspects of Hindu
philosophy, though he dismisses
this achievement with, "I never
write books. They come through
me.
But he does make a big deal
about the 70 to 80 letters he
writes by hand each day,
answering queries from his
followers.
"You know why I write them
myself instead of getting them
typewritten?" he winks. "Because
the moment the disciple receives a
hand-written letter from the
SWAMI himself, he is completely
sold and sealed to me!"
His joke about disciples
reemphasizes what he keeps
reminding them all the time.
"I can only point the way," he
says, "but the experience has to
be your very own. DONT LEAN

ON ME. Get whatever you can
from the Swami, then leave him
alone to point the way to others
like you."
American Slang
That is why he refuses to start
his ashrams (religious instructions)
in America, like most of the other
Gurus. "I don't want to start
monuments for myself,
goddammit!" he emphasizes.
His facility with American
slang and other earthy expressions
startles in the beginning but soon
his humorous explanation sinks
in. "A Swami may have his head
high above everyone. But how can
he point the way unless his legs
are knee-deep in life?"
So, during the more subtle and
weary moments of his discourses,
when many a mentally-tired
listener closes his eyes, the
Swami's powerful voice quickly
jolts him back to wakefulness.
"Don't think you can fool me
by dozing off and trying to give
the impression that you are
meditating." Then in an aside,
"That's because I do it myself!"
Speaking of the meditation
technique he mentioned on the
first day, the Swami explains "All
you have to do is to flatten your
nose on the ground, raise your
hands and legs in the air, and
that's the standing-on-the-nose
technique which will take you
straight to God."
Then he surveys the quizzical
looks all around him. "Do you
guys think I am kidding?" And
the room vibrates with his impisH
laughter once again.

THE SWAMI—As part of his once-a-year-world-tour, Swami Chinmayananda spent 10 days lecturing at
Stanford. Heralded as the "holiest spiritual master from India," by publicity blurbs, the swami can be
both serious and light-hearted. As one of his disciples puts it, "You see, he isn't like the other gurus."
"What is my technique? My
technique is to stand on my nose
and meditate. But I practice it
only in private!"
Swami Chinmayananda laughs
impishly through his graying
beard. Then suddenly he
thunders, "If you are looking for
shortcuts to spiritualism or instant
psychedelic happenings, you have
made a mistake today. But don't
repeat it: DONT COME
TOMORROW."
But they all did come the next
day. And the day after the
next.... Skilling Auditorium at
Stanford overflowed with some
300 people every evening between
7:30 and 9:30 from February 22
to March 2 to listen to Swami
Chinmayananda's free discourses
on the Bhagavad Gita.
Self-Discipline
"And the Gita," the Swami
repeatedly points out in his
vigorous, impeccable English, "is
not meant for effete drop-outs
who are good neither for man nor
God. It is meant for the energetic
and the alert, willing to go
through self-discipline to attain
the highest state of
consciousness."
The Swami's exposition of the
Gita is succinctly depicted on a
two-foot-by-three-foot blue-board
which sits next to him during his
lectures.
At the top of the board is OM,
the highest state of consciousness.
"Call it God, or Allah, or alpha,
that doesn't matter," he says.

The OA/, according to the
Swami, "is in all of us. But we do
not know about its existence
because, uasanas (desires) keep
our mirds in a constant state of
agitation."

charlatans as he had expected, he
encountered men of rare greatness
and found himself "caught up" in
the beliefs. "Therefore, I wanted
to study deeper and give my life
to it,"he adds.
Balakrishna spent seven years
of his youth in the numbing cold
of the Himalayas learning the

Vedanta (the essence of
Hinduism) at the feet of some of
the greatest masters of time. He
was then transformed into a new
man, Swami Chinmayananda,
which means bliss attained
through knowledge.
The depth of new conviction
from this knowledge made him
give up the serene atmosphere in
the Himalayas and enter into the
"whirlwind of activity" which has
filled the past 20 years of his life.
Swami Chinmayananda has
organized the famous Sandeepany

Sadhanalva Ashram in Bombay
where hundreds of students from
all over the worid are taught free
of charge. He supervises countless
welfare projects, hospitals and
other social programs all over
India for "alleviating the suffering
of the poor."
inner Peace'
But while the Swami's life may
be as busy as that of the busiest
American executive, the
difference is his "inner peace, joy
and selflessness." He thus
practices what he preaches by
epitomizing the message of the
Gita: to be outwardly active
while being inwardly serene.
Also a prolific writer, he has
written some 30 books on the
Gita and other aspects of Hindu
philosophy, though he dismisses
this achievement with, "I never
write books. They come through
me.
But he does make a big deal
about the 70 to 80 letters he
writes by hand each day,
answering queries from his
followers.
"You know why I write them
myself instead of getting them
typewritten?" he winks. "Because
the moment the disciple receives a
hand-written letter from the
SWAMI himself, he is completely
sold and sealed to me!"
His joke about disciples
reemphasizes what he keeps
reminding them all the time.
"I can only point the way," he
says, "but the experience has to
be your very own. DONT LEAN

ON ME. Get whatever you can
from the Swami, then leave him
alone to point the way to others
like you."
American Slang
That is why he refuses to start
his ashrams (religious instructions)
in America, like most of the other
Gurus. "I don't want to start
monuments for myself,
goddammit!" he emphasizes.
His facility with American
slang and other earthy expressions
startles in the beginning but soon
his humorous explanation sinks
in. "A Swami may have his head
high above everyone. But how can
he point the way unless his legs
are knee-deep in life?"
So, during the more subtle and
weary moments of his discourses,
when many a mentally-tired
listener closes his eyes, the
Swami's powerful voice quickly
jolts him back to wakefulness.
"Don't think you can fool me
by dozing off and trying to give
the impression that you are
meditating." Then in an aside,
"That's because I do it myself!"
Speaking of the meditation
technique he mentioned on the
first day, the Swami explains "All
you have to do is to flatten your
nose on the ground, raise your
hands and legs in the air, and
that's the standing-on-the-nose
technique which will take you
straight to God."
Then he surveys the quizzical
looks all around him. "Do you
guys think I am kidding?" And
the room vibrates with his impisH
laughter once again.

THE SWAMI—As part of his once-a-year-world-tour, Swami Chinmayananda spent 10 days lecturing at
Stanford. Heralded as the "holiest spiritual master from India," by publicity blurbs, the swami can be
both serious and light-hearted. As one of his disciples puts it, "You see, he isn't like the other gurus."
"What is my technique? My
technique is to stand on my nose
and meditate. But I practice it
only in private!"
Swami Chinmayananda laughs
impishly through his graying
beard. Then suddenly he
thunders, "If you are looking for
shortcuts to spiritualism or instant
psychedelic happenings, you have
made a mistake today. But don't
repeat it: DONT COME
TOMORROW."
But they all did come the next
day. And the day after the
next.... Skilling Auditorium at
Stanford overflowed with some
300 people every evening between
7:30 and 9:30 from February 22
to March 2 to listen to Swami
Chinmayananda's free discourses
on the Bhagavad Gita.
Self-Discipline
"And the Gita," the Swami
repeatedly points out in his
vigorous, impeccable English, "is
not meant for effete drop-outs
who are good neither for man nor
God. It is meant for the energetic
and the alert, willing to go
through self-discipline to attain
the highest state of
consciousness."
The Swami's exposition of the
Gita is succinctly depicted on a
two-foot-by-three-foot blue-board
which sits next to him during his
lectures.
At the top of the board is OM,
the highest state of consciousness.
"Call it God, or Allah, or alpha,
that doesn't matter," he says.

The OA/, according to the
Swami, "is in all of us. But we do
not know about its existence
because, uasanas (desires) keep
our mirds in a constant state of
agitation."
Quiet Vasanas
The Swami notes that varying
degrees of vasanas are perpetually
generated in us because of the
attachment of our faculties; the
body, mind and intellect (BMI),
to the outer world of objects,
emotions and thoughts (OET).
"The first step therefore in any
spiritual endeavor towards
attaining self-realization, is to
quiet the mind by exhausting its
existing uasanas and then
preventing a generation of fresh
uasanas," the Swami points out.
"This is a slow and an arduous
process involving the
self-disciplined diversion of the
body, mind and intellect from the
outer world of objects, emotions
and thoughts to the OA/ within us.
The Gita prescribes practical
guidelines for quieting the
mind's turmoil for all categories
of people burdened with different
degress of uasanas."
The Swami explains the subtle
prescription of the Gita by gently
swaying his audience from
raptures of deep thought to bouts
of hilarious laughter with his
inimitable brand of mischievous
humor.
"Chewing-gum in the mouth,
Coke in the hand, television in the
bathroom — you can't buy instant
happiness like vou buv cookies in
the supermarket!" the Swami

proclaims.
He insists on understanding the
path of knowledge because that
was the way he himself evolved.
In 1941 his name was Balakrishna
Menon, the son of a w althy
judge, and he was a post-graduate
in law and literature as well as a
fiercely ambitious journalist and a
socialist.
"I believed religion was a
danger to society," he says of his
thoughts back then.
Skeptic To Activist
The skeptic in him made him

seek out spiritual masters in the
Himalayas, "not to gain
knowledge but to find out how
they were keeping their bluff
among the masses."
But instead of meeting
charlatans as he had expected, he
encountered men of rare greatness
and found himself "caught up" in

myself instead of getting them
typewritten?" he winks. "Because
the moment the disciple receives a
hand-written letter from the
SWAMI himself, he is completely
sold and sealed to me!"
His joke about disciples
reemphasizes what he keeps
reminding them all the time.
"I can only point the way," he
says, "but the experience has to
be your very own. DONT LEAN

ON ME. Get whatever you can
from the Swami, then leave him
alone to point the way to others
like you."
American Slang
That is why he refuses to start
his ashrams (religious instructions)
in America, like most of the other
Gurus. "I don't want to start
monuments for myself,
goddammit!" he emphasizes.
His facility with American
slang and other earthy expressions
startles in the beginning but soon
his humorous explanation sinks
in. "A Swami may have his head
high above everyone. But how can
he point the way unless his legs
are knee-deep in life?"
So, during the more subtle and
weary moments of his discourses,
when many a mentally-tired
listener closes his eyes, the
Swami's powerful voice quickly
jolts him back to wakefulness.
"Don't think you can fool me
by dozing off and trying to give
the impression that you are
meditating." Then in an aside,
"That's because I do it myself!"
Speaking of the meditation
technique he mentioned on the
first day, the Swami explains "All
you have to do is to flatten your
nose on the ground, raise your
hands and legs in the air, and
that's the standing-on-the-nose
technique which will take you
straight to God."
Then he surveys the quizzical
looks all around him. "Do you
guys think I am kidding?" And
the room vibrates with his impisH
laughter once again.

THE SWAMI—As part of his once-a-year-world-tour, Swami Chinmayananda spent 10 days lecturing at
Stanford. Heralded as the "holiest spiritual master from India," by publicity blurbs, the swami can be
both serious and light-hearted. As one of his disciples puts it, "You see, he isn't like the other gurus."
"What is my technique? My
technique is to stand on my nose
and meditate. But I practice it
only in private!"
Swami Chinmayananda laughs
impishly through his graying
beard. Then suddenly he
thunders, "If you are looking for
shortcuts to spiritualism or instant
psychedelic happenings, you have
made a mistake today. But don't
repeat it: DONT COME
TOMORROW."
But they all did come the next
day. And the day after the
next.... Skilling Auditorium at
Stanford overflowed with some
300 people every evening between
7:30 and 9:30 from February 22
to March 2 to listen to Swami
Chinmayananda's free discourses
on the Bhagavad Gita.
Self-Discipline
"And the Gita," the Swami
repeatedly points out in his
vigorous, impeccable English, "is
not meant for effete drop-outs
who are good neither for man nor
God. It is meant for the energetic
and the alert, willing to go
through self-discipline to attain
the highest state of
consciousness."
The Swami's exposition of the
Gita is succinctly depicted on a
two-foot-by-three-foot blue-board
which sits next to him during his
lectures.
At the top of the board is OM,
the highest state of consciousness.
"Call it God, or Allah, or alpha,
that doesn't matter," he says.

The OA/, according to the
Swami, "is in all of us. But we do
not know about its existence
because, uasanas (desires) keep
our mirds in a constant state of
agitation."
Quiet Vasanas
The Swami notes that varying
degrees of vasanas are perpetually
generated in us because of the
attachment of our faculties; the
body, mind and intellect (BMI),
to the outer world of objects,
emotions and thoughts (OET).
"The first step therefore in any
spiritual endeavor towards
attaining self-realization, is to
quiet the mind by exhausting its
existing uasanas and then
preventing a generation of fresh
uasanas," the Swami points out.
"This is a slow and an arduous
process involving the
self-disciplined diversion of the
body, mind and intellect from the
outer world of objects, emotions
and thoughts to the OA/ within us.
The Gita prescribes practical
guidelines for quieting the
mind's turmoil for all categories
of people burdened with different
degress of uasanas."
The Swami explains the subtle
prescription of the Gita by gently
swaying his audience from
raptures of deep thought to bouts
of hilarious laughter with his
inimitable brand of mischievous
humor.
"Chewing-gum in the mouth,
Coke in the hand, television in the
bathroom — you can't buy instant
happiness like vou buv cookies in
the supermarket!" the Swami

proclaims.
He insists on understanding the
path of knowledge because that
was the way he himself evolved.
In 1941 his name was Balakrishna
Menon, the son of a w althy
judge, and he was a post-graduate
in law and literature as well as a
fiercely ambitious journalist and a
socialist.
"I believed religion was a
danger to society," he says of his
thoughts back then.
Skeptic To Activist
The skeptic in him made him

seek out spiritual masters in the
Himalayas, "not to gain
knowledge but to find out how
they were keeping their bluff
among the masses."
But instead of meeting
charlatans as he had expected, he
encountered men of rare greatness
and found himself "caught up" in
the beliefs. "Therefore, I wanted
to study deeper and give my life
to it,"he adds.
Balakrishna spent seven years
of his youth in the numbing cold
of the Himalayas learning the

Vedanta (the essence of
Hinduism) at the feet of some of
the greatest masters of time. He
was then transformed into a new
man, Swami Chinmayananda,
which means bliss attained
through knowledge.
The depth of new conviction
from this knowledge made him
give up the serene atmosphere in
the Himalayas and enter into the
"whirlwind of activity" which has
filled the past 20 years of his life.
Swami Chinmayananda has
organized the famous Sandeepany

Sadhanalva Ashram in Bombay
where hundreds of students from
all over the worid are taught free
of charge. He supervises countless
welfare projects, hospitals and
other social programs all over
India for "alleviating the suffering
of the poor."
inner Peace'
But while the Swami's life may
be as busy as that of the busiest
American executive, the
difference is his "inner peace, joy
and selflessness." He thus
practices what he preaches by
epitomizing the message of the
Gita: to be outwardly active
while being inwardly serene.
Also a prolific writer, he has
written some 30 books on the
Gita and other aspects of Hindu
philosophy, though he dismisses
this achievement with, "I never
write books. They come through
me.
But he does make a big deal
about the 70 to 80 letters he
writes by hand each day,
answering queries from his
followers.
"You know why I write them
myself instead of getting them
typewritten?" he winks. "Because
the moment the disciple receives a
hand-written letter from the
SWAMI himself, he is completely
sold and sealed to me!"
His joke about disciples
reemphasizes what he keeps
reminding them all the time.
"I can only point the way," he
says, "but the experience has to
be your very own. DONT LEAN

ON ME. Get whatever you can
from the Swami, then leave him
alone to point the way to others
like you."
