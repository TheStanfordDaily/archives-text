REPORT ON THE GRADING POLICY
March 5, 1975 by
The Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA)
Historical Background
In 1970, Stanford instituted a new system of grading,
intended to be a "record of accomplishment" that included
only the designations A, B, C, or Pass (+).
Subsequently plus and minus modifiers to the letter
grades were reinstated, along with a "P" form of the Pass to
indicate a course with no letter grades, in contrast to a course
where a student chooses the pass option (+).
Failing grades were no longer recorded, the D grade was
no longer used as the minimal passing grade, and a student
could drop a course simply by not taking the final examina
tion.
This new system was perhaps the most notable result of
the Study of Education at Stanford (SES); it represents a
major departure from the traditional "historical record" that
attempts to include a student's complete educational experi
ences, both successful and unsuccessful.
In February 1974, the C-AAA appointed an Ad Hoc Panel
on the Grading System, consisting of Prof. Bradley Efron,
statistics (chairman); Harvey Hall, registrar emeritus; Sally
Mahoney, registrar; Prof. Douglas Skoog, chemistry; Kevin
Smith, undergraduate in political science; Prof. Mary Sunseri,
mathematics; Karen Swisher, graduate in business; and Prof.
Mason Yearian, associate dean of undergraduate studies. (The
panel was augmented in September 1974 by Prof. Alexander
Fetter, liaison from C-AAA, and Sally Vaughn, undergradu
ate in psychology.)
This panel was charged:
1. To review and to recommend continuance, or change in
the grading systems established in / 9 70; and
2. To conduct the review with special attention to possi
ble abuses in the use of the Incomplete grade (I), to the
effect of course drop deadline policies, and to the question of
the possible utility of the "D" grade.
The need for such a review was based on the general
principle of reviewing all major innovations and also on
faculty criticisms of the new system. The panel met 15 times
during the year 1974 and submitted its report to C-AAA on
Jan.15,1975.
This report was published both in Campus Report (Jan.
22, 1975) and in the Stanford Daily (Jan. 27, 1975), and the
Stanford community was invited to submit written responses.
In addition, members of the Panel participated in open
meetings with students on Jan. 27 and I eb. 10, 1975. The
C-AAA considered the report of the Ad Hoc Panel at six
meetings during winter quarter of 1974-75.
Advantages Perceived in the Present System.
In 1970 Stanford became one of the first leading univer
sities to abandon recording failures on its transcripts. This
change arose directly from the Study of Education at
Stanford, whose arguments remain powerful today.
We have identified three major apparent benefits of the
present policy:
1. Increased recognition of grades as a measure of intel
lectual accomplishment rather than as a disciplinary tool,
with a consequent improvement in the teacher-student rela
tion.
2. Greater opportunity for all students, but especially
those with poorer than average academic backgrounds, to
attempt important courses for which they may not feel fully
prepared. This freedom is especially valuable in an era of
preprofessionalism.
3. Elimination of a large amount of unpleasant academic
bookkeeping connected with the old drop-deadline system
and the occasional but genuine inequities engendered by the
ap/taratus of petitions and review committees.
These and similar arguments evidently persuaded a major
ity of the Senate of the Academic Council in 1970; such
principles should not be abandoned lightly.
Difficulties Perceived in the Present System
Our discussions and those of the Ad Hoc Panel identified
several apparent concerns about the present grading system:
/. The record of accomplishment is thought to be some
how dishonest in omitting a student's failures For example,
if a student participates more than once in a course, this
information might affect the evaluation of the final grade in
that course. Also, the identification of a student who regular
ly drops one or more classes might be useful to an external
agency. In this sense, the current Stanford transcript provides
an incomplete record of a student's academic performance,
for it withholds information that might prove valuable in
future selection and admission processes. Omission of such
negative data may penalize students with the best records.
2. The present freedom to add courses ("up to the last
four weeks of the quarter including finals") and to drop
courses ("up to 24 hours before the final examination")
allows students to postpone hard decisions on their academic
goals, thereby losing the specific educational value of making
such choices.
3. The same liberal /x>licy on adding and dropping cour
ses encourages some students to enroll in courses with no
intention of completing them. This procedure can impair the
intellectual atmosphere in certain courses. It can also falsely
inflate enrollment, leading to extra sections, extra teaching
assistants, and a general waste of the University's resources.
4. The present flexibility hinders the advising process. If
a student were required to obtain the adviser's consent for
alterations in his schedule, the quality of advising might
improve.
5. At present, both the f>ass option and the assignment of
an Incomplete grade arc matters between the instructor and

the student. This policy is thought by some to encourage
abuse of the deadline for selecting the pass option (before
"the last four weeks of the quarter including finals"). Indeed,
it is not uncommon for students to request, and for instruc
tors to grant, a pass if the final examination turns out to
yield less than a B. In addition, the present minimal require
ment for the Incomplete ("an instructor determines that a
student needs further time to complete satisfactorily a
course ") provides no clear guide to the quality of work or to
the time allowed to make up the Incomplete. Such a
situation can produce needless pressures both on the instruc
tor and on the student.
6. The absence of any grade lower than C may induce
grade inflation because the C is interpreted as equivalent to
near-failure. Thus grades tend to cluster in the A! B range,
making it difficult, or perhaps impossible, to distinguish
between the abilities of the students in that range.
Rationale for the Proposed Recommendations.
Recommendation 1.
Grades characterize the quality of a student's work, both
to himself and to an outside reader of the transcript. The
present choice among only three letter grades encourages too
heavy reliance on the A and B at the expense of the C,
despite their nominal meanings of excellent, superior, and
satisfactory. Moreover, the use of plus and minus modifiers
cannot alter the perception of the C as the lowest grade.
Although the extent of grade inflation has sometimes
been exaggerated, a certain upward movement has definitely
occurred. In part, we ascribe the present concentration of
grades in the A/B range to the absence of any grade lower
than C; we therefore recommend without dissent that
1. The present spectrum of letter grades A (Exceptional),
B (Superior), and C (Satisfactory) should be expanded by the
use of D (Minimal Pass). A passing grade, therefore, would be
represented by one of these letter grades or by the symbol P
or +.
In this way, the D grade would represent graduation
credit, as was the case before 1970. Probably the D would
not be much used (at Yale, where permanent grades arc A, B,
C, and D, the D apparently accounts for only 2 to 4% of the
total grades); nevertheless, its mere existence might be an
incentive to move the distribution of grades downward from
the present concentration at the upper end. Revitalizing the
C would provide a truer characterization of a student's
performance.
Recommendation 2.
Consideration of the Incomplete grade was one of the
original charges to the Ad Hoc Panel on the Grading System.
In fact, use of this grade has declined since 1969, as might
be expected following the elimination of the drop deadline.
On the other hand, the present policy provides virtually
no guidance for an instructor or a student in deciding
whether an Incomplete is justified.
In such a situation, abuse no doubt occurs, but such abuse
cannot easily be documented.
I or this reason, we urge a return to the previous view that
an Incomplete grade implies an active and substantial partici
pation in the class.
Moreover, we feel that one calendar year provides a
reasonable time for completing the remaining portion of the
work; it should be prerogative of the instructor to set a
shorter deadline.
Exceptional cases will, no doubt, arise from time to time,
but the deadline should not ordinarily extend beyond one
calendar year from the date of the final examination for
which the Incomplete grade was incurred. To eliminate the
present vagueness, we unanimously recommend that
2. The Incomplete grade (I) should be restricted to cases
where a student has satisfactorily completed a substantial
portion of the coursc work. The time limit for satisfactory
completion of the course work shall be determined by the
instructor, but ordinarily should not be more than one
calendar year from the date of the final examination in the
course in question.
In accordance with the current practice, when Incomplete
work has been satisfactorily completed, the notation (I) shall
be removed from the official record and shall be replaced by
the appropriate passing grade. Alternatively, in accordance
with current practice, the course may be expunged from the
record on the receipt of a petition.
Recommendation 3.
The role of a firm drop deadline generated considerable
discussion both in the Ad Hoc Panel on the Grading System
and in the C-AAA As analyzed subsequently, we ultimately
decided against substantial modification in the current
policy. On the other hand, the phrase "up to 24 hours"
(before the final examination) was unenforceable and mean
ingless. As a result, we unanimously recommend that
3. The time limit specified in the current policy as
regards the dropping of courses, "up to 24 hours before the
final examination," should be revised and the policy
amended to read: "Students are permitted to drop a course
at any time before the final examination, with concurrent
loss of credit."
Recommendation 4.
The Study of Education at Stanford concluded that a
student s grade-point average is at best only poorly correlated
with the student's future achievement; they therefore recom
mended that "routine computation of grade-point averages
should be abandoned."
At present, Stanford requires an annual computation of
the Letter Grade Indicator (LGI), which serves many of the
same purposes and invites fallacious comparison with the
older GPA. We recognize that external agencies may compute
some kind of numerical measure of a student's performance;

for example, American Medical College Application Service
does so, as do many institutions to which our students and
alumni apply.
Nevertheless, we prefer not to institutionalize such a
calculation, and we concur, unanimously with the Ad Hoc
Panel on the Grading System in recommending that
4. The routine computation of a Letter Grade Indicator
(LGI) for each student should be abandoned.
Recommendation 5.
The committee reaffirms that the instructor "responsible
for the course shall be responsible for the evaluation of
student course work."
In this sense, grade inflation arises because most instruc
tors choose to give relatively higher grades. Recommendation
1 addresses part of this problem.
We also feel th-.t more and better information about
grades awarded might help the faculty bring grade distribu
tion closer to the intended definition of the letter grades. . . .
Although we insist that the grade distribution in individ
ual courses must remain confidential, we favor furnishing
deans and department chairmen with relevant information to
provide a basis for discussion with individual faculty mem
bers.
Consequently, we unanimously recommend that
5. The Registrar regularly should collect and make public
grade distributions in the various schools of the University. In
addition, the appropriate deans and department chairmen
should receive reports of grade distributions in individual
courses along with an indication of appreciable deviations
from relevant University distributions.
In making this recommendation, we definitely do not
support a University-wide norm (or curve), and we further
more recognize that distributions can differ considerably in
different situations.
Nevertheless, we believe that to draw attention to appreci
able deviation from relevant University distributions may
constitute a practical step, in some cases, toward ending the
demonstrated erosion in the meaning of letter grades.
Recommendation 6.
We have been concerned with abuses of the deadline for
selecting the pass option (before the last four weeks of the
quarter, including finals).
Occasionally, for example, students have been graded on a
pass option if the final grade falls too low, or pass-option
examinations have been graded separately from those on the
letter-grade basis.
We consider that these problems are, and ought to be,
under the control of the instructor. Surely, the instructor can
require firm adherence to the announced deadline and can
insist on equal treatment of all examinations.
Unfortunately, some instructors seem unaware of the
current regulations, and we unanimously recommend that
6. The Registrar should publicize widely both the regula
tions concerning the pass option and the approach of each
quarter's final deadline for choosing it.
Discussion of Other Possible Recommendations
We considered and ultimately rejected other recommenda
tions that would involve substantial alterations in the present
grading policy. Some of these have persuasive advocates, and
we consider it valuable to discuss their merits and our reasons
for rejecting them.
1. On a closely divided vote, the Ad Hoc Panel on the
Grading System recommended that "Firm deadlines for
dropping courses should be reinstated; the dates should be
the same as those currently in force for adding courses. A
single grade should be introduced to indicate either unauthor
ized withdrawal from a course or unsatisfactory performance
in the course This grade should be denoted NC (No Credit)
on the transcript. A clear description of the meaning of the
new grade will be included on all transcripts. "
This recommendation was intended to mitigate some of
the difficulties perceived in the present system, especially
items 1 4, concerning a) the preference for a complete
historical record, b) the failure of students to make definite
commitments early in the quarter, c) the possible waste of
the University's resources, d) and the difficulty of advisers in
keeping track of the student's progress.
Each of these raises important and valid questions.
a) With regard to the first. The choice between the
"record of accomplishment" and the "historical record" is
one on which reasonable people can evidently differ.
A truly historical record would presumably include every
class a student ever attends, and no member of C-AAA
seriously suggested such a possibility. More importantly we
were impressed by the need for long-term continuity in the
grading policy, far longer than a single student generation
(roughly the period since adopting the present arrangement
in 1970). Thus any reason for change must be sufficiently
compelling to justify not only long-term commitment to the
altered arrangements but also the act of change itself.
In the abscnce of overwhelming preference for one or the
other systems, many members of C-AAA felt that this
argument justifies retaining the general features of the pre
sent system.
b) With regard to the second question, it is unclear that
relatively late drop deadline (well into the second half of the
quarter) would help students make more intelligent choices
than they do now or permit their advisers to help them do so.
The Ad Hoc Panel on the Grading System considered and
rejected an earlier drop deadline (the end of the second week,
say) as too rigid and uncompromising. In addition, one of the
original arguments advanced in support of the present system
was that it provides students with freedom to attempt
courses that might otherwise be avoided. We find this point

sufficiently convincing to reject entirely any early deadline
for dropping courses.
c) Wc considered carefully the argument which has been
advanced thai resources are wasted as a consequence of
students' dropping courses late in the quarter.
As a practical matter, sections are constituted early in the
quarter, and students who drop after the second week can
have little impact on the lecture schedule. Also, the total
number of late dropped classes is only about 10% of all
course registrations, and the C-AAA judged this fraction
reasonable. Wc are aware that particular courses suffer much
greater uncertainty and attrition but are unprepared to
recommend legislation to cover the worst possible case.
d) The role of an undergraduate adviser is difficult at best,
and any lack of information makes it more so.
Each quarter, the adviser receives a copy of the student's
official study list and the student's end-of-quartcr report,
which includes the notation NC. In addition the adviser
receives annually a copy ot the olticial transcript, shorn of
the courses in which the student receives no credit. Thus the
adviser is well informed if a student accumulates too many
NC's.
We are unconvinced that a drop deadline after the middle
of the quarter would measurably increase the adviser's effec
tiveness; rather it might be viewed as a new (and irritating)
bit of bureaucracy, both by students and by faculty.
On balance, a majority of the C-AAA concluded that the
educational value inherent in making one's own choice
outweighed the educational value of forcing an early decision
among difficult alternatives.
As discussed previously in connection with recommenda
tion 3, we therefore support a modification of the present
policy amended to read that "students are permitted to drop
a course at any time before the final examination, with
concurrent loss of credit."
2. A second possible recommendation concerned the
stricter enforcement of the deadline for selecting the pass
option.
One suggestion would assign the Registrar exclusive con
trol of the pass option (the +). In this case, an instructor
would assign all students either a letter grade or a P; the
Registrar would then alter the letter grade to + for any
student so requesting before the final deadline.
We rejected this proposal not only because it seems
cumbersome, but more importantly because we affirm the
essential responsibility of the instructor in determing the
standards for conduct and grading in his or her course.
Instead, we chose (in Recommendation 6) to support an
intensive campaign to educate students and instructors in the
current policy. If this voluntary treatment fails to correct the
present abuses, we would then consider instituting an exter
nal procedure of the sort discussed above.
3. One of the principal results intended and expected
when the present grading system was instituted in 1970 was
the elimination of a universal grading curve; each student is
now supposed to be graded absolutely, not relative to a
University-wide standard.
Such an absolute basis is difficult to apply in all cases, and
there have been suggestions for "indexing" the transcript to
make it more "meaningful and informative." For example,
one piaii would print the numerical average of all letter
grades in a given course (with A=4, B=3, C=2, D=l) next to
the grade recorded on the student's transcript.
In effect, this change would force instructors to grade
relatively; it would represent a major de/farturc from our
present system without corresponding benefits, and we resist
any such plan.
Conclusions
The C-AAA and its Ad Hoc Panel on the Grading System
have considered various possible alternatives to Stanford's
grading policy On a divided vote, we reaffirm the basic
features of the present system that was instituted in 1970.
In general, we favor the retention of the record of
accomplishment, with no penalty, other than the loss of
credit, for failure to complete a course, for whatever reason.
Specifically, we reaffirm the policy stated in the 112 aculty
Handbook, apart from the six recommendations listed at the
beginning of this report, three of which concern the grading
system and three of which represent suggestions for adminis
trative action.
In closing, wc mention the question of the relative
honesty of one recording system compared to another. After
considerable discussion, wc feel that "honesty" is achieved
when the transcript makes clear and explicit the nature of the
grading system. We arc satisfied that our present transcript
docs indeed provide honest information to other educational
institutions, external agencies, and employers.
