With the aid of an
electrical device, the
Optacon, the visually
handicapped can read
almost any medium,
eliminating the need for
Braille. Bob Sweetman, a
blind student, uses one
here.
This year, the
University will purchase
six such devices for $3700
apiece, and lend them to
blind students. And once
again the Aqua follies will
be held on Lake Lagunita
in April to benefit the
University's Optacon fund.
This year's program will
include the usual stunts
and shows, refreshments,
and an appearance by the
LSJUMB.
