# Trustees Rent S.F. Office, But Pay A 'Lover's Rate'
## 
### RANDALL TURK 
High atop the Pacific Mutual
Life building in the heart of San
Francisco's financial district,
Stanford's Board of Trustees
office sports a magnificent view of
the City and its Bay.
An open air deck, plumed with
redwood planter boxes of ivy and
small firs, surrounds the tastefully
furnished office on three sides,
creating an atmosphere of both
business and pleasure.
The office is leased from the
Federal Home Loan Bank for
$14,700 a year, a figure Assistant
to the President Frederick Glover
calls a "lover's rate."
And, like similar Stanford
offics in New York and Los
Angeles, the San Francisco office
is considered an indispensible, if
comfortable, expedient for the
workings of the University.
There, Board of Trustees
Administrative Assistant Elizabeth
Combiths keeps an eye on
Stanford's vast investment
activities.
Relaying dictums from the
American Express Asset
Management Company to the
Wells Fargo Bank, the firms which
handle Stanford's investments,

Combiths, the office's only
full-time employee,
single-handedly manages the
enormous flow of money
necessary to keep Stanford in the
black.
She also acts as the funnel for
all incoming gifts and securities
for the University, as well as
supplies authorized signatures to
the stream of documents which
cross her desk in the absence of
appropriate Trustee officers.
But Combiths is not the only
one who uses the office's
attractive accommodations. Eight
times a year the Board of Trustees
convenes in the office's large
board room under the watchful
eye of young Leland Stanford, Jr.,
whose portrait adorns the room's
side wall.
Occasionally other groups such
as the Development Committee,
alumni reunion committees or
Business School seminars in
continuing education take
advantage of the office's
convenient in-city location and its
in-house kitchen and catering
service.
The Stanford News Service also
uses the office approximately
once a month for press
conferences to announce major

University events such as fund
drives, important books
published or significant advances
by Stanford researchers.
Pointing out that the
convenience factor is highly
significant, Glover noted that
Trustees and other University
notables can slip over to the office
on Stanford business without a
major interruption of their own
business activities.
But by far the most essential
aspect of the office, Glover said, is
its function as the locus of
Stanford's investment and fund
raiaing activities.
"Students may not realize that
we're talking about millions of
dollars of investments and
development funds," said Glover,
indicating that the cost of
operating the office is
insignificant in comparison with
the amount of money it generates
and manages.
At a time when University
cutbacks are on the rise, some
eyebrows may be raised at the
expense of such offices.
But if, as Rousseau once
insisted, "money is the seed of
money," Stanford's San Francisco
Trustee office may well be the
seed's most fertile bed.

Construction on the comer of Mayfield Avenue and Campus Drive is well under way. The question is,
when will the University build condominiums for students?

"Students may not realize that
we're talking about millions of
dollars of investments and
development funds," said Glover,
indicating that the cost of
operating the office is
insignificant in comparison with
the amount of money it generates
and manages.
At a time when University
cutbacks are on the rise, some
eyebrows may be raised at the
expense of such offices.
But if, as Rousseau once
insisted, "money is the seed of
money," Stanford's San Francisco
Trustee office may well be the
seed's most fertile bed.

EMERITI HOUSING—The University is keeping its promise on the emeriti faculty housing project.
Construction on the comer of Mayfield Avenue and Campus Drive is well under way. The question is,
when will the University build condominiums for students?
High atop the Pacific Mutual
Life building in the heart of San
Francisco's financial district,
Stanford's Board of Trustees
office sports a magnificent view of
the City and its Bay.
An open air deck, plumed with
redwood planter boxes of ivy and
small firs, surrounds the tastefully
furnished office on three sides,
creating an atmosphere of both
business and pleasure.
The office is leased from the
Federal Home Loan Bank for
$14,700 a year, a figure Assistant
to the President Frederick Glover
calls a "lover's rate."
And, like similar Stanford
offics in New York and Los
Angeles, the San Francisco office
is considered an indispensible, if
comfortable, expedient for the
workings of the University.
There, Board of Trustees
Administrative Assistant Elizabeth
Combiths keeps an eye on
Stanford's vast investment
activities.
Relaying dictums from the
American Express Asset
Management Company to the
Wells Fargo Bank, the firms which
handle Stanford's investments,

Combiths, the office's only
full-time employee,
single-handedly manages the
enormous flow of money
necessary to keep Stanford in the
black.
She also acts as the funnel for
all incoming gifts and securities
for the University, as well as
supplies authorized signatures to
the stream of documents which
cross her desk in the absence of
appropriate Trustee officers.
But Combiths is not the only
one who uses the office's
attractive accommodations. Eight
times a year the Board of Trustees
convenes in the office's large
board room under the watchful
eye of young Leland Stanford, Jr.,
whose portrait adorns the room's
side wall.
Occasionally other groups such
as the Development Committee,
alumni reunion committees or
Business School seminars in
continuing education take
advantage of the office's
convenient in-city location and its
in-house kitchen and catering
service.
The Stanford News Service also
uses the office approximately
once a month for press
conferences to announce major

University events such as fund
drives, important books
published or significant advances
by Stanford researchers.
Pointing out that the
convenience factor is highly
significant, Glover noted that
Trustees and other University
notables can slip over to the office
on Stanford business without a
major interruption of their own
business activities.
But by far the most essential
aspect of the office, Glover said, is
its function as the locus of
Stanford's investment and fund
raiaing activities.
