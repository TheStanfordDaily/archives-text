# Asian-American Courses Offered
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Four Asian-American studies
courses, to be offered within the
coming year, will be sponsored by
the Sociology' Department.
This is the first time that
Asian-American courses have been
incorporated into a "legitimate
department," according to Mike
Hsu, chairman of the Stanford
Asian Students Coordinating
Committee (SASCC).
Next quarter's undergraduate
special on "Contemporary Issues
of Asian Americans" will also be
offered as Sociology 163. The
class will take a socio-psycho
logical perspective of the topic
and will be taught by Dr. Allan
Seid, a Palo Alto psychiatrist who
sprved as a part-time counselor at
Cowell Health Center last year.
The other three classes, still
undetermined, will be offered
next year. The sponsorship. Hsu
noted, is limited to credit, with no
funding from the Sociology
Department.
Stephen Olsen, assistant
professor of sociology, whom Hsu
described as "very instrumental in
helping us," said that in the

current economic pinch, the
Sociology Department has no
additional funds to offer the
Asian-American courses.
'Fits In Nicely'
Olsen gave two reasons for the
department's agreement to
sponsor the spring quarter course.
The content of the course "fits in
very nicely with our conception
of how an ethnic group and
developing social movement
should be studied," he said.
Moreover, Seid, who received
his master's degree in the
Sociology Department here, is
known to have a good academic
background in the field, Olsen
noted.
"We have no qualms about the
kinds of things he would be
satisfied with," Olsen said.
He also commented that there
is "a very obvious demand" for
Asian-American courses, "one
that is not at all met in the regular
course offerings."
Doug Chan, theme associate at
Junipero House (the Asian-
American theme dorm), noted
that a class in Cantonese, begun
with the idea of preparing

students for field work in
Chinese-American communities,
had been offered by the Asian
Languages Department. The
course is "being phased out this
year," Chan said.
The Cantonese course,however,
was "not reaily an Asian-
American course per se,'' Chan
said, but "supplementary to Asian-
American courses."
Legitimizes Courses
Both Chan and Hsu called the
Sociology Department's
sponsorship of the classes a "big
step" for Asian-American studies
at Stanford.
"This is the most successful
our efforts have ever been in
terms of getting us legitimized,"
Hsu said.
Previous courses had been
offered on an extra-departmental
basis through SWOPSI and the
Undergraduate Specials program.
Leigh Ann Miyasato, house
associate at Junipero, observed
that the sponsorship gives the
Asian-American classes "more
credence in the eyes of students as
well as administrators."
Olsen expressed interest in the

establishment of a course that
"could be offered regularly."
Faculty Member Needed
He added it would "obviously
be much better if there could be a
regular member of the faculty" to
coordinate Asian-American
classes, noting there is an
Asian-American applicant for an
assistant professorship in the
Anthropology Department.
The applicant, Sylvia
Yanagisako, has just completed a
doctoral dissertation in
anthropology at the University of
Washington at Seattle, and has
indicated to Junipero residents
that she would be interested in
teaching an Asian-American
studies class.
"We were very impressed with
her," commented Miyasato.
"If she were to be appointed, it
would be preferable if she were to
provide the base" for
Asian-American classes, Olsen
said.
Yanagisako is one of eight or
nine finalists for the position,
according to Asst. Anthropology Prof.
George Collier, chairman of the
recruitment committee.
