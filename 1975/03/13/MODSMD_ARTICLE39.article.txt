Hearst Aeeomplices To Be Indieted?
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Indictments will be sought here
today against persons accused of harboring fugitive
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, according to two
newspaper accounts.
Stories by the San Francisco Chronicle and the
Scranton (Pa.) Tribu.ie said John Cottone, U.S. Attorney
for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, would seek the
indictments against an unknown number of persons.
Cottone said last night that he expects indictments to be
returned today, but he refused to say if they would be
related to the Hearst case.
"I wouldn't be able to tell you anything about that," he
said when asked if his investigation centered on the missing
newspaper heiress.
"We have a grand jury today, and we have some
witnesses coming in. I'm sure there will be indictments
returned, probably today."
The Chronicle's story, which was to appear in today's
newspaper edition was attributed to unidentified sources.
The Tribune's edition, which serves Cottone's home city
of Scranton, today carried a story which quoted a source in
Cottone's office.
The Tribune said Patty Hearst had been in northeastern
Pennyslvania. The area is near the home of a dead SLA
member, William Wolfe, for whom Miss Hearst professed
her love in a tape recording last year.
"This is the first I've heard anything about that,'"
Wolfe's father, Dr. L.S. Wolfe, said when asked about Miss
Hearst's whereabouts.
House Panel Approves Cambodia Aid
WASHINGTON — A House subcommittee recommended
yesterday that Congress provide $82.5 million in emergency
U.S. military aid for Cambodia after House Democrats took
a 169 to 49 vote policy stand against providing additional
military aid to either Cambodia or South Vietnam.
The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee voted 4 to 3 to
recommend the Cambodia military aid ona month-by-month
basis and only on condition that President Ford certify
each month that "the U.S. is undertaking specific steps to
end the conflict in Cambodia not later than June 30."
Ford would be required to certify each month that the
Cambodian government is seeking an accommodation with
the insurgents, that safe passage out of the country is
assured for officials who fear a bloodbath, and that the
United States is seeking U.N. oversight of "a peaceful and
orderly end to the conflict."
President Ford has asked Congress to approve $222
million in emergency military aid for Cambodia and $300
million additional aid for South Vietnam.
In South Vietnam, Viet Cong gunners shot down an Air
Vietnam commercial airliner with 25 persons aboard
yesterday as thousands of North and South Vietnamese
troops battled for the third straight day in the streets of
Ban Me Thuot.
Meanwhile, Western diplomats said South Vietnam will
suffer months of bloody fighting as Hanoi mounts new
drives to discredit President Hguyen Van Thieu.
Communist-led gunners sharpened their aim on the
Phnom Penh, Cambodia, airfield yesterday, laying
explosives with increasing accuracy onto the runway and
parking area of the capital's last lifeline.
Military sources said 43 rockets and artillery shells
rained on the Pochentong airport in the eighth straight day
of intensive shelling.

Stans Enters Guilty Pleas
WASHINGTON — Former Commerce Secretary Maurice
H. Stans pleaded guilty yesterday to five misdemeanor
violations of federal campaign laws, committed while he
was raising $60 million for the 1972 re-election of former
President Nixon.
He is the third former member of Nixon's Cabinet to
either be convicted or plead guilty to criminal charges. A
fourth is awaiting trial.
Stans, who will be 67 next week, said all five violations
were committed unknowingly when he served as chairman
of the Finance Committee to Re-elect the President.
Asst. Special Prosecutor Thomas McBride, who
negotiated the plea with Stans and his lawyers over the
past several months, said two of the violations were
committed "in reckless disregard of the corporate source of
those funds."
Stans could receive up to one year in jail and $1000 in
fines on each of the five counts, although on a
misdemeanor charge a sentence much less than the
maximum is likely.

House Panel Approves Cambodia Aid
WASHINGTON — A House subcommittee recommended
yesterday that Congress provide $82.5 million in emergency
U.S. military aid for Cambodia after House Democrats took
a 169 to 49 vote policy stand against providing additional
military aid to either Cambodia or South Vietnam.
The House Foreign Affairs subcommittee voted 4 to 3 to
recommend the Cambodia military aid ona month-by-month
basis and only on condition that President Ford certify
each month that "the U.S. is undertaking specific steps to
end the conflict in Cambodia not later than June 30."
Ford would be required to certify each month that the
Cambodian government is seeking an accommodation with
the insurgents, that safe passage out of the country is
assured for officials who fear a bloodbath, and that the
United States is seeking U.N. oversight of "a peaceful and
orderly end to the conflict."
President Ford has asked Congress to approve $222
million in emergency military aid for Cambodia and $300
million additional aid for South Vietnam.
In South Vietnam, Viet Cong gunners shot down an Air
Vietnam commercial airliner with 25 persons aboard
yesterday as thousands of North and South Vietnamese
troops battled for the third straight day in the streets of
Ban Me Thuot.
Meanwhile, Western diplomats said South Vietnam will
suffer months of bloody fighting as Hanoi mounts new
drives to discredit President Hguyen Van Thieu.
Communist-led gunners sharpened their aim on the
Phnom Penh, Cambodia, airfield yesterday, laying
explosives with increasing accuracy onto the runway and
parking area of the capital's last lifeline.
Military sources said 43 rockets and artillery shells
rained on the Pochentong airport in the eighth straight day
of intensive shelling.

Stans Enters Guilty Pleas
WASHINGTON — Former Commerce Secretary Maurice
H. Stans pleaded guilty yesterday to five misdemeanor
violations of federal campaign laws, committed while he
was raising $60 million for the 1972 re-election of former
President Nixon.
He is the third former member of Nixon's Cabinet to
either be convicted or plead guilty to criminal charges. A
fourth is awaiting trial.
Stans, who will be 67 next week, said all five violations
were committed unknowingly when he served as chairman
of the Finance Committee to Re-elect the President.
Asst. Special Prosecutor Thomas McBride, who
negotiated the plea with Stans and his lawyers over the
past several months, said two of the violations were
committed "in reckless disregard of the corporate source of
those funds."
Stans could receive up to one year in jail and $1000 in
fines on each of the five counts, although on a
misdemeanor charge a sentence much less than the
maximum is likely.

Hearst Aeeomplices To Be Indieted?
HARRISBURG, Pa. — Indictments will be sought here
today against persons accused of harboring fugitive
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, according to two
newspaper accounts.
Stories by the San Francisco Chronicle and the
Scranton (Pa.) Tribu.ie said John Cottone, U.S. Attorney
for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, would seek the
indictments against an unknown number of persons.
Cottone said last night that he expects indictments to be
returned today, but he refused to say if they would be
related to the Hearst case.
"I wouldn't be able to tell you anything about that," he
said when asked if his investigation centered on the missing
newspaper heiress.
"We have a grand jury today, and we have some
witnesses coming in. I'm sure there will be indictments
returned, probably today."
The Chronicle's story, which was to appear in today's
newspaper edition was attributed to unidentified sources.
The Tribune's edition, which serves Cottone's home city
of Scranton, today carried a story which quoted a source in
Cottone's office.
The Tribune said Patty Hearst had been in northeastern
Pennyslvania. The area is near the home of a dead SLA
member, William Wolfe, for whom Miss Hearst professed
her love in a tape recording last year.
"This is the first I've heard anything about that,'"
Wolfe's father, Dr. L.S. Wolfe, said when asked about Miss
Hearst's whereabouts.
