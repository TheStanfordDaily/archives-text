# C-AAA Recommends Return Of D Grade
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
In a final report released earlier this
week, the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) formally
recommended reinstatement of the D
as a minimal passing grade.
The C-AAA also proposed:
—restriction of the incomplete
grade "to cases where a student has
satisfactorily completed a substantial
portion of the course work";
—changing the deadline for

dropping a course from 24 hours
before the final examination to any
time before the exam;
—abandoning the practice of
routinely computing each student's
grade average for internal office use;
—regular collation and publication
by the Registrar's Office of grade
distributions in the various schools of
the University; and
—that "the Registrar should
publicize widely both the regulations
concerning the pass option and the
approach of each quarter's final
deadline for choosing it."
The full text of the C-AAA's final
report appears on page seven of
today's Daily.
Rationale For D
In its rationale for recommending
reinstatement of the D, the Committee
said, "In part, we ascribe the present
concentration of grades in the A/B
range to the absence of any grade
lower than C."
A survey taken by the Registrar's
Office during the 1968-69 school year,
prior to the elimination of the D in
1970, indicated that, of all grades
received by undergraduates, 31
percent were A's, 36 percent were B's,
15 percent were C's and less than three
percent were D's.
A similar survey of grades given to
undergrads during the 1973-74 school
year found that the number of A's had
risen to 41 percent, while B's had
fallen off to 31 percent and C's had
dropped to eight percent — just
slightly more than half of the 1968-69
percentage.
The C-AAA report noted that "the
D would not be much used;
nevertheless, its mere existence might
be an incentive to move the
distribution of grades downward from
the present concentration at the upper
end."
'Revitalize C'
In addition, the Committee wrote
that "the present choice among only
three letter grades encourages too
heavy reliance on the A and B at the
expense of the C." Committee
members believe that reinstatement of
the D would have the effect of
"revitalizing the C," thereby providing
"a truer characterization of a student's
performance."
The C-AAA proposed the
restriction on incompletes because
