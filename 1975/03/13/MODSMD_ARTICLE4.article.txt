# C-AAA Recommends Return Of D Grade
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
In a final report released earlier this
week, the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) formally
recommended reinstatement of the D
as a minimal passing grade.
The C-AAA also proposed:
—restriction of the incomplete
grade "to cases where a student has
satisfactorily completed a substantial
portion of the course work";
—changing the deadline for

dropping a course from 24 hours
before the final examination to any
time before the exam;
—abandoning the practice of
routinely computing each student's
grade average for internal office use;
—regular collation and publication
by the Registrar's Office of grade
distributions in the various schools of
the University; and
—that "the Registrar should
publicize widely both the regulations
concerning the pass option and the
approach of each quarter's final
deadline for choosing it."
The full text of the C-AAA's final
report appears on page seven of
today's Daily.
Rationale For D
In its rationale for recommending
reinstatement of the D, the Committee
said, "In part, we ascribe the present
concentration of grades in the A/B
range to the absence of any grade
lower than C."
A survey taken by the Registrar's
Office during the 1968-69 school year,
prior to the elimination of the D in
1970, indicated that, of all grades
received by undergraduates, 31
percent were A's, 36 percent were B's,
15 percent were C's and less than three
percent were D's.
A similar survey of grades given to
undergrads during the 1973-74 school
year found that the number of A's had
risen to 41 percent, while B's had
fallen off to 31 percent and C's had
dropped to eight percent — just
slightly more than half of the 1968-69
percentage.
The C-AAA report noted that "the
D would not be much used;
nevertheless, its mere existence might
be an incentive to move the
distribution of grades downward from
the present concentration at the upper
end."
'Revitalize C'
In addition, the Committee wrote
that "the present choice among only
three letter grades encourages too
heavy reliance on the A and B at the
expense of the C." Committee
members believe that reinstatement of
the D would have the effect of
"revitalizing the C," thereby providing
"a truer characterization of a student's
performance."
The C-AAA proposed the
restriction on incompletes because
"the present policy provides virtually
no guidance for an instructor or a
student in deciding whether an
incomplt'te is justified." In such a
situation, "abuse no doubi occurs, but
such abuse cannot easily be
documented."
The Committee also recommended
that the time limit for satisfactory
completion of work in a course for
which an incomplete has been granted
should continue to "be determined by
the instructor, but ordinarily should
not be more than one calendar year
from the date of the final examination
in the course in question."
Several Committee members
described the drop deadline proposal
as "a minor change," and the C-AAA
report merely noted that the 24-hour
deadline is "unenforceable and
meaningless."
Narrow Vote
By a narrow 5-4 vote, the
Committee had rejected a
subcommittee proposal to move the

drop deadline for courses up to the
last day on which courses may be
added, or about seven weeks into the
quarter.
Once the C-AAA had rejected this
recommendation of the Ad Hoc Panel
to Study the Grading System, it easily
overturned another panel
recommendation to reinstate a
recorded "no-credit" grade to indicate
either withdrawal from a class after
the deadline or unsatisfactory
performance in the class.
The C-AAA voted against this
return to the "historical record" of
grades because "we were impressed by
the need for long-term continuity in
the grading policy, far longer than a
single student generation (roughly the
period since adopting the present
arrangement in 1970).
"Thus," the Committee said, "any
reason for change must be sufficiently
compelling to justify not only
long-term commitment to the altered
arrangements but also the act of
change itself."
In a final report released earlier this
week, the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) formally
recommended reinstatement of the D
as a minimal passing grade.

The C-AAA report noted that "the
D would not be much used;
nevertheless, its mere existence might
be an incentive to move the
distribution of grades downward from
the present concentration at the upper
end."
'Revitalize C'
In addition, the Committee wrote
that "the present choice among only
three letter grades encourages too
heavy reliance on the A and B at the
expense of the C." Committee
members believe that reinstatement of
the D would have the effect of
"revitalizing the C," thereby providing
"a truer characterization of a student's
performance."
The C-AAA proposed the
restriction on incompletes because
"the present policy provides virtually
no guidance for an instructor or a
student in deciding whether an
incomplt'te is justified." In such a
situation, "abuse no doubi occurs, but
such abuse cannot easily be
documented."
The Committee also recommended
that the time limit for satisfactory
completion of work in a course for
which an incomplete has been granted
should continue to "be determined by
the instructor, but ordinarily should
not be more than one calendar year
from the date of the final examination
in the course in question."
Several Committee members
described the drop deadline proposal
as "a minor change," and the C-AAA
report merely noted that the 24-hour
deadline is "unenforceable and
meaningless."
Narrow Vote
By a narrow 5-4 vote, the
Committee had rejected a
subcommittee proposal to move the

drop deadline for courses up to the
last day on which courses may be
added, or about seven weeks into the
quarter.
Once the C-AAA had rejected this
recommendation of the Ad Hoc Panel
to Study the Grading System, it easily
overturned another panel
recommendation to reinstate a
recorded "no-credit" grade to indicate
either withdrawal from a class after
the deadline or unsatisfactory
performance in the class.
The C-AAA voted against this
return to the "historical record" of
grades because "we were impressed by
the need for long-term continuity in
the grading policy, far longer than a
single student generation (roughly the
period since adopting the present
arrangement in 1970).
"Thus," the Committee said, "any
reason for change must be sufficiently
compelling to justify not only
long-term commitment to the altered
arrangements but also the act of
change itself."
In a final report released earlier this
week, the Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) formally
recommended reinstatement of the D
as a minimal passing grade.
The C-AAA also proposed:
—restriction of the incomplete
grade "to cases where a student has
satisfactorily completed a substantial
portion of the course work";
—changing the deadline for

dropping a course from 24 hours
before the final examination to any
time before the exam;
—abandoning the practice of
routinely computing each student's
grade average for internal office use;
—regular collation and publication
by the Registrar's Office of grade
distributions in the various schools of
the University; and
—that "the Registrar should
publicize widely both the regulations
concerning the pass option and the
approach of each quarter's final
deadline for choosing it."
The full text of the C-AAA's final
report appears on page seven of
today's Daily.
Rationale For D
In its rationale for recommending
reinstatement of the D, the Committee
said, "In part, we ascribe the present
concentration of grades in the A/B
range to the absence of any grade
lower than C."
A survey taken by the Registrar's
Office during the 1968-69 school year,
prior to the elimination of the D in
1970, indicated that, of all grades
received by undergraduates, 31
percent were A's, 36 percent were B's,
15 percent were C's and less than three
percent were D's.
A similar survey of grades given to
undergrads during the 1973-74 school
year found that the number of A's had
risen to 41 percent, while B's had
fallen off to 31 percent and C's had
dropped to eight percent — just
slightly more than half of the 1968-69
percentage.
The C-AAA report noted that "the
D would not be much used;
nevertheless, its mere existence might
be an incentive to move the
distribution of grades downward from
the present concentration at the upper
end."
