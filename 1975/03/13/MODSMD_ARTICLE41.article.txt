# University Stocks Register Gains
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Although University stocks delined
more than $20 million in value during
1974, they have registered significant
gains during the past two months,
according to Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger and Director of Finance
Rodney Adams.
"There was a very significant
difference between the value of the
stocks in December and their value in
January," Augsburger said.
Stocks in the University's yield and
gain pool declined 17.4 percent during
1974, but registered only a 10.6
percent decline between February
1974 and the end of January 1975.
Merged endowment stocks declined
7.4 percent during 1974 but declined a
mere 2.6 percent in the year ending

Feb. 1.
According to Augsburger,
University stocks have consistently
fared better than have most securities
of the New York Stock Exchange.
In the merged endowment pool,
University stocks during 1974 ranked
in the top nine percent of 3000
professionally managed endowment
funds on the exchange. Yield and gain
pool stocks were in the top 40
percent.
But despite income generated by
University stock investments during
the past year, total University
endowment has suffered a net decline,
Augsburger claimed.
Stanford fared better than most
universities during last year's stock
market decline, Adams noted.
According to Adams, the stock

market decline has not caused the
University to make any major changes
ip its basic patterns of investment. But
slightly greater emphasis is now being
placed on dividend producing stocks
rather than on stocks expected to
produce capital gains.
Adams and Augsburger agreed that
the current stock market dilemma has
not changed patterns of donations to
Stanford.
"Since our performance has been
better than most people's personal
performance in the stock market,
donors have not seemed reluctant to
continue giving money to the
University," Adams said. "Obviously
they are unhappy that the value of the
University's stocks is declining, but
when we explain to people how well
the University's stocks have been
doing in comparison to stocks as a
whole, they come away pretty
impressed."
