## Children Of Faculty: An 'Unusual Outlook' 
### BETSY MORRIS 
Approximately three percent of the
student body here have parents who
are on the faculty or staff. As many of
them point out, this has its advantages
and disadvantages. It also gives them a
somewhat unusual outlook on their
Stanford experience.
"I have a slightly different
perspective on the place," says one
student. "For instance, I realize that
professors have lives outside with
other commitments."
Most students who are faculty
children will agree that they do have
some different attitudes regarding
Stanford. They attribute this partially
to Stanford's location. The school is
close to their homes. For some, it is
home.
"I knew more about what there was
to do around here when I came," said
a student living in Palo Alto. "I was
used to it."
Different World
Though they have been familiar
with Stanford for most of their lives,
coming here as a student was another
story. Stanford was a different world.
"You know, I thought I knew the
place," says Kathy Siena, daughter of
James Siena, legal adviser to the
president. "But it's a totally different
environment. I didn't ever know how
(he system worked."
Sue Rosse adds that "my father
went off to work in the morning and I
never spent much time on campus."
Sue's father, James Rosse, is the
chairman of the Economics
Department.
Having established themselves here,
students cite several advantages of
being sons or daughters of faculty or
administrators. Some of these again
stem from their proximity to home.
"I go home once in a while, and
that's nice. I get to borrow the car and
that's nice. But I don't feel my parents
are breathing down my back," said
Ted McCluskey. Ted's father, Edward
McCluskey, is a computer science and
electrical engineering professor.
Inside Perspective
Sometimes knowing professors on a
personal basis is another benefit of
these students. They know who to go
to for advice. They can themselves
have an inside perspective on what
people they would like to take courses
from.
Kim White adds, "I can help my
friends who are in double-e when they
are choosing clasps." Kim's father,
Robert White is a professor in
Electrical Engineering.
Often, however, close association
with professors is one of the
disadvantages counterbalancing the
benefits of being a University child.
"Sometimes you just know the
professors too well to take courses

from them," one student claims. And
most are very wary of taking courses
from either their parent or any close
friends of that parent.
Sue Rosse, herself an economics
major, says "if I had to do it all over
again, and I was majoring in Econ, I
would go someplace else."
Peer reaction is noted as another
disadvantage of being a faculty child.
"Often you are made to feel that you
are here because you are a faculty
kid," said one student. "And not
because you are yourself."
Ridicule
Most seem to have gotten this
ridicule from other students at one
time or another. Some, like Kathy
Siena, seem to think that it is
predominant in freshman year, others
hardly notice it at all.
"They look at you as an individual,
which is kind of nice," says Kathy
adding that this type of reaction is not
much of a problem to her "because
most people either don't know who
my father is or they think that he is
pretty amiable."
Generally though, faculty children
will tell you that their lifestyles aren't
very different from anybody else at
Stanford.
"I get taken out to lunch at the
faculty club once in a while," says Ted
McCluskey. "But that's about all. I live
pretty much the way I want to," he
said.
Many of those interviewed had not
intended to come to Stanford when
they were in high school. They point
to the school's location as its major
drawback.
Kim White, who has lived in
California all her life, wanted "a
different climate, environment, and
different sorts of people." Kim came
here, though, because of the
educational opportunities that the
University had to offer.
More Important Reasons
Those who did decide to attend
Stanford also found more important
reasons weighing in the school's favor.
Some came because of a certain
department. Others came because the
school was the best of their choices.
For some, a special plan that existed
several years ago provides them with
full tuition. Since the plan has
changed, this benefit is no longer a
factor in an individual's decision to
come to Stanford. Now faculty and
staff children have a half-tuition
option for whichever college they
choose to attend.
Generally, though, they come to
Stanford for the same reasons that
almost everybody else does. They
want what Stanford, because it is
Stanford, has to give them.
"A classical liberal arts education,"
answers Kathy Siena. "A preparation
for med school," adds Ted McCluskey,
"as well as preparation for becoming a
well educated, influential member of
the community."
