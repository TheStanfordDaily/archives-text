# Except At Dorm's 'Pub Night'
## Crothers Hall Motto: 'Do Not Disturb' 
### PAM WOODS 
As you walk down the halls, nearly all the doors are
closed. A sign on one of them states: "Noise Annoys —
Shhhhhhhh!" and on another: "Please do not disturb."
The only voice to be heard sounds very much like a
recording of a lecturing professor giving his analysis of a
social theory ("I have grave doubts about its validity . . .")
but it isn't a professor; it's one student telling another his
views.
The lounge is empty, the television room is locked, and
there is no music from stereos as there is in other dorms.
Welcome to Crothers Hall, home of 137 Stanford
graduate students.
"Crothers is not all that bad," said one woman living
there. "It's physically a good place to live — big rooms, lots
of singles, a good location on campus.
"It's also stimulating and very interesting intellectually,"
she continued. "Some of the hallway talks at one in the
morning have been great. The problem with Crothers is
social."
'Pub Night'
"The social activity here is simply pub night," explained
a male resident. These pub nights are held each Thursday
and are simply gatherings with beer, pretzels, and
sometimes music.
"To see the real Crothers, you should come to a pub
night," asserted a female undergraduate. "It's really tense —
everybody's trying to pick each other up and there is just a
dearth of women In fact, the main complaint of guys
here is with the hardness of finding women."
"If you walk around and see how many doors are open
and how much interaction there is among the people here,
you'll see that it's practically zero," one man complained.
"People here aren't interested in others, they are too into

themselves."
"The only reason to live here is to save money," he
concluded. "It is poor compared to other dorms and to
other alternatives that a graduate student has."
Other residents enjoy Crothers' quiet atmosphere. "I like
everything that he just complained about," said one. "Sure
it's not a yea, rah-rah dorm ... it's quiet. I don't really like
parties; I'd rather plan my own social life."
Another explained the lack of what he called "hectic
activity" in the dorm. "Law students don't have time to do
all those things."
Because Crothers residents are not required to buy a
University food service meal plan, many center their social
life around the eating alternatives they have chosen —
joining an eating club, going out for meals, or sharing
cooking duties and meals with friends. "It's great not
having to eat dorm food, and it's infinitely cheaper," said
one resident.
More Residents Needed?
One non-law graduate student suggested that having
more residents from different disciplines would improve
Crothers. He said that those who were not law students
were "oddities" in Crothers.
There is a "machismo camaraderie" among male law
students, he said. "At pub night they all stand around with
their mugs full of beer talking law. After living here, I see
that all the things I read about lawyers in Doonesbury is
true."
But things may be changing at Crothers. "It really
doesn't fit the image that the rest of the community has
about it," said one resident.
Another says,"The RA'sare concerned with the image
of Crothers. They try to get us involved in all sorts of
activities ...

concluded. "It is poor compared to other dorms and to
other alternatives that a graduate student has."
Other residents enjoy Crothers' quiet atmosphere. "I like
everything that he just complained about," said one. "Sure
it's not a yea, rah-rah dorm ... it's quiet. I don't really like
parties; I'd rather plan my own social life."
Another explained the lack of what he called "hectic
activity" in the dorm. "Law students don't have time to do
all those things."
Because Crothers residents are not required to buy a
University food service meal plan, many center their social
life around the eating alternatives they have chosen —
joining an eating club, going out for meals, or sharing
cooking duties and meals with friends. "It's great not
having to eat dorm food, and it's infinitely cheaper," said
one resident.
More Residents Needed?
One non-law graduate student suggested that having
more residents from different disciplines would improve
Crothers. He said that those who were not law students
were "oddities" in Crothers.
There is a "machismo camaraderie" among male law
students, he said. "At pub night they all stand around with
their mugs full of beer talking law. After living here, I see
that all the things I read about lawyers in Doonesbury is
true."
But things may be changing at Crothers. "It really
doesn't fit the image that the rest of the community has
about it," said one resident.
Another says,"The RA'sare concerned with the image
of Crothers. They try to get us involved in all sorts of
activities ...
As you walk down the halls, nearly all the doors are
closed. A sign on one of them states: "Noise Annoys —
Shhhhhhhh!" and on another: "Please do not disturb."
The only voice to be heard sounds very much like a
recording of a lecturing professor giving his analysis of a
social theory ("I have grave doubts about its validity . . .")
but it isn't a professor; it's one student telling another his
views.
The lounge is empty, the television room is locked, and
there is no music from stereos as there is in other dorms.
Welcome to Crothers Hall, home of 137 Stanford
graduate students.
"Crothers is not all that bad," said one woman living
there. "It's physically a good place to live — big rooms, lots
of singles, a good location on campus.
"It's also stimulating and very interesting intellectually,"
she continued. "Some of the hallway talks at one in the
morning have been great. The problem with Crothers is
social."
'Pub Night'
"The social activity here is simply pub night," explained
a male resident. These pub nights are held each Thursday
and are simply gatherings with beer, pretzels, and
sometimes music.
"To see the real Crothers, you should come to a pub
night," asserted a female undergraduate. "It's really tense —
everybody's trying to pick each other up and there is just a
dearth of women In fact, the main complaint of guys
here is with the hardness of finding women."
"If you walk around and see how many doors are open
and how much interaction there is among the people here,
you'll see that it's practically zero," one man complained.
"People here aren't interested in others, they are too into

themselves."
"The only reason to live here is to save money," he
concluded. "It is poor compared to other dorms and to
other alternatives that a graduate student has."
