# The
						Late, Great Transcript Fraud
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
"Übiquitous" is an apt word to
describe John Q. Johnson 111, a
graduate student in political science.
Since last September, he has
worked in two banks as a management
trainee, enrolled in the University of
Chicago's highly selective Business
School program and gained admission
to two doctoral programs.
How did he accomplish so much?
Simple. There were two of him.
Apparently, an imposter assumed
Johnson's identity last fall and used
his qualifications and records to obtain
employment, and admission to at least
four major universities.
The imposter merely wrote a
request '.o Harvard University, where

Johnson had graduated in 1973 with
honors, and requested that at least
eight copies of Johnson's college
transcript be sent to institutions where
he was applying for admission or a job.
The unknown man just as easily
had Johnson's Graduate Record Exam
scores sent the universities to which he
applied.
Easy To Get Both
"Apparently, he got both just by
writing and asking for them," said
Johnson.
The imposter applied to "about
seven or eight universities — Yale,
Carnegie-Mellon, University of
Chicago, Cornell, George Washington
and Howard" probably among these,
always applying to the business

schools, Johnson said.
The mystery man was accepted at
Carnegie-Mellon, Cornell, George
Washington University and University
of Chicago, as far as he knows, said
Johnson. In fact, the imposter used a
letter of recommendation from George
Washington University to get the job
at Mellon bank, he added.
"He appeared at Mellon Bank,
claiming to be me with a few minor
exceptions," John explained.
These "minor exceptions"
consisted of claiming that he was a
track-star and a highly-decorated
Army veteran, he said.
Black And White
Another difference between the
real Johnson and the imposter is that
the imposter was black, while Johnson
is white.
It was these discrepancies that
eventually foiled the imposter's plans,
Johnson noted.
The unknown man was discovered
by University of Chicago officials in
late December, after he had enrolled in
its Graduate School of Business, and
received a $5000 educational grant
from the First National City Bank of
New York.
While talking to the man, the
officials discovered that he knew
nothing about track, said Johnson,
explaining that the university then
called Harvard and verified that he
wasn't the real Johnson.
The University of Chicago business
school dean next confronted the
imposter with charges that he had
been admitted to the M£ A program
under false pretenses. The man denied
these charges and left the school.
'One Big Joke'
"Since that time, the guy has
vanished," said Johnson, "although he
resurfaced for a while, trying to cash
some checks in Lake Tahoe.
"I wish I knew how he stumbled
onto this," Johnson mused. "I have
seen his picture, and I don't recognize
it. It is conceivable that we could have
a mutual friend, although that's just
speculation."
He noted that the imposter had
known a little about Harvard and his
activities while attending the
University.
