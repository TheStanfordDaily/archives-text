# Less Cash Equals More Trash
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Brown, unkept lawns, untended
flowerbeds, untrimmed hedges,
trash-strewn pathways, roads
pock-marked with unfilled potholes,
professors emptying the wastebaskets
— this is Stanford?
It could be, according to Service
Operations Director Dan DeYoung.
He says the University's financial
problems have forced continuing
cutbacks in maintenance and
operations services. The University
budget for 1975-76 calls for a
$457,000 reduction, a 10.2 percent
increase in the service operations
budget base.
The cuts break down this way:
— a $109,000 slice from the
$981,000 now spent for building
maintenance. About $697,000 for
upkeep of academic buildings
represents the lion's share of this
category. Also included are $100,000
for lightbulb replacements, $15,000
for furniture replacements, $5000 to
maintain the University-owned home
of chancellor J.E. Wallace Sterling,
$24,000 for the president's house, and
$2000 for the dean of the chapel's
residence. Upkeep of student
residences is budgeted separately.
Trash Disposal
— a slash of about $46,000 from
the $571,000 now spent for grounds
upkeep. This includes trash disposal
costs of about $50,000, parking lot
and road upkeep of roughly $61,000
and $148,000 for general grounds
maintenance.
— a cut of $176,000 from the
$1,181,000 cost of custodial service
contracts. The University has signed
three-year contracts with two
independent custodial firms. Under
the contracts, which expire in 1977,
the University can specify the levels of
service it needs at various times of the
year without a change in its service
rate.
— other reductions in miscellaneous
plant and procurement services.

This isn't the first time the
University has scrimped on campus
maintenance, DeYoung reports.
During the five-year Budget
Adjustment Program which ended last
year, maintenance cuts included the
upkeep of the Oval, the grassy area at
the end of Palm Drive. When the Oval
turned into a parched weed patch "it
had a psychological effect on people's
attitudes towards the University,"
DeYoung says.
In response to numerous
complaints from alumni and campus
officials, the Oval lawn was restored.
This time, DeYoung plans a more
subtle cutback strategy.
"We won't expect to get any
sympathy by letting the most obvious
areas of the campus go to pot," he
explains. "We'll try to abandon only
the least obvious sites."
Less Money
Nevertheless, the effects of having
less money to spend for general
maintenance will be noticeable,
DeYoung adds.
Already, daily maintenance in most
academic buildings has been cut to.
two or three times per week. Lawns
are mowed less frequently. Plant
Services will respond more slowly to
requests for repairs.
DeYoung has already received
alumni complaints about the condition
of rosebushes along El Camino Real,
the disappearance of flowerbeds, and
the general condition of the roads.
"The alumni complain that Palm Drive
looks ratty," he says. "In today's
dollars, we were spending twice as
much for maintenance five years ago
as we do now. The alumni remember
the way the campus was maintained
during a period of growth."
Inevitable
But cuts are inevitable as University
budgeteers weigh a possible $176,000
cut in custodial services against the
number of professors that same
amount of money could buy,

A VIEW FROM THE TOP—That's one way to look at the Oval in front of the
Quad—framed in one of Hoover Tower's iron grates. It's a panoramic scene, but
Service Operations Director Dan De Young says that couid all change. After
budget cutbacks next year, cost may force his crews from maintaining the area's
lawns and flower beds.
