# Law School To Open On Schedule For Full Operation This Summer
## 
### PATRICK McCARTHY 
The new law school will open on
schedule this June, according to Assoc.
Law School Dean Joseph Leininger.
"We are assured by the contractor
that the building will be ready,"
Leininger says,"and we are planning
to move in the day after
Commencement." He expects the new
complex to be in full operation for
summer session.
With a front entrance facing Meyer
Library, the new $11.9 million
"Crown Quadrangle" (named for a
large donor) will consist of four
connected buildings: a four-story
combined library-faculty office
building, a classroom building, the
James Irvine Gallery containing
seminar rooms and student and faculty
lounges, and the 600-seat Kresge

Auditorium. A large, open-air
courtyard is situated in the middle of
the complex.
"It will be a big change from what
we're used to," declares Law Prof.
John Merryman, chairman of the Law
School Building Committee since its
inception in 1965. "But we think it
will be a benign, productive and
enriching one. There will be more
room for everypne, it will be new and,
most important, it will be the first
time at Stanford that a building was
designed specifically for the Law
School."
Perhaps the biggest change for law
students will be in the library. "It is
the heart of a law school," says
Merryman, "and a large part of the life
of a law student is spent there." In the
new complex, a student will have more
space, more facilities (typewriters, for
instance, will be available in the
basement) and greater access to
research material.
Little Space
"Our present building has very little
space," explains Law Librarian Myron
Jacobstein. "Twenty-five percent of
our collection is in storage and
virtually inaccessible."
Jacobstein also indicated that the
library has not acquired certain books
because of the lack of space. "We now
have 225,000 volumes and that might
seem like a lot. But Michigan has
400,000 and Yale and Columbia have
a half-million each." In fact,
Stanford's law library now ranks 16th
in the nation, Jacobstein said. In the
most recent survey, the Law School
ranked sixth.
He also revealed that the library has
never conformed to the standards of
the American Law Library Association
which stipulate that a library ought to
have seating capacity for at least 65
percent of its students. "We can only
fit 25 percent now," he said. "But in

the new library it will be very close to
100 percent."
As originally planned, every law
student was to be assigned A study
carrel among the open stacks for three
years. But those plans were
abandoned. "It just would have been
too expensive," says Jacobstein.
"Besides, law education has changed
since we first developed our program
11 years ago. There are now a lot of
students in the 'extern' program and
others are involved in clinical legal
education. They are away from the
school for long periods."
Also, he said, many students have
desks in law student organizations. But
he insisted any student who wants a
carrel can get one on an informal basis.
Increased
The number of classrooms will also
be increased in the new complex.
Presently, over 100 courses meet in six
Law School classrooms, the moot
court room and a borrowed classroom.
Classes must begin early in the
morning, meet during lunchtime and
continue into the evening to fit into
the limited space.
But the new classroom building will
relieve much of the congestion. It will
have several small and medium-sized
seminar rooms and nine full-sized
classrooms that accommodate from 35
to 175 students. In addition, there is
the Kresge Auditorium and a new
140-seat moot courtroom equipped
with closed-circuit television facilities.
The classroom building also has several
rooms designed for law student
organizations.
Aesthetic considerations have also
played a substantial role in the design
of the new complex. The interior
designer, Michael Bolton of John Bull
Associates, is making full use of
graphics throughout the "quadrangle,"
but especially in classrooms.

"They [the graphics| will be more
pleasant and productive," says
Merryman. And he indicated that art
work will enjoy a prominent place in
the new Law School. A 14-foot
Dame Barbara Hepworth bronze
sculpture has already been borrowed
on a long-term basis from the Norton
Simon Foundation. Situated at the
entrance, "it will be the best piece of
architectural sculpture on campus,"
declares Merryman.
The school has acquired other
sculpture work for the interior.
Merryman insists the school is "not
openly soliciting works of art," but he
did say that his committee is working
with a Los Angeles art dealer to
borrow pieces of art. He emphasized,
however, that the Law School will not
buy works, but only borrow on a
long-term basis.

basement) and greater access to
research material.
Little Space
"Our present building has very little
space," explains Law Librarian Myron
Jacobstein. "Twenty-five percent of
our collection is in storage and
virtually inaccessible."
Jacobstein also indicated that the
library has not acquired certain books
because of the lack of space. "We now
have 225,000 volumes and that might
seem like a lot. But Michigan has
400,000 and Yale and Columbia have
a half-million each." In fact,
Stanford's law library now ranks 16th
in the nation, Jacobstein said. In the
most recent survey, the Law School
ranked sixth.
He also revealed that the library has
never conformed to the standards of
the American Law Library Association
which stipulate that a library ought to
have seating capacity for at least 65
percent of its students. "We can only
fit 25 percent now," he said. "But in

the new library it will be very close to
100 percent."
As originally planned, every law
student was to be assigned A study
carrel among the open stacks for three
years. But those plans were
abandoned. "It just would have been
too expensive," says Jacobstein.
"Besides, law education has changed
since we first developed our program
11 years ago. There are now a lot of
students in the 'extern' program and
others are involved in clinical legal
education. They are away from the
school for long periods."
Also, he said, many students have
desks in law student organizations. But
he insisted any student who wants a
carrel can get one on an informal basis.
Increased
The number of classrooms will also
be increased in the new complex.
Presently, over 100 courses meet in six
Law School classrooms, the moot
court room and a borrowed classroom.
Classes must begin early in the
morning, meet during lunchtime and
continue into the evening to fit into
the limited space.
But the new classroom building will
relieve much of the congestion. It will
have several small and medium-sized
seminar rooms and nine full-sized
classrooms that accommodate from 35
to 175 students. In addition, there is
the Kresge Auditorium and a new
140-seat moot courtroom equipped
with closed-circuit television facilities.
The classroom building also has several
rooms designed for law student
organizations.
Aesthetic considerations have also
played a substantial role in the design
of the new complex. The interior
designer, Michael Bolton of John Bull
Associates, is making full use of
graphics throughout the "quadrangle,"
but especially in classrooms.

"They [the graphics| will be more
pleasant and productive," says
Merryman. And he indicated that art
work will enjoy a prominent place in
the new Law School. A 14-foot
Dame Barbara Hepworth bronze
sculpture has already been borrowed
on a long-term basis from the Norton
Simon Foundation. Situated at the
entrance, "it will be the best piece of
architectural sculpture on campus,"
declares Merryman.
The school has acquired other
sculpture work for the interior.
Merryman insists the school is "not
openly soliciting works of art," but he
did say that his committee is working
with a Los Angeles art dealer to
borrow pieces of art. He emphasized,
however, that the Law School will not
buy works, but only borrow on a
long-term basis.
The new law school will open on
schedule this June, according to Assoc.
Law School Dean Joseph Leininger.
"We are assured by the contractor
that the building will be ready,"
Leininger says,"and we are planning
to move in the day after
Commencement." He expects the new
complex to be in full operation for
summer session.
With a front entrance facing Meyer
Library, the new $11.9 million
"Crown Quadrangle" (named for a
large donor) will consist of four
connected buildings: a four-story
combined library-faculty office
building, a classroom building, the
James Irvine Gallery containing
seminar rooms and student and faculty
lounges, and the 600-seat Kresge

Auditorium. A large, open-air
courtyard is situated in the middle of
the complex.
"It will be a big change from what
we're used to," declares Law Prof.
John Merryman, chairman of the Law
School Building Committee since its
inception in 1965. "But we think it
will be a benign, productive and
enriching one. There will be more
room for everypne, it will be new and,
most important, it will be the first
time at Stanford that a building was
designed specifically for the Law
School."
Perhaps the biggest change for law
students will be in the library. "It is
the heart of a law school," says
Merryman, "and a large part of the life
of a law student is spent there." In the
new complex, a student will have more
space, more facilities (typewriters, for
instance, will be available in the

carrel can get one on an informal basis.
Increased
The number of classrooms will also
be increased in the new complex.
Presently, over 100 courses meet in six
Law School classrooms, the moot
court room and a borrowed classroom.
Classes must begin early in the
morning, meet during lunchtime and
continue into the evening to fit into
the limited space.
But the new classroom building will
relieve much of the congestion. It will
have several small and medium-sized
seminar rooms and nine full-sized
classrooms that accommodate from 35
to 175 students. In addition, there is
the Kresge Auditorium and a new
140-seat moot courtroom equipped
with closed-circuit television facilities.
The classroom building also has several
rooms designed for law student
organizations.
Aesthetic considerations have also
played a substantial role in the design
of the new complex. The interior
designer, Michael Bolton of John Bull
Associates, is making full use of
graphics throughout the "quadrangle,"
but especially in classrooms.

"They [the graphics| will be more
pleasant and productive," says
Merryman. And he indicated that art
work will enjoy a prominent place in
the new Law School. A 14-foot
Dame Barbara Hepworth bronze
sculpture has already been borrowed
on a long-term basis from the Norton
Simon Foundation. Situated at the
entrance, "it will be the best piece of
architectural sculpture on campus,"
declares Merryman.
The school has acquired other
sculpture work for the interior.
Merryman insists the school is "not
openly soliciting works of art," but he
did say that his committee is working
with a Los Angeles art dealer to
borrow pieces of art. He emphasized,
however, that the Law School will not
buy works, but only borrow on a
long-term basis.
The new law school will open on
schedule this June, according to Assoc.
Law School Dean Joseph Leininger.
"We are assured by the contractor
that the building will be ready,"
Leininger says,"and we are planning
to move in the day after
Commencement." He expects the new
complex to be in full operation for
summer session.
With a front entrance facing Meyer
Library, the new $11.9 million
"Crown Quadrangle" (named for a
large donor) will consist of four
connected buildings: a four-story
combined library-faculty office
building, a classroom building, the
James Irvine Gallery containing
seminar rooms and student and faculty
lounges, and the 600-seat Kresge

Auditorium. A large, open-air
courtyard is situated in the middle of
the complex.
"It will be a big change from what
we're used to," declares Law Prof.
John Merryman, chairman of the Law
School Building Committee since its
inception in 1965. "But we think it
will be a benign, productive and
enriching one. There will be more
room for everypne, it will be new and,
most important, it will be the first
time at Stanford that a building was
designed specifically for the Law
School."
Perhaps the biggest change for law
students will be in the library. "It is
the heart of a law school," says
Merryman, "and a large part of the life
of a law student is spent there." In the
new complex, a student will have more
space, more facilities (typewriters, for
instance, will be available in the
basement) and greater access to
research material.
Little Space
"Our present building has very little
space," explains Law Librarian Myron
Jacobstein. "Twenty-five percent of
our collection is in storage and
virtually inaccessible."
Jacobstein also indicated that the
library has not acquired certain books
because of the lack of space. "We now
have 225,000 volumes and that might
seem like a lot. But Michigan has
400,000 and Yale and Columbia have
a half-million each." In fact,
Stanford's law library now ranks 16th
in the nation, Jacobstein said. In the
most recent survey, the Law School
ranked sixth.
He also revealed that the library has
never conformed to the standards of
the American Law Library Association
which stipulate that a library ought to
have seating capacity for at least 65
percent of its students. "We can only
fit 25 percent now," he said. "But in

the new library it will be very close to
100 percent."
As originally planned, every law
student was to be assigned A study
carrel among the open stacks for three
years. But those plans were
abandoned. "It just would have been
too expensive," says Jacobstein.
"Besides, law education has changed
since we first developed our program
11 years ago. There are now a lot of
students in the 'extern' program and
others are involved in clinical legal
education. They are away from the
school for long periods."
Also, he said, many students have
desks in law student organizations. But
he insisted any student who wants a
carrel can get one on an informal basis.

The number of classrooms will also
be increased in the new complex.
Presently, over 100 courses meet in six
