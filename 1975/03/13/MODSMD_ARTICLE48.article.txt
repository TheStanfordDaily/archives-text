## 
### RICHARD CHONG LINK HOCHNADEL 
"There is a significant shortage of
student input into the upper echelons
[of the University]," said Dan Poston,
a Florence Moore resident and
co-ordinator of Students Concerned
and Upset about Stanford.
About 25 students, including ASSU
Vice President Quinn Mayer and
representatives of at least two slates of
presidential hopefuls, attended the
initial meeting for SCUZ last Thursday
evening in the Faisan Lounge of
Florence Moore, participating in the
ensuing discussion of University
politics and student rights.
Poston, a co-author of Horton
Hears a Crunch, a response to the
disruption of Florence Moore activities
by the construction of new residence
units in the complex, spoke of the
needs for unity among the diverse
elements of student' discontent, and
for opening lines of communication
from the students to the University
administration, referring especially to

those students who do not live on
campus.
Other students expressed
dissatisfaction with the proposed
minority aid program, the exorbitant
pricing and inefficient management of
the Transition and the alleged
railroading of University policy
contrary to students' desires.
The issue generating the most
commentduringthe evening concerned
the role of the ASSU in bringing
student opinion to the attention of the
head administrators of the University.
Poston, member of the Committee on
Student Services, termed the student
government "ineffectual" and "full of
politicos too concerned with the
completion of their pet projects."
Mayer defended the ASSU's
primary concern as the instigation of
those projects which seemed beneficial
to the students, such as the lecture
notes, which he said were well
accepted by the students, and the
plans for a record co-op, which were
previously rejected in a student
referendum.
