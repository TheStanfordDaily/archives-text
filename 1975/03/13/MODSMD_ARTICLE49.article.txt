## Too Few Dancers On ABT Program 
### JANICE ROSS 
SAN FRANCISCO—The critic
Clive Barnes once referred to the
American Ballet Theatre as our
National Gallery of Dance.
Barnes' metaphor is apt. There is
no other major dance company
performing in America today that
can boast such a comprehensive
repertoire and such a
distinguished collection of
dancers.
Foremost among the ABT
dancers are the renowned
defectors: the Hungarian Ivan
Nagy and the Russians Natalia
Makarova and Mikhail
Baryshnikov. While the addition
of these stellar personalities helps
to draw audiences, it also serves to
lessen the over-all effectiveness of
ABT as a performing unit.
The result is that the dances
are used more as vehicles of
individual virtuousity and
technical display than as
cornerstones of a well-integrated
program.
Regrettably this was the
situation of ABT's Opera House
concert last Saturday Night. Two
of the four dances performed
were duets, one was a quartet, and
the fourth dance, although an
ensemble piece, was centered
around the talents of five
principal dancers.
Apparent Inequity
An arrangement like this is
extraordinarily inequitable when
one remembers that there are
66 dancers listed as
performing members of the ACT
Company.
However it always seems that
the most übiquitous dancers are
those soloists like Makarova and
Baryshnikov, both of whom have
recently been forced to cancel
owing to injuries from a too
demanding performance schedule.
Baryshnikov's cancellation
afforded ABT just the excuse it
needed to insert some
cast-of-thousands spectacular. But
instead another "glittering dance
personality," Rudy Bryans, was
imported from the Ballet de
Marseilles, to dance Baryshnikov's
part in the obscure Cocteau duet,
Le Juene Homme et La Mort.
Exceptional Skill
Bryans is obviously a dancer of
exceptional skill, yet the feint
drama and West Side Story-ish
narrative choreography of Le
Juene Homme belied his talents.
Originally choreographed in 1946,
the piece was intended to blend
classical ballet, jazz styling and
gymnastic prowess in a boy-meets
loses-girl tale.
In some respects the ballet
succeeds; there is a potent
frustration and tension conveyed
by Bryans' soaring grand jetes
within the confines of his Parisian
garrett.Yet parts of it are kitschy;
Bonnie Mathis' petulantly
crushing a burning cigarette with
the point of her toe shoe, and
Bryans' series of sustained
head-over-heels falls in response to
Mathis' angry battements.
Mask Of Death
The final scene, where Bryans
dons the mask of death and

majestically ascends over the roof
tops of Paris struck me as banal
and obfuscating. What had, up
until that point, been a piognant
love duet suddenly became a
moral allegory. And the power of
Cocteau's original statement was
lost to some vain stab at universal
profundity.
In contrast, Glen Tetley's
abstract quartet, Gemini, was a
candid and unobstrusive look at
parameters of human contact.
Unlike Le Juene Homme there
was no message here, only silent
passages, aborted couplings, and
pregnant stillnesses.
Tetley's choreography conveys
a unique sense of gravity. The
dancers seem to be constantly
pulled to the floor, yet they never
fully give in — especially the
women, who move with the
unrelenting tautness of being
continually on pointe whether
they are in a fetal curl on the
floor or reclining on the languid
body of their partner.

DOG DAYS—Carole Cook and Tom Troupe star in the new — and
according to reviewer David W. Moyer, mostly banal — Arthur Hailey
comedy "Father's Day." The play is being performed at the Marines'
Theatre in San Francisco.
Tetley's choreography is
ideally suited to the ABT metier;
it is the kind of stuff that elicits
appreciative gasps from an
audience eager to appear
knowledgeable in the presence of
a sometimes bewildering art form.
And it enhances the native
showmanship of principals like
Cynthia Gregory and Charles
Ward, the lead couple in Gemini.
For most of the audience
however, the highlight of
Saturday evening's performance
was the Makarova-Nagy Don
Quixote Pas De Deux. Despite an
injured knee Makarova was every
bit the ebuillent, saucy and
charismatic Dulcinea one has
come to expect.
Her eternally flexible torso,
articulate feet and teasing
toesteps coupled with her
demonstrative characterization
made it apparent that here was a
master performing. Nagy also had
his moments of brillance. His
magnificant floating grande saut
de basques and single hand lifts
were dazzling.
Kenneth MacMillan's Concerto,
the program's opening piece, was
a study of English precision and
order. The most stirring moment
was when a cordon of 30
dancers, cleverly arranged
according to hair color, executed
a sequence of deceptively simple
yet surprisingly effective
arabesques, port-de-bras and
battements tendus.
ABT will be performing
through next Sunday in UCB's
Zellerbach Auditorium, and if you
haven't seen much dance, it's an
excellent opportunity to tour the
gallery.

Nagy and the Russians Natalia
Makarova and Mikhail
Baryshnikov. While the addition
of these stellar personalities helps
to draw audiences, it also serves to
lessen the over-all effectiveness of
ABT as a performing unit.
The result is that the dances
are used more as vehicles of
individual virtuousity and
technical display than as
cornerstones of a well-integrated
program.
Regrettably this was the
situation of ABT's Opera House
concert last Saturday Night. Two
of the four dances performed
were duets, one was a quartet, and
the fourth dance, although an
ensemble piece, was centered
around the talents of five
principal dancers.
Apparent Inequity
An arrangement like this is
extraordinarily inequitable when
one remembers that there are
66 dancers listed as
performing members of the ACT
Company.
However it always seems that
the most übiquitous dancers are
those soloists like Makarova and
Baryshnikov, both of whom have
recently been forced to cancel
owing to injuries from a too
demanding performance schedule.
Baryshnikov's cancellation
afforded ABT just the excuse it
needed to insert some
cast-of-thousands spectacular. But
instead another "glittering dance
personality," Rudy Bryans, was
imported from the Ballet de
Marseilles, to dance Baryshnikov's
part in the obscure Cocteau duet,
Le Juene Homme et La Mort.
Exceptional Skill
Bryans is obviously a dancer of
exceptional skill, yet the feint
drama and West Side Story-ish
narrative choreography of Le
Juene Homme belied his talents.
Originally choreographed in 1946,
the piece was intended to blend
classical ballet, jazz styling and
gymnastic prowess in a boy-meets
loses-girl tale.
In some respects the ballet
succeeds; there is a potent
frustration and tension conveyed
by Bryans' soaring grand jetes
within the confines of his Parisian
garrett.Yet parts of it are kitschy;
Bonnie Mathis' petulantly
crushing a burning cigarette with
the point of her toe shoe, and
Bryans' series of sustained
head-over-heels falls in response to
Mathis' angry battements.
Mask Of Death
The final scene, where Bryans
dons the mask of death and

majestically ascends over the roof
tops of Paris struck me as banal
and obfuscating. What had, up
until that point, been a piognant
love duet suddenly became a
moral allegory. And the power of
Cocteau's original statement was
lost to some vain stab at universal
profundity.
In contrast, Glen Tetley's
abstract quartet, Gemini, was a
candid and unobstrusive look at
parameters of human contact.
Unlike Le Juene Homme there
was no message here, only silent
passages, aborted couplings, and
pregnant stillnesses.
Tetley's choreography conveys
a unique sense of gravity. The
dancers seem to be constantly
pulled to the floor, yet they never
fully give in — especially the
women, who move with the
unrelenting tautness of being
continually on pointe whether
they are in a fetal curl on the
floor or reclining on the languid
body of their partner.

DOG DAYS—Carole Cook and Tom Troupe star in the new — and
according to reviewer David W. Moyer, mostly banal — Arthur Hailey
comedy "Father's Day." The play is being performed at the Marines'
Theatre in San Francisco.
Tetley's choreography is
ideally suited to the ABT metier;
it is the kind of stuff that elicits
appreciative gasps from an
audience eager to appear
knowledgeable in the presence of
a sometimes bewildering art form.
And it enhances the native
showmanship of principals like
Cynthia Gregory and Charles
Ward, the lead couple in Gemini.
For most of the audience
however, the highlight of
Saturday evening's performance
was the Makarova-Nagy Don
Quixote Pas De Deux. Despite an
injured knee Makarova was every
bit the ebuillent, saucy and
charismatic Dulcinea one has
come to expect.
Her eternally flexible torso,
articulate feet and teasing
toesteps coupled with her
demonstrative characterization
made it apparent that here was a
master performing. Nagy also had
his moments of brillance. His
magnificant floating grande saut
de basques and single hand lifts
were dazzling.
Kenneth MacMillan's Concerto,
the program's opening piece, was
a study of English precision and
order. The most stirring moment
was when a cordon of 30
dancers, cleverly arranged
according to hair color, executed
a sequence of deceptively simple
yet surprisingly effective
arabesques, port-de-bras and
battements tendus.
ABT will be performing
through next Sunday in UCB's
Zellerbach Auditorium, and if you
haven't seen much dance, it's an
excellent opportunity to tour the
gallery.
SAN FRANCISCO—The critic
Clive Barnes once referred to the

situation of ABT's Opera House
concert last Saturday Night. Two
of the four dances performed
were duets, one was a quartet, and
the fourth dance, although an
ensemble piece, was centered
around the talents of five
principal dancers.
Apparent Inequity
An arrangement like this is
extraordinarily inequitable when
one remembers that there are
66 dancers listed as
performing members of the ACT
Company.
However it always seems that
the most übiquitous dancers are
those soloists like Makarova and
Baryshnikov, both of whom have
recently been forced to cancel
owing to injuries from a too
demanding performance schedule.
Baryshnikov's cancellation
afforded ABT just the excuse it
needed to insert some
cast-of-thousands spectacular. But
instead another "glittering dance
personality," Rudy Bryans, was
imported from the Ballet de
Marseilles, to dance Baryshnikov's
part in the obscure Cocteau duet,
Le Juene Homme et La Mort.
Exceptional Skill
Bryans is obviously a dancer of
exceptional skill, yet the feint
drama and West Side Story-ish
narrative choreography of Le
Juene Homme belied his talents.
Originally choreographed in 1946,
the piece was intended to blend
classical ballet, jazz styling and
gymnastic prowess in a boy-meets
loses-girl tale.
In some respects the ballet
succeeds; there is a potent
frustration and tension conveyed
by Bryans' soaring grand jetes
within the confines of his Parisian
garrett.Yet parts of it are kitschy;
Bonnie Mathis' petulantly
crushing a burning cigarette with
the point of her toe shoe, and
Bryans' series of sustained
head-over-heels falls in response to
Mathis' angry battements.
Mask Of Death
The final scene, where Bryans
dons the mask of death and

majestically ascends over the roof
tops of Paris struck me as banal
and obfuscating. What had, up
until that point, been a piognant
love duet suddenly became a
moral allegory. And the power of
Cocteau's original statement was
lost to some vain stab at universal
profundity.
In contrast, Glen Tetley's
abstract quartet, Gemini, was a
candid and unobstrusive look at
parameters of human contact.
Unlike Le Juene Homme there
was no message here, only silent
passages, aborted couplings, and
pregnant stillnesses.
Tetley's choreography conveys
a unique sense of gravity. The
dancers seem to be constantly
pulled to the floor, yet they never
fully give in — especially the
women, who move with the
unrelenting tautness of being
continually on pointe whether
they are in a fetal curl on the
floor or reclining on the languid
body of their partner.

DOG DAYS—Carole Cook and Tom Troupe star in the new — and
according to reviewer David W. Moyer, mostly banal — Arthur Hailey
comedy "Father's Day." The play is being performed at the Marines'
Theatre in San Francisco.
Tetley's choreography is
ideally suited to the ABT metier;
it is the kind of stuff that elicits
appreciative gasps from an
audience eager to appear
knowledgeable in the presence of
a sometimes bewildering art form.
And it enhances the native
showmanship of principals like
Cynthia Gregory and Charles
Ward, the lead couple in Gemini.
For most of the audience
however, the highlight of
Saturday evening's performance
was the Makarova-Nagy Don
Quixote Pas De Deux. Despite an
injured knee Makarova was every
bit the ebuillent, saucy and
charismatic Dulcinea one has
come to expect.
Her eternally flexible torso,
articulate feet and teasing
toesteps coupled with her
demonstrative characterization
made it apparent that here was a
master performing. Nagy also had
his moments of brillance. His
magnificant floating grande saut
de basques and single hand lifts
were dazzling.
Kenneth MacMillan's Concerto,
the program's opening piece, was
a study of English precision and
order. The most stirring moment
was when a cordon of 30
dancers, cleverly arranged
according to hair color, executed
a sequence of deceptively simple
yet surprisingly effective
arabesques, port-de-bras and
battements tendus.
ABT will be performing
through next Sunday in UCB's
Zellerbach Auditorium, and if you
haven't seen much dance, it's an
excellent opportunity to tour the
gallery.
SAN FRANCISCO—The critic
Clive Barnes once referred to the
American Ballet Theatre as our
National Gallery of Dance.
Barnes' metaphor is apt. There is
no other major dance company
performing in America today that
can boast such a comprehensive
repertoire and such a
distinguished collection of
dancers.
Foremost among the ABT
dancers are the renowned
defectors: the Hungarian Ivan
Nagy and the Russians Natalia
Makarova and Mikhail
Baryshnikov. While the addition
of these stellar personalities helps
to draw audiences, it also serves to
lessen the over-all effectiveness of
ABT as a performing unit.
The result is that the dances
are used more as vehicles of
individual virtuousity and
technical display than as
cornerstones of a well-integrated
program.
Regrettably this was the
situation of ABT's Opera House
concert last Saturday Night. Two
