# Chamber Orchestra Soloists Star
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
Stanford is blessed with an exceptional
array of talented musicians, both students
and faculty. The music performed by the
Stanford Chamber Orchestra last Thursday
night offered a challenging test of technique
and musicianship that the group was
generally well prepared for.
The performance of Haydn's Symphony
No. 6 in D Major, Le Matin, illustrated the
talent of several student musicians. Violinist
Susan Freier, concertmistress of both the
Chamber Orchestra and the Stanford
Symphony, performed her extensive solos
beautifully.
She gets good tone and projection from
her instrument, a feat that is difficult even
for the pros when performing against a large
group. Her intonation and bow control was
excellent except for a few minor passages in
the Finale.
Peter Shelton, cellist, also handled his
solos quite well. Although he has a beautiful
instrument, his talent and sensitivity are just
as responsible for his reverberating, mellow
tone. His fault lies in the fact that
exaggerated movement and intense facial
expressions sometimes substitute for solid,
unaffected playing.
Bassoon Duo
Bassoonist James Duncan and Bassist
Shinji Eshima performed their difficult duets

perfectly. Each instrument is difficult enough
to play in tune, let alone together, but the
two accomplished it without error.
Eshima is particularly good as the stringed
bass is difficult to control, but he played it
effortlessly, giving careful attention to
intonation and expression throughout the
solo.
Marie Bird, flutist, did not have as
extensive a solo as the strings but her light,
delicate, and clean sound quality was a
pleasure. Amateur flutists are often plagued
with a strained, raspy tone that falters under
the pressure of a concert, but her playing was
devoid of such problems.
The Orchestra's accompaniment to the
soloists was flawed in that the first violins
and basses were occassionally out of tune,
and entrances weren't always together
throughout the piece.
Hampton Guests
Bonnie Hampton, cello teacher at
Stanford and a member of Stanford's
trio-in-residence, the Francesco Trio, was
guest soloist with the Orchestra in Haydn's
Concerto for Cello and Orchestra in D Major.
This is an extremely difficult work and
anyone who attempts it is playing with fire.
Hampton is a consistently good
performer, and here her playing was no
exception. She missed a few high notes —
very high — in the first movement.

identifiable to the untrained ear only by her
grimaces. These mistakes were easily
forgettable judging from the rest of her
performance.
Particularly impressive were her lively and
in-tune double stops in the third movement.
Her performance elicited the most audience
applause.
Pleasure Shows
Part of the joy in watching her perform
comes from the pleasure she obviously
receives from the music. Her face takes on a
glowing, peaceful serenity when performing,
and her movements are solely concentrated
on producing a good product.
The Orchestra faltered when
accompanying Hampton. They were
sometimes too loud, making it difficult to
hear the soloist. The violas were consistently
out of tune. Entrances were not together,
and the group missed a few of the rhythmical
liberties to which any soloist is entitled.
Bizet's Symphony in D Major was last on
the program, and in some ways the most
difficult. The Orchestra played spiritedly but
missed some of the fast runs and tricky
entrances.
Oboist Edward Lipinsky, though, played
the difficult solos flawlessly. His intonation
was perfect, and the melody flowed
smoothly and effortlessly — quite a feat on
the aboe. The second oboe played well but
a few notes were out of tune.

Susan Freier, concertmistress of both the
Chamber Orchestra and the Stanford
Symphony, performed her extensive solos
beautifully.
She gets good tone and projection from
her instrument, a feat that is difficult even
for the pros when performing against a large
group. Her intonation and bow control was
excellent except for a few minor passages in
the Finale.
Peter Shelton, cellist, also handled his
solos quite well. Although he has a beautiful
instrument, his talent and sensitivity are just
as responsible for his reverberating, mellow
tone. His fault lies in the fact that
exaggerated movement and intense facial
expressions sometimes substitute for solid,
unaffected playing.
Bassoon Duo
Bassoonist James Duncan and Bassist
Shinji Eshima performed their difficult duets

perfectly. Each instrument is difficult enough
to play in tune, let alone together, but the
two accomplished it without error.
Eshima is particularly good as the stringed
bass is difficult to control, but he played it
effortlessly, giving careful attention to
intonation and expression throughout the
solo.
Marie Bird, flutist, did not have as
extensive a solo as the strings but her light,
delicate, and clean sound quality was a
pleasure. Amateur flutists are often plagued
with a strained, raspy tone that falters under
the pressure of a concert, but her playing was
devoid of such problems.
The Orchestra's accompaniment to the
soloists was flawed in that the first violins
and basses were occassionally out of tune,
and entrances weren't always together
throughout the piece.
Hampton Guests
Bonnie Hampton, cello teacher at
Stanford and a member of Stanford's
trio-in-residence, the Francesco Trio, was
guest soloist with the Orchestra in Haydn's
Concerto for Cello and Orchestra in D Major.
This is an extremely difficult work and
anyone who attempts it is playing with fire.
Hampton is a consistently good
performer, and here her playing was no
exception. She missed a few high notes —
very high — in the first movement.

identifiable to the untrained ear only by her
grimaces. These mistakes were easily
forgettable judging from the rest of her
performance.
Particularly impressive were her lively and
in-tune double stops in the third movement.
Her performance elicited the most audience
applause.
Pleasure Shows
Part of the joy in watching her perform
comes from the pleasure she obviously
receives from the music. Her face takes on a
glowing, peaceful serenity when performing,
and her movements are solely concentrated
on producing a good product.
The Orchestra faltered when
accompanying Hampton. They were
sometimes too loud, making it difficult to
hear the soloist. The violas were consistently
out of tune. Entrances were not together,
and the group missed a few of the rhythmical
liberties to which any soloist is entitled.
Bizet's Symphony in D Major was last on
the program, and in some ways the most
difficult. The Orchestra played spiritedly but
missed some of the fast runs and tricky
entrances.
Oboist Edward Lipinsky, though, played
the difficult solos flawlessly. His intonation
was perfect, and the melody flowed
smoothly and effortlessly — quite a feat on
the aboe. The second oboe played well but
a few notes were out of tune.
Stanford is blessed with an exceptional
array of talented musicians, both students
and faculty. The music performed by the
Stanford Chamber Orchestra last Thursday
night offered a challenging test of technique
and musicianship that the group was
generally well prepared for.
The performance of Haydn's Symphony
No. 6 in D Major, Le Matin, illustrated the
