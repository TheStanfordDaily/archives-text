# Once Around The Turntable
## New Winners From Zeppelin And Lennon

Led Zepplin *¥■¥■¥■
Physical Graffiti
Swan Song SS 2-200
It's been nearly two years. "Is
it in the stores yet; What? Geez, I
thought it was due last month!"
Led Zeppelin fans the world over
have waited and waited for their
idols' first double album.
And now it's finally here, but
is it up to expectations? Everyone,
from prepubescent metal maniacs
to Beatle burn-outs turned heavy,
wants to know ...
Led Zeppelin has always been
the foundation of the hardest of
rock: basic rock drums and bass
pounding out solid beats to back
screaming guitar and vocals. Led
Zeppelin mixed this with
pseudo-blues and some mellower
acoustics for an album that has
stayed on the top 100 list for the
past four years.
Houses of the Holy was
progression, but seemed like a
stop on the way, an incomplete
step. Now, Physical Graffiti both
continues this move of Mouses,
and regresses to the classic Zep
that has made them the "world's
most popular rock and roll band."
The album has strong,
power-chord electric rockers of
the old L.Z. ("The Wanton Song,"
"The Houses of the Holy")
acoustic numbers ("Bron-y-aur,"
"Down by the Seaside") and
everything in between. All show
the move Houses of the Holy
began, more complex music, more
frequent and better use of
synthesizer, and better
production.
The Best Cut
"In the Light" is the best cut
on the album. After an opening of
ethereal synthesizer work
reminiscent of "No Quarter,"
Robert Plant's vocals and then
overdubbed driving guitars are
added for a heavy metal ballad
that only a Zeppelin could
produce.
"In My Time of Dying" also
starts off slow, this time with
incredible Hendrix-like slide guitar
that jumps into a furious jam with
one of the all-too-few times
Jimmy Page really displays his
superlative guitar talent.
"Kashmir" again uses synthesizer
to give a deeper flavor to an

already extraordinary 12 bar
blues rocker.
Page's production, always
among the very best, sets new
highs for the industry on Physical
Graffiti. The recording is very
precise and you know nothing has
been left to chance. The sound on
the disc is exactly the patented
Zeppelin sound that Page
intended to put across. No
misplaced drums, no overdub
slurs, nothing but the Zep.
Sore Spots
Overall the album shines, but
there are several weaknesses. One,
it is a double album, and double
discs tend to have a lot more
space than single LP's. In fact,
roughly twice as much.
On Physical Graffiti there are
four songs over eight minutes,
none of which effectively use all
the time alloted to them. The
group took nearly two years of
work on this but still doesn't have
enough strong material for more
than an album and a half. The rest
comes off as wasted vinyl.
Another weakness is Robert
Plant. He has never been a
technically good singer, and even
the high-pitched precise
dynamism that he displayed on
the first five top records seems to
have faded somewhat. He falters
with control and has trouble
making long slides that used to be
his trademark.
Shirks Off
On a bootleg of a recent
performance, he always went to a
lower octave on*solo breaks. Still
his gravelly voice sails high and
strong enough to make most rock
vocalists hide behind their mikes.
So what is the answer? How
good is it really? Well, every kind
of Zeppelin imaginable is on these
two discs, but there's no
"Stairway to Heaven";
Page sizzles the strings off his
guitar but there's no "Heartbreak
er" solo.
Plant soars and wails but never
climbs to the A above high C as he
did on "You Shook Me."
What there is, is intense, more
heady, and more mature than
anything they've done so far. It is
musically and lyrically a
progression. Physical Graffiti has
interesting compositions for the
careful listener, but enough of

that original dinosaur rock to
keep your body shaking, and
remembering that there is nothing
like a Led Zeppelin.

John Lennon
Rock 7V' Roll
Apple SK 3419
"When I was just a little boy,
my one and only joy was listening
to that good old rock and roll." It
wasn't said by John Lennon, but
by a rather unknown group, Cat
Mother, about five years ago.
The sentiments, however,
perfectly fit Lennon's latest
album, Rock W Roll, with
former introspection and political
raving being abandoned for the
music of his youth.
This is the album that Lennon
has been wanting to make for
years, and he and legendary
producer Phil Spector actually
started it in October 1973.
However, Spector suffered a
serious auto accident and
Lennon's troubles with Yoko and
the U.S. Immigration Service kept
him from completing it until
October of last year.
The results are well worth the
wait, for Lennon has clearly
performed a labor of love with his
favorite artists and songs. Classics
(14 in all) like "Be-Bop-A-Lula,"
"Sweet Little Sixteen," and
"Peggy Sue," are recreated with
lusher instrumentation and many
of the studio recording techniques
not available in the 19505.
Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little
Sixteen " in particular
demonstrates what can be done
with classic rock in the recording
studio. Spector worked out the
arrangement which features a
brash, infectious tempo, with a
sweeping hom chorus that really
makes the old tune jump.
Lennon's singing has never

been happier, and when he
recreates the Gene Vincent or
Buddy Holly phrasing, you can
almost see the smile on his face.
One could quibble with the
songs selected, as well as some of
the arrangements, which seem
overly ambitious, relegating
Lennon's singing to the
background. It would have been
interesting if the backup group
was credited as well.
But these very minor flaws are
more than overcome by the

strength of the material, the
performances and the price. Yes,
price. Lennon fights inflation by
making an old fashioned, $5.98
list priced record. For this the
Nixon/Ford administration wants
to deport him?
Lennon may be deported, but
"rock and roll will never die," as
he says in notes accompanying the
album. With fans like Lennon,
rock and roll just has to stay
forever young.

Veteran Phil Spector produced the record, which sports a $5.98 list price that is somewhat behind the

John Lennon
Rock 7V' Roll
Apple SK 3419
"When I was just a little boy,
my one and only joy was listening
to that good old rock and roll." It
wasn't said by John Lennon, but
by a rather unknown group, Cat
Mother, about five years ago.
The sentiments, however,
perfectly fit Lennon's latest
album, Rock W Roll, with
former introspection and political
raving being abandoned for the
music of his youth.
This is the album that Lennon
has been wanting to make for
years, and he and legendary
producer Phil Spector actually
started it in October 1973.
However, Spector suffered a
serious auto accident and
Lennon's troubles with Yoko and
the U.S. Immigration Service kept
him from completing it until
October of last year.
The results are well worth the
wait, for Lennon has clearly
performed a labor of love with his
favorite artists and songs. Classics
(14 in all) like "Be-Bop-A-Lula,"
"Sweet Little Sixteen," and
"Peggy Sue," are recreated with
lusher instrumentation and many
of the studio recording techniques
not available in the 19505.
Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little
Sixteen " in particular
demonstrates what can be done
with classic rock in the recording
studio. Spector worked out the
arrangement which features a
brash, infectious tempo, with a
sweeping hom chorus that really
makes the old tune jump.
Lennon's singing has never

been happier, and when he
recreates the Gene Vincent or
Buddy Holly phrasing, you can
almost see the smile on his face.
One could quibble with the
songs selected, as well as some of
the arrangements, which seem
overly ambitious, relegating
Lennon's singing to the
background. It would have been
interesting if the backup group
was credited as well.
But these very minor flaws are
more than overcome by the

strength of the material, the
performances and the price. Yes,
price. Lennon fights inflation by
making an old fashioned, $5.98
list priced record. For this the
Nixon/Ford administration wants
to deport him?
Lennon may be deported, but
"rock and roll will never die," as
he says in notes accompanying the
album. With fans like Lennon,
rock and roll just has to stay
forever young.

BLAST INTO THE PAST—John Lennon returns to the good old days of rock-n-roll with his latest album.
Veteran Phil Spector produced the record, which sports a $5.98 list price that is somewhat behind the
times.
Led Zepplin *¥■¥■¥■
Physical Graffiti
Swan Song SS 2-200
It's been nearly two years. "Is
it in the stores yet; What? Geez, I
thought it was due last month!"
Led Zeppelin fans the world over
have waited and waited for their
idols' first double album.
And now it's finally here, but
is it up to expectations? Everyone,
from prepubescent metal maniacs
to Beatle burn-outs turned heavy,
wants to know ...
Led Zeppelin has always been
the foundation of the hardest of
rock: basic rock drums and bass
pounding out solid beats to back
screaming guitar and vocals. Led
Zeppelin mixed this with
pseudo-blues and some mellower
acoustics for an album that has
stayed on the top 100 list for the
past four years.
Houses of the Holy was
progression, but seemed like a
stop on the way, an incomplete
step. Now, Physical Graffiti both
continues this move of Mouses,
and regresses to the classic Zep
that has made them the "world's
most popular rock and roll band."
The album has strong,
power-chord electric rockers of
the old L.Z. ("The Wanton Song,"
"The Houses of the Holy")
acoustic numbers ("Bron-y-aur,"
"Down by the Seaside") and
everything in between. All show
the move Houses of the Holy
began, more complex music, more
frequent and better use of
synthesizer, and better
production.
The Best Cut
"In the Light" is the best cut
on the album. After an opening of
ethereal synthesizer work
reminiscent of "No Quarter,"
Robert Plant's vocals and then
overdubbed driving guitars are
added for a heavy metal ballad
that only a Zeppelin could
produce.
"In My Time of Dying" also
starts off slow, this time with
incredible Hendrix-like slide guitar
that jumps into a furious jam with
one of the all-too-few times
Jimmy Page really displays his
superlative guitar talent.
"Kashmir" again uses synthesizer
to give a deeper flavor to an

already extraordinary 12 bar
blues rocker.
Page's production, always
among the very best, sets new
highs for the industry on Physical
Graffiti. The recording is very
precise and you know nothing has
been left to chance. The sound on
the disc is exactly the patented
Zeppelin sound that Page
intended to put across. No
misplaced drums, no overdub
slurs, nothing but the Zep.
Sore Spots
Overall the album shines, but
there are several weaknesses. One,
it is a double album, and double
discs tend to have a lot more
space than single LP's. In fact,
roughly twice as much.
On Physical Graffiti there are
four songs over eight minutes,
none of which effectively use all
the time alloted to them. The
group took nearly two years of
work on this but still doesn't have
enough strong material for more
than an album and a half. The rest
comes off as wasted vinyl.
Another weakness is Robert
Plant. He has never been a
technically good singer, and even
the high-pitched precise
dynamism that he displayed on
the first five top records seems to
have faded somewhat. He falters
with control and has trouble
making long slides that used to be
his trademark.
Shirks Off
On a bootleg of a recent
performance, he always went to a
lower octave on*solo breaks. Still
his gravelly voice sails high and
strong enough to make most rock
vocalists hide behind their mikes.
So what is the answer? How
good is it really? Well, every kind
of Zeppelin imaginable is on these
two discs, but there's no
"Stairway to Heaven";
Page sizzles the strings off his
guitar but there's no "Heartbreak
er" solo.
Plant soars and wails but never
climbs to the A above high C as he
did on "You Shook Me."
What there is, is intense, more
heady, and more mature than
anything they've done so far. It is

stop on the way, an incomplete
step. Now, Physical Graffiti both
continues this move of Mouses,
and regresses to the classic Zep
that has made them the "world's
most popular rock and roll band."
The album has strong,
power-chord electric rockers of
the old L.Z. ("The Wanton Song,"
"The Houses of the Holy")
acoustic numbers ("Bron-y-aur,"
"Down by the Seaside") and
everything in between. All show
the move Houses of the Holy
began, more complex music, more
frequent and better use of
synthesizer, and better
production.
The Best Cut
"In the Light" is the best cut
on the album. After an opening of
ethereal synthesizer work
reminiscent of "No Quarter,"
Robert Plant's vocals and then
overdubbed driving guitars are
added for a heavy metal ballad
that only a Zeppelin could
produce.
"In My Time of Dying" also
starts off slow, this time with
incredible Hendrix-like slide guitar
that jumps into a furious jam with
one of the all-too-few times
Jimmy Page really displays his
superlative guitar talent.
"Kashmir" again uses synthesizer
to give a deeper flavor to an

already extraordinary 12 bar
blues rocker.
Page's production, always
among the very best, sets new
highs for the industry on Physical
Graffiti. The recording is very
precise and you know nothing has
been left to chance. The sound on
the disc is exactly the patented
Zeppelin sound that Page
intended to put across. No
misplaced drums, no overdub
slurs, nothing but the Zep.
Sore Spots
Overall the album shines, but
there are several weaknesses. One,
it is a double album, and double
discs tend to have a lot more
space than single LP's. In fact,
roughly twice as much.
On Physical Graffiti there are
four songs over eight minutes,
none of which effectively use all
the time alloted to them. The
group took nearly two years of
work on this but still doesn't have
enough strong material for more
than an album and a half. The rest
comes off as wasted vinyl.
Another weakness is Robert
Plant. He has never been a
technically good singer, and even
the high-pitched precise
dynamism that he displayed on
the first five top records seems to
have faded somewhat. He falters
with control and has trouble
making long slides that used to be
his trademark.
Shirks Off
On a bootleg of a recent
performance, he always went to a
lower octave on*solo breaks. Still
his gravelly voice sails high and
strong enough to make most rock
vocalists hide behind their mikes.
So what is the answer? How
good is it really? Well, every kind
of Zeppelin imaginable is on these
two discs, but there's no
"Stairway to Heaven";
Page sizzles the strings off his
guitar but there's no "Heartbreak
er" solo.
Plant soars and wails but never
climbs to the A above high C as he
did on "You Shook Me."
What there is, is intense, more
heady, and more mature than
anything they've done so far. It is
musically and lyrically a
progression. Physical Graffiti has
interesting compositions for the
careful listener, but enough of

that original dinosaur rock to
keep your body shaking, and
remembering that there is nothing
like a Led Zeppelin.

John Lennon
Rock 7V' Roll
Apple SK 3419
"When I was just a little boy,
my one and only joy was listening
to that good old rock and roll." It
wasn't said by John Lennon, but
by a rather unknown group, Cat
Mother, about five years ago.
The sentiments, however,
perfectly fit Lennon's latest
album, Rock W Roll, with
former introspection and political
raving being abandoned for the
music of his youth.
This is the album that Lennon
has been wanting to make for
years, and he and legendary
producer Phil Spector actually
started it in October 1973.
However, Spector suffered a
serious auto accident and
Lennon's troubles with Yoko and
the U.S. Immigration Service kept
him from completing it until
October of last year.
The results are well worth the
wait, for Lennon has clearly
performed a labor of love with his
favorite artists and songs. Classics
(14 in all) like "Be-Bop-A-Lula,"
"Sweet Little Sixteen," and
"Peggy Sue," are recreated with
lusher instrumentation and many
of the studio recording techniques
not available in the 19505.
Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little
Sixteen " in particular
demonstrates what can be done
with classic rock in the recording
studio. Spector worked out the
arrangement which features a
brash, infectious tempo, with a
sweeping hom chorus that really
makes the old tune jump.
Lennon's singing has never

been happier, and when he
recreates the Gene Vincent or
Buddy Holly phrasing, you can
almost see the smile on his face.
One could quibble with the
songs selected, as well as some of
the arrangements, which seem
overly ambitious, relegating
Lennon's singing to the
background. It would have been
interesting if the backup group
was credited as well.
But these very minor flaws are
more than overcome by the

strength of the material, the
performances and the price. Yes,
price. Lennon fights inflation by
making an old fashioned, $5.98
list priced record. For this the
Nixon/Ford administration wants
to deport him?
Lennon may be deported, but
"rock and roll will never die," as
he says in notes accompanying the
album. With fans like Lennon,
rock and roll just has to stay
forever young.

Physical Graffiti
Swan Song SS 2-200
It's been nearly two years. "Is
it in the stores yet; What? Geez, I
thought it was due last month!"
Led Zeppelin fans the world over
have waited and waited for their
idols' first double album.
And now it's finally here, but
is it up to expectations? Everyone,
from prepubescent metal maniacs
to Beatle burn-outs turned heavy,
wants to know ...
Led Zeppelin has always been
the foundation of the hardest of
rock: basic rock drums and bass
pounding out solid beats to back
screaming guitar and vocals. Led
Zeppelin mixed this with
pseudo-blues and some mellower
acoustics for an album that has
stayed on the top 100 list for the
past four years.

has been wanting to make for
years, and he and legendary
producer Phil Spector actually
started it in October 1973.
However, Spector suffered a
serious auto accident and
Lennon's troubles with Yoko and
the U.S. Immigration Service kept
him from completing it until
October of last year.
The results are well worth the
wait, for Lennon has clearly
performed a labor of love with his
favorite artists and songs. Classics
(14 in all) like "Be-Bop-A-Lula,"
"Sweet Little Sixteen," and
"Peggy Sue," are recreated with
lusher instrumentation and many
of the studio recording techniques
not available in the 19505.
Chuck Berry's "Sweet Little
Sixteen " in particular
demonstrates what can be done
with classic rock in the recording
studio. Spector worked out the
arrangement which features a
brash, infectious tempo, with a
sweeping hom chorus that really
makes the old tune jump.
Lennon's singing has never

been happier, and when he
recreates the Gene Vincent or
Buddy Holly phrasing, you can
almost see the smile on his face.
One could quibble with the
songs selected, as well as some of
the arrangements, which seem
overly ambitious, relegating
Lennon's singing to the
background. It would have been
interesting if the backup group
was credited as well.
But these very minor flaws are
more than overcome by the

strength of the material, the
performances and the price. Yes,
price. Lennon fights inflation by
making an old fashioned, $5.98
list priced record. For this the
Nixon/Ford administration wants
to deport him?
Lennon may be deported, but
"rock and roll will never die," as
he says in notes accompanying the
album. With fans like Lennon,
rock and roll just has to stay
forever young.
