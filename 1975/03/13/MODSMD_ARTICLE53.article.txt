# 'Father's Day': Waste Of Time
## 
### DAVID W. MOYER 
In the end — and it must
always come down to this, no
rnatter what other failings a
theatre may have — in the end a
public will get what it deserves
and no better.
—Edward Albee, "Which Theatre is
The Absurd One?"
Judging from the production
of Oliver Hailey's Father's Day,
currently at the Marines'
Memorial Theatre, the American
public does not deserve much.
Father's Day is typically and
pathetically Broadway, at least
until its confused ending. It is an
attempt in the Neil Simon genre
of sometime social commentary
hidden beneath an abundance of
snappy one-liners. Unfortunately,
Hailey is not nearly as incisive in
the social commentary
department nor as witty in his
one-liners as the redoubtable
Simon.
Hailey deals with marriage and
divorce but he could not decide
what kind of play he wanted to
write. In the first act he opts for

utter banality, a sit-eom with
three divorcees trading
punch-lines on the balcony of
their Manhattan apartment. It is,
in short, a surrogate for television.
But you do get something
extra for your $7.50 which T.V.
cannot provide: a surfeit of
expletives. Whenever Hailey is in
need of a punch line and nothing
particularly hilarious comes to
mind he simply has one character
cuss out another.
Some Laughter
That the audience sometimes
found this woeful inarticulateness
worthy of laughter rather than
tears is a telling comment on the
state of our theatre.
In the last act the playwright
decides that fun is fun but, after
all, every play should make a
statement, preferably in a
dramatic scene. He therefore
makes insightful comments on
marriage and divorce in some
poignant and quite powerful
scenes.
Unfortunately, these scenes are
too infrequent and, what is worse,

they seem misplaced after an hour
and a half of drivel. A mixture of
comedy and tragedy is fine, but
there must be some integration. It
seemed as though Hailey merely
changed the channel.
Mirroring Cast
The cast mirrors the strengths
and weaknesses of the script.
When it is frivolous sit-com they
sink ignominiously to the level
required of them, complete with
plastic personalities and
mechanical smiles.
When the serious dramatic
scenes of the last act come, they
respond with considerable art, but
since these scenes are not
adequately prepared for earlier in
the play, one is not convinced by
the cast's sudden incarnation.
There is one notable exception
to all this mediocrity: Carole
Cook is masterful throughout. She
rises above her uninspired
surroundings to put a real human
being on the stage who is all the
more funny for being real. Her
last scene is one of consumate
subtlety: she reveals the sensitive
being which seeks protection
under a guise of blustering
bitchiness and crudity.
By way of addenda, it must
be asked why ACT insists upon
wasting the Marines' Theatre with
such innocuous fare. ABT is
now a theatrical giant. Clive
Barnes calls it the best company
in America.
Championship Season
One is always assured of a
strong season over-all, if not with
each individual play. But it seems
the front office is becoming
Complacent and San Francisco
theatre is suffering accordingly. It
is a sad sign that the Marines'
stage, former site of such
productions as Albee's Tiny Alice,
now bears Father's Day.
In the end — and it must
always come down to this, no
rnatter what other failings a

and no better.

attempt in the Neil Simon genre
of sometime social commentary
hidden beneath an abundance of
snappy one-liners. Unfortunately,
Hailey is not nearly as incisive in
the social commentary
department nor as witty in his
one-liners as the redoubtable
Simon.
Hailey deals with marriage and
divorce but he could not decide
what kind of play he wanted to
write. In the first act he opts for

utter banality, a sit-eom with
three divorcees trading
punch-lines on the balcony of
their Manhattan apartment. It is,
in short, a surrogate for television.
But you do get something
extra for your $7.50 which T.V.
cannot provide: a surfeit of
expletives. Whenever Hailey is in
need of a punch line and nothing
particularly hilarious comes to
mind he simply has one character
cuss out another.
Some Laughter
That the audience sometimes
found this woeful inarticulateness
worthy of laughter rather than
tears is a telling comment on the
state of our theatre.
In the last act the playwright
decides that fun is fun but, after
all, every play should make a
statement, preferably in a
dramatic scene. He therefore
makes insightful comments on
marriage and divorce in some
poignant and quite powerful
scenes.
Unfortunately, these scenes are
too infrequent and, what is worse,

they seem misplaced after an hour
and a half of drivel. A mixture of
comedy and tragedy is fine, but
there must be some integration. It
seemed as though Hailey merely
changed the channel.
Mirroring Cast
The cast mirrors the strengths
and weaknesses of the script.
When it is frivolous sit-com they
sink ignominiously to the level
required of them, complete with
plastic personalities and
mechanical smiles.
When the serious dramatic
scenes of the last act come, they
respond with considerable art, but
since these scenes are not
adequately prepared for earlier in
the play, one is not convinced by
the cast's sudden incarnation.
There is one notable exception
to all this mediocrity: Carole
Cook is masterful throughout. She
rises above her uninspired
surroundings to put a real human
being on the stage who is all the
more funny for being real. Her
last scene is one of consumate
subtlety: she reveals the sensitive
being which seeks protection
under a guise of blustering
bitchiness and crudity.
By way of addenda, it must
be asked why ACT insists upon
wasting the Marines' Theatre with
such innocuous fare. ABT is
now a theatrical giant. Clive
Barnes calls it the best company
in America.
Championship Season
One is always assured of a
strong season over-all, if not with
each individual play. But it seems
the front office is becoming
Complacent and San Francisco
theatre is suffering accordingly. It
is a sad sign that the Marines'
stage, former site of such
productions as Albee's Tiny Alice,
now bears Father's Day.
In the end — and it must
always come down to this, no
rnatter what other failings a
theatre may have — in the end a
public will get what it deserves
and no better.
—Edward Albee, "Which Theatre is
The Absurd One?"
Judging from the production
of Oliver Hailey's Father's Day,
currently at the Marines'
Memorial Theatre, the American
public does not deserve much.
Father's Day is typically and
pathetically Broadway, at least
until its confused ending. It is an
attempt in the Neil Simon genre

snappy one-liners. Unfortunately,
