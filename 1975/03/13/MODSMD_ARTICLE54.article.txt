# Rod Stewart Pleases Cow Palace Crowd
## 
### D.PAUL YEUELL 
DALY ClTY—Leading into the
Cow Palace was a long cattle-run
built with traffic barracades.
Ripple bottles, Jack-in-the-Box
wrappers and Coors cans were the
droppings of the Rod Stewart fans

that had stood in line in the
cattle-run through the previous
night.
A tape-loop ran continuously
over the Cow Palace public
address system, "... the Berkeley
Community Free Clinic is on hand
tonight in the Cow Palace with
doctors, nurses, and volunteers to
provide complete medical
assistance ..."
At the turnstyles, the veteran
Bill Graham security officers —
those heavy-set old black
sergeants with hands like ham
hocks — patted down everybody.
Hips. Underarms. Lower back.
The whole Broderick Crawford
routine.
Cattle-runs and the Cow
Palace. Social lubrication supplied
by 7-11. Doctors and nurses on
hand with thorazine and soothing
dialogue for freaked out
music-lovers. Frisking for bottles.
Or guns. Rod Stewart and the
Faces. Everything was there last
Friday night for a rasty rock-'n'-roll
riot.
Long Schlock
After a much-too-long set of
schlock by an "also-ran" band
named Foghat and an equally long
intermission during which a
rookie security guard abducted a
woman rolling a cigarette in the
lobby and dragged her off as the
first drug bust of his career, the
stage was prepared for the Faces.
When the all-white stage was
ready (white floor, white piano,
white amps, etc.), the lights came
up and the "Stripper" theme

blared out over the public address.
Rod Stewart and the Faces came
on stage.
The Faces' shows are rasty and
rowdy. Unless you like songs
about drinking whiskey, trying to
hustle butt and getting thrown
out of parties, you probably
ought to stay at home.
Slow Evolution
Their act has evolved
somewhat since their last San
Francisco concert. Instead of tight
back-to-back versions of their
album songs, they play longer,
looser versions with long
improvisations. This change in
concert style reflects Stewart's
desire to make theirs a band act
rather than a sin
ger-and-back-up-band act.
Besides Stewart, who is
certainly one of the few really big
time rock-'n'-roll entertainers, the
Faces have one of the finest rock
guitarists in the business, Ron
Wood, and an equally remarkable
drummer, Kenny Jones.
Their stage show owes its style
to vaudeville, burlesque,
Broadway musicals, Motown, the
cabaret and Coney Island.
Compared to the linear rock and
non-existent stage presence of
Foghat, the Faces are
tremendously entertaining.
New Touches
One of the new touches that
Stewart arranged for this tour was
an orchestra for an R&B medley.
It was a risky venture and the
band was noticeably nervous.
But when the orchestra and the
piano, played by lan Maelaglan,
echoed verses of the old song

"Darling You Send Me," it was
clearly a sweet success.
One of the dangers of this
not-too-old institution of
rock-'n'-roll superstars is the
addictive nature of crowd response.
Crowd junkies must be inevitably
weaned on the immeasurable
rushes coming from a huge crowd
at a rock concert.
Harder They Come
And like the narcotic
counterpart when you fall, you
fall a long way. Hence, stop-over
bands like Foghat that are formed
to soften the fall for fading
performers (Foghat contains two
from Savoy Brown).
But Rod Stewart has always
been careful if not calculated
about his habit. Performing is
definitely what the Faces are all
about, but they've managed to use
their heads as more than the
receiving bin of untold drugs: for
example, the band's recent
concern with focusing their act on
the band as a whole rather than
on the band as a back-up group
for Stewart.
This band that loves songs
about being sloppy and rowdy is,
finally, a very honest and
unpretentious group. Their fun is
straightforward and honest.
Amidst the wild histrionics, the
raunchy guitar licks, the flashing
lights and the beach balls being
soccer-kicked into the crowd is a
very definite sincerity coming
from one of the oldest and finest
rock bands going.
