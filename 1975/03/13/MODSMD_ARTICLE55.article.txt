# Kinky Friedman, The Texas Jewboy, Rides Again
## 
### ALAN HOFFMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO - He has
been called the Lenny Bruce of
country music, though Kinky
Friedman himself says he merely
wants to be "hailed as a passing
taxi."
In a sense Kinky's act is in the
distinguished tradition of Jewish
humor: two weeks ago at the
Boarding House, he and his
"Texas Jewboys" violated the
willing audience with a spurt of
"ethnic" jokes — jokes which
eventually made butts of every
identifiable American racial,
ethnic, and minority group,
including his own (example:
"When the Jews run the world,
they'll reduce the speed limit to
$54.95").
But his musical mixture of
rock and country, satire and
insult, "chutzpah" and leering
crudeness, resists conventional
labels. After reexamining his two
albums, Sold American and Kinky
Friedman, I decided to get the
Texas Jewboy's own story in an
interview after the final Thursday
night set.
Stumbling down the stairway
to the Boarding House bar, I
thought of Hesse's Steppenwolf at
the Masked Ball, descending into
Hell. In the dim light of the bar 1
encountered what I took to be a
masquerader out of that novel:
gaunt, pocked face masked by
dark glasses; long, oily hair; brown
snakeskin jacket.
He introduced himself as
Dylan, Kinky's manager. I just
had time to wonder if Dylan
carried a shiv when Kinky
entered, still dressed like a Wild
West Uncle Sam. He gestured with
his cigar hand for me to join him
at his table, ordered me a beer,
removed his dark glasses (and with
them much of his
fol k~.y-but-obnoxious stage
manner).
As we talked, the rhythm of
his drawl was occasionally
interrupted by the visit of an
admirer or an urge for a sip ol
what he called his "fag-ola" drink.
Daily: / was going to Brandeis

University in Boston last year.
What happened to the gig you
were supposed to do at Harvard?
K.F.: Well, that gig went out
with Wall Street and the
handshake. When we got to town
the group that was sponsoring it
had folded, so we were stuck in
Boston for three days .. . very
tedious.
Daily: I tried to get Brandeir, to
book you because / knew you
would be a smash there. Smashed
over the head with a bagel,
orobably.

K.F.: Brandeis would be an
excellent show. You know I'm
currently in love with a JAP
[Jewish American Princess],
Never thought I would be.
Daily: Have you ever been
threatened by the JDL [Jewish
Defense League/ ?
K.F.: The only unpleasant
thing we had was when we played
Max's Kansas City in New York
two years ago. The first night, the
JDL painted a yellow star on the
building and called and said, if the
show goes on. the building's

gonna be blown up and
everybody's gonna die. So the
blue pigs came and frisked
everybody in line and it came off
okay.
But on this last tour there were
a lot of fashionably dressed guys
with "vamahas" on their heads
running around. They'd like a
whole ethnic set — they could
listen to that Jewish shit all night.
The JDL's on our side now; they
see "Tliey Ain't Makin' Jews Like
Jesus Anymore" as a Jewish power
song.
To tell you the truth, though I
don't deal in the casino of
politics, I think they're less crazy
than a lot of other people who
come to our shows with their
fuckin' dates, little, blonde-haired
nerds comin' to see a fuckin'
vicarious something-a-little-bit
crazier-than-they-are. But as far as
I'm concerned, if you ain't crazy
there's something wrong with
you: you oughta be crazy.
Daily: Why the change of
record labels (from Vanguard to
ABC/Dunhill)?
K.F.: We've made a very subtle
change in the act, moving from
satire to comedy. We didn't enjoy
being an avant-garde underground
cult group beating our heads

against the wall for people like
Rolling Stone to dig. Our first
album was the instant collectors'
item; there were never enough
copies for anybody to buy in the
first place.
It's just who's strong who
survives the motherfucker — in
other words, the groups that O.D.
on St. Joseph's Baby Aspirin don't
make it. . . the ones that stick it
out for a long time do. But
ABC/Dunhill, for a company
that's Jim Croce-Three Dog Night
oriented, has really gone out on a
weird limb for us.
There's a more cross-bred
American audience comin' to see
us. In the past people have been
confused, put-off, pissed-off. Now
''someone" has told them you're
really gonna love these guys. To
compete with the Archies is very
hard — you've gotta take a crack
at the Big Dream.
We have a big string of concert
dates with the Guess Who coming
up. The audience will be about a
10-year-old mentality, but this is
what we need to do.
Daily: Why arc you booked
with someone like Buffy Stc.
Marie?
K.F.: That shit is put together
by clubs we've never played at

before. What we've done is make
it very hot for anybody we've
played with on this tour. We want
a folksinger to open for us. At the
Troubador in L.A., if they send
some chick out there who sings
folksongs, we'll kill 'em. We'll be
like the fuckin' Rolling Stones.
Daily: How do you move in
the WASP circles? I)o they see
through your shit-kicker image?
K.F.: If we play with Willie
Nelson or Waylon Jennings,
country audiences dig what we
do. And that's pretty amazing.
Remember Skeeter Davis? She
said something about the "Jesus
trippers" on the Grand Ole Opry
and they threw her right off the
show, after she'd been on for 20
years.
If Tex Ritter had said goddamn
on stage his career would have
been through. But, Alan, we know
we don't have any real country
fans. There's a weird place for us,
like Johnny Rodriquez the
resident spic, and Charley Pride
the coon and me the house
Jewboy.

Daily: So where is all of this
heading?
K.F.: I think the time is right
for a multi-media act. We're gonna
have a TV show which will be a
cross between Porter Waggoner
and Dick Cavett, where you might
interview Ernest Tubb and
Truman Capote on the same
show.
Or else a situation comedy
series called "The Texas
Jewboys." I'm also writing a book
called Ride 'em, Jew boy. It's
about breaking into the music
business — sort of your allegory of
your wandering Jew.
Daily: Sounds like you're
becoming a regular Renaissance
cowboy.
K.F.: There you be. This thing
got started in such a weird way —
it was like a joke starting out.
More reality has accrued to the
act as it's gone along. It's hard to
tell where it's gonna go, but I'd
say we're gonna be there in two
years at the most.
My life now is a mosaic — a
pretty fractured one.
