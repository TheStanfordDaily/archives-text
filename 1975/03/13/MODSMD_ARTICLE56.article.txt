# Movies: Beatty, Burstyn Spark 'Shampoo,' 'Alice'
## 
### 
In a shocking, jolting way,
Shampoo achieves what it sets out
to do. Warren Beatty's new film
(he co-wrote, produced, and
starred in it) is an all-too-perfect
picture of what we have become.
It is disconcerting to realize how
much we have changed — or
perhaps a better word is
deteriorated — in the last seven
years.
Shampoo is one day in the life
of an atypical Beverly Hills
hairdresser, circa Election Day,
1968, when we dove head first
into the mess from which we are
just extricating ourselves. It shows
our decadence, our waste, and our
corruption, as it was before we all
discovered it was there.
George (Beatty) wants his own
salon, but, turned down by his
bank, he is forced to go to Lester
(Jack Warden), the husband of a
customer, Felicia (Lee Grant).
Concentrate — this gets
complicated. George is not only
having an affair with Felicia, but
also Jackie (Julie Christie), who is
(1) the best friend of Jill (Goldie
Hawn), who thinks she's George's
girlfriend, and (2) having an affair
with Lester. If you understand all
that, congratulations.
Fart of what the film does is
call attention to how drastically

women's roles have changed over
the years since 1968, showing
how quickly things move. The
contrast between what Nixon and
Agnew promised to do and
actually did comes across very
well during the scene in the
Bistro, a popular Los Angeles
nightclub. Unfortunately, I was
more interested in the election
returns than the actors.
George very obviously is not a
homosexual, exploding that myth
about hairdressers — he became
one only to be near women, and
he uses his proximity admirably.
All through the days we see him —
Election Day, the day before and
the day after — he is either in bed,
leaving a bed, or on the way to a
bed.
In this way, as it shows the
degradation of morals in our
society, Shampoo lacks any
attraction. It is plotless and
uninteresting. While the film
shows perfectly its Beverly Hills
apathetic types (during all of
Election Day, no one even
mentions voting), they are far
from the kind of people you
would like to spend two hours of
your time with.
Incessant Sex
Because of its incessant sex —
driving home the point as

forcefully as Warren Beatty makes
love — Shampoo often seems like
a pornographic movie. The
characters are only there to string
the sex scenes together. Like any
true porno flick, it doesn't let the
plot get in the way of the sex.
What I can't understand is how
such talented people got mixed up
in it. It is Beatty's first production
since Bonnie and Clyde, and his
acting is superior to what he's
been in recently ($, McCabe and
Mrs. Miller).
His one-time girlfriend, Julie
Christie (also a McCabe co-star),

Goldie Hawn (another ex of his),
Lee Grant and Jack Warden
especially all do well, considering
what they have to work with.
Beatty wrote the screenplay
with Robert Towne (Chinatown,
The Last Detail), and it was
directed by Hal Ash by (The Last
Detail, Harold and Maude).
It's not my idea of
entertainment. Charles Champlin
said in effect that in a hundred
years people will look at Shampoo
to see what we were like.
Unfortunately, that's true. But for
the next 99 years, it'll be

all washed up.

Every so often there comes a
movie that is so beautifully done,
so perfect in its performances and
its direction, that it makes you
wonder how you've tolerated all
the substandard garbage
Hollywood heaps upon us without
giving up the movies forever.
It is so good that you're
pleased you went to see it, that
you realize there is nothing wrong
with it; so unique that it is
difficult to compare it with
anything.
Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore is that kind of a movie.
Thanks to a great screenplay by
Robert Getchell, it has every

element of human life in it — joy,
sorrow, laughter, tears, its ups and
downs, its friends and enemies. It
is a rare motion picture, in a class
by itself, unable to be thrown
upon a pile of similar, if inferior,
predecessors.
Perhaps it is most closely
related to Harry and Tonto —
their traveling plots are similar —
but mostly, it's just related to
itself, which, in these unoriginal
days, may be the highest
compliment of all.
Family Glimpse
We have a quick glimpse of the
Hyatt family's life before it is
thrown into upheaval by the
husband's death. Donald is a truck
driver for Coca-Cola who treats
his wife Alice more like a maid
than a wife, making her frustrated
and unhappy, and 10-year-old
Tommy is a precocious practical
joker who enjoys Mott The
Hoople blaring in his ears.
We are not too upset when
Donald kicks off, because we
know it will enable Alice to fulfill
her ambition for a singing career,
discarded with her marriage.
The title refers to Alice's
departure from Socorro, New
Mexico — destination Monterey,
her home town. Along the way,
she supports herself and Tommy
singing and waitressing, trying to
survive, an admirable pursuit,
considering the acquaintances she
makes. That, in a nutshell, is the
plot.
But Alice 1 s strength is not in its
plot, but in its performances, all of
which are exquisitely cut jewels.
Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist, The
Last Picture Show), deservedly
Oscar-nominated for her Alice,
could carry the movie by herself
even without the help she gets
from the other actors.
Buffeted about by

circumstances over which she has
no control, Alice discovers things
about herself — "I don't know
how to live without a man," she
says — showing that women's
liberation only comes after a
struggle in an inflexible world.
But Alice has an optimistic
view of the world that makes her
capable of success in a world of
pain and insecurity. And she has
her sense of humor, which she
exhibits in her relationship with
her son (played by Alfred Lutter
with a vitality and maturity
beyond his age, something like
Addie Pray in Paper Moon).
He buoys her; without him, she
would have no one to sharpen her
sense of humor.
He asks Alice, "How much
money do we have?" She answers,
"Well, before the funeral, we had
about $2000.
"And now?" he persists. Alice
replies, "About $1.59."
The two of them in turn
support and depend upon each
other, protected against the world
by their love. It is enjoyable to
watch, for once, a family together
against the world rather than
coming apart at the seams.
In the tradition of Cinderella
Liberty, we finally have a happy
ending, a joy in itself, made all the
more enjoyable by the intervening
portrayals, all human and
believable, of Harvey Keitel, as a
lover of Alice's, Diane Ladd, as a
co-worker with whom Alice shares
an unbreakable bond of
friendship, and Kris Kristofferson,
a rancher who frequents the cafe
where Alice works.
They are perfect, as is the
direction of Martin Scorsese
(Mean Streets). Do yourself a
favor — see Alice.

HE KNOWS FOR SURE — Goldie Hawn shares Warren Beatty's bed in a shot from Beatty's newest film
production, "Shampoo." The film chronicles a day in the life of an atypical Hollywood hairdresser and his
clients, among them Hawn and Julie Christie.
