# Best Bets
## 
### 
Yes, this is dead week and next
week there arc finals and then you
can recuperate. However, as is
traditionally the case, if you wish
to take a breather in the midst of
all the tension, there are several
valuable activities to partake of,
both on and off campus. And, just
to keep your sanity, we recommend
that you sample at least one.
This week's very best bet is
comedian George Carlin, who
appears Saturday night at the
Foothill College Gym. Carlin, best
known for his hip disc jockey Willie
West ("Wonderful WINO") and the
"hippy dippy weatherman" Al
Sleet ("Tonight's weather-dark,
with patches of light in the
morning") puts on an unforgettable
show.
For an equally unforgettable
show that adds the high culture
Carlin omits, try Claude Kipnis and
his Mime Theater, appearing
tonight and Friday, sponsored by
the Public Events Office. The group
will perform different programs
each night.
According to a press release, the
"emphasis will be on character
sketches, filled with humor but
often bittersweet and reflecting the
dreams of little people." Kipnis, a
protege of Marcel Marceau,
recently performed at the White
House.
If you prefer further dramatics,
try not to miss Side Show,
appearing through Sunday at the CHI

Coffee House and sponsored by the
Palo Alto Community Theater. It
consists of "unusual" one act
comedies and is produced by Kelley
DePonte, a Stanford student.
Since we've been accused of
leaving out certain musical
productions in the past, let us now
redeem ourselves.
Thru March 30, the Heavy Water
Light Show will appear at De Anza
College's Minolta Planetarium. This
show features slides, moving images
and films synchronized to taped
music. The people in the group
have also taken cover photos for
Santana and jefferson Starship
Albums.
For less visual yet very listenable
music try jesse Colin Young and
Leo Kottke at Berkeley on Friday
night and Quincy Jones and Eddie
Kendricks at the Circle Star Theater
on Saturday (in case you're
wondering who Kendricks is, he
recorded that awful "Keep on
Truck in' " song last year. In spite
of that, try not to miss Quincy
jones — he's outstanding).
If music in a classier atmosphere
is for you, then don't give up hope.
Teresa Brewer (you've heard of
her — she recently recorded a
ragtime album with George Segal)
opens at the Fairmont's Venetian
Room on Tuesday And she should
be worth hearing, especially if Segal
promises not to join her on stage.
Now that we've covered the
ritzier tastes (yes, Saltinesare fine,

too), let us mention the cheapest
bastions of entertainment —
movies. Stardust, starring David
Essex, is still at the Aquarius
Theater. It traces the development
and disintegration of a rock group
in the '60s and Essex even looks
like Paul McCartney (get the
hint?). The group originates in
Liverpool.
Young Frankenstein and Murder
on the Orient Express and The
Stepford Wives are also still in the
Palo Alto area. The Stanford Film
Society presents Hitchcock's The
Birds on Friday. And this week's
ASSU Flick is Patton, starring
George C. Scott (Brad Williams, are
you listening?).
If you must watch a film at
home, try Attack of the Robots,
this Saturday's Creature Feature. It
is the story of how the Arena
recently played a practical joke on
the Daily (just call me Nobbins).
Finally, since we will not be
back until April, let us urge you to
attend the SF SNACK Concert on
March 23, if you bought pickets
(it's sold out). It will feature the
Doobie Brothers, Joan Baez, Tower
of Power and other celebrities. And
the proceeds will be used to
maintain extra-curricular activities
in the San Francisco schools
(Remember how we all got in here,
gang?).
Have a restful vacation.
