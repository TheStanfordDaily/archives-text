Gillespie was born in 1917 and educated at Laurinburg

modern jazz to large audiences.

"Dizzy is a master trumpet player, a player who can handle
any kind of composition in a uniquely personal way. He is in
superior mental, physical and musical shape, and the result is
that once again we have with us a performer whose every solo on
any night is something worth hearing, an artistic gift of
immeasurable value," comments Ralph J. Gleason in the San
Francisco Chronicle.
Tickets for the Mem Aud concert are $6, $5 and $4, and $2.75
