# End Of Dallmar, Kelley Eras
## Bears Grizzle Cards 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
A team of the future beat a
team of the past Friday night at
Maples Pavilion.
California's explosive juniors
defeated Stanford's charitable
Cardinals, 68-63, in a game that
marked an end to the frustration
for five Stanford seniors and
coach Howie Dallmar.
A record Maples Pavilion
crowd of 8021 roared its approval
as the Cards won the opening tip
and raced to an 11-0 lead. But the
cheers quickly turned to more
familiar groans when a rash of
turnovers helped the Bears close
the gap.
While the Cards stumbled,
fumbled, traveled and threw the
ball away, the Bears calmly
regrouped. Cal eventually pulled
ahead with 3:11 remaining in the
first half and never relinquished
its lead.
"It was just a question of don't
panic and stay with our game,"
said Cal coach Dick Edwards. "We
weren't really worried."
Forward John Terry agreed.
"We knew we had to regroup,
that's all. We knew we'd come
back."
Sticky Zone
The Bears frustrated the Cards
with a sticky 3-2 zone, the same
defense Cal used to defeat
Stanford 60-46 at Harmon Gym
last month — the same defense
that held UCLA to 51 points last
weekend in a four-point squeaker
at Pauley Pavilion.
Stanford had trouble getting
the ball inside to Rich Kelley and
Ed Schweitzer. In fact the Cards
had trouble doing anything
against the fast-moving defense.
A reporter asked Edwards
afterward if he had ever seen a
college team play such an
effective zone.
"In all modesty I haven't," he
said. "Our players are very, very
quick. They have great
anticipation and good ball sense.
They just make it work."
It worked well enough to cause
24 Cardinal turnovers. Cal had
only 12 miscues, a statistic which
more than offset Stanford's 46-29
rebounding edge.
Offensively, Rickie
Hawthorne's excessive dribbling
was annoying, but his shooting

and floor leadership was effective.
He scored 25 points and added
four assists, while Carl Bird hit
seven of 10 shots in a 16-point
performance. Jay Young
contributed 14 points and seven
rebounds.
Hawthorne, Bird and Young
are all juniors, as is versatile guard
Connie White. The Bears, who
finished 7-7 in the league and 17-9
overall, will be back.
Kelley Outstanding
Kelley paced the Cardinals
with 26 points and a game-high 11
rebounds, but the fans were
denied the chance to give him a
standing ovation when Dallmar
failed to take him out with five
seconds left and the game already
decided.
Seconds before, some clutch
tips by Kelley and Schweitzer
proved futile. Twice in the last
three minutes Stanford pulled
within a point, but the Bears
calmly dropped in 10 straight free
throws to seal the victory.
It was an appropriate ending to
a promising era that never
materialized.
It all added up to 37 victories
and 39 losses. Pacific Eight
records of 7-7, 5-9 and 6-8.
Overall records of 14-11, 11-14
and 12-14. Twenty-five losses by
seven points or less. Over 1000

turnovers. Endless frustration.
There were many moments to
remember, including the
miraculous back-to-back victories
over UCLA and USC, Kelley's
battles with Bill Walton, the
tenacity and hustle of Melvin
Arterberry and Mark Gilberg, the
Red Vest Band's dominance over
Pac-8 opponents.
But the finale was just another
night to forget.

Cardinal Notes: Edwards didn't
hide his displeasure at Oregon's
invitation to the NIT tournament
in New York. "Certainly I think
it's a bad decision," he said. "I
could understand if they invited
Washington instead of us, since
our records are identical and we
split our season series. But to take
the seventh-place team in the
league is a damn slap in the face at
the rest of us.
"If they're trying to build the
stature of the NIT, that's not the
way to do it."
Since Edwards' statement,
Washington State beat Washington
and Oregon beat Oregon State,
leaving Washington one game
behind Cal in the standings and
Oregon in a fifth-place tie instead
of seventh.
Referees Irv Brown and Jack
Ditty signed in as Frank and Jesse
James.
