# Card JVs Kick Habit, Beat Cal Cagers

So much for the balanced-scor
i n g - is -1 h e - key-to-winn ing-basketball-theory.
Almost.
Usually, when a team's three leading
scorers collect 20, 19, and 15 points, that's
considered a fairly balanced attack. Except
when that team is the Stanford junior varsity
which relies on a total team effort.
The Cards didn't get the total team effort
last Friday night, at Maples Pavilion, but beat
Cal anyway 78-73, finishing the season with a
14-4 record, eight consecutive wins, and 13
of its last 14.
Nobody outside of Dick Dohrmann, who
was sick with the flu but played anyway,
Terry MeCartin, and Sven Walker was really a
factor in this one, but the trio played well
enough for the whole Stanford team. All
they did was hit on 65 percent of their shots
from the floor and combine for over
two-thirds of the team's 78 points.
The victory gave the Cards a sweep of

their home-and-home series with Cal, which
ended its season at 13-6. The game promised
to be close, but only Stanford's complacency
in the second half fulfilled the prophesy.
The first half was one of the Cards' finest
all year and had them leading 45-32 at
intermission. Stanford was moving well with
and without the ball waiting for the good
shots. And they came, usually in the form of
medium-range jumpers by Dohrmann or
acrobatic lay-ups by Walker. Good outside
shooting by the Bears kept them close for
awhile, but a soft hook shot by Mark Fitzner
with 13 minutes remaining in the first half
put Stanford ahead for good.
Stanford came out running in the second
half and led by 19, its biggest lead of the
game, with six minutes gone. Then things
went sour temporarily. The Cards decided 26
minutes of good basketball was enough and
began to get lazy on defense. Cal took the
opportunity to nibble away at Stanford's
lead while Card Coach Percy Carr nibbled his

fingernails.
"I got upset because we got them down
by 20 points," he said, "but we were satisfied
with that. We should have put them away."
Stanford used an effective lob-pass play,
in which one player drives to the hoop,
receives the lob pass, and lays the ball up all
in one motion, to delay Cal's resurgence, Bob
Machado's basket in the closing minutes
pulled the Bears to within four at 77-73.
Stanford then committed two consecutive
turnovers and it looked like the Cards were
going to pull a classic "el foldo." But Cal just
ran out of time. Machado was called for a
player-control foul, giving Stanford the ball,
and the threat was over.
