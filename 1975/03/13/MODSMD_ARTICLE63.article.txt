## Howie Gone...Bub! 
### Vlae Kershner 
The next Daily you read will herald the name of
the new basketball coach, who probably will be,
and should be, current Asst. Coach Bub
Bowling.
But before I justify the above assertion and
begin the heralding process, I'd like to force you to
read some words of praise for the just-retired coach
of 21 years, Howie Dallmar.
Not that I think Dallmar has been a great
basketball coach. He's made a lot of errors. He may
be too low key. The current run-and-gun game may
have passed his pattern offense by.
But Dallmar has always been a most gracious
coach who has treated everyone — players, fans,
press, referees — with a measure of respect they did
not always return.
For most of his 21 years here, he has also been
an excellent coach, consistently posting winning
seasons despite a miniscule recruiting budget and
monumental difficulties getting recruits into
Stanford.
In the last few years, times haven't been so
good, and Dallmar exists with a frustrating 264-264
career record. Some of those losses, no doubt, were
Dallmar's fault.
And perhaps Dallmar knew this. At any rate, he
performed the final great service of a man whose
life has been basketball — he knew just when to
quit.
From what we understand, Dallmar did in fact
resign, despite Athletic Director Joe Ruetz'
insistence that he stay on. Ruetz correctly
withstood alumni pressure to fire Dallmar and let
Dallmar make the decision.
And Howie made the right one.
Well, the coach is gone, long live the coach.
You might ask, with fine head coaches and just
about everyone's number one assistant expected to
apply for the Stanford job, why Bowling will get it.
After all, won't the search committee carefully
look at all the applicants? And aren't the odds
about 50 to 1 they'll find some older supercoach
who everyone thinks will win more games next
season than the 34-year-old Bowling will?
Yes and yes. But it'll still be Bub. And rightfully

so.
Bowling will probably get the backing of the
Stanford basketball team. Mark Gilberg has already
publicly said he favored hiring Bowling. And Rich
Kelley, who probably has more influence than any
player has ever had on selection of a new coach,
said Tuesday night, "I'm going to do all I can to see
that Bub gets the job."
Kelley indicated he thought he could get the
"near-unanimous support of the team," for hiring
Bowling. And judging from the large amount of
input the football team had on selecting John
Ralston's successor, and that two members of the
basketball coach search committee will be players,
such unanimous support would pretty much cinch
it for Bub.
You might, if you're a Dallmar-hater, ask "why
continue the present policies; why get another
Howie?"
Bowling isn't another Dallmar. He's his own
man.
Oh yeah, there are lots of similarities. Bub cares
as much for his players as Howie. Bub gets along
with the press as well as Howie. Bub is as well-liked
as Howie is.
Bub is as able to deal with the sometimes
infuriating policies of Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon as Howie is(Hargadon, a rabid
basketball fan who remorsefully rejecLed a fantastic
recruit who would have given us a winning season
this year, is on the search committee).
But there are differences, too. Bub is more
intense than Howie. Bub has been able to yell at
players in practice when they aren't hustling or
listening; Howie really can't yell at anyone. There's
even some evidence, based on the 16-3 freshman
team Bub coached in 1971-72, that Bub believes in
a more running style of game than does Howie.
The Palo Alto Times' basketball writer, Larry
Lavelle, has endorsed Bub Bowling — I don't know
as much about basketball as Larry, or Rich or
Mark.
But I know enough about it to agree with them
and say that Bub Bowling should get the job.

even some evidence, based on the 16-3 freshman
team Bub coached in 1971-72, that Bub believes in
a more running style of game than does Howie.
The Palo Alto Times' basketball writer, Larry
Lavelle, has endorsed Bub Bowling — I don't know
as much about basketball as Larry, or Rich or
Mark.
But I know enough about it to agree with them
and say that Bub Bowling should get the job.

The next Daily you read will herald the name of
the new basketball coach, who probably will be,
and should be, current Asst. Coach Bub
Bowling.
But before I justify the above assertion and
begin the heralding process, I'd like to force you to
read some words of praise for the just-retired coach
of 21 years, Howie Dallmar.
Not that I think Dallmar has been a great
basketball coach. He's made a lot of errors. He may
be too low key. The current run-and-gun game may
have passed his pattern offense by.
But Dallmar has always been a most gracious
coach who has treated everyone — players, fans,
press, referees — with a measure of respect they did
not always return.
For most of his 21 years here, he has also been
an excellent coach, consistently posting winning
seasons despite a miniscule recruiting budget and
monumental difficulties getting recruits into
Stanford.
In the last few years, times haven't been so
good, and Dallmar exists with a frustrating 264-264
career record. Some of those losses, no doubt, were
Dallmar's fault.
And perhaps Dallmar knew this. At any rate, he
performed the final great service of a man whose
life has been basketball — he knew just when to
quit.
From what we understand, Dallmar did in fact
resign, despite Athletic Director Joe Ruetz'
insistence that he stay on. Ruetz correctly
withstood alumni pressure to fire Dallmar and let
Dallmar make the decision.
And Howie made the right one.
Well, the coach is gone, long live the coach.
You might ask, with fine head coaches and just
about everyone's number one assistant expected to
apply for the Stanford job, why Bowling will get it.
After all, won't the search committee carefully
look at all the applicants? And aren't the odds
about 50 to 1 they'll find some older supercoach
who everyone thinks will win more games next
season than the 34-year-old Bowling will?
Yes and yes. But it'll still be Bub. And rightfully

so.
Bowling will probably get the backing of the
Stanford basketball team. Mark Gilberg has already
publicly said he favored hiring Bowling. And Rich
Kelley, who probably has more influence than any
player has ever had on selection of a new coach,
said Tuesday night, "I'm going to do all I can to see
that Bub gets the job."
Kelley indicated he thought he could get the
"near-unanimous support of the team," for hiring
Bowling. And judging from the large amount of
input the football team had on selecting John
Ralston's successor, and that two members of the
basketball coach search committee will be players,
such unanimous support would pretty much cinch
it for Bub.
You might, if you're a Dallmar-hater, ask "why
continue the present policies; why get another
Howie?"
Bowling isn't another Dallmar. He's his own
man.
Oh yeah, there are lots of similarities. Bub cares
as much for his players as Howie. Bub gets along
with the press as well as Howie. Bub is as well-liked
as Howie is.
Bub is as able to deal with the sometimes
infuriating policies of Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon as Howie is(Hargadon, a rabid
basketball fan who remorsefully rejecLed a fantastic
recruit who would have given us a winning season
this year, is on the search committee).
But there are differences, too. Bub is more
intense than Howie. Bub has been able to yell at
players in practice when they aren't hustling or
listening; Howie really can't yell at anyone. There's
even some evidence, based on the 16-3 freshman
team Bub coached in 1971-72, that Bub believes in
a more running style of game than does Howie.
