# Seek & Destroy Takes IMs
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Number one seed Seek and
Destroy came from behind Sunday
night to win the IM basketball
championship at Maples Pavilion
(Seek and Destroy topped the
upset-minded Phis, 54-48, before
about 100 fans. For Seek and
Destroy the win capped a season
of preparation for player-coach
Mark Florant, who assembled his
team of former Stanford JV
players all the way back in
November.
The game was a physical one
with 39 fouls, 22 on the Phi Delts.
The Phis did have the edge
physically, but in the long run,
the outside shooting of Seek and
Destroy's Marty Moroski, and a
disciplined floor play paved the
way for Seek and Destroy's win.
The win wasn't an easy one for
Seek and Destroy, however. The
Phi Delts jumped out early to a
6-2 margin and extended it to
22-15 with seven minutes to go in
the first half. Seek and Destroy
managed to stay in it at the line
and after an ice-cold start,
Moroski and Brad Power began to
exert themselves to narrow the
margin to 31-27 at the half.
The first half stats show why
the Phis had the halftime lead as
they hit 14-24 from the floor
(.583) compared to Seek and
Destroy's dubious 9-21 (.428).
The Phi Delts' Bill Singler led the
first half scoring with 10, as he
drove through, around and under
Seek and Destroy's man-to-man
defense.
After a halftime discussion,
Seek and Destroy switched to a
zone defense and it was all over
for the Phis. S & D began a surge

that reached a peak midway
through the second half when
they pulled into a 10 point lead,
39-29.
The zone completely stifled
the Phis as their shooting
percentage dropped to a dismal

.231 (6-26) in the second half.
For Seek and Destroy, Moroski
canned 5-7 in the second stanza,
and Power chipped in five more as
the team eased its way through
the final minutes.
Moroski finished as the game's
high scorer with 15. Power added
12, and Mike Henehan scored 10
for Seek and Destroy. For the Phi
Delts, Singler and reserve Bob
Oshetski finished with 12.
Oshetski was the only defense for
the Phi Delts in the second half as
he hit 3-6 from the outside arid
chipped in two free throws for
almost half of his teams' second
half point production.
In the B final Bob Glick hit a
25-foot bomb with two seconds
remaining on the clock to give
unseeded Emerson the title and a
40-38 win over the sixth-seeded
Phi Chis. Emerson had led the
game from the opening tipoff
until seven seconds remained.
Then the Phis Steve Hathaway hit
his only two points of the game, a
15-footer that swished from the
left baseline. Emerson
immediately called time out.
After the time, Glick hustled
down the court exchanging passes
with teammate Jim Wilkie before
releasing his shot with about four
seconds showing. The shot had a
low trajectory but it swished
cleanly through the net and time
expired.

In the soccer playoffs, the
Engineers dumped Education 3-1
to capture the A playoffs as Jose
Carredino scored 3 goals for the
Engineers. In the B's, unseeded
Arroyo upset top seed CSA 3-2 in
eight overtimes.
