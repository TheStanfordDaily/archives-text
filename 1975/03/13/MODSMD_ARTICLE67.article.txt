# Dallmar's Predecessor Talks Basketball
## 'Maverick' Burnett A Winner 
### MIKE TOLLIN 
In the years 1952-1954, Elvis
Presley was just getting his act
together. Dick Nixon was busy
chasing down commies and
making his dog a celebrity and
Bob Burnett was the head
basketball coach at Leland
Stanford's little playground of the
west. Yep folks, there was a
Stanford basketball coach before
Howie Dallmar. It only seems like
he's been here forever.
Recently, there was a chance
to chat with Burnett at
L'Omelette, a fine French
restaurant on El Camino Real,
where he is currently the manager.
"Mr. B" sat his listener down that
night with a cold brew, and
proceeded to deliver a scintillating
monologue which could have been
monickered "Stanford and
Basketball — the Last 40
Years."
After two and a half hours of
raucous remarks and hilarious
anecdotes, one left the restaurant
amazed at the clarity and scope of
Burnett's memory. For example,
he can tell you that on Jan. 6,
1952, Stanford, led by Ed Tucker,
the school's first black basketball
player, nipped UCLA 73-71 in
Los Angeles, for their last win in
Bruin territory. One soon begins
to wonder if the B.S. Burnett
received from Stanford in 1939
wasn't a degree in /iasketball
.Stories.
For Bob Burnett is truly a
"basketball man." His life has
been centered around the game
for as long as he can remember. "I
grew up on the other side of the
tracks [in Oakland |," he says,
"and basketball really opened up
the doors for me. Only my family
has meant more to my life."
Burnett played his college ball
at Stanford, and then hung
around here to help out head
coach Everett Dean. He stayed on
as Stanford's freshman coach and

assistant varsity coach through the
'41-'42 season, a campaign in
which the old Indians, led by
sophomore Howie Dallmar, won
the NCAA title over Dartmouth.
In the years since then, Burnett
has been head coach at Utah
State, supervisor of Pac-8 officials
and commissioner of the WCAC,
in addition to his stint
as Stanford's top basketball man.
In those days, Burnett was, by
his admission, a "hell-raiser" and a
"maverick." He once had his team
hold the ball for seven minutes to
upset USC. "I just said, 'Screw
'em!' " he recalls. "After all, you
gotta play to win."
Unfortunately, Burnett's teams
could not win often enough. He
compiled a 41-39 record overall,
but in Pac-8 play, his teams
hovered near the bottom. Finally
the mediocrity forced him to step
aside.
"I'll tell you," Burnett reflects,
"I just didn't like losing. My ego
couldn't take it, and practice in
February gets boring when you're
not winning. I just thoug/it 1
wasn't going to be able to change
things, and I figured I might as
well quit before they fired me."
Now, 21 years later,
Burnett's successor has also opted
out, and Mr. B. thinks he knows
why. "I know Howard so well,"
Burnett says,"and I think it's
been eating his guts out, not Peing
able to have a winning team.
"We used to call him Mortimer
Snerd," Burnett continues,
"because he was a big
Scandinavian-type and everyone
liked him. But he absorbs too
many body blows, and all I cari
say is 'God bless ya, Ilowit. it's a
good thing you got out before it
killed you."
Many people have been saying
that Dallmar was the reason that
the Cards didn't fare any better
this season, but Burnett disagree;.
"Technically, Howard is an

excellent coach," he says."He
probably needed to be m.»re
demonstrative, but no one could
have won any more with i nis
year's team. The material just
wasn't there," he says. "Hell, the
guards were so weak, I might have
been able to make the team."
Burnett still goes to all of
Stanford's home games, and lie
desperately wants to see a winning
program here. But he doesn ♦
think it'll happen until some
changes are made in University
policy. "It's about time that
someone in that sanctimonious
school," he bellows, "goes up to
[President] Lyman and says,' For
God's sake, I need this guy for 'he
program, please call the
admissions department and tell
them to let him in.' They dc it
outside of athletics, so why can 1 !
we get just a couple of borderline
cases for the basketball team'."
As must be obvious, Burnett
expresses his opinions freely and
frankly. More samples: of Maples
Pavilion he says, "They blew that
stupid thing," and his old pal
John Wooden he compares to a
"radical who got a lot of money
and became a Bircher."
Burnett is very fond of his
alma mater and of the country in
which he lives, and when he
speaks of one it often applies to
the other. "We're so affluent," he
says, "but we have so many
problems. We have to work to
keep our individuality and we
have to start giving people from
different backgrounds more of a
chance. Where's our strength in
leadership, anyway?"
Burnett got to know Gerald
Ford well aboard a ship once, but
his boyhood hero, David Packard
[Stanford grad of
Hewlett-Packard note|, is the
kind of person he thinks we need
more of. And, maybe, a few more
Bob Burnetts to keep us on our
toes wouldn't hurt either.
