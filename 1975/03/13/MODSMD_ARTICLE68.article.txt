Hmmmmm.
Young said that after the Cards broke a losing
streak and beat Santa Clara and Cal State-Hayward.
And since he said it Stanford swept a three-game
series with Fresno State, bombing the Bulldogs by a
total score of 27-4, and extending their win-streak
to five games.
Hmmmmm.
The Cards, 6-10 on March 3, are now 11-10 and
heading for their annual Riverside tournament, held
March 24-29 at UC-Riverside. Things are looking
pretty nifty.
Stanford 9, Fresno St. 1
Last Saturday night the Cards whipped Fresno
9-1 behind the two-hit pitching of lefty John
Yandle and the two-home-run hitting of catcher
Bruce Robinson (his fifth and sixth homers of
the season).
Yandle, shakey in the first inning (he walked the
first three men he faced and went to a
three-and-two count on the fourth), pitched the
full nine innings and struck out 15 Fresno batters.
Robinson also had a single, driving in a total of six
of the Cards' runs.

RBIs each. Perez hit a two-run homer in the eighth
inning.
Al Arthur (curiously identified as Mike
Williamson in last week's Santa Clara game
summary) went the distance for the Cards, and, like

righthander retired the first 15 batters he faced,
and raised his record to 3-1.

Williamson). Williamson pitched two more shutout
innings but got in trouble in the sixth and left the
game with two outs. He gave up three runs on two
hits.
