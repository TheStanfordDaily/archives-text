# Card Net Duo Falls In Finals
## 
### RON BECK 
If you read in some other
paper about how the Stanford
tennis team lost a tournament to
UCLA in La Jolla last weekend,
you can forget about it.
A doubles team from Stanford
lost to a doubles team from
UCLA in the finals, but the
Stanford tennis team still has an
unbeaten record.
Stanford entered three teams
in the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships last weekend, but
the tourney wasn't a collegiate
tournament. It was open to
everyone, pros included.
Finals Loss
John Whitlinger and Pat DuPre
made it to the finals of the
tourney, but dropped a straight
set decision to Brian Teacher and
Peter Fleming — both of UCLA —
to place second.
It was the fourth time in the
last five years that a Card pair
made it to the championship
match but lost. Last year,"Whit
and Dupes" also lost in the finals.
Two years before, Roscoe Tanner
and Sandy Mayer took second
place, and before them came Rick
Fisher and Gery Groslimond.
On the way to the finals, Whit
and Dupes beat Hans

Gildermeister and Mike Wayman,
both of USC; Tom Kreiss and
Ferdi Taygan, a UCLA doublet;
and Bruce Nichols and David
Parker, another UCLA pair.
Other Teams
The two other Stanford pairs
entered both dropped second
round matches. Craig Johnson and
Bill Maze upset USC's Chris Lewis
and Bruce Manson, but then lost
to Butch Walts, also of USC, and
Sashi Menon, an ex-Trojan turned
pro.
Mark Mitchell and Chip Fisher
topped professionals Walter
Redondo and Buzz Strode on the
first day, and then lost to the
eventual winners, Teacher and
Fleming, in the quarter-finals.
Stanford's official doubles
record is unaffected by the
tourney and still stands at 11 wins
and seven losses, a dismal statistic
when matched against the team's
35-1 singles record.
Gould Not Worried
Coach Dick Gould doesn't
seem worried, though. "We're still
experimenting with our doubles
lineups," he said. "We've never
had set doubles teams this early in
the season."
Gould will get a chance to
experiment with new teams
through the spring break. The
Cards don't play any matches
until March 27, when the team
travels to Georgia.
Stanford played the Bulldogs
earlier this year in the semifinals
of the National Team Indoors and
pounded them, 9-0.
Net Notes: Some of the players
are taking advantage of a dead
week lull in studies with
extra-curricular tournament play.
The Palo Alto Times reports that
Nick Saviano and Gene Mayer are
in a toumey in Mampton,
Virginia, and that Jim Delaney is
in a Washington, D.C. World
Championship Tennis
Tournament.
Final: Brian Teacher-Peter Fleming
(UCLA) d. John Whitlinger-Pat DuPre
(Stanford), 6-4, 6-4, 6-1.
Semifinals: Wh i tlinger-DuPre
(Stanford) d. Tom Kreiss-Ferdi Taygan
(UCLA), 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1;
Teacher-Fleming (UCLA) d. Butch
Walts (USC)-Sashi Menon (India), 6-4,
6-4, 6-4.

CHIP SHOT—Stanford golfer Dave Baskins, shown earlier this season,
is playing this weekend in the San Francisco City Championships
semifinal round. Baskins will be facing 61-year old Henry Suico in a
36-hole playoff match.
If you read in some other
paper about how the Stanford
tennis team lost a tournament to
UCLA in La Jolla last weekend,
you can forget about it.
A doubles team from Stanford
lost to a doubles team from
UCLA in the finals, but the
Stanford tennis team still has an
unbeaten record.
Stanford entered three teams
in the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships last weekend, but
the tourney wasn't a collegiate
tournament. It was open to
everyone, pros included.
Finals Loss
John Whitlinger and Pat DuPre
made it to the finals of the
tourney, but dropped a straight
set decision to Brian Teacher and
Peter Fleming — both of UCLA —
to place second.
It was the fourth time in the
last five years that a Card pair
made it to the championship
match but lost. Last year,"Whit
and Dupes" also lost in the finals.
Two years before, Roscoe Tanner
and Sandy Mayer took second
place, and before them came Rick
Fisher and Gery Groslimond.
On the way to the finals, Whit
and Dupes beat Hans

Gildermeister and Mike Wayman,
both of USC; Tom Kreiss and
Ferdi Taygan, a UCLA doublet;
and Bruce Nichols and David
Parker, another UCLA pair.
Other Teams
The two other Stanford pairs
entered both dropped second
round matches. Craig Johnson and
Bill Maze upset USC's Chris Lewis
and Bruce Manson, but then lost
to Butch Walts, also of USC, and
Sashi Menon, an ex-Trojan turned
pro.
Mark Mitchell and Chip Fisher
topped professionals Walter
Redondo and Buzz Strode on the
first day, and then lost to the
eventual winners, Teacher and
Fleming, in the quarter-finals.
Stanford's official doubles
record is unaffected by the
tourney and still stands at 11 wins
and seven losses, a dismal statistic
when matched against the team's
35-1 singles record.
Gould Not Worried
Coach Dick Gould doesn't
seem worried, though. "We're still
experimenting with our doubles
lineups," he said. "We've never
had set doubles teams this early in
the season."
Gould will get a chance to
experiment with new teams
through the spring break. The
Cards don't play any matches
until March 27, when the team
travels to Georgia.
Stanford played the Bulldogs
earlier this year in the semifinals
of the National Team Indoors and
pounded them, 9-0.
Net Notes: Some of the players
are taking advantage of a dead
week lull in studies with
extra-curricular tournament play.
The Palo Alto Times reports that
Nick Saviano and Gene Mayer are
in a toumey in Mampton,
Virginia, and that Jim Delaney is
in a Washington, D.C. World
Championship Tennis
Tournament.
Final: Brian Teacher-Peter Fleming
(UCLA) d. John Whitlinger-Pat DuPre
(Stanford), 6-4, 6-4, 6-1.
Semifinals: Wh i tlinger-DuPre
