# Baskins In City Semifinals
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Dave Baskins is probably the
most anonymous semifinalist in
the 59-year history of the San
Francisco City Golf
Championships. But he is a
semifinalist, even though you
have to read the fine print in the
Chronicle or Examiner to prove it.
Saturday, Baskins will play
61-year-old Henry Suico in a
36-hole semifinal match at
Harding Park. Scott Hoyt meets
Frank Mazion in the other
semifinal, with the winners
squaring off Sunday for the
championship of "The World's
Largest Golf Tournament."
Baskins advanced to the
semifinals quietly, unlike most of
the other leading contenders.
Teammate Aly Trompas, who lost
in the third round Friday, was
shown twice on television film
clips, and was also the subject of a
long article in the Chronicle.
Hoyt was featured in Art
Spander's Golf Notebook column
in Saturday's green sheet, and
Suico grabbed the headlines after
Sunday's quarterfinals.
Mazion had his share of ink,
along with 17-year-old Mike
Wiechers, Trompas' third-round
conquerer.
In all there has been a lot of
media coverage, but none

concerning Baskins except the
summaries buried in six-point
type at the bottom of each
newspaper article.
It has been rather frustrating
for the Stanford senior, but he's
been treated worse. Two years
ago, after he won his first-round
match in the City tourney, the
name David Valasquez appeared
in the Sunday Examiner instead
of David Baskins.
"My game just isn't
flamboyant," Baskins explained.
"My strength is consistency, and
while people will remember a 68
and excuse the 76 that follows, no
one remembers two straight 72s
except maybe my mom and dad.
"I guess I don't know the right
bullshit to tell reporters. My
interviews are kind of like my
game — overtly consistent and
boring."
Actually, Baskins' performance
last weekend was far from boring.
Saturday he was three down after
11 holes and two down with four
to go, but one-putted four of the
last five greens to defeat Jim
Knoll, one up.
Sunday, he scored another
1-up victory, defeating Ray
Pellegrini with a solid
two-over-par performance.
If he wins again this weekend,
the newspapers and television

stations might not have a choice.
"I can see the headlines now,"
Baskins said. " 'Suico Loses In
City Semifinal .. .' "

Chip Shots: Stanford will
regroup as a team during spring
vacation for the Nor-Cal Masters
tournament at Half Moon Bay
March 22-23 and the Western
Intercollegiates at Santa Cruz
March 26-28. The Western
Intercollegiates will be the Cards'
first major test of the season.
Coach Bud Finger has decided
on a lineup of Baskins, Trompas,
Conrad Nilmeier, Mike Peck, Jay
Johnston and George Pettinger for
the spring-vacation events.
Pettinger, who finished third in
last year's Pac-B's, missed most of
the early matches due to class
conflicts and failed qualifying
attempts.
The Cards improved their
dual-match record to 5-1 Sunday
with a 26V2-V2 victory over the
Stanford Golf Club. Johnston was
medalist with a 73. The freshman
team lost to the Golf Club 19-8,
lowering its season record to 6-2.

conflicts and failed qualifying
attempts.
The Cards improved their
dual-match record to 5-1 Sunday
with a 26V2-V2 victory over the
Stanford Golf Club. Johnston was
medalist with a 73. The freshman
team lost to the Golf Club 19-8,
lowering its season record to 6-2.
Dave Baskins is probably the
most anonymous semifinalist in
the 59-year history of the San
Francisco City Golf
Championships. But he is a
semifinalist, even though you
have to read the fine print in the
Chronicle or Examiner to prove it.
Saturday, Baskins will play
61-year-old Henry Suico in a
36-hole semifinal match at
Harding Park. Scott Hoyt meets
Frank Mazion in the other
semifinal, with the winners
squaring off Sunday for the
championship of "The World's
Largest Golf Tournament."
Baskins advanced to the
semifinals quietly, unlike most of
the other leading contenders.
Teammate Aly Trompas, who lost
in the third round Friday, was
shown twice on television film
clips, and was also the subject of a
long article in the Chronicle.
Hoyt was featured in Art
Spander's Golf Notebook column
in Saturday's green sheet, and
Suico grabbed the headlines after
Sunday's quarterfinals.
Mazion had his share of ink,
along with 17-year-old Mike
Wiechers, Trompas' third-round
conquerer.
In all there has been a lot of
media coverage, but none

concerning Baskins except the
summaries buried in six-point
type at the bottom of each
newspaper article.
It has been rather frustrating
for the Stanford senior, but he's
been treated worse. Two years
ago, after he won his first-round
match in the City tourney, the
name David Valasquez appeared
in the Sunday Examiner instead
of David Baskins.
"My game just isn't
flamboyant," Baskins explained.
"My strength is consistency, and
while people will remember a 68
and excuse the 76 that follows, no
one remembers two straight 72s
except maybe my mom and dad.
"I guess I don't know the right
bullshit to tell reporters. My
interviews are kind of like my
game — overtly consistent and
boring."
Actually, Baskins' performance
last weekend was far from boring.
Saturday he was three down after
11 holes and two down with four
to go, but one-putted four of the
last five greens to defeat Jim
Knoll, one up.
Sunday, he scored another
1-up victory, defeating Ray
Pellegrini with a solid
two-over-par performance.
If he wins again this weekend,
the newspapers and television

stations might not have a choice.
"I can see the headlines now,"
Baskins said. " 'Suico Loses In
City Semifinal .. .' "

Chip Shots: Stanford will
regroup as a team during spring
vacation for the Nor-Cal Masters
tournament at Half Moon Bay
March 22-23 and the Western
Intercollegiates at Santa Cruz
March 26-28. The Western
Intercollegiates will be the Cards'
first major test of the season.
Coach Bud Finger has decided
on a lineup of Baskins, Trompas,
Conrad Nilmeier, Mike Peck, Jay
Johnston and George Pettinger for
the spring-vacation events.
Pettinger, who finished third in
last year's Pac-B's, missed most of
the early matches due to class
conflicts and failed qualifying
attempts.
