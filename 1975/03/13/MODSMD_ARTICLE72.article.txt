# Fifth-Place Finish Upsets Tankers

### BOB KUSTEL 
"It's what always seems to
happen when we go down there,"
said Stanford swim Coach Jim
Gaughran, referring to Stanford's
disappointing Pac-8 showing over
the weekend. The Cards could
only manage a fifth place showing
behind USC, UCLA, Washington
and the surprising California
Bears.
Cal, who only two weeks ago
was crushed by Stanford in a dual
meet, did much better than the
expected. "They had all shaved

down," said Gaughran, "and I've
j got to give them a lot of credit for
» turning in a great performance."
i There were some other factors
. involved, however, particularly
r the loss of breastroker Stu Corliss,
j who spent the weekend in a Los
, Angeles hospital with the flu.
j There were some bright spots
j for the Cards, however. John
Hencken.as is his custom, "easily
won" the 100 and 200 yard
> breastroke, as well finishing sixth
I in the 200 Individual Medley.
Dave Fairbank continued his
I success in the sprints, touching
out USC's Joe Bottom in the 50
free and garnering a third in the
100. And finally, Mike Bruner
added another record to his
rapidly growing collection,
knocking 24 seconds off the Pac-8
standard in the 1650-free.
"Everybody swam well," said
Gaughran, "and every body scored
some points. People would swim
their best times and come up
. six-tenths of a second short here,
one-tenth of a second short there,
of qualifying for the NCAAs."
The upcoming NCAAs will
wind up the season, and Gaughran
is confident. "We're still in the
ballpark," he claims, "and we'll
start concentrating a lot more on
sprints now."
