# Spartans Display Strength

SAN JOSE—For a while last
Saturday, it looked like the
Stanford track team was about to
set the track and field crowd on
its ear by upsetting 13th ranked
San Jose State at Bud Winter
Field.
The Cards won three of the
first six events, and jumped to a
27-23 lead over the powerful
Spartans. But then it was San Jose
State's turn to show why it's the
Bay Area's best track squad. The
Spartans swept the field events
and took all the running events
sealing a 92-53 win.
Although Stanford track Coach

Payton Jordan had predicted that
his Cards would score 60 points,
he wasn't too disappointed. "We
made them come after us. They
had to come up with some of
their best performances to beat
us."
The meet marked the
emergence of two Cards who
should figure prominently this
year — freshman quarter-miler
Alan Sheets and hurdler John
Foster. Competing against the
classy field in the 440, Sheets
turned in a 48.2 to win the event,
while teammate Scott Wingo was
second with a 48.4. Sheets also
helped Stanford win the mile

relay, opening up a commanding
lead in the third leg of the event.
The Cardinal quartet of Matt
Hogsett, James Lofton, Sheets
and Wingo clocked a 3:13.7 for
the win.
Foster, returning to action
after an injury, nipped teammate
Dave Bagshaw in the 120 hurdles
with a 14.3. "He ran an excellent
race off an injury," Jordan said.
"He's had a chipped bone so he's
had to practice on the grass."
Sophomore miler Steve Crowley
gave Stanford its only other
victory, clocking a 4:11.1 in his
specialty.
At the outset of the meet, six
meet records looked as though
they would fall, but the only
thing that fell at Bud Winter Field
was rain. Only one athlete
managed to eclipse a meet record
— San Jose Slate triple jumper
Ron Livers. Livers leaped 51-6'/4
to win the event despite slippery
runways.
Stanford, now 1-1 for the
season, will return to action on
March 22 when it hosts the
Stanford Relays.
