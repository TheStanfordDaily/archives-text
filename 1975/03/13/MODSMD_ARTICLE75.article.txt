# Marcy Highlights Card Gymnastics

### CHRIS KAMEL 
Ted Marcy and the pommel
horse are beginning to become
synonyms in men's gymnastics.
The Stanford junior once again
took first place in the event at the
Pacific Eight mens' gymnastics
championships at Cal's Harmon
Gym last weekend.
Marcy will travel to the
nationals at Indiana State where
he will try to retain his title as
NCAA pommel horse champion
for the third straight year.
Stanford took sixth in the
conference with a total of 392.95
points. Cal finished in first. Top
performances came from
freshman Bob Farb and senior
Bob Anderson. Farb and
Anderson placed fifth and sixth in
the all - around category with
scores of 102.85 and 102.25,
respectively.
Marcy entered the pommel
horse finals with an average of
9.575 in the compulsories. His
routine was scheduled last in the
competition; to win he had to
beat a composite score of 18.475.
With a 9.7 average in the finals he
passed the leader for a total score
of 19.275.
"Ted won the pommel horse

easily. He's only a junior and
should continue to excel in that
category. Right now, he's got to
keep on working to pn'pare for
the nationals, April 3to 5,"
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada
said.
Marcy said, "There was no
pressure on me. Even though mine
was the last routine, I knew that 1
had done well in the preliminaries.
The pressure that you have is only
put on by yourself. I was just
looking for a good routine," he
added.
Farb and Anderson, who both
missed qualifying for the
Nationals in the all around
classification by about two points,
reached the finals of the floor
exercise while Anderson also got
to the horizontal bar finals. Last
year. Anderson finished second in
the floor exercise in the same
finals.
As the workhorse of Stanford's
team, Anderson finished sixth
with a total score of 17.375 in the
floor exercise. He earned a final
average of 8.5 after a preliminary
score of 8.875. He also placed
seventh in the horizonal bar with
a total of 17.525.
"Bob had problems with his
right shoulder last year and was
hindered in some of the events he
was entered in. With Steve Hug
graduated, he was our only
possibility to qualify for the
NCAA championship in all
around," Hamada said.
Farb, who Hamada said could
possibly be the Pac-8 champion in
the all around category as a
senior, finished fifth. He also
finished eighth in the floor
exercise with an average in the
finals of 8.2 and a composite total
of 16.975.
"We are lacking the fourth men
on the parallel bars and the
horizontal bar. We got about 10
points behind. That was
important for the team total.
We'll need to work in these
areas," Hamada said.
He added, most of Stanford's
problems in building a good
gymnastics team comes from not
being able to recruit outstanding
gymnasts.
"When I have a tough time
recruiting, it is hard to form a
good team. We really missed Steve
Hug who finished first in the
all-around and the parallel bars
and second in the horizontal bar.
There are good freshman, but 1
will have to work them hard on
technique and get them more
experienced."
