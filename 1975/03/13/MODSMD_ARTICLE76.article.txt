# Pro Prognosis
## Uncle Sam Gets A Break 
### Dan Pyne 
Well, here we go again."lnsane Prognosticator
Blunders Over Small-Time Sports." Followed by
"Public Yawns, Mumbles For Garvin. .. ."
And this week's Pro Prognosis sport of
inconsequence is (ironically enough) amateur
skiing.
Amateur skiing?
Well, not-so-amateur skiing according to the
latest news from our "friends" in Europe. The
Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI) recently
revealed plans to guarantee its top World Cup racers
31 million lira (orabout $46,500) this season. And
the rest of the alpine-competing nations are
planning similar programs.
Three years ago Austria's two-time World Cup
winner, Karl Schranz, was booted out of the Winter
Olympics for actions considered unsuitable for an
amature athlete — endorsing products. Schranz,
protesting, claimed that everyone did it. Make
money, that is.
He was almost right.
Everyone was doing it (and is still doing it in one
way or the other) except the United States. Honest
Uncle Sam. The Gullible Yanks.
And, floundering on an inadequate budget, the
Red, White and Blue came out of Japan in 1972
with one medal: a gold by Barbara Cochran in the
women's slalom.
In seven Winter Olympics the United States has
collected only three gold medals, all of them by
women, two of them in 1948. And in umpteen
years of international competition the American
team has not done much better.
"Ah," you say, "now this stupid Pyne is trying
to tell us that money makes a winner."
Yes.
In 1968 the U.S. Ski Team was shut out in
men's events despite the presence of Spider Sabich
and Billy Kidd (who won a silver medal in 1964).
Sabich joined the newly-organized Benson and
Hedges pro tour and was its leading money-winner
two years running.
And at Sapporo the American team included
Hank Kashiwa and both Tyler and Terry Palmer.
Kashiwa was unimpressive in the downhill; Tyler
Palmer was disappointing in the slalom. Now Hank

Kashiwa is the pro tour's leading money-winner,
and Palmer (both of them in fact) is not far back.
Pro skiing is, admittedly, somewhat different
from the amateur form. The former involves
head-to-head competition, the latter is generally a
race against the clock. But it is doubtful whether
this gives Americans any edge.
Money makes a winner. Or at least a more solid
competitor. Now it's legal, too.
A recent Olympic Committee edict that
ski nations could compensate athletes who were
losing potential take-home pay because of their
involvement in Alpine racing, gives the U.S. Ski
Team a big break — fhe chance to keep its members
fed without feeling morally guilty (that's why we
never paid them before, you see).
In the past Yankee skiers have "officially"
received only token amounts of money for "out of
pocket" expenses. In light of the new
developments, U.S. Alpine team director Hank
Tauber hopes this will change.
"I'm firmly convinced with a little more
financial help than we've been getting, our team
would be a top world skiing power by 1978. I
never have subscribed to the theory that Europeans
have an edge over us just because most of their stars
are reared in the Alps."
Money could be directed to the U.S. ski team
from corporate contributions as it is in Switzerland;
50 percent from ski manufacturers, 35 percent
from boot and bindings manufacturers, 10 percent
from clothing companies, and 5 percent from ski
accessories manufacturers.
But it should be directed to them somehow.
The present budget for the U.S. Alpine team is
$425,000, and Tauber thinks about $500,000 is
needed for the next three years to build a really
world-class team.
The magic of money has put Americans at the
top of the pro world; there is no reason to doubt it
will aid the "amateur" program.
Alas, the death of the "true amateur" American
skier is the price one must pay for such painful
action.
Here in the land of truth, honesty, good will and
inflation, no one will grieve for long.

Team a big break — fhe chance to keep its members

financial help than we've been getting, our team
would be a top world skiing power by 1978. I

Money could be directed to the U.S. ski team
from corporate contributions as it is in Switzerland;
50 percent from ski manufacturers, 35 percent
from boot and bindings manufacturers, 10 percent
from clothing companies, and 5 percent from ski

The present budget for the U.S. Alpine team is

And this week's Pro Prognosis sport of
inconsequence is (ironically enough) amateur
skiing.
Amateur skiing?
Well, not-so-amateur skiing according to the
latest news from our "friends" in Europe. The
Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI) recently
revealed plans to guarantee its top World Cup racers
31 million lira (orabout $46,500) this season. And
the rest of the alpine-competing nations are
planning similar programs.
Three years ago Austria's two-time World Cup
winner, Karl Schranz, was booted out of the Winter
Olympics for actions considered unsuitable for an
amature athlete — endorsing products. Schranz,
protesting, claimed that everyone did it. Make
money, that is.
He was almost right.
Everyone was doing it (and is still doing it in one
way or the other) except the United States. Honest
Uncle Sam. The Gullible Yanks.
And, floundering on an inadequate budget, the
Red, White and Blue came out of Japan in 1972
with one medal: a gold by Barbara Cochran in the
women's slalom.
In seven Winter Olympics the United States has
collected only three gold medals, all of them by
women, two of them in 1948. And in umpteen
years of international competition the American
team has not done much better.
"Ah," you say, "now this stupid Pyne is trying
to tell us that money makes a winner."
Yes.
In 1968 the U.S. Ski Team was shut out in
men's events despite the presence of Spider Sabich
and Billy Kidd (who won a silver medal in 1964).
Sabich joined the newly-organized Benson and
Hedges pro tour and was its leading money-winner
two years running.
And at Sapporo the American team included
Hank Kashiwa and both Tyler and Terry Palmer.
Kashiwa was unimpressive in the downhill; Tyler
Palmer was disappointing in the slalom. Now Hank

Kashiwa is the pro tour's leading money-winner,
and Palmer (both of them in fact) is not far back.
Pro skiing is, admittedly, somewhat different
from the amateur form. The former involves
head-to-head competition, the latter is generally a
race against the clock. But it is doubtful whether
this gives Americans any edge.
