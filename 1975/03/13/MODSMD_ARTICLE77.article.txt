# Skiers Outclassed In NCAAs
## 
### JEFF PARIETTI 
The Stanford ski team
completed a successful 1975
season over the weekend at the
NCAA skiing championships, held
this year at Purgatory, Colorado.
The Cards, second place finishers
in the regional meet, didn't fare as
well in the strong 17-team
national field. Stanford failed to
score a point and finished in a last
place tie with three other schools.
The University of Colorado
repeated as the NCAA team
champion for the fourth
consecutive year. Vermont
finished in the runner-up spot
while Denver placed third.
Nevada-Reno, who defeated
Stanford in the regional meet,
took 11th position.
Junior Dave Horth was
Stanford's best performer. He led
the Cards in both the slalom and
the downhill races, taking 27th
and 46th respectively. Another

junior, Tom Hutton, finished 47th
in the downhill.
The cross-country turned out
to be a disaster for Stanford. One
skier finished last, another used
the wrong wax on his skis and
failed to finish because of it.
The team was plagued by falls
in the alpine events. Freshman
Dave Herbert, who won the
downhill in the regionals, had a
good time going in his downhill P
run until he fell on a tough part of
the course. Herbert, Hutton, Mark
Colville, and Kit Weld all fell in
the slalom event.
The one bright performance
was Horth's efforts in the slalom.
Stritter said that "Horth almost
got us some points. If he had
placed 21st we would have scored
in the competition. Unfortuately,
he missed a gate and had to climb
back around it, so that cost him
some time and some places."
Stritter was somewhat

disappointed with his team's
overall performance but said that
he is hopeful for the future.
"Next year, we'll have everyone
back so we can only get better.
The first competition on the
national level is always very tough
for a team. But the experience we
gained this year will help when
the nationals roll around next
season."
