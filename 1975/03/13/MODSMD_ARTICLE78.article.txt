# Women Tankers In Nationals
## 
### STEPHEN WALT 
The Stanford women's swim
team completes its season this
weekend at Arizona State
University in Tempe, Arizona.
They journey to the Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women (AIAW) National
Championships, which should
feature approximately 500
swimmers from 100 different
schools across the nation.
This is the third year that
Stanford has entered a team in the
Nationals, and the nine Cards who
qualified are the largest
contingent ever to represent the
women's athletic program here.
The team expects to finish in
the top 10.
Defending national champion
Vicki Hays, who holds the meet
record in the 50 breaststroke with
a time of 30.9 seconds, leads the
Card tankers. Hays will enter both
the 50 and 100 breaststrokes, and
may enter the individual medley,
butterfly or spring freestyles as

well.
Stanford will have additional
depth in the breaststroke provided
by co-captain Cathy Kriegshauser
and freshman Liz Lambert.
Kriegshauser will also handle IM
and freestyle chores.
Freshman Anne Brodell will
swim the distance freestyles.
Brodell was recently invited to
travel to London as a U.S.
representative in the Crystal
Palace International meet to be
held in April.

Mei Ong, a senior and
co-captain, will share backstroke
duties with freshman Megan
Edwards. Each will handle one leg
of the medley relays.
Rounding out the squad are
Kathi Heinze, the only remaining
member from Stanford's original
Nationals team, and sprint
freestylers Nan Leuschel and
Holly Houston, who will compete
in the 50 free and relays.
Arizona state is the host for the
three-day meet.

but the Stanford II team went undefeated (10-0), finishing their
