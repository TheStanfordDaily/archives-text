# Cardinal Ruggers Head For Monterey
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The Monterey Rugby
Tournament used to be as
predictable as a World Series with
the Yankees. They could give the
trophy away before the
tournament was held. Just engrave
Stanford University on it and that
was that.
The Indians were awesome.
Until their reign was snapped in
1972 they'd run up nine wins.
Tourney organizers, tired of
lugging the trophy from the Farm
every year, finally decided to give
Stanford the trophy permanently
in *72.
But the Stanford Cardinals
have not had as much luck as the
Stanford Indians. They haven't
won the tournament since the
win streak was broken and this
year should be no different.
The Cards enter the
tournament March 22 on the heels
of their worst season in four
years. The ruggers finished 4-6
after losing the Big Scrum Axe to
California, 15-6 last Saturday.
The Big Scrum epitomized the
Stanford season. Tied 3-3 at

halftime, Cal ran off 12 points in
the first five minutes, while
holding the Cards to a penalty
kick, for the win. If the ruggers
were deadlocked at halftime this
year, you could write them off.
Stanford picked up four of its six
losses that way.
The ruggers' poor showing
might, however, be attributed to
one of the roughest schedules in
Cardinal rugby history. "We
haven't overlooked any of the
best teams in California," said
coach Pete Kmetovic. "We've
played them all." And lost to
them all.
But Card ruggers probably
won't forego the trek to Pebble
Beach for Stanford's opening
tournament contest with the
Monterey Rugby Club at 8 a.m.
on March 22.
The charm of the tournament
is its informality. Sports
Illustrated discovered that last
year when it covered the tourney.
Rugger huggers can amuse
themselves by playing Adam and
Eve on the comfortable front
lawns of the Pebble Beach homes,
as one couple did last year,
you miss streakers on the Farm,
don't dispare. They've been
streaking at the Tournament since
it was organized 19 years ago.
And there'll be plenty of rugby
players to hug. Thirty-two teams,
including an Australian squad,
have entered the Tournament.
They'll play three games the first
day and the top two teams will
meet in the championship game
on March 23.
What does it take to win the
tournament. "A heck of a lot of
luck," said Kmetovic, who
coached those nine tournament
winners.

every year, finally decided to give
Stanford the trophy permanently
in *72.
But the Stanford Cardinals
have not had as much luck as the
Stanford Indians. They haven't
won the tournament since the
win streak was broken and this
year should be no different.
The Cards enter the
tournament March 22 on the heels
of their worst season in four
years. The ruggers finished 4-6
after losing the Big Scrum Axe to
California, 15-6 last Saturday.
The Big Scrum epitomized the
Stanford season. Tied 3-3 at

halftime, Cal ran off 12 points in
the first five minutes, while
holding the Cards to a penalty
kick, for the win. If the ruggers
were deadlocked at halftime this
year, you could write them off.
Stanford picked up four of its six
losses that way.
The ruggers' poor showing
might, however, be attributed to
one of the roughest schedules in
Cardinal rugby history. "We
haven't overlooked any of the
best teams in California," said
coach Pete Kmetovic. "We've
played them all." And lost to
them all.
But Card ruggers probably
won't forego the trek to Pebble
Beach for Stanford's opening
tournament contest with the
Monterey Rugby Club at 8 a.m.
on March 22.
The charm of the tournament
is its informality. Sports
Illustrated discovered that last
year when it covered the tourney.
Rugger huggers can amuse
themselves by playing Adam and
Eve on the comfortable front
lawns of the Pebble Beach homes,
as one couple did last year,
you miss streakers on the Farm,
don't dispare. They've been
streaking at the Tournament since
it was organized 19 years ago.
And there'll be plenty of rugby
players to hug. Thirty-two teams,
including an Australian squad,
have entered the Tournament.
They'll play three games the first
day and the top two teams will
meet in the championship game
on March 23.
What does it take to win the
tournament. "A heck of a lot of
luck," said Kmetovic, who
coached those nine tournament
winners.
The Monterey Rugby
Tournament used to be as
predictable as a World Series with
the Yankees. They could give the
trophy away before the
tournament was held. Just engrave
Stanford University on it and that
was that.
The Indians were awesome.
Until their reign was snapped in
1972 they'd run up nine wins.
Tourney organizers, tired of
lugging the trophy from the Farm
every year, finally decided to give
Stanford the trophy permanently
in *72.
