# Journalism Enrollees Up With Muddled Job Picture
## 
### DREW KEELING 
Concerned over poor job prospects
in other fields and inspired by the role
of the press in uncovering Watergate,
university students throughout the
country are enrolling in unprecedented
numbers in journalism courses.
The surge of interest here in
journalism is causing problems for the
Communication Department where
many classes are becoming difficult to
get into and where faculty workload is
"two or three" times the University
average.
The trend began about four years
ago, according to Asst. Communication
Prof. Don Dodson, as a result of
"increasing student political awareness
arising out of the political troubles of
the late 19605."
Dodson added that Watergate has
had the effect of furthering a
"romantic and somewhat unrealistic
image" of journalism as a career.
Practical concerns over the scarcity
of jobs for liberal arts majors has also

influenced students toward journalism.
Communication Department Chairman
Lyle Nelson cites the desire among
students for basic communication
skills as a factor, pointing out that
enrollment in film and broadcasting
classes has risen also.
Edwin Bayley, dean of the
Journalism School at UC-Berkeley,
acknowledges the impact of Watergate,
particularly among undergraduates
whose applications frequently mention
Washington Post reporters Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein, but
stresses more long-range factors.
"It really goes back to the Ph.L).
glut of several years ago," he said.
"Students today want to get a grip on
life, and journalism plunges them into
public affairs."
Bayley foresees a leveling off of
interest in journalism as the growing
numbers of journalism students face
an increasingly competitive job
market.
