# Birth Control 'Same As Any Other Need'
## 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
"We consider contraception to be the same as
any other need served, so it is available to any
student on request," says Dr. James B. McClenahan,
director of the student health service. He said that
Cowell offers contraceptive counseling with doctors
or specially-trained students, abortion counseling
and referral, and contraceptive examinations, free to
all students.
The potentially delicate topic of birth control is
handled matter-of-factly. "The first thing I'll try to
do," says Dr. John Dorman, "is ask them [the
patients] a few questions to find out if there's some
reason they should not use a particular method.
Another preliminary' thing is to find out what kind
of situation they're in to see what they'll need. If a
girl lives in Boston and only sees her boyfriend at
the end of each quarter they might not want the pill
or the lUD. Then I try to get an idea of what their
preferences are. I'll try to cover the other methods
and pros and cons of each one."
230 To 280 Appointments
Dorman, a nurse practitioner and two half-time
doctors handle some 230 to 280 appointments each
month dealing with contraception. Sixteen peer
counselors, trained last year through a SWOPSI
course, deal with about 20 students per week. Next
quarter the SWOPSI course will train an additional
20 counselors.
Cowell's program was considered revolutionary
when it started in 1968. "When we first started the
policy," says McClenahan, "there was some
concern though even at that time, less than we
expected [that] we were promoting promiscuity."

Cowell's records cannot be used to estimate
contraception use on campus. But a study by Dr.
Warren Miller, monitoring the behavior of a sample
of students from 1971 to 1973, indicated that 70
percent of the men and 86 percent of the women
were sexually active during three and one quarter
years here.
Of these, 47 percent of the men and 37 percent
of the women had some unprotected intercourse.
Pill Widespread
The pill was the most widespread contraceptive
method. Between 46 percent of the sexually active
freshman males and 83 percent of the senior males
relied on it at some time.
This same study indicated 9.5 percent of the
sexually active women became pregnant as students
here, all of whom had abortions. McClenahan
estimated that of roughly 70 pregnant women per
year, Cowell counsels 25 to 35 and refers them to
area facilities. Blue Cross will cover an abortion.
"We do consider it appropriate to consider abortion
as any other unexpected condition," said
McClenahan. "There has been an improvement.
People used to have to go to Japan or Sweden or
Mexico and some people did that. Most of the
women who have an unplanned pregnancy, that we
see, go ahead and have an abortion. Some students,
I think, would go home and you wouldn't see
them."
Complications
Because of the moral and social complications of
contraception, the Cowell staff handles it with
special care. "One of our basic premises is that we
don't provide answers," said Susie Philips, teacher

of the SWOPSI counseling course. "The best we can
do is help provide an informed decision. We're
certainly not here to advocate sex, or not advocate
it. We're completely neutral on that. We want to act
as an informal sounding board."
While admitting the level of awareness among
students is relatively high, the peer counselors
maintain an outreach program to get birth control
information into the dorms.
"Usually at the outreach program more men
hang around and ask questions because usually
women have already had to think about it," said
Philips. "Most of the people we counsel here are
women, though we'd like to encourage men to
come. We think it would be nice if it wasn't just the
women's responsibility."
Impact
It is hard to judge the impact of the
contraception program. As Dorman pointed out,
"One thing we really don't know is how effective
we're being. One measure is how many abortions
there are, but that's only the denominator, the bad
experience. The numerator, how many sexual
encounters are going on, is something we don't
know.
"Some people," continued Dorman, "would
argue that because of your contraception program
you're making it easier for people to have
intercourse. It's really difficult to make an objective
analysis. I think most people here feel students are
going to have intercourse anyway and we want to
minimize the number of unwanted pregnancies and
bad experiences."
