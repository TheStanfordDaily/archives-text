The administration's decision to eliminate 600 parking
spaces by the Roble Gymnasium and another 35 on Lomita
Drive between Panama and Santa Teresa Sts. is yet another
example of a decision made without consulting the people it
affects most.
Elimination of these spaces (which are all filled every
weekday) will magnify the University's parking shortage by
hundreds. While planners estimate that there are enough
spaces near the Communication Department to accomodate
the additional cars, we wonder if that will long be true in an
area of the campus which is being developed rapidly.
If the 35 Lomita spaces are also eliminated, as is
tenatively planned, delivery access to the Storke Student
Publications Building will be completely shut off. In
addition, Storke business persons estimate that walk-in
advertising sales will be significantly hurt by the elimination
of parking near the building.
This elimination of parking spaces also creates a severe
safety hazard for those who work at the Storke building and
nearby buildings late at night.
The very least the administration should do at this point
is abandon its plans to replace the 35 spaces on Lomita with
a grassy mall. Furthermore, a number of these spaces should
be reserved for Storke business to prevent unmanageable
overcrowding. Such a move will at least continue to permit
access to the Storke Building both for deliveries and
advertisers.
We once again urge the administration to consult with
those most affected by administrative decisions before, not
after, such decisions are implemented. But judging by the
administration's past performance, we are not at all
optimistic.
