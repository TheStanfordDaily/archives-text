# Moynihan Selection Blasted
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Anthropology Department faculty
members and graduate students have
joined more than 60 black seniors in
condemning the Univeristy's decision
to invite Harvard Prof. Daniel P.
Moynihan as commencement speaker.
At a press conference March 13,
former ASSU Vice President Charles
Ogletree declared, "We find this choice
repulsive, insulting and derogatory — a
direct slap in the face."
A statement signed by all but seven
graduating black seniors called
Moynihan "a person... not
acceptable to either the Black
community or the more thoughtful
sectors of other ethnic communities."
The statement charged that
Moynihan's wiitings have falsely
blamed "the breakdown of the Negro
family" for the problems of black
\merica. This analysis led to his
controversial recommendation in 1970
that the "issue of race" required a
period of "benign negledt" in this
country, according to the statement.
Drake Attacks Selection
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake,
who joined 20 other prominent
scholars and politicians in protesting
Moynihan's original "benign neglect"
statement in 1970, attacked the
method currently used to select the
commencement speaker.
He argued that blacks should have
been consulted during the selection
process, because "the only claim to
fame Moynihan has comes from these
faux pas involving blacks." Drake also

contended that the selection panel
should have included faculty members.
He agreed with the black students'
assertion that "Moynihan's claim to be
a social scientist and to be an expert
on the dynamics of The Negro Family,
and on the cause and cure of black
poverty, is a very dubious claim." The
Negro Family is the title of
Moynihan's controversial report on the
race problem during the Nixon
Administration.
Anthro Faculty Statement
Drake and 11 of the other 14
Anthropology Department faculty
members currently in residence signed

a document similar to that prepared
by the seniors. But the faculty
members charged "Moynihan is
neither a sociologist nor an
anthropologist and has done no
research on the Black community."
The statement added that "as a
result of the publicity
surrounding .. . the publication of The
Negro Family, Moynihan emerged as
an instant expert on Black affairs."
Some 23 of 30 graduate students in
anthropology signed a statement
calling the selection "an affront to us
as anthropologists and to all sensitive


PARKING PLAN — A report from Asst. Vice President for Medical Affairs Peter Carpenter recommends three principal
parking zones. Vehicles could park at no charge in the "Free Zone." It would cost $12 per quarter to park in the
Residence Zone" surrounding student residences, and $15 per quarter in the "Academic Zone" within the central
campus. The Committee on Land and Building Development will now discuss the report's recommendations.
people as well as to the black
community." The graduate students
attacked Moynihan's scholarship,
noting:
"It has long been accepted that
honest disagreement about the
implications of social science leads to
healthy academic and political
discussion.
"We believe, however, that those
who profess to be scientists must have
high academic standards about quality
of work, and must have absolute
standards about the implications of
their work. The career which has made
Daniel Moynihan famous is below our
standards on both counts."
But Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert M. Rosenzweig
contended that Moynihan's career has
encompassed other areas, noting that
he played a key role in persuading the
Nixon Administration to advocate a
guaranteed minimum income plan.
Rosenzweig agreed with Drake that
faculty members should be included
on future selection panels. However,
he stated that the University does not
to withdraw the invitation, which
Moynihan has accepted.
Drake explained that although he
questioned "the wisdom of his
invitation," he did not think "an
invitation should be withdrawn once it
has been made or that he should be
hassled, heckled or insulted." He
added that he does not plan to attend
the ceremonies.
Protest organizers noted that
although several students may boycott

Rosenzweig agreed with Drake that
faculty members should be included

he stated that the University does not

Moynihan has accepted.
Drake explained that although he
questioned "the wisdom of his

hassled, heckled or insulted." He

Anthropology Department faculty
members and graduate students have
joined more than 60 black seniors in
condemning the Univeristy's decision
to invite Harvard Prof. Daniel P.
Moynihan as commencement speaker.
At a press conference March 13,
former ASSU Vice President Charles
Ogletree declared, "We find this choice
repulsive, insulting and derogatory — a
direct slap in the face."
A statement signed by all but seven
graduating black seniors called
Moynihan "a person... not
acceptable to either the Black
community or the more thoughtful
sectors of other ethnic communities."
The statement charged that
Moynihan's wiitings have falsely
blamed "the breakdown of the Negro
family" for the problems of black
\merica. This analysis led to his
controversial recommendation in 1970
that the "issue of race" required a
period of "benign negledt" in this
country, according to the statement.
Drake Attacks Selection
Anthropology Prof. St. Clair Drake,
who joined 20 other prominent
scholars and politicians in protesting
Moynihan's original "benign neglect"
statement in 1970, attacked the
method currently used to select the
commencement speaker.
He argued that blacks should have
been consulted during the selection
process, because "the only claim to
fame Moynihan has comes from these
faux pas involving blacks." Drake also

contended that the selection panel
should have included faculty members.
He agreed with the black students'
assertion that "Moynihan's claim to be
a social scientist and to be an expert
on the dynamics of The Negro Family,
and on the cause and cure of black
poverty, is a very dubious claim." The
Negro Family is the title of
Moynihan's controversial report on the
race problem during the Nixon
Administration.
Anthro Faculty Statement
Drake and 11 of the other 14
Anthropology Department faculty
members currently in residence signed

a document similar to that prepared
by the seniors. But the faculty
members charged "Moynihan is
neither a sociologist nor an
anthropologist and has done no
research on the Black community."
The statement added that "as a
result of the publicity
surrounding .. . the publication of The
Negro Family, Moynihan emerged as
an instant expert on Black affairs."
Some 23 of 30 graduate students in
anthropology signed a statement
calling the selection "an affront to us
