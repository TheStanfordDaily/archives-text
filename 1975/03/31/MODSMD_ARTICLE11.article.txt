# Veterans' Benefits-Wasteful, Unjust
## 
### William Ross 
Unfortunately, veterans' benefits are
sacrosanct to most Americans. Scarcely
anyone seems to object to lavishing billions
of tax dollars each year on the nation's
retired cannon fodder.
Right-wingers generally extol military
virtme and thus favor veterans' benefits.
Leftists may derogate the Pentagon, but
they advocate pampering the nation's
veterans, viewing them as innocent pawns of
the military establishment. Populists, despite
their ambivalent attitude toward the military,
defend the "little men" who fought the
nation's wars.
It is high time, however, that Americans
abandon old shibboleths about veterans and
question the fairness, morality and economic
wisdom of giving benefits to them.
Unjust System
The existing system of veterans' benefits
is, in short, grossly unjust to non-veterans
and economically unnecessary if not
unsound. The government ought to reduce
such benefits by at least 90 percent.
Benefits to veterans blatantly discriminate
against non-veterans. Special loans to
veterans for the purchase of homes and the
loaning of money to them at low interest, for
example, clearly place non-veterans at an
economic disadvantage.
A host of educational and medical
privileges extended to veterans — and even to
their offspring — give veterans unfair
advantages over non-veterans.
Pensions Bloated
One of the worst abuses of the veteran
benefit system is the bloated pensions that
veterans receive. Since soldiers got salaries
while on the military service, it seems
unnecessary to give them large pensions. A
person working in a civilian occupation for a
comparable length of time certainly would
not receive such a large pension.
Lifetime military pensions extend long
past the time when veterans have recovered
from their military experiences. This drains

the commonweal to an extent that is — to
use veteran jargon — unpatriotic.
The traditional argument that veterans
provided a crucial service to Americans and
therefore deserve special treatment is
fallacious.
World War I veterans — who still receive
millions of dollars in aid — are deluding
themselves if they believe that the Kaiser
wanted to conquer and subjugate the United
States. World War II vets have a better claim
to having defended the nation, but they
cannot prove that American neutrality would
have precipitated the nation's downfall. The
Korean and Vietnam wars were almost
certainly superfluous from the standpoint of
national security.

Another worthless argument in favor of
veterans' benefits is that the men who fought
the nation's wars should receive benefits even
if American policy was awry since they
didn't make policy.
This argument ignores the fact that the
nation's tragic interventions in Korea and
Vietnam could not have occurred without
the cooperation of American soldiers. The
nation's leaders did what the people generally
wanted. Besides, the soldiers at the front saw
the uselessness of the wars before their
leaders recognized it.
Therefore, for example, I have more
respect for the memory of Lyndon Johnson
than for the men who served in Vietnam.

And those soldiers who never fought in a
war never endangered their lives, so they
certainly don't deserve benefits by any
conceivable logic.
Some Advantages
A few veterans' programs — such as those
helping men find civilian jobs and caring for
people severely disabled in action — are
worthy of retention. The rest, however,
ought to be abolished.
The nation's budget for fiscal 1974
allocated $11.7 billion to veteran benefits. If
this amount were greatly reduced:
—taxes could be cut, thereby increasing
the spending power of all taxpayers and
stimulating the recession-ridden economy;
—the nation's annual deficit could be
reduced;
—increased amounts of money could be
allocated to federal health and education
programs (further counterbalancing any
contractual effects that loss of veteran
benefits might have on the economy);
Aid U.S. Image
—the government could demonstrate
genuine contrition for its misdeeds in Asia by
spending part of its money on hospitals to
care for Asian civilians injured by American
soldiers. The United States could also rebuild
towns destroyed by Americans. Aid could be
given to the children fathered throughout the
world by G.l.'s. The money thus spent could
thus help to improve the image of Americans
that our "servicemen" abroad have so helped
to tarnish.
Of course, the government will probably
never reduce veteran benefits. The veterans
are a large and politically potent group. No
politician who wanted to stay in office could
advocate reducing benefits for veterans.
Therefore it seems inevitable that veterans
will continue to expand their selfish
privileges. But more people should start
recognizing the inequity of these perquisites.
