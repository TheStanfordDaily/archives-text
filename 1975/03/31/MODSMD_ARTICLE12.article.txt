Parking Fiasco
Editor:
After having spent the better
part of an hour today looking for
a parking space in a lot assigned
for off-campus students, I'm not
sure whether to laugh or swear at
the University's inane parking
regulations. Not only do they
require that students purchase a
parking sticker, they then turn
around and give them free to
faculty and staff. This is, of
course, a well publicized fact.
But what is the rationale
behind allowing staff and faculty
to legitimately park in areas
designated for off-campus
students? If a student dares
venture into a staff or faculty lot
it's only a matter of minutes
before he/she is tagged with a
ticket for parking in the wrong
lot.
Somehow this system is
screwing the student in more ways
than one. First the student pays,
then his/her designated lot is
filled with staff cars with their
free stickers. What justice!
I'd like to have this explained
to me by those in the position of
enforcing these absurd rules. I
paid my $7.50. Now I'd like to be
guaranteed a place to park.

Janet Sanders did little justice
in her critique of Julie Steiny's
production of Stage Door (Daily,
March 7). I attended the March 6
performance, was delighted with
the play and impressed by the
audience's enthusiastic response.
I am very weary of that brand
of intellectual snobbery ("the
kind of play my father would like
to see after a hard day at the
office," "no mental effort
required") that prevents one from
enjoying something for pure fun.
Sanders also implies that the
play had no relevance for us
today. Not everyone missed the
theme of being true to oneself and
one's ideals in Stage Door.

I would like to correct an error
in the article (Daily, March 6) on
Stanford's upcoming women's
fair. In a quote attributed to
Cindy Davis, you state that
"similar events at San Jose State,
'initiated from above,' lacked
student input."
San Jose State has just
concluded its most successful
Women's Week. Speakers included
Angela Davis, Patsy Fulcher, Rita
Mae Brown, Tillie Olsen and
Shirley Zimmerman. In addition
there were panels and workshops
each day on topics such as
Women's Health Issues, Ethnic
Heritage of American Women
and Women and Men.
Contrary to what Cindy Davis
allegedly said, this week-long
program was totally organized by
students, and paid for by the
Associated Students. Neither
Women's Studies nor anyone else
"above" initiated the planning.

designated for off-campus
students? If a student dares
venture into a staff or faculty lot
it's only a matter of minutes
before he/she is tagged with a
ticket for parking in the wrong
lot.
Somehow this system is
screwing the student in more ways
than one. First the student pays,
then his/her designated lot is
filled with staff cars with their
free stickers. What justice!
I'd like to have this explained
to me by those in the position of
enforcing these absurd rules. I
paid my $7.50. Now I'd like to be
guaranteed a place to park.

Janet Sanders did little justice
in her critique of Julie Steiny's
production of Stage Door (Daily,
March 7). I attended the March 6
performance, was delighted with
the play and impressed by the
audience's enthusiastic response.
I am very weary of that brand
of intellectual snobbery ("the
kind of play my father would like
to see after a hard day at the
office," "no mental effort
required") that prevents one from
enjoying something for pure fun.
Sanders also implies that the
play had no relevance for us
today. Not everyone missed the
theme of being true to oneself and
one's ideals in Stage Door.

I would like to correct an error
in the article (Daily, March 6) on
Stanford's upcoming women's
fair. In a quote attributed to
Cindy Davis, you state that
"similar events at San Jose State,
'initiated from above,' lacked
student input."
San Jose State has just
concluded its most successful
Women's Week. Speakers included
Angela Davis, Patsy Fulcher, Rita
Mae Brown, Tillie Olsen and
Shirley Zimmerman. In addition
there were panels and workshops
each day on topics such as
Women's Health Issues, Ethnic
Heritage of American Women
and Women and Men.
Contrary to what Cindy Davis
allegedly said, this week-long
program was totally organized by
students, and paid for by the
Associated Students. Neither
Women's Studies nor anyone else
"above" initiated the planning.

After having spent the better
part of an hour today looking for
a parking space in a lot assigned
for off-campus students, I'm not
sure whether to laugh or swear at
the University's inane parking
regulations. Not only do they
require that students purchase a
parking sticker, they then turn
around and give them free to
faculty and staff. This is, of
course, a well publicized fact.
But what is the rationale
behind allowing staff and faculty
to legitimately park in areas
designated for off-campus
students? If a student dares
venture into a staff or faculty lot
it's only a matter of minutes
before he/she is tagged with a
ticket for parking in the wrong
lot.
Somehow this system is
screwing the student in more ways
than one. First the student pays,
