# A&P Committee Used As Scapegoat For Tenuring
## 
### 
I believe the undergraduate
body is receiving an unbalanced
impression of the tenure-decision
apparatus of the University
because neither the
Administration nor the
Appointments and Promotions
(A&P) Committee is in a position
to defend its actions publicly. I
write with no personal knowledge
of the Jerry Irish case, but several
years' experience on the A&P
Committee, and one year's service
on the selection committee for
the Gores Award.
The current review procedure
for tenure starts at the
department level with appraisal of
scholarship and teaching as
primary criteria for promotion.
Two levels of faculty review
follow: first, at the School level
by the A&P Committee to ensure
that comparable standards apply
to all departments in Humanities
and Sciences; then at the
University level by the Advisory
Board to ensure that comparable
quality is distributed through all
of the Schools (Law, Medicine,
Humanities and Sciences, etc.).
The Appointments and
Promotions Committee is
appointed by the Dean with
careful consideration to balance
between humanities, social
sciences, and basic sciences, and
to excellence and breadth of view
of the individual committee
members.
Criteria Used
What data are used by the A&P
Committee in judging quality in
scholarship? Letters of evaluation
written by professional peers of
the candidate the world over are

the primary means of assessment
of scholarly excellence.
Departments are supposed to ask
the recognized leaders of each
discipline to evaluate and to give a
relative ranking of the candidate.
Why not let Stanford faculty do
the evaluation instead of going to
strangers? First, because the
candidate himself or herself is
probably the ranking expert in the
given discipline at Stanford.
Second, because most of us tend
to be less than completely
objective in evaluating a person
whom we have known socially
and academically for six years.
Some argue that the A&P
Committee should not vote
against the wishes of a department
that is unanimously or largely in
favor of promoting a candidate.
Time and time again, however,
departmental faculties and
chairpersons will apparently read
a set of modest evaluations of a
candidate and then ignore the
implications of the questions
raised by voting and presenting
the case to the Dean as if the
candidate were the Second
Coming incarnate.
Because of personal
associations, of friendships
developed over the six years of
assistant professorship, and of
departmental self images that may
be unrealistic, too many such
situations arise. Add to that the
real differences in mean quality
between academic disciplines and
between departments in those
disciplines, and one should
conclude, I believe, that there
must be schoolwide and
Universitywide reviews of all

tenure cases. Otherwise,
mediocrity can perpetuate itself
indefinitely.
How does the A&P evaluate
and weigh teaching? Letters from
students and from faculty
colleagues at Stanford, and
statistical data from the various
evaluation forms are all provided
to the departmental faculties prior
to their vote, as well as to the
reviewing bodies. In general, this
data is far more complete than the
information available when the
Gores Awards are judged.
Consequently, though it may
be true in nine cases out of ten,
one cannot automatically assume
that the winner of such an award
(or equivalent externally granted
awards) is an excellent teacher by
Stanford standards operating at
the time of tenure judgement.
Interpretations and weighting
of information on teaching is the
most difficult part of the tenure
evaluation procedure. The reason
is that few agree on what
constitutes good and effective
teaching. Virtually every
candidate will have at least a few
students say: "this faculty
member has influenced me most
and been the best teacher I have
experienced at Stanford." But
that same faculty member may
have low statistical ratings, or may
even be irresponsible in the eyes
of many other students. Too
often advising, personal
acquaintanceship and interest,
long office hours, and such things
are equated with good teaching.
Perhaps such forms of personal
contact between a candidate and
students are a form of teaching if

one subscribes to the
"whole-person" philosophy of
the university education;
but they are largely irrelevant
issues if one's view of the
university is that education
primarily involves the intellect of
students. I suspect that one source
of misunderstanding is that most
students hold the first view, while
most members of reviewing
committees hold the latter view.
Fair Consideration
Assuming, then, that the A&P
reviews teaching credentials and
that its members have some
personal or group philosophy
about relevance and irrelevance,
good and bad in teaching, what
assurance is there that fair weight
is given to teaching in the final
tenure equation? Only pleas from
past committee members, past
Deans, and departments that have
had pertinent cases can establish
an answer.
During my time on A&P at
least one good researcher was
denied tenure because of shoddy
teaching; many mediocre
researchers were denied tenure
because of average to good
teaching; and at least one or two
excellent teachers, but
questionable scholars, were
promoted. But here again, one
cannot name names to prove the
points. During judgment of those
cases it is fair to say that true
excellence in teaching had to be
demonstrated if that ability were
to compensate for lackluster
scholarship....
The A&P Committee is asked
to make a subjective guess, a
probability statement that

scholarship and innovative,
exciting teaching will be the core
of a person's professional career.
Mistakes are expensive. Students
of subsequent generations pay the
price for mistakes.
So, under such circumstances, I
believe it better to err on the side
of the University and not on the
side of the individual. It is not
heartless to say that there are
enough young people who are

Norman Wessells

truly outstanding in both teaching
and research that we do not have
to take chances when deficiencies
exist in either category. That is a
tough position, for the human
tragedy can be great. But the
tragedy of mistakes to the
University and its future students
is just as great.

Department.)

relative ranking of the candidate.
Why not let Stanford faculty do
the evaluation instead of going to
strangers? First, because the
candidate himself or herself is
probably the ranking expert in the
given discipline at Stanford.
Second, because most of us tend
to be less than completely
objective in evaluating a person
whom we have known socially
and academically for six years.
Some argue that the A&P
Committee should not vote
against the wishes of a department
that is unanimously or largely in
favor of promoting a candidate.
Time and time again, however,
departmental faculties and
chairpersons will apparently read
a set of modest evaluations of a
candidate and then ignore the
implications of the questions
raised by voting and presenting
the case to the Dean as if the
candidate were the Second
Coming incarnate.
Because of personal
associations, of friendships
developed over the six years of
assistant professorship, and of
departmental self images that may
be unrealistic, too many such
situations arise. Add to that the
real differences in mean quality
between academic disciplines and
between departments in those
disciplines, and one should
conclude, I believe, that there
must be schoolwide and
Universitywide reviews of all

tenure cases. Otherwise,
mediocrity can perpetuate itself
indefinitely.
How does the A&P evaluate
and weigh teaching? Letters from
students and from faculty
colleagues at Stanford, and
statistical data from the various
evaluation forms are all provided
to the departmental faculties prior
to their vote, as well as to the
reviewing bodies. In general, this
data is far more complete than the
information available when the
Gores Awards are judged.
Consequently, though it may
be true in nine cases out of ten,
one cannot automatically assume
that the winner of such an award
(or equivalent externally granted
awards) is an excellent teacher by
Stanford standards operating at
the time of tenure judgement.
Interpretations and weighting
of information on teaching is the
most difficult part of the tenure
evaluation procedure. The reason
is that few agree on what
constitutes good and effective
teaching. Virtually every
candidate will have at least a few
students say: "this faculty
member has influenced me most
and been the best teacher I have
experienced at Stanford." But
that same faculty member may
have low statistical ratings, or may
even be irresponsible in the eyes
of many other students. Too
often advising, personal
acquaintanceship and interest,
long office hours, and such things
are equated with good teaching.
Perhaps such forms of personal
contact between a candidate and
students are a form of teaching if

one subscribes to the
"whole-person" philosophy of
the university education;
but they are largely irrelevant
issues if one's view of the
university is that education
primarily involves the intellect of
students. I suspect that one source
of misunderstanding is that most
students hold the first view, while
most members of reviewing
committees hold the latter view.
Fair Consideration
Assuming, then, that the A&P
reviews teaching credentials and
that its members have some
personal or group philosophy
about relevance and irrelevance,
good and bad in teaching, what
assurance is there that fair weight
is given to teaching in the final
tenure equation? Only pleas from
past committee members, past
Deans, and departments that have
had pertinent cases can establish
an answer.
During my time on A&P at
least one good researcher was
denied tenure because of shoddy
teaching; many mediocre
researchers were denied tenure
because of average to good
teaching; and at least one or two
excellent teachers, but
questionable scholars, were
promoted. But here again, one
cannot name names to prove the
points. During judgment of those
cases it is fair to say that true
excellence in teaching had to be
demonstrated if that ability were
to compensate for lackluster
scholarship....
The A&P Committee is asked
to make a subjective guess, a
probability statement that

scholarship and innovative,
exciting teaching will be the core
of a person's professional career.
Mistakes are expensive. Students
of subsequent generations pay the
price for mistakes.
So, under such circumstances, I
believe it better to err on the side
of the University and not on the
side of the individual. It is not
heartless to say that there are
enough young people who are

Norman Wessells

truly outstanding in both teaching
and research that we do not have
to take chances when deficiencies
exist in either category. That is a
tough position, for the human
tragedy can be great. But the
tragedy of mistakes to the
University and its future students
is just as great.
(Norman Wessells is chairman of
the Biological Sciences
Department.)
I believe the undergraduate
body is receiving an unbalanced
impression of the tenure-decision
apparatus of the University
because neither the
Administration nor the
Appointments and Promotions
(A&P) Committee is in a position
to defend its actions publicly. I
write with no personal knowledge
of the Jerry Irish case, but several
years' experience on the A&P
Committee, and one year's service
on the selection committee for
the Gores Award.
The current review procedure
for tenure starts at the
department level with appraisal of
scholarship and teaching as
primary criteria for promotion.
Two levels of faculty review

that comparable standards apply
to all departments in Humanities
and Sciences; then at the
University level by the Advisory
Board to ensure that comparable
quality is distributed through all
of the Schools (Law, Medicine,
Humanities and Sciences, etc.).

careful consideration to balance
between humanities, social
sciences, and basic sciences, and
to excellence and breadth of view
of the individual committee
members.

reviewing bodies. In general, this
data is far more complete than the
information available when the
Gores Awards are judged.
Consequently, though it may
be true in nine cases out of ten,
one cannot automatically assume
that the winner of such an award
(or equivalent externally granted
awards) is an excellent teacher by
Stanford standards operating at
the time of tenure judgement.
Interpretations and weighting
of information on teaching is the
most difficult part of the tenure
evaluation procedure. The reason
is that few agree on what
constitutes good and effective
teaching. Virtually every
candidate will have at least a few
students say: "this faculty
member has influenced me most
and been the best teacher I have
experienced at Stanford." But
that same faculty member may
have low statistical ratings, or may
even be irresponsible in the eyes
of many other students. Too
often advising, personal
acquaintanceship and interest,
long office hours, and such things
are equated with good teaching.
Perhaps such forms of personal
contact between a candidate and
students are a form of teaching if

one subscribes to the
"whole-person" philosophy of
the university education;
but they are largely irrelevant
issues if one's view of the
university is that education
primarily involves the intellect of
students. I suspect that one source
of misunderstanding is that most
students hold the first view, while
most members of reviewing
committees hold the latter view.
Fair Consideration
Assuming, then, that the A&P
reviews teaching credentials and
that its members have some
personal or group philosophy
about relevance and irrelevance,
good and bad in teaching, what
assurance is there that fair weight
is given to teaching in the final
tenure equation? Only pleas from
past committee members, past
Deans, and departments that have
had pertinent cases can establish
an answer.
During my time on A&P at
least one good researcher was
denied tenure because of shoddy
teaching; many mediocre
researchers were denied tenure
because of average to good
teaching; and at least one or two
excellent teachers, but
questionable scholars, were
promoted. But here again, one
cannot name names to prove the
points. During judgment of those
cases it is fair to say that true
excellence in teaching had to be
demonstrated if that ability were
to compensate for lackluster
scholarship....
The A&P Committee is asked
to make a subjective guess, a
probability statement that

scholarship and innovative,
exciting teaching will be the core
of a person's professional career.
Mistakes are expensive. Students
of subsequent generations pay the
price for mistakes.
So, under such circumstances, I
believe it better to err on the side
of the University and not on the
side of the individual. It is not
heartless to say that there are
enough young people who are

Norman Wessells

truly outstanding in both teaching
and research that we do not have
to take chances when deficiencies
exist in either category. That is a
tough position, for the human
tragedy can be great. But the
tragedy of mistakes to the
University and its future students
is just as great.
(Norman Wessells is chairman of
the Biological Sciences
Department.)
I believe the undergraduate
body is receiving an unbalanced
impression of the tenure-decision
apparatus of the University
because neither the
Administration nor the
Appointments and Promotions
(A&P) Committee is in a position
to defend its actions publicly. I
write with no personal knowledge
of the Jerry Irish case, but several
years' experience on the A&P
Committee, and one year's service
on the selection committee for
the Gores Award.
The current review procedure
for tenure starts at the
department level with appraisal of
scholarship and teaching as
primary criteria for promotion.
Two levels of faculty review
follow: first, at the School level
by the A&P Committee to ensure
that comparable standards apply
to all departments in Humanities
and Sciences; then at the
University level by the Advisory
Board to ensure that comparable
quality is distributed through all
of the Schools (Law, Medicine,
Humanities and Sciences, etc.).
The Appointments and
Promotions Committee is
appointed by the Dean with
careful consideration to balance
between humanities, social
sciences, and basic sciences, and
to excellence and breadth of view
of the individual committee
members.
Criteria Used
What data are used by the A&P
Committee in judging quality in
scholarship? Letters of evaluation
written by professional peers of
the candidate the world over are

the primary means of assessment
of scholarly excellence.
Departments are supposed to ask
the recognized leaders of each
discipline to evaluate and to give a
relative ranking of the candidate.
Why not let Stanford faculty do
the evaluation instead of going to
strangers? First, because the
candidate himself or herself is
probably the ranking expert in the
given discipline at Stanford.
Second, because most of us tend
to be less than completely
objective in evaluating a person
whom we have known socially
and academically for six years.
Some argue that the A&P
Committee should not vote
against the wishes of a department
that is unanimously or largely in
favor of promoting a candidate.
Time and time again, however,
departmental faculties and
chairpersons will apparently read
a set of modest evaluations of a
candidate and then ignore the
implications of the questions
raised by voting and presenting
the case to the Dean as if the
candidate were the Second
Coming incarnate.
Because of personal
associations, of friendships
developed over the six years of
assistant professorship, and of
departmental self images that may
be unrealistic, too many such
situations arise. Add to that the
real differences in mean quality
between academic disciplines and
between departments in those
disciplines, and one should
conclude, I believe, that there
must be schoolwide and
Universitywide reviews of all

tenure cases. Otherwise,
mediocrity can perpetuate itself
indefinitely.
How does the A&P evaluate
and weigh teaching? Letters from
students and from faculty
colleagues at Stanford, and
statistical data from the various
evaluation forms are all provided
to the departmental faculties prior
to their vote, as well as to the
reviewing bodies. In general, this
data is far more complete than the
information available when the
Gores Awards are judged.
