## Students Volunteer Services To Help Children Feel Special 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
Last Saturday, sophomore
Alfred Guzman "coerced" a
friend into lending him a
ten-speed, peddled to Mountain
View and took nine-year-old Mark
Hirschbeck out to the park.
They got some sizeable whacks
off a bat because they were using
a tennis ball, floated a frisbee
around, then sat down on the
grass to decide what to do next.
Guzman had admonished Mark
beforehand to "set up something
we can waste our time on."
If Mark and Guzman are
related, it's through Social
Advocates for Youth (SAY), a
Mountain View-based program
that resembles Big Brother and
Big Sister except that it doesn't
cater exclusively to children who
don't have fathers at home.
Eleven Stanford people are
currently enlisted in the effort,
nine of them students who
happened upon it through
Psychology 184, a class in
para professionalism. Getting
credit "legitimizes a good time,"
in volunteer Teresa Jenkins'
words.
Welcomes Volunteers
But the program welcomes
recruits from any background
who wish to give a child between
the ages of six and 16 a second
chance before he needs one.
"I don't like the word
predelinquent," says director
Debra Manchester, a Stanford
psychology alumna. "Only a small
proportion of the children we deal
with come to the attention of
authorities.
"Instead, they're what we call
the 'identified patient.' The
family's problems seem to be
focused in this one person, and
everybody has a vested interest in
keeping them there.
"If Billy is always 'bad' or
'stupid,' mom and dad don't have
to look at their marriage crises.
The other kids like the status quo,
too, because then 'Mom won't get
mad at me.' "
As a result, says Manchester,
the scapegoat withdraws, or
becomes hyperactive and
troublesome.
Six Branches
Children usually come to
SAY's attention through teacher,
social worker or parent referrals.
Founded five years ago by a
lawyer who retired to devote all
his energies to it, SAY now has six
branches, the next nearest- in
Santa Barbara.
Mountain View's center placed
64 children last year, 32 of those
matches ongoing, and eight in the
past two weeks. Manchester waves
a list of names alluringly.
SAY matches child and
volunteer carefully. Center
officials and advisers meet with all
the significant people in a child's
life, with the child and with his
prospective advocate in training
sessions before introducing the
duo.
Lack Of Pressure
"A really positive aspect is that
SAY only works with kids who
want to do it,"says Jenkins.
First meetings can be fraught
with nervousness, but the program
seems characterized by a general
lack of pressure. There is one
commitment: nine months of
three-to-four-hour weekly visits.
Otherwise, officials warn
volunteers not to overextend
themselves. "If you start out all
revved up, seeing a kid three times
a week for a day at a time, he'll
feel rejected when you want to
wind down," explains Manchester.
SAY aims for consistency, and
not too great an output on the
part of either volunteer or youth.
The Center encourages teams
not to spend money, for instance.
As in the "good old days" when
families and courting couples
drummed up free fun, volunteers
and kids alike enjoy having their
ingenuity taxed. "I'm having to
rediscover the Bay Area!"
enthuses Guzman.
SAY also warns volunteers not

to expect their charges to iron out
their problems in a month or to
become intimate confidantes.
Yet for all its naturalness, SAY
offers something subtly
important, Manchester feels.
"Sometimes, giving a child an
advocate is the one thing that
makes him different from anyone
else and that makes him special,"
she says.
"It can be the only thing in
their lives they've got going.
Everybody else in the family is
saying how dumb or wild or bad
they are, and an advocate is their
one glimmer of hope."
Looking back on a year of
lofting frisbees, partying at the
beach and camping with
13-year-old Bunny Mac Lean, Sue
Garrison thinks she's seen that
effect.
Not So Easy
"It wasn't as easy as I thought
it would be and I didn't get a lot
of feedback," says the Stanford
wife and ecology major at San
Francisco State.
"Bunny is quiet, and it's hard
to get to be friends on a
one-a-week planned basis. She's
had a lot of tough times, her
parents getting divorced and her
mother remarrying.
"But I think that since I've
started coming around, Bunny's
parents have taken a different
attitude toward her because
someone else is really showing an
interest."
The program can offer as much
relief to a parent — "and it's
gratis," says Manchester, — as a
regular babysitter, though in a few
cases it may hardly make a dent.
One mother laments that SAY
doesn't take much of a load off
her shoulders because it's not
oriented toward the toddler
bracket, still well represented in
her household.
Usually, the kids involved
aren't very articulate about their
reactions. They see their
advocates as friends, not parental
or fraternal figures, and comment
mainly on activities.
'Loves The Lake'
Mark Hirschbeck "loves going
to Stanford, staying overnight,
meeting students. He likes them
all, and he loves the lake,"
according to Guzman.
But talk to Mark himself, and
when he's not joking around with
Guzman or collapsing into giggles
over baseball diamond antics, he
describes their times and
relationship as "nice."
Mark recalls his introduction to
Alfred. "I didn't know what to
say, so I said, 'Hi!'" Guzman
allows that that was a reasonable
enough beginning.
Hard Part
The hard part comes in phasing
out a volunteer's commitment,
according to Manchester. Many
advocates continue beyond nine
months, but even if they don't,
they usually maintain a long
contact, she says.
"They often tell me they can't
imagine ever losing touch with
their kids." Garrison worries a bit
about soon terminating her formal
liaison with Bunny, but she thinks
it's already happening naturally.
"Bunny seems more busy, she
always has friends over," she
notes.
Bunny explains that
phenomenon herself. "I've
changed," she says.
"I get along with myself a lot
better now — Susan got me to. I
always felt like being alone, and I
fought with my brothers and
sisters. But with Susan, I got out,
had fun, met people my own age.
"I got used to my brothers and
sisters and I started to talk to
them without fighting. Since I
met Susan, I have a lot of my own
friends."
