# Millionaire Says 'You Can Too'
## 
### KIM NYEGAARD 
For as long as can be
remembered the dream of
becoming a millionaire has
enthralled Americans. Perhaps
more than any other measure of a
man, the millionaire has long been
America's symbol of success, and
millions have long sought this
ultimate notoriety.
But today, in a time clouded
with recession, inflation and
perhaps depression, the age-old
dream of becoming a millionaire is
fading away. Americans are now
more concerned with their next
meal than their next million, and
dreams of riches are being
abandoned for dreams of survival.
Yet, amidst all this pessimism,
one William Nickerson points out
that "There are more millionaires
in the United States now than
there have ever been in our
history. Never has the time been
so right."
Millionaire Tells All
William Nickerson is part of
that American dream of success.
A self-made millionaire and the
author of three books including,
How I Turned $1000 into Three
Million in Real Estate in My Spare
Time, Nickerson points out that
the time is always right for a deal.
"Anybody with ambition and
good judgment can become a
millionaire," he says, and
emphasizes that the United States
just needs ambitious, hardworking
p?ople to keep the economy
moving and the money flowing.
Telephone Worker
As a Pacific Telephone worker
for nearly 20 years, Nickerson
points out that he was always
looking towards the future.
During his spare time he built his
"nest egg" which after a few years
of saving totaled $1000.
Through careful planning and
good judgment he would buy
one house, renovate it, and then
resell it. He started with small
houses and for every
"improvement dollar" he
invested, he would sell the house

for twice that dollar, added to the
original price of purchase.
In time he was buying more
expensive houses, duplexes, and
then small apartment complexes
followed by larger ones. This
theory of buying and selling is
known as the "geometric
progression theory," or
"pyramiding."
Takes Twenty Years
As easy as it may seem,
Nickerson doesn't want people to
think that getting rich is easy or
quick. He stresses that potential
investors should realistically allow
themselves "at least 20 years by
my theory."
But a main point which
Nickerson emphasizes is that even
during bad times a strong will can

find a way.
"The publishing companies in
New York all thought my ideas
were great until they consulted a
group of stock brokers on Wall
Street who believed my theories
too liberal.
"Eventually one publishing
house consulted a group of real
estate brokers who claimed my
practices were too conservative.
But," he adds, "they published
the book."
The lesson, Nickerson claims, is
not to let other people defeat
you. As evidence to this, he
humbly adds, "By the way —
some of those stockbrokers have
been put out of business in the
current economy and I have more
property than I can handle."

man, the millionaire has long been
America's symbol of success, and
millions have long sought this
ultimate notoriety.
But today, in a time clouded
with recession, inflation and
perhaps depression, the age-old
dream of becoming a millionaire is
fading away. Americans are now
more concerned with their next
meal than their next million, and
dreams of riches are being
abandoned for dreams of survival.
Yet, amidst all this pessimism,
one William Nickerson points out
that "There are more millionaires
in the United States now than
there have ever been in our
history. Never has the time been
so right."
Millionaire Tells All
William Nickerson is part of
that American dream of success.
A self-made millionaire and the
author of three books including,
How I Turned $1000 into Three
Million in Real Estate in My Spare
Time, Nickerson points out that
the time is always right for a deal.
"Anybody with ambition and
good judgment can become a
millionaire," he says, and
emphasizes that the United States
just needs ambitious, hardworking
p?ople to keep the economy
moving and the money flowing.
Telephone Worker
As a Pacific Telephone worker
for nearly 20 years, Nickerson
points out that he was always
looking towards the future.
During his spare time he built his
"nest egg" which after a few years
of saving totaled $1000.
Through careful planning and
good judgment he would buy
one house, renovate it, and then
resell it. He started with small
houses and for every
"improvement dollar" he
invested, he would sell the house

for twice that dollar, added to the
original price of purchase.
In time he was buying more
expensive houses, duplexes, and
then small apartment complexes
followed by larger ones. This
theory of buying and selling is
known as the "geometric
progression theory," or
"pyramiding."
Takes Twenty Years
As easy as it may seem,
Nickerson doesn't want people to
think that getting rich is easy or
quick. He stresses that potential
investors should realistically allow
themselves "at least 20 years by
my theory."
But a main point which
Nickerson emphasizes is that even
during bad times a strong will can

find a way.
"The publishing companies in
New York all thought my ideas
were great until they consulted a
group of stock brokers on Wall
Street who believed my theories
too liberal.
"Eventually one publishing
house consulted a group of real
estate brokers who claimed my
practices were too conservative.
But," he adds, "they published
the book."
The lesson, Nickerson claims, is
not to let other people defeat
you. As evidence to this, he
humbly adds, "By the way —
some of those stockbrokers have
been put out of business in the
current economy and I have more
property than I can handle."

For as long as can be
remembered the dream of
becoming a millionaire has
enthralled Americans. Perhaps
more than any other measure of a
man, the millionaire has long been
America's symbol of success, and
millions have long sought this
ultimate notoriety.
