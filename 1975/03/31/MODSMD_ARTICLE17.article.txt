MALPRACTICE MESSAGE - "What would you do with a $16,000
bill?" former medical student Richard C. Thompson, a San Mateo
anesthesiologist, asked passersby at the Medical Center last Thursday.
He explained he received a bill of $15,808 for malpractice insurance
coverage, and could not "in fairness" pass the cost on to his patients.
So he refused to pay the bill, which forced him to end his medical
practice. Thompson then "took to the streets" to tell people about
the problem ot insurance costs.
