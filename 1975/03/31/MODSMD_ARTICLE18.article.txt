# The Carpenter Report on Parking and Transportation
## 
### 
Following is the text of a report on "Recommended
Parking and Transportation Policies for Stanford University"
prepared by Peter F. Carpenter, assistant vice-president for
medical affairs, at the request of the University's
vice-presidents.

PURPOSE
In November of 1974, the author was asked by the
Vice-Presidents to review the parking and transportation
problem at Stanford University and to recommend a compre
hensive program. At that time, there was confusion about
present policies, high variability of enforcement, and low
degree of compliance with regulations.
In response to that request, I undertook a study effort to
provide a specific program that interested individuals could
react to and that would establish the basis for the further
development of an unending list of details.
There are no easy solutions. The parking problem is, in a
very reai sense, a zero sum game; i.e., any individual's or
group's gain must be at the expense of someone else.
For example, the present parking program, although
frequently referred to as "free" is a subsidized system
wherein everyone (through tuition, general funds, and the
absence of a more uniform benefit to employees) pays the
cost for those who use the parking system.
There is no corresponding subsidy for those who walk,
ride public transit, or bicycle to work, though they clearly
impose less of a burden on the University in terms of
facilities to accommodate their chosen mode of transit.
Formation of a new system poses a basic dilemma
between equity and simplicity. A very simple system will fail
to recognize many of the legitimate needs of members of this
community; a system that is more equitable will be corre
spondingly more complex. A balance must somehow be
found between complete simplicty and complete equity.
The distribution of the limited parking resource is a
political, economic, and emotional issue. At best, we may be
able to achieve a relatively uniform distribution of unhappi
ness. It would be both ambitious and foolhardy to anticipate
popularity for any parking system. This report should permit
the community to focus on some specific recommendations
which, although not ideal, may be satisfactory as one ap
proach to the problem.
Although the parking issue is important in day-to-day
living, it is peripheral to the educational purpose of the
institution. I jÂ»ope that further discussion and decisions will
help to restore it to its appropriate insti* itional context.
IMPORTANCE OF
STANFORD TAKING
A LEADERSHIP POSTURE
There are several important reasons to establish, with all
due haste, a comprehensive parking and transportation sy
stem at Stanford.
As members of an institution of higher learning, we pride
ourselves on staying at the forefront of knowledge and
frequently being at the vanguard of social change. At present,
the energy crisis and environmental concerns that face the
nation should lead us at Stanford to a policy that would
de-emphasize the importance of the private motor vehicle as
the primary mode of transportation.
One would hope that this community could translate its
concern with environmental and conservation problems into
a practical demonstration through its own policies and our
behavior. If we are incapable of taking a tough posture on
environmental and energy conservation issues, it is fright
ening to speculate about the ability of the country-at-large to
make the same difficult decisions.
There is also a real spectre of external regulations, which
could have a severe impact on this campus and its parking
and transportation policies.
The Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated
for comment regulations that would place an extremely high
parking tax on every individual space at Stanford University;
a system that would allow very little latitude for differenti
ating between individual needs. After July 1976, the pro
posed tax would have been $450 per space per year. Inevita
bly, the University would pass such a tax on to the users of
those spaces.
In addition, the City of Palo Alto is now considering
incentives for not using the automobile, possibly a parking
tax. We do not know whether such regulations would apply
only within the city limits or throughout the larger area for
which the city has planning jurisdiction. If they apply solely
within the city limits, the dislocation of vehicles from the
Medical Center to other lots throughout the University will
create a problem for the entire campus.
It would seem appropriate that Stanford voluntarily
control campus parking rather than waiting for externally
imposed regulations, over which we would have little control.
If we have a strong program in place, it is possible that
external regulations might not be applied here, or, if applied,
would allow us to continue an existing system if it meets
general standards.
Finally, the ratio of automobiles to people on the campus
is rising. Comparatively, the rise is significantly greater than
that experienced in the county-at-large. The estimated ratio
of cars to people on this campus rose from .75 in 1957 to .90
in 1968.
During the same period, the ratio of cars to people in
Santa Clara County went from .40 to .48. Although the
energy crisis and the economic situation make extra popula
tion risky, the trend, if unabated and unrestricted, will result
in a campus consisting of buildings surrounded by acres of
automobiles. Most of us agree with the ASSU Senate that
"Stanford University should not develop into a huge parking
lot."
STEPS TAKEN TO
PREPARE RECOMMENDATIONS
In order to prepare the following recommendations, I
took the following steps:
1. A review of prior studies at Stanford University on the
parking and transportation problem. These studies represent
a significant background source for understanding Stanford's
parking and transportation problems. The reader should note
the consistency with which these studies have recommended
similar solutions and the consistency with which those
recommendations have not yet been implemented. Because
these studies went into a number of areas in considerable
detail, it was not necessary in this particular review to study
many of the same areas. The interested reader is urged to
review these studies for himself.
2. In order to achieve the highest possible degree of
public participation in the preparation of my recornmcnda

tions, a series of eight public hearings was held throughout
the campus. These hearings were advertised in the Stanford
Daily and in public service announcements on KZSU. Of
particular concern is the relatively low level of participation
at a majority of these hearings.
3. I also met with a number of individuals who had either
particular perspectives or responsibilities with respect to
parking and transportation.
4. Of particular importance was a series of meetings with
the Parking Subcommittee of the Committee on Land and
Building Development. These meetings served as*a very
valuable source of information as well as feedback from the
members of that subcommittee on the manner in which the
review was conducted and the factors considered in making
my recommendations. The subcommittee was not asked to
endorse these recommendations prior to their submission to
the Vice-Presidents because it seemed more appropriate for
them to be able to respond freely to the recommendations
after they have been placed on the record.
5. Information was requested of and received from the
ASSU Senate regarding the parking system.
6. Another source of information was a survey on the
parking and transportation policies of a large number of
universities throughout the United States and Canada.
Individual readers who review the details of this survey
will probably find examples of any system they might wish
to advocate. There is no single pattern except that a larger
number of the institutions charge for parking than do not
charge for parking.
Those institutions which appear to the author to be
comparable to this institution in location, population densi
ty, and the nature of academic programs offered (e.g. Yale,
UC-Berkeley, UC-Davis, and Cornell), take a much more
aggressive posture in control of parking than does Stanford
University.
Generally, their attitude on enforcement is aggressive; by
and large they do not hesitate to impose heavy fines or to
tow or immobilize vehicles that are illegally parked.
The questionnaires and the back-up information that were
provided with them has been placed on file in the Facilities
Planning Office, and is available for reference by interested
individuals.
Most institutions emphasize that parking is a privilege, not
a right and that individuals must comply with regulations to
avail themselves of that privilege. Free parking is disappearing
throughout institutions of higher learning for a variety of
reasons, not the least of which is the continuing increase in
the number of campus vehicles per employee and student.
This is simply a manifestation of a nation-wide phenome
non. Given the institutions' limited physical and financial
resources, it is unreasonable to expect that their parking
accommodations can continue to expand.
Some rationing must be introduced into the system in
order to equitably distribute a commodity that is expensive
to both the institution (in terms of space and enforcement)
and the society (in terms of environmental and energy
consequences).
7. The final source of information was a survey of a large
number of members of the Stanford community, which was
designed and conducted by a group of students from the
Graduate School of Business.
In order to supplement the information obtained from
previous reports and from the public hearings, a group of
GSB students undertook as a class project a survey of
community behavior, attitudes, and preferences with respect
to parking and transportation. Their questionnaire was sent
to a random sample of the community and of the 1,500
questionnaires sent out, more than 40% were completed and
returned.
The data from the survey indicate that there are clear
community preferences on a number of points. There is wide
support for users paying the cost of parking and conversely,
opposition to nonusers being taxed to provide free or
inexpensive parking for someone else. There is also consider
able concern with the equity of any proposed parking system
and strong support for enforcement that is reasonable but
not harsh. â¢

The report has been referred to the University Committee
on Land and Building Development, headed by Prof. Charles
Meyers, law, and its subcommittee on parking and
transportation, headed by Prof. Scott Pearson, Food Research
Institute, for further consideration.

(Space paid for by News and Publications)

It should be noted that the community preferences
depend to a large degree on how a question is asked. For
example, in the response to the question "at what annual
registration fee would you seriously consider alternative
means of transportation?," 57% of those who currently drive
indicated that they would do so at the $25 level while in
response to the question "at what annual registration fee
would you leave your car home?, only 38% indicated that
they would do so at the $25 level.
For this reason, it is important to use caution when
analyzing the response to a single question. The GSB analysis
is helpful because it attempts to correlate answers from
particular questions with various other responses received
with regard to status and preferences. And some patterns do
emerge.
The following responses to selected questions bear on the
recommendations in this report:
a. Seventy percent felt that there is a parking problem.
b. Forty-one percent live within two miles of their daily
campus destination. (Of these, 81% felt there is a
parking problem.)
c. The only group for which there is any significant
(more than 35% support for preferred space assign
ments is for handicapped drivers.
d. Seventy-two percent felt that "all of those who use it"
or "some of those who use it" should pay the cost of a
parking system (vs. having "everyone" pay that cost).
e. Assuming a fee system, 44% preferred a "registration
sticker, fixed fee" and 42% preferred a "registration
sticker, varying fee."
112. The most preferred method of varying fee was "prefer
ential treatment for carpools"-32%.
g. The second most preferred method of varying fees was
"according to status"-18%.
h. The third most preferred method of varying fees was
"according to desirability of parking space"-16%.
i. Seventy-two percent did not feel that cars should be
assigned to a specific lot.
j. Eighty-eight percent did not feel that cars should be
assigned to a specific space.
k. Twenty-six percent of graduate students currently
have staff parking permits.
1. Eighty-two percent feel that bikepaths need improve
ments.
m. Sixty-eight percent feel that walkways need improve
ment.
n. Forty-five percent of those who currently drive would
use public transit more than three times per week if it
were improved on and near campus. A recent Gallup
Poll provides similar data.
The GSB study was used by the author primarily to
facilitate choice between alternatives. It is entirely possible
that others may draw different conclusions from the same
data. In order to facilitate examination, the card deck with
the responses to the questionnaires has been filed with the
Facilities Planning Office and is available for further analysis.
It is entirely possible to utilize this data to support a
broad range of conclusions; therefore, I have not attempted
to cite answers to specific questions in support of specific
recommendations. The only realistic way in which these
recommendations can be tested against a questionnaire is to
design a questionnaire with the specific recommendations in
this report and to utilize it for a follow-up survey.
IS THERE A
PARKING PROBLEM?
Whether or not there is a parking problem at Stanford
depends upon whom you talk to, where they want to park,
how far they are willing to walk from parking space to
destination, and whether or not it is raining. The reader is
encouraged to look at the information noted in the GSB
students' report. Most people they queried think that there is
a parking problem at Stanford and that the problem consists
primarily of a shortage of spaces.

A questionnaire administered at the time of the 1974-75
automobile registration at the Medical Center had substantial
ly identical results with that of the GSB survey. People
indicated that they felt that there is a parking problem and
that the problem was an absence of spaces rather than the
distance of those spaces from the destination or some other
factor. It is significant to note that in neither of these surveys
was personal security in parking lots considered a significant
problem. In the GSB survey 8% of the females and 2% of the
males indicated that it was a problem.
A review of aerial photographs shows that there is never a
time when all the parking spaces at Stanford are filled and
that during good weather there are a large number of unfilled
spaces in peripheral lots. Clearly, weather does influence this
issue; there is a cross-over from bicycles to other modes of
transportation in rainy weather. This particular question is
examined in slightly more detail in the GSB study.
It is not clearly understood why people have a high
resistance to walking even short distances, but it is clear that
parking near one's destination is an ingrained habit. It is not
unusual to see a person search for five or ten minutes for a
vacant space though there are vacant spaces in an adjacent lot
less than 100 feet away.
More trequently, however, there is an absence of spaces
during the busier hours of the day, and individuals spend a
great deal of time looking for any parking. Eventually they
park at a distance and walk to their office. The use of such
time is, in effect a tax paid by both the individual who
expends the time and by the institution, which loses that
same time and energy from productive work.
The perceived present parking problem will be further
exacerbated by the new buildings under construction or
planned. The Main Library Expansion, the Pearce Mitchell
houses, the Terman Engineering Center, the Fairchild Center,
the Phase I Hospital expansion, the Mudd Chemistry Build
ing, and the three new Row houses will all contribute some
additional parking demand and remove some existing parking
spaces from our current inventory.
Under these circumstances, the demand for parking spaces
on this campus is not even standing still, particularly in light
of the continued trend of individuals to prefer to utilize
individual automobiles as their mode of transportation. If
there were no other reason to re-evaluate our parking policy,
these new projects would in and of themselves push us over
the brink with the existing system (or nonsystem as some
have suggested).
It is in the context of this background that the following
recommendations are therefore made for the parking and
transportation policies of the University.
BROAD PARKING AND
TRANSPORTATION POLICIES
The most critical policy that Stanford needs to articulate
is its basic philosophy with respect to parking and transporta
tion. For this purpose, I recommcnd the following statement:
With regard to parking and transportation, the Universi
ty's first priority in planning, design, regulations, and ex
penditures is to facilitate pedestrian and bicycle travel; the
second priority is to facilitate group transit; and the last
priority is to facilitate private motor vehicle travel.
If broad censensus can be reached throughout the com
munity on this basic policy, then a large number of other
policies will naturally follow from it.
Given a basic policy statement that has broad institutional
support, the next most critical issue in the parking and
transportation area is the designation of the policy making
responsibility. I recommend that the Vice-President for Busi
ness and Finance be given the responsibility for parking and
transportation policy within the University with advice from
a parking and transportation committee. Policies promul
gated by the Vicc-President of Business and Finance may at
his option or at the requ' t of another vice-president be
taken to the Vice-Presidential Group for discussion and
comment.
To facilitate and assure broad and representative advice
and consultation on policy matters, I recommcnd the estab
lishment of a Parking and Transportation Committee with
the following membership to replace the existing Parking
Subcommittee: three faculty members; three staff members,
three students; and four ex-officio members-the Director of
Public Safety, a representative of the Facilities Planning
Office, and one representative each from the Provost's Office
and the Medical Center.
Each of these members should be appointed for a mini
mum of two years. Reappointment will be permissible, and
appointments should be made in such a way that the terms
overlap. The complexity of the parking problem and the
requirement for consistency are such that Committee mem
bers should be exposed to the problem for more than a single
academic year.
The charge to this Committee will be to:
1. Evaluate the operation of the 1975-76 regulations,
which result from this report, and the changes that
occur in the review process.
2. To continue to survey the attitudes of the community
concerning the adequacy of the regulations.
3. To hold, when necessary, public hearings.
4. To recommend revisions in the regulations.
5. To prepare proposals for alternative transportation
experiments.
6. To review the charges and users of the Parking and
Transportation Trust Fund.
In addition, some members of this Committee will serve
on the Special Requests Appeals Board described later.
The administrative responsibility for the parking and
transportation regulations should be assigned to the Director
of Public Services, who should have the responsibility for the
day-to-day operations of the regulations and the discretion to
make minor changes. Such minor changes will be reported
after the fact to the Vice-President for Business and Finance
and to the Parking and Transportation Committee.
Some balance must be achieved between the ability to
make changes in parking regulations promptly and the desir
ability of providing an opportunity for broad public com
ment concerning basic policy changes.
Model Parking Regulations: Utilizing a number of other
universities' regulations as examples, I have prepared a set of
mou<-'< parking regulations for reference and consideration.
Rather than trying to incorporate the existing Stanford
regulations into the specific regulations proposed here, I
developed this model by relying exclusively on parking
systems employed at other universities in order to permit a
comparison between those and the existing Stanford regula
tions.
Portions of the existing Stanford regulations, particularly
the descriptive portions that relate specifically to Stanford,
can probably be utilized in the development of new regula
tions. For the policy sections of the regulations, the language
utilized in the model regulations may be more appropriate.
The model regulations are neither complete nor guaranteed
to be consistent with the recommendations in this report;
they are merely a starting point.
The model regulations use phraseology quite common at
other universities, that regulations are "subject to change
without notice." While this approach is useful for making
minor changes that are obviously needed, it creates the
impression (perhaps understandably) that the "administra
tion" will act precipitously to make changes without the
opportunity for input.
If the community level of paranoia is high and we can live
with a system that may have difficulties but cannot be
changed promptly to resolve those difficulties, then the
"subject to change without notice" clause might be changed
to read "subject to change with 30 days notice."
Given the turnout for hearings on this parking review, it
seems that the opportunity to be heard is much more
important than the exercise of the prerogative. A notice that
all parking was going to be abolished probably would not
attract any attention until the day it took effect. (Oh well,
maybe that is what makes this place so interesting.)
Since there will be a number of problems that go beyond
day-to-day operations but fall short of requiring a change in
the basic regulations, I recommcnd the establishment of an
exception process in the form of a subcommittee of the
Parking and Transportation Committee. This subcommittee,
the Special Requests Appeals Board, will consist of the
