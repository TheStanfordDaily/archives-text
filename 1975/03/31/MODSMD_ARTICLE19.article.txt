# SUMMARY
## 
### 
Based upon a review of prior Stanford
studies on parking and transportation, a series
of eight public meetings throQghout the Stan
ford community, a survey of current parking
and transportation practices at more than 46
universities in the United States and Canada,
and a survey of current practices, values, and
preferences of a randomly selected sample of
the campus community, this report has been
prepared to recommend new parking and trans
portation policies for Stanford University.
The report represents one individual's speci
fic recommendations; the endorsement of vari
ous constituent groups and/or committees was
intentionally not solicited prior to its submis
sion.
Given the broad constituency input that
took place during the preparation of the report,
I hope the recommendations will be found
acceptable in large part by the community.
The report recommends:
1. That Stanford establish a parking and
transportation policy giving first priority in
planning, design, regulations, and expenditures
to facilitation of pedestrian and bicycle travel;
second priority to group transit; and the lowest
priority to private motor vehicle travel.
2. The establishment of a parking and trans
portation trust fund to utilize all parking reve
nues for the improvement of facilities for all
modes of transportation, with preferences to
expenditures and support of nonautomobile
modes.
3. Mandatory registration of all vehicles at
no charge.
4. That the campus be divided into parking

zones: a Free Zone, a Residence Zone, an
Academic Zone, and a Vehicle Exclusion Zone.
5. Vehicle registration alone is required for
use of the Free Zone.
6. Parking in the Residence and Academic
Zones would involve an annual fee and a
parking permit.
7. Priority for applying for parking stickers
for the Academic Zone descends from faculty
to staff to students.
8. That all visitor parking be paid for at the
time of use by meters or in paid lots.
9. That responsibility for administering the
parking and transportation system be assigned
to the Vice-President for Business and Finance.
10. That day-to-day operations be con
trolled fey the Director of Public Safety.
11. That a parking and transportation com
mittee be appointed to serve as a consultative
body for the implementation of the recommen
dations of this report and the continued refine
ment and improvement of the system.
12. That an aggressive program be under
taken to plan and develop alternative modes of
transportation for the campus, primarily for
intra-campus circulation, utilizing the resources
of the parking and transportation funds.
The recommendations in this report may be
considered singly; some recommendations may
be implemented as written or modified, while
others should be deferred for further study.
However, if the proposed policies do not
receive broad community and administrative
support, it is recommended that existing
parking regulations be abolished and parking be
totally uncontrolled.

to the Vice-President for Business and Finance.
10. That day-to-day operations be con
trolled fey the Director of Public Safety.
11. That a parking and transportation com
mittee be appointed to serve as a consultative
body for the implementation of the recommen
dations of this report and the continued refine
ment and improvement of the system.
12. That an aggressive program be under
taken to plan and develop alternative modes of
transportation for the campus, primarily for
intra-campus circulation, utilizing the resources

The recommendations in this report may be
considered singly; some recommendations may
be implemented as written or modified, while
others should be deferred for further study.
However, if the proposed policies do not
receive broad community and administrative
support, it is recommended that existing
parking regulations be abolished and parking be
totally uncontrolled.
Based upon a review of prior Stanford
studies on parking and transportation, a series
of eight public meetings throQghout the Stan
ford community, a survey of current parking
and transportation practices at more than 46
universities in the United States and Canada,
and a survey of current practices, values, and
preferences of a randomly selected sample of
the campus community, this report has been
prepared to recommend new parking and trans
portation policies for Stanford University.
The report represents one individual's speci
fic recommendations; the endorsement of vari
ous constituent groups and/or committees was
intentionally not solicited prior to its submis
sion.
Given the broad constituency input that
took place during the preparation of the report,
I hope the recommendations will be found
acceptable in large part by the community.
The report recommends:
1. That Stanford establish a parking and
transportation policy giving first priority in
planning, design, regulations, and expenditures
to facilitation of pedestrian and bicycle travel;
second priority to group transit; and the lowest
priority to private motor vehicle travel.
2. The establishment of a parking and trans
portation trust fund to utilize all parking reve
nues for the improvement of facilities for all
modes of transportation, with preferences to
expenditures and support of nonautomobile
modes.
3. Mandatory registration of all vehicles at
no charge.
4. That the campus be divided into parking

zones: a Free Zone, a Residence Zone, an
Academic Zone, and a Vehicle Exclusion Zone.
5. Vehicle registration alone is required for
use of the Free Zone.
6. Parking in the Residence and Academic
Zones would involve an annual fee and a
parking permit.
7. Priority for applying for parking stickers
for the Academic Zone descends from faculty
to staff to students.
8. That all visitor parking be paid for at the
time of use by meters or in paid lots.
9. That responsibility for administering the
parking and transportation system be assigned
to the Vice-President for Business and Finance.
10. That day-to-day operations be con
trolled fey the Director of Public Safety.
11. That a parking and transportation com
mittee be appointed to serve as a consultative
body for the implementation of the recommen
dations of this report and the continued refine
ment and improvement of the system.
