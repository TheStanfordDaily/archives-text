# Cambodian President Prepares To Leave

### 
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) —
Cambodian President Lon Nol
prepared to leave his country
yesterday as Communist-led insurgents
moved closer to Phnom Penh,
overrunning a position six miles north
of that capital city.
Meanwhile, Da Nang, South
Vietnam's second largest city, and
other northern coastal strongholds
crumbled as a powerful North
Vietnamese offensive rolled south
toward Qui Nhon, leaving in its wake
destruction, panic and an estimated
two million refugees.
The half-crippled, 61-year-old
Cambodian leader is scheduled to leave
Phnom Penh this afternoon and fly to
Thailand and Indonesia, Thai Prime
Minister Kukrit Pramoj said.
He will then fly to Hawaii for
"medical treatment," said Pan Sothi,
secretary-general of Lon Nol's
Social-Republican Party. Reliable
sources indicated he might go to
Washington before Hawaii.
Not Exile
No one is calling the flight political
exile, and Lon Nol is to retain the title
of president while abroad.
A highly placed general said
military- officers hope to use Lon Nol's
absence to work with Premier Long
Boret to forge a united front that
would bolster the government position
in possible peace negotiations with the
Khmer Rouge.
"We hope that all those around Lon
Nol at Cham Carmon — his
presidential palace — leave and that
the palace is turned into a hospital or a
refugee camp,"the general added.
Sources said Lon Nol is to be

accompanied by 26 civilian and
military men.
Many Cambodian officials are
hopeful that Lon Nol's departure will
create a favorable climate for
negotiations with the Khmer Rouge,
but some observers think the military
situation may be beyond repair and
that Lon Nol's exit may be due to
political infighting.
Soldiers Retreat
Field reports said about 30
government soldiers abandoned Prek
Bang and swam west across the Tonle
Sap River at a point six miles north of
the capital. The retreat was followed
by an insurgent mortar attack on
villages along Highway 5 which killed
three persons and wounded six.
Heavy insurgent fire was also
reported yesterday along the northern
front, which has been pierced three
times in the past few days.
In South Vietnam the situation was
also bleak. Demoralized government
forces offered little resistance as the
North Vietnamese plunged 175 miles
from Da Nang to Qui Nhon, where
fighting was reported.
U.S. officials said all Americans had
been evacuated from Qui Nhon, a port
that is South Vietnam's third largest
city with more than 200,000 people.
Like Da Nang, it was once a major
U.S. base.
The United States continued trying
to evacuate refugees from Da Nang by
ship, but North Vietnam denounced
the sealift as a "brazen provocation"
and demanded that all U.S. Navy ships
stay away from South Vietnam.
The Viet Cong called the sea
evacuation a "deceptive trick."

to evacuate refugees from Da Nang by
ship, but North Vietnam denounced
the sealift as a "brazen provocation"
and demanded that all U.S. Navy ships
stay away from South Vietnam.
The Viet Cong called the sea
evacuation a "deceptive trick."
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) —
Cambodian President Lon Nol
prepared to leave his country
yesterday as Communist-led insurgents
moved closer to Phnom Penh,
overrunning a position six miles north
of that capital city.
Meanwhile, Da Nang, South
Vietnam's second largest city, and
other northern coastal strongholds
crumbled as a powerful North
Vietnamese offensive rolled south
toward Qui Nhon, leaving in its wake
destruction, panic and an estimated
two million refugees.
The half-crippled, 61-year-old
Cambodian leader is scheduled to leave
Phnom Penh this afternoon and fly to
Thailand and Indonesia, Thai Prime
Minister Kukrit Pramoj said.
He will then fly to Hawaii for
"medical treatment," said Pan Sothi,
secretary-general of Lon Nol's
Social-Republican Party. Reliable
sources indicated he might go to
Washington before Hawaii.
Not Exile
No one is calling the flight political
exile, and Lon Nol is to retain the title
of president while abroad.
A highly placed general said
military- officers hope to use Lon Nol's
absence to work with Premier Long
Boret to forge a united front that
would bolster the government position
in possible peace negotiations with the
Khmer Rouge.
"We hope that all those around Lon
Nol at Cham Carmon — his
presidential palace — leave and that
the palace is turned into a hospital or a
refugee camp,"the general added.
Sources said Lon Nol is to be

accompanied by 26 civilian and
military men.
Many Cambodian officials are
hopeful that Lon Nol's departure will
create a favorable climate for
negotiations with the Khmer Rouge,
but some observers think the military
situation may be beyond repair and
that Lon Nol's exit may be due to
political infighting.
Soldiers Retreat
Field reports said about 30
government soldiers abandoned Prek
Bang and swam west across the Tonle
Sap River at a point six miles north of
the capital. The retreat was followed
by an insurgent mortar attack on
villages along Highway 5 which killed
three persons and wounded six.
Heavy insurgent fire was also
reported yesterday along the northern
front, which has been pierced three
times in the past few days.
In South Vietnam the situation was
also bleak. Demoralized government
forces offered little resistance as the
North Vietnamese plunged 175 miles
from Da Nang to Qui Nhon, where
fighting was reported.
U.S. officials said all Americans had
been evacuated from Qui Nhon, a port
that is South Vietnam's third largest
city with more than 200,000 people.
Like Da Nang, it was once a major
U.S. base.
The United States continued trying
to evacuate refugees from Da Nang by
ship, but North Vietnam denounced
the sealift as a "brazen provocation"
and demanded that all U.S. Navy ships
stay away from South Vietnam.
