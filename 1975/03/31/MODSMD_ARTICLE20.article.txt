# CONCLUSION

### 
This section concludes my recommendations. While 1 am
sure that there are many individuals who can improve upon
them and that I have overlooked many considerations, it is
important that we take a step forward now.
These recommendations, accepted in whole or in part,
will provide movement in the right direction. Their refine
ment and the development of increased equity will be a
continuing challenge to the entire community.
1 must interpose a word about the need for community
and administrative support of any parking and transportation
system.
It is imperative that the community at large view the
parking and transportation program from a community per
spective rather than that of self-interested individuals. Since
we are attempting to allocate relatively scarce or poorly
located resources among a large number of persons with
varying needs, it is inevitable that, as individuals, some will
find any allocation undesirable. But it is important that we
all see Stanford's program as being reasonable and fair in the
broad context, though it may be difficult, expensive, or
inconvenient for any one of us.
There must be strong social pressure for compliance with
whatever regulations are established. Institutions like Stan
ford place high values on individual responsibility in the
context of community responsibility. One would hope that
these high moral standards will apply to so personal and
homely an issue as parking and transportation.
At the other end of the organizational spectrum it is
critical that any parking and transportation system have the
complete institutional support, if not the total personal
agreement, of the President and senior officers of the Univer
sity.
Without that support, the persons who administer the

program will be bitten to death by ducks and driven to
madness by people seeking special privileges. Enforcement of
policies and regulations for which top management is un
willing to provide backup is frustrating-likely impossible.
It is critical that our policy be fair; it is also critical that it
be very firm. Other institutions, some of which we class as
sister institutions, have much stronger and much firmer
parking regulations than we do. For example, Yale tows away
violating vehicles without notice, a practice that many people
feel would be intolerable at Stanford.
In the event that a substantial body of these recommenda
tions is unacceptable to the community or impossible to
implement, the present system, which does not work, should
be abandoned. Under those circumstances, we should abolish
all parking regulations and allow people to park wherever
they can.
No system is clearly better than a weak system; from an
administrative standpoint, no system involves a minimal
commitment of resources. To the degree that we are willing
to turn a deaf ear to a gamut of individual complaints, it is
probably the most efficient approach in terms of resources
required.
While the savings in enforcement and administration of a
nonsystem would be moderate (at least initially) the burden
and inconvenience placed on individuals would vary drastical
ly, some faring well, others faring poorly. Therefore, the
broad community interests are such that a heavier commit
ment of administrative resources is appropriate, and a posi
tive system for parking and transportation should be estab
lished.
To that end, I hope the community will be able to address
the problem with a sense of collective responsibility and
respond accordingly.
