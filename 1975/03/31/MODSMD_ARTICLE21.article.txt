## Letdown Stymies Batsmen's Tourney Triumph 
### MIKE TOLLIN 
The traditional Stanford
letdown struck again Saturday
night in Riverside. After sweeping
six of seven games in impressive
fashion, the Cardinal batsmen lost
the Riverside National
Intercollegiate baseball
championship to a team they had
beaten easily the previous day.
Stanford entered the
eight-team tournament with a
five-game win streak, following a
March 22 rainout of a
doubleheader with Cal Poly,
Pomona. The Cards then ran their
streak to nine in capturing the
classic's Gold Division.
But when UC-Riverside
outlasted Arizona 12-11 to win
the Blue Division, the Cards were
denied their chance for revenge
against the Wildcats. Stanford
could not get quite so psyched for
Riverside, and finished as
tournament runnerup for the
second straight year.
Stanford 15, Washington State 7
In last Monday's Riverside
opener, Cardinal batsmen

continued their ramoage en
route to a 15-7 trouncing of the
Cougars. Stanford, having scored
27 runs in its last three outings,
erupted for seven runs in the
second inning, and never trailed
thereafter. Third baseman Gary
Pitchford led the attack with four
hits and three RBl's.
Stanford 5, Southern Illinois 1
A 1 Arthur pitched a sterling
four-hitter in leading the Cards
over last year's third place finisher
in the college World Series. In
running his record to 4-1, Arthur,
called the team's "stopper" by
Coach Young, stymied the Salukis
with his "improved fast ball." The
senior righthander struck out
eight while walking none and
allowing no earned runs. Home
runs by Bruce Robinson and Tom
Guardino provided the offensive
punch.
Stanford 4, Cornell 3
In the nightcap to Tuesday's
doubleheader, the Cards got
another strong performance on
the mound in outlasting pesky
Cornell. In his second straight

15-strikeout effort, lefty John
Yandle scattered six hits in going
the distance for the win.
In the eighth inning, the Big
Red got to Yandle for two runs to
knot the game at three. But in the
bottom half of the frame, the
Cards put together three hits to
break the deadlock. Pitchford
singled and was chased to third on
a hit-and-run base knock by
Guardino. Pinch-hitter Randy
Wong then stepped up and
walloped a double for the
game-winner.
Stanford 11, Southern Methodist 0
Looking like world beaters —
or at least Arizona beaters — the
Cards won their ninth straight
outing in a laugher over SMU.
Mike Williamson, relegated to the
bullpen for most of this season,
twirled a masterful two-hit
shutout for his fourth win in six
decisions. Williamson fanned
thirteen Mustangs, and held the
Texans hitless for 6 2/3 innings.
Home runs by Kevin Sullivan,
Bob Hampton, and Wong
highlighted the twelve-hit Cardinal

attack. Freshman Dave Perez
banged out four safeties in
running his tourney average to
.400.
Arizona 7, Stanford 3
Stanford continued to have its
troubles with teams from the sun
country. After dropping four of
five contests in an early-season
junket to Arizona, the Cards were
upended again Thursday by the
Wildcats in an rain-abbreviated
game.
Junior Bernie Hittner was
socked for seven Arizona runs in
four innings, including a two-run
homer by the game's second
batter. The Cards fought back in
the opening frame on hits by
Pitchford, Dave Baker and
Robinson. But Arizona hurler
Loafman settled down, and
Stanford's comeback attempt was
cut short after seven innings due
to "blowing dirt and cold
temperatures."
Stanford 5, Riverside 1
Playing the role of rude guest,
Stanford ripped tourney hostUC-'
Riverside Friday to advance to

Saturday's Gold Division title tilt
against Santa Clara.
Sophomore Jim
Scharffenberger went the distance
in his first start of the season.
Despite having pitched only 2 2/3
innings all year, Scharffenberger
looked sharp in becoming the
fourth Stanford hurler to eam a
complete game victory in the
tournament.
The Cards batters broke up a
pitcher's duel with four runs in
the fifth inning. Robinson's
two-run double sparked the rally
and raised his RBI total to 30 in
27 games.
Stanford 4, Santa Clara 0
Led by a pro-type performance
from moundsman A 1 Arthur, the
Cards wrapped up the Gold
Division crown and won a berth in
the tourney finals with a shutout
over Santa Clara.
Arthur who entered the game
sporting a 1.95 earned run
average, "just completely
dominated" the Broncos,
according to Assistant Coach Tom
Dunton.
Santa Clara, which came into
the game with a 4-2 record in the
tournament, held the Cards to a
scoreless tie for seven innings.
Then freshman firstbaseman
Guardino exploded for a
bases-loaded double to break open
the defensive struggle.
Riverside 7, Stanford 4
Playing its "poorest game of
the tournament," according to
Dunton, the Cards were dumped
by Riverside in the championship
game.
The teams went into the eighth
inning locked in a 4-4 tie. Then,
before a cheering home crowd,
Riverside jumped on pitcher John
Yandle and relievers Caldwell and
Ed Matta for three runs and the
championship.

bottom half of the frame, the
Cards put together three hits to
break the deadlock. Pitchford
singled and was chased to third on
a hit-and-run base knock by
Guardino. Pinch-hitter Randy
Wong then stepped up and
walloped a double for the
game-winner.
Stanford 11, Southern Methodist 0
Looking like world beaters —
or at least Arizona beaters — the
Cards won their ninth straight
outing in a laugher over SMU.
Mike Williamson, relegated to the
bullpen for most of this season,
twirled a masterful two-hit
shutout for his fourth win in six
decisions. Williamson fanned
thirteen Mustangs, and held the
Texans hitless for 6 2/3 innings.
Home runs by Kevin Sullivan,
Bob Hampton, and Wong
highlighted the twelve-hit Cardinal

attack. Freshman Dave Perez
banged out four safeties in
running his tourney average to
.400.
Arizona 7, Stanford 3
Stanford continued to have its
troubles with teams from the sun
country. After dropping four of
five contests in an early-season
junket to Arizona, the Cards were
upended again Thursday by the
Wildcats in an rain-abbreviated
game.
Junior Bernie Hittner was
socked for seven Arizona runs in
four innings, including a two-run
homer by the game's second
batter. The Cards fought back in
the opening frame on hits by
Pitchford, Dave Baker and
Robinson. But Arizona hurler
Loafman settled down, and
Stanford's comeback attempt was
cut short after seven innings due
to "blowing dirt and cold
temperatures."

in his first start of the season.
Despite having pitched only 2 2/3
innings all year, Scharffenberger
looked sharp in becoming the

two-run double sparked the rally
and raised his RBI total to 30 in

Stanford 4, Santa Clara 0
Led by a pro-type performance

Santa Clara, which came into

SMOKIN' 4 EM — Card pitcher Mike Williamson, shown here in action
against USF last month, hurled his way to a shutout for Stanford last
week in the Riverside National Intercollegiate Tournament.
Williamson held Southern Methodist to a miniscule two hits.
The traditional Stanford
letdown struck again Saturday
night in Riverside. After sweeping
six of seven games in impressive
fashion, the Cardinal batsmen lost
the Riverside National
Intercollegiate baseball
championship to a team they had
beaten easily the previous day.
Stanford entered the
eight-team tournament with a
five-game win streak, following a
March 22 rainout of a
doubleheader with Cal Poly,
Pomona. The Cards then ran their
streak to nine in capturing the
classic's Gold Division.
But when UC-Riverside
outlasted Arizona 12-11 to win
the Blue Division, the Cards were
denied their chance for revenge
against the Wildcats. Stanford
could not get quite so psyched for

tournament runnerup for the

In last Monday's Riverside
opener, Cardinal batsmen

continued their ramoage en

27 runs in its last three outings,

second inning, and never trailed
thereafter. Third baseman Gary
Pitchford led the attack with four
hits and three RBl's.

A 1 Arthur pitched a sterling
four-hitter in leading the Cards
over last year's third place finisher

with his "improved fast ball." The
senior righthander struck out
eight while walking none and
allowing no earned runs. Home
runs by Bruce Robinson and Tom
Guardino provided the offensive
punch.
Stanford 4, Cornell 3
In the nightcap to Tuesday's
doubleheader, the Cards got
another strong performance on
the mound in outlasting pesky
Cornell. In his second straight

15-strikeout effort, lefty John

two-run double sparked the rally
and raised his RBI total to 30 in
27 games.
Stanford 4, Santa Clara 0
Led by a pro-type performance
from moundsman A 1 Arthur, the
Cards wrapped up the Gold
Division crown and won a berth in
the tourney finals with a shutout
over Santa Clara.
Arthur who entered the game
sporting a 1.95 earned run
average, "just completely
dominated" the Broncos,
according to Assistant Coach Tom
Dunton.
Santa Clara, which came into
the game with a 4-2 record in the
tournament, held the Cards to a
scoreless tie for seven innings.
Then freshman firstbaseman
Guardino exploded for a
bases-loaded double to break open
the defensive struggle.
Riverside 7, Stanford 4
Playing its "poorest game of
the tournament," according to
Dunton, the Cards were dumped
by Riverside in the championship
game.
The teams went into the eighth
inning locked in a 4-4 tie. Then,
before a cheering home crowd,
Riverside jumped on pitcher John
Yandle and relievers Caldwell and
Ed Matta for three runs and the
championship.

SMOKIN' 4 EM — Card pitcher Mike Williamson, shown here in action
against USF last month, hurled his way to a shutout for Stanford last
week in the Riverside National Intercollegiate Tournament.
Williamson held Southern Methodist to a miniscule two hits.
The traditional Stanford
letdown struck again Saturday
night in Riverside. After sweeping
six of seven games in impressive
fashion, the Cardinal batsmen lost
the Riverside National
Intercollegiate baseball
championship to a team they had
beaten easily the previous day.
Stanford entered the
eight-team tournament with a
five-game win streak, following a
March 22 rainout of a
doubleheader with Cal Poly,
Pomona. The Cards then ran their
streak to nine in capturing the
classic's Gold Division.
But when UC-Riverside
outlasted Arizona 12-11 to win
the Blue Division, the Cards were
denied their chance for revenge
against the Wildcats. Stanford
could not get quite so psyched for
Riverside, and finished as
tournament runnerup for the
second straight year.
Stanford 15, Washington State 7
In last Monday's Riverside
opener, Cardinal batsmen

continued their ramoage en
route to a 15-7 trouncing of the
Cougars. Stanford, having scored
27 runs in its last three outings,
erupted for seven runs in the
second inning, and never trailed
thereafter. Third baseman Gary
Pitchford led the attack with four
hits and three RBl's.
Stanford 5, Southern Illinois 1
A 1 Arthur pitched a sterling
four-hitter in leading the Cards
over last year's third place finisher
in the college World Series. In
running his record to 4-1, Arthur,
called the team's "stopper" by
Coach Young, stymied the Salukis
with his "improved fast ball." The
senior righthander struck out
eight while walking none and
allowing no earned runs. Home
runs by Bruce Robinson and Tom
Guardino provided the offensive
punch.
Stanford 4, Cornell 3
In the nightcap to Tuesday's
doubleheader, the Cards got
another strong performance on
the mound in outlasting pesky
Cornell. In his second straight

15-strikeout effort, lefty John
Yandle scattered six hits in going
the distance for the win.
In the eighth inning, the Big
Red got to Yandle for two runs to
knot the game at three. But in the
bottom half of the frame, the
Cards put together three hits to
break the deadlock. Pitchford
singled and was chased to third on
a hit-and-run base knock by
Guardino. Pinch-hitter Randy
Wong then stepped up and
walloped a double for the
game-winner.
Stanford 11, Southern Methodist 0
Looking like world beaters —
or at least Arizona beaters — the
Cards won their ninth straight
outing in a laugher over SMU.
Mike Williamson, relegated to the
bullpen for most of this season,
twirled a masterful two-hit
shutout for his fourth win in six
decisions. Williamson fanned
thirteen Mustangs, and held the
Texans hitless for 6 2/3 innings.
Home runs by Kevin Sullivan,
Bob Hampton, and Wong
highlighted the twelve-hit Cardinal

attack. Freshman Dave Perez
banged out four safeties in
running his tourney average to
.400.
Arizona 7, Stanford 3
Stanford continued to have its
troubles with teams from the sun
country. After dropping four of
five contests in an early-season
junket to Arizona, the Cards were
upended again Thursday by the
Wildcats in an rain-abbreviated
game.
Junior Bernie Hittner was
socked for seven Arizona runs in
four innings, including a two-run
homer by the game's second
batter. The Cards fought back in
the opening frame on hits by
Pitchford, Dave Baker and
Robinson. But Arizona hurler
Loafman settled down, and
Stanford's comeback attempt was
cut short after seven innings due
to "blowing dirt and cold
temperatures."
Stanford 5, Riverside 1
Playing the role of rude guest,
Stanford ripped tourney hostUC-'
Riverside Friday to advance to

Saturday's Gold Division title tilt
against Santa Clara.
Sophomore Jim
Scharffenberger went the distance
in his first start of the season.
Despite having pitched only 2 2/3
innings all year, Scharffenberger
looked sharp in becoming the
fourth Stanford hurler to eam a
complete game victory in the
tournament.
The Cards batters broke up a
pitcher's duel with four runs in
the fifth inning. Robinson's
two-run double sparked the rally
and raised his RBI total to 30 in
27 games.
