those other guys out there, and of
doing my best."

breaststroke with a time of
2:00.83, six-tenths of a second
better than the mark set by Rich
Colella last year.
All told, 10 American records

meet held at Cleveland State
University. Three of those marks
were broken by USC's John

convincing 344 point victory.
Indiana finished second with 274,
followed by UCLA with 180.

freestyle with a time of 4:28.00.

championships earlier this month.
In analyzing his three-victory
performance, USC's Naber told

the Associated Press, "Placing is
important, especially in team
scoring. But John Naber also has
to swim for John Naber and I
would have been disappointed if I
didn't do as well as I did."
