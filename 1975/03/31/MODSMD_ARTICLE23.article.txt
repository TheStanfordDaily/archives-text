# Search For Coach Enters Final Stage
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
For the moment, at least, the
15-member committee searching
for a successor to Howie Dallmar
seems to have whittled down a
field of 50 applicants to two
finalists.
However, Athletic Director Joe
Ruetz interviewed between 10
and 15 other potential candidates
during the NCAA tournament and
coaches' conference in San Diego
— and may ask the committee to
interview as many as five
additional candidates before
making a final selection. Ruetz
could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
The Daily has learned that the
two finalists at this point are Bub
Bowling, assistant coach here
since 1970, and Dave Bliss,
assistant to Bobby Knight at
Indiana University.
The search committee expects

to make a recommendation to
Ruetz by the end of this week,
according to Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli, a
committee member. Ruetz will
then offer the head coaching job
to the candidate and an official
announcement will probably be
made a week from today.
Stanford will pay the new head
coach less than $20,000. He will
have a $6000 recruiting budget —
far smaller than the amount most
state school coaches receive. And
the new coach will be able to
offer only five scholarships to
potential players.
According to Cavalli, these
factors tend to make the Stanford
job relatively unattractive to
so-called "name" coaches,
especially because more lucrative
jobs — at UCLA, for instance —
are available.
Cavalli said Ruetz and the

committee are looking for "a
young, aggressive, dynamic type
of guy who is going to recruit like
hell to get Stanford as aggressive a
team as possible." He added that
about half of the 50 people who
have applied for the job are
assistant coaches who might fit
this description.
Another "half dozen or so" of
the applicants are big college
coaches, according to Cavalli, and
there is an equal number of
applicants who are junior college
coaches. Eight or nine applicants
are small college coaches.
Bowling, 35, holds a bachelor's
and a master's degree in physical
education from Stanford. Prior to
coming here, he was an assistant
coach at Los Altos High School,
and varsity coach at Westmont
High School in Campbell and at
Lynbrook High School in San
Jose.
Bliss, 31, has been an assistant
coach at Indiana since 1971. He
holds a bachelor's and an M.B.A
degree from Cornell, and served as
an assistant at both West Point
and Cornell prior to landing the
job at Indiana.
Cage Note ... Stanford's Rich
Kelley will compete in the Aloha
Classic in Honolulu, Haw. April
10-12. The final game of the
tournament may be televised.
Kelley will also play in the
televised Pizza Hut Classic in Las
Vegas on April 15.

and 15 other potential candidates
during the NCAA tournament and
coaches' conference in San Diego
— and may ask the committee to
interview as many as five
additional candidates before
making a final selection. Ruetz
could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
The Daily has learned that the
two finalists at this point are Bub
Bowling, assistant coach here
since 1970, and Dave Bliss,
assistant to Bobby Knight at
Indiana University.
The search committee expects

to make a recommendation to
Ruetz by the end of this week,
according to Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli, a
committee member. Ruetz will
then offer the head coaching job
to the candidate and an official
announcement will probably be
made a week from today.
Stanford will pay the new head
coach less than $20,000. He will
have a $6000 recruiting budget —
far smaller than the amount most
state school coaches receive. And
the new coach will be able to
offer only five scholarships to
potential players.
According to Cavalli, these
factors tend to make the Stanford
job relatively unattractive to
so-called "name" coaches,
especially because more lucrative
jobs — at UCLA, for instance —
are available.
Cavalli said Ruetz and the

committee are looking for "a
young, aggressive, dynamic type
of guy who is going to recruit like
hell to get Stanford as aggressive a
team as possible." He added that
about half of the 50 people who
have applied for the job are
assistant coaches who might fit
this description.
Another "half dozen or so" of
the applicants are big college
coaches, according to Cavalli, and
there is an equal number of
applicants who are junior college
coaches. Eight or nine applicants
are small college coaches.
Bowling, 35, holds a bachelor's
and a master's degree in physical
education from Stanford. Prior to
coming here, he was an assistant
coach at Los Altos High School,
and varsity coach at Westmont
High School in Campbell and at
Lynbrook High School in San
Jose.
Bliss, 31, has been an assistant
coach at Indiana since 1971. He
holds a bachelor's and an M.B.A
degree from Cornell, and served as
an assistant at both West Point
and Cornell prior to landing the
job at Indiana.
Cage Note ... Stanford's Rich
Kelley will compete in the Aloha
Classic in Honolulu, Haw. April
10-12. The final game of the
tournament may be televised.
Kelley will also play in the
televised Pizza Hut Classic in Las
Vegas on April 15.

SECOND CITY CHAMP — Last Sunday, junior pre-med Pat Cornett
defeated defending champion Cheryl Pastore to capture the women's
crown in the San Francisco City Golf Tournament. Senior Dave
Baskins had earlier won the men's title.
For the moment, at least, the
15-member committee searching
for a successor to Howie Dallmar
seems to have whittled down a
field of 50 applicants to two
finalists.
