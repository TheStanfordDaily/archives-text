# UCLA Looking For Yet Another Wizard
## 
### 
John Wooden will coach a
UCLA basketball game for the
767 th and last time tonight.
Appropriately enough, the Bruins
will be battling Kentucky in a bid
for their 10th NCAA
championship in the last 12 years.
The game will be televised on
Channel 4 starting at 6 p.m.
Wooden announced his
retirement shortly after UCLA
had downed Louisville 75-74 in a
dramatic overtime game Saturday.
This is Wooden's 27th season at

UCLA. He came to Westwood
after serving for two years as
athletic director and basketball
and baseball coach at Indiana
State.
During his years at UCLA,
Wooden has compiled an amazing
record of 619-147 (.808). While at
Indiana State, his teams won 47
games and lost 14. His cumulative
record at the two schools makes
him the winningest active
basketball coach in the country.
Wooden commented, "I have
said before my most pleasant and
satisfying year at UCLA was my
first in 1949. We were picked to
finish last and won 22," he added.
"My last year at UCLA is equally
satifying."
Speculation on Wooden's
successor centers on three men:
Louisville Coach Denny Crum,
who once assisted Wooden at
UCLA; Indiana Coach Bobby
Knight and Los Angeles Lakers
star Jerry West. UCLA Assistant
Coach Frank Arnold recently
accepted the head coaching spot
at Brigham Young. The other
assistant, Gary Cunningham,
apparently plans to work in
athletic administration, and has
not expressed interest in
Wooden's job.
Wooden said he would not
recommend a successor.
