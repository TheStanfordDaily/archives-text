# Excel In Stanford Relays
## Spikers Smash Occidental 
### MARK FUNK 
Bouyed by a stand-out effort
in the high hurdles by John Foster
and an impressive win by
intermediate hurdler Matt
Hogsett, the Stanford track team
coasted to an easy 85-69 win over
outmanned Occidental College
Saturday afternoon in Stanford
Stadium.
Foster, who had to fight
gusting winds, turned in a credible
14.1 in the highs to upset
teammate Dave Bagshaw. The
transfer from Foothill Junior
College, who placed third in last
year's State JC meet, is just
recovering from a leg injury that
has hampered him for the past
few weeks. Observers say that he
is one of Stanford's brightest
hurdle prospects in quite some
time.
And that's not all Foster did.
As a last minute entrant in the
high jump, he cleared 6-6 to rack
up another first place. The leap
was two inches higher than
Foster's previous best.
Although Stanford won 11 of
18 events, most times were
unspectacular because of weather
conditions.
Hogsett Edges Out Opponent
The most interesting match-up
of the meet was in the 440
intermediate hurdles, where
Hogsett, defending Pacific Eight
champion, held off a closing
charge by Occidental's Bob Odell
to win in a time of 52.0. Odell,
who was just two-tenths of a
second behind, is the defending
NCAA Division II champion in
the intermediates.
Two new meet records were
established Saturday, including a
4a.2 in the 440 relay. Marvin
Holmes, James Lofton, Alan
Sheats and Scott Wingo shattered
the mark and helped pace the
Cardinals to a sweep of the short
sprints.
Sophomore Holmes keyed the
sprinters as he picked up two
other blue ribbons in the 100-yard
dash, where he out-leaned
Occidental's Steve Brown at the
finish, and the 220. He turned the
century in 9.9 and the 220 in
21.4.
Bellah Sets Record
Steeplechaser Jack Bellah
turned in a 9:10.2 for the other
meet record. The win highlighted

a good effort by the Stanford
distance crew. Steve Crowley won
the mile in 4:08 while Mark
McConnell took the two mile.
In other events, John
Olenchalk added two feet to his
personal best as he won the shot
put with a toss of 54 for first
place. Olenchalk had a series of
excellent throws — all over 52
feet.
Lofton continued his winning
ways in the long jump. He took
off with first place after leaping
24-6% — his best of the year.
5000 Spectators At Relays
Five thousand spectators
turned out a week ago to witness
the resurrection of the Stanford
Relays. The Cards had a slight
edge in the non-scoring meet,
winning five events to California's
four. San Jose State won three,
while Hay ward and San Francisco
State won one each.

Stanford Head Coach Payton
Jordan said he sees a bright future
for the Relays. He is already
making plans for next year's meet
and says that he has received
inquiries from schools such as
Oregon State and Washington
State about competing in what he
thinks might become a Northern
California showcase.
Lofton won the long jump at
24-o'4 while a team of Gregg
Densmore, Bagshaw, Carl Johnk
and Foster won the shuttle
hurdles in one minute flat.
Foster and Bagshaw returned
later in the afternoon to team
with Reggie Mason and Hogsett in
the one-mile intermediate hurdle
relay. The team walked away with
the event in 3:37.
The Cards won the 880 relay in
1:27 while Jim Bordoni, Mark
Hadley, Ben Scheible and Crowley
took the two mile relay in 7:49.4.

4a.2 in the 440 relay. Marvin
Holmes, James Lofton, Alan
Sheats and Scott Wingo shattered
the mark and helped pace the
Cardinals to a sweep of the short
sprints.
Sophomore Holmes keyed the
sprinters as he picked up two
other blue ribbons in the 100-yard
dash, where he out-leaned
Occidental's Steve Brown at the
finish, and the 220. He turned the
century in 9.9 and the 220 in
21.4.
Bellah Sets Record
Steeplechaser Jack Bellah
turned in a 9:10.2 for the other
meet record. The win highlighted

a good effort by the Stanford
distance crew. Steve Crowley won
the mile in 4:08 while Mark
McConnell took the two mile.
In other events, John
Olenchalk added two feet to his
personal best as he won the shot
put with a toss of 54 for first
place. Olenchalk had a series of
excellent throws — all over 52
feet.
Lofton continued his winning
ways in the long jump. He took
off with first place after leaping
24-6% — his best of the year.
5000 Spectators At Relays
Five thousand spectators
turned out a week ago to witness
the resurrection of the Stanford
Relays. The Cards had a slight
edge in the non-scoring meet,
winning five events to California's
four. San Jose State won three,
while Hay ward and San Francisco
State won one each.

Stanford Head Coach Payton
Jordan said he sees a bright future
for the Relays. He is already
making plans for next year's meet
and says that he has received
inquiries from schools such as
Oregon State and Washington
State about competing in what he
thinks might become a Northern
California showcase.
Lofton won the long jump at
24-o'4 while a team of Gregg
Densmore, Bagshaw, Carl Johnk
and Foster won the shuttle
hurdles in one minute flat.
Foster and Bagshaw returned
later in the afternoon to team
with Reggie Mason and Hogsett in
the one-mile intermediate hurdle
relay. The team walked away with
the event in 3:37.
The Cards won the 880 relay in
1:27 while Jim Bordoni, Mark
Hadley, Ben Scheible and Crowley
took the two mile relay in 7:49.4.

UPSET — Defending NCAA singles and doubles champion John
Whitlinger, shown in a match against Trinity last month, lost to
Georgia s Manuel Diaz 7-6, 6-2 in a dual meet last week. Whitlinger
and the rest of the tennis team meet USC and UCLA in a pair of
crucial matches this weekend.
Bouyed by a stand-out effort
in the high hurdles by John Foster
and an impressive win by
intermediate hurdler Matt
Hogsett, the Stanford track team
coasted to an easy 85-69 win over
outmanned Occidental College
Saturday afternoon in Stanford
Stadium.
Foster, who had to fight
gusting winds, turned in a credible
14.1 in the highs to upset
teammate Dave Bagshaw. The
transfer from Foothill Junior
College, who placed third in last
year's State JC meet, is just
recovering from a leg injury that
has hampered him for the past
few weeks. Observers say that he
is one of Stanford's brightest
hurdle prospects in quite some
time.
And that's not all Foster did.
As a last minute entrant in the
high jump, he cleared 6-6 to rack
up another first place. The leap
was two inches higher than
Foster's previous best.
Although Stanford won 11 of
18 events, most times were
unspectacular because of weather
conditions.
Hogsett Edges Out Opponent
The most interesting match-up
of the meet was in the 440
intermediate hurdles, where
Hogsett, defending Pacific Eight
champion, held off a closing
charge by Occidental's Bob Odell
to win in a time of 52.0. Odell,
who was just two-tenths of a
second behind, is the defending
NCAA Division II champion in
the intermediates.
Two new meet records were
established Saturday, including a
4a.2 in the 440 relay. Marvin
Holmes, James Lofton, Alan
