# Two Golfers: Two City Champs
## 
### 
Pat Cornett conquered final
exams in neurology, embryology,
physics and physical chemistry —
and then went on to capture the
women's crown at the San
Francisco City Golf Tournament.
And it all happened in one week.
Cornett, a junior pre-med from
Salinas, had to overcome a
four-hole disadvantage to defeat
defending champion Cheryl
Pastore 2 and 1 in the
tournament's final round eight
days ago. A week earlier, she had
defeated Margaret Leonard 6 and
5 in a semi-final match at Harding
Park.
"I didn't get to practice last
week," Cornett told the San
Francisco Examiner after her
victory over Pastore. "I didn't get
to play a single golf hole, but I got
an 'A' in my physics exam."
Pastore had a two-hole lead

after the morning round of the
finals, and widened it to four by
winning two of the first three
holes in the afternoon. It took
Cornett seven holes to catch up —
and then she promptly fell behind
again.
"A golfer generally has a
letdown after coming from behind
to even a match," Cornett told
the Examiner "and it happened to
me (in the] afternoon on the
10th hole when I finally got even.
Then I lost the next hole."
Cornett went ahead to stay on
the 16th hole, when she said
"Cheryl was good to me and put
her tee shot behind the trees to
the right of the green."
The women's golf team will
have its next outing on Thursday
and Friday of this week at the
Sun Devil Invitational
Tournament at Arizona State.

SAN FRANCISCO—Of the 400
or so galleryites watching the
finals of the San Francisco City
Golf Championships last month at
Harding Park, about 25 were
rooting for Stanford senior Dave
Baskins. Another 100 were pulling
for Frank Mazion to become the
first black golfer ever to win the
City tourney.
The rest of the gallery
consisted mainly of veteran City
golf spectators, older gentlemen
who had watched Ken Venturi,

Forrest Fezler and Johnny Miller
play in previous City tourneys.
They weren't partial to either
player, but they appreciated good
golf.
"That Mazion can really chip,"
one of them said as the golfers
moved to the 18th tee during the
morning round. "Yeah," his
friend agreed, "but the kid is
playing some of the nicest golf
I've seen in this tournament — just
as nice as Johnny Miller played."
'The kid' was five up at the
time, on his way to an easy 5 and
3 victory over Mazion. He had
birdied four of the first five holes
in the morning round en route to
a front-nine 32, and he finished
the day even par for 33 holes.
The day before, in an 8 and 7
semifinal rout over 61-year-old
Henry Suico, Baskins had toured
the Harding Park layout in one
over par.
"I just played very steady all
the way," Baskins said. "When I
woke up each morning I felt really
good — I knew I had it."
Baskins emerged as the City
champion after a four-week ordeal
that cost him over $100 in green
fees and gas money and countless
hours of potential studying time.
He was one of 64 match-play
qualifiers in a championship-flight
field of 350 (over 1800 golfers
were entered in the various
divisions) and defeated six

consecutive opponents in three
weekends of match play.
He received only token
attention from the press in the
early rounds. But in the end, the
public was finally introduced to
Dave Baskins. "The kid" had
played some really nice golf.

the day even par for 33 holes.
The day before, in an 8 and 7
semifinal rout over 61-year-old
Henry Suico, Baskins had toured
the Harding Park layout in one
over par.
"I just played very steady all
the way," Baskins said. "When I
woke up each morning I felt really
good — I knew I had it."
Baskins emerged as the City
champion after a four-week ordeal
that cost him over $100 in green
fees and gas money and countless
hours of potential studying time.
He was one of 64 match-play
qualifiers in a championship-flight
field of 350 (over 1800 golfers
were entered in the various
divisions) and defeated six

consecutive opponents in three
weekends of match play.
He received only token
attention from the press in the
early rounds. But in the end, the
public was finally introduced to
Dave Baskins. "The kid" had
played some really nice golf.

ON THE BALL — Conrad Nilmeier concentrates intensely on an
impending putt during a match against the Stanford golf alums. A
week ago, Nilmeier won the Nor Cal Masters tournament at Half
Moon Bay by eight strokes. Stanford's Dave Baskins placed second.
Pat Cornett conquered final
exams in neurology, embryology,
physics and physical chemistry —
and then went on to capture the
women's crown at the San
Francisco City Golf Tournament.
And it all happened in one week.
Cornett, a junior pre-med from
Salinas, had to overcome a
four-hole disadvantage to defeat
defending champion Cheryl
Pastore 2 and 1 in the
tournament's final round eight
days ago. A week earlier, she had
defeated Margaret Leonard 6 and
5 in a semi-final match at Harding
Park.
"I didn't get to practice last
week," Cornett told the San
Francisco Examiner after her
victory over Pastore. "I didn't get
to play a single golf hole, but I got
an 'A' in my physics exam."
Pastore had a two-hole lead

after the morning round of the
finals, and widened it to four by
winning two of the first three
holes in the afternoon. It took
Cornett seven holes to catch up —
and then she promptly fell behind
again.
"A golfer generally has a
letdown after coming from behind
to even a match," Cornett told
the Examiner "and it happened to
me (in the] afternoon on the
10th hole when I finally got even.
Then I lost the next hole."
Cornett went ahead to stay on
the 16th hole, when she said
"Cheryl was good to me and put
her tee shot behind the trees to
the right of the green."
The women's golf team will
have its next outing on Thursday
and Friday of this week at the
Sun Devil Invitational
Tournament at Arizona State.

SAN FRANCISCO—Of the 400
or so galleryites watching the
finals of the San Francisco City
Golf Championships last month at
Harding Park, about 25 were
rooting for Stanford senior Dave
Baskins. Another 100 were pulling
for Frank Mazion to become the
first black golfer ever to win the
City tourney.
The rest of the gallery
consisted mainly of veteran City
golf spectators, older gentlemen
who had watched Ken Venturi,

Forrest Fezler and Johnny Miller
play in previous City tourneys.
They weren't partial to either
player, but they appreciated good
golf.
"That Mazion can really chip,"
one of them said as the golfers
moved to the 18th tee during the
morning round. "Yeah," his
friend agreed, "but the kid is
playing some of the nicest golf
I've seen in this tournament — just
as nice as Johnny Miller played."
'The kid' was five up at the
time, on his way to an easy 5 and
3 victory over Mazion. He had
birdied four of the first five holes
in the morning round en route to
a front-nine 32, and he finished
the day even par for 33 holes.
The day before, in an 8 and 7
semifinal rout over 61-year-old
