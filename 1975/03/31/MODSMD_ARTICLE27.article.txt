# Netters Beat Georgia During Five-Day Trip
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's tennis team
returned yesterday from a
five-day working vacation in
Georgia.
Working, not only to beat the
University of Georgia 6-3, but to
finance the trip through
exhibitions and, most
importantly, to get ready for the
key matches this weekend at
UCLA and USC.
In the feature match against
Georgia Thursday, the Cards,
facing a record turnout of 4500
fans, couldn't quite duplicate
their 9-0 shellacking of the
Bulldogs in the semifinals of the
National Team Indoor
championships during February.
The Bulldogs scored an upset
victory in the featured first singles
match, where Manuel Diaz upset
defending NCAA singles
champion John Whitlinger, 7-6,
6-2. Whitlinger had easily beaten
Diaz at the National Indoors, and
was serving for set at 5-4, but was
broken. "That seemed to turn the
match around,"Coach Dick Gould
said.
The Cardinals won the
remaining five singles matches to
clinch their 20th straight match
win.
Nick Saviano, Pat Dupre and
Jim Delaney each downed a
Bulldog foe in straight sets, as
they had done in Madison. At fifth
singles, freshman Bill Maze was
breezing (7-5, 4-1) to a victory
over Delaney's brother Tim, a
Georgia freshman, when the latter
sprained his ankle and had to
retire.
Mark Mitchell won at sixth
singles to clinch the match.
The Cards, whose Achilles heel
very likely is doubles, lost two of
the three doubles matches to
Georgia. Whitlinger-Delaney,

defending NCAA doubles
champions, were defeated by Diaz
and Gordon Smith, 6-4, 6-3. The
Cardinals also lost at third
doubles, where Craig
Johnson-Maze lost a three setter.
Stanford's lone doubles win
came from Mitchell-DuPre,
playing as a team for the first time
this season, as Gould continues his
search for three winning doubles
combinations.
The lack of same wasn't fatal
at Georgia, but very likely would
be this weekend at Los Angeles,
where the top-rated Cards play
fourth-ranked USC Friday and
second-ranked UCLA Saturday.
Cardinal Notes: The Cardinals
were involved in exhibition and
pro-celebrity play Friday and
Saturday, which, along with gate
receipts from the Georgia match,
financed the trip.

champion John Whitlinger, 7-6,
6-2. Whitlinger had easily beaten
Diaz at the National Indoors, and
was serving for set at 5-4, but was
broken. "That seemed to turn the
match around,"Coach Dick Gould
said.
The Cardinals won the
remaining five singles matches to
clinch their 20th straight match
win.
Nick Saviano, Pat Dupre and
Jim Delaney each downed a
Bulldog foe in straight sets, as
they had done in Madison. At fifth
singles, freshman Bill Maze was
breezing (7-5, 4-1) to a victory
over Delaney's brother Tim, a
Georgia freshman, when the latter
sprained his ankle and had to
retire.
Mark Mitchell won at sixth
singles to clinch the match.
The Cards, whose Achilles heel
very likely is doubles, lost two of
the three doubles matches to
Georgia. Whitlinger-Delaney,

defending NCAA doubles
champions, were defeated by Diaz
and Gordon Smith, 6-4, 6-3. The
Cardinals also lost at third
doubles, where Craig
Johnson-Maze lost a three setter.
Stanford's lone doubles win
came from Mitchell-DuPre,
playing as a team for the first time
this season, as Gould continues his
search for three winning doubles
combinations.
The lack of same wasn't fatal
at Georgia, but very likely would
be this weekend at Los Angeles,
where the top-rated Cards play
fourth-ranked USC Friday and
second-ranked UCLA Saturday.
Cardinal Notes: The Cardinals
were involved in exhibition and
pro-celebrity play Friday and
Saturday, which, along with gate
receipts from the Georgia match,
financed the trip.
