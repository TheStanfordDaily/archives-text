# Nilmeier Wins At Nor Cal Masters
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Conrad Nilmeier easily won the
water-logged Northern California
Confidence Masters golf
tournament a week ago at Half
Moon Bay. And teammate Dave
Baskins placed second. Otherwise,
though, Card golfers' fortunes
over quarter break were about as
dismal as the weather they played
in.
Last Friday, the team finished
sixth at the 29th Western
Intercollegiate Tournament in
Santa Cruz — behind arch-rivals
San Jose State and USC, and
tourney leader Brigham Young.
Aly Trompas was the only
Stanford man who finished in the
top ten, shooting 221 in the
three-round tourney to place
seventh.
At the Nor Cal Masters,
Nilmeier won by eight shots,
shooting rounds of 73, 74 and 72
for a 54-hole score of 219. The
tournament had been shortened
from 72 holes because of rain at
the Half Moon Bay Golf Links on
the opening day.
Baskins shot a 227. Other
Stanford individual scores were:
seventh place finisher Mike Peck,
233; George Pettinger, 235;
Trompas, 238; and Jay Johnston,
240.
Blustery weather also
hampered at least a portion of the
competition at the Pasatiempo
golf course, site of the Western
Intercollegiates. Pettinger fired an
opening round 73 to tie for
eighth, but finished with a 54-hole

score of 227—13 shots in back of
tournament winner Mark Lye of
San Jose State.
Baskins also had a three-round
score of 227. Nilmeier finished at
228, while Johnston and Peck
both shot 237.
Brigham Young captured its
fourth team title at the Western
Intercollegiates since 1968, when
Johnny Miller was the Cougars'
No. 1 player. BYU finished at 890
this year, one stroke ahead of
defending champion Arizona
State.
San Jose State finished third,
shooting 894. The Cards had lost
to the Spartans 18-9 in a dual
match earlier this month. Other
leading finishers included San
Diego State, 898; USC, 901; and
Stanford 903.
Baskins noted that, "In the
Intercollegiates, we were quite
disappointed. We played well
below our abilities. The team had
two lousy rounds — if we had
scored the same way we did on
the last day,"he added, "we
would have won by five strokes."
He also said he thought that
both he and Nilmeier had
"wanted to win too much," and
that this might have been part of
the reason for their somewhat
disappointing performances.
The Cards travel to Santa
Barbara's Sandpiper Golf Course
this Thursday and Friday for the
Pacific Coast Invitational
tournament, in which they placed
third last year. Teams expected to
participate in the tourney include
Arizona State, San Diego State,
USC and Long Beach State.
