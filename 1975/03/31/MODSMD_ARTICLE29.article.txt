# Ruggers Finish 26th At Monterey Tourney
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
The Stanford rugby squad
ended one of its most
discouraging seasons ever with a
disappointing 26th place finish in
the Monterey National Rugby
Tournament March 22 and 23.
The Cards won just two out of
their five contests in the 17th
annual tourney.
"Monterey sort of confirmed
our season," Coach Pete Kmetovic
said. "We just didn't have it this
year."

In their first contest against the
Monterey Rugby Club, the ruggers
had trouble adjusting to the 8
a.m. starting time, and lost 12-0
on four penalty kicks.
The Cards got going in their
second game against the River
Rats, tying 4-4, but the Rats won
the game in a kicking contest. The
loss was especially costly though,
because an injury sidelined the
Cards' captain and leading scorer,
Lawrie Lieberman, for the
remainder of the tournament.
The rest of the tournament was
anti-climactic for Stanford. The
ruggers downed hapless
Washington State 22-0 and UC-
Davis 4-0, but by then, they were
already out of the running for the
tournament crown.
Although his own ruggers
didn't win the Tournament, there
was still a bright spot for
Kmetovic. Many rugby enthusiasts
have called Kmetovic one of the
best molders of rugby talent in
the state. His former players are
playing on many of the top
college and club teams in the
nation.
Well, one of those players,
Wade Killefer, led UCLA to its
first Monterey crown. Killefer,
who was on the Stanford squad
which won the tournament from
1968 to 1971, led the Bruins to a
10-7 upset over tournament
favorite Santa Monica Rugby
Club.
