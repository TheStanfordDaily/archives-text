# Court Rules Against Davis Med School
## Reverse Bias Declared Illegal 
### JIM WASCHER First Of Two Parts 
A Superior Court judge in Yolo
County last month formally ruled that
the University of California's quota
system for minority admissions at the
UC-Davis Medical School is
unconstitutional.
Observers believe that the case,
Bakke v.the Regents of the University
of California, has an excellent chance
to reach the U.S. Supreme Court on
appeal.
The High Court has never
considered whether so-called "reverse
discrimination" against whites violates

their 14th Amendment rights to equal
protection under the law.
The plaintiff in the case, Sunnyvale
engineer Allan Bakke, was rejected by
the UC-Davis Medical School in both
1973 and 1974, and contended in his
lawsuit against that university that
"the sole reason his applications were
rejected was on account of his race."
UC-Davis has a special admissions
committee which considers
applications for 16 out of the 100
places available in each entering
medical school class. These 16
openings are reserved for students
from what the University calls
"economically and/or educationally
disadvantaged backgrounds."
The University alleged that
"minority group status" was only
"one factor in determining relative
disadvantage."
No White Students
However, in the opinion which he
handed down last month, Judge F.
Leslie Manker noted that, "In fact, no
white student has been admitted under
this program since its inception in
1969. In practice this special
admissions program is open only to
members of minority races and
members of the white race are barred
from participation therein."
Consequently, Manker wrote, the
Davis Medical School "discriminated
against plaintiff by reason of his race,
and in the use of a quota in favor of
certain minority or ethnic groups, thus
violating plaintiffs rights under" the
U.S. and California constitutions and
the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Because the judge believed that
Bakke "would not have been accepted
for admission [either time he applied]
even if there had been no special
admissions program," he declined to
order that Bakke be admitted.
Anti-Discrimination Ruling
However, Manker did rule that "the
plaintiff is entitled to have his
application considered without regard
to his race or the race of any other
applicant."
UC General Counsel Donald L.
Reidhaar told the Daily last week that
the University had filed a notice of
appeal in the state appeals court.
But Reidhaar also noted that "it is
possible for the State Supreme Court
to take the case directly, without a
ruling from the appeals court."
The general counsel said the
University is currently considering
whether to petition the state Supreme
Court to take up the Bakke case in this
manner. He added that he and his staff
expect to make a final decision some
time this month.

While Reidhaar noted that "it is
very difficult to speculate about the
chances," he said, "I would not be at
all surprised if the Bakke case reached
the United States Supreme Court."
The High Court refused to decide a
similar case last year. A Washington
State judge had overturned a minority
admissions quota system at the
University of Washington Law School
and had ordered Marco DeFunis
admitted there.
The State Supreme Court overruled
the judge, but DeFunis remained in
law school and was within months of
graduation by the time his case
reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The
Court ruled that the imminence of his
graduation made the controversy in
the case moot.
However, Reidhaar pointed out
that Judge Manker's decision not to
order Bakke admitted to the Davis
Medical School "avoided the mootness
problem" and improved the chances
for the case to be considered by the
Supreme Court.

Stanford admissions.)
