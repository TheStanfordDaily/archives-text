Haldeman: Problems Of Nixon's Term
NEW YORK — Former President Richard Nixon
discussed the possibility of appointing John B. Connaily as
vice president long before scandal touched Spiro T. Agnew,
according to H.R. Haldeman, former White House chief of
staff, in the second of a two-part CBS interview broadcast
yesterday.
Haldeman said that Nixon discussed the issue with him
because Agnew was frustrated and thinking of resigning
during his first term.
Unlike last week's show, which largely dwelt on the
Watergate tapes, this edition covered a far wider range, with
Haldeman saying:
— Secretary of State Henry Kissinger threatened to quit
"quite a few" times, "some major times and some mihor
times," while he was Nixon's chief national security adviser.
— He thought W. Mark Felt, a former high FBI official,
was "Deep Throat," the mysterious Watergate source for
Washington Post newsmen Carl Bernstein and Robert
Woodward. Felt later denied he was the man.
As in the last show, Haldeman insisted he was innocent
of the Watergate cover-up, but this time gave a rare hint of
his personal torment when asked if he'd ever considered
pleading guilty just to get it over with and start anew
afterwards.
Yes, replied Haldeman, who is appealing his conviction.
He said he has run up a $400,000 legal tab for his Watergate
defense, and it's "a mortgage on the rest of my earnings for
the rest of my life."
Ford's Tax Cut Approval Lauded
WASHINGTON — President Ford's conclusion that the
need for a tax cut outweighed the defects of the tax bill he
signed Saturday was "the right thing" according to top
congressional Democrats.
Ford signed the $24.8 billion tax cut measure into law
during a national broadcast address Saturday night, but said
he will try to clamp a lid on government spending to hold
down the deficit.
The bill provides a variety of tax changes and reductions
with the most immediate effect a rebate of $100 to $200
on 1974 taxes for most Americans. The first checks are
expected to go out in early May.
Ford was critical of several provisions of the measure but
said he was signing it because of "the urgent necessity of an
anti-recession tax cut right now."
In January he had asked for a smaller cut aimed more at
middle income taxpayers, and he noted Saturday that this
law "fails to give adequate relief to the millions of
middle-income taxpayers who already contribute the
biggest share of federal taxes."
The measure is aimed to give the largest refunds to lower
and middle income persons, with incomes up to $20,000.
Ford's action drew praise from both Sen. Russell Long
(D-La.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and
Rep. A 1 Ullman (D-Ore.), chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee.
Sadat Announcement Criticized
TEL AVIV — Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin said
yesterday that Israel would take as a "negative indication"
Egypt's announced refusal to extend the mandate of U.N.

peacekeeping forces in the Sinai Desert for more than three
months.
Rabin was displeased at Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's announcement in Cairo on Saturday that he will
renew the U.N. peace force's mandate for only three
months, rather than the six-month periods the peacekeepers
have been given by the U.N. Security Council until now.
"The maintenance of the U.N. forces in their present
form is part of the overall framework of the disengagement
agreements" separating Israeli and Egyptian troops, Rabin
said in Israel's first official comment on Sadat's speech.
"Israel will regard as a negative indication the
non-renewal of the U.N. forces' mandate, or the alteration
of its timespan."
Rabin said it was "vital that the United States pursue its
peace-seeking efforts in the Middle East."
Rabin's statement, at a special cabinet session in
Jerusalem, ignored Sadat's announcement that he would
reopen the Suez Canal on June 5 after an eight-year
shutdown.
The Suez Canal Authority yesterday ordered 24-hour
shifts for its employees to ready the 103-mile waterway for
traffic and said transit tolls would be increased 50 percent
because of inflation. Tolls in 1967 were about $1 per ton
for loaded vessels and 45 cents for unloaded vessels.
Oil Profiteering Investigators Argue
WASHINGTON — Government investigators of alleged
oil company profiteering at the height of the Arab oil
embargo are fighting among themselves over whether to
seek criminal indictments, according to sources close to the
case.
The U.S. Customs Service wants the cases criminally
prosecuted, the sources said, but the Federal Energy
Administration (FEA) is arguing that the matter should be
pursued through administrative channels.
The Justice Department reportedly is caught in the
middle but so far has sided with customs.
FEA lawyers say published reports that oil companies
may have overcharged U.S. consumers by billions of dollars
are gross exaggerations without evidence to support them.
According to tabulations Saturday, the FEA has forced
the oil industry to give back some $612 million through
refunds, price rollbacks or cancellation of claims on future
price hikes.
Investigators say the industry may have cheated the
public out of $861 million or more since the Arab oil
embargo.
The probe is going on in several cities, but only one case
— in Jacksonville, Fla. — so far has reached the stage of
being presented to a grand jury.
The Customs Service says the joint Customs-FEA
investigation began last August and was focused on residual
fuel oil imported chiefly through East Coast ports. A majoir
portion of the residual fuel oil brought into this country is
used by public utilities.
Today's Weather
