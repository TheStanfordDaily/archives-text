# Parking Report Suggests Priorities, Higher Fees
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
A recently circulated report
recommends that bicyclists and
pedestrians be given clear priority over
cars on campus, with fees of $12 to
$15 per quarter charged drivers and
motorcyclists for convenient campus
parking.
The report, "Recommended
Parking and Transportation Policies
for Stanford University" was prepared
by Peter F. Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, and
submitted to the University last
Monday following nearly five months
of research.
The study suggests three principal
parking zones.
An "Academic Zone,"
encompassing most of the central
campus, would require parking by
permit only. An Academic Zone
permit would cost $15 per quarter.
Priority for purchase of these
permits would rank from faculty (i.e.
members of the Academic Council), to
staff, to off-campus students to
on-campus students. On-campus
students who purchase a "Residence
Zone" permit also would be required
to purchase an Academic Zone permit
to park in that area.
'Residence Zones'
A permit for a "Residence Zone"
parking lot would cost $12 per quarter
for the first car, and $24 per quarter
for a second car.
The Residence Zones include the
areas surrounding student residences,
the Pearce Mitchell houses and a
"sufficiently large buffer zone" to
control street parking in this area.
Carpenter's report also recommends
that all cars operating on campus be
registered for identification purposes
at no charge. This free registration
sticker would be required for a vehicle
to park anywhere on campus.
Vehicles displaying only a

registration sticker would be allowed
to park in a "Free Zone." These areas
would be located near the stadium, the
Campus Shell station, the medical
school, the hospital, Jordan Quad and
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The Inner Quad would be known as
the "Vehicle Exclusion Zone." No
parking would be allowed there,
except by the president and the
provost.
'Hunting License'
Carpenter's recommendations call
for a 30-30-40 breakdown of the
University's 13,000 parking spaces
into Free, Residence and Academic
Zones, respectively. Ten percent of the
Academic Zone's spaces would be
regulated by parking meters at a price
of 25 cents per hour or $1 per day.
Carpenter explained that a parking
permit would not constitute a

guaranteed parking place, but more of
a "hunting license." Spaces would be
oversold by 40 percent in the
Academic Zone and 20 percent in the
Residential Zone.
As a deterrent against illegal
parking, the report recommends that
fines be increased from $2 to $10 per
violation.
"A lot of schools have stricter
solutions than a $10 parking fine,"
Carpenter noted. "At Yale, they
simply tow away illegally parked cars
daily, with no notice.
"But the degree of compliance
there is fantastic," he added.
Money Goes To Fund
The report proposes that money
collected from the parking fees go into
a Parking and Transportation Trust
Fund. This fund would be used to
finance police enforcement, some
maintenance of parking lots and
streets, better lighting for walkways,
improvement of bike paths and other
alternate means of transportation,
such as shuttle buses.
"This was the biggest complaint I
heard," Carpenter noted. "Everyone
felt it was unfair that parking fees pay
for new buildings and such."
"What we have now is a subsidized
system. Through tuition, which is
funneled into the general fund,
non-drivers are forced to help pay for
parking lots and other amenities that
only drivers benefit from. With a trust
fund, these things are financed directly
by drivers."
Carpenter said that his
recommendations are based on eight
public hearings held during winter

quarter, meetings with "specific
people of responsibility," a
questionnaire sent to faculty, staff,
students and other universities.
According to Provost and Acting
President William Miller, the
Committee on Land and Building
Development will serve as the
University-wide focal point for
discussion of the report and
solicitation of views among faculty,
staff and students.
The University's vice presidents are
expected to consider the
recommendations of that committee
in l either the last week of April or the
first week of May, said Miller. Their
suggestions are scheduled to come
before President Richard Lyman by
the end of spring quarter.
If ratified, the new parking policy
would be implemented next fall.
