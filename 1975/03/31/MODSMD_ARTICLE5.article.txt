# Police Check New Leads In Local Murder Cases

### PHILIP FEDER 
Police officials have reopened the
investigation into the murders of Janet
Taylor and Leslie Perlov, found
strangled in the Stanford foothills in
1973 and 1974, with the discovery of
letters, newspaper clippings and a
photograph in a Marin County home,
the Palo Alto Times reported last
week.
According to the Times, residents
of a "commune-type" home in Mill
Valley told police that personal
belongings left behind by another
resident included newspaper stories of
Taylor's slaying last year and a
photograph believed to be of her.
San Mateo County Sheriff's Lt.
Richard Piatt said recent information
indicates the missing man may be in
Colorado. He is believed to be in his
mid-20s and a former resident of
Menlo Park. The suspect's name has
not been revealed.
Link To Rocky Murder?
Authorities also found letters in the
Mill Valley home concerning the
murder of Barbara Rocky, a Menlo
Park resident slain in Utah.
Rocky, a Menlo-Atherton high
school graduate, was sexually assaulted
and shot six times. Her body was
found March 12, 1974, near Salt Lake
City, where she was attending Brigham
Young University.
Rudy Siemssen, homicide inspector
for the San Mateo County Sheriff's
office, told the Times, "My guess is
that the girls and this guy all knew
each other at high school."
Siemssen stressed the man may not
be involved in the slayings, but simply

may have known Taylor, Perlov and
Rocky.
Letter A Clue?
One of the letters found in the Mill
Valley home read in part, "Something
always happens to my girl friends,"
Siemssen said.
Commune residents also told of
comments made by the man about
Taylor, police said.
Perlov received a B.A. in history
here in 1972. Taylor was the daughter
of former Athletic Director Charles
(Chuck) Taylor. Both victims were
strangled, were found with their shoes
off and purses missing, and both had
been on campus just prior to their
deaths. Neither woman was sexually
molested.
The material found in the Mill
Valley home does not refer specifically
to Perlov, but authorities have long
suspected a connection between the
two murders.
Connection Uncertain
Mill Valley Police Lt. Robert Sisk
told the Times, "We're not sure if
there is any real connection, it's just
some of the things he [the commune
resident] said. The newspaper clips are
about the murder and the photograph
looks like the Taylor girl."
Perlov was found dead on Feb. 16,
1973 on a wooded hill of the campus
near Old Page Mill Road and Foothill
Expressway. Taylor's body was found
on March 26, 1974 in a roadside ditch
on Sand Hill Road near Manzanita
Way, about three miles from campus.
No warrant has been issued for the
man's arrest by either San Mateo
County or Mill Valley authorities.
