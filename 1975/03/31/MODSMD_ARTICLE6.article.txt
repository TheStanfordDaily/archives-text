SEEING RED - Former Gov.
Ronald Reagan smiles for
photographers as he holds a
Hoover Institution first-edition
copy of the 'Communist
Manifesto.' Reagan dropped in
for a few hours during Monday
of finals week to check out the
facilities where his
gubernatorial papers will be
stored. In an impromptu press
conference held in the stacks
of the Lou Henry Hoover
Building, Reagan was quizzed
about charges made by Gov.
Edmund G. Brown Jr. about
irregularities in the state welfare
system and MediCal. One
reporter asked Reagan if,
should he be elected president,
he would donate his
administration's documents to
the Hoover Institution. Reagan
dismissed the question.
