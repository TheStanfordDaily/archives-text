## On Distribution 
### 
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US) will
probably recommend early this quarter that University
distribution requirements be made more stringent. We
oppose such a change.
Undergraduates are currently required to take three
courses of at least three units each in the areas of humanities
and fine arts; social sciences; and mathematics, natural
sciences and technology. Under the C-US plan, the number
of courses required would remain the same, but the options
within each area would be limited.
The biggest and most unwise change is in the area of
humanities. If the C-US plan were adopted, music
performance, studio art, creative writing and first-year
foreign language courses could no longer be counted toward
the distribution requirement.
We think that these courses, as much as any others in the
area of humanities, are valuable to the student. Because of
other requirements, many students cannot take more than
three humanities courses. We see no reason to arbitrarily
eliminate their opportunity to take certain courses.
It can be argued that first-year foreign language courses
can be taken by students who already have a knowledge of
that language, and are merely using the course to circumvent
the distribution requirement. We do not approve of such
evasion, but think it would be ridiculously condescending
for the University to baby-sit students to take the "right"
courses in an area.
We favor maintaining the present system because it
encourages students to look outside their own special fields
without having the University hold their hands by restricting
their choice of courses.
Certain courses do not fit the particular academic
grouping in which the parent department is officially
located. We recognize this difficulty, but think that every
course offered by a regular academic department should
fulfill the distribution requirement in at least one of the
three areas of study.
If a department wishes to classify any course in an area
which differs from its usual one, it should be allowed to do
so, provided it explicitly publicizes this discrepancy in
Courses and Degrees.
