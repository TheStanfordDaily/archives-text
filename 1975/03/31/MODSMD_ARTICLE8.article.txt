# UFW Misinforms

A number of articles and
letters to the editor have recently
appeared in the Stanford Daily
stating the United Farm Workers'
position in the boycott of Gallo
products. Knowing that the Daily
believes in an unbiased
presentation of all the facts, I now
present the Gallo position in this
jurisdictional dispute between the
Teamsters and the United Farm
Workers (UFW) unions.
There is a serious farm labor
problem in this country, but it is
not in the Gallo vineyards. The
200 year-round and 300 seasonal
farm workers at Gallo are
represented by one of the
strongest unions in America. They
are the highest-paid farm workers
in the continental United States.
They have the best package' of
company-paid fringe benefits of
any farm workers.
The serious problem is
elsewhere. United Farm Workers
Support Committee on the
Stanford campus perhaps is not
aware of the fact that there are
more than two million American
farm workers who belong to no
union and who are earning
less—most of them much
less—than the 500 Gallo unionized
farm workers. These are America's
forgotten farm laborers, working
in one of our most essential, if not
the most essential, occupations,
frequently under conditions and
for wages that are a disgrace to us
all.
While the rest of American
labor has forged steadily ahead in
the last 40 years, these forgotten
men and women of every ethnic
background have virtually stood
still—in real income, educational
advancement and political power.
Were it not for the national
minimum wage law, which has
served to keep them barely above
the poverty level when they work,
and on welfare when they don't,
these two million would be worse
off than their counterparts four
decades ago.
UFW President Cesar Chavez
and his supporters, over the past
20 months, have ignored this fact
and continued to picket Gallo,
boycott Gallo, and now march on
Gallo, all with the stated purpose
of initiating an election among the
Gallo farm workers who have the
best package of wage and fringe
benefits, far exceeding other farm
workers in the continental United
States. The United Farm Workers
know better; however, they
continue with their rhetoric, their
posters, and their pamphlets to
ignore the core issue — that Gallo
farm workers are in the union of
their own choosing.
Through coercive tactics.
United Farm Worker supporters
have attempted to blackmail
Peninsula retailers into removing

union-made wine from their store
shelves. The United Farm
Workers, therefore, is guilty of a
form of hateful, prior censorship
abridging on the rights of both
retailers and the public from
expressing an opinion (for or
against) by buying or not buying
Gallo products. Prior censorship,
in any form, cannot be condoned,
be it by self-appointed censors of
books, movies, pictures,
union-made wines, or presidential
tapes.
The United Farm Workers
know that Gallo cannot break
its contract with the Teamsters,
just as Gallo cannot break its
contract with the three AFL-CIO
unions representing more than
2000 other Gallo workers, and
could not have broken its contract
with the United Farm Workers
when they were the union
representing Gallo farm workers
from 1967 to 1973. The United
Farm Workers knows that if Gallo
yielded to its demands, Gallo
would violate its contract with the
Teamsters and become subject to
strikes, lawsuits, and possible
boycotts.

The United Farm Workers
know that Gallo cannot break
its contract with the Teamsters,
just as Gallo cannot break its
contract with the three AFL-CIO
unions representing more than
2000 other Gallo workers, and
could not have broken its contract
with the United Farm Workers
when they were the union
representing Gallo farm workers
from 1967 to 1973. The United
Farm Workers knows that if Gallo
yielded to its demands, Gallo
would violate its contract with the
Teamsters and become subject to
strikes, lawsuits, and possible
boycotts.

A number of articles and
letters to the editor have recently
appeared in the Stanford Daily
stating the United Farm Workers'
position in the boycott of Gallo
products. Knowing that the Daily
believes in an unbiased
presentation of all the facts, I now
present the Gallo position in this
jurisdictional dispute between the
Teamsters and the United Farm
Workers (UFW) unions.
There is a serious farm labor
problem in this country, but it is
not in the Gallo vineyards. The
200 year-round and 300 seasonal
farm workers at Gallo are
represented by one of the
strongest unions in America. They
are the highest-paid farm workers
in the continental United States.
They have the best package' of
company-paid fringe benefits of
any farm workers.
The serious problem is
elsewhere. United Farm Workers
Support Committee on the
Stanford campus perhaps is not
aware of the fact that there are
more than two million American
farm workers who belong to no
union and who are earning
less—most of them much
less—than the 500 Gallo unionized
farm workers. These are America's
forgotten farm laborers, working
in one of our most essential, if not
the most essential, occupations,
frequently under conditions and
for wages that are a disgrace to us
all.
While the rest of American
labor has forged steadily ahead in
the last 40 years, these forgotten
men and women of every ethnic
background have virtually stood
still—in real income, educational
advancement and political power.
Were it not for the national
minimum wage law, which has
served to keep them barely above
the poverty level when they work,
and on welfare when they don't,
these two million would be worse
off than their counterparts four
decades ago.
UFW President Cesar Chavez
and his supporters, over the past
20 months, have ignored this fact
and continued to picket Gallo,
boycott Gallo, and now march on
Gallo, all with the stated purpose
of initiating an election among the
Gallo farm workers who have the
best package of wage and fringe
benefits, far exceeding other farm
workers in the continental United
States. The United Farm Workers
know better; however, they
continue with their rhetoric, their
posters, and their pamphlets to
ignore the core issue — that Gallo
farm workers are in the union of
their own choosing.
Through coercive tactics.
United Farm Worker supporters
have attempted to blackmail
Peninsula retailers into removing

union-made wine from their store
shelves. The United Farm
Workers, therefore, is guilty of a
form of hateful, prior censorship
abridging on the rights of both
retailers and the public from
expressing an opinion (for or
against) by buying or not buying
Gallo products. Prior censorship,
in any form, cannot be condoned,
be it by self-appointed censors of
books, movies, pictures,
union-made wines, or presidential
tapes.
