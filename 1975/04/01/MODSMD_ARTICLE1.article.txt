# Scher May Continue Concerts

### ANN AMIOKA VLAE KERSHNER 
ASSU Special Events Director
Danny Scher has been hired by San
Francisco rock promoter Bill Graham,
but may continue producing concerts
at Stanford for either the ASSU, the
University, or both.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
told the ASSU Senate last night that
Scher's services will be available to the
University for a flat fee on an
individual concert basis. The Senate
then voted unanimously to have its
finance committee look into the
possibility of making some contract
agreement with Scher.
The University's Public Events
Office, which is separate from ASSU
Special Events, has already tentatively
hired Scher to produce a Loggins &
Messina concert July 5. Public Events
Director Tom Bacchetti said last night
that this "was about as firm as it can
be without a contract " having been
signed.
'Tentative Talking Stage'
Bacchetti also said that the
University was "in the tentative
talking stage," with Scher about
producing more concerts.
ASSU officials have been concerned
about Scher working for the
University, since any rock concerts he
produces might cut into the revenues
of ASSU Special Events. Both
Bacchetti and Mayer, however,
expressed hope that the two
organizations would work something
out.
At the Senate meeting, ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
objected to any arrangement splitting
concert revenues between Scher,
FM Productions and the
University. Bacchetti said, however,
that Scher would be acting as a "free
agent" — not for Graham — in
producing the Loggins & Messina
concert.
Contract Signed
According to Mayer, Scher signed a
contract with Graham March 25, but
will continue to be ASSU Special
Events director until his term expires
in June. At that point, a yet-unnamed
student will take over as special events
director. Scher was unavailable for
comment.
A part time ASSU financial
manager, Chris Cline, will be hired
