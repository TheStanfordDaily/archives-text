# On Beutelsbach Phaseout
## 
### 
On Jan. 29 it was reported in
the Daily that a student member
of the Committee on Foreign
Studies Programs, commenting on
the Committee's "preliminary
tendencies," stated that "I would
say that almost certainly
Beutelsbach will be out."
If such preliminary tendencies
have developed in the Committee's
deliberations, the basis for them
has not been communicated to
the Stanford-in-Germany faculty
and students. To the contrary, the
Overseas Study office has made it
clear that no decisions have been
made concerning what programs
will be phased out and that when
they are made they will be based
on objective (and presumably
open) criteria. It is most
unfortunate that such damaging
and premature judgments or
tendencies exist, if they do, and
that they should be expressed in
such a casual manner whether
they exist or not.
Stanford in Weinstadt-
Beutelsbach is going strong.
The new facilities in the heart of
town are excellent, with ample

classroom space, offices, and a
library selected by Stanford
faculty over a period of 16 years
very appropriately housed in the
former Beutelsbacher Bank. The
move to the new quarters, a
Herculean task, was accomplished
with great efficiency in an
amazing short period of time.
Morale High
faculty morale is strong,
though understandably somewhat
battered by what appear to be
death sentences for undeclared
reasons. The students are housed
in various locations about town,
prepare their own food, and in
general live about like most other
people in town do. They express a
high level of satisfaction with the
academic program, with their
cultural explorations, with the
language program, and with their
living accommodations. I hesitate
to make comparisons but feel that
the morale among students is
higher this quarter than it has
been in almost any of the six
other times I have been at
Stanford-in-Germany.
The program this quarter has

George Spindler

provided, in addition to the focus
upon accelerated language
learning, an unprecedented and
intense exploration of both
regional culture in its everyday
dimensions and the fine arts
culture of ballet, opera,
symphony and theater. The
Remstal, within which
Weinstadt-Beutelsbach is located,
is extraordinarily interesting
because of its regional
Schwaebisch culture, the
extremely rapid urbanization it is
undergoing and its status as one
of the great centers for the fine
arts in Central Europe.
The location in Beutelsbach
has also assured us of an
unparalleled family program. This
means intimate, frequent contact
with the people who live here.
On any objective basis,
Stanford-in-Weinstadt-Beutelsbach
is doing fine and any talk of
phasing it out seems grossly out of
focus from over here.

of anthropology and education at
Stanford-in-Germany during

Stanford-in-Germany during
winter quarter.)
On Jan. 29 it was reported in
the Daily that a student member
of the Committee on Foreign
Studies Programs, commenting on
the Committee's "preliminary
tendencies," stated that "I would
say that almost certainly
Beutelsbach will be out."
If such preliminary tendencies
have developed in the Committee's
deliberations, the basis for them
has not been communicated to
the Stanford-in-Germany faculty
and students. To the contrary, the
Overseas Study office has made it
clear that no decisions have been
made concerning what programs
will be phased out and that when
they are made they will be based
on objective (and presumably
open) criteria. It is most
unfortunate that such damaging
and premature judgments or
tendencies exist, if they do, and
that they should be expressed in
such a casual manner whether
they exist or not.
Stanford in Weinstadt-
Beutelsbach is going strong.
The new facilities in the heart of
town are excellent, with ample

classroom space, offices, and a
library selected by Stanford
faculty over a period of 16 years
very appropriately housed in the
former Beutelsbacher Bank. The
move to the new quarters, a
Herculean task, was accomplished
with great efficiency in an
amazing short period of time.
Morale High
faculty morale is strong,
though understandably somewhat
battered by what appear to be
death sentences for undeclared
reasons. The students are housed
in various locations about town,
prepare their own food, and in
general live about like most other
people in town do. They express a
high level of satisfaction with the
academic program, with their
cultural explorations, with the
language program, and with their
living accommodations. I hesitate
to make comparisons but feel that
the morale among students is
higher this quarter than it has
been in almost any of the six
other times I have been at
Stanford-in-Germany.
The program this quarter has

provided, in addition to the focus
upon accelerated language
learning, an unprecedented and
intense exploration of both
regional culture in its everyday
dimensions and the fine arts
culture of ballet, opera,
symphony and theater. The
Remstal, within which
Weinstadt-Beutelsbach is located,
is extraordinarily interesting
because of its regional
Schwaebisch culture, the
extremely rapid urbanization it is
undergoing and its status as one
of the great centers for the fine
arts in Central Europe.
The location in Beutelsbach
has also assured us of an
unparalleled family program. This
means intimate, frequent contact
with the people who live here.
On any objective basis,
Stanford-in-Weinstadt-Beutelsbach
is doing fine and any talk of
phasing it out seems grossly out of
focus from over here.
