## Step Right Up! For Just $25... 
### 
It was with great enthusiasm that I opened
a letter from Stanford University the other
day. Such a pleasant switch from bills and
rejection slips (but such is the life of the
freelance writer).
You may or may not be aware of the
GIFT CATALOG which was recently sent to
alumni. It listed various things that a $25,
$50, $100 or even $3400 contribution could
bring to the University. I pored over a few
of the selections with rusty academic
acumen....
For a mere $25, I found out that I could
"culture an organism for study in water
microbiology." I decided against this on
moral grounds. I think that if the organism
lacks culture when it first comes to Stanford,
it is not up to the school to socially
rehabilitate the pathetic thing.
Swim Suits
I also found that $25 could buy five swim
suits for the men's team, or one warm-up suit
for the women's. Now this must be a very
big warm-up suit, or I don't see how the
women's team is going to fit into it at all. I
also had to turn this one down on the
grounds of sex discrimination.
Moving into the liberal arts, I found that a
mere $25 would "give the Art Department
ten Leonardos (color transparencies)." Now,
I wouldn't object to paying $25 for ten real
Leonardos (that's a mere $2.50 per
Leonardo) but I'm not going to shell out my
money for cheap imitations. Either give
Stanford students the real thing, or nothing
at all. Let's not compromise our aesthetic
beliefs everywhere!

My last chance for a $25 gift was to buy
two glassware burettes or pipettes for
students. Now I don't mind if you guys want
to eat Mexican food, but why in the hell do
you have to eat it off glassware?
Tuition Rebates
When I found that $50 could buy two-and
two-thirds days' tuition to a student, I
thought I saw my chance. Maybe I could get
a rebate on the 24.75 classes I missed while
in school due to disease, sickness, famine,
fatigue. (Never take on an 8:00 class.) Then I
could hand my rebate over to a student, if he
promised not to sleep, get sick, or have a
famine.
There were also gift categories in the $100
and $3400 categories (not leaving much for
middle-cash America), but since huge figures
always give me vertigo, I grabbed an aspirin
and overlooked these two. Though all the
gifts seemed worthwhile, the financially
p u shy - pully -cost-plus-plus-minus-divided-by
taxed-unemployed-shaky-waky-rock-n-rolly
state of our economy precludes me at this
point in time from giving something for
nothing. 8ut....
Perhaps a reciprocative system could be
worked out between students and alumni.
For example, what alumnus in his right mind
would not give his eye teeth for a case of
Coors beer? You must remember, some states
are not graced with the Rocky Mountain
spring water like California. Now if an
alumnus sent in $25 to heat and light a
classroom for 100 hours, why can't the
students send him a case of six-pack of the
Official Undergraduate Elixir? Or a nice

Rod Koon

Stanford T-shirt, sweater or ashtray?
Or if a former member of the Stanford
community sends in $100 to provide an
undergraduate with a week's tuition, why not
send the generous soul a shaving from a
Stanford goal post? Or just paint a Popsicle
stick white, he'll never know. Or perhaps a
season's pass to the Sunday flicks, or a pair
of faded jeans actually broken in by
real Stanford students! You must
remember that businesses don't take kindly
to young executives wearing jeans, so they're
harder to break in once you get out of
school.
Now I will be the first to admit that my
idea is only in the planning stages. Much lies
ahead, but hope is there. For now, I am
graciusly setting up my living quarters as
headquarters for Operation Reciprocity. I
will anxiously await contributions such a?
Coors beer, Stanford T-shirts, faded jeans
(size 32-30 only please!) or whatever else
you might deem fitting. But please, no
painted Popsicle sticks!
Though some students and alumni might
be reluctant to join in with this operation, we
should try to remember that what is good for
the goose is good to philander.
Please send all paraphernalia to Rod
Koon, Tacoma Wash. 98406. No stamps,
please!
Let me thank the fourth estate in advance
for getting my message out to the people.

point in time from giving something for
nothing. 8ut....
Perhaps a reciprocative system could be
worked out between students and alumni.
For example, what alumnus in his right mind
would not give his eye teeth for a case of
Coors beer? You must remember, some states
are not graced with the Rocky Mountain
spring water like California. Now if an
alumnus sent in $25 to heat and light a
classroom for 100 hours, why can't the
students send him a case of six-pack of the
Official Undergraduate Elixir? Or a nice

Rod Koon

Stanford T-shirt, sweater or ashtray?
Or if a former member of the Stanford
community sends in $100 to provide an
undergraduate with a week's tuition, why not
send the generous soul a shaving from a
Stanford goal post? Or just paint a Popsicle
stick white, he'll never know. Or perhaps a
season's pass to the Sunday flicks, or a pair
of faded jeans actually broken in by
real Stanford students! You must
remember that businesses don't take kindly
to young executives wearing jeans, so they're
harder to break in once you get out of
school.
Now I will be the first to admit that my
idea is only in the planning stages. Much lies
ahead, but hope is there. For now, I am
graciusly setting up my living quarters as
headquarters for Operation Reciprocity. I
will anxiously await contributions such a?
Coors beer, Stanford T-shirts, faded jeans
(size 32-30 only please!) or whatever else
you might deem fitting. But please, no
painted Popsicle sticks!
Though some students and alumni might
be reluctant to join in with this operation, we
should try to remember that what is good for
the goose is good to philander.
Please send all paraphernalia to Rod
Koon, Tacoma Wash. 98406. No stamps,
please!
Let me thank the fourth estate in advance
for getting my message out to the people.
(Rod Koon, a member of the Class of 1974,
is a freelance writer living in Tacoma, Wash.)
It was with great enthusiasm that I opened
a letter from Stanford University the other
day. Such a pleasant switch from bills and
rejection slips (but such is the life of the
freelance writer).
You may or may not be aware of the
GIFT CATALOG which was recently sent to
alumni. It listed various things that a $25,
$50, $100 or even $3400 contribution could
bring to the University. I pored over a few
of the selections with rusty academic
acumen....
For a mere $25, I found out that I could
"culture an organism for study in water
microbiology." I decided against this on
moral grounds. I think that if the organism
lacks culture when it first comes to Stanford,
it is not up to the school to socially
rehabilitate the pathetic thing.
Swim Suits
I also found that $25 could buy five swim
suits for the men's team, or one warm-up suit
for the women's. Now this must be a very
big warm-up suit, or I don't see how the
women's team is going to fit into it at all. I
also had to turn this one down on the
grounds of sex discrimination.
Moving into the liberal arts, I found that a
mere $25 would "give the Art Department
ten Leonardos (color transparencies)." Now,
I wouldn't object to paying $25 for ten real
Leonardos (that's a mere $2.50 per
Leonardo) but I'm not going to shell out my
money for cheap imitations. Either give
Stanford students the real thing, or nothing
at all. Let's not compromise our aesthetic
beliefs everywhere!

My last chance for a $25 gift was to buy
two glassware burettes or pipettes for
students. Now I don't mind if you guys want
to eat Mexican food, but why in the hell do
you have to eat it off glassware?
Tuition Rebates
When I found that $50 could buy two-and
two-thirds days' tuition to a student, I
thought I saw my chance. Maybe I could get
a rebate on the 24.75 classes I missed while
in school due to disease, sickness, famine,
fatigue. (Never take on an 8:00 class.) Then I
could hand my rebate over to a student, if he
promised not to sleep, get sick, or have a
famine.
There were also gift categories in the $100
and $3400 categories (not leaving much for
middle-cash America), but since huge figures
always give me vertigo, I grabbed an aspirin
and overlooked these two. Though all the
gifts seemed worthwhile, the financially
p u shy - pully -cost-plus-plus-minus-divided-by
taxed-unemployed-shaky-waky-rock-n-rolly
state of our economy precludes me at this
point in time from giving something for
nothing. 8ut....

lacks culture when it first comes to Stanford,
it is not up to the school to socially
rehabilitate the pathetic thing.
Swim Suits
I also found that $25 could buy five swim
suits for the men's team, or one warm-up suit
for the women's. Now this must be a very
big warm-up suit, or I don't see how the
women's team is going to fit into it at all. I
also had to turn this one down on the
grounds of sex discrimination.
Moving into the liberal arts, I found that a
mere $25 would "give the Art Department
ten Leonardos (color transparencies)." Now,
I wouldn't object to paying $25 for ten real
Leonardos (that's a mere $2.50 per
Leonardo) but I'm not going to shell out my
money for cheap imitations. Either give
Stanford students the real thing, or nothing
at all. Let's not compromise our aesthetic
beliefs everywhere!

My last chance for a $25 gift was to buy
two glassware burettes or pipettes for
students. Now I don't mind if you guys want
to eat Mexican food, but why in the hell do
you have to eat it off glassware?
Tuition Rebates
When I found that $50 could buy two-and
two-thirds days' tuition to a student, I
thought I saw my chance. Maybe I could get
a rebate on the 24.75 classes I missed while
in school due to disease, sickness, famine,
fatigue. (Never take on an 8:00 class.) Then I
could hand my rebate over to a student, if he
promised not to sleep, get sick, or have a
famine.
There were also gift categories in the $100
and $3400 categories (not leaving much for
middle-cash America), but since huge figures
always give me vertigo, I grabbed an aspirin
and overlooked these two. Though all the
gifts seemed worthwhile, the financially
p u shy - pully -cost-plus-plus-minus-divided-by
taxed-unemployed-shaky-waky-rock-n-rolly
state of our economy precludes me at this
point in time from giving something for
nothing. 8ut....
Perhaps a reciprocative system could be
worked out between students and alumni.
For example, what alumnus in his right mind
would not give his eye teeth for a case of
Coors beer? You must remember, some states
are not graced with the Rocky Mountain
spring water like California. Now if an
alumnus sent in $25 to heat and light a
classroom for 100 hours, why can't the
students send him a case of six-pack of the
Official Undergraduate Elixir? Or a nice

Rod Koon

Stanford T-shirt, sweater or ashtray?
Or if a former member of the Stanford
community sends in $100 to provide an
undergraduate with a week's tuition, why not
send the generous soul a shaving from a
Stanford goal post? Or just paint a Popsicle
stick white, he'll never know. Or perhaps a
season's pass to the Sunday flicks, or a pair
of faded jeans actually broken in by
real Stanford students! You must
remember that businesses don't take kindly
to young executives wearing jeans, so they're
harder to break in once you get out of
school.
Now I will be the first to admit that my
idea is only in the planning stages. Much lies
ahead, but hope is there. For now, I am
graciusly setting up my living quarters as
headquarters for Operation Reciprocity. I
will anxiously await contributions such a?
Coors beer, Stanford T-shirts, faded jeans
(size 32-30 only please!) or whatever else
you might deem fitting. But please, no
painted Popsicle sticks!
Though some students and alumni might
be reluctant to join in with this operation, we
should try to remember that what is good for
the goose is good to philander.
Please send all paraphernalia to Rod
Koon, Tacoma Wash. 98406. No stamps,
please!
Let me thank the fourth estate in advance
for getting my message out to the people.
