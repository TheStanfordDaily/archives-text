New Christiansen?
Editor:
Viae Kershner has done it again
with yet another brilliant sports
column ("Seeing Red," Daily,
March 13).
As always, Kershner is right
when he writes that "[Bub]
Bowling isn't another Dallmar."
What Bowling is is another
Jack Christiansen.
Who is your starting
quarterback next winter, Bub?

Few Layoffs Planned
Editor:
The March 7 Daily reported
that .. 83 staff and 13 faculty
positions will be eliminated. While
the faculty reductions will be
accomplished through attrition,
staff layoffs are a near certainty."
While this is an easy conclusion
to draw, it is incomplete, for it is
the intention of Stanford
management to make the
necessary reductions in staff
through planned attrition
management whenever possible.
Any staff layoffs will be the
exception, not the rule.
Attrition management simply
means that a manager plans staff
changes far enough ahead so that
when a job becomes vacant, he
can consider various options —
replacement, nonreplacement or
transfer. When a staff member
leaves — for another job or to
leave the area, for example — the
manager may restructure the
workload to leave the job unfilled
or may fill the job with a Stanford
staff member who might be in a
position scheduled for reduction.
Despite current economic
conditions, Stanford staff
members show remarkable
mobility. Turnover in staff
positions last year averaged
between 25 and 30 percent,
creating a sizeable number of job
openings for employees willing to
transfer within the University.
Only when efforts at attrition
management fail to yield the
necessary staff reductions will a
layoff result. It is projected that
most of the reduction of 83
positions will be accomplished
through attrition management.
