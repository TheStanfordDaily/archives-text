# UFW-Teamster Battle Traps Gallo In Middle
## 
### 
(Last of Two Parts)
For the United Farm Workers
Support Committee's
information, Gallo made every
attempt to renew its contract with
the United Farm Workers of
America (UFW).
Beginning Feb. 1, 1973, we
repeatedly requested meetings
with the United Farm Workers in
order to renegotiate their contract
which was due to expire April 18,
1973. The United Farm Workers,
for reasons known only to themselves,
refused to hold a negotiating
meeting with Gallo until April 25,
1973. Subsequently, there were
12 negotiating meetings with the
United Farm Workers, the last one
on June 20, 1973. The
negotiations were paralyzed by
the United Farm Workers'
implacable stand on union
discipline and hiring hall practices
which would be illegal under the

National Labor Relations Act.
The United Farm Workers'
philosophy is one of complete
power over the worker. Clauses
the United Farm Workers wanted
in the new contract would have
benefited and strengthened the
union (in their view)', but would
have weakened the rights of the
workers. Gallo instead wanted
provisions protecting Gallo farm
workers from things like:
—favoritism and cronyism by
United Farm Workers' officials;
—having to pay three months'
to one year's dues in advance
before being dispatched to a job
by the hiring hall, to let a family
work together at the same ranch;
and
—not paying the medical
insurance the worker was entitled
to under the United Farm
Workers' medical plan.
We agreed with our employees
that the contract clauses at issue
were offensive morally and
ethically. While we were engaged
in protracted negotiations with
the United Farm Workers on these
clauses, we received a claim for
recognition from the Teamsters
Union.
Teamster Communique
On June 25, 1973, we received
our first communication from the
Teamsters claiming to represent a
majority of the Gallo farm
workers. Remember that the
United Farm Workers' contract
expired on April 18, 1973 — that
we had requested negotiations
start on February 1,1973, but the
United Farm Workers would not
negotiate until April 25, 1973,
and that negotiations were still
continuing when we received
word from the Teamsters on June
25, 1973, that they represented a
majority of the Gallo farm
workers.
There was no secret ballot
election held because there was
then, as there is now, no
machinery for such an election. In
the absence of laws governing
farm union election procedures,
the employer is vulnerable to
lawsuits and boycotts by the
losing union. Instead of meeting
with us to dispute the Teamsters'
claim on June 25, Chavez simply
called a strike. He could have
presented us with workers'

signature cards, if he actually had
them, at this time. Since he did
not present them, we have to
believe he did not have them and,
therefore, could not do so.
We recognized the Teamsters as
the Gallo farm workers' bargaining
agent in 1973, in the same manner
we recognized the United Farm
Workers in 1967 — by
determining, on the basis of their
verified signatures, that a majority
of our farm workers wanted to be
represented by the Teamsters. We
acted democratically and fairly in
abiding by our farm workers'
choice of unions. The United
Farm Workers' boycott of Gallo
wines will not persuade us to put
our farm workers into a union
that is not of their own choosing.
No UFW Problems
We had no basic difficulty in
administering the contract with
the United Farm Workers in the
six years we had contracts with
them. Misunderstandings did arise
from time to time, probably more
often than would have been the
case if the United Farm Workers
had had any experience in
contract administration. What did
bother us very much were the
complaints we kept getting from
our farm workers who had to
belong to the United Farm
Workers.
We took these workers'
complaints up with the United
Farm Workers' leaders, but they
never seemed very interested in
doing anything about them. We
attempted to negotiate the
changes desired by our employees
into the 1973 United Farm
Workers' contract.
It is a tragedy that the privilege
and the power of unionization
and effective collective bargaining
has been so long denied to
America's farm workers. It is a
tragedy that should not be
permitted to continue any longer.
America's farm workers must be
granted the same rights and
privileges accorded most other
American workers 40 years ago.
This is why Gallo favors including
farm workers under the National
Labor Relations Act (NLRA).
Under NLRA, if only 30
percent of the workers in a
working unit express their union
preference to the National Labor

Joshua Simons

Relations Board in writing, a free,
unintimidated, and secret ballot
election is held under strict
governmental supervision to
establish which, if any, union the
majority of the workers wish to
represent them. Thereafter, the
employer is required to bargain, in
good faith, with the union of the
workers' choice. Under the
NLRA, most of American labor
became organized, strong and
prosperous.
UFW Vs. Teamsters
The two American labor
unions most concerned with the
organization of farm workers are
Cesar Chavez' United Farm
Workers Union and the Western
Conference of Teamsters. Instead
of fighting to organize the over
two million non-union farm
workers throughout America,
which would have been beneficial
to all parties concerned as well as
the public, the United Farm
Workers and Teamsters have
devoted most of their time and
talent to jurisdictional disputes

over 65,000 California farm
workers. Both unions set out to
organize California farm labor at
least as far back as 1960. During
the 19605, both unions entered
into several peace pacts, but in
every instance each soon accused
the other of breaking the pact By
1973, after years of fighting
between the two unions, the
Teamsters had organized close to
90 percent of the 65,000
California farm workers.
Every person in the United
States who truly wishes to solve
the farm labor problem in all its
aspects, should write, wire, or
telephone his United States
senator ani congressman and
demand that NLRA-type
legislation be enacted into law
without further delay. If the
United Farm Workers Support
Committee on the Stanford
campus is serious about the farm
labor problem, it will do the same.
