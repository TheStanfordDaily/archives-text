## A 						Debutante With A Stick? Female 'Wings' Her Way In Lacrosse 
### LISA SONNE 
A female Stanford pre-med is
no more uncommon than a male
Stanford pre-med. But a female
Stanford pre-med who plays on
the lacrosse team? That's
uncommon.
Chantal Hillary Jeanne

Spurdon is the only one.
Chantal is the first woman ever to
make the lacrosse team at
Stanford. Like a lot of other
things in her life, this makes
Chantal laugh.
In January, two weeks after
being "presented" to high society

as a debutante in New York,
freshman Chantal tried out for the
team.
"I wanted initially to go out
for the women's team, but since it
is non-existent," she laughs, "I
went to the men's tryouts.
"At first, female interest was
surprisingly good, but I think a lot
of girls got scared by all the
physical contact. By the end of
the first day I was the only girl
left."
Now Chantal is a "midi" (like a
wing in field hockey) on the B
squad.
"Lacrosse, like soccer," she
says, "is just coming into being on
the West Coast. Not that many
people know about the sport and
I get the funniest looks riding
around campus with a
long-handled net.
"Lacrosse is a lot like ice
hockey, only the ball is aerial. I'd
say it's about as dangerous as
football; there's a lot of physical
contact, but you are well-padded
for Protection."
Fair Coaches
The coaches, Chantal
emphasizes, have been really good
about playing her fairly. "Under
Article IX, Sammy and Jack
(Coaches Sadtler and Mayer) could
just take me on as a female and
not have me play. But they are
giving me plenty of chances.
"The guys are really good
about treating me as an equal also.
They realize that if you go to
three two-and-a-half hour
practices a week and arrive at the
field 8 a.m. Sunday morning for a
game, you are not just trying to
be a token [female].
"You really love the sport and
want to play just as badly as they
do. I really think the guys on the
team deserve a lot of credit for
their dedication and discipline.
They have been really helpful and
I respect them a lot."
No Special Treatment
Coach Jack Mayer says he's
made "no special allowances for
Chantal.
"She's been able to adapt her

Eastern experiences in women's
lacrosse to become an effective
player on the Stanford team."
Pete Garbino, one of the first
team members to know Chantal,
says that "she holds up her end of
it and that's what counts. If I
scrimmaged against her I wouldn't
play any easier. If I did she'd beat
me!"
According to Phil Greek,
another teammate, Chantal has
"good technique and is very
dependable." The only time he
feels bad about tossing her the
ball is "when a big bully is trying
to bump her with his meat."
Bullies
Some members of other teams
have difficulties adjusting to a
female on the field. Chantal
recalls her first game.
"My guard was about 6-foot-5
and seemed to weigh 250 pounds.
He looked at me and just kind of
went 'AAHHH,' laughs the
5-foot-2 125 pound Chantal.
The only time she has
encountered another woman
player on a men's team was at
Davis.
"They knew I was female so
they purposely put this really
short, 95 pound girl opposite me
and she got put out when I started
knocking people about.
"I got kind of violent, I guess, to
get the ball. They took her out so
I got stuck with a big hunk
again."
Despite her aggressiveness,
Chantal is not a gum-chewing,
continually cussing, stereotype
female jock. She toasted in the
New Year wearing a formal at one
of New York's highest social
events and she resorts to gum only
at exam time.
Says one of Chantal's friends,
"Chantal is a pre-med, taking
18 units with lacrosse, but
she always appears to be relaxed
and having a good time.
"Laughing is like breathing for
her, but she also takes life quite

seriously. Right now she is really
enjoying what Stanford has to
offer."
Competitive Spirit
Chantal loves sports — "not
just men's sports — but sports.
They are about 25% of my life."
She thrives on the competition
and team spirit.
And she also feels strongly that
women's sports are discriminated
against.
"You just don't see
scholarships for female athletes or
a Maples Pavilion crowd for the
women's basketball # team even
though their record is better than
the men's. I'm not sure if it is just
Stanford or whether women's
sports don't have much of a

future, but I sure hope things
improve.
"I really believe in the E.R.A.
(Equal Rights Amendment] and I
practice the principles of women's
lib. I think there is an urgent need
right now for women's
consciousness-raising.
"But overall, I think the most
important thing to work for is
humanitarian rights."
International Scholar
Chantal was born in Paris,
France, and at age three moved

with her family to New York.
After three more years of
pre-med studies and "having a
good time at Stanford," Chantal
plans to go to a medical school in
the Midwest. That way she will
have more time to decide which
coast she wants to settle down on
and "maybe do pathology
research."
Is Chantal going out for the
lacrosse team, next year?
"Yeah, for sure!" she says and
laughs some more.
