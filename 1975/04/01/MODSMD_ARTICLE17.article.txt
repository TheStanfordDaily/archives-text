# 'Forum' To Inject 'Catalyst' In April
## 
### RON ELVING 
The Stanford Forum, a
recently formed organization ol
undergraduates concerned with
social issues, will publish the first
edition of its own scholarly
journal — the Catalyst — during
the first week of April.
The Forum also plans to
sponsor a campus symposium in
May. Both the first edition of the
Catalyst and the symposium will
focus on the question of prison
reform, according to Forum
Chairman and Catalyst Co-Editor
Scott Morrison.
"It was a natural progression,"
Morrison said, "from the idea for
the Catalyst to the need for an
organization to plan and produce
the symposium as well as future
journal issues. We'd like to
schedule two symposia and three
Catalysts each year."
In a written proposal for the
two projects, the Forum's
founders said the journal "will
provide an extensive overview of
one current issue in order to
heighten student awareness and
interest in a particular social
problem."
Pro Writers
Though the Catalyst will be a
student-edited journal, the articles
themselves will be written by
professionals involved in an
edition's particular field of focus.
Morrison said he hopes this
format will provide more
"expertise and depth" than might
be found in student writing.
Mark Schallert, Catalyst
co-editor, said the April issue will
have about 40 pages and
include "eight articles, an

interview with a Soledad prisoner,
poetry composed by inmates and
an editorial written by one of the
editors."
Funds for the first edition have
been obtained from various
campus sources. Morrison cited
contributions from the ASSU
Publications Board ($250) and the
Stanford Bookstore ($100), as
well as a $250 loan from the Dean
of Student Affairs Office.
Schallert said that he and
Morrison also had used "personal
funds" to help meet the $800 cost
of the first issue. Planning a press
run of 800 copies priced at $1,
the Forum hopes that future
issues will be self-sustaining.
Financing the three-day
symposium on prison reform has
been more difficult, according to
Morrison. While seeking funds for
$2500 in speakers' fees,
auditorium rentals and other
costs, Morrison said he had
encountered "a stone wall.
"Everyone wants you to
guarantee them something which
you can't even begin to arrange
until you have funds committed,"
Morrison said.
Plans to invite such well-known
figures as Angela Davis, Jessica
Mitford or Bobby Seale have been
held in abeyance, because of the
need for cash on hand, Schallert
said. He stressed that contacts
with Bay Area groups such as the
Prisoners' Union were being
pursued.
The Forum has requested
support for the symposium from
several University departments,
and has also asked SCIRE for
$750 in student initiative funds.
