## Movies: The Waldo Pepper Dialogue 
### 
The following is a hypothetical
conversation between two movie
moguls. It in no way represents
the real way the film. The Great
Waldo Pepper was conceived, but
then who knows?
"Hey Adolph! Nice to see ya. I
have a property so hot, why it
could practically sell itself. I got
Redford all lined up, and a
dynamite story that makes an
important social point."
"Hold On Manny! Not so fast.
This isn't going to be another of
these nostalgia films that tells how
nice things were back in the 1920s
or '30s. Those have been done to
death."
"Yeah, Adolph, but each one
has made good grosses. And The
Sting — well I don't have to tell
you."
"Sure, but that was as much
the Newman-Redford thing as any
nostalgia craze. Butch Cassidy ..."
George Roy's Back
"That's just it, Adolph, we've
got George Roy Hill and the same
script writer from Butch Cassidy.
And we've got old airplanes, with
better flying shots than were in

The Blue Max, you know, the one
with Peppard and Mason and
Ursula Andress. God, how that
one could have cleaned up if she
hadn't had to have a towel over
her — you know?"
"Manny, get to the point.
We're talking about this new
movie with Redford, not a
10-year-old turkey. You say it's got
airplanes and Hill is the director.
So what! Before Butch Cassidy,
he was hardly a big-time director.
And I can name you an airplane
movie with an Academy-award
winning actor that's only a couple
of years old that flopped so badly,
hardly anybody saw it."
"Oh I know the one, that one
with the bad title and Cliff
Robertson, something like Ace of
the Skies. Nobody could sell a
movie with a dumb title like
that."
The Real Name
"It was Ace Eli and Roger of
the Skies, Manny, and I'll admit
the name didn't have much to do
with the movie. So what's your
hot package called?
"The Great Waldo Pepper."

"God, that's the most absurd
title since Skidoo. How can you
sell a movie about flying old
airplanes with that title?"
"That's just it. We don't sell
the title, we sell Redford and
nostalgia and social commentary.
Titles don't mean anything today
anyhow. People go to see the big
star."
"I don't know, Manny. The
whole thing doesn't sound too
well-integrated to me. Does this
take place during World War I?
Are there some good aerial
combat scenes?
"No Adolph, it all happens
after the "Great War" is over and

these pilots are barnstorming
around the country. Federal
regulation of aviation is just
starting, but Waldo Pepper, that's
Redford, doesn't want to be
restricted by the bureaucrats. He
still wants to live out his
fantasies."
"Which are?"
"To shoot down the greatest
German pilot ■» of World War I.
Now I know you think it sounds
pretty zany and confused, but this
script makes it all clear."
"Manny, are you sure you
don't have two or three separate
movies here?"
"Adolph, wasn't I right about

how The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre would do on the drive-in
circuit? Just back me on this one
and I'll cut you in for a share of
the profits."
"Profits, who cares. Make it,
but count me out. If it does some
business, I'll take a vacation
myself, to get away from this
creeping nostalgia. God, when
Harry Truman starts getting the
treatment...."
At this point, the conversation
became intelligible. The movie
was made, however, and can be
seen at various locations around
the Bay Area.
