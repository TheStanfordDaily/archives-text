# Another Ellington Takes The Baton
## 
### DAN FORTE 
LONDON - On the day
following the funeral of Duke
Ellington, Mercer Ellington, then
a member of his father's trumpet
section, took the band to
Bermuda to fulfill a prior
commitment.
Shortly thereafter, it was
announced that Mercer Ellington
would assume the position left
vacant by Duke's passing, leader
of a new Ellington Orchestra. A
task of no small dimension, to be
sure. But, one which was very
necessary in order to carry on a
tradition founded by America's
most prominent musical figure.
That new band is now
gradually gaining a full head of
steam, seemingly determined to
dispell any notions that Duke's
music is gone along with the
Duke. The fact of the matter — if
their February 20 sell-out concert
at the Odeon, Hammersmith is
any indication — is that Duke
Lives!
It became immediately obvious
that everyone there was pulling
for Mercer Ellington's success, as
evidenced by the huge ovation he
received walking on to "C-Jam
Blues."
Mercer wisely chose not to
"play Duke." The flowery
introductions, and grunts and
groans from the piano stool were
absent. He also chose not to play
"Duke's son." In the same way
that Duke never introduced his
son as a member of the trumpet
section, Mercer never referred to
his father as anything but Duke
Ellington.
"Caravan" was possibly the
best number of the evening,
spotlighting drummer Freddy
Waits. The show's hero in
everybody's mind, though, was
trumpeter Cootie Williams who
has played in the Ellington
organization, off and on, since
1929. His "Shepherd Who
Watches Over the Night Flock"
was a dynamic slow blues, in the

most lowdown sense of the word.
Williams is one of only five
members (counting Mercer) who
were present when the band
played San Francisco two years
ago. The others include
trombonist Chuck Connors,
saxophonist Harold Minerve and
trumpeter Money Johnson who,
as usual, offered a memorable
impersonation of Louis
Armstrong, singing "Basin Street
Blues" and "Blueberry Hill."
Mercer, unfortunately, has laid
his trumpet aside for the time
being, and only once picked up
Barrie Lee Hall's flugelhorn for a
few ensemble riffs during
"Perdido."
The most interesting new
member of the group is Joe
Temperly, from Scotland. Faced
with the awesome job of filling
the baritone sax seat after the
death of Harry Carney last year,
Temperly may turn out to be one
of the key factors in the success
of the new orchestra. He was
featured to great advantage on
"Sophisticated Lady," and

"Carney," dedicated to the man
who'd held his seat for 50 years.
Other standouts among the
newcomers include trombonist
Art Baron, pianist Lloyd Meyers
(talk about filling someone's
shoes), and the group's fiery
youngsters, Ricky Ford (tenor
sax), age 20, and 18-year-old
Gerry Wiggins, Jr. on bass.
The addition of Mercer's son,
Edward Kennedy Ellington 11,
marks the first time a rhythm
guitarist has been present in the
group since Fred Guy retired in
1947.
Naturally, the many personnel
changes account for a new,
different overall sound. But,
somehow Duke's spirit seems
unmistakably present
somewhere in the wings.
Appropriately, the concert
ended with "Things Ain't What
They Used To Be," a long-time
standard in the • Ellington
repertoire which was written by
"the other Ellington," Mercer.
The band's theme, Billy

Strayhom's "Take the 'A' Train,"
was saved for the group's encore,
the first of three.
As Mercer Ellington has said,
"We may not be geniuses like Pop,
but at least we can carry on the
music authentically." Indeed,
there will never be another Duke
Ellington, nor another Duke
Ellington Orchestra in that sense.
But, we can all be thankful that
there is now the new Mercer
Ellington Orchestra.

album drew raves from Rolling Stone, comes to the Boarding House in
the City Wednesday night. She replaces the Waders, who have kept
their reggae in Jamaica.

"Caravan" was possibly the
best number of the evening,
spotlighting drummer Freddy
Waits. The show's hero in
everybody's mind, though, was
trumpeter Cootie Williams who
has played in the Ellington
organization, off and on, since
1929. His "Shepherd Who
Watches Over the Night Flock"
was a dynamic slow blues, in the

most lowdown sense of the word.
Williams is one of only five
members (counting Mercer) who
were present when the band
played San Francisco two years
ago. The others include
trombonist Chuck Connors,
saxophonist Harold Minerve and
trumpeter Money Johnson who,
as usual, offered a memorable
impersonation of Louis
Armstrong, singing "Basin Street
Blues" and "Blueberry Hill."
Mercer, unfortunately, has laid
his trumpet aside for the time
being, and only once picked up
Barrie Lee Hall's flugelhorn for a
few ensemble riffs during
"Perdido."
The most interesting new
member of the group is Joe
Temperly, from Scotland. Faced
with the awesome job of filling
the baritone sax seat after the
death of Harry Carney last year,
Temperly may turn out to be one
of the key factors in the success
of the new orchestra. He was
featured to great advantage on
"Sophisticated Lady," and

"Carney," dedicated to the man
who'd held his seat for 50 years.
Other standouts among the
newcomers include trombonist
Art Baron, pianist Lloyd Meyers
(talk about filling someone's
shoes), and the group's fiery
youngsters, Ricky Ford (tenor
sax), age 20, and 18-year-old
Gerry Wiggins, Jr. on bass.
The addition of Mercer's son,
Edward Kennedy Ellington 11,
marks the first time a rhythm
guitarist has been present in the
group since Fred Guy retired in
1947.
Naturally, the many personnel
changes account for a new,
different overall sound. But,
somehow Duke's spirit seems
unmistakably present
somewhere in the wings.
Appropriately, the concert
ended with "Things Ain't What
They Used To Be," a long-time
standard in the • Ellington
repertoire which was written by
"the other Ellington," Mercer.
The band's theme, Billy

Strayhom's "Take the 'A' Train,"
was saved for the group's encore,
the first of three.
As Mercer Ellington has said,
"We may not be geniuses like Pop,
but at least we can carry on the
music authentically." Indeed,
there will never be another Duke
Ellington, nor another Duke
Ellington Orchestra in that sense.
But, we can all be thankful that
there is now the new Mercer
Ellington Orchestra.

album drew raves from Rolling Stone, comes to the Boarding House in

LONDON - On the day
following the funeral of Duke
Ellington, Mercer Ellington, then
a member of his father's trumpet
section, took the band to
Bermuda to fulfill a prior
commitment.
Shortly thereafter, it was
announced that Mercer Ellington
would assume the position left
vacant by Duke's passing, leader
of a new Ellington Orchestra. A
task of no small dimension, to be
sure. But, one which was very
necessary in order to carry on a
tradition founded by America's
most prominent musical figure.
That new band is now
gradually gaining a full head of
steam, seemingly determined to
dispell any notions that Duke's
music is gone along with the
Duke. The fact of the matter — if
their February 20 sell-out concert
at the Odeon, Hammersmith is
any indication — is that Duke
Lives!
It became immediately obvious
that everyone there was pulling
for Mercer Ellington's success, as
evidenced by the huge ovation he
received walking on to "C-Jam
Blues."
Mercer wisely chose not to
"play Duke." The flowery
introductions, and grunts and
groans from the piano stool were
absent. He also chose not to play
"Duke's son." In the same way
that Duke never introduced his
son as a member of the trumpet
section, Mercer never referred to
his father as anything but Duke
Ellington.
