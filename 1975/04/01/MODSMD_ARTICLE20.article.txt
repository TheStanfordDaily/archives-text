Journey has never been Your
Average Local Band. Winterland
was their first gig. There has never
been a question of them working
their way to the top. They were
born there.
Within the context of more
than a year of major concert
appearances, Journey, their first
album released this week by CBS,
takes on a more than average
burden. As a first album by an
unknown band it would be
praised unquestioningly — as the
first album by Journey, it must
and will come under close
scrutiny.
Journey bears the band's first
test well. The unbridled sound of
Journey live has been smoothed
and polished in the studio into a
highly sophisticated product
which can't readily be compared
with the Journey concert sound.
The sleeked-down album may
dissatisfy those familiar with the

powerful live sound, but close
listening at higher volume reveals
the intricate little touches often
lost in concert.
Gregg Rolie's voice, for
example, comes through clearly to
deliver the lyrics which even
ardent Journey freaks may be
hearing for the first time. In
addition, Rolie's work on piano,
organ and synthesizer is vastly
more capable than his recent
concert work.
Close To Live
Rolie is particularly good on
"To Play Some Music," the album
cut which comes closest to being
live Journey.
"Lonely Feeling" is colored
with subtle little riffs by lead
guitarist Neal Schon, tiny flashes
that evolve into "Conversations,"
the instrumental second half of
the song. Along with the lead riffs
on "Of A Lifetime,"
"Conversations" is Schon's finest
work on the album, showing the
outer limits of his extremely
versatile, extremely expressive

guitar.
Compared to anyone else's
best, Schon is simply amazing
throughout the album, cutting
from pure, lacy riffs to spacy
leads which have been modified to
sound very much like Rolie's
synthesizer. Yet compared with
Schon's personal concert best,
something is missing. An
extremely audience-sensitive
performer, Schon may have
missed the crowd response that
sparks his most glorious concert
riffs.
First Hint
Studio stiffness aside, the
album marks the public's first
clear recorded hint of what Schon
can do on his own. The hint
promises more.
There are rough spots on
Journey, certainly. Too much bass
has been cut from "Mystery
Mountain," deadening the song's
impact. In addition, Schon should
have stayed with straight guitar
through the song — the
synthesizer sound doesn't bite

enough, causing a somewhat
muddy ending. Several cuts have
been criminally shortened to fit
on the album, sacrificing Schon's
delicate ending flourishes.
There is also perfection.
Aynsley Dunbar's drumming is
perfect throughout the album.
There is nothing else to be said
about it — just perfect.
And there is "Kohoutek," a
cut so perfectly performed, so
perfectly engineered that it makes
"Layla" sound lacky. George
Tickner's rhythm guitar, Ross
Valory's bass, and Dunbar's
perfect drumming form the
instrumental base for an
intergalactic duel between Rolie's
synthesizer and Schon's
spaced-out guitar that, alone,
could shoot Journey to the stars.
