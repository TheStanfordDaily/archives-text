North Vietnamese Drive South
SAIGON, South Vietnam — North Vietnamese forces
pushed toward South Vietnam's lower coast virtually
without resistance yesterday, touching off an evacuation of
some Americans from Saigon. Refugees fought to escape
fallen Da Nang — many drowning or dying of exposure
before Communist shelling ended U.S. rescue efforts.
Meanwhile in Tokyo, the Viet Cong said they are
prepared to quickly settle all the affairs of South Vietnam
in talks with a new Saigon government that excludes
President Nguyen Van Thieu and abides by the Paris
cease-fire.
Declaring that a new turning point has been reached as a
result of overwhelming military victories, the statement,
broadcast by North Vietnam's official Vietnam ""News
Agency, was in an appeal issued by the Viet Cong's
Provisional Revolutionary Government. It declared:
"The Nguyen Van Thieu junta — main obstacle to the
settlement of the political questions in South Vietnam —
must be overthrown, and an administration standing for
peace, independence, democracy, national concord and
strict application of the Paris agreement must be
established."
It said the Provisional Revolutionary Government "is
ready to hold talks with such an administration to quickly
settle all the affairs of South Vietnam."
But it added, "Realities have proved that the U.S.
imperialists still refuse to end their military involvement
and interference in the internal affairs of South Vietnam.
Though its situation is hopeless, the Nguyen Van Thieu
junta is clamoring for war, feverishly stepping
up ... forcible evacuation of the population, exploitation,
repression, persecution and massacres."
In Washington, the U.S. government reacted with only a
shadow of the urgency that marked its response to much
less severe setbacks in Southeast Asia.
Defendants Admit SLA Tie At Trial
SACRAMENTO — Two young men called themselves
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) "revolutionaries" for
the first time yesterday and, as their murder trial began,
said that prison guards have beaten them and threatened
them with death.
Joseph Remiro and Russell Little were then excused
from the courtroom and watched the start of their murder
trial on closed circuit television.
"If the D.A. and the judge wish only to prove that we
will not sit quietly through this farce, we are willing to
stipulate for the record that we have nothing but contempt

for this court and everything it represents," Remiro and
Little told the Sacramento County Superior Court in a
four-page, typewritten statement. "Since this whole circus
is for the benefit of others, we'd rather not be present."
Remiro, 28, and Little, 25, appeared twice briefly in the
heavily guarded courtroom before the start of the trial in
which they are charged in the November 1973
cyanide-filled bullet ambush that left Oakland schools Supt.
Marcus Foster dead and his assistant wounded.
High Court Rejects Environment Cases
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court declined
yesterday, at least for the present, to step into two
environmental controversies over possible cancer-causing
industrial agents.
The court rejected a request by three Midwestern states
and a number of environmental groups that it set a
two-year deadline for an end to pollution of Lake Superior
by Reserve Mining Co.
Reserve Mining discharges taconite waste containing
asbestos fibers, identified as a possible cause of cancer,
from its iron ore processing plant at Silver Bay, Minn.
The court also refused to set aside standards established
by the Labor Department to limit the exposure of workers
in the plastics industry to vinyl chloride.
The government, defending its standards for vinyl
chloride, said the substance is known to cause cancer in
humans in some cases and that 13 workers have died from
exposure to it.
UCLA Wins NCAA Basketball Title
SAN DIEGO — Rich Washington and Dave Meyers
combined for 52 points and controlled the boards last night
to send the UCLA Bruins to a 92-85 victory over Kentucky,
giving John Wooden his 10th NCAA national basketball
championship in his final game as a coach.
A crowd of 15,153 saw some of the 64-year-old
Wooden's own strategy pay off for his Bruins, which won
the title for the eighth time in the last nine-years and 10th
in the past 12.
UCLA, which trailed by six points early in the first half
before Wooden sent 7-foot-l Ralph Drollinger into the
game, went ahead 43-40 at the half and never trailed
thereafter.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with variable high clouds through tomorrow.
Little temperature change. Lows in the 40s. Highs today
and tomorrow in mid 50s to mid 60s.

Defendants Admit SLA Tie At Trial
SACRAMENTO — Two young men called themselves
Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) "revolutionaries" for
the first time yesterday and, as their murder trial began,
said that prison guards have beaten them and threatened
them with death.
Joseph Remiro and Russell Little were then excused
from the courtroom and watched the start of their murder
trial on closed circuit television.
"If the D.A. and the judge wish only to prove that we
will not sit quietly through this farce, we are willing to
stipulate for the record that we have nothing but contempt

for this court and everything it represents," Remiro and
Little told the Sacramento County Superior Court in a
four-page, typewritten statement. "Since this whole circus
is for the benefit of others, we'd rather not be present."
Remiro, 28, and Little, 25, appeared twice briefly in the
heavily guarded courtroom before the start of the trial in
which they are charged in the November 1973
cyanide-filled bullet ambush that left Oakland schools Supt.
Marcus Foster dead and his assistant wounded.
High Court Rejects Environment Cases
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court declined
yesterday, at least for the present, to step into two
environmental controversies over possible cancer-causing
industrial agents.
The court rejected a request by three Midwestern states
and a number of environmental groups that it set a
two-year deadline for an end to pollution of Lake Superior
by Reserve Mining Co.
Reserve Mining discharges taconite waste containing
asbestos fibers, identified as a possible cause of cancer,
from its iron ore processing plant at Silver Bay, Minn.
The court also refused to set aside standards established
by the Labor Department to limit the exposure of workers
in the plastics industry to vinyl chloride.
The government, defending its standards for vinyl
chloride, said the substance is known to cause cancer in
humans in some cases and that 13 workers have died from
exposure to it.
UCLA Wins NCAA Basketball Title
SAN DIEGO — Rich Washington and Dave Meyers
combined for 52 points and controlled the boards last night
to send the UCLA Bruins to a 92-85 victory over Kentucky,
giving John Wooden his 10th NCAA national basketball
championship in his final game as a coach.
A crowd of 15,153 saw some of the 64-year-old
Wooden's own strategy pay off for his Bruins, which won
the title for the eighth time in the last nine-years and 10th
in the past 12.
UCLA, which trailed by six points early in the first half
before Wooden sent 7-foot-l Ralph Drollinger into the
game, went ahead 43-40 at the half and never trailed
thereafter.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with variable high clouds through tomorrow.

and tomorrow in mid 50s to mid 60s.
North Vietnamese Drive South
SAIGON, South Vietnam — North Vietnamese forces
pushed toward South Vietnam's lower coast virtually
without resistance yesterday, touching off an evacuation of
some Americans from Saigon. Refugees fought to escape
fallen Da Nang — many drowning or dying of exposure
before Communist shelling ended U.S. rescue efforts.
Meanwhile in Tokyo, the Viet Cong said they are
prepared to quickly settle all the affairs of South Vietnam
in talks with a new Saigon government that excludes
President Nguyen Van Thieu and abides by the Paris
cease-fire.
Declaring that a new turning point has been reached as a
result of overwhelming military victories, the statement,
broadcast by North Vietnam's official Vietnam ""News
Agency, was in an appeal issued by the Viet Cong's
Provisional Revolutionary Government. It declared:
"The Nguyen Van Thieu junta — main obstacle to the
settlement of the political questions in South Vietnam —
must be overthrown, and an administration standing for
peace, independence, democracy, national concord and
strict application of the Paris agreement must be
established."
It said the Provisional Revolutionary Government "is
ready to hold talks with such an administration to quickly
settle all the affairs of South Vietnam."
But it added, "Realities have proved that the U.S.
imperialists still refuse to end their military involvement
and interference in the internal affairs of South Vietnam.
Though its situation is hopeless, the Nguyen Van Thieu
junta is clamoring for war, feverishly stepping
up ... forcible evacuation of the population, exploitation,
