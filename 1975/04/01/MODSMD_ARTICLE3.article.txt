# Olivieri, Committee Clash Over Finances
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri has been charged with
"mishandling funds" by members of a
committee organizing a Latin Jazz
concert on campus next month. The
Stanford Chevere Committee claims
Olivieri has reneged on a written
promise to provide funds.
"We've had trouble with Frank
since this thing began," said
Committee member George Nixon, a
graduate student in music.
Olivieri denied the charges.
Initially, several groups on campus,
including the Office of Public Events,
the Music Department and the
Chicano Fellows program, committed
a total of $9000 toward the concert,
according to Committee members. To
facilitate the fund transfer, Asst. Dean
of Student Affairs Dale Snape
suggested that the ASSU give Chevere
the money and be reimbursed by the
groups.
Contradicting Actions
According to Nixon, Olivieri agreed
to Snape's proposal. Nixon produced a
signed memo in which Olivieri
indicated he would allow the Chevere
account with the ASSU to reach
$9000 in the red.
However, at a meeting with
Director of Public Events Tom
Bacchetti and Snape to discuss the
contracts to be made with various
musical and publicity groups, Olivieri
walked out rather than allow the
ASSU to be responsible for payment,
Nixon claimed. Nixon then had to sign
the contracts himself for the amount
of approximately $14,000, he said.
When a check was requested for
$700 to cover initial publicity, Nixon
said Olivieri rejected it and then
announced that the ASSU would not
cooperate until at least 75 percent of
the money committed by the
departments was transferred to the
Chevere account.
Nixon added, however, that Olivieri
did relent somewhat and allowed
Chevere access to $4000.

"It wasn't a formal agreement,"
insisted Olivieri. At the time of the
commitment, he said, there was over
$200,000 in ASSU funds. He invested
all but approximately $15,000 of this
in banker's acceptances with the
understanding that it could be
liquidated at any time with no loss.
When Olivieri tried to do this,
however, he was informed by a Wells
Fargo official that he would sustain a
substantial penalty in loss of interest.
Big Surprise
"It was a timing problem and a big,
big surprise that those funds weren't
available," said Olivieri. Because there
are over 300 organizations with ASSU
accounts, he said, allowing Chevere to
withdraw funds would have made the
available funds "dangerously low."
"We live and learn," admitted
Olivieri. "I should have been informed
of the investment arrangement
beforehand."
As for the contracts, Olivieri

claimed that "the only contracts that
are signed by me are for organizations
officially affiliated with the ASSU.
Previously, we had been working
under the erroneous assumption that I
would be signing the contracts."
Meanwhile, payments are due on
some of the contracts, and Nixon fears
that he will be held responsible for
payment.
"What we're asking Frank to do is
to keep his word," said Maria
Echaveste, an ASSU senator.
According to ASSU Senate
Chairman Lee Rosenbaum, "The
Senate has the power to make Frank

back off." Since Olivieri is responsible
to the ASSU, a Senate vote could
force Olivieri to allow Chevere access
to ASSU funds.
"Besides," added Rosenbaum,
"what good are ASSU funds if they're
not available to the students?"
Ray Telles, a student services
officer in Overseas Studies and
chairman of Chevere, said that the
concert is a benefit for eight
organizations, including the Stanford
Stage Band, MEChA and a drug
rehabilitation center in Palo Alto. It is
not intended to make money for its
organizers Telles stressed.
Chevere plans to meet with Olivieri
this week to discuss funding.
