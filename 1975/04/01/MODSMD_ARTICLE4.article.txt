# Davis Case Could Affect Policies Here
## 
### JIM WASCHER Second Of Two Parts 
The legal adviser to President
Lyman believes that the admissions
policy at the Law School "would be of
doubtful legality" if higher courts
uphold a recent Yolo County Superior
Court ruling that the UC-Davis Medical
School may not use race as an
objective criterion for admitting
students.
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena told the Daily last week
that "I think the judge is saying that
admissions have to be entirely color
blind. As I understand it, the law
school admissions process is not color
blind.
"If you are of a certain minority,

you would likely be admitted, whereas
if you were not of that minority, and
had the same qualifications, you
would likely not be admitted," Siena
explained.
Siena said that, under Superior
Court Judge F. Leslie Manker's ruling
in Bakke v.the Regents of the
University of California, the law
school's admissions policy "would be
open to serious question."
Law school admissions officers here
initially examine an applicant's Law
School Admission Test (LSAT) score,
as well as his grade point average
(GPA). The GPA is calculated on an
800-point scale similar to the LSAT
scoring system.
The law school then combines these
two 800-scale numbers to arrive at an
applicant's law quotient index (LQI).
According to Asst. Law School Dean
Thelton Henderson, the school then
averages the LQl's "of about five of
the lowest non-minority students we
admitted the previous year."
Automatic Admission
Henderson said the law school's
policy is that "any minority applicant
who falls above that figure is
substantially automatically admitted."
Hr added that virtually all of the
minority applicants whose LQl's are
above this minimum are admitted.
However, Henderson emphasized
strongly that "there are a lot of
excellent minority students here who
were admitted solely upon their
credentials and their ability to
compete" in the law school, and who
did not need assistance under the
minimum LQI system.
According to Siena, "several Jewish
fjroups, led by the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai Birith, have filed a

complaint with HEW [the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare]
against the admissions policies and
practices at a number of law schools,
including Stanford."
Civil Rights Complaint
The groups filed the complaint
under the provisions of Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 which
prohibit any institution receiving
federal funds from discriminating on
the basis of race. HEW regulations
issued under Title VI specifically ban
racial discrimination in admissions
practices.
The HEW Regional Office in San
Francisco informed the University of
the complaint on April 11 last year
and Siena said Stanford has supplied
information concerning its law school
admissions program to the office. He
added that the HEW has not made a
ruling on the complaint.
Wade Madison, higher education
officer for HEW's San Francisco civil
rights division, yesterday said he could
not immediately determine the status
of the B'nai B'irth charges.
Aids, Housing Policies
Siena also acknowledged that the
University's financial aids and
minority theme housing policies could
be in jeopardy if Judge Manker's

"color blind" test in the Bakke case is
upheld by higher courts. Many legal
observers believe Bakke will ultimately
reach the U.S. Supreme Court on
appeal.
"The issues raised in the financial
aids controversy are somewhat the
same as the issues raised in connection
with the admission policies and
programs," Siena explained. Manker's
support for neutral treatment of all
races "might bring into question the
contention that different racial groups
need different financial aid support,"
he added.
As for minority theme housing,
Siena said "I suppose the same
arguments for special financial aids
packaging might also be made for
special housing for them. Whether
those arguments would prevail [in
court] is open to considerable
question," he opined.
In general, however, Siena insisted
that "one cannot say that what we are
doing is illegal, because where the law
will come out is unclear. Until the
issue is resolved, it is important that
we continue to do what seems to us
the proper thing to do given our
responsibilities to society, as long as it
is not plainly illegal."

League of B'nai Birith, have filed a

complaint with HEW [the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare]
against the admissions policies and
practices at a number of law schools,
including Stanford."
Civil Rights Complaint
The groups filed the complaint
under the provisions of Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 which
prohibit any institution receiving
federal funds from discriminating on
the basis of race. HEW regulations
issued under Title VI specifically ban
racial discrimination in admissions
practices.
The HEW Regional Office in San
Francisco informed the University of
the complaint on April 11 last year
and Siena said Stanford has supplied
information concerning its law school
admissions program to the office. He
added that the HEW has not made a
ruling on the complaint.
Wade Madison, higher education
officer for HEW's San Francisco civil
rights division, yesterday said he could
not immediately determine the status
of the B'nai B'irth charges.
Aids, Housing Policies
Siena also acknowledged that the
University's financial aids and
minority theme housing policies could
be in jeopardy if Judge Manker's

"color blind" test in the Bakke case is
upheld by higher courts. Many legal
observers believe Bakke will ultimately
reach the U.S. Supreme Court on
appeal.
"The issues raised in the financial
aids controversy are somewhat the
same as the issues raised in connection
with the admission policies and
programs," Siena explained. Manker's
support for neutral treatment of all
races "might bring into question the
contention that different racial groups
need different financial aid support,"
he added.
As for minority theme housing,
Siena said "I suppose the same
arguments for special financial aids
packaging might also be made for
special housing for them. Whether
those arguments would prevail [in
court] is open to considerable
question," he opined.
In general, however, Siena insisted
that "one cannot say that what we are
doing is illegal, because where the law
will come out is unclear. Until the
issue is resolved, it is important that
we continue to do what seems to us
the proper thing to do given our
responsibilities to society, as long as it
is not plainly illegal."
The legal adviser to President
Lyman believes that the admissions
policy at the Law School "would be of
doubtful legality" if higher courts
uphold a recent Yolo County Superior
Court ruling that the UC-Davis Medical
School may not use race as an
objective criterion for admitting
students.
Legal Adviser to the President
James Siena told the Daily last week
that "I think the judge is saying that
admissions have to be entirely color
blind. As I understand it, the law
school admissions process is not color
blind.
"If you are of a certain minority,

you would likely be admitted, whereas
if you were not of that minority, and
had the same qualifications, you
would likely not be admitted," Siena
explained.
Siena said that, under Superior
Court Judge F. Leslie Manker's ruling
in Bakke v.the Regents of the
University of California, the law
school's admissions policy "would be
open to serious question."
Law school admissions officers here
initially examine an applicant's Law
School Admission Test (LSAT) score,
as well as his grade point average
(GPA). The GPA is calculated on an
800-point scale similar to the LSAT
scoring system.
The law school then combines these
two 800-scale numbers to arrive at an
applicant's law quotient index (LQI).
According to Asst. Law School Dean
Thelton Henderson, the school then
averages the LQl's "of about five of
the lowest non-minority students we
admitted the previous year."
Automatic Admission
Henderson said the law school's
policy is that "any minority applicant
who falls above that figure is
substantially automatically admitted."
Hr added that virtually all of the
minority applicants whose LQl's are
above this minimum are admitted.
However, Henderson emphasized
strongly that "there are a lot of
excellent minority students here who
were admitted solely upon their
credentials and their ability to
compete" in the law school, and who
did not need assistance under the
minimum LQI system.
According to Siena, "several Jewish
fjroups, led by the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai Birith, have filed a

complaint with HEW [the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare]
against the admissions policies and
practices at a number of law schools,
including Stanford."
