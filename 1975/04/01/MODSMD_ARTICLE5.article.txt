## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Six slates have taken out petitions
for the ASSU Council of Presidents
election, Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald said yesterday. Students
will be asked to choose among the
slates in the April 16 and 17 balloting.
Also on the ballot will be $15 in fee
assessments from nine different
groups, election of the class of '76
officers and two constitutional
amendments.
Heading four of the slates are ASSU
Senate Chairman Lee Rosenbaum;
ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott; Steve
Weiss, heading the "Hammer and
Coffin" Chaparral associated slate; and
former ASSU Sen. Mike Lopez.
David Meyer and Robert Garcia
have also taken out petitions, but
could not be reached for comment last
night. They ran together as a slate two
years ago, garnering six percent of the
vote.
