# Six Slates Running For ASSU Council
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Six slates have taken out petitions
for the ASSU Council of Presidents
election, Elections Commissioner Tom
Fitzgerald said yesterday. Students
will be asked to choose among the
slates in the April 16 and 17 balloting.
Also on the ballot will be $15 in fee
assessments from nine different
groups, election of the class of '76
officers and two constitutional
amendments.
Heading four of the slates are ASSU
Senate Chairman Lee Rosenbaum;
ASSU Sen. Kevin McDermott; Steve
Weiss, heading the "Hammer and
Coffin" Chaparral associated slate; and
former ASSU Sen. Mike Lopez.
David Meyer and Robert Garcia
have also taken out petitions, but
could not be reached for comment last
night. They ran together as a slate two
years ago, garnering six percent of the
vote.
Running Mates
On Rosenbaum's slate are Charlotte
Germane, an ASSU senator; Dave
Galligan, member of the ASSU
Nominations Committee; and Josie
Jaramillo, who has worked with
MEChA and is a member of Students
for Equity.
On McDermott's slate are Andrew
Leuchter, director of the Speakers
Bureau; Bonny Rodden, who has
worked on the Daily for two years;
and Mark Simonian, former Daily
managing editor.
On Weiss' slate are junior
psychology major Tom Devine,
sophomore international relations
major Walter Kloefkorn and
sophomore mechanical engineering
major Shelly Williams.
Running with Lopez are Gary
Cohen and Preston DuFauchard. All
three work at KZSU, though Lopez
emphasized that the slate is not tied to
the radio station.
He also said they may add
another member; "we are looking for a
liberated female," he remarked.
Petitions with 100 signatures per
slate are due in the ASSU office

Friday at 5 p.m. in order to qualify for
the election.
Student Advocacy
Rosenbaum has said that his slate
will be "much more concerned with
student advocacy" than the current
council.
Members of McDermott's slate have
stressed a balance between the roles of
student advocate and student services
as the main job of the COP.
Kloefkorn noted that the Chappie
slate would go through with all the
technical requirements to be on the
ballot and hoped to point out "some
good points" during their campaign.
He said that he didn't believe "the
ASSU should be out to make a buck
off students," pointing to the recent
$90,000 profit.
Lopez said his slate will be a cross
between "operations research,
trigonometry, governmental
applications and decadence." He said
that meant they would attempt to
maximize the utilities of the ASSU to
provide as much pleasure for students
as possible.
New Theme House?
One of their plans is to start a new
theme house in Storey based on the
Harrad Experiment. The experiment

involved living groups with coed
rooms.
The Stanford Daily heads the list of
groups requesting fee assessments. The
Daily is asking $1 for each of autumn,
winter and summer quarters next year,
to be collected only if the
administration agrees to pay a
comparable cost per issue for its
faculty and staff subscriptions.
KZSU, the Legal Counseling Office,
the Publications Board and the ASSU
Speakers Bureau are each asking for $2
assessments next year. One of the
Counseling Office's $2 will be
collected during summer quarter.
The Band, Public Interest Research
Group (PIRG), the Action Research
Liaison Office (ARLO) and the ASSU
Program Fee are each requesting $1.
All petitions with 10 percent of the
student body signatures are due at 5
p.m. today if the measures are to
qualify for the ballot.
Petitions for senior class officers,
which run as slates of four candidates,
are due Friday, although Fitzgerald
said he may extend the deadline.
Currently only one group, headed by
Walter Spevak, has taken out petitions,
which require the signatures of 25
members of the class of '76.
