# University Signs Iranian Contract
## 
### JOHN FREED 
The University has signed a
controversial contract to assist in
planning an Iranian communication
satellite system, it announced
yesterday.
Although the $978,000 three-year
contract was signed in Tehran, Iran,
nearly two weeks ago, confirmation of
the signing was delayed, according to
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker,
one of the principal investigators in
the study.
"The contract has just been
signed... we had been operating
under a condition where we had a
letter of intent to sign from the
Iranian government. We didn't want to
release the news during spring break,
while everyone was away," Parker
commented.
The contract was signed despite
protests from Iranian students here
and others. Less than four weeks ago,
more than 200 students rallied in
White Plaza to protest the
then-imminent agreement.
Unhealthy Liaison
One Iranian student, who requested
anonymity, said last night that the
Stanford/Iran contract is part of a
continuing unhealthy liaison between
Iran and U.S. interests.
"It's just a sad story, isn't it?" the
student asked. "Iranian students will
continue opposing this project in the
future. Actually, the Iranian
government recently gave $22 billion
to the U.S. government, so this $1

million is just a drop in the bucket,"
he added.
The student charged that Parker
and Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan, also a principal investigator
on the project, could not effectively
fulfill "their goal" of educating
Iranians.
"1... many times informed
Lusignan and Parker that they are not
in a position to educate the Iranian
people. So ... they are, in fact, doing
the project for the money ... and to
survive on this campus," he insisted.
But Parker and Lusignan denied the
charge.
'Helping Rural Iran'
"Well, that's certainly not my
motivation for doing it," Parker said.
"I'm doing my part to help.... [It is]
an opportunity to help those
in ... rural Iran."
"I don't know quite how to
respond to that," Lusignan began.
"We're working closely with people in
Iran and with the educational
institutions in Iran. We ourselves are
not going to educate anyone in Iran.
But we are going... to help answer
some of the very broad questions
about the relationships of education
and rural development," he concluded.
The Iranian student disagreed.
".The whole involvement is sick. It's
sick because of money. This $1 million
is just for planning. Eventually, the
whole project will cost $4 billion," he
said.
"This $4 billion is not going to help
Iranians. It is going to help some
private industry here, and at best only
a very, very small percentage of the
Iranian people. It will primarily be
spent for military purposes," he
added.
Parker said the $4 billion figure
"seems to be way too high."
Under the contract with Iran,
Lusignan and Electrical Engineering
235 students would design a domestic
communication system for National
Iranian Radio Television (NIRT), with
advice from Parker.
Two-Part Study
Five members of the NIRT
technical staff have been residing here
since January to work on the project.
The technical phase of the two-part
study will involve design of the
satellite and the ground stations
needed to provide television and
telephone service to an estimated 50
percent of Iran's rural population.
The educational planning phase will
study and recommend alternatives for
the production, distribution and
utilization of educational television
programs to be transmitted over the
Iranian satellite.
"The major significance of this
research lies in the opportunity to
develop and demonstrate the means of
bringing education, health and other
social services to the poorest and
remotest segments of the population
in developing countries," Parker
asserted.

"It's just a sad story, isn't it?" the
student asked. "Iranian students will
continue opposing this project in the
future. Actually, the Iranian
government recently gave $22 billion
to the U.S. government, so this $1

million is just a drop in the bucket,"
he added.
The student charged that Parker
and Electrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan, also a principal investigator
on the project, could not effectively
fulfill "their goal" of educating
Iranians.
"1... many times informed
Lusignan and Parker that they are not
in a position to educate the Iranian
people. So ... they are, in fact, doing
the project for the money ... and to
survive on this campus," he insisted.
But Parker and Lusignan denied the
charge.
'Helping Rural Iran'
"Well, that's certainly not my
motivation for doing it," Parker said.
"I'm doing my part to help.... [It is]
an opportunity to help those
in ... rural Iran."
"I don't know quite how to
respond to that," Lusignan began.
"We're working closely with people in
Iran and with the educational
institutions in Iran. We ourselves are
not going to educate anyone in Iran.
But we are going... to help answer
some of the very broad questions
about the relationships of education
and rural development," he concluded.
The Iranian student disagreed.
".The whole involvement is sick. It's
sick because of money. This $1 million
is just for planning. Eventually, the
whole project will cost $4 billion," he
said.
"This $4 billion is not going to help
Iranians. It is going to help some
private industry here, and at best only
a very, very small percentage of the
Iranian people. It will primarily be
spent for military purposes," he
added.
Parker said the $4 billion figure
"seems to be way too high."
Under the contract with Iran,
Lusignan and Electrical Engineering
235 students would design a domestic
communication system for National
Iranian Radio Television (NIRT), with
advice from Parker.
Two-Part Study
Five members of the NIRT
technical staff have been residing here
since January to work on the project.
The technical phase of the two-part
study will involve design of the
satellite and the ground stations
needed to provide television and
telephone service to an estimated 50
percent of Iran's rural population.
The educational planning phase will
study and recommend alternatives for
the production, distribution and
utilization of educational television
programs to be transmitted over the
Iranian satellite.
"The major significance of this
research lies in the opportunity to
develop and demonstrate the means of
bringing education, health and other
social services to the poorest and
remotest segments of the population
in developing countries," Parker
asserted.
The University has signed a
controversial contract to assist in
planning an Iranian communication
satellite system, it announced
yesterday.
Although the $978,000 three-year
contract was signed in Tehran, Iran,
nearly two weeks ago, confirmation of
the signing was delayed, according to
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker,
one of the principal investigators in
the study.
"The contract has just been
signed... we had been operating
under a condition where we had a
letter of intent to sign from the
Iranian government. We didn't want to
release the news during spring break,
while everyone was away," Parker
commented.
The contract was signed despite
protests from Iranian students here
and others. Less than four weeks ago,
more than 200 students rallied in
White Plaza to protest the
then-imminent agreement.
Unhealthy Liaison
One Iranian student, who requested
anonymity, said last night that the
Stanford/Iran contract is part of a
continuing unhealthy liaison between
Iran and U.S. interests.
"It's just a sad story, isn't it?" the
student asked. "Iranian students will
continue opposing this project in the
