# Treatment 'Discrepancy' Cited
## Cowell Weekend Service Blasted 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Hammarskjold House members
have accused Cowell Student Health
Center of "an unjustifiable
discrepancy between treatment during
regular office hours and that received
on the weekends."
Dr. James McClenahan, director of
the Student Health Service, has
defended Cowell's emergency services
system as being designed to render
adequate medical treatments to
students during evenings and
weekends.
The controversy has arisen out of a
recent incident involving
Hammarskjold House member Ato
Mensah. House members are
questioning the treatment given to
Mensah and the fact that no x-rays
were taken until two days later
because Mensah was injured on a
Saturday.
Mensah, an undergraduate from
Ghana, injured his leg last January
while playing soccer. After being
brought to Cowell by friends, a nurse
examined him and talked to Dr.
Kenneth Grevatt, a staff physician at
Cowell. Grevatt advised the nurse to
bandage Mensah's ankle, and told him
to return to Cowell on Monday for
x-rays.
Mensah was x-rayed the following
Monday and told that he had a broken
ankle. He was then referred to an
orthopedic surgeon at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic. Mensah's leg was set
that day. A week later he had a pin
inserted into his ankle.
Because Cowell is open only for

emergency service on weekends, and
so is not fully staffed, Mensah was not
x-rayed that Saturday afternoon.
McClenahan said that "there is no
policy here not to have x-rays taken
on weekends until Monday." He
explained that "people in need of
x-rays are usually sent to the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic. Mensah wasn't referred
to the Clinic because it seemed to be a
low-risk sprain."
Hammarskjold House members
maintain that "the $40 per quarter
health insurance covers students seven
days a week; it seems reasonable to ask

that responsible treatment be
maintained throughout."
McClenahan said that "Dr. Grevatt
thought he was giving adequate
treatment by immobilizing the leg and
advising Mensah to elevate and stay off
his leg. It was a judgment call by Dr.
Grevatt, who thought it was more
likely a sprain and could wait until
Monday."
McClenahan emphasized "we were
not denying the patient treatment."
He added that "some people are not
x-rayed during weekday hours
because the physician thinks it's not
needed. Nine out of ten x-rays taken
here do not reveal fractures."
Referring to the Mensah case,
McClenahan called Cowell "a system
with humans in it. In the long run,
though, this case was handled
decently."
Discussing Cowell's after-hours and
weekend emergency service,
McClenahan said, "We average about
five people a night on weekdays and
about 60 people on weekends. Staff
is always on call at these times. We
don't receive complaints very often
about our emergency service."
"Cowell is open after hours for an
emergency or anything that is urgent,"
McClenahan said. He said an
emergency "was anything that can't
wait until the next day. I want to
remind students that the sign out front
also says Urgent care,' and if a student
thinks it's either an emergency or it's
urgent, he or she should call or come
here. We can assess the illness or injury
and plan the treatment."
