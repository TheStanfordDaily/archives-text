In an effort to cut costs and provide equality for women
athletes, the men's and women's athletic departments have
been combined into one Department of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation.
We believe that this merger is indeed a positive step
toward equality which creates a framework within which
women's intercollegiate athletics can grow.
Under the new set-up, one head coach will be appointed
for each sport. That coach will be responsible for scheduling,
recruiting, scholarships and coaching of both the men's and
women's teams. This system is apparently unique among
colleges with "big-time" men's athletic programs.
In sports such as basketball, tennis and swimming, these
head coaches will be men who have had much experience
with running intercollegiate programs. These men will have
the expertise necessary to build women's programs to
women assistant coaches, and training these women to
assume management roles. In time, there is no reason why
women cannot direct many of the programs at Stanford.
The new athletic department also reduces duplication by
merging — 1 women's equipment distribution, training
and sports information, and by placing responsibility for
physical education under one chairman, Assoc. Physical
Education Prof. Pam Straithairn.
The new system also provides for scholarships for
talented women athletes. Over the next four years, women
athletes will receive over 20 full-ride grants, and with the
creation of a women's fundraising program that number
could rise even higher.
We believe that a good women's athletic program is a
valuable addition to the University and think that the
merger of the departments represents a long-overdue
recognition of that fact.
