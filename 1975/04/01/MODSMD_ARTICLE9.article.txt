# Defending Rand
## 
### 
As three of the Ayn Rand
"freaks" Daniel Birnbaum
mentions in his article, "Capitalist
Opinion Obsolete " (Daily, March
5), we cannot be silent in the face
of his blatant ignorance of Ayn
Rand's philosophy and of
laissez-faire capitalism.
Webster's Dictionary defines
capitalism as "an economic
system characterized by private or
corporation ownership of capital
goods, by investments that are
determined by private decision
rather than by state control, and
by prices, production, and the
distribution of goods that are
determined mainly in a free
market."
Capitalists do not intend to
"run the world" as Birnbaum
claims, because the ethics of
capitalism are based on individual
rights (as Rand has shown in the
development of her philosophy).
Rand uses history to show how
the "evils of capitalism" have
actually been created by the
government as it abridged the
freedom of the individual. This
has been accomplished by
granting favors to businesses and
controlling industries.
Since the government has the
monopoly on the legal use of
force in the United States, the
only way a capitalist could "run
the world" is by enlisting the help
of the government, an action
which is not capitalistic. This is
the present state of affairs in the
United States, a result of the
intervention of the government in
the economy.
Looking at the facts of history,
laissez-faire capitalism has never
existed because there has always

Courtney, et 01.

been government intervention.
Birnbaum's statement that "for
hundreds of years, billions of
people have been bought, traded
and invested by capitalists" is
without any conceivable basis in
truth. It is merely a fabrication
used by collectivists.
The people to whom he refers
could by no means have been
capitalists as evidenced by the
description given in the preceding
paragraphs. They were instead
power hungry collectivists who
took advantage of the
opportunities present in the
United States without respecting
the principles of individual rights
on which this country was
founded (which were prerequisites
for these opportunities).
Birnbaum also falsely claims
tha the Rand "freaks" do not
understand "Lesson One," that
"The right to make money is not
at all similar to the right to pick
peaches off a tree." An
"Objectivist" or libertarian
would certainly agree with this
statement.
The right to make money is the
right to produce, and to use the
money received for this
production, as one chooses.
Capitalism is the only system of
economics which acknowledges the
individual right to do this.
The supremacy of individual
rights is what Mike Oliver is
searching for as Tim Ferguson
related in his column (Daily, Feb.
27).

As three of the Ayn Rand
"freaks" Daniel Birnbaum
mentions in his article, "Capitalist
Opinion Obsolete " (Daily, March
5), we cannot be silent in the face
of his blatant ignorance of Ayn
Rand's philosophy and of
laissez-faire capitalism.
Webster's Dictionary defines
capitalism as "an economic
system characterized by private or
corporation ownership of capital
goods, by investments that are
determined by private decision
rather than by state control, and
by prices, production, and the
distribution of goods that are
determined mainly in a free
market."
Capitalists do not intend to
"run the world" as Birnbaum
claims, because the ethics of
capitalism are based on individual
rights (as Rand has shown in the
development of her philosophy).
Rand uses history to show how
the "evils of capitalism" have
actually been created by the
government as it abridged the
freedom of the individual. This
has been accomplished by
granting favors to businesses and
controlling industries.
Since the government has the
monopoly on the legal use of
force in the United States, the
only way a capitalist could "run
the world" is by enlisting the help
of the government, an action
which is not capitalistic. This is
the present state of affairs in the
United States, a result of the
intervention of the government in
the economy.
Looking at the facts of history,
laissez-faire capitalism has never
existed because there has always

Courtney, et 01.

been government intervention.
Birnbaum's statement that "for
hundreds of years, billions of
people have been bought, traded
and invested by capitalists" is
without any conceivable basis in
truth. It is merely a fabrication
used by collectivists.
The people to whom he refers
could by no means have been
capitalists as evidenced by the
description given in the preceding
paragraphs. They were instead
power hungry collectivists who
took advantage of the
opportunities present in the
United States without respecting
the principles of individual rights
on which this country was
founded (which were prerequisites
for these opportunities).
Birnbaum also falsely claims
tha the Rand "freaks" do not
understand "Lesson One," that
"The right to make money is not
at all similar to the right to pick
peaches off a tree." An
"Objectivist" or libertarian
would certainly agree with this
statement.
The right to make money is the
right to produce, and to use the
money received for this
production, as one chooses.
Capitalism is the only system of
economics which acknowledges the
individual right to do this.
The supremacy of individual
rights is what Mike Oliver is
searching for as Tim Ferguson
related in his column (Daily, Feb.
27).
