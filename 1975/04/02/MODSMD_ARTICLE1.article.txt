# Olivieri Cuts ASSU Fee Allotments

### RANDALL TURK 
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri rejected outright 37 of the 63
petitions for next year's ASSU
program fee assessment allotments,
and sharply trimmed the other 26
requests in a budget proposal he
submitted to the Senate Monday
night.
The proposal cut the total
requested amount of $85,937.48 to a
slim $9500, a sharp decline from last
year's $23,000. If passed in the
upcoming elections, next year's ASSU
Program fee assessment will be only
$1.
"Quite obviously there were a lot
of people who weren't happy with my
recommendations," said Olivieri, who
admitted that arriving at his figures
"was not an easy matter."
Olivieri suggested that any groups
dissatisfied with the proposal should
present arguments at the ASSU Senate
Finance Committee's open meetings
this week and next and present their
arguments there.
Among those groups whose
requests for funds were not included
in Olivieri's proposal were all the
academic, religious and publication
organizations that applied.
Olivieri's Criteria
Olivieri said his priorities for
determining which groups should
receive funds were based on his
conviction that the program fee is
designed only for those groups which
are too small to file for their own fee
assessment, or are not affiliated with
any University department or outside
organization which could conceivably
fund them.
"Many of the requests boiled down
to an indirect tuition charge," said
Olivieri. "Academic groups like the
Hume Society and the Economics
Undergraduate Association shouldn't
be banging on the ASSU door, they
should be going to their affiliated
departments."
Olivieri also said that campus
religious groups should make their
appeals to the outside religious
organizations with which they are
affiliated.
Wine Tasting
"Many of these organizations
requested money for get-togethers and
wine tasting parties to encourage
fraternalization, which should
definitely not be funded by the
student body," he said.
"You can't tax students so that a
select group can have fun."
Groups requesting funds for guest
speakers and for operating costs for
their publications also were summarily
rejected by Olivieri. He claimed that
the ASSU Speakers Bureau and the
ASSU Publications Board were created
to fund these organizations, and that
all requests for such funding should be
submitted to them and not to the
Program Fee.
"The Publications Board and the
Speakers Bureau are going to have to
guage not only the needs of their
immediate constituency," he said,
"but of all organizations which have
auxiliary operations which come under
their jurisdiction."
