# Moynihan Isn't Choice Of Seniors
## 
### Stephen Carter 
Once upon a time, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan was an unknown economist in the
Labor Department.
Then Howard University, a predominantly
black institution in Washington, D.C., invited
then-President Johnson to give its
commencement address. Perhaps frantically
searching for a topic to appeal to his
obviously ethnic audience, Johnson asked the
Labor Department for assistance.
The Department produced The Negro
Family, which has since become infamous as
"the Moynihan Report." In that document,
Moynihan contended that the government
had done its part to assure equal rights to the
black community, and that attention should
shift to what he saw as the main problem of
black America: the collapse of the black
family unit.
The President used the idea in his speech.
Black America hated it. But Moynihan
became an overnight expert on black
sociology; in some quarters, he might have
been considered a hero.
Several years later, as an adviser to
President Nixon, Moynihan suggested a
period of "benign neglect" to help solve the
nation's racial problems, lie recommended
that the national civil rights effort move
away from the black community, and toward
"Indians, Mexican-Americans and Puerto
Ricans."
Unfortunately for Moynihan's analysis, a
group of black, chicano, Puerto Rican and
Native American "leaders" blasted his
proposal almost immediately. "To say that
greater attention should be given to other
ethnic groups and less to Negroes is,
incredibly, to miss the point of life in a
democratic society," their statement charged.
"We insist that equal attention be given to all
of them, since they are all afflicted with the
common problem of poverty or

discrimination or both."
Many scholars attacked Moynihan's
analysis, several pointing out that although
he might have been an economist of some
skill, he had never researched the black
community, and was not even a sociologist.
Others, not so tactful, simply called him a
racist.
In something over two months, Moynihan
will come to Stanford as commencement
speaker. In announcing this "decision" the
University proudly pointed to a book,
Beyond the Melting Pot, as evidence of his
scholarship.

Moynihan contributed exactly two
chapters to that book.
One wonders exactly why Moynihan
deserved the invitation. He is, one official
said, an "economist of some note."
That statement is literally true. Moynihan
is an economist. Moynihan is of some note.
But his notoriety has come from his
writings on the black community, the
scholarship of which has come under fire.
This alone, however, would not be reason to
disqualify him; certainly controversy should
not be a criteria for rejection.
Other factors should have weighed heavily
in the decision. The black community's
nearly unanimous opposition to the choice

cannot be denied. All but seven black seniors
signed a petition attacking the invitation.
The Anthropology Department faculty
and graduate students have also been
virtually solid in their assault on the decision.
And they, after all, are undeniably in a
position to evaluate Moynihan's scholarship.
But of course, none of these people were
consulted. In fact, as it turns out, almost no
one was consulted. Senior class officers
informally polled their constituents — or at
least such is the claim.
So far, I have been unable to find a single
senior who had any say at all — and certainly
not one who would have suggested
iVloynihan, had he had any say. How large an
"informal" sample could they have taken?
Vice President for University Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig noted, in another
University press release, that Moynihan's
name has been mentioned for several years as
a possible commencement speaker. If his
name has indeed been tossed around, surely
this year's seniors couldn't have been doing
the tossing. So the suggestion probably came
from elsewhere.
Where? There were no faculty members
on the panel which selected the speaker.
So this leaves the administration as the
source of the suggestion, pious denials to the
contrary.
It figures.
Of course, Daily reporters trying to
discover the selection process long before the
choice was announced were met with a terse,
but unbroken, string of "no comment"s.
But then, if you plan to make an
unpopular decision, why let anyone know in
advance how the decision is to be made? Or
even that the decision is to be made?
