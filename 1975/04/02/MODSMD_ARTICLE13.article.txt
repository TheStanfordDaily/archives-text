Too iViuch Control
Editor:
The Peter Carpenter report on
campus parking is foolish and an
example of over-control. Before
suggesting an alternative, I'd like
to carry the equity element of the
reoort a bit further. I do not use
the Main Library or UGLY; thus 1
am forced to pay for facilities 1
don't use. I use the swimming
pool every day; thus many other
students are helping to pay for my
exercise. For equity, I should get
a library rebate,but be required to
pay for tne pool.
An alternative solution is to
remove all parking restrictions.
After all, the only people who use
parking spaces are people who
belong on campus. People who
work in Palo Alto probably park
there, not on our campus.
The University is a community
and not a police state. Many of
the facilities are shared for use by
all members of the community.
We get much of our support from
alumni who remember Stanford as
a nice place to be. Let's keep it
that way.

Zap, Guthrie Decision Fair
Editor:
As an outsider who observed
its deliberations first hand, 1
would like to commend the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) subcommittee on
residences for the fair procedure it
used in choosing ZAP and Guthrie
as the new theme houses.
In response to past student
complaints, the committee
notified all of the houses under
consideration early in the decision
process. Before any prejudices
were established, each house was
given a fair chance to present its
side to the committee.
The final decision was based on
this input, as well as on historical
data on housing popularity and a
consideration of the house
organization.
In contrast to many other
University decisions, this one was
made almost entirely by students.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton did not vote, nor
did he voice his opinion while the
deliberations were going on.
Throughout the year, COSS
student committee members have
worked to improve the housing
system, often spending 10 to 20
hours a week in meetings. They
have been responsible for the new
housing draw system, the three
new Row houses, the 100
additional spaces at Florence
Moore, and the French and
Stanford-in-Stanford theme
houses.
Yet the siudents' only
remuneration has been constant
criticism in Daily columns.
It is natural for residents of
Guthrie and ZAP to protest the
choice of their houses. However,
the housing subcommittee
deserves praise, rather than
criticism, for making a difficult
decision through a fair process.

Stanford-in-Stanford theme
houses.
Yet the siudents' only
remuneration has been constant
criticism in Daily columns.
It is natural for residents of
Guthrie and ZAP to protest the
choice of their houses. However,
the housing subcommittee
deserves praise, rather than
criticism, for making a difficult
decision through a fair process.

Too iViuch Control
Editor:
The Peter Carpenter report on
campus parking is foolish and an
example of over-control. Before
suggesting an alternative, I'd like
to carry the equity element of the
reoort a bit further. I do not use
the Main Library or UGLY; thus 1
am forced to pay for facilities 1
don't use. I use the swimming
pool every day; thus many other
students are helping to pay for my
exercise. For equity, I should get
a library rebate,but be required to
pay for tne pool.
An alternative solution is to
remove all parking restrictions.
After all, the only people who use
parking spaces are people who
belong on campus. People who
work in Palo Alto probably park
there, not on our campus.
The University is a community
and not a police state. Many of
the facilities are shared for use by
all members of the community.
We get much of our support from
alumni who remember Stanford as
a nice place to be. Let's keep it
that way.

Zap, Guthrie Decision Fair
Editor:
As an outsider who observed
its deliberations first hand, 1
would like to commend the
Committee on Student Services
(COSS) subcommittee on
residences for the fair procedure it
used in choosing ZAP and Guthrie
as the new theme houses.
In response to past student
complaints, the committee
notified all of the houses under
consideration early in the decision
process. Before any prejudices
were established, each house was
given a fair chance to present its
side to the committee.
The final decision was based on
this input, as well as on historical
data on housing popularity and a
consideration of the house
organization.
In contrast to many other
University decisions, this one was
made almost entirely by students.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton did not vote, nor
did he voice his opinion while the
deliberations were going on.
Throughout the year, COSS
student committee members have
worked to improve the housing
system, often spending 10 to 20
hours a week in meetings. They
have been responsible for the new
housing draw system, the three
new Row houses, the 100
additional spaces at Florence
Moore, and the French and
Stanford-in-Stanford theme
houses.
Yet the siudents' only
remuneration has been constant
criticism in Daily columns.
