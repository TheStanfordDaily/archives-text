# Herb Caen: The Voice Of Frisco
## 
### 
Herb Caen sits by his
typewriter nonchalantly typing
his San Francisco Chronicle
column on a two-foot strand of
narrow pieces of paper taped one
to the next.
The windows of his private
office are open, and a cool
early-spring breeze mixes with the
subtle odor of newspapers
huddled atop Caen's desk.
Two telephones, one above the
desk and one below, sit passively,
awaiting the persistent ringing
which keeps Caen in business.
And on the wall, resting all alone,
is a two by four foot colored map of
the City - San Francisco.

San Francisco is the city Herb
Caen writes about. He loves the
City and always has since the days
he came down from Sacramento
as a kid during the '20s.
But Caen has noticed a change
in San Francisco over the last 35
years. "It's gotten dirty,
overcrowded, and run down," he
says. "Nobody cares anymore."
For Caen, his love affair with
the City is like a love affair with a
woman. "San Francisco's curvy,
it's got ups and downs, and ins
and outs. It has female attributes
and also male attributes — Coit
Tower for instance."
Caen's humor is about as
unobtrusive as a locomotive. He's

honest, sometimes disturbingly so,
and what he attributes to honesty
is often interpreted by others as
impudence. His indolent nature is
not easy to miss.
"So you finally reached me,"
he said to this reporter. "I wasn't
about to call you back. I don't
like interviews. I have nothing to
say."
And after agreeing to an
interview in his office he jests, "I
really can't talk, you know. It's
not part of my work."
The Voice
Caen's work is nothing less
than being the voice of San
Francisco. His column is one of
the most widely read in the city,

and his views are used to promote
motion pictures as well as to
attack the mayor.
Caen attributes his success to
people's "being lonely. After all"
he notes, "even a column is better
than nothing."
Gossip
And Caen has no pretensions
about the column being an
investigative piece. "It's a gossip
column anyway you look at it,"
he says. "People think I'm
insulted by that — but that's what
it is.
"It's also a very personal,
direct column for and about the
people of San Francisco. It's not a
column for a national audience."
Caen continues, "A column
like this helps bring the city
together. It helps people know
what's going on. If people are
interested in Carol Doda, how are
they going to find out about her
except through the column?"
Phyllis Diller — Etc.
From a recent column Caen
writes, "Hey, there, Phillis Diller,
Fang will be in town March 27!
That would be Mayor Fan Hsu
Chang of Taipei, Taiwan, who'll
Taiwan on with Mayor Joe at the
Hyatt Union Square that
noonday..
Or consider, "The Palace Hotel
is 100 years old this year, but so
far the only observance I've
noticed is the return of raisin
toast to the Golden Court."
Such is a sample of little tidbits
that have filled Herb Caen's
column six days a week for the
past 37 years.
'Every Day?'
When the column began there
were "no local columns in the
country except Walter
Winchell's," Caen points out. "I
wanted to write an article about
the City and editor Paul Smith
said, 'a column about San
Francisco every day? 1 can't see it,
but give it a try.'
'That was the last I ever heard
from him. The column's been
going on ever since and I'm still
waiting to hear from him."
Hard-Boiled
Caen sits comfortably in his
black leather swivel-chair and
talks of his city, the people, the
night life, the changes. If there is

such a thing, and I suppose there
is. Herb Caen is the classic picture
of the hard-boiled and well-salted
newspaperman you see in old-time
movies. Only the press hat is
missing.

night life, the changes. If there is

such a thing, and I suppose there
is. Herb Caen is the classic picture

newspaperman you see in old-time
movies. Only the press hat is

A MAN AND HIS CITY — In his private office on the third floor of the San Francisco Chronicle Ruilding,
gossip columnist Herb Caen looks out at his city. This is the man who tells San FYanciscans what they're all
about. How else would we know what "Carol Doda is doing"?
Herb Caen sits by his
typewriter nonchalantly typing
his San Francisco Chronicle
column on a two-foot strand of
narrow pieces of paper taped one
to the next.
The windows of his private
office are open, and a cool
early-spring breeze mixes with the
subtle odor of newspapers
huddled atop Caen's desk.
Two telephones, one above the
desk and one below, sit passively,
awaiting the persistent ringing
which keeps Caen in business.
And on the wall, resting all alone,
is a two by four foot colored map of
the City - San Francisco.

San Francisco is the city Herb
Caen writes about. He loves the
City and always has since the days
he came down from Sacramento
as a kid during the '20s.
But Caen has noticed a change
in San Francisco over the last 35
years. "It's gotten dirty,
overcrowded, and run down," he
says. "Nobody cares anymore."
For Caen, his love affair with
the City is like a love affair with a
woman. "San Francisco's curvy,
it's got ups and downs, and ins
and outs. It has female attributes
and also male attributes — Coit
Tower for instance."
Caen's humor is about as
unobtrusive as a locomotive. He's

honest, sometimes disturbingly so,
and what he attributes to honesty
is often interpreted by others as
impudence. His indolent nature is
not easy to miss.
"So you finally reached me,"
he said to this reporter. "I wasn't
about to call you back. I don't
like interviews. I have nothing to
say."
And after agreeing to an
interview in his office he jests, "I
really can't talk, you know. It's
not part of my work."
The Voice
Caen's work is nothing less
than being the voice of San
Francisco. His column is one of
the most widely read in the city,

and his views are used to promote
motion pictures as well as to
attack the mayor.
Caen attributes his success to
people's "being lonely. After all"
he notes, "even a column is better
than nothing."
Gossip
And Caen has no pretensions
about the column being an
investigative piece. "It's a gossip
column anyway you look at it,"
he says. "People think I'm
insulted by that — but that's what
it is.
"It's also a very personal,
direct column for and about the
people of San Francisco. It's not a
column for a national audience."
Caen continues, "A column
like this helps bring the city
together. It helps people know
what's going on. If people are
interested in Carol Doda, how are
they going to find out about her
except through the column?"
Phyllis Diller — Etc.
From a recent column Caen
writes, "Hey, there, Phillis Diller,
Fang will be in town March 27!
That would be Mayor Fan Hsu
Chang of Taipei, Taiwan, who'll
Taiwan on with Mayor Joe at the
Hyatt Union Square that
noonday..
Or consider, "The Palace Hotel
is 100 years old this year, but so
far the only observance I've
noticed is the return of raisin
toast to the Golden Court."
Such is a sample of little tidbits
that have filled Herb Caen's
column six days a week for the
past 37 years.
'Every Day?'
When the column began there
were "no local columns in the
country except Walter
Winchell's," Caen points out. "I
wanted to write an article about
the City and editor Paul Smith
said, 'a column about San
Francisco every day? 1 can't see it,
but give it a try.'
'That was the last I ever heard
from him. The column's been
going on ever since and I'm still
waiting to hear from him."
Hard-Boiled
Caen sits comfortably in his
black leather swivel-chair and
talks of his city, the people, the
night life, the changes. If there is

such a thing, and I suppose there
is. Herb Caen is the classic picture
of the hard-boiled and well-salted
newspaperman you see in old-time

said, 'a column about San
Francisco every day? 1 can't see it,

Caen sits comfortably in his
black leather swivel-chair and
talks of his city, the people, the
night life, the changes. If there is

newspaperman you see in old-time
movies. Only the press hat is
missing.
