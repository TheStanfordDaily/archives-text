### Steve Hefter 
I I Wl »
In talking of old times he
points out that back in 1938
Chronicle editor Smith was a man
who sought hard news for his
paper. He once told Caen, "Your
column has enough trivia to fill
this paper and 10 others."
A "hard news man" himself,
Caen sees today's Chronicle as
having "too much whimsy" and
"too much whimsy is like too
much whip cream."
Scattershot Technique
In his column, appropriately
entitled HERB CAEN, Caen uses
the "scattershot technique" to try

to reach as many people as
possible. By throwing in 25 items,
he says "at least one will appeal to
some people. So you build up a
good following, whereas in a long
essay type column, people will
read the first paragraph, become
uninterested and won't read it
anymore."
He adds, "There'll always be
gossip columns, Readership
surveys show they are very well
read."
One Man Show
Contrary to what most people
think, Caen's column is a one man
show. There are no leg men, only
a secretary and lots of "old
friends who phone in tips. And if
they don't call," Caen leans back
and smiles, "I call 'em up and say
'come on — give me some news.' "
And so the column goes on.
The column entails a lot of
work and Caen notes, "You can't
relax, can't stop; you're always
thinking about it. So you don't
think about it or you'd go crazy.
"You're always looking for a
story. Look at me," he clowns,
"I'm only 27 and I look 35."
Later, a bit more serious, he
adds, "I'm obsessed with the

column. It's on my mind all the
time. . . I've written columns since
high school and college."
Famous But Faceless
Herb Caen is one of the few
men whose words are known but
whose face is not. His columns
don't run with a picture and as a
result he says that he is often
impersonated by others.
"1 get phone calls from
restaurant owners," he says in his
quiet yet somewhat cynical voice,
"who are angry that i came in,
had a full meal with 10 drinks and
left without printing anything.'
But I never went there," he cries.
Keeps On Typing
And so the people keep getting
free meals and drinks pretending
they're Herb Caen or one of his
"non-existent leg-men," and Herb
Caen keeps writing about San
Francisco.
As Caen says,"It doesn't
bother me if the restauranteers are
dumb enough to give these people
free food. I hope it tastes good.'*'
The phone rings and the
typewriter goes back to work.
Maybe Caen will find some time
to call some people back and just
say hello. But as long as that
phone keeps on ringing you can
rest assured he won't.

a secretary and lots of "old
friends who phone in tips. And if
they don't call," Caen leans back
and smiles, "I call 'em up and say
'come on — give me some news.' "
And so the column goes on.
The column entails a lot of
work and Caen notes, "You can't
relax, can't stop; you're always
thinking about it. So you don't
think about it or you'd go crazy.
"You're always looking for a
story. Look at me," he clowns,
"I'm only 27 and I look 35."
Later, a bit more serious, he
adds, "I'm obsessed with the

column. It's on my mind all the
time. . . I've written columns since
high school and college."
Famous But Faceless
Herb Caen is one of the few
men whose words are known but
whose face is not. His columns
don't run with a picture and as a
result he says that he is often
impersonated by others.
"1 get phone calls from
restaurant owners," he says in his
quiet yet somewhat cynical voice,
"who are angry that i came in,
had a full meal with 10 drinks and
left without printing anything.'
But I never went there," he cries.
Keeps On Typing
And so the people keep getting
free meals and drinks pretending
they're Herb Caen or one of his
"non-existent leg-men," and Herb
Caen keeps writing about San
Francisco.
As Caen says,"It doesn't
bother me if the restauranteers are
dumb enough to give these people
free food. I hope it tastes good.'*'
The phone rings and the
typewriter goes back to work.
Maybe Caen will find some time
to call some people back and just
say hello. But as long as that
phone keeps on ringing you can
rest assured he won't.

I I Wl »
In talking of old times he
points out that back in 1938
Chronicle editor Smith was a man
who sought hard news for his
paper. He once told Caen, "Your
column has enough trivia to fill
this paper and 10 others."
A "hard news man" himself,
Caen sees today's Chronicle as
having "too much whimsy" and
"too much whimsy is like too
much whip cream."
Scattershot Technique
In his column, appropriately
entitled HERB CAEN, Caen uses
the "scattershot technique" to try

to reach as many people as
possible. By throwing in 25 items,
he says "at least one will appeal to
some people. So you build up a
good following, whereas in a long
essay type column, people will
read the first paragraph, become
uninterested and won't read it
anymore."
He adds, "There'll always be
gossip columns, Readership
surveys show they are very well
read."
One Man Show
Contrary to what most people
think, Caen's column is a one man
show. There are no leg men, only
a secretary and lots of "old
friends who phone in tips. And if
they don't call," Caen leans back
and smiles, "I call 'em up and say
'come on — give me some news.' "
