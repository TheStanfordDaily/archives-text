## Batsmen Go Homer Happy And Wallop UC-Irvine, 9-2 
### DAN PYNE 
Ah, the rites of spring. Bright
sunshine and green grass and
shorts and bikinis and warm winds
and cool breezes and deep tans
and baseball.
They were all on campus
yesterday, especially the Stanford
baseball team which sprung on the
UC Irvine Anteaters for a 9-2
victory.
Ah, the rights of spring. Last
year at this time the Cards were
struggling with a 10-15 record,
and even as recent as last quarter
(in the winter, that is) they were a
disappointing 6-10.
Now the sun is out and their
overall record is 18-12. Stanford
has won 12 of its last 14 games.
And the beginning of the Pac-8
season is but two days away.

"Things are looking good," is
the way coach Ray Young put it.
"Everyone is playing well. We
played about as well last week at
Riverside as a Stanford team has
played in a long time. We were 6-1
going into the final game.
"I'm very optimistic about our
chances in the Pac-8," iie
continued. "I'd say we're as solid
now as we're going to be."
The Cards were solid
yesterday.
Third baseman Gary Pitchford
gave Stanford the lead, scoring on
a series of Irvine errors in the first
inning. Anteater Steve Whitehead
drove a shot over the left field
fence to tie the score in the
second, but in the bottom half of
that inning left fielder Bob

Hampton homered and the Cards
were back on top. For good.
With one out in the third,
catcher Bruce Robinson sailed a
home run over the right field
fence. First baseman Tom
Guardino followed with a drive
that went over the left-center
collapsable fence. And the green
fence. And onto Harry Maloney
field.
Mike Williamson started and
picked up the win, throwing five
innings and allowing one run on
two hits. The victory put
Williamson's record at 5-2.
Freshman Dave Johnson
pitched the final four innings for
the Cards in his first varsity
appearance. He gave up one run,
four hits, walked two and struck

out one batter.
Stanford picked up three more
runs in the fourth, and their final
two in the fifth on a triple by
second baseman Joe Lamoure,
who led all hitters with three
RBIs.
Irvine's second run came in the
ninth; John Palmer blasted a
lead-off homer over the right field
fence. The Anteaters have a
season record of 7-15.
The Cards open the Pac-8
season against UCLA at Sunken
Diamond Friday and part of the
reason for Young's pre-Pac-8
optimism is the Stanford depth.
"We have better backup strength
than we thought we'd have at the
start of the season," he explained.
"That was one good thing about
all the injuries we had earlier this
year — it forced us to bring up
some younger players and try
them out, and they've done really
well."
Tomorrow Stanford plays UC
Davis at Davis, and sophomore
Jim Sharffenberger will start for
the Cards. Young reports that
only two pitchers have been
named as definite regulars for the
Pac-8 season — Al Arthur, who
posts a 5-1 record and a 1.66
ERA, and John Yandle, 2-3 with a
2.55 ERA. The leading candidates
for the third starting job are
Williamson, with a 2.20 ERA, and
Sharffenberger, 1-1 with a 3.55
ERA, but Young says"it could be
anyone."
