### GEORGE ANDERS 
Ted Marcy takes his precise
pommel horse routines to the
NCAA gymnastics finals at
Indiana State University
tomorrow in an effort to win his
second consecutive national title
in the event.
Marcy was ihe only Stanford
team member to do well enough

during the Pac-8 championships
last month at Berkeley to qualify
for the NCAAs. Two teammates,
Bob Farb and Bob Anderson, had
performed well enough in the
all-around earlier in season,
but placed only fifth and sixth
respectively at Berkeley — not
high enough to go on to Indiana
State.
Marcy's scores in tne Pac-8s —

9.575 in the compulsories and 9.7
in the optionals — were the
highest ones registered in any
college competition this year.
"No one can come near him,"
gymnastics coach Sadao Hamada
noted. Hamada expects Marcy to
have difficulties only if he gets
nervous under the pressures of the
finals.
But Marcy says that he has "a
little more confidence in my
abilities this year." He has added
some new stunts in his routines,
explaining "It's about time I did
something more difficult."
The finals will include
qualifying rounds tomorrow and
Friday, with the individual
championships determined on
Saturday. Defending champion
Iowa State has exceptional depth,
and is expected to rack up the
highest school score.
