# Trustees Okay New Residence Policy
## 
### JON BIGELOW 
Students entering the University as
freshmen will be guaranteed housing
for three out of four years under a
plan approved by the Board of
Trustees at their March 11 meeting.
Also under the new policy, transfer
students will be guaranteed on-campus
housing for their at Stanford.
In another action, the Board
authorized the construction of three
new row houses, which will cost an
estimated $3.7 million. The new
residences will each house 50
undergraduates.
The Board voted to reaffirm its
support for a strong student residence
program. Trustee Mary Wohlford said,
"There certainly is concern over the
lack of housing . . . but there just isn't
money to do anything effective." She
added that in order to build a dorm
for 700 students, the University needs
to raise $24 million, and "that's just
not going to happen in the near
future."

Wohlford said the "main thrust of
the discussion" at the meeting
concerned the fraternity program at
Stanford. She said that there is a
strong sentiment among several
members of the Board to keep the
fraternities intact, and that the
energies of some of the trustees seem
to be directed toward finding adequate
ways to fit the fraternities into the
housing system.
The Board also approved the
proposed operating budget for the
1975-76 school year, which provides
for $4 million in budget cuts. In spite
of the cuts, however, the University
expects a $1.9 million deficit for the
coming year.
Four projects were given priority at
the meeting to receive special
attention in the near future. These
include construction of the new Main
Library, renovation of History Corner
and Building 460 in the Quad, and
completion of the Seeley G. Mudd
chemistry building. The combined
expense of these projects will run to
$50 million; gifts and loan funding will
be used to pay these costs.
Wohlford said that the Mudd
Building is already funded, with large
sums of money provided by gifts and
the remainder having been borrowed.
As for the chance of getting the
necessary money to start work on the
library, however, she said, "I think it's
extremely negative."
The Board decided to place a high
priority on the renovation of the
structures in the Quad after receiving
reports that their condition is
deteriorating.
Among its other actions, the Board
approved the merger of the men's and
women's physical education
departments into the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation.

Building is already funded, with large
sums of money provided by gifts and
the remainder having been borrowed.
As for the chance of getting the
necessary money to start work on the
library, however, she said, "I think it's
extremely negative."
The Board decided to place a high
priority on the renovation of the
structures in the Quad after receiving
reports that their condition is
deteriorating.
Among its other actions, the Board
approved the merger of the men's and
women's physical education
departments into the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation.
Students entering the University as
freshmen will be guaranteed housing
for three out of four years under a
plan approved by the Board of
Trustees at their March 11 meeting.
Also under the new policy, transfer
students will be guaranteed on-campus
housing for their at Stanford.
In another action, the Board
authorized the construction of three
new row houses, which will cost an
estimated $3.7 million. The new
residences will each house 50
undergraduates.
The Board voted to reaffirm its
support for a strong student residence
program. Trustee Mary Wohlford said,
"There certainly is concern over the
lack of housing . . . but there just isn't
money to do anything effective." She
added that in order to build a dorm
for 700 students, the University needs
to raise $24 million, and "that's just
not going to happen in the near
future."

Wohlford said the "main thrust of
the discussion" at the meeting
concerned the fraternity program at
Stanford. She said that there is a
strong sentiment among several
members of the Board to keep the
fraternities intact, and that the
energies of some of the trustees seem
to be directed toward finding adequate
ways to fit the fraternities into the
housing system.
The Board also approved the
proposed operating budget for the
1975-76 school year, which provides
for $4 million in budget cuts. In spite
of the cuts, however, the University
expects a $1.9 million deficit for the
coming year.
Four projects were given priority at
the meeting to receive special
attention in the near future. These
include construction of the new Main
Library, renovation of History Corner
and Building 460 in the Quad, and
completion of the Seeley G. Mudd
chemistry building. The combined
expense of these projects will run to
$50 million; gifts and loan funding will
be used to pay these costs.
Wohlford said that the Mudd
Building is already funded, with large
sums of money provided by gifts and
the remainder having been borrowed.
