# JV Tops Canada
## 
### TOM GALLIGAN 
The Stanford junior varsity
baseball team ran its record to 6-4
yesterday as it defeated Canada
College 6-3. Several upper
classmen, down from the varsity
provided most of the punch.
Righthander Ed Matta, a relief
specialist with the senior squad,
started and went the distance for
the win. Second baseman Gary
Bei, who had been seeing action
previously as a varsity
pinch-runner recently, went two
for three at the plate, while Gary
Morton, a lanky first baseman, hit
a home run with no one on in the
third.
Catcher Rusty DuQuette and
outfielder Ray Cardinalli, who
started the season with the JVs
and moved up to the varsity about
one month ago, also joined the
apprentice club for the game.
The reason for the great influx
of varsity players (or non-players
as the case may be) is that right
after winter quarter every year the
JV team is cut, and many varsity
players who have not been seeing
a lot of action are moved down to
fill the gaps.

Prior to yesterday's game the
junior varsity's leading hitter was
freshman Ken Barkle. He went
one for three against Canada. The
second leading hitter, Paul
Stewart, went hitless in four
at-bats (Stewart has also seen
limited varsity action this year).
Sophomore Steve Abdo, the
leading hitter on last year's JV
squad is third in average this year
but Abdo's hopes for a second
straight batting title were severely
dimmed. Abdo pulled a hamstring
yesterday while running out a
sacrifice bunt and will be out
indefinitely.
Most of the pitching for the
JVs is done by members of the
varsity who have not pitched for
several days. Head Coach Ray
Young's reasoning for this is that
he does not want his pitchers to
go for prolonged periods without
game pressures.
Dave Johnson, at 2-2, is the
most dependable "pure" JV
pitcher. He threw for the varsity
yesterday, relieving Mike
Williamson after five innings.
The JV team meets Cal on
Thursday afternoon, 2:30 p.m., at
the JV diamond.

Most of the pitching for the
JVs is done by members of the
varsity who have not pitched for
several days. Head Coach Ray
Young's reasoning for this is that
he does not want his pitchers to
go for prolonged periods without
game pressures.
Dave Johnson, at 2-2, is the
most dependable "pure" JV
pitcher. He threw for the varsity
yesterday, relieving Mike
Williamson after five innings.
The JV team meets Cal on
Thursday afternoon, 2:30 p.m., at
the JV diamond.

KIOHT OK WONG? — Freshman Randy Wong scores Stanford's last run in the Card's 9-2 route of the
Cal-Irvine Anteaters (we kid you not) yesterday on the Sunken Diamond. Stanford coach Kay Young said
he was pleased with the squad s effort and said that the team should be a factor in the upcoming
Pacific Eight baseball season. K
The Stanford junior varsity
baseball team ran its record to 6-4
yesterday as it defeated Canada
College 6-3. Several upper
classmen, down from the varsity
provided most of the punch.
Righthander Ed Matta, a relief
specialist with the senior squad,
started and went the distance for
the win. Second baseman Gary
Bei, who had been seeing action
previously as a varsity
pinch-runner recently, went two
for three at the plate, while Gary
Morton, a lanky first baseman, hit
a home run with no one on in the
third.
Catcher Rusty DuQuette and
outfielder Ray Cardinalli, who
started the season with the JVs
and moved up to the varsity about
one month ago, also joined the
apprentice club for the game.
The reason for the great influx
of varsity players (or non-players
as the case may be) is that right
after winter quarter every year the
JV team is cut, and many varsity
players who have not been seeing
a lot of action are moved down to
fill the gaps.

Prior to yesterday's game the
junior varsity's leading hitter was
freshman Ken Barkle. He went
one for three against Canada. The
second leading hitter, Paul
Stewart, went hitless in four
at-bats (Stewart has also seen
limited varsity action this year).
Sophomore Steve Abdo, the
leading hitter on last year's JV
squad is third in average this year
but Abdo's hopes for a second
straight batting title were severely
dimmed. Abdo pulled a hamstring
yesterday while running out a
sacrifice bunt and will be out
indefinitely.
