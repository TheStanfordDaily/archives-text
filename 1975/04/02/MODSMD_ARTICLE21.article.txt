Daley Sweeps Mayoral Raee
CHICAGO — The old politics and the new
politics both appeared to have done well yesterday.
In Chicago, Mayor Richard J. Daley, one of the
last of the old-style city bosses, easily brushed aside
token challengers yesterday to win reelection to an
unprecedented sixth term as mayor.
Meanwhile, Paul Soglin, the 29-year-old mayor of
Madison, Wis., who was elected four years ago as a
radical, appeared also to have won reelection.
In another race, Mayor Wes Wise of Dallas won a
third term, defeating John Schoellkopf and three
other minor candidates in a race in which all
candidates ran without partisan backing.
Communists Advanee Unopposed
SAIGON — Virtually unopposed in their
steamroller advance, Communist-led tanks and
troops rumbled over the big coastal cities of Qui
Nhon and Nha Trang on Tuesday, routed defenders
from two more provinces within 10 miles of Saigon
and sent hordes more refugees fleeing for their lives.
In Saigon, the only big city still in government
hands, there were new calls for President Nguyen
Van Thieu to quit, and many persons were reported
making plans to buy their way out of the country,
where North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces now
control 15 of the 44 provinces, or roughly
two-thirds of South Vietnam's territory, and
outnumber Saigon troops two to one.
Nha Trang, 200 miles northeast of Saigon, and
Qui Nhon, South Vietnam's third largest city about
100 miles farther north, fell without any real
opposition when government officials and soldiers
abandoned them. Before the collapse, each city had
more than 200,000 residents.
Hundreds of refugees and civilians mobbed the
Nha Trang airport in efforts to get out of the city
safely. There was hysteria at the Air Vietnam
terminal where hundreds of people were waiting for
flights that never came. The American captain of an
evacuation plane hurled deserting soldiers to the
ground and handed aboard women and children.
The latest losses left the Saigon government in
control of only about one-third of the country's
land mass and only one of the four largest cities —
Saigon itself.
Hordes Flee Da Nang
SAIGON — The way the people of Saigon are
talking, the attempted mass exodus from the
northern city of Da Nang this week may have been
just the curtain raiser on a vast, final flight of
Vietnamese from their imperiled capital.
Scores of Vietnamese interviewed at random in
the city Monday said their wish was to flee South
Vietnam if Saigon begins to collapse in the chaos
that preceeded the Communist takeovers of Da
Nang and other cities on the coast.
The State Department estimates there are about
6000 Americans in South Vietnam. Half are
government employees and contractors working for

them, a quarter are businessmen, teachers,
missionaries and other non-U.S. government
personnel, and the rest are dependents.
Lon Nol Leaves Cambodia
PHNOM PENH — Amid farewell tears, exploding
shellfire and parting verbal shots from Russia and
India, President Lon Nol departed yesterday into
virtual exile in an eleventh hour effort to clear the
way for talks with the Communist-backed Khmer
Rouge. U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean was at
the airport to say goodbye.
On the battlefronts, military sources said the
government operation against the rebel rocket belt
around the airport was "temporarily suspended" so
troops cculd defend the capital. Communist-led
forces zeroed in on Neak Luong, the government's
last stronghold on the Mekong River 32 miles
southeast of Phnom Penh, and Battambang, the
second largest city, 180 miles northwest of Phnom
Penh.
In Phnom Penh itself, a man dressed in a military
uniform hurled a grenade into a crowded market,
killing five women and wounding 12 others, police
said. Initial reports said the man, who had been
arguing with a meat vendor, probably was a
disgruntled government soldier.
Lon Nol flew first to Thailand for a brief meeting
with Thai officials and then on to Indonesia, where
he will spend 10 days relaxing on the lush tourist
island of Bali. From there, Lon Nol, partly crippled
from a 1971 stroke, is to fly to Hawaii for medical
treatment, reliable sources say.
Eeonomy Will Grow, Says Simon
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary William E.
Simon said yesterday he is certain about an
economic upturn this year but still nervous about
the future. The stock market showed immediate
nervousness but at least one sign of long-term
confidence.
Announcement of two business indicators
reflected Simon's optimism. Volume of new orders
for manufactured goods increased in February for
the first time in six months and inventories — which
must be sold off before industries gear up
production and begin rehiring — are continuing to
grow at a slower rate, though not yet actually
falling.
Meanwhile, The Associated Press marketbasket
showed prices for 15 commonly purchased food and
nonfood supermarket items dropped 2.7 percent in
March. Of 13 cities checked, Only Providence, R. 1.,
and Albuquerque N.M., failed to show an over-all
drop.
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Simon said in
an interview that the recession probably will hit
bottom in midyear, with positive economic growth
beginning in the fourth quarter.
"There is nothing the government can do, or
cannot do, to stop the economic recovery — it's on
schedule," he said.

Utility Overcharges Continue
WASHINGTON — Investigators have uncovered
another half million dollars of overcharges for fuel
oil sold to electric utilities, bringing the known total
to more than $1.2 million in only four of the 200
cases under investigation, a federal official said
yesterday.
Investigators suspect a total of $19.7 million may
have been overcharged on utility fuel.
While electric utility rates are regulated, the
utilities may raise their rates to pass along increased
fuel costs, so that fuel overcharges may turn up
quickly as increases on the electric bills of
homeowners, businessmen and industries.
John Carter, head of the utility fuel investigation
for the Federal Energy Administration, revealed
that two fuel suppliers have signed agreements to
pay back overcharges.
Maharaj Ji Labeled "Playboy'"
NEW DELHI — The mother of Guru Maharaj Ji,
the 17-year-old Indian religious leader now living in
the United States with an American wife, renounced
him yesterday and accused him of being a playboy
instead of a holy man.
In a signed statement, his mother declared she
was removing her son as spiritual leader of the
Divine Light Mission and no longer recognized him
as the "perfect master," as he is known to his
followers.
Known as Shri Mataji, or holy mother, she said
her son, "under the instigation of certain bad
elements in the United States Divine Light Mission,
has continuously disrespected my will by adopting a
despicable, nonspiritual way of life."
Susan Butcher, a 30-year-old Canadian devotee
of the Divine Light Movement, said the Guru's
relatives in India were upset with the way Maharaj Ji
was living in the United States.
"He has not been practicing what he has been
preaching," said Butcher, who became a devotee of
the Guru when he visited Toronto in 1971.
Speaking in behalf of the Guru's mother, Butcher
said, "He has always preached and recommended his
devotees to live a life of vegetarianism, celibacy and
abstaining from alcohol and all excessive forms of
materialism. Now he himself is indulging and
encouraging his devotees to eat meat, to get married
and have sexual relations and to drink. He's not
living a spiritual life. He's being a playboy."
Butcher said she thought many of the guru's
devotees, which number eight million in India,
would still remain faithful to the Divine Light
teachings, although they would not recognize him as
their leader.
Today's Weather
Fair this afternoon. Increasing cloudiness in the
afternoon then mostly cloudy tonight and
tomorrow with a chance of showers. Cooler
tomorrow. Lows tonight in the 40s.

and sent hordes more refugees fleeing for their lives.
In Saigon, the only big city still in government
hands, there were new calls for President Nguyen
Van Thieu to quit, and many persons were reported
making plans to buy their way out of the country,
where North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces now
control 15 of the 44 provinces, or roughly
two-thirds of South Vietnam's territory, and
outnumber Saigon troops two to one.
Nha Trang, 200 miles northeast of Saigon, and
Qui Nhon, South Vietnam's third largest city about
100 miles farther north, fell without any real
opposition when government officials and soldiers
abandoned them. Before the collapse, each city had
more than 200,000 residents.
Hundreds of refugees and civilians mobbed the
Nha Trang airport in efforts to get out of the city
safely. There was hysteria at the Air Vietnam
terminal where hundreds of people were waiting for
flights that never came. The American captain of an
evacuation plane hurled deserting soldiers to the
ground and handed aboard women and children.
The latest losses left the Saigon government in
control of only about one-third of the country's
land mass and only one of the four largest cities —
Saigon itself.
Hordes Flee Da Nang
SAIGON — The way the people of Saigon are
talking, the attempted mass exodus from the
northern city of Da Nang this week may have been
just the curtain raiser on a vast, final flight of
Vietnamese from their imperiled capital.
Scores of Vietnamese interviewed at random in
the city Monday said their wish was to flee South
Vietnam if Saigon begins to collapse in the chaos
that preceeded the Communist takeovers of Da
Nang and other cities on the coast.
The State Department estimates there are about
6000 Americans in South Vietnam. Half are
government employees and contractors working for

them, a quarter are businessmen, teachers,
missionaries and other non-U.S. government
personnel, and the rest are dependents.
Lon Nol Leaves Cambodia
PHNOM PENH — Amid farewell tears, exploding
shellfire and parting verbal shots from Russia and
India, President Lon Nol departed yesterday into
virtual exile in an eleventh hour effort to clear the
way for talks with the Communist-backed Khmer
Rouge. U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean was at
the airport to say goodbye.
On the battlefronts, military sources said the
government operation against the rebel rocket belt
around the airport was "temporarily suspended" so
troops cculd defend the capital. Communist-led
forces zeroed in on Neak Luong, the government's
last stronghold on the Mekong River 32 miles
southeast of Phnom Penh, and Battambang, the
second largest city, 180 miles northwest of Phnom
Penh.
In Phnom Penh itself, a man dressed in a military
uniform hurled a grenade into a crowded market,
killing five women and wounding 12 others, police
said. Initial reports said the man, who had been
arguing with a meat vendor, probably was a
disgruntled government soldier.
Lon Nol flew first to Thailand for a brief meeting
with Thai officials and then on to Indonesia, where
he will spend 10 days relaxing on the lush tourist
island of Bali. From there, Lon Nol, partly crippled
from a 1971 stroke, is to fly to Hawaii for medical
treatment, reliable sources say.
Eeonomy Will Grow, Says Simon
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary William E.
Simon said yesterday he is certain about an
economic upturn this year but still nervous about
the future. The stock market showed immediate
nervousness but at least one sign of long-term
confidence.
Announcement of two business indicators
reflected Simon's optimism. Volume of new orders
for manufactured goods increased in February for
the first time in six months and inventories — which
must be sold off before industries gear up
production and begin rehiring — are continuing to
grow at a slower rate, though not yet actually
falling.
Meanwhile, The Associated Press marketbasket
showed prices for 15 commonly purchased food and
nonfood supermarket items dropped 2.7 percent in
March. Of 13 cities checked, Only Providence, R. 1.,
and Albuquerque N.M., failed to show an over-all
drop.
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Simon said in
an interview that the recession probably will hit
bottom in midyear, with positive economic growth
beginning in the fourth quarter.
"There is nothing the government can do, or
cannot do, to stop the economic recovery — it's on
schedule," he said.

Utility Overcharges Continue
WASHINGTON — Investigators have uncovered
another half million dollars of overcharges for fuel
oil sold to electric utilities, bringing the known total
to more than $1.2 million in only four of the 200
cases under investigation, a federal official said
yesterday.
Investigators suspect a total of $19.7 million may
have been overcharged on utility fuel.
While electric utility rates are regulated, the
utilities may raise their rates to pass along increased
fuel costs, so that fuel overcharges may turn up
quickly as increases on the electric bills of
homeowners, businessmen and industries.
John Carter, head of the utility fuel investigation
for the Federal Energy Administration, revealed
that two fuel suppliers have signed agreements to
pay back overcharges.
Maharaj Ji Labeled "Playboy'"
NEW DELHI — The mother of Guru Maharaj Ji,
the 17-year-old Indian religious leader now living in
the United States with an American wife, renounced
him yesterday and accused him of being a playboy
instead of a holy man.
In a signed statement, his mother declared she
was removing her son as spiritual leader of the
Divine Light Mission and no longer recognized him
as the "perfect master," as he is known to his
followers.
Known as Shri Mataji, or holy mother, she said
her son, "under the instigation of certain bad
elements in the United States Divine Light Mission,
has continuously disrespected my will by adopting a
despicable, nonspiritual way of life."
Susan Butcher, a 30-year-old Canadian devotee
of the Divine Light Movement, said the Guru's
relatives in India were upset with the way Maharaj Ji
was living in the United States.
"He has not been practicing what he has been
preaching," said Butcher, who became a devotee of
the Guru when he visited Toronto in 1971.
Speaking in behalf of the Guru's mother, Butcher
said, "He has always preached and recommended his
devotees to live a life of vegetarianism, celibacy and
abstaining from alcohol and all excessive forms of
materialism. Now he himself is indulging and
encouraging his devotees to eat meat, to get married
and have sexual relations and to drink. He's not
living a spiritual life. He's being a playboy."
Butcher said she thought many of the guru's
devotees, which number eight million in India,
would still remain faithful to the Divine Light
teachings, although they would not recognize him as
their leader.
Today's Weather
Fair this afternoon. Increasing cloudiness in the
afternoon then mostly cloudy tonight and
tomorrow with a chance of showers. Cooler
tomorrow. Lows tonight in the 40s.
Daley Sweeps Mayoral Raee
CHICAGO — The old politics and the new
politics both appeared to have done well yesterday.
In Chicago, Mayor Richard J. Daley, one of the
last of the old-style city bosses, easily brushed aside
token challengers yesterday to win reelection to an
unprecedented sixth term as mayor.
Meanwhile, Paul Soglin, the 29-year-old mayor of
Madison, Wis., who was elected four years ago as a
radical, appeared also to have won reelection.
In another race, Mayor Wes Wise of Dallas won a
third term, defeating John Schoellkopf and three
other minor candidates in a race in which all
candidates ran without partisan backing.
Communists Advanee Unopposed
SAIGON — Virtually unopposed in their

Saigon itself.
Hordes Flee Da Nang
SAIGON — The way the people of Saigon are
talking, the attempted mass exodus from the
northern city of Da Nang this week may have been
just the curtain raiser on a vast, final flight of
Vietnamese from their imperiled capital.
Scores of Vietnamese interviewed at random in
the city Monday said their wish was to flee South
Vietnam if Saigon begins to collapse in the chaos
that preceeded the Communist takeovers of Da
Nang and other cities on the coast.
The State Department estimates there are about
6000 Americans in South Vietnam. Half are
government employees and contractors working for

them, a quarter are businessmen, teachers,
missionaries and other non-U.S. government
personnel, and the rest are dependents.
Lon Nol Leaves Cambodia
PHNOM PENH — Amid farewell tears, exploding
shellfire and parting verbal shots from Russia and
India, President Lon Nol departed yesterday into
virtual exile in an eleventh hour effort to clear the
way for talks with the Communist-backed Khmer
Rouge. U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean was at
the airport to say goodbye.
On the battlefronts, military sources said the
government operation against the rebel rocket belt
around the airport was "temporarily suspended" so
troops cculd defend the capital. Communist-led
forces zeroed in on Neak Luong, the government's
last stronghold on the Mekong River 32 miles
southeast of Phnom Penh, and Battambang, the
second largest city, 180 miles northwest of Phnom
Penh.
In Phnom Penh itself, a man dressed in a military
uniform hurled a grenade into a crowded market,
killing five women and wounding 12 others, police
said. Initial reports said the man, who had been
arguing with a meat vendor, probably was a
disgruntled government soldier.
Lon Nol flew first to Thailand for a brief meeting
with Thai officials and then on to Indonesia, where
he will spend 10 days relaxing on the lush tourist
island of Bali. From there, Lon Nol, partly crippled
from a 1971 stroke, is to fly to Hawaii for medical
treatment, reliable sources say.
Eeonomy Will Grow, Says Simon
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary William E.
Simon said yesterday he is certain about an
economic upturn this year but still nervous about
the future. The stock market showed immediate
nervousness but at least one sign of long-term
confidence.
Announcement of two business indicators
reflected Simon's optimism. Volume of new orders
for manufactured goods increased in February for
the first time in six months and inventories — which
must be sold off before industries gear up
production and begin rehiring — are continuing to
grow at a slower rate, though not yet actually
falling.
Meanwhile, The Associated Press marketbasket
showed prices for 15 commonly purchased food and
nonfood supermarket items dropped 2.7 percent in
March. Of 13 cities checked, Only Providence, R. 1.,
and Albuquerque N.M., failed to show an over-all
drop.
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Simon said in
an interview that the recession probably will hit
bottom in midyear, with positive economic growth
beginning in the fourth quarter.
"There is nothing the government can do, or
cannot do, to stop the economic recovery — it's on
schedule," he said.

Utility Overcharges Continue
WASHINGTON — Investigators have uncovered
another half million dollars of overcharges for fuel
oil sold to electric utilities, bringing the known total
to more than $1.2 million in only four of the 200
cases under investigation, a federal official said
yesterday.
Investigators suspect a total of $19.7 million may
have been overcharged on utility fuel.
While electric utility rates are regulated, the
utilities may raise their rates to pass along increased
fuel costs, so that fuel overcharges may turn up
quickly as increases on the electric bills of
homeowners, businessmen and industries.
John Carter, head of the utility fuel investigation
for the Federal Energy Administration, revealed
that two fuel suppliers have signed agreements to
pay back overcharges.
Maharaj Ji Labeled "Playboy'"
NEW DELHI — The mother of Guru Maharaj Ji,
the 17-year-old Indian religious leader now living in
the United States with an American wife, renounced
him yesterday and accused him of being a playboy
instead of a holy man.
In a signed statement, his mother declared she
was removing her son as spiritual leader of the
Divine Light Mission and no longer recognized him
as the "perfect master," as he is known to his
followers.
Known as Shri Mataji, or holy mother, she said
her son, "under the instigation of certain bad
elements in the United States Divine Light Mission,
has continuously disrespected my will by adopting a
despicable, nonspiritual way of life."
Susan Butcher, a 30-year-old Canadian devotee
of the Divine Light Movement, said the Guru's
relatives in India were upset with the way Maharaj Ji
was living in the United States.
"He has not been practicing what he has been
preaching," said Butcher, who became a devotee of
the Guru when he visited Toronto in 1971.
Speaking in behalf of the Guru's mother, Butcher
said, "He has always preached and recommended his
devotees to live a life of vegetarianism, celibacy and
abstaining from alcohol and all excessive forms of
materialism. Now he himself is indulging and
encouraging his devotees to eat meat, to get married
and have sexual relations and to drink. He's not
living a spiritual life. He's being a playboy."
Butcher said she thought many of the guru's
devotees, which number eight million in India,
would still remain faithful to the Divine Light
teachings, although they would not recognize him as
their leader.
Today's Weather

Daley Sweeps Mayoral Raee
CHICAGO — The old politics and the new
politics both appeared to have done well yesterday.
In Chicago, Mayor Richard J. Daley, one of the
last of the old-style city bosses, easily brushed aside
token challengers yesterday to win reelection to an
unprecedented sixth term as mayor.
Meanwhile, Paul Soglin, the 29-year-old mayor of
Madison, Wis., who was elected four years ago as a
radical, appeared also to have won reelection.
In another race, Mayor Wes Wise of Dallas won a
third term, defeating John Schoellkopf and three
other minor candidates in a race in which all
candidates ran without partisan backing.
Communists Advanee Unopposed
SAIGON — Virtually unopposed in their
steamroller advance, Communist-led tanks and
troops rumbled over the big coastal cities of Qui
Nhon and Nha Trang on Tuesday, routed defenders
from two more provinces within 10 miles of Saigon
and sent hordes more refugees fleeing for their lives.
In Saigon, the only big city still in government
hands, there were new calls for President Nguyen
Van Thieu to quit, and many persons were reported
making plans to buy their way out of the country,
where North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces now
control 15 of the 44 provinces, or roughly
two-thirds of South Vietnam's territory, and
outnumber Saigon troops two to one.
Nha Trang, 200 miles northeast of Saigon, and
Qui Nhon, South Vietnam's third largest city about
100 miles farther north, fell without any real
opposition when government officials and soldiers
abandoned them. Before the collapse, each city had
more than 200,000 residents.
Hundreds of refugees and civilians mobbed the
Nha Trang airport in efforts to get out of the city
safely. There was hysteria at the Air Vietnam
terminal where hundreds of people were waiting for
flights that never came. The American captain of an

6000 Americans in South Vietnam. Half are
government employees and contractors working for

them, a quarter are businessmen, teachers,
missionaries and other non-U.S. government
personnel, and the rest are dependents.
Lon Nol Leaves Cambodia
PHNOM PENH — Amid farewell tears, exploding
shellfire and parting verbal shots from Russia and
India, President Lon Nol departed yesterday into
virtual exile in an eleventh hour effort to clear the
way for talks with the Communist-backed Khmer
Rouge. U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean was at
the airport to say goodbye.
On the battlefronts, military sources said the
government operation against the rebel rocket belt
around the airport was "temporarily suspended" so
troops cculd defend the capital. Communist-led
forces zeroed in on Neak Luong, the government's
last stronghold on the Mekong River 32 miles
southeast of Phnom Penh, and Battambang, the
second largest city, 180 miles northwest of Phnom
Penh.
In Phnom Penh itself, a man dressed in a military
uniform hurled a grenade into a crowded market,
killing five women and wounding 12 others, police
said. Initial reports said the man, who had been
arguing with a meat vendor, probably was a
disgruntled government soldier.
Lon Nol flew first to Thailand for a brief meeting
with Thai officials and then on to Indonesia, where
he will spend 10 days relaxing on the lush tourist
island of Bali. From there, Lon Nol, partly crippled
from a 1971 stroke, is to fly to Hawaii for medical
treatment, reliable sources say.
Eeonomy Will Grow, Says Simon
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary William E.
Simon said yesterday he is certain about an
economic upturn this year but still nervous about
the future. The stock market showed immediate
nervousness but at least one sign of long-term
confidence.
Announcement of two business indicators
reflected Simon's optimism. Volume of new orders
for manufactured goods increased in February for
the first time in six months and inventories — which
must be sold off before industries gear up
production and begin rehiring — are continuing to
grow at a slower rate, though not yet actually
falling.
Meanwhile, The Associated Press marketbasket
showed prices for 15 commonly purchased food and
nonfood supermarket items dropped 2.7 percent in
March. Of 13 cities checked, Only Providence, R. 1.,
and Albuquerque N.M., failed to show an over-all
drop.
In Washington, Treasury Secretary Simon said in
an interview that the recession probably will hit
bottom in midyear, with positive economic growth
beginning in the fourth quarter.
"There is nothing the government can do, or
cannot do, to stop the economic recovery — it's on
schedule," he said.

Utility Overcharges Continue
WASHINGTON — Investigators have uncovered
another half million dollars of overcharges for fuel
oil sold to electric utilities, bringing the known total
to more than $1.2 million in only four of the 200
cases under investigation, a federal official said
yesterday.
Investigators suspect a total of $19.7 million may
have been overcharged on utility fuel.
While electric utility rates are regulated, the
utilities may raise their rates to pass along increased
fuel costs, so that fuel overcharges may turn up
quickly as increases on the electric bills of
homeowners, businessmen and industries.
John Carter, head of the utility fuel investigation
for the Federal Energy Administration, revealed
that two fuel suppliers have signed agreements to
pay back overcharges.
Maharaj Ji Labeled "Playboy'"
NEW DELHI — The mother of Guru Maharaj Ji,
the 17-year-old Indian religious leader now living in
the United States with an American wife, renounced
him yesterday and accused him of being a playboy
instead of a holy man.
In a signed statement, his mother declared she
was removing her son as spiritual leader of the
Divine Light Mission and no longer recognized him
as the "perfect master," as he is known to his
followers.
Known as Shri Mataji, or holy mother, she said
her son, "under the instigation of certain bad
elements in the United States Divine Light Mission,
has continuously disrespected my will by adopting a
despicable, nonspiritual way of life."
Susan Butcher, a 30-year-old Canadian devotee
of the Divine Light Movement, said the Guru's
relatives in India were upset with the way Maharaj Ji
was living in the United States.
"He has not been practicing what he has been
preaching," said Butcher, who became a devotee of
the Guru when he visited Toronto in 1971.
Speaking in behalf of the Guru's mother, Butcher
said, "He has always preached and recommended his
devotees to live a life of vegetarianism, celibacy and
abstaining from alcohol and all excessive forms of
materialism. Now he himself is indulging and
encouraging his devotees to eat meat, to get married
and have sexual relations and to drink. He's not
living a spiritual life. He's being a playboy."
Butcher said she thought many of the guru's
devotees, which number eight million in India,
would still remain faithful to the Divine Light
teachings, although they would not recognize him as
their leader.
Today's Weather
Fair this afternoon. Increasing cloudiness in the
afternoon then mostly cloudy tonight and
tomorrow with a chance of showers. Cooler
tomorrow. Lows tonight in the 40s.
Daley Sweeps Mayoral Raee
CHICAGO — The old politics and the new
politics both appeared to have done well yesterday.
In Chicago, Mayor Richard J. Daley, one of the
last of the old-style city bosses, easily brushed aside
token challengers yesterday to win reelection to an
unprecedented sixth term as mayor.
Meanwhile, Paul Soglin, the 29-year-old mayor of
Madison, Wis., who was elected four years ago as a
radical, appeared also to have won reelection.
In another race, Mayor Wes Wise of Dallas won a
third term, defeating John Schoellkopf and three
other minor candidates in a race in which all
candidates ran without partisan backing.
Communists Advanee Unopposed
SAIGON — Virtually unopposed in their
steamroller advance, Communist-led tanks and
troops rumbled over the big coastal cities of Qui
Nhon and Nha Trang on Tuesday, routed defenders
from two more provinces within 10 miles of Saigon
and sent hordes more refugees fleeing for their lives.
In Saigon, the only big city still in government
hands, there were new calls for President Nguyen
Van Thieu to quit, and many persons were reported
making plans to buy their way out of the country,
where North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces now
control 15 of the 44 provinces, or roughly
two-thirds of South Vietnam's territory, and
outnumber Saigon troops two to one.
Nha Trang, 200 miles northeast of Saigon, and
Qui Nhon, South Vietnam's third largest city about
100 miles farther north, fell without any real
opposition when government officials and soldiers
abandoned them. Before the collapse, each city had
more than 200,000 residents.
Hundreds of refugees and civilians mobbed the
Nha Trang airport in efforts to get out of the city
safely. There was hysteria at the Air Vietnam
terminal where hundreds of people were waiting for
flights that never came. The American captain of an
evacuation plane hurled deserting soldiers to the
ground and handed aboard women and children.
The latest losses left the Saigon government in
control of only about one-third of the country's
land mass and only one of the four largest cities —
Saigon itself.
Hordes Flee Da Nang
SAIGON — The way the people of Saigon are
talking, the attempted mass exodus from the
northern city of Da Nang this week may have been
just the curtain raiser on a vast, final flight of
Vietnamese from their imperiled capital.
Scores of Vietnamese interviewed at random in
the city Monday said their wish was to flee South
Vietnam if Saigon begins to collapse in the chaos
that preceeded the Communist takeovers of Da
Nang and other cities on the coast.
The State Department estimates there are about
6000 Americans in South Vietnam. Half are
government employees and contractors working for

them, a quarter are businessmen, teachers,
missionaries and other non-U.S. government
personnel, and the rest are dependents.
