# ...But Scher Will
## Graham Won't Produce Here

San Francisco rock impressario Bill
Graham will not become involved in
producing Stanford concerts next year
even though ASSU Special Events
Director Danny Scher has joined his
staff, according to Graham, Scher and
several ASSU and Office of Public
Events officials.
Scher will promote outside concerts
of his own, including some at
Stanford, while in the employ of
Graham.
"[Scher] will be like a civil servant
moonlighting," Graham told the Daily,
"and with his talents and abilities
there should be no problems handling
the two jobs.
"I will have no connection with
Stanford," Graham insisted. "All that

will happen is that an open
environment will exist. The
competitive situation that has existed
will be replaced with one of
cooperation. There just will be fewer
problems in terms of booking and
placing of acts for our organization
and certainly for Stanford."
Graham did say, however, that his
FM Productions would continue to bid
for technical work for Stanford
concerts.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer

echoed Graham's comments. "Bill
Graham is in no way going to produce
concerts at Stanford," he said.
Already Begun
Scher signed the contract with
Graham on March 25 and has already
begun work on a part-time basis. When
he graduates from the Business School
in June and leaves his ASSU post, he
will work full time for Graham.
"I will be serving as a production
manager at nights," Scher said. "And

OH SAY CAN YOU SEE — It's easy to tell when spring is here: the residents of
Hammerskjold House begin flying their clothes at half-mast. All over campus,
people, frisbees, and footballs — as well as laundry — are soaking up the
California sun.
during the day I will be involved with
research on new entertainment and
development of new markets."
Scher's contract with Graham also
stipulates that he is free to work for
any Stanford organization. "When it
comes to Stanford," he said, "I am
going to be a free agent. I will be hired
to run a concert, to take care of all the
details such as hiring a group, locating
a place to hold the event, setting up
security and taking care of all the
technical problems."
He has already reached an
agreement with the Office of Public
Events to put on a Loggins and
Messina concert July 5. In addition, he
says he is "negotiating" with two
other Stanford groups — whom he
refused to name — on other summer

concerts.
The Office of Public Events is
paying Scher a straight retainer
without a share of the gross. But Scher
denied a statement that Mayer made at
Monday's Senate meeting that he will
work under the same arrangement
with the ASSU.
"No details have been worked out
yet," he insisted. "It could be the
same arrangement, but it might not
be." At present, according to Mayer,
Scher receives one to two percent of
the net above $5000 of any concert he
produces for the ASSU.
Graham said he hired Scher because
of his talents and "performance" at
Stanford. According to Mayer, the
ASSU has thus far earned $55,000 in
profits on Scher-produced concerts
this year.
Nothing Like This
"There's never been a year that
approached this," said Mayer. "For
the four years preceding Danny we
had annual deficits of $20,000 to
$30,000 a year, even with groups like
the Moody Blues and Chicago. On one
Grateful Dead concert we lost almost
$3000."
