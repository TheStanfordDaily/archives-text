# Miller Assures Return Of SCIRE Next Year
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
After rumors, recommendations
and protests about its possible
elimination, SCIRE will return next
year with approximately half of its
current budget, Provost William Miller
confirmed yesterday.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs last quarter had
recommended to Miller that the
program be terminated this June and
that SWOPSI be phased out by June
1976.
SCIRE Director Alice Supton said
the program will retain its name, office
space and activities, but will have only
a half-time director instead of a full
time director and a half-time assistant.
The $25,000 supplies budget will be
cut in half, she said.
'There will be half as much of the
same SCIRE," Supton explained,
adding that she hopes to be able to
accommodate all students with project
ideas next year.
She reported that the $4000 budget
for "filling curricular gaps" will remain
the same size next year. This fund,
which was started this year, is
providing money for courses in
chemistry for non-science majors and
Marxist social studies this quarter.
In addition to the half-time SCIRE
directorship next year, Supton will
assume a half-time position as assistant
to the dean of undergraduate studies.
"The dean wants some of SCIRE's
activities to be more closely related to
his office," she said, but most of her
SCIRE work will be handled from the
existing office.
Gibbs is also setting up an ad hoc
committee to study the future of

extradepartmental programs, such as
SWOPSI and Undergraduate Specials.
The 16-member panel will consider
several options, including continuation
of the programs or their integration
into an umbrella agency, he said.
When Gibbs proposed the
elimination of special programs, he
suggested the formation of an
Undergraduate Special Agency,
UNGRASPEL, to absorb several
programs now operating.
He acknowledged that his
recommendations met firm student
opposition, and said the committee
will "try to talk it out instead of being
confrontational about it."
'Victory'
ASSU Senator Debbi Silton, who
has been active in protests against the
elimination of special programs,
described the formation of the
committee as a victory for students.
"It shows that we were effective," she
explained, "that the students' voice is
finally being taken into
consideration."
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Cldfcson said he was
"cautiously optimistic" that the

committee will be able to work out an
acceptable relationship between
extradepartmental programs and the
dean's office.
The committee's 16 members
include a faculty member, student and
director from each program; a faculty
member and student from the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies;
Gibbs; Closson; possibly Associate
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Mason
Yearian; a representative from the
ASSU Senate and a faculty chairman
who has not yet been selected.
Considering 1976-77
Gibbs said that the committee will
submit its recommendations to him.
Decisions about next year's programs
have already been made, and the panel
will be considering the academic year
1976-77, he added.
Closson reported that SWOPSI and
Undergraduate Special programs will
continue next year much like they
were this year, "maybe with less
materials."
The dean's office hopes to get the
committee together by next week and
a report completed by the end of May,
Closson said.

'There will be half as much of the
same SCIRE," Supton explained,
adding that she hopes to be able to
accommodate all students with project
ideas next year.
She reported that the $4000 budget
for "filling curricular gaps" will remain
the same size next year. This fund,
which was started this year, is
providing money for courses in
chemistry for non-science majors and
Marxist social studies this quarter.
In addition to the half-time SCIRE
directorship next year, Supton will
assume a half-time position as assistant
to the dean of undergraduate studies.
"The dean wants some of SCIRE's
activities to be more closely related to
his office," she said, but most of her
SCIRE work will be handled from the
existing office.
Gibbs is also setting up an ad hoc
committee to study the future of

extradepartmental programs, such as
SWOPSI and Undergraduate Specials.
The 16-member panel will consider
several options, including continuation
of the programs or their integration
into an umbrella agency, he said.
When Gibbs proposed the
elimination of special programs, he
suggested the formation of an
Undergraduate Special Agency,
UNGRASPEL, to absorb several
programs now operating.
He acknowledged that his
recommendations met firm student
opposition, and said the committee
will "try to talk it out instead of being
confrontational about it."
'Victory'
ASSU Senator Debbi Silton, who
has been active in protests against the
elimination of special programs,
described the formation of the
committee as a victory for students.
"It shows that we were effective," she
explained, "that the students' voice is
finally being taken into
consideration."
Asst. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Cldfcson said he was
"cautiously optimistic" that the

committee will be able to work out an
acceptable relationship between
extradepartmental programs and the
dean's office.
The committee's 16 members
include a faculty member, student and
director from each program; a faculty
member and student from the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies;
Gibbs; Closson; possibly Associate
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Mason
Yearian; a representative from the
ASSU Senate and a faculty chairman
who has not yet been selected.
Considering 1976-77
Gibbs said that the committee will
submit its recommendations to him.
Decisions about next year's programs
have already been made, and the panel
will be considering the academic year
1976-77, he added.
Closson reported that SWOPSI and
Undergraduate Special programs will
continue next year much like they
were this year, "maybe with less
materials."
The dean's office hopes to get the
committee together by next week and
a report completed by the end of May,
Closson said.
After rumors, recommendations
and protests about its possible
elimination, SCIRE will return next
year with approximately half of its
current budget, Provost William Miller
confirmed yesterday.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs last quarter had
recommended to Miller that the
program be terminated this June and
that SWOPSI be phased out by June
1976.
SCIRE Director Alice Supton said
the program will retain its name, office
space and activities, but will have only
a half-time director instead of a full
time director and a half-time assistant.
The $25,000 supplies budget will be
cut in half, she said.
