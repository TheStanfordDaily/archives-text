# Parnes, Braunstein Sue Cal State-San Jose
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
SWOPSI Director Andrew Parnes
and former Stanford economics
graduate student Yale Braunstein are
among six economics professors fired
by Cal State-San Jose during the past
two years who claim that they were
dismissed solely because of their
radical economic and political views.
The former San Jose State
professors have taken their case to
court and persuaded the American
Economic Association's Committee on
Political Discrimination to investigate
the matter.
"We were fired because we are
radical political economists," said
Parnes, who was dismissed last May.
"That means that we were not merely
radical in the classroom, but that we
acted on what we taught. This
combination of theory and practice
caused us to be fired."
Parnes noted that the San Jose

State administration particularly
objected to the professors voting to
remove James Willis, the Economics
Department chairman.
According to Fames, the professors
opposed Willis because he tended to
represent the administration rather
than serve as a liaison between the
administration and the faculty.
Collective Bargaining
The fired professors also were
outspoken advocates of giving
professors collective bargaining rights,
according to Parnes.
Last summer, Parnes and several
other fired professors went to court,
requesting an injunction against their
dismissal. In a class action case Parnes
and abou* 100 others asked the court
to reclassify them as probationary
employees rather than temporary
employees in order that they could file
grievance actions.
After the court denied a
preliminary injunction, the court casp,
which Parnes called a "difficult,
thorny thing," was dropped.
Lawsuit Revival
Gayle Southworth, one of the fired
professors, told the Daily yesterday
that the United Professors of
California (UPC) is considering
reviving the lawsuit. The UPC would
pay all legal expenses, as it did in last
year's class action suit.
But Southworth and Parnes said
that the fired professors are now
placing much of their hope for
reinstatement in the investigation of
the case being conducted by the
American Economic Association's
Committee on Political
Discrimination.
The Committee, formed in January
and headed by Harvard Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, formerly of
Stanford, agreed to investigate the
matter.
Will Publish Find'ng
Arrow said that the Committee
plans to talk to anyone involved in the
case and hopes to publish a finding
later this spring
Arrow predicted that a conclusion
favorable to the fired professors might
cause San Jose State to reinstate them.
"The Committee has no formal
powers to impose sanctions, but it will
probably carry considerable moral
force," Arrow explained.
Southworth said it is "hard to
know" if the Committee will rule in
the favor of the professors, but h<>
charged that one of the Committee's
members, Stanford Business Prof.
Gerald Meier, might be prejudiced
against Parnes.
Southworth noted that during the
19605, Parnes was temporarily
dismissed from Stanford after he
oarticipated in radical demonstrations,
and Meier served on the judicial
committee that ordered Parnes'
dismissal.
