# New Search Committee Begins Seeking Faculty Member To Head Grad Studies
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
A search committee has been created to
recommend to Provost William Miller a faculty
member for the newly combined position of dean of
graduate studies and vice provost for faculty affairs.
Assoc. Psychology Prof. Herbert Clark, chairman
of the search committee, said yesterday the new
post was created "because of the current budget
crunch and also because the duties of vice provost
for faculty affairs should be handled by the dean of
graduate studies."
The search committee consists of Clark, Assoc.
Linguistics Prof. Clara Bush, Education Prof.
Alfredo Castaneda, Electrical Engineering Prof.
Anthony Siegman and Gavlord Neely, graduate
student in anthropology.
Clark said that the search committee was created
because Siegman, chairman of the Committee on
Graduate Studies, "felt that it wasn't properly the
duty of the Graduate Studies Committee alone. The
Graduate Studies Committee formed the nucleus for
this committee and other members were added.'
Current Dean of Graduate Studies Lincoln Moses
is resigning at the end of summer quarter. The new
dean's duties will include administration of graduate
studies, faculty housing and affirmative action for
the faculty. The dean will also handle

administration of faculty development programs,
which consist of all policies affecting the faculty in
future years, and includes hiring and tenure.
Miller, who created the new position, said he
hopes to complete the combination of the two
present positions within the next couple of years.
"By then the dean will be able to handle also the
vice provost's duties," said Miller.
Miller Duties
Miller stated that he would personally reassume
some of the duties of vice provost for Faculty
Affairs Arthur I. Bienenstock. These duties include
work on advancement and placement, grievances
and ad hoc reviews.
"Approximately one-half of the present vice
provost's duties will be delegated to the new dean,"
said Clark.
Bienenstock has agreed to remain as vice provost
for another year to assist the new dean and will then
return to the faculty. Bienenstock was unavailable
for comment yesterday.
'Considering Everyone'
Clark said that "we're considering everyone and
we haven't yet decided on characteristics and
criteria. We're looking for someone who is able,
intelligent, and who will be out for the best interests
of the graduate students and the faculty at

Stanford."
Siegman said the person nominated must be a
tenured Stanford faculty member. "Because of
budget problems we don't want to go outside the
University. We want someone who is sensitive to the
problems of graduate education from the point of
view of both the University and the students. We're
looking for someone who is acceptable to all parts
of the University that are concerned with graduate
education."
But Bush said "we haven't explored criteria yet.
We want as much input as possible from all sectors
concerning the most serious criteria prior to
considering the nominees. Most of us believe that
the concerns of the dean in this position are of
paramount importance over those of the vice
provost."
'Open'
Siegman also stressed that "we're as open as
possible to nominations." As of yesterday no formal
nominations had been made to the committee.
The search committee has scheduled a public
hearing for 4 p.m. Monday, in Room 041, Jordan
Hall. All Stanford faculty, staff, and students are
invited to attend the meeting or to make
nominations to the committee later.

Anthony Siegman and Gavlord Neely, graduate
student in anthropology.
Clark said that the search committee was created
because Siegman, chairman of the Committee on
Graduate Studies, "felt that it wasn't properly the
duty of the Graduate Studies Committee alone. The
Graduate Studies Committee formed the nucleus for
this committee and other members were added.'
Current Dean of Graduate Studies Lincoln Moses
is resigning at the end of summer quarter. The new
dean's duties will include administration of graduate
studies, faculty housing and affirmative action for
the faculty. The dean will also handle

administration of faculty development programs,
which consist of all policies affecting the faculty in
future years, and includes hiring and tenure.
Miller, who created the new position, said he
hopes to complete the combination of the two
present positions within the next couple of years.
"By then the dean will be able to handle also the
vice provost's duties," said Miller.
Miller Duties
Miller stated that he would personally reassume
some of the duties of vice provost for Faculty
Affairs Arthur I. Bienenstock. These duties include
work on advancement and placement, grievances
and ad hoc reviews.
"Approximately one-half of the present vice
provost's duties will be delegated to the new dean,"
said Clark.
Bienenstock has agreed to remain as vice provost
for another year to assist the new dean and will then
return to the faculty. Bienenstock was unavailable
for comment yesterday.
'Considering Everyone'
Clark said that "we're considering everyone and
we haven't yet decided on characteristics and
criteria. We're looking for someone who is able,
intelligent, and who will be out for the best interests
of the graduate students and the faculty at

Stanford."
Siegman said the person nominated must be a
tenured Stanford faculty member. "Because of
budget problems we don't want to go outside the
University. We want someone who is sensitive to the
problems of graduate education from the point of
view of both the University and the students. We're
looking for someone who is acceptable to all parts
of the University that are concerned with graduate
education."
But Bush said "we haven't explored criteria yet.
We want as much input as possible from all sectors
concerning the most serious criteria prior to
considering the nominees. Most of us believe that
the concerns of the dean in this position are of
paramount importance over those of the vice
provost."
'Open'
Siegman also stressed that "we're as open as
possible to nominations." As of yesterday no formal
nominations had been made to the committee.
The search committee has scheduled a public
hearing for 4 p.m. Monday, in Room 041, Jordan
Hall. All Stanford faculty, staff, and students are
invited to attend the meeting or to make
nominations to the committee later.
