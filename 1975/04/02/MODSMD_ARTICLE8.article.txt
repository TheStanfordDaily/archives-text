## Parking Report 
### 
The recently released report, "Recommended Parking
and Transportation Policies for Stanford University,"
presents a generally good framework within which future
change can be discussed implemented.
The report, prepared by Peter Carpenter, assistant vice
president for medical affairs, correctly recognizes that
driving on campus is a privilege for which all drivers should
pay. It puts the burden of transportation costs onto the
driver, rather than funding transportation out of the general
operating budget (much of which is comprised of tuition
dollars) as is now done.
The report also recommends that pedestrians and
bicyclists be given clear priority over cars. Thus, monies
collected from parking fees will, if the report is adopted, not
only finance much of the cost of police enforcement and
maintenance of parking lots and streets, but also pay for
better lighting of walkways, improvement of bike paths and
other alternate means of transportation, such as shuttle
buses.
We agree with this priority system, as Stanford is already
overburdened with cars, and alternate means of
transportation desperately need to be encouraged.
Obviously, Carpenter's plan means that parking fees must
be raised drastically. The study suggests that student
"residence /one" parking stickers cost $12 per quarter and
central campus stickers cost $15 per quarter.
These figures are high, but we think they are reasonable.
A high fee is necessary to discourage cars and begin
implementing plans for alternate means of transportation.
We also agree with the report's proposed three-part
division of parking zones, so that fees increase as one gets
closer to the congested center of campus.
The proposed division does create one problem, since the
Tresidder parking lot, located near the campus center would
be designated as a "free zone." Students and faculty could
conceivably park in this area, thus avoiding any fee. We hope
this problem is ironed out.

We oppose the report's recommendation that parking
fines be increased from $2 to $10 per violation. We think
$10 is too much for a parking ticket. In addition, the fact
that some money collected from parking tickets would go
toward police enforcement creates a disturbing conflict of
interest. We strongly object to any such system that would
provide the police with a "bounty" for giving tickets.
In general, however, the Carpenter report is a good one
which provides reasonable solutions to traffic problems at
Stanford.
