# Pledges Kept
## 
### 
With the closing of the
University at the end of winter
quarter, our terms as members of
the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) drew to a close as well. In
the first days of the spring
quarter, the campus is again being
besieged by campaign material
supporting candidates seeking this
office.
In our campaign last spring, we
made a compact with student
voters, pledging our best efforts to
achieve a specific set of goals and
projects in return for the support
of the electorate. Other Councils
have done so before; others will
do so after we have gone.
We feel we should be held
accountable for our pledges and
so we present the following review
of where we stand in the final
weeks of our terms: •
Lecture Notes—This student
service was established by the
Council of Presidents with
assistance from the financial
manager's office. The project
enables students in participating
classes to purchase inexpensive
and complete outlines of lectures
given in the class. Public response
from both participating students
and faculty has been positive and
the service has grossed a $3800
profit in its first quarter of
operation.
Student Store—This project
would have established a
student-operated discount store
on campus which would have
initially sold records and would
have been subsequently expanded
to include other commodities of
student interest. The COP offered
a plan in the fall for a store, to be
established in conjunction with
the Stanford Bookstore. The
student body voted down the
proposed $1 fee assessment
necessary to finance such an
operation.
Residential Study
Prograr.r- Stanford-in-Stanford
was proposed and developed by
the COP after consultation with
appropriate administration and
faculty members. The program,
which will have a different
academic focus each year, will
encourage closer student-to
faculty interaction and greater
student-to-student collaboration.
The Bulletin—This student
service enables students to have a
greater perception of on-campus
activities each week. The project,
which was funded through the
discretionary fund of the COP
during the fall and winter
quarters, must find other means
of financing if it is to continue.
University Committee
Structure—The COP proposed and
then collaborated with the ASSU
Senate to establish the position of
University Committee Staff
Assistant. This job entails
maintaining files with agenda and
minutes at the ASSU office, filing
weekly reports with the Senate on

committees and facilitating
greater communication between
students, their elected
representatives and their
appointed representatives. The
position has proven to be of great
service to many students, both in
and out of the student,
government.
ASSU Course Review—This
booklet, which has been a
mainstay of student-initiated
academic evaluation for three
years, was again improved and
expanded over those of previous
years. More classes will be
evaluated and material will be
easier to digest than ever before.
The COP and the Course Review
policy board have proposed to the
Faculty Senate and to its
Subcommittee on Teaching
Evaluation that student evaluation
be facilitated through better
timing and wider range of
distribution.
Student Communication-
Through the use of press
conferences and regularly
published newsletters, the COP
has attempted to keep the
students and the University
community as a whole better
informed of in what areas the
Council members have been
working. We feel that much
skepticism directed toward the
ASSU in the past has derived from
a lack of promise fulfillment by
elected representatives and from a
lack of knowledge of what exactly
the ASSU does. We have tried to
remedy both deficiencies.
The COP also proposed plans
for a new bus shuttle service,
scheduled to begin spring quarter;
called and participated in
University meetings on the United
Stanford Employees' strike (in the
spring), advising (in the fall) and
child care (in the winter).
Members also chaired the Legal
Counseling Policy Board; chaired
the Advisory Panel on the Row
Additions, the group which
reviewed plans for new student
housing on the Row; continued
the Women's Coordinating
Committee as a legitimate and
responsive body for increasing
communication and cooperation
between women's groups on
campus; and coordinated student
pressure on the Civil Aeronautics
Board against the elimination of
low-cost charter-group flights.
Now, before we leave office,
we feel that it is important to
place our record before our
electorate, to be judged, for our
successes and for our failures. It is
important to ourselves, to the
student body who elected us, and
to the University community as a
whole.
(Mike Herman is ASSU president.
Ann Carter, Leonard Maekey and
Quinn Mayer are ASSU vice
presidents.)
