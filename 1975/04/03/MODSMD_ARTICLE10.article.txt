# Abortion Legally, Not Morally, Right
## 
### 
As exemplified by the recent cover story
in Newsweek and the Tim Cullinane column
in the Daily of March 4, the manslaughter
conviction of Boston doctor Kenneth Edelin
has raised great interest among proponents
and opponents of abortion alike.
The reason is that the distinction between
a fetus and a person and hence between
abortion and manslaughter is too close for
comfort. We are caused to stop and ask
ourselves, what is a fetus? Given enough time
it will become a person (perhaps it could be
said that we were each a fetus once). But
when does that happen?
It is genetically an individual from the
moment of conception. The heart is beating
wilhin five weeks, and the fetus can be felt to
move by the end of four months. The
Supreme Court has ruled that a fetus begins
to be a person when it becomes viable,
meaning capable of survival independent of
the mother. Some newborns cannot survive
without such life-support mechanisms as an
oxygen tent, and not even the healthiest
infant could survive without being given food
and shelter by its parents.
Double Standard
But if this life support is provided by a
mother's private body, the Supreme Court
has ruled that the fetus is not yet legally a
person and can be aborted upon the decision
of the mother. Those who favor abortion

claim that a woman has a right to kill the
fetus ("terminate the pregnancy" in nicer
language) since she has control over her
private body and her body is needed to keep
it alive.
But hasn't she already knowingly and
voluntarily given up that privacy in an
important way in order for conception to
occur? The only real forced pregnancy is one
resulting from rape. And even the rapist who
forcibly violates a woman's privacy cannot
be eliminated in the way an unwanted fetus
can, because a rapist is a person.
Whatever the women's liberation
movement may accomplish, it cannot
eliminate the natural sexual discrimination
that makes women susceptible to pregnancy
whereas men are not. If an individual is to be
held responsible for his own actions, justice
dictates that this inequality be resolved by
guaranteeing to the fetus the right to survive
and be supported by the father rather than
guaranteeing to the mother the right to
eliminate it.
Moral Questions
Other arguments in favor of abortion also
run headlong into the fundamental moral
question of the rights or humanity of a fetus
which is legally defined to be a little less than
a person. The fact that some children are
unwanted is every bit as good an argument
for infanticide as it is for abortion. The

Phil Dittmer

reason it is invoked to favor the latter and
not the former is the ever-tenuous distinction
between fetus and baoy.
Similarly, the argument that research on
fetuses advances medicine is even stronger if
we wait until after the child is born in order
to experiment, unless the difference between
fetus and child becomes more clear.
Finally, the contention that abortion must
be made legal to spare women the dangers of
illegal abortions dodges the moral question
altogether. It would be analogous to arguing
that burglary should be legalized since
burglars operating in violation of the law run
great risks of being bitten by dogs or shot by
their intended victims.
The Supreme Court has ruled that
abortion is a woman's legal right, but they
have not, nor can they, ruled it to be morally
right. Most of us would feel horror and
outrage if a mother chose to withhold
support from a newborn and allow it to die.
Yet if she exercises her legal right to abort
the fetus six months before birth, isn't the
end result the same and aren't the means
used similar?
If human life in embryo is valued less than
scientific progress or the mother's physical or
emotional convenience, then human life isn't
worth very much at all.

question of the rights or humanity of a fetus
which is legally defined to be a little less than
a person. The fact that some children are
unwanted is every bit as good an argument
for infanticide as it is for abortion. The

Phil Dittmer

reason it is invoked to favor the latter and
not the former is the ever-tenuous distinction
between fetus and baoy.
Similarly, the argument that research on
fetuses advances medicine is even stronger if
we wait until after the child is born in order
to experiment, unless the difference between
fetus and child becomes more clear.
Finally, the contention that abortion must
be made legal to spare women the dangers of
illegal abortions dodges the moral question
altogether. It would be analogous to arguing
that burglary should be legalized since
burglars operating in violation of the law run
great risks of being bitten by dogs or shot by
their intended victims.
The Supreme Court has ruled that
abortion is a woman's legal right, but they
have not, nor can they, ruled it to be morally
right. Most of us would feel horror and
outrage if a mother chose to withhold
support from a newborn and allow it to die.
Yet if she exercises her legal right to abort
the fetus six months before birth, isn't the
end result the same and aren't the means
used similar?
If human life in embryo is valued less than
scientific progress or the mother's physical or
emotional convenience, then human life isn't
worth very much at all.
(Phil Dittmer is a graduate in applied
Dhysics.)
As exemplified by the recent cover story
in Newsweek and the Tim Cullinane column
in the Daily of March 4, the manslaughter
conviction of Boston doctor Kenneth Edelin
has raised great interest among proponents
and opponents of abortion alike.
The reason is that the distinction between
a fetus and a person and hence between
abortion and manslaughter is too close for
comfort. We are caused to stop and ask
ourselves, what is a fetus? Given enough time
it will become a person (perhaps it could be
said that we were each a fetus once). But
when does that happen?
It is genetically an individual from the
moment of conception. The heart is beating
wilhin five weeks, and the fetus can be felt to
move by the end of four months. The
Supreme Court has ruled that a fetus begins
to be a person when it becomes viable,
meaning capable of survival independent of
the mother. Some newborns cannot survive
without such life-support mechanisms as an
oxygen tent, and not even the healthiest
infant could survive without being given food
and shelter by its parents.
Double Standard
But if this life support is provided by a
mother's private body, the Supreme Court
has ruled that the fetus is not yet legally a
person and can be aborted upon the decision
of the mother. Those who favor abortion

claim that a woman has a right to kill the
fetus ("terminate the pregnancy" in nicer
language) since she has control over her
private body and her body is needed to keep
it alive.
But hasn't she already knowingly and
voluntarily given up that privacy in an
important way in order for conception to
occur? The only real forced pregnancy is one
resulting from rape. And even the rapist who
forcibly violates a woman's privacy cannot
be eliminated in the way an unwanted fetus
can, because a rapist is a person.
Whatever the women's liberation
movement may accomplish, it cannot
eliminate the natural sexual discrimination
that makes women susceptible to pregnancy
whereas men are not. If an individual is to be
held responsible for his own actions, justice
dictates that this inequality be resolved by
guaranteeing to the fetus the right to survive
and be supported by the father rather than
guaranteeing to the mother the right to
eliminate it.
Moral Questions
Other arguments in favor of abortion also
run headlong into the fundamental moral
question of the rights or humanity of a fetus
which is legally defined to be a little less than
a person. The fact that some children are
unwanted is every bit as good an argument
for infanticide as it is for abortion. The
