# Censorship Bred Through Fairness'
## 
### Bill Evers 
In an article published in the March 30
New York Times Magazine, former CBS news
president Fred W. Friendly details a
coordinated, secret campaign by the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations to
suppress anticommunist fundamentalist
Christian radio commentators through the
use of the regulatory policy known as the
"fairness doctrine."
The fairness doctrine (which has a certain
amount of ideological self-advertisement built
into its name) is a rule promulgated by the
Federal Communications Commission, the
national regulatory agency controlling
broadcasting.
Under the fairness doctrine, stations that
occupy and use the airwaves are compelled to
present what the government considers to be
the relevant viewpoints on what the
government considers to be important issues.
Secret Monitoring
Beginning in 1963 during the national
debate over the nuclear test ban treaty, the
White House and later also the national
Democratic party secretly used paid
professionals to monitor radio stations that
broadcast ultraconservative commentary.
These persons then engaged in a concerted
effort to demand that unpaid replies to the
ultraconservative commentators be aired. Not
only did the White House successfully
intimidate, in this roundabout way, stations
into running thousands of replies, but the
constant harassment of the stations and the
expenses to them of running the replies led
hundreds of the stations to drop the
ultraconservative commentators.
In part, the White House effort was
designed to discourage stations from
broadcasting commentary friendly to Sen.
Barry M. Goldwater (R-Ariz.), who was the
1964 Republican party presidential nominee.
An important spin-off from this White

House effort at censorship and intimidation
was the so-called "Red Lion" decision, in
which the U.S. Supreme Court approved
what Friendly calls "the power of the
government to intervene directly into the
content of broadcasting."
The Red Lion case (named after the
broadcasting company involved) arose from a
demand by Fred J. Cook to reply to
criticism of him by the Rev. Billy James
Hargis of the Christian Crusade.

Cook, in the words of a March 31
follow-up story in the Times, "was, at the
time, a participant in the White House efforts
to suppress the voices of the right on radio."
Rights Abridged
The Supreme Court decided in the action
initiated by Cook that the government had
the right to intervene directly into radio
programming. Thus, the Supreme Court
ruling denied broadcasters their first
amendment rights of freedom of speech and
of the press.
Friendly pinpoints the political
importance of this new knowledge about
the origins and uses of current fairness
doctrine policy: "The story of the
fairness-doctrine effort during the 1964
campaign . . . illuminates . . . the subtle and
fascinating interplay of power politics and
regulatory policy.

"In the Red Lion case, for example, many
of the agency bureaucrats, Government
lawyers, and judges tended to dismiss the
broadcasters' claim that freedom of
expression might be 'chilled' by court
decisions extending Federal regulatory
control over the content of radio and
television programs â€” little realizing that at
the time, they were granting implicit legal
sanction to an unsavory project of political
censorship by the Democrats."
Media Manipulation
This power to control broadcasting was
the cudgel that Nixon administration
spokesmen were able to wield quite
effectively, prior to the Watergate scandal, in
efforts to intimidate and manipulate the
media.
Unfortunately, Friendly, a long-time
ideological proponent of regulation, can only
see in the Red Lion case an exception in
which men and priorities went wrong.
But, in fact, the lesson of this and other
government regulation scandals like the milk
price-support bribery is clear. Get the
government out.
The broadcasting frequencies should be
absolutely privatized. A model for doing this
is suggested in the June 1969 Stanford Law
Review.
With private ownership of the airwaves,
broadcasting could defend itself against
governmental intrusion as the newspapers
have done.
As things are now, government supervision
is the sword of Damocles constantly
suspended over the head of broadcasters. The
inevitable result is censorship of the sort
practiced by the Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon administrations.
