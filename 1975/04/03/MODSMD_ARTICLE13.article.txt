# Arrogance ll' Editorial: Petty, Misleading
## 
### 
The March 13 Daily editorial,
"Arrogance II," is a self-serving,
often false set of complaints
thinly disguised as an editorial. It
is another classic example of the
Daily failing to get its shit
together before deciding to dump
it on the University community.
The primary complaint of the
editorial concerns the University's
alleged failure to consult in

advance those most directly
affected by an impending
decision. This apparently valid
grievance is the pretense for the
ensuing list of specific gripes.
However, the validity of the
overall complaint can only be
judged in the light of the validity
of the specific supporting
complaints.
The first specific objection is

to the elimination of 600 parking
spaces adjacent to Roble Gym.
They are being removed to make
way for the new T?rman
Engineering Center.
First, the Daily made a minor
threefold error in the number of
spaces: 208 spaces, not 600, will
be eliminated in this area.
Although the Daily concedes
that the Communication
Department parking lot could
accommodate the displaced autos,
they assert that rapid
development in this area of the
campus threatens the latter lot. If
it had bothered to check with the
Planning Office, the Editorial
Board would have found that the
Comm Department lot is officially
designated as permanent parking
and chances of it being eliminated
in the future are remote.
The Daily reveals its true colors
and motives in its second
complaint: the loss of the 35
spaces on Lomita Drive, directly
in front of the Daily offices, is
deemed unbearable for those who
presently use them (and I wonder
who that could be!).
Again, there are 30, not 35,
spaces being eliminated on Lomita
Drive.
Problems Cited
The Daily cites three problems
relative to this: a loss of delivery
access to Storke, a drop in walk-in
advertising sales for the Daily and
an increased safety hazard. As for
delivery access, the Daily again
failed to investigate the facts: the
Planning Office is currently
exploring alternative access routes
for Storke and all other buildings
affected. Adequate access will be
provided.
The latter two "problems" are
gems of irrationality. Lomita
Drive is currently planned for
conversion into Lomita Mall, a
picturesque, grassy, well-lighted

pedestrian walkway. What could
be worse?
In a larger sense, the Daily's
position exemplifies the attitudes
exhibited by many individuals and
groups on campus: they give
lip-service approval to
discouragement of central campus
auto traffic and encouragement of
alternative modes of
transportation, but as soon as
their personal convenience is
threatened in the slightest, the
existing setup becomes sacrosanct.
The transportation priorities of
the University community should

Lance Friedmann

be pedestrians and bicyclists first,
then group transit, and finally
individual motor vehicles.
Stanford has the potential to
develop a virtually car-free
campus core, an ecological and
traffic flow model for others. But
to achieve this, attitudes must
change. People must learn to put
community interests before their
own.

position exemplifies the attitudes
exhibited by many individuals and
groups on campus: they give
lip-service approval to
discouragement of central campus
auto traffic and encouragement of
alternative modes of
transportation, but as soon as
their personal convenience is
threatened in the slightest, the
existing setup becomes sacrosanct.
The transportation priorities of
the University community should

be pedestrians and bicyclists first,
then group transit, and finally
individual motor vehicles.
Stanford has the potential to
develop a virtually car-free
campus core, an ecological and
traffic flow model for others. But
to achieve this, attitudes must
change. People must learn to put
community interests before their
own.

The March 13 Daily editorial,
"Arrogance II," is a self-serving,
often false set of complaints
thinly disguised as an editorial. It
is another classic example of the
Daily failing to get its shit
together before deciding to dump
it on the University community.
The primary complaint of the
editorial concerns the University's
alleged failure to consult in

advance those most directly
affected by an impending
decision. This apparently valid
grievance is the pretense for the
ensuing list of specific gripes.
However, the validity of the
overall complaint can only be
judged in the light of the validity
of the specific supporting
complaints.
The first specific objection is

to the elimination of 600 parking
spaces adjacent to Roble Gym.
They are being removed to make
way for the new T?rman
Engineering Center.
First, the Daily made a minor
threefold error in the number of
spaces: 208 spaces, not 600, will
be eliminated in this area.
Although the Daily concedes
that the Communication
Department parking lot could
accommodate the displaced autos,
they assert that rapid
development in this area of the
campus threatens the latter lot. If
it had bothered to check with the
Planning Office, the Editorial
Board would have found that the
Comm Department lot is officially
designated as permanent parking
and chances of it being eliminated
in the future are remote.
The Daily reveals its true colors
and motives in its second
complaint: the loss of the 35
spaces on Lomita Drive, directly
in front of the Daily offices, is
deemed unbearable for those who
presently use them (and I wonder
who that could be!).
Again, there are 30, not 35,
spaces being eliminated on Lomita
Drive.
Problems Cited
The Daily cites three problems
relative to this: a loss of delivery
access to Storke, a drop in walk-in
advertising sales for the Daily and
an increased safety hazard. As for
delivery access, the Daily again
failed to investigate the facts: the
Planning Office is currently
exploring alternative access routes
for Storke and all other buildings
affected. Adequate access will be
provided.
The latter two "problems" are
gems of irrationality. Lomita
Drive is currently planned for
conversion into Lomita Mall, a
picturesque, grassy, well-lighted

pedestrian walkway. What could
be worse?
In a larger sense, the Daily's
position exemplifies the attitudes
exhibited by many individuals and
groups on campus: they give
lip-service approval to
discouragement of central campus
auto traffic and encouragement of
alternative modes of
transportation, but as soon as
