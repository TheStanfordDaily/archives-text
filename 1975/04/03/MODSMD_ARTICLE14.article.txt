In the article "Asian-American
Course Offered" in the March 13
issue of the Daily, Doug Chan is
reported as having said that the
course in Cantonese offered by
this department is "being phased
out this year."
I don't know what the basis of
his statement is, for though the
future funding for this course is
uncertain, we are still hoping to
continue it.

What has happened to the
splendid Xerox 4000 copying
machine in the Art Library? One
day it was there, enabling 20
students at a paleography lecture
in the history building to study a
page from a facsimile of a
manuscript. The next day it was
gone, and an undergraduate
humanities class was unable to
discuss together the iconography
of a 12th-century cross.
The art library is
non-circulating. One cannot
remove a facsimile, book or
journal for use in teaching
elsewhere on campus, and this is
clearly a sound policy, but
workable only so long as
high-quality copies can be made
of the materials held.
The Savin machine that
replaced the Xerox is inadequate,
when it isn't out of service. True,
the staff can make arrangements
for books to be taken to the main
library for copying, but this
consumes staff time.
Whv was the Xerox 4000
removed? Apparently, after a
three-month trial, it was not used
enongh. Only 6000 copies were
made each month, and 6500 are
needed for the machine to make
money.
I wonder if in the long run the
cost to *;he library in terms of
demands on staff time when the
Savin breaks down and in lost
books and pages removed from
journals will not make the
economy in removing the machine
a dubious one.
Perhaps others who like myself
have missed the Xerox machine will
tell David Weber, the director of
libraries, that the message has
come through clearly. We all
know the command, "Scholars:
produce." We now have heard,
students and scholars alike:
"Reproduce."
