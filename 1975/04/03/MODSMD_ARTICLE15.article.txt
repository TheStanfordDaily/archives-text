## Bug Me

What steps, if any, is the
University taking to eliminate the
annual problem of cockroaches in
the dorms, particularly in Zapata,
Hurbank, and other areas of Stern
Hall? -G I)

Bug Me is designed to help students solve problems
and find answers to questions they can't solve alone.
If your room leaks and no one does anything about it
or if your car is supposedly "fixed" and then has
more problems than before, Bug Me can help you.
But Me can help you get service by putting the force
of a student newspaper with a circualtion of 23,000
behind you. For information and help in getting
things done, call Patty Fels and Bug Me at 497-4632.

Rich Richardson, maintenance
supervisor of University housing,
admits that the cockroach
problem is slowly getting worse in
the dormitories. Unfortunately,
no one seems to know what to do
about it.
The problem lies in the type of
insecticide used. All chemicals on
the Stanford campus have to be
approved by a self-appointed
biocide committee, made up of
doctors and chemists. A.J. Sidlow,
manager of safety and health and
head of the committee, said that
the committee is reluctant to
approve chemicals which are
extremely toxic or long lasting in
the environment. Unfortunately,
the approved milder chemicals
also do not work as well.
Right now the Rose
Exterminator Company, which
handles all University business, is

using a chemical called diazinon.
"It is a fairly strong chemical, but
doesn't last long while other
chemicals, like DDT, do," said
Sidlow. Consequently the
cockroaches return mort

frequently.
Sidlow said that the committee
will probably approve stronger
chemicals if the cockroaches begin
to overrun the dorms. He
promised that the Rose company
would talk to dorm heads at Stern
to determine the extent of the
problem. Richardson said that
Stern would be completely
fumigated over spring break.

In these days of broadly-based,
truly representative search
committees, I'm curious about the
one that selects the ASSU visiting
professors. Who are members of
the committee and how were they
chosen? Why are the candidates
for the professorship invariably
victims of oppression from
"fascist" states or "corrupt"
governments? Has the committee
ever considered selecting a person

who has suffered at the hands of a
socialist or communistic
government? There is an ample
supply of such candidates around.
-R.J.C.
There are five members on the
ASSU Guest Professorship
committee. Three are students
chosen by the ASSU Senate each
spring and the other two are
representatives of SWOPSI and
SCIRE, nominated by their
respective boards and then
approved by the Senate.
This year the three students
chosen by the Senate are Gerald
Koblentz, Michelle Deplanque,
and Kevin O'Grady. Chris Baron is
the SWOPSI representative Ind
Mitchell Cohen has recently
become the SCIRE one, replacing
John Messinger.
O'Grady said that the
committee had not really
considered choosing someone
oppressed by a socialist or
communistic government,
primarily because of the student
resolution urging that Nguyen
Huu Thai be chosen as the guest
professor. "What we sought to do
was to find someone who fit the
mold of Thai," said O'Grady. "We
felt that we had some obligation

put upon us to stay as close as we
could to the spirit of that
resolution."
What was the "spirit" of the
resolution? O'Grady and other
members of the committee felt
that the students wanted a
professor from a country the
United States had oppressed. "I
think that it was felt that Thai's
presence on campus could call
continuing attention to the war in
South Vietnam, and that the
situation there was largely the
responsibility of the American
people. There was a feeling in the
committee that Chile was much
the same situation."
Koblentz agreed: "I would say
that there's a general
consciousness in the group that
feels that especially people that
have suffered because of U.S.
imperialism would be the best to
educate Americans here."
Would the committee consider
a person from a communistic or
socialist country? Kevin O'Grady
said no. "Undoubtedly there are
political prisoners in communist
countries," he said. "But 1 don't
think that Americans have the
same responsibilities in those
countries as countries where we

have created the governments or
propped them up."

After 10 years at Stanford, I am
unable to find any place on
campus where one can get a
package wrapped for mailing.
Since we are at a considerable
remove from any business district,
it becomes a major hassle every
time one wants to mail a package.
Is my information correct?
-R.B.T
Not really. The Stanford
bookstore has a courtesy
wrapping desk with brown paper,
string, tape, scissors, and a
"sometimes workable stapler." If
you don't want to do it yourself,
you can have the package
wrapped for about $1.50
(depending on the size) at the
customer service desk.
All right. Settle this bet or
you'// be sorry. I say Boris Karloff
was the only man ever to play the
PYankenstein monster in the
movies. My roommate says it was
Lon Chaney Jr. and Karloff.
Which one of us has to dive into a
three-foot vat of cream
cheese?—M.H.
Both of you. The number of

people who have played the
Frankenstein monster has grown
by leaps and bounds over the past
20 years or so, as cut-rate studios
like American International turn
out cheapies trying to cash in on
the Frankenstein family name.
But even if your bet was
restricted to the original series of
eight pictures produced by
Universal during the '30s and '40s,
you both lose. Four men donned
the monster's makeup in the
Universal epics.
Boris Karloff was the first —
and many say the best — to play
the role; he did it three times.
Next was Lon Chaney Jr. who
tried it once. Then Bela Lugosi
played it once, and Glenn Strange
did it for the final three movies.
If you're one of those cultural
cretins who doesn't remember
Glenn Strange, don't send in a
question about it. He was Sam the
bartender on Gunsmuke for years
and years.
