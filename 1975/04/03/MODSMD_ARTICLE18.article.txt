Vacation is always too short, isn't it?
And now it's time to get back to that
daily grind. However, if you're like most
Stanford students, you're probably
putting off that reading you should be
doing. Therefore, we advise you to spend
your newly-created "free time"
participating in one of several valuable
activities this week.
On campus, the major attraction is
the Dizzy Gillespie (jazz) Quartet,
appearing Friday in Memorial
Auditorium. Gillespie, whose appearance
is sponsored by the Office of Public
Events, is 54, but "his trumpet playing is
filled with the vigor of youth,"
according to a press release.
A rare cultural event occurs this week
at the Main Library. On Sunday,
Stanford's John Steinbeck Collection,
featuring all kinds of memorabilia, goes
on public display through June 25. To
highlight the opening of the collection,
San Diego State Literature Prof. Jackson
Benson, who is writing the authoritative
biography of Steinbeck, will lecture in
Annenburg auditorium. Mice, men and
everyone else are urged to attend.
For superior comedy, do not miss

impressionist Rich Little and singer
Barbara Eden (we promise this act won't
go up in smoke) at the Circle Star
Theater through Sunday. Little is the one
who does a superior impersonation of
Johnny Carson and also a very fine
Richard Nixon (if you don't remember
him, ask John Wayne).
Let us end with a musical suggestion.
If you can possibly see Glen Yarborough
and the Limeliters on Saturday at the
Marin Memorial Theater, do so.
Yarborough ("Baby, the Rain Must
Fall") seldom gets together with his
early 'feOs folk group, but when he
does, the results are worth experiencing.
Since v/e suggested that you may wish
to forego your studying to attend one of
these events, you may have guilt feelings.
So, finally, let us attend to those. If you
have such feelings, simply turn on
"Creature Feature" on Channel 2 on
Saturday night and watch Majin,
Monster of Terror. We promise that if
professors make it assigned viewing, it
will either scare or bore you into reading
those comparatively very attractive
textbooks.
