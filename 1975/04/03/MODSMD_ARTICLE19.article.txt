U.S. Staff Evacuates Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — The U.S. Embassy will
begin evacuating 15 percent of its 200 American staffers to
Bangkok, Thailand, today following the bloody fall of Neak
Luong, the government's last stronghold on the Mekong
River.
The withdrawal was announced as the Nationalist
Chinese Embassy evacuated its staff, fierce fighting raged
10 miles south of the capital and five miles to the
northeast, and as the U.S. airlift continued despite shelling
that damaged one plane and wounded one American
civilian pilot.
Battambang, the country's second largest city 180 miles
northwest of Phnom Penh, was also under rebel pressure,
with the insurgents reported tightening their stranglehold
around the city.
2000 More Orphans To Be Airlifted
SAN FRANCISCO — Plans are being made to fly 2000
more South Vietnamese children away from the war-torn
country within 48 hours, an aide in U.S. Sen. Tunney's
office said yesterday.
The aide, Mike Moran, said the Operations Center of the
State Department made $2 million available to the Agency
for International Development for the charter flights. He
said AID will work together with Friends For All Children
of Boulder, Colo, to make the arrangements.
Moran sakti he had confirmed the plans with the State
Department and that they had been approved by the South
Vietnamese also.
Energy Use Declines In U.S.
WASHINGTON — Energy use in the United States
declined last year for the first time since 1952, the
government reported yesterday.
Preliminary Bureau of Mines figures show that reduced
use in the transportation industry led the way to a 2.2
percent decline in over-all energy use from 1973.
Consumption of oil products dropped 237 million
barrels — nearly two-thirds of the million barrels a day
savings which President Ford set as a conservation goal.
But only 44 million of those barrels represented a
decrease in petroleum imports, which is the principal target
area for savings.
Outgoing Interior Secretary Rogers Morton attributed
the bulk of the decline to five reasons: the Arab oil
embargo, higher prices, economic slowdown, conservation
efforts and relatively mild winter weather.
Connally Jury Hears Charges
WASHINGTON — The jury in the bribery trial of former
Treasury Secretary John Connally was told yesterday that
Connally accepted $10,000 from milk industry lawyer Jake
Jacobsen "as a thank-you tip" in 1971 for helping get milk
support prices raised.
Connally's lawyer denied the prosecution charge and
said Jacobsen "embezzled the money — that's what the
evidence will show."
Edward Bennett Williams, heading Connally's defense,

said Jacobsen had denied giving Connally a bribe six times
— four of them under oath — then changed his story to get
out from under fraud charges in an unrelated case in Texas.
The charges against Connally — two counts of accepting
an illegal gratuity — carry a possible maximum sentence of
four years and fines of $20,000 upon conviction.
Bartow Succeeds UCLA's Wooden
LOS ANGELES — UCLA's near-perennial basketball
champions reached into the Midwest Wednesday to hire
Illinois' Gene Bartow as successor to the legendary John
Wooden.
Terms of the contract for the 44-year-old graduate of
Northeast Missouri were not made public but it's for several
years because Bartow gave up the final four seasons of his
contract at the University of Illinois to head west.
He succeeds the man who coached the Bruins for 27
seasons and won an unprecedented 10 national
championships in the past 12 years.
UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan said he sought a
young coach who would continue the traditions of the
school.
Bartow came to prominence at Memphis State during
the 1972-73 season, when his club reached the NCAA
tournament championship round. They then lost to
Wooden and UCLA, 87-56, as the Bruins captured their
seventh straight NCAA championship.
