# Appeal To Lyman Possible
## Miller Upholds Irish Decision 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Provost William Miller yesterday
upheld the Advancement and
Placement (A&P) Committee's
decision to deny tenure to Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish.
Irish, the 1972 winner of the Gores
Award for excellence in teaching, can
still appeal the case to President
Richard Lyman, but said last night he
has not yet decided whether or not to
do so.
"I'm not surprised by the late result
of my appeal to Miller," Irish told the
Daily. "I had no great expectations of

seeing the A&P Committee's decision
overruled."
Irish complained that the appeal
procedure provided only for Miller's
consultation with A&P Committee
members to determine the
reasonableness of the decision. Irish
contended that student and faculty
opinion should have been given more
consideration.
Unlikely
"It seemed very unlikely that an
appeal that asks the people who made
the original decision to assess the
decision's reasonableness would
succeed," Irish said. "It wasn't likely
that the A&P Committee would have
discovered in the interim that it had
acted unreasonably.
"It is frustrating to appeal to the
very people who made the original
decision."
Miller refused to comment on
Irish's case, noting that if Irish
appealed the case to Lyman, his
remarks might prejudice the decision.
But Miller told the Daily that his
office has often overruled the A&P

Committee in tenure decisions
although the majority of the
committee's decisions are upheld.
Insufficient Scholarship
Miller, however, claimed he could
recall no instance during his four years
as provost in which Lyman has
overturned one of his decisions on a
tenure appeal.
According to Irish, Miller's letter of
explanation claimed that his
scholarship was not of sufficient
quality to merit tenure.
"No specific evidence was given to
support the claim that my scholarship
was inferior. Generalizations were
offered and they were just the
opposite of the generalizations given
by the Religious Studies Department
to support me for tenure."
But Irish said he cannot be certain
whether or not Miller was
unreasonably vague until he studies his
letter more carefully.
Superior Teaching
Irish noted that Miller
acknowledged that his teaching was
"truly superior." He added that "I still
argue that insufficient weight is given
by the University to teaching."
All religious studies professors
contacted by the Daily expressed
dismay at Miller's decision.
Robert McAffee Brown said he was
"deeply disappointed" with the
decision, not only for Irish's sake, but
also for the sake of the University.
'Open Discussion Needed'
Brown said he fears that the
decision is evidence that the University
"doesn't feel that it needs people like
Jerry around to build the future of the
University."
Asst. Prof. Nancy Lethcoe said she is
afraid that the Irish case "has brought
out the University tenure process does
not consider whether the professor has
treated the student as an individual."
Lethcoe added that the Irish
decision indicates that the University
"needs to open a discussion of what
constitutes good teaching."
Prof. Edwin Good agreed with
Brown and Lethcoe that Irish deserved
tenure.
Good claimed that both Irish's
teaching and his publication qualified
him for tenure.

upheld the Advancement and
Placement (A&P) Committee's
decision to deny tenure to Religious
Studies Prof. Jerry Irish.
Irish, the 1972 winner of the Gores
Award for excellence in teaching, can
still appeal the case to President
Richard Lyman, but said last night he
has not yet decided whether or not to
do so.
"I'm not surprised by the late result
of my appeal to Miller," Irish told the
Daily. "I had no great expectations of

seeing the A&P Committee's decision
overruled."
Irish complained that the appeal
procedure provided only for Miller's
consultation with A&P Committee
members to determine the
reasonableness of the decision. Irish
contended that student and faculty
opinion should have been given more
consideration.
Unlikely
"It seemed very unlikely that an
appeal that asks the people who made
the original decision to assess the
decision's reasonableness would
succeed," Irish said. "It wasn't likely
that the A&P Committee would have
discovered in the interim that it had
acted unreasonably.
"It is frustrating to appeal to the
very people who made the original
decision."
Miller refused to comment on
Irish's case, noting that if Irish
appealed the case to Lyman, his
remarks might prejudice the decision.
But Miller told the Daily that his
office has often overruled the A&P

Committee in tenure decisions
although the majority of the
committee's decisions are upheld.
Insufficient Scholarship
Miller, however, claimed he could
recall no instance during his four years
as provost in which Lyman has
overturned one of his decisions on a
tenure appeal.
According to Irish, Miller's letter of
explanation claimed that his
scholarship was not of sufficient
quality to merit tenure.
"No specific evidence was given to
support the claim that my scholarship
was inferior. Generalizations were
offered and they were just the
opposite of the generalizations given
by the Religious Studies Department
to support me for tenure."
But Irish said he cannot be certain
whether or not Miller was
unreasonably vague until he studies his
letter more carefully.
Superior Teaching
Irish noted that Miller
acknowledged that his teaching was
"truly superior." He added that "I still
argue that insufficient weight is given
by the University to teaching."
All religious studies professors
contacted by the Daily expressed
dismay at Miller's decision.
Robert McAffee Brown said he was
"deeply disappointed" with the
decision, not only for Irish's sake, but
also for the sake of the University.
'Open Discussion Needed'
Brown said he fears that the
decision is evidence that the University
"doesn't feel that it needs people like
Jerry around to build the future of the
University."
Asst. Prof. Nancy Lethcoe said she is
afraid that the Irish case "has brought
out the University tenure process does
not consider whether the professor has
treated the student as an individual."
Lethcoe added that the Irish
decision indicates that the University
"needs to open a discussion of what
constitutes good teaching."
Prof. Edwin Good agreed with
Brown and Lethcoe that Irish deserved
tenure.
Good claimed that both Irish's
teaching and his publication qualified
him for tenure.
