# Olivieri Investments Questioned
## Financial Manager Defends Right To Buy Higher-Risk Bonds 
### GLENN KRAMON 
A University official says that
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri may have made investments
too risky to meet the terms of an
"Approved List" provided by the
University for investment of ASSU
money.
In two memos dated Aug. 20, 1974
and Jan. 9, 1975, University Director
of Finance Rodney Adams stipulates
that the ASSU may make only
low-risk investments of a nature to be
specified by the University.
Specifically, the Approved List
allows investment in only the most
secure bonds — bonds classified as
AAA and AA by the Standard &
Poor's or Moody's bond guides.
But some $37,000 of the $251,000
Olivieri has put into corporate bonds is
invested in the more risky A bonds.
'Underwriting' Funds
Olivieri claims the Approved List
applies to only the $114,000
"underwriting" comprised of money
left over from previous ASSU projects.
That money was transferred last
summer from a University investment
fund to Olivieri, the first financial
manager in years to invest all the
ASSU reserves himself rather than
turn it over to the University for
investment.
The remaining $137,000 comes
from operating profits of ASSU
projects such as Special Events, the
Travel Service and the Sunday Flicks.
Just over $88,000 of those profits was
made before last Aug. 31.
Olivieri believes the University may
not interfere, except in an advisory
capacity, with the ASSU's investment
of this $137,000.
"This isn't the University's money,
it's the Association's money. I'm
charged with the responsibility, of

investing the Association's money with
advice from Rod Adams, business
school profs and others."
'Under University Umbrella'
Adams, while calling Olivieri
"tremendously competent," says the
financial manager has "redefined the
money he's managing" by "coining the
term 'underwriting' " and
distinguishing between control over
money in this underwriting and that in
other types of ASSU funds.
"To the extent that the ASSU is an
organization that comes under the
umbrella of the University and receives
the benefits of being a University
organization [e.g. tax benefits!," all
ASSU funds come under the
University's control, Adams asserts.
He believes that two of Olivieri's

three A-bond investments are safe. But
Adams says he fears the danger of a
loss in value or default of payments on
the bonds from the third company
"makes such investments too risky."
He will not reveal which of the
three A-bond investments — American
Express, Avco Finance or MGIC
Investment — he found overly risky.
And he cautions against future
investment in A bonds without a
careful study of the companies.
'Great Reservations'
"1 wouldn't call this the most
healthy economic climate in this
country's history," Adams notes. "I
don't think we've heard the last of
bankruptcies and defaults. I have great
reservations about investment in a
bond that might create an illiquid

situation" — an inability to redeem
them for cash when it's needed.
Investment of ASSU funds in
corporate bonds has been handled
exclusively by Olivieri. Since January,
the second-year business student has
invested all $251,000 of the ASSU's
reserves in a diverse selection of bonds
paying between 7.6 and 12.5 percent
interest to maturity.
The badly needed interest could
help pay future ASSU bills,
particularly if the University begins to
cut back on its annual allocation to
the student organization.
"The whole purpose is to get a high
cash inflow," says Olivieri. "We [the
ASSU] get $90,000 from the
University to run our banking
operation. But that amount will be cut
- it's a foregone conclusion."
To that end, Olivieri has also
invested some $150,000 from the
ASSU checking and savings account in
Bankers Acceptance notes presently
paying 6.25 percent interest.
Though Olivieri makes the
investment decisions himself, he
reports his purchases to the ASSU
Senate and to University officials
including Adams and Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Dale Snape.
But because the ASSU's investment
is handled by a one-man show whose

term will end on June 1, Adams fears
that future ASSU financial managers
may not manage investments as
prudently as Olivieri.
Adams notes that four years ago, a
financial manager did not reinvest the
funds from matured bonds purchased
by the previous financial manager, and
thus "the money sat idle for about six
months when it could have been
earning interest."
Indeed, bonds with a total face
value of $50,000 are scheduled to
mature on June 1, the day Olivieri's
term ends, and another $25,000 worth
of bonds will mature July 1.
