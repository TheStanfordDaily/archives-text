# Vietnamese Senate Blasts Thieu; Orphans Being Airlifted To U.S.

### 
SAIGON (AP) - The South
Vietnamese Senate in Saigon yesterday
assailed President Nguyen Van Thieu's
regime and called unanimously for a
new leadership to end the war. The
declaration came with three-quarters
of the country swept up by the
Communist-led offensive and
orphaned babies being airlifted from
possible turmoil in Saigon.
In Washington Vice President
Nelson Rockefeller said he thinks "it's
really too late" to do anything to stem
the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
advance.
Asked about the hordes of refugees,
he said, "They're trapped. They
couldn't get out... I guess a lot of
them are going to die .. . For us, we
go on living."
Dash To Freedom
Among the living are 55 orphaned
Vietnamese children who made a dash
for freedom on an airplane from
threatened Saigon without official
clearance yesterday.
Because the Tan Son Nhut air base
here was on full alert, it was almost
totally dark when the orphans boarded
the World Airways DC-8 jet for the
8000-mile flight.
More than 100 volunteers,
including nurses and doctors, were
awaiting in Oakland the arrival of the
jet late last night. The children were
being flown to the U.S. through the
work of Friends of Vietnamese
Children, a licensed adoption agency
in Colorado that has been trying to
find American homes for children in
Vietnamese orphanages.
Five Enclaves Fall
Five more enclaves in the central
part of the country fell without a fight
yesterday, including Tuy Hoa, Phan
Rang, Phan Thiet, Dalat and Cam
Ranh, the big $250 million U.S.-built
base. Anarchy and panic gripped the
cities, and relief sources said the
appearance of North Vietnamese
forces at the fallen coastal city of Nha
Trang halted the U.S. sealift of 60,000
refugees there.
The fall of Dalat and Tuy Hoa gave

the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
control of two more provinces, Phu
Yen and Tuyen Due. About half of
South Vietnam's 20 million
population now are in the 17 of the
country's 44 provinces conceded to
the Communists or in areas contested
by both Saigon and the Communist
command.
Political Characteristics
Accusing Thieu of "an abuse of
power, corruption and social
injustice," the previously
pro-government Senate said Thieu was
"counting exclusively on a military
solution ... in solving a war with
many political characteristics."
The Senate, which has no real
power, also charged the United States
with failing to respect its
commitments to South Vietnam.

Saigon's ambassador in Washington
leveled a similar charge in a television
interview, saying the world probably
would conclude it was safer to be an
ally of the Communists than the
Americans.
Indochinese Developments
In other Indochina developments:
— The Viet Cong said life has
returned to normal in several locations
under their control, including the old
imperial capital of Hue and the central
provincial capital of Quang Ngai, and
that nearly 100 government workers
and officers have joined their side.
— Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger was reported asking other
countries to urge Hanoi to live up to
the 1973 cease-fire he helped
negotiate.
