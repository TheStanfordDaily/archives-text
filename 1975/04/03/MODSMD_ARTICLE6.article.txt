# Police Clear Suspect In Taylor Murder
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
A San Mateo County sheriff's
official said yesterday there are still no
suspects in the March 1974 slaying
here of Janet Taylor, despite a recent
flurry of activity in the investigation.
Lt. Rudy Siemssen said "there's no
way" a former Mill Valley man who
reportedly had newspaper clippings
and photos of Taylor, is a suspect in
the case.
The man, reportedly now in
Colorado, left the material among
other personal belongings when he
moved out of a "commune-type" Mill
Valley home.
Siemssen said he knows where the
man is and will eventually contact
him, but stressed that he isn't a
suspect. "At this point, I'm kind of
feeling sorry for the guy," he said.
According to Siemssen, the man
was apparently a high school classmate
of both Taylor — daughter of former

Stanford Athletic Director Charles
Taylor — and Barbara Rocky, a Menlo
Park woman who was raped and shot
to death last year near Salt Lake City.
Siemssen said the material
uncovered in Mill Valley was
apparently sent to the man by his
parents. The police have not identified
the man, although the Palo Alto Times
described him as being in his mid-20s
and a former Palo Alto resident.
News of the possible development
in the Taylor investigation had also led
to renewed interest in the February
1973 murder of Leslie Perlov, a
county law librarian, whose body was
found in the foothills behind campus
less than three miles from the site
where Taylor was discovered.
Police have previously theorized
that the killings may be related. Both
women were strangled to death,
although neither had been sexually
molested.
