# Shuttle Bus Service Starts Here Monday
## 
### RIV WEBER 
J In an effort to increase the safety
• of students traveling on campus at
J night, a free shuttle bus service has
• been organized by a joint student and
• administration effort. It will begin a
• trial run on Monday.
• The bus will run from 8 p.m. until '
J 12:30 a.m. seven nights a week. The
• route will follow a 45-minute "loop"
J around the campus, designed to
• include major residential and academic
• units such as Meyer Library, >
J Escondido Village, the Physics Tank 1
• and the Computer Center (see page 3 i
J for complete schedule). I
• The service is available to those '
• traveling on foot, and those wishing a 1
• shuttle to their parked cars. Each bus
• stop is located by a fire call box and
J the bus will be preceded a few minutes (
• by policc. I
• Gloria Guth, head of the
•Committee of Graduate Women for |
• Safety at Stanford which originated ]
J the shuttle idea, noted that, in
• emergencies, "fire boxes are better
! than phones. They are direct links to
• the police and fire departments. The
• fire trucks can arrive in three I
• minutes." 1
'Honk And Wait' 1
J Dave Clark, a junior, will be the
• major bus driver for the service. He

said he will "honk the horn and wait a
few seconds" at the Physics Tank and
Computer Center to allow riders to
wait inside.
The Alpha Phi Omega service
fraternity has volunteered to provide
drivers for Monday and Tuesday
nights. President Mike Windes
explained that the fraternity would
like to serve the University directly.
Dale Snape and Leah Kaplan,
assistant deans of student affairs, have
represented the administration in the
implementation of the shuttle
program. Snape said the trial period
will run April 7-27. "If the response is
overwhelming, then we'll see if we can
find the money for it, "he added.
Guth is critical of the three-week
trial period. She said she would prefer
the bus to run an entire quarter before
any decision is made. She also
questioned the phrase " 'overwhelming
response.' If one person uses the
service we consider it a success."
Attitude Discrepancy
Snape said he foresees a greater
possibility of continuing the service by
charging a 25-cent fare per rider. Guth
countered by calling such a fee "a
hassle. A fee assessment should be
granted, instead."

LOVE TRUCK? — Would you get into the back seat with this man? Actually, Dale Snape is a respectable assistant
dean of student affairs getting out of the University's new shuttle bus which will provide transportation to students
on campus. Gloria Guth, head of the Committee of Graduate Women on Safety at Stanford, took a test ride with
Snape recently. The bus will go into operation Monday.

said he will "honk the horn and wait a

explained that the fraternity would
like to serve the University directly.
Dale Snape and Leah Kaplan,
assistant deans of student affairs, have
represented the administration in the
implementation of the shuttle
program. Snape said the trial period
will run April 7-27. "If the response is
overwhelming, then we'll see if we can
find the money for it, "he added.
Guth is critical of the three-week
trial period. She said she would prefer
the bus to run an entire quarter before
any decision is made. She also
questioned the phrase " 'overwhelming
response.' If one person uses the
service we consider it a success."
Attitude Discrepancy
Snape said he foresees a greater
possibility of continuing the service by
charging a 25-cent fare per rider. Guth
countered by calling such a fee "a
hassle. A fee assessment should be
granted, instead."
