## End Viet Support 
### 
President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger have recently argued that the United States has a
moral commitment to aid the Thieu government in South
Vietnam because the United States made certain agreements
with Thieu at the time of the Paris peace accords.
According to the Administration's argument, if Congress
does not vote funds to support Thieu, governments all across
the world will no longer believe that the United States will
honor its commitments, and American prestige will suffer
drastically.
Our representative, Paul McCloskey, has apparently
swallowed this argument whole and says that the United
States must honor its commitment to Thieu, wrong as it
may be. We're sorry McCloskey has taken this naive stand.
First, United States prestige would actually suffer less if
the United States terminated any secret agreements with
Thieu, and got out of this war entirely.
Even more importantly, the Constitution delegates the
power to appropriate funds specifically to Congress. The
administration should not promise any money to foreign
governments without Congressional consent. Thus, if
Kissinger actually did promise support to the Thieu regime,
he overstepped the bounds of his authority. There is no
necessity for Congress to go along with a presumtuous
Kissinger, on the dubious premise that failure to do so
would destroy trust in the United States government.
Our position, as we have often stated, is that the United
States should terminate all aid to the Thieu government. We
believe that the interests of peace would be better served if
the United States, by withdrawing support, helped force
Thieu to resign.
The recent insurgent gains in South Vietnam have shown
that, unless Thieu is ousted soon, the fall of South Vietnam
is as inevitable as the collapse of Cambodia. In that country,
Lon Nol, by not resigning, impeded negotiations to the
point where a peaceful settlement became impossible.
While we are pleased that Nol has finally left the country,
his flight in a time of crisis demonstrates what an unworthy
and self-serving leader he has been, and reinforces our
position that the United States never should have supported
him.
