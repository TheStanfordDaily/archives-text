# Hassled By USE

### 
I am writing this to protest an
injustice to myself and to inform
my fellow employees here of how
I was treated by our "democratic"
United Stanford Employee (USE)
Union President Jim Berk.
On Monday, March 10, at
12:30 p.m., I went to the USE
office to seek an explanation of a
memorandum I had received from
that office. The memorandum
stated that I still owed 17 cents in
union dues for the preceding two
months.
• This confused me, as I had
been paying exactly one percent
of my monthly earning as per our
present union agreement.
Presently, our total monthly
earnings vary depending upon the
length of the month; previously,
we earned a base salary every
month.
In January, I earned $1242, so
I paid $12.42 in dues. In
February, I earned $1080, so I
paid $10.80 in dues.
The total I paid in dues for
these months was $23.22. The
union's memorandum stated that
I should pay a flat $11.70 per
month (contrary to the
agreement) and that I therefore
still owed 17 cents. This did not
seem correct to me, so I decided
to go to the union office to seek
clarification of what I considered
a misunderstanding. I was
accompanied by my co-worker
L.A. Breckenridge.
Upon our arrival at the office,
the secretary, Glenda Jones, told
me that she had written the memo
and that I was required to pay one
percent of my base pay —$11.70
per month. I disagreed, pointing
out that I had been paying one

M ario De Sousa

percent of my actual earnings.
At this point in what had been
a normal, businesslike discussion,
Berk came out of his office and
interrupted to tell me that I had
only three choices in this matter:
—to pay the $11.70 per month;
—to have the one percent
deducted from my check; or
—to refuse to pay the amount
and be considered delinquent.
I again tried to point out that
this violated union agreements,
but he again told me that I had
only three choices.
I concluded from this that
Berk was running the union not
for the members, but for himself
and his friends.
Berk then became very angry
and began to shout "Out! Out!"
as he opened the door.
In view of the way I was being
treated, I asked, what's the
difference between the criticisms
he had written about former
union leader Rudy Tham and the
way Berk was running the union.
Berk began to shout,
challenging me to fight and
demanding that I meet him in the
park. Though tempted, I
controlled my anger and walked
away.
Based upon Berk's actions, it is
my opinion that we have a leader
who considers himself above the
rules and agreements of the union.
Like a dictator, he will not
tolerate verbal disagreement.
Instead of intelligently refuting
the facts, he must rant and rave,
using foul language and
challenging persons to fight — just
like an angry schoolboy.

In view of the way I was being
treated, I asked, what's the
difference between the criticisms
he had written about former
union leader Rudy Tham and the
way Berk was running the union.
Berk began to shout,
challenging me to fight and
demanding that I meet him in the
park. Though tempted, I
controlled my anger and walked
away.
Based upon Berk's actions, it is
my opinion that we have a leader
who considers himself above the
rules and agreements of the union.
Like a dictator, he will not
tolerate verbal disagreement.
Instead of intelligently refuting
the facts, he must rant and rave,
using foul language and
challenging persons to fight — just
like an angry schoolboy.

I am writing this to protest an
injustice to myself and to inform
my fellow employees here of how
I was treated by our "democratic"
United Stanford Employee (USE)
Union President Jim Berk.
On Monday, March 10, at
12:30 p.m., I went to the USE
office to seek an explanation of a
memorandum I had received from
that office. The memorandum
stated that I still owed 17 cents in
union dues for the preceding two
months.
• This confused me, as I had
been paying exactly one percent
of my monthly earning as per our
present union agreement.
Presently, our total monthly
earnings vary depending upon the
length of the month; previously,
we earned a base salary every
month.
In January, I earned $1242, so
I paid $12.42 in dues. In
February, I earned $1080, so I
paid $10.80 in dues.
The total I paid in dues for
these months was $23.22. The
union's memorandum stated that
I should pay a flat $11.70 per
month (contrary to the
agreement) and that I therefore
still owed 17 cents. This did not
seem correct to me, so I decided
to go to the union office to seek
clarification of what I considered
a misunderstanding. I was
accompanied by my co-worker
L.A. Breckenridge.
Upon our arrival at the office,
the secretary, Glenda Jones, told
me that she had written the memo
and that I was required to pay one
percent of my base pay —$11.70
per month. I disagreed, pointing
out that I had been paying one

percent of my actual earnings.
At this point in what had been
a normal, businesslike discussion,
Berk came out of his office and
interrupted to tell me that I had
only three choices in this matter:
—to pay the $11.70 per month;
—to have the one percent
deducted from my check; or
—to refuse to pay the amount
and be considered delinquent.
I again tried to point out that
this violated union agreements,
but he again told me that I had
only three choices.
I concluded from this that
Berk was running the union not
for the members, but for himself
and his friends.
Berk then became very angry
and began to shout "Out! Out!"
as he opened the door.
