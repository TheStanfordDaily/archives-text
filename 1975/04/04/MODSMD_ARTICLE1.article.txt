# Room,Board Set To Rise 12 Percent
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
University room and board rates
will be increased by 12 percent for the
1975-76 academic year if the Board of
Trustees accept a recommendation
from Director of Housing and Food
Services E.A. Scoles.
The increase to $1720 for a
dormitory room and full board plan
will be coupled with an already
announced 12.9 percmt tuition
increase to $3810.
Scoles' recommendations, discussed
this week with the Committee on
Services to Students (COSS) housing
subcommittee, also propose a 12
percent increase in cooperative house
room rates, to $635 per year, and a 12
percent raise in the cluster fraternity
rate. Escondido Village apartment
rates would increase 8.1 percent
overall, while rates for Manzanita Park
mobile homes would remain
unchanged.
The recommendation lists three
principal causes for the proposed
increases: inflation, a shift in
residential staff funding from the
General Funds budget to that of the
housing system and additional debt
payments incurred by the addition of
95 units to Florence Moore Hall.
"Among the more prominent
inflation factors assumed in costs for
next year," stated Scoles, "are utilities
at 29 percent, food at 15 percent, and
salaries and benefits at nine percent."
Utilities Volatile
Utility costs, which currently
amount to over $500,000, are the
most volatile expense items. Although
the current PG&E rate increase and
another projected hike for 1976
already have been factored into the
figures used to arrive at cost estimates,
these figures do not assume enactment
of President Ford's energy
conservation program.
If enacted, this plan could add
more than 10 percent to the projected
utility costs.
The shift of $350,000 in residential
education expenses to the housing
budget will fund half the cost of
resident assistants and the full cost of
resident fellows. This expense was
previously met with the General Funds
monies.
Last year's General Funds budget
finished about $1.5 million in the red,
stated Scoles. Under the present
system, "another $1 million loss was
forecast for next year," he added.
Valuable Part
Residence staffs are a valuable part
of student living groups, Scoles said.
"I think that it has been discovered
/n. _ x i. _ 1 1,
over the years that they | services of
resident fellows and student staff] are
a very definite attraction," he stated.
"The feeling is that a resident is much
better off to have such a component."
The third component of the
recommended increase is interim
financing for the $1,330,000 Flo Mo
construction project. At nine percent
interest, a new debt cost of $120,000
will be created for 1975-76.
Scoles noted that even with his
recommended increases, the room and
board rate would range from $70 to
$345 less than many Ivy League and
other major private Eastern
universities.
More Equitable
The zero increase in trailer room
rates, is designed to make them more
equitable with the rates charged for
dormitories, according to housing
official Alan Cummings.
"The total cost of room and board
in the trailers usually turns out to be
higher than the regular room and
board paid for staying in the dorms,"
he stated.

Utilities Volatile
Utility costs, which currently
amount to over $500,000, are the
most volatile expense items. Although
the current PG&E rate increase and
another projected hike for 1976
already have been factored into the
figures used to arrive at cost estimates,
these figures do not assume enactment
of President Ford's energy
conservation program.
If enacted, this plan could add
more than 10 percent to the projected
utility costs.
The shift of $350,000 in residential
education expenses to the housing
budget will fund half the cost of
resident assistants and the full cost of
resident fellows. This expense was
previously met with the General Funds
monies.
Last year's General Funds budget
finished about $1.5 million in the red,
stated Scoles. Under the present
system, "another $1 million loss was
forecast for next year," he added.
Valuable Part
Residence staffs are a valuable part
of student living groups, Scoles said.
"I think that it has been discovered
/n. _ x i. _ 1 1,
over the years that they | services of
resident fellows and student staff] are
a very definite attraction," he stated.
"The feeling is that a resident is much
better off to have such a component."
The third component of the
recommended increase is interim
financing for the $1,330,000 Flo Mo
construction project. At nine percent
interest, a new debt cost of $120,000
will be created for 1975-76.
Scoles noted that even with his
recommended increases, the room and
board rate would range from $70 to
$345 less than many Ivy League and
other major private Eastern
universities.
More Equitable
The zero increase in trailer room
rates, is designed to make them more
equitable with the rates charged for
dormitories, according to housing
official Alan Cummings.
"The total cost of room and board
in the trailers usually turns out to be
higher than the regular room and
board paid for staying in the dorms,"
he stated.
University room and board rates
will be increased by 12 percent for the
1975-76 academic year if the Board of
Trustees accept a recommendation
from Director of Housing and Food
Services E.A. Scoles.
The increase to $1720 for a
dormitory room and full board plan
will be coupled with an already
announced 12.9 percmt tuition
increase to $3810.
Scoles' recommendations, discussed
this week with the Committee on
Services to Students (COSS) housing
subcommittee, also propose a 12
percent increase in cooperative house
room rates, to $635 per year, and a 12
percent raise in the cluster fraternity
rate. Escondido Village apartment
rates would increase 8.1 percent
overall, while rates for Manzanita Park
mobile homes would remain
unchanged.
The recommendation lists three
principal causes for the proposed
increases: inflation, a shift in
residential staff funding from the
General Funds budget to that of the
housing system and additional debt
payments incurred by the addition of
95 units to Florence Moore Hall.
"Among the more prominent
inflation factors assumed in costs for
next year," stated Scoles, "are utilities
at 29 percent, food at 15 percent, and
salaries and benefits at nine percent."
