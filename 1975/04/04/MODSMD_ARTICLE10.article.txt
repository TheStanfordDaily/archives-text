# Charter Flights Face Bleak Future
## 
### 
The ASSU-sponsored campaign
to preserve affinity group charters
may have won a reprieve from the
Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).
But don't bet on it. A brief look
at the status of the American
airlines industry indicates that
charters are probably on the way
out.
The focus of the industry's
problems, of course, has been on
Pan American, the international
giant. Pan Am has been caught in
a three-way squeeze from
declining revenues due to the
recession, increased costs of
energy and poor management. It
lost $75 million in 1974 and $165
million in the five years before
that. Last October,36 U.S. banks
formed a consortium to provide
Pan Am with a $125 million
credit.
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi,
better known as the Shah of Iran,
now has loaned $250 million to
Pan Am, and in consideration
thereof he is purchasing 13 to 15
percent of Pan Am's stock plus a
controlling interest in Pan Am's
International Hotels.
If any part of this rescue
operation should fail, this fall the
U.S. government could find itself
saddled with a $10
million-per-month subsidy in

order to avert a Pan Am
bankruptcy, making Pan Am, in
the words of Sen. William
Proxmire (D-Wis.), "the nation's
largest welfare recipient."
Against this financial
background, it becomes clear why
the industry's leader wants the
CAB to eliminate charters. Pan
Am executives want to increase
their "load factor" — the
percentage of available seats
occupied. One easy way to do this
is to axe charter services,
regardless of how many
Americans prefer this form of
travel.
Charter elimination is just one
part of the proposed
"rationalization" of the industry
that the airlines are pushing on
the CAB. Also on the agenda is
route reorganization (read
"reduction") merger proposals,
government assistance in
reduction of foreign competition,
and, of course, subsidies.
These "rationalization"
proposals are made, it is asserted,
to increase competitiveness and
dexibility. In fact, the measures
which the CAB is in the process of
improving are designed only to
bolster Pan Am's market share
vis a vis the other international
carriers. The price competition

that exists because of charters —
the sort of competition that
benefits consumers — is now on
the critical list.
Recent history shows that the
Las Vegas line has to go with the
big airlines in this battle. Many
"rationalization" steps have
already been undertaken. In
October, the Department of
Transportation outlined a
seven-point program.
It was a program specifically
expressed in terms of the benefits
that would accrue to Pan Am —
$149 million in the October 1974
to December 1975 period, and
$156 million after that.
Which brings us back to
charters. Charters are the most
efficient type of passenger air
transport and we would therefore
expect that any increased
competition or "rationalization"
would show a swing towards that
type of service, right? But if
"rationalization" really means fat
subsidies, cutting out foreign
competition and a government
rear-guard protection from
charters, then why worry?

Fortunately, Congress seems to
be aware of pitfalls on the path
Pan Am is trying to lead us down.
Once locked into subsidization
and protectionism, the

Don Brunstein

government will be hard-pressed
to extricate itself from a Pan
Am quagmire.
The only real rationalization of
the airlines can come through
greater price flexibility and the
reduction of subsidization. Faced
with the very real problem of
petroleum and maintainance cost
increases, the airlines should be
allowed to reduce their route
Commitments and to expand the
use of charter-like services.
Sadly, the CAB disagrees.
Therefore, I would suggest that
the ASSU and others concerned
concentrate their lobbying efforts
on the Congress. The implications
here are far-reaching; for example,
the entire existence of Stanford's
Overseas program is threatened by
the cancellation of affinity group
charters.
Some may dislike the idea of
Pan Am's globelike insignia as the
province of Iran Air.
But if Pan Am gets its way
with the U.S. government, then I
say let the Shah sink his claws
into the rotting flesh of the "big
blue meatball" (to use a vivid
metaphor). I am sure it will give
him nothing but indigestion.

Some may dislike the idea of
Pan Am's globelike insignia as the
province of Iran Air.
But if Pan Am gets its way
with the U.S. government, then I
say let the Shah sink his claws
into the rotting flesh of the "big
blue meatball" (to use a vivid
metaphor). I am sure it will give
him nothing but indigestion.
(Don Brunstcin is a junior
majoring in economics.)
The ASSU-sponsored campaign
to preserve affinity group charters
may have won a reprieve from the
Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB).
But don't bet on it. A brief look
at the status of the American
airlines industry indicates that
charters are probably on the way
out.
The focus of the industry's
problems, of course, has been on
Pan American, the international
giant. Pan Am has been caught in
a three-way squeeze from
declining revenues due to the
recession, increased costs of
energy and poor management. It
lost $75 million in 1974 and $165
million in the five years before
that. Last October,36 U.S. banks
formed a consortium to provide
Pan Am with a $125 million
credit.
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi,
better known as the Shah of Iran,
now has loaned $250 million to
Pan Am, and in consideration
thereof he is purchasing 13 to 15
percent of Pan Am's stock plus a
controlling interest in Pan Am's
International Hotels.
If any part of this rescue
operation should fail, this fall the
U.S. government could find itself
saddled with a $10
million-per-month subsidy in

order to avert a Pan Am
bankruptcy, making Pan Am, in
the words of Sen. William
Proxmire (D-Wis.), "the nation's
largest welfare recipient."
Against this financial
background, it becomes clear why
the industry's leader wants the
CAB to eliminate charters. Pan
Am executives want to increase
their "load factor" — the
percentage of available seats
occupied. One easy way to do this
is to axe charter services,
regardless of how many
Americans prefer this form of
travel.
Charter elimination is just one
part of the proposed
"rationalization" of the industry
that the airlines are pushing on
the CAB. Also on the agenda is
route reorganization (read
"reduction") merger proposals,
government assistance in
reduction of foreign competition,
and, of course, subsidies.
These "rationalization"
proposals are made, it is asserted,
to increase competitiveness and
dexibility. In fact, the measures
which the CAB is in the process of
improving are designed only to
bolster Pan Am's market share
vis a vis the other international
carriers. The price competition

that exists because of charters —
the sort of competition that
benefits consumers — is now on
the critical list.
Recent history shows that the
Las Vegas line has to go with the
big airlines in this battle. Many
"rationalization" steps have
already been undertaken. In
October, the Department of
Transportation outlined a
seven-point program.
It was a program specifically
expressed in terms of the benefits
that would accrue to Pan Am —
$149 million in the October 1974
to December 1975 period, and
$156 million after that.
Which brings us back to
charters. Charters are the most
efficient type of passenger air
transport and we would therefore
expect that any increased
competition or "rationalization"
would show a swing towards that
type of service, right? But if
"rationalization" really means fat
subsidies, cutting out foreign
competition and a government
rear-guard protection from
charters, then why worry?

Fortunately, Congress seems to
be aware of pitfalls on the path
Pan Am is trying to lead us down.
Once locked into subsidization
and protectionism, the

Don Brunstein

government will be hard-pressed
to extricate itself from a Pan
Am quagmire.
The only real rationalization of
the airlines can come through
greater price flexibility and the
reduction of subsidization. Faced
with the very real problem of
petroleum and maintainance cost
increases, the airlines should be
allowed to reduce their route
Commitments and to expand the
use of charter-like services.
Sadly, the CAB disagrees.
Therefore, I would suggest that
the ASSU and others concerned
concentrate their lobbying efforts
on the Congress. The implications
here are far-reaching; for example,
the entire existence of Stanford's
Overseas program is threatened by
the cancellation of affinity group
charters.

increases, the airlines should be
allowed to reduce their route
Commitments and to expand the
use of charter-like services.
Sadly, the CAB disagrees.
Therefore, I would suggest that
the ASSU and others concerned
concentrate their lobbying efforts
on the Congress. The implications
here are far-reaching; for example,
the entire existence of Stanford's
Overseas program is threatened by
the cancellation of affinity group
charters.
Some may dislike the idea of
Pan Am's globelike insignia as the
province of Iran Air.
But if Pan Am gets its way
with the U.S. government, then I
say let the Shah sink his claws
into the rotting flesh of the "big
blue meatball" (to use a vivid
metaphor). I am sure it will give
him nothing but indigestion.
