# Administration Lays Another Big Egg
## 
### Jim Wascher 
Graduation is drawing closer every day,
and as it approaches, I frequently find myself
feeling less than elated at the prospect of
leaving Stanford. But then, lo and behold,
our University Administration comes along
and lays a great big egg — normally right on
top of the students — and the tears in my
eyes tend to dry up very quickly.
As this quarter began, I was deep in the
midst of one of those remorse-filled episodes
when I read about the latest Administration
egg. After wiping the mess from the top of
my head, I didn't feel quite as bad about
having to pack my bags in June.
The chicken responsible for this latest egg
is Peter Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs. Earlier this month, he
released a report on "Recommended Parking
and Transportation Policies for Stanford
University."
No matter where you turn in the
Carpenter Report, you find that it!s the
students who are getting screwed.
Parking Priorities
Take, for example, the priorities assigned
for purchase of a permit to park in the
"Academic Zone," which includes most of
the central campus. As usual, the faculty
comes first. Then the staff. Last, of course,
are the students.
According to the Carpenter Report, there
will be about 5100 parking spaces in the
"Academic Zone." There are about 1000
faculty members, and approximately 5700

people on the staff. Assuming that most of
these people drive to work, it is quite
conceivable that every single spot in the zone
could be taken before students arrive for
their 9 or 10 a.m. classes.

And if any spaces at all were open, they
would probably be among the 10 percent in
the "Academic Zone" which Carpenter wants
regulated by parking meters at a price of 25
cents per hour or $1 per day.
Off-Campus Students
The students who would be most
interested in parking in the "Academic
Zone" would presumably be those who live
off campus. The inconvenience they already
suffer in getting to school seems quite
sufficient without adding to their burden, as
the Carpenter Report proposes.
At least 4000 students live off campus —
most because the University didn't have any
space for them in the housing system. So
they get screwed by having to shell out rent

money, and, possibly, by having to buy a car
when they otherwise would not.
Then the University turns around and
socks them with $45 a year in parking fees —
plus as much as $1 a day more if they have to
park in a space with a meter.
Of course,'you could always try to sneak
into the "Academic Zone" without paying,
and risk getting a $2 ticket, right? Sorry.
Carpenter wants the parking violation fine
raised to $10, or almost as much as you'd
have to pay for a minor moving violation.
Oh yes, there is one other little goody in
the Carpenter Report: his "Parking and
Transportation Trust Fund," which he says
would "be used exclusively for capital
improvements to the parking and
transportation system and to fund
innovations, experini3nts, and the
incremental costs of instituting a
paid-parking system."
That last phrase is a neat escape clause
under which the University can avoid using
parking fee revenues to fill in the moon-like
craters in our roads, and instead use them to
pay the salaries of the policemen and clerks
needed to run and enforce the system. It's a
nice way to cut down the University's deficit.
So, the next time you see me walking
around campus with a tear in my eye, look a
little closer — it just might be egg white.

The students who would be most
interested in parking in the "Academic
Zone" would presumably be those who live
off campus. The inconvenience they already
suffer in getting to school seems quite
sufficient without adding to their burden, as
the Carpenter Report proposes.
At least 4000 students live off campus —
most because the University didn't have any
space for them in the housing system. So
they get screwed by having to shell out rent

money, and, possibly, by having to buy a car
when they otherwise would not.
Then the University turns around and
socks them with $45 a year in parking fees —
plus as much as $1 a day more if they have to
park in a space with a meter.
Of course,'you could always try to sneak
into the "Academic Zone" without paying,
and risk getting a $2 ticket, right? Sorry.
Carpenter wants the parking violation fine
raised to $10, or almost as much as you'd
have to pay for a minor moving violation.
Oh yes, there is one other little goody in
the Carpenter Report: his "Parking and
Transportation Trust Fund," which he says
would "be used exclusively for capital
improvements to the parking and
transportation system and to fund
innovations, experini3nts, and the
incremental costs of instituting a
paid-parking system."
That last phrase is a neat escape clause
under which the University can avoid using
parking fee revenues to fill in the moon-like
craters in our roads, and instead use them to
pay the salaries of the policemen and clerks
needed to run and enforce the system. It's a
nice way to cut down the University's deficit.
So, the next time you see me walking
around campus with a tear in my eye, look a
little closer — it just might be egg white.

'IF IT DOESN'T FLY, WE'D LIKE TO BE TEST PILOTS FOR YOUR NEXT SHOT!'

Graduation is drawing closer every day,
and as it approaches, I frequently find myself
feeling less than elated at the prospect of
leaving Stanford. But then, lo and behold,
our University Administration comes along
and lays a great big egg — normally right on
top of the students — and the tears in my
eyes tend to dry up very quickly.
As this quarter began, I was deep in the
midst of one of those remorse-filled episodes
when I read about the latest Administration
egg. After wiping the mess from the top of
my head, I didn't feel quite as bad about
having to pack my bags in June.
The chicken responsible for this latest egg
is Peter Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs. Earlier this month, he
released a report on "Recommended Parking
and Transportation Policies for Stanford
University."
No matter where you turn in the
Carpenter Report, you find that it!s the
students who are getting screwed.
Parking Priorities
Take, for example, the priorities assigned
for purchase of a permit to park in the
"Academic Zone," which includes most of
the central campus. As usual, the faculty
comes first. Then the staff. Last, of course,
are the students.
According to the Carpenter Report, there
will be about 5100 parking spaces in the
"Academic Zone." There are about 1000
faculty members, and approximately 5700

people on the staff. Assuming that most of
these people drive to work, it is quite
conceivable that every single spot in the zone
could be taken before students arrive for
their 9 or 10 a.m. classes.

And if any spaces at all were open, they
would probably be among the 10 percent in
the "Academic Zone" which Carpenter wants
regulated by parking meters at a price of 25
cents per hour or $1 per day.
Off-Campus Students
