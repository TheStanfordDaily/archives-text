Christiansen Is Wrong
Kditor:
Jack Christiansen suggested
recently (Sports Illustrated, March
31) that Stanford's "minor"
sports program will likely "take
the axe" to save football from
inflation, on the dubious premise
that paying one's way is the goal
we should foster in college sports.
As a football fan, I hope that
fast and concerted action will be
taken to stop ruinous costs (like
Stanford's $660,000 per year for
football scholarships), but barring
that, I maintain that the small
sports serve education at Stanford
better than the two Rose Bowl
games Stanford has had since
1950. I further contend that
cutting them is no price to pay for
a yearly quixotic quest to beat
Southern California.
I demand that Christiansen, as
coach at the best educational
university on the west coast, come
into line with its values. He might
even find that such leadership
would find receptive attention
from John McKay.

Why is the Daily pushing
Journey albums so hard? They
were completely outclassed by
Dave Mason at their concert here,
though one wouldn't know it by
your review. They are complete
unknowns outside the Bay area.
But the grossest move was
comparing Journey favorably to
Derek and the Dominoes. Neil
Schon is still in the Little League
compared to the combined talents
of Clapton and Duane Allman.
Granted, they are better than
your average local group and their
album is good for a group's first,
but I suggest that your reviewers
be more careful with their
superlatives.
