# Moynihan's Background: Much Misunderstood
## 
### 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan is not
the first commencement speaker
at Stanford in recent years to
excite controversy. One speaker
in the 1960s was picketed by
political groups on the left who
objected to his presence; more
common have been the objections
from the political right on the
grounds that the choice of
speakers always seems to fall to
the left of center.
What is new in the case of
Moynihan is that 12 faculty
members from the Anthropology
Department have seen fit publicly
to denounce his selection in a
statement released at a press
conference last month.
Having gone on record
publicly, however, they now stand
to be judged publicly, and my
judgment is that the document
they have produced falls short of
the standard of discourse we have
a right to expect.
Others may judge for

themselves whether Moynihan's
research and policy positions are
good, bad, or indifferent. There is
certainly grounds for dispute and
Moynihan has never hidden his
positions from view. It is not my
purpose to defend any of his
views; rather I wish to make it
clear tnat the basis on which we
are told that he should not have
been invited is unacceptable.
The defects in the
Anthropology Department
statement are small and large.
First, the statement said that
"the policies with which [ his
work | is connected are deplorable
in human terms and the social
science it contains is assailable in
scholarly terms."
Those policies are nowhere
specified. Surely an honest count
of Moynihan's public advocacy
would include his key role in
persuading the Nixon
Administration to advocate a
guaranteed minimum income
plan. The omission of this fact is

especially noteworthy because it
is the major policy proposal with
which Moynihan is identified and
because it derives most clearly
from his report. The Negro
Family.
The point, of course, is that
the existing welfare system is
itself a major cause of
the pathology which — rightly or
wrongly — he believed he saw, and
that a new approach which
emphasized the right to a decent
minimum income rather than
dependency on the professional
welfare bureaucracy was required
if matters were to be changed for
the better.
Since we are not told what
policies are "deplorable in human
terms," we have no way of
knowing whether this is one of
them. I doubt that most people
would think so.
Moynihan Misidentified
Second, in connection with the
paper, The Negro Family, the
anthropology professors claimed
that "it should be noted that
Moynihan was neither a
sociologist not an anthropologist
and had done no research on
either the black community or
race relations. He was simply an
economist in the Department of
Labor."
The latter sentence is wrong on
two counts: First, Moynihan is
not (and was not) an economist at
all. He was and is a political
scientist (perhaps political
sociologist would be more
accurate). Nowhere in the
statement are we informed that
Moynihan was in fact Assistant
Secretary of Labor for Policy
Planning and Research and hence
was writing on a subject well
within the scope of his
responsibilities.
The first of the quoted
sentences may most charitably be
explained as a minor bit of
academic imperialism which, if
taken seriously, would have
silenced Gunnar Myrdahl — who
was and is an economist — among
a host of other distinguished
persons who happily had the
temerity to poach on the
academic preserves of others.
Neglect Misunderstood
Finally.the anthropology 1
professors said that "in 1968
Moynihan became an adviser to
President Nixon and won
notoriety for proposing a policy
of 'benign neglect' in dealing with
blacks in the United States."
Any of the previous examples
might be excused individually
(although not cumulatively) as

innocent oversight or simple
human error. Not this one,
however, for in the minds of
many people "benign neglect" is
the single phrase most clearly
associated with Moynihan. Here in
relevant part, is what Moynihan
actually said in the famous
memorandum:
"The time may have come
when the issue of race could
benefit from a period of 'benign
neglect' The subject has been too
much talked about. The forum
has been too much taken over by
hysterics, paranoids and boodlers
on all sides. We may need a period
in which Negro progress continues
and racial rhetoric fades.
"The Administration can help
bring this about by paying close
attention to such progress — as we
are doing — while seeking to avoid
situations in which extremists of
either race are given opportunities
for martyrdom, histrionics or
whatever. Greater attention to
Indians, Mexican-Americans and
Puerto Ricans would be useful. A
tendency to ignore provocations
from groups such as the Black
Panthers might also be useful...."
Courageous Advice
Whatever one thinks of this
passage — and to an
Administration whose Attorney

Robert Rosenzweig

General was John Mitchell, it
strikes me as both good and
courageous advice — I would be
willing to wager that very few
people at Stanford have any very
clear idea of the context in which
the phrase "benign neglect" was
used. If the signers of the
statement did, then their
reference to it was intentionally
misleading.
If they did not, then they
failed in the most elementary, and
not even very demanding,
requirement of inquiry before
putting their names to a public
attack on a man's integrity and
commitment to social justice and
racial equality.
In a University the answer to
alleged error is truth. In that
spirit, a thoughtful examination
of Moynihan's views on race,
poverty, high education, the
Coleman Report, India, the
United Nations, or any other
subject on which he has been
involved as a public official or an
academic is clearly in order. But
let us keep silent rather than have
our noises mock the standards of
inquiry and discourse for which
the University stands.

would include his key role in
persuading the Nixon
Administration to advocate a
guaranteed minimum income
plan. The omission of this fact is

especially noteworthy because it
is the major policy proposal with
which Moynihan is identified and
because it derives most clearly
from his report. The Negro
Family.
The point, of course, is that
the existing welfare system is
itself a major cause of
the pathology which — rightly or
wrongly — he believed he saw, and
that a new approach which
emphasized the right to a decent
minimum income rather than
dependency on the professional
welfare bureaucracy was required
if matters were to be changed for
the better.
Since we are not told what
policies are "deplorable in human
terms," we have no way of
knowing whether this is one of
them. I doubt that most people
would think so.
Moynihan Misidentified
Second, in connection with the
paper, The Negro Family, the
anthropology professors claimed
that "it should be noted that
Moynihan was neither a
sociologist not an anthropologist
and had done no research on
either the black community or
race relations. He was simply an
economist in the Department of
Labor."
The latter sentence is wrong on
two counts: First, Moynihan is
not (and was not) an economist at
all. He was and is a political
scientist (perhaps political
sociologist would be more
accurate). Nowhere in the
statement are we informed that
Moynihan was in fact Assistant
Secretary of Labor for Policy
Planning and Research and hence
was writing on a subject well
within the scope of his
responsibilities.
The first of the quoted
sentences may most charitably be
explained as a minor bit of
academic imperialism which, if
taken seriously, would have
silenced Gunnar Myrdahl — who
was and is an economist — among
a host of other distinguished
persons who happily had the
temerity to poach on the
academic preserves of others.
Neglect Misunderstood
Finally.the anthropology 1
professors said that "in 1968
Moynihan became an adviser to
President Nixon and won
notoriety for proposing a policy
of 'benign neglect' in dealing with
blacks in the United States."
Any of the previous examples
might be excused individually
(although not cumulatively) as

innocent oversight or simple
human error. Not this one,
however, for in the minds of
many people "benign neglect" is
the single phrase most clearly
associated with Moynihan. Here in
relevant part, is what Moynihan
actually said in the famous
memorandum:
"The time may have come
when the issue of race could
benefit from a period of 'benign
neglect' The subject has been too
much talked about. The forum
has been too much taken over by
hysterics, paranoids and boodlers
on all sides. We may need a period
in which Negro progress continues
and racial rhetoric fades.
"The Administration can help
bring this about by paying close
attention to such progress — as we
are doing — while seeking to avoid
situations in which extremists of
either race are given opportunities
for martyrdom, histrionics or
whatever. Greater attention to
Indians, Mexican-Americans and
Puerto Ricans would be useful. A
tendency to ignore provocations
from groups such as the Black
Panthers might also be useful...."
Courageous Advice
Whatever one thinks of this
passage — and to an
Administration whose Attorney

Robert Rosenzweig

General was John Mitchell, it
strikes me as both good and
courageous advice — I would be
willing to wager that very few
people at Stanford have any very
clear idea of the context in which
the phrase "benign neglect" was
used. If the signers of the
statement did, then their
reference to it was intentionally
misleading.
If they did not, then they
failed in the most elementary, and
not even very demanding,
requirement of inquiry before
putting their names to a public
attack on a man's integrity and
commitment to social justice and
racial equality.
In a University the answer to
alleged error is truth. In that
spirit, a thoughtful examination
of Moynihan's views on race,
poverty, high education, the
Coleman Report, India, the
United Nations, or any other
subject on which he has been
involved as a public official or an
academic is clearly in order. But
let us keep silent rather than have
our noises mock the standards of
inquiry and discourse for which
the University stands.
(Hubert Rosenzweig is University
vice president for public affairs.)
Daniel Patrick Moynihan is not
the first commencement speaker
at Stanford in recent years to
excite controversy. One speaker
in the 1960s was picketed by
political groups on the left who
objected to his presence; more
common have been the objections
from the political right on the
grounds that the choice of
speakers always seems to fall to
the left of center.
What is new in the case of
Moynihan is that 12 faculty
members from the Anthropology
Department have seen fit publicly
to denounce his selection in a
statement released at a press
conference last month.
Having gone on record
publicly, however, they now stand
to be judged publicly, and my
judgment is that the document
they have produced falls short of
the standard of discourse we have
a right to expect.
Others may judge for

themselves whether Moynihan's
research and policy positions are
good, bad, or indifferent. There is
certainly grounds for dispute and
Moynihan has never hidden his
positions from view. It is not my
purpose to defend any of his
views; rather I wish to make it
clear tnat the basis on which we
are told that he should not have
been invited is unacceptable.
The defects in the
Anthropology Department
statement are small and large.
First, the statement said that
"the policies with which [ his
work | is connected are deplorable
in human terms and the social
science it contains is assailable in
scholarly terms."
Those policies are nowhere
specified. Surely an honest count
of Moynihan's public advocacy
would include his key role in
persuading the Nixon
Administration to advocate a
guaranteed minimum income
plan. The omission of this fact is

especially noteworthy because it

within the scope of his
responsibilities.
The first of the quoted
sentences may most charitably be
explained as a minor bit of
academic imperialism which, if
taken seriously, would have
silenced Gunnar Myrdahl — who
was and is an economist — among
a host of other distinguished
persons who happily had the
temerity to poach on the
academic preserves of others.
Neglect Misunderstood
Finally.the anthropology 1
professors said that "in 1968
Moynihan became an adviser to
President Nixon and won
notoriety for proposing a policy
of 'benign neglect' in dealing with
blacks in the United States."
Any of the previous examples
might be excused individually
(although not cumulatively) as

innocent oversight or simple
human error. Not this one,
however, for in the minds of
many people "benign neglect" is
the single phrase most clearly
associated with Moynihan. Here in
relevant part, is what Moynihan
actually said in the famous
memorandum:
"The time may have come
when the issue of race could
benefit from a period of 'benign
neglect' The subject has been too
much talked about. The forum
has been too much taken over by
hysterics, paranoids and boodlers
on all sides. We may need a period
in which Negro progress continues
and racial rhetoric fades.
"The Administration can help
bring this about by paying close
attention to such progress — as we
are doing — while seeking to avoid
situations in which extremists of
either race are given opportunities
for martyrdom, histrionics or
whatever. Greater attention to
Indians, Mexican-Americans and
Puerto Ricans would be useful. A
tendency to ignore provocations
from groups such as the Black
Panthers might also be useful...."
Courageous Advice
Whatever one thinks of this
passage — and to an
Administration whose Attorney

Robert Rosenzweig

General was John Mitchell, it
strikes me as both good and
courageous advice — I would be
willing to wager that very few
people at Stanford have any very
clear idea of the context in which
the phrase "benign neglect" was
used. If the signers of the
statement did, then their
reference to it was intentionally
misleading.
If they did not, then they
failed in the most elementary, and
not even very demanding,
requirement of inquiry before
putting their names to a public
attack on a man's integrity and
commitment to social justice and
racial equality.
In a University the answer to
alleged error is truth. In that
spirit, a thoughtful examination
of Moynihan's views on race,
poverty, high education, the
Coleman Report, India, the
United Nations, or any other
subject on which he has been
involved as a public official or an
academic is clearly in order. But
let us keep silent rather than have
our noises mock the standards of
inquiry and discourse for which
the University stands.
(Hubert Rosenzweig is University
vice president for public affairs.)
Daniel Patrick Moynihan is not
the first commencement speaker
at Stanford in recent years to
excite controversy. One speaker
in the 1960s was picketed by
political groups on the left who
objected to his presence; more
common have been the objections
from the political right on the
grounds that the choice of
speakers always seems to fall to
the left of center.
What is new in the case of
Moynihan is that 12 faculty
members from the Anthropology
Department have seen fit publicly
to denounce his selection in a
statement released at a press
conference last month.
Having gone on record
publicly, however, they now stand
to be judged publicly, and my
judgment is that the document
they have produced falls short of
the standard of discourse we have
a right to expect.
Others may judge for

themselves whether Moynihan's
research and policy positions are
good, bad, or indifferent. There is
certainly grounds for dispute and
Moynihan has never hidden his
positions from view. It is not my
purpose to defend any of his
views; rather I wish to make it
clear tnat the basis on which we
are told that he should not have
been invited is unacceptable.
The defects in the
Anthropology Department
statement are small and large.
First, the statement said that
"the policies with which [ his
work | is connected are deplorable
in human terms and the social
science it contains is assailable in
scholarly terms."
Those policies are nowhere
specified. Surely an honest count
of Moynihan's public advocacy
would include his key role in
persuading the Nixon
Administration to advocate a
guaranteed minimum income
plan. The omission of this fact is

especially noteworthy because it
is the major policy proposal with
which Moynihan is identified and
because it derives most clearly
from his report. The Negro
Family.
The point, of course, is that
the existing welfare system is
itself a major cause of
the pathology which — rightly or
wrongly — he believed he saw, and
that a new approach which
emphasized the right to a decent
minimum income rather than
dependency on the professional
welfare bureaucracy was required
if matters were to be changed for
the better.
Since we are not told what
policies are "deplorable in human
terms," we have no way of
knowing whether this is one of
them. I doubt that most people
would think so.
Moynihan Misidentified
Second, in connection with the
paper, The Negro Family, the
anthropology professors claimed
that "it should be noted that
Moynihan was neither a
sociologist not an anthropologist
and had done no research on
either the black community or
race relations. He was simply an
economist in the Department of
Labor."
The latter sentence is wrong on
two counts: First, Moynihan is
not (and was not) an economist at
all. He was and is a political
scientist (perhaps political
sociologist would be more
accurate). Nowhere in the
statement are we informed that
Moynihan was in fact Assistant
Secretary of Labor for Policy
Planning and Research and hence
was writing on a subject well
within the scope of his
responsibilities.
The first of the quoted
sentences may most charitably be
explained as a minor bit of
academic imperialism which, if
taken seriously, would have
silenced Gunnar Myrdahl — who
was and is an economist — among
a host of other distinguished
persons who happily had the
