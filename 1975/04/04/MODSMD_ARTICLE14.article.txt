# Ailing Groups Seek Financial 'Blood' Transfusions
## 
### RANDALL TURK 
The perverse logic that captured the
imagination of 18th century doctors, men of
learning who drew blood from their patients
in ever larger amounts with each sign of
advancing deterioration, has now become
popular at Stanford in the guise of fee
assessments.
Requests for $15 in fee assessments for
next year will appear on the upcoming spring
election ballot, a 50 percent increase over this
year's $10 assessment, itself an increase of
over 50 percent from last year.
The logic behind these increases, like that
of the good doctors, has its roots in grim
indicators of deterioration.
Inflation and tight money have forced the
University to trim its budget by $10 million.
A policy of frugality is felt everywhere on
campus, not the least by student organizations
dependent upon alms from their affiliated
departments.
Economic Casualties
Sharp cutbacks have been squeezing
student groups from departmental budgets,

and the dispossessed groups almost doubled
the number of requests for funds from the
ASSU Program Fee Assessment this year.
Inflation has also severely watered the
spending power of what money is available,
forcing organizations that may have
previously been self-sufficient, or nearly
self-sufficient, to seek additional funding to
supplement their dwindling stores.
Equally grim, but perhaps not as
immediately irreversible, are the twin beliefs
that the student body is the appropriate blood
bank from which economic disaster victims
should make their withdrawals, and that the
student body will magnanimously permit such
blood-letting.
The logic here is familiar. The patient is
assured that the more that is taken from him
the better will be his general health.

scratched 37 funding requests from the
Program Fee Assessment budget proposal he
submitted to the ASSU Senate, systematically
eliminating all groups which could

conceivably receive funding elsewhere.
By doing so he cut the Program Fee from
$2 to $1, a small but welcome relief. He also
forced 27 student groups to find other sources
of funds, collect dues from their members,
make cutbacks in their program activities, or
disband altogether.
The problems these small groups face are
different only in degree from those of larger
organizations which have filed petitions for
special fee assessments on the spring ballot.
All of these organizations, with their
accumulated appeals for money, have
suddenly raised serious questions about the
importance and survival of student groups at
Stanford.

Can the student body, beset by the same
economic woes which trouble the rest of the
University and the nation, reasonably be
asked to subsidize the many non-curricular
activities at Stanford?
If not, and money from other sources is
not forthcoming, is Stanford prepared to
witness the disappearance of part of what
makes it a diverse and attractive institution?

assessments.
Requests for $15 in fee assessments for
next year will appear on the upcoming spring
election ballot, a 50 percent increase over this
year's $10 assessment, itself an increase of
over 50 percent from last year.
The logic behind these increases, like that
of the good doctors, has its roots in grim
indicators of deterioration.
Inflation and tight money have forced the
University to trim its budget by $10 million.
A policy of frugality is felt everywhere on
campus, not the least by student organizations
dependent upon alms from their affiliated
departments.
Economic Casualties
Sharp cutbacks have been squeezing
student groups from departmental budgets,

and the dispossessed groups almost doubled
the number of requests for funds from the
ASSU Program Fee Assessment this year.
Inflation has also severely watered the
spending power of what money is available,
forcing organizations that may have
previously been self-sufficient, or nearly
self-sufficient, to seek additional funding to
supplement their dwindling stores.
Equally grim, but perhaps not as
immediately irreversible, are the twin beliefs
that the student body is the appropriate blood
bank from which economic disaster victims
should make their withdrawals, and that the
student body will magnanimously permit such
blood-letting.
The logic here is familiar. The patient is
assured that the more that is taken from him
the better will be his general health.

scratched 37 funding requests from the
Program Fee Assessment budget proposal he
submitted to the ASSU Senate, systematically
eliminating all groups which could

conceivably receive funding elsewhere.
By doing so he cut the Program Fee from
$2 to $1, a small but welcome relief. He also
forced 27 student groups to find other sources
of funds, collect dues from their members,
make cutbacks in their program activities, or
disband altogether.
The problems these small groups face are
different only in degree from those of larger
organizations which have filed petitions for
special fee assessments on the spring ballot.
All of these organizations, with their
accumulated appeals for money, have
suddenly raised serious questions about the
importance and survival of student groups at
Stanford.
Support For Diversity?
Can the student body, beset by the same
economic woes which trouble the rest of the
University and the nation, reasonably be
asked to subsidize the many non-curricular
activities at Stanford?
If not, and money from other sources is
not forthcoming, is Stanford prepared to
witness the disappearance of part of what
makes it a diverse and attractive institution?


bluud BANK — Organizations caught in an economic squeeze are looking to student fee
assessments as a source of support. The upcoming ASSU elections will allow students to decide
which groups deserve financial backing.
The perverse logic that captured the
imagination of 18th century doctors, men of
learning who drew blood from their patients
in ever larger amounts with each sign of
advancing deterioration, has now become
popular at Stanford in the guise of fee
assessments.
