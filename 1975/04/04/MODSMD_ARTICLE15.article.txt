# University Agrees To Develop Iranian Satellite; Contract Opponents Dig In For A Long Fight
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
To no one's surprise, the University and
Iran have signed a contract for the designing
of a domestic communication satellite.
A vocal segment of the student community
has spent much time and energy protesting
the contract and even producing an eight-page
newspaper about it. These students, mostly
members of the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) and Iranians studying here, have held
several discussions with the principal
recipients of the contract, Electrical
Engineering Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker.
The main controversy is the potential use
of the satellite. The Shah of Iran first
proposed the system as part of his plan to
industrialize Iran, which now has about 15
million people living in rural areas. These
villages are largely inaccessible by standard
telephone and broadcast systems.
Lusignan and Parker have been involved in
producing a similar satellite system for remote
villages in Alaska, and are considered experts
in the field.
Research Defended
"The major significance of this research lies
in the opportunity to develop and
demonstrate the means of bringing education,
health and other social services to the poorest
and remotest segments of the population in
developing countries," Parker says.

Lusignan defends his work as a step
towards improving the health care and
education of Iran's largely illiterate
population.
ARC members and the Iranian student
protestors disagree.
"The University would be giving the Shah
the technology and know-how to further
extend his ability to indoctrinate and exploit
the people of Iran," claims one Iranian, who
prefers to remain anonymous.
Shah's Control
Few observers deny that the Shah runs a
tightly controlled government. In November,
Harper's reported that Iran has one secret
police agent for every 450 people, and that
political opponents of the Shah "literally
disappear into the night."
ARC and Iranian protestors agree that the
Shah is likely to use this new communication
system to expand the already extensive
surveillance system in Iran.
Critics also point to the possibility of
government using a national broadcast system
for propaganda purposes. ARC member Chris
Gray says that a previous literacy program,
which sent teachers to remote villages, was
crushed because "some of the corps started
teaching the peasants revolution. A large
movement was started in the north of the
country which was only crushed with much
bloodshed."

In a critique of broadcast education
systems, Education Profs. Martin Carnoy and
Henry Levin suggest that a centralized
communication network is most appealing to
totalitarian governments interested in limiting
the type of information available to the
poorer classes.
They also speculate that the introduction
of mass media "may serve to temporarily
quell legitimate demands for social change"
by giving the impression of equal opportunity.
In answer to these criticisms, Lusignan says
that the Shah will probably stick by his stated
objectives of education and industrialization.
He adds that the satellite system will take "20
to 50 years" to become effective, a long time
relative to the cycles of political change in
developing countries.
Protest Persists
Although the contract has already been
signed, protestors say they will continue to
fight the decision. Undergraduate Tom
Wainwright says he hopes students can
"arouse the awareness of the community and
establish some policies regarding guidelines for
such contracts."
Student efforts to eliminate classified
research from campus took three years; the
opponents of the Iranian contract also seem
determined to advance their cause.

movement was started in the north of the
country which was only crushed with much
bloodshed."

In a critique of broadcast education
systems, Education Profs. Martin Carnoy and
Henry Levin suggest that a centralized
communication network is most appealing to
totalitarian governments interested in limiting
the type of information available to the
poorer classes.
They also speculate that the introduction
of mass media "may serve to temporarily
quell legitimate demands for social change"
by giving the impression of equal opportunity.
In answer to these criticisms, Lusignan says
that the Shah will probably stick by his stated
objectives of education and industrialization.
He adds that the satellite system will take "20
to 50 years" to become effective, a long time
relative to the cycles of political change in
developing countries.
Protest Persists
Although the contract has already been
signed, protestors say they will continue to
fight the decision. Undergraduate Tom
Wainwright says he hopes students can
"arouse the awareness of the community and
establish some policies regarding guidelines for
such contracts."
Student efforts to eliminate classified
research from campus took three years; the
opponents of the Iranian contract also seem
determined to advance their cause.


Iranian Student Protesters
To no one's surprise, the University and
Iran have signed a contract for the designing
of a domestic communication satellite.
A vocal segment of the student community
has spent much time and energy protesting
the contract and even producing an eight-page
newspaper about it. These students, mostly
members of the Alliance for Radical Change
(ARC) and Iranians studying here, have held
several discussions with the principal
recipients of the contract, Electrical
Engineering Prof. Bruce Lusignan and
Communication Prof. Edwin Parker.
The main controversy is the potential use
of the satellite. The Shah of Iran first
proposed the system as part of his plan to
industrialize Iran, which now has about 15
million people living in rural areas. These
villages are largely inaccessible by standard
telephone and broadcast systems.
Lusignan and Parker have been involved in
producing a similar satellite system for remote
villages in Alaska, and are considered experts
in the field.
Research Defended
"The major significance of this research lies
in the opportunity to develop and
demonstrate the means of bringing education,
health and other social services to the poorest
and remotest segments of the population in
developing countries," Parker says.

Lusignan defends his work as a step
towards improving the health care and
education of Iran's largely illiterate
population.
ARC members and the Iranian student
protestors disagree.
"The University would be giving the Shah
the technology and know-how to further
extend his ability to indoctrinate and exploit
the people of Iran," claims one Iranian, who
prefers to remain anonymous.
Shah's Control
Few observers deny that the Shah runs a
tightly controlled government. In November,
Harper's reported that Iran has one secret
police agent for every 450 people, and that
political opponents of the Shah "literally
disappear into the night."
ARC and Iranian protestors agree that the
Shah is likely to use this new communication
system to expand the already extensive
surveillance system in Iran.
Critics also point to the possibility of
government using a national broadcast system
for propaganda purposes. ARC member Chris
Gray says that a previous literacy program,
which sent teachers to remote villages, was
crushed because "some of the corps started
teaching the peasants revolution. A large
movement was started in the north of the
country which was only crushed with much
bloodshed."
