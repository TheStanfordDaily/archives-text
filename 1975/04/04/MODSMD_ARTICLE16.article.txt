# New Campus Parking Plan: Proposals, Protests, Problems
## 
### KATHY BATTS 
What happens to Peter Carpenter's report
on "Recommended Parking and
Transportation Policies" will be up to the
students, faculty and staff of the Stanford
community.
"This is probably the first time in modern
history at Stanford that we have really tried
to find out what people are thinking,"
Carpenter said last week.
Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs, submitted his report to the

University vice presidents March 24, following
a stormy winter quarter which included a
lawsuit filed by students over the University's
current parking policy.
The current policy requires purchase of a
$7.50 parking sticker for students. Faculty
and staff are allowed to park free of charge.
Carpenter's report calls for free vehicle
registration, allows free parking in a "Free
Zone" and charges $12 per quarter for
"Residence Zone" parking, $15 per quarter
for "Academic Zone" parking.

The fees arc steeper because the report
urges that a priority be given to pedestrians
and bicyclists over motorists.
The University vice presidents have asked
the Committee on Land and Buildings to hold
a public hearing on the report Monday. The
vice presidents will also receive input from
various campus groups before forwarding their
recommendations to President Richard
Lyman. Lyman's decision is due before the
end of this quarter, before everyone leaves for
summer vacation.
Carpenter also allowed for community
input in the process of writing the report.
Public hearings, though sparsely attended,
were held. And 1500 questionnaires were sent
out, with 600 returned. The report includes
pages of statistics from these and other
questionnaires — statistics which Carpenter
has incorporated into his recommendations.
This seems impressive. Perhaps, in light of
past experiences, the University feels the
protests and cries of "arrogance" will not be
so loud if it appears that the administration
has tried to get a feel for student opinion.
Perhaps some of the student opinions may
be implemented. And others may not. But it
does appear that if the report is accepted in its
present form, many people will be paying $36
to $60 a year for a "hunting license" to find a
parking space.
The Tresidder parking lot, in a central
location, is designated as a Free Zone in the
report. This could prove to be a very crowded
lot, based on a first come-first serve basis. This
seems out of line with the report's basic
concept of paying more for more
conveniently located parking spaces.
Carpenter's report lists several scary
statistics about what goes on at other schools.
At Yale, illegally parked vehicles are towed
away daily, with no prior notice. At Cal, the
parking fee for students is $72 per year.
UCLA charges $108 per year. Penn collects
$189 per year.
But scare stories do not placate angry
students who are used to paying less.
Carpenter said when he submitted his
report that he was "aiming at uniform
unhappiness — you can't please everyone."
This is true. And he may find out to what
extent on Monday night.

parking space.
The Tresidder parking lot, in a central
location, is designated as a Free Zone in the
report. This could prove to be a very crowded
lot, based on a first come-first serve basis. This
seems out of line with the report's basic
concept of paying more for more
conveniently located parking spaces.
Carpenter's report lists several scary
statistics about what goes on at other schools.
At Yale, illegally parked vehicles are towed
away daily, with no prior notice. At Cal, the
parking fee for students is $72 per year.
UCLA charges $108 per year. Penn collects
$189 per year.
But scare stories do not placate angry
students who are used to paying less.
Carpenter said when he submitted his
report that he was "aiming at uniform
unhappiness — you can't please everyone."
This is true. And he may find out to what
extent on Monday night.
What happens to Peter Carpenter's report
on "Recommended Parking and
Transportation Policies" will be up to the
students, faculty and staff of the Stanford
community.
"This is probably the first time in modern
history at Stanford that we have really tried
to find out what people are thinking,"
Carpenter said last week.
Carpenter, assistant vice president for
medical affairs, submitted his report to the

University vice presidents March 24, following
a stormy winter quarter which included a
lawsuit filed by students over the University's
current parking policy.
The current policy requires purchase of a
$7.50 parking sticker for students. Faculty
and staff are allowed to park free of charge.
Carpenter's report calls for free vehicle
registration, allows free parking in a "Free
Zone" and charges $12 per quarter for
"Residence Zone" parking, $15 per quarter
for "Academic Zone" parking.

The fees arc steeper because the report
urges that a priority be given to pedestrians
and bicyclists over motorists.
The University vice presidents have asked
the Committee on Land and Buildings to hold
a public hearing on the report Monday. The
vice presidents will also receive input from
various campus groups before forwarding their
recommendations to President Richard
Lyman. Lyman's decision is due before the
end of this quarter, before everyone leaves for
summer vacation.
Carpenter also allowed for community
input in the process of writing the report.
Public hearings, though sparsely attended,
were held. And 1500 questionnaires were sent
out, with 600 returned. The report includes
pages of statistics from these and other
questionnaires — statistics which Carpenter
has incorporated into his recommendations.
This seems impressive. Perhaps, in light of
past experiences, the University feels the
protests and cries of "arrogance" will not be
so loud if it appears that the administration
has tried to get a feel for student opinion.
Perhaps some of the student opinions may
be implemented. And others may not. But it
does appear that if the report is accepted in its
present form, many people will be paying $36
to $60 a year for a "hunting license" to find a
parking space.
