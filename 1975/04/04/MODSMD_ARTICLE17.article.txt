# Law Profs Probe Nixon High Court Appointments
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The consensus among legal scholars here
is that Richard Nixon's four appointments
to the Supreme Court have had far less
impact upon the high Court's decisions
than was anticipated at the time these
appointments were made.
Instead of overturning the "activist" or
"permissive" decisions rendered by the
Warren Court, the new Court has merely
refused to extend those decisions as the
Warren Court might have.
"The impact of the appointments has
been, in large measure, to stop the
momentum of development which the
Court had begun in certain areas,"
according to Assoc. Law Prof. Paul Brest.
Political Science Prof. Robert Morn
noted that Nixon's appointees have made it
"a more conservative Court, as these terms
are generally used, and this is true in
virtually any area at which you look."
A recent study of the Court's decisions
in its last two terms revealed that the four
Nixon appointees, Chief Justice Warren
Burger, and Assoc. Justices Harry
Blackmun, Lewis Powell Jr. and William
Rehnquist, voted as a bloc from 70 to 75
percent of tne time.

Horn noted that "most of the time,
|Assoc. Justice Potter) Stewart or (Assoc.
Justice Byron | White, or both of them,
have joined the Nixon appointees to form a
majority." But the decisions of majorities
formed in this manner have been by no
means predictable.
For instance, Law Prof. William Cohen
said the Court's decisions to overturn most
states' death penalty and abortion statutes
were "considerably more liberal than 1
would have expected" (all four Nixon
appointees, however, dissented in the death
penalty case).
Brest agreed, noting that "the most
radical decisions of the recent Court —
especially the abortion case — wcie reached
with most of the Nixon appointees in the
majority." In Roe us, Wade, the 1973 ruling
which ruled most abortion statutes
unconstitutional, Rehnquist was the only
Nixon appointee who dissented.
And, of course, each scholar is quick to
point out that the Court ruled
unanimously against Nixon in the
WaU'rgate tapes case — with Burger writing
the Court's opinion.
In the area of criminal procedure, Law
Prof. Cerald Gunther said the Nixon

appointees have been "by and large more
sympathetic to the prosecutor's claims"
and that the Court has been "nibbling at
the edges of Warren Court decisions."
However, Cunther also pointed out that
the Nixon appointees "are not extremists
on the law and order side." He cited a
unanimous 1972 Court opinion banning
electronic surveillance in domestic security
cases without a warrant.
Brest said that, in the area of obscenity,
"the Warren Court seemed close to saying
that any consenting adult can see or read
whatever he or she wants to see or read.
Clearly the Court has rejected that stand
and has again allowed the states
considerable leeway in regulating
obscenity," he added.
According to Cohen, "the Court has
recently gone further in the area of striking
down limitations of people's right to vote."
But, he added, "in the area of
reapportionment, the states now have a bit
more discretion | in drawing voting district
boundaries! than they did at the end of
the Warren Court."
Cohen believes the Court recently has
handed down several conservative decisions
relating to citizens' 14th Amendment

rights to the equal protection of the laws.
For instance, in 1973, "the Court by a
5-4 vote said there was no constitutional
mandate to equalize local school funding
on a district by district basis." However,
Cohen emphasizes that "the vote might
have been exactly the same under the
Warren Court" in this and other equal
protection cases.
The clouded judicial picture which has
emerged from Supreme Court decisions in
which the Nixon appointees have
participated may have resulted from what
Cunther called "the opposing tensions" of
conservatism and judicial restraint.
When he was campaigning for the
presidency in 1968, Nixon made it clear
that he intended to remold the face of a
high Court which he viewed as overly
activist and permissive. In large part,
observers here agree that he succeeded.
But, as Cunther noted, the new Court is
caught in a quandary. "It is reluctant to
take new steps but it is also more reluctant
to overturn precedent." Essentially, then,
the Court is stuck with the interpretation
given to the Constitution at the end of the
Warren era — and that is a decidedly
activist interpretation.
