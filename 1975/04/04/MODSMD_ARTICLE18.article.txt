# Vietnamese Await Invasion Of Saigon
## 
### 
SAIGON, South Vietnam (AF)
— The sound of gunfire, exploding
grenades and artillery echoed
through the streets of Saigon, but
no one took any notice.
"It's only government
propaganda," a Vietnamese
reassured a nervous foreigner and
pointed to loudspeakers tied to
lamp posts in Lam Don Square.
The speakers blare continuous
exhortations for the population to
resist the Communists and boast
with sound effects of government
forces heroically defending Hue
and Da Nang.
Everyone knows the army
hasn't fought; that Hue, Da Nang
and a dozen other cities have been
lost, and that the Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese are pushing
closer to the capital.
'Nowhere To Go'
"We have nowhere to go now,"
said Mai-linh, a beautiful young
bar girl, with a shrug. "Where
can we go? I am frightened, but
what can I do? I have bought rice
and dried fish and when the VC
come I will lock the doors and
wait."
Although there have been some
signs of fright and flight, most of
Saigon's three-and-a-half million
people seem to be facing up to the
inevitable.
Their greatest fear seems not to
be the North Vietnameseand Viet
Cong forces less than 50
miles away. It's that armed,
defeated, embittered government
troops will run amok in the city.
Anarchy Possible
Law and order may
disintegrate as it did in Hue, Da
Nang and Nha Trang. Government
officials and army officers may
desert, leaving anarchy behind
them.
At the moment there is little to
show on the surface that Saigon is
mortally threatened. But rice is
short, and going up in price. Tea is
hard to get. So is coffee. Tea and
coffee came from the Central

Highlands town of Ban Me Thuot,
which fell more than two weeks
ago. Avocados, once a plentiful
delicacy from Dalat, are now hard
to find. The highway to Dalat was
cut several weeks ago.
The bakeries are still turning
out French bread. Rather
ordinary French wine is still
available, but the quantity is
decreasing. The North Vietnamese
and not Saigon's gourmets are
now enjoying Nha Trang's famous
lobsters.
It is still possible to eat well in
the French style at such
restaurants as Ramuntcho's. But
the waiters hustle you through
your meal to get the bill paid by
9:30 p.m.. — curfew is at 10 p.m.
War Comes Closer
The open-air terrace at the
Continental Palace Hotel, better
known as the Continental Shelf,
remains a favorite sundown
drinking place.
The nightly army of pimps,
prostitutes, beggars, urchins,
crippled war veterans and
newspaper vendors still prowls the
sidewalk alongside.
But there are signs that the war
is coming closer.
New bunkers and pillboxes are
being constructed on street
corners, notably near the
presidential palace.
The traditionally superstitious
Vietnamese are patronizing
soothsayers, pagodas and churches
in increasing numbers.
The 6000 Americans and
possibly as many Europeans who
were in Saigon are seen less
frequently on the streets.
Although there has been no overt
anti-Americanism, many expect it
will come.
Many Vietnamese, particularly
refugees from the northern
provinces, feel the United States
abandoned them.
