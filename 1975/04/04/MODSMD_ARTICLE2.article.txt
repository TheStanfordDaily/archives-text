# Teaching Award Panel Debates Selection Bias
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
Students and faculty who have
served on the selection panel for the
University's most prestigious awards
for teaching excellence disagree on
whether their decisions have been
biased in favor of older, conservative
teachers.
The panel, a subcommittee of the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA), annually
selects two students and two faculty
members for the Lloyd Dinkelspiel
Award for outstanding service to
undergraduate education. It also
chooses a junior and senior professor
and a teaching assistant to receive the
Walter J. Gores Award and a money
prize given at commencement.
Former student members of the
selection panel claim that because the
group contains several returning
members as well as actual recipients of
the award, it has become a
self-perpetuating body.
Faculty on the subcommittee
disagreed, but some of them expressed
mild surprise when informed how
many award winners weie selected for
last year's and the present panel.
Three of the six voting faculty on
last year's subcommittee wpre winners,
and one of the five non-voting faculty
and administrators also had won the
award.
Two Students
The panel also includes two
students, one an undergraduate.
A list of this year's panel obtained
from one of its members reveals that
at least three of the six voting faculty
are previous winners.
Physics Prof. Alexander Fetter,
winner of last year's senior Gores
Award and chairman of the C-AAA
this year, said that his committee
didn't make an effort to overload the
awards committee with past winners.
"We try hard to get people from
different constituencies," he said.
Fetter added that he had been

asked to serve on this year's awards
committee but declined because he
didn't have enough time.
Geology Prof. Irwin Remson,
chairman of the awards panel last year,
said that previous award winners often
become members of the group because
they are the people most willing to
serve on it. Many faculty won't accept
positions on the pane! because of the
time commitment, Remson said.
"If I went to the phone and got a
positive response from everyone I
called, then it wouldn't have as many
old recipients," he said.
