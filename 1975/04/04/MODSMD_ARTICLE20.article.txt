## Solid Rock Shows Entertain Winterland Crowds 
### JOAN E. HINMAN MICHELE FARRAR 
SAN FRANCISCO - Young
Peter Frampton, who got his start
in rock music as lead guitarist for
Humble Pie in his teens, rendered
a superb performance at
Winterland two weeks ago.
Exuding an eager, though
somewhat self-conscious, stage
presence, he greeted the capacity
crowd. Frampton's conservatively
well-tailored clothes contrasted
with his long, shagged blond hair.
The set consisted of equally
long cuts from Frampton's three
previously successful albums
(Wind Of Change, Something's
Happening and Frampton's
Camel) and his newest, simply
entitled Frampton. Although
Frampton has said that his latest
work pleases him the most, he did
not attempt to hard-sell it.
Probably because Frampton
has not released any AM singles
and Bill Graham's SNACK fest
drew off much of the obnoxious
hard core of Winterland-goers, the
crowd was genuinely familiar with
his music: more spirited clapping
than the usual abject screaming
was evident throughout the set.
Acoustic Two
During two numbers, "Wind of
Change" and "All I Want to Be,"
when Frampton pulled out an
acoustic guitar and performed
solo, the audience stood silently
absorbed in Frampton's sincere,

determined singing. He appeared
almost surprised yet pleased by
such devotion.
The rest of the set was electric.
When Frampton gets both
dextrous hands on an electric
guitar and starts jumping up and
down, the riffs come out soaring,
searching, and always innovative,
while his upper lip rises and his
nostrils flare in a concerted effort.
The stinging, bad guitar lead on
"Plain Shame" fit perfectly with
Frampton's lyrics about a
demanding woman:
"She said: 7 know it's late, too
But Fd really like to play tunes
On your guitar
Let's get arrested
Wanna be molested
Who cares how old you are!'
It's a plain shame
It took me so long to learn "
John Siomos on drums and
Andrew Brown on Fender bass
ground out a complex rhythm
back-up without confusing the
clean, simple lines of Frampton's
lead.
Rare Glances
Rarely glancing at his hands,
Frampton's facial expressions and
manual gestures lent novel
emphasis to his lyrics. His
no-holds-barred showmanship
created a truly entertaining
experience for all present.
One senses Frampton's humble
attitude towards his music, as he

seems a little awed by his own
youth and stardom. It is
refreshing to find such qualities in
such a talented composer,
musician and vocalist.
The British group Man featured
guitarists Deke Leonard and
Mickey Jones battling for leads
which droned on endlessly
throughout the set. "Come On," a
typical Man number, began with
eerie, disjointed snatches of guitar
and synthesizer interplay, sagged
in the middle with vocals closely
resembling a pack of howling
coyotes, and tumbled to a crash
landing laden with synthesizer
junk.
Unfortunately, a number of
current rock groups use the
synthesizer like a toy, fiddling
with the buttons and dials to
produce the most weird and
shattering noise effects they can
muster. Due to the instrument's
overuse and misuse, synthesizer
solos are rapidly approaching a
state of monotony previously
achieved only by poor drum solos.
Third-billed Babe Ruth's lead
singer jerks fitfully around the
stage (mostly pelvic thrusts),
delivering screeching vocals.
Once agian, dials were twisted
on the synthesizer and the result
was passed off as "music," while
the drummer, a veteran of the
Shotgun School of Drumming, hit
everything as fast and as hard as
humanly possible. The excitement
Babe Ruth attempts to conjure up
diminishes after the first ten
minutes.

SAN FRANCISCO—You
probably haven't heard of a flashy
singer named Freddie Mercury or
a hot guitarist named Dave
Meniketti — or their bands, Queen
and Yesterday & Today.
Nonetheless, those bands
showed a Winterland crowd the
finer nuances of the term "hard
rock" in two amazing sets
Sunday.
Yesterday & Today, an
incredibly talented young East
Bay band, opened the show with

perhaps its most dazzling set to
date. Commanding two encores —
more than the headline bands —
Yesterday & Today combined
driving instrumentation with
excellent vocals to lay out nearly
an hour of fine rock.
Lead guitarist Meniketti is
frighteningly fast — his work is
perhaps the band's central force.
Emerging as one of the Bay's
premiere guitarists, Meniketti is
also an excellent vocalist
reminiscent of the Guess Who's
Burt Cummings.

Joining Meniketti on vocals is
bassist Phil Kennemore.
Kennemore composed
"Stargazer," a song which
demonstrates Yesterday &
Today's ability to transfer
instantaneously from perfect
vocal harmony and lyric guitar to
screeching, biting rock.
Supported by rhythm guitarist
Joey Alves and drummer Leonard
Haze, Meniketti and Kennemore
were working well together
Sunday, drawing off the energy of
an extremely responsive audience.
Yesterday & Today earned
its two encores easily with the
basic hard rock sparked by
delicate harmony and guitar that
makes the band more successful
musically than many famous hard
rock stars who still think"loud"
means "good."
Bad Case
A case in point might be
Mahogany Rush, the band which
followed Yesterday & Today.
Mahogany's sole claim to fame is a
lead guitarist who fancies himself
to be the Great White Hendrix,
playing the late Jimi's tunes right
down to "The Star-Spangled
Banner" backed by strobe lights.
Unfortunately, Mahogany Rush
was loud enough to send this
reviewer off to seek safety in the
lobby. The ultimate Rush tragedy
is the nonchalance with which
it is cashing in on the memory
and originality of a truly
revolutionary, truly immortal
musician.
Quite easily one of the best
things out of England since The
Who, Queen finally took the stage
amid clouds of smoke and flashes
of light. It proceeded with a
slick, sophisticated set
characteristic of only the very
best and the very British.
Freddie Mercury, a relatively
unknown lead singer, fits the
middle ground between the bad
boy sexuality of Mick Jagger and
the messianic, squeeky-clean
rebelliousness of Roger Daltrey.
More handsome than either Jagger

or Daltrey and nearly Daltrey's
match vocally, Mercury took
absolute command of his
audience, talking to them with a
kind of casual grandeur and utter
self-assuredness.
Bizarre Guitar
Queen's material centers
around very innovative hard rock
featuring Mercury's keyboard
work and the extremely bizarre
guitar of Brian May. During "Son
and Daughter," from the band's
first album. May spent several
minutes on stage alone literally
playing harmonies with himself
through the aid of a couple of
echoplexes and some other
electronic madness.
The sound achieved is
absolutely unique, incomparable
with anything else. It is through
this guitar sound that Queen has
found it necessary to label each of
its albums with the warning
"and nobody played synthesizer."
The electronic wizardry, however,
makes it impossible to judge
exactly how accomplished a
musician May is san.« transistors.
Dropping down to gentle
ballads like "White Queen" only
occasionally, Queen essentially
stayed with songs such as "Keep
Yourself Alive" and "Liar" from
its first album, and "Ogre
Battle" and "Father To Son"
from Queen 11, playing only a
relatively brief medley from its
third album.
Ultimately successful because
of a skillfully staged set and its
own showmanship, Queen
concluded with an encore that ran
the gamut from "Hey, Big
Spender" from Sweet Charity
through its cv/n "Modern Times
Rock 'n' Roll" to "Jailhouse
Rock" and "Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin On."
Completely tight musically,
highly original, and flashy without
being trashy, Queen deserves a
place — a well-acknowledged place
— as one of England's truly
outstanding bands.

SAN FRANCISCO - Young
Peter Frampton, who got his start
in rock music as lead guitarist for
Humble Pie in his teens, rendered
a superb performance at
Winterland two weeks ago.
Exuding an eager, though
somewhat self-conscious, stage
presence, he greeted the capacity
crowd. Frampton's conservatively
well-tailored clothes contrasted
with his long, shagged blond hair.
The set consisted of equally
long cuts from Frampton's three
previously successful albums
(Wind Of Change, Something's
Happening and Frampton's
Camel) and his newest, simply
entitled Frampton. Although
Frampton has said that his latest
work pleases him the most, he did
not attempt to hard-sell it.
Probably because Frampton
has not released any AM singles
and Bill Graham's SNACK fest
drew off much of the obnoxious
hard core of Winterland-goers, the
crowd was genuinely familiar with
his music: more spirited clapping
than the usual abject screaming
was evident throughout the set.
Acoustic Two
During two numbers, "Wind of
Change" and "All I Want to Be,"
when Frampton pulled out an
acoustic guitar and performed
solo, the audience stood silently
absorbed in Frampton's sincere,

determined singing. He appeared
almost surprised yet pleased by
such devotion.
The rest of the set was electric.
When Frampton gets both
dextrous hands on an electric
guitar and starts jumping up and
down, the riffs come out soaring,
searching, and always innovative,
while his upper lip rises and his
nostrils flare in a concerted effort.
The stinging, bad guitar lead on
"Plain Shame" fit perfectly with
Frampton's lyrics about a
demanding woman:
"She said: 7 know it's late, too
But Fd really like to play tunes
On your guitar
Let's get arrested
Wanna be molested
Who cares how old you are!'
It's a plain shame
It took me so long to learn "
John Siomos on drums and
Andrew Brown on Fender bass
ground out a complex rhythm
back-up without confusing the
clean, simple lines of Frampton's
lead.
Rare Glances
Rarely glancing at his hands,
Frampton's facial expressions and
manual gestures lent novel
emphasis to his lyrics. His
no-holds-barred showmanship
created a truly entertaining
experience for all present.
One senses Frampton's humble
attitude towards his music, as he

seems a little awed by his own
youth and stardom. It is
refreshing to find such qualities in
such a talented composer,
musician and vocalist.
The British group Man featured
guitarists Deke Leonard and
Mickey Jones battling for leads
which droned on endlessly
throughout the set. "Come On," a
typical Man number, began with
eerie, disjointed snatches of guitar
and synthesizer interplay, sagged
in the middle with vocals closely
resembling a pack of howling
coyotes, and tumbled to a crash
landing laden with synthesizer
junk.
Unfortunately, a number of
current rock groups use the
synthesizer like a toy, fiddling
with the buttons and dials to
produce the most weird and
shattering noise effects they can
muster. Due to the instrument's
overuse and misuse, synthesizer
solos are rapidly approaching a
state of monotony previously
achieved only by poor drum solos.
Third-billed Babe Ruth's lead
singer jerks fitfully around the
stage (mostly pelvic thrusts),
delivering screeching vocals.
Once agian, dials were twisted
on the synthesizer and the result
was passed off as "music," while
the drummer, a veteran of the
Shotgun School of Drumming, hit
everything as fast and as hard as
humanly possible. The excitement
Babe Ruth attempts to conjure up
diminishes after the first ten
minutes.

SAN FRANCISCO—You
probably haven't heard of a flashy
singer named Freddie Mercury or
a hot guitarist named Dave
Meniketti — or their bands, Queen
and Yesterday & Today.
Nonetheless, those bands
showed a Winterland crowd the
finer nuances of the term "hard
rock" in two amazing sets
Sunday.
Yesterday & Today, an
incredibly talented young East
Bay band, opened the show with

perhaps its most dazzling set to
date. Commanding two encores —
more than the headline bands —
Yesterday & Today combined
driving instrumentation with
excellent vocals to lay out nearly
an hour of fine rock.
Lead guitarist Meniketti is
frighteningly fast — his work is
perhaps the band's central force.
Emerging as one of the Bay's
premiere guitarists, Meniketti is
also an excellent vocalist
reminiscent of the Guess Who's
Burt Cummings.

Joining Meniketti on vocals is
bassist Phil Kennemore.
Kennemore composed
"Stargazer," a song which
demonstrates Yesterday &
Today's ability to transfer
instantaneously from perfect
vocal harmony and lyric guitar to
screeching, biting rock.
Supported by rhythm guitarist
Joey Alves and drummer Leonard
Haze, Meniketti and Kennemore
were working well together
Sunday, drawing off the energy of
an extremely responsive audience.
Yesterday & Today earned
its two encores easily with the
basic hard rock sparked by
delicate harmony and guitar that
makes the band more successful
musically than many famous hard
rock stars who still think"loud"
means "good."
Bad Case
A case in point might be
Mahogany Rush, the band which
followed Yesterday & Today.
Mahogany's sole claim to fame is a
lead guitarist who fancies himself
to be the Great White Hendrix,
playing the late Jimi's tunes right
down to "The Star-Spangled
Banner" backed by strobe lights.
Unfortunately, Mahogany Rush
was loud enough to send this
reviewer off to seek safety in the
lobby. The ultimate Rush tragedy
is the nonchalance with which
it is cashing in on the memory
and originality of a truly
revolutionary, truly immortal
musician.
Quite easily one of the best
things out of England since The
Who, Queen finally took the stage
amid clouds of smoke and flashes
of light. It proceeded with a
slick, sophisticated set
characteristic of only the very
best and the very British.
Freddie Mercury, a relatively
unknown lead singer, fits the
middle ground between the bad
boy sexuality of Mick Jagger and
the messianic, squeeky-clean
rebelliousness of Roger Daltrey.
More handsome than either Jagger

or Daltrey and nearly Daltrey's
match vocally, Mercury took
absolute command of his
audience, talking to them with a
kind of casual grandeur and utter
self-assuredness.
Bizarre Guitar
Queen's material centers
around very innovative hard rock
featuring Mercury's keyboard
work and the extremely bizarre
guitar of Brian May. During "Son
and Daughter," from the band's
first album. May spent several
minutes on stage alone literally
playing harmonies with himself
through the aid of a couple of
echoplexes and some other
electronic madness.
The sound achieved is

The sound achieved is
absolutely unique, incomparable

found it necessary to label each of

SAN FRANCISCO - Young
Peter Frampton, who got his start
in rock music as lead guitarist for
Humble Pie in his teens, rendered
a superb performance at
Winterland two weeks ago.
Exuding an eager, though
somewhat self-conscious, stage
presence, he greeted the capacity
crowd. Frampton's conservatively
well-tailored clothes contrasted
with his long, shagged blond hair.
The set consisted of equally
long cuts from Frampton's three
previously successful albums
(Wind Of Change, Something's
Happening and Frampton's
Camel) and his newest, simply
entitled Frampton. Although
Frampton has said that his latest
work pleases him the most, he did
not attempt to hard-sell it.
Probably because Frampton
has not released any AM singles
and Bill Graham's SNACK fest
drew off much of the obnoxious
hard core of Winterland-goers, the
crowd was genuinely familiar with
his music: more spirited clapping
than the usual abject screaming
was evident throughout the set.
Acoustic Two
During two numbers, "Wind of
Change" and "All I Want to Be,"
when Frampton pulled out an
acoustic guitar and performed
solo, the audience stood silently
absorbed in Frampton's sincere,

determined singing. He appeared
almost surprised yet pleased by
such devotion.
The rest of the set was electric.
When Frampton gets both
dextrous hands on an electric
guitar and starts jumping up and
down, the riffs come out soaring,
searching, and always innovative,
while his upper lip rises and his
nostrils flare in a concerted effort.
The stinging, bad guitar lead on
"Plain Shame" fit perfectly with
Frampton's lyrics about a
demanding woman:
"She said: 7 know it's late, too
But Fd really like to play tunes
On your guitar
Let's get arrested
Wanna be molested
Who cares how old you are!'
It's a plain shame
It took me so long to learn "
John Siomos on drums and
Andrew Brown on Fender bass
ground out a complex rhythm
back-up without confusing the
clean, simple lines of Frampton's
lead.
Rare Glances
Rarely glancing at his hands,
Frampton's facial expressions and
manual gestures lent novel
emphasis to his lyrics. His
no-holds-barred showmanship
created a truly entertaining
experience for all present.
One senses Frampton's humble
attitude towards his music, as he

seems a little awed by his own
youth and stardom. It is
refreshing to find such qualities in
such a talented composer,
musician and vocalist.
The British group Man featured
guitarists Deke Leonard and
Mickey Jones battling for leads
which droned on endlessly
throughout the set. "Come On," a
typical Man number, began with
eerie, disjointed snatches of guitar
and synthesizer interplay, sagged
in the middle with vocals closely
resembling a pack of howling
coyotes, and tumbled to a crash
landing laden with synthesizer
junk.
Unfortunately, a number of
current rock groups use the
synthesizer like a toy, fiddling
with the buttons and dials to
produce the most weird and
shattering noise effects they can
muster. Due to the instrument's
overuse and misuse, synthesizer
solos are rapidly approaching a
state of monotony previously
achieved only by poor drum solos.
Third-billed Babe Ruth's lead
singer jerks fitfully around the
stage (mostly pelvic thrusts),
delivering screeching vocals.
Once agian, dials were twisted
on the synthesizer and the result
was passed off as "music," while
the drummer, a veteran of the
Shotgun School of Drumming, hit
everything as fast and as hard as
humanly possible. The excitement
Babe Ruth attempts to conjure up
diminishes after the first ten
minutes.

SAN FRANCISCO—You
probably haven't heard of a flashy
singer named Freddie Mercury or
a hot guitarist named Dave
Meniketti — or their bands, Queen
and Yesterday & Today.
Nonetheless, those bands
showed a Winterland crowd the
finer nuances of the term "hard
rock" in two amazing sets
Sunday.
Yesterday & Today, an
incredibly talented young East
Bay band, opened the show with

perhaps its most dazzling set to
date. Commanding two encores —
more than the headline bands —
Yesterday & Today combined
driving instrumentation with
excellent vocals to lay out nearly
an hour of fine rock.
Lead guitarist Meniketti is
frighteningly fast — his work is
perhaps the band's central force.
Emerging as one of the Bay's
premiere guitarists, Meniketti is
also an excellent vocalist
reminiscent of the Guess Who's
Burt Cummings.

Joining Meniketti on vocals is
bassist Phil Kennemore.
Kennemore composed
"Stargazer," a song which
demonstrates Yesterday &
Today's ability to transfer
instantaneously from perfect
vocal harmony and lyric guitar to
screeching, biting rock.
Supported by rhythm guitarist
Joey Alves and drummer Leonard
Haze, Meniketti and Kennemore
were working well together
Sunday, drawing off the energy of
an extremely responsive audience.
Yesterday & Today earned

SAN FRANCISCO—You
probably haven't heard of a flashy
singer named Freddie Mercury or
a hot guitarist named Dave
Meniketti — or their bands, Queen
and Yesterday & Today.
Nonetheless, those bands
showed a Winterland crowd the
finer nuances of the term "hard
rock" in two amazing sets
Sunday.
Yesterday & Today, an
incredibly talented young East
Bay band, opened the show with

perhaps its most dazzling set to
date. Commanding two encores —
more than the headline bands —
Yesterday & Today combined
driving instrumentation with
excellent vocals to lay out nearly
an hour of fine rock.
Lead guitarist Meniketti is
frighteningly fast — his work is
perhaps the band's central force.
Emerging as one of the Bay's
premiere guitarists, Meniketti is
also an excellent vocalist
reminiscent of the Guess Who's
Burt Cummings.

Joining Meniketti on vocals is
bassist Phil Kennemore.
Kennemore composed
"Stargazer," a song which
demonstrates Yesterday &
Today's ability to transfer
instantaneously from perfect
vocal harmony and lyric guitar to
screeching, biting rock.
Supported by rhythm guitarist
Joey Alves and drummer Leonard
Haze, Meniketti and Kennemore
were working well together
Sunday, drawing off the energy of
an extremely responsive audience.
Yesterday & Today earned
its two encores easily with the
basic hard rock sparked by
delicate harmony and guitar that
makes the band more successful
musically than many famous hard
rock stars who still think"loud"
means "good."
Bad Case
A case in point might be
Mahogany Rush, the band which
followed Yesterday & Today.
Mahogany's sole claim to fame is a
lead guitarist who fancies himself
to be the Great White Hendrix,
playing the late Jimi's tunes right
down to "The Star-Spangled
Banner" backed by strobe lights.
Unfortunately, Mahogany Rush
was loud enough to send this
reviewer off to seek safety in the
lobby. The ultimate Rush tragedy
is the nonchalance with which
it is cashing in on the memory
and originality of a truly
revolutionary, truly immortal
musician.
Quite easily one of the best
things out of England since The
Who, Queen finally took the stage
amid clouds of smoke and flashes
of light. It proceeded with a
slick, sophisticated set
characteristic of only the very
best and the very British.
Freddie Mercury, a relatively
unknown lead singer, fits the
middle ground between the bad
boy sexuality of Mick Jagger and
the messianic, squeeky-clean
rebelliousness of Roger Daltrey.
More handsome than either Jagger

or Daltrey and nearly Daltrey's
match vocally, Mercury took
absolute command of his
audience, talking to them with a
kind of casual grandeur and utter
self-assuredness.
Bizarre Guitar
Queen's material centers
around very innovative hard rock
featuring Mercury's keyboard
work and the extremely bizarre
guitar of Brian May. During "Son
and Daughter," from the band's
first album. May spent several
minutes on stage alone literally
playing harmonies with himself
through the aid of a couple of
echoplexes and some other
electronic madness.
The sound achieved is
absolutely unique, incomparable
with anything else. It is through
this guitar sound that Queen has
found it necessary to label each of
its albums with the warning
"and nobody played synthesizer."
The electronic wizardry, however,
makes it impossible to judge
exactly how accomplished a
musician May is san.« transistors.
Dropping down to gentle
ballads like "White Queen" only
occasionally, Queen essentially
stayed with songs such as "Keep
Yourself Alive" and "Liar" from
its first album, and "Ogre
Battle" and "Father To Son"
from Queen 11, playing only a
relatively brief medley from its
third album.
Ultimately successful because
of a skillfully staged set and its
own showmanship, Queen
concluded with an encore that ran
the gamut from "Hey, Big
Spender" from Sweet Charity
through its cv/n "Modern Times
Rock 'n' Roll" to "Jailhouse
Rock" and "Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin On."
Completely tight musically,
highly original, and flashy without
being trashy, Queen deserves a
place — a well-acknowledged place
— as one of England's truly
outstanding bands.

SAN FRANCISCO - Young
Peter Frampton, who got his start
in rock music as lead guitarist for
Humble Pie in his teens, rendered
a superb performance at
Winterland two weeks ago.
Exuding an eager, though
somewhat self-conscious, stage
presence, he greeted the capacity
crowd. Frampton's conservatively
well-tailored clothes contrasted
with his long, shagged blond hair.
The set consisted of equally
long cuts from Frampton's three
previously successful albums
(Wind Of Change, Something's
Happening and Frampton's
Camel) and his newest, simply
entitled Frampton. Although
Frampton has said that his latest
work pleases him the most, he did
not attempt to hard-sell it.
Probably because Frampton
has not released any AM singles
and Bill Graham's SNACK fest
drew off much of the obnoxious
hard core of Winterland-goers, the
crowd was genuinely familiar with
his music: more spirited clapping
than the usual abject screaming
was evident throughout the set.
Acoustic Two
During two numbers, "Wind of
Change" and "All I Want to Be,"
when Frampton pulled out an
acoustic guitar and performed
solo, the audience stood silently
absorbed in Frampton's sincere,

determined singing. He appeared
almost surprised yet pleased by
such devotion.
The rest of the set was electric.
When Frampton gets both
dextrous hands on an electric
guitar and starts jumping up and
down, the riffs come out soaring,
searching, and always innovative,
while his upper lip rises and his
nostrils flare in a concerted effort.
The stinging, bad guitar lead on
"Plain Shame" fit perfectly with
Frampton's lyrics about a
demanding woman:
"She said: 7 know it's late, too
But Fd really like to play tunes
On your guitar
Let's get arrested
Wanna be molested
Who cares how old you are!'
It's a plain shame
It took me so long to learn "
John Siomos on drums and
Andrew Brown on Fender bass
ground out a complex rhythm
back-up without confusing the
clean, simple lines of Frampton's
lead.
Rare Glances
Rarely glancing at his hands,
Frampton's facial expressions and
manual gestures lent novel
emphasis to his lyrics. His
no-holds-barred showmanship
created a truly entertaining
experience for all present.
One senses Frampton's humble
attitude towards his music, as he

seems a little awed by his own
youth and stardom. It is
refreshing to find such qualities in
such a talented composer,
musician and vocalist.
The British group Man featured
guitarists Deke Leonard and
Mickey Jones battling for leads
which droned on endlessly
throughout the set. "Come On," a
typical Man number, began with
eerie, disjointed snatches of guitar
and synthesizer interplay, sagged
in the middle with vocals closely
resembling a pack of howling
coyotes, and tumbled to a crash
landing laden with synthesizer
junk.
Unfortunately, a number of
current rock groups use the
synthesizer like a toy, fiddling
with the buttons and dials to
produce the most weird and
shattering noise effects they can
muster. Due to the instrument's
overuse and misuse, synthesizer
solos are rapidly approaching a
state of monotony previously
achieved only by poor drum solos.
Third-billed Babe Ruth's lead
singer jerks fitfully around the
stage (mostly pelvic thrusts),
delivering screeching vocals.
Once agian, dials were twisted
on the synthesizer and the result
was passed off as "music," while
the drummer, a veteran of the
Shotgun School of Drumming, hit
everything as fast and as hard as
humanly possible. The excitement
Babe Ruth attempts to conjure up
diminishes after the first ten
minutes.
