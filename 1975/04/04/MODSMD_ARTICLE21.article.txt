# Movies: Hollywood Musters Two Cheery Comedies
## 
### 
At the risk of prematurely
spotting a trend, I think there's
one on the horizon that definitely
confirms that we are in the midst
of an economic recession, as if
that weren't apparent already.
Hollywood has this soothing
habit of coming out with movies
that have happy endings for a
change, where the characters end
up a little happier or a little more
content than when we first met
them, rather than leaving the
audience with a heavy feeling of
depression as when Faye
Dunaway gets shot just when she's
about to get away.
This trend moves back to
comedies, to make us forget all
our problems. There are few
things worse than a movie that is
supposed to be a comedy and fails
miserably to elicit laughs
Freebie and the Bean, for
example. However, now you can
be treated to two comedies that
are actually funny.
First up is Rafferty and the
Gold Dust Twins (which,
unfortunately, has to be
pronounced very precisely, or it
comes out like "Goldustwins,"
which is not yet a recognizable
English word), continuing in the
tradition of Harry and Tonto, a
1970s road picture, in which, due
to circumstances beyond the
characters' control, they set off
on a cross-country trek.
Weird Bunch
This affords the opportunity to
meet all sorts of interesting and
weird characters in order to show
what a diverse country America is
and how it will survive anyway
because it has solid, humorous
people giving it a solid backbone.
Rafferty is no different, except
that it is funnier than average, and
populated with con men (and
women) that will steal away your
laughter.
We are introduced to
Rafferty's thrilling existence at a
Marine veterans' party (Rafferty
was a lifer) where he passes out,
waking up to a breakfast of beer
and potato chips and his mundane
job at the Department of Motor
Vehicles (you wouldn't know it

from the way he drives— somewhat
like Steve McQueen would under
heavy sedation), an existence
Rafferty logically is not endeared
to.
Two wackos he meets on his
lunch break (MacKenzie Phillips,
13-year-old Carol in American
Graffiti, as Frisbee, and Sally
Ke Herman, as MacKinley
Beechwood or Big Mac) kidnap
him in his "alleged" car ("I never
saw no white man drive a car like
this," says Big Mac).
On To Orleans
They order him to drive them
to New Orleans so that Big Mac
can get a singing job in the
nightclub Frisbee's father owns
(coincidentally, Sally Kellerman
also wants to be a singer, and she
gives us an idea of her capabilities
— unfortunately).
They're off, and they proceed
to Las Vegas, meeting the
strangest people, conning the
hicks, making their getaway and
having a jolly-good time. It would
not do justice to the movie to
relate all of the sparkling scenes in
it, but they were all enjoyable,
paced well, and altogether it was a
perfect piece of entertainment.
It plays on the audience's envy.
When Big Mac and Frisbee kidnaD
Rafferty, we secretly wish
someone would come along and
take us away from our daily
drudgeries. We are collectively
envious of Rafferty, especially
when, after his escape, he chooses
to return to his captors, since he
has nothing to return to in Los
Angeles anyway (does anyone?).
Giant Steps
Alan Arkin takes a giant step
out of his career slump with his
portrayal of Rafferty, proving
himself a great comedian and
actor, reaching all the way back to
The Russians Are Coming.
MacKenzie Phillips is splendid as
the snide Frisbee (that's her name
this week — next week it'll oe
different), who is a writer (all
writers are strange to begin with)
and has a lot to learn.
Unfortunately, there is also
Sally Kellerman, who may be the
most overrated talent of the

19705. She has but one
performance in every movie —
drop in a quarter, and you get
Neurotic.
She was a neurotic nurse in
M*A*S*H*, a neurotic Newsweek
correspondent in Lost Horizon,
and a neurotic thief in Slither.
Here she's a neurotic loner, very
closely resembling Lennie in Of
Mice And Men, being led around
by a loving but tyrannical Frisbee.
Strong Support
In the supporting performances
are Alex Rocco (Arkin's
befuddled superior in Freebie),
turning in another gem of a
comedy routine worthy of higher
billing, as Vinnie, who has his own
unique way of beating a
restaurant check (set fire to the
tablecloth), and Charlie Martin
Smith (also of American Graffiti)
as the soldier Frisbee rolls.
If Rafferty shows that America
is full of diverse types, then The
Prisoner of Second Avenue shows
New York as a microcosm of
America with many unusual
people squeezed into one tiny
space. A normal person has no
chance to survive there, and the
movies and television utilize New
York mercilessly as the center of
crime and anarchy.
Little Man
Prisoner adds to this image,
except that it shows the plight of
the little man — the victim, for a
change, rather than the fumbling
police or the kingpins of the
underworld. It is a refreshing
change and a funny one as well.
Contrasting completely at least
in terms of setting, Prisoner is an
equally enjoyable movie. While
Rafferty takes place on the roads
of the Southwest, Prisoner takes
place mostly in the Edison
apartment in New York, with
occasional scenes in Central Park,
Connecticut, and the streets of
New York.
This confinement is to be
expected, since the movie was
taken from Neil Simon's
Broadway play, and it is hard (and
often unsuccessfully done) to take
a story from a set and spread it all
over a city. Simon's play
prophesies today's economic
crises, so that it is extraordinarily
contemporary.

It is good to have Jack
Lemmon back as the great comic
actor he is. After a string of duds
(Avanti, for one), his masterpiece
Save The Tiger rescued him to
give us this and The Front Page.
Here again we have the talent so
evident in Some Like It Hot as he
plays the beleagured Mel Edison,
your typical New Yorker
imprisoned at the corner of
Second Avenue and 88th Street.
As usual, Simon is the king of
the one-liner (Mel comes into the
apartment dazed and fails to see
that they've been robbed, and
after his realisation he asks his
wife, "Didn't Mildred come in to
clean today?").
He sweetens up New York's
usual grim picture as Edison loses
his job, has a nervous breakdown,
and is forced to change roles with
his wife, Edna.
Eventually, Mel goes crazy
doing nothing and Edna goes
crazy trying to live with him.
As the movie chronicles each
one's decline into lunacy and
ascent into sanity, we are treated
to Lemmon and to Anne
Bancroft, who only works on
screen occasionally and prefers to
work with quality.
She, too, gives a wonderfully
funny performance as Edna,
slightly dumb but always willing
to please. The Prisoner of Second
Avenue was directed by Melvin
Frank, who also did A Touch Of
Class. While this is not quite up to
Class it is a wonderful movie that
will certainly — if Death Wish and
Report To The Commissioner
haven't already —convince you to
stay the hell out of New York if
you value your life and your
sanity.
So often movies about the
perils of living laced with comedy
become too sad to handle.
Fortunately, Prisoner always
manages to keep an optimistic eye
out, all the way to the final scene
when the Edisons realize they will
not leave New York without a
fight, and that the only way to
survive is to join the inmates that
have taken over the asylum and be
as crazy as their neighbors.

plays the beleagured Mel Edison,
your typical New Yorker

the one-liner (Mel comes into the

after his realisation he asks his

He sweetens up New York's
usual grim picture as Edison loses

So often movies about the

THE SINGING NUT—Sally Kellerman, who says she'd like to be a singer, plays a neurotic who (surprise!)
wants to be a singer in the new film Rafferty and the Gold Dust Tivins. Although she doesn't fare too
well, according to critic Howard Baldwin, the movie is a pleasant success, due largely to the acting of Alan
Arkin (right).
At the risk of prematurely
spotting a trend, I think there's
one on the horizon that definitely
confirms that we are in the midst
of an economic recession, as if
that weren't apparent already.
Hollywood has this soothing
habit of coming out with movies
that have happy endings for a
change, where the characters end
up a little happier or a little more
content than when we first met
them, rather than leaving the
audience with a heavy feeling of
depression as when Faye
Dunaway gets shot just when she's
about to get away.
This trend moves back to
comedies, to make us forget all
our problems. There are few
things worse than a movie that is
supposed to be a comedy and fails
miserably to elicit laughs
Freebie and the Bean, for
example. However, now you can
be treated to two comedies that
are actually funny.
First up is Rafferty and the
Gold Dust Twins (which,
unfortunately, has to be
pronounced very precisely, or it
comes out like "Goldustwins,"
which is not yet a recognizable
English word), continuing in the
tradition of Harry and Tonto, a
1970s road picture, in which, due
to circumstances beyond the
characters' control, they set off
on a cross-country trek.
Weird Bunch
This affords the opportunity to
meet all sorts of interesting and
weird characters in order to show
what a diverse country America is
and how it will survive anyway
because it has solid, humorous
people giving it a solid backbone.
Rafferty is no different, except
that it is funnier than average, and
populated with con men (and
women) that will steal away your
laughter.
We are introduced to
Rafferty's thrilling existence at a
Marine veterans' party (Rafferty
was a lifer) where he passes out,
waking up to a breakfast of beer
and potato chips and his mundane
job at the Department of Motor
Vehicles (you wouldn't know it

from the way he drives— somewhat
like Steve McQueen would under
heavy sedation), an existence
Rafferty logically is not endeared
to.
Two wackos he meets on his
lunch break (MacKenzie Phillips,
13-year-old Carol in American
Graffiti, as Frisbee, and Sally
Ke Herman, as MacKinley
Beechwood or Big Mac) kidnap
him in his "alleged" car ("I never
saw no white man drive a car like
this," says Big Mac).
On To Orleans
They order him to drive them
to New Orleans so that Big Mac
can get a singing job in the
nightclub Frisbee's father owns
(coincidentally, Sally Kellerman
also wants to be a singer, and she
gives us an idea of her capabilities
— unfortunately).
They're off, and they proceed
to Las Vegas, meeting the
strangest people, conning the
hicks, making their getaway and
having a jolly-good time. It would
not do justice to the movie to
relate all of the sparkling scenes in
it, but they were all enjoyable,
paced well, and altogether it was a
perfect piece of entertainment.
It plays on the audience's envy.
When Big Mac and Frisbee kidnaD
Rafferty, we secretly wish
someone would come along and
take us away from our daily
drudgeries. We are collectively
envious of Rafferty, especially
when, after his escape, he chooses
to return to his captors, since he
has nothing to return to in Los
Angeles anyway (does anyone?).
Giant Steps
Alan Arkin takes a giant step
out of his career slump with his
portrayal of Rafferty, proving
himself a great comedian and
actor, reaching all the way back to
The Russians Are Coming.
MacKenzie Phillips is splendid as
the snide Frisbee (that's her name
this week — next week it'll oe
different), who is a writer (all
writers are strange to begin with)
and has a lot to learn.
Unfortunately, there is also
Sally Kellerman, who may be the
most overrated talent of the

19705. She has but one
performance in every movie —
drop in a quarter, and you get
Neurotic.
She was a neurotic nurse in
M*A*S*H*, a neurotic Newsweek
correspondent in Lost Horizon,
and a neurotic thief in Slither.
Here she's a neurotic loner, very
closely resembling Lennie in Of
Mice And Men, being led around
by a loving but tyrannical Frisbee.
Strong Support
In the supporting performances
are Alex Rocco (Arkin's
befuddled superior in Freebie),
turning in another gem of a
comedy routine worthy of higher
billing, as Vinnie, who has his own
unique way of beating a
restaurant check (set fire to the
tablecloth), and Charlie Martin
Smith (also of American Graffiti)
as the soldier Frisbee rolls.
If Rafferty shows that America
is full of diverse types, then The
Prisoner of Second Avenue shows
New York as a microcosm of
America with many unusual
people squeezed into one tiny
space. A normal person has no
chance to survive there, and the
movies and television utilize New
York mercilessly as the center of
crime and anarchy.
Little Man
Prisoner adds to this image,
except that it shows the plight of
the little man — the victim, for a
change, rather than the fumbling
police or the kingpins of the
underworld. It is a refreshing
change and a funny one as well.
Contrasting completely at least
in terms of setting, Prisoner is an
equally enjoyable movie. While
Rafferty takes place on the roads
of the Southwest, Prisoner takes
place mostly in the Edison
apartment in New York, with
occasional scenes in Central Park,
Connecticut, and the streets of
New York.
This confinement is to be
expected, since the movie was
taken from Neil Simon's
Broadway play, and it is hard (and
often unsuccessfully done) to take
a story from a set and spread it all
over a city. Simon's play

crises, so that it is extraordinarily

When Big Mac and Frisbee kidnaD
Rafferty, we secretly wish
someone would come along and
take us away from our daily
drudgeries. We are collectively
envious of Rafferty, especially
when, after his escape, he chooses
to return to his captors, since he
has nothing to return to in Los
Angeles anyway (does anyone?).
Giant Steps
Alan Arkin takes a giant step
out of his career slump with his
portrayal of Rafferty, proving
himself a great comedian and
actor, reaching all the way back to
The Russians Are Coming.
MacKenzie Phillips is splendid as
the snide Frisbee (that's her name
this week — next week it'll oe
different), who is a writer (all
writers are strange to begin with)
and has a lot to learn.
Unfortunately, there is also
Sally Kellerman, who may be the
most overrated talent of the

19705. She has but one
performance in every movie —
drop in a quarter, and you get
Neurotic.
She was a neurotic nurse in
M*A*S*H*, a neurotic Newsweek
correspondent in Lost Horizon,
and a neurotic thief in Slither.
Here she's a neurotic loner, very
closely resembling Lennie in Of
Mice And Men, being led around
by a loving but tyrannical Frisbee.
Strong Support
In the supporting performances
are Alex Rocco (Arkin's
befuddled superior in Freebie),
turning in another gem of a
comedy routine worthy of higher
billing, as Vinnie, who has his own
unique way of beating a
restaurant check (set fire to the
tablecloth), and Charlie Martin
Smith (also of American Graffiti)
as the soldier Frisbee rolls.
If Rafferty shows that America
is full of diverse types, then The
Prisoner of Second Avenue shows
New York as a microcosm of
America with many unusual
people squeezed into one tiny
space. A normal person has no
chance to survive there, and the
movies and television utilize New
York mercilessly as the center of
crime and anarchy.
Little Man
Prisoner adds to this image,
except that it shows the plight of
the little man — the victim, for a
change, rather than the fumbling
police or the kingpins of the
underworld. It is a refreshing
change and a funny one as well.
Contrasting completely at least
in terms of setting, Prisoner is an
equally enjoyable movie. While
Rafferty takes place on the roads
of the Southwest, Prisoner takes
place mostly in the Edison
apartment in New York, with
occasional scenes in Central Park,
Connecticut, and the streets of
New York.
This confinement is to be
expected, since the movie was
taken from Neil Simon's
Broadway play, and it is hard (and
often unsuccessfully done) to take
a story from a set and spread it all
over a city. Simon's play
prophesies today's economic
crises, so that it is extraordinarily
contemporary.

It is good to have Jack
Lemmon back as the great comic
actor he is. After a string of duds
(Avanti, for one), his masterpiece
Save The Tiger rescued him to
give us this and The Front Page.
Here again we have the talent so
evident in Some Like It Hot as he
plays the beleagured Mel Edison,
your typical New Yorker
imprisoned at the corner of
Second Avenue and 88th Street.
As usual, Simon is the king of
the one-liner (Mel comes into the
apartment dazed and fails to see
that they've been robbed, and
after his realisation he asks his
wife, "Didn't Mildred come in to
clean today?").
He sweetens up New York's
usual grim picture as Edison loses
his job, has a nervous breakdown,
and is forced to change roles with
his wife, Edna.
Eventually, Mel goes crazy
doing nothing and Edna goes
crazy trying to live with him.
As the movie chronicles each
one's decline into lunacy and
ascent into sanity, we are treated
to Lemmon and to Anne
Bancroft, who only works on
screen occasionally and prefers to
work with quality.
She, too, gives a wonderfully
funny performance as Edna,
slightly dumb but always willing
to please. The Prisoner of Second
Avenue was directed by Melvin
Frank, who also did A Touch Of
Class. While this is not quite up to
Class it is a wonderful movie that
will certainly — if Death Wish and
Report To The Commissioner
haven't already —convince you to
stay the hell out of New York if
you value your life and your
sanity.
So often movies about the
perils of living laced with comedy
become too sad to handle.
Fortunately, Prisoner always
manages to keep an optimistic eye
out, all the way to the final scene
when the Edisons realize they will
not leave New York without a
fight, and that the only way to
survive is to join the inmates that
have taken over the asylum and be
as crazy as their neighbors.

THE SINGING NUT—Sally Kellerman, who says she'd like to be a singer, plays a neurotic who (surprise!)
wants to be a singer in the new film Rafferty and the Gold Dust Tivins. Although she doesn't fare too
well, according to critic Howard Baldwin, the movie is a pleasant success, due largely to the acting of Alan
Arkin (right).
At the risk of prematurely
spotting a trend, I think there's
one on the horizon that definitely
confirms that we are in the midst
of an economic recession, as if
that weren't apparent already.
Hollywood has this soothing
habit of coming out with movies
that have happy endings for a
change, where the characters end
up a little happier or a little more
content than when we first met
them, rather than leaving the
audience with a heavy feeling of
depression as when Faye
Dunaway gets shot just when she's
about to get away.
This trend moves back to
comedies, to make us forget all
our problems. There are few
things worse than a movie that is
supposed to be a comedy and fails
miserably to elicit laughs
Freebie and the Bean, for
example. However, now you can
be treated to two comedies that
are actually funny.
First up is Rafferty and the
Gold Dust Twins (which,
unfortunately, has to be
pronounced very precisely, or it
comes out like "Goldustwins,"
which is not yet a recognizable
English word), continuing in the
tradition of Harry and Tonto, a
1970s road picture, in which, due
to circumstances beyond the
characters' control, they set off
on a cross-country trek.
Weird Bunch
This affords the opportunity to
meet all sorts of interesting and
weird characters in order to show
what a diverse country America is
and how it will survive anyway
because it has solid, humorous
people giving it a solid backbone.
Rafferty is no different, except
that it is funnier than average, and
populated with con men (and
women) that will steal away your
laughter.
We are introduced to
Rafferty's thrilling existence at a
Marine veterans' party (Rafferty
was a lifer) where he passes out,
waking up to a breakfast of beer
and potato chips and his mundane
job at the Department of Motor
Vehicles (you wouldn't know it

from the way he drives— somewhat
like Steve McQueen would under
heavy sedation), an existence
Rafferty logically is not endeared
to.
Two wackos he meets on his
lunch break (MacKenzie Phillips,
13-year-old Carol in American
Graffiti, as Frisbee, and Sally
Ke Herman, as MacKinley
Beechwood or Big Mac) kidnap
him in his "alleged" car ("I never
saw no white man drive a car like
this," says Big Mac).
On To Orleans
They order him to drive them
to New Orleans so that Big Mac
can get a singing job in the
nightclub Frisbee's father owns
(coincidentally, Sally Kellerman
also wants to be a singer, and she
gives us an idea of her capabilities
— unfortunately).
They're off, and they proceed
to Las Vegas, meeting the
strangest people, conning the
hicks, making their getaway and
having a jolly-good time. It would
not do justice to the movie to
relate all of the sparkling scenes in
it, but they were all enjoyable,
paced well, and altogether it was a
perfect piece of entertainment.
It plays on the audience's envy.

that weren't apparent already.
Hollywood has this soothing
habit of coming out with movies
that have happy endings for a
change, where the characters end
up a little happier or a little more
content than when we first met
them, rather than leaving the
audience with a heavy feeling of
depression as when Faye
Dunaway gets shot just when she's
about to get away.
This trend moves back to
comedies, to make us forget all
our problems. There are few
things worse than a movie that is
supposed to be a comedy and fails
miserably to elicit laughs
Freebie and the Bean, for
example. However, now you can
be treated to two comedies that
are actually funny.
First up is Rafferty and the
Gold Dust Twins (which,
unfortunately, has to be
pronounced very precisely, or it
comes out like "Goldustwins,"
which is not yet a recognizable
English word), continuing in the
tradition of Harry and Tonto, a
1970s road picture, in which, due
to circumstances beyond the
characters' control, they set off
on a cross-country trek.
Weird Bunch
This affords the opportunity to
meet all sorts of interesting and
weird characters in order to show
what a diverse country America is
and how it will survive anyway
because it has solid, humorous
people giving it a solid backbone.
Rafferty is no different, except
that it is funnier than average, and
populated with con men (and
women) that will steal away your
laughter.
We are introduced to
Rafferty's thrilling existence at a
Marine veterans' party (Rafferty
was a lifer) where he passes out,
waking up to a breakfast of beer
and potato chips and his mundane
job at the Department of Motor
Vehicles (you wouldn't know it

from the way he drives— somewhat
like Steve McQueen would under
heavy sedation), an existence
Rafferty logically is not endeared
to.
Two wackos he meets on his
lunch break (MacKenzie Phillips,
13-year-old Carol in American
Graffiti, as Frisbee, and Sally
Ke Herman, as MacKinley
Beechwood or Big Mac) kidnap
him in his "alleged" car ("I never
saw no white man drive a car like
this," says Big Mac).
On To Orleans
They order him to drive them
to New Orleans so that Big Mac
can get a singing job in the
nightclub Frisbee's father owns
(coincidentally, Sally Kellerman
also wants to be a singer, and she
gives us an idea of her capabilities
— unfortunately).
They're off, and they proceed
to Las Vegas, meeting the
strangest people, conning the
hicks, making their getaway and
having a jolly-good time. It would
not do justice to the movie to
relate all of the sparkling scenes in
it, but they were all enjoyable,
paced well, and altogether it was a
perfect piece of entertainment.
It plays on the audience's envy.
When Big Mac and Frisbee kidnaD
Rafferty, we secretly wish
someone would come along and
take us away from our daily
drudgeries. We are collectively
envious of Rafferty, especially
when, after his escape, he chooses
to return to his captors, since he
has nothing to return to in Los
Angeles anyway (does anyone?).
Giant Steps
Alan Arkin takes a giant step
out of his career slump with his
portrayal of Rafferty, proving
himself a great comedian and
actor, reaching all the way back to
The Russians Are Coming.
MacKenzie Phillips is splendid as
the snide Frisbee (that's her name
this week — next week it'll oe
different), who is a writer (all
writers are strange to begin with)
and has a lot to learn.
Unfortunately, there is also
Sally Kellerman, who may be the
most overrated talent of the

19705. She has but one
performance in every movie —
drop in a quarter, and you get
Neurotic.
She was a neurotic nurse in
M*A*S*H*, a neurotic Newsweek
correspondent in Lost Horizon,
and a neurotic thief in Slither.
Here she's a neurotic loner, very
closely resembling Lennie in Of
Mice And Men, being led around
by a loving but tyrannical Frisbee.
Strong Support
In the supporting performances
are Alex Rocco (Arkin's
befuddled superior in Freebie),
turning in another gem of a
comedy routine worthy of higher
billing, as Vinnie, who has his own
unique way of beating a
restaurant check (set fire to the
tablecloth), and Charlie Martin
Smith (also of American Graffiti)
as the soldier Frisbee rolls.
If Rafferty shows that America
is full of diverse types, then The
Prisoner of Second Avenue shows
New York as a microcosm of
America with many unusual
people squeezed into one tiny
space. A normal person has no
chance to survive there, and the
movies and television utilize New
York mercilessly as the center of
crime and anarchy.
Little Man
Prisoner adds to this image,
except that it shows the plight of
the little man — the victim, for a
change, rather than the fumbling
police or the kingpins of the
underworld. It is a refreshing
change and a funny one as well.
Contrasting completely at least
in terms of setting, Prisoner is an
equally enjoyable movie. While
Rafferty takes place on the roads
of the Southwest, Prisoner takes
place mostly in the Edison
apartment in New York, with
occasional scenes in Central Park,
Connecticut, and the streets of
New York.
This confinement is to be
expected, since the movie was
taken from Neil Simon's
Broadway play, and it is hard (and
often unsuccessfully done) to take
a story from a set and spread it all
over a city. Simon's play
prophesies today's economic
crises, so that it is extraordinarily
contemporary.

It is good to have Jack
Lemmon back as the great comic
actor he is. After a string of duds
(Avanti, for one), his masterpiece
Save The Tiger rescued him to
give us this and The Front Page.
Here again we have the talent so
evident in Some Like It Hot as he
plays the beleagured Mel Edison,
your typical New Yorker
imprisoned at the corner of
Second Avenue and 88th Street.
As usual, Simon is the king of
the one-liner (Mel comes into the
apartment dazed and fails to see
that they've been robbed, and
after his realisation he asks his
wife, "Didn't Mildred come in to
clean today?").
He sweetens up New York's
usual grim picture as Edison loses
his job, has a nervous breakdown,
and is forced to change roles with
his wife, Edna.
Eventually, Mel goes crazy
doing nothing and Edna goes
crazy trying to live with him.
As the movie chronicles each
one's decline into lunacy and
ascent into sanity, we are treated
to Lemmon and to Anne
Bancroft, who only works on
screen occasionally and prefers to
work with quality.
She, too, gives a wonderfully
funny performance as Edna,
slightly dumb but always willing
to please. The Prisoner of Second
Avenue was directed by Melvin
Frank, who also did A Touch Of
Class. While this is not quite up to
Class it is a wonderful movie that
will certainly — if Death Wish and
Report To The Commissioner
haven't already —convince you to
stay the hell out of New York if
you value your life and your
sanity.
So often movies about the
perils of living laced with comedy
become too sad to handle.
Fortunately, Prisoner always
manages to keep an optimistic eye
out, all the way to the final scene
when the Edisons realize they will
not leave New York without a
fight, and that the only way to
survive is to join the inmates that
have taken over the asylum and be
as crazy as their neighbors.
