# Bis Weekend For Netters
## Bruins, Trojans, Bunnies Await Cards 
### RON BECK 
When Stanford tennis Coach Dick Gould
takes his team on a road trip, he does it with
class.
No Motel 6s. And no Bonus-Jack dinners.
Typical of Gould's style was the team's
spring break trip to Georgia — during which
the team stayed at Big Canoe, a plush
country-club resort. But even that trip pales
in comparison to what's on this weekend's
itinerary when the Cards make their annual
Los Angeles trip.
Using the Century Plaza Hotel as home
base, Stanford opens the Pac-8 season against
underrated USC on Friday. On Saturday the
team plays its only real challenger for the
Pac-8 and NCAA titles — UCLA.
And on Sunday the team climaxes the
trip. The matchweary team-members spend
the afternoon as guests of Hugh Hefner at the
Playboy Mansion West in what may be the
hardest hours of the weekend.
Not All Fun
As idyllic as all this sounds, Gould doesn't
expect the trip to be all fun and games.
UCLA and USC are ranked 2nd and 4th in
the nation respectively, and Stanford hasn't
met a team of their quality all season.
Friday's match with USC can't be
overlooked by the Cards, warns Gould.
Although USC Coach George Toley feels that
"[Stanford] and UCLA are in a class all
alone, and [USC is] a good step below,"
both Gould and UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett
disagree.
"Everyone's talking about how great
UCLA is, meanwhile USC has come onto the
scene like gangbusters," says Gould.
Bassett says in agreement, "USC is coming
on very fast. I don't think they're behind
[Stanford and UCLA] at all."

The Trojans were hurt badly by the loss
of their three top players from last year, but
a young lineup headed by sophomore Butch
Walts and freshman Bruce Manson has
brought the team to a 10-1 record. Five of
the wins have been against teams ranked in
the top 10. The Trojans' only loss came
early in the season against Pepperdine, but
was later avenged with a 6-3 win.
Gould lists his tentative singles lineup as
follows (in order): John Whitlinger, Nick
Saviano, Pat DuPre, Jim Delaney, Gene
Mayer and Bill Maze.
Cards Should Win
Stanford should have the depth to win the
match in the singles, but should the match go
down to the doubles, the Cards — despite
poor doubles playing all season — should be
able to pull the match away from the
inexperienced Trojan pairs.
Saturday's match is tougher to predict.
UCLA and Stanford seem perfectly matched.
Defending NCAA champ John Whitlinger will
face either freshman Bill Martin or junior
Brian Teacher in the first singles spot. Both
Martin and Whitlinger will be coming off of
match losses — Whitlinger to Manuel Diaz of
Georgia and Martin to Hank Pfister of San
Jose State.
Martin (No. 22), Whitlinger (No. 27),
Teacher (No. 28) and the Cards' fourth
singles player, Jim Delaney (No. 36), are the
top four ranked U.S. men playing on the
college level.
Bassett and Gould are both unwilling to
conjecture about any specific matchups, but
Bassett — in reference to Whitlinger — says,
"[Steve] Mott [who hasn't reported to the
team this season J beat him down here last
year. My best man, whoever it will be, should

have a good chance to beat him [Whitlinger].
He's not unbeatable."
Gould said earlier this season that
"Whitlinger can beat anybody in the college
ranks, but it's impossible to say how he'll do
in a particular match." All of the other
singles matches are toss-ups, both coaches
agree.
What shoi'ld worry Gould is the prospect
of a 3-3 split in the singles, because Stanford
has been painfully weak in the doubles so far
this year. If the Cards need a win or two in
doubles to clinch the match, as Gould
predicts they will, UCLA should have the
upper hand.
"We're pretty good in doubles," declares
Bassett. Bassett is particularly happy with the
progress of the Martin-Teacher duo, which he
thinks is strong enough to give NCAA
doubles champs Whitlinger-Delaney a real
battle. At second and third doubles, the
Cards' pairings of Nick Saviano-Mark
Mitchell and Pat DuPre-Gene Mayer will meet
their toughest competition of the year.
Should Be Close
Bassett agrees that the match will be
decided in the doubles. "It'll probably go
down to 4-4 with one of the doubles matches
clinching it — just like last year," speculates
Bassett, referring to last year's 5-4 UCLA win
in Los Angeles. If Stanford pulls out both
matches, it would be the first time since
1942 that the team has swept both L.A.
contests.
But, no matter how the weekend goes, the
Cards should be up for the visit to the
Playboy Mansion on Sunday. Spending the
afternoon at Hefner's Xanadu should be a
good way to either celebrate victory or salve
defeat for the Cards.
