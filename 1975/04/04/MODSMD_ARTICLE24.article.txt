# Card Batters Start Pac-8 Season
## 
### MIKE TOLLIN 
Wednesday the Cardinal
baseball team scooted off to UC-
Davis for its tenth game in as
many days. The Cards returned
home a weary, beaten club, the
victims of a 16-2 thrashing.
There was some controversy
over Monday's report that the
Cards "let down" last Saturday
night in their title game loss to
UC-Riverside.
But Wednesday there was no
question about it. According to
Assistant Sports Information
Director John Wright, who has
been following Stanford baseball
for six years, this was the

"traditional Stanford letdown.
Every year," he continued, "the
week after the Riverside
tournament, we have one real bad
game."
"Real bad?" Let's try
embarassing. Or how about
atrocious? The Stanford squad
that showed up at Davis
Wednesday bore little resemblance
to the team that had won 12 of its
last 14 games. The Stanford
batsmen managed to reach base a
grand total of four times. And
three Card hurlers dished out 20
hits and five home runs.
Starting pitcher Jim
Scharffenberger said, "It was just

a case of too much baseball for
us."
On Wednesday, three innings
was too much. After throwing out
two gopher balls in the first
inning, and allowing two more
runs in the third, Scharffenberger
was off to the shower.
Bruce Davis was the next man
on the firing line, and the worst
was yet to come. With a strong
wind blowing out toward the
short right field fence, the Davis
right-handed batters started
swinging late and coming home
early. Taking advantage of a
distinct home-field edge
Coach Ray Young said four of
Davis' homers were just "routine
fly balls under normal
circumstances" — the Aggies
pushed across nine runs in a wild
sixth inning.
Finally Cardinal reliever Kent
Caldwell stormed out of the
bullpen and put himself into the
game. He quelled the ruckus and
managed to hasten an end to
the Stanford nightmare. Card
home runs by Kevin Sullivan and
Tom Guardino in the fifth and
ninth were lost in the commotion.
Today, Stanford opens the
Pac-8 season against UCLA, at the

Sunken Diamond. This year, as in
basketball, it is possible for two
Pac-8 teams to qualify for
post-season play, so there's added
incentive. Stanford's ace A 1
Arthur will be on the mound, and
he should have his work cut out
for him against the Bruin bats.
"UCLA is a very powerful ball
club," said Young. "But, right
now, Arthur is one of the premier
pitchers in the country."
Coach Young is confident
Stanford can be a league
contender. "Against Davis we
were obviously looking ahead to
this weekend. We played poorly,
out overall I'm pleased with our
play of late. I think we're ready!"

Wednesday the Cardinal
baseball team scooted off to UC-
Davis for its tenth game in as
many days. The Cards returned
home a weary, beaten club, the
victims of a 16-2 thrashing.
There was some controversy
over Monday's report that the
Cards "let down" last Saturday
night in their title game loss to
UC-Riverside.
But Wednesday there was no
question about it. According to
Assistant Sports Information
Director John Wright, who has
been following Stanford baseball
for six years, this was the

"traditional Stanford letdown.
Every year," he continued, "the
week after the Riverside
tournament, we have one real bad
game."
"Real bad?" Let's try
embarassing. Or how about
atrocious? The Stanford squad
that showed up at Davis
Wednesday bore little resemblance
to the team that had won 12 of its
last 14 games. The Stanford
batsmen managed to reach base a
grand total of four times. And
three Card hurlers dished out 20
hits and five home runs.
Starting pitcher Jim
Scharffenberger said, "It was just

a case of too much baseball for
us."
On Wednesday, three innings
was too much. After throwing out
two gopher balls in the first
inning, and allowing two more
runs in the third, Scharffenberger
was off to the shower.
Bruce Davis was the next man
on the firing line, and the worst
was yet to come. With a strong
wind blowing out toward the
short right field fence, the Davis
right-handed batters started
swinging late and coming home
early. Taking advantage of a
distinct home-field edge
Coach Ray Young said four of
Davis' homers were just "routine
fly balls under normal
circumstances" — the Aggies
pushed across nine runs in a wild
sixth inning.
Finally Cardinal reliever Kent
Caldwell stormed out of the
bullpen and put himself into the
game. He quelled the ruckus and
managed to hasten an end to
the Stanford nightmare. Card
home runs by Kevin Sullivan and
Tom Guardino in the fifth and
ninth were lost in the commotion.
Today, Stanford opens the
Pac-8 season against UCLA, at the

Sunken Diamond. This year, as in
basketball, it is possible for two
Pac-8 teams to qualify for
post-season play, so there's added
incentive. Stanford's ace A 1
Arthur will be on the mound, and
he should have his work cut out
for him against the Bruin bats.
"UCLA is a very powerful ball
club," said Young. "But, right
now, Arthur is one of the premier
pitchers in the country."
Coach Young is confident
Stanford can be a league
contender. "Against Davis we
were obviously looking ahead to
this weekend. We played poorly,
out overall I'm pleased with our
play of late. I think we're ready!"
