# Cage Coach Selection Nears
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Members of the committee
searching for a new head
basketball coach expect to make
their selection tonight in a
meeting with Athletic Director
Joe Ruetz, who will contact the
committee's designee tomorrow
or Sunday and make a formal
announcement Monday.
The committee has interviewed
four candidates, and one member
said eliminating three of them
"will be a tough decision to
make." Another member said
press accounts of the search "have
us much further along than we
really are."
According to this member, "we
are close to deciding, timewise,
but not in terms of the
development of our discussion."
He said the committee as a whole
has not yet compared the relative
qualifications and assets of the
candidates.
Four Candidates
The four candidates are:
—Dave Bliss, 31, assistant
coach at Indiana University since
1971. lie also served as freshman
coach at Cornell for three years,
and as assistant coach at both
West Point (three years) and
Cornell (three years) before
joining Bobby Knight's staff at
Indiana.
—Bub Bowling, 35, who has
been Howie Dallmar's assistant
here since 19 70. A Stanford
graduate, Bowling worked for one
year as assistant coach at Los
Altos High School before
assuming the top job at Westmont
High School in Campbell. One
year later, Bowling moved on to

Lynbrook High School in San
Jose for a five-year stint as head
coach.
—Percy Carr, 33, assistant
coach here during the past season.
Carr was assistant basketball,
football and baseball coach at
Tulare High School for three years
before becoming head basketball
coach at Fresno's Edison High
School. He served there for five
seasons and then came to
Stanford.
—Richard Dibiaso, 33, assistant
coach at Notre Dame since 1971.
Dibiaso was junior varsity coach
for two years, and then head
coach for four years, at Beacon
High School in New York.
Dibiaso Interviewed Tuesday
A source close to the search
committee revealed Dibiaso's
name to the Daily shortly before
the committee interviewed him
Tuesday night. Ruetz had
interviewed Dibiaso in San Diego
last week during the NCAA
tournament and coaches'
conference, and referred him to
the committee for another
interview which lasted almost
three hours Tuesday.
The sports editor of The
Observer, Notre Dame's student
newspaper, described Dibiaso as
"a great scout and a knowledgeable
person who knows his basketball,
both offense and defense. He's
great with the players," the sports
editor said, "a lot better than
Digger."
Ruetz interviewed about 15
other potential candidates while
he was in San Diego, but
apparently decided not to refer
anyone besides Dibiaso to the

committee. Sports Information
Director Gary Cavalli, a
committee member, said Ruetz
believed the committee had
interviewed "the cream of the
crop."
Players Send Letter
The Daily has also learned that
virtually every- member of the
1974-75 basketball team here
signed a one-paragraph letter,
drafted by reserve guard Mike
Simons, which recommended the
selection of Bowling. Search
committee member Rich Kelley
turned the letter over to
committee Chairman Frank
Lodato a week ago today.
Simons said he and Kelley
circulated the letter after Scott
Trobbe and Jay Carter had left for
vacation, but indicated that the
rest of the players had signed it.
Committee members are:
Lodato, Cavalli, Kelley, Alumni
Board members Dave Stone and
Franklin Johnson, Buck Club
representative Ted Tanner, team
member Melvin Arterberry and
women's basketball player Ann
Watson.
Administration representatives
on the committee are: Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon,
Assoc. Athletic Director Bob
Young, Faculty Athletic
Representative John Harbaugh,
track coach Payton Jordan,
Executive Asst. to the Provost Ed
Shaw, Assoc. Athletic Director
and Physical Education Chairman
Pam Strathairn and Law Prof.
Jack Friedenthal, who is chairman
of the University Committee on
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation.
