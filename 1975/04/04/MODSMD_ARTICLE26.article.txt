# Spikers Face Powerful UCLA
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
One might expect the Stanford track
squad to have its head in the clouds this
week. After all, it's coming off what Coach
Payton Jordan called the "best total team
effort we've had since 1971" — a victory over
previously unbeaten Occidental. But at
Wednesday afternoon's practice session the
Cards were all business. A look at the
schedule was all it took to explain it.
UCLA (double-dual) with USC-Cal — at
UCLA 1:15 p.m. tomorrow.
You don't have to tell Stanford that the
Bruins have won the NCAA track and field
crown three out of the last four years and
that they just missed last year's crown by
two points. And you certainly don't have to
tell them that the Bruins have seven returning
NCAA point winners plus the best pole vault
prospect in the nation. The Cards know it
already.
As Jordan said, "We respect them, but
we're not awed. We intend to go down there
and compete well. We expect to have a
number of personal and season's bests."

But does anyone believe the
eternal-optimist Jordan? Well, freshman long
jumper James Lofton does. Lofton will be in
one of the feature events of the meet, going
up against defending NCAA long jump
champ Jerry Hemdon, who has a career best
of 26-feet-7 1 /2. The similarities between the
two are striking.
Hemdon won the California State high
school long jump crown in 1973; Lofton won
it last year. Hemdon went 25-2'/2 last week in
the Bruins' 83-71 win over NCAA champion
Tennessee; Lofton went 24-6% last Saturday
against Occidental. "I've been thinking about
going up against him all year," Lofton said.
"I'm going up against him, not UCLA. It's
kind of bad to think you're going up against
them, you should think of the individual
you're competing against."
Pole vaulter Bob Flint is another Card
who takes Jordan seriously. Flint, who will
be vaulting against the Bruins' Ron Moers
and Mike Tully, the best one-two pole vault
punch in the nation, said, "I just hope I can
get going and get up there to 16-6. When you

go against UCLA you're going against the
best."
But Flint, last year's state JC pole vault
king, will have his work cut out for him, as
he goes up against Moers and Tully. Last year
Moers finished fourth in the NCAA meet
with a vault of 17-0. Last week he went 17-3
but that was only good enough for second, as
freshman Tully set a national junior record
with a 17-9 vault.
Sprinter Marvin Holmes, a double winner
last week, even painted a scenario for a Card
victory. "If we can pick up some points in
the field.... UCLA is strong there but they
don't have as much depth as they've had, we
can'hold our own on the track."
Stanford hasn't beaten the Bruins since
1965.
Just then distanceman Tony Sandoval
came running around the track. "Beat Cal,"
read the sticker attached to his jersey.
"California at Los Angeles," quipped
Asst. Coach Marshal Clark.

Tennessee; Lofton went 24-6% last Saturday
against Occidental. "I've been thinking about
going up against him all year," Lofton said.
"I'm going up against him, not UCLA. It's
kind of bad to think you're going up against
them, you should think of the individual
you're competing against."
Pole vaulter Bob Flint is another Card
who takes Jordan seriously. Flint, who will
be vaulting against the Bruins' Ron Moers
and Mike Tully, the best one-two pole vault
punch in the nation, said, "I just hope I can
get going and get up there to 16-6. When you

go against UCLA you're going against the
best."
But Flint, last year's state JC pole vault
king, will have his work cut out for him, as
he goes up against Moers and Tully. Last year
Moers finished fourth in the NCAA meet
with a vault of 17-0. Last week he went 17-3
but that was only good enough for second, as
freshman Tully set a national junior record
with a 17-9 vault.
Sprinter Marvin Holmes, a double winner
last week, even painted a scenario for a Card
victory. "If we can pick up some points in
the field.... UCLA is strong there but they
don't have as much depth as they've had, we
can'hold our own on the track."
Stanford hasn't beaten the Bruins since
1965.
Just then distanceman Tony Sandoval
came running around the track. "Beat Cal,"
read the sticker attached to his jersey.
"California at Los Angeles," quipped
Asst. Coach Marshal Clark.
Stanford hasn't beaten the Bruins since
when? ,
One might expect the Stanford track
squad to have its head in the clouds this
week. After all, it's coming off what Coach
Payton Jordan called the "best total team
effort we've had since 1971" — a victory over
previously unbeaten Occidental. But at
Wednesday afternoon's practice session the
Cards were all business. A look at the
schedule was all it took to explain it.
UCLA (double-dual) with USC-Cal — at
UCLA 1:15 p.m. tomorrow.
You don't have to tell Stanford that the
Bruins have won the NCAA track and field
crown three out of the last four years and
that they just missed last year's crown by
two points. And you certainly don't have to
tell them that the Bruins have seven returning
NCAA point winners plus the best pole vault
prospect in the nation. The Cards know it
already.
As Jordan said, "We respect them, but
we're not awed. We intend to go down there
and compete well. We expect to have a
number of personal and season's bests."

But does anyone believe the
eternal-optimist Jordan? Well, freshman long
jumper James Lofton does. Lofton will be in
one of the feature events of the meet, going
up against defending NCAA long jump
champ Jerry Hemdon, who has a career best
of 26-feet-7 1 /2. The similarities between the
two are striking.
Hemdon won the California State high
school long jump crown in 1973; Lofton won
it last year. Hemdon went 25-2'/2 last week in
the Bruins' 83-71 win over NCAA champion
Tennessee; Lofton went 24-6% last Saturday
against Occidental. "I've been thinking about
going up against him all year," Lofton said.
"I'm going up against him, not UCLA. It's
kind of bad to think you're going up against
