## A 						Gold Mine In Denver 
### Dan Pyne 
Dear Pro Prognosticator:
All my friends tell me that
there is no such thing as the
American Basketball Association.
They say that it is just a great
hoax, perpetrated by the
communists. They show me the
San Francisco Chronicle to prove
their point. The Chronicle only
mentions the National Basketball
Association.
In spite of this I want to
believe that there is an ABA. My
father tells me that if / read it in
the Stanford Daily it must be so,
and that's why I am writing to
you.
Please clear this up for me so I
can hang my Moses Malone poster

back on my wall.
Virginia
Get out the thumbtacks,
because yes, Virginia, there is an
American Basketball Association.
It has thrived despite the heavy
hand of the NBA and will no
doubt continue to be a viable
representation of professional
basketball talent.
May I remind you that Spencer
Haywood and Rick Barry are both
former ABA players.
If you search the congested
depths of the Chronicle's pathetic
"Sporting Green" you will find,
right above High School Baseball
and right below Sacramento
Horseshoe Pitching, a "six-point"

table of the ABA league standings.
And, Virginia, if you are
blessed with very sharp eyes you
will notice, at the top of the
division labeled Western,
basketball's winningest
team .. . the Denver Nuggets.
The Nuggets were, prior to this
season, the Rockets, and they
were never as good as they are this
year. How good are they? At
64-19, leading its division by 14
games, the Nuggets are one of the
best pro basketball teams around.
They should win the ABA
championship.
Even more remarkable, only
one year ago Denver was
somewhat apathetically at the

bottom of the same division, with
what seemed to be a perpetual
case of the Mile High Blues.
It wasn't a lack of talent.
Though the Rockets had the likes
of Haywood and Warren Jabali
and Ralph Simpson, they had but
one really good season, in
1969-70, when they last won their
division title.
The problem has been
coaching. Joe Belmont coached
the 69-70 team, but didn't hang
around. Alex Hannum took over
and led the Rockets gradually
downhill to their seat on the
dunghill of America's obscure
professional basketball
association. Hannum got the boot.
Ex-Rocket star and now coach
Larry Brown has been the
difference, aided by the solid play
of the common likes of Fatty
Taylor and Mike Green and Byron
Beck and ex-Stanford star Claude
Terry and others. Oh yes, and
Ralph Simpson.
Brown installed at Denver a
college-like go-gettum attitude
that has kept the rest of the ABA
swimming. He wasn't responsible
for the change of face â€” that was
left to new General Manager Carl
Sheer, a lawyer, who was also
responsible for the signing of
rookies Bobby Jones and Jan van
Breda Kolff, and veteran guards
Mack Calvin (former Carolina
star) and Taylor (whose defense
has led one coach to comment,
"It's like playing through a
rosebush").
The Nuggets hustle and chatter
and run around like a small town
high school intramural team in
Indiana, creating a stark contrast
to the normally droll attitudes of
professional sport. Scoff if you
must, Virginia, but the Rocky
Mountain kids were 32-5 in
January, already leading their
division by 12 games.
The Nuggets have no internal
dissension, and no gripes. They
just keep winning. "Things may
be screwed up everywhere else,"
Brown explains, "but they're not
screwed up here." Indeed.
So, Virginia, the next time
your friends give you trouble
show them a Sporting News. The
Nuggets are solid gold.
