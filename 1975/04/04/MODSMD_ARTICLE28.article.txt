# Card Crew Opens Season
## 
### RICK TUTTLE 
"Crew . .. isn't that the sport
with the maniacs who get up
before the sun rises and are in bed
before it sets?"
Although a slight exaggeration,
this conception of crew at
Stanford is basically accurate —
the excessive winds that blow
throughout the spring months
force the team to schedule
practice time when conditions are
best. Hence the "dawn patrol."
Saturday the Stanford Crew
receives its first test of the season

as it takes on traditional rivals
USC and Santa Clara in the Conn
Findlay Cup Regatta at Redwood
Shores. This race will determine if
the spirit of optimism that has
enveloped the team this year is
well-founded or an illusion
brought on by too many sunrises.
In the 1950s and '60s Stanford
was continually at or near the top
in West Coast rowing, but in the
last seven years this hasn't been
the case. The varsity's ninth place
finish at last year's Western Sprint
Championships exemplified the
past failures. After showing early
promise the team slumped badly
at the last, losing to teams it had
beaten earlier in the season. In the
wake of the Sprints debacle Coach
Len Sherr resigned to seek his
fortunes elsewhere. The gap
created by his departure was
quickly filled by Dick
Dreisengackker, a member of the
1972 Olympic team and coach of
the freshmen crew.
Dreisengackker's frosh turned out
to be the one bright spot in the
season as they pulled a surprising
third at the Sprints, the highest
finish by a Stanford boat in
several years.
Confident that he can produce
similar results on the varsity level,
Dreisengackker has put the team
through a rigorous practice
schedule that goes all the way
back to September and reached its
apex during spring "vacation"
when the team stayed on campus
undergoing three-a-day workouts.
The team feels well prepared for
the seven week season that begins
tomorrow and ends May 16-17 at
the Western Sprints in Long Beach

where they hope to challenge
powers Washington and Cal for
the top position and perhaps an
invitiation to the IRA National
Championship Regatta in New
York.
The freshmen eights begin
tomorrow's program at 9 a.m.,
with the varsity racing at 10:30.
Also scheduled are the junior
varsity eights, an open four and
women's eights and fours.
The varsity lineup for the
Findlay Cup includes coxswain
Corey Hayden, Mark
Grosenbaugh, Randy Thomas,
Dick Bailey, Glass, John Allured,
Wickersham, captain Sam Francis
and Hank Koerner.
Redwood Shores may be
reached by taking Bayshore
Expressway north to the Ralston
Avenue exit, then traveling east
on Ralston l h mile . Come out and
see what could be the best
Stanford squad since the days of
the crewcut.
Crew Notes — In an effort to
raise money for the trip to
Eugene, Oregon and the two trips
10 L.A., the Crew is raffling an
H.l\ 21 calculator donated by the
Stanford Bookstore. Tickets for
the raffle are 50c or three for $1
and can be purchased from any
crew member. The drawing will be
held Saturday, April 19
immediately following the home
race vs. St. Marys at Belmont.
