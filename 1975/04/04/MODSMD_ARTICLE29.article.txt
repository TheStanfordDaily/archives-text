U.S. To Evacuate Vietnamese Or P h ans
SAIGON — Voluntary adoption agencies appealed to the
United States yesterday for an airlift of jumbo jets to get
hundreds of Vietnamese orphans to safety in America,
welfare sources said.
In San Diego, President Ford told a news conference he
has ordered the U.S. Embassy in Saigon to "cut red tape"
in the way of evacuating Vietnamese orphans. Ford said a
special program is under way to bring 2000 orphans to the
United States.
"It is the least we can do and we will do much, much
more," Ford said.
Meanwhile in San Francisco, 30 South Vietnamese
orphans arrived at 9 p.m. last night on a Pan American
World Airways passenger flight from Saigon, an airline
spokesman said.
Another group of Vietnamese orphans played and gazed
with wide-eyed fascination yesterday as dozens of gentle
volunteers fussed and cooed at them in the shadow of the
Golden Gate Bridge.
Just three days ago, these children were in endangered
Saigon where a World Airways jet defied orders and took
off with them to a new life.
There was some initial confusion about the exact
number of orphans on the plane, but Army officials said
yesterday that 58 arrived here. Two were left at the U.S.
Air Force base in Yokota, Japan, because they were
malnourished and dehydrated.
