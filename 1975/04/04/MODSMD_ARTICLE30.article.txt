CORRECTIONS
Yesterday's Daily incorrectly implied that officials had
considered a Mill Valley man a suspect in the Janet Taylor
murder. He was never considered a suspect. It also
incorrectly identified the A&P Committee as the
Advancement and Placement Committee. It is the
Appointments and Promotions Committee.

The preadopted orphans were flown into Oakland
International Airport aboard a jet turned into a giant, flying
playpen Wednesday night, then bused about 20 miles to a
reserve barracks at the 6th Army Presidio in San Francisco,
on the edge of the Bay.
Connally Accused Of Seeking Bribe
WASHINGTON — Milk-fund lawyer Jake Jacobsen
testified yesterday that he gave John B. Connally $10,000
while the latter was secretary' of the treasury after Connally
asked "why don't they raise money for me?"
Jacobsen, the government's star witness at Connally's
bribery trial, was asked how he decided on $10,000 as a
payment.
"I didn't want it to be too small because I didn't want it
to seem we were unappreciative," Jacobsen said. "I didn't
want it to be too big. It would have made it look like we
bought the decision."
The decision he was referring to was then-President
Richard M. Nixon's increase of milk price supports on March
25, 1971, reversing an earlier decision by Secretary of
Agriculture Clifford M. Hardin to keep the level the same as
the previous year. Jacobsen was a lawyer for Associated
Milk Producers Inc. at the time the payments allegedly were
made.
Earlier in the third day of trial the jury had heard a tape
recording of a meeting March 23 in Nixon's Oval Office at
which Connally urged the President to raise the milk
support prices.
Levi Reverses Residency Proof Move
WASHINGTON - Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi has
reversed a Justice Department recommendation to Congress
that every American be required to prove legal residence
when applying for a job.
Levi said yesterday the so-called "domestic passport"
proposal, conceived as a deterrent to illegal immigration,
"would come close to a violation of something akin to a
constitutional right."
Addressing his first news conference since taking office
Feb. 7, Levi overruled, in effect, the position advanced by
his top aide. Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence Silberman.
Three days before Levi was sworn in, Silberman told a
House committee that legislation to toughen immigration
policy should include a provision that would empower the
Department to require all employers to demand proof of
residency from job applicants.
Silberman suggested this might entail issuing a special
card which all Americans would be required to obtain.
**l do not like the idea of requiring every employee to
carry a card ... before he gets a job." said Levi.
Levi conceded, however, that "we may have to come to
that" if the flood of illegal aliens, whose numbers are now
estimated at more than a million, is not stemmed.
Today's Weather
Showers likely today. Partly cloudy tonight and
tomorrow with a chance of showers. Continued cool. Lows
tonight in the upper 30s to mid 40s. Highs both days in the

percent today and 40 percent tonight.

CORRECTIONS
Yesterday's Daily incorrectly implied that officials had
considered a Mill Valley man a suspect in the Janet Taylor
murder. He was never considered a suspect. It also
incorrectly identified the A&P Committee as the
Advancement and Placement Committee. It is the
Appointments and Promotions Committee.

The preadopted orphans were flown into Oakland
International Airport aboard a jet turned into a giant, flying
playpen Wednesday night, then bused about 20 miles to a
reserve barracks at the 6th Army Presidio in San Francisco,
on the edge of the Bay.
Connally Accused Of Seeking Bribe
WASHINGTON — Milk-fund lawyer Jake Jacobsen
testified yesterday that he gave John B. Connally $10,000
while the latter was secretary' of the treasury after Connally
asked "why don't they raise money for me?"
Jacobsen, the government's star witness at Connally's
bribery trial, was asked how he decided on $10,000 as a
payment.
"I didn't want it to be too small because I didn't want it
to seem we were unappreciative," Jacobsen said. "I didn't
want it to be too big. It would have made it look like we
bought the decision."
The decision he was referring to was then-President
Richard M. Nixon's increase of milk price supports on March
25, 1971, reversing an earlier decision by Secretary of
Agriculture Clifford M. Hardin to keep the level the same as
the previous year. Jacobsen was a lawyer for Associated
Milk Producers Inc. at the time the payments allegedly were
made.
Earlier in the third day of trial the jury had heard a tape
recording of a meeting March 23 in Nixon's Oval Office at
which Connally urged the President to raise the milk
support prices.
Levi Reverses Residency Proof Move
WASHINGTON - Atty. Gen. Edward H. Levi has
reversed a Justice Department recommendation to Congress
that every American be required to prove legal residence
when applying for a job.
Levi said yesterday the so-called "domestic passport"
proposal, conceived as a deterrent to illegal immigration,
"would come close to a violation of something akin to a
constitutional right."
Addressing his first news conference since taking office
Feb. 7, Levi overruled, in effect, the position advanced by
his top aide. Deputy Atty. Gen. Laurence Silberman.
Three days before Levi was sworn in, Silberman told a
House committee that legislation to toughen immigration
policy should include a provision that would empower the
Department to require all employers to demand proof of
residency from job applicants.
Silberman suggested this might entail issuing a special
card which all Americans would be required to obtain.
**l do not like the idea of requiring every employee to
carry a card ... before he gets a job." said Levi.
Levi conceded, however, that "we may have to come to
that" if the flood of illegal aliens, whose numbers are now
estimated at more than a million, is not stemmed.
