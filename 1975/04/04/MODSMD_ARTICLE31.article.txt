# Prof. Brown Asks Committees To Probe Panther Harassment
## 
### RON ELVING 
Religious Studies Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown has written to two
congressional committees currently
investigating federal intelligence
activities urging them to "extend
|their] inquiry to the surveillance and
harassment of the Black Panthers and
other civil rights organizations."
In the letter, Brown charges that
the Senate and House Select
Committees to Investigate the
Intelligence Community have thus far
probed only "abuses against more
established groups such as the
Democratic Party."
Brown wrote the letter as
spokesman for the Committee for

Justice for Huey Newton and the
Black Panther Party.
Committee founding member and
Stanford alumna Molly Dougherty said
the Committee was formed after
Newton's disappearance in August
1974 so that "someone other than the
Panthers themselves would be speaking
out against what was being done to
them."
In addition to Brown, the
committee's sponsors include former
ASSU President Dave Harris, former
Dean of the Stanford Chapel B. Davie
Napier; MIT Linguistics Prof. Noam
Chomsky; psychologist Rollo May;
Benjamin Spock, former P&F
Party presidential candidate; and
Philip and Daniel Berrigan, Catholic

radical activists.
Dougherty said a copy of the letter
had been received by Rep. Ron
Dellums (D-Berkeley), the only black
member of the House investigating
committee. A spokesman for the
Senate panel said yesterday that the
letter had "probably been received"
but had not yet been considered
because of the Senate's Easter recess.
Brown's letter quotes a
memorandum from the FBl's formerly
secret Counter Intelligence Program
which instructed agents to "expose,
disrupt, misdirect and discredit" the
Black Panthers and other radical
groups.
The bulk of the letter is devoted to
a catalog of actions by federal agencies
(FBI, CIA, Justice Department, IRS
and the Treasury Department's
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
Division) implementing the directive.
Citing only incidents that have been
documented in the press or admitted
by the government, Brown suggests
that "as disturbing as this evidence
is ... it is most likely only the 'tip of
the iceberg.' "
'Pretty Bad Image'
Asked about his own view of the
Panthers, Brown said they had a
"pretty bad image in terms of press
material" and that their earlier
rhetoric had "disturbed" him at one
time.
Since meeting a number of Party
leaders and members through
Dougherty and touring Panther
schools and other facilities, however,
Brown said he had conceived "a very
different image.
"I found Huey Newton to be an
extraordinary individual," Brown said.
"The conversations I've had with him
have been some of the most important
experiences of my life." He added that
prior to last summer, he and Newton
had planned to co-author a book.
Newton was accused of murder last
summer and disappeared before his
trial.
Brown stressed that the Panthers
had never been "a racist, separatist
group ... they've always coveted
support from white groups." He
concluded that "attention must be
focused" on their rights or they, and
groups like them, "will just be ground
under."
