older, conservative faculty, but added
that a person who had been here many
years might have an advantage over
other candidates.
"Let's face it. . . when you're faced
with a meteor in-the-sky chap who's
nominated for the first year and

another professor who has missed the
award by a whisker a couple years
running, you're bound to take the
latter."
Remson added the committee may
consider a professor's proximity to
retirement. The committee can honor
younger faculty in subsequent years,
he said.
Group Biased
Senior Norman Dupont, who served
as the undergrad on the 1972 panel,
said the group is biased because many
serve as members for consecutive
years.
"It's not that they set out with
preconceptions," he said, "but the
nature of people on the committee
tends to prejudice them toward people
that they're familiar with. Many are
senior faculty more likely to go along
with a colleague they know instead of
a younger faculty member who is
equally as good a teacher, but whose
name they may be unfamiliar
with.. . . It's the old club syndrome."
Dupont said the bias was most
evident when the committee had to
cut the number of nominations for the
awards from several hundred to
approximately 10 in each category.
"You may reject an applicant and
accept another at this point mostly on
the basis of the actual paper that
recommended him. One prof might
have an advantage over another
because the person who nominated
had neat handwriting or took more
time to make the report look good,"
he said.
