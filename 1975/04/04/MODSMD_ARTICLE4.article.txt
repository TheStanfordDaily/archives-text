# Judicial Change Considered
## C-15 To Propose CJP Reform 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The Committee of 15 (C-15) agreed
on a proposal for a reform of the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) last
night, but senior Kathy Cunningham,
C-15 chairperson, refused to discuss
the details until President Richard
Lyman has seen the plan.
Lyman left for the Middle East in
March, and Cunningham said he is
expected back tomorrow.
"Because the request for an
investigation of the CJP came from
President Lyman, it would be
unfortunate if he read about it in the
Daily before we submitted our actual
report," Cunningham said.
Before the Committee's meeting
last night, it was rumored that the
C-15 would propose a new judicial
system featuring three students, three
faculty members and co-chairmen —
one student and one law school
professor — neither of whom would
vote unless there were a tie.
If a tie vote occurs in an Honor
Code case, the student co-chairman
would break the tie, according to the

rumor. The other co-chairman would
break the tie in all other cases.
The current Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) has three students, three faculty
members and a chairman from the law
school who votes in case of a tie in all
cases. President Richard Lyman
created the CJP in 1971 after the
ASSU Senate refused to nominate
students to a committee which would
select students for the then-operative
Stanford Judicial Council.
Under the new proposal, it was
reported, the faculty members would
continue to oe appointed by the
Faculty Senate, while student
members would either be selected at
random or chosen by the ASSU
Committee on Nominations.
The C-15 was created in March
1965 and charged with outlining a
judicial system acceptable to the
administration, faculty and students.
ASSU President and C-15 member
Mike Herman, prior to last night's
meeting, outlined the three main
points of controversy as:
— the configuration of the CJP,
which has had essentially a
faculty-administration majority since
1965.
— the selection process for
members. Currently, faculty members
are selected by the Faculty Senate,
while student representatives are
chosen by random selection.
— the role of the dean of student
affairs. Students brought to the
President's Office on disciplinary
charges now have the option of a
hearing before either the CJP or the
dean of students. Herman said that 17
of the last 18 cases have been handled
by the dean.
Needs Lyman OK
In order to take effect, the new
system must be approved by President
Lyman, the Academic Senate and
either the ASSU Senate or the student
body as a whole.
The last proposal presented by the
C-15, in spring 1973, was forwarded
by the Senate to the students, who
overwhelmingly rejected it. C-15
member W. Randy Smith said that the

feeling in the Senate has usually been
that the CJP is "too important an issue
for that small a group to decide."
Cunningham predicted that the
question would be presented in the
upcoming ASSU elections.
Students Opposed
The 1973 proposal called for a
majority on the Panel. At
the time, several student groups,
including the Council of Presidents,
opposed the plan because the student
majority could have been revoked at
any time by the University President, a
two-thirds vote of the Academic
Senate or a two-thirds vote of the
ASSU Senate.
Herman said that the 1973 defeat
was partially caused by the fact that
only one student who had helped
develop the proposal was still at the
University to defend it when the issue
finally came to a vote.
Following the defeat of the 1973
proposal, Lyman was quoted as saying,
"I don't think that another year of
deliberations by the Committee of 15,
followed by another referendum, is
going to produce a different result."
Cunningham said that C-15
members will hold a meeting next
week to present the new proposal to
the community. "It's a complicated
document and it deserves explanation
and discussion," she said.
Smith said it will be "good for the
students to go through" the issues,
whether or not they approve this
specific proposal. As fewer political
activity cases have come before the
CJP in recent years, the judiciary
system has faded as an issue.

Last year's C-15 met once and
disbanded, according to Cunningham.
Herman reported that C-15 members
in the past have had trouble working
together, because either the student or
faculty representatives came to the
meetings with "demands" instead of
"proposals."
"I tend to think that if the students
and the Daily take a good clear look at
what we're presenting ... they will
realize that this solution is the best
possible compromise," he said.

for that small a group to decide."
Cunningham predicted that the
question would be presented in the
upcoming ASSU elections.
Students Opposed
The 1973 proposal called for a
majority on the Panel. At
the time, several student groups,
including the Council of Presidents,
opposed the plan because the student
majority could have been revoked at
any time by the University President, a
two-thirds vote of the Academic
Senate or a two-thirds vote of the
ASSU Senate.
Herman said that the 1973 defeat
was partially caused by the fact that
only one student who had helped
develop the proposal was still at the
University to defend it when the issue
finally came to a vote.
Following the defeat of the 1973
proposal, Lyman was quoted as saying,
"I don't think that another year of
deliberations by the Committee of 15,
followed by another referendum, is
going to produce a different result."
Cunningham said that C-15
members will hold a meeting next
week to present the new proposal to
the community. "It's a complicated
document and it deserves explanation
and discussion," she said.
Smith said it will be "good for the
students to go through" the issues,
whether or not they approve this
specific proposal. As fewer political
activity cases have come before the
CJP in recent years, the judiciary
system has faded as an issue.

Last year's C-15 met once and
disbanded, according to Cunningham.
Herman reported that C-15 members
in the past have had trouble working
together, because either the student or
faculty representatives came to the
meetings with "demands" instead of
"proposals."
"I tend to think that if the students
and the Daily take a good clear look at
what we're presenting ... they will
realize that this solution is the best
possible compromise," he said.
The Committee of 15 (C-15) agreed
on a proposal for a reform of the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) last
night, but senior Kathy Cunningham,
C-15 chairperson, refused to discuss
the details until President Richard
Lyman has seen the plan.
Lyman left for the Middle East in
March, and Cunningham said he is
expected back tomorrow.
"Because the request for an
investigation of the CJP came from
President Lyman, it would be
unfortunate if he read about it in the
Daily before we submitted our actual
report," Cunningham said.
Before the Committee's meeting
last night, it was rumored that the
C-15 would propose a new judicial
system featuring three students, three
faculty members and co-chairmen —
one student and one law school
professor — neither of whom would
vote unless there were a tie.
If a tie vote occurs in an Honor
Code case, the student co-chairman
would break the tie, according to the

rumor. The other co-chairman would
break the tie in all other cases.
The current Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) has three students, three faculty
members and a chairman from the law
school who votes in case of a tie in all
cases. President Richard Lyman
created the CJP in 1971 after the
ASSU Senate refused to nominate
students to a committee which would
select students for the then-operative
Stanford Judicial Council.
Under the new proposal, it was
reported, the faculty members would
continue to oe appointed by the
Faculty Senate, while student
members would either be selected at
random or chosen by the ASSU
Committee on Nominations.
The C-15 was created in March
1965 and charged with outlining a
judicial system acceptable to the
administration, faculty and students.
ASSU President and C-15 member
Mike Herman, prior to last night's
meeting, outlined the three main
points of controversy as:
— the configuration of the CJP,
which has had essentially a
faculty-administration majority since
1965.
— the selection process for
members. Currently, faculty members
are selected by the Faculty Senate,
while student representatives are
chosen by random selection.
— the role of the dean of student
affairs. Students brought to the
President's Office on disciplinary
charges now have the option of a
hearing before either the CJP or the
dean of students. Herman said that 17
of the last 18 cases have been handled
by the dean.
Needs Lyman OK
In order to take effect, the new
system must be approved by President
Lyman, the Academic Senate and
either the ASSU Senate or the student
body as a whole.
The last proposal presented by the
C-15, in spring 1973, was forwarded
by the Senate to the students, who
overwhelmingly rejected it. C-15
member W. Randy Smith said that the

feeling in the Senate has usually been
that the CJP is "too important an issue
for that small a group to decide."

members and a chairman from the law
school who votes in case of a tie in all
cases. President Richard Lyman
created the CJP in 1971 after the
ASSU Senate refused to nominate
students to a committee which would
select students for the then-operative
Stanford Judicial Council.
Under the new proposal, it was
reported, the faculty members would
continue to oe appointed by the
Faculty Senate, while student
members would either be selected at
random or chosen by the ASSU
Committee on Nominations.
The C-15 was created in March
1965 and charged with outlining a
judicial system acceptable to the
administration, faculty and students.
ASSU President and C-15 member
Mike Herman, prior to last night's
meeting, outlined the three main
points of controversy as:
— the configuration of the CJP,
which has had essentially a
faculty-administration majority since
1965.
— the selection process for
members. Currently, faculty members
are selected by the Faculty Senate,
while student representatives are
chosen by random selection.
— the role of the dean of student
affairs. Students brought to the
President's Office on disciplinary
charges now have the option of a
hearing before either the CJP or the
dean of students. Herman said that 17
of the last 18 cases have been handled
by the dean.
Needs Lyman OK
In order to take effect, the new
system must be approved by President
Lyman, the Academic Senate and
either the ASSU Senate or the student
body as a whole.
The last proposal presented by the
C-15, in spring 1973, was forwarded
by the Senate to the students, who
overwhelmingly rejected it. C-15
member W. Randy Smith said that the

feeling in the Senate has usually been
that the CJP is "too important an issue
for that small a group to decide."
Cunningham predicted that the
question would be presented in the
upcoming ASSU elections.
Students Opposed
The 1973 proposal called for a
majority on the Panel. At
the time, several student groups,
including the Council of Presidents,
opposed the plan because the student
majority could have been revoked at
any time by the University President, a
two-thirds vote of the Academic
Senate or a two-thirds vote of the
ASSU Senate.
Herman said that the 1973 defeat
was partially caused by the fact that
only one student who had helped
develop the proposal was still at the
University to defend it when the issue
finally came to a vote.
Following the defeat of the 1973
proposal, Lyman was quoted as saying,
"I don't think that another year of
deliberations by the Committee of 15,
followed by another referendum, is
going to produce a different result."
Cunningham said that C-15
members will hold a meeting next
week to present the new proposal to
the community. "It's a complicated
document and it deserves explanation
and discussion," she said.
Smith said it will be "good for the
students to go through" the issues,
whether or not they approve this
specific proposal. As fewer political
activity cases have come before the
CJP in recent years, the judiciary
system has faded as an issue.

Last year's C-15 met once and
disbanded, according to Cunningham.
Herman reported that C-15 members
in the past have had trouble working
together, because either the student or
faculty representatives came to the
meetings with "demands" instead of
"proposals."
"I tend to think that if the students
and the Daily take a good clear look at
what we're presenting ... they will
realize that this solution is the best
possible compromise," he said.
