# Thieu Coup Plot Thwarted
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) - The South
Vietnamese government said today it
had arrested several military officers
for allegedly plotting to overthrow
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
Calls for Thieu's downfall have
swept Saigon as South Vietnam's
military situation worsened. With
50,000 Communist-led troops massed
only 45 to 55 miles away from Saigon,
Thieu's government issued
shoot-to-kill orders to maintain
security in the capital.
It was the second such roundup of
alleged coup plotters in a week. One
week ago, the Interior Ministry said
eight persons were arrested for
plotting against the president.
Meanwhile, in San Diego, President
Ford said yesterday evening that Thieu
ordered an "improper and unnecessary
withdrawal" of his troops from the
central provinces.
Ford made the statement in a
private meeting with 51 news and
broadcast executives.
He prefaced his remarks about

Thieu with the statement, "I guess this
should be off the record," but word
leaked out to members of the national
news media.
"The unilateral military decision to
withdraw created a chaotic situation in
Vietnam that appears to have brought
about tremendous disorganization,"
said Ford.
At an earlier news conference
yesterday Ford had said that the
deteriorating situation in Indochina is
"a great tragedy ... that could have
been avoided," but "at the moment I
do not anticipate the fall of South
Vietnam."
Speaking of his "frustration" over
congressional limits on his freedom of
action, Ford nevertheless said."l am an
optimist."
More than 5000 persons, including
scores of boisterous protestors,
cheered and booed President Ford
yesterday as he walked across the street
to the San Diego Convention Hall for
the news conference.
