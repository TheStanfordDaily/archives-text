# Faculty Senate Actions Augur D Grade Return
## 
### FRANK MARKOWITZ 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
indicated approval of
recommendations which would
reinstate the D grade while allowing
students to drop a course any time
before the final.
On two very close votes, the Senate
denied motions which would have
rejected those recommendations,
presented in the grading policy report
of the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA).
The final decision on whether to
accept the report as a whole will be
made at a future meeting.
The motion by Asst. English Prof.
David Riggs to "instruct the
Committee to strike Recommendation
One" — which advocated return of the
D — failed on a close voice vote.
The C-AAA advocated the D as a
means of fighting "grade inflation,"
arguing that even though the D
"would probably not be much
used ... its mere existence might be
an incentive to move the distribution
of grades downward from the present
concentration at the upper end."

Provost William Miller voiced
concern that grade inflation is forcing
graduate schools to rely more heavily
on indicators other than grades, such
as entrance examinations. Eventually,
he suggested, this may encourage
colleges to mold their curricula to the
tests.
Knowing The Ropes
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal agreed.
"I have seen students unable to get
into Stanford Law School because
they simply didn't know enough to
drop a couple of courses in which they
got C's early in their first year," he
said.
However, Religious Studies Prof.
William Clebsch argued in favor of
dropping the entire letter grade
system. As a replacement he suggested
"pass/honors pass/no credit"
designations, with only the passing
grades appearing on the transcript.
Letter grades "really are very
arbitrary — and the finer [the
distinction between grades), the more
arbitrary," he added.
Senate Chairman Gordon Craig
broke a 20-20 Senate deadlock and

voted down a Friedenthal motion
asking the C-AAA to suggest an early
drop deadline date. The C-AAA had
gone the opposite route in its report,
recommending elimination of even the
current 24-hours-before-the-final
deadline.
The vote followed a lengthy and
somewhat heated debate over the
abuses of the drop system.
Assoc. History Prof. David
Kennedy complained about students
who drop classes without notifying the
professor, thus leaving the students'
status in limbo.
Costly System
The present open-drop system also
allows students to enroll in more
classes than they plan to take,
resulting in costly over-scheduling of
sections and labs, several professors
charged.
C-AAA member Marion Smith,
adjunct neurology professor, defended
the current drop system, based on
talks with students.
"Quite a few of them said that this
was one of the attractive features of
Stanford ... an opportunity to do
some academic adventuring without
being penalized." She suggested that
an earlier deadline would cause many
insecure students to drop classes even
before they could assess their chances
of success.
C-AAA Proposals
The C-AAA report also proposed:
— abandoning the practice of
routinely computing each student's
grade average for internal office use;
— regular collection and publication
by the Registrar's Office of grade
distributions in the various schools of
the University; and
— that the Registrar "should
publicize widely both the regulations
concerning the pass option and the
approach of each quarter's final
deadline for choosing it."
