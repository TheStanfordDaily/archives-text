# Irish Won't Appeal, Takes Wichita Post
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry Irish revealed yesterday that he will not
appeal his tenure case to President Richard Lyman after Provost William Miller's
upholding of the Appointments and Promotions (A&P) Committee's decision to
deny him tenure.
Irish also told the Daily that he has accepted a tenured position as head of the
Religious Studies Department at Wichita State University.
According to Irish and Miller, Lyman in the past has virtually always upheld
the Provost's decisions on tenure appeals.
Irish explained that he would not appeal to Lyman primarily because he
expected Lyman, like Miller, to consult only A&P Committee members rather
than consider the opinions of other faculty members and students.
"You'd think that somewhere in the appeal process, there would be some
way to take a broader view of the situation by consulting people other than the
six professors who serve on the A&P Committee," Irish said.
Students Qualified
Irish contended that his colleagues in the Religious Studies Department and
his students are well qualified to discuss his case and should have been consulted
in the appeal process.
"Contrary to the defensive claims of some, students do not merely equate
excellence in teaching with lengthy office hours and personal acquaintance, nor

in their excitement about what they
have learned in a particular course,"
Irish declared in a statement prepared
for the local press.
Irish said he was enthused about his
appointment to Wichita State.
Excites Him
"Some things about the
appointment really excite me," Irish
said. "I hope to develop a religious
studies program accessible to all
undergraduates and to the community.
It will be nice to be at a school that
encourages the type of thing that I like
to do."
Noting that Wichita State is the
only major center of higher learning in
an area of 300,000 people, Irish said
he hoped to encourage his department
to serve the general community.
Irish expressed disappointment,
however, about leaving Stanford.
'Disheartening'
"This is, indeed, a disheartening
climax to eight years of work at
Stanford," Irish said in his statement.
"Though well aware that I am not a
perfect teacher and that my
publications are not beyond reproach,
I remain convinced that I am qualified
to teach and conduct my research at
Stanford by its own stated criteria."
Irish, the winner of the 1971 Gores
Award for excellence in teaching, told
the Daily later that his published work
is of greater quality and quantity than
that for which the A&P Committee
and Miller gave it credit.
According to Irish, the A&P
Committee wrongly evaluated his
work, and administrators were
unwilling to admit that a mistake had
been made.
