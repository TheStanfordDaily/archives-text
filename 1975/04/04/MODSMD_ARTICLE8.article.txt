## Opinions editorial Offensive Choice 
### 
Last quarter, we editorialized against the selection of
Harvard Prof. Daniel P. Moynihan as commencement
speaker, on the grounds that Moynihan would likely be an
uninteresting speaker, and that he was selected without
sufficient input from the senior class.
Since then, a great majority of black graduating seniors
and members of the Anthropology Department here has
protested Moynihan's selection because of the dubious
nature of his scholarship and because of certain remarks he
has made which they consider offensive.
Moynihan's fame appears to rest largely on his writings
that the problems of black Americans are due to "the
breakdown of the Negro family," and his subsequent
recommendation that race relations in the United States
would be improved by a period of "benign neglect."
While controversial views such as these deserve to be
heard, Moynihan's statements have made him unacceptable
to the black community here, according to a statement
signed by all but seven graduating black seniors.
In addition, 12 of the 15 Anthropology Department
faculty members and 23 of the department's 30 graduate
students have signed a document criticizing Moynihan's
scholarship.
We have no way of evaluating Moynihan's scholarship
ourselves. But in a case like this, the opinons of such a great
majority of scholars seem to indicate that the persons who
selected Moynihan failed to seek informed opinion about his
scholarship.
For these additional reasons, we reiterate our position
that Moynihan should not have been invited. In order to
avoid similar disputes in the future, the University should
consult as large a number of students and faculty as possible
before choosing a commencement speaker.
