# On Parking Study
## 
### 
I was shocked to read the April
1 Daily editorial appraising and
commending the Carpenter
parking report. I suppose that the
Daily (and others) were taken in
by all the rhetoric and catch
phrases. How can one object to a)
zero-sum, b) making users pay, c)
encouraging biking and walking, d)
protecting the environment, e)
discouraging auto use and 112)
dividing costs to those who
benefit? Unfortunately, most of
the Carpenter report is
propaganda and a smoke screen
for what is really taking place and
what will actually happen.
The zero-sum argument is
fallacious, for the University
intends to collect many thousands
of extra dollars from its students
and employees. While it is true
that a trust fund is planned for
traffic services, I do not know
what this will go for since traffic
services are already paid for in the
general budget. A true zero-sum
game would have the trust fund
substitute for the general budget
expenditures and the surplus so
created would be rebated to those
who pay in the first case, the
students and employees.
If the University is truly
interested in being fair rather than
stealing every cent within reach, it
would decrease student residence
rents and increase wages by an
amount equal to what it collects
under its parking fees. This way
auto use would be discouraged
without a windfall for the
University.

William Hoke

Discouraging auto use is quite
different from discouraging auto
ownership, but this is exactly
what the report confuses. Owning
an automobile is no sin, although
using it excessively or
unnecessarily may be. Students in
their residences have no choice
but to park near their home.
Taking public transportation or
riding a bike is irrelevant. Since
students who own cars have no
choice in where to park, the
parking fee does not discourage
cars but is merely punitive.
Parking is a service one should pay
for, but if the University removes
the benefits of parking from
student residences (remember the
cost of the parking next to
student residences is included in
the residence's budget and thus
the rent), the University should
make up for this by a reduction in
the rent.
It is obvious that parking is a
matter of great concern in this
University community and that
any plan must be acceptable to
students and employees. But the
University seems intent on
reaching its decision unilaterally,
too much like a sovereign
government. Students and
employees must join to resist the
administration's acceptance of the
Carpenter report — "with
modifications," as they most
probably will do at the end of
April.

It is obvious that parking is a
matter of great concern in this
University community and that
any plan must be acceptable to
students and employees. But the
University seems intent on
reaching its decision unilaterally,
too much like a sovereign
government. Students and
employees must join to resist the
administration's acceptance of the
Carpenter report — "with
modifications," as they most
probably will do at the end of
April.

in the School of Education, is an

I was shocked to read the April
1 Daily editorial appraising and
commending the Carpenter
parking report. I suppose that the
Daily (and others) were taken in
by all the rhetoric and catch
phrases. How can one object to a)
zero-sum, b) making users pay, c)
encouraging biking and walking, d)
protecting the environment, e)
discouraging auto use and 112)
dividing costs to those who
benefit? Unfortunately, most of
the Carpenter report is
propaganda and a smoke screen
for what is really taking place and
what will actually happen.
The zero-sum argument is
fallacious, for the University
intends to collect many thousands
of extra dollars from its students
and employees. While it is true
that a trust fund is planned for
traffic services, I do not know
what this will go for since traffic
services are already paid for in the
general budget. A true zero-sum
game would have the trust fund
substitute for the general budget
expenditures and the surplus so
created would be rebated to those
who pay in the first case, the
students and employees.
If the University is truly
interested in being fair rather than
stealing every cent within reach, it
would decrease student residence
rents and increase wages by an
amount equal to what it collects
under its parking fees. This way
auto use would be discouraged
without a windfall for the
University.

Discouraging auto use is quite
different from discouraging auto
ownership, but this is exactly
what the report confuses. Owning
an automobile is no sin, although
using it excessively or
unnecessarily may be. Students in
their residences have no choice
but to park near their home.
Taking public transportation or
riding a bike is irrelevant. Since
students who own cars have no
choice in where to park, the
parking fee does not discourage
cars but is merely punitive.
Parking is a service one should pay
for, but if the University removes
the benefits of parking from
student residences (remember the
cost of the parking next to
student residences is included in
the residence's budget and thus
the rent), the University should
make up for this by a reduction in
the rent.
