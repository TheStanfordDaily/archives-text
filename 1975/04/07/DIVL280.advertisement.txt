CHANGABANG
AN ILLUSTRATED LECTURE
BY
DOUG SCOTT
Longstaff, Smythe, Shipton and Tilman all sang the praises of the fabulous Garhwal Himalayas They climbed Trisal
and Nanda Devi, but left the great sharks tooth of rough white granite in the centre of all the glacier system The local
Bhotia hillmen named it Changabang and it attracted the attention of the climbing world as a last great virgin peak
In June 1974 Chris Bonington, Martin Boysen, Dougal Haston, Doug Scott and a number of Indian climbers set off up
the famous Rishi Gorge to climb it.
After many adventures along the precipitous hillsides, living on rhubarb, contracting lice they at last reached the foot
of the mountain only to find they were in the wrong valley for they were confronted by 7,000 of vertical rock plastered
in hard green ice. Boysen and Scott found a way out, over a 1,500 wall onto the Changabang Glacier at 14,000 The
four British and two Indians went over this barrier and made camp under the ice of the East face of Changabang After
a three day storm they continued the "hike" towards the top carrying tents and three days food After negotiating
vertical ice steps with pegs a top camp was reached from where 20 roped pitches lead up an elegant knife edged arete
to the summit at 22,550' After a 20 hour day they regained their tents and returned to base camp after six days
absence.
Sir Jack Longland, in his summary of the years events to the Alpine Club gave pride of place to this expedition It was
certainly a "happy" trip and good relations were established with the Indian mountaineers This'area is now being
opened to other expeditions after a twenty years ban. It is an area bristling with unclimbed peaks not to mention fine
buttresses and faces for the alpinist and big wall men.
But it is more than that as the lecturer will show as he takes you sensitively and humourously for an hour or more into
the spiritual home of the Hindu people, through the quiet forests, across grassy alps covered in flowers and up into
some of the most breathtaking scenery in all the Himalayas.
Lecture audiences in Britain have frequently paid tribute to the slide collection as being the finest they have ever seen
We feel sure you will enjoy them as much
The lecturer has climbed in Kurdestan, Tibesti, Hindu Kush, Baffin Island, Yosemite, The Alps, The Pamirs and on
Mount Everest's South West Face

Sir Jack Longland, in his summary of the years events to the Alpine Club gave pride of place to this expedition It was
certainly a "happy" trip and good relations were established with the Indian mountaineers This'area is now being
opened to other expeditions after a twenty years ban. It is an area bristling with unclimbed peaks not to mention fine
buttresses and faces for the alpinist and big wall men.
But it is more than that as the lecturer will show as he takes you sensitively and humourously for an hour or more into
the spiritual home of the Hindu people, through the quiet forests, across grassy alps covered in flowers and up into
some of the most breathtaking scenery in all the Himalayas.
Lecture audiences in Britain have frequently paid tribute to the slide collection as being the finest they have ever seen
We feel sure you will enjoy them as much
The lecturer has climbed in Kurdestan, Tibesti, Hindu Kush, Baffin Island, Yosemite, The Alps, The Pamirs and on
Mount Everest's South West Face

CHANGABANG
AN ILLUSTRATED LECTURE
BY
DOUG SCOTT
Longstaff, Smythe, Shipton and Tilman all sang the praises of the fabulous Garhwal Himalayas They climbed Trisal
and Nanda Devi, but left the great sharks tooth of rough white granite in the centre of all the glacier system The local
Bhotia hillmen named it Changabang and it attracted the attention of the climbing world as a last great virgin peak
In June 1974 Chris Bonington, Martin Boysen, Dougal Haston, Doug Scott and a number of Indian climbers set off up
the famous Rishi Gorge to climb it.
After many adventures along the precipitous hillsides, living on rhubarb, contracting lice they at last reached the foot
of the mountain only to find they were in the wrong valley for they were confronted by 7,000 of vertical rock plastered
in hard green ice. Boysen and Scott found a way out, over a 1,500 wall onto the Changabang Glacier at 14,000 The
four British and two Indians went over this barrier and made camp under the ice of the East face of Changabang After
a three day storm they continued the "hike" towards the top carrying tents and three days food After negotiating
vertical ice steps with pegs a top camp was reached from where 20 roped pitches lead up an elegant knife edged arete
to the summit at 22,550' After a 20 hour day they regained their tents and returned to base camp after six days
absence.
