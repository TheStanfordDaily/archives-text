# Bookstore Expansion Considered For TMU
## 
### BOB ZUCKERMAN 
The Stanford Bookstore could open
an extension in Tresidder Memorial
Union (TMU), occupying space now
used by the Transition, the kitchen
and part of the basement, if Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Dan Williams
has his way.
Williams, TMU director, said he
thinks a Bookstore extension is the
best way to solve Tresidder's chronic
financial difficulties. The operation
has lost hundreds of thousands of
dollars in recent years.
The Transition, the fast-food
service which took the place of the
failing TMU cafeteria in September, is
"a killer" financially and must be

replaced by next fall, he said.
"Our latest projection says
[Tresidder] still could lose as much as
$50,000 by the end of next fiscal year
because of it."
In addition, Williams said, the space
now occupied by the Transition can
"never carry itself as a food operation.
There's just not the market for it."
Tresidder "could break even next
year" if it had "a straight lease
agreement" with the Bookstore,
Williams claimed.
Looking For Space
The Bookstore is currently looking
for 15,000 square feet of additional
space, he said.
However, although the Bookstore's
board of directors is looking into
extending its facilities, its "first
choice" is an expansion of the current
building rather than a move into
Tresidder, according to Eldon Speed,
Bookstore general manager.
Costs and plans for a Bookstore
move to Tresidder are currently being
studied by the University Planning
Office, Speed said, adding that the
office will report its findings to him
"within three months." The Bookstore
board of directors will decide on
expansion at that time, he said.
TDS Negotiations
Meanwhile, according to Williams,
the University is negotiating a contract
with TDS Inc., a food service
company, to run the entire Tresidder
Food Service, which includes Encina
Commons, the Transition, the Coffee
House, Tresidder catering service and
athletic team meals.
The Transition would not be part
of the agreement if the Bookstore
move goes through, and William's
statements indicate its future is bleak
in any case.
TDS is currently running the
Tresidder Food Service under a
temporary agreement.
Best Offer
TDS made the University the best
offer in bidding procedures for the
permanent contract approximately a
month ago, Williams said. Two other
food service companies, ARA Slater
and Saga, participated in that bidding.
"We are now talking about specific
parts" of the contract, and "shooting
for a written agreement by May 1,"
Williams said.
If the Bookstore decides against a
move into Tresidder, the University
will consider its previous plans for
TMU, Williams said.
These plans include enlarging
Marcel's pastry shop, and adding a
Baskin-Robbins ice cream franchise,
various clothing stores and a flower
shop.
"Plans on that front are shelved
until we find out what the Bookstore
is going to do." Williams stressed.
On-Campus Pub
The University is still "committed
to building" an on-campus pub, he
added, but only if the food service
company that will operate it obtains a
liquor license.
If the Upiversity reaches an
agreement with TDS on the Tresidder
Food Service, that company could
apply for a liquor license by summer.
Williams noted. However, he warned
that a liquor license may not be issued
by the Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control (ABC) for as long as
a year.
