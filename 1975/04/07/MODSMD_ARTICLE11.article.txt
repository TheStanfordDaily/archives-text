# Commitment To Minorities Declining?
## 
### 
Late last quarter, 10 spokespersons from
Students for Equity met with President
Richard Lyman and three other top-level
administrators to discuss the University's
commitment to the minority population at
Stanford. Our discussion focused on the
proposed revision in minority financial aid
packaging and we discussed the nature of the
University's minority commitment in
general.
The representatives from Students for
Equity did not enter the meeting with the
expectations of changing anyone's mind.
Rather, we viewed the discussion as a chance
for both sides to articulate the problems
which underlie the specific issue.
Since the controversy began, the
University has consistently reiterated its
commitment to minorities, but until our
meeting the administrators had never
explicitly described the substance of that
commitment — of what does it consist?
Lyman answered that the University was
committed to the promotion of equality of
opportunity and diversity within the student
body.
' Ethnic Diversity, Too?
While he refused to fit "diversity" with a
specific definition (he reminded us that it
could mean a number of things) he suggested
that diversity within the student body was
beneficial for all. We can only assume that
Lyman was referring to both ethnic and

socio-economic diversity.
While the administration's official stance
is that the new plan will have no effect on
the composition of the minority population
at Stanford, it has been suggested by certain
top level administrators that, in fact, the new
package carries definite implication for the
socio-economic diversity of the minority
community, i.e. that low-income minority
students will be discouraged from attending
Stanford and that the minority population
will show an increasing disproportionate
upper income character. While he denied that
this definitely would happen, Lyman
admitted that it was a possibility.
That policy obviously conflicts with the
basic principles of the administration's
professed commitment — equality of
opportunity and diversity within the student
body.
Opportunity For All
Equality of opportunity means
opportunity for all, regardless of race or
socio-economic background. If certain
persons are being excluded from the
opportunities offered by this institution
solely because they are from a low-income
background, then the administration's goal is
not being realized. We asked Lyman the
following questions:
If the new package were found to have a
deleterious effect on the socio-economic
diversity of the population at Stanford,

Loren Bloch

would the University re-evaluate its plan to
make it consistent with its commitment? He
did not answer our question. Such a response
can only nurture doubts about the
University's commitment to all low-income
students.
The meeting continued with some
discussion of budget priorities. One of the
University's basic justifications for cutbacks
in the minority programs is that Stanford is
presently undergoing a period of financial
strain.
We then stated that we recognize the
University's predicament, and we understand
the need for cutbacks.
However, we also pointed out that given a
finite set of resources, they must be
distributed in such a way as to be reflective
of the University's priorities. We can only
conclude that if the minority programs are
not very high on the administration's priority
list, the University's commitment must not
be too strong.
In conclusion, we contend that the
meeting was a constructive one in that the
University articulated to some extent the
philosophy which underlies its position with
respect to minorities at Stanford. However, it
must be noted that it only served to increase
our doubts as to the credibility of the
University's professed commitment.

commitment — of what does it consist?
Lyman answered that the University was
committed to the promotion of equality of
opportunity and diversity within the student
body.
' Ethnic Diversity, Too?
While he refused to fit "diversity" with a
specific definition (he reminded us that it
could mean a number of things) he suggested
that diversity within the student body was
beneficial for all. We can only assume that
Lyman was referring to both ethnic and

socio-economic diversity.
While the administration's official stance
is that the new plan will have no effect on
the composition of the minority population
at Stanford, it has been suggested by certain
top level administrators that, in fact, the new
package carries definite implication for the
socio-economic diversity of the minority
community, i.e. that low-income minority
students will be discouraged from attending
Stanford and that the minority population
will show an increasing disproportionate
upper income character. While he denied that
this definitely would happen, Lyman
admitted that it was a possibility.
That policy obviously conflicts with the
basic principles of the administration's
professed commitment — equality of
opportunity and diversity within the student
body.
Opportunity For All
Equality of opportunity means
opportunity for all, regardless of race or
socio-economic background. If certain
persons are being excluded from the
opportunities offered by this institution
solely because they are from a low-income
background, then the administration's goal is
not being realized. We asked Lyman the
following questions:
If the new package were found to have a
deleterious effect on the socio-economic
diversity of the population at Stanford,

Loren Bloch

would the University re-evaluate its plan to
make it consistent with its commitment? He
did not answer our question. Such a response
can only nurture doubts about the
University's commitment to all low-income
students.
The meeting continued with some
discussion of budget priorities. One of the
University's basic justifications for cutbacks
in the minority programs is that Stanford is
presently undergoing a period of financial
strain.
We then stated that we recognize the
University's predicament, and we understand
the need for cutbacks.
However, we also pointed out that given a
finite set of resources, they must be
distributed in such a way as to be reflective
of the University's priorities. We can only
conclude that if the minority programs are
not very high on the administration's priority
list, the University's commitment must not
be too strong.
In conclusion, we contend that the
meeting was a constructive one in that the
University articulated to some extent the
philosophy which underlies its position with
respect to minorities at Stanford. However, it
must be noted that it only served to increase
our doubts as to the credibility of the
University's professed commitment.

Late last quarter, 10 spokespersons from
Students for Equity met with President
Richard Lyman and three other top-level
administrators to discuss the University's
commitment to the minority population at
Stanford. Our discussion focused on the
proposed revision in minority financial aid
packaging and we discussed the nature of the
University's minority commitment in
general.
The representatives from Students for
Equity did not enter the meeting with the
expectations of changing anyone's mind.
Rather, we viewed the discussion as a chance
for both sides to articulate the problems
which underlie the specific issue.
Since the controversy began, the
University has consistently reiterated its
commitment to minorities, but until our
meeting the administrators had never
explicitly described the substance of that
commitment — of what does it consist?
