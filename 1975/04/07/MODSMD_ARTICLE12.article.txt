# Citizens Unite To Outgun Gun Lobby!
## 
### John Freed 
"A new voice will soon be heard in
Washington's 'gun lobby,' " Newsweek
magazine reported late last month. The
group, called United Sportsmen of America
(USA), says that the old professional
lobbyists weren't doing a good enough job.
USA's planned membership campaign will
use the slogan, "Is Your Firearm Worth a
Dollar?" It will join the National Rifle
Association (NRA) in opposing action which
is presently being considered by the federal
Consumer Products Safety Commission
(CPSC).
The action would ban the sale of handgun
ammunition as a hazardous substance.
NRA members (and now, presumably, the
USA) are inundating the Commission with
pro-bullet mail. But an amateur group, the
Committee for Handgun Control, has been
behind the effort to stop bullet sales.
Harmful Bullets
The Committee, founded by four
housewives from wealthy Chicago suburbs,
argues that:
—bullets are indeed a hazardous product,
often found in the home;
—they harm far more persons than unsafe
cribs or faulty lawnmowers banned by the
CPSC;
—therefore, the CPSC is legally bound to
ban handgun bullets (Chicago Tribune, March
21).
In fact, handguns cause 75 percent of
armed violence in the United States—7o
percent of all murders of policemen.
Pro-Gun Arguments
The primary arguments of the pro-gun
forces run along two lines:
—"if handguns are outlawed, only outlaws
will own handguns," and

—the Constitutional right to bear arms
cannot be revoked.
The first argument is patently ridiculous.
Consider the same argument, with "heroin"
substituted for "handguns":
"If heroin is outlawed, only outlaws will
own heroin."
So what?, is my response to both lines of
reasoning.
The Constitutional defense is based on
kneejerk reactions and misguided reasoning.

The Second Amendment guaranteeing the
"right to bear Arms" was proposed to assure
Americans of self-defense in case either the
national defense structure collapsed or in
case the government leaders decided to turn
the federal armada on the citizenry. Muskets
were considered sufficient defensive weapons
then.
But in 1975, even bazookas and tanks
aren't sufficient to defend the home against
thermonuclear warheads. The private citizen,
therefore, needs the deterrent of an H-bomb.
Amateurs Not Trustworthy
There are those who would sit in an ivory
tower of libertarianism and defend the sale of
H-bombs in gun stores. I cannot agree.
For so long as Congress bans the sale of

nuclear devices, tanks, machine guns,
bazookas and hand grenades, the sale of
Saturday-night specials should be illegal.
Handguns are far too dangerous to be
entrusted to amateurs.
Outright abolition of handgun sales is
unlikely, however, given the pressure-cooker
of Washington lobby politics. With yet
another pro-gun lobby entering the scene,
complete with professional lobbyists, the
chances of success for even the modest
anti-bullet proposal look bleak.
But the Committee for Handgun Control
(CHC) remains optimistic, soliciting
contributions and urging citizens to write to
the Consumer Product Safety Commission
before the April 15 deadline for comments.
"We're not trying to change anyone's
mind about gun control," says Susan
Sullivan, president of CHC. "Polls show 85
percent of people want strong gun control,
and we are just trying to get the Consumer
Product Safety Commission — or Congress —
to do what the majority of people really
want."
It took CHC 18 months and a successful
lawsuit just to get the Commission to
consider banning bullets. Its proposals,
commendably, do not include long-gun
bullets or ammunition for police, the
military, security guards or licensed pistol
clubs.
Can an amateur group headed by
suburban Chicago housewives outgun the
NRA and USA?
Its leaders think it can, if enough
concerned persons tell the CPSC in
Washington.

"A new voice will soon be heard in
Washington's 'gun lobby,' " Newsweek
magazine reported late last month. The
group, called United Sportsmen of America
(USA), says that the old professional
lobbyists weren't doing a good enough job.
USA's planned membership campaign will
use the slogan, "Is Your Firearm Worth a
Dollar?" It will join the National Rifle
Association (NRA) in opposing action which
is presently being considered by the federal
Consumer Products Safety Commission
(CPSC).
The action would ban the sale of handgun
ammunition as a hazardous substance.
NRA members (and now, presumably, the
USA) are inundating the Commission with
pro-bullet mail. But an amateur group, the
Committee for Handgun Control, has been
behind the effort to stop bullet sales.
Harmful Bullets
The Committee, founded by four
housewives from wealthy Chicago suburbs,
argues that:
—bullets are indeed a hazardous product,
often found in the home;
—they harm far more persons than unsafe
cribs or faulty lawnmowers banned by the
CPSC;
—therefore, the CPSC is legally bound to
ban handgun bullets (Chicago Tribune, March
21).
In fact, handguns cause 75 percent of
armed violence in the United States—7o
percent of all murders of policemen.
Pro-Gun Arguments
The primary arguments of the pro-gun
forces run along two lines:
—"if handguns are outlawed, only outlaws
will own handguns," and

—the Constitutional right to bear arms
cannot be revoked.
The first argument is patently ridiculous.
Consider the same argument, with "heroin"
substituted for "handguns":
"If heroin is outlawed, only outlaws will
own heroin."
So what?, is my response to both lines of
reasoning.
The Constitutional defense is based on
kneejerk reactions and misguided reasoning.

The Second Amendment guaranteeing the
"right to bear Arms" was proposed to assure
Americans of self-defense in case either the
national defense structure collapsed or in
case the government leaders decided to turn
the federal armada on the citizenry. Muskets
were considered sufficient defensive weapons
then.
But in 1975, even bazookas and tanks
aren't sufficient to defend the home against
thermonuclear warheads. The private citizen,
therefore, needs the deterrent of an H-bomb.
Amateurs Not Trustworthy
There are those who would sit in an ivory
tower of libertarianism and defend the sale of
H-bombs in gun stores. I cannot agree.
For so long as Congress bans the sale of

nuclear devices, tanks, machine guns,
bazookas and hand grenades, the sale of
Saturday-night specials should be illegal.
Handguns are far too dangerous to be
entrusted to amateurs.
Outright abolition of handgun sales is
unlikely, however, given the pressure-cooker
of Washington lobby politics. With yet
another pro-gun lobby entering the scene,
complete with professional lobbyists, the
chances of success for even the modest
anti-bullet proposal look bleak.
But the Committee for Handgun Control
(CHC) remains optimistic, soliciting
contributions and urging citizens to write to
the Consumer Product Safety Commission
before the April 15 deadline for comments.
"We're not trying to change anyone's
mind about gun control," says Susan
Sullivan, president of CHC. "Polls show 85
percent of people want strong gun control,
and we are just trying to get the Consumer
Product Safety Commission — or Congress —
to do what the majority of people really
want."
It took CHC 18 months and a successful
lawsuit just to get the Commission to
consider banning bullets. Its proposals,
commendably, do not include long-gun
bullets or ammunition for police, the
military, security guards or licensed pistol
clubs.
Can an amateur group headed by
suburban Chicago housewives outgun the
NRA and USA?
Its leaders think it can, if enough
concerned persons tell the CPSC in
Washington.
