# Parking Plan Ignores Major Issues
## 
### 
Peter Carpenter's "Report on
Parking and Transportation"
recommending the
implementation of higher parking
fees for campus vehicles next year
simply fails to present a persuasive
rationale for the creation of
parking zones and fee levels.
Curiously, Carpenter does not
address the issue of what it costs
the University to provide parking
spaces for its employees and

students. At the end of his report
one is still wondering why this
much money is needed and how it
will be spent.
Instead, Carpenter presents his
recommendations as a behavior
modification scheme to achieve
the environmental goal of
de-emphasizing "the importance
of the private motor vehicle as the
primary mode of transportation."
In short, Carpenter wants to

"encourage" Stanford personnel
to leave their cars at home. His
proposal to create an "Academic
Zone" with an annual parking fee
of $60 may have that effect, but
the creation of a large "Free
Zone" certainly does not
discourage off-campus residents
from commuting by car. Even
more clearly, an annual fee of $48
for parking in a "Residence Zone"
around student residences does
nothing to discourage driving
from home to work since the fee
is assessed for parking at home
rather than at v/ork.
While a fee for parking in the
"Academic Zone" will discourage
on-campus residents from driving
their cars into the center of the
campus, a fee for "Residence
Zone" parking will not encourage
on-campus students to use
bicycles and to leave their car at
home but will penalize them.
Fee Not Justifiable
The argument that Carpenter
wants to make in defense of a
"Residence Zone" fee is that
on-campus students must pay for
the expense incurred in providing
them the benefit of parking near
their residence. As a principle this
is fine, but Carpenter's report
passes over the issue in a brief
paragraph because he knows he
cannot justify the fee he is
proposing in terms of that
principle. On-campus students
must recognize, Carpenter argues,
"That it is commonplace ... to
charge separately for parking."
Proof Is Needed
Since Carpenter cannot justify
a $48 "Residence Zone" fee on
the basis of reducing commuter
car traffic, and since he implies
that this fee covers the cost of
providing parking spaces for
student residents, it is time for
Carpenter and the administration
to face the issue honestly and

John Dibbern

provide the information necessary
to prove, if possible, that this fee
is required to offset the
construction costs of student
parking spaces, that it is not
duplicated in student rental
payments, and that it does not go
to maintain parking spaces which
students are forbidden to use.

Fee Not Justifiable
The argument that Carpenter
wants to make in defense of a
"Residence Zone" fee is that
on-campus students must pay for
the expense incurred in providing
them the benefit of parking near
their residence. As a principle this
is fine, but Carpenter's report
passes over the issue in a brief
paragraph because he knows he
cannot justify the fee he is
proposing in terms of that
principle. On-campus students
must recognize, Carpenter argues,
"That it is commonplace ... to
charge separately for parking."
Proof Is Needed
Since Carpenter cannot justify
a $48 "Residence Zone" fee on
the basis of reducing commuter
car traffic, and since he implies
that this fee covers the cost of
providing parking spaces for
student residents, it is time for
Carpenter and the administration
to face the issue honestly and

John Dibbern

provide the information necessary
to prove, if possible, that this fee
is required to offset the
construction costs of student
parking spaces, that it is not
duplicated in student rental
payments, and that it does not go
to maintain parking spaces which
students are forbidden to use.

in history, is a resident of
Escondido Village.)
Peter Carpenter's "Report on
Parking and Transportation"
recommending the
implementation of higher parking
fees for campus vehicles next year
simply fails to present a persuasive
rationale for the creation of
parking zones and fee levels.
Curiously, Carpenter does not
address the issue of what it costs
the University to provide parking
spaces for its employees and

students. At the end of his report
one is still wondering why this
much money is needed and how it
will be spent.
Instead, Carpenter presents his
recommendations as a behavior
modification scheme to achieve
the environmental goal of
de-emphasizing "the importance
of the private motor vehicle as the
primary mode of transportation."
In short, Carpenter wants to

"encourage" Stanford personnel
to leave their cars at home. His
proposal to create an "Academic
Zone" with an annual parking fee
of $60 may have that effect, but
the creation of a large "Free
Zone" certainly does not
discourage off-campus residents
from commuting by car. Even
more clearly, an annual fee of $48
for parking in a "Residence Zone"
around student residences does
nothing to discourage driving
from home to work since the fee
is assessed for parking at home
rather than at v/ork.
While a fee for parking in the
"Academic Zone" will discourage
on-campus residents from driving
their cars into the center of the
campus, a fee for "Residence
Zone" parking will not encourage
on-campus students to use
bicycles and to leave their car at
home but will penalize them.
