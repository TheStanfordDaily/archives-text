USE Dues Are Fair

Editor:
United Stanford Employees
(USE) union by-iaws provide for
fair and equitable payment of the
costs of operating the union. Dues
(for those protected by collective
bargaining) are one percent of
base pay and are based on what is
actually paid by Stanford.
If a member does not sign up
for dues deduction, then he or she
can pay cash to the union. But the
union does not see the paycheck,
so for all the years of USE's
existence, it has used the
published pay scale for jobs.
When people suffered a
reduced income (like leave
without pay), they came to the
union office and explained the
circumstances. This has happened
many times in past years.
Mario De Sousa (Daily, April
3), was told that there were three
ways to pay his dues, and it was
up to him to choose:
—dues deduction by the
employer;
—cash payment of published
scale; or
—cash payment with pay stub
explanation of money earned.
But apparently he came to the
union office not seeking an
explanation, but a chance to vent
his spleen. His abusive and
insulting behavior earned him an
invitation to leave, which he did,
claiming he wasn't going to be
pushed around. It was De Sousa
who wanted to fight.
There are several ways that any
grievance De Sousa may have
could have been addressed within
the union. Certainly, if there were
any substance to his charges, he
should raise them in the union,
both to protect the union and his
rights. But, to the best of my
knowledge, De Sousa has never
even attended a union meeting.
I think the interesting question
is who is behind De Sousa's
protest, coming as it does in the
closing days of the hospital
election campaign.

can pay cash to the union. But the
union does not see the paycheck,
so for all the years of USE's
existence, it has used the
published pay scale for jobs.
When people suffered a
reduced income (like leave
without pay), they came to the
union office and explained the
circumstances. This has happened
many times in past years.
Mario De Sousa (Daily, April
3), was told that there were three
ways to pay his dues, and it was
up to him to choose:
—dues deduction by the
employer;
—cash payment of published
scale; or
—cash payment with pay stub
explanation of money earned.
But apparently he came to the
union office not seeking an
explanation, but a chance to vent
his spleen. His abusive and
insulting behavior earned him an
invitation to leave, which he did,
claiming he wasn't going to be
pushed around. It was De Sousa
who wanted to fight.
There are several ways that any
grievance De Sousa may have
could have been addressed within
the union. Certainly, if there were
any substance to his charges, he
should raise them in the union,
both to protect the union and his
rights. But, to the best of my
knowledge, De Sousa has never
even attended a union meeting.
I think the interesting question
is who is behind De Sousa's
protest, coming as it does in the
closing days of the hospital
election campaign.
