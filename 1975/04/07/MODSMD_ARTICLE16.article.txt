## The 						Story Of Lake Lag--It Overflows With Alligators And Aquafollies 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
The days are long gone when
the only place males and females
could swim together on campus
was Lake Lagunita, and when the
boathouse deck was the place to
be on a warm spring afternoon.
Though students have managed
to find new ways to deal with the
idyllic spring weather here, much
of the Lake Lag mystique still
remains — at least until the end of
spring when its rippling waters
turn into a muddy puddle and
vanish into temporary oblivion.
According to legend. Lag dates
back to the days when University
land was still an alfalfa field used

to produce fodder for Leland
Stanford's prize horses. Sometime
in the early 1880s when the fields
were badly in need of water,
Stanford had a levee thrown up
on Los Trancos creek to create an
irrigation reservoir.
Mules And Scrapers
The lake bed, dug by mules
and scrapers, turned out to be too
porous for its intended purpose,
and Stanford decided to line it
with clay.
The story is that a Stanford
ranch hand happened to meet an
employee of a wholesale butcher
firm from San Francisco driving
500 sheep along Mayfield Road,

and the two hit upon the idea of
using the herd to trample the clay
into the lake bed.
Lake Lag as a campus social
hot spot did not come into being
until several years later — after the
University was founded and when
the first boathouse was built.
The boathouse was planned in
1892 after a campus rumor spread
that Senator Stanford would
finance a trip to the World's
Columbian Exposition in Chicago
the following year if the
University could train and enter a
crew team.
$400 Boathouse
The team never made it to
Chicago, but the $400 boathouse
built by students managed to last
until 1913, when a second
boathouse was constructed a few
yards away. It was during the gala
1938 Hydrofollies that the
balcony of the second boathouse
dropped into the water, spectators
and would-be rescuers following
close behind.
A new boathouse was built the
following year.
In its heyday, boathouse
number three (the one that stands
today) teemed with frolicking
students who sprawled en masse
on its expansive decks. And in
1947, a Daily reporter dubbed it

the "center of springtime social
life on the Farm."
Sinister Wild Life
At a time when campus pools
had restricted hours for "mixed
swimming," no one seemed to
care too much about the more
sinister wildlife residing in the
murky Lag waters. (The lake
water was condemned by a
University health officer just the
year before because it contained
dangerously high levels of
intestinal bacteria, attributed to
the lake's original users—the
horses.)
Generations of Stanford
students clothed and unclothed,
their canoes, an alligator, a 1937
Packard, and the balcony of the
old boathouse are among just a
few of the items the little lake has
floated or sunk in its 90-odd
years.
In the summer-fall
"off-season," the dry lake bed has
been host to the pyromaniacal
activities of football fans, to
gallons of insecticide sprays and to
the Zeta Psi fraternity's racing car
obstacle course, the Lagunita
Seca.
Now that the Aquafollies have
been revived, the Spring good life
at Lake Lag may see a renaissance
of creative fun and decadence.

firm from San Francisco driving
500 sheep along Mayfield Road,

and the two hit upon the idea of
using the herd to trample the clay
into the lake bed.
Lake Lag as a campus social
hot spot did not come into being
until several years later — after the
University was founded and when
the first boathouse was built.
The boathouse was planned in
1892 after a campus rumor spread
that Senator Stanford would
finance a trip to the World's
Columbian Exposition in Chicago
the following year if the
University could train and enter a
crew team.
$400 Boathouse
The team never made it to
Chicago, but the $400 boathouse
built by students managed to last
until 1913, when a second
boathouse was constructed a few
yards away. It was during the gala
1938 Hydrofollies that the
balcony of the second boathouse
dropped into the water, spectators
and would-be rescuers following
close behind.
A new boathouse was built the
following year.
In its heyday, boathouse
number three (the one that stands
today) teemed with frolicking
students who sprawled en masse
on its expansive decks. And in
1947, a Daily reporter dubbed it

the "center of springtime social
life on the Farm."
Sinister Wild Life
At a time when campus pools
had restricted hours for "mixed
swimming," no one seemed to
care too much about the more
sinister wildlife residing in the
murky Lag waters. (The lake
water was condemned by a
University health officer just the
year before because it contained
dangerously high levels of
intestinal bacteria, attributed to
the lake's original users—the
horses.)
Generations of Stanford
students clothed and unclothed,
their canoes, an alligator, a 1937
Packard, and the balcony of the
old boathouse are among just a
few of the items the little lake has
floated or sunk in its 90-odd
years.
In the summer-fall
"off-season," the dry lake bed has
been host to the pyromaniacal
activities of football fans, to
gallons of insecticide sprays and to
the Zeta Psi fraternity's racing car
obstacle course, the Lagunita
Seca.
Now that the Aquafollies have
been revived, the Spring good life
at Lake Lag may see a renaissance
of creative fun and decadence.

RIDE 'EM OUT—Before the turn of the century it was not unusual to see large four-legged creatures
roaming around Lake Lagunita. Since then, an alligator, a 1937 Packard and the second story of the
boathouse have all been dunked into its murky waters.
The days are long gone when
the only place males and females
could swim together on campus
was Lake Lagunita, and when the
boathouse deck was the place to
be on a warm spring afternoon.
Though students have managed
to find new ways to deal with the
idyllic spring weather here, much
of the Lake Lag mystique still
remains — at least until the end of
spring when its rippling waters
turn into a muddy puddle and
vanish into temporary oblivion.
According to legend. Lag dates
back to the days when University
land was still an alfalfa field used

to produce fodder for Leland
Stanford's prize horses. Sometime
in the early 1880s when the fields
were badly in need of water,
Stanford had a levee thrown up
on Los Trancos creek to create an
irrigation reservoir.
Mules And Scrapers
The lake bed, dug by mules
and scrapers, turned out to be too
porous for its intended purpose,
and Stanford decided to line it
with clay.
The story is that a Stanford
ranch hand happened to meet an
employee of a wholesale butcher
firm from San Francisco driving
500 sheep along Mayfield Road,

and the two hit upon the idea of
using the herd to trample the clay
into the lake bed.
