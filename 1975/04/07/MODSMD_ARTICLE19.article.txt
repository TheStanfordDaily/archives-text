## Netters Beat USC 
### RON PELLEGRINI RON BECK 
LOS ANGELES—It was 1942
all over again. The Card tennis
team flew south for their annual
Los Angeles matches and made it
through the weekend undefeated
for the first time in 33 years.
Unfortunately, the team has
yet to play UCLA. Saturday's
Card-Bruin match was postponed
until this afternoon at UCLA due
to untypically inclement weather.
But the Cards had a chance on
Friday to show their strength.
Losing both ends of the singles
and the middle match of the
doubles, the Cards played well
enough to capture a 6-3 win.

big wins came tor staniora
from Nick Saviano in the number
two spot, and Jim Delaney, at
fourth singles. Saviano swept by
USC's highly touted Bruce
Manson 6-2, 7-5 in a match that
set two hard-hitting lefthanders of
similar style against each other.
Delaney's victory was a
different story. After losing the
first set, 4-6 to USC's Hans
Guildemeister, Delaney figured
out the young Chilean's strong
two-handed backhand-forehand
combination. Delaney came back
to an overwhelming 7-6, 6-0 finish
in what may have been his best
match of the year.
In the top match, the Cards'
John Whitlinger was pitted against
Butch Walts, who, with a strong
serve, defeated Whitlinger in three
sets, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6. Walts won the
decisive tie breaker, 5-3.

NO CHANCE—Moscow's Valery
Pushkaryov holds the ball high over the
head of the Stanford player in the black
cap, and looks for an open teammate in
Saturday's water polo match at deGuerre
pools. The Russian team swamped the
Cards 14-9, showing that it is indeed one of
the top water polo teams in the Soviet
Union (and perhaps the world as well).
LOS ANGELES—It was 1942
all over again. The Card tennis
team flew south for their annual
Los Angeles matches and made it
through the weekend undefeated
for the first time in 33 years.
Unfortunately, the team has
yet to play UCLA. Saturday's
Card-Bruin match was postponed
until this afternoon at UCLA due
to untypically inclement weather.
But the Cards had a chance on
Friday to show their strength.
Losing both ends of the singles
and the middle match of the
doubles, the Cards played well
enough to capture a 6-3 win.

big wins came tor staniora
from Nick Saviano in the number
two spot, and Jim Delaney, at
fourth singles. Saviano swept by
USC's highly touted Bruce
Manson 6-2, 7-5 in a match that
set two hard-hitting lefthanders of
similar style against each other.
Delaney's victory was a
different story. After losing the
first set, 4-6 to USC's Hans
Guildemeister, Delaney figured
out the young Chilean's strong
two-handed backhand-forehand
combination. Delaney came back
to an overwhelming 7-6, 6-0 finish
in what may have been his best
match of the year.
In the top match, the Cards'
John Whitlinger was pitted against
Butch Walts, who, with a strong
serve, defeated Whitlinger in three
sets, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6. Walts won the
decisive tie breaker, 5-3.
