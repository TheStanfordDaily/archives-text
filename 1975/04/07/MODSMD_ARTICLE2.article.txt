# Menlo Park Hearst Raid Unsuccessful
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
A heavily armed raiding party
converged on a Menlo Park apartment
Friday evening in an unsuccessful
attempt to surprise fugitive newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst.
Although Hearst was not at the
apartment at 1100 Sevier Ave.,
authorities arrested four persons and
seized radical propaganda and
bomb-making paraphernalia. The
raiders reportedly found literature
from the Red Guerrilla Family, which
has claimed credit for bombing the
Standard Oil of California building in
San Francisco.
The Palo Alto Times reported
Saturday that the apartment had
formerly been a hangout for the
radical Venceremos organization, but
officials refused to confirm or deny
that report.
A fire broke out in the apartment
Saturday morning, but did little
damage. Menlo Park Police Chief Vic
Cizanckas said "preliminary
investigation indicates this fire was
deliberately set," pointing out that
materials had been piled on a rug and
doused with flammable liquid.
San Mateo County Sheriff John R.
McDonald, a member of the 40-man
raiding party, said authorities had
received "a pretty good lead" that
Hearst was in the apartment, although
he refused to comment on the nature
of the tip. He said Hearst was probably
still in the Bay Area, possibly in the
Santa Cruz mountains, some 40 miles
south.
Charles Bates, FBI agent in charge
of the Hearst investigation, called the
tip "one of those hundreds of sightings
we've had." He refused to comment
on any of the material seized.
Bates led the raid on the apartment,
which was guarded by two Doberman
Pinscher dogs. Officers from the Menlo
Park Police, the California Department
of Corrections and the Organized
Crime Unit of the San Mateo County
Sheriff's office joined FBI agents in the
raid.
Authorities arrested two armed
men, one allegedly a California prison
escapee, William Mcßeynolds, 31, and
Benjamin Thomas Sargis, 41.
Hearst had attended college in
Menlo Park, and grew up in nearby
Hillsborough.
