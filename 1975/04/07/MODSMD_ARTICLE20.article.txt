# Cornell Wins Arizona Golf
## 
### 
Senior Pat Cornett won her
second major tournament in less
than a month over the weekend,
capturing the Sun Devil
Intercollegiate Invitational at
Scottsdale, Ariz.
The recently crowned San
Francisco City women's champion
fired rounds of 78-77 for a 155
total, two strokes ahead of
runnerup Barbara Barrow of San
Diego State.
Cornett and Pam Palmieri
combined to win the team title by
two shots over host Arizona State.
Palmieri shot 171, including 11
penalty shots, to give the Cards a
326 total.
The men's team, playing a man
short after Aly Trompas walked
off the course with 45 holes to
play, finished third in the Pacific
Coast Collegiate Invitational at
Santa Barbara.
Trompas, who had been
complaining of back problems,
shot 43 on the front nine
Thursday and apparently drove
home to San Diego. He didn't
notify Coach Bud Finger or any of
his teammates.
USC won the tournament with
an 882 total, followed by Arizona
State at 885 and Stanford with
901.
Freshman Mike Peck was
Stanford's low scorer, finishing
sixth with rounds of
79-71-72—222, while Dave
Baskins tied for 11th at
73-73-78-224.
Other Stanford scores were
Conrad Nilmeier (70-78-77-225),
George Pettinger (73-78-79—230)
and Jay Johnston
(77-77-84-238).
Finger said that Trompas
would be on the sidelines — as
punishment — when the Cards
travel to Lodi this weekend for
the UOP Invitational.
