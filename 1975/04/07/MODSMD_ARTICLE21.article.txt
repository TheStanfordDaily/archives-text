BASEBALL

The Stanford baseball team lost its Pacific Eight
season opener Friday to UCLA, but the Cards came
back yesterday to sweep the Bruins in a
doubleheader, and re-establish themselves as
candidates for the league crown.
There was little Stanford could do in Friday's
3-0 loss, as UCLA hurler Ed Cowan pitched a
flawless game—6 1/3 innings of no-hit baseball,
then allowing only four Card hits.
Yesterday, however, the Stanford battery broke
loose. The Cards scored four runs in the first three
innings of the opener, and held on to win 4-1.
Ailing starter Ken Grolle pitched three innings and
three pitches before his elbow gave out, and reliever
Kent Caldwell came on to shut UCLA out and
collect the win.
Catcher Bruce Robinson opened the nightcap
with a two-run homer in the bottom of the first,
and the Cards went on to score a 7-3 victory. Lefty
John Yandle pitched seven innings for Stanford,
tired, and gave way to relief specialist Ed Matta,
who retired six straight batters to end the game.
TRACK
WESTWOOD—For reasons known only to
UCLA Athletic Director J.D. Morgan and the
weatherman, they held a double dual track meet
Saturday at the Bruin's Ducky Drake Stadium. And
the results couldn't have been any worse, either for
the participants, who had to compete in a driving
rain, or the Stanford Cardinals, who became the
Bruin's 32nd straight dual meet victim, losing
101-33.
"I thought about postponing the meet," Morgan
said, "but I called the weatherman and he said that
Sunday was going to be just as bad so, we went
ahead with it. Our track held up well though."

While the UCLA all-weather track held up, the
Cards did not. Pay ton Jordan's crew managed to
pick up only one first place, a 9:03.0 victory by
Tony Sandoval in the two mile. Teammate Jack
Bellah was right behind with a 9:05.8 for second.
Stanford's only other bright spot came in the
100 yard dash, where Marvin Holmes and the
Bruin's Mike Bush clocked 9. 7s. Bush was declared
the winner after officials looked at the photo.

CREW
The Stanford crew won the Con Findlay Cup
over USC and Santa Clara Saturday, and had but
one disappointment — the varsity did not win.
Leading with about 30 strokes to go, the Card
varsity was nosed out by USC at the finish line. The
Trojans rowed a strong race to beat Stanford by
about a foot — the two boats had the same
finishing time.
The rest of the Card oarsmen won. Stanford
scored a close, two-second victory over Santa Clara
in the junior varsity eights, and the Card frosh won
convincingly over USC in their race. Stanford also
won the fours, with Santa Clara second and USC
pulling up in last.
