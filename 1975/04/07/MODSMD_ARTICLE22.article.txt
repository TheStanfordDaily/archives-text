Ted Marcy cruised to his second straight
pommel horse title, during the NCAA gymnastics
finals this weekend at Indiana State University.
The Stanford junior notched a 9.8 in the final
round Saturday evening, easily outdistancing all
competition. Marcy's scores in the optionals were
his personal bests.
Pac-8 champion California won the school title,
upsetting defending champion lowa State.
