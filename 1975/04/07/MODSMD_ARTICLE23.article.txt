# International Water Polo
## Moscow Swamps Cards, Bows To Cal 
### MIKE TOLLIN 
Last spring, flying some 30,000 miles
above our world of communists and
capitalists, Dr. Weldon Gibson was hit with
a brainstrom. The executive vice-president
of the Stanford Research Institute, on his
way to the Soviet Union, thought,
"Wouldn't it be something to bring the two
societies together through some form of
athletic competition?"
Now this has been done before, of
course, but never at the college or club
level. So the good doctor went off in
search of his dream, and finally, over a
liberal dose of vodka, a match was
arranged.
It was decided that Stanford and the
60,000-student Moscow State University
would play a home-and-home series in
water polo.
So this week the Russian contingent
descended on Stanford to play a pair of
matches — one with the Cards and one
with Cal — and to have some fun,
American Style.
Last Thursday night a press conference
was held at Maples Pavilion, and the
Russians were treated to the ultimate
example of American hospitality — a
hamburger dinner. Both sides talked of the
significance of this meeting, and how it
would further efforts for peace and
international understanding.
The Russians it turned out, had an
average age of 28, and seven of them
played on the gold medal-winning team in

the 1972 Olympics. In contrast, none of
Stanford's "Kiddie Korps" had ever played
in a international match, and about half of
them were freshmen. Stanford mentor Art
Lambert put the match in perspective.
'This is comparable to putting Stanford's
freshmen and sophomore basketball
players against the Boston Celtics," he said.
Saturday the incongruous matchup
came to pass. Before a stormy-weather
crowd of 1500 at deGuerre Pool, Moscow
State outlasted Stanford 14-9. Considering
the formidable opposition, it was quite a
creditable performance by the Cardinals.
They came out firing, and actually led 5-3
after a score by John Roberts in the first
period.
Eventually, the Russians' experience
and strength began to tell, however. In the
second period, the Soviets outscored
Stanford 6-1 to take an insurmountable
five-goal lead at the half. The game's
leading scorers were Nugzar Mshvenieradze
and Stanford's Rick Johannsen, each with
four goals.
Yesterday, the Berkeley Bears trekked
to the Farm for their crack at the Russians.
Cal, the defending NCAA champion with
five players from the US national team,
played an extremely physical game and
upset the Russians 6-5. In the process, they
created a phenomenon. For the first time
in anyone's memory, Stanford fans were
caught rooting for Cal! After the
competition ended, Lambert offered some
thoughts. "International rules—unlimited

fouling—create a whole new game," the
coach said, "and considering our
inexperience, 1 think we played very well
Saturday."
Although he couldn't complain about
the game against the Soviets, yesterday,
Lambert's team lost to West Valley
Aquatic Club 6-4, and Lambert said, "I'm
starting to get impatient."
On this momentous occasion though,
even Lambert would admit that scores
were not that important. This week
provided a learning experience that a
couple dozen people will carry with them
forever. For the Russians, it was an
opportunity to see the fascinating world of
California. San Francisco is "the number
one U.S. city" to them, and the Golden
Gate Bridge and Disneyland are "miracles."
It was a chance to see "the cinema"
(Godfather II) and professional basketball
at its finest (Warriors-Sonics). And they
seemed amazed at the selection of cars,
food and clothing available in the U.S. For
the Stanford team, the week offered a
chance to play with and learn from the
tops in their sport.
But more importantly, as sophomore
Paul Clark said, "We learned that these
guys are just human beings like us, with the
same desires as us. When we asked them
what they wanted to do," he continued,
"they said, 'dance,' 'shop' and 'women.'
And when we said movie, one of the
Russians yelled Deep Throat
