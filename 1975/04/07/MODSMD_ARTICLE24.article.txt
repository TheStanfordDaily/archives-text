Congress Returns To Session
WASHINGTON - Congress ends a 10-day Easter
recess today to return to session — and to the
likelihood of repeated confrontations with President
Ford.
While most members were away from
Washington on trips to their districts or abroad,
Ford had sharp words for the Democratic-controlled
Congress on both domestic and foreign issues.
He signed the $24.8 billion tax cut bill with
announced misgivings over its size and some of its
provisions, and with a warning that he will veto
what he considers excessive spending measures.
As Communist forces rolled up territory in South
Vietnam and Cambodia, Ford castigated Congress
for not agreeing to his proposals for more aid.
Some of the disputed issues may surface early in
the renewed session.
The Senate Appropriations Committee is
scheduled to begin considering the $5.9 billion
House-passed appropriation for a variety of
programs, including heavy automobile purchases for
government departments, described by sponsors as
job-creating. It is considered a likely veto target if
enacted.
The House Ways and Means Committee
resumes Wednesday its work on a package of energy
tax legislation. It has before it a variety of
Democratic proposals, all differing in important
respects from Ford's recommendations.
The Senate may take up later in the week a bill
approved by its Foreign Relations Committee
authorizing $82.5 million in military aid for
Cambodia, cut from the $300 million Ford asked.
Ford has indicated he will ask for more aid,
principally humanitarian assistance, for Southeast
Asia, but has not sent up specific figures. Ford has
scheduled a foreign policy address before a joint

session of Congress for Thursday night.
Viet Orphan Tragedy Probed
SAIGON — More than 250 Vietnamese orphans,
including handicapped children, left for new homes
Sunday while U.S. officials said as many as 326
persons may have been aboard a giant cargo plane
that crashed Friday at the start of the American
evacuation.
They also said the flight recorder from the
downed plane had been recovered and might throw
new light on the tragic crash. The pilot of the plane
said earlier a decompression explosion affected the
controls of the big aircraft.
U.S. Embassy officials said that after reviewing
the passenger list and investigating the wreckage
they had determined that as many as 326 persons
were aboard. They still listed 100 orphans and
about 20 others as survivors, with the rest either
dead or missing.
In New Haven, Conn., Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey
(D-Minn.) said last night he will introduce a bill
to provide at least $200 million in emergency
assistance to Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees.
And he said emergency food and medicine
should go to all Vietnamese and Cambodian
refugees — not just those who are under the control
of Saigon or Phnom Penh.
New President In Taiwan
TAIPEI, Taiwan — Power passed to a new
generation yesterday on Taiwan.
Chiang Kai-shek, president of Nationalist China
since he withdrew from the mainland in 1949,
suffered a heart attack and died Saturday night. His
will called on followers to carry out his unfulfilled
dream to recapture all of China.
Yen Chia-kan, Chiang's 70-year-old vice
president, was sworn in yesterday as president. But

real power rests with Premier Chiang Ching-kuo, 65,
the late president's elder son.
Expressions of sadness and condolences came
from the United States and several other countries,
but most governments were quiet—mindful of
maintaining good relations with Peking.
Communist China's first reaction to the new
rulers was hostile.
Two Convicted In Attica Case
BUFFALO, N.Y. — A former inmate was
convicted Saturday of murder in the slaying of a
guard during the 1971 rebellion at Attica State
Prison. A second former inmate was found guilty of
attempted assault.
A jury of eight men and four women that had
deliberated since Thursday found John Hill, 23, of
Buffalo, guilty of murder in the death of guard
William Quinn. Charles Pernasilice, 22, of Syracuse,
was found guilty of second-degree attempted
assault.
Hill could get a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment, while Pernasilice could get a
maximum sentence of seven years in prison.
Quinn was beaten on the first day of the prison
revolt and died two days later. Forty-three men —
32 inmates and 11 prison employees — were killed
during the four-day riot; most died when state
troopers stormed the prison on Sept. 13, 1971.
