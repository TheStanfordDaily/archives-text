SAIGON (AP) â€” U.S. Marines are
prepared to land in Saigon to evacuate
Americans and some Vietnamese if
major fighting or chaos breaks out,
informed sources said yesterday.
The development came as the
United States continued building up
its 7th Fleet ships and forces off the
coast of Vietnam, with at least one
aircraft carrier, three destroyers, a
half-dozen other amphibious ships and
elements of a Marine division standing
by.
Three other aircraft carriers are
within short distance of Vietnam,
including the nuclear powered
Enterprise.
The buildup was disclosed in part in
news releases from the U.S. Embassy
and by other independent sources.
U.S. Embassy spokesmen would
not comment on the 7 th Fleet
buildup, but news releases from the
embassy concerning refugee
evacuation disclosed that the
commander of the fleet's amphibious
force. Rear Adm. Donald B. Whitmire,
was on station near Saigon with his
flagship, the USS Blue Ridge.
The same release also disclosed that
the destroyer USS Reasoner and scores

of Marine helicopters were within only
a short distance of Saigon.
Sources said they were on station
to evacuate Americans and some
Vietnamese if major fighting or chaos
broke out and that Marines were
prepared to land in the city of 3.5
million.
There are nearly 6000 Americans
still in Vietnam, although many have
begun leaving by commercial means.
However, in Washington, a Defense
Department spokesman said, "there is
absolutely no foundation" to stories
"which suggest that the evacuation of
Americans from Vietnam is
imminent."
The spokesman also claimed, "As
we have said before, there are four
aircraft carriers in the Western Pacific.
They are still there. There are no
aircraft carriers in Vietnam waters."
But other sources disclosed the
presence of two more destroyers, the
carrier Hancock, and supply ships off
the coast of Vietnam.
They said President Ford had
ordered every available ship to
Indochina.waters and that more would
be on the way, perhaps as a signal to
Hanoi that the President is determined
to protect every American.
