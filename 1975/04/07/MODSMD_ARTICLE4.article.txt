## Notre Dame Assistant Succeeds Dallmar 
### JIM WASCHER 
and DAVE ROBINSON
Notre Dame Asst. Coach Dick Dißiaso will be the new basketball
coach here, the Daily learned yesterday.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz has scheduled a luncheon press
conference in San Francisco today to formally announce the
appointment. Dißiaso, 33, will succeed Howie Dallmar, who announced
his resignation March 7 after 21 years as head coach.
Contacted in South Bend, Ind., last night, Notre Dame Head Coach
Digger Phelps said, "You're getting a great man, and hell do an
outstanding job ... getting Stanford into a position where it will be
highly respected, not only in the Pacific Eight, but all across the.
country."
A 15-member search committee had recommended Dißiaso to Ruetz
after meeting Friday night. The three other candidates interviewed by


New Stanford Head Coach Dick Dißiaso at airport last night
the committee were Stanford Asst.
Coaches Bub Bowling and Percy Carr,
and Dave Bliss, assistant coach under
Bobby Knight at Indiana.
Bowling said yesterday that he
would leave Stanford when his
contract expires Sept. 1. Dißiaso
reportedly wants to talk to Bowling
about remaining as an assistant, but
Bowling said "I'd be crazy to take it,
and he [Dißiaso] would be crazy to
want me. I've been an assistant here
too long."
Carr said of his future, "I'm in
limbo right now. I'll have to talk to
Dißiaso before I make any decision."
Carr is one of three finalists for the
head coaching job at San Jose City
College.
Dißiaso graduated from Mansfield
State College in Mansfield, Pa., in
1962 and became junior varisty coach
at Beacon High School in upstate New
York. During his two-year stint with
the junior varsity, he had a 30-game
winning streak.
In 1964, he became head coach at
Beacon. His varsity teams won 101 of
116 games ' in four years. When
Dißiaso's coach at Mansfield State, Bill
Gibson, assumed the head coaching
spot at the University of Virginia in
1968, he hired Dißiaso as his freshman
coach.
Phelps asked Dißiaso to join him
when he went to Notre Dame in 1971.

"His ambition was always to be a head
coach," Phelps said last night, "and
I've always said Dick Dißiaso is as
good as any assistant coach in the
country. I knew that someday,
someone would recognize his talents."
Phelps expressed confidence that
Dißiaso would be able to recruit
players who could "compete well
academically and athletically." He
added that "the students will like him
because he's very friendly, and the
players will respect his knowledge of
the game."
Interviewed late last night at San
Francisco International Airport,
Dißiaso said he is looking forward to
"the tremendous opportunity to work
at one of the great universities in the
United States, if not the world, and to
be a part of such an outstanding
basketball conference as the Pac-8."
With recruiting deadlines rapidly
approaching (April 9 for national
letters of intent), Dißiaso will begin
work immediately. His plans are
indefinite, but he will stay on campus
for at least a week.
When asked whether any players he
had recruited for Notre Dame might
follow him to the West Coast, Dißiaso
said, "The people we've recruited for
Notre Dame will in all probability go
to Notre Dame."
Dißiaso and his wife Shawna have
two children, Brian, 11, and Shawna
Re, 8.
