### BRUCE KADDEN 
Five slates of candidates submitted petitions for ASSU
Council of Presidents before Friday's deadline, Elections
Commissioner Tom Fitzgerald has announced.
If the signatures and candidates are confirmed to be
registered students, as expected, these slates will be on the
ballot Wednesday and Thursday, April 16 and 17.
In the order they would appear on the ballot, the slates
are headed by Charles Jameson, Steven Weiss, Michael
Lopez, Lee Rosenbaum and Kevin McDermott.
The Jameson slate advertises itself as composed of
engineering and pre-med students who "seek the
opportunity of serving Stanford students as the Council of
Presidents," according to their platform. Other members of
the slate are Walt Pyka, David Cooper and Paul Collopy.
Weiss heads the "Hammer and Coffin" slate, affiliated
with the Stanford Chaparral. Other students on the slate are
Shelly Williams, Walter Kloefkorn and Tom Devine.
Lopez said that he views his slate as an alternative to
those of standard ASSU politics. He described the general

theme that he, Gary Cohen and Preston Dufauchard would
present as "the pursuit of happiness."
Rosenbaum, chairman of the ASSU Senate, heads a slate
which advocates continuation of current student services,
while primarily working "as a facilitator for students who
want to organize student services, help students cut the red
tape of the administration, and defend student rights."
Members of Rosenbaum's slate are Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane. Their lengthy platform, to
be published early this week, outlines numerous goals
toward which the slate will work.
McDermott, an ASSU senator and president of Delta
Tau Delta fraternity, is running with Bonny Rodden, Andy
Leuchter and Mark Simonian. The slate has issued
numerous position papers which advocate a balance
between student advocacy and student services.
Six slates filed petitions Friday for senior class officers,
whom members of the class of '76 will elect next week.
Also appearing on the ballot will be proposals from 10
groups asking for a total of $16 in fee assessments for next
year.
