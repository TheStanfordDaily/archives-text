# C-15 Submits CJP Substitute
## 
### SUSAN LUTTNER 
The Committee of 15 (C-15), a
group charged with studying the
University judicial system, has
submitted a new set of
recommendations to President Lyman.
The outline for this Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC)calls for three faculty and
three student members, with two
non-voting chairmen, one from the
faculty and one from the Law School
student body.
The student chairman would
preside over and break ties in Honor
Code cases, and the faculty chairman
would preside over and break ties in all
other cases.
The current CJP consists of three
students, three faculty and a chairman
from the Law School faculty who
votes only to break ties.
"These amendments do not go as
far as some students would like. But
these changes are the best we can
possibly succeed in getting at this
time," wrote C-15 chairwoman Kathy
Cunningham and member W. Randy
Smith in a student position paper,
which they say reflects the feelings of
student C-15 members.
Compromise
Smith described the faculty
majority in all non-Honor Code cases
as a necessary compromise in reaching
an agreement with some faculty C-15
members. "Several faculty members
would have been just as happy to see
the whole thing break down and fall
apart," he said.
Cunningham said that the faculty as
a whole seems to see the CJP as
"efficient and fair," and have no
motivation to change it.
Under the new proposal, both
chairmen would be selected by the
president after consultation with the
dean of the Law School. The dean

would be expected to confer with law
student groups before making his
student recommendation.
The three faculty members on the
SJC would be appointed by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate. This procedure is
now in effect.
The three student members would
be selected by the ASSU Senate from
a randomly selected pool of 24
registered students who have agreed to
serve on the SJC. Student members are
now chosen strictly through random
selection, without ASSU input.
The recommendation adds that the
Univeristy could randomly select
student SJC members if the ASSU
Senate fails to appoint them.
Concession
'That was a concession we had to
make to account for mistakes in the
past," Cunningham said.
The current CJP was created by
Lyman in 1971, when the ASSU
Senate refused to appoint members to
a committee to select students for the
then-operative Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC). The current CJP will
remain in effect until the president
alters it or a new proposal is approved
by the president, the Faculty Senate
and either the ASSU Senate or the
student body.
C-15 member Dale Snape, assistant
dean of student affairs, speculated that
a procedure in case the ASSU did not
cooperate would have prevented the
"breakdown in the system" in 1971.
Smith emphasized that ASSU
Senate participation in selecting
students is a significant improvement,
although he said he regretted having to
compromise over the randomly
selected pool. He added that the
random selection has the advantage of
bringing students who wouldn't
ordinarily apply for committee
positions into the judicial process.
The new C-15 proposal provides for
a probation-type report in SJC
hearings which would allow the panel
to consider unusual circumstances. In
the past, students who have pleaded
guilty usually chosc to have individual
hearings with the dean of student
affairs, bypassing the CJP.
Cunningham and Smith wrote that
going to the dean "subverted the
students' right to have their case
decided by a jury of their peers."
The last two proposals presented by
the C-15 were voted down by the
students.
A 1973 proposal called for a
four-to-three student majority on the
panel, but one of the students could
have been removed by the President, a
two-thirds vote of the Faculty
Senate or a two-thirds vote of the
ASSU Senate.

Code cases, and the faculty chairman
would preside over and break ties in all
other cases.
The current CJP consists of three
students, three faculty and a chairman
from the Law School faculty who
votes only to break ties.
"These amendments do not go as
far as some students would like. But
these changes are the best we can
possibly succeed in getting at this
time," wrote C-15 chairwoman Kathy
Cunningham and member W. Randy
Smith in a student position paper,
which they say reflects the feelings of
student C-15 members.
Compromise
Smith described the faculty
majority in all non-Honor Code cases
as a necessary compromise in reaching
an agreement with some faculty C-15
members. "Several faculty members
would have been just as happy to see
the whole thing break down and fall
apart," he said.
Cunningham said that the faculty as
a whole seems to see the CJP as
"efficient and fair," and have no
motivation to change it.
Under the new proposal, both
chairmen would be selected by the
president after consultation with the
dean of the Law School. The dean

would be expected to confer with law
student groups before making his
student recommendation.
The three faculty members on the
SJC would be appointed by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate. This procedure is
now in effect.
The three student members would
be selected by the ASSU Senate from
a randomly selected pool of 24
registered students who have agreed to
serve on the SJC. Student members are
now chosen strictly through random
selection, without ASSU input.
The recommendation adds that the
Univeristy could randomly select
student SJC members if the ASSU
Senate fails to appoint them.
Concession
'That was a concession we had to
make to account for mistakes in the
past," Cunningham said.
The current CJP was created by
Lyman in 1971, when the ASSU
Senate refused to appoint members to
a committee to select students for the
then-operative Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC). The current CJP will
remain in effect until the president
alters it or a new proposal is approved
by the president, the Faculty Senate
and either the ASSU Senate or the
student body.
C-15 member Dale Snape, assistant
dean of student affairs, speculated that
a procedure in case the ASSU did not
cooperate would have prevented the
"breakdown in the system" in 1971.
Smith emphasized that ASSU
Senate participation in selecting
students is a significant improvement,
although he said he regretted having to
compromise over the randomly
selected pool. He added that the
random selection has the advantage of
bringing students who wouldn't
ordinarily apply for committee
positions into the judicial process.
The new C-15 proposal provides for
a probation-type report in SJC
hearings which would allow the panel
to consider unusual circumstances. In
the past, students who have pleaded
guilty usually chosc to have individual
hearings with the dean of student
affairs, bypassing the CJP.
Cunningham and Smith wrote that
going to the dean "subverted the
students' right to have their case
decided by a jury of their peers."
The last two proposals presented by
the C-15 were voted down by the
students.
A 1973 proposal called for a
four-to-three student majority on the
panel, but one of the students could
have been removed by the President, a
two-thirds vote of the Faculty
Senate or a two-thirds vote of the
ASSU Senate.
The Committee of 15 (C-15), a
group charged with studying the
University judicial system, has
submitted a new set of
recommendations to President Lyman.
The outline for this Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC)calls for three faculty and
three student members, with two
non-voting chairmen, one from the
faculty and one from the Law School
student body.
The student chairman would
preside over and break ties in Honor
Code cases, and the faculty chairman
would preside over and break ties in all
other cases.
