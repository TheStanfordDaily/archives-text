# Blackmun Presides Over Moot Court
## Future Lawyers Dazzle Judges 
### JIM WASCHER 
The four Stanford law students participating
in the 23rd Annual Marion Rice Kirkwood Moot
Court Competition sat nervously on the
Dinkelspiel Auditorium stage Friday afternoon.
An audience of over 700 murmured expectantly.
Suddenly, Court Clerk Melinda Collins, a
third-year law student, stood and called out in
her clear, deeply British voice: "All rise!" Onto
the stage strode Assoc. Justice Harry Blackmun
of the U.S. Supreme Court, Assoc. Justice
Raymond Sullivan of the California Supreme
Court and U.S. District Court Judge Charles
Renfrew. Each wore the familiar judge's black
robe.
There was a genuine courtroom atmosphere —
and the tension was part of it. Blackmun did his

best to calm the participants.
First-year student Michael Shepard stood at
the podium, ready to begin his arguments in
behalf of the defendant in the mythical case,
Dogson v. Liddell, when Blackmun asked him
whether he was familiar with Title XXVIII,
Section 1 of the U.S. Code.
A surprised Shepard said he had not read the
section lately. Blackmun then read aloud the
relevant portion, which requires a quorum of six
justices for all Supreme Court proceedings.
Glancing at Sullivan and Renfrew, Blackmun said
"my brethren are apparently stuck in the
Chicago snow drifts."
The audience roared, the ice was broken and
the proceedings were under way.
Shepard argued on behalf of an imaginary state

board of education which had ordered each of its
local primary and secondary schools to include in
their curricula books which "reflect racial,
religious and cultural pluralism."
The hypothetical plaintiffs in the case were a
"Christian American Parents Association" and an
individual parent, who claimed that the books in
question ridiculed their religious and moral
beliefs, in violation of their constitutional rights
of free religious exercise and privacy.
"We have never guaranteed the right not to
have one's religion criticized," Shephard noted.
"We have never guaranteed the right to privacy
from information, particularly in the school
room."
The first counsel for those aroused parents,

second-year student Barbara Bergman, was selected
by the judges as the best overall advocate. The three
jurists also voted that she had submitted the best
written brief prior to the oral arguments Friday.
"If students are compelled to attend school and
are compelled to read the books," Bergman
contended, "then we can assume that they are going
to begin to question, or at least doubt, their
religious beliefs." She said this would violate the
First Amendment rights of the children and their
parents.
During Bergman's arguments, Blackmun

continued his efforts to make the proceedings more
relaxed. After a series of rather picky questions
about recent Supreme Court decisions, the justice
conceded that "there are times when we indulge in
unfair questions."
The second counsel for the school board,
second-year student Ralph Zarefsky, won honors as
the second best overall advocate of the competition.
Zarefsky argued that "the reading of the books
themselves does not infringe the free exercise of
religion"—and insisted that instructors must
themselves ridicule specific religious beliefs before
the state can be accused of ridicule.

The final counsel for the parents was Lisalee
Wells, who was best overall advocate in the
Kirkwood Competition two years ago as a first-year
student.
At the conclusion of the program, Blackmun
noted that "the caliber of advocacy here is a great
compliment to Stanford's law school. The briefs
were far better than most that are routinely
submitted to the Supreme Court of the United
States."
Addressing the four students, Sullivan best
summed up the feelings of the judges: "Ladies and
gentlemen, we'll be waiting for you."

continued his efforts to make the proceedings more
relaxed. After a series of rather picky questions
about recent Supreme Court decisions, the justice
conceded that "there are times when we indulge in
unfair questions."
The second counsel for the school board,
second-year student Ralph Zarefsky, won honors as
the second best overall advocate of the competition.
Zarefsky argued that "the reading of the books
themselves does not infringe the free exercise of
religion"—and insisted that instructors must
themselves ridicule specific religious beliefs before
the state can be accused of ridicule.

The final counsel for the parents was Lisalee
Wells, who was best overall advocate in the
Kirkwood Competition two years ago as a first-year
student.
At the conclusion of the program, Blackmun
noted that "the caliber of advocacy here is a great
compliment to Stanford's law school. The briefs
were far better than most that are routinely
submitted to the Supreme Court of the United
States."
Addressing the four students, Sullivan best
summed up the feelings of the judges: "Ladies and
gentlemen, we'll be waiting for you."
The four Stanford law students participating
in the 23rd Annual Marion Rice Kirkwood Moot
Court Competition sat nervously on the
Dinkelspiel Auditorium stage Friday afternoon.
An audience of over 700 murmured expectantly.
Suddenly, Court Clerk Melinda Collins, a
third-year law student, stood and called out in
her clear, deeply British voice: "All rise!" Onto
the stage strode Assoc. Justice Harry Blackmun
of the U.S. Supreme Court, Assoc. Justice
Raymond Sullivan of the California Supreme
Court and U.S. District Court Judge Charles
Renfrew. Each wore the familiar judge's black
robe.
There was a genuine courtroom atmosphere —
and the tension was part of it. Blackmun did his

best to calm the participants.
First-year student Michael Shepard stood at
the podium, ready to begin his arguments in
behalf of the defendant in the mythical case,
Dogson v. Liddell, when Blackmun asked him
whether he was familiar with Title XXVIII,
Section 1 of the U.S. Code.
A surprised Shepard said he had not read the
section lately. Blackmun then read aloud the
relevant portion, which requires a quorum of six
justices for all Supreme Court proceedings.
Glancing at Sullivan and Renfrew, Blackmun said
"my brethren are apparently stuck in the
Chicago snow drifts."
The audience roared, the ice was broken and
the proceedings were under way.
Shepard argued on behalf of an imaginary state

board of education which had ordered each of its
local primary and secondary schools to include in
their curricula books which "reflect racial,
religious and cultural pluralism."
The hypothetical plaintiffs in the case were a
"Christian American Parents Association" and an
individual parent, who claimed that the books in
question ridiculed their religious and moral
beliefs, in violation of their constitutional rights
of free religious exercise and privacy.
"We have never guaranteed the right not to
have one's religion criticized," Shephard noted.
"We have never guaranteed the right to privacy
from information, particularly in the school
room."

second-year student Barbara Bergman, was selected
by the judges as the best overall advocate. The three
jurists also voted that she had submitted the best
written brief prior to the oral arguments Friday.
"If students are compelled to attend school and
are compelled to read the books," Bergman
contended, "then we can assume that they are going
to begin to question, or at least doubt, their
religious beliefs." She said this would violate the
First Amendment rights of the children and their
parents.
