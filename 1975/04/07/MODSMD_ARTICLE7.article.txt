# Blackmun Presides Over Moot Court
## Future Lawyers Dazzle Judges 
### JIM WASCHER 
The four Stanford law students participating
in the 23rd Annual Marion Rice Kirkwood Moot
Court Competition sat nervously on the
Dinkelspiel Auditorium stage Friday afternoon.
An audience of over 700 murmured expectantly.
Suddenly, Court Clerk Melinda Collins, a
third-year law student, stood and called out in
her clear, deeply British voice: "All rise!" Onto
the stage strode Assoc. Justice Harry Blackmun
of the U.S. Supreme Court, Assoc. Justice
Raymond Sullivan of the California Supreme
Court and U.S. District Court Judge Charles
Renfrew. Each wore the familiar judge's black
robe.
There was a genuine courtroom atmosphere —
and the tension was part of it. Blackmun did his

best to calm the participants.
First-year student Michael Shepard stood at
the podium, ready to begin his arguments in
behalf of the defendant in the mythical case,
Dogson v. Liddell, when Blackmun asked him
whether he was familiar with Title XXVIII,
Section 1 of the U.S. Code.
A surprised Shepard said he had not read the
section lately. Blackmun then read aloud the
relevant portion, which requires a quorum of six
justices for all Supreme Court proceedings.
Glancing at Sullivan and Renfrew, Blackmun said
"my brethren are apparently stuck in the
Chicago snow drifts."
The audience roared, the ice was broken and
the proceedings were under way.
Shepard argued on behalf of an imaginary state

board of education which had ordered each of its
local primary and secondary schools to include in
their curricula books which "reflect racial,
religious and cultural pluralism."
The hypothetical plaintiffs in the case were a
"Christian American Parents Association" and an
individual parent, who claimed that the books in
question ridiculed their religious and moral
beliefs, in violation of their constitutional rights
of free religious exercise and privacy.
"We have never guaranteed the right not to
have one's religion criticized," Shephard noted.
"We have never guaranteed the right to privacy
from information, particularly in the school
room."
The first counsel for those aroused parents,
