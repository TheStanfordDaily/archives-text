## Find New Flicks 
### 
To many of those members of the community who
habitually enjoy one of Stanford's finest traditions, the
ASSU Sunday Flicks, this quarter's schedule must come as a
disappointment.
Six of the 11 spring quarter films have been shown at the
Sunday Flicks within the past two years. While these
movies—Sometimes a Great Notion, Cabaret, 2001: A Space
Odyssey, Ryan's Daughter, Catch 22 and Slaughterhouse
Five, have all been popular with Stanford audiences, we
think regular Flicks-goers woud rather see different features.
Flicks Manager Rocky Barber should realize that not
everyone who attends the Flicks is a freshman, transfer
student or new faculty/staff member, and make a serious
effort to secure previously unshown movies. While it is
occasionally warranted to periodically reshow a favorite,the
repetition of over half of one quarter's offerings is a bit
much.
It can be argued that the schedule is largely put together
from responses to questionnaires handed out to Flicks-goers.
Even if this is true, however, these surveys are skewed
because a number of the Flicks on the surveys have been
shown here before.
The Flicks management has a responsibility to take some
initiative in finding unshown movies it believes would be of
interest to the Flicks audience.
