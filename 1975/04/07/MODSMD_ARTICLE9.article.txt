# Unions Are Unfair
## 
### 
Employees in five categories in
the Stanford Hospital and Clinics
will have an opportunity to vote
for or against unions on. April
10-12. I would like to urge them,
particularly the minority
employees, to vote "no" on
unions.
First, national trade unions
have never been true friends and
supporters of the minority
community; they have never
really been strong supporters of
civil rights legislation; they have
never supported minority
candidates for public office to any
significant degree; they have never
encouraged or fought for
affirmative action programs that
would result in more minorities
being hired.
Unemployment figures among
minority communities usually
triple the general population, and
trade unions have never spoken
out or acted against this form of
racism. They have never done
these things; they never will.
Minority 'Benefits'?
Second, employees who will be
able to vote should look at what is
happening on campus. One of the
unions wanting to be recognized,
United Stanford Employees
[USE], is already representing
some of the employees here. I
believe it is fair for voters to ask
what USE has done for those
employees, particularly minority
employees it now represents.
Has the number of minority
employees increased? Apparently,
all that USE has done has been to
strike and raise the fees. If I were
a voter, I would wait to see what
USE is doing in other parts of the
campus before voting it in at the
hospital.
Third, union officials and
management have always been for
themselves, and not the
employees. They feel that what's
good for the union and
management is good for the
employee. In USE's first
negotiation with the University,
one of the first concessions the
union made was in grievance
procedures (which are of great
importance to the employee).
Minority employees have enough
problems, and to bring in a union
is to ask for double trouble.
No Rights
Fourth, if the voters think they
have rights as employees, they will
be giving most of them up under a
union. Unions are known to have
goons that go around "taking

care" of those who step out of
line, and they don't care what the
color of the member happens to
be. Should there be a strike,
whether individual members vote
for it or not, they must walk that
picket line or be heavily fined.
All persons within a job
classification will have to pay
union dues, whether they are in
favor of the union or not. The
response usually given to this
complaint by unions is that "if you
are going to benefit by the union's
activities you should pay for it."
The reason usually given by
management is that "before
applicants are hired they will be
told they will have to pay union
dues, so the applicant will have
the choice of taking the job or
not." With jobs being as scarce as
they are, that's a hell of a choice!
Compulsory Dues
If the persons in unions truly
believe that what they are
pursuing is right, then they should
do it whether people join their
activities or not. There are many
organizations in the country
working for a better life which
don't demand that those being
benefited join their organizations.
If there are people concerned
about unrighteous things in the
hospital and the clinics, and I am
sure there are many, then they
should work with some of the
established organizations to help
bring those improvements about.
The Black Advisory Committee
and Alianza are two such groups.
These organizations have been
helping, and people haven't had to
pay money to them. They can do
better. Maybe those supporting a
vote for unions can instead help
these organizations.
In addition to those two
organizations is the University's
Affirmative Action Office. This
office is obligated to help
minority employees in their
grievances; it has the power to do
so.
Once unions are voted in, they
are rarely voted out. I believe the
employees in the hospital and
clinics should wait a while before
voting to bring in a union they
know little about. I urge them to
see what is happening in other
parts of the campus first. Make
unions prove themselves there
before bringing them to the
Medical Center.

associate general secretary.)
