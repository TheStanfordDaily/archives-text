"What is REAL?" asked the Rabbit one day.
"Docs it mean having things that buzz inside
you and a stick-out handle?"
"Real isn't how you are made|' said the Skin
Horse. "It's a thing that happens to you. When
a chili loves you for a long, long time, not just
to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you
become Real."
"Does it hurt?" asked the Rabbit.
"Sometimes," said the Skin Horse, for he
was always truthful. "When you are Real you
don't mind being hurc."
"Does it happen all at once, like being
wound up," he asked, "or bit by bit?"
"It doesn't happen all at once|' said the Skin
Horse. "You become. It rakes a long time.
That's why it doesn't often happen to people
who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who
have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the
time you are Real, most of your hair has been
loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get
loose in the joints and very shabby. But these
things don't matter at all, because once you
are Real you can't be ugly, except to people
who don't understand."
