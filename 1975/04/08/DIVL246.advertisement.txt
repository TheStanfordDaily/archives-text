Cancer
hasn't stopped
1,500,000
people
from living.
They did it by not letting
fear kill them. They did it by
going to the doctor in time.
They did it with the help of
the effective methods of
treatment today: surgery...
radiation... chemotherapy.
They did it because of the
advances made through
research.
More than 1,500,000
Americans are living proof
cancer can be cured. The
American Cancer Society
needs millions to save mil
lions more.
Please, give more today.
We want to wipe out cancer
in your lifetime.
