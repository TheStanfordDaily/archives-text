# Ex-Nixon Aide: CIA Probed Hoover Fellow
## 
### BILL EVERS 
According to former Nixon
speechwriter William Satire's new
book, Before the Fall, a Central
Intelligence Agency agent in summer
1968 investigated the background and
private life of a Hoover Institution
senior staff member, who had left
Stanford to serve as director of foreign
policy research in Nixon's 1968
campaign.
Subsequent investigation by the
New York Times has led to
confirmation by a high CIA official
that the incident did indeed take
place.
The object of the ClA's undercover
inquiry was Richard V. Allen,
one-time editor of Hoover Institution's
Yearbook on International Communist
Affairs. Allen rose to prominence in
conservative intellectual circles as a
student of University of Notre Dame
Prof. Gerhart Niemeyer. He came to
Stanford in 1966 from the Center for
Strategic Studies at Georgetown
University.
Nixon Adviser
Although Allen was Nixon's chief
foreign policy adviser during the 1968
campaign, in the Nixon
Administration he became a
subordinate of then-foreign policy
adviser Henry Kissinger and was given
few responsibilities. He eventually left
the government to run a private
Washington economic consulting firm,
Potomac International Corporation.
The evidence available thus far
suggests that the ClA's spying on Allen
was done to serve either the Johnson
Administration's political interest or
the anticipated interests of the CIA
under a possible future Nixon
administration.
Staff Knew
During the 1968 campaign, the
Nixon staff learned that the CIA was
behind the spying. Persons connected
with that Nixon campaign have
subsequently told the Times that the
spying incident was not made public
for fear that an attack on the Johnson
Administration would push
then-President Lyndon Johnson into
more enthusiastic support of Sen.
Hubert H. Humphrey (D-Minn.), then
the Democratic presidential nominee.
The ClA's public rationale for its
undercover investigation of Allen is
that the agency had decided, on its
own without any initiative from Allen,
to turn over some classified material to
him for use in preparing the yearbook
on communism.
But the CIA agent's own cover
story at the time was that he was
working for "the Republicans" to
check the background of Nixon's staff.
Furthermore, there were numerous
published newspaper reports on
Allen's appointment to Nixon's
campaign staff. Both these facts
indicate that the CIA knew that Allen
was no longer working at the Hoover
Institution.
Allen had approached the CIA in
January 1968 to ask its help in
proofreading the forthcoming
Yearbook. The CIA maintains that he
also asked for some unclassified
material on the strengths of
communist groups around the world.

Allen says he does not recall any such
request.
Both Allen and the CIA agree that
Allen did not request classified
material.
Allen also told the Times that he
had approached the CIA partly as a
precaution to head off any possible
CIA plans to participate in the
yearbook project via covert financing.
Over the years, the CIA has subsidized
various publications which contained
political views in which it was
interested.
Not Cleared
At present, according to its editor
Richard F. Staar, the Yearbook is not

cleared with the CIA for spelling
mistakes or on any other matters.
Hoover Institution director W.
Glenn Campbell told the Daily that he
could not recall any discussion in
1967-68 about having the CIA look
over the Yearbook or about requesting
special material from the CIA for the
Yearbook. Campbell stressed that he
himself did not and could not
participate in the day-to-day details of
the Hoover Institution's many
projects.
He did say that Hoover Institution
staffers were free, as part of academic
freedom, to consult the advice of any
expert, in the CIA or anywhere else.

to turn over some classified material to
him for use in preparing the yearbook
on communism.
But the CIA agent's own cover
story at the time was that he was
working for "the Republicans" to
check the background of Nixon's staff.
Furthermore, there were numerous
published newspaper reports on
Allen's appointment to Nixon's
campaign staff. Both these facts
indicate that the CIA knew that Allen
was no longer working at the Hoover
Institution.
Allen had approached the CIA in
January 1968 to ask its help in
proofreading the forthcoming
Yearbook. The CIA maintains that he
also asked for some unclassified
material on the strengths of
communist groups around the world.

Allen says he does not recall any such
request.
Both Allen and the CIA agree that
Allen did not request classified
material.
Allen also told the Times that he
had approached the CIA partly as a
precaution to head off any possible
CIA plans to participate in the
yearbook project via covert financing.
Over the years, the CIA has subsidized
various publications which contained
political views in which it was
interested.
Not Cleared
At present, according to its editor
Richard F. Staar, the Yearbook is not

cleared with the CIA for spelling
mistakes or on any other matters.
Hoover Institution director W.
Glenn Campbell told the Daily that he
could not recall any discussion in
1967-68 about having the CIA look
over the Yearbook or about requesting
special material from the CIA for the
Yearbook. Campbell stressed that he
himself did not and could not
participate in the day-to-day details of
the Hoover Institution's many
projects.
He did say that Hoover Institution
staffers were free, as part of academic
freedom, to consult the advice of any
expert, in the CIA or anywhere else.
According to former Nixon
speechwriter William Satire's new
book, Before the Fall, a Central
Intelligence Agency agent in summer
1968 investigated the background and
private life of a Hoover Institution
senior staff member, who had left
Stanford to serve as director of foreign
policy research in Nixon's 1968
campaign.
Subsequent investigation by the
New York Times has led to
confirmation by a high CIA official
that the incident did indeed take
place.
The object of the ClA's undercover
inquiry was Richard V. Allen,
one-time editor of Hoover Institution's
Yearbook on International Communist
Affairs. Allen rose to prominence in
conservative intellectual circles as a
student of University of Notre Dame
Prof. Gerhart Niemeyer. He came to
Stanford in 1966 from the Center for
Strategic Studies at Georgetown
University.
Nixon Adviser
Although Allen was Nixon's chief
foreign policy adviser during the 1968
campaign, in the Nixon
Administration he became a
subordinate of then-foreign policy
adviser Henry Kissinger and was given
few responsibilities. He eventually left
the government to run a private
Washington economic consulting firm,
Potomac International Corporation.
The evidence available thus far
suggests that the ClA's spying on Allen
was done to serve either the Johnson
Administration's political interest or
the anticipated interests of the CIA
under a possible future Nixon
administration.
Staff Knew
During the 1968 campaign, the
Nixon staff learned that the CIA was
behind the spying. Persons connected
with that Nixon campaign have
subsequently told the Times that the
spying incident was not made public
for fear that an attack on the Johnson
Administration would push
then-President Lyndon Johnson into
more enthusiastic support of Sen.
Hubert H. Humphrey (D-Minn.), then
the Democratic presidential nominee.
The ClA's public rationale for its
undercover investigation of Allen is
that the agency had decided, on its
own without any initiative from Allen,
to turn over some classified material to
him for use in preparing the yearbook
on communism.
But the CIA agent's own cover

working for "the Republicans" to
