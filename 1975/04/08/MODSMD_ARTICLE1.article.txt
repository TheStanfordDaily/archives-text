# Ex-Nixon Aide: CIA Probed Hoover Fellow
## 
### BILL EVERS 
According to former Nixon
speechwriter William Satire's new
book, Before the Fall, a Central
Intelligence Agency agent in summer
1968 investigated the background and
private life of a Hoover Institution
senior staff member, who had left
Stanford to serve as director of foreign
policy research in Nixon's 1968
campaign.
Subsequent investigation by the
New York Times has led to
confirmation by a high CIA official
that the incident did indeed take
place.
The object of the ClA's undercover
inquiry was Richard V. Allen,
one-time editor of Hoover Institution's
Yearbook on International Communist
Affairs. Allen rose to prominence in
conservative intellectual circles as a
student of University of Notre Dame
Prof. Gerhart Niemeyer. He came to
Stanford in 1966 from the Center for
Strategic Studies at Georgetown
University.
Nixon Adviser
Although Allen was Nixon's chief
foreign policy adviser during the 1968
campaign, in the Nixon
Administration he became a
subordinate of then-foreign policy
adviser Henry Kissinger and was given
few responsibilities. He eventually left
the government to run a private
Washington economic consulting firm,
Potomac International Corporation.
The evidence available thus far
suggests that the ClA's spying on Allen
was done to serve either the Johnson
Administration's political interest or
the anticipated interests of the CIA
under a possible future Nixon
administration.
Staff Knew
During the 1968 campaign, the
Nixon staff learned that the CIA was
behind the spying. Persons connected
with that Nixon campaign have
subsequently told the Times that the
spying incident was not made public
for fear that an attack on the Johnson
Administration would push
then-President Lyndon Johnson into
more enthusiastic support of Sen.
Hubert H. Humphrey (D-Minn.), then
the Democratic presidential nominee.
The ClA's public rationale for its
undercover investigation of Allen is
that the agency had decided, on its
