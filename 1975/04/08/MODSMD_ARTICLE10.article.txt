# A 						First: Tuition To Go Toward Buildings
## Vlae Kershner 
### 
Almost buried in the 1975-76
operating budget is an innocuous
looking negative item under income
called "transfer to plant renovations."
Innocuous, that is, until it is
realized that for the first time,
students will be paying for the
construction of academic buildings on
the University.
Not that this is necessarily bad. But
as consumers of the University's
services, it seems that students should
know what this little item is all about,
so if they don't like it, they can tell
the University administration and
Board of Trustees, "Wait a minute.
That's not what we want our money
going for."
The basic situation is this. The
University wants to build four new
structures now — since construction
costs are sloping upward at a rate of at
least 12 percent.
Borrow Money
But the University doesn't have the
money to build a chemistry building
and a new library and rebuild
Buildings 200 and 460 on the Quad to
house the History and Computer
Science Departments, respectively. So
the University proposes to borrow a
portion of the money ($11.7 million
out of a total project cost of $48.2
million) from the California
Educational Facility Authority
(CEFA), and repay it at a rate of $1
million per year for the next 25 years.

The repayment would come from
the general operating budget, through
the item "transfer to plant
renovations."
The income side of the general
operating budget is 51 percent
composed of student tuition and fees,
and in fact, tuition is about the only
income source the University can
control.
So, in other words, students for the
next 25 years will be paying
$1,000,000 for the construction of
these new buildings; the first time
students have ever financed
"non-revenue producing" structures
on this campus. Dividing this $1
million figure by 11,000 students, we
get a figure of $90 per year per
student.
Worth It?
The question we must answer is
this: Is the immediate construction of
these buildings worth $90 per year, if
this money could be better utilized in
either saving academic programs from
cutbacks or lowering the rate of
tuition increase?
In order to answer this question we
must first ask what would happen if
the University did not go into debt to
finance the new buildings.
The question is moot in the case of
the chemistry building, since a new
structure has already been approved,
utilizing $2.8 million of the total of
$11.7 million in CEFA loans.
The question is basically irrelevant
in the case of the new library, which is
obviously badly needed. According to
current fund estimates, the University
will be able to construct the library

without any CEFA loans; that is, using
gift support alone. Debt financing
would only be considered useful as a
"backstop," in case fund-raising
efforts weren't as successful as
anticipated.
Quad Buildings
Which brings us down to two
buildings in the Quad for which the
University proposes to borrow the
lion's share of the $11.7 million.
Let's assume the University
argument that the two buildings may
have to be abandoned if not
reconstructed soon is correct. Then,
the question is whether there is
sufficient space elsewhere in the
University to house the departments.
In the case of what will become the
new computer science building, there

most assuredly is. Computer science is
now housed in several buildings spread
out over the campus.
The University argues that this
division of the computer science
department as a negative impact on
the cohesiveness and effectiveness of
the department.
This is undoubtably true. But are
these negative effects large enough to
charge students so much for their
elimination?
If a new computer science building
were not constructed, most of the
$6.7 million in gifts earmarked for its
construction could be reallocated to
the reconstruction of the History
Corner (if that is, indeed, necessary for
safety reasons) or the new Library or
Chemistry Building. Thus, students

might not have to pay for these new
buildings.
True, this would mean
abandonment of Building 460 on the
Quad, which of course would not be
welcomed, since the Quad is the heart
of the University. But this
abandonment would be only
temporary, until enough cash to
finance reconstruction of Building 460
became available.
These arguments have been rather
one-sided, and the University does
have good arguments in favor of
immediate construction using student
money.
But don't you think students
should get a chance to debate how the
University spends their money before
any final decision is reached?

lion's share of the $11.7 million.
Let's assume the University
argument that the two buildings may
have to be abandoned if not
reconstructed soon is correct. Then,
the question is whether there is
sufficient space elsewhere in the
University to house the departments.
In the case of what will become the
new computer science building, there

most assuredly is. Computer science is
now housed in several buildings spread
out over the campus.
The University argues that this
division of the computer science
department as a negative impact on
the cohesiveness and effectiveness of
the department.
This is undoubtably true. But are
these negative effects large enough to
charge students so much for their
elimination?
If a new computer science building
were not constructed, most of the
$6.7 million in gifts earmarked for its
construction could be reallocated to
the reconstruction of the History
Corner (if that is, indeed, necessary for
safety reasons) or the new Library or
Chemistry Building. Thus, students

might not have to pay for these new
buildings.
True, this would mean
abandonment of Building 460 on the
Quad, which of course would not be
welcomed, since the Quad is the heart
of the University. But this
abandonment would be only
temporary, until enough cash to
finance reconstruction of Building 460
became available.
These arguments have been rather
one-sided, and the University does
have good arguments in favor of
immediate construction using student
money.
But don't you think students
should get a chance to debate how the
University spends their money before
any final decision is reached?

Almost buried in the 1975-76
operating budget is an innocuous
looking negative item under income
called "transfer to plant renovations."
Innocuous, that is, until it is
realized that for the first time,
students will be paying for the
construction of academic buildings on
the University.
Not that this is necessarily bad. But
as consumers of the University's
services, it seems that students should
know what this little item is all about,
so if they don't like it, they can tell
the University administration and
Board of Trustees, "Wait a minute.
That's not what we want our money
going for."
The basic situation is this. The
University wants to build four new
structures now — since construction
costs are sloping upward at a rate of at
least 12 percent.
Borrow Money
But the University doesn't have the
money to build a chemistry building
and a new library and rebuild
Buildings 200 and 460 on the Quad to
house the History and Computer
Science Departments, respectively. So
the University proposes to borrow a
portion of the money ($11.7 million
out of a total project cost of $48.2
million) from the California
Educational Facility Authority
(CEFA), and repay it at a rate of $1
million per year for the next 25 years.

The repayment would come from
the general operating budget, through
the item "transfer to plant
renovations."
The income side of the general
operating budget is 51 percent
composed of student tuition and fees,
and in fact, tuition is about the only
income source the University can
control.
So, in other words, students for the
next 25 years will be paying
$1,000,000 for the construction of
these new buildings; the first time
students have ever financed
"non-revenue producing" structures
on this campus. Dividing this $1
million figure by 11,000 students, we
get a figure of $90 per year per
student.
Worth It?
The question we must answer is
this: Is the immediate construction of
these buildings worth $90 per year, if
this money could be better utilized in
either saving academic programs from
cutbacks or lowering the rate of
tuition increase?
In order to answer this question we
must first ask what would happen if
the University did not go into debt to
finance the new buildings.
The question is moot in the case of
the chemistry building, since a new
structure has already been approved,
utilizing $2.8 million of the total of
$11.7 million in CEFA loans.
The question is basically irrelevant
in the case of the new library, which is
obviously badly needed. According to
current fund estimates, the University
will be able to construct the library

without any CEFA loans; that is, using
gift support alone. Debt financing
would only be considered useful as a
"backstop," in case fund-raising
efforts weren't as successful as
anticipated.

operating budget is 51 percent
composed of student tuition and fees,
and in fact, tuition is about the only
income source the University can
control.
So, in other words, students for the
next 25 years will be paying
$1,000,000 for the construction of
these new buildings; the first time
students have ever financed
"non-revenue producing" structures
on this campus. Dividing this $1
million figure by 11,000 students, we
get a figure of $90 per year per
student.
Worth It?
The question we must answer is
this: Is the immediate construction of
these buildings worth $90 per year, if
this money could be better utilized in
either saving academic programs from
cutbacks or lowering the rate of
tuition increase?
In order to answer this question we
must first ask what would happen if
the University did not go into debt to
finance the new buildings.
The question is moot in the case of
the chemistry building, since a new
structure has already been approved,
utilizing $2.8 million of the total of
$11.7 million in CEFA loans.
The question is basically irrelevant
in the case of the new library, which is
obviously badly needed. According to
current fund estimates, the University
will be able to construct the library

without any CEFA loans; that is, using
gift support alone. Debt financing
would only be considered useful as a
"backstop," in case fund-raising
efforts weren't as successful as
anticipated.
Quad Buildings
Which brings us down to two
buildings in the Quad for which the
University proposes to borrow the
lion's share of the $11.7 million.
Let's assume the University
argument that the two buildings may
have to be abandoned if not
reconstructed soon is correct. Then,
the question is whether there is
sufficient space elsewhere in the
University to house the departments.
In the case of what will become the
new computer science building, there

most assuredly is. Computer science is
now housed in several buildings spread
out over the campus.
The University argues that this
division of the computer science
department as a negative impact on
the cohesiveness and effectiveness of
the department.
This is undoubtably true. But are
these negative effects large enough to
charge students so much for their
elimination?
If a new computer science building
were not constructed, most of the
$6.7 million in gifts earmarked for its
construction could be reallocated to
the reconstruction of the History
Corner (if that is, indeed, necessary for
safety reasons) or the new Library or
Chemistry Building. Thus, students

might not have to pay for these new
buildings.
True, this would mean
abandonment of Building 460 on the
Quad, which of course would not be
welcomed, since the Quad is the heart
of the University. But this
abandonment would be only
temporary, until enough cash to
finance reconstruction of Building 460
became available.
These arguments have been rather
one-sided, and the University does
have good arguments in favor of
immediate construction using student
money.
But don't you think students
should get a chance to debate how the
University spends their money before
any final decision is reached?
