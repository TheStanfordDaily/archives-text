# Budgeting: What Guides The Guidelines?
## Raymond F. Bacchetti 
### 
To make budget information
accessible, we publish a variety of
material throughout the year in the
Daily, Campus Report, and elsewhere.
The most comprehensive of these
takes the form of a small book, and
the current edition, Operating Budget
Guidelines, 1975-76, is available for
the asking in the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs or in my office in
Building One, Inner Quad. The book's
122 pages provide a fair amount of
information about context and process
as well as details about budget
increases and cutbacks planned for
next year.
Reading that complete an account
isn't everyone's cup of tea, so this
article is a try at summarizing the two
areas of concern that are central to
understanding budgeting at Stanford.
One is the frame of reference from
within which financial affairs are
approached by those with budget

responsibilities. The other is how
decisions are made and how they can
be influenced. Here, with appreciation
to the Daily for the opportunity, are
my views on these matters.
The University's principal purpose
— and a short statement of it always
sounds like a cliche — is to be
distinctively good, and our brand of
distinctiveness revolves around high
intellectual capacity and achievements.
How are we distinctive?
Facilitative Environment
First, we are distinctive because we
make it possible and attractive for
unusually able people — particularly
but not exclusively faculty and
students — to work together in a
facilitative environment.
Second, we are distinctive because
such people prosper intellectually
more in the company of each other
than in other settings.
This view of distinctiveness has a
great deal of bearing on general budget
priorities and particular budget
decisions, for it predisposes the overall
process to favor quality,
accomplishment, and excellence.
Why among the valid social roles
that educational institutions can play
is this the one played by Stanford? I
think the answer is that gifted and well
educated people can make life better
for others as well as themselves.
Faculty, Graduates
The careers of faculty and
graduates here tend to deal with the
causes of man's uncertainties and
problems rather than with their
symptoms, with the fundamental
concepts of nature and human nature
as well as with facts, with the patterns
of social, legal, medical, or economic
relationships among individuals rather
than with isolated events.
They don't deal with them perfectly
or even with the reassurance of a high

probability of ultimate success.
Nevertheless, the ability and the
intention to deal with causes,
concepts, and patterns sets the
direction of the University's effort.
This too has important budget
implications, biasing the process
against the fashionable and transitory
and for the significant, searching and
profound.
Other Considerations
Though our basic purposes are the
fundamental factors in budgeting,
there are other considerations.
Stanford is, as institutions of higher
education go, smaller than some, larger
than most.
We spend about a million dollars
each working day; have custody of 14
square miles and a physical plant
worth close to a billion dollars at
replacement cost; provide for a
residential population greater than
that of half of the incorporated cities
in California. So much for size. It's a
fact, not a goal. But it requires
budgetary attention.
Many communities and publics
have an effectual relation to the
University. Students, faculty and staff
have and express manifold individual
and joint interests.
So too do donors who wish to
assure themselves that the institution
is well managed, parents concerned
about finances and institutional
performance, federal agencies with
auditing responsibilities, congressmen
debating educational policy of various
sorts, local governments worried about
traffic, tax income, and the pressures
of population. These likewise — and
properly — claijn budget consideration
and get it.
Grasp Of Objectives
The making of budget decisions,
then, requires a clear and thorough
grasp of the University's educational

and scholarly objectives and an
appreciation of the range of legitimate
interests to be taken into account. I'm
sure that's not news when it's stated in
so obvious a way.
Newsworthy or not, the corollary
truth that priorities, obligations, and
responsibilities can be in conflict does
not always get the recognition it
deserves in budget discussions.
About the second area of concern
— how decisions are made and how
they can be influenced — these three
things might be said.
Rational Model
First, because we're the kind of
institution we are, a rational model
rather than a political one fits budget
decision-making best.

That means that the well developed
argument is in most areas and at most
stages of decision-making the
instrument which promises the
greatest impact.
There are deviations from the
rational model — some of them good,
some bad — and the rational model
works only imperfectly.
Nevertheless, it is the model most
congruent with University means and
University ends and the one, therefore,
which properly predominates and
which most often leads to sound and
satisfactory decisions.
Decision-Making Distributed
Second, because authority and
responsibility are widely distributed in
the University, budget decision-making
is likewise dispersed. The Board of
Trustees has the final financial
authority, and budget development
overall is a principal responsibility of
the president and vice presidents.
But a careful look at the process
suggests that it is much more
dialectical than hierarchical. The
proposals, needs, requests, and issues
that comprise a budget process
originate throughout the University.
The quality of evidence and
argument that eventually produces a
priority list is the single most
influential factor in determining what
within available resources will be
approved.
The authority formally to approve
budget requests does flow up a
hierarchy to the vice presidents,
president, and finally the Board.
But this. formal authority tends
more often than not to reflect an
inductive give-and-take rather than a
deductive application of general
principles.
Individual Influence
Third, because the rational model is
the workhorse and because authority
and responsibility are dispersed, the
most effective way for most members
of the Stanford community to
influence the University's budget is
through focused attention to
particular concerns and serious
discussions with the individuals in
whose area of responsibility those
concerns fail.
The more well defined and targeted
the task, the greater the opportunity
to get intellectual mastery of the
relevant facts and issues. The more
thorough, thoughtful, and penetrating
the arguments one is able to develop
and bring to bear, the more likely and
lasting his or her impact on the result.

president, and finally the Board.
But this. formal authority tends
more often than not to reflect an
inductive give-and-take rather than a
deductive application of general
principles.
Individual Influence
Third, because the rational model is
the workhorse and because authority
and responsibility are dispersed, the
most effective way for most members
of the Stanford community to
influence the University's budget is
through focused attention to
particular concerns and serious
discussions with the individuals in
whose area of responsibility those
concerns fail.
The more well defined and targeted
the task, the greater the opportunity
to get intellectual mastery of the
relevant facts and issues. The more
thorough, thoughtful, and penetrating
the arguments one is able to develop
and bring to bear, the more likely and
lasting his or her impact on the result.

To make budget information
accessible, we publish a variety of
material throughout the year in the
Daily, Campus Report, and elsewhere.
The most comprehensive of these
takes the form of a small book, and
the current edition, Operating Budget
Guidelines, 1975-76, is available for
the asking in the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs or in my office in
Building One, Inner Quad. The book's
122 pages provide a fair amount of
information about context and process
as well as details about budget
increases and cutbacks planned for
next year.
Reading that complete an account
isn't everyone's cup of tea, so this
article is a try at summarizing the two
areas of concern that are central to
understanding budgeting at Stanford.
One is the frame of reference from
within which financial affairs are
approached by those with budget

responsibilities. The other is how
decisions are made and how they can
be influenced. Here, with appreciation
to the Daily for the opportunity, are
my views on these matters.
The University's principal purpose
— and a short statement of it always
sounds like a cliche — is to be
distinctively good, and our brand of
distinctiveness revolves around high
intellectual capacity and achievements.
How are we distinctive?
Facilitative Environment
First, we are distinctive because we
make it possible and attractive for
unusually able people — particularly
but not exclusively faculty and
students — to work together in a
facilitative environment.
Second, we are distinctive because
such people prosper intellectually
more in the company of each other
than in other settings.
This view of distinctiveness has a
great deal of bearing on general budget
priorities and particular budget
decisions, for it predisposes the overall
process to favor quality,
accomplishment, and excellence.
Why among the valid social roles
that educational institutions can play
is this the one played by Stanford? I
think the answer is that gifted and well
educated people can make life better
for others as well as themselves.
Faculty, Graduates
The careers of faculty and
graduates here tend to deal with the
causes of man's uncertainties and
problems rather than with their
symptoms, with the fundamental
concepts of nature and human nature
as well as with facts, with the patterns
of social, legal, medical, or economic
relationships among individuals rather
than with isolated events.
They don't deal with them perfectly
or even with the reassurance of a high

probability of ultimate success.
Nevertheless, the ability and the
intention to deal with causes,
concepts, and patterns sets the
direction of the University's effort.
This too has important budget
implications, biasing the process
against the fashionable and transitory
and for the significant, searching and
profound.
Other Considerations
Though our basic purposes are the
fundamental factors in budgeting,
there are other considerations.
Stanford is, as institutions of higher
education go, smaller than some, larger
than most.
We spend about a million dollars
each working day; have custody of 14
square miles and a physical plant
worth close to a billion dollars at
replacement cost; provide for a
residential population greater than
that of half of the incorporated cities
in California. So much for size. It's a
fact, not a goal. But it requires
budgetary attention.
Many communities and publics
have an effectual relation to the
University. Students, faculty and staff
have and express manifold individual
and joint interests.
So too do donors who wish to
assure themselves that the institution
is well managed, parents concerned
about finances and institutional
performance, federal agencies with
auditing responsibilities, congressmen
debating educational policy of various
sorts, local governments worried about
traffic, tax income, and the pressures
of population. These likewise — and
properly — claijn budget consideration
and get it.
Grasp Of Objectives
The making of budget decisions,
then, requires a clear and thorough
grasp of the University's educational

and scholarly objectives and an
appreciation of the range of legitimate
interests to be taken into account. I'm
sure that's not news when it's stated in
so obvious a way.
Newsworthy or not, the corollary
truth that priorities, obligations, and
responsibilities can be in conflict does
not always get the recognition it
deserves in budget discussions.
About the second area of concern
— how decisions are made and how
they can be influenced — these three
things might be said.
Rational Model
First, because we're the kind of
institution we are, a rational model
rather than a political one fits budget
decision-making best.

That means that the well developed
argument is in most areas and at most
stages of decision-making the
instrument which promises the
greatest impact.
There are deviations from the
rational model — some of them good,
some bad — and the rational model
works only imperfectly.
Nevertheless, it is the model most
congruent with University means and
University ends and the one, therefore,
which properly predominates and
which most often leads to sound and
satisfactory decisions.
Decision-Making Distributed
Second, because authority and
responsibility are widely distributed in
the University, budget decision-making
is likewise dispersed. The Board of
Trustees has the final financial
authority, and budget development
overall is a principal responsibility of
the president and vice presidents.
But a careful look at the process
suggests that it is much more
dialectical than hierarchical. The
proposals, needs, requests, and issues
that comprise a budget process
originate throughout the University.
The quality of evidence and
argument that eventually produces a
priority list is the single most
influential factor in determining what
within available resources will be
approved.
The authority formally to approve
budget requests does flow up a
hierarchy to the vice presidents,
president, and finally the Board.
But this. formal authority tends
more often than not to reflect an
inductive give-and-take rather than a
deductive application of general
principles.

Third, because the rational model is

congruent with University means and
University ends and the one, therefore,
which properly predominates and
which most often leads to sound and
satisfactory decisions.
Decision-Making Distributed
Second, because authority and
responsibility are widely distributed in
the University, budget decision-making
is likewise dispersed. The Board of
Trustees has the final financial
authority, and budget development
overall is a principal responsibility of
the president and vice presidents.
But a careful look at the process
suggests that it is much more
dialectical than hierarchical. The
proposals, needs, requests, and issues
that comprise a budget process
originate throughout the University.
The quality of evidence and
argument that eventually produces a
priority list is the single most
influential factor in determining what
within available resources will be
approved.
The authority formally to approve
budget requests does flow up a
hierarchy to the vice presidents,
president, and finally the Board.
But this. formal authority tends
more often than not to reflect an
inductive give-and-take rather than a
deductive application of general
principles.
Individual Influence
Third, because the rational model is
the workhorse and because authority
and responsibility are dispersed, the
most effective way for most members
of the Stanford community to
influence the University's budget is
through focused attention to
particular concerns and serious
discussions with the individuals in
whose area of responsibility those
concerns fail.
The more well defined and targeted
the task, the greater the opportunity
to get intellectual mastery of the
relevant facts and issues. The more
thorough, thoughtful, and penetrating
the arguments one is able to develop
and bring to bear, the more likely and
lasting his or her impact on the result.

To make budget information
accessible, we publish a variety of
material throughout the year in the
Daily, Campus Report, and elsewhere.
The most comprehensive of these
takes the form of a small book, and
the current edition, Operating Budget
Guidelines, 1975-76, is available for
the asking in the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs or in my office in
Building One, Inner Quad. The book's
122 pages provide a fair amount of
information about context and process
as well as details about budget
increases and cutbacks planned for
next year.
Reading that complete an account
isn't everyone's cup of tea, so this
article is a try at summarizing the two
areas of concern that are central to
understanding budgeting at Stanford.
One is the frame of reference from
within which financial affairs are
approached by those with budget

responsibilities. The other is how
decisions are made and how they can
be influenced. Here, with appreciation
to the Daily for the opportunity, are
my views on these matters.
The University's principal purpose
— and a short statement of it always
sounds like a cliche — is to be
distinctively good, and our brand of
distinctiveness revolves around high
intellectual capacity and achievements.
How are we distinctive?
Facilitative Environment
First, we are distinctive because we
make it possible and attractive for
unusually able people — particularly
but not exclusively faculty and
students — to work together in a
facilitative environment.
Second, we are distinctive because
such people prosper intellectually
more in the company of each other
than in other settings.
This view of distinctiveness has a
great deal of bearing on general budget
priorities and particular budget
decisions, for it predisposes the overall
process to favor quality,
accomplishment, and excellence.
Why among the valid social roles
that educational institutions can play
is this the one played by Stanford? I
think the answer is that gifted and well
educated people can make life better
for others as well as themselves.
Faculty, Graduates
The careers of faculty and
graduates here tend to deal with the
causes of man's uncertainties and
problems rather than with their
symptoms, with the fundamental
concepts of nature and human nature
as well as with facts, with the patterns
of social, legal, medical, or economic
relationships among individuals rather
than with isolated events.
They don't deal with them perfectly
or even with the reassurance of a high

probability of ultimate success.
Nevertheless, the ability and the
intention to deal with causes,
concepts, and patterns sets the
direction of the University's effort.
This too has important budget
implications, biasing the process
against the fashionable and transitory
and for the significant, searching and
profound.
Other Considerations
Though our basic purposes are the
fundamental factors in budgeting,
there are other considerations.
Stanford is, as institutions of higher
education go, smaller than some, larger
than most.
We spend about a million dollars
each working day; have custody of 14
square miles and a physical plant
worth close to a billion dollars at
replacement cost; provide for a
residential population greater than
that of half of the incorporated cities
in California. So much for size. It's a
fact, not a goal. But it requires
budgetary attention.
Many communities and publics
have an effectual relation to the
University. Students, faculty and staff
have and express manifold individual
and joint interests.
So too do donors who wish to
assure themselves that the institution
is well managed, parents concerned
about finances and institutional
performance, federal agencies with
auditing responsibilities, congressmen
debating educational policy of various
sorts, local governments worried about
traffic, tax income, and the pressures
of population. These likewise — and
properly — claijn budget consideration
and get it.
Grasp Of Objectives
The making of budget decisions,
then, requires a clear and thorough
grasp of the University's educational

and scholarly objectives and an
appreciation of the range of legitimate
interests to be taken into account. I'm
sure that's not news when it's stated in
so obvious a way.
Newsworthy or not, the corollary
truth that priorities, obligations, and
responsibilities can be in conflict does
not always get the recognition it
deserves in budget discussions.
About the second area of concern
— how decisions are made and how
they can be influenced — these three
things might be said.
Rational Model
First, because we're the kind of
institution we are, a rational model
rather than a political one fits budget
decision-making best.

That means that the well developed
argument is in most areas and at most
stages of decision-making the
instrument which promises the
greatest impact.
There are deviations from the
rational model — some of them good,
some bad — and the rational model
works only imperfectly.
Nevertheless, it is the model most
congruent with University means and
University ends and the one, therefore,
which properly predominates and
which most often leads to sound and
satisfactory decisions.
