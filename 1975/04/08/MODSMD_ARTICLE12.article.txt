# Students Can Affect Decisions
## Cynthia Davis 
### 
Perhaps the most useful way to
approach this assignment is to explain
two components of my work as the
undergraduate student commissioner
on the Budget Priorities Commission.
These components are: 1) the ways in
which I have sought to contribute to
decisions about cuts; and 2) my
opinion about the effect of cuts.
Because no commissioner was
chosen to be representative of any
University constituency, we each have
contributed opinions about the
valuable elements offered at Stanford.
However, I bring two special
interests to the Commission: as a
student, I am concerned about
undergraduate education, and as a
woman, I am concerned about the
position of women in the University.
Thus, my perspective meant that I
paid particular attention to the nature,
as well as the amount, of proposed
cuts.
Intensive Evaluation
Perhaps what has impressed me the
most about our work has been the
intensive evaluation which was
required before any decisions were
made, and the relationship each
decision had in terms of impact on
other areas.
To establish our criteria for making
judgments, it was necessary to begin
by asking questions about the quality
of programs and services.
These assessments included making
comparisons with other universities,
soliciting reports from various
University offices, listening to
presentations as well as carefully
analyzing recommendations made to
the Commission.
Final Report
Our final report shows that our
recommendations take many forms,
from the creation of task forces to
deal with specific areas, to the
acceptance of proposed departmental
cuts.
As watchpersons, we have sought to
meaningfully evaluate cuts while also
suggesting creative alternatives.
With respect to any decision, we
pooled our collective impressions,
knowledge, and experiences to
determine a variety of
recommendations.
Yet, independently from other
commissioners, I used what I felt to be

my most valuable experiences here as a
guide: would a cut alter a program
which offered an important
educational experience? Could a
service or program be obtained
elsewhere in the University?
I learned that realistically, only part
of the decisions about cuts are based
on the effect they have directly on
students, and it is essential to bear in
mind that parallel to the educational
process at Stanford are many other
processes of equal importance.
Complex Process
It is by now a redundant
oversimplification to say that the
budget-making process is complex. It
is better to say that the process is
misunderstood, by both students and
administrators alike.
Administrators have a tendency to
have a limited scope, viewing only the
process within their individual domain.
It would be useful if deans and
department heads could take a broad
look at areas affected by cuts
throughout the University to increase
their perspective on the total effect of
cuts.
Student Role
Students (who have often criticiaed
the budget-cutting process as not
providing channels for their input) can
play a significant role in decisions.
I encourage each student to think
about the experiences she or he has
had at Stanford: what was valuable
about that experience; is it something
each student should benefit from; can
it be gained elsewhere in the
University?
This task can be useful, for students
compose the unique group which has
the ability to make these judgments.
Those committees and
administrators dealing with
undergraduate education and student
services will welcome students'

suggestions and opinions.
I optimistically foresaw my task on
the Commission as one which would
identify the worthwhile features of
Stanford. In this next year, when the
focus of discussions includes defining
goals, the University will begin to take
a different shape. Yet, as students, we
will continue to be supported in our
efforts to participate in all educational
processes at Stanford, and I hope that
students will take advantage of this
opportunity.

As watchpersons, we have sought to
meaningfully evaluate cuts while also
suggesting creative alternatives.
With respect to any decision, we
pooled our collective impressions,
knowledge, and experiences to
determine a variety of
recommendations.
Yet, independently from other
commissioners, I used what I felt to be

my most valuable experiences here as a
guide: would a cut alter a program
which offered an important
educational experience? Could a
service or program be obtained
elsewhere in the University?
I learned that realistically, only part
of the decisions about cuts are based
on the effect they have directly on
students, and it is essential to bear in
mind that parallel to the educational
process at Stanford are many other
processes of equal importance.
Complex Process
It is by now a redundant
oversimplification to say that the
budget-making process is complex. It
is better to say that the process is
misunderstood, by both students and
administrators alike.
Administrators have a tendency to
have a limited scope, viewing only the
process within their individual domain.
It would be useful if deans and
department heads could take a broad
look at areas affected by cuts
throughout the University to increase
their perspective on the total effect of
cuts.
Student Role
Students (who have often criticiaed
the budget-cutting process as not
providing channels for their input) can
play a significant role in decisions.
I encourage each student to think
about the experiences she or he has
had at Stanford: what was valuable
about that experience; is it something
each student should benefit from; can
it be gained elsewhere in the
University?
This task can be useful, for students
compose the unique group which has
the ability to make these judgments.
Those committees and
administrators dealing with
undergraduate education and student
services will welcome students'

suggestions and opinions.
I optimistically foresaw my task on
the Commission as one which would
identify the worthwhile features of
Stanford. In this next year, when the
focus of discussions includes defining
goals, the University will begin to take
a different shape. Yet, as students, we
will continue to be supported in our
efforts to participate in all educational
processes at Stanford, and I hope that
students will take advantage of this
opportunity.

Perhaps the most useful way to
approach this assignment is to explain
two components of my work as the
undergraduate student commissioner
on the Budget Priorities Commission.
These components are: 1) the ways in
which I have sought to contribute to
decisions about cuts; and 2) my
opinion about the effect of cuts.
Because no commissioner was
chosen to be representative of any
University constituency, we each have
contributed opinions about the
valuable elements offered at Stanford.
However, I bring two special
interests to the Commission: as a
student, I am concerned about
undergraduate education, and as a
woman, I am concerned about the
position of women in the University.
Thus, my perspective meant that I
paid particular attention to the nature,
as well as the amount, of proposed
cuts.
Intensive Evaluation
Perhaps what has impressed me the
most about our work has been the
intensive evaluation which was
required before any decisions were
made, and the relationship each
decision had in terms of impact on
other areas.
To establish our criteria for making
judgments, it was necessary to begin
by asking questions about the quality
of programs and services.
These assessments included making
comparisons with other universities,
soliciting reports from various
University offices, listening to
presentations as well as carefully
analyzing recommendations made to
the Commission.
Final Report
Our final report shows that our
recommendations take many forms,
from the creation of task forces to
deal with specific areas, to the
acceptance of proposed departmental
cuts.
As watchpersons, we have sought to
meaningfully evaluate cuts while also
suggesting creative alternatives.
