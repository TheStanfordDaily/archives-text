## Yesterday's Students, Tomorrow's Alumni Career Questions? Ask A Pro 
### 
By TERRY ANZUR
Rich man, poor man, beggar
man, thief, doctor, lawyer. . .
Because career decisions are
much more complex than this
familiar rhyme, students
sometimes take big steps in the
wrong direction.
The Career Exposure Program,
sponsored by the Alumni
Association, will allow students to
visit the working site of an
alumnus and get a preview of
where a Stanford degree might
lead.
It could lead to the office of a
corporate executive or a lawyer,
to a scientific research laboratory,
to a film production studio, or to
a vintner's wine cellar; the
program provides a link between
students and professionals in the
same field of interest.
The program encompasses
many occupations, including:
banker, corporate accountant,
hospital administrator, hotel
owner, publisher, reporter, lawyer
(corporate and independent),
retailer, artist, employment agent,
designer, craftsman, artist,
criminologist, advertising agent,
investment counselor, grocer,
farmer, professional athlete,
sports promoter.
Bay Area Sites
Most of the working sites are
located in San Erancisco,
Oakland, or on the Peninsula, and
students must provide their own
transportation. The visits,
scheduled during the last two
weeks in April, will last from
three hours to a full working day.
Shelby Dorman, the Alumni
Association's assistant director for
classes and student services,
emphasizes that the program is
not an employment service. "You
should not pursue these interviews
with the hope of finding a job,"
she advises students.
She says students should meet
alumni "with the idea of picking
their minds — finding out whether
graduate school is the best way to
start a particular career, inquiring
about the range of beginning

salaries, and asking other
questions."
Dorman hopes that an inside
look at various working
environments will help solidify
student career aims or clear up
misconceptions about jobs. She
says, "Someone could come away
from a corporate vice-president's
office saying, 'It wasn't as great as
I thought it would be,' or 'Wow, it
was really plush.' "
She adds that the program will
enable "students who don't have
connections of their own" to gain
access to professionals whose time
is worth hundreds of dollars per
day."The Alumni Association
provides a connection. It's a
source for all students," she says.
Dorman encourages all
undergraduates — freshmen
through seniors — to apply. Here
is the application procedure:
students should obtain a response
card from the Bowman Alumni
House and list their career
aspirations and times when they
are not available for a career
exposure interview; individuals
with similar interests and
schedules will be matched in
groups of two or three and
assigned to the alumnus they will
visit.
