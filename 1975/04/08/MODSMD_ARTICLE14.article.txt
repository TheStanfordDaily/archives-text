Where are the good places to fly
kites around Stanford? —J.K.
Our reliable sources inform us
that the best place that is still
relatively close is Frenchman's
Hill, a large hill with a flat top
where it is supposedly always
windy. To get there, go out
Bowdoin past the Cowell cluster
and turn right on Stanford
Avenue. Then turn left on Peter
Coutts Road and follow it to the
hill.
On campus, the biggest
expanse of open and generally
empty space is the Wilbur field,
between Wilbur and Cowell
Health Center. Or you might try
the soccer fields behind the
football stadium.
Those with a car might explore
the recreation areas at Canada or
Foothill Colleges, or Ros Park in
Palo Alto, about a mile from
campus. And those with a private
plane should definitely try Kitty
Hawk, North Carolina, reportedly
the best kite-flying area in the
United States.

After seeing Earthquake and 11
Harrowhouse at the Bijou Theatre
in Palo Alto, I emerged both
exhilarated and sickened.
Naturally, I was exhilarated by
the glorious sight of Los Angeles
crumbling, but had a splitting

headache from the Sensurround. I
remember reading that at
Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los
Angeles they had to stop showing
Earthquake because the ceiling
was cracking. Has that happened
at the Bijou, or have they taken
special precautions? Also, why did
the Sensurround come on
periodically during the second
movie ? —L. W.
The Bijou has taken no special
precautions, according to Twigg

Zittle, ticket salesman. He said
that special technicians adjust the
Sensurround to the individual
theatre wherever Earthquake is
shown and that the level at the
Bijou has been judged to be safe.
In answer to your second
question, Sensurround is regulated
by a low frequency sound wave in
the movie itself. In other words,
whenever the sound hits a certain
frequency, the Sensurround is
automatically activated.
