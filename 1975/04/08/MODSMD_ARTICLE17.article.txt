## Santana, Journey-San Jose: Two Styles And Two Sellouts 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
SAN JOSE — It was a scene
totally beyond belief, beyond the
grasp of the two capacity crowds
that filled the 7 and 11 p.m.
shows at the new Center for the
Performing Arts Friday.
Devadip Carlos Santana,
dressed in simple white pants and
shirt, wearing a button bearing the
image of his guru, Sri Chinmoy;
NeaJ Schon, wearing a bright red
velvet suit. The two, sitting on a
practice amp in Journey's dressing
room, jammed for 20 minutes
between shows, holding a small
audience of friends spellbound.
When Santana and Schon
finished, the only response was
silence — the only possible
response to perhaps the two
greatest guitarists in the world.
Quantum Leap
Out on stage, it was clear that
two virtuosos are taking the same
instrument in different stylistic
directions, but that each in his
own way represents a quantum
leap beyond all that has gone
before.
Most important, Carlos
Santana has returned to the old
style of Latin-based rock that
made his first band revolutionary.
Debuted March 23 at the SNACK
benefit, the newest Santana style
takes the old songs and
incorporates all the newer guitar
intricacies of the last three years
of Santana's personal musical
growth.
To some extent the old songs
such as "Toussaint L'Overture,"
"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy
Queen," and "Soul Sacrifice" can
never sound the same. The loss of

Jose Chepito Areas, Michael
Shrieve, Schon, and Gregg Rolie
has necessarily changed the
Santana sound — none of the old
personnel has been adequately
replaced.
The Old Sound
Nonetheless, Santana has
returned to the old sound and is
beginning to resurrect the
tightness, the rhythmic certainty
that was the key to the old band's
success. Armando Peraza on
congas and Ndugo on drums do
not constitute a solid percussion
section, but this does nothing to
diminish the wisdom of returning
to the old material.
Despite the shaky rhythmic
underpinnings, the old music gave
the public the beautiful melodic
riffs of Carlos Santana against the
backdrops they most wanted to
hear.
Journey began the long evening
with a perfectly adequate yet
somehow uninspired set, probably
due to the prospect of having to
perform another show later in the
evening. Their second set not only
made up for the first — it nearly
equaled their finest concert
performance.
Reserve Energy
Together from the first chord
of "Mystery Mountain" through
the end of their encore, Journey
dipped into their reserve energy
and hit every note with near
perfection.
Schon especially demonstrated
the difference between his work
on the band's recently released

album and the inspired riffs he
seems to pull out of the air before
live audiences. While the album
work was exceptional, the
embellishments Schon added to
"Of A Lifetime," "To Play Some
Music," and "Conversations"
Friday night took the album
material beyond its own limits.
Drummer Aynsley Dunbar also
picked up energy for the second
set, lending perfect control to
"Kohoutek," the band's
instrumental masterpiece that is
fraught with difficult, abrupt time
changes. Rhythm guitarist George
Tickner supported Gregg Rolie's
synthesizer and Schon's guitar,
giving "Kohoutek" exceptional
energy.
But beyond any individual
performances, it was the solidarity
with which Journey performed
their second set that made it
unique, the perfect example of
their musical prowess.

Nonetheless, Santana has
returned to the old sound and is
beginning to resurrect the
tightness, the rhythmic certainty
that was the key to the old band's
success. Armando Peraza on
congas and Ndugo on drums do
not constitute a solid percussion
section, but this does nothing to
diminish the wisdom of returning
to the old material.
Despite the shaky rhythmic
underpinnings, the old music gave
the public the beautiful melodic
riffs of Carlos Santana against the
backdrops they most wanted to
hear.
Journey began the long evening
with a perfectly adequate yet
somehow uninspired set, probably
due to the prospect of having to
perform another show later in the
evening. Their second set not only
made up for the first — it nearly
equaled their finest concert
performance.
Reserve Energy
Together from the first chord
of "Mystery Mountain" through
the end of their encore, Journey
dipped into their reserve energy
and hit every note with near
perfection.
Schon especially demonstrated
the difference between his work
on the band's recently released

album and the inspired riffs he
seems to pull out of the air before
live audiences. While the album
work was exceptional, the
embellishments Schon added to
"Of A Lifetime," "To Play Some
Music," and "Conversations"
Friday night took the album
material beyond its own limits.
Drummer Aynsley Dunbar also
picked up energy for the second
set, lending perfect control to
"Kohoutek," the band's
instrumental masterpiece that is
fraught with difficult, abrupt time
changes. Rhythm guitarist George
Tickner supported Gregg Rolie's
synthesizer and Schon's guitar,
giving "Kohoutek" exceptional
energy.
But beyond any individual
performances, it was the solidarity
with which Journey performed
their second set that made it
unique, the perfect example of
their musical prowess.

NOSTALGIA UNLIMITED-Manhattan Transfer, one of New York's
hottest nightclub attractions, will perform their Bay Area premiere
tonight at the Boarding House in San Francisco. The four vocalists
sing everything from '20s swing to contemporary rock.
SAN JOSE — It was a scene
totally beyond belief, beyond the
grasp of the two capacity crowds
that filled the 7 and 11 p.m.
shows at the new Center for the
Performing Arts Friday.
Devadip Carlos Santana,
dressed in simple white pants and
shirt, wearing a button bearing the
image of his guru, Sri Chinmoy;
NeaJ Schon, wearing a bright red
velvet suit. The two, sitting on a
practice amp in Journey's dressing
room, jammed for 20 minutes
between shows, holding a small
audience of friends spellbound.
When Santana and Schon
finished, the only response was
silence — the only possible
response to perhaps the two
greatest guitarists in the world.
Quantum Leap
Out on stage, it was clear that
two virtuosos are taking the same
instrument in different stylistic
directions, but that each in his
own way represents a quantum
leap beyond all that has gone
before.
Most important, Carlos
Santana has returned to the old
style of Latin-based rock that
made his first band revolutionary.
Debuted March 23 at the SNACK
benefit, the newest Santana style
takes the old songs and
incorporates all the newer guitar
intricacies of the last three years
of Santana's personal musical
growth.
To some extent the old songs
such as "Toussaint L'Overture,"
"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy
Queen," and "Soul Sacrifice" can
never sound the same. The loss of

Jose Chepito Areas, Michael
Shrieve, Schon, and Gregg Rolie
has necessarily changed the
Santana sound — none of the old
personnel has been adequately
replaced.
