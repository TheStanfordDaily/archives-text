# S.F. Ballet's 'Shinju' A Welcome Addition
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
SAN FRANCISCO - "Think
of a ballet where there are two
dancers dressed in black and
waving butterflies on the ends of
poles. It sounds stupid. But when
you see it, it's beautiful."
That's how choreographer
Michael Smuin summed up his
newest ballet, Shinju, after a
matinee performance in War
Memorial Opera House March 29.
Shinju is based on a story by
the Japanese dramatist,
Chikamatsu. It centers on two
lovers who are separated by forces
of authority. The lovers commit
suicide, preferring death together
to life apart.
But it is much more than a
Romeo-Juliet tragedy. Shinju is a
forceful blend of dance, dramatic
tension and Japanese theatrical

tradition.
Costumes designed by Willa
Kim are the most striking aspect
of Shinju's authenticity.
Gauzelike white tights give the
impression that the dancers' legs
are made of porcelain. The
kimono-like tunics worn by Anita
Paciotti and Anton Ness as the
authority figures were exquisite,
but not overdone.
Billowing Backdrop
Kim's simple set designs were
equally impressive. For the death
scene, three gauzy white curtains
billowed from ceiling to floor,
soft but stark against the black
background.
The suicide takes place beneath
the symbol of the tragedy, the
butterfly. Smuin employs the
Japanese theater convention of
shadowmen — prop-persons

dressed in black — to extend the
butterfly motif. In one touching
scene, the young woman attempts
to capture two butterflies. The
shadowmen wave them just
beyond her reach. In the final
moment of the ballet, the
shadowmen return to dangle two
slowly fluttering butterflies over
the dying couple.
Unexpected Twists
The music was
custom-composed by Paul Seiko
Chihara. Like Smuin's
choreography, it is packed with
unexpected twists. During the
suicide scene, the boom of drums
rattles every seat in the
auditorium.
That's not the only startling
aspect of the suicide. The blood
that spurts from the knife wounds
is nothing more than well-timed

scarlet streamers. But the effect is
realistic enough to make a viewer
squirm.
The audience gets plenty of
time to recover. The lovers
become tangled together in the
blood-streamers and then spend a
lot of time dying. The one
weakness in Shinju is that the
action is overly dragged out. After
a monotonous interlude by the
two authority figures, the
fast-paced flight scene is a
welcome contrast. John McFall,
the leader of a trio of ruffians,
proved that ballet and martial arts
can be mixed.
Smuin's Surprises
Unpredictability is Shinju's
strong suit. The choreography is
punctuated with surprises. Flexed
feet suddenly dart into points.
The young woman unfolds in her
lover's arms like a falling
windowshade.
Shinju presented a challenge to
the dancers who performed it on
Saturday. As the lovers, Madelaine
Bouchard and Attila Ficzere led
the second-string cast. The rough
edges in their movements and
interpretations will undoubtedly
be smoothed by more experience
in the roles.
Smuin's new work is a
welcome addition to the San
Francisco Ballet's repertoire. So is
Tealia, an "underwater" pas de
deux that is part of a work in
progress by McFall.
Betsy Erickson and Vane Vest
performed Tealia on Saturday.
They worked well together, and
the lighting and backdrop
accentuated the fluidity of their
movements.
The program opened with Airs
de Ballet, a light-hearted ballet
romp. Lew Christensen, the
company's artistic director,
choreographed the work for
Violette Verdy of the New York
City Ballet. But it is hard to

imagine a dancer more suited to
the lead role than San Francisco's
ballerina, Linda Meyer.
Her lightness and vitality made
Alexander Filipov's comparatively
uninspired performance seem
worse than it was. But Filipov's
spotty timing detracted little from
the lively dancing of Tina Santos,
Michael Thomas and Laurie
Cowden.
Saturday's final work was The
Four Temperaments, a Balanchine
ballet based on the idea that the
human spirit is composed of four
different humors. Unfortunately,
you can't tell the temperaments
apart without a program. The
confusion is mostly due to the
choreography. Symbolism aside,
the principals performed a
stunning dance etude with strong
backup from an able and precise
corps.

for the Performing Arts. Although two sellout shows produced no on stage jamming, Santana and Schon delighted backstage guests with 20
minutes of astounding improvisation.
