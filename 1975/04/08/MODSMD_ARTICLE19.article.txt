# Symphony Concert: Perfect
## 
### MARY INGERSOLL 
If a symphony concert can be
perfect, then that describes the
San Francisco Symphony's
concert last Wednesday night.
Guest conductor Hans Vonk
led the Orchestra in flawless
performances of Bartok's Piano
Concerto No. 3, Haydn's
Symphony No. 82 in C Major
(The Bear) and Schumann's
Symphony No. 2 in C Major,
Opus 61.
Pianist Jean-Bernard Pommier
soloed in the Bartok.
The music world is presently
flooded with young pianists with
varying degrees of talent, but
Pommier is certainly one of the
best. His fingers flowed over the
keys effortlessly to make the
piano speak the language of
Bartok; a sadness at his
approaching death, a haste to
complete his final manuscripts
and the final sad moments with
his wife.
Curiously, the piece was never
completed by Bartok, but by a

friend who completed the scoring
after Bartok's death. The concerto
was premiered in 1946 by the
Philadelphia Orchestra.
Pommier and the Orchestra
were well-suited to each other,
blending sounds to form a single,
smooth entity. They were always
together, always sensitive to each
other's whims and thus created a
fine product.
Equally fine was the
performance of Haydn's
Symphony No. 2 in C Major (The
Bear), which the Orchestra played
cleanly and precisely. Haydn was
the master of classical
composition and lilting, clear
melodies, with an element of
humor or satire. The Bear is one
of his most likeable symphonies,
with growling basses portraying
the antics of the bear.
The works of Haydn are
finding a renewed popularity with
today's audiences, partially

because of the uncluttered
melodies and "back to basics"
classical form. Judging from this
performance, Haydn should be
pleased.
Schumann's Symphony No. 2
completed the excellent program.
Concertgoers are often unfamiliar
with the No. 2 as the No. 1 and
No. 4 are more popular, but it is
no less worthy a symphony.
Once again, the Orchestra was
at its best. The music was lively
and precise, with dramatic
dynamic contrasts that
highlighted the themes. It is a
pleasure to hear fine music played
so well.
Conductor Vonk and the San
Francisco Symphony are newly
acquainted in this week's
concerts. He is equally at home
with modern, classical or romantic
music and produced one of the
best concerts of the season.

of his most likeable symphonies,
with growling basses portraying
the antics of the bear.
The works of Haydn are
finding a renewed popularity with
today's audiences, partially

because of the uncluttered
melodies and "back to basics"
classical form. Judging from this
performance, Haydn should be
pleased.
Schumann's Symphony No. 2
completed the excellent program.
Concertgoers are often unfamiliar
with the No. 2 as the No. 1 and
No. 4 are more popular, but it is
no less worthy a symphony.
Once again, the Orchestra was
at its best. The music was lively
and precise, with dramatic
dynamic contrasts that
highlighted the themes. It is a
pleasure to hear fine music played
so well.
Conductor Vonk and the San
Francisco Symphony are newly
acquainted in this week's
concerts. He is equally at home
with modern, classical or romantic
music and produced one of the
best concerts of the season.
If a symphony concert can be
perfect, then that describes the
San Francisco Symphony's
concert last Wednesday night.
Guest conductor Hans Vonk
led the Orchestra in flawless
performances of Bartok's Piano
Concerto No. 3, Haydn's
Symphony No. 82 in C Major
(The Bear) and Schumann's
Symphony No. 2 in C Major,
Opus 61.
Pianist Jean-Bernard Pommier
soloed in the Bartok.
The music world is presently
flooded with young pianists with
varying degrees of talent, but
Pommier is certainly one of the
best. His fingers flowed over the
keys effortlessly to make the
piano speak the language of
Bartok; a sadness at his
approaching death, a haste to
complete his final manuscripts
and the final sad moments with
his wife.
Curiously, the piece was never
completed by Bartok, but by a

friend who completed the scoring
after Bartok's death. The concerto
was premiered in 1946 by the
Philadelphia Orchestra.
Pommier and the Orchestra
were well-suited to each other,
blending sounds to form a single,
smooth entity. They were always
together, always sensitive to each
other's whims and thus created a
fine product.
Equally fine was the
performance of Haydn's
Symphony No. 2 in C Major (The
Bear), which the Orchestra played
cleanly and precisely. Haydn was
the master of classical
composition and lilting, clear
melodies, with an element of
humor or satire. The Bear is one
of his most likeable symphonies,
with growling basses portraying
the antics of the bear.
