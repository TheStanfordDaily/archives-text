# Students Will Vote On C-15 Proposal
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
The ASSU Senate voted 7-1 last
night to place a referendum before the
students on the recommendations of
the Committee of 15 (C-15) to
restructure the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP). The referendum is slated for the
final ASSU election April 23 and 24.
The Senate also placed three
constitutional amendment proposals
on the ballot.
An amendment to delete sexist
wording in the constitution was put
on the ballot by a vote of 14-0.
Also placed on the ballot by
unanimous vote was an amendment
stating that a fee assessment would be
approved if 10 percent of the student
body voted yes on it, and if that 10
percent represented a majority of the
voter turnout.
Current Problems
Currently there must be a 20
percent voter turnout and a majority
of voters must vote yes for a fee
assessment to receive approval.
The proposal was made because
under the current system it is
sometimes better for those opposing
an assessment to boycott an election
rather than vote no. For example,
under the current system, an
assessment approved by 18 percent of
the student body and disapproved by
no one would fail, while an assessment
approved 18 percent to three percent
would pass.
The third amendment, allowing the
hiring of a full-time financial manager
by eliminating the requirement that
the manager be a student, was placed
on the ballot 13-1.
Little Discussion
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
requested the referendum, pointed out
to the Senate that C-15 proposals have
traditionally been presented to the
student body. He added that it was
important that students know about a
procedure which could affect them.
The referendum was placed on the
ballot with little discussion.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
reported that Special Events Director
Danny Scher is considering other
contracts which would probably
prevent him from working for the

ASSU this summer.
Mayer urged that the Finance
Committee meet with Scher soon to
"discuss mutually agreeable terms,"
noting that the sooner Scher is
contacted, the better the ASSU's
chances of making an agreement.
New Applicants Considered
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri announced that he and his
successor Chris Cline are considering
applicants for a new special events
director.
'The Office of Financial Manager
does not wish to employ Scher,"
Olivieri said.
Application deadlines are next
Monday, Olivieri added.

body voted yes on it, and if that 10
percent represented a majority of the
voter turnout.
Current Problems
Currently there must be a 20
percent voter turnout and a majority
of voters must vote yes for a fee
assessment to receive approval.
The proposal was made because
under the current system it is
sometimes better for those opposing
an assessment to boycott an election
rather than vote no. For example,
under the current system, an
assessment approved by 18 percent of
the student body and disapproved by
no one would fail, while an assessment
approved 18 percent to three percent
would pass.
The third amendment, allowing the
hiring of a full-time financial manager
by eliminating the requirement that
the manager be a student, was placed
on the ballot 13-1.
Little Discussion
ASSU President Mike Herman, who
requested the referendum, pointed out
to the Senate that C-15 proposals have
traditionally been presented to the
student body. He added that it was
important that students know about a
procedure which could affect them.
The referendum was placed on the
ballot with little discussion.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
reported that Special Events Director
Danny Scher is considering other
contracts which would probably
prevent him from working for the

ASSU this summer.
Mayer urged that the Finance
Committee meet with Scher soon to
"discuss mutually agreeable terms,"
noting that the sooner Scher is
contacted, the better the ASSU's
chances of making an agreement.
New Applicants Considered
ASSU Financial Manager Frank
Olivieri announced that he and his
successor Chris Cline are considering
applicants for a new special events
director.
'The Office of Financial Manager
does not wish to employ Scher,"
Olivieri said.
Application deadlines are next
Monday, Olivieri added.
