$73.2 Billion Deficit Predicted
WASHINGTON — House budget makers are projecting a
1976-77 government deficit figure of about $73.2 billion —
more red ink than President Ford says he can tolerate, but
well below what he says he fears from a high-spending
Congress.
A House Budget Committee spokesman said figures
probably will shift during the Committee's deliberations as
updated economic data are worked into the calculations,
but that the final deficit figure is not likely to vary much
from $73.2 billion.
It is based on estimates that government outlays will
reach $368.2 billion in the coming fiscal year, against
revenues of $295 billion. The revenue estimate assumes that
major income tax reductions voted for the calendar year
1975 will be continued.
In constructing its spending estimate, the Committee
went a long way with Ford on one of his more controversial
recommendations and differed from the spending
projections of a number of legislative committees which
forecast higher outlays.
Ford recommended that cost-of-living increases, both in
the way of government, civilian and military personnel and
in federal pension payments — including Social Security —
be limited to five percent. Most estimates have been that a
full cost of living increase would be substantially higher.
Ford Calls More Spending 'Gambling'
LAS VEGAS — President Ford said yesterday that
Congress would be gambling with the nation's economic
strength if it pushes through a group of proposed spending
bills.
The President earlier yesterday ended his nine-day Easter
vacation at Palm Springs and headed back to Washington
after stopping in Las Vegas to address the National
Association of Broadcasters.
Ford told the broadcasters that if all pending bills were
enacted they could produce a federal deficit of $100
billion.
"That would be a disaster," he declared in the text of
the speech released before he left Palm Springs.
Ford also criticized the Congress for giving him a tax
cut bill that went beyond his request.
"I signed the tax cut bill, because it was urgently needed
to stimulate the economy," he said. "Our continuing
concern is the overstimulation of the economy through
excessive government spending."
He said the administration's projected deficit was $58
billion, now increased to $60 billion by the tax cut.
"We should draw the line at $60 billion," he said. "But
it now looks as if Congress will undertake an entire series of
new spending initiatives despite my request for a

moratorium. A possible deficit of $100 billion is
projected."
"Such a huge deficit is alarming because of the impact it
would have on the money market," the President declared.
"The more government has to borrow to finance the federal
deficit, the less money is available for individuals and
businesses."
He said that if the deficit for next year was only $50
billion, "we run the risk of re-igniting the fires of inflation.
Running a deficit of $100 billion is gambling with
the nation's economic strength."
Connally Accuser's Credibility Doubted
WASHINGTON — John Connally's lawyer attempted
yesterday to paint the former Treasury secretary's chief
accuser as an embezzler and liar who once offered to
incriminate former President Lyndon Johnson to escape a
fraud investigation.
"Do you deny that you offered to give evidence to the
Department of Justice against the former president who
you had worked for'?" the witness, Jake Jacobsen, was
asked.
"Yes, sir, I deny that," said the man who now insists
that Connally took $10,000 in illegal gifts for influencing a
1971 milk support price decision.
Edward Bennett Williams, in the first major
cross-examination at Connally's bribery trial, attacked
Jacobsen's credibility through prolonged readings from
former sworn testimony in which Jacobsen said he had not
given Connally the payoff.
Williams' question about Johnson, whom Jacobsen had
served as legislative counsel in the White House for two
years, followed a series of questions about a fraud
investigation by the Department of Justice in 1972.
Explosions Rock PG&E Substation
SAN JOSE — Three explosions, apparently bombs,
ripped through a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. substation early
today, police said. Terrorists bombed the same substation
two weeks ago.
A Santa Clara County sheriff's spokesman said the
explosions occurred at 12:15 a.m. A bomb squad rushed to
the scene.
The spokesman said there were no known injuries.
IRS Chief Wants Congressional Inquiry
WASHINGTON — The head of the Internal Revenue
Service said yesterday there is need for an outside
investigation of allegations of corruption and improper
activities by the tax agency.
Commissioner Donald Alexander said the agency is
investigating on its own accusations by some taxpayers of
bribery and payoffs of IRS agents in the Middle Atlantic
region of the country.
But Alexander said, "There is a real problem of
investigating ourselves ... Is there a need for an outside
investigation? The answer is yes."
He said he favors strengthening the investigative staff of
the Joint Committee of Congress for Internal Revenue
Taxation rather than establishing a new investigative
agency.

In constructing its spending estimate, the Committee
went a long way with Ford on one of his more controversial
recommendations and differed from the spending
projections of a number of legislative committees which
forecast higher outlays.
Ford recommended that cost-of-living increases, both in
the way of government, civilian and military personnel and
in federal pension payments — including Social Security —
be limited to five percent. Most estimates have been that a
full cost of living increase would be substantially higher.
Ford Calls More Spending 'Gambling'
LAS VEGAS — President Ford said yesterday that
Congress would be gambling with the nation's economic
strength if it pushes through a group of proposed spending
bills.
The President earlier yesterday ended his nine-day Easter
vacation at Palm Springs and headed back to Washington
after stopping in Las Vegas to address the National
Association of Broadcasters.
Ford told the broadcasters that if all pending bills were
enacted they could produce a federal deficit of $100
billion.
"That would be a disaster," he declared in the text of
the speech released before he left Palm Springs.
Ford also criticized the Congress for giving him a tax
cut bill that went beyond his request.
"I signed the tax cut bill, because it was urgently needed
to stimulate the economy," he said. "Our continuing
concern is the overstimulation of the economy through
excessive government spending."
He said the administration's projected deficit was $58
billion, now increased to $60 billion by the tax cut.
"We should draw the line at $60 billion," he said. "But
it now looks as if Congress will undertake an entire series of
new spending initiatives despite my request for a

moratorium. A possible deficit of $100 billion is
projected."
"Such a huge deficit is alarming because of the impact it
would have on the money market," the President declared.
"The more government has to borrow to finance the federal
deficit, the less money is available for individuals and
businesses."
He said that if the deficit for next year was only $50
billion, "we run the risk of re-igniting the fires of inflation.
Running a deficit of $100 billion is gambling with
the nation's economic strength."
Connally Accuser's Credibility Doubted
WASHINGTON — John Connally's lawyer attempted
yesterday to paint the former Treasury secretary's chief
accuser as an embezzler and liar who once offered to
incriminate former President Lyndon Johnson to escape a
fraud investigation.
"Do you deny that you offered to give evidence to the
Department of Justice against the former president who
you had worked for'?" the witness, Jake Jacobsen, was
asked.
"Yes, sir, I deny that," said the man who now insists
that Connally took $10,000 in illegal gifts for influencing a
1971 milk support price decision.
Edward Bennett Williams, in the first major
cross-examination at Connally's bribery trial, attacked
Jacobsen's credibility through prolonged readings from
former sworn testimony in which Jacobsen said he had not
given Connally the payoff.
Williams' question about Johnson, whom Jacobsen had
served as legislative counsel in the White House for two
years, followed a series of questions about a fraud
investigation by the Department of Justice in 1972.
Explosions Rock PG&E Substation
SAN JOSE — Three explosions, apparently bombs,
ripped through a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. substation early
today, police said. Terrorists bombed the same substation
two weeks ago.
A Santa Clara County sheriff's spokesman said the
explosions occurred at 12:15 a.m. A bomb squad rushed to
the scene.
The spokesman said there were no known injuries.
IRS Chief Wants Congressional Inquiry
WASHINGTON — The head of the Internal Revenue
Service said yesterday there is need for an outside
investigation of allegations of corruption and improper
activities by the tax agency.
Commissioner Donald Alexander said the agency is
investigating on its own accusations by some taxpayers of
bribery and payoffs of IRS agents in the Middle Atlantic
region of the country.
But Alexander said, "There is a real problem of
investigating ourselves ... Is there a need for an outside
investigation? The answer is yes."
He said he favors strengthening the investigative staff of
the Joint Committee of Congress for Internal Revenue
Taxation rather than establishing a new investigative
agency.

$73.2 Billion Deficit Predicted
WASHINGTON — House budget makers are projecting a
1976-77 government deficit figure of about $73.2 billion —
more red ink than President Ford says he can tolerate, but
well below what he says he fears from a high-spending
Congress.
A House Budget Committee spokesman said figures
probably will shift during the Committee's deliberations as
updated economic data are worked into the calculations,
but that the final deficit figure is not likely to vary much
from $73.2 billion.
It is based on estimates that government outlays will
reach $368.2 billion in the coming fiscal year, against
revenues of $295 billion. The revenue estimate assumes that
major income tax reductions voted for the calendar year
1975 will be continued.

Association of Broadcasters.
Ford told the broadcasters that if all pending bills were
enacted they could produce a federal deficit of $100
billion.
"That would be a disaster," he declared in the text of
the speech released before he left Palm Springs.
Ford also criticized the Congress for giving him a tax
cut bill that went beyond his request.
"I signed the tax cut bill, because it was urgently needed
to stimulate the economy," he said. "Our continuing
concern is the overstimulation of the economy through
excessive government spending."
He said the administration's projected deficit was $58
billion, now increased to $60 billion by the tax cut.
"We should draw the line at $60 billion," he said. "But
it now looks as if Congress will undertake an entire series of
new spending initiatives despite my request for a

moratorium. A possible deficit of $100 billion is
projected."
"Such a huge deficit is alarming because of the impact it
would have on the money market," the President declared.
"The more government has to borrow to finance the federal
deficit, the less money is available for individuals and
businesses."
He said that if the deficit for next year was only $50
billion, "we run the risk of re-igniting the fires of inflation.
Running a deficit of $100 billion is gambling with
the nation's economic strength."
Connally Accuser's Credibility Doubted
WASHINGTON — John Connally's lawyer attempted
yesterday to paint the former Treasury secretary's chief
accuser as an embezzler and liar who once offered to
incriminate former President Lyndon Johnson to escape a
fraud investigation.
"Do you deny that you offered to give evidence to the
Department of Justice against the former president who
you had worked for'?" the witness, Jake Jacobsen, was
asked.
"Yes, sir, I deny that," said the man who now insists
that Connally took $10,000 in illegal gifts for influencing a
1971 milk support price decision.
Edward Bennett Williams, in the first major
cross-examination at Connally's bribery trial, attacked
Jacobsen's credibility through prolonged readings from
former sworn testimony in which Jacobsen said he had not
given Connally the payoff.
Williams' question about Johnson, whom Jacobsen had
served as legislative counsel in the White House for two
years, followed a series of questions about a fraud
investigation by the Department of Justice in 1972.
Explosions Rock PG&E Substation
SAN JOSE — Three explosions, apparently bombs,
ripped through a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. substation early
today, police said. Terrorists bombed the same substation
two weeks ago.
A Santa Clara County sheriff's spokesman said the
explosions occurred at 12:15 a.m. A bomb squad rushed to
the scene.
The spokesman said there were no known injuries.
IRS Chief Wants Congressional Inquiry
WASHINGTON — The head of the Internal Revenue
Service said yesterday there is need for an outside
investigation of allegations of corruption and improper
activities by the tax agency.
Commissioner Donald Alexander said the agency is
investigating on its own accusations by some taxpayers of
bribery and payoffs of IRS agents in the Middle Atlantic
region of the country.
But Alexander said, "There is a real problem of
investigating ourselves ... Is there a need for an outside
investigation? The answer is yes."
He said he favors strengthening the investigative staff of
the Joint Committee of Congress for Internal Revenue
Taxation rather than establishing a new investigative
agency.

$73.2 Billion Deficit Predicted
WASHINGTON — House budget makers are projecting a
1976-77 government deficit figure of about $73.2 billion —
more red ink than President Ford says he can tolerate, but
well below what he says he fears from a high-spending
Congress.
A House Budget Committee spokesman said figures
probably will shift during the Committee's deliberations as
updated economic data are worked into the calculations,
but that the final deficit figure is not likely to vary much
from $73.2 billion.
It is based on estimates that government outlays will
reach $368.2 billion in the coming fiscal year, against
revenues of $295 billion. The revenue estimate assumes that
major income tax reductions voted for the calendar year
1975 will be continued.
In constructing its spending estimate, the Committee
went a long way with Ford on one of his more controversial
recommendations and differed from the spending
projections of a number of legislative committees which
forecast higher outlays.
Ford recommended that cost-of-living increases, both in
the way of government, civilian and military personnel and
in federal pension payments — including Social Security —
be limited to five percent. Most estimates have been that a
full cost of living increase would be substantially higher.
Ford Calls More Spending 'Gambling'
LAS VEGAS — President Ford said yesterday that
Congress would be gambling with the nation's economic
strength if it pushes through a group of proposed spending
bills.
The President earlier yesterday ended his nine-day Easter
vacation at Palm Springs and headed back to Washington
after stopping in Las Vegas to address the National
Association of Broadcasters.
