### 
Two students escaped death Sunday when they freed
themselves from an overturned car submerged in the
American River near Placerville.
James Polk, 21, a senior, swerved to avoid a wideturning
car coming in the opposite direction. The car slid off U.S.
Highway 50 and fell 15 feet down a stone embankment
into the river.
Polk's friend, freshman Lori Huebner, 18, pushed the
passenger-side door open after the car had filled with water.
The two swam to shore and were pulled up to the road by a
former highway patrolman who saw the car turn over.
Polk and Huebner were treated for cuts and bruises and
were back at school yesterday.
