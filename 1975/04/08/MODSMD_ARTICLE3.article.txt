# Miller Denies Reversing Gibbs' SCIRE Proposal
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Provost William Miller yesterday
denied that his decision to continue
the SCIRE program next year with
half its current funding represented a
reversal of earlier recommendations by
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
Appearing at a taping of KZSU's
Campus Conference scheduled for
broadcast tonight, Miller insisted that
the SCIRE continuation "was, in fact
the dean's recommendation. He never
recommended discontinuation. He did
recommend a phasing-down of that
program."
However, a Gibbs memo to Miller
in January recommended that SCIRE
courses be incorporated into existing
University departments after this June.
But Gibbs had offered an alternative
whereby the program would continue
with a half-time director working out
of his office.
Miller claimed that the only portion
of his SCIRE decision which differed
from Gibbs' original proposal was the
continuation of the program's policy
board. Gibbs had asked that it be

eliminated.
Despite its "dramatically decreasing
enrollment," Miller said SCIRE
maintains sufficient interest to merit
funding at the reduced level. He
indicated that if student response to
the program does not drop still
further, it would be continued with
the decreased funding support
Won't Guarantee
But Miller backed off from any
guarantee that threatened
"innovative" programs such as SCIRE
and SWOPSI could be continued
indefinitely on a reduced scale. "We
don't know what to expect," the
Provost said.
Questioned repeatedly about his
recent denial of a tenure appeal by
Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish, Miller refused to "comment on a
particular case."
Miller again maintained that "it
would be improper to conclude that
research is taking precedence over
teaching" in University tenure
decisions. He did admit that "it is
often easier to evaluate scholarship"
than to judge teaching.
Uncited Examples
But Miller spoke of "examples of
individuals whom I will not cite"
whose tenure awards were largely
attributable to teaching.

(A&P) Committee can request that the

consulted only members of the A&P

abdicate its responsibilities," Miller
said.
Additionally, such evaluative
processes require experience in
judgment which students do not
possess, the provost said.
Miller reiterated his fear that
continued grade inflation would force
graduate schools to concentrate on
board scores in their admission
selections.
If such were the case,
undergraduates would devote their
academic schedules to preparation for
aptitude tests and would "orient
f.hemselves toward satisfying those
requirements, [which] would become
narrower and narrower. Those
[testing] agencies would then dictate
our curriculum," said Miller.

The Faculty Senate, in a tenative
vote, has indicated it will reinstate the
D grade and not institute an early drop
deadline in response to grade inflation.
But Miller contended that "the real
issue has not quite surfaced [before
the Senate]: do we record a student's
performance or do we only show a
record of achievement?"
The resolution of that question will
foreshadow the Senate's final decision
on the drop deadline, Miller predicted.
The provost also claimed that the
issue of possible University refusal to
collect an upcoming student fee
assessment to finance a lawsuit over
parking "hasn't been raised at the
administration level."
"I don't know of any case" in
which the University has refused to
collect student monies which then
would be used against it, Miller said.

said.
Additionally, such evaluative
processes require experience in
judgment which students do not
possess, the provost said.
Miller reiterated his fear that
continued grade inflation would force
graduate schools to concentrate on
board scores in their admission
selections.
If such were the case,
undergraduates would devote their
academic schedules to preparation for
aptitude tests and would "orient
f.hemselves toward satisfying those
requirements, [which] would become
narrower and narrower. Those
[testing] agencies would then dictate
our curriculum," said Miller.

The Faculty Senate, in a tenative
vote, has indicated it will reinstate the
D grade and not institute an early drop
deadline in response to grade inflation.
But Miller contended that "the real
issue has not quite surfaced [before
the Senate]: do we record a student's
performance or do we only show a
record of achievement?"
The resolution of that question will
foreshadow the Senate's final decision
on the drop deadline, Miller predicted.
The provost also claimed that the
issue of possible University refusal to
collect an upcoming student fee
assessment to finance a lawsuit over
parking "hasn't been raised at the
administration level."
"I don't know of any case" in
which the University has refused to
collect student monies which then
would be used against it, Miller said.
Provost William Miller yesterday
denied that his decision to continue
the SCIRE program next year with
half its current funding represented a
reversal of earlier recommendations by
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs.
Appearing at a taping of KZSU's
Campus Conference scheduled for
broadcast tonight, Miller insisted that
the SCIRE continuation "was, in fact
the dean's recommendation. He never
recommended discontinuation. He did
recommend a phasing-down of that
program."
However, a Gibbs memo to Miller
in January recommended that SCIRE
courses be incorporated into existing
University departments after this June.
But Gibbs had offered an alternative
whereby the program would continue
with a half-time director working out
of his office.
Miller claimed that the only portion
of his SCIRE decision which differed
from Gibbs' original proposal was the
continuation of the program's policy
board. Gibbs had asked that it be

eliminated.
Despite its "dramatically decreasing
enrollment," Miller said SCIRE
maintains sufficient interest to merit
funding at the reduced level. He
indicated that if student response to
the program does not drop still
further, it would be continued with
the decreased funding support
Won't Guarantee
But Miller backed off from any
guarantee that threatened
"innovative" programs such as SCIRE
and SWOPSI could be continued
indefinitely on a reduced scale. "We
don't know what to expect," the
Provost said.
Questioned repeatedly about his
recent denial of a tenure appeal by
Asst. Religious Studies Prof. Jerry
Irish, Miller refused to "comment on a
particular case."
Miller again maintained that "it
would be improper to conclude that
research is taking precedence over
teaching" in University tenure
decisions. He did admit that "it is
often easier to evaluate scholarship"
than to judge teaching.
Uncited Examples
But Miller spoke of "examples of
individuals whom I will not cite"
whose tenure awards were largely
attributable to teaching.
