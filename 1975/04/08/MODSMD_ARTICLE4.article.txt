# Group Protests Debt Financing Of Buildings
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A group of students in close
contact with the Board of Trustees is
objecting to the University's plan to
partially finance the construction of
three academic buildings through a
debt to be repaid out of funds largely
supplied by tuition payments.
The group includes Bill Faught and
Kevin McDermott, members of the
Board's Finance and Development
Committee; ASSU Vice President
Quinn Mayer, an observer to the
Academic Affairs Committee; and
Ralph Samuelson, a member of the
University Library Committee. The
Board meets today in San Francisco.
The plan to which they object is
contained in the report "Facilities Plan
and Capital Funding Forecast,"
released in March.
This plan calls for the borrowing of
$11.7 million from the California
Educational Facilities Authority
(CEFA) to finance the new Seeley
Mudd Chemistry Building and the
reconstruction of Buildings 200 and
460 on the Main Quadrangle.
The money will also be used as a
reserve in case fundraising targets for a
new library Call short of expectations.
The $11.7 million will be amortized
over a 25-year period, beginning this
year. The University will repay $1
million per year entirely out of
operating budget funds, 51 percent of
which are supplied by tuition and fees.
This represents a major shift in
University policy, which previously
had been to construct academic
buildings only through donations,
without borrowing any money.
'Dangerous'
Mayer called the plan "a dangerous
policy," saying there "is no way to
argue that students won't be paying
more, since tuition is one of the few
items on the income side of the
operating budget that the University
can control."
In all, according to figures compiled
by the group, each student would pay
$51 to $100 per year for the three
buildings financed through CEFA
loans.
Faught said that if no loans were

taken out and if present tuition
projections were maintained, "it
would reduce the deficit by $1 million
and we would not have to go through
so many painful budget cuts" in other
areas.
Edward Shaw, executive assistant
to the vice president and provost,

agreed yesterday that fewer budget
cuts would have to be made if
construction plans were scrapped, but
defended the plans.
Shaw noted that firms generally
charge their customers for
depreciation on the plant. He
estimated the value of Stanford's
academic facilities at $250 million,
and said that $1 million per year was
"way under any standard textbook
estimate of depreciation."
Shaw did not rule out the
possibility of borrowing additional
money in the future to finance the
construction of buildings other than
these three, of which only the Mudd
Building has been formally approved
by the Board.
McDermott called the new method
of financing "a dangerous precedent.
Donors are going to say 'why should I
give money when you [the University]
can just borrow it anyway?' " He said
the policy would thus tend to
discourage donations and force the
University to borrow even more
money.
The group also objected to the
University's going into debt to finance
academic facilities. McDermott said,
"If the economy is going to be bad,
it's not worth taking the risk in taking
out a loan that we might not be able
to pay off.
"If the economy goes up, then we
shouldn't have taken out the loan
because our fundraising will improve,"
and the University will not need to
spend operating budget money for the
new buildings.
Shaw countered this argument by
noting that even in the best of times,
donations never fully covered the cost
of new buildings, with government and
foundation grants covering
approximately 30 percent of the costs.
He said that because these income
sources have dried up, the University
now needs to borrow money.
