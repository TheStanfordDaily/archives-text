# Olivieri, University Reach Investment Compromise
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
The ASSU financial manager and a
University official in charge of
investments have apparently reached a
compromise on the nature of corporate
bond investments the ASSU is
permitted to make.
Frank Olivieri and University
Director of Finance Rodney Adams
have agreed that the "Approved List"
for ASSU investment will be expanded
to allow the purchase of the more risky
A-rated corporate bonds.
An April 4 memo from Olivieri to
Adams also states that "no more than
20 percent of the ASSU's holdings can
be in corporate bonds" rated as A by
the Moody's or Stanford & Poor's
bond guides.
Prior to this agreement, the
Approved List did not permit
investment in A bonds.
Olivieri's $246,000 in corporate
bond investments now include some
$32,000 worth of A bonds â€” 13
percent of the total investment. The
money invested comes from ASSU
operating reserves.
The financial manager sold $5000
worth of A-rated Avco Finance bonds
yesterday, but denied that the sale was
the direct result of pressure from
Adams that the bonds might prove too
risky in terms of likelihood of default.
Adding that he will probably
reinvest the principle and interest from
the Avco bonds in those of another
A-rated company, he emphasized the
need for diversity through investment

in bonds with different ratings.
Higher risk A-rated bonds usually
pay more interest than their safer AAA
and AA counterparts.
Though agreement was reached on
the expansion of the Approved List for
investment, it is still unclear just who
has the final say on what investments
the ASSU can make.
Olivieri contended last week that
the University's Approved List applied
only to the $114,000 "underwriting"
comprised of money left over from
previous projects. The money was
transferred last summer from a
University investment fund to Olivieri.
He doubted the University's right to
interfere in ASSU investments of the
remaining $137,000 from the ASSU's
operating profits.
Olivieri stated in the April 4 memo
to Adams that "I have great trouble
with the concept that the Association's
monies should be viewed as one pool
of funds without consideration to their
original sources."
But he conceded that "our
expansion of the rules governing the
portfolio will have the net effect of
consolidating all ASSU funds under
one umbrella.*'
Whether the University has power
over that umbrella is uncertain, but
Assoc. Staff Legal Counsel George
Gregory said yesterday he doesn't
think "that issue is particularly
germane at this point" as long as the
financial manager and the University
can agree, as they did yesterday, on
which investments are allowable.
