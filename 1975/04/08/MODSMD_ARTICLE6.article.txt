# Thieu Escapes Unharmed In Attack
## South Viet Jet Bombs Palace 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — A camouflaged jet warplane of the
South Vietnamese air force bombed the downtown palace
of President Nguyen Van Thieu yesterday, shattering
windows in the modem four-story building.
Witnesses said the U.S.-made F5 swooped in at the
2000-foot level over the palace and dropped at least two
and possibly four 500-pound bombs.
Nguyen Quoc Cuong, the chief government spokesman,
reported Thieu and his family were not injured. Palace
sources said two persons were killed and three were
wounded, but it was not known if they were in the palace
or surrounding gardens.
Political Pressure
Thieu is under intense political pressure to resign
because of the collapsing battlefield situation.
Western sources said two F5 jets took off from Bien Hoa
Air Base 15 miles northeast of Saigon for an air strike on
Viet Cong positions. The sources said one peeled off and
attacked the palace.
Saigon radio announced a 24-hour curfew for Saigon and
its three million inhabitants and there were massive traffic

jams as the people headed for home. Schools closed, stores
were locked with their shutters drawn and loudspeaker vans
circulated through the snarled traffic, advising residents
that they must stay inside until the curfew is lifted.
Communist Attacks
Communist-led troops increased their attacks yesterday
on district capitals in the Mekong Delta, the only sizable
piece of territory still held by the government. There were
no major moves against Saigon.
South Vietnamese military spokesmen said 10 Delta
capitals were shelled. They also reported a fuel center six
miles from Saigon was hit with 60 rocket and mortar
rounds.
Saigon commanders were planning defenses against an
anticipated onslaught by North Vietnamese-Viet Cong
forces that have gobbled up the northern three-quarters of
South Vietnam in three weeks against light resistance.
Meanwhile, the big evacuation of Vietnamese orphans
from Saigon officially ended yesterday as the last of more
than 1700 children flew to new homes abroad under
Operation Baby Lift. A South Vietnamese official said from
now on the orphans will leave on a reduced scale.
