# Drivers Protest Recommended Parking Rates
## 
### MARK LICKER 
Members of the University
community complained that parking
fees proposed in th? Carpenter parking
report are unfair at a public hearing
held last night by the Parking
Subcommittee of the University
Committee on Land and Building
Development.
The Parking Subcommittee will
make its report to the parent
committee on April 17. The final
Committee report will be presented to
President Lyman on April 25.
David Charnov, a resident associate
in Escondido Village, criticized the
proposed $48 annual parking fees for
residents who do not usually drive
vehicles into the Carpenter report's
"Academic Zone."
This zone includes the area in
which faculty, staff and students are
expected to desire parking for work
and classes.
Fees A 'Surtax'
Roland Finston, representing
United Stanford Employees, called
proposed parking fees for staff a
"surtax." He suggested incentives for
bicycle use and car pools.
An unsigned letter with the
letterhead of the Stanford Campus
Homeowners' Association, circulated

yesterday, claimed that the proposed
fee structure would cost members a
$48 annual parking fee per car, and
also $2 to $10 for guest and service
vehicle street parking.
The report's author, Peter
Carpenter, stated that his plan suggests
prehibition of street parking, but that
long term leaseholders would not have
to pay for parking on their property.
Equity Vs. Simplicity
In formulating a parking and
transportation plan, he commented,
"equity and simplicity are mortal
enemies. The simplest system would
be no regulations at all. Many schools
start with open parking, then
accumulate complicated rules without
an underlying logic."
Carpenter responded to complaints
that the report lacked specificity:
'There's no end to the list of
recommendations which could be
employed."
But he did emphasize his hope to
discourage use of cars, saying "the
report does stress alternative
transportation for commuting
students," most of whom live within a
three-mile radius of campus.
The report is a five-month study of
transportation and parking at
Stanford.
