# Impact On Engineering School
## William M. Kays 
### 
I have been asked by the Daily to
write a few words about the potential
impact of the pending budget
reductions on the School of
Engineering.
I would first like to make two
general remarks. Any reduction in
general funds allocated to the School
of Engineering will have at least some
adverse effect upon the programs of
the School.

The general budget squeeze during
the last five years has taken virtually
all of the fat out of the budget and
there is no question that further
reductions are going to hurt. The
problem is one of minimizing that
hurt.
The second point is that very few
decisions have yet been made about
budget reduction. The budget
reduction target for the 1975/76
budget is only 25 percent of the
total. Thus most of the "easy" items
have been incorporated into next
"year's budget. The real problems lie
ahead.
Restricted Funds
A substantial part of the School of
Engineering's target for 1975/76 is
being made by allocation of other
restricted funds into the operating
budget and by changing some of the
ways that we do things.
The allocation of restricted funds
to the budget simply means that we no
longer have these funds to use in the
ways that we have traditionally been
using them. In particular, there will be
less money available to allocate to
graduate student fellowships.
We are adopting a policy of not
replacing the teaching done by
professors who go on sabbatical leave.
The nei result will be a modest average
increase in class size and some courses
won't be given every year.
Systems Design
We will no longer fund the Systems
Design course, Engineering 235,
although we do feel that it is going to be
practicable to carry on this course
using external funds.
There will be a small reduction in
the faculty size due to the elimination
of some vacancies and partial
vacancies.
It is not contemplated that any
faculty members presently on campus
will be terminated for budget cutting
reasons. So much for the first phase of
the budget reduction.
Phase Two
The next phase is the far more
serious one and the one over which we
will undoubtedly agonize a great deal.
A series of budget reduction
alternatives, in ascending order of their
impact upon the school, have been
submitted to the provost. These will
be weighed against other similar
alternatives submitted from other
parts of the University.
Most of these involve elimination of
faculty slots and associate secretarial
positions. Some are positions that are
presently vacant or that are
anticipated to become vacant in the
next two or three years. Others,
especially as we go further down the
list, do involve real people.
The academic impact of most of
these alternatives will be felt most
heavily in the graduate program. There
is also a very considerable financial

impact implicit in most of these
proposed alternatives.
Research Funding
The average professor in the School
of Engineering brings in through his
own initiative about $90,000 per year
in external research funding. This
money is used partially to fund
himself, it is the major source of
support for graduate students, and it is
the basis for the support of a very
considerable part of the staff.
About a third of this money also
ends up in University overhead
charges, which is money which simply
goes into the University general funds
to support the research share of

indirect support costs (e.g., space,
administration, libraries, etc.).
Thus any elimination of faculty
positions in the School of Engineering
which have the potential of attracting
this kind of external research funding
can have a very considerable ripple
effect on the rest of the institution.
It is quite possible to do very severe
violence to the quality and reputation
of the School of Engineering without
substantial savings in general funds.
I know the provost understands
these things and I don't envy him the
task of making the choices that are
unquestionably going to have to be
made during the next year.

I have been asked by the Daily to
write a few words about the potential
impact of the pending budget
reductions on the School of
Engineering.
I would first like to make two
general remarks. Any reduction in
general funds allocated to the School
of Engineering will have at least some
adverse effect upon the programs of
the School.

The general budget squeeze during
the last five years has taken virtually
all of the fat out of the budget and
there is no question that further
reductions are going to hurt. The
problem is one of minimizing that
hurt.
The second point is that very few
decisions have yet been made about
budget reduction. The budget
reduction target for the 1975/76
budget is only 25 percent of the
total. Thus most of the "easy" items
have been incorporated into next
"year's budget. The real problems lie
ahead.
Restricted Funds
A substantial part of the School of
Engineering's target for 1975/76 is
being made by allocation of other
restricted funds into the operating
budget and by changing some of the
ways that we do things.
The allocation of restricted funds
to the budget simply means that we no
longer have these funds to use in the
ways that we have traditionally been
using them. In particular, there will be
less money available to allocate to
graduate student fellowships.
We are adopting a policy of not
replacing the teaching done by
professors who go on sabbatical leave.
The nei result will be a modest average
increase in class size and some courses
won't be given every year.
Systems Design
We will no longer fund the Systems
Design course, Engineering 235,
although we do feel that it is going to be
practicable to carry on this course
using external funds.
There will be a small reduction in
the faculty size due to the elimination
of some vacancies and partial
vacancies.
It is not contemplated that any
faculty members presently on campus
will be terminated for budget cutting
reasons. So much for the first phase of
the budget reduction.
Phase Two
The next phase is the far more
serious one and the one over which we
will undoubtedly agonize a great deal.
A series of budget reduction
alternatives, in ascending order of their
impact upon the school, have been
submitted to the provost. These will
be weighed against other similar
alternatives submitted from other
parts of the University.
Most of these involve elimination of
faculty slots and associate secretarial
positions. Some are positions that are
presently vacant or that are
anticipated to become vacant in the
next two or three years. Others,
especially as we go further down the
list, do involve real people.
The academic impact of most of
these alternatives will be felt most
heavily in the graduate program. There
is also a very considerable financial

impact implicit in most of these
proposed alternatives.
Research Funding
The average professor in the School
of Engineering brings in through his
own initiative about $90,000 per year
in external research funding. This
money is used partially to fund
himself, it is the major source of
support for graduate students, and it is
the basis for the support of a very
considerable part of the staff.
About a third of this money also
ends up in University overhead
charges, which is money which simply
goes into the University general funds
to support the research share of

indirect support costs (e.g., space,
administration, libraries, etc.).
Thus any elimination of faculty
positions in the School of Engineering
which have the potential of attracting
this kind of external research funding
can have a very considerable ripple
effect on the rest of the institution.
It is quite possible to do very severe
violence to the quality and reputation
of the School of Engineering without
substantial savings in general funds.
I know the provost understands
these things and I don't envy him the
task of making the choices that are
unquestionably going to have to be
made during the next year.
