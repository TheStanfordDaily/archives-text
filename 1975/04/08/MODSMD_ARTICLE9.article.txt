# Forum Page
## 
### 
The Forum Page is a regular
feature in the Daily, running every
Tuesday. Each forum will present a
spectrum of opinion about a single
issue relevant to the University
community.
The next forum will focus on
the food crisis. Persons in the
Stanford community who feel they
have an interesting approach to this
issue and are interested in writing a
column should contact Bruce
Kadden, Forum Page Editor, at the
Daily office.
