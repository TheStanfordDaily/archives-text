BEST DOCUMENTARY
"I found "Hearts and Minds" to be a pro
vocative movie, underlining once again the
errors we made in Vietnam and, I hope,
serving as a warning to us to never again
get involved in a similar situation. It is
certainly a strong, stimulating movie"
— Senator CLAIBORNE PELL (Rhode Island)
"This movie should be on everyone's list of
required viewing. This documentary is of
such importance that it should be circulated
nation-wide and shown in every town
throughout the country."
— Congressman TOBY MOFFETT
