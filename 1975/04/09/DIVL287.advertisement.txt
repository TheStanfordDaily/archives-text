TRAVEL IS BROADENING
Seize the time. Do it now. Don't wait (as these gentlemen
have not) for the rear-engine model. They arrived with a
little coal dust on their stovepipes, 'tis true, but in time to
take advantage of our first MARVELLOUS 10% DISCOUNT
SUNDAY last week. Everybody was there. Jules Verne, Lady
Brett Ashley, Richard Feverel, Fanny Burney. It was quite a
time. So join the stampede to our new bookstore at 711 Santa
Cruz in Menlo Park. Again this Sunday, a 10% discount on any
book in the store to student and faculty with I.D. Come on
down! (Over? Across?) Our hours are: Mon.-Thi:r 10 a.m.-
9 p.m. Fri & Sat 10 a.m.-11 p.m. Sun. 12-5 p.m.
