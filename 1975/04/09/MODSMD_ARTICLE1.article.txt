# Board Gives Construction Approval
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The Board of Trustees yesterday
cleared the path for the construction
of four academic buildings on campus,
but showed signs of being unwilling to
routinely allow the University to go
into debt for construction projects.
At a joint meeting of all of the
Board's committees in San Francisco,
the Board overrode student objections
and approved the use of debt financing
for the four buildings. The Board did,
however, specifically limit debt
financing to a maximum of $11.7
million for construction of the four
buildings alone.
Of the projects, only the Seeley
Mudd Chemistry Building has been
formally approved. Construction of a
new library and reconstruction of
Buildings 200 and 460 in the Quad are
still awaiting final approval by the
Board.
Asked whether the Board's action
might foreshadow a period during
which no other academic buildings are
built, Vice Provost for Research
William Massy gave an admittedly
"oblique" answer which appeared to
be affirmative.
Need Fewer Buildings
"When we are in the situation
where we have to pay for buildings as
they go, I think we will understand
that we will need a lot fewer new
buildings than we thought we needed
in the past," Massy said.
"When you lay the cost of buildings
against the cost of academic programs,
you are very discriminating in deciding
to construct additional buildings," he
added.
But, according to Edward Shaw,
executive assistant to the vice
president and provost, in the specific
cases of these four buildings, the
Board "felt the projects were
important enough to warrant this
exception to general policy."
In the past, all academic buildings
have been financed entirely by private,
government and foundation donations.
Recently, however, the latter two
sources have dried up.
Trustee Capacity
Thus, the University decided to
borrow up to $11.7 million from the
California Educational Facilities
Authority (CEFA) to finance the four
new buildings. The money will be paid
back at a rate of $1 million per year
for 25 years, out of the general
operating budget. Fifty-one percent of
general operating funds come from
student tuition and fees.
ASSU Vice President Quinn Mayer
said last night he told the Board that
the plan "virtually lifted the student
to trustee capacity," because students
had to bear 51.6 percent of the debt
burden. "... With the historical trend
[of increased reliance on tuition]
likely to continue, that burden can
only increase over time," he said.
Mayer said he proposed that the
Board "select one of the four projects
as a priority among the four and
commence construction on it,"
without use of debt financing. Mayer
indicated his preference for the library
as the top priority project.
Construction Rates Rising
But the Board found arguments in
favor of constructing all four buildings
as soon as possible more convincing.
Massy said he argued that
construction costs are presently rising
at 12 to 15 percent annually, while the
rate of both other costs in the
University budget and donations to
the University were rising at a rate of
only 8 to 9 percent.
Thus, according to Massy, "the
more we wait," to construct the
buildings, "the more we'll have to raise
the tuition."
