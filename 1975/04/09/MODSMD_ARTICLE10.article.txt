Tim Cullinane (Daily, March 4)
argued that abortion is a right. I
disagree.
Cullinane stated that "the
manslaughter conviction of Dr.
Ken Edelin in Boston last week
for a legal abortion underlined the
threat to women's choice (sic) to
discontinue pregnancy."
I am in no position to judge
the legal merits of the Edelin
conviction. But the decision does
underline an important
philosophic question. Edelin was
not convicted for discontinuing a
pregnancy, but rather for killing
the child after separating him
from his mother.
If we must accept that a
mother has the right to
discontinue her pregnancy (and I
do not), why does it follow that

Bill MacDougall II
their unfortunate life to death.
Rather than killing or aborting
their unwanted child, the parents
should put the child up for
adoption. There is presently a
greai demand for adopted
children.
Cullinane consistently called
groups opposed to abortion
"forced pregnancy groups." But
most women are not forced to be
pregnant. When a woman
voluntarily has sexual intercourse,
she must accept the possibility of
pregnancy.
Immediate and continuous
action is needed to stop the killing
of more unborn human beings.
Students should urge members of
Congress to support a
constitutional amendment against
abortion.
(Bill MacDougall is a sophomore
majoring in history and
economics.)

once the child is no longer an
inconvenience to his mother he
must be put to death? If the child
— once removed from his
mother's womb — has any chance
of surviving. I believe we have a
moral obligation to save his life.
And any doctor who fails to
take all possible steps to save the
child's life is at best violating the
Hippocratic oath and at worst
guilty of manslaughter.
Cullinane called the showing of
a picture of the dead fetus a
"gross miscarriage of justice."
Pictures of napalm burned
children were used very effectively
during the Vietnam War to show
people just how horrible a weapon
napalm is.
By the same token, a picture of
a fetus is a legitimate means of

convincing people that a fetus is a
human being, not a tumor or a
bunch of mucus. Edehn called the
fetus a "product of conception,"
avoiding any reference even to its
human form. After seeing the
picture, the jury could only call
the fetus a baby.
Cullinane claimed that the
Whitehurst amendment would
"spell the end to a woman's right
to choose" to terminate a
pregnancy. In fact it would return
to the states the power usurped
by the Supreme Court to protect
or not to protect unborn children.
The Whitehurst amendment
would return us to the status quo
ante in which some states had
strict laws on abortion and others
liberal.
I support a much stronger
amendment similar to the Buckley
amendment which would prohibit
abortion except where necessary
to protect the mother from death
or serious bodily harm. But the
Whitehurst amendment would be
a tolerable compromise.
Cullinane stated that "a strong
majority favors legal abortion."
This is not true. A survey in May
1973 conducted by a respected
public opinion firm, Sindlinger &
Co., asked the following question:
"As far as you yourself are
concerned would you say you are
for or against abortion, or what
do you think?" They found that
"59.4 percent said they were
against abortion compared with
36.2 percent who favored it."
It is interesting to note that
"most of the opposition was
voiced by women as 62.7 percent
of the females interviewed
opposed abortion compared with
56 percent of the men. At the
same time, 39.7 percent of the
males interviewed and 32.9
percent of the females were for
abortion."

Cullinane next cited studies
showing that the unwanted child
is more likely to be beaten or
neglected. But why doesn't he ask
the child how it feels? Maybe he
knows that most of these
unwanted children would prefer
