# Pub Board Needs Fee Assessment
## 
### 
For the first time in three years, the ASSU
Publications Board is seeking a student fee
assessment. The Board's request — for a $1
refundable levy for fall and winter quarters —
will be on the forthcoming ASSU ballot, and
we'd like to commend it.
The Pub Board, which was created by the
ASSU constitution, is composed of some 12
campus publications, including the Quad,
Live Oak, Daily and Chaparral, as well as
Sequoia, Real News and Chicanismo.
However, the Board's concerns extend well
beyond merely its member publications;
rather, it's concerned with the viability and
needs of all publications here.
The Board's major responsibilities are the
allocation of space and money — two items
that are valuable commodities to any
publication. The Board controls space
allocation in the Storke Student Publications
Building, and has often, owing to a chronic
space shortage in Storke, been involved in
trying to locate working space for
publications in other locations as well.
In addition, the Board has given financial
aid — in the form of grants and/or interest
free loans — to a large number of
publications. In the current year alone, we've
helped fund no fewer than nine publications,
including the Chaparral, Live Oak, the

Stanford Review, the Gay People's Union
newspaper, the Catalyst and Min. Some of
these might never have appeared without the
Board's help.
Source Of Funds
The money to aid these organizations
comes from two sources. One is the Pub
Board's own money-making projects, the
Blotter and Moneybook. These are
contracted to an individual who does the
work and shares profits with the Board, and
have accounted for several thousand dollars
over the past three years.
The other source has been through
periodic fee assessments. As noted, the Board
sought its last assessment three full years ago
— or, to put it another way, the Board has
carefully managed its money and made that
1972 assessment last.
We're returning for another assessment
now for a number of reasons. One is that the
1972 assessment money is almost gone, and
that Blotter-Moneybook profits, while
certainly helpful, cannot in themselves support
the Board's operations.
Another reason is that, as just about
anyone connected with publishing can tell
you, printing and production costs have
skyrocketed in the last two years (the cost of
paper alone is up 44 percent in two years,

Rich Joroslovsky
and no end is in sight). The prospect is thus
for an almost unprecedented demand for
help from the Pub Board — more
publications will be seeking money, and
they'll be seeking more of it.
Storke Space Shortage
Still another reason for the current
assessment is the space shortage in Storke.
With the proliferation of new journals, and
the expansion of existing ones, we have
almost reached the building's limits. The only
currently underutilized space is a virtually
unfurnished second-floor workroom. The
odds are that we will have to furnish the
room with enough equipment to make it
usable for currently crowded publications.
And that will cost more money.
We should also point out where this
money is not going: to the Daily and Quad,
the two biggest campus publications. These
organizations are large enough to seek their
own individual sources of revenue, whether
through advertising, direct sales or a separate
assessment. The Pub Board, rather, is more
concerned with the needs of the somewhat
smaller organizations that can't stand alone.
It is for these publications that we now seek
this aid from the student body.

money is not going: to the Daily and Quad,
the two biggest campus publications. These
organizations are large enough to seek their
own individual sources of revenue, whether
through advertising, direct sales or a separate
assessment. The Pub Board, rather, is more
concerned with the needs of the somewhat
smaller organizations that can't stand alone.
It is for these publications that we now seek
this aid from the student body.
(Rich Jaroslovsky is chairman of the ASSU
Publications Board.)
For the first time in three years, the ASSU
Publications Board is seeking a student fee
assessment. The Board's request — for a $1
refundable levy for fall and winter quarters —
will be on the forthcoming ASSU ballot, and
we'd like to commend it.
The Pub Board, which was created by the
ASSU constitution, is composed of some 12
campus publications, including the Quad,
Live Oak, Daily and Chaparral, as well as
Sequoia, Real News and Chicanismo.
However, the Board's concerns extend well
beyond merely its member publications;
rather, it's concerned with the viability and
needs of all publications here.
The Board's major responsibilities are the
allocation of space and money — two items
that are valuable commodities to any
publication. The Board controls space
allocation in the Storke Student Publications
Building, and has often, owing to a chronic
space shortage in Storke, been involved in
trying to locate working space for
publications in other locations as well.
In addition, the Board has given financial
aid — in the form of grants and/or interest
free loans — to a large number of
publications. In the current year alone, we've
helped fund no fewer than nine publications,
including the Chaparral, Live Oak, the

Stanford Review, the Gay People's Union
newspaper, the Catalyst and Min. Some of
these might never have appeared without the
Board's help.
Source Of Funds
The money to aid these organizations
comes from two sources. One is the Pub
Board's own money-making projects, the
Blotter and Moneybook. These are
contracted to an individual who does the
work and shares profits with the Board, and
have accounted for several thousand dollars
over the past three years.
The other source has been through
periodic fee assessments. As noted, the Board
sought its last assessment three full years ago
— or, to put it another way, the Board has
carefully managed its money and made that
1972 assessment last.
We're returning for another assessment
now for a number of reasons. One is that the
1972 assessment money is almost gone, and
that Blotter-Moneybook profits, while
certainly helpful, cannot in themselves support
the Board's operations.
Another reason is that, as just about
anyone connected with publishing can tell
you, printing and production costs have
skyrocketed in the last two years (the cost of
paper alone is up 44 percent in two years,

Rich Joroslovsky
and no end is in sight). The prospect is thus
for an almost unprecedented demand for
help from the Pub Board — more
publications will be seeking money, and
they'll be seeking more of it.
Storke Space Shortage
Still another reason for the current
assessment is the space shortage in Storke.
With the proliferation of new journals, and
the expansion of existing ones, we have
almost reached the building's limits. The only
currently underutilized space is a virtually
unfurnished second-floor workroom. The
odds are that we will have to furnish the
room with enough equipment to make it
usable for currently crowded publications.
And that will cost more money.
We should also point out where this
money is not going: to the Daily and Quad,
the two biggest campus publications. These
organizations are large enough to seek their
own individual sources of revenue, whether
through advertising, direct sales or a separate
assessment. The Pub Board, rather, is more
