Bad Parliamentary Manners
Editor:
I have some doubts about
Kevin McDermott's qualifications
as a candidate for ASSU Council
of Presidents. They arise from his
use of parliamentary- procedure in
a recent meeting of the ASSU
Senate.
My wife, Meredith Smith,
works as a program coordinator in
Escondido Village, scheduling
classes and other activities for
students and their families.
Although her position is funded
by the YWCA, she has to seek
money for program costs from
other sources â€” such as the ASSU
Senate, of which McDermott is a
member.
She recently asked the Senate
to renew a small grant which
enables her to distribute a
monthly newsletter. ASSU Sen.
Mike Lindsey asked her to attend
the Monday night ASSU meeting.
She waited from 7 to 10:30 p.m.
for the request to come up. But,
when she was finally given the
floor to speak, McDermott was
suddenly so taken with the need
to end the meeting that he
interrupted her a number of times
and then moved for adjournment,
cutting off all discussion.
McDermott seemed to regard
the few minutes of his time which
would have been needed to
gracefully resolve the matter,
more important than her
investment of three hours. So,
Meredith waited all evening to
learn that she was not entitled to
the courtesy of being heard.
Manners may not count for
everything in a candidate for the
Council of Presidents, but they
should count for something.

Viets Fear Reds
Editor:
Regarding Vietnam, I am taken
aback by all the reports about
hundreds of thousands of refugees
fleeing from the North
Vietnamese army, about
despondency and panic, about
rescue parties and airlifted babies.
Surely, the supporters of the
Thieu regime form but an
insignificant minority.
Surely, the South Vietnamese
masses should have welcomed
their liberators with flags, flowers
and kisses, just as American and
British troops were widely
welcomed in Western Europe after
the Normandy invasion.
Or were the concerned scholars
and the progressive parsons
mistaken after all? Perhaps the
common people do dread the rule
of party functionaries and
left-wing ideologues. They have all
reason to do so.

Concert Not Overpriced
Editor:
Recent statements by the
McDermott slate stating that last
summer's Loggins and Messina
concert could have been priced at
$3 per ticket instead of the
discounted $4.50 Stanford
student price is an unfounded
allegation.
Had tickets been so priced, this
concert alone would have lost
$2832.40 at a sellout. The
irresponsible attitude of the
McDermott slate based on
insufficient research is typical of
the thinking used by previous
special events directors resulting
in annual deficits as high as
$30,000.
If any slate, including
McDermott's, wishes to learn more
about the financial operations of
Special Events and the economics
of ticket pricing, its members are
invited to come to my office.
