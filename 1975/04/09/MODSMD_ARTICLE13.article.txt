## Investigative Reporter Who Toppled Gurney Journalism Fellow Savage Enjoys Year Of 'Reflection' Here 
### PATRICK McCARTHY 
On the morning of November
25, five days after he and his
newspaper had won the
Associated Press (AP) Managing
Editors Public Service Award, Jim
Savage listened intently, like any
undergraduate, to Assoc. English
Prof. William Chace in his
"American Condition in the 20th
Century" course.
Hunched up in his seat in the
back row, Savage scribbled the
meanings of "eschatology" and
"apocalypse" into his notebook as
he heard them relate to a novel
about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
"This is all so enlightening," he
would say later, dressed in
dungarees and sneakers, sitting in
the Coffee House at Tresidder,
"and the program in the
humanities I am pursuing is,
frankly, mind-expanding."
Rare Specimen
Savage slouched in the
student-filled auditorium 3000
miles from his Ft. Lauderdale
home and far from his prestigious
job as the investigative reporter
for the Miami Herald.
Savage, his wife Sherry and
their three-year-old son Sean came
here so Savage could take
advantage of an opportunity to
"stop, back off . . . and recharge
the batteries" dulled by a hectic,
time-consuming job at the
Herald.
Now Savage is one of those
rare specimens found around here
known as a Professional

Journalism Fellow (PJF).
"That means," explains Harry
Press, managing director of the
PJF program, "that Jim Savage is
a seasoned professional who is
devoted to the profession. [The
Fellows are] chosen partly
because of [their] present
performance and partly because
of [their] potential performance
as a newsman."
Out of 90 applicants, Savage
and 12 others were, as the
Fellowship program pamphlet
puts it, provided with the
"opportunity for a perspective
that is bound neither by deadlines
nor the demand for immediate
relevance." In other words, the
fellows study anything they want
and enjoy for one year the life of
a student — while being paid at
almost full salary, compliments of
the National Endowment for the
Humanities.
Sen. Gurney
Savage was given the
"opportunity" principally because
of his investigative reporting for
the Herald over the past few
years (he has been on the staff,
off and on, since 1963). His
biggest story, and the one for
which he, his partner, Mike
Baxter, and the Herald won the
recent APME award, was on
investigation of former Florida
Sen. Edward Gurney.
The Gurney investigation
began in 1971, when Baxter and
Savage learned that William Pelski,
the head of the Miami Federal

Housing Administration (FHA)
office, got a very favorable deal
on his home from a contractor.
Because "it looked unethical on
the face of it," Savage and Baxter
investigated and published their
damaging findings.
Later another Florida
contractor who had been
impressed by the piece, contacted
Savage and told him he had been
the "target" of an attempted
shakedown by a shadowy member
of Gurney's staff, Larry Williams.
Williams, the contractor said, had
promised him that if he
contributed $5000 to Gurney's
"office expenses" the contractor
would receive favored treatment'
from the FHA.
Platitudinous Statements
"It took us awhile to get a
clear picture," Savage explained,
"but we did verify it. We decided
that we could not publish until
Emmer, the contractor, would go
on the record."
"For nine months," said
Savage, "Mike, our editors, and I
played on this guy's conscience to
let us tell the story naming him.
He resisted — but one day I called
him, by luck, and he had just
finished watching Gurney on
television.
"I guess the senator had been
giving self-serving, platitudinous
statements, as he did throughout
the whole Watergate thing.
Emmer was upset, so he said,
'What the hell, publish!' "
The Herald's expose prompted

Savage, his feet plopped
on an empty desk in his cramped
office in Cypress Hall shared with
two other Fellows, said, "Jesus, it
was tough work.
"You're dealing with people
who can communicate in a very
limited way. If you ask them the
wrong question, as Bernstein and
Woodward did with Hugh Sloan
once, they might unintentionally
give you the wrong answer and
lead you astray. It was tortured
communication where we came
up with little nuggets of
information and had to go it alone
from there."
Ordeal
Savage had been well trained
for the ordeal. Born in
Massachusetts, he attended the
Boston University School of
Public Communication and
learned the ropes of reporting at
the Quincy Patriot Ledger in
Massachusetts. In 1963, he
answered an ad in Editor and

a federal investigation which Publisher and began his career at
resulted in the convictions of the Herald.
Williams and Pelski and the After two years of general
indictment of Gurney (who is assignment work, he was teamed
now on trial). with Hank Messick, the famous

investigative reporter and
biographer of Meyer Lansky.
But lured by a doubled salary,
Savage returned to Boston in
1966 as part of the now-defunct
Boston Herald Traveler's new
investigative team. It included
John Salin, Nicholas Gage ("We
were born on the same day, and I
knew him from my days as the
BU News city editor when 1
advertised for a drama critic and
he answered it"), now of the New
York Times, and Messick. It
looked like a golden opportunity
for Savage, but six months after
they started he, and the whole
team, resigned.
Cold Feet
"Every time we got into a
touchy area," he reminisced
matter of factly, the Traveler
got cold feet. It occurred to me
after six months that we were a
showcase to show what great
journalists the publisher and the
editor were.

"The last straw came when we
started investigating a man
named Joe Linsey with known
contacts in the underworld. He was
a friend of the publisher's so they

and Baxter dug and wrote. "We
stopped the day of the
indictment. We didn't want to
continue digging up material — if
there was any left — on this man

told us to stop and fired Hank.
The rest of us quit."
The team's plight got a lot of
publicity in the news world (Drew
Pearson and Jack Anderson
devoted two columns to it), and
Savage was offered his old job
back in Miami.
In the next few years he turned
out prize-winning stories on
crooked judges, the Cedars of
Lebanon hospital scandal and the
Mafia.
"But it is politics," he says,
"where the real action is. You can
chronicle the activities of
mobsters and tell what they've
been up to lately but, eventually,
it just sits there. Politicians deny
things, issue hurried explanations
and even call you names. [Gurney
called Savage and his partner
'ferrets' and 'hatchetmen'. ]
Gangsters just don't do anything."
So it was with enthusiasm that
he threw himself into the Gurney
investigation. For two years he

who had been indicted and was
facing trial."
Soon after the end of the
series, Savage came here.
Learning Experience
Savage will return to the
Herald in June. But until then, he
will complete his year of
"reflection" here. The fellowship
has not been a "vacation," he
asserts. "It's been a learning
experience with a different
emphasis than the normal student
has."
He ponders. "I guess I look
forward to going back to the
Herald." But his wife Sherry,
expresses both her and her
husband's feelings best.
"I hate for the program to
end," she says. "It's the kind of
thing everyone should be able to
do at least once every five years.
It's mind-broadening
relaxing .. . it's an easy life style
to adjust to and this is an easy
area to live in."

has not been a "vacation," he
asserts. "It's been a learning
experience with a different
emphasis than the normal student
has."
He ponders. "I guess I look
forward to going back to the
Herald." But his wife Sherry,
expresses both her and her
husband's feelings best.
"I hate for the program to
end," she says. "It's the kind of
thing everyone should be able to
do at least once every five years.
It's mind-broadening
relaxing .. . it's an easy life style
to adjust to and this is an easy
area to live in."
On the morning of November
25, five days after he and his
newspaper had won the
Associated Press (AP) Managing
Editors Public Service Award, Jim
Savage listened intently, like any
undergraduate, to Assoc. English
Prof. William Chace in his
"American Condition in the 20th
Century" course.
Hunched up in his seat in the
back row, Savage scribbled the
meanings of "eschatology" and
"apocalypse" into his notebook as
he heard them relate to a novel
about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
"This is all so enlightening," he
would say later, dressed in
dungarees and sneakers, sitting in
the Coffee House at Tresidder,
"and the program in the
humanities I am pursuing is,
frankly, mind-expanding."
Rare Specimen
Savage slouched in the
student-filled auditorium 3000
miles from his Ft. Lauderdale
home and far from his prestigious
job as the investigative reporter
for the Miami Herald.
Savage, his wife Sherry and
their three-year-old son Sean came
here so Savage could take
advantage of an opportunity to
"stop, back off . . . and recharge
the batteries" dulled by a hectic,
time-consuming job at the
Herald.
Now Savage is one of those
rare specimens found around here
known as a Professional

Journalism Fellow (PJF).
"That means," explains Harry
Press, managing director of the
PJF program, "that Jim Savage is
a seasoned professional who is
devoted to the profession. [The
Fellows are] chosen partly
because of [their] present
performance and partly because
of [their] potential performance
as a newsman."
Out of 90 applicants, Savage
and 12 others were, as the
Fellowship program pamphlet
puts it, provided with the
"opportunity for a perspective
that is bound neither by deadlines
nor the demand for immediate
relevance." In other words, the
fellows study anything they want
and enjoy for one year the life of
a student — while being paid at
almost full salary, compliments of
the National Endowment for the
Humanities.
Sen. Gurney
Savage was given the
"opportunity" principally because
of his investigative reporting for
the Herald over the past few
years (he has been on the staff,
off and on, since 1963). His
biggest story, and the one for
which he, his partner, Mike
Baxter, and the Herald won the
recent APME award, was on
investigation of former Florida
Sen. Edward Gurney.
The Gurney investigation
began in 1971, when Baxter and
Savage learned that William Pelski,
the head of the Miami Federal

Housing Administration (FHA)
office, got a very favorable deal
on his home from a contractor.
Because "it looked unethical on
the face of it," Savage and Baxter
investigated and published their
damaging findings.
Later another Florida
contractor who had been
impressed by the piece, contacted
Savage and told him he had been
the "target" of an attempted
shakedown by a shadowy member
of Gurney's staff, Larry Williams.
Williams, the contractor said, had
promised him that if he
contributed $5000 to Gurney's
"office expenses" the contractor
would receive favored treatment'
from the FHA.
Platitudinous Statements
"It took us awhile to get a
clear picture," Savage explained,
"but we did verify it. We decided
that we could not publish until
Emmer, the contractor, would go
on the record."
"For nine months," said
Savage, "Mike, our editors, and I
played on this guy's conscience to
let us tell the story naming him.
He resisted — but one day I called
him, by luck, and he had just
finished watching Gurney on
television.
"I guess the senator had been
giving self-serving, platitudinous
statements, as he did throughout
the whole Watergate thing.
Emmer was upset, so he said,
'What the hell, publish!' "
The Herald's expose prompted

Savage, his feet plopped
on an empty desk in his cramped
office in Cypress Hall shared with
two other Fellows, said, "Jesus, it
was tough work.
"You're dealing with people
who can communicate in a very
limited way. If you ask them the
wrong question, as Bernstein and
Woodward did with Hugh Sloan
once, they might unintentionally
give you the wrong answer and
lead you astray. It was tortured
communication where we came
up with little nuggets of
information and had to go it alone
from there."
Ordeal
Savage had been well trained
for the ordeal. Born in
Massachusetts, he attended the
Boston University School of
Public Communication and
learned the ropes of reporting at
the Quincy Patriot Ledger in
Massachusetts. In 1963, he
answered an ad in Editor and

a federal investigation which Publisher and began his career at
resulted in the convictions of the Herald.
Williams and Pelski and the After two years of general
indictment of Gurney (who is assignment work, he was teamed
now on trial). with Hank Messick, the famous

investigative reporter and
biographer of Meyer Lansky.
But lured by a doubled salary,
Savage returned to Boston in
1966 as part of the now-defunct
Boston Herald Traveler's new
investigative team. It included
John Salin, Nicholas Gage ("We
were born on the same day, and I
knew him from my days as the
BU News city editor when 1
advertised for a drama critic and
he answered it"), now of the New
York Times, and Messick. It
looked like a golden opportunity
for Savage, but six months after
they started he, and the whole
team, resigned.
Cold Feet
"Every time we got into a
touchy area," he reminisced
matter of factly, the Traveler
got cold feet. It occurred to me
after six months that we were a
showcase to show what great
journalists the publisher and the
editor were.

"The last straw came when we
started investigating a man
named Joe Linsey with known
contacts in the underworld. He was
a friend of the publisher's so they

and Baxter dug and wrote. "We
stopped the day of the
indictment. We didn't want to
continue digging up material — if
there was any left — on this man

told us to stop and fired Hank.
The rest of us quit."
The team's plight got a lot of
publicity in the news world (Drew
Pearson and Jack Anderson
devoted two columns to it), and
Savage was offered his old job
back in Miami.
In the next few years he turned
out prize-winning stories on
crooked judges, the Cedars of
Lebanon hospital scandal and the
Mafia.
"But it is politics," he says,
"where the real action is. You can
chronicle the activities of
mobsters and tell what they've
been up to lately but, eventually,
it just sits there. Politicians deny
things, issue hurried explanations
and even call you names. [Gurney
called Savage and his partner
'ferrets' and 'hatchetmen'. ]
Gangsters just don't do anything."
So it was with enthusiasm that
he threw himself into the Gurney
investigation. For two years he

who had been indicted and was
facing trial."
Soon after the end of the
series, Savage came here.
Learning Experience
Savage will return to the
Herald in June. But until then, he
will complete his year of
"reflection" here. The fellowship
has not been a "vacation," he
asserts. "It's been a learning
experience with a different
emphasis than the normal student
has."
He ponders. "I guess I look

it just sits there. Politicians deny
things, issue hurried explanations
and even call you names. [Gurney
called Savage and his partner
'ferrets' and 'hatchetmen'. ]
Gangsters just don't do anything."
So it was with enthusiasm that
he threw himself into the Gurney
investigation. For two years he

who had been indicted and was
facing trial."
Soon after the end of the
series, Savage came here.
Learning Experience
Savage will return to the
Herald in June. But until then, he
will complete his year of
"reflection" here. The fellowship
has not been a "vacation," he
asserts. "It's been a learning
experience with a different
emphasis than the normal student
has."
He ponders. "I guess I look
forward to going back to the
Herald." But his wife Sherry,
expresses both her and her
husband's feelings best.
"I hate for the program to
end," she says. "It's the kind of
thing everyone should be able to
do at least once every five years.
It's mind-broadening
relaxing .. . it's an easy life style
to adjust to and this is an easy
area to live in."
On the morning of November
25, five days after he and his
newspaper had won the
Associated Press (AP) Managing
Editors Public Service Award, Jim
Savage listened intently, like any
undergraduate, to Assoc. English
Prof. William Chace in his
"American Condition in the 20th
Century" course.
Hunched up in his seat in the
back row, Savage scribbled the
meanings of "eschatology" and
"apocalypse" into his notebook as
he heard them relate to a novel
about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
"This is all so enlightening," he
would say later, dressed in
dungarees and sneakers, sitting in
the Coffee House at Tresidder,
"and the program in the
humanities I am pursuing is,
frankly, mind-expanding."
Rare Specimen
Savage slouched in the
student-filled auditorium 3000
miles from his Ft. Lauderdale
home and far from his prestigious
job as the investigative reporter
for the Miami Herald.
Savage, his wife Sherry and
their three-year-old son Sean came
here so Savage could take
advantage of an opportunity to
"stop, back off . . . and recharge
the batteries" dulled by a hectic,
time-consuming job at the
Herald.
Now Savage is one of those
rare specimens found around here
known as a Professional

Journalism Fellow (PJF).
"That means," explains Harry
Press, managing director of the
PJF program, "that Jim Savage is
a seasoned professional who is
devoted to the profession. [The
Fellows are] chosen partly
because of [their] present
performance and partly because
of [their] potential performance
as a newsman."
Out of 90 applicants, Savage
and 12 others were, as the
Fellowship program pamphlet
puts it, provided with the
"opportunity for a perspective
that is bound neither by deadlines
nor the demand for immediate
relevance." In other words, the
fellows study anything they want
and enjoy for one year the life of
a student — while being paid at
almost full salary, compliments of
the National Endowment for the
Humanities.
Sen. Gurney
Savage was given the
"opportunity" principally because
of his investigative reporting for
the Herald over the past few
years (he has been on the staff,
off and on, since 1963). His
biggest story, and the one for
which he, his partner, Mike
Baxter, and the Herald won the
recent APME award, was on
investigation of former Florida
Sen. Edward Gurney.
The Gurney investigation
began in 1971, when Baxter and
Savage learned that William Pelski,
the head of the Miami Federal

Housing Administration (FHA)
office, got a very favorable deal
on his home from a contractor.
Because "it looked unethical on
the face of it," Savage and Baxter
investigated and published their
damaging findings.
Later another Florida
contractor who had been
impressed by the piece, contacted
Savage and told him he had been
the "target" of an attempted
shakedown by a shadowy member
of Gurney's staff, Larry Williams.
Williams, the contractor said, had
promised him that if he
contributed $5000 to Gurney's
"office expenses" the contractor
would receive favored treatment'
from the FHA.
Platitudinous Statements
"It took us awhile to get a
clear picture," Savage explained,
"but we did verify it. We decided
that we could not publish until
Emmer, the contractor, would go
on the record."
"For nine months," said
Savage, "Mike, our editors, and I
played on this guy's conscience to
let us tell the story naming him.
He resisted — but one day I called
him, by luck, and he had just
finished watching Gurney on
television.
"I guess the senator had been
giving self-serving, platitudinous
statements, as he did throughout
the whole Watergate thing.
Emmer was upset, so he said,
'What the hell, publish!' "
The Herald's expose prompted

Savage, his feet plopped
on an empty desk in his cramped
office in Cypress Hall shared with
two other Fellows, said, "Jesus, it
was tough work.
"You're dealing with people
who can communicate in a very
limited way. If you ask them the
wrong question, as Bernstein and
Woodward did with Hugh Sloan
once, they might unintentionally
give you the wrong answer and
lead you astray. It was tortured
communication where we came
up with little nuggets of
information and had to go it alone
from there."
Ordeal
Savage had been well trained
for the ordeal. Born in
Massachusetts, he attended the
Boston University School of
Public Communication and
learned the ropes of reporting at
the Quincy Patriot Ledger in
Massachusetts. In 1963, he
answered an ad in Editor and

a federal investigation which Publisher and began his career at
resulted in the convictions of the Herald.
Williams and Pelski and the After two years of general
indictment of Gurney (who is assignment work, he was teamed
now on trial). with Hank Messick, the famous

investigative reporter and
biographer of Meyer Lansky.
But lured by a doubled salary,
Savage returned to Boston in
1966 as part of the now-defunct
Boston Herald Traveler's new
investigative team. It included
John Salin, Nicholas Gage ("We
were born on the same day, and I
knew him from my days as the
BU News city editor when 1
advertised for a drama critic and
he answered it"), now of the New
York Times, and Messick. It
looked like a golden opportunity
for Savage, but six months after
they started he, and the whole
team, resigned.
Cold Feet
"Every time we got into a
touchy area," he reminisced
matter of factly, the Traveler
got cold feet. It occurred to me
after six months that we were a
showcase to show what great
journalists the publisher and the
editor were.

"The last straw came when we
started investigating a man
named Joe Linsey with known
contacts in the underworld. He was
a friend of the publisher's so they

and Baxter dug and wrote. "We
stopped the day of the
indictment. We didn't want to
continue digging up material — if
there was any left — on this man

told us to stop and fired Hank.
The rest of us quit."
The team's plight got a lot of
publicity in the news world (Drew
Pearson and Jack Anderson
devoted two columns to it), and
Savage was offered his old job
back in Miami.
In the next few years he turned
out prize-winning stories on
crooked judges, the Cedars of
Lebanon hospital scandal and the
Mafia.
"But it is politics," he says,
"where the real action is. You can
chronicle the activities of
mobsters and tell what they've
been up to lately but, eventually,
it just sits there. Politicians deny
things, issue hurried explanations
and even call you names. [Gurney
called Savage and his partner

told us to stop and fired Hank.
The rest of us quit."
The team's plight got a lot of
publicity in the news world (Drew
Pearson and Jack Anderson
devoted two columns to it), and
Savage was offered his old job
back in Miami.
In the next few years he turned
out prize-winning stories on
crooked judges, the Cedars of
Lebanon hospital scandal and the
Mafia.
"But it is politics," he says,
"where the real action is. You can
chronicle the activities of
mobsters and tell what they've
been up to lately but, eventually,
it just sits there. Politicians deny
things, issue hurried explanations
and even call you names. [Gurney
called Savage and his partner
'ferrets' and 'hatchetmen'. ]
Gangsters just don't do anything."
So it was with enthusiasm that
he threw himself into the Gurney
investigation. For two years he

who had been indicted and was
facing trial."
Soon after the end of the
series, Savage came here.
Learning Experience
Savage will return to the
Herald in June. But until then, he
will complete his year of
"reflection" here. The fellowship
has not been a "vacation," he
asserts. "It's been a learning
experience with a different
emphasis than the normal student
has."
He ponders. "I guess I look
forward to going back to the
Herald." But his wife Sherry,
expresses both her and her
husband's feelings best.
"I hate for the program to
end," she says. "It's the kind of
thing everyone should be able to
do at least once every five years.
It's mind-broadening
relaxing .. . it's an easy life style
to adjust to and this is an easy
area to live in."
On the morning of November
25, five days after he and his
newspaper had won the
Associated Press (AP) Managing
Editors Public Service Award, Jim
Savage listened intently, like any
undergraduate, to Assoc. English
Prof. William Chace in his
"American Condition in the 20th
Century" course.
Hunched up in his seat in the
back row, Savage scribbled the
meanings of "eschatology" and
"apocalypse" into his notebook as
he heard them relate to a novel
about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
"This is all so enlightening," he
would say later, dressed in
dungarees and sneakers, sitting in
the Coffee House at Tresidder,
"and the program in the
humanities I am pursuing is,
frankly, mind-expanding."
Rare Specimen
Savage slouched in the
student-filled auditorium 3000
miles from his Ft. Lauderdale
home and far from his prestigious
job as the investigative reporter
for the Miami Herald.
Savage, his wife Sherry and
their three-year-old son Sean came
here so Savage could take
advantage of an opportunity to
"stop, back off . . . and recharge
the batteries" dulled by a hectic,
time-consuming job at the
Herald.
Now Savage is one of those
rare specimens found around here
known as a Professional

Journalism Fellow (PJF).
"That means," explains Harry
Press, managing director of the
PJF program, "that Jim Savage is
a seasoned professional who is
devoted to the profession. [The
Fellows are] chosen partly
because of [their] present
performance and partly because
of [their] potential performance
as a newsman."
Out of 90 applicants, Savage
and 12 others were, as the
Fellowship program pamphlet
puts it, provided with the
"opportunity for a perspective
that is bound neither by deadlines
nor the demand for immediate
relevance." In other words, the
fellows study anything they want
and enjoy for one year the life of
a student — while being paid at
almost full salary, compliments of
the National Endowment for the
Humanities.
Sen. Gurney
Savage was given the
"opportunity" principally because
of his investigative reporting for
the Herald over the past few
years (he has been on the staff,
off and on, since 1963). His
biggest story, and the one for
which he, his partner, Mike
Baxter, and the Herald won the
recent APME award, was on
investigation of former Florida
Sen. Edward Gurney.
The Gurney investigation
began in 1971, when Baxter and
Savage learned that William Pelski,
the head of the Miami Federal

Housing Administration (FHA)
office, got a very favorable deal
on his home from a contractor.
Because "it looked unethical on
the face of it," Savage and Baxter
investigated and published their
damaging findings.
Later another Florida
contractor who had been
impressed by the piece, contacted
Savage and told him he had been
the "target" of an attempted
shakedown by a shadowy member
of Gurney's staff, Larry Williams.
Williams, the contractor said, had
promised him that if he
contributed $5000 to Gurney's
"office expenses" the contractor
would receive favored treatment'
from the FHA.
Platitudinous Statements
"It took us awhile to get a
clear picture," Savage explained,
"but we did verify it. We decided
that we could not publish until
Emmer, the contractor, would go
on the record."
"For nine months," said
Savage, "Mike, our editors, and I
played on this guy's conscience to
let us tell the story naming him.
He resisted — but one day I called
him, by luck, and he had just
finished watching Gurney on
television.
"I guess the senator had been
giving self-serving, platitudinous
statements, as he did throughout
the whole Watergate thing.
Emmer was upset, so he said,
'What the hell, publish!' "
The Herald's expose prompted

Savage, his feet plopped
on an empty desk in his cramped
office in Cypress Hall shared with
two other Fellows, said, "Jesus, it
was tough work.
"You're dealing with people
who can communicate in a very
limited way. If you ask them the
wrong question, as Bernstein and
Woodward did with Hugh Sloan
once, they might unintentionally
give you the wrong answer and
lead you astray. It was tortured
communication where we came
up with little nuggets of
information and had to go it alone
from there."
Ordeal
Savage had been well trained
for the ordeal. Born in
Massachusetts, he attended the
Boston University School of
Public Communication and
learned the ropes of reporting at
the Quincy Patriot Ledger in
Massachusetts. In 1963, he
answered an ad in Editor and

a federal investigation which Publisher and began his career at
resulted in the convictions of the Herald.
Williams and Pelski and the After two years of general
indictment of Gurney (who is assignment work, he was teamed
now on trial). with Hank Messick, the famous

investigative reporter and
biographer of Meyer Lansky.
But lured by a doubled salary,
Savage returned to Boston in
1966 as part of the now-defunct
Boston Herald Traveler's new
investigative team. It included
John Salin, Nicholas Gage ("We
were born on the same day, and I
knew him from my days as the
BU News city editor when 1
advertised for a drama critic and
he answered it"), now of the New
York Times, and Messick. It
looked like a golden opportunity
for Savage, but six months after
they started he, and the whole
team, resigned.
Cold Feet
"Every time we got into a
touchy area," he reminisced
matter of factly, the Traveler
got cold feet. It occurred to me
after six months that we were a
showcase to show what great
journalists the publisher and the
editor were.

"The last straw came when we
started investigating a man
named Joe Linsey with known
contacts in the underworld. He was
a friend of the publisher's so they

and Baxter dug and wrote. "We
stopped the day of the
indictment. We didn't want to
continue digging up material — if
there was any left — on this man

told us to stop and fired Hank.
The rest of us quit."
The team's plight got a lot of
publicity in the news world (Drew
Pearson and Jack Anderson
devoted two columns to it), and
