# Author Calls For 'Male Liberation'
## 
### BETTY COHEN 
"The basic problem of
masculinity is that we men never
thought we had problems,"
explained Warren Farrell, author
of a recent book on male
liberation. The "difficulty for
men to look at themselves is
reinforced by the way we look at
women's liberation, seeing it only
as an issue for women."
Speaking to a packed Bishop
Auditorium Monday night in
conjunction with this week's
International Women's Year
celebration, Farrell said that men
focus too much on society's
negative images of women. He
claimed this prevents them from
examining the positive feminine
elements in the male personality.
As a result, he said, women's
liberation has been viewed as a
chance for women to "come up"
to men, rather than as a way for
men to work toward a more
humanized role for themselves.
Farrell, author of The
Liberated Man — Beyond
Masculinity: Freeing Men and
Their Relationships With Women,
said that just as women protest
being sex objects, men should
validly protest being "success
objects." Men are said to be
oppressors, because they have a
monopoly of power, he noted.
But men are also oppressed by the
need to have and strive for power
and success, he said.
Although it is acceptable for

women to note on their resumes
that they were doctors, men
cannot write that "from
1973-1975 they took care of their
children," said Farrell, the only
male elected three times to the
board of directors of the National
Organization of Women (NOW).
'Humanize Male Role
Farrell lamented that women's
recent victories in gaining power
and adopting male values have
been publicized, but little has
been said about the need "to
humanizt" the male role by
asserting such positive feminine
values as flexibility, sensitivity
and ability to admit mistakes.
As an illustration, Farrell said
that when Senator Edmund
Muskie cried in public during his
presidential campaign, the public
questioned whether any man who
cried would make a competent
president.
Yet, when former Vice
President Spiro Agnew stubbornly
called tax evasion accusations "a
damn lie," a New York Times
article lauded him for at least
displaying strength and
forthrightness, Farrell added.
Farrell also commented on the
male desire "to pile up concrete
rewards and external
achievements for their resumes"
rather than pursue internal or
personal gratification. This is part
of a male's perceived need to be
an expert in a specialized area, so

that he can appear to have all the
answers.
Farrell also discussed personal
insights he gained from his men's
consciousness-raising groups. He
has started over 100 such groups
— some all male, some with men
and women.
He said that the topic most
difficult for his group to discuss
was homemaking. At first, he
thought he knew everything about
it, Farrell admitted. But with
more cooking and housework

experience, he said he learned that
there is a difference between
simply helping cook one meal
each week and really sharing the
responsibility of planning meals
and doing grocery shopping.
Farrell, whose Ph.D.
dissertation at New York
University in 1974 was a series of
original experiments on men's
attitudes toward masculinity and
women's liberation, maintained
that men have much to gain from
role equalization.

values as flexibility, sensitivity
and ability to admit mistakes.
As an illustration, Farrell said
that when Senator Edmund
Muskie cried in public during his
presidential campaign, the public
questioned whether any man who
cried would make a competent
president.
Yet, when former Vice
President Spiro Agnew stubbornly
called tax evasion accusations "a
damn lie," a New York Times
article lauded him for at least
displaying strength and
forthrightness, Farrell added.
Farrell also commented on the
male desire "to pile up concrete
rewards and external
achievements for their resumes"
rather than pursue internal or
personal gratification. This is part
of a male's perceived need to be
an expert in a specialized area, so

that he can appear to have all the
answers.
Farrell also discussed personal
insights he gained from his men's
consciousness-raising groups. He
has started over 100 such groups
— some all male, some with men
and women.
He said that the topic most
difficult for his group to discuss
was homemaking. At first, he
thought he knew everything about
it, Farrell admitted. But with
more cooking and housework

experience, he said he learned that
there is a difference between
simply helping cook one meal
each week and really sharing the
responsibility of planning meals
and doing grocery shopping.
Farrell, whose Ph.D.
dissertation at New York
University in 1974 was a series of
original experiments on men's
attitudes toward masculinity and
women's liberation, maintained
that men have much to gain from
role equalization.

MALE LIBERATION — Warren Farrell, author of a recent book on
male liberation, said the problem is that men don't think they have
problems. However, by looking at women's liberation as only an issue
for women, men in fact reinforce old standards, he said, adding that
men should view women's liberation as a way for men to work toward
a more humanized role for themselves.
"The basic problem of
masculinity is that we men never
thought we had problems,"
explained Warren Farrell, author
of a recent book on male
liberation. The "difficulty for
men to look at themselves is
reinforced by the way we look at
women's liberation, seeing it only
as an issue for women."
Speaking to a packed Bishop
Auditorium Monday night in
conjunction with this week's
International Women's Year
celebration, Farrell said that men
focus too much on society's
negative images of women. He
claimed this prevents them from
examining the positive feminine
elements in the male personality.
As a result, he said, women's
liberation has been viewed as a
chance for women to "come up"
to men, rather than as a way for
men to work toward a more
humanized role for themselves.
Farrell, author of The
Liberated Man — Beyond
Masculinity: Freeing Men and
Their Relationships With Women,
said that just as women protest
being sex objects, men should
validly protest being "success
objects." Men are said to be
oppressors, because they have a
monopoly of power, he noted.
But men are also oppressed by the
need to have and strive for power
and success, he said.
Although it is acceptable for

women to note on their resumes
that they were doctors, men
cannot write that "from
1973-1975 they took care of their
children," said Farrell, the only
male elected three times to the
board of directors of the National
Organization of Women (NOW).
'Humanize Male Role
Farrell lamented that women's
recent victories in gaining power
and adopting male values have
been publicized, but little has
been said about the need "to
humanizt" the male role by
asserting such positive feminine
values as flexibility, sensitivity
and ability to admit mistakes.
As an illustration, Farrell said
that when Senator Edmund
Muskie cried in public during his
presidential campaign, the public
questioned whether any man who
