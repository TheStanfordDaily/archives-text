Stanford did everything it could to defeat the Soviet Union's Moscow State University last
Saturday in an international waterpolo match. The Dollies were trotted out to — well — take the
Russian's minds off the game. It rained. The poor devils were even subjected to the Farm's unique
version of collectivism - the food service.
It didn't matter, Moscow State still won 14-9. What Stanford did might have destroyed a lesser
detente. But it wasn't able to mask the fact that international matches (particularly with the Soviet
Union) are still among the most entertaining and well played athletic spectacles offered today.
It goes without saying that Moscow State is one of the best waterpolo teams (if not the best) on
the face of the earth. Seven of the Russian "collegiates" brought gold medals home from Munich in
1972. They're not really collegiates, though. Anybody can compete for Soviet universities. The
average age on the Russian squad is 28.
And the crowd saw them perform their aquatic magic. They were not in top shape — jet lag and
an unaccustomed outdoor pool scaled that. But they put on a good show none the less. Just ask head
coach Art Lambert, who saw his young team (average age 19'/i) come out strong but succumb in the
fatal second period to a six-goal Soviet attack.
The Stanford waterpolo |eam will be making a return trip to the Soviet Union sometime next
year. One camp is pulling for a late fall trip while others would like to go in the springtime.
But the Soviets proved what the Stanford Band, who may be the eminent political philosophers
of our time, had said all along. "Russians, you may be better swimmers, but we've got your
submarine."
