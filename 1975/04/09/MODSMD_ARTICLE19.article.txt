# UCLA Down 3-1... But Catching Up
## Cards Lead Rain-Shortened Net Match 
### RON BECK 
For some reason, Stanford's tennis team
always has a tough time when it plays UCLA
in Los Angeles. This time was no exception.
The Cards' hopes for victory last weekend
against the Bruins were washed away by a
series of rainstorms. The match — originally
scheduled for Saturday, but switched to
Monday — was postponed until April 24 after
the weather made it impossible to continue.
Monday's make-up match started before
the downpour, and before the match was
stopped Stanford had a 3-1 lead. But that
score is deceiving because in two matches
that were started but not completed, UCLA
netters' had firm control.
At first singles, NCAA champ John
Whitlinger was having a hard time against
top-ranked amateur Billy Martin. Martin was
leading 7-6, 4-2 and appeared to be headed to
victory. In the other incomplete match Ferdi

Taygan, UCLA's third singles player, was
leading Pat DuPre by a 5-2 score in the first
set. At second singles, Nick Saviano was
quickly eliminated by a surprisingly strong
Brian Teacher.
Although the Cards were ineffective in the
top three positions, the bottom of the lineup
was superb. Jim Delaney, Gene Mayer and
Bill Maze all beat their UCLA counterparts in
an exhibition of Stanford's tremendous
depth.
The conclusion of the match has been
tentatively reset for April 24 in Los Angeles
— right before the team starts play in the Ojai
Intercollegiate?. The match will continue
from the exact point where it left off.
The Cards finish off this week with four
straight matches: San Jose St. at San Jose
today; Foothill College on Thursday; Trinity
of Texas on Friday; and Cal at Berkeley on
Saturday.

San Jose St. has scheduled part of the
match at 2:30 this afternoon on the outdoor
courts. First and second singles, and first
doubles will be played inside Spartan Gym
starting at 7:30 tonight.
The featured first singles match puts
Whitlinger against the Spartans' Hank Pfister.
Pfister beat Billy Martin last week in straight
sets, and has lost only one match all year
long. Pfister's sole loss was to Pat DuPre in
the NorCal Intercollegiates.
Thursday's match against Foothill College
will be on the varsity courts at 2:30 p.m.

TRUSTY TROJAN BUSTERS — Nick Saviano, left, and Jim Delaney are both shown playing last Friday against USC. Both players won
decisive singles matches against their Trojan counterparts. Delaney repeated his victory yesterday in the rain-shortened UCLA match, but
Saviano was trounced by Brian Teacher in the match.
