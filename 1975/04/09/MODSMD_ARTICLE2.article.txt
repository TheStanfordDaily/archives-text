"Where else can you go?" asked
ASSU Legal Counseling Office (LCO)
Secretary Nancy Daum after
explaining that pre-paid student legal
services will cease if LCO's request for
a $2 fee assessment is not approved.
LCO is one of nine organizations
requesting a total of $14 in special fee
assessments to be voted on in next
week's elections. The $1 ASSU
Program Fee brings the total requests
to $15.
Daum said the LCO, created by the
ASSU in October 1973, has relied on
fee assessment funding since its
inception, and has not explored other
avenues of possible funding because

students are the only recipients of its
services.
The LCO reports that 486 students
received legal assistance during Fall
and Winter Quarters in such areas as
torts, consumer disputes, criminal
actions and administrative, family and
employment problems. Over 1400
students have visited the office seeking
legal advice during the last year and a
half.
Peter Stone, a second year law
student and member of LCO's policy
board, notes that "most private
attorneys in this area will charge from
$35 to $75 per hour for their time.
The LCO is staffed by four Palo
Alto attorneys, a secretary and seven
law school students, who each

volunteer for severaJ hours a week.
"In today's complex and legalistic
society," warned Stone, "a prudent
student cannot afford this risk."
LCO operating costs total $1500
per month, covering attorney and
secretarial fees and office expenses,
Daum said, adding that the LCO could
continue to operate for no more than
eight to 10 months, including summer
operation, on its approximately
$11,500 in reserve funds.
The Action Research Liason Office
(ARLO) is also requesting a $1 fee
assessment for next year. ARLO was
also created by the ASSU Senate in
October 1973, to coordinate student
research activities with community
research needs.
For example, when the Sierra Club
wanted help in determining the
advantages and disadvantages of mass
transit in the Santa Clara Valley,
ARLO put them in touch with
students who quantitatively studied
the issues.
The largest single allotment in
ARLO's projected $21,640 budget is
$11,934 in salaries and benefits for
co-directors Edith Eddy and bill
Leland.
Initial Funding
Leland said that ARLO's initial
funding from the ASSU Senate,
Council of Presidents, Community
Relations Office, Dean of Students'
Initiative Fund and two private
foundations, "was conceived of as seed
money to get us off the ground.
"None of these can be counted on
as repeatable," said Leland. "We feel
it's appropriate that students show
their support in this way at this time."
Leland explained that "ARLO is
still at the development stage," and
will not be ready to apply for
permanent funding from either the
University or private foundations "for
two to three years."

The fee assessment, "will permit us
to continue through this critical period
of development, and also demonstrate
to other funding agencies that students
are willing to financially support
ARLO," he said.
Leland estimated that 130 students
have been involved in ARLO's 30 to
35 projects, 20 of which have already
been completed, and said that ARLO
funding "should never be carried
entirely by students since there are
other constituencies we serve, such as
the outside community.
"Tight financial times," he
explained, have made it necessary to
apply for this "one-time" assessment.

$35 to $75 per hour for their time.
The LCO is staffed by four Palo

volunteer for severaJ hours a week.
"In today's complex and legalistic

LCO operating costs total $1500
per month, covering attorney and
secretarial fees and office expenses,
Daum said, adding that the LCO could
continue to operate for no more than
eight to 10 months, including summer
operation, on its approximately
$11,500 in reserve funds.
The Action Research Liason Office
(ARLO) is also requesting a $1 fee
assessment for next year. ARLO was
also created by the ASSU Senate in
October 1973, to coordinate student
research activities with community
research needs.
For example, when the Sierra Club
wanted help in determining the
advantages and disadvantages of mass
transit in the Santa Clara Valley,
ARLO put them in touch with
students who quantitatively studied
the issues.
The largest single allotment in
ARLO's projected $21,640 budget is
$11,934 in salaries and benefits for
co-directors Edith Eddy and bill
Leland.
Initial Funding
Leland said that ARLO's initial
funding from the ASSU Senate,
Council of Presidents, Community
Relations Office, Dean of Students'
Initiative Fund and two private
foundations, "was conceived of as seed
money to get us off the ground.
"None of these can be counted on
as repeatable," said Leland. "We feel
it's appropriate that students show
their support in this way at this time."
Leland explained that "ARLO is
still at the development stage," and
will not be ready to apply for
permanent funding from either the
University or private foundations "for
two to three years."

The fee assessment, "will permit us
to continue through this critical period
of development, and also demonstrate
to other funding agencies that students
are willing to financially support
ARLO," he said.
Leland estimated that 130 students
have been involved in ARLO's 30 to
35 projects, 20 of which have already
been completed, and said that ARLO
funding "should never be carried
entirely by students since there are
other constituencies we serve, such as
the outside community.
"Tight financial times," he
explained, have made it necessary to
apply for this "one-time" assessment.

"Where else can you go?" asked
ASSU Legal Counseling Office (LCO)
Secretary Nancy Daum after
explaining that pre-paid student legal
services will cease if LCO's request for
a $2 fee assessment is not approved.
LCO is one of nine organizations
requesting a total of $14 in special fee
assessments to be voted on in next
week's elections. The $1 ASSU
Program Fee brings the total requests
to $15.
Daum said the LCO, created by the
ASSU in October 1973, has relied on
fee assessment funding since its
inception, and has not explored other
avenues of possible funding because

students are the only recipients of its
services.
The LCO reports that 486 students
received legal assistance during Fall
and Winter Quarters in such areas as
torts, consumer disputes, criminal
actions and administrative, family and
employment problems. Over 1400
students have visited the office seeking
legal advice during the last year and a
half.
