# Batsmen Walk To Victory

### DAN PYNE 
Tenacity pays.
Five innings into yesterday's
baseball game at Sunken
Diamond, the Stanford Cardinals
were down 4-0. The batters scored
three runs in the bottom half of
the inning.
Nine innings into the game the
Cards were down 6-4 with two
outs and no one on base. With a
little patience and a little luck,
Stanford scored three runs on two
hits and edged UC-Hayward 7-6.
It was not exactly a
picture-book victory. Foui
Cardinal batters reached first base
in the first three innings, and four
Cardinal batters were thrown out
— three at second and one picked
off of first. In addition, Stanford
committed three errors and went
through four pitchers.
But Hayward literally handed
the game away, as its four hurlers
gave up 13 walks and three infield
singles, which accounted for four
of Stanford's runs, including the
ones in the ninth.
First baseman Ken Rodrigues
gave Hayward the lead in the top
of the first with a towering home
run to left field, and the lead did
not change hands again until the
ninth. Hayward added runs in the
second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and
eighth innings.
Mike Williamson started the
game for Stanford and went three
innings, allowing two runs on four
hits, before yielding the mound to
Bernie Hittner, who lasted only an
inning and two men. Hittner
allowed two more runs to cross
the plate, and had men on second
and third when he left the game in
the fifth.
A 1 Arthur replaced him, and
also allowed two runs, both
unearned. One runner scored on a
passed ball in the sixth, and
another man scored in the eighth
on a wild pitch. Ed Matta, who
pitched the Stanford ninth and
collected the win, faced only
three Hayward batters.
The Cardinals picked up three
of their runs in the fifth when
third baseman Gary Pitchford
doubled to left center with the
bases loaded, and one more in the
eighth when Hayward's Garnett
Houghton walked in designated
hitter Randy Wong.
Houghton picked up the loss in
the ninth when, after retiring
Pitchford and Bruce Robinson, he

walked Tom Guardino, gave up a
double to Wong, and walked Dave
Perez. Centerfielder Bob Hampton
dribbled an infield single up the
middle to score Guardino,
narrowing Hayward's lead to 6-5.
Then, standing alone on the
mound and under lots of pressure,
Houghton threw eight straight
balls to walk in the tying and
winning runs.

The Cards, now 21-14, face
San Francisco State on Sunken
Diamond at 2:30 p.m. today. Jim
Scharffenberger will be on the
mound for Stanford.

Five innings into yesterday's
baseball game at Sunken
Diamond, the Stanford Cardinals
were down 4-0. The batters scored
three runs in the bottom half of
the inning.
Nine innings into the game the
Cards were down 6-4 with two
outs and no one on base. With a
little patience and a little luck,
Stanford scored three runs on two
hits and edged UC-Hayward 7-6.
It was not exactly a
picture-book victory. Foui
Cardinal batters reached first base
in the first three innings, and four
Cardinal batters were thrown out
— three at second and one picked
off of first. In addition, Stanford
committed three errors and went
through four pitchers.
But Hayward literally handed
the game away, as its four hurlers
gave up 13 walks and three infield
singles, which accounted for four
of Stanford's runs, including the
ones in the ninth.
First baseman Ken Rodrigues
gave Hayward the lead in the top
of the first with a towering home
run to left field, and the lead did
not change hands again until the
ninth. Hayward added runs in the
second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and
eighth innings.
Mike Williamson started the
game for Stanford and went three
innings, allowing two runs on four
hits, before yielding the mound to
Bernie Hittner, who lasted only an
inning and two men. Hittner
allowed two more runs to cross
the plate, and had men on second
and third when he left the game in
the fifth.
A 1 Arthur replaced him, and
also allowed two runs, both
unearned. One runner scored on a
passed ball in the sixth, and
another man scored in the eighth
on a wild pitch. Ed Matta, who
pitched the Stanford ninth and
collected the win, faced only
three Hayward batters.
The Cardinals picked up three
of their runs in the fifth when
third baseman Gary Pitchford
doubled to left center with the
bases loaded, and one more in the
eighth when Hayward's Garnett
Houghton walked in designated
hitter Randy Wong.
Houghton picked up the loss in
the ninth when, after retiring
Pitchford and Bruce Robinson, he

walked Tom Guardino, gave up a
double to Wong, and walked Dave
Perez. Centerfielder Bob Hampton
dribbled an infield single up the
middle to score Guardino,
narrowing Hayward's lead to 6-5.
Then, standing alone on the
mound and under lots of pressure,
Houghton threw eight straight
balls to walk in the tying and
winning runs.
