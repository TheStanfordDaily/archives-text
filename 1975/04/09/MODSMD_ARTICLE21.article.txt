# Capture The Big Moments
## 
### 

Writing sports for the Stanford Daily has its moments.
Like Mike Langford's Big Game field goal or the
back-to-back USC â€” UCLA basketball wins. But we
can't capture them without you. The Daily needs
writers to cover everything from football to fencing.
Come to a meeting today at 3 p.m. if you would like
to write sports. No previous journalism experience is
required.
