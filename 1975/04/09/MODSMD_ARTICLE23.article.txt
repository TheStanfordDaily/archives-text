Weyand Urges Prompt Military Aid
WASHINGTON - Army Chief of Staff Gen. Frederick
Weyand has recommended to President Ford that
Congress be asked for at least $550 million in immediate,
additional military aid for South Vietnam, State
Department sources said yesterday.
The recommendation by Weyand, who returned over the
weekend from an inspection trip to South Vietnam, would
increase by $200 million the aid being sought by the
administration for the Saigon government.
Weyand reportedly told Ford and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger that the South Vietnamese army is still
capable of fighting and if given the necessary aid could hold
off further North Vietnamese attacks.
The general also told the administration leaders that
without the half billion dollars in new military aid, the
current Saigon regime probably would not survive more
than a few months.
Meantime, Sen. Henrv Jackson (D-Wash.) said
yesterday informed sources had told him of secret
agreements between the United States and South Vietnam.
In a Senate speech, Jackson called on the administration
to release the contents of the agreements, which
presumably promised American military intervention if the
North Vietnamese seriously violated the 1973 Paris peace
accords.
State Department spokesman Robert Anderson has said
that "I am unaware of any secret agreements."
However, he said he had not checked the Jackson claims
with Kissinger.
Weyand appeared in secret sessions yesterday before
both the House and Senate committees to review his trip to
Southeast Asia.
Weyand is seeking to increase the total of American
military aid to Vietnam for the current fiscal year to $1.2
billion. Congress so far has appropriated about $700 million
out of a total of $1 billion it had authorized for fiscal 1975.
The administration had originally asked for $1.4 billion
in arms aid for Saigon for this fiscal year.
Meanwhile, in Saigon, President Nguyen Van Thieu
vowed to hold onto power yesterday after a lone South
Vietnamese air force plane bombed and rocketed his palace.
Opposition politicians interpreted the attack as a warning
to Thieu to change his policies or leave office.
Premier To Resist Khmer Rouge
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Battles raged in the center
of a key provincial town west of Phnom Penh yesterday as
Premier Long Boret returned from a reported meeting with
Khmer Rouge leaders and declared, "We will never
surrender."
Field reports said rebels slammed more than 400 shells
into Kompong Speu 30 miles from Phom Penh, killing an
estimated 100 people.
Long Boret laughed at reports that he had met with the
Khmer Rouge in Bangkok, neither confirming nor denying
them. Thai Foreign Minister Chartichai Choonhavan said
Long Boret spent four hours Monday night "with a party of
the other side concerning peace talks."
In an interview yesterday, the premier said, "We have to
resist and strengthen our internal front by mobilizing all
our energy."

1974 Living Costs Up 13.5 Percent
WASHINGTON — The typical urban American family of
four requires $14,300 annually to maintain a moderate
standard of living, the Labor Department said yesterday.
This, after the worst inflation in 28 years, is $1733 more
than the previous year.
The same family can live at an austere level of $9200 or
at a level allowing some luxuries for $20,800, the
government said.
The costs, calculated for fall 1974 before taxes, rose
12.4 percent for the austerity budget, 13.5 percent for the
moderate budget and 14.2 percent for the higher budget
over the previous year.
Godfather 11 Dominates Oscars
LOS ANGELES — The Godfather Part II swept the field
in last night's Academy Awards presentation, winning six
Oscars — including the one for best picture of 1974.
Godfather 11, the second part of the story of Don
Corleone's fictional Mafia family, also won Oscars for
Francis Ford Coppola's writing and direction, Robert De
Niro's supporting role, and Carmine Coppola's original
dramatic score.
Art Carney was a surprise choice as best actor for his
role as a retired teacher in Harry and Tonto. Ellen Burstyn's
portrayal of a widowed housewife in Alice Doesn't Live
Here Anymore won her the award for best actress.
Chinatown, predicted by many to dominate the awards,
picked up only one Oscar — for best original screenplay.
The Towering Inferno won three Oscars, Earthquake two,
and Great Gatsby two.
Patty Rumored En Route To Algeria
SAN FRANCISCO — Television news reporter Marilyn
Baker of KPIX-TV said last night she had received an
unconfirmed report that fugitive Patty Hearst, accompanied
by radical sports figure Jack Scott and his wife Micki, were
flying into Algeria last night.
Baker, who won a Peabody award for her reporting of
the Hearst heiress' kidnaping last year, said officials in
Algeria had refused to comment on the report that the trio
might seek asylum in that country.
Charles Bates, agent in charge of the FBI office in San
Francisco, said he had no knowledge of the report and that
it was the first he had heard connecting Miss Hearst with
Algeria.
On her 11 p.m. newscast, Baker said she had received
"unconfirmed" reports from "three independent sources"
that the fugitives would land in North Africa before
midnight Tuesday.
Baker speculated the three were flying from either
Hungary or Cuba.
The U.S. maintains no diplomatic relations with North
Africa and several other prominent fugitives have sought
refuge there.
