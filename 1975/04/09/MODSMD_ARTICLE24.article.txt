# Franklin Wins Research Grant For Book On 'Crime' In U.S.
## 
### RICHARD FEARON 
H. Bruce Franklin, fired from the
Stanford faculty in 1972 for allegedly
inciting students to violence, has
received a research fellowship from the
Rockefeller Foundation to work on a
forthcoming book.
One of 42 grants awarded to
professors around the country, the
one-year fellowship was based on a
national competition held for the
grants, said contacted at his
Middletown, Connecticut, home. The
recipients, after describing their
projects in detail, were selected by a
Board of Humanists, composed of
distinguished people from across the

nation, he said.
Rejecting the idea that it is
hypocritical for an avowed
Marxist-Leninist to receive a
Rockefeller grant, Franklin said he felt
it was no more hypocritical than to
work as a professor at Stanford.
'A Lot Better*
"And besides, the grant is a lot
better than a lot of things that
Rockefeller money goes for," he
added.
Franklin is currently teaching
literature courses at Wesleyan
University and at Yale. He said he
intends to spend most of his time next
year working on his book and possibly
teaching a few classes.
The Victim as Criminal and Artist:
Crimes of Work and Poverty in
American Literature is the title of
Franklin's new work. Hie book will be a
study of the literature of people who
have committed crimes and then
become artists, said Franklin.
Slave Narrations
The book is planned to begin with
the slave narrations and continue
through present day criminal artists,
writers and musicians, he said. "It
should be finished no later than the
summer of 1976."
Another of Franklin's books, Back
Where You Came From, an informal
history of the United States since
World War 11, is scheduled to be
published in about three weeks.
Written as a political autobiography,
the book contains a chapter on the
history of Stanford and his
experiences here, Franklin said.
"It's the evolution of the Univeristy

as an institution," he remarked.
'The essence of the University is
exposed," said Franklin. 'The major
business of Stanford Univeristy is to
provide for the interlocking of the
economic empire in the Pacific Basin."
The University's main function is to
expand and export capital for that
empire, he said.
The book also delves into the
University's decision to fire Franklin,
he noted.
Franklin said the University
decided to fire him when he began
advising students to disrupt the use of
the University's computer center
which was programming an air and sea
invasion of North Vietnam. The
University claimed he was inciting
students to violence, he added.
"I was specifically fired for the
speeches I made," he claimed. "I think
that brings >ut very clearly what the
University is about."
After he was dismissed, the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) filed suit on behalf of
Franklin, against the University in
Santa Clara County Superior Court.
"Our case is based mainly on the
First Amendment," said Franklin.
'The ACLU felt that it was a flagrant
violation."
According to Mike Callahan, public
information director for the Northern
California branch of the ACLU, the
case is still pending.
"It still has to go to trial in Santa
Clara County," Callahan said. "The
court has overruled motions made by
Stanford for demurrer and summary
judgement so far."

experiences here, Franklin said.
"It's the evolution of the Univeristy

as an institution," he remarked.
'The essence of the University is
exposed," said Franklin. 'The major
business of Stanford Univeristy is to
provide for the interlocking of the
economic empire in the Pacific Basin."
The University's main function is to
expand and export capital for that
empire, he said.
The book also delves into the
University's decision to fire Franklin,
he noted.
Franklin said the University
decided to fire him when he began
advising students to disrupt the use of
the University's computer center
which was programming an air and sea
invasion of North Vietnam. The
University claimed he was inciting
students to violence, he added.
"I was specifically fired for the
speeches I made," he claimed. "I think
that brings >ut very clearly what the
University is about."
After he was dismissed, the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) filed suit on behalf of
Franklin, against the University in
Santa Clara County Superior Court.
"Our case is based mainly on the
First Amendment," said Franklin.
'The ACLU felt that it was a flagrant
violation."
According to Mike Callahan, public
information director for the Northern
California branch of the ACLU, the
case is still pending.
"It still has to go to trial in Santa
Clara County," Callahan said. "The
court has overruled motions made by
Stanford for demurrer and summary
judgement so far."
H. Bruce Franklin, fired from the
Stanford faculty in 1972 for allegedly
inciting students to violence, has
received a research fellowship from the
Rockefeller Foundation to work on a
forthcoming book.
One of 42 grants awarded to
professors around the country, the
one-year fellowship was based on a
national competition held for the
grants, said contacted at his
Middletown, Connecticut, home. The
recipients, after describing their
projects in detail, were selected by a
Board of Humanists, composed of
distinguished people from across the

nation, he said.
Rejecting the idea that it is
hypocritical for an avowed
Marxist-Leninist to receive a
Rockefeller grant, Franklin said he felt
it was no more hypocritical than to
work as a professor at Stanford.
'A Lot Better*
"And besides, the grant is a lot
better than a lot of things that
Rockefeller money goes for," he
added.
Franklin is currently teaching
literature courses at Wesleyan
University and at Yale. He said he
intends to spend most of his time next
year working on his book and possibly
teaching a few classes.
The Victim as Criminal and Artist:
Crimes of Work and Poverty in
American Literature is the title of
Franklin's new work. Hie book will be a
study of the literature of people who
have committed crimes and then
become artists, said Franklin.
Slave Narrations
The book is planned to begin with
the slave narrations and continue
through present day criminal artists,
writers and musicians, he said. "It
should be finished no later than the
summer of 1976."
Another of Franklin's books, Back
Where You Came From, an informal
history of the United States since
World War 11, is scheduled to be
published in about three weeks.
Written as a political autobiography,
the book contains a chapter on the
history of Stanford and his
experiences here, Franklin said.
