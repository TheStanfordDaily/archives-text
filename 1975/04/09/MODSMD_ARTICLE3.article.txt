# Jameson's 'Grassroots' Slate Competes For COP Positions

First of Five Parts
Mechanical Engineering major
Charles Jameson says that he hopes
that "sincerity, honesty and
willingness to work for the students"
will combine to boost his slate to the
top of the Council of Presidents
election polls next week.
A junior transfer from Claremont
Men's College, Jameson heads a slate
which his running mate, Pau! Collopy,
calls a "grass roots, organic
alternative" to their more
politically-oriented opponents in next
week's election.
"Realistically, perhaps we won't
win," admits Collopy a sophomore
Electrical Engineering major. "But if
students actually talk to us, maybe
they will vote for us."
Besides Jameson and Collopy, the
ticket includes junior Mechanical
Engineering major Walt Pyka and
junior transfer Biology major Dave
Cooper (from UC-Davis).
"We want the experience of
running," says Jameson, adding that it
would be a good way to' become
acquainted with other students and
the election process itself.
"We feel that we can empathize
with and understand how the students
feel about what is being done to
them," Jameson says. He adds that
both the administration and the
ASSU, are major antagonists that
contrive to "nickel and dime the
Stanford students who objects to"
their actions.
Collopy noted the slate will take a
strong stand against the administration
when it differs from student wishes
and will work to make the ASSU "a
service organization, not ripping off
students but working for them."
However, his running mates said they
have no specific ideas on how the slate
will accomplish this, insisting they
would be open to student input.
Collopy says, the goal of the slate is
first to seek out and assess student
attitudes on campus issues and then to
answer them.
In order to establish a hot line for
student input, the slate proposes to set
up a weekly column in the Daily. The
slate says this article would explain the
different aspects of some relevant

issue, and would be followed by
questions polling student opinions.
Students would then be advised to call
a 24-hour telephone service with their
reaction the slate says.
Daily Editor Kevin Smith says,
however, that he has not discussed the
proposal with the Jameson slate.
Collopy adds that the slate might
also keep in touch with student feeling
concerning the larger and more
important issues through a random
monthly telephone survey.
The slate has not yet outlined how
it will answer the student demands
once they have been assessed. "If we
put too many planks in the platform
now," Collopy warns, "then we would
have to go full steam ahead on
executing those stands."
Slate members do, however, have a
few general plans. If the telephone

surveys reveal a demand, they would
like to start a pizzeria on campus,
though they admit they have not yet
researched the feasibility of this
possibility, Collopy says.
Though Jameson has served as an
intern on the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement this year,
and Pyka was the Junipero dorm
president autumn quarter, the
members of the slate admit that they
have had little political experience at
Stanford.
Jameson and Collopy say that they
do have a basic understanding of the
Stanford political process and ASSU
organization and procedures. If they
are elected, they say they will remain
at Stanford over the summer in order
to become better acquainted both
with the political procedures and with
Stanford administrators.

GRASS ROOTS—Charles Jameson, Dave Cooper, Paul Collopy and Walt Pyka are running a "grassroots student advocacy"
campaign for the ASSU presidency.
First of Five Parts
Mechanical Engineering major
Charles Jameson says that he hopes
that "sincerity, honesty and
willingness to work for the students"
will combine to boost his slate to the
top of the Council of Presidents
election polls next week.
A junior transfer from Claremont
Men's College, Jameson heads a slate
which his running mate, Pau! Collopy,
calls a "grass roots, organic
alternative" to their more
politically-oriented opponents in next
week's election.
"Realistically, perhaps we won't
win," admits Collopy a sophomore
Electrical Engineering major. "But if
students actually talk to us, maybe
they will vote for us."
Besides Jameson and Collopy, the
ticket includes junior Mechanical
Engineering major Walt Pyka and
junior transfer Biology major Dave
Cooper (from UC-Davis).
"We want the experience of
running," says Jameson, adding that it
would be a good way to' become
acquainted with other students and
the election process itself.
"We feel that we can empathize
with and understand how the students
feel about what is being done to
them," Jameson says. He adds that
both the administration and the
ASSU, are major antagonists that
contrive to "nickel and dime the
Stanford students who objects to"
their actions.
Collopy noted the slate will take a
strong stand against the administration
when it differs from student wishes
and will work to make the ASSU "a
service organization, not ripping off
students but working for them."
However, his running mates said they
have no specific ideas on how the slate
will accomplish this, insisting they
would be open to student input.
Collopy says, the goal of the slate is
first to seek out and assess student
attitudes on campus issues and then to
answer them.
In order to establish a hot line for
student input, the slate proposes to set
up a weekly column in the Daily. The
slate says this article would explain the
different aspects of some relevant

issue, and would be followed by
questions polling student opinions.
Students would then be advised to call
a 24-hour telephone service with their
reaction the slate says.
Daily Editor Kevin Smith says,
however, that he has not discussed the
proposal with the Jameson slate.
Collopy adds that the slate might
also keep in touch with student feeling
concerning the larger and more
important issues through a random
monthly telephone survey.
The slate has not yet outlined how
it will answer the student demands
once they have been assessed. "If we
put too many planks in the platform
now," Collopy warns, "then we would
have to go full steam ahead on
executing those stands."
Slate members do, however, have a
few general plans. If the telephone

surveys reveal a demand, they would
like to start a pizzeria on campus,
though they admit they have not yet
researched the feasibility of this
possibility, Collopy says.
Though Jameson has served as an
intern on the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement this year,
and Pyka was the Junipero dorm
president autumn quarter, the
members of the slate admit that they
have had little political experience at
Stanford.
