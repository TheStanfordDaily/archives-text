# Settlement Sought In Parking Battle
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER DAN FIDUCCIA 
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger has
proposed a compromise in an effort to
convince the Escondido Village
Council and the ASSU Senate to drop
their lawsuit against the University,
the Daily has learned.
Under the compromise, which grew
out of a meeting Friday between
Augsburger, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, and ASSU Senators
Mike Lindsey and Pieter Winsemius,
the University would no longer use
any money collected as rent to pay for
parking services and maintenance. It
would also permit all automobiles
registered to students to use the
"Off-Campus Permit" parking areas.
Currently, part of each student's
room or house rent goes to pay for
parking maintenance services. Under
the compromise proposal, all funds for
such services would come from vehicle
registration fees.
Won't 'Charge Twice'
Augsburger confirmed the
compromise offer last night, and said
he had proposed details in a letter to
Winsemius mailed yesterday. "We

indicated that we were willing to not
charge parking against houses," he
explained, noting that many students
complained they were "charged twice"
for parking.
Under the proposal, all funds for
parking maintenance would come
from vehicle registration fees.
However, Augsburger admitted that
the savings, which he estimated at
from $10,000 to $15,000, would "not
be reflected immediately" in room and
board rates. He also said there would
be no rebates of fees already paid.
Presently, students living on
campus can only purchase permits
allowing them to park near their
residences. However, under
Augsburger's proposal, the same
permits would allow them to park in
areas currently restricted to those
living off campus. Augsburger said this
would help alleviate charges against
the University that students must
register their cars on campus, but can't
drive them.
Neither Winsemius nor Lindsey
would comment at length before
seeing the details of the compromise
offer. "I want to think about it for a
while and see how much money is
involved," Lindsey said. But he
expressed concern that Augsburger
had ruled out any rebates. "That's too
bad. I wish he had taken a different
tack," Lindsey said.
Winsemius said he hoped monthly
rents in Escondido Village would be
reduced if the compromise went into
effect. "I want to know what funds
will become available to the Village,"
he explained. Augsburger, however,
indicated that rents would only be
affected in the long run.
Escondido Village Council
President Cathie Colson immediately
blasted the proposal. "This is a lot of
good for us now, when we've already
spent our money," she said. She
pointed out that there are only eight
weeks left in the school year.
She admitted she had not read the
proposal, but said the lawsuit would
certainly no be dropped, because the
same problems remained. "Most
people don't want to park on
campus," she explained.

tack," Lindsey said.
Winsemius said he hoped monthly
rents in Escondido Village would be
reduced if the compromise went into
effect. "I want to know what funds
will become available to the Village,"
he explained. Augsburger, however,
indicated that rents would only be
affected in the long run.
Escondido Village Council
President Cathie Colson immediately
blasted the proposal. "This is a lot of
good for us now, when we've already
spent our money," she said. She
pointed out that there are only eight
weeks left in the school year.
She admitted she had not read the
proposal, but said the lawsuit would
certainly no be dropped, because the
same problems remained. "Most
people don't want to park on
campus," she explained.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger has
proposed a compromise in an effort to
convince the Escondido Village
Council and the ASSU Senate to drop
their lawsuit against the University,
the Daily has learned.
Under the compromise, which grew
out of a meeting Friday between
Augsburger, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, and ASSU Senators
Mike Lindsey and Pieter Winsemius,
the University would no longer use
any money collected as rent to pay for
parking services and maintenance. It
would also permit all automobiles
registered to students to use the
"Off-Campus Permit" parking areas.
Currently, part of each student's
room or house rent goes to pay for
parking maintenance services. Under
the compromise proposal, all funds for
such services would come from vehicle
registration fees.
Won't 'Charge Twice'
Augsburger confirmed the
compromise offer last night, and said
he had proposed details in a letter to
Winsemius mailed yesterday. "We

indicated that we were willing to not
charge parking against houses," he
explained, noting that many students
complained they were "charged twice"
for parking.
Under the proposal, all funds for
parking maintenance would come
from vehicle registration fees.
However, Augsburger admitted that
the savings, which he estimated at
from $10,000 to $15,000, would "not
be reflected immediately" in room and
board rates. He also said there would
be no rebates of fees already paid.
Presently, students living on
campus can only purchase permits
allowing them to park near their
residences. However, under
Augsburger's proposal, the same
permits would allow them to park in
areas currently restricted to those
living off campus. Augsburger said this
would help alleviate charges against
the University that students must
register their cars on campus, but can't
drive them.
Neither Winsemius nor Lindsey
would comment at length before
seeing the details of the compromise
offer. "I want to think about it for a
while and see how much money is
involved," Lindsey said. But he
expressed concern that Augsburger
had ruled out any rebates. "That's too
bad. I wish he had taken a different
tack," Lindsey said.
Winsemius said he hoped monthly
rents in Escondido Village would be
reduced if the compromise went into
effect. "I want to know what funds
will become available to the Village,"
he explained. Augsburger, however,
