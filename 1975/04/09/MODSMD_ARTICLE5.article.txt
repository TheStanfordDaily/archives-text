# 'Daily' Asks Funds; Cites Greater Costs
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
After operating without any
student funds since the fall quarter of
1973, the Stanford Daily is requesting
$3 in refundable fee assessments for
next year, contingent upon the
University paying an equal per issue
fee for faculty and staff subscriptions.
If endorsed in balloting next
Wednesday and Thursday, students
will pay $1 each of fall, winter and
summer quarters toward the
operation.
Daily Business Manager Michael
Kuhl explained that the principal
reason the paper is going for an
assessment is the increased costs that
have occurred, because of the lagging
economy.
"Newsprint has gone up about 40
percent in two years," he said, and the
costs are passed on to the Daily from
Nowels Publications, which prints the
paper. The Daily is now printed on
thinner and narrower paper, Kuhl
continued.
Additional Costs
The ASSU Typesetting Shopbill has
only gone up two-and-a-half percent a
year, but Kuhl noted that portions of
the contract expire after this year, so
it will have to be renegotiated.
When the University adopted the
centrex phone system and changed
its billing system, $1000 was added
to Daily costs, Kuhl estimated.
While costs have increased,
University and student funding for the
Daily has decreased sharply, Kuhl
noted. In 1971-1972, the Daily
received $63,000 in support from
student assessments and from the
University. This combined support was
decreased to $40,000 in 1972-1973,
including a $3 student assessment; to
$28,000 last year, including a $1
student assessment; and $17,500
solely from University support this
year.
The Daily has attempted to make
up this loss of money by increasing
advertising rates twice during this year.
Even though this has amounted to a
20 percent rate hike, the number of
inches of advertising has actually
increased. This is atypical of college
papers this year, Daily Editor Kevin
Smith said.
Despite this, the Daily has
already had to dip into its $23,000

in reserves to cover an $8000 to
$10,000 deficit this year and a
projected $31,000 deficit next year,
Smith said.
The money from the University and
students would bring in $34,000,
creating a 10 percent cushion over and
above the predicted loss.
Attorney William Kartozian,
member of the Daily Board of
Directors, explained that students
would not be asked to pay the
assessment unless the University
provided $10,000 for faculty-staff
subscriptions, and that the Univeristy
would not have to pay unless the
students approved the money.
Kartozian said it is a "question of
fairness" that both groups should have
to pay for their papers. He said he
thought the University would go along
with the financing because "they
would see it as a bargain and it's the
right thing to do."
Financial Statement Examined
Asst. Dean of Student Affiars Dale
Snape said that he and Janice Sweet of
the University's Business and Finance
office are currently examining the
Daily's financial statement before
presenting it to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons and Vice
President for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig. Snape said he thought
Rosenzweig would make the final
decision, subject to approval by
President Richard Lyman. Snape said
he hoped this would be done in the
next two weeks.
Law student Diane Fields,
chairperson of the Daily Board of
Directors, said the Board "has
discussed the problem of finances
since it has been in existence,"
following Daily independence in
January 1973.
She described the fee assessment as
a "short-run" method to cover the
deficit. The principal long-run plan is
to set up a "Friends of the Daily"
endowment, which is being studied by
former Editor Jim Wascher.
Smith said the fee assessment
election was an important test of
faculty and student support. "If we
don't have support of either the
faculty, staff or students to the point
of about 1.7 cents per issue, then we
should re-evaluate the whole role of
the paper," Smith said.
