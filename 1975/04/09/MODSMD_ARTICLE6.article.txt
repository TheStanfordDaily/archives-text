## Opinions editorial Vote McDermott 
### 
For election to the ASSU Council of Presidents, the Daily
endorses the slate of Kevin McDermott, Bonny Rodden,
Andrew Leuchter and Mark SiYnonian.
This is a decision reached neither lightly nor hastily. It
represents both a careful consideration of the various slates'
platforms and our own discussions with the candidates.
Veteran Daily readers will recall that we have frequently
not hesitated to split or withhold our endorsement when
circumstances have warranted it. In fact, this is our first
untempered endorsement in three years. There are
compelling reasons for it.
First of all, we have been impressed by the obvious
forethought and preparation that has gone into the
McDermott slate's platform. In the past few years, it has
become fashionable for slates to compile lengthy shopping
lists of things that "should" be done or "ought" to be done.
This has been the tack taken by the Lee Rosenbaum slate,
but we feel this simply isn't sufficient: candidates have a
responsibility to consider how much can reasonably be
accomplished, and how it can be done. In these areas, we
found the Rosenbaum slate lacking.
The McDermott group, on the other hand, presented
proposals that were both substantive and explicit — and,
what's more, slate members have already done some talking
to University administrators to determine just what is and
isn't feasible.
We also must commend the McDermott slate's position
on the role of the ASSU as a basically break-even
proposition, turning only a large enough profit to avoid
jeopardizing its programs. We,too, have little stomach for an
"ASSU Inc." approach to the organization's financial
activities.
We have also been impressed with the slate's proposals to
institute frequent surveys to help gauge student opinion,
and to create a student advisory panel on tuition (although
we reserve final judgment on the latter until we see just how
much clout such a panel will have).
We should make clear that we expect no miracles from
the McDermott slate. The University, set in its ways, too
often seems to have little use for student input no matter
what its source — and we expect no ASSU officials to alter
that situation overnight.
Nevertheless, we feel that the McDermott slate is best
equipped to deal with the problems of the ASSU. From
what we have seen, they appear both the most thoughtful
and most hardworking ticket, and we urge their election
next week.

lists of things that "should" be done or "ought" to be done.
This has been the tack taken by the Lee Rosenbaum slate,
but we feel this simply isn't sufficient: candidates have a
responsibility to consider how much can reasonably be
accomplished, and how it can be done. In these areas, we
found the Rosenbaum slate lacking.
The McDermott group, on the other hand, presented
proposals that were both substantive and explicit — and,
what's more, slate members have already done some talking
to University administrators to determine just what is and
isn't feasible.
We also must commend the McDermott slate's position
on the role of the ASSU as a basically break-even
proposition, turning only a large enough profit to avoid
jeopardizing its programs. We,too, have little stomach for an
"ASSU Inc." approach to the organization's financial
activities.
We have also been impressed with the slate's proposals to
institute frequent surveys to help gauge student opinion,
and to create a student advisory panel on tuition (although
we reserve final judgment on the latter until we see just how
much clout such a panel will have).
We should make clear that we expect no miracles from
the McDermott slate. The University, set in its ways, too
often seems to have little use for student input no matter
what its source — and we expect no ASSU officials to alter
that situation overnight.
Nevertheless, we feel that the McDermott slate is best
equipped to deal with the problems of the ASSU. From
what we have seen, they appear both the most thoughtful
and most hardworking ticket, and we urge their election
next week.
