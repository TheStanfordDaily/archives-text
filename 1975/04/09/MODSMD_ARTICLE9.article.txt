# News For Sale: CBS Makes A Deal
## 
### Terry Anzur 
The CBS television newsmagazine, 60
Minutes was pre-empted March 23 and 30 by
a cat-and-mouse game between former White
House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman and
newsman Mike Wallace. CBS admits it paid
Haldeman at least $50,000 for the interviews
and the right to air Haldeman's home movies
of the Nixon years.
The broadcasts proved one thing: a
purchased interview costs the public much
more than it's worth.
What the interview fee didn't buy was an
admission of Watergate wrongdoing.
Haldeman has been convicted of perjury,
conspiracy and obstruction of justice in
connection with the Watergate break-in and
coverup. During the interview he "pleaded
guilty" to only two things: abandoning his
crew-cut hairstyle for a less austere look and
believing in an adversary relationship
between the President and Congress.
The closest he came to an admission of
cnminal guilt was in conceding that "failure
to destroy the tapes was another of my errors
of judgment in Watergate."
No Confessions
Haldeman said Nixon once raised the
question of whether the White House tapes
should be destroyed. At that point in time,
"my strong recommendation was that they
should not be destroyed," Haldeman told
Wallace.
But later, "when it got to the point of
having to release them or having even to
consider the possibility of releasing fhern,
they should have been, in my opinion now,
destroyed," HaldeTnan added.
He wasn't exactly confessing a sin. He was
saying that he should have done a more
effective job of managing the coverup. It
didn't seem to occur to him that destroying
evidence would be wrong. Haldeman
repeatedly presented himself and the former
President as good guys who talked tough and
dirty in private, made some bad management
decisions and got caught.
The interview fee didn't prevent
Haldeman from passing the buck. He credited
Heniy Kissinger with temperamental genius

and with a major role in approving wiretap
activities. He also stated flatly that John
Mitchell left Washington because of his wife,
Martha, not because of Watergate.
Inept Questions
The biggest crime of all was that Wallace
— often touted as the toughest questioner in
American broadcast journalism — let
Haldeman use the interview as a personal
soapbox.
Wallace told viewers, at least twice, that
Haldeman "knew Richard Nixon the man
and Richard Nixon the President better than
anyone else." But he was extremely inept in
devising and asking questions that would
draw out what Haldeman knew. Even

allowing for the difficulty of editing a
six-hour conversation into two one-hour
shows, it was sloppy journalism indeed.
Wallace's scatter-shot method of
questioning produced few direct hits. When
he did expose a cnick in Haldeman's
stone wall, he failed to ask followup
questions. Instead, he bounced from topic to
topic and asked some questions more worthy
of a "plumber" than a reporter. Some of the
most insightless queries concerned
Haldeman's relationship to Pat Nixon
(Haldeman said there wasn't any) and
Haldeman's "love" for Nixon (Haldeman said
he-respected Nixon but never "loved" him).
Haldeman volunteered only
rationalizations of Watergate behavior.
Instead of pressing for explanations, Wallace
sat back and sneered like a fat and lazy cat
watching a clever mouse make off with a big
hunk of cheese. $50,000 worth.

Wallace explained his own performance on
a public TV program called Behind the Lines.
His responses to questions from panelists
representing the New York Times and Time
magazine raise some serious questions about
the ethics of buying news.
Wallace claimed that interview fees should
be permitted because journalists in other
countries, including the Soviet Union, have
been buying interviews for a long time. A
man who seems ready to exchange a free
press for the low level of journalistic integrity
demonstrated by Soviet news agencies is, at
best, ill-equipped to function as a journalistic
adversary or as an advocate of the public's
right to be informed.
Bill Leonard, a senior vice-president of
CBS news, also appeared on Behind the Lines
and admitted that CBS has paid for talks
with the late former President Dwight
Eisenhower and exiled Russian writer
Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
Is there a difference between a
newsmaker's "memoirs" and statements of
public record? Should a participant in a
televised interview receive the same credit as
the author of a magazine article or a maker
of home movies? Leonard indicated that CBS
would not have paid $50,000 for Haldeman's
home movies alone.
William Sheehan of ABC news has stated
that "ABC will not pay any news source for
news — even if it means losing the interview."
But CBS and others are keeping their options
open.
One can respect Haldeman's sense of free
enterprise in selling his views for whatever
price the market will bear. But there's no
excuse for broadcasters who are charged with
upholding the public interest. Unless news
organizations decide that interview
"bargains" are offers they can refuse,
journalistic standards could be reduced to
"all the news that's fit to buy." And the
public, in the long run, will be forced to pay
the bills.
