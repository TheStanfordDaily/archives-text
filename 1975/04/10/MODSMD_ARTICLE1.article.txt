# ASSU Senate Alters Olivieri Fee Program
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
In over three and a half hours of
discussion in a special meeting, the
ASSU Senate last night decided to
change the program fee allocations
recommended by ASSU Financial
Manager Frank Olivieri.
As of midnight, no definite decision
had been made, but senators had
indicated interest in changing the
funds allocated to 28 out of 64
organizations requesting program fee
funds.
Sen. Debbi Silton suggested that a
two quarter program fee assessment be
made so that organizations asking for
more funds than Olivieri had
recommended could be allocated more
money without cutting into the funds
recommended for other groups.
The two quarter assessment would
leave the ASSU Senate with about
$5,000 extra, Silton estimated. This,
she suggested, could be used as a
discretionary fund by next year's
Senate to finance other groups,
including any that could not come to
last night's special meeting because
they had not been given adequate
notice.
Among organizations which
received no funds in the Olivieri
porposal but which will probably be
given some funding by the Senate are
the ASSU Course Review, Tresidder
Program Board, and several academic
organizations.
Club Sports, a last-minute addition
to the list under consideration because
the group just learned yesterday of

cuts in its budget, will also receive
consideration. Senators indicated that
the club would probably receive less
than the $7400 it is requesting.
Politically-oriented organizations
such as the Alliance for Radical
Change and the California Republican
League are among those groups whose
allocations will probably be cut.
