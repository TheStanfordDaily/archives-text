# Stanford Daily-Yes
## 
### 
We recommend a YES vote on the $3 fee assessment ($1
of which will be collected in the summer) requested by The
Stanford Daily.
When the Daily became an independent newspaper in
January 1973, it promised that it would be able to exist on
advertising revenue alone after the 1974-75 school year.
Since then, however, unforeseen costs such as a 44 percent
rise in the cost of paper and installation of the Centrex
telephone system have made that projection unrealistic,
despite the fact that the number of advertising inches in the
Daily has actually increased.
In order to be fair to both students and University
employees, the Daily has made the collection of the student
fees, if passed, contingent upon an equal payment per issue
(1.7 cents) from the University, and vice versa. The total
amount the Daily is requesting from the students and the
University is about $34,000 â€” enough to cover the Daily's
projected $31,000 deficit for next year with a small reserve.
Without this money, the Daily probably cannot survive
for more than two more quarters in anything like its present
form. We think 1.7 cents per issue is a small price to pay for
a daily source of campus news.
