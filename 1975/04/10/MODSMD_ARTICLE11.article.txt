# Nor Cal PIRG-No
## 
### 
We recommend a NO vote on the $1 fee assessment
requested by the Northern California Public Interest
Research Group (NorCal PIRG).
One year ago, we recommended a YES vote so that
students could get an opportunity to see what PIRG would
do for them. Now we see that what PIRG has done is
insufficient to warrant further funding of the group.
PIRG's accomplishments are few. The group has done
some surveys comparing nearby gas stations, movie theaters
and the like. These, we believe, have not been of great value
to students, since, for example, some of the lowest-priced
gas stations were omitted in the survey.
PIRG has also lobbied in Sacramento and Washington for
the passage of various consumer protection bills. While we
approve of many of these bills, we think that lobbying
organizations such as Common Cause — and not the
Stanford student body — should finance these efforts.
In fact, there is no reason to believe that other
organizations could not just as well accomplish PIRG's goals.
We don't think students should have to pay for the
administration of essentially redundant services, and we
don't believe Stanford students have received $10,000 worth
of benefits from the money voted last year.
