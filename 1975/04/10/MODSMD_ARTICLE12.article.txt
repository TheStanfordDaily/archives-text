# ARLO-No
## 
### 
We rccommend a NO vote on the $1 fee assessment
requested by the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO).
We do so, however, for very different reasons than those
for which we oppose PIRG's assessment. We tftink ARLO
performs a valuable service to the community, but the group
does not appear to really need the money.
ARLO's financial statement shows that, without any
student support, ARLO has taken in more than twice as
many dollars as it has spent, amassing nearly $10,000 in
surplus funds.
We certainly support ARLO, but would prefer that the
organization not ask the students for money unless it
absolutely needs it.
