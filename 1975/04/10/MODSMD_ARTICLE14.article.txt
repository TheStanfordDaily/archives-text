# Notes On Brown, Drunks, Sellouts
## 
### Tim Ferguson 
Despite popular demand, I didn't flee the
country over spring break. And upon my
return to Stanford, I was faced with a
number of items which resisted being swept
under the rug during my desk's spring
cleaning.
Jerry Brown: Although I'd second Boise
Penrose's motion that "public office is the
last refuge of a scoundrel," I have to offer a
few pats on the back to California's maverick
governor. Brown is taking the paring knife to
the state's bureaucratic enclaves, like his
predecessor tried to do, but unlike Ronald
Reagan, Brown isn't feathering his own nest
in the meantime.
A March 25 Los Angeles Times article
chronicled Brown's disputes with the
University of California Board of Regents,
some members of which find him rude,
arrogant and impatient. In other words,
straight A's for Brown there.
The next day, Brown turned to the State
University and Colleges System, asking,
"Why in the world are salaries more for
administrators when the basic mission of the
university is teaching?"
Meanwhile, Brown's secretary of
transportation, Donald Burns, said the
governor won't go for "Cadillac commuter
systems," the dreams of master planners
notwithstanding.
Immunity through intoxication: An
incredible 4-3 decision of the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court has invalidated the murder,
robbery and burglary convictions of one
Daniel Graves, because, in effect, he was too
drunk to have known what he was doing.
The dissenting judges noted that
Pennsylvanians now need only carry a
revolver in one hand and a quart of liquor in
the other to carry off robbery with impunity.
Power to the people: Those congressional
guardians of the "people's interest," the
Democrats, were busy in late March shoring
up their political fortunes on the farm front.
They engineered passage of a new farm

support bill, reversing a two-year trend away
from federal interference in the nation's grain
belt. The measure would raise government
support prices for wheat, corn and other feed
grains. The consequence will be higher beef
prices for the nation's consumers.
To worsen matters, an amendment by
Sen. James Abourezk (D-S.D.) would ban
import of foreign-raised beef for 90 days. As
a result, prices of the already more expensive
domestic stock would rise yet higher.

Sacrificial souls: I'm treading on sensitive
ground here, I know, but the proponents of
the April 17 "Food Day" ought really to
consider the logical extension of what they
advocate. If sacrificing one's food (i.e. the
reward for one's productivity) for one day is
right, does this mean that consumption of
these fruits of one's labor during this day is
wrong? If so, why? And why only one day?
What is the philosophical limit of the
altruist?
Selling Stanford's soul: An item in the
March 13 Daily prompted my curiosity as
Cardinal basketball fortunes took another
dive. Ex-Stanford cage coach Bob Burnett
called on the admissions department to bend
its standards a little for the sake of Stanford
athletics.
"They do it outside of athletics," he
alleged, "so why can't we get just a couple of
borderline cases for the basketball team?"
I called Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, who deemed Burnett's allegation
"absolutely false" and preferred maintenance

of current standards. "It would be darn hard
to match the academic caliber of the two
Rose Bowl teams," Hargadon said. "We don't
have to go on the assumption that to be good
you have to go with people who can't meet
the requirements."
I'll buy that. Besides, what, other than
residual jingoism, would remain as a reason
to support ; a Stanford athletic program
academically emasculated to the point of its
counterparts at San Jose State or — curse the
thought — USC?
It won't cross the road: My colleague Jim
Wascher accused Peter Carpenter of laying an
egg with his recent report on parking. The
fact is, if we were dealing with a free market
problem and not the whims of some
apparently powerful individuals, this egg
would never hatch.
Relying on the ideologically bankrupt
notion that we "will be able to address the
problem with a sense of collective
responsibility ... rather than that of
self-interested individuals," the report, in
effect, asks drivers to finance their own
demise.
Revenue from sharply increased parking
fees would pay for shuttle bus service for
pedestrians and expanded paths for
bicyclists, under Carpenter's plan.
Meanwhile, drivers would face gradual
curtailment of their current prerogatives.
That hardly sounds like a "user tax" to me.
I don't know what the favored definition
of "equity" is around here at the moment,
but this parking report doesn't fit mine.
Only hurts when you don't laugh: The
Postal Service announced in late March that
it has awarded more than $500,000 in
contracts for outside firms to find out why
the mail doesn't move faster. In case you're
interested, Saturday is National Tax Protest
Day.
