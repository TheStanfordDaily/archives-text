# Retain Campus Parking
## D. Stuedeman 
### 
There is a very simple set of
facts which must be stated with
regard to the parking situation on
campus.
The number of automobiles on
campus will be directly
proportional to the number of
people who have business on
campus, and especially
proportional to those who live
more than walking or biking
distance away (57 percent?).
Since the 1957 survey which
Peter Carpenter alludes to in one
part of his proposal, the number
of square Teet of building space on
campus lias probably doubled
(and many of the new buildings
are located in former parking
lots). Bigger things bring more
people, and more people simply
means more cars.
Building Density
Reducing the number of
parking spaces along with
increasing the building density has
created a situation with
logarithmic implications. These
effects are currently visible, and
there are many new buildings on
the drawing boards, and there will
be many more to come.
Restricting vehicular traffic or
banning it entirely (which appears
to be the direction in which we
are headed) will exacerbate, not
contribute to solving the problem.
If the number of cars is
directly proportional to the
number of persons, it is clear that
the banning of automobiles will
leave 57 percent, who have very
little choice about driving to
work, with some very hard
decisions. And the University's
welfare is greatly dependent upon
those whose lives will be affected.
Stanford is not Yale or Cal,
and to hold them up as models is
unfair. Stanford has so much land
it is "land poor," and to seek
solutions to questionable previous
land decisions by banning the
automobile will be a mistake.
Before we become inexorably
embroiled in a slow process of
strangulation, when will the
proper persons begin to ask the
question "Whose interest is really
served by the current approach to
planning?"
