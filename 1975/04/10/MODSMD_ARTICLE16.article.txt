# Rosenbaum Slate: Actions Louder Than Words
## Chris Gray 
### 
It is ASSU election time again
and talk is cheap. As always most
of the slates divide their time
between pushing the latest
student service and making
promises they can't keep on
things like tuition,
SWOPSI/SCIRE and tenure.
Of the two major slates only
one has avoided the shallow
perspective that marks nine out of
10 ASSU Council of Presidents
aspirants. And only one has the
past record to back up the
promises it has made.
This is the Lee Rosenbaum
ticket. The only other serious

slate, the Kevin McDermott slate,
has constructed the typical
Council of Presidents campaign
out of unneeded student services
and vague promises.
It is distressing to see another
student-services slate like Mike
Herman's rear its head so close to
the end of the present
unproductive Council of
Presidents. It is even more
distressing to find the latest
student-service slate lacks what
few redeeming features Mike
Herman and his co-presidents had.
At least they understood some of
the nuts and bolts of the ASSU

programs.
You would not find Herman
proposing a teacher evaluation
reform and not mentioning the
Course Review at all. Or, in the
same proposal, promising (as a
"long-range goal," of course) to
work for a student on the
Appointments and Promotions
Committee which only affects the
School of Humanities and is only
one level of the tenure process in
that school anyway. At least
Herman's slate did deeper
research than just reading the
Daily.
But the worst thing of all is to
see this slate make promises about
preserving innovative education. It
is led by the most reactionary
undergraduate ASSU senator
(who is ashamed to reveal on his
literature that he is the Delt house
president), and it includes as its
other three members an ASSU
bureaucrat and two former Daily
staffers.
It is impossible to believe that
the McDermott slate can really
defend the innovative programs. It is
impossible to believe that they
would even know how to go
about trying.
It should be obvious looking
over this past year, that when the
ASSU goes hat in hand to the
Administration they always come
back with the same thing, an
empty hat
Only by organizing students
and taking real actions can the
Administration be made to listen.
This is what the members of the
Rosenbaum slate have done in the
past and this is what they will do
even more effectively in the
future.
People like Dave Galligan and
Charlotte Germane don't just talk
about innovative education —
they teach SWOPSI classes. And
they don't just talk about
"working" for student control of
innovative programs — they
fought to save them.
All of the Rosenbaum slate
took part in the Save
SWOPSI/SCIRE campaign, and
Galligan was one of the
organizers.

It is the same with the
minority financial aid issue. All of
the slate took part in the struggle
(still far from over) to maintain a
decent aid package for poor
minority students, and Josie
Jaramillo was one of the Students
for Equity leaders.
Neither of these are dead
issues. And there are many more
important areas where a great deal
can be accomplished if there is
strong leadership that does more
than just talk. It is time that the

ASSU became more than just a
glorified student service. It is time
that the Council of Presidents
became more than just an easy
ticket to law school.
If the ASSU is not going to
really represent and lead the
students in defense of their
interests and rights then it is not
worth having. There is only one
slate that can do this. There is
only one slate worth voting for.
That is Rosenbaum's.

Committee which only affects the
School of Humanities and is only
one level of the tenure process in
that school anyway. At least
Herman's slate did deeper
research than just reading the
Daily.
But the worst thing of all is to
see this slate make promises about
preserving innovative education. It
is led by the most reactionary
undergraduate ASSU senator
(who is ashamed to reveal on his
literature that he is the Delt house
president), and it includes as its
other three members an ASSU
bureaucrat and two former Daily
staffers.
It is impossible to believe that
the McDermott slate can really
defend the innovative programs. It is
impossible to believe that they
would even know how to go
about trying.
It should be obvious looking
over this past year, that when the
ASSU goes hat in hand to the
Administration they always come
back with the same thing, an
empty hat
Only by organizing students
and taking real actions can the
Administration be made to listen.
This is what the members of the
Rosenbaum slate have done in the
past and this is what they will do
even more effectively in the
future.
People like Dave Galligan and
Charlotte Germane don't just talk
about innovative education —
they teach SWOPSI classes. And
they don't just talk about
"working" for student control of
innovative programs — they
fought to save them.
All of the Rosenbaum slate
took part in the Save
SWOPSI/SCIRE campaign, and
Galligan was one of the
organizers.

It is the same with the
minority financial aid issue. All of
the slate took part in the struggle
(still far from over) to maintain a
decent aid package for poor
minority students, and Josie
Jaramillo was one of the Students
for Equity leaders.
Neither of these are dead
issues. And there are many more
important areas where a great deal
can be accomplished if there is
strong leadership that does more
than just talk. It is time that the

ASSU became more than just a
glorified student service. It is time
that the Council of Presidents
became more than just an easy
ticket to law school.
If the ASSU is not going to
really represent and lead the
students in defense of their
interests and rights then it is not
worth having. There is only one
slate that can do this. There is
only one slate worth voting for.
That is Rosenbaum's.
(Chris Gray is a senior
inderdepartmental major.)
It is ASSU election time again
and talk is cheap. As always most
of the slates divide their time
between pushing the latest
student service and making
promises they can't keep on
things like tuition,
SWOPSI/SCIRE and tenure.
Of the two major slates only
one has avoided the shallow
perspective that marks nine out of
10 ASSU Council of Presidents
aspirants. And only one has the
past record to back up the
promises it has made.
This is the Lee Rosenbaum
ticket. The only other serious

slate, the Kevin McDermott slate,
has constructed the typical
Council of Presidents campaign
out of unneeded student services
and vague promises.
It is distressing to see another
student-services slate like Mike
Herman's rear its head so close to
the end of the present
unproductive Council of
Presidents. It is even more
distressing to find the latest
student-service slate lacks what
few redeeming features Mike
Herman and his co-presidents had.
At least they understood some of
the nuts and bolts of the ASSU

programs.
You would not find Herman
proposing a teacher evaluation
reform and not mentioning the
Course Review at all. Or, in the
same proposal, promising (as a
"long-range goal," of course) to
work for a student on the
Appointments and Promotions
Committee which only affects the
School of Humanities and is only
one level of the tenure process in
that school anyway. At least
