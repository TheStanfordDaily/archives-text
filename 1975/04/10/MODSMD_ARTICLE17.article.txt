# Vote Yes On PIRG
## Ralph Nader 
### 
I'm writing to urge your
support for the Northern
California Public Interest
Research Group (NorCal PIRG) in
its upcoming referendum. NorCal
PIRG is one of more than 20
student funded and directed
organizations throughout the
country.
Our Citizen Action Group,
which regularly communicates
with NorCal PIRG, has kept me
abreast of this group's
accomplishments, including:
— its investigation of deceptive
gas mileage claims among auto
dealers and its subsequent
testimony before the Federal
Trade Commission;
— its recent exposure of banks
and car dealerships which were
found violating the Federal
Truth-In-Lending Law;
— its support of the California
Nuclear Safeguards Initiative; and
— its close cooperation with
state and federal authorities on
other consumer issues.
Vote Approaching
I understand from Stanford
Co-Chairpersons Jeff Kimball and
Ann Lowery that Stanford
students will vote this April on
whether or not to continue their
support for the group.
For years I have urged students

to create their own independent
social-action groups at a state or
regional level. Through PIRG,
students obtain first-hand
experience in social research and
advocacy.
Their own professional
advocates, researchers and
organizers provide the expertise
and full-time representation
students need to achieve real
change. Northern California,
although getting a later start than
some states, has proven itself as a
small but aggressive advocate for
the public interest.
Student Based
However, unless NorCal PIRG
is able to maintain and
substantially expand its student
base, it cannot attain the critical
mass of support needed
throughout the state to become a
vital civic force.
If you share my belief that
NorCal PIRG is an effective and
essential organization, deserving
of the student support it has thus
I far received, I urge the support of
1 students in continuing Staniord's
I leadership in this important
i effort
