## Ted Marcy—NCAA Gymnast, Frat Man, Pre-Med—Adds New Stunts To Routine 
### GEORGE ANDERS 
Flitting from the high bar to
the floor exercise mat,
Ail-American gymnast Ted Marcy
takes a leisurely workout at
Encina gym. Marcy, strictly a
pommel horse man during
Stanford's gymnastics meets, just
capped his season by winning the
NCAA title in that event last
weekend at Indiana State.
Now, on unfamiliar equipment,
his usual grace and precision are
missing. Once, on the floormat, he
slips and falls on his back. But
despite the frustrations, for Marcy
this post-season "practice" is, in
its own way, also a highlight of
the season.

That's just one of many
examples of how different Marcy
is from the stereotype of a gifted
athlete — the prima donna
interested in only his own
speciality.
During competition, Marcy has
always taken a more selfless
approach. This year, instead of
repeating the routines that won
him the NCAA pommel horse title
last year (when he was only a
sophomore), Marcy chose to add
new, more difficult stunts.
He's also become less
competitive. "I'm not so
concerned about winning," he
said, "just about doing the routine
right. I used to worry about

whether I'd fall off, or how the
other guy would do. But it just
isn't worth worrying about that
kind of stuff."
More Relaxed
By being more relaxed, Marcy
notes that "I've enjoyed
gymnastics a lot more. In other
years, I used to say 'Ah, I don't
want to go to practice today.'
Now, I look forward to practice."
These practices are the key to
Marcy's success, teammates say.
"Ted does have a really good
body for gymnastics," all-around
man Leo Hollberg notes. "His
weight and size of limbs are just
right. But those are small factors,
compared to the intensity and

amount of effort he puts in."
Hollberg marvels at Marcy's three
hour workouts, nearly 365 days a
year.
Second Coach
Even during practice, Marcy
doesn't consider himself separate
from the team. Hollberg notes
that "It's a great help to be able
to work out with someone of
Ted's caliber. Not just to watch
him, but also because he'll point
out something in your routine
that needs correcting, and then
it'll become so much clearer when
he demonstrates it."
Underclassmen on the team have
said that Marcy is like a "second
coach" to them for their pommel
horse work.
Ted Marcy's life does not stop
when he executes one of his crisp
dismounts from the pommel horse
though. His post-college plans
center around getting into medical
school. Marcy, a human bio
major, would like to become a
general practitioner, explaining
"I'd much rather treat a person
than just an eye or a lung.
"I'm planning to devote my
life to something other than
gymnastics," he said. "There's a
time and place for gymnastics,
and that's at college, but there's
more to life than that."
Marcy spoke of a period when
gymnastics and his pre^med
studies took up all his time. "I'd
wake up, go to class, go to
practice, go to the library, and go
to bed."
This year though, he has found
time for other activities, including
being vice president of his
fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Considering the quality of

Marcy's gymnastics performances,
the next target would seem to be
international competition, maybe
even the Olympics. But they are
open only to individuals
competing in the all-around.
Specialists are shut out from
international competition.
"Occasionally I get this
temptation to try to develop
routines on other apparatus,"
Marcy remarked. "There's a
chance I might be able to pick up
a few, maybe for next season."
But even though he goes through
stunts on all the equipment,
Marcy remains realistic. "There's
no way I could learn to do all of
them," he said.
He seems to be fairly definite
about the limits on how far he can
diversify in gymnastics. But so far,
he's done a remarkable job of
developing different talents at the
same time. And who knows,
maybe next season Ted Marcy will
be tumbling and flipping his way
to high scores in the floor
exercise.

him the NCAA pommel horse title
last year (when he was only a
sophomore), Marcy chose to add
new, more difficult stunts.
He's also become less
competitive. "I'm not so
concerned about winning," he
said, "just about doing the routine
right. I used to worry about

whether I'd fall off, or how the
other guy would do. But it just
isn't worth worrying about that
kind of stuff."
More Relaxed
By being more relaxed, Marcy
notes that "I've enjoyed
gymnastics a lot more. In other
years, I used to say 'Ah, I don't
want to go to practice today.'
Now, I look forward to practice."
These practices are the key to
Marcy's success, teammates say.
"Ted does have a really good
body for gymnastics," all-around
man Leo Hollberg notes. "His
weight and size of limbs are just
right. But those are small factors,
compared to the intensity and

amount of effort he puts in."
Hollberg marvels at Marcy's three
hour workouts, nearly 365 days a
year.
Second Coach
Even during practice, Marcy
doesn't consider himself separate
from the team. Hollberg notes
that "It's a great help to be able
to work out with someone of
Ted's caliber. Not just to watch
him, but also because he'll point
out something in your routine
that needs correcting, and then
it'll become so much clearer when
he demonstrates it."
Underclassmen on the team have
said that Marcy is like a "second
coach" to them for their pommel
horse work.
Ted Marcy's life does not stop
when he executes one of his crisp
dismounts from the pommel horse
though. His post-college plans
center around getting into medical
school. Marcy, a human bio
major, would like to become a
general practitioner, explaining
"I'd much rather treat a person
than just an eye or a lung.
"I'm planning to devote my
life to something other than
gymnastics," he said. "There's a
time and place for gymnastics,
and that's at college, but there's
more to life than that."
Marcy spoke of a period when
gymnastics and his pre^med
studies took up all his time. "I'd
wake up, go to class, go to
practice, go to the library, and go
to bed."
This year though, he has found
time for other activities, including
being vice president of his
fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Considering the quality of

Marcy's gymnastics performances,
the next target would seem to be
international competition, maybe
even the Olympics. But they are
open only to individuals
competing in the all-around.
Specialists are shut out from
international competition.
"Occasionally I get this
temptation to try to develop
routines on other apparatus,"
Marcy remarked. "There's a
chance I might be able to pick up
a few, maybe for next season."
But even though he goes through
stunts on all the equipment,
Marcy remains realistic. "There's
no way I could learn to do all of
them," he said.
He seems to be fairly definite
about the limits on how far he can
diversify in gymnastics. But so far,
he's done a remarkable job of
developing different talents at the
same time. And who knows,
maybe next season Ted Marcy will
be tumbling and flipping his way
to high scores in the floor
exercise.

Flitting from the high bar to
the floor exercise mat,
Ail-American gymnast Ted Marcy
takes a leisurely workout at
Encina gym. Marcy, strictly a
pommel horse man during
Stanford's gymnastics meets, just
capped his season by winning the
NCAA title in that event last
weekend at Indiana State.
Now, on unfamiliar equipment,
his usual grace and precision are
missing. Once, on the floormat, he
slips and falls on his back. But
despite the frustrations, for Marcy
this post-season "practice" is, in
its own way, also a highlight of
the season.

That's just one of many
examples of how different Marcy
is from the stereotype of a gifted
athlete — the prima donna
interested in only his own
speciality.
During competition, Marcy has
always taken a more selfless
approach. This year, instead of
