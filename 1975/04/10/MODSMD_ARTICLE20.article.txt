Why is it that the Stanford
bcrossc team receives no coverage
in the sports section of the Daily?
The games are not announced,
there are no articles about the
games, no photographs of the
action and no reporting of scores.

Lacrosse is not covered on the
sports page for several reasons,
according to Sports Editor Ron
Beck. First, he said, lacrosse is a
club sport and therefore not
publicized by the Sports
Information Office. This means
that the Daily has trouble finding
out about the games, without
assigning a fulltime reporter to
cover only lacrosse. While
members of the lacrosse team will
occasionally call the Daily to
report times of individual games,
the sports department has no
complete schedule. Beck said that
he would be willing to announce
both times and results of lacrosse
games, if someone on the team
will provide a schedule and
consistently inform the sports
page of results.
The sports page has limited
space and countless sports to
cover. Consequently, some sports

have to be left out. "It's our job
to report according to attention
that's placed on something
already," Beck said. "It's not our
job to stir up publicity."
However, next week there will be
several photos of lacrosse games
and hopefully some stories in the
future. Beck admitted that the
sports department has had
problems with one reporter
assigned to cover lacrosse. He has
yet to submit a single story.

Can you tell me something about
the cows on the Stanford
foothills? —A.S.
The land in the foothills is
leased by Manuel Piers and Bob
'Knudson. Piers, the owner of Piers
Dairy Products in Palo Alto, leases
the land and owns the cows
behind Junipero Serra road.
Roger Piers, Manuel's son, said
that there are eight bulls in the
foothills, out that they are not
dangerous unless someone tries to
push them or brings a dog around
them. He added that a cow with a
young calf is probably more
dangerous than a bull.
No one — including students —
is allowed on the land for
recreational use. However,
biology, geology and zoology
classes can receive special
permission to use the land from
the owners.

Why arc the questions in "Bug
Me" so boring lately? —J.K.
Frankly, "Bug Me" 's demise is
the fault of its readers. Contrary
to popular myth, most "Bug Me"
questions are not created by the
inventive minds of Daily staffers.
Lately, we have received almost
no questions, perhaps because of
finals. So if you long for
muckraking, hard-nosed answers
to tough questions, call 497-4632
and ask some of those questions.

Can you tell me something about
the cows on the Stanford
foothills? —A.S.
The land in the foothills is
leased by Manuel Piers and Bob
'Knudson. Piers, the owner of Piers
Dairy Products in Palo Alto, leases
the land and owns the cows
behind Junipero Serra road.
Roger Piers, Manuel's son, said
that there are eight bulls in the
foothills, out that they are not
dangerous unless someone tries to
push them or brings a dog around
them. He added that a cow with a
young calf is probably more
dangerous than a bull.
No one — including students —
is allowed on the land for
recreational use. However,
biology, geology and zoology
classes can receive special
permission to use the land from
the owners.

Why arc the questions in "Bug
Me" so boring lately? —J.K.
Frankly, "Bug Me" 's demise is
the fault of its readers. Contrary
to popular myth, most "Bug Me"
questions are not created by the
inventive minds of Daily staffers.
Lately, we have received almost
no questions, perhaps because of
finals. So if you long for
muckraking, hard-nosed answers
to tough questions, call 497-4632
and ask some of those questions.

Why is it that the Stanford
bcrossc team receives no coverage
in the sports section of the Daily?
The games are not announced,
there are no articles about the
games, no photographs of the
action and no reporting of scores.
-T.O.
Lacrosse is not covered on the
sports page for several reasons,
according to Sports Editor Ron
Beck. First, he said, lacrosse is a
club sport and therefore not
publicized by the Sports
Information Office. This means
that the Daily has trouble finding
out about the games, without
assigning a fulltime reporter to
cover only lacrosse. While
members of the lacrosse team will
occasionally call the Daily to
report times of individual games,
the sports department has no
complete schedule. Beck said that
he would be willing to announce
both times and results of lacrosse
games, if someone on the team
will provide a schedule and
consistently inform the sports
page of results.
The sports page has limited
space and countless sports to
cover. Consequently, some sports

have to be left out. "It's our job
to report according to attention
that's placed on something
already," Beck said. "It's not our
job to stir up publicity."
However, next week there will be
several photos of lacrosse games
and hopefully some stories in the
future. Beck admitted that the
sports department has had
problems with one reporter
assigned to cover lacrosse. He has
yet to submit a single story.
