## Anti-Americanism Hits Cambodia

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
(AP) — "The Americans appear to
be great humanitarians. They give
temporary aid, but ultimately
they think only of themselves,"
the former government minister
said. "We in Cambodia have been
seduced and abandoned."
Resentment against the United
States is mounting among Phnom
Penh's political elite. It is being
stoked by a growing feeling that
the U.S. Congress will turn down
further military aid to Cambodia
and that its delay on the vote is a
parting act of cruelty.
The domino theory is not a
debating point here in higher
political circles. It is accepted as
an undeniable law.
Government leaders insist that
if the United States deserts
Cambodia, all of Southeast Asia
will go Communist. They argue
U.S. honor will be spoiled and
Asian allies may well side with the
Communist regime in China
rather than believe the bankrupt
word of the Americans.
But there is little evidence of
anti-Americanism among those
who do not hear the latest news
from Washington. Frontline
soldiers and Phnom Penh's average
citizens say they cannot believe
there may soon be no American
bullets for their rifles or rice for
thier bowls.
Americans are regarded as
being on "their side"; such
loyalties are simply not severed in
their insular world.
"I don't think America will let
us die," one young soldier on
Phnom Penh's southern defense
line says.
Among Phnom Penh's major
groups, only the students have
called for an end to U.S. aid,
saying it prolongs the agony of
war.
Unlike South Vietnam, where
an undercurrent of
anti-Americanism has existed for
years, there have been no overt
acts of hostility reported against
Americans in areas of Cambodia
still controlled by the

government.
Many government leaders see
American policy in Cambodia as
oddly ineffective and any U.S.
withdrawal of aid as pure
betrayal. A composite attitude
gathered from numerous
interviews runs this way:
—The United States supported
the overthrow of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, and its troops invaded
the country in 1970 to protect
U.S. soldiers and hasten their
withdrawal from South Vietnam.

The United States also bound
itself to the Phnom Penh
government through vast
monetary aid and — until August
1973 — by air support.
—Americans have obviously
interfered in internal Cambodian
affairs, but they failed to exert
the pressure needed to force out
useless and corrupt generals and
inert leaders, including President
Lon Nol. By their almost
schizophrenic approach, the
Americans are in large part

responsible for the near collapse
of the Phnom Penh government.
Cabinet ministers, legislators
and former officials insist that
with more aid an energetic
government could be generated
and peace concluded through a
formula of military strength and
willingness to negotiate. Their
solutions, however, are vague,
almost fanciful, as are their
explanations why five years of
such aid has produced only
military and political failure.
