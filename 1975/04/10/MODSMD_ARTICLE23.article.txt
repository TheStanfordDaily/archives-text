# Students Live Voluntarily Off Campus, Report Discloses
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Roughly half the
undergraduates who live off
campus do so voluntarily and
enjoy it, according to a report
released last month by the Dean
of Student Affairs Office.
"The specter of a large body of
unhappy and embittered
commuters, inconveniently,
inadequately but expensively
housed, is often raised to haunt
us," the report explained. "The
present study suggests that sGch a
picture is grossly overdrawn."
Authored primarily by John D.
Black, director of research for the
Dean of Students Affairs Office,
the report emerged from data
compiled by Black, Chief
Psychometrist Julia Ferris of the
Student Health Service and
graduate intern Betty C. Chang.
The three sent questionnaires to
all the undergraduates living off
campus last quarter, and just over
half were returned.
The survey asked students why
they lived off campus, and to
identify positive and negative
aspects of off-campus living. Black
expressed surprise that "the level
of discontent among commuters
was lower than we anticipated."
'Built-in Bias'
He admitted that mailed
surveys had a "built-in bias,"
because only certain types of
students would answer them. But
he pointed out "the returns were
very substantial, percentagewise."
Black added that he had expected
a bias "in favor of the
malcontents."
Based on the data collected in
the survey, Black, Ferris and
Chang made several long- and
short-range recommendations.
Their report suggested that the

University purchase "one or more
apartment buildings in the vicinity
of campus | within three miles |
which could be rented to
students." The report noted that
the cost would probably be less
than that of building new
dormitories, although admitting
that "some flak would probably
be generated" by such a policy
change.
Inadequately Informed
Some 68 percent of those
surveyed indicated they were "not
adequately informed about the
housing shortage" before deciding
to enroll. Therefore, the report
recommends that literature sent
to prospective students should
clearly indicate their chances of
being forced off campus for at
least one year.
The report also endorsed the
proposal to guarantee transfer
students on-campus housing their
first year and to allow students to
choose the year they will live off

campus. The Board of Trustees
has since adopted both proposals.
The tfroup further urged "early
fruition" of plans for an
on-campus lounge (now in
Tresidder Memorial Union, second
floor) and other activities for
off-campus students, and
improved transportation to Palo
Alto and Menlo Park. About
two-thirds of the undergraduates
living off campus live in these two
areas.
The report finally
recommended academic
departments establish study areas
for students, that greater emphasis
be placed on developing
capabilities to help students find
off-campus housing, that the
ASSU rent equipment other than
refrigerators to students and that
commuters with University meal
plans be invited to participate in
dorm activities.
Roughly half the
undergraduates who live off
campus do so voluntarily and
enjoy it, according to a report
released last month by the Dean
of Student Affairs Office.

campus. The Board of Trustees
has since adopted both proposals.
The tfroup further urged "early
fruition" of plans for an
on-campus lounge (now in
Tresidder Memorial Union, second
floor) and other activities for
off-campus students, and
improved transportation to Palo
Alto and Menlo Park. About
two-thirds of the undergraduates
living off campus live in these two
areas.
The report finally
recommended academic
departments establish study areas
for students, that greater emphasis
be placed on developing
capabilities to help students find
off-campus housing, that the
ASSU rent equipment other than
refrigerators to students and that
commuters with University meal
plans be invited to participate in
dorm activities.
Roughly half the
undergraduates who live off
campus do so voluntarily and
enjoy it, according to a report
released last month by the Dean
of Student Affairs Office.
"The specter of a large body of
unhappy and embittered
commuters, inconveniently,
inadequately but expensively
housed, is often raised to haunt
us," the report explained. "The
present study suggests that sGch a
picture is grossly overdrawn."
Authored primarily by John D.
Black, director of research for the
Dean of Students Affairs Office,
the report emerged from data
compiled by Black, Chief
Psychometrist Julia Ferris of the
Student Health Service and
graduate intern Betty C. Chang.
The three sent questionnaires to
all the undergraduates living off
campus last quarter, and just over
half were returned.
The survey asked students why
they lived off campus, and to
identify positive and negative
aspects of off-campus living. Black
expressed surprise that "the level
of discontent among commuters
was lower than we anticipated."
'Built-in Bias'
He admitted that mailed
surveys had a "built-in bias,"
because only certain types of
students would answer them. But
he pointed out "the returns were
very substantial, percentagewise."
Black added that he had expected
a bias "in favor of the
malcontents."
Based on the data collected in
the survey, Black, Ferris and
Chang made several long- and
short-range recommendations.
Their report suggested that the

University purchase "one or more
apartment buildings in the vicinity
of campus | within three miles |
which could be rented to
students." The report noted that
the cost would probably be less
than that of building new
dormitories, although admitting
that "some flak would probably
be generated" by such a policy
change.
Inadequately Informed
Some 68 percent of those
surveyed indicated they were "not
adequately informed about the
housing shortage" before deciding
to enroll. Therefore, the report
recommends that literature sent
to prospective students should
clearly indicate their chances of
being forced off campus for at
least one year.
The report also endorsed the
proposal to guarantee transfer
students on-campus housing their
first year and to allow students to
choose the year they will live off

campus. The Board of Trustees
has since adopted both proposals.
