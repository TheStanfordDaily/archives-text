# Law Applications Down

### MARTHA ADAMS 
"Law school applications this
year generally are on the decline
nationally — the apparent result
of a shortage of jobs and money,"
says a March issue of the Boston
Evening Globe. And Stanford has
felt the effect.
Applications last year
numbered 3165, and the expected
number for this year is "about
2800," according to William
Keogh, dean of admissions at the
Stanford Law School.
One reason for the trend is
"publicity," he said. Possible
applicants are being discouraged
by talk of tight job markets. For

example, the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics reports that the
number of graduates each year is
roughly double the number of
available legal positions in this
country, he said.
Another reason for the decline
in applications may be the
University's "publication of the
so-called grid," according to
Keogh. The grid is a chart that
shows the CPA and LSAT scores
of people who applied to Stanford
and of people who were accepted.
Keogh also pointed to the
lagging economy as a reason for
the decline in law school
applications.
