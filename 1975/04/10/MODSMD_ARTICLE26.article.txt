# Best Bets
## 
### 
This week's best bet undoubtedly
occurs at Stanford. It is called the
Aquafollies. For the second year in a row,
the event, held on Lake Lagunita, will
present all kinds of ski shows and frolics.
Also featured will be a "surprise faculty
event," which, our sources say, will be a
water dunking contest. Wouldn't you be

willing to pay money to "honor" certain
notables? Best of all, the money goes to
the Optacon fund to aid the blind. See
you Sunday.
If you prefer indoor entertainment, we
recommend Sammy Davis Jr. at the Circle
Star Theatre through next Wednesday.
Admittedly, "Candy Man" and similar
songs are sickening, but Davis does a
superior job on numbers like "What Kind
of Fool Am I" and"I Gotta Be Me." And
he is a fine showman.
For an evening of fine dancing, try the
Louis Falco Dance Company on Thursday
and Friday in Memorial Auditorium. The
troupe, presented by the Office of Public
Events, features "choreography built
upon an intimate understanding of his
(Falco's) human raw materials, their
personalities and temperaments so that
each role is tailor-made for each dancer,"
according to a press release. The release
adds that Falco's is a "modern, hip
company dancing to the live rock music

of the Vertical Burn."
Live drama can also be seen on campus
this week. The Drama Department is
presenting three one-act plays under the
heading, Catch-3 in room 205 of
Memorial Auditorium. And Catch-3 has
no catches because admission is free.
If you can venture off campus, the
musical presentation by the Saratoga
Drama Group, Sugar, based on "Some
Like It Hot," appears promising. So does
Bill Graham's presentation at Berkeley of
Gordon Lightfoot tonight (and we hope
he'll be lively as opposed to the human
jukebox he was at Stanford last year), and
Don McLean and Lori Lieberman on
Sunday. Also, tonight, former Israeli
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan will speak
at the College of Marin.
On campus, as part of international
women's week, authoress Erica Jong will
speak tonight in Cubberley Auditorium at
8 p.m. Jong's most recent book is the
national best seller, "Fear of Flying."
We realize that movies are often the
primary area of your interest; this week,
the better variety of films is on campus.
The Ingmar Bergman festival presents A
Lesson In Love (1954), a "light, erotic
comedy about a gynecologist's affairs of
the heart," according to a release. (Dr.
Kinsey, are you listening?)
The Stanford Film Society screens
Faces, directed by John Cassavetes and
starring Gena Rowlands, and the ASSU
Sunday Flicks presents 2001: A Space
Odyssey. (It is rumored around the Daily
editorial board that the title signifies the
number of times this film has been shown
on campus. You should, however, see it at
least once.)
We have saved sports for last. Although
varsity baseball and tennis contests are
away, Stanford does play Berkeley here in
golf and Spring Football practice begins
Saturday morning on the field behind
Maples Pavilion. (Special good luck wishes
go to Guy Benjamin, Mike Cordova, Steve
Dils and Jerry Waldvogel, Stanford's four
quarterbacks.)

If you can venture off campus, the
musical presentation by the Saratoga
Drama Group, Sugar, based on "Some
Like It Hot," appears promising. So does
Bill Graham's presentation at Berkeley of
Gordon Lightfoot tonight (and we hope
he'll be lively as opposed to the human
jukebox he was at Stanford last year), and
Don McLean and Lori Lieberman on
Sunday. Also, tonight, former Israeli
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan will speak
at the College of Marin.
On campus, as part of international
women's week, authoress Erica Jong will
speak tonight in Cubberley Auditorium at
8 p.m. Jong's most recent book is the
national best seller, "Fear of Flying."
We realize that movies are often the
primary area of your interest; this week,
the better variety of films is on campus.
The Ingmar Bergman festival presents A
Lesson In Love (1954), a "light, erotic
comedy about a gynecologist's affairs of
the heart," according to a release. (Dr.
Kinsey, are you listening?)
The Stanford Film Society screens
Faces, directed by John Cassavetes and
starring Gena Rowlands, and the ASSU
Sunday Flicks presents 2001: A Space
Odyssey. (It is rumored around the Daily
editorial board that the title signifies the
number of times this film has been shown
on campus. You should, however, see it at
least once.)
We have saved sports for last. Although
varsity baseball and tennis contests are
away, Stanford does play Berkeley here in
golf and Spring Football practice begins
Saturday morning on the field behind
Maples Pavilion. (Special good luck wishes
go to Guy Benjamin, Mike Cordova, Steve
Dils and Jerry Waldvogel, Stanford's four
quarterbacks.)

This week's best bet undoubtedly
occurs at Stanford. It is called the
Aquafollies. For the second year in a row,
the event, held on Lake Lagunita, will
present all kinds of ski shows and frolics.
Also featured will be a "surprise faculty
event," which, our sources say, will be a
water dunking contest. Wouldn't you be

willing to pay money to "honor" certain
notables? Best of all, the money goes to
the Optacon fund to aid the blind. See
you Sunday.
If you prefer indoor entertainment, we
recommend Sammy Davis Jr. at the Circle
Star Theatre through next Wednesday.
Admittedly, "Candy Man" and similar
songs are sickening, but Davis does a
superior job on numbers like "What Kind
of Fool Am I" and"I Gotta Be Me." And
he is a fine showman.
For an evening of fine dancing, try the
Louis Falco Dance Company on Thursday
and Friday in Memorial Auditorium. The
troupe, presented by the Office of Public
Events, features "choreography built
upon an intimate understanding of his
(Falco's) human raw materials, their
personalities and temperaments so that
each role is tailor-made for each dancer,"
according to a press release. The release
adds that Falco's is a "modern, hip
company dancing to the live rock music

of the Vertical Burn."
Live drama can also be seen on campus
this week. The Drama Department is
presenting three one-act plays under the
heading, Catch-3 in room 205 of
Memorial Auditorium. And Catch-3 has
no catches because admission is free.
