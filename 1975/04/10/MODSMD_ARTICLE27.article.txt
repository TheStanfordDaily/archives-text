Prestige P-10089
Jazz musicians as young as
Patrice Rushen and Azar
Lawrence rarely get a chance to
make an album under their own
name, but with the help of some
exceptional sidemen, Rushen and
Lawrence have put together two
impressive debut albums.
Although he is in his early
twenties, Lawrence has been
heard extensively as a member of
pianist McCoy Tyner's
outstanding quintet, notably on
the albums Enlightenment and
Sama Layuca.
From those performances and

Bridge into the New Age,
Lawrence has emerged as one of
the most important members of
what might be called the
"post-post-Trane" group of
saxophonists. His playing shows
the influence not only of Coltrane
but also of those that have
followed, musicians like Pharaoh
Sanders and especially Tyner.
Lawrence's compositions, like
the title cut and "Warriors of
Peace," are an extension of the
African-sounding modal music
favored by Tyner.
On Bridge, despite the absence
of a soloist as moving as Tyner,
these pieces have a savage impact
that stems from Lawrence's tenor
saxophone shrieks and a rhythm
section (including, on some
tracks, Clint Houston on bass,
drummers Billy Hart and Ndugu

and percussionists Mtume and
Kenneth Nash) whose playing
owes more to African music than
to mainstream jazz.
There are other fine soloists as
well, including two of the Bay
Area's foremost jazzmen, flutist
Hadley Caliman (who has played
with Malo and Eddie Henderson)
and trombonist Julian Priester
(once with Herbie Hancock's
sextet).
Indeed, the high quality of
musicianship from every soloist
on this album — especially vocalist
Jean Cam, one of the few
listenable jazz singers around —
shows that the 16 players who
appear on this record are capable
of producing some fine music by
following the innovations of
Coltrane and Tyner.
Lawrence, perhaps, possesses

the most promise of anyone here;
since Bridge is one of the finest,
"first albums" in recent years;*
When he takes the inevitable step
and forms his own band, I hopes
he'll include pianist Joe Bonner:ij
the lovely intermingling sounds
from Lawrence's tenor and
Bonner's piano make "Fatisha",'
the most moving track on Bridge
and a beautiful echo of the sounds
Trane and Tyner used to makq,
together. *
There is less to say abouC
Prelusion, a set that seems*
impossibly professional
considering that Rushen is only
20 years old. Two things stand
out concerning Prelusion: first, it
shows the great musical debt.
Rushen owes to Herbie Hancock*
and second, it provides morfft
evidence that Joe Henderson (!#"
has two solos here) is a superb
tenor saxophonist.
Rushen's compositions,
especially "Shortie's Portion" and
"Haw-Right Now" and her
arrangements on them resemble.,
Hancock's music of his late*-
records for Blue Note. As a
pianist, too, Rushen plays a lot
like Hancock used to, and that
means with quite a bit more flair
than Hancock has shown recently.
Rushen also plays some electric
keyboard instruments, including
an ARP synthesizer (on "Puttered
Bopcom") that sounds as if it was
last used in a Lipton Tea
commercial. Nevertheless,
"Bopcom," like the rest of the
album, is a very relaxing piece of
music

Jazz musicians as young as
Patrice Rushen and Azar
Lawrence rarely get a chance to
make an album under their own
name, but with the help of some
exceptional sidemen, Rushen and
Lawrence have put together two
impressive debut albums.
Although he is in his early
twenties, Lawrence has been
heard extensively as a member of
pianist McCoy Tyner's
outstanding quintet, notably on
the albums Enlightenment and
Sama Layuca.
From those performances and

Bridge into the New Age,
Lawrence has emerged as one of
the most important members of
what might be called the
"post-post-Trane" group of
saxophonists. His playing shows
the influence not only of Coltrane
but also of those that have
followed, musicians like Pharaoh
Sanders and especially Tyner.
Lawrence's compositions, like
the title cut and "Warriors of
Peace," are an extension of the
African-sounding modal music
favored by Tyner.
On Bridge, despite the absence
of a soloist as moving as Tyner,
these pieces have a savage impact
that stems from Lawrence's tenor
saxophone shrieks and a rhythm
section (including, on some
tracks, Clint Houston on bass,
drummers Billy Hart and Ndugu

and percussionists Mtume and
Kenneth Nash) whose playing
owes more to African music than
to mainstream jazz.
There are other fine soloists as
well, including two of the Bay
Area's foremost jazzmen, flutist
Hadley Caliman (who has played
with Malo and Eddie Henderson)
and trombonist Julian Priester
(once with Herbie Hancock's
sextet).
Indeed, the high quality of
musicianship from every soloist
on this album — especially vocalist
Jean Cam, one of the few
listenable jazz singers around —
shows that the 16 players who
appear on this record are capable
of producing some fine music by
following the innovations of
Coltrane and Tyner.
Lawrence, perhaps, possesses

the most promise of anyone here;
since Bridge is one of the finest,
"first albums" in recent years;*
When he takes the inevitable step
and forms his own band, I hopes
he'll include pianist Joe Bonner:ij
the lovely intermingling sounds
from Lawrence's tenor and
Bonner's piano make "Fatisha",'
the most moving track on Bridge
and a beautiful echo of the sounds
Trane and Tyner used to makq,
together. *
There is less to say abouC
Prelusion, a set that seems*
impossibly professional
considering that Rushen is only
20 years old. Two things stand
out concerning Prelusion: first, it
shows the great musical debt.
Rushen owes to Herbie Hancock*
and second, it provides morfft
evidence that Joe Henderson (!#"
has two solos here) is a superb
tenor saxophonist.
Rushen's compositions,
especially "Shortie's Portion" and
"Haw-Right Now" and her
arrangements on them resemble.,
Hancock's music of his late*-
records for Blue Note. As a
pianist, too, Rushen plays a lot
like Hancock used to, and that
means with quite a bit more flair
than Hancock has shown recently.
Rushen also plays some electric
keyboard instruments, including
an ARP synthesizer (on "Puttered
Bopcom") that sounds as if it was
last used in a Lipton Tea
commercial. Nevertheless,
"Bopcom," like the rest of the
album, is a very relaxing piece of
music
