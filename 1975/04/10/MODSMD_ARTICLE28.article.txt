Ford: No Evidence Of Secret Pacts
WASHINGTON — President Ford told bipartisan
congressional leaders yesterday he has reviewed confidential
records of the Nixon administration and has found no
evidence of any secret agreement between Washington and
Saigon.
Ford inspected what his press secretary called
"confidential exchanges" in which former President
Richard Nixon assured the Saigon government that the
United States would "react vigorously" to any military
offensive by Hanoi.
There apparently was no conflict between Ford's
reference to "no secret agreements" and Press Secretary
Ron Nessen's disclosure of "confidential exchanges."
Nessen had said that "in substance the private exchanges do
not differ from what was stated publicly."
Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) contended Tuesday there
had been "secret agreements" between the Nixon
administration and Saigon officials.
Jackson said later that Nessen's statement is "only a
partial disclosure." He said Congress should "obtain all
relevant papers."
Ford met with 16 Democratic and Republican leaders of
Congress to discuss the major foreign policy address he will
deliver at a joint Senate-House session at 6 p.m. PDT today.
Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania
and Ford told the members of Congress his television-radio
address to them will feature a strong appeal "for a new era
of bipartisanship" in foreign affairs.
South Viet Capital Under Fire
SAIGON — A South Vietnamese provincial capital 40
miles east of Saigon came under artillery, tank and infantry
attack today for the second successive day, military sources
said.
Fighting had been reported throughout yesterday in the
area of Xuan Loc, and the Saigon command said North
=4illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllli=

Vietnamese forces were pushed out of the town by
nightfall. The second attack came just after dawn this
morning, the sources said.
It was the first drive on a major city in the Saigon region
since a five-week-old offensive gave the Communist-led side
control of three-fourths of the country, with demoralized
government troops withdrawing without a fight from
central, northern and coastal areas.
The Xuan Loc fighting is being watched closely as an
indicator of whether the South Vietnamese army has the
will to fight.
An unofficial source claimed as many as 300 North
Vietnamese were killed in yesterday's fighting at Xuan Loc,
but there was no confirmation and the figure generally was
felt to be high. Four North Vietnamese tanks reportedly
were destroyed.
Bomb Threats Halt SLA Trial
SACRAMENTO — Three telephoned bomb threats
closed the courthouse where two Symbionese Liberation
Army (SLA) members are on trial for murder for an hour
yesterday.
No explosives were found after the calls came in, shortly
after Sheriff Duane Lowe attacked the American Civil
Liberties Union as "an impudent corps of
pseudo-constitutional lawyers" and said he would not
lessen courthouse security "one iota."
Meanwhile, attorneys were nearing the end of the
seven-day-old jury selection process for the trial of Joseph
Remiro and Russell Little, charged with murder in the 1973
assassination of Marcus Foster, Oakland superintendent of
schools.
Senate Approves Fuel Cut
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday rejected
attempts to end federal controls on oil prices and voted to
require a four percent reduction in fuel consumption over
the next 12 months.
The action came as senators neared the end of debate on
a bill requiring joint state-federal efforts to conserve fuel
and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
The measure also gives the President standby authority,
subject to congressional approval, to ration gasoline and
take over emergency actions if the nation faces another
cutoff of imported oil.
Rocky Charges GOP 'Blackmail'
NEW ORLEANS - Vice President Nelson Rockefeller
charged yesterday that conservative Republican senators
had sought to "blackmail" President Ford over
Rockefeller's role in the recent Senate filibuster battle.
The vice president made the charge in a reply to a
question about the filibuster fight. He was in New Orleans
to appear before a convention of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association.
Rockefeller told the publishers that "certain elements
went to the President and tried to blackmail him about
what that so-and-so up on the Hill was doing."
He declined to name his targets directly, but when asked
if he was referring to conservative Republican senators,
Rockefeller replied: "I think that's a fair statement."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair with patchy night and morning low clouds
thru today and tomorrow. A little warmer days. Lows in
the upper 30s and 40s. Highs in upper 50s to mid 60s. West
to northwest winds 10 to 20 mph.
