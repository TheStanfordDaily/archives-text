# USE Claims Intimidation, Urges Election Boycott
## 
### WILLIAM ROSS 
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) union is urging its members to
boycott the Stanford Hospital
representational elections, claiming
that the hospital administration has
intimidated workers into voting
against USE representation.
The USE yesterday filed an unfair
labor practices charge against the
hospital with the San Francisco office
of the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB), according to Jim Berk, USE
president.
"The management has published
lies," Berk said. "It is not conducting
an honest campaign. The hospital
union is new, and the administration
has yet to learn not to use
heavy-handed tactics against it [the
union |. We have affidavits from
employees saying that supervisors have
told them how to vote."
Berk said the USE was surprised by
the NLRB's refusal to postpone the
elections as the USE had requested.
The NLRB usually grants
postponement of elections if it is
requested within 24 hours before an
election, Berk said.
Bewildered
Berk expressed bewilderment over
the decision by John Meaken, a San
Francisco NLRB official, to deny
USE's request. Meaken could not be
reached for comment.
Although Berk acknowledged that
the NLRB has the option to order the
election held despite USE's request, he
insisted that the NLRB's reasons for
doing so were insufficient.
According to Berk, the NLRB
insisted upon holding the election
because it claimed that the 15
pharmacists who were voting to
choose between non-professional and
professional categories might choose
the professional categories. Their votes
in the professional election might
influence the outcome of the
professional group, which is not
affiliated with the USE, the NLRB

reasoned.
But BerK called the NLRB
argument "a phony excuse" and said it
is almost certain to be declared invalid.
Berk explained that the pharmacists
were certain to choose the
non-professional category and
therefore would not influence the
outcome of the professional election
since by choosing the non-professional
category, they could not vote in the
professional election.
Engineers' Refusal
According to Berk, USE officials
were also particularly upset by the
refusal of the Stanford Medical Center
Engineering Department Association
to participate in the election.
The Association, which represents
80 hospital maintenance employees,
this week withdrew its petition to the
NLRB to participate in Saturday's

hospital employee election to
determine how the workers will be
represented.
The USE last August asked the
NLRB to give engineering department
workers an opportunity to decide
whether the Association or the USE
would represent them.
The Association and the NLRB
subsequently agreed to allow
engineering department workers to
vote this week on whether to join the
union, the Association or have no
representation.
Berk contended that by
withdrawing the petition, the
Association retained the right to
represent employees and therefore
"stole the election."
"We were shocked by the
withdrawal," Berk said. "We couldn't
conceive of anything so gross."
