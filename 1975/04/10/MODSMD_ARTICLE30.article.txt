# Labor And Financial Problems May Sink ASSU 'Course Review'
## 
### CYNTHIA CIMA 
Now in its third year of operation, the ASSU Course
Review faces a tangle of financial and student labor
problems and may fold next year, its editors and business
manager claimed Tuesday.
The Review is almost $500 in debt, according to
Business Manager Deborah Hroncich, and the editors are
having a tough time finding students to volunteer to write
the reviews.
Members of the Review Policy Board had requested
$2000 in ASSU program fee funds for next year, but ASSU
Financial Manager Frank Olivieri recommended no funds in
the proposed program fee budget he submitted to the
Student Senate this week. Board members protested the
omission in a special Senate meeting last night.
The outcome was unavailable at press time.
ASSU Funds
Editors ValerieTonat, Cliff Schireson and Paul Sobotka
said they felt the Review should have had access to the
ASSU money, rather than having to go to the Publications
Board, where Olivieri advised them to go.
Pub Board Chairman Rich Jaroslovsky said yesterday
"The Course Review people are welcome to come to us for
funds." However, he added that they might not receive the
entire $2000 since that would amount to about 10 percent
of the Pub Board's own hoped-for fee assessment revenues.
In spite of budget-cutting measures such as lighter

weight paper and staple binding, the proposed $1.50 price
tag (an increase of 50 cents over last year) will not even
cover the cost of printing, besides payment for typing,
computer assistance and keypunching, Tonal said.
Science Editor Sobotka said he had resorted to
promising part of whatever pay he may receive as editor to
students who helped him with the reviews for
approximately 100 science and math classes.
Other Problems
The Course Review has had a number of other problems
over the year. In the fall they were left without an office
since ARLO (Action Research Liason Office) had moved
into the space formerly occupied by the Review.
The editors managed to get office space from the Quad,
but had no furniture, no telephone and scattered files. In
mid-October Science Editor Stuart Bursten resigned, leaving
the Review with only two editors until Sobotka took over
the job.
Early in winter quarter editors said the Review
encountered a different kind of resistance in the Faculty
Senate over the issue of possible mandatory distribution of
the Review forms, and the variations from department to
department in the handling of the forms.
Sobotka pointed out the drastic reduction in the number
of responses in departments where the ASSU evaluations
were not mandatory.
"There's only a 30 to 40 percent return |on the
questionnaire] in classes where it's optional," he said.
