# Weiss Proposes 'Lecture Jokes'
## COP Slate Mixes Humor, Seriousness 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Second of Five Parts
"We propose the creation of an
ASSU Lecture Joke Servicfe for
professors who want to appear urbane
and witty in class," Council of
Presidents (COP) candidate Steven
Weiss states.
"Profs could use th n m at Faculty
Senate or other committee meetings so
that they can impress their colleagues
as well as their students," vice
presidential candidate Tom Devine
adds.
Explains Weiss, "With help from the
talented Chaparral staff to write the
jokes," the ASSU would provide the
jokes that "professors could purchase
with exclusive rights at a modest
sum."
The rights would only be good for a
quarter, Devine adds, so a person who
is forced to re-take a class will not
have to sit through the same jokes over
and over.
This is the kind of campaign most
people would expect from a slate of
candidates associated with the
infamous Chaparral. But Weiss,
Devine, Shelly Williams and Walter
Kloefkorn balance the absurd with
serious proposals in their campaign.
Used Bookstore
One of their serious plans is to start
a used bookstore as an alternative to
the Stanford Bookstore buy-back and
a A-Phi-0 book exchange. Students
could sell books to the store, which
would re-sell them with very little
mark-up, they say.
Weiss says the University should
begin mail registration like most other
universities. "It should be taken care
of before students get back for
classes," he added.
The Hammer and Coffin slate also
hopes to set up a "free university" in
which anybody can teach a non-credit
course from pottery to yoga to fixing
a car. according to Weiss.
He says the Learning Assistance
Center has had a lot of requests for
shorthand and typing classes, but that
the University doesn't want to offer
classes like those for credit. Classes
like this could be offered through the
free university, Weiss says.
The ASSU woula distribute a
description of the courses offered and
would run the sign-ups.
On another issue, Weiss notes that
"to make this campus more secure at

night hours, the University should
install more lighting."
Devine says that the slate would
urge the University to "open up some
classrooms at night and on weekends"
during dead week and finals to
alleviate the overcrowded libraries.
Devine adds that the slate is also
concerned about energy conservation.
"The University should cut down on
lighting on campus," he urged.
Regarding the role of student
advocacy, the Chaparral slate believes
that the "University will take whatever
action it sees fit," responding only to
mass student action, Weiss says.
Weiss insists that his slate would
not "be toys to the University" as he
claims the current COP officers are,
but would "go around the University."
Devine explains this by proposing that
the money for a guest professor could
go to a professor denied tenure by the
University.
'Recycle Money'
Devine accuses the ASSU of
"following in the footsteps of the
University," speaking of its monetary
situation.
"All money should be recycled
strictly for the students," Weiss adds.
Devine points out that the Hammer
and Coffin slate opposes a permanent
financial manager as a step in the
direction of a more bureaucratic
ASSU.
Weiss attacks the slates headed by

Kevin MeDermott and Lee
Rosenbaum as using a "typical
political ploy" in compiling "essays"
of promises and intentions, of what
they would do if elected.
"We're not obsessed with writing a
position paper on things we'll put
through," Devine notes.
In the area of women's athletics,
Devine has his own comments about a
women's football team. "If they can
get it up, well give them our support,"
he says.
Expand Programs
Devine claims that if his slate is
elected, it would continue the current
successful ASSU programs such as the
Sunday Flicks.

"Some programs should be
expanded,' 1 he says. "Stanford-In-Law
should be expanded because getting
along with one's in-laws is an
important factor in marital
happiness."
Simply stated, we are "not
bureaucratic, not a joke and not paper
passers," Devine points out. "We want
to get the average student who's sick
of seeing the same type of person in
the ASSU."
"And none of us are going to law
school," Weiss proclaims.
"I might," Devine argues, "but I'll
get in whether I'm ASSU president or
not."

political ploy" in compiling "essays"
of promises and intentions, of what
they would do if elected.
"We're not obsessed with writing a
position paper on things we'll put
through," Devine notes.
In the area of women's athletics,
Devine has his own comments about a
women's football team. "If they can
get it up, well give them our support,"
he says.
Expand Programs
Devine claims that if his slate is
elected, it would continue the current
successful ASSU programs such as the
Sunday Flicks.

"Some programs should be
expanded,' 1 he says. "Stanford-In-Law
should be expanded because getting
along with one's in-laws is an
important factor in marital
happiness."
Simply stated, we are "not
bureaucratic, not a joke and not paper
passers," Devine points out. "We want
to get the average student who's sick
of seeing the same type of person in
the ASSU."
"And none of us are going to law
school," Weiss proclaims.
"I might," Devine argues, "but I'll
get in whether I'm ASSU president or
not."
Second of Five Parts
"We propose the creation of an
ASSU Lecture Joke Servicfe for
professors who want to appear urbane
and witty in class," Council of
Presidents (COP) candidate Steven
Weiss states.
"Profs could use th n m at Faculty
Senate or other committee meetings so
that they can impress their colleagues
as well as their students," vice
presidential candidate Tom Devine
adds.
Explains Weiss, "With help from the
talented Chaparral staff to write the
jokes," the ASSU would provide the
jokes that "professors could purchase
with exclusive rights at a modest
sum."
The rights would only be good for a
quarter, Devine adds, so a person who
is forced to re-take a class will not
have to sit through the same jokes over
and over.
This is the kind of campaign most
people would expect from a slate of
candidates associated with the
infamous Chaparral. But Weiss,
Devine, Shelly Williams and Walter
Kloefkorn balance the absurd with
serious proposals in their campaign.
Used Bookstore
One of their serious plans is to start
a used bookstore as an alternative to
the Stanford Bookstore buy-back and
a A-Phi-0 book exchange. Students
could sell books to the store, which
would re-sell them with very little
mark-up, they say.
Weiss says the University should
begin mail registration like most other
universities. "It should be taken care
of before students get back for
classes," he added.
The Hammer and Coffin slate also
hopes to set up a "free university" in
which anybody can teach a non-credit
course from pottery to yoga to fixing
a car. according to Weiss.
He says the Learning Assistance
Center has had a lot of requests for
shorthand and typing classes, but that
the University doesn't want to offer
classes like those for credit. Classes
like this could be offered through the
free university, Weiss says.
The ASSU woula distribute a
description of the courses offered and
would run the sign-ups.
On another issue, Weiss notes that

Devine says that the slate would
urge the University to "open up some
classrooms at night and on weekends"
during dead week and finals to
alleviate the overcrowded libraries.
Devine adds that the slate is also
concerned about energy conservation.
"The University should cut down on
lighting on campus," he urged.
Regarding the role of student
advocacy, the Chaparral slate believes
that the "University will take whatever
action it sees fit," responding only to
mass student action, Weiss says.
Weiss insists that his slate would
not "be toys to the University" as he
claims the current COP officers are,
but would "go around the University."
Devine explains this by proposing that
the money for a guest professor could
go to a professor denied tenure by the
University.
'Recycle Money'
Devine accuses the ASSU of
"following in the footsteps of the
University," speaking of its monetary
situation.
"All money should be recycled
strictly for the students," Weiss adds.
Devine points out that the Hammer
and Coffin slate opposes a permanent
financial manager as a step in the
direction of a more bureaucratic
ASSU.

during dead week and finals to
alleviate the overcrowded libraries.
Devine adds that the slate is also
concerned about energy conservation.
"The University should cut down on
lighting on campus," he urged.
Regarding the role of student
advocacy, the Chaparral slate believes
that the "University will take whatever
action it sees fit," responding only to
mass student action, Weiss says.
Weiss insists that his slate would
not "be toys to the University" as he
claims the current COP officers are,
but would "go around the University."
Devine explains this by proposing that
the money for a guest professor could
go to a professor denied tenure by the
University.
'Recycle Money'
Devine accuses the ASSU of
"following in the footsteps of the
University," speaking of its monetary
situation.
"All money should be recycled
strictly for the students," Weiss adds.
Devine points out that the Hammer
and Coffin slate opposes a permanent
financial manager as a step in the
direction of a more bureaucratic
ASSU.
Weiss attacks the slates headed by

Kevin MeDermott and Lee
Rosenbaum as using a "typical
political ploy" in compiling "essays"
of promises and intentions, of what
they would do if elected.
"We're not obsessed with writing a
position paper on things we'll put
through," Devine notes.
In the area of women's athletics,
Devine has his own comments about a
women's football team. "If they can
get it up, well give them our support,"
he says.
Expand Programs
Devine claims that if his slate is
elected, it would continue the current
successful ASSU programs such as the
Sunday Flicks.

"Some programs should be
expanded,' 1 he says. "Stanford-In-Law
should be expanded because getting
along with one's in-laws is an
important factor in marital
happiness."
Simply stated, we are "not
bureaucratic, not a joke and not paper
passers," Devine points out. "We want
to get the average student who's sick
of seeing the same type of person in
the ASSU."
"And none of us are going to law
school," Weiss proclaims.
"I might," Devine argues, "but I'll
get in whether I'm ASSU president or
not."
