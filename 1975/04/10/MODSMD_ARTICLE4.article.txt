## COP Slate Mixes Humor, Seriousness

Second of Five Parts
"We propose the creation of an
ASSU Lecture Joke Servicfe for
professors who want to appear urbane
and witty in class," Council of
Presidents (COP) candidate Steven
Weiss states.
"Profs could use th n m at Faculty
Senate or other committee meetings so
that they can impress their colleagues
as well as their students," vice
presidential candidate Tom Devine
adds.
Explains Weiss, "With help from the
talented Chaparral staff to write the
jokes," the ASSU would provide the
jokes that "professors could purchase
with exclusive rights at a modest
sum."
The rights would only be good for a
quarter, Devine adds, so a person who
is forced to re-take a class will not
have to sit through the same jokes over
and over.
This is the kind of campaign most
people would expect from a slate of
candidates associated with the
infamous Chaparral. But Weiss,
Devine, Shelly Williams and Walter
Kloefkorn balance the absurd with
serious proposals in their campaign.
Used Bookstore
One of their serious plans is to start
a used bookstore as an alternative to
the Stanford Bookstore buy-back and
a A-Phi-0 book exchange. Students
could sell books to the store, which
would re-sell them with very little
mark-up, they say.
Weiss says the University should
begin mail registration like most other
universities. "It should be taken care
of before students get back for
classes," he added.
The Hammer and Coffin slate also
hopes to set up a "free university" in
which anybody can teach a non-credit
course from pottery to yoga to fixing
a car. according to Weiss.
He says the Learning Assistance
Center has had a lot of requests for
shorthand and typing classes, but that
the University doesn't want to offer
classes like those for credit. Classes
like this could be offered through the
free university, Weiss says.
The ASSU woula distribute a
description of the courses offered and
would run the sign-ups.
On another issue, Weiss notes that
"to make this campus more secure at

Walt Kloefkorn congregate around a coffin in front of the Mausoleum. The slate's platform is mostly joking, partly serious.
