# Student Vote, Compromise Offer Will Determine Lawsuit's Future
## 
### DAN FIDUCCIA 
Second of Three Parts
The future of the fee assessment for
the Escondido Village and ASSU
parking fee lawsuit against the
University depends not only on next
week's fee assessment vote but also on
next Monday night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
The $1 fee assessment, which
would be levied autumn quarter, will
be used to continue the current
lawsuit. However, Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger has proposed a
compromise to the Senate which
would end the University's collection
of rent money to pay for parking
services. It would also permit
on-campus students to park registered
vehicles in "Off-Campus Permit"
parking areas.

Escondido Village Council
President Cathie Colson said this fee
assessment would provide enough
funds to take the case to the California
Supreme Court. The assessment might
also be used against the Carpenter
report, she added.
Colson noted that by voting for the
fee assessment "students will have a
good chance to show their feelings. It's
the only way students can voice their
opinion on the whole parking system,
both for this year and next year."
May Rescind Lawsuit
ASSU Sen. Mike Lindsey said that
with the new proposal from the
University, the Senate will consider
rescinding the fee assessment and
withdrawing the lawsuit. "Students
who want to carry on with the suit
should come to the Senate meeting
Monday night," Lindsey said. Lindsey

has not yet decided what he will
suggest at the meeting.
ASSU Sen. Pieter Winsemius, who
is also examining the compromise, said
that he would take a fee assessment
rejection as meaning that "people
don't support the lawsuit."
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Dale
Snape said "the Carpenter report is
more to the point than the issues of
the lawsuit." If the Senate leaves the
assessment on the ballot, and if the
assessment passes, Snape said there is
still a question of whether the
University will collect a fee
assessment, which would be used
against itself.
Snape pointed out that a fee
assessment is a serious matter and has
the University's backing. He remarked
that this assessment would be used as
salary money going to non-students,
and that "it may be beneficial but it's
non-educational."
Snape said he believes if the
assessment is passed a decision on its
collection would be reached by the
end of the quarter.
Rising Costs
KZSU Radio is asking for a fee
assessment of $3, with $1 each to be
levied over autumn, winter and spring
quarters. KZSU Station Manager
Michael Windes said the station
receives no money from the University
and a very minimal amount in
advertising. KZSU's maintenance and
equipment costs have risen, Windes
said, adding that it can no longer
operate on only a $2 fee assessment.
Mandatory costs for UPI/UPI-
Audio, tapes, records and telephones
have risen. Windes said. KZSU has also
given a salary raise to parallel
economic trends but is still paying
only about $2 per hour, he said.
According to Windes, the station must
employ a business manager and a log
secretary to deal with legal affairs.
Windes claimed that KZSU expects
to have its higher power request
approved by the Federal
Communications Commission this
summer, raising its operating costs.
The station also needs building
improvements, soundproofing, a triple
tape deck cartridge and reserve funds,
he said.
Windes estimated that next year
KZSU will have $22,000 in"mandatory"
expenses and $10,000 in"necessary"
expenses. He said he believes the
station can only meet these costs with
a $3 fee assessment.
