# Jack, Micki Scott Surface, Criticize FBI

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Jack Scott and his
wife Micki emerged from hiding yesterday and said
they would not cooperate in the search for fugitive
heiress Patricia hearst.
They refused to answer questions on the
whereabouts of Hearst, bitterly denouncing the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S.
government.
"We have done nothing wrong. We are not
fugitives," Mrs. Scott told a news conference at
Glide Memorial church, a liberal Methodist church
here. Her husband and basketball star Bill Walton
also were present.
"We can now understand why Patty Hearst
believed for the first weeks of her kidnaping that
the FBI had no concern for her welfare," Scott said.
"The moment she was kidnaped her life was
threatened because the FBI was itching for a
shootout with the SLA [Symbionese Liberation
Army]."
'Completely Defensible'
"Our actions of the past year are completely
defensible " Mrs. Scott said. "If we somehow acted
to avert bloodshed and killing, we certainly find

nothing to apologize for or be ashamed of.
"We have chosen to surface so the harassment of
our loved ones will cease," she said, referring to the
grand jury subpoenas for Scott's father and mother,
Jack and Louise, who live in Las Vegas. Both were
at the news conference. They have been excused by
the federal grand jury investigating the Hearst case
here.
The Scotts reportedly rented the Pennsylvania
farmhouse where Hearst and others may have stayed
last summer. A federal grand jury in Pennsylvania
questioned a friend of the Scotts last March 13, and
the Scotts' whereabouts were unknown to
authorities since then.
The FBI has said there are no charges against the
Scotts, but agents have said they want to question
them about the whereabouts of Hearst and her SLA
comrades.
No Legal Authority
Hearst, 21, daughter of Randolph Hearst,
president and editor of the San Francisco Examiner,
was kidnaped on Feb. 4, 1974, from her Berkeley
apartment by the SLA. She later announced she was
joining her captors.

After the news conference, FBI Special Agent
Charles Bates said: "I don't know that I'm going to
have any comment, and if anyone wants to talk to
the FBl,we're happy to talk with them. Unless we
have warrants for people's arrests, we don't have
any legal authority to detain people."
The Scotts left the church about an hour after
the news conference ended.
The Scotts surfaced following an unconfirmed
report that Hearst, sought on various charges,
including bank robbery, was with the Scotts on an
aircraft bound for Algeria.
Refuse To Testify
"We have no intention of talking to the FBI now
or in the future," said Scott, 33, former athletic
director at Oberlin College in Ohio. If called before
a grand jury, he said, they would appear but refuse
to testify.
"We do not want to become accessories to more
murders by the police," he said, reading a prepared
statement.
Walton said, "I'm terribly sorry I cooperated in
any way, shape or form with such a
counterproductive organization as the FBI,"
