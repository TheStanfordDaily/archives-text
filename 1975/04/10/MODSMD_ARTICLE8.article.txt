# KZSU-Yes
## 
### 
We recommend a YES vote on the $3 fee assessment
requested by Stanford radio station KZSU.
The money collected by assessments represents virtually
all of the station's income, since, by law, KZSU-FM is not
permitted to broadcast advertising. Without the money, the
station would most certainly fold.
KZSU, through extensive public affairs programming,
offers students a chance to voice and listen to views which
often cannot be presented in campus print media because of
space considerations.
After reviewing KZSU's proposed 1975-76 budget, we are
somewhat skeptical that more than a $2 fee assessment is
justified. But we do not feel that the assessment should be
voted down because some of the expenditures may be
excessive.
We are disturbed that KZSU says it must spend $1000 to
finance construction of a bathroom in the station. The
facility is needed, since KZSU programmers currently violate
FCC regulations by leaving the station. We think, however,
that the University has a responsibility to pay for all
necessary permanent improvements in University buildings.
