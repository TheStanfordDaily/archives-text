# Stanford Band-Yes
## 
### 
We recommend a YES vote on the $1 fee assessment
requested by the Stanford Band.
The Band will primarily use its fee assessment money to
partially reimburse its members for a two-week trip East to
the Penn State and Michigan football games. Past experience
has shown that the Band always travels extremely frugally,
and does not waste student dollars.
We think this trip is important because it will give people
in other parts of the country a positive impression of the
Stanford student body, one which will add to the students'
(as well as the University's) prestige.
