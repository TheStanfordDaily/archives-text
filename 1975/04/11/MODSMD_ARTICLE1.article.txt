# Club Sports To Receive No Funding
## 
### PRIMO SANTINI 
The ASSU Senate rejected a
proposal Wednesday night to add
endangered club sports to the list of
organizations eligible for funds to be
generated by the Senate-sponsored
program fee assessment.
Tom Winokur. chairman of the
Club Sports Council, had requested
$7500 from the Senate, an amount
that would have allowed a shrunken
club program to fund remaining sports
at their present level for one more
year. Some present club sports have
been elevated to varsity status.
Club sports were forced to seek an
alternative source of funding when Joe
Ruetz, head of the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation, informed stunned
members of the Council Wednesday
morning that thov would receive no
financial support from the department
next year.
The Senate, according to Winokur.
thought addition of club sports
funding would necessitate making the
existing $1 program fee assessment a
$2 assessment and jeopardizing passage
of the proposal.
Ruetz' decision, presented to the
Council as a "fait accompli" according
to council member Tom Heckler, will
affect 10 club sports and result in the
loss of $15,000 to the club sports
program. Last year, over 770 students
participated in club sports each
quarter.
'Varsity Club'
However, Ruetz' recent creation
of a new category of sports, "varsity
club," supported by his department,
has made it possible for the remaining
club sports to continue at their present
level on a budget of $7500. The new
category contains the former club
sports of crew, sailing, and men's and
women's volleyball. Traditionally,
crew and sailing received nearly half of
the club sports budget.
Money for the club sports program
presently originates from the
university's general fund but is
channeled through the athletic
department. In response to
information that the University will
reduce its financial support of the
athletic department by $120,000 over
the next three year, Ruetz has cut
next year's budget by $90,000. The
budget cut includes the elimination of
department funding for club sports.
Ruetz said the criteria used to
eliminate funding for club sports
"were economic considerations and
respect for sports' traditions Stanford
has developed over the years — and,
perhaps, a gut feeling as to what sports
are growing and have spectator
interest."
Viable Program
Ruetz said creation of the varsity
club sports is an attempt to maintain a
"viable sports program at Stanford" in
times of economic pressure.
Winokur stated he was not aware of
the decision to eliminate club sports
funding until Ruetz announced it.
"I was under the impression that
the $15,000 was sacred. 1 was given
this impression during a fall quarter
meeting with Ruetz," said Winokur.
Ruetz' Decision
Ruetz said "the decision was mine
and mine alone. Input (from the
Council | wouldn't have helped. We
had to make a decision and you can
not run a department with everyone
involved in the decision-making
process."

affect 10 club sports and result in the
loss of $15,000 to the club sports
program. Last year, over 770 students
participated in club sports each
quarter.
'Varsity Club'
However, Ruetz' recent creation
of a new category of sports, "varsity
club," supported by his department,
has made it possible for the remaining
club sports to continue at their present
level on a budget of $7500. The new
category contains the former club
sports of crew, sailing, and men's and
women's volleyball. Traditionally,
crew and sailing received nearly half of
the club sports budget.
Money for the club sports program
presently originates from the
university's general fund but is
channeled through the athletic
department. In response to
information that the University will
reduce its financial support of the
athletic department by $120,000 over
the next three year, Ruetz has cut
next year's budget by $90,000. The
budget cut includes the elimination of
department funding for club sports.
Ruetz said the criteria used to
eliminate funding for club sports
"were economic considerations and
respect for sports' traditions Stanford
has developed over the years — and,
perhaps, a gut feeling as to what sports
are growing and have spectator
interest."
Viable Program
Ruetz said creation of the varsity
club sports is an attempt to maintain a
"viable sports program at Stanford" in
times of economic pressure.
Winokur stated he was not aware of
the decision to eliminate club sports
funding until Ruetz announced it.
"I was under the impression that
the $15,000 was sacred. 1 was given
this impression during a fall quarter
meeting with Ruetz," said Winokur.
Ruetz' Decision
Ruetz said "the decision was mine
and mine alone. Input (from the
Council | wouldn't have helped. We
had to make a decision and you can
not run a department with everyone
involved in the decision-making
process."
The ASSU Senate rejected a
proposal Wednesday night to add
endangered club sports to the list of
organizations eligible for funds to be
generated by the Senate-sponsored
program fee assessment.
Tom Winokur. chairman of the
Club Sports Council, had requested
$7500 from the Senate, an amount
that would have allowed a shrunken
club program to fund remaining sports
at their present level for one more
year. Some present club sports have
been elevated to varsity status.
Club sports were forced to seek an
alternative source of funding when Joe
Ruetz, head of the Department of
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation, informed stunned
members of the Council Wednesday
morning that thov would receive no
financial support from the department
next year.
The Senate, according to Winokur.
thought addition of club sports
funding would necessitate making the
existing $1 program fee assessment a
$2 assessment and jeopardizing passage
of the proposal.
Ruetz' decision, presented to the
Council as a "fait accompli" according
to council member Tom Heckler, will
affect 10 club sports and result in the
loss of $15,000 to the club sports
program. Last year, over 770 students
participated in club sports each
quarter.
