Another Nero
Editor:
On Monday, April 7, as
millions of persons went hungry
throughout the world, as "U.S.
Marines Ready to Land in
Vietnam" (Daily, p. 1), as the
Women's Fair was about to begin
while "Commitment to Minorities
Declining?" (Daily, p. 2), what
did the Daily editors choose to
editorialize about? "Find New
Flicks."
Ah, the University in 1975: as
the world burns, "to the movies
we go."

Biased Endorsement?
Editor:
I find it rather curious that of
the four members of the Council
of Presidents slate endorsed by
the Daily, two, Mark Simonian
and Bonny Rodden, had until
very recently been members of
the Daily's staff. Could this factor
have led the editors of the Daily
to disregard the extremely
misleading literature distributed
by the Kevin McDermott slate?
One cannot help but question
the integrity of the Daily when it
will endorse a slate of candidates
that is so closely associated with
the present editorial staff.

(NOTE: Obviously, there will be
many who disagree with our
endorsement. But we don't feel
that just because two members of
the slate are former Daily staffers,
their slate should be disqualified
from receiving our endorsement.
The decision in question was
based on the judgment of a voting
majority of the editorial board
that the McDermott slate is the
best qualified.)
