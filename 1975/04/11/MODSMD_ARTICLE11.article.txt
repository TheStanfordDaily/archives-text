# Support Proposed 'Daily' Fee Assessment
## 
### 
The Daily is asking students
next week to approve a $1
refundable fee assessment for next
fall, winter and summer quarters.
We'd like your vote.
The Daily's Board of Directors
decided to seek this assessment
after lengthy study of the issues
and problems involved. We have
examined our current financial
situation, what it will most likely
be next year, and what we had
previously hoped it would be. The
Board has concluded that a fee
assessment this year is not only
desirable but necessary for the
survival of the paper.
When the idea of legal and
financial independence for the

Daily was seriously broached in
1970, the Daily and the
University alike expended a great
deal of thought and planning. But
since then, a number of factors
have arisen that either were not or
could not be foreseen.
Newsprint Cost Soars
The area of production has
been perhaps the most staggering
problem. Owing to labor and
other problems that have beset
the Canadian pulp industry —
from which most U.S. newsprint
comes — the cost of paper has
jumped some 44 percent in only
two years. This, along with the
crippling inflation rate, has
already driven up Daily printing

costs — our largest single
expenditure — 20 percent in one
year. And prospects are for
another jolt next year.
Similarly, no one five years ago
could have foreseen two serious
recessions that have adversely
affected our finances. While total
advertising lineage lias increased,
the recession has forced some
previously heavy advertisers to
curtail their spending, has slowed
down payments from those
people who do advertise and has
created a general climate of
uncertainty leading to a "roller
coaster effect" on advertising:
some weeks are good, others drop
off inexplicably.

The Daily has already
instituted some cost-cutting and
profit-maximizing measures.
Editorial salaries have been
reduced; billing procedures have
been tightened; we've launched
new projects like the football and
basketball issues and "theme"
supplements. But these measures
alone are simply not sufficient.
Huge Projected Lj>ss
The Daily was officially
incorporated as a non-profit
California corporation in early
1973; students have not paid for
the paper since fall of that year.
We're returning now for money
because we will simply be faced
with an unmanageable deficit —
an estimated $31,000 — without
it.
Besides the student fee
assessment, we are also seeking
$10,000 from the University to
pay for faculty and staff copies.
In the interests of equity, neither
of these fees will be collected
unless the other is approved; both
fees average out to a cost of
substantially less than two cents
per person per copy. And since
summer is one of the quarters for
which we're seeking the
assessment, most regular students
would pay just $2 for the school
year. We think that's a small price
to pay.

Doily' Board of Directors

Our decision to seek this
money was not made lightly. It
came by a unanimous vote of the
Daily Board of Directors, which is
invested with the responsibility
for running the corporation. This
board is comprised of Stanford
law student Diane Fields, the
chairperson; Daily Editor Kevin
Smith, president; Communication
Prof. William L. Rivers; William F.
Kartozian, attorney for United
Artists Theaters; San Francisco
Chronicle Editorial Page Editor
Templeton Peck; former Daily
Editor Jim Wascher; Business
Manager Michael Kuhl, the vice
president; and Advertising
Manager Lee Han ley.
In the next few days, we will
be going into greater detail about
our current financial status and
our projections for next year. We
particularly want to call attention
to Monday's paper, which will
include both relevant facts and
figures and the answers to some
frequently asked questions about
our request. We hope you'll take
the time to read and consider the
information — and that you'll
vote yes on the Daily fee
assessment next Wednesday and
Thursday.
