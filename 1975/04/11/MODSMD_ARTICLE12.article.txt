# Gallo Feels A Big Pinch

### 
First Of Two Parts
It is clear that Gallo is feeling a big pinch in its
business. Newspaper and television ads by Gallo are
increasing. California wine sales figures show
Gallo's share of state wine production during the
first six months of 1974 dipped seven percent from
the same period in 1973.
The Wall Street Journal reported a nine percent
decline in sales and attributed it in part to the
effects of the boycott. Gallo now has Joshua
Simons, "Director of Education Communications,"
writing letters to the Daily.
In his letter (Daily, March 31), Simons says in
part that the United Farmworkers Union (UFW)
supporters are ignoring the "core issue — that Gallo
farm workers are in the union of their choice."
Here is some history on how that "choice"
happened in 1973. Embroidered into those
important negotiating days between Feb. 1, 1973
and July 10, 1973 were incidents of Gallo firing
UFW workers and of Gallo giving assistance to
Teamsters to organize workers.
On March 22, 1973, negotiations began. The
United Farmworkers' negotiating committee
consisting of Gallo workers and Dave Burciga,
UFW's chief negotiator, met with Gallo. They
asked for day-at-a-time contract extension as long
as negotiations continued past April 18, the
contract's expiration date. This is a standard
negotiating request. Bob Deatrick of Gallo refused.
On April 18, 1973 this same request was made
to Deatrick and again refused by phone and in
writing. From that date on, Gallo maintained wage
rates, but violated other protections guaranteed in
the UFW contract. For example, pesticides were
sprayed in the fields for the first time in years.
Then on April 24, 1973, curiously enough,
Teamster organizers began appearing in the fields.
They were accompanied by Gallo supervisors. UFW
organizers were not allowed in the fields after April
18, the contract expiration date.
May 8, 1973 was the third session of shaky
negotiations. Gallo proposed a contract with
sweeping changes including the elimination of the
hiring hall, union security, pesticide control, etc.

In May and June, Gallo fired five UFW workers
for "union activities." One of those fired was a
duly elected member of the Gallo Ranch
Committee. By these deeds, Gallo made it clear
that they were planning to sign with the Teamsters
unless the UFW gave up the most fundamental
aspects of its contract.
Sure enough, on June 26, 1973, Gallo handed a
letter to all its workers saying it would negotiate
with the Teamsters.
So, on June 27, 127 Gallo workers went on
strike to protest this "sweetheart" relationship with
the Teamsters. More than 135 Gallo workers with
established seniority were on the picket line while
Gallo was talking with the Teamsters in late June
and early July.
Ernest Gallo admitted to Rod Taylor of the
local Fresno Bee "that striking workers were
notified that they would be fired if they did not
return to work."
Gallo said that these workers were "discharged"
(actually they were on strike) and that new workers
were recruited (i.e. by the Teamsters). Gallo has
admitted that those who were on strike had no
voice in the matter — i.e. the ratification of the
Teamster contract (see National Catholic
Reporter, Jan. 10, 1975).
This Gallo procedure in 1973 contrasts sharply
with their actions in 1967. On Aug. 7, 1967 the
California State Conciliation came in at the request
of Gallo and the UFW and verified the workers'
signatures for UFW. This led to the first UFW-Gallo
contract in 1967.
But Gallo has never been willing to let a third
party examine the Teamster "evidence." The real
evidence would reveal that those voting were
strike-breakers brought in by the Teamsters — not
those who had been working for Gallo at the time
the UFW contract was being negotiated.
The UFW called for a free election with an
outside party counting and including those who
were working for Gallo in the early months of
1973.
