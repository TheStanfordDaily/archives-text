# Campaign Promises Make Fine Decorations
## Posters: A Rite Of Spring 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
By BRUCE KADDEN

The return of campaign posters to
bathroom doors indicates that it's election
time once again. Five slates of candidates are
actively campaigning for the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP), presenting a diverse choice
for the student body.
The most striking point in this year's
election is the large number of candidates who
have been associated with the various campus
media. Besides the official Chaparral slate,
COP hopefuls have worked at the Daily, the
Quad and KZSU. So don't be surprised if your
john doors are covered with literary
masterpieces.
These statements of qualifications and
campaign promises, or "premises" as one slate
refers to them, indicate that there is
something for everybody in this year's race.
At the top of your ballot next Wednesday
and Thursday you'll probably find four names
you've never heard of (unless you read the
Daily): Charles Jameson, David Cooper, Walt
Pyka and Paul Collopy.
Sincere
Though admitting they have had little
political experience here, this advertised
"pre-med/engineering" slate hopes that
"sincerity, honesty and willingness to work
for the students" will persuade enough voters
to look no further down the list.
Jameson and his cohorts say they hope for
extensive student input, which is why they
have few specific ideas. They do want to
improve communication between the COP
and students by presenting their views in a
weekly Daily column and providing a 24-hour
hotline for students to phone in their
reactions.

The most refreshing campaign is being run
by the Hammer and Coffin Society slate,
associated with the witty, gross and clever
Stanford Chaparral. But don't let their
publication's nature fool you; Steven Weiss,
Shelly Williams, Walter Kloefkorn and Tom
Devine hope you take them seriously.
Indeed, many of their proposals are dead
serious, like a used-book store, registration by
mail and a "free university" offering
non-credit classes in everything from typing to
yoga. »
But mingled with these one will find an
ASSU Lecture .'eke Service for professors to
impress their students and colleagues, and an
expansion of the Stanford-in-Law program
"because getting along with one's inlaws is an
important factor in marital happiness."
Pretty Posters
You'll recognize their posters because they
look like ads for toothpaste or sunglasses.
And if they don't tickle your fancy, it's a
cinch the Mike Lopez - Gary Cohen Preston
Dufauchard slate will. "Take it from three
guys who know. Stanford can be fun," their
posters advertise.
They plan to institute a coed Harrad
Experiment-type theme house dedicated to
"the pursuit of happiness." They also want to
increase special student activities, returning
ASSU Special Events profits to the students
through campus-wide parties and similar
events.
Hotline
The Lopez slate also likes the idea of
forming an ASSU hotline (497-ASSU) to
handle problems and listen to the suggestions
of interested students.
If non-politics turns you off, the last two

slates make up for the unorthodox
candidates at the top of the ballot.
Lee Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane have the
most experience in Stanford student
government and in stude nt advocacy of any of
the slates. According to their printed
philosophy, they see the COP "as a facilitator
for students who want to initiate student
services, help students cut administrative red
tape and defend student rights."
They offer numerous premises upon which
they plan to act including ASSU-SCIRE Task
Forces to evaluate undergraduate and
graduate education, student life and the
University's land-use policy; a Community
Buying Guide; peer advising; putting a student
on the Board of Trustees, a women's building
to house campus women's groups; and an
improved, free ASSU Course Review.
Rounding out the ballot are Kevin
McDermott, Bonny Rodden, Andy Leuchter
and Mark Simonian. They appear to have
done the most "homework" of any of the
slates, including a transportation survey.
Their position papers propose that a
student be placed on the Trustees' Budget Ad
Hoc Committee, expanded services to
students living off campus, extensive surveys
to indicate student opinion, and a Residential
Speakers/Visitors Program (RSVP) to help
coordinate dorm speaking events witf 1
residents and staff for informal programs.
These five slates offer a diverse enough
choice to make almost everyone happy,
which won't mean that everyone will vote.
But at least everyone will have a good time
going to the bathroom.

government and in stude nt advocacy of any of
the slates. According to their printed
philosophy, they see the COP "as a facilitator
for students who want to initiate student
services, help students cut administrative red
tape and defend student rights."
They offer numerous premises upon which
they plan to act including ASSU-SCIRE Task
Forces to evaluate undergraduate and
graduate education, student life and the
University's land-use policy; a Community
Buying Guide; peer advising; putting a student
on the Board of Trustees, a women's building
to house campus women's groups; and an
improved, free ASSU Course Review.
Rounding out the ballot are Kevin
McDermott, Bonny Rodden, Andy Leuchter
and Mark Simonian. They appear to have
done the most "homework" of any of the
slates, including a transportation survey.
Their position papers propose that a
student be placed on the Trustees' Budget Ad
Hoc Committee, expanded services to
students living off campus, extensive surveys
to indicate student opinion, and a Residential
Speakers/Visitors Program (RSVP) to help
coordinate dorm speaking events witf 1
residents and staff for informal programs.
These five slates offer a diverse enough
choice to make almost everyone happy,
which won't mean that everyone will vote.
But at least everyone will have a good time
going to the bathroom.

The return of campaign posters to
bathroom doors indicates that it's election
time once again. Five slates of candidates are
actively campaigning for the ASSU Council of
Presidents (COP), presenting a diverse choice
for the student body.
The most striking point in this year's
election is the large number of candidates who
have been associated with the various campus
media. Besides the official Chaparral slate,
COP hopefuls have worked at the Daily, the
Quad and KZSU. So don't be surprised if your
john doors are covered with literary
masterpieces.
These statements of qualifications and
campaign promises, or "premises" as one slate
refers to them, indicate that there is
something for everybody in this year's race.
At the top of your ballot next Wednesday
and Thursday you'll probably find four names
you've never heard of (unless you read the
Daily): Charles Jameson, David Cooper, Walt
Pyka and Paul Collopy.
Sincere
Though admitting they have had little
political experience here, this advertised
"pre-med/engineering" slate hopes that
"sincerity, honesty and willingness to work
for the students" will persuade enough voters
to look no further down the list.
Jameson and his cohorts say they hope for
extensive student input, which is why they
have few specific ideas. They do want to
improve communication between the COP
and students by presenting their views in a
weekly Daily column and providing a 24-hour
hotline for students to phone in their
reactions.

The most refreshing campaign is being run
by the Hammer and Coffin Society slate,
associated with the witty, gross and clever
Stanford Chaparral. But don't let their
publication's nature fool you; Steven Weiss,
Shelly Williams, Walter Kloefkorn and Tom
Devine hope you take them seriously.
Indeed, many of their proposals are dead
serious, like a used-book store, registration by
mail and a "free university" offering
non-credit classes in everything from typing to
yoga. »
But mingled with these one will find an
ASSU Lecture .'eke Service for professors to
impress their students and colleagues, and an
expansion of the Stanford-in-Law program
"because getting along with one's inlaws is an
important factor in marital happiness."
Pretty Posters
You'll recognize their posters because they
look like ads for toothpaste or sunglasses.
And if they don't tickle your fancy, it's a
cinch the Mike Lopez - Gary Cohen Preston
Dufauchard slate will. "Take it from three
guys who know. Stanford can be fun," their
posters advertise.
They plan to institute a coed Harrad
Experiment-type theme house dedicated to
"the pursuit of happiness." They also want to
increase special student activities, returning
ASSU Special Events profits to the students
through campus-wide parties and similar
events.
Hotline
The Lopez slate also likes the idea of
forming an ASSU hotline (497-ASSU) to
handle problems and listen to the suggestions
of interested students.
If non-politics turns you off, the last two

slates make up for the unorthodox
candidates at the top of the ballot.
Lee Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane have the
most experience in Stanford student
government and in stude nt advocacy of any of
the slates. According to their printed

publication's nature fool you; Steven Weiss,
Shelly Williams, Walter Kloefkorn and Tom
Devine hope you take them seriously.
Indeed, many of their proposals are dead
serious, like a used-book store, registration by
mail and a "free university" offering
non-credit classes in everything from typing to
yoga. »
But mingled with these one will find an
ASSU Lecture .'eke Service for professors to
impress their students and colleagues, and an
expansion of the Stanford-in-Law program
"because getting along with one's inlaws is an
important factor in marital happiness."
Pretty Posters
You'll recognize their posters because they
look like ads for toothpaste or sunglasses.
And if they don't tickle your fancy, it's a
cinch the Mike Lopez - Gary Cohen Preston
Dufauchard slate will. "Take it from three
guys who know. Stanford can be fun," their
posters advertise.
They plan to institute a coed Harrad
Experiment-type theme house dedicated to
"the pursuit of happiness." They also want to
increase special student activities, returning
ASSU Special Events profits to the students
through campus-wide parties and similar
events.
Hotline
The Lopez slate also likes the idea of
forming an ASSU hotline (497-ASSU) to
handle problems and listen to the suggestions
of interested students.
If non-politics turns you off, the last two

slates make up for the unorthodox
candidates at the top of the ballot.
Lee Rosenbaum, Josie Jaramillo, Dave
Galligan and Charlotte Germane have the
most experience in Stanford student
government and in stude nt advocacy of any of
the slates. According to their printed
philosophy, they see the COP "as a facilitator
for students who want to initiate student
services, help students cut administrative red
tape and defend student rights."
They offer numerous premises upon which
they plan to act including ASSU-SCIRE Task
Forces to evaluate undergraduate and
graduate education, student life and the
University's land-use policy; a Community
Buying Guide; peer advising; putting a student
on the Board of Trustees, a women's building
to house campus women's groups; and an
improved, free ASSU Course Review.
Rounding out the ballot are Kevin
McDermott, Bonny Rodden, Andy Leuchter
and Mark Simonian. They appear to have
done the most "homework" of any of the
slates, including a transportation survey.
Their position papers propose that a
student be placed on the Trustees' Budget Ad
Hoc Committee, expanded services to
students living off campus, extensive surveys
to indicate student opinion, and a Residential
Speakers/Visitors Program (RSVP) to help
coordinate dorm speaking events witf 1
residents and staff for informal programs.
These five slates offer a diverse enough
choice to make almost everyone happy,
which won't mean that everyone will vote.
But at least everyone will have a good time
going to the bathroom.

AMERICAN GRAFFITI?—During spring quarter, a bathroom user's fancy can't help but turn to
thoughts of ASSU Council of Presidents campaign platforms. These posters festoon a door in a
vVilbur Hall bathroom, but similar decorations provide reading material in virtually every dorm
bathroom on campus.
