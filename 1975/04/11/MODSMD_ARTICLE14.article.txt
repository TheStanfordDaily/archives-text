# C-15 Offers New Judicial Reform Plan; The Rules Of The Game Don't Change
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Spring has arrived, and with it, the annual
"final" proposal from the Committee of 15
(C-15) to reform the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP).
The game is played by the same rules every
year: the C-15 assures students that the
current proposal alone will be acceptable, and
that its defeat will burden students with the
present CJP forevermore.
Last year, for example, ASSU Senate
Chairman Rocky Barber said of a
soon-to-be-rejected proposal, "The present
compromise is not unworkable." President
Lyman said at that time, "I think it is going to
take quite a while to come up with another
proposal if this one is rejected."
After the proposal's advocates had played
their roles, the students went along with the
game. They rejected the "reform" plan by a
vote of 1555 to 527.
So this year, the game continues. C-15
Chairwoman Kathy Cunningham said, "These
changes are the best we can possibly succeed
in getting at this time."
Frequent Faculty Majority
"These changes" would permanently install
two things the students have most opposed: a
difference in selection procedure between
students and faculty, and a faculty majority in
some cases.
Of course, the CJP proposal does not put it
so bluntly. It provides for a committee of six
voting members, three students and three
faculty members. The CJP would have two
co-chairmen, a law student and a law
professor.
The Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees would continue to nominate
faculty members. The ASSU Senate would
nominate student members — sort of. It
would have to choose from the inevitable
randomly generated list. And if the Senate
should try to protest the system by refusing
to appoint members, the system would save
itself: student members would once again be
selected entirely at random.
Unmitigated Inequity
Students have for years complained that
under the CJP, arbitrarily created by Lyman
in 1971, students and faculty are selected in
different ways. The current proposal
apparently does not relieve this inequity.
But the game continues. "That was a
concession we had to make to account for
mistakes in the past," Cunningham explained.
So while students make concessions, the
faculty members have it both ways: the ASSU
may select members, but only on dictated
terms. The faculty, meanwhile, selects its
members essentially as it sees fit.
Students have also long insisted that any
campus judicial system should have a student

majority. On the surface, the new proposal
seems to deal with this. It provides for the
student chairman (appointed, incidentally, on
recommendation by the Dean of the Law
School) to preside and break ties in Honor
Code cases. In all other cases, the faculty
chairman would preside.
Shackled Senate
Supporters of the proposal proudly point
out that 17 of the last 19 cases considered
have been Honor Code violation cases.
Therefore, they assert, the CJP will indeed
have a student majority in the overwhelming
majority of cases.
But even if it went no deeper, this would

not meet the student demands for a student
majority in all cases — just in most. The
obvious problem would come if campus
activism did indeed experience a revival.
Suddenly the CJP would be swamped with
non-Honor Code cases, many of substantial
interest and importance, and all presided over
by a faculty-majority judicial panel.
Only this time, the ASSU Senate would
not be able to destroy the panel's credibility
by refusing to appoint students; with or
without student support, the "compromise"
CJP — and its faculty majority — would
remain.

non-Honor Code cases, many of substantial
interest and importance, and all presided over
by a faculty-majority judicial panel.
Only this time, the ASSU Senate would
not be able to destroy the panel's credibility
by refusing to appoint students; with or
without student support, the "compromise"
CJP — and its faculty majority — would
remain.
Spring has arrived, and with it, the annual
"final" proposal from the Committee of 15
(C-15) to reform the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP).
The game is played by the same rules every
year: the C-15 assures students that the
current proposal alone will be acceptable, and
that its defeat will burden students with the
present CJP forevermore.
Last year, for example, ASSU Senate
Chairman Rocky Barber said of a
soon-to-be-rejected proposal, "The present
compromise is not unworkable." President
Lyman said at that time, "I think it is going to
take quite a while to come up with another
proposal if this one is rejected."
After the proposal's advocates had played
their roles, the students went along with the
game. They rejected the "reform" plan by a
vote of 1555 to 527.
So this year, the game continues. C-15
Chairwoman Kathy Cunningham said, "These
changes are the best we can possibly succeed
in getting at this time."
Frequent Faculty Majority
"These changes" would permanently install
two things the students have most opposed: a
difference in selection procedure between
students and faculty, and a faculty majority in
some cases.
Of course, the CJP proposal does not put it
so bluntly. It provides for a committee of six
voting members, three students and three
faculty members. The CJP would have two
co-chairmen, a law student and a law
professor.
The Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees would continue to nominate
faculty members. The ASSU Senate would
nominate student members — sort of. It
would have to choose from the inevitable
randomly generated list. And if the Senate
should try to protest the system by refusing
to appoint members, the system would save
itself: student members would once again be
selected entirely at random.
Unmitigated Inequity
Students have for years complained that
under the CJP, arbitrarily created by Lyman
in 1971, students and faculty are selected in
different ways. The current proposal
apparently does not relieve this inequity.
But the game continues. "That was a
concession we had to make to account for
mistakes in the past," Cunningham explained.
So while students make concessions, the
faculty members have it both ways: the ASSU
may select members, but only on dictated
terms. The faculty, meanwhile, selects its
members essentially as it sees fit.
Students have also long insisted that any
campus judicial system should have a student

majority. On the surface, the new proposal
seems to deal with this. It provides for the
student chairman (appointed, incidentally, on
recommendation by the Dean of the Law
School) to preside and break ties in Honor
Code cases. In all other cases, the faculty
chairman would preside.
Shackled Senate
Supporters of the proposal proudly point
out that 17 of the last 19 cases considered
have been Honor Code violation cases.
Therefore, they assert, the CJP will indeed
have a student majority in the overwhelming
majority of cases.
But even if it went no deeper, this would

not meet the student demands for a student
majority in all cases — just in most. The
obvious problem would come if campus
activism did indeed experience a revival.
Suddenly the CJP would be swamped with
non-Honor Code cases, many of substantial
interest and importance, and all presided over
by a faculty-majority judicial panel.
