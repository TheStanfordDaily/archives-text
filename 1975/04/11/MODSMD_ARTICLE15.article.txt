# 'Big Bucks' Give Olivieri A Reason To Grin
## ASSU Investment Risks Might Give University Investors Reason To Worry 
### GLENN KRAMON 
By GLENN KRAMON

ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
loves to talk about the "big bucks" his
investments are earning for future ASSU
expenditures.
Olivieri, a second-year business student
with a heavy Bronx accent, grins each time he
thinks about the $18,795 accrued since last
autumn from interest on corporate bonds,
deposit certificates and bankers acceptance
notes.
Indeed, University Director of Finance
Rodney Adams, who has managed Stanford's
investments for eight years, admits that
Olivieri has earned more interest on the ASSU
funds than the University would have, at least
in the short run.
Currently, all $251,000 of the ASSU's
operating reserves is invested in AAA-, AA
and A-rated corporate bonds paying between
7.6 and 12.5 percent interest to maturity.
Another $150,000 from ASSU banking
accounts is now in bankers acceptance notes
paying 6.25 percent interest.
Most observers agree that Olivieri has
performed competently it. his role as ASSU
investor. As a result, neither the ASSU nor the
University has been forced to deal with the
troublesome question of who really has final
authority over ASSU money.
Risky Independence
It's an important issue, because by
investing on its own, the ASSU takes a higher
risk than it would if it simply put its money in
the considerably larger University investment
pool.
As a guideline, Adams has issued a very
specific "Approved List" which he insists
applies to all ASSU investments.

Olivieri contends the University can not
legally force the ASSU's hand. ASSU Senate
Chairman Lee Rosenbaum, a former Senate
parliamentarian, and Sen. Kevin McDermott, a
member of the Senate's finance committee,
agree.
But no one wants to argue about it as long
as the financial manager and the University
can agree on each ASSU investment. It
appears that Olivieri respects the judgment of
University investors enough to heed their
warnings by staying out of bonds they
consider too risky.
Though Olivieri denies that direct

University pressure forced him to sell $5000
worth of recently-purchased Avco Finance
bonds this week, it seems likely that advice
from Adams about the company's financial
difficulties influenced the financial manager's
decision.
He admits that "in the final analysis, the
University can do whatever it pleases. We
could argue the point to death, but if they
really want to," the University could force the
ASSU to liquidate a bond by threatening to
cut off funding of the ASSU's banking
ope ration.
And yet, Olivieri is aggressive enough to

convince University officials of the value of
expanding the Approved List to allow him
new areas of investment.
In January, when Olivieri saw that interest
rates on bankers' acceptances notes and
deposit certificates were falling steadily, he
quickly asked Adams to expand the Approved
List to include low-risk AAA and AA
corporate bonds of higher yields.
Advice And Consent
Again this past week, he negotiated with
Adams and secured the University's consent
to buy higher interest, higher risk A-rated
bonds. "It means a couple of hundred dollars
annually. That'll pay the salaries of a couple
of secretaries for a few weeks," he notes.
In fact, Olivieri admits he has often sought
University advice after the fact, asking t!ie
University if the purchase is acceptable after
he has made it. If the University convinces
him that his purchase was not in the ASSU's
interest, he must then sell the bonds and pay a
broker's commission.
Olivieri is thus free enough to run his own
show. He decides himself which investments
are to be made.
Olivieri says he makes his investment
decisions on the basis of "pure yield, maturity
dates and the Standard & Poor's rating — not
on what people say.
"If I listened to the socially conscious
people, I wouldn't invest in the big, bad,
privately-owned oil companies. But those oil
bonds earn money with little risk" (Olivieri
has put $30,000 into oil bonds).
Whether or not everybody agrees on his
investments, one thing's for sure — they're
earning money for the ASSU at a time when
it's badly needed.

He admits that "in the final analysis, the
University can do whatever it pleases. We
could argue the point to death, but if they
really want to," the University could force the
ASSU to liquidate a bond by threatening to
cut off funding of the ASSU's banking
ope ration.
And yet, Olivieri is aggressive enough to

convince University officials of the value of
expanding the Approved List to allow him
new areas of investment.
In January, when Olivieri saw that interest
rates on bankers' acceptances notes and
deposit certificates were falling steadily, he
quickly asked Adams to expand the Approved
List to include low-risk AAA and AA
corporate bonds of higher yields.
Advice And Consent
Again this past week, he negotiated with
Adams and secured the University's consent
to buy higher interest, higher risk A-rated
bonds. "It means a couple of hundred dollars
annually. That'll pay the salaries of a couple
of secretaries for a few weeks," he notes.
In fact, Olivieri admits he has often sought
University advice after the fact, asking t!ie
University if the purchase is acceptable after
he has made it. If the University convinces
him that his purchase was not in the ASSU's
interest, he must then sell the bonds and pay a
broker's commission.
Olivieri is thus free enough to run his own
show. He decides himself which investments
are to be made.
Olivieri says he makes his investment
decisions on the basis of "pure yield, maturity
dates and the Standard & Poor's rating — not
on what people say.
"If I listened to the socially conscious
people, I wouldn't invest in the big, bad,
privately-owned oil companies. But those oil
bonds earn money with little risk" (Olivieri
has put $30,000 into oil bonds).
Whether or not everybody agrees on his
investments, one thing's for sure — they're
earning money for the ASSU at a time when
it's badly needed.

ASSU Financial Manager Frank Olivieri
loves to talk about the "big bucks" his
investments are earning for future ASSU
expenditures.
Olivieri, a second-year business student
with a heavy Bronx accent, grins each time he
thinks about the $18,795 accrued since last
autumn from interest on corporate bonds,
deposit certificates and bankers acceptance
notes.
Indeed, University Director of Finance
Rodney Adams, who has managed Stanford's
investments for eight years, admits that
Olivieri has earned more interest on the ASSU
funds than the University would have, at least
in the short run.
Currently, all $251,000 of the ASSU's
operating reserves is invested in AAA-, AA
and A-rated corporate bonds paying between
7.6 and 12.5 percent interest to maturity.
Another $150,000 from ASSU banking
accounts is now in bankers acceptance notes
paying 6.25 percent interest.
Most observers agree that Olivieri has
performed competently it. his role as ASSU
investor. As a result, neither the ASSU nor the
University has been forced to deal with the
troublesome question of who really has final
authority over ASSU money.
Risky Independence
It's an important issue, because by
investing on its own, the ASSU takes a higher
risk than it would if it simply put its money in
the considerably larger University investment
pool.
As a guideline, Adams has issued a very
specific "Approved List" which he insists
applies to all ASSU investments.

Olivieri contends the University can not
legally force the ASSU's hand. ASSU Senate
Chairman Lee Rosenbaum, a former Senate
parliamentarian, and Sen. Kevin McDermott, a
member of the Senate's finance committee,
agree.
But no one wants to argue about it as long
as the financial manager and the University
can agree on each ASSU investment. It
appears that Olivieri respects the judgment of
University investors enough to heed their
warnings by staying out of bonds they
consider too risky.
Though Olivieri denies that direct

University pressure forced him to sell $5000
worth of recently-purchased Avco Finance
bonds this week, it seems likely that advice
from Adams about the company's financial
difficulties influenced the financial manager's
decision.
He admits that "in the final analysis, the
University can do whatever it pleases. We

really want to," the University could force the
