# An Aborted Tresidder Transition: Food To Books

William's "baby," extending the Bookstore
into Tresidder Memorial Union (TMU), has
virtually died before leaving the crib.
Under the extension plan, the University
was to lease TMU space, including all of the
cafeteria (the Transition), the kitchen and
part of the basement.
Tresidder has lost hundreds of thousands
of dollars in past years. It "could break even
next year" with such a lease agreement,
Williams claimed last week. But even he now
admits that the Bookstore board of directors
"is 99 percent against the move," and the
chances for the panel changing its views seem
slim.
Bookstore General Manager Eldon Speed
agrees that the TMU move idea probably will
be aborted. He notes that the University
planning office is investigating other plans for
expansion.
Other Options
The first plan under investigation calls for
the Bookstore to build a separate building
behind the existing one in the Bookstore-Post
Office parking lot.

The second plan is "to knock out a wall"
and build an addition onto the north end of
the current building, Speed says. He estimates
that the Bookstore currently needs 15,000
square feet of additional space.
Speed says the Bookstore board will select
the expansion plan which "best serves the
students and the community." But it seems
more likely that the board will choose the
least costly alternative.
The decision won't be made until the
Planning Office issues its report. It should be
completed in approximately two weeks,
according to University Senior Planner Carroll
S. Rankin.
The Bookstore would be expanded into
Tresidder only if the report shows that each
of the two other expansion plans is too costly,
Speed says.
Possible Inconvenience
Why is a TMU extension not higher on the
Bookstore's priority list? Speed says that a
division of Bookstore services into two
locations as far apart as Tresidder and the
current Bookstore creates an inconvenience
for students.
For example, he says, "if you have to come

here [to the Bookstore] for a book, and you
have to go to Tresidder for a pencil, it might
be rather inconvenient."
This inconvenience could mean a decrease
in sales, Speed says.
Other operating costs make the move to
TMU even less likely. These costs include
expensive duplication of cash registers,
personnel and furnishings.
Because it is unlikely that part of the
Bookstore will move into Tresidder, Williams,
TMU director, still has a problem: what to do
with the space.
The Transition, a fast-food service which
took the place of the failing TMU cafeteria
last September, is "a killer" financially and
must be replaced by next fall, he says.
The University will have to consider
alternate plans, which include enlarging
Marcel's pastry shop, and adding a
Baskin-Robbins ice cream franchise, various
clothing stores and a flower shop.
Williams says that "plans on that front are
shelved until we find out what the Bookstore
is going to do." But given the current
situation, he and others will have to start
thinking seriously about those plans.
