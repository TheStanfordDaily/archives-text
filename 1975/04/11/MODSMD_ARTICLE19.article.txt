# C-15 summarizes major recommendations
## 
### 
Following is the text of a letter from Kathleen Cunning
ham, chairwoman of the Committee of 15, to President
Richard W. Lyman April 4, transmitting recommendations
for a revised Campus Judicial Charter.
The Committee of 15 has concluded its inquiry, initiated
at your request, to see whether the Campus Judicial Panel is
meeting the needs of Stanford students, faculty, and staff.
We have conducted interviews and received statements
from past CJP members (both students and faculty), CJP
Chairmen John Kaplan, William Cohen, and William Keogh,
Prosecutors Carole Price and John Schwartz, Dean of Student
Affairs Jim Lyons, and several student defendents.
We have concluded that the CJP has operated adequately.
However, several elements in its structure and operations as
well as the absence of student ratification have been the
subject of considerable debate. Compromises which have
resulted from that debate led to the enclosed proposal for
changes to the present system. Per your request, on Monday,
(April 7) we will tender this proposal to the Academic and
ASSU Senates for their consideration.
The more substantive proposed revisions affect panel com
position, the selection of panel members, and the role of the
Dean of Students in the judicial process. Basically they are as
folows:
* The panel will consist of three students, three faculty
members and two Chairpersons, one a faculty member, the
other from the Law School student body. The former chair
person will be appointed by the President after consultation

with the Dean of the Law School, the latter appointed by the
President after consultation with the Dean of the Law School
who shall confer with appropriate law student groups.
* The student Chairperson will preside over and vote to
break ties in Honor Code hearings; the faculty Chairperson
will preside over and vote to break ties in all other cases.
* Faculty members will continue to be selected by the
Committee on Committees of the Academic Senate. Student
members and alternates will be appointed by the ASSU
Senate from a randomly-selected pool of 24 registered stu
dents who have indicated a willingness to serve. In the event
that the ASSU Senate fails to appoint student members, they
shall be selected randomly from the registered student body
at large.
* We have also introduced a procedure under which the
student, complainant, or appropriate Chairperson can request
a probation-type report to be prepared by the Dean of
Students. This will enable the panel to understand more
adequately the circumstances surrounding the case.
Should you have further questions on the proposal or the
reasoning behind it, I or several representatives of the C-15
would be most willing to meet with you at your convenience.
The C-15 will host a public meeting sometime in the next
10 days to explain and discuss this complicated document
with the Stanford community. 1 will alert you as to its time
and location when this information is confirmed.
The committee has adjourned but can be reconvened
subject to your request or that of the Chair.

will preside over and vote to break ties in all other cases.
* Faculty members will continue to be selected by the
Committee on Committees of the Academic Senate. Student
members and alternates will be appointed by the ASSU
Senate from a randomly-selected pool of 24 registered stu
dents who have indicated a willingness to serve. In the event
that the ASSU Senate fails to appoint student members, they
shall be selected randomly from the registered student body
at large.
* We have also introduced a procedure under which the
student, complainant, or appropriate Chairperson can request
a probation-type report to be prepared by the Dean of
Students. This will enable the panel to understand more
adequately the circumstances surrounding the case.
Should you have further questions on the proposal or the
reasoning behind it, I or several representatives of the C-15
would be most willing to meet with you at your convenience.
The C-15 will host a public meeting sometime in the next
10 days to explain and discuss this complicated document
with the Stanford community. 1 will alert you as to its time
and location when this information is confirmed.
The committee has adjourned but can be reconvened
subject to your request or that of the Chair.
Following is the text of a letter from Kathleen Cunning
ham, chairwoman of the Committee of 15, to President
Richard W. Lyman April 4, transmitting recommendations
for a revised Campus Judicial Charter.
The Committee of 15 has concluded its inquiry, initiated
at your request, to see whether the Campus Judicial Panel is
meeting the needs of Stanford students, faculty, and staff.
We have conducted interviews and received statements
from past CJP members (both students and faculty), CJP
Chairmen John Kaplan, William Cohen, and William Keogh,
Prosecutors Carole Price and John Schwartz, Dean of Student
Affairs Jim Lyons, and several student defendents.
We have concluded that the CJP has operated adequately.
However, several elements in its structure and operations as
well as the absence of student ratification have been the
subject of considerable debate. Compromises which have
resulted from that debate led to the enclosed proposal for
changes to the present system. Per your request, on Monday,
(April 7) we will tender this proposal to the Academic and
ASSU Senates for their consideration.
The more substantive proposed revisions affect panel com
position, the selection of panel members, and the role of the
Dean of Students in the judicial process. Basically they are as
folows:
* The panel will consist of three students, three faculty
members and two Chairpersons, one a faculty member, the
other from the Law School student body. The former chair
person will be appointed by the President after consultation

with the Dean of the Law School, the latter appointed by the
President after consultation with the Dean of the Law School
who shall confer with appropriate law student groups.
* The student Chairperson will preside over and vote to
break ties in Honor Code hearings; the faculty Chairperson
will preside over and vote to break ties in all other cases.
* Faculty members will continue to be selected by the
Committee on Committees of the Academic Senate. Student
members and alternates will be appointed by the ASSU
Senate from a randomly-selected pool of 24 registered stu
dents who have indicated a willingness to serve. In the event
that the ASSU Senate fails to appoint student members, they
shall be selected randomly from the registered student body
